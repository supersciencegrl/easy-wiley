         <title>Light&#8208;Dependent Chemoselective Amide or Thioamide Ligation of Acylsilanes with Amines using Elemental Sulfur</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Due to the diverse chemical and physical properties of functional groups, mild and controllable ligation methods are often required to construct complex drugs and functional materials. To make diverse sets of products with tunable physicochemical properties, it is also useful to employ complimentary ligation methods that adopt the same starting materials. Here, we disclose the efficient and modular synthesis of amides or thioamides through the chemical ligation of acyl silanes with amines, simply by turning a light on or off. This method is fast, mild, high&#8208;yielding and displays excellent functional&#8208;group tolerance. The versatility of these reactions is highlighted by their ability to perform post&#8208;synthetic modifications on a variety of marketed medications, peptides, natural substances, and compounds with biological activity. In&#8208;depth computational and experimental studies clarified the photo&#8208;dependent umpolung of reactivity of acyl silanes, namely: photoexcitation leads to nucleophilic O&#8208;silyl carbenes that react with S8 to form O&#8208;silyl thionoesters and eventually amides. In contrast, acyl silanes react as electrophiles with amines thermally in the dark, with C&#8594;O silyl transfer, prior to reacting with S8 to form thioamides. These mechanistic details are expected to guide the development of similar coupling reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Mechanical, Thermal, and Morphological Analysis of Himalayan Agave Fiber/GO Coated Fly Ash Hybrid Polypropylene Composites</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 2, January 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hybrid composites of alkali&#8208;APTES treated Himalayan agave fibers (HAF) and polypropylene (PP) successfully reinforced with graphene oxide (GO) treated fly ash (FA). The optimized reinforcement improved tensile and flexural properties, and crystallinity, and highlighting a significant step towards sustainable and performance composite manufacturing.







Abstract
Composites containing two different types of reinforcements offer a wide range of possibilities and synergistic properties. This study investigates the hybridization effect of chemically active fly ash (FA) (5&#8197;wt&#8201;%) on the composites made from alkali (1&#8197;wt&#8201;%) &#8208; APTES silane (2&#8197;wt&#8201;%) treated Himalayan agave fibers (HAF) (25&#8197;wt&#8201;%) and polypropylene (PP). Prior to FA activation, the planetary ball mill was used to suitably reduce the particle size of the FA with was confirmed by the dynamic light scattering approach. Secondary reinforcement FA was modified with APTES silane (1&#8197;wt&#8201;%), followed by treatment with graphene oxide (GO) (0.5, 0.75, and 1&#8197;wt&#8201;%). The highest tensile strength of 40.47&#8197;MPa and modulus of 1.49&#8197;GPa were observed for the hybrid composites fabricated from 0.75 and 1.0&#8197;wt&#8201;% GO treated fly ash. Interestingly, this trend differed for flexural properties, and the highest flexural strength of 53.52&#8197;MPa was demonstrated by 0.5&#8197;wt&#8201;% GO treated FA hybrid composite. Thermal characterization revealed that addition of fiber increased crystallinity but decreased thermal stability, whereas a good wettability of the fiber and FA in matrix was demonstrated through morphological characterization.

         <title>Design Concepts of High&#8208;Entropy Materials for Zinc Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 2, January 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;entropy materials, with their unique atomic structures and uniform distribution of multiple elements, enable flexible choices in composition and electronic structure, attracting significant interest in zinc&#8208;ion battery systems. This paper reviews the latest design strategies for high&#8208;entropy materials in cathodes, anodes, and electrolytes, offering potential solutions for efficient battery material development.







Abstract
Zinc&#8208;ion batteries have emerged as strong candidates for replacing Li/Na&#8208;ion batteries owing to their high safety and environmental friendliness. However, the large electrostatic repulsion between the cathode and Zn2+, the irreversible growth of zinc dendrites at the anode, and the hydrogen precipitation side reaction in the aqueous electrolyte have hindered the practical application of zinc ion batteries. Fortunately, the emergence of the revolutionary concept of high entropy has provided new opportunities for the development of battery materials. High&#8208;entropy materials, with their unique atomic structures and uniform distribution of multiple elements, offer flexible options for material compositions and electronic structures, thus attracting significant attention in battery systems. In this concept article, we summarize the definitions and intrinsic structural characteristics of high&#8208;entropy materials and provide a detailed overview of the latest design concepts from the perspectives of cathodes, anodes, and electrolytes. Finally, we outline the challenges faced by high&#8208;entropy materials and potential solutions to guide researchers in developing efficient and stable zinc&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>Peptide Designs for Cell&#8208;Interfacing Assemblies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 2, January 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This concept review underscores the pivotal role of designing cell&#8208;interfacing peptide assemblies, including the precise control of displayed molecules, the regulation of molecular dynamics to modulate cell behaviors, and responsiveness to biological stimuli. Finally, the development of advanced cell&#8208;interfacing biomaterials is summarized and prospected.







Abstract
Constructing synthetic materials to interact with cells offers significant promise for understanding natural cellular processes and manipulating cell behaviors beyond nature's capabilities. Peptide assemblies are particular promising in this regard, as they have demonstrated efficacy in promoting cell differentiation, repair, and regeneration as supportive scaffolds. However, distinct gaps persist between natural and synthetic assembly systems in various aspects. This Concept review explores representative studies focusing on developing chemical strategies to design peptide assemblies with precise control over displayed molecules, adjustable molecular dynamics to modulate cell behaviors, and responsiveness to biological stimuli. This paper would inspire more fundamental studies on molecular assemblies and foster inter&#8208;disciplinary interests in material applications, advancing the interplay between natural cells and synthetic materials.

         <title>Active Photonic Glass for Hydrogen Generation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 2, January 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This article reports the fabrication of photonic glass with a chiral nematic structure using a simple sol&#8208;gel evaporation&#8208;induced cellulose nanocrystals self&#8208;assembly method. The glass exhibits variable iridescent colors over the UV&#8208;visible range. The chiral nematic structure provides the photoactive films the capability to improve the localized surface plasmon of Au and lead to improved photocatalytic H2 generation







Abstract
Chirality is vital in many living species since it is responsible for structural iridescent coloration and plays a key role in light harvesting during natural photosynthesis. Developing photoactive materials with such chiral structures is a challenging but promising strategy for energy applications. Here, we present a straightforward method to establish an active photonic glass obtained through the co&#8208;condensation of tetramethyl orthosilicate (TMOS) and titanium diisopropoxide bis(acetylacetonate) (TAA) dissolved in a liquid crystal formed from cellulose nanocrystalline (CNC). The inorganic glass maintains a long range of chiral nematic ordering, displaying iridescent colors characterized by a Bragg peak reflection. The reflected wavelengths are tuned all over the UV&#8208;visible range, demonstrating that the replica of the chiral nematic structure generates photonic properties. Incorporation of gold nanoparticles (Au NPs) into the films is further performed by impregnation/chemical reduction. We show that the charge carrier density and photocatalytic H2 generation were amplified when the photonic band gap edges matched the absorbance of the TiO2 and localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) of AuNPs. This photocatalytic glass with chiral nematic ordering and a tunable photonic bandgap paves the way for the development of metamaterials with new applications, such as asymmetric photocatalysis.

Incorporation of gold nanoparticles (Au NPs) into the films is further performed by impregnation/chemical reduction. We show that the charge carrier density and photocatalytic H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; generation were amplified when the photonic band gap edges matched the absorbance of the TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) of AuNPs. This photocatalytic glass with chiral nematic ordering and a tunable photonic bandgap paves the way for the development of metamaterials with new applications, such as asymmetric photocatalysis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Changes in Secondary Structure Upon Pr to Pfr Transition in Cyanobacterial Phytochrome Cph1 Detected by DNP NMR</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 2, January 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Phytochromes undergo structural changes upon light reception, involving a &#946;&#8208;sheet&#8208;to&#8208;helix transition for the canonical subgroup. We show this for the cyanobacterial phytochrome Cph1, that has a different sheet sequence than a previous example, by solid&#8208;state NMR under dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) conditions. An estimation of minimal helix length suggests conservation of the mechanism.







Abstract
Phytochromes perceive subtle changes in the light environment and convert them into biological signals by photoconversion between the red&#8208;light absorbing (Pr) and the far&#8208;red&#8208;absorbing (Pfr) states. In the primitive bacteriophytochromes this includes refolding of a tongue&#8208;like hairpin loop close to the chromophore, one strand of an antiparallel &#946;&#8208;sheet being replaced by an &#945;&#8208;helix. However, the strand sequence in the cyanobacterial phytochrome Cph1 is different from that of previously investigated bacteriophytochromes and has a higher &#946;&#8208;sheet propensity. We confirm here the transition experimentally and estimate minimum helix length using dynamic nuclear polarisation (DNP) magic angle spinning NMR. Sample conditions were optimized for protein DNP NMR studies at high field, yielding Boltzmann enhancements &#1013;B of 19 at an NMR field of 18.801&#8197;T. Selective labelling of Trp, Ile, Arg, and Val residues with 13C and 15N enabled filtering for pairs of labelled amino acids by the 3D CANCOCA technique to identify signals of the motif 483Ile&#8208;Val&#8208;Arg485 (IVR) present in both sheet and helix. Those signals were assigned for the Pfr state of the protein. Based on the chemical shift pattern, we confirm for Cph1 the formation of a helix covering the IVR motif.

         <title>Economically Scalable Cu&#8208;based MOFs: Vital Role of Structural Integrity towards Selectivity on Azeotropic Ethanol Dehydration</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 2, January 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A scalable production of Cu&#8208;triazole MOF through a facile and economical route is demonstrated. Providing hydrophilic pores with open&#8208;metal Cu&#8208;sites, the framework is highly selective to water adsorption from an azeotropic mixture of water&#8208;ethanol. Furthermore, the enhanced framework's crystallinity is a key to success in the improved performance of liquid&#8208;phase ethanol dehydration.







Abstract
A facile, green, and economical method for the scalable synthesis of hydrophilic copper&#8208;triazole metal&#8208;organic frameworks (Cu&#8208;trz) is demonstrated. Numerous open metal sites within the highly crystalline porous structure of Cu&#8208;trz are generated through mild thermal activation, enabling its application in liquid&#8208;phase ethanol dehydration under ambient conditions. The frameworks with distinct crystallinity and particle sizes were achieved by modifying the synthesis process. The high crystallinity of the framework plays an exclusive role in enhancing water adsorption capacity. With selective water adsorption comparable to commercial zeolite 3&#8197;A, Cu&#8208;trz MOF emerges as a promising candidate for cost&#8208;effective water&#8208;ethanol separation.

         <title>Impact of Dihedral Angle in Conjugated Organic Cation on the Structures and Properties of Organic&#8208;Inorganic Lead Iodides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 2, January 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dihedral angle inside the organic cation significantly change the crystal packing as&#8208;well&#8208;as optical property of hybrid organic&#8208;inorganic metal halides (HOIMHs). We used N&#8208;substituted 2&#8208;2&#8217;&#8208;bipyridinium cation (iodide counter&#8208;ion) for the synthesis of HOIMHs. The change in dihedral angle of the organic cation gives two different hybrid crystal with different optical property.







Abstract
Conjugated organic cations are intriguing for organic&#8208;inorganic halide perovskites due to their direct participation in the optoelectronic properties of hybrid materials. In conjugated cations, the dihedral angle, or torsion angle, between adjacent aromatic rings is a critical secondary structural element. This angle influences not only the shape of the cations but also the overlap between the &#960;&#8208;orbitals on adjacent rings, thereby affecting their electronic properties. Understanding how variations in the dihedral angle impact the structure and properties of hybrid organic&#8208;inorganic metal halides (HOIMHs) is fundamentally important. In this study, we utilized 2,2&#8242;&#8208;dimethyl bipyridinium as the organic cation, reacting it with PbI&#8322; to form hybrid lead iodides. Remarkably, variations in the dihedral angle between the two pyridinium rings resulted in the formation of two distinct crystal structures with different band gaps. Our findings demonstrate that manipulating the dihedral angle offers a novel approach to controlling the structures and properties of hybrid metal halides with conjugated cations.

         <title>Study on Intelligent Bionic Superhydrophobic Material and its Oil&#8208;Water Separation Mechanism</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 2, January 9, 2025. </description>

A novel Fe3O4@SiO2@PMMA&#8208;based smart bionic superhydrophobic material demonstrates efficient oil&#8208;water separation performance. With outstanding durability, chemical stability, and high separation efficiency for oil&#8208;water mixtures and emulsions, this material achieves a separation efficiency of up to 99.85&#8201;% and enables precise oil absorption under magnetic control, showcasing broad application prospects in ecological pollution management and oil spill remediation.







Abstract
Marine oil spills and improper disposal of daily oil usage have posed significant threat to ecological environments and human health due to rapid industrial development. In this study, an environmentally friendly, simple process and high&#8208;performance Fe3O4@SiO2@Polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA)&#8208;based smart bionic superhydrophobic oil&#8208;absorbing material was developed for effectively collecting and removing oil pollutants from water. By studying the effects of Fe3O4 particle size, polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) concentration, and heating time on the superhydrophobicity of the materials, the directional regulation of superhydrophobicity and oil&#8208;water separation performance of Fe3O4@SiO2@PMMA@PDMS materials was realized. The results showed that the material exhibited optimal performance when the Fe3O4 particle size combination was 20/500&#8197;nm/1&#8197;&#956;m, the mass ratio of PDMS to Fe3O4@SiO2@PMMA was 7&#8201;:&#8201;1, and it was heated at 350&#176;C for 1&#8197;minute. The coating achieved an apparent contact angle (APCA) of 158.7&#176; and a rolling angle as low as 4.9&#176;. This coating not only remained superhydrophobic after a 21&#8197;m abrasion test and 288&#8197;h immersion in acid, alkali, salt, and high&#8208;temperature solutions, but also efficiently separated oil&#8208;water mixtures and water&#8208;in&#8208;oil emulsions, and the separation efficiency for oil&#8208;water mixtures of trichloromethane, dichloromethane and bromomethane was over 99.78&#8201;%, and that for water&#8208;in&#8208;oil emulsions was over 98.34&#8201;%. Furthermore, the superhydrophobic magnetic polyurethane (SFPU) sponge prepared using Fe3O4@SiO2@PMMA not only exhibited excellent oil&#8208;absorbing capacity (11&#8211;28&#8197;g/g), but also realized precise oil absorption at multiple sites by magnetic conduction. In the actual oily wastewater test, the oil&#8208;water separation efficiency of the sponge reached 90.58&#8201;% and the oil absorption capacity reached 17.03&#8197;g/g. This efficient oil&#8208;water separation performance as well as oil adsorption capacity comes from the fact that the nonpolar molecules (e.&#8201;g., &#8722;CH3) generated by the hydrolysis of PDMS can produce van der Waals adsorption with oil substances, while the excellent micro&#8208;nanostructure of the coating surface greatly increases the contact area between oil droplets and the coating, which can make them adsorb or pass through quickly. This multifunctional coating and sponge had immense application potential in fields like offshore oil spill treatment, organic pollution control in water bodies.

In the actual oily wastewater test, the oil-water separation efficiency of the sponge reached 90.58&#8201;% and the oil absorption capacity reached 17.03&#8197;g/g. This efficient oil-water separation performance as well as oil adsorption capacity comes from the fact that the nonpolar molecules (e.&#8201;g., &#8722;CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) generated by the hydrolysis of PDMS can produce van der Waals adsorption with oil substances, while the excellent micro-nanostructure of the coating surface greatly increases the contact area between oil droplets and the coating, which can make them adsorb or pass through quickly. This multifunctional coating and sponge had immense application potential in fields like offshore oil spill treatment, organic pollution control in water bodies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Tuning Electron&#8208;Transfer Driving Force in Photosynthetic Special Pair Models</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 2, January 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In bimetallic {(tpy)Ru&#8208;Ru(L)}, MLCT excited states prepared upon visible light absorption are photoinduced mixed valence systems. This makes them excellent models of the photosynthetic reaction center. In these models, the balance of positive charge density is determined by the tpy radical anion and can be finely controlled by ligand L substitution. Impacts on electronic spectroscopy of photoinduced IVCT bands are discussed with the help of TD&#8208;DFT.







Abstract
Visible&#8208;light excitation of a family of bimetallic ruthenium polypyridines with the formula [RuII(tpy)(bpy)(&#8208;CN)RuII(py)4L]n+ (RuRuLn+), where L=Cl&#8722;, NCS&#8722;, DMAP and ACN, was used to prepare photoinduced mixed&#8208;valence (PI&#8208;MV) MLCT states as models of the photosynthetic reaction center. Ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy allowed to monitor photoinduced IVCT bands between 6000 and 11000&#8197;cm&#8722;1. Mulliken spin densities resulting from DFT and (TD)DFT computations revealed the modulation of the charge density distribution depending on the ligand substitution pattern. Results are consistent with PI&#8208;MV systems ranging from non&#8208;degenerate Class&#8197;II to degenerate Class&#8197;III or II/III, with electronic couplings between 1000 and 3500&#8197;cm&#8722;1. These findings guide the control electron localization&#8208;delocalization in charge&#8208;transfer/charge&#8208;separated excited states, like those involved in the photosynthetic reaction center.

The work encompasses construction of four Azo&#8208;Stilbene&#8208; ThT (AST) and metal binding pyridyl&#8208;amine moieties and exploration on their multifunctionality w.r.t. to (i) metal chelating capacities (ii) A&#946; recognition and ability to modulate their aggregation, (iii) scavenge free radicals, (iv) inhibit the activity of acetylcholinesterase and (v) cytotoxicity with neuronal cells.







Abstract
Inhibition of amyloid &#946; (A&#946;) aggregation and cholinesterase activity are two major therapeutic targets for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Multifunctional Molecules (MFMs) specifically designed to address other contributing factors, such as metal ion induced abnormalities, oxidative stress, toxic A&#946; aggregates etc. are very much required. Several multifunctional molecules have been developed using different molecular scaffolds. Reported herein is a new series of four MFMs based on ThT, Azo&#8208;stilbene and metal ion chelating pockets. The synthesis, characterization, and metal chelation ability for [Cu2+ and Zn2+] are presented herein. Furthermore, we explored their multifunctionality w.r.t. to their (i) recognition of A&#946; aggregates and monomeric form, (ii) utility in modulating the aggregation pathways of both metal&#8208;free and metal&#8208;bound amyloid&#8208;&#946;, (iii) ex&#8208;vivo staining of amyloid plaques in 5xFAD mice brain sections, (iv) ability to scavenge free radicals and (v) ability to inhibit cholinesterase activity. Molecular docking studies were also performed with A&#946; peptides and acetylcholinesterase enzyme to understand the observed inhibitory effect on activity. Overall, the studies presented here establish the multifunctional nature of these molecules and qualify them as promising candidates for furthermore investigation in the quest for finding Alzheimer's disease treatment.

         <title>Mild&#8208;Temperature Catalyzed Hydrosilylation for Simplified Carbohydrate Functionalization of Porous Silicon Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 2, January 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A one&#8208;pot hydrosilylation strategy is developed for the functionalization of porous silicon nanoparticles (PSiNPs) with allyl&#8208;tetra&#8208;O&#8208;acetyl&#8208;&#946;&#8208;D&#8208;glucopyranoside (ATAG), using mild temperatures and ethylaluminium dichloride solution (EtAlCl2) as a catalyst. This efficient method reduces reaction times for passivating and bioengineering PSiNPs, enhancing their stability and potential for biomedical applications.







Abstract
Porous silicon is one of the most explored nanostructured materials in various biomedical applications owing to its remarkable properties. However, its inherent chemical instability mandates a robust surface modification procedure, and proper surface bioengineering is essential to ensure its effectiveness in the biomedical field. In this study, we introduce a one&#8208;pot functionalization strategy that simultaneously stabilizes porous silicon nanoparticles and decorates their surface with carbohydrates through hydrosilylation chemistry, combining mild temperatures and a Lewis acid catalyst. This approach yielded a surface functionalization degree of 300&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1 in just 4&#8197;hours at 60&#8201;&#176;C, significantly reducing both the prolonged reaction times and high temperatures typically associated with conventional hydrosilylation. Furthermore, this advancement opens the way for utilizing thermolabile molecules useful for surface bioengineering.

Paving the way for interface&#8208;enhanced catalysis at the gas&#8211;liquid interface, the platinum bis&#8208;N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene complex with polyethylene glycol and alkyl side chains trans&#8208;[Pt(mPEG3C8Im)2Cl2] is presented. Angle&#8208;resolved X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy reveals pronounced interface accumulation of this complex in solutions of (mPEGn)&#8208;substituted, imidazolium&#8208;based ionic liquids. Solution NMR experiments unveil that two isomers, trans&#8208;syn and trans&#8208;anti, exist in a temperature&#8208;dependent equilibrium.







Abstract
We present the preparation and investigation of a fluorine&#8208;free surface&#8208;active bis&#8208;N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) platinum(II) complex &#8212; trans&#8208;[Pt(mPEG3C8Im)2Cl2] &#8212; for interface&#8208;enhanced supported ionic liquid phase (SILP) catalysis within a group of (mPEGn)&#8208;substituted ionic liquids (ILs) ([(mPEGn)2Im][A] ILs). The complex was characterized by means of single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (scXRD) analysis and multinuclear (1H, 13C, 195Pt) NMR spectroscopy, indicating the presence of two almost equimolar syn&#8211;anti&#8208;rotamers of the square&#8208;planar complex in solution. Angle&#8208;resolved X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (ARXPS) revealed pronounced interface&#8208;accumulation of trans&#8208;[Pt(mPEG3C8Im)2Cl2] in IL solutions of [(mPEG2)2Im][A] (A&#8722;=I&#8722; and PF6&#8722;).

         <title>A Novel Methacryloyl&#8211;Masked NIR Fluorescent Probe for Detection of Cysteine and Its Application in Bioimaging</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 2, January 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report the NIR fluorescent probe SNC&#8208;Cys that allows Cys detection. It is a highly sensitive and selective fluorescent probe that detects Cys based on the ICT photo mechanism. The probe works through Michael addition. SNC&#8208;Cys was successfully employed in the endogenous and exogenous imaging of Cys in living cells with good cell permeability.







Abstract
Cysteine (Cys) detection is recognized as an essential element in this investigation due to the critical function of Cys in several physiological processes in living organisms. A new NIR fluorescent probe SNC&#8211;Cys has been synthesized by incorporating a five&#8208;membered malononitrile derivatized ring as an electron withdrawing group, and a methacryloyl group detection moiety for cysteine. After adding Cys, SNC&#8211;Cys shows an emission of 654&#8197;nm and further works as a &#8220;Turn&#8211;on&#8221; probe via ICT photomechanism. SNC&#8211;Cys has high sensitivity and selectivity for Cys (LOD=0.46&#8197;&#956;M) and can discriminate it from other closely related amino acids, molecules with structural similarity, and in some cases very close functional group likeness. Thus, these results allow the effective imaging of Cys in living A549 cells which indicates good cell permeability and high applicability in live cell imaging. This study anticipates that SNC&#8211;Cys could be an aid in the detection of Cys&#8211;relevant diseases.

         <title>Interface Engineering of Flower&#8208;like Co2P/WO3&#8722;x/Carbon Cloth Catalysts with Oxygen Vacancies for Efficient Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 2, January 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We prepared the flower&#8208;like cobalt phosphide and tungsten oxide self&#8208;supported electrocatalyst (Co2P/WO3&#8722;x/CC) with oxygen vacancies. In 1.0&#8197;M KOH solution, the Co2P/WO3&#8722;x/CC catalyst exhibits excellent OER activity, achieving a low overpotential of only 254&#8197;mV at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and a Tafel slope as small as 58.32&#8197;mV&#8201;dec&#8722;1. Moreover, it maintains good stability over 100&#8197;hours.







Abstract
The Constructing an efficient and low&#8208;cost oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalyst is critical for improving the performance of electrolysis in alkaline water. In this study, a self&#8208;supported electrocatalyst of flower&#8208;like cobalt phosphide and tungsten oxide (Co2P/WO3&#8722;x/CC) was prepared on carbon cloth (CC) surface by hydrothermal reaction with solution immersion etching and phosphorization annealing under H2/Ar atmosphere. This strategy can generate oxygen vacancies (OV), improving the speed of charge transfer between cobalt phosphide (Co2P) and tungsten oxide (WO3&#8722;x) components. The catalyst greatly increases the electrochemical active surface area, which is beneficial for efficient oxygen evolution. Electrochemical testing studies show that in 1.0&#8197;M KOH solution, Co2P&#8211;WO3&#8722;x/CC catalyst exhibits good OER activity, with a low overpotential of 254&#8197;mV at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, a small Tafel slope of 58.32&#8197;mV&#8201;dec&#8722;1. The synergistic effect of oxygen vacancies and Co2P with WO3&#8722;x can regulate electronic structures, expose more active sites, and cooperatively enhancing the OER activity. This study provides a workable strategy for preparing efficient non&#8208;noble metal OER electrocatalysts on engineered interfaces and OV.

         <title>A Superior Ionic Conducting Plastic Crystal Near Room Temperature with Electrical Bistability and Magnetic Transition</title>

An ion plastic crystal exhibits superionic conduction near room temperature, and the crystal&#8208;to&#8208;plastic crystal transformation results in bistability in both magnetic and electric properties.







Abstract
Multifunctional ionic plastic crystals (IPCs) are a class of unique materials that exhibit a wide range of advanced applications. In this work, we proposed a strategy for the design of multifunctional, superior ion&#8208;conducting IPCs with bistability in both magnetic and electric properties, moreover, we successfully prepared and thoroughly characterized such an IPC, [PMPyr][Ni(mnt)2] (1; PMPyr+=N&#8208;propyl&#8208;N&#8208;methylpyrrolidinium, and mnt2&#8722;=maleonitriledithiolate). Plastic crystal 1 exhibits superior ion conduction near room temperature, and its ion conductivity reaches the order of 10&#8722;2&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 373&#8197;K. Remarkably, the crystal&#8208;to&#8208;plastic crystal transformation results in 1 simultaneously exhibiting electrical bistability and magnetic transition. Our study paves the way for the development of new IPCs with desirable functional properties.

         <title>Overcoming the Challenges of Hyperpolarizing Substrates with Parahydrogen&#8208;Induced Polarization in an MRI System</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 2, January 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The parahydrogen&#8208;derived 13C hyperpolarization can be generated with high field polarization transfer sequences. We attempt to circumvent the need for a dedicated polarizer by using the MRI system to produce the substrate. We study the experimental conditions imposed by the MRI setup and mitigate these effects via simulations and experiments and reach hyperpolarization levels of 44.5&#8201;% of the 1&#8208;13C site of ethyl acetate&#8208;d6.







Abstract
Hyperpolarization of 13C nuclei in biomolecules and their administration as imaging agents enables in&#8208;vivo monitoring of metabolism. This approach has demonstrated potential for deriving imaging biomarkers for cancer detection, differentiation, and therapy efficacy assessment. The in&#8197;situ generation of polarized substrates using a permanent addition of parahydrogen to an unsaturated precursor inside the bore of an MRI system used for subsequent imaging circumvents the need for a dedicated external polarizer. This approach reduces polarization loss associated with sample transfer, minimizes hardware requirements and cost, and results in reduced spatial requirements. However, performing INEPT&#8208;like pulsed sequences for heteronuclear spin&#8208;order transfer in the bore of an MRI system is challenged by poor uniformity of static and excitation magnetic field and molecular convection during the polarization transfer. Therefore, here we characterize these effects, implement a robust modification to the pulse sequence, and measure experimentally the polarization improvement upon modification of the sequence. After rigorous optimization of the parameters, we obtained a 13C polarization of 44.5&#8201;% for 50&#8197;mM of the 1&#8208;13C site of ethyl acetate&#8208;d6. Our parahydrogen&#8208;induced polarization approach enhances the accessibility to hyperpolarized MRI, circumventing the need for an external polarizer.

After rigorous optimization of the parameters, we obtained a &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C polarization of 44.5&#8201;% for 50&#8197;mM of the 1-&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C site of ethyl acetate-d&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;. Our parahydrogen-induced polarization approach enhances the accessibility to hyperpolarized MRI, circumventing the need for an external polarizer.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Catalytic Activity of Cellulose&#8208;Supported Platinum and Palladium Nanoparticles for Allylbenzene Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 2, January 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Platinum or palladium nanoparticles were immobilized on cellulose using a colloidal deposition method and their catalytic performance for the hydrogenation of allylbenzene was investigated. Compared to the commercial catalyst, the activities are higher, while the stability of the catalysts immobilized on cellulose was better for the platinum nanoparticles.







Abstract
Platinum and palladium nanoparticles were successfully deposited on tunicate cellulose via the photodeposition or microemulsion deposition method. Evenly distributed, small and narrow&#8208;sized particles in the range of 2&#8211;3&#8197;nm were obtained for microemulsion&#8208;prepared cellulose catalysts. The photodeposition method led to larger particle sizes, broader size distribution, and occasional agglomerations. The catalysts were tested in the allylbenzene hydrogenation reaction at room temperature and the results were compared to commercially available catalysts. Because of smaller particles, both microemulsion&#8208;prepared catalysts and photodeposited ones show better activity than commercial catalysts. Even platinum and palladium nanoparticles were active for the hydrogenation, only cellulose&#8208;supported platinum nanoparticles showed good stability. For palladium nanoparticles, stronger leaching from the surface of cellulose was observed. Cellulose&#8208;supported catalysts were recycled, and reusability is comparable to commercial catalysts. Therefore, cellulose could be used as an alternative catalyst support.

         <title>Odorant Binding Proteins Facilitate the Gas&#8208;Phase Uptake of Odorants Through the Nasal Mucus</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 2, January 9, 2025. </description>

Conformational freedom. Porcine odorant binding protein mimics the gas phase environment of carvone by lowering the energy barrier of interconversion between different conformational states. A multi&#8208;scale computational approach reveals the driving force that allows OBPs to facilitate the transport of hydrophobic odorants through the hydrophilic mucus.







Abstract
Mammalian odorant binding proteins (OBPs) have long been suggested to transport hydrophobic odorant molecules through the aqueous environment of the nasal mucus. While the function of OBPs as odorant transporters is supported by their hydrophobic beta&#8208;barrel structure, no rationale has been provided on why and how these proteins facilitate the uptake of odorants from the gas phase. Here, a multi&#8208;scale computational approach validated through available high&#8208;resolution spectroscopy experiments reveals that the conformational space explored by carvone inside the binding cavity of porcine OBP (pOBP) is much closer to the gas than the aqueous phase, and that pOBP effectively manages to transport odorants by lowering the free energy barrier of odorant uptake. Understanding such perireceptor events is crucial to fully unravel the molecular processes underlying the olfactory sense and move towards the development of protein&#8208;based biomimetic sensor units that can serve as artificial noses.

         <title>Role of Secondary Structure and Time&#8208;Dependent Binding on Disruption of Phthalocyanine Aggregates by Guanine&#8208;Rich Nucleic Acids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 2, January 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The binding of guanine&#8208;rich nucleic acids to a water&#8208;soluble cationic, regiopure zinc phthalocyanine (1) is reported. In contrast to double&#8208;stranded DNA, guanine systems GpG, (GpG)10, poly(G) and quadruplex DNA effectively disrupt phthalocyanine aggregates to disperse the monomeric state. Time&#8208;dependent binding is observed for all systems, especially poly(G). Such biomacromolecule interactions are expected to be important when rationalizing the photoactivity of phthalocyanines in&#8208;vivo.







Abstract
Phthalocyanines are versatile photodynamic therapy agents whose biological activity depends on their aggregation state, which is expected to be influenced by binding to biomolecules. Here, guanine&#8208;rich nucleic acid binding of a water&#8208;soluble cationic, regiopure C4h zinc phthalocyanine bearing four triethylene glycol methyl ether and four N&#8208;methyl&#8208;4&#8208;pyridinium substituents (1) is reported. In contrast to double&#8208;stranded DNA, guanine systems GpG, (GG)10, poly(G) and quadruplex DNA are shown to effectively disrupt phthalocyanine aggregates in buffered solution. This process is accompanied by evolution of the Q&#8208;band absorbance and enhanced emission. Increasing the sequence length from GpG to (GG)10 increases the binding and confirms the importance of multiple binding interactions. Enhanced binding in the presence of KCl suggests the importance of nucleobase hydrogen&#8208;bonded mosaics in phthalocyanine binding. Notably, the (GT)10 sequence is even more effective than quadruplex and pure guanine systems at disrupting the aggregates of 1. Significant time&#8208;dependent binding of 1 with poly(G) reveals biexponential binding over minutes and hours, which is linked to local conformations of poly(G) that accommodate monomers of 1 over time. The study highlights the ability of biomacromolecules to disrupt phthalocyanines aggregates over time, which is an important consideration when rationalizing photoactivity of photosensitizers in&#8208;vivo.

         <title>A {Cr4Ln2} Complex with Exchange Coupled {Cr2} Units: Structural Description and Magnetic Study</title>

         <dc:description>
We report a novel {Cr4Ln2}, core with exchange coupled {Cr2} units (Ln = Gd and Dy) where Ln = Dy shows SMM behaviour at zero external field.







Abstract
We have prepared and structurally characterized pivalate based {CrIII4LnIII2} complexes with Ln = Dy and Gd as well as the Y analogue, with the overall formula [CrIII4LnIII2(mdea)2(piv)10(OH)4], Ln = Gd, Dy and Y. We are reporting a detailed experimental magnetic properties study, including magnetization relaxation dynamics and calorimetric data, supported with quantum chemical calculations. The synthesis of the Y derivative, allowed to precisely identify the Cr(III)&#8208;Cr(III) exchange interaction magnitude which proved moderately strong and in agreement with known magneto&#8208;structural correlations. This result agrees with the observed double bridged {Cr2&#8208;&#956;OH&#8208;&#956;OR} units within the {Cr4Ln2} complexes. The Gd(III) complex magnetic properties can be properly described with the already established exchange coupled {Cr2} units, and a unique Gd(III)&#8208;Cr(III) exchange coupling parameter which proved anti&#8208;ferromagnetic in nature. The MCE characterization of this complex based on magnetization and calorimetric data down to 2&#8197;K affords a moderate entropy change value, mainly affected by the strong Cr&#8208;Cr exchange interaction. The complex with Ln = Dy, showed SMM behaviour below 10&#8197;K under 0 DC applied field with negligible field dependence up to 3000&#8197;Oe and 10&#8197;kHz of AC field frequency. Two relaxation processes are clearly distinguished, with thermal barriers for an Orbach mechanism of ca. 20&#8197;cm&#8722;1 and 40&#8197;cm&#8722;1.

         <title>N&#8208;Heterocycle&#8208;Substituted Hexa&#8208;peri&#8208;Hexabenzocoronenes with Windmill Architectures</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 2, January 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The microwave&#8208;assisted substitution reaction of fluorinated HBC derivatives provided switchable N&#8208;heterocyclic HBCs with windmill architectures in a straightforward fashion. The formation of metastable conformers was observed experimentally and investigated by computational analysis. Additionally, the electronic effect of different electron&#8208;donating N&#8208;heterocyclic substituents on the HBC core was investigated experimentally and by density&#8208;functional theory (DFT) calculations.







Abstract
We describe the synthesis and computational investigation of N&#8208;heterocycle&#8208;substituted hexa&#8208;peri&#8208;hexabenzocoronenes (HBCs). Following our method for the preparation of thioether&#8208;substituted HBCs, we prepared pyrrole&#8208;, indole&#8208;, carbazole&#8208;, and 1H&#8208;benz[g]indole&#8208;substituted HBCs from the corresponding fluorinated precursors under microwave irradiation. A series of polysubstituted benzoindole&#8208;HBCs with windmill architectures was also synthesized using the polyfluorinated HBC analogs, and the substituent effects on the electronic properties of the HBC core were investigated. Similar to the thioether substituted HBCs, the nature of the heterocycle does not influence the optoelectronic properties of the HBC core. The attachment of multiple benzoindole substituents leads to a bathochromic shift of the absorption and emission spectra, comparable to our previous studies. Due to the circular arrangement of the benzoindole moiety, the attachment of multiple substituents results in the presence of multiple conformers at room temperature. The rotation barrier can be overcome by heating the compounds to 323&#8211;333&#8197;K. Additionally, the investigation of the relaxed geometries shows two &#960;&#8208;stacking motifs within the conformers.

         <title>Distance&#8208;Dependent Symmetry&#8208;Breaking Charge Transfer in 9,10&#8208; Bis(phenylethynyl)anthracene Dimers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 2, January 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This paper investigates the role of through&#8208;bond coupling strength in modulating symmetry&#8208;breaking charge separation (SB&#8208;CS) dynamics within anthracene dimers of varying inter&#8208;chromophore distances. Utilizing both steady&#8208;state and transient spectroscopy, we uncover the significance of strong electronic coupling in facilitating SB&#8208;CS, particularly under weakly polar solvent conditions, with direct implications for enhancing photoelectric device performance.







Abstract
To investigate the effect of the through&#8208;bond coupling strength on the symmetry&#8208;breaking charge separation (SB&#8208;CS) dynamics and mechanism, three 9,10&#8208;bis((4&#8208;hexylphenyl)ethynyl)anthracene dimers with varying distances, viz., a single&#8208;bond linked dimer (0&#8208;dimer), a phenylene linked dimer (1&#8208;dimer) and a para&#8208;biphenylene linked dimer (2&#8208;dimer), were synthesized and studied systematically using steady&#8208;state and transient spectroscopy. Steady&#8208;state absorption spectra revealed that the electronic coupling strength decreased gradually with the increase of the inter&#8208;chromophore distance, and the transition of S0&#8594;S1 includes the dark charge transfer (CT) excitation. fs&#8208;TA spectra demonstrated that SB&#8208;CS could be conducted in both weakly and highly polar solvents for 0&#8208;dimer, but the SB&#8208;CS dynamics has a significant difference. In weakly polar solvents, SB&#8208;CS only produces the partial CT (PCT) state, but it could generate the CT state via the PCT state in highly polar solvent. In comparison, SB&#8208;CS is only proceeded in highly polar solvents in 1&#8208;dimer and 2&#8208;dimer to produce the CT state directly. These results demonstrate that the SB&#8208;CS dynamics is strongly dependent on the inter&#8208;chromophore electronic coupling, and the relatively strong electronic coupling is crucial for the occurrence of SB&#8208;CS in weakly polar environment that is commonly presented in photoelectric devices.

         <title>Triflyl [18F]Fluoride as a Solution for Base&#8208;Sensitive Late&#8208;Stage Nucleophilic Aromatic 18F&#8208;Fluorination Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 2, January 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, we present the late&#8208;stage nucleophilic 18F&#8208;fluorination of (hetero)aryls under low&#8208;base conditions using triflyl [18F]fluoride. This method avoids the application of base and cryptand and enabled the efficient radiolabeling of a broad scope of (hetero)arenes and the successful production of clinical doses of [18F]mFBG, [18F]SynVesT&#8208;1 and [18F]FPEB in improved radiochemical yields (RCY) and/or shorter preparation times.







Abstract
Fluorine&#8208;18 is the predominant radionuclide used to label Positron Emission Tomography (PET) tracers. One outstanding challenge in nucleophilic aromatic radiofluorination reactions is the sensitivity of precursors and catalysts for basic reaction conditions, which are necessary for the work&#8208;up of [18F]fluoride, resulting in limited reproducibility. Triflyl [18F]fluoride is a new [18F]fluoride source that allows freedom in choice of type and amounts of base and cryptand. The aim of the current work is to explore the scope and limitations of triflyl [18F]fluoride in the late&#8208;stage nucleophilic aromatic 18F&#8208;fluorination of various functionalized precursors, exploring reduced amounts of base and cryptand. The assessment allowed for the application of this new nucleophilic [18F]fluoride reagent to the successful radiosynthesis of boron, stannane, hypervalent iodonium ylide and phenol substrates bearing electron&#8208;deficient, &#8208;neutral and &#8208;rich functional groups as well as the clinically relevant PET tracers [18F]FPEB, [18F]mFBG and [18F]SynVesT&#8208;1.

         <title>Parts&#8208;Per&#8208;Million Level Loading Cyclometalated Ru(II)&#8208;NHC Catalyzed Selective Oxidation of Olefins to Carbonyls</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 2, January 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Imidazo[1,5&#8208;a]quinoxaline&#8208;based cyclometalated ruthenium complex&#8208;catalyzed selective oxidative scission of olefins to carbonyls is reported. Complex shows high catalytic activity and a long lifetime. Protocol is compatible with a wide range of substrate including biomass, natural products, sugar, amino acids, and fatty acid&#8208;derived compounds. The use of the by&#8208;product NaIO3 in the catalytic efficiency is disclosed for the first time.







Abstract
Oxidative cleavage of olefins is a useful reaction in organic synthesis. The most well&#8208;known catalytic system is the osmium based Lemieux&#8208;Johnson catalyst, which generally requires high catalyst loading and tends to suffer from rapid overoxidation to produce the acid predominantly. Hence, the development of a mild, general, and selective method toward the oxidative cleavage of alkenes to carbonyl compounds is highly desired. In this work, a highly efficient ruthenium&#8208;based catalyst for olefin oxidation has been demonstrated by employing a fused &#960;&#8208;conjugated imidazo[1,5&#8208;a]quinoxaline (ImQx) based NHC ligand with bidentate C(carbanion)&#8201;CNHC motif. Strong C&#8208;donor ligands, paired with a rigid backbone and ruthenium redox activity, provided exceptionally high catalytic activity and a long lifetime for olefin oxidation. Complex showed high catalytic activity and a long lifetime, TONs are several million. The catalyst tolerates numerous functional groups and can be applicable to challenging biomass, natural products, sugar, amino acids, and fatty acid&#8208;derived substrates. Based on kinetic studies, thermodynamic activation parameters, and DFT study, the mechanistic finding demonstrated that [3+2] cycloaddition reaction is the key step in the oxidation process. The use of the by&#8208;product NaIO3 in the catalytic efficiency has been disclosed for the first time.

         <title>Bimetallic MIL&#8208;88/Polyaniline Hybrid Hollow Structure: In&#8208;situ Synthesis and Enhanced Oxygen Evolution Reaction at High Current Densities</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 2, January 9, 2025. </description>

In this study, a bimetallic iron&#8208;cobalt phytic acid complex loaded with polyaniline hollow structure (FCP@PAn) was constructed, via a progress of selective etching and surface modification in one step without high&#8208;temperature phosphating or carbonization. The FCP@PAn displayed high catalytic activity and stability at high current densities.







Abstract
Developing oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts in an efficient strategy, while maintaining high catalytic activity and stability under high current densities, remains a crucial problem. In this study, a bimetallic iron&#8208;cobalt phytic acid complex loaded with polyaniline hollow structure (FCP@PAn) was successfully constructed, via a progress of selective etching and surface modification in one step without high&#8208;temperature phosphating or carbonization. The as&#8208;obtained FCP@PAn required only 329 and 385&#8197;mV overpotentials at high current densities of 500 and 1000&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, respectively, due to phytic acid and polyaniline incorporation and the coordinated effect of each component. Additionally, the FCP@PAn exhibited the lowest Tafel slope values of 44.6&#8197;mV&#8201;dec&#8722;1 and was able to continuously operate for 120&#8197;h at 500&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, displaying high catalytic activity and stability. Hence, the hollow structure of the conductive polymer and MOFs composites provided a new surface modification strategy for transition metal&#8208;based catalysts that are prone to dissolution or corrosion during the OER process, as well as for high current density applications.

         <title>Expanding the Toolset of Biomolecular NMR with Efficient and Cost&#8208;Effective 17O&#8208;Labeling via Bacterial Expression</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 2, January 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work introduces a cost&#8208;effective method for amino acid&#8208;specific 17O&#8208;labeling of recombinant proteins using a bacterial expression system and rapid 17O&#8208;labeled amino acid synthesis. Successful 17O labeling is demonstrated in proteins like CrgA and FtsQ. This approach broadens access to 17O&#8208;NMR, enabling deeper insights into protein biophysics and biochemistry.







Abstract
Oxygen plays a central role in biomolecular structures and functions, with 17O&#8197;NMR emerging as a powerful tool for elucidating biomolecular properties. However, the low natural abundance of the NMR&#8208;active isotope, 17O (0.0373&#8201;%), presents a significant hurdle to its widespread application. Here, we introduce a rapid and cost&#8208;effective approach for amino acid&#8208;specific 17O&#8208;labeling of recombinant proteins. Using a common bacterial expression system and with a 30&#8208;minute rapid synthesis protocol of 17O&#8208;labeled amino acids via mechanochemical saponification, we have generated Leu&#8208; and Phe&#8208;specific 17O&#8208;labeled recombinant proteins derived from diverse organisms, including CrgA and FtsQ from Mycobacterium tuberculosis and E protein from SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 virus, demonstrating the applicability of our technique for amino acids known to be isotopically labeled without scrambling. We have acquired magic&#8208;angle&#8208;spinning 17O&#8197;NMR of these proteins to confirm the successful 17O labeling and illustrate the sensitivity of 17O&#8197;NMR to the protein's local structural environments. Our work significantly broadens the accessibility of 17O&#8208;NMR, empowering researchers to delve deeper into protein biophysics and biochemistry. This approach opens new avenues for understanding cellular processes at the molecular level by providing an effective tool for investigating oxygen&#8208;related interactions and chemistry within biomolecules.

         <title>Tailoring ORR Activity in Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C Catalysts through Phosphorus Incorporation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 2, January 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C catalysts, doped with phosphorus, show improved ORR activity. Fe&#8208;NPC catalyst exhibits high metal loading, excellent ORR performance (onset potential of 1.00&#8197;V, half&#8208;wave potential of 0.864&#8197;V), and promising application in Zn&#8208;air batteries (758.8&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1Zn). DFT calculations reveal that phosphorus enhances O2 activation and reduces the energy barrier for the rate&#8208;determining step.







Abstract
Atomically dispersed iron and nitrogen co&#8208;doped carbon materials (Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C) represent promising non&#8208;precious metal catalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), offering potential alternatives to noble metal&#8208;based benchmarks. In our study, we investigated the influence of phosphorus doping on the catalytic activity of Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C. The experimental research demonstrate that the doping of phosphorus significantly enhances the ORR activity. Specifically, the resulting Fe&#8208;NPC exhibits high metal loading and excellent ORR activity in 0.1&#8197;M KOH with an onset potential of 1.00&#8197;V and a half&#8208;wave potential of 0.864&#8197;V. Density functional theory (DFT) simulations reveal that phosphorus improves the electrocatalytic activity by activating O2 molecules and reducing the energy barrier (the hydrogenation reaction *OH&#8594;H2O) of the rate&#8208;determining step. Furthermore, Fe&#8208;NPC exhibits promising application prospects as an air cathode in Zn&#8208;air batteries, delivering a high maximum discharge power density of 180.3&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and outstanding discharge specific capacity (758.8&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1Zn) at a discharge current density of 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2.

         <title>Unveiling the Long&#8208;Awaited Aldehyde Intermediate in Oxidative Dephosphorylation: A Unique Approach to Access Useful Carboxaldehydes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 2, January 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This is the first report to trap and isolate aldehyde intermediate from oxidative dephosphorylation reactions that typically generate symmetrically substituted alkenes from organophosphonates. Thus, a unique synthetic strategy has been developed to access structurally diverse aldehydes by oxidizing phosphonate carbanions using molecular oxygen.







Abstract
Oxidative dephosphorylation reactions usually generate symmetrically substituted alkenes from organophosphonates. Even the ubiquitous presence of oxygen can produce such alkenes inadvertently as a side product in small amounts from Wittig/Horner&#8208;Wadsworth&#8208;Emmons (HWE) reactions. So far, aldehydes have been expected to be the on&#8208;pathway intermediate since their discovery, but there was no substantial experimental evidence to support this. Herein, aldehyde intermediates are judiciously trapped before forming alkene on dephosphorylation reactions of diverse phosphonates. Consequently, a unique synthetic strategy has been established to access structurally diverse aldehydes by oxidizing phosphonate carbanions using molecular oxygen. This is the first report to trap and isolate aldehydes since the historical discovery of Wittig/HWE reactions. Only ketone/amide was isolated as a support, but no aldehyde. The optimization studies offer 48&#8211;84&#8201;% reaction yields of such aldehydes. The mechanistic studies are validated with reaction mixture 1H and 31P&#8208;NMR studies. Along with other various aldehydes, a unique class of structurally diverse anthracenyl aldehydes exhibiting intense fluorescence has been identified. The extended process to bis&#8208;phosphonates led to bis&#8208;carboxaldehyde forming in 52&#8211;68&#8201;% yield within 30&#8197;min. The scope is further extended to achieve 2,1,3&#8208;benzothiadiazole&#8208;linked phosphonate, functionalized with carboxaldehyde.

         <title>Diels&#8208;Alder Reactivity of Triisopropylsilyl Ethynyl Substituted Acenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 2, January 9, 2025. </description>

The Diels&#8208;Alder reaction of TIPS&#8208;Pen as diene with a number of different dienophiles was examined &#8211; the Diels&#8208;Alder reactivity of TIPS&#8208;Pen has not been investigated yet. The lateral size of the dienophile and the dispersion interaction between dienophile and diene are responsible for the unusual regioselectivity of cyclohexene&#8208;based dienophiles with TIPS&#8208;pentacene.







Abstract
We investigated the Diels&#8208;Alder reaction of 6,13&#8208;bis(triisopropylsilylethynyl)pentacene (1) with small dienophiles such as (bridged) dihydronaphthalenes/cyclohexenes that yielded adducts at the central ring, the other dienophiles predominantly or exclusively attacked the unsubstituted off&#8208;center ring. The difference in regioselectivity was investigated by DFT calculations. Apart from dispersion interactions, it is due to the steric demand of the dienophiles, which need to fit in between the silylethynyl substituents to react at the central ring. Epoxynaphthalene adducts of 1 as well as its anthracene and tetracene congeners were deoxygenated, easily furnishing triarenobarrelenes with TIPS&#8208;ethynyl substituents at the bridgeheads, attractive building blocks for porous solids and higher acene&#8208;based trimers.

         <title>B12&#8208;Catalyzed Carbonylation of Carbon Tetrahalides: Using a Broad Range of Visible Light to Access Diverse Carbonyl Compounds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 2, January 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven carbonylation of CCl4, CBr4, and CBr3F have been developed using a B12&#8722;Mg2+/TiO2 hybrid catalyst. This method enables the selective synthesis of carbonyl molecules, including ureas, carbamates, carbonate esters, and carbamoyl fluorides, under mild conditions. The reaction mechanism involves SN2 and single&#8208;electron transfer, driven by broad&#8208;range visible light. This study highlights a general platform for green and sustainable photocatalytic carbonylation reactions, extending to low&#8208;energy red&#8208;light applications.







Abstract
Visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven organic synthesis is a green and sustainable method for producing fine chemicals and is highly desirable at both laboratory and industrial scales. In this study, we developed a broad&#8208;range (including the red region) visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven carbonylation of CCl4, CBr4, and CBr3F with nucleophiles, such as amines and alcohols, using a B12&#8722;Mg2+/TiO2 hybrid catalyst. Carbonyl molecules such as ureas, carbamates, carbonate esters, and carbamoyl fluorides were synthesized with high selectivity and efficiency under mild conditions. Diffuse reflectance UV&#8208;vis spectroscopy, femtosecond time&#8208;resolved diffuse reflectance spectroscopy, and density functional theory calculations revealed the reaction mechanism is a combination of SN2 and single&#8208;electron transfer. This is a rare example of a low&#8208;energy, red&#8208;light&#8208;driven photocatalysis, which has been a highly desired organic reaction in recent years. We believe that this study provides a general platform to access diverse carbonyl molecules and could promote photocatalytic carbonylation reactions on a pilot scale.

         <title>Cyclic Ruthenium(II)&#8722;Halocarbon Complexes Derived from Ru(II)&#8208;Induced Cyclization of Homopropargylic Halopyridines: Mechanism, Bonding and Reactivity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 2, January 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cyclic metal&#8722;haloquinolizine complexes derived from the cyclization of homopropargylic halopyridines on Ru(II) and Os(II) centers display unusual metal&#8722;halocarbon bonding interactions and reactivity. Unprecedented &#954;2(X,C)&#8208;haloquinolizinium (X=F, Cl, and Br) ligated Ru(II) complexes were synthesized via Ru(II)&#8208;promoted rearrangement and cyclization of homopropargylic halopyridines. These cyclic Ru(II)&#8722;halocarbon complexes, featuring rare M&#8722;X&#8722;R bonding interactions, undergo nucleophilic aromatic substitution to yield quinolizinium&#8208;fused metallaoxazole complex. This work highlights the importance of metal&#8722;halocarbon bonding interactions in catalytic and coordination design.







Abstract
The activation of various homopropargylic pyridines by cis&#8208;[RuII/OsII(dppm)2Cl2] (dppm=1,1&#8208;bis(diphenylphosphino)methane) has previously been shown to generate a diverse array of metallacycles and metalated heterocyclic complexes. However, a minor structural modification of introducing a halide onto the pyridyl group of the alkyne substrate resulted in the formation of unprecedented Ru(II)/Os(II)&#8722;haloquinolizine complexes. These complexes display (1) &#954;2(X,C)&#8208;haloquinolizine chelates arising from the cycloisomerization of HC&#8801;CC(OH)(CH2(6&#8208;X&#8208;2&#8208;py))(Ph) on [RuII/OsII(dppm)2]2+ moieties via a vinylidene pathway, (2) five&#8208;membered Ru/Os&#8722;X&#8722;C&#8722;N&#8722;C rings (X=F, Cl, Br) ortho&#8208; and peri&#8208;fused to quinolizinium skeletons, and (3) uncommon M&#8722;X&#8722;R bonding interactions that are atypical in coordination complexes. Despite being divalent and integrated into a five&#8208;membered Ru&#8722;X&#8722;C&#8722;N&#8722;C ring system, the X atoms in the Ru(II) complexes are susceptible to substitution by O in the presence of &#8722;OH, resulting in the formation of quinolizinium&#8208;fused ruthenaoxazole complexes. Overall, this work highlights the importance of considering metal&#8722;halocarbon bonding interactions in catalytic or coordination designs.

         <title>N&#8208;P Type Charge Compensatory Synergistic Effect for Schottky and Efficient Photoelectrocatalysis Applications: Doping Mechanism in (Nb/Re)@WS2/Graphene Heterojunctions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 2, January 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Proposed N&#8722;P type valence electron compensation mechanism to eliminate impurity levels introduced by heteroatoms doping. Synergistic enhancement of photogenerated carrier separation efficiency and migration ability through the combination of isoelectronic doping and heterojunction. Provided a new idea for the design and development of Schottky devices and efficient photoelectrocatalysis based on 2D TMDs.







Abstract
Band gap engineering based on doped two&#8208;dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) has shown great potential in the design and development of new nano photoelectronic devices and their application in photoelectrocatalysis. However, there are two key issues that are difficult to take into account, namely the impurity levels induced by dopant atoms appear in the forbidden band of the doping system, which can become the recombination center of photogenerated carriers, thereby reducing the photocatalytic efficiency. Compared with the carrier mobility of the corresponding doped systems, that of intrinsic 2D TMDs is too low. Understanding the doping mechanism of heteroatoms in these systems and designing corresponding crystal structures rationally is important for solving these problems. In this study, the crystal structures of co&#8208;doped monolayer WS2 with Nb and Re atoms were designed using density functional theory, and doping systems with graphene (high carrier mobility) were assembled into a heterostructure using the concept of heterorecombination. The N&#8208;P type co&#8208;doping of Nb and Re atoms retained the continuous band characteristics of the original monolayer WS2 while also providing the high carrier mobility of graphene, yielding an excellent multipurpose material for manufacturing high&#8208;speed Schottky devices and efficient water&#8208;splitting H evolution catalysts.

         <title>Remarkable Effect of Stereoisomerism on the Am(III)/Ln(III) Solvent Extraction. New Ligands for Highly Efficient Separation of Americium</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 2, January 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
DAPhen ligands with chiral carbon atoms in amide substituents selectively extract Am(III) from strongly acidic media reaching SFAm(III)/La(III) values of 140. DAm(III) is nearly an order of magnitude higher for individual meso&#8208;forms. An abrupt increase in extraction efficiency from La(III) to Lu(III) is a result of formation of unusual L2M2 or even L4M5 ionic complexes of heavy lanthanides.







Abstract
Two novel 1,10&#8208;phenanthroline&#8208;2,9&#8208;diamide ligands were constructed on the basis of 2&#8208;phenylpyrrolidine and obtained as pure diastereomers. These ligands demonstrated advanced properties in liquid&#8208;liquid extraction tests. They revealed high efficiency of americium(III) extraction alongside with the record values of selectivity in the separation of americium from light lanthanides from strongly acidic media. An abrupt increase of extraction efficiency when moving along the lanthanide series from lanthanum to lutetium was observed. The examination of the extraction behavior of pure diastereomeric forms revealed noticeable differences in their selectivity while maintaining the overall extraction trend. The explanation of the discovered patterns was elucidated by a comprehensive study of the ability of the ligands to bind lanthanide nitrates in solutions. All the data collected (UV&#8208;vis and NMR titration, X&#8208;ray analysis of resulting complexes, solvation numbers estimation) were supported by quantum chemical calculation. These data clearly indicated that in the case of light lanthanides the formation of 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 complexes is most preferable. At the same time, complexes with heavy lanthanides, such as ytterbium and lutetium, exist as ionic pairs which may consist of [L2M]z+ cations counterbalanced by metallate anions, which may result in the formation of the species of unusual composition like L2M2 or even L4M5 clusters.

         <title>Front Cover: B12&#8208;Catalyzed Carbonylation of Carbon Tetrahalides: Using a Broad Range of Visible Light to Access Diverse Carbonyl Compounds (Chem. Eur. J. 2/2025)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 2, January 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A B12&#8208;Mg2+/TiO2 hybrid catalyst enables visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven carbonylation of carbon tetrahalides, including CCl4, CBr4, and CBr3F. Photo&#8208;induced CoI species engage with the carbon tetrahalides to generate phosgene derivatives, which subsequently react in situ with nucleophiles to produce ureas, carbonate esters, carbamates and carbamoyl fluorides. This study highlights a general platform for green and sustainable photocatalytic carbonylation reactions. More information can be found in the Research Article by H. Shimakoshi and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202403663).

A WS2/graphene heterostructure co&#8208;doped with Nb and Re was designed by using an N&#8208;P valence&#8208;electron&#8208;compensation strategy. This structure avoids the impurity levels introduced by single atom doping, making it an ideal next&#8208;generation Schottky device and photo&#8208;electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution material.

Cyclization of homopropargylic halopyridines on RuII/OsII centers leads to the formation of cyclic Ru&#8211;/Os&#8211;halocarbon complexes with rare M&#8722;X&#8722;R bonding interactions, where the metal center acts as a &#8220;molecular homewrecker&#8221; to pull the halogen atom from the pyridyl ring. This interaction highlights the importance of metal&#8211;halocarbon bonds in catalytic and coordination design. More details are available in the Research Article by C.&#8208;Y. Wong and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202403736).

Electrodes based on or modified with carbon dots (CDs) in sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) have shown significant improvements in key performance metrics. This review summarizes recent developments, challenges, and opportunities in leveraging CDs as additives in SIBs, focusing on their impact on electrolyte properties, electrode materials, and overall battery performance and several sound perspectives are also rationally proposed for fundamental research and practical development as guidelines.







Abstract
Carbon dots (CDs), known for their quantum size, abundant surface functional groups, excellent biocompatibility, and non&#8208;toxicity, have emerged as promising candidates for enhancing various advanced rechargeable batteries. Recent research indicates that electrodes based on or modified with CDs in sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) have shown significant improvements in key performance metrics such as Coulombic efficiency, cycle life, and capacity compared to traditional electrodes. Several key impacts of CDs contribute to these enhancements, including increased conductivity due to their conductive graphitized core, rich absorption sites, and excellent dispersity facilitated by abundant surface functional groups. These features accelerate ion transport through interface edges and ion diffusion paths, inhibit electrode material dissolution, buffer electrode material volume expansion, ensure electrode uniformity and stability, and promote the electrochemical reaction process between the electrode and electrolyte. This review summarizes recent developments, challenges, and opportunities in leveraging CDs as additives in SIBs, focusing on their impact on electrolyte properties, electrode materials, and overall battery performance. It provides a comprehensive understanding of the potential of CDs to significantly advance SIB technology.

         <title>Fluorine Labeling and 19F NMR Spectroscopy to Study Biological Molecules and Molecular Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 2, January 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In recent years, 19F NMR spectroscopy has been increasingly used to answer scientific objectives of biological relevance. Developments in labeling strategies have made it possible to produce fluorine&#8208;labeled proteins site&#8208;specifically with reasonable efforts. In this review, different labeling strategies and a variety of scientific objectives to which 19F NMR spectroscopy has significantly contributed are presented.







Abstract
High&#8208;resolution nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy represents a key methodology for studying biomolecules and their interplay with other molecules. Recent developments in labeling strategies have made it possible to incorporate fluorine into proteins and peptides reliably, with manageable efforts and, importantly, in a highly site&#8208;specific manner. Paired with its excellent NMR spectroscopic properties and absence in most biological systems, fluorine has enabled scientists to investigate a rather wide range of scientific objectives, including protein folding, protein dynamics and drug discovery. Furthermore, NMR spectroscopic experiments can be conducted in complex environments, such as cell lysate or directly inside living cells. This review presents selected studies demonstrating how 19F NMR spectroscopic approaches enable to contribute to the understanding of biomolecular processes. Thereby the focus has been set to labeling strategies available and specific NMR experiments performed to answer the underlying scientific objective.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 2, January 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mushroom is a rich source of enzymes and therefore is a promising biocatalyst for organic synthesis. This review highlights key advances in mushroom&#8208;mediated redox reactions using whole cells, purified enzymes or recombinant enzymes, including the reduction of carbonyl compounds and carboxylic acids, oxidation of C&#8722;H bonds, epoxidation of olefins and oxidative cleavage of alkenes.







Abstract
The application of biocatalysts in organic synthesis has grown significantly in recent years, and both academia and industry are continuously searching for novel biocatalysts capable of performing challenging chemical reactions. Mushrooms are a rich source of ligninolytic and secondary metabolite biosynthetic enzymes, and therefore were considered promising biocatalysts for organic synthesis. This review focuses on the broad utilization potential of mushroom&#8208;based biocatalysts and highlights key advances in mushroom&#8208;mediated redox reactions. It mainly includes the reduction of ketones and carboxylic acids, hydroxylation of aromatic and aliphatic compounds, epoxidation of olefins, oxidative cleavage of alkenes, and other uncommon reactions catalyzed by the whole cells or purified enzymes of mushroom origin. Overall, a comprehensive overview of the applications of mushrooms as biocatalysts in organic synthesis is provided, which puts this versatile microorganism in the spotlight of further research.

         <title>Advances in Pyridine C&#8722;H Functionalizations: Beyond C2 Selectivity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 2, January 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Several advanced strategies for C3&#8722; and C4&#8722; selective C&#8722;H functionalization of pyridines have been developed, offering numerous benefits that were challenging with traditional methods. This review emphasizes the advantages and limitations of latest advancements in meta and para&#8208;C&#8722;H functionalization of pyridines through various approaches, including pyridine phosphonium salts, photocatalytic methods, temporary de&#8208;aromatization, Minisci&#8208;type reactions, and transition metal&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H activation techniques.







Abstract
The pyridine core is a crucial component in numerous FDA&#8208;approved drugs and Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulated agrochemicals. It also plays a significant role in ligands for transition metals, alkaloids, catalysts, and various organic materials with diverse properties, making it one of the most important structural frameworks. However, despite its significance, direct and selective functionalization of pyridine is still relatively underdeveloped due to its electron&#8208;deficient nature and the strong coordinating ability of nitrogen. Among the variety of synthetic transformation, direct functionalization of C&#8722;H bond is straightforward and atom economical approach and it's advantageous for late&#8208;stage functionalization of pyridine containing drugs. In recent years, innovative strategies for regioselective C&#8722;H functionalization of pyridines and azines have emerged, offering numerous benefits such as high regioselectivity, mild conditions, and enabling transformations that were challenging with traditional methods. This review emphasizes the latest advancements in meta and para&#8208;C&#8722;H functionalization of pyridines through various approaches, including pyridine phosphonium salts, photocatalytic methods, temporary de&#8208;aromatization, Minisci&#8208;type reactions, and transition metal&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H activation techniques. We discuss the advantages and limitations of these current methods and aim to inspire further progress in this significant field.

The intricate interplay of metabolic reactions and molecular assembly in living systems enables spatiotemporally organization and gives rise to diverse dynamic behaviors that characterize life. Over the last decades, research efforts have increasingly focused on replicating the remarkable properties and characteristics of living systems, driving the rapid growth of systems chemistry. This young discipline which generally studies interacting molecular networks and emergent system&#8208;level properties, behaviors, and functions, offers new concepts and tools to tackle the complexity of life. In this review paper, we have explored seminal research and recent advancements in recreating dynamic behaviors of life with systems chemistry. We believe that the recreation of the dynamic behaviors of life through systems chemistry would set the initial steps to obtain synthetic life de novo.

         <title>&#960;&#8208;mers and &#960;&#8208;dimers: Two Radical Supramolecular Interactions &#8211; A Tutorial Review</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 2, January 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
&#960;&#8208;mers and &#960;&#8208;dimers are two radical interactions being easily confused on account of their similarities. This tutorial review introduces i) a clear definition of each interaction, ii) their main physico&#8208;chemical differences observable by major analytical techniques (X&#8208;Ray, UV/Vis/NIR, EPR, NMR and electrochemistry), iii) some of their thermodynamic features, and iii) examples showing strategies to enhance their stability (using a covalent spacer, a confined environment and mechanical bonds).







Abstract
In this review, the difference between &#960;&#8208;mers (pimers) and &#960;&#8208;dimers (pi&#8208;dimers) will be discussed. Often interchanged or confused in the literature, these two radical interactions lead to different or even opposite physico&#8208;chemical behaviors. This review aims at clarifying the terms &#960;&#8208;mers and &#960;&#8208;dimers and at describing their main physico&#8208;chemical properties to address their differences. Finally, selected literature examples exhibiting the successive formation of &#960;&#8208;mers and &#960;&#8208;dimers within the same systems will be detailed to emphasize the physico&#8208;chemical changes occurring upon conversion.

         <title>pH Controlled Transient Cyclization of Peptides for Increased Stability towards Oral Delivery</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Oral delivery of peptides is challenged by low bioavailability. Here, pH responsive linearization of cyclic peptides is described as a strategy for transient protection of peptides to extend their half&#8208;life in model systems. Peptides were cyclized to increase their stability at the low pH in the stomach, while they linearize at neutral pH. This led to PYY3&#8208;36 analogues with pH responsive linearization for increased stability.







Abstract
Peptides are highly efficient for treatment of many diseases, especially in oncology and diabetes. Oral delivery of peptides is desirable, but is challenged by low bioavailability and new chemical methods to enable oral delivery are needed. Here, we developed pH responsive linearization as a strategy for transient protection of peptides to extend their half&#8208;life in model systems. Peptides were cyclized to increase their stability at the low pH in the stomach, while they linearize at neutral pH to form the active peptide. We developed ester based responsive linkers with a protonable amine for O&#8208;to&#8208;N acyl shift, which allowed linearization strategies based on pyroglutamoyl (pGlu) or diketopiperazine (DKP) formation. After coupling of the linker, peptides were cyclized by CuAAC. We studied the stability against simulated gastric fluid (SGF) at different pH and the ability of cyclic peptides to linearize. This led to PYY3&#8211;36 analogues with pH responsive linearization for increased stability.

         <title>Facile and Regioselective Deuteration of C2&#8208;Alkylated Imidazolium Salts in the Presence of Cesium Carbonate</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
C2&#8208;alkylated imidazolium salts are readily and regioselectively deuterated on their C2&#945; exocyclic position and/or C4=C5 heterocyclic backbone using D2O, a cheap, non&#8208;toxic deuterium source, and Cs2CO3, a weak, innocuous, inorganic base. This simple and efficient procedure eases the access to valuable isotopomers of compounds that are widely employed as bioactive molecules, ionic liquids, organocatalysts, and carbene ligand precursors.







Abstract
Thirteen imidazolium iodides bearing benzyl, mesityl, or 2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl substituents on their nitrogen atoms, and C1&#8211;C4 alkyl chains on their C2 carbon atom were readily deuterated with D2O as a cheap and non&#8208;toxic deuterium source in the presence of Cs2CO3, a weak, innocuous, inorganic base. The isotopic exchange proceeded quickly and efficiently under mild, aerobic conditions to afford a range of aNHC and NHO precursors regioselectively labeled on their C2&#945; exocyclic position and/or C4=C5 heterocyclic backbone. A &#8220;carbene&#8208;free&#8221; mechanism was postulated, in which the carbonate anion acts as a catalyst to activate an exocyclic, acidic C&#8722;H bond and ease a deuterium transfer from D2O to the imidazolium salt in a concerted fashion.

         <title>Optoelectronic Properties and Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging Application of Donor&#8208;Acceptor Dyads Derived From 2,6&#8208;DicarboxyBODIPY</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We synthesized BODIPY dyes with benzyl ester and carboxylic acid groups, showing charge transfer, polarity&#8208;dependent triplet state formation, and pH&#8208;dependent emission. Fluorescence lifetime microscopy revealed distinct lifetime gradients in colon cancer cells and pig enteroids. These results highlight the potential of heavy&#8208;atom&#8208;free BODIPYs as fluorescent probes for cancer and stem cell imaging.







Abstract
Donor&#8208;acceptor BODIPY dyads, functionalized at the 2 and 6 positions with benzyl ester (BDP&#8208;DE) or carboxylic acid (BDP&#8208;DA) groups, were synthesized, and their optoelectronic properties were investigated. Carbonyl groups were found to increase the reduction potential of the BODIPY core by 0.15&#8211;0.4&#8197;eV compared to regular alkyl&#8208;substituted BODIPYs. These compounds exhibited efficient intramolecular charge separation and triplet state formation through the spin&#8208;orbit charge transfer intersystem crossing (SOCT&#8208;ISC) process, achieving singlet oxygen quantum yields of up to 92&#8201;%, depending on the solvent polarity. Notably, the fluorescence and singlet oxygen generation of BDP&#8208;DAs were found to depend on the ionization state of the carboxylic groups. Time&#8208;resolved fluorescence measurements revealed that complexation of BDP&#8208;DAs with bovine serum albumine (BSA) significantly extended their excited state lifetimes. Fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) studies of human colorectal carcinoma (HCT116) cells and pig small intestinal organoids (enteroids) provided insights into subcellular localization. The diacid with 2,4&#8208;dimethoxyphenyl group at the meso&#8208;position (DA1) displayed longer lifetimes in lipid&#8208;droplet&#8208;like structures and shorter lifetimes in cytoplasmic regions. The diacid containing a meso&#8208;anthracenyl group (DA2) formed &#8242;islands&#8217; in cell monolayers, exhibiting a distinct lifetime gradient from the periphery to the center. These results highlight the potential of donor&#8208;acceptor BODIPYs as fluorescent probes for biological imaging, particularly in revealing subtle differences in cellular environments.

A porous structural Ru&#8208;MCOF acts as a microreactor with a nanoconfinement effect, accelerating co&#8208;reactant diffusion and promoting ECL emitter excitation. Combined with dual DNAzymes&#8208;driven catalytic hairpin amplification, an ECL immunosensor was constructed for sensitive cTnI detection with high sensitivity and accuracy. The high&#8208;stable Ru&#8208;MCOF opens a new approach for the exploitation of MCOF&#8208;based luminophores for early clinical diagnosis.







Abstract
Currently, metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) with tunability and covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with high stability are promising nanomaterials for electrochemiluminescence (ECL), while Ru&#8208;based metal covalent organic frameworks (Ru&#8208;MCOFs) have rarely been reported. Herein, an ECL immunosensor based on a strong ECL&#8208;emitting Ru&#8208;MCOF was proposed for the sensitive detection of the cardiac troponin&#8208;I (cTnI). Imine&#8208;linked Ru&#8208;MCOF was prepared as an ECL emitter via solvothermal method using tris (4,4&#8242; &#8208;diamino&#8208;2,2&#8242; &#8208;bipyridine) ruthenium (II) (Ru(dbpy)32+) as a precursor. Compared with monomers, the imine&#8208;linked Ru&#8208;MCOF achieved structural extension through covalent bonds, which not only effectively facilitated the electrochemical activation of the luminophores, but also shortened the transmission distance between electrons and co&#8208;reactants, generating significant ECL emission. In addition, the porous Ru&#8208;MCOF provided a microreactor with nanoconfinement effect, which could accelerate the diffusion of co&#8208;reactants into the framework and promote the excitation of internal and external ECL emitters, significantly enhancing the ECL intensity. Considering the excellent ECL performance of Ru&#8208;MCOF, combined with dual DNAzymes&#8208;driven catalytic hairpin amplification, the ECL immunosensor achieved sensitive detection of cTnI with a detection limit as low as 0.42&#8197;fg/mL. The proposed highly stable Ru&#8208;MCOF raises a new approach for exploring MCOF&#8208;based luminophores, highlighting the potential of MCOFs in advanced ECL emitters.

         <title>Reversible Metal&#8208;Mediated Molecular Switching of a Phosphaethene Polyaromatic Hydrocarbon</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The light&#8208;triggered isomerization of truxene&#8208;based phosphaalkene Z&#8208;P1 gives approx. 15&#8201;% E&#8208;isomer in the photostationary state. In contrast, gold (I) coordination affords the selective inversion of the phosphaalkene stereochemistry yielding quantitatively [AuCl(E&#8208;P1)]







Abstract
This experimental and theoretical study illustrates how phosphaalkenes, which are isolobal to alkenes, can utilize a variety of external triggers for molecular switching. The E/Z isomerization of a truxene&#8208;based phosphaalkene, i.&#8201;e. TruxC=P&#8208;Mes* (Mes*=2,4,6&#8208;tris&#8208;t&#8208;butyl&#8208;benzene), is accomplished by irradiation, metal coordination, or deprotonation of the truxene core. The reversible and quantitative Z/E double bond isomerization by gold(I) coordination/decoordination of the phosphorous lone pair represents a novel fuelling strategy for molecular switches.

         <title>Luminescence and Generation of Reactive Oxygen Species in Solution by Ta6Br12 Clusters</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work unprecedently reveals the NIR&#8208;II photoluminescence of {Ta6Br12}2+ cluster complexes dissolved in water and deuterated water, with lifetimes ranging from nanoseconds to microseconds. DFT calculations indicate that the emission is mainly associated with fluorescence transitions. Reaction with O&#8322; promotes partial quenching of the luminescence and the generation of peroxide and superoxide radical species.







Abstract
An intrinsic metal cluster NIR&#8208;II emission of the {Ta6Br12}2+ aqua/hydroxocomplexes was determined in aqueous solutions under inert atmosphere. The photoluminescence (PL) is enhanced in D2O, and the lifetime scale expands from nanoseconds to microseconds. Possible cluster emission transitions have been assigned and analyzed from a computational perspective. In the presence of O2, the cluster compound kept its robustness but showed partial quenching of the PL. Stern&#8208;Volmer and laser&#8208;flash photolysis studies confirmed that quenching is mainly associated with O2 diffusion. Laser&#8208;flash photolysis experiments showed that singlet oxygen (1O2) was not detected under measurement conditions. Generation of peroxide and superoxide radical species after irradiation in D2O was confirmed by using luminol as a probe, whereas no hydroxide radical species were detected as evidenced by the emission of the 3&#8208;coumarin carboxylic acid (3&#8208;CCA) molecular sensor.

         <title>Exploring the Metal&#8208;Centered Reactivity of Isomeric, N&#8208;Bridged Biscyclometalated Platinum(II) Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The field of platinum chemistry is ubiquitous in the research of anticancer drugs and new OLED materials. Within the vast library of existing compounds, the majority of work focuses on complexes in the +2 and +4 oxidation states, with comparatively few examples of PtIII complexes reported without bridging ligands. PtIII complexes with metal&#8208;metal bonding can be made by mild oxidation of PtII complexes having bis(phenylpyridine) ligands. Here, we report the synthesis and characterization of two new PtII complexes bearing tetradentate N&#8208;bridged bis(phenylpyridine) ligands with N^C*C^N and C^N*N^C coordinating atoms. Through chemical oxidation with PhICl2 and N&#8208;chlorosuccinimide, we obtained four new complexes containing PtIV and PtIII centres. The dynamics of the PtIII complexes were explored by variable&#8208;temperature NMR studies and showed surprisingly free rotation of the appended N&#8208;aryl group. This work uncovers the importance of the destabilizing nature of the bulky N&#8208;aryl group on intermetallic bonds, and sheds light on how the molecular rotation observed in the PtIII compounds could inspire new molecular rotors driven by intermetallic bonds.</dc:description>

         <title>Microbial&#8208;induced Synthesis of nano NiFe LDH for High&#8208;efficiency Oxygen Evolution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>NiFe layered double hydroxide (LDH) currently are the most efficient catalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline environments. However, the development of high&#8208;performance low cost OER electrocatalysts using straightforward strategies remains a significant challenge. In this study, we describe an innovative microbial mineralization&#8208;based method for in situ&#8208;induced preparation of NiFe LDH nanosheets loaded on nickel foam and demonstrate that this material serves as an efficient oxygen evolution electrocatalyst. In the microbial mineralization process, bacteria adhere to electrode materials and promote the surface nucleation of nanomaterials when metal ions are present. Specifically, our findings indicate that biomineralization accelerates the formation and regulation of NiFe LDH. The new electrocatalyst displays excellent OER performance, with a small overpotential of 220 mV at 10 mA cm&#8722;2 and a Tafel slope down to 38.6 mV dec&#8722;1 in alkaline solution. The remarkable OER performance of the microbial mineralization&#8208;derived electrocatalyst is attributed to the synergistic effect of NiFe LDH and a bacterial&#8208;specific surface area that contains multiple active sites. This study has uncovered a new approach for the assembly of NiFe LDH that relies on biomineralization to bring about morphological and structural modification of LDH nanosheets.</dc:description>

         <title>Aqueous Binder with Self&#8208;Emulsifying Characteristics for Practical Si/C Anode in Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Silicon/carbon (Si/C) materials have achieved commercial applications as a solution to the problems of large volume expansion and short lifespan of silicon&#8208;based anodes in lithium&#8208;ion batteries. However, the potential risk of structural fracture and localized differences in surface adsorption properties lead to difficulties in maintaining the structural integrity of Si/C anodes using conventional binders during repeated lithiation/delithiation. Herein, an aqueous binder (PVA&#8208;g&#8208;M) based on polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) grafted methacrylic acid (MAA) obtained by self&#8208;emulsifyingemulsion polymerization is reported. The introduction of carboxyl groups of MAA enables PVA&#8208;g&#8208;M to form more hydrogen bonds, thereby enhancing both the cohesion of the binder film and its adhesion to silicon&#8208;based surface. Simultaneously, the methyl&#8208;containing segments of MAA can wet the carbon&#8208;based surface, thereby enhancing the adhesion of PVA&#8208;g&#8208;M to carbonaceous materials. In addition, the hydroxyl groups on both the PVA segments and the silicon surface can be esterified with the carboxyl groups during the heat treatment, thus further improving the bonding strength. As&#8208;prepared Si/C anodes with PVA&#8208;g&#8208;M binder can significantly inhibit the electrode volume expansion and maintain high structural integrity during cycling as well as form SEIs with high lithium fluoride content, showing excellent cycling stability (81.1% capacity retention after 300 cycles).</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Silicon/carbon (Si/C) materials have achieved commercial applications as a solution to the problems of large volume expansion and short lifespan of silicon-based anodes in lithium-ion batteries. However, the potential risk of structural fracture and localized differences in surface adsorption properties lead to difficulties in maintaining the structural integrity of Si/C anodes using conventional binders during repeated lithiation/delithiation. Herein, an aqueous binder (PVA-g-M) based on polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) grafted methacrylic acid (MAA) obtained by self-emulsifyingemulsion polymerization is reported. The introduction of carboxyl groups of MAA enables PVA-g-M to form more hydrogen bonds, thereby enhancing both the cohesion of the binder film and its adhesion to silicon-based surface. Simultaneously, the methyl-containing segments of MAA can wet the carbon-based surface, thereby enhancing the adhesion of PVA-g-M to carbonaceous materials. In addition, the hydroxyl groups on both the PVA segments and the silicon surface can be esterified with the carboxyl groups during the heat treatment, thus further improving the bonding strength. As-prepared Si/C anodes with PVA-g-M binder can significantly inhibit the electrode volume expansion and maintain high structural integrity during cycling as well as form SEIs with high lithium fluoride content, showing excellent cycling stability (81.1% capacity retention after 300 cycles).&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Mechanochemical Deracemization: A Sustainable Approach to Enantiopurity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mechanochemical deracemization (MCDR) is presented as a new, general and sustainable approach to obtain enantiomerically pure compounds. By combining ball milling with deracemization, various functionalities such as ketones, isoindolinones, imines, esters and even an inorganic compound are successfully deracemized. High enantiomeric excesses (ee) are achieved, while reaction time is reduced by up to 97&#8201;% and solvent consumption by up to 100&#8201;%.







Abstract
We introduce mechanochemical deracemization (MCDR) as a novel strategy for obtaining enantiopure compounds. This study demonstrates the successful transposition of six archetypical deracemization reactions from a solvent&#8208;based to a solvent&#8208;minimized ball milling environment. The scope includes a ketone, isoindolinones, imines, an ester, and an inorganic compound, all of which deracemized successfully. Key parameters such as milling material, ball number and size, the use of a bulk material and liquid&#8208;assisted grinding (LAG) were systematically investigated, revealing their crucial role. Quantitative enantiomeric excesses (ee) were achieved, while reaction times were reduced by up to 97&#8201;% and solvent consumption by as much as 100&#8201;%. This work establishes MCDR as a versatile, sustainable pathway to enantiopure compounds. By highlighting the generalizability of this approach and its huge potential for minimizing waste, this study provides the foundation for future advancements in mechanochemical deracemization.

         <title>Covalent Organic Frameworks for Photocatalytic Hydrogen Peroxide Evolution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
&#932;his Review presents a comprehensive overview of the very recent developments on COF&#8208;based photocatalysts for H2O2 evolution. First, neat COFs with variable architecture are critically explored, followed by the presentation of the most promising hybrid COF&#8208;based heterojunctions. Several structure&#8208;activity aspects affecting the photocatalytic performance of these materials is thoroughly discussed.







Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are considered advanced class materials due to their exotic structural and optical properties. The abundance of starting monomers with variable linkage motifs may give rise to multiple conformations in either 2D or 3D fashion. Tailoring of the abovementioned properties has facilitated the application of COFs in a wide range of applications, which are strongly correlated with energy conversion schemes. Having a crystalline porous character and a large set of donor&#8208;acceptor combinations, COFs are expected to make huge impact in photocatalytic processes. In this Review, we present the recent advances in the development of semiconducting COF&#8208;based systems towards the photocatalytic hydrogen peroxide evolution. An overview is given about the effect of various parameters on the photocatalytic performance, such as charge transfer tuning, wettability by chemical functionalization, topology, porosity and crystallinity. Various challenges are discussed, and constructive insights are given for the development of highly functional COF&#8208;based photocatalysts for H2O2 evolution.

         <title>Synthesis and Properties of Donor&#8211;Acceptor&#8208;Type Cyclobisbiphenylenecarbonyls</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cyclobisbiphenylenecarbonyl (CBBC) represents a readily available figure&#8208;eight molecule. Herein, we prepared ten donor&#8211;acceptor&#8208;type CBBC derivatives with changing the donor substituents and their substituent positions to systematically investigate the structure&#8211;property relationship. The functionalization of the para&#8208;positions of the carbonyl groups resulted in better tunability of emission colors rather than meta&#8208;functionalization, whose color variation ranges from light blue to red.







Abstract
The scalable synthesis of figure&#8208;eight &#960;&#8208;systems is challenging for the conventional bottom&#8208;up approach. We have recently reported that the oxidative inner&#8208;bond cleavage of commercially available dibenzo[g,p]chrysene efficiently furnishes a figure&#8208;eight &#960;&#8208;acceptor, cyclobisbiphenylenecarbonyl (CBBC), in large quantity. Furthermore, its donor&#8211;acceptor&#8208;type derivative with four N&#8208;carbazolyl substituents at the meta&#8208;positions of the carbonyl groups exhibited thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) and circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) with a high |gCPL| value of 1.0&#215;10&#8722;2. Herein, we synthesized nine donor&#8211;acceptor&#8208;type CBBC derivatives by changing the donor substituents and their positions. Compared to previously reported carbazole&#8208;substituted CBBC, tetramethylcarbazole&#8208; and 9,10&#8208;dihydro&#8208;9,9&#8208;dimethylacridine&#8208;substituted derivatives exhibited enhanced emission quantum yields and accelerated reverse intersystem crossing. The functionalization of the para&#8208;positions of the carbonyl groups resulted in better tunability of emission colors rather than meta&#8208;functionalization, whose color variation ranges from light blue to red. The incorporation of bulky substituents at the meta&#8208;positions of the carbonyl groups induced the conformational change to a distorted ring structure. Investigation of the substituent effect on the chiroptical properties revealed that the introduction of less bulky donor units such as carbazole at the meta&#8208;positions of the carbonyl groups is effective in achieving high |gCPL| values.

         <title>Recent Applications of Pillararene&#8208;Inspired Water&#8208;Soluble Hosts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pillararenes has emerged as versatile and efficient tools for molecular recognition and assembly. Moreover, the design and synthesis of novel macrocycles with distinctive structures and properties can unleash new opportunities for supramolecular chemistry. This review highlights recent advances in novel pillararene&#8208;inspired water&#8208;soluble macrocyclic hosts including their molecular recognition and applications in functional material, catalysis and biomedicine.







Abstract
Pillararenes and their derivatives have emerged in supramolecular chemistry as unique macrocycles for applications in host&#8211;guest chemistry, materials science and biomimetics. Many variations have been conceived and synthesized in recent years and in this review, we relate progress in water&#8208;soluble versions: leaning towerarenes, extended&#8208;pillararenes, biphenarenes, helicarenes and octopusarenes. These are applied in targeted drug delivery, selective uptake and release of aromatic guests, fabrication of gold/silver and mesoporous silica nanoparticles, cell imaging, pollutant separation, biomedicine (e.&#8201;g. biofilm disruptors, taste masking containers, neuromuscular blockers, antidotes for macromolecular biotoxin) and enantioselective recognition. It is intended that this review will be helpful for research in synthetic macrocyclic chemistry and supramolecular functional systems, leading to practical applications in various research areas.

         <title>The Missing Link in the Monogermanide Series: YbGe</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
With the synthesis of YbGe under high&#8208;pressure high&#8208;temperature conditions, the series of binary rare&#8208;earth monogermanides is completed. The compound crystallizes in a FeB&#8208;type structure, such as the representatives La&#8722;Pr, and Lu. Despite the absence of &#8220;excess&#8221; electrons, 4&#8208;atomic Yb4 basins were found, with an increasing formation tendency as Yb&#8810;Lu&lt;La.







Abstract
High&#8208;pressure, high&#8208;temperature synthesis at 12&#8197;GPa between 750 and 1000&#8201;&#176;C for 30 to 300&#8197;min yields the last missing rare&#8208;earth metal monogermanide, YbGe. Powder and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction measurements reveal that the compound crystallizes in a FeB&#8208;type structure (space group Pnma, a=7.901(2)&#8197;&#197;, b=3.8981(9)&#8197;&#197;, and c=5.873(2)&#8197;&#197;). The results of the chemical bonding study, while supporting the presence of polyanionic Ge chains interacting with the surrounding Yb through multi&#8208;atomic polar bonds, suggest a transitional scenario between the monogermanides formed by alkaline&#8208;earth elements and those formed by trivalent rare&#8208;earth metals.

     alt="The Missing Link in the Monogermanide Series: YbGe"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the synthesis of YbGe under high-pressure high-temperature conditions, the series of binary rare-earth monogermanides is completed. The compound crystallizes in a FeB-type structure, such as the representatives La&#8722;Pr, and Lu. Despite the absence of &#8220;excess&#8221; electrons, 4-atomic Yb&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; basins were found, with an increasing formation tendency as Yb&#8810;Lu&amp;lt;La.
&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Unusual Reaction of Isocyanides with Aromatic Aldehydes Catalyzed by a Supramolecular Capsule</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The unprecedented reaction between isocyanides and electron poor aromatic aldehydes leading to the corresponding imine and carbon monoxide was disclosed to be promoted by the hexameric self&#8208;assembled resorcinarene capsule. The mechanism was elucidated considering kinetic investigation, isotopic labelling, metadynamics calculations and intermediate synthesis.







Abstract
The supramolecular resorcinarene hexameric capsule efficiently promotes the unprecedented reaction between isocyanides and electron&#8208;deficient aromatic aldehydes leading to the formation of imines and carbon monoxide. The mechanism of the reaction was investigated via isotope labelling, kinetic analysis of the reaction, computational studies and the independent synthesis of a proposed intermediate. Control experiments indicate that the formation of the key aziridinone intermediate is limited to the cavity of the capsule.

         <title>Ionic&#8208;Liquid Synthesis of Atomic Molybdenum Nitride Clusters as Bifunctional Oxygen Reduction and Evolution Reactions Electrocatalysts for Alkaline Zn&#8208;Air Battery</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Transition&#8208;metal nitrides (TMNs) have garnered considerable attention for energy conversion applications owing to their exceptional electronic structures and high catalytic activities. However, the scarcity of active sites in TMNs impedes their large&#8208;scale application. This study describes the use of wetness impregnation and ionic&#8208;liquid methods to enhance the electrocatalytic efficiency of molybdenum nitride (MoN) atomic clusters finely dispersed on nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon (MoN@NC) substrates. The as&#8208;synthesized electrocatalysts feature atomically dispersed MoN clusters, achieving an impressive onset potential of 0.93 V vs. RHE for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and maintaining an overpotential of just 295 mV at a current density of 10 mA/cm2 for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The MoN@NC&#8208;based zinc&#8211;air battery demonstrated a high&#8208;power density of 151 mW/cm2, a robust specific discharge capacity of 759 mAh/gZn at 20 mA/cm2, and superior charge&#8211;discharge cycling stability exceeding 190 cycles. The detailed experimental characterization revealed that the uniformly dispersed MoN clusters served as the primary active sites driving the observed catalytic performance. Additionally, the present findings suggested significant correlations between the phase of the material, crystallization, atomic cluster distribution, support porosity, and nitridation temperature. These insights are expected to refine strategies for achieving atomically dispersed nitrides with optimized ORR performance.</dc:description>

         <title>Influence of Asymmetrical Ligand Substitution on the Formation, Stability, and Reactivity of Ruthenium(III)&#8208;Hypochlorite Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hypohalites are commonly generated in biological systems, mostly with functions related to defense and immune system response. These hypohalites can bind to metal centers and are known for their strong oxidizing properties that play crucial roles in various biological processes. Herein, we report the synthesis, characterization and reactivity of novel biomimetic Ru(III)&#8208;hypochlorite complexes and focus the work on the electronic effects associated with the incorporation of methyl groups in a pentadentate ligand framework in an asymmetric fashion. The intermediates are stable at room temperature and were characterized by mass spectrometry, UV&#8208;vis absorption, resonance Raman and EPR spectroscopy. We show for the first time that the resultant ruthenium&#8208;hypochlorite adducts function as an electrophilic oxidant and efficiently catalyze hydrogen atom abstraction reactions from phenol and oxygen atom transfer reactions with dimethylsulfide.</dc:description>

         <title>In Vitro Selection of Collagen&#8208;Binding Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Containing Genetically Encoded Mussel&#8208;Inspired Adhesive Amino Acids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Protein immobilization technology is important in medical and industrial applications. We previously reported all&#8208;in&#8208;one in vitro selection, wherein a collagen&#8208;binding vascular endothelial growth factor (CB&#8208;VEGF) was identified from a fusion library of random and VEGF sequences. However, its interaction chemistry is mainly limited to the interaction established by the 20 canonical amino acids. Herein, we incorporated an adhesive non&#8208;natural amino acid found in marine mussels, L&#8208;3,4&#8208;dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA), into the library for all&#8208;in&#8208;one in vitro selection. After selection, we identified DOPA&#8208;containing CB&#8208;VEGF. CB&#8208;VEGF binds to collagen with an apparent dissociation constant of 2 nM; na&#239;ve VEGF does not bind to collagen. The collagen&#8208;binding peptide domain of CB&#8208;VEGF (CB&#8208;peptide) exhibited stronger binding to collagen than a mutant peptide (substitution from DOPA to tyrosine), indicating the importance of DOPA to collagen binding. The collagen&#8208;binding affinity of CB&#8208;VEGF is 10&#8208;fold higher than that of CB&#8208;peptide, suggesting that the collagen&#8208;binding ability of CB&#8208;VEGF is not due to the additive function of CB&#8208;peptide to VEGF, but is synergistic. Furthermore, increased cell growth was observed on CB&#8208;VEGF&#8208;treated collagen surfaces, not VEGF&#8208;treated collagen surfaces. Thus, integrating all&#8208;in&#8208;one in vitro selection and DOPA incorporation shows promise in generating adhesive proteins on solid supports.</dc:description>

         <title>Fluorinated&#8208;Quinoxaline Based Non&#8208;Fused Electron Acceptors Enables Efficient As&#8208;Cast Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Non&#8208;fused electron acceptors have obtained increasing curiosity in organic solar cells (OSCs) thanks to simple synthetic route and versatile chemical modification capabilities. However, non&#8208;fused acceptors with varying quinoxaline core and as&#8208;cast device have rarely been explored, and the molecular structure&#8208;photovoltaic performance relationship of such acceptors remains unclear. Herein, two non&#8208;fused acceptors L19 and L21 with thienyl substituted non&#8208;fluorinated/fluorinated quinoxaline core were developed via five&#8208;step synthesis. Compared with L19, L21 with F&#8208;containing quinoxaline exhibited higher molar extinction coefficient, boosted charge mobility, improved exciton dissociation, more ordered molecular stacking and optimized film morphology. Thereafter, a notable power conversion e&#64259;ciency (PCE) of 11.45% could be obtained for the as&#8208;cast PBDB&#8208;T:L21 &#8208;based device, which is significantly better than the device based on PBDB&#8208;T:L19 (8.68%). Furthermore, PM6:Y6:L21&#8208;based ternary devices were fabricated and exhibited the highest PCE of 17.81%.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Non-fused electron acceptors have obtained increasing curiosity in organic solar cells (OSCs) thanks to simple synthetic route and versatile chemical modification capabilities. However, non-fused acceptors with varying quinoxaline core and as-cast device have rarely been explored, and the molecular structure-photovoltaic performance relationship of such acceptors remains unclear. Herein, two non-fused acceptors L19 and L21 with thienyl substituted non-fluorinated/fluorinated quinoxaline core were developed via five-step synthesis. Compared with L19, L21 with F-containing quinoxaline exhibited higher molar extinction coefficient, boosted charge mobility, improved exciton dissociation, more ordered molecular stacking and optimized film morphology. Thereafter, a notable power conversion e&#64259;ciency (PCE) of 11.45% could be obtained for the as-cast PBDB-T:L21 -based device, which is significantly better than the device based on PBDB-T:L19 (8.68%). Furthermore, PM6:Y6:L21-based ternary devices were fabricated and exhibited the highest PCE of 17.81%. This work discloses that the introduction of electron-withdrawing fluorinated quinoxaline core and appropriate side-chain engineering can play an important role in improving the performance of as-cast solar cell devices.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Azine Dearomatization in Natural Product Total Synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Since antiquity, alkaloid natural products have served as medicinal ingredients that still contribute as an inspiration for the development of novel therapeutics. For the synthetic chemist, much of the importance of natural products lies in their acting as a forcing&#8208;function for the invention of new synthetic strategies and tactics for molecular assembly. With this rich history in mind, it remains an important goal for chemists to build nitrogenous structures with greater efficiency, abiding by economies of synthesis. Nitrogenous aromatic feedstocks have been an intriguing starting point for the functionalization and construction of alkaloids for several decades, but recent advances in reaction design have opened new doors for leveraging their abundance in concise synthesis. Herein, advances in this area of synthetic ingenuity will be summarized with the aim of instructing chemists towards considering dearomatization as a strategic avenue for both target&#8208;oriented and diversity&#8208;oriented synthetic campaigns. Overall, syntheses are evaluated, compared, and contrasted to give a systematic overview of this continued area of research.</dc:description>

         <title>Doubly Linked Azulene Dimer: A Novel Non&#8208;benzenoid Isomer of Perylene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report herein the synthesis of an unprecedented isomer of perylene, dicyclohepta[cd,fg]&#8208;as&#8208;indacene bearing two phenyl groups (1&#8208;Ph) by the nickel&#8208;mediated intramolecular homocoupling of a 4,4'&#8208;biazulene derivative (2). The X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis and theoretical calculations revealed that 1&#8208;Ph adopts a unique helically twisted geometry although the local aromaticity of azulene moieties was preserved. The double covalent linkage of the two azulene skeletons imparts significant orbital interaction, which affords near&#8208;infrared (NIR) absorption (up to 1720 nm) and remarkable redox behaviors despite its closed&#8208;shell electronic structure. The optical band gap of 1&#8208;Ph is calculated to be 0.72 eV from its absorption onset, which is one of the narrowest values among the hitherto reported air&#8208;stable non&#8208;benzenoid PAHs. Furthermore, the thin&#8208;film of 1&#8208;Ph serves as a p&#8208;type semiconductor. Our study offers fundamental insights into not only the aromaticity with the nonalternant topologies of 1&#8208;Ph but also its potential application in novel organic electronics.</dc:description>

         <title>One&#8208;dimensional Branched PdAg Nanoalloy Rich in Defects for Boosting Glycerol and Ethanol Oxidation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Abstract: The development of Pd&#8208;based bimetallic nanoalloys (NAs) with abundant active sites for achieving highly efficient electrocatalysis in alcohol oxidation deserves continuous attention. Herein, we utilized a facile visible&#8208;light&#8208;assisted liquid&#8208;phase method involving adjusting reaction time to generate active sites, successfully&#160;synthesizing&#160;one&#8208;dimensional (1D) PdAg NAs rich in defects. The optimized 1D PdAg NA exhibits remarkable electrochemical activity, stability, and antipoisonous properties in glycerol oxidation reaction (GOR) and ethanol oxidation reaction (EOR), far exceeding pure Pd and commercial Pd/C catalysts. Notably, compared to glycerol oxidation (1496 mA mg&#8208;1Pd and 4.13 mA cm&#8722;2), the optimized PdAg NA demonstrated higher mass activity (2990 mA mg&#8208;1Pd) and specific activity (7.86 mA cm&#8722;2) in ethanol oxidation. In summary, this work may provide a strategy for designing low&#8208;cost electrocatalysts enriched with defects, thereby promoting the development of high&#8208;performance alcohol oxidation reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Structural Characteristics of a Partially Planarized Triarylmethyl Cation with Unsymmetrical Push&#8211;Pull Structure</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We achieved for the first time the synthesis and isolation of the push&#8211;pull&#8208;type &#960;&#8208;cation salts with sufficient stability. The unique feature is not limited to the structure. We found that the &#960;&#8208;cation salt with planar anion exhibits panchromatic absorption in the solid state accompanying a near&#8208;infrared absorption with a &#955;onset value of 1030&#8197;nm.







Abstract
We report the physical properties of a new class of triarylmethyl&#8208;based carbocations containing both an electron&#8208;donating diphenyl ether moiety and an electron&#8208;accepting carbonyl group with a helical plane framework. Their unique packing patterns were clarified by X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis, which depend on the counter anions to influence their photophysical properties in the solid states. Notably, the interactions between &#960;&#8208;cation species and planar anion species lead to a unique panchromatic property, accompanying a near&#8208;infrared absorption with a &#955;onset value of 1030&#8197;nm, which can be assigned to intermolecular charge transfer transition. We found that the &#960;&#8208;cation species with planar anion formed cation dimers, being stacked in opposite directions. The two cation molecules are flanked by two anions on both the top and bottom side. Pair interaction energy decomposition analysis (PIEDA) calculations imply that the origins of the unique packing patterns of the &#960;&#8208;cations originate from the electrostatic forces of four neighbouring &#960;&#8208;anion species.

         <title>Exploring the Catalytic Potential of Bioinspired Taurine&#8208;Functionalized Carbon Quantum Dots as Bifunctional Catalysts for Diverse Sustainable Organic Transformations in Water</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synthesis and exploration of the catalytic potential of taurine&#8208;functionalized carbon quantum dots (Tau&#8208;CQDs) under metal&#8208;, acid&#8208;, and base&#8208;free sustainable conditions, using water as a solvent for various organic transformations, including Knoevenagel condensation, the Biginelli reaction, and the Knoevenagel&#8211;Michael cascade.







Abstract
Taurine&#8208;functionalized Carbon Quantum Dots (Tau&#8208;CQDs) were synthesized and evaluated for their catalytic potential under metal&#8208;, acid&#8208;, and base&#8208;free sustainable conditions, using water as a solvent for various organic transformations, including Knoevenagel condensation, the Biginelli reaction, and the Knoevenagel&#8211;Michael cascade. These bioinspired N, S&#8208;doped CQDs exhibit bifunctionality, acting as hydrogen bond donors and acceptors for C&#8722;C, C&#8722;N, and C&#8722;O bond formation. Comprehensive characterization of the catalyst was performed using HRTEM, PXRD, XPS, FTIR, AFM, Zeta potential, UV&#8211;Vis, and photoluminescence spectrometry. The Tau&#8208;CQDs demonstrated excellent reusability, maintaining catalytic performance over 10&#8197;cycles. Green chemistry metrics, including a low E&#8208;factor, high atom economy, and favorable PMI, CE, and RME values, highlight this approach's environmental and economic advantages. Key properties, such as high reaction yields, short reaction times, water solubility, enhanced surface functionality, non&#8208;toxicity, and mild operating conditions, underscore the broader significance of Tau&#8208;CQDs as an efficient, sustainable catalytic platform. Additionally, the simple recovery of the catalyst via filtration, without the need for further purification, enhances its practical applicability.

&lt;p&gt;Synthesis and exploration of the catalytic potential of taurine-functionalized carbon quantum dots (Tau-CQDs) under metal-, acid-, and base-free sustainable conditions, using water as a solvent for various organic transformations, including Knoevenagel condensation, the Biginelli reaction, and the Knoevenagel&#8211;Michael cascade.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taurine-functionalized Carbon Quantum Dots (Tau-CQDs) were synthesized and evaluated for their catalytic potential under metal-, acid-, and base-free sustainable conditions, using water as a solvent for various organic transformations, including Knoevenagel condensation, the Biginelli reaction, and the Knoevenagel&#8211;Michael cascade. These bioinspired N, S-doped CQDs exhibit bifunctionality, acting as hydrogen bond donors and acceptors for C&#8722;C, C&#8722;N, and C&#8722;O bond formation. Comprehensive characterization of the catalyst was performed using HRTEM, PXRD, XPS, FTIR, AFM, Zeta potential, UV&#8211;Vis, and photoluminescence spectrometry. The Tau-CQDs demonstrated excellent reusability, maintaining catalytic performance over 10&#8197;cycles. Green chemistry metrics, including a low E-factor, high atom economy, and favorable PMI, CE, and RME values, highlight this approach's environmental and economic advantages. Key properties, such as high reaction yields, short reaction times, water solubility, enhanced surface functionality, non-toxicity, and mild operating conditions, underscore the broader significance of Tau-CQDs as an efficient, sustainable catalytic platform. Additionally, the simple recovery of the catalyst via filtration, without the need for further purification, enhances its practical applicability.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Dehydrocoupling of Phosphine&#8208;Borane Adducts Under Ambient Conditions Using Aminoboranes as Hydrogen Acceptors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aminoboranes (R2N=BH2; R = Me, Et) accept hydrogen from phosphine borane adducts (PhR&#8242;PH&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;BH3; R&#8242; = H, Ph). This transfer is proposed to occur via a 6&#8208;membered transition state. Further, the reaction is driven forward by the reactivity of the product phosphinoborane, which undergoes subsequent addition polymerization or dimerization.







Abstract
We report on the reactivity of aminoboranes (R2N=BH2; R = iPr, Et, Me) with phosphine&#8208;borane adducts (PhR&#8242;PH&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;BH3; R&#8242; = H, Ph): Sufficiently sterically unencumbered aminoboranes can accept hydrogen from phosphine&#8208;borane adducts. The hydrogen transfer results in the formation of amine&#8208;borane adducts (R2NH&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;BH3) and transient phosphinoboranes (PhR&#8242;P&#8722;BH2) in&#8197;situ. These phosphinoboranes undergo subsequent reactivity to yield either polyphosphinoborane, [PhPH&#8722;BH2]n, or the linear dimer, Ph2PH&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;BH2&#8722;Ph2P&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;BH3. Unlike metal catalyzed phosphine&#8208;borane dehydrocoupling, which occurs at elevated temperatures (2&#8197;M, toluene, &#8805;100&#8201;&#176;C, &#8805;24&#8197;h), these dehydrocoupling reactions occur under ambient conditions (2&#8197;M, Et2O or C6D6, 20&#8201;&#176;C, &#8804;24&#8197;h). We performed a computational mechanistic study in which we identified that this transformation potentially occurs via a P&#8208;to&#8208;N and B&#8208;to&#8208;B hydrogen transfer through a 6&#8208;membered transition state.

         <title>High Performance of Cs2AgBiBr6 Perovskite&#8208;based Photodetectors by Adding DEAC</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lead&#8208;free double perovskites show promise in optoelectronics due to their optical and electrical properties. This study incorporates N&#8208;acetylethylenediamine (DEAC) into Cs2AgBiBr6 precursors, achieving photodetectors with detectivity up to 4.4&#215;1012 and excellent stability. Flexible devices also demonstrate 3.2&#215;1012 detectivity and durability. This work presents an effective approach for high&#8208;quality lead&#8208;free double perovskite films, extendable to other halide perovskites.







Abstract
Perovskite&#8208;based photodetectors (PDs) are broadly utilized in optical communication, non&#8208;destructive testing, and smart wearable devices due to their ability to convert light into electrical signals. However, toxicity and instability hold back their mass production and commercialization. The lead&#8208;free Cs2AgBiBr6 double perovskite film, promised to be an alternative, is fabricated by electrophoretic deposition (EPD), which compromises film quality. Herein, we improved the quality of the Cs2AgBiBr6 films and the performance of PDs by adding N&#8208;acetylethylenediamine (DEAC) to Cs2AgBiBr6 perovskite precursor for EPD, in which the ligand DEAC provides a pair of lone electrons to Bi3+, forming coordinate covalent bonds. The optimized PDs have high detectivity, up to 4.4&#215;1012&#8197;Jones, and high stability in the air. The high&#8208;performance, flexible Cs2AgBiBr6 perovskite PDs were fabricated on this basis, it also achieved the detectivity up to 3.2&#215;1012&#8197;Jones with excellent bending cycle stability. These results propose a feasible approach to improving the crystallization of double perovskite thin films by introducing ligands during the EPD process. Furthermore, they demonstrate enhanced optoelectronic performance, indicating that this method is also applicable to halide perovskites, offering an effective strategy to improve their film quality.

         <title>MOF Derived Cobalt Ferrite Cubic Rod&#8208;Like Materials for Highly Efficient Electrochemical Simultaneous Detection of Multiple Heavy Metal Ions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The MOF&#8208;derived CoFe2O4&#8208;1 material prepared by solvothermal method shows mainly a uniform cubic rod&#8208;like structure with a small amount of hexagonal structure at a Co/Fe molar ratio of 1&#8201;:&#8201;2. CoFe2O4&#8208;1/GCE exhibits excellent electrochemical detection performance in the simultaneous detection of multiple heavy metal ions (HMIs). An interaction mechanism is found to exist between HMIs when simultaneous detection.







Abstract
A series of CoFe2O4 materials derived from metal&#8208;organic framework were successfully constructed by the solvent&#8208;thermal method. The morphology of a typical sample CoFe2O4&#8208;1 was mostly in the form of a cubic rod&#8208;like structure with a size distribution of 3.2&#177;0.2&#8197;&#956;m, while a small amount of the structure presented hexagonal shape with uniform size dispersion. The XPS characterization results confirmed that the CoFe2O4&#8208;1 material contained Co3+ (Co2+/Co3+=0.98), and the redox reaction between Co2+ and Fe3+ produced more Fe2+ (Fe2+/Fe3+=1.63), leading to the production of more OV on the surface of the CoFe2O4&#8208;1 material (OV%=0.34), thereby facilitating the efficient adsorption of the efficient adsorption of heavy metal ions (HMIs). CoFe2O4&#8208;1/GCE as a typical electrode presented excellent performance for the detection of multiple HMIs. The results should be attributed to the good electrical conductivity and large electrochemically active surface area of CoFe2O4&#8208;1/GCE, accelerating the transport of ions and charges in the system. Interestingly, there are interaction mechanisms between the HMIs when performing simultaneous detection, suggesting the detection of target ions can be facilitated by adding additional ions. This study provides new research insights for the development of highly sensitive electrochemical sensors for real&#8208;time environmental monitoring.

         <title>Photoinduced Deprotection of 2&#8208;Nitrophenylneopentyl Glycol Boronates Enables Light&#8208;Triggered Polycondensation of Siloxanes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel photolabile protecting groups for boronic and borinic acids were developed based on the 2&#8208;nitrobenzyl motif. The 1&#8208;(2&#8208;nitrophenyl)neopentyl glycol (npnp) diol, easily synthesized on a gram scale, enables the formation of stable boronates. Efficient deprotection of RB(npnp) was achieved by irradiation at 365&#8197;nm, which was applied in light&#8208;triggered siloxane crosslinking.







Abstract
Various protecting groups have been developed for boronic acids, mostly based on diols. Alternatives include trifluoroborates and amine complexes, which offer easier synthesis and release under milder conditions. We present here a new strategy involving photocleavable protecting groups for boronic and borinic acids, based on the 2&#8208;nitrobenzyl motif. A screening of several 1,2&#8208; and 1,3&#8208;diols bearing a 2&#8208;nitrobenzyl group led us to identify 1&#8208;(2&#8208;nitrophenyl)neopentyl glycol (npnp) for the protection of boronic acid derivatives. This diol is easily prepared in a single step on gram scale, and the corresponding npnp boronates are stable in wet acetonitrile at 90&#8201;&#176;C for several days, and under under acidic conditions. Irradiation at 365&#8197;nm in acetonitrile allows for the controlled liberation of boronic acids in good to excellent yields, a method also applied to a dimesitylborinic ester bearing a 2&#8208;nitrobenzylalcohol moiety. 1&#8208;(2&#8208;Nitrophenyl)neopentyl glycol boronates ArB(npnp) demonstrated their utility in light&#8208;triggered siloxane crosslinking. We showed that catalysts incorporated into a polymer matrix, irradiated, and then incubated at 50&#8201;&#176;C for 7&#8197;days resulted in efficient polymerization, forming solid materials in some cases.

&lt;p&gt;Novel photolabile protecting groups for boronic and borinic acids were developed based on the 2-nitrobenzyl motif. The 1-(2-nitrophenyl)neopentyl glycol (npnp) diol, easily synthesized on a gram scale, enables the formation of stable boronates. Efficient deprotection of RB(npnp) was achieved by irradiation at 365&#8197;nm, which was applied in light-triggered siloxane crosslinking.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Various protecting groups have been developed for boronic acids, mostly based on diols. Alternatives include trifluoroborates and amine complexes, which offer easier synthesis and release under milder conditions. We present here a new strategy involving photocleavable protecting groups for boronic and borinic acids, based on the 2-nitrobenzyl motif. A screening of several 1,2- and 1,3-diols bearing a 2-nitrobenzyl group led us to identify 1-(2-nitrophenyl)neopentyl glycol (npnp) for the protection of boronic acid derivatives. This diol is easily prepared in a single step on gram scale, and the corresponding npnp boronates are stable in wet acetonitrile at 90&#8201;&#176;C for several days, and under under acidic conditions. Irradiation at 365&#8197;nm in acetonitrile allows for the controlled liberation of boronic acids in good to excellent yields, a method also applied to a dimesitylborinic ester bearing a 2-nitrobenzylalcohol moiety. 1-(2-Nitrophenyl)neopentyl glycol boronates ArB(npnp) demonstrated their utility in light-triggered siloxane crosslinking.

         <title>Water Microdroplets Promote Spontaneous Oxidation of Amino Acid&#8208; and Peptide&#8208;related Thiols to Disulfide Bonds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The TOC text: Disulfide bonds play a significant role in multiple fields. This study shows thiol groups in amino acids or peptides spontaneously form disulfide bonds in water microdroplets without catalysts or oxygen. Hydroxyl radicals, originating from water microdroplets, facilitate this process, illustrating microdroplet chemistry&#8216;s potential for efficient disulfide bond formation.







Abstract
Disulfide bonds (S&#8722;S) play a critical role in modern biochemistry, organic synthesis and prebiotic chemistry. Traditional methods for synthesizing disulfide bonds often rely on oxygen, alkali, and metal catalysts. Herein, thiol groups involved in amino acids and peptides were spontaneously converted into symmetrical and unsymmetrical disulfide bonds within water microdroplets, without the need for catalysts or oxygen, and under room temperature. Water microdroplets displayed improved selectivity for disulfide bond formation, with minimal production of other oxidative species. Mechanistic investigations revealed that hydroxyl radicals (&#8901;OH) present on the water microdroplet surface facilitated the oxidation process. Thiols were firstly oxidized to thiyl radicals (RS&#8901;), which subsequently coupled to form disulfide bonds. This study highlights the potential of microdroplet chemistry as an efficient and mild approach for constructing disulfide bonds.

A bis(triarylamine) radical cation bridged by two o&#8208;terphenylene moieties was prepared and characterized to explore the impact of the doubly &#960;&#8208;bridging on the intramolecular charge/spin transfer process in the 2&#8208;site organic mixed&#8208;valence system. Spectroscopic analyses on optically and thermally assisted intervalence charge&#8208;transfer processes revealed that the doubly &#960;&#8208;bridging enhanced the charge delocalization between two nitrogen redox&#8208;centers, whereas the electronic coupling was not so strengthened, in comparison with the singly &#960;&#8208;bridged reference compound.

         <title>Biomimetic Pseudopeptides to Decipher the Interplay between Cu and Methionine&#8208;Rich Domains in Proteins</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Methionine&#8208;rich domains, unity makes strength! Tripodal pseudopeptides mimicking individual binding sites in Met&#8208;rich domains show that the trismethionine environment is highly favorable to stabilize the Cu(I) state. The moderate affinity of a single site is however amplified by efficient statistical and dynamic binding by the many methionine residues.







Abstract
Maintaining tightly copper homeostasis is crucial for the survival of all living organisms, in particular microorganisms like bacteria. They have evolved a number of proteins to capture, transport and deliver Cu(I), while avoiding Fenton&#8208;like reactions. Some Cu proteins exhibit methionine&#8208;rich (Met&#8208;rich) domains, whose role remains elusive. In this work, we designed biomimetic compounds recapitulating the possible Cu(I) binding sites in these domains, in order to examine the parameters important for Cu(I) binding. Five different biomimetic pseudopeptides were synthesized, exhibiting either three methionines or two methionines and a third amino acid likely to be present in the Met&#8208;rich domain. The affinities for Cu(I) of these model binding sites were determined, as well as their redox properties and behavior in the presence of Cu(II). Our results highlight the importance of Met residues, and their abundance in Met&#8208;rich domains, to efficiently bind Cu(I) in the periplasmic space.

         <title>Addition and Oxidation Reactivity of a Pentacoordinate Nickelacyclobutane</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reactivity of a pentacoordinate nickelacyclobutane following addition and one&#8208;electron oxidation pathways is described. Ring&#8208;opening products are observed with substrates containing a stabilizing counteranion. Pathways leading to an oxidized nickelacyclobutane yield [2+2] cycloreversion&#8208;type products, suggesting that this pathway is accessible to oxidized nickelacyclobutanes.







Abstract
Nickelacyclobutanes are reactive intermediates in catalytic cycles including cyclopropanation and insertion reactions. The stoichiometric study of these intermediates has shown that their reactivity is highly influenced by the coordination environment of the nickel center. A pentacoordinated nickelacyclobutane embedded in a diphosphine pincer ligand has been shown to selectively undergo various reactions with exogenous ligands, including [2+2] cycloreversion and carbene transfer to an isocyanide. Herein, we investigate the reactivity of the pentacoordinated nickelacyclobutane towards addition and oxidation reactions. Addition reactions lead to ring&#8208;opening to form stable square planar Ni(II) compounds, while metal oxidation enhances [2+2] cycloreversion. DFT calculations are used to shed light on the different mechanisms.

         <title>Chemically Robust Cationic Porous Organic Polymer (POP) for Selective Detection and Removal of ReO4&#8722; as a Surrogate of Radioactive 99TcO4&#8722;</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The efficient removal of highly radioactive 99TcO4&#8722; from alkaline nuclear waste remains essential for optimizing nuclear waste management and ensuring environmental protection. This study presents a urea&#8208;rich cationic porous organic polymer that exhibits ultrafast kinetics, high adsorption capacity, exceptional selectivity, and strong potential as a sensor, highlighting its effectiveness in detecting and removing 99TcO4&#8722; from nuclear wastewater.







Abstract
The efficient removal of 99TcO4&#8722; from alkaline nuclear waste is vital for optimizing nuclear waste management and safeguarding the environment. However, current state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art sorbent materials are constrained by their inability to simultaneously achieve high alkali resistance, rapid adsorption kinetics, large adsorption capacity, and selectivity. In this study, we synthesized a urea&#8208;rich cationic porous organic polymer, IPM&#8208;403, which demonstrates exceptional chemical stability, ultrafast kinetics (~92&#8201;% removal within 30 seconds), high adsorption capacity (664&#8197;mg/g), excellent selectivity, along with multiple&#8208;cycle recyclability (up to 7&#8197;cycles), making it highly promising for the removal of ReO4&#8722; (surrogate of 99TcO4&#8722;) from nuclear wastewater. Notably, after exposure to 1&#8197;M NaOH solution for 24&#8197;hours, IPM&#8208;403 maintained a high adsorption capacity of 421.3&#8197;mg/g for ReO4&#8722;. Furthermore, IPM&#8208;403 acts as an efficient sensor for ReO4&#8722;, exhibiting a turn&#8208;on response and a detection limit as low as 78.8&#8197;ppb.

         <title>Advances in Chiral Macrocycles: Molecular Design and Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review highlights recent progress in the design and synthesis of chiral macrocycles, with a focus on their central, axial, helical, and planar chirality. These distinct chiral types impart unique structural and chiroptical properties, enabling a wide range of applications in fields such as enantioselective recognition, asymmetric catalysis, and circularly polarized luminescence.







Abstract
Chiral macrocycles have recently emerged as promising materials for enantioselective recognition, asymmetric catalysis, and circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) due to their terminal&#8208;free structure, preorganized chiral cavities, and unique host&#8208;guest and self&#8208;assembly properties. This review summarizes recent advances in the design and synthesis of chiral macrocycles with central, axial, helical, and planar chirality, each imparting distinct structural and chiroptical characteristics. We highlight key strategies for constructing these macrocycles and their applications in optoelectronic and catalytic systems. Emphasis is placed on the balance between rigidity and flexibility in macrocycle design, essential for effective molecular recognition, adaptable catalysis, and CPL. We conclude with perspectives on future opportunities, anticipating ongoing developments in chiral macrocycle research.

         <title>Experimental Spin State Determination of Iron(II) Complexes by Hirshfeld Atom Refinement</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Beyond structure correlation, the spin investigation in metal complexes is an ambiguous task. We herein present a proof of concept for the experimental determination of spin states from crystal structures by using Hirshfeld atom refinement. Relying on classical crystallographic quality indicators and residual density analysis, a novel way for the differentiation between high&#8208; and low&#8208;spin is demonstrated this way.







Abstract
In this study, we present the first experimental determination of the spin state of transition metal complexes by using Hirshfeld Atom Refinement. For the demonstration, the two iron(II) complexes, (NH4)2Fe(SO4)2 &#8901; 6 H2O and lFe(pic)3jCl2 &#8901; EtOH were investigated. The method involves the refinement using wavefunctions of different spin multiplicity and comparison against experimental diffraction data by means of refinement indicators and residual electron density. Our results show a clear distinction between high&#8208;spin and low&#8208;spin configurations, even for compounds with spin&#8208;crossover behavior. The presented work demonstrates the potential of Hirshfeld Atom Refinement for the experimental determination of spin states in transition metal complexes.

         <title>Methane to Methanol Transformation on Cu2+/H&#8208;ZSM&#8208;5 Zeolite. Characterization of Copper State and Mechanism of the Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cu&#8208;modified zeolites provide methane conversion to methanol with high selectivity under mild conditions. The activity of different possible Cu&#8208;sites for methane transformation is still under discussion. Herein, ZSM&#8208;5 zeolite has been loaded with Cu2+ cations (1.4 wt% Cu) as characterized by UV&#8211;vis DRS, EPR, EXAFS, and 1H MAS NMR. It is inferred that Cu2+ cations, attached to the cation&#8208;exchange Al&#8211;O&#8211;&#8211;Si sites of the zeolite framework, can exist in the form of either isolated or paired Cu2+ sites. The transformation of methane to methanol on these sites has been verified by the observation of the methoxy species formation using 13C MAS NMR and FTIR spectroscopy. The related mechanisms have been analyzed by DFT calculations. It is obtained that Cu2+ sites enable heterolytic C&#8211;H bond dissociation via the &#8220;alkyl&#8221; pathway resulting in methylcopper species which however are not detected experimentally due to further rapid transformation to surface methoxy species. For the paired Cu2+ sites, such reaction occurs through methyl radical formation and recombination with Si&#8211;O&#8211;&#8211;Al site. Based on the obtained data, it has been concluded that methane transformation to methanol on Cu2+ sites, having no extra&#8208;framework oxygen ligand, is possible in Cu&#8208;modified zeolites.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The unprecedent gold&#8208;catalyzed intermolecular 1,2&#8208;difunctionalization of nitriles with aryl iodides via Au(I)/Au(III) redox catalysis has been developed, providing an expedient route to the synthesis of benzoxazoles and benzimidazoles with broad substrate scope and high functional compatibility. Mechanistic investigation reveals that the Au(III)&#8208;Ar species generated via oxidative addition of o&#8208;iodophenol to MeDalphosAu+, serves as a key intermediate. Particularly and this annulation is initiated by oxidative addition, rather than the nucleophilic attack of the phenol moiety in o&#8208;iodophenol towards the nitrile.

         <title>Ce[N(SiMe3)2]3(THF)3&#8208;Catalyzed Hydroboration of CO2, Esters and Epoxides with Pinacolborane: Selective Synthesis of Methanol in Multigram Scale</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this work, we have reduced CO2 with HBpin to afford borylated methanol product selectively in ~99% yield using Ce[N(SiMe3)2]3(THF)3 as a catalyst. This led to multigram scale isolation of methanol obtained from CO2 reduction via the hydrolysis of borylated methanol, this establishes the potential of Ce[N(SiMe3)2]3(THF)3 as an efficient homogeneous catalyst for the bulk scale methanol synthesis. A practical application of this catalytic system was also shown by reducing CO2&#8208;containing motorbike exhaust efficiently and selectively. Further, C&#8210;O bond activation of esters and epoxides using HBpin and 1&#8208;2 mol% of Ce[N(SiMe3)2]3(THF)3 at 60 &#176;C afforded the borylated alcohols in good to excellent yields, which can easily be hydrolysed to the eco&#8208;friendly corresponding alcohol. The stoichiometric experiments were performed to prove the formation of in&#8208;situ generated cerium hydride [Ce]&#8208;H as an active catalyst.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;Unsaturated Carbonyl Compounds via Cu/TEMPO/O2 Aerobic Catalytic System</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An N,N,N&#8208;type Cu(&#8545;) complex&#8208;catalyzed desaturation method for converting alcohols, ketones, lactones, and lactams to their &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated carbonyl compounds is reported. The dehydrogenation reaction can be conducted with a green terminal oxidant O2 without requiring strong acid/base or stoichiometric oxidants. The Cu(&#8545;) complex/TEMPO/O2 system uses a non&#8208;noble catalyst, and a green terminal oxidant as well as demonstrates high activity and functional group tolerance. Notably, H2O is the byproduct produced and overoxidation is not observed during the reaction process. The proposed mechanism was investigated via high&#8208;resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS), in situ FT&#8208;IR spectrometry, and GC analysis, and the formation of intermediates of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated carbonyl compounds from the aerobic dehydrogenation of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;saturated counterparts was observed.</dc:description>

         <title>Construction of MOF&#8208;derived Vanadium Nitride Decorated Micro/mesoporous Carbon Nanofibers for Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Design and manufacture of cathode materials, with suitable pore structure and high electrical conductivity to matching zinc anode, solving the problem of dissolution and structural degradation of cathode materials for zinc ion batteries (ZIBs), is great significance to the development of ZIBs. Herein, Vanadium Nitride (VN) uniformly decorated N&#8208;doped micro/mesoporous carbon nanofibers (VN/N&#8208;MCNF) with appropriate porous and reactive sites for Zn2+ is prepared by using V&#8208;MOF, as important precursor via electrostatic spinning and pyrolysis technique. As a cathode electrode for ZIBs, the VN/N&#8208;MCNF is suitable for diffusion and adsorption of large&#8208;sized solvated structured [Zn(H2O)6]2+, for its abundant micro/mesoporous structure and good electrical conductivity. The VN/N&#8208;MCNF electrode has high specific capacity of 242 mAh g&#8208;1 at 0.1 A g&#8208;1 and rate performance. Moreover, the VN/N&#8208;MCNF&#8208;based ZIBs can reach 92.5% capacity retention after 200 cycles at a low current density of 0.3 A g&#8208;1, and can reach 86.1% capacity retention after 5000 cycles at a high current density of 5 A g&#8208;1. These findings highlight the importance of a rational design of cathode materials for high&#8208;performance metal batteries, which can also be extended to the design of other materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Substrate Specificity of Adenine&#8208;Cu&#8208;PO 4 &#160;Nanozyme: Ascorbic Acid Oxidation and Selective Cytotoxicity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Though nanozymes are becoming promising alternatives to natural enzymes due to their superior properties, constructing nanozyme with high specificity is still a great challenge. Herein, with Cu2+ as an active site and adenine as a ligand, Adenine&#8208;Cu&#8208;PO4 is synthesized in phosphate&#8208;buffered saline. As an oxidase mimic, Adenine&#8208;Cu&#8208;PO4 could selectively catalyze oxidation of ascorbic acid (AA) to dehydroascorbic acid, but not universal substrates (3,3&#8217;,5,5&#8217;&#8208;tetramethylbenzidine (TMB), 2,2&#8217;&#8208;azino&#8208;bis (3&#8208;ethylbenzthiazoline&#8208;6&#8208;sulfonic acid) (ABTS) and 2,4&#8208;dichlorophenol (2,4&#8208;DP)), small biomolecules (dopamine, glutathione, glucose, galactose), other vitamins (vitamin A acid, vitamin B1, vitamin K1) and even dithiothreitol (a common interference of AA). Such the specific AA catalytic oxidation is revealed that Adenine&#8208;Cu&#8208;PO4 selectively binds with AA through hydrogen bonds, accompanied with catalyzing AA oxidation, and concurrently O2 transferring to H2O2 via O2&#8226;&#8208;, further to H2O via &#8226;OH. Based on the produced reactive oxygen species, with AA as a pro&#8208;oxidant, Adenine&#8208;Cu&#8208;PO4 nanozyme efficiently triggers severe intratumor oxidative stress to induce tumor cell death. This work opens a new avenue to design intrinsic nanozymes with high specificity, and also presents a promising application in the field of AA oxidation induced cancer therapy.</dc:description>

         <title>Construction of UCST&#8208;Responsive Claw&#8208;Like Polysulfobetaines for Efficient Capture of Cellulase</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The high cost of enzymatic glycolysis has seriously restricted the industrialization of lignocellulose&#8208;based sugar platform technology. Recovering and recycling cellulase can reduce the cost. Here, a thermo&#8208;responsive claw&#8208;type polysulfobetaine (PSPA) was constructed for hydrophobic grasping and efficient recycling of cellulase. Compared with the linear sulfobetaine homopolymer (PSPE), PSPA had more sensitive temperature response and strong cellulase recovery ability. PSPE&#8208;3 (Mw=355.1 kDa) was added to the hydrolysis system of corncob residue (CCR) (50 &#176;C), at 0.4 mass ratio of PSPE&#8208;3 to cellulase, and after enzymatic hydrolysis, 50% of the cellulase was saved when cooling to 25 &#176;C. But only 0.05 times PSPA&#8208;1 (Mw=30.0 kDa) was added to the CCR system, and 70% of the cellulase was saved when cooling to 25 &#176;C. This work presents a claw shaped protein&#8208;capture agent, polysulfobetaine for capturing cellulase, which is of great significance to reduce the lignocellulosic hydrolysis cost, and efficiently separate enzyme proteins.</dc:description>

         <title>Metal&#8208;organic Framework with Polar Pore Surface Designed for Purification of Both Natural Gas and Ethylene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The advancement of high&#8208;value CH4 purification technology within the natural gas industry is paramount for industrial processes. Herein, we constructed ZJNU&#8208;402, a new porous material characterized by permanent porosity, as an effective adsorbent for separating C3H8/CH4 and C2H6/CH4 mixtures. The findings reveal an outstanding C3H8 adsorption capacity of 68 cm3 g&#8211;1 and a moderate C2H6 adsorption rate of 42 cm3 g&#8211;1, with a notably lower CH4 adsorption rate of 11 cm3 g&#8211;1. Noteworthy is the exceptional selectivity of ZJNU&#8208;402 for C3H8/CH4 and C2H6/CH4, standing at 375 and 31, respectively, surpassing many previously documented high&#8208;performance adsorbents and breaking the traditional trade&#8208;off between adsorption capacity and separation selectivity. Adsorption heat calculations show that compared with CH4 molecules, C3H8 and C2H6 molecules form stronger bonds with the skeleton, resulting in excellent separation performance. In addition, the breakthrough experiment of ZJNU&#8208;402 can also completely separate the ternary component C3H8/C2H6/CH4 mixture to obtain 99.95% high&#8208;purity methane. At the same time, ZJNU&#8208;402 also has excellent structural stability, excellent recyclability, and low isosteric adsorption heat. Consequently, ZJNU&#8208;402 exhibits substantial potential for augmenting the efficacy of natural gas enrichment processes.</dc:description>

         <title>DNA Origami Adsorption and Lattice Formation on Different SiOx Surfaces</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Self&#8208;assembled DNA origami lattices on silicon oxide surfaces have great potential to serve as masks in molecular lithography. However, silicon oxide surfaces come in many different forms and the type and history of the silicon oxide has a large effect on its physicochemical surface properties. Therefore, we here investigate DNA origami lattice formation on differently fabricated SiOx films on silicon wafers after wet&#8208;chemical oxidation by RCA1. Despite having similar oxide compositions and hydroxylation states, of all surfaces tested, only thermally grown SiOx performs similarly well as native oxide. For the other SiOx films deposited by plasma&#8208;enhanced chemical vapor deposition and magnetron sputtering, DNA origami adsorption is strongly suppressed. This is attributed to an increased surface roughness and a lower oxide density, respectively. Our results demonstrate that the employed SiOx surface may decide over the outcome of an experiment and should be considered as an additional parameter that may require optimization and fine&#8208;tuning before high&#8208;quality lattices can be assembled. In particular, our observations suggest that efficient DNA origami lattice assembly on SiOx surfaces requires a low surface roughness and a high oxide density.</dc:description>

         <title>A Non&#8208;Volatile Pro&#8208;Dicamba Herbicide Inspired by Meclofenoxate</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dicamba is a popular herbicide with rising use but is also notorious for volatility drift. Inspired by meclofenoxate, which we show to be highly herbicidal, we developed a derivative of dicamba with an ester&#8208;bond to 2&#8208;dimethylaminoethanol. It remained herbicidal but is non&#8208;volatile, entering plants intact and hydrolyzing inside leaves to dicamba and 2&#8208;dimethylaminoethanol. This pro&#8208;dicamba is compatible with the relatively novel dicamba monooxygenase tolerance technology, suggesting pro&#8208;dicamba might be a suitable, non&#8208;volatile replacement for dicamba.</dc:description>

         <title>AIE&#8208;active Circularly Polarized Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Emitters for Stable Solution&#8208;Processed Circularly Polarized Electroluminescence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Circularly polarized organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (CP&#8208;OLEDs) have significant promise for naked&#8208;eye 3D displays. However, most devices are fabricated using vacuum deposition technology, and development of efficient solution&#8208;processed CP&#8208;OLEDs, particularly those exhibiting low efficiency roll&#8208;off, remains a formidable challenge. This research successfully designed and synthesized two pairs of thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) enantiomers through isomer engineering, namely (R/S)&#8208;N&#8208;5&#8208;TPA and (R/S)&#8208;N&#8208;4&#8208;TPA, which features fifth and fourth substitution sites of phthalimide (acceptor) by tri&#8208;phenylamine (donor), respectively. Both molecules displayed aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) properties. Notably, the CP&#8208;OLED devices, fabricated by solution&#8208;process, exhibited vivid blue&#8208;green and green emission with the maximum current efficiency of 7.4 and 29.6 cd A&#8208;1, the external quantum efficiency of 2.7% and 10.2%, and the low efficiency roll&#8208;off of 3.7% and 16.7%. Moreover, these devices demonstrated CP&#8208;EL signals with gEL values of +6.61 &#215; 10&#8208;4 /&#8208;6.84 &#215; 10&#8208;4 and +1.13 &#215; 10&#8208;3/&#8208;1.25 &#215; 10&#8208;3, respectively.</dc:description>

         <title>Peptide&#8208;Scaffolded Detergents for Membrane Protein Studies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Detergents are essential for preserving the structural integrity and functionality of membrane proteins (MPs) outside the biological membrane or in aqueous solution, and thus ensuring accurate biochemical and structural analyses. Here, we introduce peptide&#8208;scaffolded detergents, a novel class of hybrid molecules formed by preassembling detergent monomers with peptides of varying lengths, mediated via Click chemistry. These detergents are characterized by scalable, straightforward synthesis and enhanced solubility. Among the variants, A4B2 emerged as the optimal detergent, demonstrating superior thermal stabilization across a range of G protein&#8208;coupled receptors, including A2AAR, SMO and GLP&#8208;1R. Additionally, A4B2 exhibits a low critical micelle concentration and small micelle size, together making it particularly effective for electron microscopy studies of A2AAR. This innovative design leverages the benefits of peptide&#8208;based and traditional detergents, offering new insights for the development of advanced detergents in MP research.</dc:description>

         <title>Property Tuning in N&#8208;Methylpyrrole Azo&#8208;Photoswitches via Modification of the Peripheral Substituents</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of pyrrole&#8208;azo&#8211;benzene molecular photoswitches was designed and prepared to comprehensively address the substitution effect on the photoswitching performance. By selecting proper substituents, the switching ranging from seconds to hours can be achieved along with a large tuning of thermal, (non)linear optical, and electrochemical properties.







Abstract
Differently substituted pyrrole&#8208;azo&#8211;benzene molecular photoswitches were prepared in a straightforward synthetic way. Their fundamental properties were investigated by XRD analysis, differential scanning calorimetry, thermogravimetric analysis, cyclic voltammetry, UV&#8211;Vis absorption spectroscopy, Hyper&#8208;Rayleigh Scattering, and NMR spectroscopy; the experimental results were further corroborated by DFT calculations. Thermal robustness, the HOMO/LUMO levels, and the absorption properties were altered mostly by substituting the N&#8211;methylpyrrole moiety and further fine&#8208;tuned by modifying the benzene substituents. The pyrrole substituent also proved crucial for the second&#8208;order non&#8211;linear optical (NLO) response as well as the photoswitching performance. Both fast and slow molecular switches can be designed with the half&#8211;life of the (Z) &#8211;isomer ranging from 48&#8197;seconds to 23.28&#8197;hours and the E/Z molar ratio up to 12/88. This comprehensive study allowed elucidation of the fundamental structure&#8208;property relationships and subsequently addresses the key aspects of the property tuning via substitution in molecular azo&#8208;photoswitches.

In this way, we have been able to create chiral nematic mesoporous films with macrocyclic molecules on the surface to obtain a new class of hybrid inclusion materials.

         <title>C(sp2)&#8722;H Acylation of Benzo[h]quinolines at Room Temperature via Aldehyde Autoxidation and Palladium Catalysis Cooperation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An aerobic radical C(sp2)&#8722;H acylation is developed, utilizing the simultaneous cooperation of aldehyde autoxidation with Pd&#8208;catalysis. A key aspect of the process is the selective amalgamation of acyl radical generated by aldehyde autoxidation with Pd&#8208;catalysis via substrate&#8208;guided radical sorting. The desired acylated products are obtained in generally good yields (up to 82&#8201;%). Based on the results obtained in a series of control studies and DFT calculations, a proposed PdII/PdIII&#8208;catalytic cycle has been implicated.







Abstract
Herein, we report Pd&#8208;catalyzed C(sp2)&#8722;H acylation using aldehyde as acyl source and O2 as the green oxidant at room temperature. A selective association of acyl radical formed in&#8208;situ during aldehyde autoxidation with Pd&#8208;catalysis is the key to the process. The reaction afforded products in good yields (up to 82&#8201;%) and it is scalable. The proposed PdII/PdIII&#8208;catalytic cycle is supported by a series of control studies and DFT calculations.

         <title>Achieving Precise Control Over the Molecular Periphery of Dibenzoixenes Through Modular Synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report rationally designed modular syntheses of isomeric dibenzoixenes with diverse molecular peripheries, including cove, zigzag, bay, fjord, and gulf structures. The edge structures of these molecules were not only thoroughly analyzed by spectroscopic techniques, but also evaluated by their applications in Li&#8208;ion batteries.







Abstract
Nanographenes and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, both finite forms of graphene, are promising organic semiconducting materials because their optoelectronic and magnetic properties can be modulated through precise control of their molecular peripheries. Several atomically precise edge structures have been prepared by bottom&#8208;up synthesis; however, no systematic elucidation of these edge topologies at the molecular level has been reported. Herein, we describe rationally designed modular syntheses of isomeric dibenzoixenes with diverse molecular peripheries, including cove, zigzag, bay, fjord, and gulf structured. The single&#8208;crystal structures of dibenzo[a,p]ixene and dibenzo[j,y]ixene reveal enantiomeric pairs with helically twisted cove edges and packing structures. The molecular edge structures are identified from the C&#8722;H bonds of the dibenzoixenes using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy with different vibrational modes, which were further explained using density functional theory calculations. Electron spin resonance spectroscopy indicates that the zigzag&#8208;edged molecular periphery significantly affects the magnetic properties of the material. Furthermore, the electrochemical characteristics, examined using dibenzoixenes as anode materials in Li&#8208;ion batteries, reveal that the dibenzo[a,p]ixene exhibits promising Li intercalation behaviors with a specific capacity of ~120&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1. The findings of this study could facilitate the synthesis of larger

         <title>Electrocatalytic HER Performance of [FeFe]&#8208;Hydrogenase Mimics Bearing M&#8208;salen Moieties (M=Zn, Ni, Fe, Mn)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of novel complexes (5&#8208;8) combining [(&#956;&#8208;adt)Fe2(CO)6] fragments and M&#8208;salen (M=Zn, Ni, Fe, Mn) complexes has been achieved. Computational studies confirm distinct geometries for the Zn, Ni, Fe, and Mn complexes. Electrochemical and electrocatalytic experiments reveal cooperative proton reduction and notable reductions in overpotential, especially for the Ni, Fe, and Mn complexes, highlighting their catalytic potential.







Abstract
The synthesis and characterization of novel compounds (5&#8208;8) as mimetics of [FeFe]&#8208;hydrogenase, combining two distinct systems capable of participating in hydrogen evolution reactions (HER): the [(&#956;&#8208;adt)Fe2(CO)6] fragment and M&#8208;salen complexes (salen=N,N&#8242;&#8208;bis(salicylidene)ethylenediamine) (M=Zn, Ni, Fe, Mn), is reported. These complexes were synthesized in high yields via a three&#8208;step procedure from N,N&#8242;&#8208;bis(4&#8208;R&#8208;salicylidene)ethanediamine) 4 [R=Fe2(CO)6(&#956;&#8208;SCH2)2NCOCH2O]. Structural analysis through spectroscopic, spectrometric, and computational (DFT) methods confirmed distorted tetrahedral and square&#8208;planar geometries for Zn&#8208;salen and Ni&#8208;salen complexes (5 and 6) respectively, while complexes Fe&#8208;salen 7 and Mn&#8208;salen 8 exhibit square&#8208;based pyramidal structures typical of Fe(III) and Mn(III) high&#8208;spin salen&#8208;complexes. Electrochemical studies revealed different reduction events for [(&#956;&#8208;adt)Fe2(CO)6] and M&#8208;salen moieties, but the electrocatalytic experiments in TFA demonstrated a clear cooperative effect between these components, especially at higher acid concentrations. Notably, the Ni&#8208;salen (6), Fe&#8208;salen (7), and Mn&#8208;salen (8) complexes exhibit significant reductions in overpotential, highlighting their potential for enhanced catalytic performance.

         <title>Reductive Zincke Reaction: Opening of Pyridinium Rings to &#948;&#8208;Amino Ketones via Transfer Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new pyridine ring&#8208;opening reaction, reductive Zincke reaction, is described, which allows various pyridinium compounds to be ring&#8208;opened to afford saturated &#948;&#8208;amino ketones, with a simple rhodium catalyst under mild transfer hydrogenation conditions. The versatility of the reaction is further demonstrated in the synthesis of drug analogues and late&#8208;stage modification of pharmaceutical compounds.







Abstract
The Zincke reaction and Birch reduction have been one of the few reactions that allow for ring opening of pyridines ever since the discovery of pyridine more than a century ago. This paper presents a new addition to the list of pyridine ring&#8208;opening reactions, reductive Zincke reaction, which affords saturated &#948;&#8208;amino ketones. Under the catalysis of a simple rhodium complex, pyridinium salts with diverse substituents are reduced with formic acid, ring&#8208;opened with water, transaminated with a secondary amine and further reduced to afford a wide range of &#948;&#8208;amino ketones, including those in which the alkane chain of the ketones is selectively deuterated or fluorinated. The applicability of the reaction is exemplified by the synthesis of drug analogues and late&#8208;stage modification of drug molecules.

         <title>Tuning the Duplex Stability of DNA Oligonucleotides Containing Metal&#8208;Mediated Base Pairs of Imidazole&#8208;Derived Nucleobases</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The formation of metal&#8208;mediated base pairs comprised of HQIm (3H&#8208;imidazo[4,5&#8208;f]quinolin&#8208;5&#8208;ol) and/or CaIm (imidazole&#8208;4&#8208;carboxylate) induces a significant thermal stabilization of DNA with the 3d metal ions CoII, NiII and ZnII, as well as the lanthanoid ions EuIII and SmIII. The thermal stability is dependent on the identity of the artificial base pair and added metal ion, as well as the pH value.







Abstract
Two artificial imidazole&#8208;derived nucleobases, HQIm (3H&#8208;imidazo[4,5&#8208;f]quinolin&#8208;5&#8208;ol) and CaIm (imidazole&#8208;4&#8208;carboxylate), were introduced into short DNA duplexes to systematically investigate their thermal stability upon metal ion coordination. Metal&#8208;mediated base pairs are formed with the 3d metal ions CoII, NiII and ZnII, as well as with the lanthanoid ions EuIII and SmIII, which induce a thermal stabilization of up to 8&#8201;&#176;C upon binding. The latter are the first lanthanoid&#8208;mediated base pairs involving only four donor atoms that result in a significant duplex stabilization. For the 3d metal ions, the increase in DNA melting temperature is in agreement with the trend in complex stability according to the Irving&#8208;Williams series. The duplex stabilization upon metal&#8208;mediated base pair formation depends on the identity of the artificial base pair, enabling discrimination between metal ions by systematic design of the duplex. Further, the influence of pH on the stability of selected duplexes was studied, revealing a linear relation between pH and the formation of HQIm&#8211;NiII&#8211;HQIm base pairs and allowing to induce a distinct stabilization between 1&#8201;&#176;C and 28&#8201;&#176;C. Regarding EuIII&#8208;mediated base pairs, an acidic pH can be utilized to disturb their formation, presumably by promoting the coordination of EuIII to the DNA backbone.

         <title>Interfacial Synergism in NiMoO4/FeOOH Heterostructure for Enhanced Alkaline Oxygen Evolution and Urea Oxidation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A one&#8208;dimensional core&#8208;shell NiMoO4/FeOOH heterojunction with high OER activity and stability was developed. In which, a thin FeOOH layer would provide greater electrochemical activity with less charge transfer resistance, and the entire FeOOH layer is close to the interface with NiMoO4 would provide electron an electron highway for electron transfer to further improve the electric conductivity of FeOOH.







Abstract
FeOOH with excellent catalytic properties for oxygen evolution and also considered to be a true active site has attracted great interest in recent years. However, the intrinsic low conductivity limits its catalytic performance. Herein, a one&#8208;dimensional core&#8208;shell NiMoO4/FeOOH heterojunction with high OER activity and stability was developed. At current densities of 10 and 100&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, low overpotentials of 194 and 266&#8197;mV are need to drive oxygen evolution, meanwhile, the electrode exhibits high catalytic kinetics with small Tafel slopes of 53.4&#8197;mV&#8201;dec&#8722;1 and excellent stability over 100&#8197;hours. Further analysis showed that the ultrathin FeOOH layer (~5&#8197;nm) uniformly covered the surface of NiMoO4 nanorods, acting as an active species and facilitating the surface change transfer to the interior. The internal NiMoO4 cores, on the other hand, provides reliable electron transmission as a highly conductive medium, and can effectively overcome the low conductivity of FeOOH. DFT calculations further manifest the strong electronic interactions between NiMoO4 and FeOOH species. The NiMoO4 core serves as mass transport of active materials is beneficial to tune the adsorption energy of OH&#8722; on the surface of electrocatalysts.

         <title>Data Analysis Methods in Time&#8208;Resolved Fluorescence Spectroscopy: A Tutorial Review</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A modern approach to analyse complex fluorescence decays should include more than fitting to a multi&#8208;exponential decay. This review provides an accessible and comprehensive overview of the techniques available to analyse luminescence decays. Each method is explained thoroughly, highlighting its strengths and limitations. A practical example is provided on which a workflow combining several methods is applied.







Abstract
Fluorescence spectroscopy and related techniques benefit from exceptional sensitivity and have become engrained in a variety of fields from biosciences to materials sciences. Measuring time&#8208;domain fluorescence decays is nowadays a routine task in many laboratories across these different fields. Perhaps surprisingly, a correct data analysis of these fluorescence decay curves presents a formidable challenge and requires extensive insight in the problems associated with fitting this type of data. As a result, the reported analysis of these decays is usually limited to a non&#8208;linear least squares fit of a sum of a few exponential terms to the data. This review aims to expose the intricate field of data analysis in time&#8208;resolved fluorescence spectroscopy to a broader audience, from researchers interested in understanding the photophysics of their system to readers and reviewers trying to understand the merits of specific methods. Challenges associated with this type of kinetic experimental data are outlined and the clever analysis strategies devised by researchers across different disciplines are introduced and discussed in detail. A section on freely available scripts and software facilitating the analysis is included towards the end. We encourage the reader to try their hand at the worked examples.

         <title>Photocatalytic Multiple Deuteration of Polyethylene Glycol Derivatives Using Deuterium Oxide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Supporting information for this article is given via a link at the end of the document.We successfully established a multiple deuteration for PEG derivatives via photocatalytic &#945;&#8208;oxy C(sp3)&#8722;H activation in the presence of TBADT using D2O as an inexpensive deuterium source. The mechanistic study using DFT calculation etc. revealed deuteration reactivity. This first accomplishment of multiple deuterium incorporation to PEG skeleton will contribute to develop the future deuterium science and medicinal chemistry.







Abstract
Deuterated molecules are of growing interest because of the specific characteristics of deuterium, such as stronger C&#8722;D bonds being stronger than C&#8722;H bonds. Polyethylene glycols (PEGs) are widely utilized in scientific fields (e.&#8201;g., drug discovery and material sciences) as linkers and for the improvement of various properties (solubility in water, stability, etc.) of mother compounds. Therefore, deuterated PEGs can be used as novel tools for drug discovery. Although the H/D exchange reaction (deuteration) is a powerful and straightforward method to produce deuterated compounds, the deuteration of PEGs bearing many unactivated C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds has not been developed. Herein, we report the photocatalytic deuteration of multiple sites of PEGs using tetra&#8208;n&#8208;butylammonium decatungstate (TBADT) and D2O as an inexpensive deuterium source. This deuteration can be adapted to PEG derivatives bearing various substituents ((hetero)aryl, benzoyl, alkyl, etc.). The deuteration efficiencies of the &#945;&#8208;oxy C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds at the terminal positions of the PEGs were strongly influenced by the substituents. These reactivities were elucidated by density functional theory calculations of the reaction barriers towards the formation of radical intermediates, induced by the excited state of TBADT and the PEG substrate. In addition, the applicability of deuterated PEGs to internal standard experiments and Raman spectroscopy was demonstrated.

         <title>Defluorinative Diazolation&#8208;Cyclization Relay for Synthesis of Furan&#8208;Bridged Triheterocycles and Colorimetric Sensor Application</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategic connection of two azacycles via a furan bridge through a defluorinative diazolation&#8208;cyclization reaction of trifluoromethyl enones and N&#8208;heterocycles was developed. A range of modular 2,4&#8208;furan&#8208;bridged triheterocycles (FBTHs), featuring a C3&#8208;trifluoromethyl group, was synthesized in moderate to good yields with broad substrate scope and good regioselectivity under transition metal&#8208;free conditions.







Abstract
Polyaromatics, as the assembly of diverse cyclic &#960;&#8208;systems, exhibit unique physicochemical properties when compared to their individual constituents. In this study, we developed a strategic connection of two azacycles via a furan bridge through a defluorinative diazolation&#8208;cyclization reaction of trifluoromethyl enones and N&#8208;heterocycles. A range of modular 2,4&#8208;furan&#8208;bridged triheterocycles (FBTHs), featuring a C3&#8208;trifluoromethyl group, was synthesized with broad substrate scope and good regioselectivity under transition metal&#8208;free conditions. This three&#8208;component protocol was achieved through successive C(sp3)&#8208;F bond functionalization of one trifluoromethyl group, which is recognized for its stability and durability. Moreover, the synthetically useful functionalities such as bromide and formyl group could be easily installed on the resulting products, and the imidazole&#8208;containing FBTH could serve as a valuable ligand in the preparation of an advanced colorimetric sensor, thereby underscoring their potential applications.

&lt;p&gt;A strategic connection of two azacycles via a furan bridge through a defluorinative diazolation-cyclization reaction of trifluoromethyl enones and N-heterocycles was developed. A range of modular 2,4-furan-bridged triheterocycles (FBTHs), featuring a C3-trifluoromethyl group, was synthesized in moderate to good yields with broad substrate scope and good regioselectivity under transition metal-free conditions.

&lt;p&gt;Polyaromatics, as the assembly of diverse cyclic &#960;-systems, exhibit unique physicochemical properties when compared to their individual constituents. In this study, we developed a strategic connection of two azacycles &lt;i&gt;via&lt;/i&gt; a furan bridge through a defluorinative diazolation-cyclization reaction of trifluoromethyl enones and &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-heterocycles.

         <title>Block Architectures in 2D Polymer Networks Fabricated via Sequential Copolymerization in a Metal&#8211;Organic Framework</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) polymer network monolayers with novel block architectures were synthesized using a metal&#8208;organic framework template. Sequential RAFT copolymerization of methyl methacrylate and styrene produced &#8216;patchy&#8217; domains, with AFM revealing nanoscopic phase segregation in the individual 2D nanosheets. This approach offers a novel route to flexible, anisotropic 2D polymeric nanomaterials.







Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) polymer network monolayers with novel block architectures were fabricated via sequential copolymerization within a pillared&#8208;layer metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) that served as the reaction template. The MOF provides a confined 2D nanospace, restricting the crosslinking copolymerization of vinyl monomers to two dimensions. Sequential crosslinking copolymerization of methyl methacrylate and styrene, regulated by the reversible addition&#8211;fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) process, resulted in the formation of 2D block architectures with &#8216;patchy&#8217; domains consisting of crosslinked poly(methyl methacrylate) and polystyrene segments. Atomic force microscopy revealed that the resulting block monolayers exhibited varied morphologies on substrates, attributed to their intrinsic flexibility in 2D conformation, which facilitated microphase separation of the 2D segments within monolayers, leading to the unique aggregation morphologies. The unprecedented block topology in 2D polymeric monolayers presented in this study introduces a novel strategy for designing 2D polymeric nanomaterials with flexible yet anisotropic properties.

         <title>Photoexcited Hantzsch Ester Anions Enabled C&#8722;F Bond Activation and Hydro&#8208;Difluoroalkylation of Arylethylenes Through Dual&#8208;SET Process</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hantzsch ester (HE) is a classic reductant used for single electron transfer (SET) and/or hydrogen atom transfer (HAT). However, there have been only a few examples involving the highly reducing properties of the photoexcited HE anion. One guiding idea, the installation of electron donor groups (EDGs) on the HE moiety to prepare super&#8208;reductants, has not yet been explored. In this study, we report the C&#8722;F bond activation and hydro&#8208;difluoroalkylation of arylethylenes via a dual&#8208;SET process enabled by Hantzsch ester anions under blue light irradiation. This method demonstrates excellent compatibility with both electron&#8208;deficient and electron&#8208;rich aryl&#8208;CF3, enabling synthesis of a broad range of gem&#8208;difluoroalkanes, including the bioisostere. Mechanistic studies indicate that, in addition to the established SET process of Hantzsch ester anions, a key secondary SET process from the Hantzsch ester radical generated in the first SET also occurs.







Abstract
In this study, we reported a new approach to activate the C&#8722;F bond of trifluoromethylarenes to achieve the hydro&#8208;difluoroalkylation of arylethylenes using photoexcited Hantzsch esters (HEs) anions. A wide range of &#945;,&#945;&#8208;difluoroalkanes was synthesized. Late&#8208;stage functionalization of drug molecules and synthesis of bioactive molecule bioisostere were also presented. Mechanistic studies revealed that the dual&#8208;single electron transfer (SET) process of HEs anion was the key to this reaction.

         <title>Inter&#8208; and Intra&#8208;Molecular Charge Redistributions in H&#8208;Bonded Cyanuric Acid*Melamine (CA*M) Networks: Insight From Core Level Spectroscopy and Natural Bond Orbital Analysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The heteromolecular H&#8208;bonding interaction between Cyanuric Acid (CA) and Melamine (M) involves two types of H&#8208;bonds, where the two molecules alternatively act as H&#8208;donors and H&#8208;acceptors. However, the strengths of these interaction are unequal resulting in a net charge transfer from M to CA. Additionally, the intermolecular charge transfer is accompanied by enhanced electron delocalization within both molecules.







Abstract
In this work, we elucidate the electronic charge redistributions that occur within the cyanuric acid (CA) and melamine (M) molecules upon formation of the triple H&#8208;bond between the imide group of CA and the diaminopyridine group of M. To achieve this, we investigated 2D H&#8208;bonded assemblies of M, CA and CA*M grown on the Au(111) surface, using X&#8208;ray photoemission (XPS) and near edge X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure (NEXAFS) spectroscopies. Compared to the homomolecular networks, the spectra of the mixed sample reveal core level shifts in opposite directions for CA and M, indicating a nearly complementary charge accumulation on the CA molecule and a charge depletion on the M molecule. These findings were further confirmed by theoretical simulation of the ionization potentials (IPs), which were computed using unsupported models of the H&#8208;bonded networks. A natural bond orbital (NBO) analysis performed on the three systems helped to rationalize the net charge transfer form M to CA. Finally, we observed that intramolecular interactions (electron delocalization effects) contribute progressively to the charge redistributions inside the two molecules when going from the homomolecular to the heteromolecular networks.

         <title>Exploring Benzothieno[3,2&#8208;b]benzothiophene S&#8208;Oxides for Organic Electronics, Fluorescence&#8208;Based Applications, and Asymmetric Synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The paper investigates the effect of sulfur atom oxidation on the structural, thermal, optical, and electronic properties of benzothieno[3,2&#8208;b]benzothiophene (BTBT). It also explores the potential applications of the synthesized BTBT S&#8208;oxides in various fields, including asymmetric synthesis, fluorescent imaging, and organic electronics, highlighting their significance in advancing these areas.







Abstract
A series of benzothieno[3,2&#8208;b]benzothiophene S&#8208;oxides has been efficiently synthesized via one&#8208; or two&#8208;step selective oxidation of benzothieno[3,2&#8208;b]benzothiophene (BTBT). These BTBT S&#8208;oxides form highly ordered structures that display optical anisotropy, are thermally stable up to temperatures above 210&#8201;&#176;C, and do not show phase transitions. They exhibit long excited state lifetimes (0.181&#8211;0.869&#8197;ms) and are more resistant to oxidative degradation than their parent unoxidized BTBT. Some of these compounds demonstrate high quantum yields, exceeding 98&#8201;% in solution and 71&#8201;% in the solid state. As evidenced by quantum&#8208;chemical calculations, BTBT&#8208;based sulfoxides have sufficiently high pyramidal inversion energy barriers that prevent their stereomutation at room temperature. Additionally, fully S&#8208;oxidized BTBT meets the energy&#8208;splitting criterion required for the singlet fission process, with the T1 energy level that makes it suitable for device application.

         <title>Kinetic Modelling and Machine Learning Approaches on the Conductance Transients of Zn0.5Ni0.5Fe2O4 Sensors for Addressing Cross&#8208;sensitivity towards Ethanol and Acetone Vapors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A systematic approach addresses ethanol and acetone vapor discrimination using wet chemically prepared Zn0.5Ni0.5Fe2O4 nanoparticles. The study explores synthesis, characterization, and sensing performance under varying conditions. Kinetic modelling and machine learning algorithms provide insights, enhancing selectivity precision and response prediction. This robust strategy advances volatile organic compound detection with improved discrimination of sensing signals.







Abstract
The accurate discrimination among various volatile organic compounds, especially ethanol and acetone possess a serious concern for metal oxide based chemiresistive sensors. The work presents a systematic approach to address the issue by utilizing superior sensing potentiality of Zn0.5Ni0.5Fe2O4 coupled with efficient machine learning (ML) techniques. The work provides a thorough understanding on the synthesis, characterization of Zn0.5Ni0.5Fe2O4 nanoparticles and evaluates their sensing performance towards ethanol and acetone vapors. The optimized sensor performance recorded under varying concentrations (100&#8211;1000&#8197;ppm) of analytes across the range of temperature (225&#8211;300&#8201;&#176;C) provides lesser selectivity between acetone and ethanol. The Langmuir&#8208;Hinshelwood reaction mechanism was invoked further to address the selectivity issue by modelling the response transients of the sensor to get an insight into sensing interaction at a microscopic level. The estimated activation energy values of ethanol (0.26&#8197;eV) have been found to be smaller compared to that of acetone (0.34&#8197;eV), explaining little higher response of the sensor towards ethanol. Moreover, some efficient ML algorithms were employed to predictively analyze the acquired sensing data for achieving more precise discriminations between these two analytes.

         <title>Microwave&#8208;Assisted Synthesis of Platinum&#8208;free High&#8208;Entropy Alloy Catalysts on Reduced Graphene Oxide Sheets for Enhanced Oxygen Reduction and Evolution Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Innovations in catalysis are crucial, particularly through a straightforward and facile method. Nano&#8208;sized Pt&#8208;free high entropy alloys were synthesized via a pulsed microwave technique at low temperature, which serve as efficient electrochemical catalysts for the ORR and OER. The synthesized catalysts are promising candidate for the green energy technology.







Abstract
Nano&#8208;sized high&#8208;entropy materials (HEMs) recently received more attention to researchers due to their superior electrochemical catalytic properties. HEMs comprise at least five elements with or without metals and are synthesized through solid&#8208;state reactions and solution&#8208;mediated techniques. The presence of many elements in these HEMs result in a high mixing entropy and facilitates the formation of stable solid solutions in fundamental crystal structures. Herein, Pt&#8208;free high&#8208;entropy alloys (HEAs) were synthesized through facile and straightforward pulse microwave (PM) synthesis technique, which serve as efficient electrochemical catalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). The PM synthesis method was conducted at an extremely low temperature (100&#8201;&#176;C) without any external catalytic reagents. Using this PM technique, Cr18.2Zr13.5Ti5.3Co17.8Ni8.4Cu8.5Fe28.3 and Al15.3Mn18.2Ti3.7Co23.2Ni5.9Cu5.9Fe27.8 HEAs catalysts were synthesized with superior catalytic activity towards OER and ORR and compare its activities with pure Pt catalysts. The as&#8208;prepared HEAs also display an anti&#8208;CO poisoning effect and long&#8208;term durability, as compared to pure Pt catalysts. The low&#8208;temperature PM approach not only confirms the feasibility of synthesis of noble metal&#8208;free HEAs but also validates their superior catalytic activity towards OER and ORR, which is beneficial for the development of proton exchange membrane fuel cells and proton exchange membrane water electrolysis.

         <title>One&#8208;Pot Synthesis of Multicentric DIL@PDIL Catalyst for Mild CO2 Conversion to Cyclic Carbonates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multicentric DIL@PDIL catalyst was efficiently synthesized from five readily available starting materials in one&#8208;pot. The multicentric catalyst possessed high ion density and demonstrated satisfactory catalytic performance under mild conditions. The [TMGH]+, Br&#8722;, &#8208;COO&#8722;, and imidazole cation of the gemini DIL were found to synergistically facilitate the CO2 cycloaddition reaction.







Abstract
Among the various studies on CO2 utilization, the sustainable and cost&#8208;effective fixation of CO2 into cyclic carbonates remains one of the most intriguing subjects. To this end, a novel type of composite dicationic ionic liquid material, DIL@PDIL, was developed. This composite consists of a dicationic ionic liquid (DIL), DMAP[TMGH]Br, supported on a polymeric dicationic ionic liquid (PDIL), P&#8208;DVB/Im[TMGH]Br. The multicentric high&#8208;ion&#8208;density material was prepared with exceptional efficiency from five readily available starting materials in one pot through simultaneous quaternization, neutralization and polymerization. The structure was characterized using FT&#8208;IR, XPS, SEM, TGA, ICP&#8208;MS and BET, as well as through stepwise synthesis verification. Evaluation of the catalytic performance revealed the ionic liquid composite delivered chloropropylene carbonate (CPC) in excellent yield and selectivity from either pure CO2 or simulated flue gas at 60 &#176;C and relatively lower pressure. Additionally, the DIL@PDIL catalyst exhibited good recyclability and were applicable to a range of epoxide substrates. The high activity of the the catalyst could be attributed to the abundant [TMGH]+ hydrogen bonding donors and Br&#8722; anions, which synergistically catalyze the epoxide ring&#8208;opening, as well as the abundant &#8208;COO&#8722; groups and imidazole cations, which facilitate the adsorption and activation of CO2.

         <title>A Shape&#8208;Memory and Durable Transparent Polyacrylate Film Integrated by Soft&#8208;Rigid Chains</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents a rational design strategy of flexible polyacrylate (PA) films with high transparency, shape memory, excellent abrasion resistance and foldability, for making the fabrication of transparent flexible displays or other flexible devices. The films are prepared by free&#8208;radical polymerisation of vinyl&#8208;terminated PU prepolymer as cross&#8208;linking agent and various acrylate monomers with the soft rigid chains under UV light.







Abstract
Flexible film in display requires multi&#8208;functional integration, such as stretchability, flexibility, abrasion resistance, transparency, and shape memory. In this paper, a reasonable design strategy of flexible polyacrylate (PA) film with high transparency, shape memory, excellent abrasion resistance and foldability is presented. The PA films are prepared by free radical polymerization of vinyl&#8208;terminated polyurethane (PU) prepolymer as a cross&#8208;linking agent and acrylate monomers in ultraviolet (UV) light. The various acrylate monomers in PA films with different functional groups (e.&#8201;g. epoxy groups, benzene rings) provide soft&#8208;rigid chains and hydrogen bonds, which improve overall mechanical and optical properties. The experimental results also effectively demonstrate that after folding performance (500 cycles) or abrasion resistance (1000 cycles), the transparency of PA film remained above 91&#8201;%. In addition, the PA films with different folded shapes also prove excellent shape memory, which can fix the folded shape at low temperature and then return to the original shape at room temperature. Notably, the PA film is successfully applied to the curved touch screen through drawing, pattern decoding and image magnification in the simulation practical demonstration, fully revealing its great significance as a flexible substrate in the development of future flexible displays.

         <title>Graphene Oxide as a Self&#8208;Carbocatalyst to Facilitate the Ring&#8208;Opening Polymerization of Glycidol for Efficient Polyglycerol Grafting</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Grafting of polyglycerol (PG) onto graphene oxide (GO) is initiated by: 1) a spontaneous reaction of epoxide with carboxyl groups at the edge of GO and those oxidized from aldehydes, and 2) a GO catalyzed reaction of the epoxides with the hydroxyl groups. GO also catalyzes the subsequent polymerization of glycidol on growing PG to afford a ramified PG macromolecule with a random branch&#8208;on&#8208;branch topology.







Abstract
Grafting carbon&#8208;based nanomaterials (CNMs) with polyglycerol (PG) improves their application potentials in biomedicine and electronics. Although &#8220;grafting from&#8221; method offers advantages over &#8220;grafting to&#8221; one in terms of operability and versatility, little is known about the reaction process of glycidol with the surface groups onto CNMs. By using graphene oxide (GO) as a multi&#8208;functional model material, we examined the reactivity of the surface groups on GO toward glycidol molecules via a set of model reactions.

&lt;p&gt;Grafting of polyglycerol (PG) onto graphene oxide (GO) is initiated by: 1) a spontaneous reaction of epoxide with carboxyl groups at the edge of GO and those oxidized from aldehydes, and 2) a GO catalyzed reaction of the epoxides with the hydroxyl groups. GO also catalyzes the subsequent polymerization of glycidol on growing PG to afford a ramified PG macromolecule with a random branch-on-branch topology.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grafting carbon-based nanomaterials (CNMs) with polyglycerol (PG) improves their application potentials in biomedicine and electronics. Although &#8220;grafting from&#8221; method offers advantages over &#8220;grafting to&#8221; one in terms of operability and versatility, little is known about the reaction process of glycidol with the surface groups onto CNMs. By using graphene oxide (GO) as a multi-functional model material, we examined the reactivity of the surface groups on GO toward glycidol molecules via a set of model reactions. We reveal that carboxyl groups spontaneously react with the epoxide ring with no need of catalyst, while GO catalyzes the reactions of hydroxyl groups with the epoxide of glycidol. In addition, the hydroxyl group of glycidol can open the epoxide in the basal plane of GO. The subsequent polymerization of PG is supposed to propagate at the primary and/or the secondary hydroxyl groups, generating a ramified PG macromolecule with random branch-on-branch topology. In addition, ketones, benzyl esters and aromatic ethers are found not to react with glycidol even in the presence of GO, while the aldehydes are easily oxidized into carboxyl groups under ambient condition, behaving then as the carboxyl groups.

         <title>Selective Decarboxylative Fluorination of &#946;&#8208;Keto Acids in Aqueous Media: 19F&#8208;NMR&#8208;Assisted Batch Optimization and Transfer to Continuous Flow</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of API relevant &#945;&#8208;fluoro ketone phenacyl fluoride is finally described as a catalyst&#8208;free continuous flow process. This selective decarboxylative monofluorination is optimized in batch mode for aqueous and biocompatible conditions varying temperature, additives, and pH. Furthermore, benchtop NMR PAT was used for fundamental studies to a better understanding of the mechanism of the decarboxylative fluorination as well as the reaction pathways to &#945;&#8208;difluorinated ketone derivatives.







Abstract
The selective decarboxylative fluorination of 3&#8208;oxo&#8208;3&#8208;phenylpropionic acid is used as a benchmark reaction to optimize it under biocompatible conditions in batch and to transfer it to continuous flow mode. The reaction conditions are varied with respect to temperature, fluorinating reagents, inorganic base additives, and pH, as these parameters have been identified as having a significant impact on the process. The formation of the products and any by&#8208;products is analyzed using gas chromatography (GC) and 19F nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR). Once optimal conditions have been determined, the reaction is carried out using an automated continuous laboratory synthesis system that features a mesostructured capillary reactor and an integrated 19F&#8208;NMR spectrometer for real&#8208;time monitoring of the reaction. The work presented here represents the initial phase of a multi&#8208;step continuous flow process that will include additional biocatalyzed downstream reactions in future applications.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An unprecedented formal [1+5] cyclization of indoline&#8208;derived azadienes with 1,3,5&#8208;triazinanes has been realized, providing a facile access to biologically important indoline&#8208;spiro&#8208;hexahydropyrimidines with good to excellent yields (up to 99% yield). Different from previous reports, this is the first study that indoline&#8208;derived azadienes could participate in cyclizations as one&#8208;atom synthons. This methodology is also distinguished by not involving any additive or catalyst, readily available starting materials, wide range of substrate applicability, operational simplicity and simultaneously reassembling two C&#8208;N&#160;and two C&#8208;C bonds in one&#8208;step reaction.</dc:description>

         <title>Low&#8208;Temperature Oxidation of Methane to Methanol on a Zeolitic Octahedral Metal Oxide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Direct oxidation of methane to methanol utilizing molecular oxygen under mild conditions is an important yet challenging process due to the difficulty in activation of methane under such conditions. In this research, we report zeolitic octahedral metal oxides based on cobalt vanadotungstates, which act as the catalysts for oxidation of methane using molecular oxygen as the oxidant without co&#8208;reductants at a low temperature of 90 oC even as low as 60 oC. This catalytic process results in the high&#8208;yield production of methanol as the major product. Micropores of the catalyst is critical for achieving high activity in the reaction, in which molecular oxygen is activated. The active species of the reaction is found to be hydroxyl&#8208;based species. VO5 with reduced V4+ and Co2+ are both crucial for generating the active species for the reaction.</dc:description>

         <title>Piezochromic Luminescence of Pyrene Derivatives&#160;Polymorphism around Excimer Forming Processs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Pyrene aggregates, as classic luminescent materials, are of great interest from a scientific viewpoint owing to the development of optoelectronic materials. In this study, we designed a compound&#160;1,4,5&#8208;triphenyl&#8208;2&#8208;(pyren&#8208;1&#8208;yl)&#8208;4,5&#8208;dihydro&#8208;1H&#8208;imidazole&#160;(IM&#8208;PY) which was achieved with two crystalline polymorphs (IMPY&#8208;G and IMPY&#8208;B). They exhibit the green emission and the blue emission, respectively, both with pyrene serving as the luminescent core. At&#160;ambient conditions, both phases exhibit &#960;&#8208;&#960;&#160;pyrene dimer stacking, but IMPY&#8208;B has the obviously smaller overlapping area and slightly shorter distance of pyrene planes than IMPY&#8208;G. During compression, the experiment results of photoluminescence, in situ UV&#8208;vis absorption, time&#8208;resolved emission, and synchrotron angular dispersive X&#8208;ray diffraction, combined with theoretical calculations indicate that IMPY&#8208;B shows a more pronounced red&#8208;shifted photoluminescence spectra and forms excimers at higher pressure than IMPY&#8208;G. This fully reflects the influence of different stacking structures on the piezochromic phenomenon of aggregates, which is beneficial for expanding the application of pyrene aggregated state.</dc:description>

         <title>Geometric Effects on C&#8208;C Coupling of Aryl&#8208;Carbenes under 2D Confinement</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>It is well established that the confinement of reactants to two dimensions influences their reactivity. However, such confinement is often dominated by charge transfer effects between the reactants and the confining walls, in particular if the walls are conductive. Also, the reactivity of carbenes on metal surfaces is significantly affected by the charge transfer between the carbene and the metal, rendering the carbene more nucleophilic or electrophilic. Here, we investigate the geometrical effects of 2D confinement without an influence of the supporting metal for a photoinduced reaction of an aryl carbene on an ionic decoupling layer. We demonstrate the decoupling concept for the C&#8211;C coupling of 3&#8208;methoxy&#8208;9&#8208;fluorenylidene (C14H10O) on a NaBr(100) bilayer on Ag(111). We combine scanning tunneling microscopy with infrared reflection absorption spectroscopy to follow the photoinduced C&#8211;C coupling of the carbene from its diazo&#8208;protected precursor in two dimensions. Our study demonstrates that the NaBr decoupling bilayer efficiently suppresses the effects of the metal surface, facilitating carbene chemistry under geometrical confinement.</dc:description>

To precisely identify how the stochastically fluctuated monomers synergistically manipulate the properties, we propose a statistic strategy over sufficient ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) samplings and for the first time uncover that synergistic oscillatory twisting (SOT) of neighboring under&#8208;strain monomers manipulates the bifunction of rubrene crystal.&#160; The under&#8208;strain trunk SOT can regulate both singlet fission (SF) and  triplet&#8208;triplet annihilation (TTA), enabling their coexistence and dominance switching by dynamically modulating the matching of excitation energies.&#160; A general rule is that small amplitude of SOT maintains the crystal TTA, while the large one boosts SF and the SF function occurs only when two neighboring monomers simultaneously have the twisting angles larger than the critical one.&#160; Temperature can govern the twisting amplitudes, thus manipulating the bifunction. These findings rationalize the experimentally observed temperature&#8208;modulated bifunction of rubrene crystal from statistical insights and proposes a combined strain&#8208;fluctuation strategy for engineering the bifunctionality of materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Tetrabutylammonium Chlorite as an Efficient Oxidant for Controlled Oxidation of Sulfides to Sulfoxides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Considering the demand for organosulfur materials and the challenges associated with currently used oxidation processes, in this study, we evaluated the counter&#8208;cation of sodium chlorite (Na+ClO2&#8211;) with tetrabutylammonium chloride (Bu4N+Cl&#8211;) to synthesise tetrabutylammonium chlorite (Bu4N+ClO2&#8211;). Bu4N+ClO2&#8211;&#160;exhibited good solubility in organic solvents like chloroform (1.6 g mL&#8211;1) and ethyl acetate (0.86 g mL&#8211;1). The oxygenation reaction of organosulfides with Bu4N+ClO2&#8211;&#160;was examined in an HCl&#8208;acidic ethyl acetate solution under ambient conditions, selectively forming the corresponding sulfoxides as mono&#8208;oxygenated products. The reaction was initiated by the formation of chlorine dioxide (ClO2&#8226;) as an oxidant and an active species generated from Bu4N+ClO2&#8211;&#160;with HCl. This oxygenation method also enables the surface oxidation of sulfide polymers like polyphenylene sulfide (PPS) resins to increase their surface hydrophilicity. Therefore, the use of Bu4N+ClO2&#8211;&#160;for applications in organic solvents is an environment&#8208;friendly, efficient, and highly selective approach for selective oxidation.</dc:description>

         <title>Overcoming the Tradeoff Between Reaction Rate and Overpotential in Dinuclear Cobalt Complex Catalyzed Electrochemical Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This study focuses on enhancing the water oxidation reaction (WOR) efficacy of dinuclear cobalt complex catalysts from both kinetic (turnover frequency, TOF) and thermodynamic (overpotential, &#951;) perspectives. For this purpose, we synthesized six dinuclear cobalt complexes 1&#8211;6 comprising non&#8208;innocent ligands with different electronically active substituents (&#8208;OMe (1), &#8208;Me (2), &#8208;H (3), &#8208;F (4), &#8208;Cl (5), and &#8208;CN (6)). The electronic effects on the electrochemical WOR under neutral, acidic, and alkaline conditions were investigated experimentally and computationally. X&#8208;ray crystallography revealed that the valence state of the cobalt complexes was affected by electronic effects, affording different catalytic potentials, as evidenced by electrochemical measurements. Kinetic and spectroscopic studies confirmed that the synergistic effect of catalyst identity and reaction media changes the reaction mechanism of each catalyst. The WOR performance of 1&#8211;6 was tunable through ligand electronics and solvent effects, with the log(TOF)&#8208;&#951; analysis highlighting an operational &#951; as low as 40 mV. This study provides valuable insights into optimizing WOR catalysis through molecular design and environmental tuning.</dc:description>

[CpFe(CO)2&#8211;(&#951;1&#8209;P4)][Al(ORF)4] with Alcohols R&#8208;OH</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The bonding situation in [Fp&#8211;P4][Al(ORF)4] (1) (Fp = (CO)2CpFe, RF = C(CF3)3) gives rise to an Umpolung of the P4 fragment, which should make it accessible for nucleophiles. To investigate this projected reactivity, the complex was combined with a series of hydroxy&#8208;nucleophiles &#8211; that all do not react with free P4 &#8211; leading to a variety of P1 building blocks. With excess of R&#8208;OH (R&#160;= Me, Et, Ph), the thermodynamically more stable complex salts [Fp&#8211;P(H)x(OR)3&#8211;x)][Al(ORF)4] (x&#160;=&#160;2,1,0) (2b&#8209;2d) are formed and show that the phosphonium type pathway is accessible. Quantum chemical calculations display a variety of reaction pathways that all lead very rapidly to the P1 building blocks. With stoichiometric amounts of R&#8208;OH, [Fp&#8211;PH3][Al(ORF)4] (2a) as well as [HP(OR)3][Al(ORF)4] (2f) were observed as products. Hence, activation of the P4&#8208;cage in complex 1 was confirmed.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Here we present a simple gold&#8208;catalyzed one&#8208;pot reaction of easily available diarylbutadiynes, with trimethoxybenzene as solvent and reactant to synthesize 4,6,8&#8208;trimethoxyazulenes. The methoxy substituents, which render the azulene very electron&#8208;rich, enable a change of azulenes typical regioselectivity for electrophilic substitutions, which enables facile electrophilic 2&#8208;substitution with iodine, bromine, chlorine, selenium or sulfur. Especially the 2&#8208;haloazulenes which can usually only be obtained through lengthy multistep syntheses are valuable building blocks for the synthesis of 2&#8208;substituted azulene derivatives.</dc:description>

         <title>Nucleophilic Functionalization of a Cationic Pentaphosphole Complex &#8211; A Systematic Study of Reactivity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The systematic nucleophilic functionalization of the cationic pentaphosphole ligand complex [Cp*Fe(&#951;4&#8208;P5Me)][OTf] (A) with group 16/17 nucleophiles is reported. This method represents a highly reliable and versatile strategy for the design of novel transition&#8208;metal complexes featuring twofold substituted end&#8208;deck cyclo&#8208;P5 ligands, bearing unprecedented hetero&#8208;element substituents. By the reaction of A with classical group 16 nucleophiles, complexes of the type [Cp*Fe(&#951;4&#8208;P5MeE)] (E = OEt (1), OtBu (2), SPh (3), SePh (4)) are obtained. By transferring this protocol to group 17 nucleophiles, the highly sensitive complexes [Cp*FeP5(&#951;4&#8208;P5MeX)] (X = F (5), Cl (6), Br (7), I (8)) could be isolated. All products show exclusively 1,1&#180;&#8208;substitution at the cyclo&#8208;P5 ring. Interestingly, further studies on the reactivity of the halogenated species revealed their ability to undergo ring&#8208;opening reactions with cyclic ethers such as THF and ethylene oxide yielding [Cp*FeP5(&#951;4&#8208;P5MeOC4H8X)] (X = Br (9), I (10)) or [Cp*FeP5(&#951;4&#8208;P5MeOC2H4X)] (X = Br (11), I (12)), respectively. Furthermore, the use of acyclic ethers such as dimethoxyethane led to the formation of [Cp*FeP5(&#951;4&#8208;P5MeOC2H4OCH3)] (13) mediated by C&#8208;O bond cleavage, followed by subsequent P&#8208;O bond formation, as further enlightened by DFT calculations.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>CO2&#8208;based hydroesterification is an attractive route to produce value added ester compounds, which could replace&#160;CO&#8208;based hydroesterification processes if sufficient catalytic technologies are developed. One path to CO2&#8208;based hydroesterification is through an organoformate intermediate, which is then used in olefin hydroesterification to generate the desirable esters.&#160; This route creates&#160;a net CO2&#8208;based hydroesterification process using tandem catalytic systems for CO2 hydrogenation to organoformate paired with formate&#8208;olefin hydroesterification. The tandem use of tripodal phosphine ruthenium(II) and 1,2&#8208;bis(di&#8208;tert&#8208;butylphosphinomethyl)benzene palladium catalysts were found to successfully produce methyl nonanoate from CO2, H2, methanol and 1&#8208;octene in a single&#8208;stage batch process. The CO2&#8208;based hydroesterification catalysis efficiency was found to be largely limited by the productivity of organoformate generation and competitive 1&#8208;octene reduction.&#160; Catalytic yields of methyl nonanoate can be enhanced by adjustments in reaction procedures, including the use of a two&#8208;stage batch reaction process or delayed introduction of 1&#8208;octene, achieving a yield of up to 32%. Under select conditions, control experiments indicate yields of methyl nonanoate can be improved to ca 75%. Preliminary studies indicate significant interplay between the two ligands employed in the molecular tandem catalytic systems and establish the first catalytic protocol for the selective CO2&#8208;based hydroesterification of olefins via organoformates.</dc:description>

A multifunctional Ru&#8722;Re complex ability to generate singlet oxygen and carbon monoxide for plaque degradation and neuroprotection. This visual metaphor emphasizes the innovative therapeutic potential of metal complexes in neurodegenerative research.







Abstract
The development of multifunctional therapeutic agents is crucial for addressing complex diseases such as Alzheimer's disease. Herein, we report a ruthenium&#8208;rhenium (Ru&#8722;Re) complex that combines photodynamic therapy (PDT) and carbon monoxide (CO) generation capabilities. The Ru&#8722;Re complex shows promising photophysical property and significant therapeutic potential. Our studies reveal the complex's ability to generate singlet oxygen (1O2), CO, inhibit tau aggregation, and enhance mitochondrial respiration. These multifunctional properties position the Ru&#8722;Re complex as a versatile tool for therapeutic applications in Alzheimer's disease.

         <title>Porous Organic Polymers for CO2 Capture and Catalytic Conversion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this review, the preparation of four types of porous organic polymers is briefly summarized, followed by a discussion of the effects of physical and chemical adsorption on carbon dioxide capture by porous materials. Finally, the effects of the type of adsorption on the chemical and photocatalytic conversion of carbon dioxide are discussed, and the prospects of chemical adsorption for carbon dioxide capture and conversion at low concentrations are presented.







Abstract
Overuse of fossil fuels and anthropogenic activities have led to excessive emissions of carbon dioxide, leading to global warming, and measures to reduce atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations are needed to overcome this global challenge. Therefore, exploring an environmentally friendly strategy for capturing airborne CO2 and converting it into high&#8208;value&#8208;added chemicals offers a promising pathway toward &#8220;carbon neutrality&#8221;. In recent years, porous organic polymers have attracted much attention for carbon capture and the catalytic conversion of carbon dioxide because of their high specific surface area, high chemical stability, nanoscale porosity, and structural versatility, which make them easy to functionalize. In this review, we introduce the preparation methods for various POPs, the types of POPs adsorbed during carbon dioxide capture, and the progress in the use of POPs for the photocatalytic and chemicatalytic conversion of carbon dioxide, with a special discussion on the influence of adsorption type on the efficiency of catalytic conversion. Finally, we propose a prospective direction for the subsequent development of this field.

         <title>Highly Selective Cytokine Induction of Nitrated Lipid&#8208;Modified &#945;&#8208;GalCer Derivatives Demonstrating High Binding Affinity to the Lipid Antigen Presenting Molecule CD1d</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel &#945;&#8208;GalCer containing natural nitro&#8208;modified fatty acyl groups were synthesized and discovered to have highly selective Th2 and Th17 cytokine induction ability. The nitroalkene group of glycolipids at the CD1d binding site is inferred to interact with polar and aromatic amino acids, leading to a significant effect on the immunomodulatory functions.







Abstract
Glycolipid antigens are presented by CD1d on antigen&#8208;presenting cells to T cell receptors (TCRs) of natural killer T (NKT) cells, leading to immune responses via cytokine induction. Although various lipid antigens have been found, there are only a limited number of glycolipid antigens having selective cytokine induction. In this study, we identified the glycolipids (&#945;&#8208;GalCer nitro&#8208;type) that exhibit highly selective induction of Th2 and Th17 type cytokines, with very high binding affinity to CD1d, by introducing nature&#8208;inspired nitro&#8208;modified fatty acyl groups. The natural nitroalkene moiety of fatty acyl groups in the glycolipids effectively enhances the affinity to CD1d through presumed hydrogen&#8208;bonding and NO2&#8211;&#960; interactions, leading to the distinctive function in cytokine induction and selectivity.

         <title>Unveiling the Potential of Thiophene&#8208;Functionalized Porous Organic Polymers for Bromine Adsorption and Selective Separation from Iodine</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bromine causes significant environmental pollution, contributes to ozone layer depletion, and coexists with iodine as IBr. In this study, we have developed an electron&#8208;rich porous organic polymer (POF&#8208;2) containing heteroatoms that effectively adsorbs bromine and shows selectivity over iodine. The efficient adsorption of bromine is facilitated by non&#8208;covalent charge transfer interaction, specifically physisorption with the POF&#8208;2 network.







Abstract
Bromine is a significant environmental threat due to its corrosive nature and contribution to ozone layer depletion. It often coexists with iodine and forms interhalogen complexes (IBr), which require an effective and selective bromine adsorption strategy. Leveraging the electrophilic nature of bromine, we designed an electron&#8208;rich thiophene&#8208;based porous organic polymer (POF&#8208;2). This material exhibits exceptional efficiency for bromine adsorption (2.86&#8197;g&#8201;g&#8722;1) and rapid uptake kinetic from aqueous solutions, driven by noncovalent charge transfer interactions. POF&#8208;2 also demonstrates selective capture of bromine from a bromine&#8208;iodine mixture in cyclohexane. The material's electron&#8208;rich sites exhibit a stronger orbital interaction with the &#963;* orbital of bromine compared to iodine, leading to the observed selectivity in cyclohexane.

         <title>The Impact of Single Amino Acid Insertion on the Supramolecular Assembly Pathway of Aromatic Peptide Amphiphiles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Elucidating supramolecular polymerization mechanisms is crucial for designing customizable supramolecular biomaterials. Here we investigate supramolecular assembly of Fmoc&#8208;L2QG with unusual concentration&#8208;dependent assembly, forming fibrous assemblies at low concentrations and metastable supramolecular droplets via liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation at higher concentrations. Inserting just one leucine unit in Fmoc&#8208;L3QG leads to competing assembly pathways, but formation of fibrous morphologies regardless of concentration.







Abstract
Understanding the mechanism of self&#8208;assembly driven by non&#8208;covalent interactions is crucial for designing supramolecular materials with desired properties. Here we investigate the self&#8208;assembly of aromatic peptide amphiphiles, Fmoc&#8208;L2QG and Fmoc&#8208;L3QG using a combination of spectroscopic, transmission electron and superresolution optical microscopy techniques. Our results show that Fmoc&#8208;L2QG leads to concentration&#8208;dependent assembly, forming fibrous assemblies at low concentrations and supramolecular droplets via liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation (LLPS) at higher concentrations. Mechanical activation using for example ultrasonication triggered the transition from metastable droplets to fibre morphologies of Fmoc&#8208;L2QG. In contrast, Fmoc&#8208;L3QG followed both on&#8208;pathway and off&#8208;pathway routes, resulting in the formation of fibrous morphologies regardless of concentration. Seeding experiments revealed that homo&#8208;seeds of the same peptide sequence accelerated the on&#8208;pathway process, while hetero&#8208;seeds of a mismatched peptide sequences accelerated the off&#8208;pathway process, highlighting the competing nature of the complex assembly profile. These findings demonstrate the significant impact of single amino acid insertion on the supramolecular assembly process of oligopeptide monomers, and highlight the potential for controlling the structure and dynamics of peptide materials. Pathway engineering of oligopeptide building blocks and multidomain supramolecular monomers will open new avenues in tailor&#8208;made and customizable supramolecular biomaterials.

Here we investigate the self-assembly of aromatic peptide amphiphiles, Fmoc-L&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;QG and Fmoc-L&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;QG using a combination of spectroscopic, transmission electron and superresolution optical microscopy techniques. Our results show that Fmoc-L&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;QG leads to concentration-dependent assembly, forming fibrous assemblies at low concentrations and supramolecular droplets via liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) at higher concentrations. Mechanical activation using for example ultrasonication triggered the transition from metastable droplets to fibre morphologies of Fmoc-L&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;QG. In contrast, Fmoc-L&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;QG followed both on-pathway and off-pathway routes, resulting in the formation of fibrous morphologies regardless of concentration. Seeding experiments revealed that homo-seeds of the same peptide sequence accelerated the on-pathway process, while hetero-seeds of a mismatched peptide sequences accelerated the off-pathway process, highlighting the competing nature of the complex assembly profile. These findings demonstrate the significant impact of single amino acid insertion on the supramolecular assembly process of oligopeptide monomers, and highlight the potential for controlling the structure and dynamics of peptide materials. Pathway engineering of oligopeptide building blocks and multidomain supramolecular monomers will open new avenues in tailor-made and customizable supramolecular biomaterials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Mechanism&#8208;Guided Development of Bifunctional Cyclooctenes as Active, Practical, and Light&#8208;Gated Bromination Catalysts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mechanistic studies guided the development of bifunctional trans&#8208;cyclooctene (TCO) catalysts bearing a functionalized benzyl group. TCO with a para&#8208;hydroxybenzyl group is particularly active, and the functionalization allowed more practical cis&#8208;cyclooctenes (CCOs) to be used as active catalysts. By using a photochemically labile masking group on the para&#8208;hydroxybenzyl substituent, the first light&#8208;gated bromination catalyst was developed, enabling spatiotemporal control of the transformation.







Abstract
Most molecular catalysts have been developed employing polar functional groups as catalytic sites. However, the use of non&#8208;polar functional groups for catalysis has received less attention due to their modest molecular interactions while the bioorthogonal reactivity of non&#8208;polar alkenes as substrates is frequently used in click chemistry. In this study, we conducted mechanistic studies on the catalysis of trans&#8208;cyclooctene (TCO) derivatives with the strained olefin as the catalytic site using kinetic and computational analyses to aid the design of more active olefin catalysts. The analysis reveals the significant role of the benzyl substituents in accelerating the generation of bromonium species through dispersion interaction in the rate&#8208;determining step. Guided by the mechanistic insights, we developed bifunctional TCO catalysts bearing a functionalized benzyl group, taking advantage of the remarkable substituent effects. Experimental studies confirmed the theoretical model and revealed that TCO with a para&#8208;hydroxybenzyl group provided excellent catalytic activity. Furthermore, inclusion of the functionalized benzyl groups allowed more readily available and robust cis&#8208;cyclooctenes to be used as active catalysts, expanding the practical utility of the olefin catalysts. By using a photochemically labile masking group on the para&#8208;hydroxybenzyl substituent, the first light&#8208;gated bromination catalyst was developed, enabling spatiotemporal control of the transformation.

         <title>Quinizarin Gold(I) N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene Complexes with Synergistic Activity Against Anthracycline&#8208;Resistant Leukaemia Cells: Synthesis and Biological Activity Studies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents new quinizarin&#8208;Au(I)&#8208;NHC complexes with high cytotoxicity against cancer cells and resistance breaking properties. Importantly, the intracellular localisation of the complex proved more important than overall cytotoxicity alone towards overcoming acquire drug resistance in two leukaemia cell models.







Abstract
New, asymmetric quinizarin&#8208;Au(I)&#8208;NHC complexes were designed, isolated, and fully characterised including by single crystal X&#8208;ray crystallography. Cytotoxicity studies showed effective growth inhibition in HeLa cervical cancer cells with IC50 values ranging from 2.4&#8197;&#956;M to 5.3&#8197;&#956;M. The successful cellular uptake was evidenced by X&#8208;ray fluorescence imaging on cryo&#8208;preserved whole HeLa cells and the sub&#8208;cellular localisation was monitored by live&#8208;cell fluorescence microscopy. Notably, complex 2&#8201;b showed circumvention of acquired anthracycline resistance in K562 leukaemia cells as well as synergistic activity with doxorubicin against both wild&#8208;type and anthracycline&#8208;resistant Nalm&#8208;6 leukaemia cells. Interestingly, sub&#8208;cellular localisation towards mitochondria proved to be more important than the compounds&#8217; overall cytotoxicity for potent antiproliferative activity and to achieve effective resistance circumvention.

         <title>Solution Processable Se&#8208;annulated Swallow Tail Perylene Bisimide Exhibiting Room Temperature Columnar Phase and Efficient Ambipolar Charge Carrier Mobility</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Selenium&#8208;annulated perylene bisimide bearing swallow tail at imide position stabilizes room temperature columnar hexagonal phase with exceptionally low clearing temperature. This compound exhibits ambipolar charge carrier mobility and distinguishes itself to an exclusive class of solution&#8208;processable, self&#8208;assembled liquid crystalline organic semiconductors.







Abstract
This study presents a selenium&#8208;annulated perylene bisimide (PBI&#8208;SeST) stabilizing room temperature columnar hexagonal phase with exceptionally low clearing temperature. The synthesis of this Se&#8208;annulated PBI (PBI&#8208;SeST) was accomplished using the reductive Cadogan cyclization method, with the introduction of swallow tails to reduce the clearing temperature and improve solubility. In addition, the charge carrier mobility of the Se&#8208;bay annulated PBI is assessed by space charge limited current (SCLC) technique and juxtaposed with PBI as well as nitrogen and sulphur&#8208;bay&#8208;annulated PBIs. It is noteworthy that all these PBIs exhibited ambipolar charge carrier mobility, a characteristic that diverges from the prevailing literature where predominantly electron transport behavior was observed for PBIs. This distinguishes them as an exclusive category of solution&#8208;processable, self&#8208;assembling organic semiconductors.

         <title>A Dual&#8208;Functional Sulfur&#8208;Rich Copolymers for Stable Anchoring and Enhanced Conversion of Polysulfide in Lithium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Fe1&#8208;xS/C dispersed and Se&#8208;containing sulfur&#8208;rich polymer was synthesized for Li&#8722;S batteries by one&#8208;pot reaction of ferrocene, trithiocyanuric acid with SexSy, which delivered a remarkable capacity of 734.7&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.2&#8197;C under high sulfur loading (4.08&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2) and low E/S ratio (6&#8197;&#956;L&#8201;mg&#8722;1).







Abstract
Sulfur&#8208;rich copolymers have gained a great deal of attention as promising cathode materials in Li&#8722;S batteries due to their low cost and naturally uniform sulfur dispersion. However, the poor electrical conductivity and shuttle effect cause rapid capacity decay and low sulfur utilization especially under high sulfur loading and low electrolyte/sulfur ratio. Herein, the Fe1&#8208;xS/C dispersed and Se&#8208;containing sulfur&#8208;rich copolymer (FSP) was synthesized by one&#8208;pot reaction of ferrocene, trithiocyanuric acid with SexSy. In such process, the trithiocyanuric acid reacts with SexSy to form Se&#8208;containing sulfur&#8208;rich copolymers. Simultaneously, ferrocene reacts with sulfur to form highly dispersed Fe1&#8208;xS/C within sulfur&#8208;rich copolymers. The covalent chemical binding of sulfur in the FSP effectively suppress the shuttle effect of polysulfides by chemical binding. Meanwhile, the Se improves the conductivity of FSP, which enhances the reaction kinetics. Moreover, the highly dispersed Fe1&#8208;xS/C in the FSP is able to effectively catalyze polysulfide conversion and inhibit the shuttle effect. As a result, the optimized FSP electrode exhibits a high capacity of 1330&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.2&#8197;C. Even under high sulfur loading (4.08&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2) and low E/S ratio (6&#8197;&#956;L&#8201;mg&#8722;1), the FSP cathode demonstrates a remarkable capacity of 734.7&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.2&#8197;C.

Dehydrogenation using Reusable Ni&#8208;immobilized MOF catalyst: Herein, we have demonstrated synthesis of a novel Ni&#8208;immobilized MOF as heterogeneous catalyst for the dehydrogenation of N&#8208;heterocycles. A series of five and six&#8208;membered N&#8208;heteroarenes were synthesized in up to 98&#8201;% yield (&gt;33 examples). Synthesis of pharmaceuticals were obtained under milder reactions conditions. Detailed characterization of the fresh catalyst and reused catalyst were performed using SEM, TEM, BET, PXRD, and EDX elemental mappings. The catalyst could be recycled up to four&#8208;times, mechanistic studies were performed including detection of H2 and H2O2 and suggested the involvement of enamine&#8208;imine intermediate species for sequential dehydrogenation.







Abstract
Herein, we have demonstrated the design and synthesis of a novel Ni&#8208;immobilized MOF as heterogeneous catalyst for the dehydrogenation of N&#8208;heterocycles. A series of five and six&#8208;membered N&#8208;heteroarenes bearing one or more heteroatoms were synthesized in up to 98&#8201;% yield (&gt;33 examples). Late stage functionalization to the synthesis of &#946;&#8208;glucuronides inhibitor, antimalarial drug quinine, and the nonsteroidal anti&#8208;inflammatory drug (NSAID) indomethacin were obtained under milder reactions conditions. A series of mechanistic studies revealed the detection of H2 and H2O2 during the progress of the reactions and suggested the involvement of enamine&#8208;imine intermediate species for sequential dehydrogenation. Detailed characterization of the fresh catalyst and reused catalyst were performed using SEM, TEM, BET, PXRD, and EDX elemental mappings. The catalyst could be recycled up to four&#8208;times without much loss in catalytic activities. In&#8208;situ formed defects, pore size enlargement and additional Lewis acid sites within catalyst nanocrystals assisted in attaining high activity and selectivity to N&#8208;heteroarenes.

         <title>Synthesis of Lewis Acid&#8208;Base Adducts Between Potassium Dihydrogenpnictogenides and Group 13 Lewis Acids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work we investigated the Lewis acid&#8208;base properties of potassium dihydrogenpnictogenides and potassium bis(trimethylsilyl)pnictogenides towards different trialkyl trieles (Triel=B&#8722;In) and BH3. The presented compounds were investigated by X&#8208;ray structure analysis, NMR spectroscopy, infrared spectroscopy and elemental analysis.







Abstract
Lewis acid&#8208;base adducts between potassium dihydrogenpnictogenides [K(18c6)PnH2] (Pn=P, As) and Trialkylgallanes (GaMe3, GaEt3, GatBu3) as well as BH3 were synthesized. In the course of these investigations, we were able to fully characterize a row of compounds of the type [K(18c6)(thf)0&#8208;2][PnH2(ER3)2] (E=B: R=H; E=Ga: R=Me, Et, tBu). Based on the successful syntheses of these species, we also synthesized several compounds of the composition [K(18c6)(thf)0&#8208;2][Pn(SiMe3)2(ER3)n] (n=1, 2) starting from [KPn(SiMe3)2] (Pn=P and As) and ER3 (E=B, Al, In: R=Me; E=Ga: R=Me, Et, tBu). All isolated compounds, were examined by NMR spectroscopy, infra&#8208;red spectroscopy and elemental analysis. A selection of the compounds presented were also examined by means of X&#8208;ray structure analysis on the single crystal. The obtained adducts of negatively charged [PnH2]&#8722; and [Pn(SiMe3)2]&#8722; fragments with Lewis acids are a class of compounds that has scarcely been investigated to date.

         <title>DiQuinoline&#8208;MonoQuinazoline: A Flat Proton Binder and its Application as a Polyaromatic Hydrocarbon Scavenger and G4 Ligand</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new miniaturized framework for graphitic material featuring three neighboring pyridinic nitrogen atoms is disclosed. The quinoline/quinazoline hybridized pseudo trimeric macrocycle, DiQuinoline(Q)&#8208;MonoQuinazolines(Qz), Q2Qz1, was readily synthesized from the key macrocyclic amide precursor in a modular fashion. Its central cavity strongly captures a proton, and the thus&#8208;formed positively charged, highly planar architecture exhibits supramolecular complexation through &#960;&#8208;interactions. Q2Qz1, with its unique properties, was applied as a scavenger for toxic polyaromatic hydrocarbons and as a G&#8208;quartet ligand for potential therapeutic agent for cancer chemotherapy.

         <title>Improved H2O2 Photogeneration on KBr Doped&#8208;Polymeric Carbon Nitride Via Optimize the Oxygen Reduction Path</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this paper, K and Br doped carbon nitride&#8208;based photocatalysts were synthesized by one&#8208;pot method, which is conducive to the transmission of space charge and oxygen activation, promotes the efficient production of H2O2 by 2e&#8722;ORR.







Abstract
The photosynthesis of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) from oxygen (O2) represents a promising catalytic pathway, the limited efficiency of the oxygen reduction constitutes a primary barrier to enhancing production. In this content, alkali metal potassium (K+) and Br&#8208;doped g&#8208;C3N4 photocatalysts (K&#8208;CN) were successfully constructed by one&#8208;pot method. The introduction of K+ is not only beneficial to the transmission of space charge and the separation efficiency of photogenerated carriers, but also promotes the efficient production of H2O2 by 2e&#8722; oxygen reduction reaction. The introduction of Br&#8722; promotes O2 converted to triplet state and triggers energy transfer process to increase 1O2 production, O2 adsorption was facilitated through regulating the oxygen evolution (O2&#8594;1O2), which is beneficial to the subsequent oxygen reduction process. The results showed that the H2O2 yield of 0.05&#8197;K&#8208;CN catalyst reached 26.0&#8197;mmol&#8197;g&#8722;1&#8197;h&#8722;1, which was more than 5 times that of pure g&#8208;C3N4.

         <title>Electrochemically mediated synthesis of cyanated heterocycles from &#945;&#8208;amino esters, pyridine&#8208;2&#8208;carbaldehydes and NH4SCN as cyano group source</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The electrochemically mediated cyanation/annulation process with in situ cyanide ion generation from NH4SCN and multi&#8208;step oxidative construction of CN&#8208;functionalized heterocycles from easily available &#945;&#8208;amino esters and pyridine&#8208;2&#8208;carbaldehydes has been discovered. Depending on the nature of the &#945;&#8208;amino ester, 1&#8208;cyano&#8208;imidazo[1,5&#8208;a]pyridine&#8208;3&#8208;carboxylates, 3&#8208;alkyl&#8208; and 3&#8208;aryl&#8208;imidazo[1,5&#8208;a]pyridines&#8208;1&#8208;carbonitriles, and the first reported 4&#8208;oxo&#8208;4H&#8208;pyrido[1,2&#8208;a]pyrazine&#8208;1&#8208;carbonitriles were obtained. The electrosynthesis is carried out in an undivided electrochemical cell under constant current conditions. The success of the discovered electrochemical synthesis is based on the combination of two anodic processes: oxidation of SCN anion to CN anion and oxidation of C&#8208;N bonds to C=N bonds during heterocycle construction. Mechanistic studies based on CV measurements, and control experiments confirm the generation of [CN] species from NH4SCN with subsequent addition to an imine formed from &#945;&#8208;amino esters and pyridine&#8208;2&#8208;carbaldehyde. Computational analysis suggests that for reactive intermediates from glycine esters, the subsequent 5&#8208;endo&#8208;trig cyclization leading to 1&#8208;cyano&#8208;imidazo[1,5&#8208;a]pyridine&#8208;3&#8208;carboxylates is more favourable and the 6&#8208;exo&#8208;trig cyclization leading to 4&#8208;oxo&#8208;4H&#8208;pyrido[1,2&#8208;a]pyrazine&#8208;1&#8208;carbonitriles is less favourable. For &#945;&#8208;amino esters with alkyl or aryl substituents, both cyclization pathways are relatively thermodynamically possible. The leading 4&#8208;oxo&#8208;4H&#8208;pyrido[1,2&#8208;a]pyrazine&#8208;1&#8208;carbonitrile showed high fungicidal activity against phytopathogenic fungi.</dc:description>

         <title>Oxidative Neutralisation of Sulfur&#8208;based Chemical Warfare Agents Mediated by a Lipase: from Batch to Flow Reactor</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The sulfur&#8208;containing chemical warfare agents sulfur mustard HD and nerve agent VX are highly toxic and persistent in the environment. Therefore, their neutralisation requires harsh oxidation conditions, but also precise selectivity. Here we report the safe and effective detoxification of surrogates CEES and PhX by selective oxidation of the sulfur atom by generating peracetic acid from AcOEt and aq. H2O2 assisted by the supported lipase CALB. Morever, it is possible to perform these neutralisations with safe &#8216;on demand&#8217; generation of AcOOH in a flow system by using a packed bed reactor containing the supported biocatalyst.</dc:description>

         <title>Photoredox&#8208;Catalyzed 1,4&#8208;Dichloromethyldimerization of Alkenes with Chloroform: Access to Polychlorinated Vicinal Diaryl Alkanes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A visible&#8208;light&#8208;mediated strategy is reported for the direct synthesis of polychlorinated vicinal diaryl alkanes from aryl alkenes and chloroform. In this approach, two haloalkyl radicals generated from chloroform via halogen atom transfer (XAT) and direct single electron transfer (SET) within the same photoredox catalysis cycle enable the 1,4&#8208;dichloromethyldimerization of alkenes. Besides chloroform, this strategy is applicable to carbon tetrachloride, bromotrichloromethane, and &#945;&#8208;bromo carboxylic esters, yielding corresponding 1,4&#8208;disubstituted vicinal diaryl alkanes. Diverse polychlorinated structures containing highly congested vicinal quaternary carbon centers are effectively synthesized by this method. The potential of this reaction in late&#8208;stage drug modification is highlighted by the successful transformation of olefins with pharmaceutical structures.</dc:description>

         <title>Structures of Gas&#8208;Phase Hydrated Phosphotyrosine Revealed by Soft X&#8208;ray Action Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Gas&#8208;phase near&#8208;edge X&#8208;ray absorption mass spectrometry (NEXAMS) was employed at the carbon and oxygen K&#8208;edges to probe the influence of a single water molecule on
the protonated phosphotyrosine molecule. The results of the photodissociation experiments revealed that the water molecule forms two bonds, with the phosphate group and
another chemical group. By comparing the NEXAMS spectra at the carbon and oxygen K&#8208;edges with density functional theory calculations, we attributed the electronic transitions
responsible for the observed resonances, especially the transitions due to the presence of the water molecule. We showed that the water molecule leads to a specific spectral
feature in the partial ion yield of hydrated fragments at 536.4 eV. Moreover, comparing the NEXAMS spectra with the calculated structures allowed us to identify three
possible structures for singly hydrated phosphotyrosine that agree with the observed fragmentation and resonances.</dc:description>

         <title>A Fluorescent Probe Differentiates Apoptosis from Cysteine&#8208;Deprivation Ferroptosis through Imaging of Viscosity and Lipid Droplets</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Since death is an inevitable phenomenon, exploring cell deaths holds importance. During this process, the cellular microenvironment within cells such as pH, polarity, viscosity etc alter. One such microenvironment, viscosity elevates during different cell deaths. However, demarcating cell death processes solely based on viscosity sensing is challenging. Herein, we develop a unique fluorescent probe PS&#8208;NAP after careful investigation among three analogues for efficient viscosity imaging in HeLa cells. Cationic PS&#8208;NAP, a MMP independent molecular probe, can potentially target mitochondria and map elevated mitochondrial viscosity during apoptosis, starvation and drug induced ferroptosis processes. Notably, during ferroptosis induced by cysteine deprivation, PS&#8208;NAP exclusively colocalizes in newly generated lipid droplets (LDs) instead of mitochondria. Thus, the probe has a potential for demarcating cysteine deprivation&#8208;induced ferroptosis from other cellular stresses such as apoptosis.</dc:description>

         <title>Impact of Structural Subtleties on Chirality Induction and Amplification in Trizinc(II)porphyrin Trimers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we report the precise control of molecular to supramolecular chirality induction at the single&#8208;molecule level just upon subtle modification in an achiral &#8216;nano&#8208;size&#8217; trizinc(II) porphyrin trimer. A slight variation in the projection of the substituent at the periphery of the central porphyrin unit in a porphyrin trimer (host) resulted in pronounced changes in the interchromophoric arrangement, leading to distinct &#8216;open&#8217; and &#8216;closed&#8217; conformations. While &#8216;open&#8217; form generates &#8216;monomeric&#8217; complex with low CD amplitude, &#8216;closed&#8217; form produces exclusive &#8216;polymer&#8217; with large, amplified CD signal with opposite sign due to stronger intermolecular excitonic coupling. Also, the sign of the CD couplets is just opposite between R and S substrates for both polymer and monomer which suggest that the chirality is predominantly governed by the stereogenic projection of the chiral center. X&#8208;ray structures of the host and polymer have been reported here. Crystallographic characterization offers a detailed perspective on the structural and geometrical transformations in the polymer, enabling a systematic understanding of its optical properties. DFT and TD&#8208;DFT calculations strongly corroborate with the experimental findings.</dc:description>

Also, the sign of the CD couplets is just opposite between R and S substrates for both polymer and monomer which suggest that the chirality is predominantly governed by the stereogenic projection of the chiral center. X-ray structures of the host and polymer have been reported here. Crystallographic characterization offers a detailed perspective on the structural and geometrical transformations in the polymer, enabling a systematic understanding of its optical properties. DFT and TD-DFT calculations strongly corroborate with the experimental findings.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Photoresponsive Helical Foldamers: Conformational Control through Double Helix Formation and Light&#8208;Induced Protonation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Helical foldamers constitute particularly relevant targets in the field of host&#8208;guest chemistry, be that as hosts or substrates. In this context, the strategies reported so far to control the dimensions and shape of foldamers mainly involve modifications of the skeleton through covalent synthesis. Herein, we prepared an oligopyridine dicarboxamide foldamer substituted by photo&#8208;active tetraphenylethylenes (TPE). We demonstrate that it is possible to toggle the length of a helical foldamer by two means. First, the elongation of foldamers can be tuned by adjusting the concentration, as demonstrated by DOSY NMR spectroscopy and X&#8208;ray diffraction analyses on both the single and the double helix structures. Secondly, and in a more original manner, a photo&#8208;induced protonation process triggered by TPE units promotes a novel pathway to unfold helical foldamers, leading to dramatic conformational and spectroscopic changes.</dc:description>

         <title>Stereospecific Radical Bromination of &#223;&#8208;Aryl Alcohols with Thiourea Additives Through A Serendipitous Discovery of A 1,2&#8208;Aryl Migration</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of new protocols for stereospecific and stereoselective halogenation transformations by mild reaction conditions is a highly desirable research target for the chemical and pharmaceutical industries. Following the straightforward methodology for directly transforming a wide scope of alcohols to alkyl bromides and chlorides using substoichiometric amounts of thioureas and N&#8208;halo succinimides (NXS) as a halogen source in a single step, we noticed that in apolar solvents bromination of chiral secondary alcohols did not produce the expected racemates. In this study, the stereochemical aspects of the bromination reaction were examined. Surprisingly, bromination of (&#177;)&#8208;threo&#8208; or (&#177;)&#8208;erythro&#8208;3&#8208;phenyl&#8208;2&#8208;butanols revealed a single diastereomeric brominated product with retention of configuration. The scope of these reactions was expanded on several &#223;&#8208;aryl alcohols. During these studies, an unexpected stereospecific 1,2&#8208;migration of the phenyl group was shown to take place. The proposed mechanism of the 1,2&#8208;phenyl migration involves the formation of a spiro[2,5]octadienyl radical, which is then attacked by a bromide radical at any of the two cyclopropyl positions. Both 1,2&#8208;phenyl migration and bromination occur with double inversion of configuration, leading to products that retain the stereoisomeric configuration of the starting material.</dc:description>

         <title>Reversed Allylation of 3&#8208;Alkenyl Indoles Using Allyl Boronic Acids: Access to Tryptamine Based Alkaloids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>All&#8208;carbon quaternary and tertiary stereocenters connected at the C2&#8208;position of functionalizable C3&#8208;alkylated indole nucleus are commonly occurring frameworks found in many indole alkaloids of medicinal importance. Their direct access is scarcely reported, a long&#8208;standing problem, and developing a unique yet simple method can pave the pathway to an entirely different retrosynthetic route for the total synthesis of these alkaloids. Herein, this problem is addressed by developing an unprecedented branch&#8208;selective allylation strategy employing a broad range of structurally and electronically different 3&#8208;alkenyl&#8208;indoles and allylboronic acids. The use of readily accessible starting precursors renders this method attractive for the total synthesis of indole alkaloids. The present strategy shows excellent functional group tolerance, atom economic, redox&#8208;neutral, scalable and easy to operate. The DFT calculation on the possible transition states indicated that allylboronic acid acts as a nucleophile rather than a more reactive boroxine. Mechanistically, this strategy is designed by exploiting the loss as well as regaining the indole&#8217;s aromaticity. The utility of this method is demonstrated in the total syntheses of seven prenylated tryptamine alkaloids and the first total syntheses of dimeric indole alkaloids, fluevirines E and mucronatin B.</dc:description>

         <title>The Doping of Al3+ at the Tetrahedral Site of Spinel Mn3O4 for Electrocatalytic Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Spinel oxides have attracted much attention in electrocatalytic water oxidation. Specially, the Mn&#8208;based spinel structures merits fundamental investigation, as Mn is involved in water oxidation in natural photosynthesis. Herein, Al&#8208;doped Mn3O4 spinel electrocatalyst was prepared for water oxidation. The Al cations selectively occupy the tetrahedral sites of Mn3O4 spinel structure, leaving Mn(III) at the catalytically critical octahedral sites. The substitution of Al3+ regulated the electronic structure of Mn3O4, induced lattice distortion and produced higher concentration of oxygen vacancy to promote the water oxidation performance.</dc:description>

         <title>pH&#8208; and Saccharide&#8208;Responsive&#160;Cyclometalated Iridium(III) Complexes with Boronic Acid Moieties Displaying a Wide Range of Phosphorescence Colors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Single compounds displaying a wide range of luminescent colors are attractive optical materials for sensor applications. In this study, we present the beneficial combination of a cyclometalated iridium(III) complex scaffold and boronic acid units for designing stimuli&#8208;responsive luminescent materials with various emission colors. Five iridium(III) complexes bearing a diboronic acid ligand (bpyB2) were synthesized: Ir(C^N)bpyB2 (C^N = 2&#8208;phenylpyridine (1), 2&#8208;(2,4&#8208;difluorophenyl)pyridine (2), 2&#8208;(4&#8208;methoxyphenyl)pyridine (3), benzo[h]quinoline (4), 1&#8208;phenylisoquinoline (5)). The luminescence color of Complexes 1&#8211;4 changed in response to the solution pH or saccharide concentration. Complex 1 exhibited a color change from orange to green&#8208;blue due to structural alteration of the boronic acid moiety from trigonal to tetrahedral. Furthermore, the luminescence color of Complex 1 changed reversibly due to repetitive changes in the solution pH between 5 and 10, enabling tuning of the luminescence color and pH tracking. Furthermore, the color range was tuned by selecting an appropriate C^N ligand. Time&#8208;dependent density functional theory investigations revealed that the dramatic and reversible color changes could be ascribed to a switch in the electronic distribution in the lowest excited state from bpyB2 to C^N. The stimulus&#8208;responsive iridium(III) complexes provide a prospective scaffold for future applications in color&#8208;tunable optical devices and chemosensing systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Deciphering the Role of Crown&#8208;ether Receptor Orientation in C&#8208;H Oxidation Catalyzed by Supramolecular Nonheme FeIV(O) Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The outstanding efficiency and selectivity of enzymatic reactions, such as C&#8208;H oxidation by nonheme iron oxygenases, stems from a precise control of substrate positioning inside the active site. The resulting proximity between a specific moiety (a certain C&#8208;H bond) to the reactant (a FeIV(O) active species) translates into higher rates and selectivity, that can be in part replicated also with artificial supramolecular catalysts. However, structural modification of the position and orientation of the binding site both in enzymes and in artificial catalysts often leads to significant variations in reactivity that can be difficult to rationalize due to the system's complexity. Herein, we quantitatively analyzed the impact of such a structural modification (namely receptor orientation) on the C&#8208;H oxidation reactivity (kinetics, Effective Molarity) and selectivity by comparing simple supramolecular FeIV(O) models. Overall, we did not observe significant differences in reaction rates, but we noticed slight changes in the selectivity profile. These results indicate that, when a crown&#8208;ether is employed as a recognition site, the key ingredient for enhanced reactivity is the presence of the supramolecular receptor itself rather than its exact orientation, providing a guide for the rational design of supramolecular catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Intramolecular Inhibition by Imidazole in Acid&#8208;Catalyzed Hydrolysis of Protected Carbohydrates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The present study reveals an unexpected anomaly observed in the acid&#8208;catalyzed hydrolysis of the 5,6&#8208;O&#8208;isopropylidene group in 3&#8208;O&#8208;protected D&#8208;gluco&#8208; and D&#8208;allofuranose derivatives. Although the removal of the 5,6&#8208;O&#8208;isopropylidene protecting group is typically rapid and quantitative under acidic conditions, an unexpected inhibition of this reaction is observed for the two C3&#8208;epimers, 3&#8208;O&#8208;imidazole sulfonyl moiety. X&#8208;ray data show a two&#8208;faced imidazole ring orientation in the crystal, while solution state NOE data reveal a critical interaction type between the isopropylidene and the imidazole rings. Advanced conformational searches coupled with ab initio molecular modeling illuminate and explain the NMR and kinetic data, and lay the groundwork for the most plausible mechanism of this unprecedented inhibition. These results provide valuable insights into the cross&#8208;coupling of carbohydrate O&#8208;protecting groups and shed light on how specific ring orientations and steric effects can trigger the inhibition of an otherwise easily feasible reaction, such as an acid&#8208;catalyzed hydrolysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Unravelling the Relaxation Pathway and Excited State Dynamics of Ruthenium(II) Polypyridyl Complexes Incorporating Phosphorus&#8208;Based Monodentate Ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, the photophysical, photochemical properties and photogenerated excited state dynamics of two new Ru(II) complexes, viz. [Ru(p&#8208;ttp)(bpy)(PTA)]2+ [1]2+, [Ru(p&#8208;ttp)(phen)(PTA)]2+ [2]2+ having a phosphorus&#8208;based ligand PTA [p&#8208;ttp = p&#8208;tolyl terpyridine; bpy = 2,2&#8217;&#8208;bipyridyl; phen = 1,10&#8208;phenthroline and PTA = 1,3,5&#8208;triaza&#8208;7&#8208;phosphaadamantane] are reported. Upon excitation with 470 nm LED, [1]2+ and [2]2+ neither undergo ligand release nor exhibit room temperature luminescence/1O2 generation. However, when excited around their respective MLCT bands at 77 K, luminescence bands ~600 nm were observed. N&#8208;methylation of the coordinated PTA in complex [1]2+ resulted in [Ru(p&#8208;ttp)(bpy)(MePTA]3+ {[1&#8208;Me]3+} (MePTA = N&#8208;methyl&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triaza&#8208;7&#8208;phosphaadamantane). The difference in photophysical and electrochemical properties of [1]2+ and [1&#8208;Me]3+ was rationalized by DFT calculations. Transient absorption spectroscopic analysis to unravel the relaxation pathway of&#160;complexes suggested the involvement of the 3MC state in the relaxation process. The effect of electronic modulation resulted from the N&#8208;methylation of PTA on the excited state dynamics of the complexes was observed. MTT assays in various cancer cells revealed their non&#8208;cytotoxic nature in the dark or upon irradiation with 470 nm blue LED. The non&#8208;toxicity of the complexes, despite being internalized in cancer cells as established by ICP&#8208;MS, is attributed to their dark and photostability and the inability to generate 1O2.</dc:description>

         <title>Anodic Activation of Prussian Blue Analog Leads to Highly Active Cobalt&#8208;doped Nickel (Oxy)hydroxide for Organic Oxidation Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Water&#8208;assisted electrocatalytic oxidation of alcohols into valuable chemicals is a promising strategy to circumvent the sluggish kinetics of water oxidation, while also reducing cell voltage and improving energy efficiency. Recently, transition metal (TM)&#8208;based catalysts have been investigated for anodic alcohol oxidation, but success has been limited due to competition from the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) within the working regime. In this study, NiCo&#8208;based Prussian blue analog (PBA) was electrochemically activated at the anodic potential to produce a Co&#8208;Ni(O)OH active catalyst with a nanosheet&#8208;like architecture. This catalyst was further employed for the selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol (PhCH2OH) to benzoic acid (PhCOOH), achieving a 97% Faradaic efficiency (FE). The electrochemical activity of Co&#8208;Ni(O)OH was also compared with hydrothermally prepared CoNi&#8208;LDH, demonstrating that the PBA&#8208;derived Co&#8208;Ni(O)OH was more effective.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this study, a supramolecular fluorescent material was constructed by using double&#8208;cavity twisted cucurbit[14]uril (tQ[14]) and positively charged Astrazon Pink FG (APFG) based on the non&#8208;covalent host&#8208;guest interaction for the first time. The thermodynamic parameters of the APFG@tQ[14] in aqueous solution were determined by isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC), the results indicated that the spontaneous assembly of APFG@tQ[14] is mainly driven by enthalpy. The intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) effect induced the APFG@tQ[14] probe to emit a strong orange&#8208;red fluorescence. Due to its good optical properties and low toxicity, APFG@tQ[14] was successfully applied to multi&#8208;channel imaging of HK2 cells. This demonstrates the great potential of APFG@tQ[14] in labeling and tracking living cells.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Investigating the correlation between metal coordination and molecular conductivity in single&#8208;molecule systems is essential for advancing our knowledge of molecular electronics, particularly in the realm of spintronics. In the present study, we developed two complex wires utilizing the bipyridine ligand and two transition metal ions, Co2+ and Zn2+, aiming to study the impact of different spin characters on single&#8208;molecule charge transport properties. Single&#8208;molecule conductance was investigated using scanning tunnelling microscope breaking junctions (STM&#8208;BJ) technique and the underlying mechanism was analysed by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. We demonstrated that the conductance predominantly increases after inserting Zn2+, indicating a conducting channel has been constructed. In contrast, the conductance of the analogue coordinated with Co2+ does not change significantly, this can be explained by distinct disparities between spin&#8208;up and spin&#8208;down channels, in which destructive quantum interference in spin&#8208;down state counteracts the enhancement of molecular conductance. Our study establishes the groundwork for a systematic approach to the design, fabrication, and implementation of single&#8208;complex conductance explorations.</dc:description>

         <title>Convergent Total Synthesis of Ixabepilone and Its Analogues Enabled by Highly Efficient Asymmetric Hydrogenations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The convergent total synthesis of ixabepilone and its analogues in a 13&#8208;step longest linear sequence is reported. The crucial chiral centers at challenging C3&#8208;O, C8&#8208;C and C15&#8208;N positions on the scaffold of the ixabepilone were installed via highly efficient asymmetric hydrogenations (up to 95% yield and up to 99% e.e.) and all three fragments could be prepared on gram scale. The key aldol reaction bridges the aldehyde and keto fragments with high yield and exquisite diastereo control (8:1 d.r.). Finally, a novel RCM reaction conformationally controlled by a bulky silyl group was reported, which allows the facile synthesis of ixabepilone and its analogues.</dc:description>

         <title>A Prebiotic Route to Lactate from Acetaldehyde, Cyanide and Carbon Dioxide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide (CO2) has fluctuated throughout Earth's history. However, the role of CO2 in prebiotic chemistry has predominantly been limitedly postulated as a C1 precursor, which can be reduced to carbon monoxide or methane mimicking the Wood&#8208;Ljungdahl pathway. Herein we present neglected roles of CO2 as an active promoter in accessing biologically important C3&#8208;builidng blocks such as lactate, via redox&#8208;economic reaction cycles from cyanide (C1) and acetaldehyde (C2). We verified that Lewis acidic CO2 facilitates the formation of cyanohydrin of acetaldehyde under ambient conditions. Furthermore, selective protection of cyanohydrin to carbonates by atmospheric CO2 led to anchimeric assisted hydrolysis of the nitrile group to generate lactate. This work supports both warm pond and hydrothermal vent hypotheses, postulating that a CO2&#8208;rich primordial atmosphere and the acidic aqueous solution could have fostered the emergence of biologically relevant molecules and life itself.</dc:description>

         <title>Zinc Sensing with Pyridine&#8208;Based Lanthanide Contrast Agent: Structural Analysis in Aqueous Solution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Zinc is an important physiological cation, and its misregulation is implicated in various diseases. It is therefore important to be able to image zinc by non&#8208;invasive methods such as Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). In this work, we have successfully synthesized a novel Gd3+&#8208;based complex specifically for Zn2+ sensing by MRI. Using a combination of NMR, luminescence, potentiometric, and relaxivity experiments, completed with DFT calculations, we demonstrate that incorporating a short linker between the Zn2+ sensing unit and the Gd3+ complex leads to unique behavior of the system in the absence of Zn2+. A significant increase in efficacy of the system is observed upon Zn2+ binding, and importantly, the complex is highly selective for Zn2+ relative to other physiological cations. A comprehensive structural study reliably determines the microscopic parameters at the origin of the Zn2+ response, primarily an increase in the number of water molecules directly coordinated to Gd3+ upon Zn2+ binding. Crucially, the system maintains a strong response to Zn2+ binding in the presence of Human Serum Albumin, highlighting its potential for biological applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Recent Progress in Atomically Precise Cu&#8208;M Alloy Nanoclusters</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal nanoclusters (NCs) with dimensions of approximately 3 nm serve as a crucial link between metal&#8208;organic complexes and metal nanoparticles, garnering significant interest due to their distinctive molecule&#8208;like characteristics. These include well&#8208;defined molecular structures, clear HOMO&#8211;LUMO transitions, quantized charge, and robust luminescence emission. Atomically precise alloy NCs, in contrast to homometallic NCs, exhibit a wealth of structures and intriguing properties, with their novel attributes often intricately tied to the positions of alloyed elements within the structure, facilitating the exploration of structure&#8208;property relationships. A notable subgroup within this category comprises Cu&#8211;M (where M represents metals such as Au, Ag, Rh, Ir, Pd, Pt, Zn, Al etc.) alloy NCs. In this review, we initially outline recent advancements in the development of efficient synthetic techniques for Cu&#8208;M alloy NCs, emphasizing the underlying physical and chemical properties that enable precise control over their sizes and surface characteristics. Subsequently, we delve into recent progress in structural elucidation techniques for Cu&#8208;M alloy NCs. This structural insight is instrumental in comprehensively understanding the structure&#8208;property correlations at the molecular level. Finally, we showcase various examples of Cu&#8208;M alloy NCs to illustrate their photoluminescent and catalytic properties, shedding light on their diverse functionalities and potential applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Electronic Buffering Mechanism Enhances Stability and Water Oxidation Efficiency of CeO2@NiFe&#8208;LDH</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nickel&#8208;iron layered double hydroxide shows significant promise as an electrocatalyst in facilitating oxygen evolution reactions. But its development is hindered by low conductivity and insufficient cycling stability. Herein, the synthesis of a hierarchically structured heterostructure catalyst, CeO2@NiFe LDH, is reported through a straightforward two&#8208;step process involving hydrothermal treatment. The catalyst realizes a significant breakthrough in OER catalytic performance and stability. At a current density of 100 mA cm&#8208;2, the overpotentials amount to 255 mV in 1 M KOH, 263 mV in simulated seawater with alkaline conditions, and 346 mV in actual alkaline seawater. After 200 hours of continuous operation under high current density in simulated alkaline seawater, the morphology with no significant alterations observed, highlighting its high stability in complex seawater environments. Introducing CeO2 optimizes the binding energy of the OH intermediate, which facilitates the formation and dissociation of the OOH intermediate. In situ Raman analysis demonstrates the positive impact of CeO2 on the generation of active species. This research emphasizes the efficacy of CeO2 in improving the performance and durability of NiFe LDH for oxygen evolution reactions.</dc:description>
