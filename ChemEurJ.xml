         <title>Next Generation Hosts for Protein Recognition, Assembly and More</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The original design of synthetic receptors for proteins was based on macrocycles with a hydrophobic core and a polar/charged periphery. This design, geared towards protein recognition, facilitates receptor self&#8208;assembly. Macrocycle oligomerization, in turn, contributes to protein assembly as evidenced in many cocrystal structures. Future synthetic receptors that expand on this principle may prove useful in fabricating new types of biomaterials.








ABSTRACT
This Perspective describes an apparent transition in the design and function of synthetic receptors for proteins. It is shown that the original receptor design, geared toward protein recognition, lends itself also to receptor self&#8208;assembly and concomitant protein assembly. While evidence for this effect has lain somewhat dormant for two decades, numerous recent examples raise interesting possibilities for innovation in protein binding, encapsulation, and crystal engineering. In a bid to inspire future research and collaboration, I speculate on new receptor designs. Considering current developments with nanocarbon hosts, anionic variants might facilitate protein assembly and the bottom&#8208;up fabrication of hybrid materials.

         <title>Artificial Intelligence Tools for Drug Target Discovery Research: Database, Tools, Applications, and Challenges</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review provides a comprehensive summary of key computational methods, databases, and tools, along with practical guidance to facilitate the application of artificial intelligence in drug target discovery.








ABSTRACT
The identification of drug targets remains one of the most critical challenges in pharmaceutical research. The rapid progress of artificial intelligence (AI) is significantly advancing this landscape by enabling more efficient and accurate drug&#8208;target interaction prediction. AI&#8208;driven approaches can integrate and analyze massive biomedical datasets, elucidating complex signaling networks and providing systematic insights into drug mechanisms of action. These developments have greatly accelerated virtual screening, binding affinity estimation, and target identification. However, despite these advancements, key challenges persist, such as ensuring the precision of predictions and overcoming the barriers to integrating AI tools with drug target discovery. This review provides a comprehensive overview of recent public databases, advanced computational methods, and user&#8208;friendly AI tools, highlighting both their potential and challenges. It also offers practical guidance for researchers without computational expertise, illustrating how these technologies can be effectively incorporated into current research workflows to advance drug target discovery and ultimately accelerate the development of novel therapeutic drugs.

         <title>The One&#8208;Step Synthesis of Biologically Active Isochromans from Lignin&#8208;Derived Aromatic Monomers in Tunable Deep Eutectic Solvents</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A straightforward one&#8208;step protocol enables the synthesis of bio&#8208;based and biologically active isochromans through the Oxa&#8208;Pictet cyclization involving diverse aldehydes, including vanillin in combination with lignin&#8208;derivable homovanillyl alcohol, a prominent aromatic platform chemical obtainable via diol&#8208;assisted fractionation of lignocellulose, employing tunable deep eutectic solvents as benign reaction media.








ABSTRACT
Clean synthetic strategies that embrace the inherent structural features of renewable building blocks to obtain biologically active compounds hold great potential to improve the economic viability of emerging biorefineries. Importantly, such an approach is highly beneficial for the sustainable manufacturing of pharmaceutically relevant molecules. Here, we demonstrate a one&#8208;step protocol toward biologically active isochromans through the Oxa&#8208;Pictet cyclization involving both aromatic aldehydes, including vanillin, and aliphatic aldehydes in combination with lignin&#8208;derivable homovanillyl alcohol (1), a prominent aromatic platform chemical obtainable via diol&#8208;assisted fractionation. Employing tunable deep eutectic solvents as benign reaction media allows for modulating reactivity under mild reaction conditions, and opens access to a library of isochromans in a single step. Several compounds exhibit promising properties, including PPI inhibition, anticancer, and antibacterial activities, highlighting the benefits of this synthetic strategy and its potential for drug discovery.

         <title>Strategies for Enhancing SiO2 Chemical&#8208;Mechanical Polishing (CMP): Functional Nanoparticle Abrasive Design and Integration</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Progress in SiO2 chemical mechanical polishing is increasingly driven by functional nanoparticle abrasives. This review surveys materials beyond ceria including silica, alumina, zirconia, titania, and nonoxides emphasizing how morphology, size, composition, and friction mechanism control can be engineered to improve removal rate, selectivity, and surface quality in advanced integrated circuit fabrication.








ABSTRACT
With the continuous scaling and integration of semiconductor devices, the demand for advanced chemical&#8208;mechanical polishing (CMP) has increased significantly. Consequently, the limitations of conventional abrasives have become increasingly evident, prompting a growing need for next&#8208;generation slurries with improved material removal rates, surface roughness, defectivity, and selectivity. This review investigates the physicochemical properties of both ceria&#8208;based and nonceria&#8208;based nanoparticle abrasives and critically examines recent advances in their application to SiO2 CMP. Emphasis is placed on understanding how these materials contribute to performance enhancement through chemical interactions, mechanical properties, and structural design. Our findings suggest that overcoming the limitations of the existing slurry systems may require a paradigm shift from relying on single&#8208;component abrasives to engineering composite systems with complementary functionalities. Such integrated abrasive design strategies present a practical route toward more reliable and effective CMP solutions for future semiconductor fabrication.

         <title>Bottom&#8208;Up Approach for the Synthesis of Contorted Nanographenes by Cp*Co(III)&#8208;Catalyzed Annulative&#8208;&#960;&#8208;Extension&#8208;Cyclization Cascade</title>

         <dc:description>
An unprecedented bottom&#8208;up strategy for the rapid construction of PAHs is developed by employing arene&#8208;derived ketones and carbon&#8208;rich 1,3&#8208;diynes. Many of these synthesized PAHs have tilted &#960;&#8208;electronic structure, unique edges and topologies. Electronic nature of the 1,3&#8208;diynes guided the final mode of cyclization leading to the formal fusing of one fluorene moiety via 5&#8208;exo&#8208;dig cyclization or phenanthrene nucleus through 6&#8208;endo&#8208;dig cyclization.








ABSTRACT
In the domain of bottom&#8208;up approach, regioselective fusion of aromatic moiety onto an arene templet remains scarcely explored, yet represents a crucial tool for the rapid generation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). An unprecedented bottom&#8208;up strategy for the rapid construction of PAHs is developed by employing arene&#8208;derived ketones and carbon&#8208;rich 1,3&#8208;diynes. Many of these synthesized PAHs have tilted &#960;&#8208;electronic structure, unique edges and topologies. A range of arene&#8208;derived ketones participated in this annulative&#8208;&#960;&#8208;extension&#8208;cyclization cascade under first&#8208;row Co(III)&#8208;catalysis. Electronic nature of the 1,3&#8208;diynes guided the final mode of cyclization leading to the formal fusing of one fluorene moiety via 5&#8208;exo&#8208;dig cyclization or phenanthrene nucleus through 6&#8208;endo&#8208;dig cyclization. Intermediate ethynyl&#8208;PAHs were also isolated in case of relatively electron&#8208;deficient diynes. The contorted &#960;&#8208;planes of the synthesized PAHs were elucidated by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray analysis. Detailed DFT studies reinforce the proposed mechanistic pathway, validating the formation of the major regioisomer of PAHs. Furthermore, less aromatic character of fluorene moiety over phenanthrene nucleus is supported by the NICS(1)zz and ACID calculations.

         <title>Evolved DNAzymes and Stable Activation Chemistry Enable High&#8208;Efficiency DNA Ligation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In vitro selection of pre&#8208;structured DNA libraries and chemical screening of alternative activation groups yielded trans&#8208;acting DNAzymes with faster ligation rates and enhanced DNA substrate stability. The combination of C3S1 DNAzymes and phosphobenzimidazole&#8208;activated DNA substrates provides improved DNA ligation performance, offering promise for applications such as DNA data storage.








ABSTRACT
DNA ligation is a fundamental reaction used in a variety of applications, typically performed by T4 DNA ligase. For certain applications, such as DNA data storage, DNA&#8208;ligating DNAzymes offer a more stable and cost&#8208;effective alternative to protein enzymes. The E47 DNAzyme is among the most efficient DNA&#8208;ligating DNAzymes reported, but it still lacks sufficient activity for widespread adoption and requires a highly unstable phosphoimidazole&#8208;activated DNA substrate to function. In this study, we performed in vitro selection using a pre&#8208;structured library based on E47 and identified sequences with more than a twofold increase in ligation activity, representing the fastest DNA&#8208;ligating DNAzymes reported to date. We also screened alternative imidazolide compounds for substrate activation and found that phosphobenzimidazole&#8208;activated DNA substrates are significantly more stable, remaining intact for at least 24 h at room temperature. These advances improve the practicality of DNAzymes for ligation&#8208;based applications and broaden their potential use in DNA data storage.

         <title>Design, Synthesis and Aggregation of Amphiphilic Monomers&#8212;Cyclic and Tubular Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Self&#8208;assembly in Conventional and Polar Media</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two new hydrogen&#8208;bonding monomers, TEG&#8208;UPy and TEG&#8208;PUPy, featuring tetraethylene glycol solubilizing chains (TEG) were synthesized and shown to self&#8208;assemble into tubular supramolecular structures in polar solvents. The (TEG&#8208;Upy)4 tetramer effectively encapsulates a C60 fullerene, forming a host&#8208;guest complex even in acetonitrile. The C60@(TEG&#8208;UPy)4 complex serves as an efficient photocatalyst for the oxidation of sulfides to sulfoxides.








ABSTRACT
Two hydrogen&#8208;bonding monomers containing tetraethylene glycol (TEG) chains have been synthesized and characterized. The monomers are based on a bicyclic scaffold appended with either 4H&#8208;bonding benzyl&#8208;substituted ureidopyrimidinone motifs or 2H&#8208;bonding unsubstituted pyrrole&#8208;fused ureidopyrimidinone motifs, with the TEG chains introduced with the aim of developing amphiphilic monomers soluble in nonpolar and polar organic solvents in order to extend the utility of H&#8208;bonding in supramolecular chemistry. In CDCl3, both monomers formed cyclic tetramers. The monomer containing 2H&#8208;bonding motifs was found to form significantly less&#8208;stable aggregates than its previously reported alkylated analogue, most likely due to interference from the TEG chains. Despite the weaker aggregation, the 2H&#8208;bonded tetramers were able to stack into tubular polymers through orthogonal H&#8208;bonding in less polar solvent (toluene) or when a suitable guest (C70) was introduced. Comparison of the TEGylated monomers with previously reported alkylated analogues showed that the introduction of TEG chains resulted in increased solubility in a wide range of solvents. By using one of the TEGylated monomers, nonpolar C60 could be solubilized in polar solvent acetonitrile by forming an inclusion complex. This complex was used as a homogeneous catalyst for photochemical oxidation of sulfides to sulfoxides in acetonitrile.

         <title>Metal Nanoclusters Catalyzing Organic Transformations&#8208;Synergistic Effects</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 68, December 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This concept highlights recent progress of the synergistic effect of metal nanoclusters in catalyzing organic transformations. Construction of metal&#8208;metal and metal&#8208;ligand synergistic activation sites for catalysis are introduced, respectively, providing a new perspective on the rational design of metal nanocluster catalysts and activity/selectivity control in organic transformations.








Abstract
Metal nanoclusters consist of an ultra&#8208;small metal kernel and organic ligands on the surface. They possess diversified metal&#8208;ligand coordination modes and generally display catalytic properties that are distinct from those of the homogeneous and heterogeneous metal catalysts, thus offering considerable potential for application in the field of catalytic organic transformations. Moreover, metal nanoclusters have well&#8208;defined compositions and atomically precise structures, which are beneficial for revealing the relationship between structures and catalytic performance. Therefore, metal nanoclusters have been employed as a model catalyst to ascertain the synergistic activation sites and to investigate the catalytic reaction mechanism from both theoretical and experimental perspectives. This review focuses on the synergistic catalysis of metal nanoclusters in organic transformations. We discuss two aspects of this topic: i) construction of metal&#8208;metal synergistic activation sites for catalysis; ii) construction of metal&#8208;ligand synergistic activation sites for catalysis. The summary and outlook concerning future opportunities of metal nanocluster in catalyzing organic transformations are presented at the end.

         <title>Size and Polarizability as Design Principles for Stereoselective Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 68, December 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In recent years, noncovalent interactions (NCIs) have been recognized as a key component in substrate activation and control in stereoselective catalysis. We demonstrate that size and polarizability serve as powerful, yet simple descriptors for catalyst and substrate design on a quantitative level.








Abstract
Molecular volumes and isotropic polarizabilities of a larger number of carbocyclic &#960;&#8208;systems ranging from benzene on the small to heptacene on the large end are provided in order to facilitate the analysis of positively size&#8208;dependent catalytic processes, where an increase in substrate or catalyst size leads to an increase in reaction rate and/or reaction stereoselectivity. The utility of this approach is demonstrated for selected stereoselective catalytic processes from the contemporary literature.

         <title>Influence of Countercations on the NH3&#8208;SCR of NO Using Supported Vanadium&#8208;Containing Polyoxometalate Catalysts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 68, December 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
At low temperatures, anatase&#8208;supported H6PV3Mo9O40 (HPA&#8208;3) POM catalysts were investigated for NH3&#8208;SCR. Lower acidity and redox shifts caused decreased activity when Na&#8314;, K&#8314;, and Cs&#8314; cations were substituted. According to the EPR studies, the supported catalyst's acidity and vanadium redox property work in concert to control the catalytic activity of POM&#8208;supported on TiO2.








Abstract
Anatase&#8208;supported vanadium&#8208;substituted Keggin&#8208;type polyoxometalates (POMs) are promising alternative catalysts for the selective catalytic reduction (SCR) of NOx with NH3 at low temperatures. Generally, alkali poisoning is a major deactivation mechanism in vanadium&#8208;catalyzed SCR, but changing the counter cations in the POM catalyst might be a propitious strategy for enhancing the catalyst stability. In this study, the effect and the role of cation variation were investigated in detail by exchanging the protons from the most promising Keggin&#8208;type HPA&#8208;3 (H6PV3Mo9O40) catalyst dispersed on anatase support with cations such as Na+, K+, Cs+. The synthesized catalysts were characterized in&#8208;depth using ICP&#8208;OES/AAS, FTIR, TGA, NH3&#8208;TPD, EPR, H2&#8208;TPR, ED (electron diffraction) and XPS. The supported HPA&#8208;3/TiO2 catalyst with a 7.5&#160;wt. % loading was found to be the most active catalyst for the SCR reaction in the temperature range of 200&#8211;300 &#176;C, providing nearly complete NO conversion at 300 &#176;C with a relatively high first&#8208;order rate constant. In comparison, the analogous alkali&#8208;exchanged catalysts possessed lower activities, which by characterization was corroborated to a combined effect of lower acidity and altered redox property. The study reveals new insight into NH3&#8208;SCR catalysts comprising redox&#8208;active POMs, which so far mainly have been applied for homogeneously catalyzed reactions.

Generally, alkali poisoning is a major deactivation mechanism in vanadium-catalyzed SCR, but changing the counter cations in the POM catalyst might be a propitious strategy for enhancing the catalyst stability. In this study, the effect and the role of cation variation were investigated in detail by exchanging the protons from the most promising Keggin-type HPA-3 (H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;PV&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Mo&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;40&lt;/sub&gt;) catalyst dispersed on anatase support with cations such as Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, Cs&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;. The synthesized catalysts were characterized in-depth using ICP-OES/AAS, FTIR, TGA, NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-TPD, EPR, H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-TPR, ED (electron diffraction) and XPS. The supported HPA-3/TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; catalyst with a 7.5&#160;wt. % loading was found to be the most active catalyst for the SCR reaction in the temperature range of 200&#8211;300 &#176;C, providing nearly complete NO conversion at 300 &#176;C with a relatively high first-order rate constant. In comparison, the analogous alkali-exchanged catalysts possessed lower activities, which by characterization was corroborated to a combined effect of lower acidity and altered redox property. The study reveals new insight into NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-SCR catalysts comprising redox-active POMs, which so far mainly have been applied for homogeneously catalyzed reactions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>PtNi Nanowires Coated with Amorphous FeOx Enable Robust Alkaline Seawater Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 68, December 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, a PtNi nanowire with an amorphous FeOx layer achieves exceptional seawater hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) performance (81&#160;mV @ 100&#160;mA cm&#160;&#8722;&#160;2). The FeOx provides atomic&#8208;level corrosion protection by dual function: promoting H&#8314; adsorption while blocking Cl&#8722;, enabling seawater stability.








Abstract
Promoting water dissociation kinetics while overcoming the severe chloride&#8208;induced degradation of platinum (Pt)&#8208;based catalysts is critical for practical seawater hydrogen evolution, yet remain significant challenges. Herein, we report amorphous FeOx&#8208; coated PtNi nanowires (NWs) (PtNi@FeOx) featuring an atomic&#8208;scale amorphous shell&#8208;crystalline core heterointerface, which deliver outstanding alkaline seawater electrolysis performance. The PtNi@FeOx catalyst surpasses conventional Pt&#8208;based materials, demonstrates overpotentials as low as 30&#160;mV (10&#160;mA cm&#160;&#8722;&#160;2) and 81&#160;mV (100&#160;mA cm&#160;&#8722;&#160;2), and exhibits excellent endurance of 100&#160;h at 100&#160;mA cm&#160;&#8722;&#160;2. Theory of density functional calculations reveal that the synergistic amorphous/crystalline heterointerface accelerates water splitting kinetics while modulating hydrogen adsorption energetics at active centers, thereby reducing the reaction energy landscape. Moreover, the ultrathin amorphous FeOx layer selectively facilitates H intermediate adsorption while effectively repelling chloride ions, thus significantly enhancing catalyst stability under complex seawater conditions. This work provides a promising atomically interface&#8208;engineering strategy for designing electrocatalyst toward highly efficient and robust large&#8208;scale seawater electrolysis.

         <title>Interaction&#8208;Specific Control Over Self&#8208;Assembly Landscape and Supramolecular Chirality</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 68, December 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A unique interaction&#8208;specific perspective into the complex self&#8208;assembly landscape is presented. The understanding aids the development of a general strategy toward a deterministic control of the assembly outcome and supramolecular chirality by reversibly manipulating specific noncovalent interactions.








Abstract
Supramolecular chirality in molecular assemblies is often an outcome of cooperative interactions that can result from multiple short&#8208; and long&#8208;range noncovalent interactions operating in tandem. The ability to manipulate a single interaction out of a collection of noncovalent interactions can arguably affect cooperativity and thus alter supramolecular chirality. We present such an interaction&#8208;specific control over supramolecular chirality in the aqueous self&#8208;assembly of a pair of enantiomeric perylene bisimides. Each enantiomer assembles into three distinct chiral states, including a pair of mirror&#8208;image structures. These can be accessed either by specific heating/cooling protocols or by varying the water&#8208;cosolvent ratio. An unprecedented control over this complex self&#8208;assembly landscape is achieved by selectively and reversibly turning off the carboxylic acid&#8208;mediated hydrogen&#8208;bonding interaction, such that the assembly can be guided toward any specific chiral state in a deterministic fashion. The generality of our strategy is demonstrated by carrying out similar supramolecular stereomutation for structurally related molecules.

An efficient photochemical protocol for the synthesis of 2&#8208;ester or 2&#8208;amide benzoxazoles was developed, utilizing 1,8&#8208;dihydroxyanthraquinone and CuI as the photocatalytic system under LED 427&#160;nm irradiation. Furthermore, 2&#8208;ester/amide benzoxazoles serve as intermediates for the synthesis of potentially valuable compounds.








Abstract
The development of novel methods for the synthesis of substituted benzoxazoles is of wide interest, since such heterocyclic compounds exhibit various bioactivities. We report herein an efficient photochemical protocol for the oxidative cyclization of glycine derivatives to produce 2&#8208;substituted benzoxazoles bearing ester or amide moieties. Cheap and commercially available 1,8&#8208;dihydroxyanthraquinone serves as the organocatalyst in the presence of a nonprecious salt (CuI), while Kessil LED 427&#160;nm is the source of irradiation. An extended substrate scope proves the generality of the method, which operates under mild conditions and in line with the principles of green chemistry. Direct infusion&#8208;high resolution mass spectrometry studies supported the proposal of the reaction mechanism. Furthermore, ease derivatization of selected benzoxazole 2&#8208;carboxylates/carboxamides demonstrates their utility as versatile intermediates for the synthesis of a wide range of compounds, thereby highlighting the value and broader applicability of the new photochemical protocol.

         <title>Synergy Effects in a Bimetallic Ru&#160;&#9472;&#160;Pt Alloy Catalyst for Low&#8208;H2&#8208;Pressure Hydrogenolysis of Low&#8208;Density Polyethylene</title>

         <dc:description>
A Ru&#9472;Pt bimetallic alloy catalyst enables efficient hydrogenolysis of LDPE under low H2 pressure. The catalyst outperforms monometallic Ru or Pt, with enhanced activity attributed to the synergy of Ru (C&#9472;C bond cleavage) and Pt (hydrogenation of Ru&#9472;alkyl intermediates).








Abstract
Hydrogenolysis of low&#8208;density polyethylene (LDPE) under low pressure of H2 has been accomplished with a Ru&#9472;Pt bimetallic alloy catalyst. Using Ru5Pt1/CeO2 (atomic ratio of Ru to Pt is 5:1) as a catalyst, LDPE was efficiently converted (97.6&#160;&#177;&#160;2.5% conversion) to gas and liquid hydrocarbons under 5&#160;bar of H2 at 200 &#176;C, whereas Ru/CeO2 and Pt/CeO2 showed much lower conversion (45.7&#160;&#177;&#160;3.7% and&#160;&lt;&#160;1%, respectively), under the same conditions. Mechanistic studies suggested that the higher activity of Ru5Pt1/CeO2 can be attributed to the synergistic effect of Ru (cleavage of C&#9472;C bond) and Pt (acceleration of Ru&#9472;alkyl hydrogenation step) on the catalyst surface.

         <title>Porphyrin&#8211;Acene Dyads for Controlled Singlet Oxygen Generation and Depletion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 68, December 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of porphyrin&#8208;acene dyads that incorporate various components capable of generating singlet oxygen, storing it, and thermally releasing oxygen on demand within biologically relevant temperature ranges has been sensitized and characterized. Comprehensive photophysical analysis has revealed essential structure&#8208;property relationships critical for designing molecular systems with precisely controlled singlet oxygen management.








Abstract
The controlled generation, capture, and release of singlet oxygen (1O2) holds significant promise for applications in catalysis and biomedicine. In this study, we designed and synthesized a novel series of bichromophoric compounds integrating a central porphyrin core, which efficiently generates singlet oxygen, with acene units that serve as reservoirs for its reversible storage via endoperoxides. A comprehensive investigation, including detailed photophysical characterization, singlet oxygen generation, capture, and release efficiency measurements, and quantum&#8208;chemical calculations, was conducted to elucidate structure&#8208;property relationships critical for 1O2 control. Our findings indicate that the optimal performance depends on a delicate interplay between singlet oxygen generation efficiency, its capture kinetics, and the thermal reversibility of oxygen release. Among the studied porphyrin&#8208;acene dyads, the tetracene derivative emerged as the best&#8208;performing compound, combining high singlet oxygen generation, efficient formation of endoperoxides, and sufficient thermal singlet oxygen release. In contrast, pentacene and anthracene derivatives exhibited limitations due to either lower singlet oxygen yields or poor reversibility, respectively. These insights open new pathways for the rational design of advanced materials and systems capable of precise and controlled singlet oxygen delivery.

         <title>Structure&#8208;Function Relationships of Heparan Sulfate&#8208;Based Neoproteoglycans as Selective Immunostimulatory Scaffolds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 68, December 4, 2025. </description>

We report the first evidence that synthetic heparan sulfate (HS)&#8208;based neoproteoglycans can modulate immune responses, underscoring the critical influence of sulfation patterns and uronic acid composition on cytokine secretion.








Abstract
Heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) play a critical role in regulating inflammatory responses. Their diverse functions arise from the distinct structural heterogeneity of heparan sulfate (HS) side chains. Deciphering these structural determinants offers a promising strategy for developing novel vaccine adjuvants and immunotherapeutic agents. Herein, we evaluated a panel of neoproteoglycans (neoPGs) functionalized with structurally defined HS oligosaccharides to identify ligands that selectively trigger cytokine responses in immune cells. Our results demonstrate that highly sulfated, L&#8208;iduronic acid&#8208;containing, N&#8208;sulfated HS&#8208;conjugated neoPGs, specifically H7 and H12 induced pro&#8208;inflammatory cytokines TNF&#8208;&#945;, IL&#8208;1&#946;, and IL&#8208;6 in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), compared to their D&#8208;glucuronic acid analogs. Notably, cotreatment with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) did not result in a synergistic increase in cytokine levels, indicating that these HS neoPGs likely activate immune signaling independently of the LPS&#8208;mediated pathway. In contrast, similar experiments with murine macrophage cell line PMJ2&#8208;PC showed only modest cytokine induction, particularly with the H6 ligand, further supporting a cell&#8208;type specific and Toll&#8208;like receptor (TLR) independent mechanism of action. Collectively, these data identify structurally distinct HS domains that can function as cell&#8208;specific immunomodulators, offering new opportunities for the rational design of glycan&#8208;based adjuvants and therapeutic immune regulators.

         <title>Lamellar&#8208;Cleavage&#8208;Induced Triboluminescence in Discrete Chiral Complexes with Lanthanides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 68, December 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The TL mechanism of chiral lanthanide complexes induced by the DTS that provided a mechanical stimulus was elucidated using structural and spectral measurements. The lamellar molecular aggregation was cleaved, and TL was accelerated by the excitation of the ligand acting as an energy donor to the ff emission of Eu, Tb, Sm, and Dy through energy transfer. The ligand&#8208;centered TL of GdLval strongly support the mechanism.








Abstract
Triboluminescence (TL), which is the light emission induced by mechanical stimuli, has attracted significant interest owing to its potential for energy conversion applications. Here, the TL mechanisms of chiral lanthanide complexes (LnLval, Ln&#160;=&#160;Eu, Tb, Sm, Dy, and Gd) were elucidated by focusing on the role of lamellar cleavage of the crystal structure. The modified drop tower system (DTS) quantifies mechanical stimuli used to observe the TL spectra. Chiral EuLval and TbLval exhibit intense TL, in contrast to the absence of TL in their racemic counterparts. Structural analyses revealed lamella&#8208;like molecular stacking in the chiral crystals with anisotropic molecular orientations and flexibility along the c&#8208;axis. TL was reversibly observed by recrystallization when the crystal size was sufficiently large. Comparison of the TL and photoluminescence (PL) spectra, showed that TL of chiral LnLval was enhanced through photo&#8208;antenna effects by the impact of lamellar cleavage. The TL values of the chiral Dy and Sm complexes were also evaluated. Furthermore, the absence of chemical reaction of the two nitrate ions with neighboring molecules in the lamella was confirmed. This system suggests the importance of the lamellar arrangement and provides potential design strategies for mechano&#8208;responsive materials for TL activation of Ln complexes.

         <title>MXene@MOF Composites: Converging Synthesis Strategies, Structural Features, and Emerging Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review presents a comprehensive analysis of MXene@MOF composites, emphasizing their structural features, synthesis strategies, and rapidly expanding applications across supercapacitors, electrocatalytic water splitting, photocatalysis, and electrochemical sensing.








ABSTRACT
2D materials have attracted a lot of interest since the invention of graphene because of their remarkable qualities and adaptability. The distinct architectures and complementary qualities of MOFs (metal&#8211;organic frameworks) and MXenes offer intriguing prospects in various sectors. Derived from MAX phases, MXenes have hydrophilic surfaces, and excellent electrical conductivity. MOFs, on the other hand, provide large surface area, adjustable porosity, and diverse chemical functions. Nevertheless, there are drawbacks associated with&#160;both materials. MXenes are prone to oxidation and self&#8208;stacking, whereas MOFs have limited structural stability and poor electrical conductivity. The development of MXene@MOF composites provides a synergistic solution, combining the advantages of both materials while reducing their individual drawbacks. In this review, we highlight the most recent advances in MXene@MOF composites and provide a focused discussion on their unique structural features, emerging synthesis trends, and rapidly expanding applications. These elements distinguish this work from earlier reviews. This review systematically explores the structures and synthesis methods of these materials, including solvothermal, hydrothermal, and in&#8208;situ growth techniques, and examines their wide range of applications. Superior electron transport, high surface area, and improved structural stability lead to enhanced performance of MXene@MOF composites in supercapacitors, water splitting, photocatalysis, and sensing.

This review systematically explores the structures and synthesis methods of these materials, including solvothermal, hydrothermal, and in-situ growth techniques, and examines their wide range of applications. Superior electron transport, high surface area, and improved structural stability lead to enhanced performance of MXene@MOF composites in supercapacitors, water splitting, photocatalysis, and sensing.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>TiO2/FeCoS Heterojunction Anode for Fast&#8208;Charging Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Introducing FeCoS into TiO2 constructs a heterogeneous interface that enhances electron transport and accelerates lithium&#8208;ion diffusion by reducing the migration energy barrier, thus enabling rapid intercalation and deintercalation of lithium ions.








ABSTRACT
To develop fast&#8208;charging lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs), optimizing insertion&#8208;type anode structure is crucial for achieving fast lithium&#8208;ion diffusion and high electronic conductivity. Here, we combine insertion&#8208;type TiO2 with high&#8208;capacity FeCoS to construct a TiO2/FeCoS heterojunction, which enhances electron/ion transport, lowers the ion diffusion energy barrier, and thereby improves quick&#8208;charging performance. The resulting anode exhibits a high reversible capacity of 627.7 mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.1 A g&#8722;1, 2.3 times that of TiO2. Notably, it gives a remarkable capacity of 241.7 mAh g&#8722;1 at 10 A g&#8722;1 and maintains excellent stability over 10,000 cycles with an ultralow capacity decay of just 0.002% per cycle. Experiments and theoretical calculations confirm the superior performance originates from enhanced Li+ ions adsorption and reduced diffusion barrier at the heterointerface, which accelerates Li+ insertion/extraction kinetics. This work provides an effective pathway to accelerate electrochemical kinetics and enable fast&#8208;charging LIBs.

         <title>Self&#8208;assembly and Lateral Cobalt Coordination of a Fivefold Symmetric Cyanostar Macrocycle on an Au(111) Surface</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, we report the first example of the formation of a close&#8208;packed, regular 2D monolayer of a fivefold symmetric cyanostar macrocycle on an Au(111) surface under ultra&#8208;high vacuum and the structural modification of such self&#8208;assembled architecture upon cobalt atom deposition.








ABSTRACT
The functionalization of solid surfaces with responsive macrocyclic compounds is a key strategy for developing advanced functional materials, with applications in molecular sensing, catalysis, and nanoscale electronics. Here, we report the self&#8208;assembly and lateral cobalt coordination, on an Au(111) surface and under ultra&#8208;high vacuum conditions, of a fivefold symmetric cyanostar macrocycle, a class of anion recognition molecules. This represents the first example of a close&#8208;packed regular assembly of a pentagonal macrocycle at the solid&#8208;vacuum interface.

Abstract
A novel J&#8208;aggregates configuration, termed &#960;&#8211;&#960;&#8208;coupled J&#8208;aggregates, was successfully constructed based on low&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight hemicyanine dyes (HCY&#8208;3). Unlike classical J&#8208;aggregates, the &#960;&#8211;&#960;&#8208;coupled J&#8208;aggregates are formed through synergistic &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking and hydrogen bonding interactions between monomeric molecules, The rigidified&#8208; molecular planar architecture not only avoids fluorescence quenching of the photosensitizer but also significantly broadens the bathochromic absorption band owing to enhanced conjugation effects while preserving photodynamic activity. As a result, a broad bathochromic absorption from 600&#160;nm to an absorption tail over 1100&#160;nm was achieved, allowing the photosensitizer to be compatible with a variety of laser sources. The enhanced&#8208;receptor conjugation significantly boosts singlet oxygen generation efficiency while reinforcing &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions, endowing the J&#8208;aggregates with exceptional thermal stability, chemical stability, and photothermal generation capability. Under 980&#160;nm laser excitation, the &#960;&#8211;&#960;&#8208;coupled J&#8208;aggregations based on HCY&#8208;3 J&#8208;NPs exhibited excellent ROS generation capacity and NIR&#8208;II fluorescence emission, successfully achieving multimodal photothermal/photodynamic antitumor therapy guided by NIR&#8208;II FL imaging. Such &#960;&#8211;&#960;&#8208;coupled J&#8208;aggregates may represent a new route for the design of NIR&#8208;II photosensitizers.

         <title>Denaturation of Water in Alkaline Melts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Vapor pressure measurements and ab initio molecular&#8208;dynamics simulations reveal that in ultra&#8208;alkaline media with base concentrations up to 70&#160;mol L&#8722;1, the activity of water is dramatically reduced by strong bonding interactions. These disrupt traditional hydrogen bonding patterns, alter vapor&#8208;liquid equilibria, and significantly change molecular coordination and proton dynamics.








ABSTRACT
Extremely high base concentrations (cB) in ultra&#8208;alkaline liquids, also known as hydroflux, alter the thermodynamic and structural properties of water. Mixtures of water and alkali (AOH, A&#160;=&#160;Na, K) with molar base ratios of q(A)&#160;=&#160;n(H2O):n(AOH) &#8804; 2:1 (cB &#8805; 25&#160;mol L&#8722;1) show an overproportionally reduced vapor pressure compared to more diluted systems. The vapor pressure of a melt with q(A)&#160;=&#160;0.8 (cB&#160;=&#160;70&#160;mol L&#8722;1) at 200&#176;C is negligible. Ab initio molecular dynamics simulations revealed substantial structural reorganization of the hydrogen bonding network in the equimolar mixture of KOH and water. Distinctive molecular features included altered coordination geometries, shortened hydrogen bonds, and frequent proton transfer events, including Grotthuss diffusion, indicative of an altered hydrogen&#8208;bond network and increased proton mobility. Cluster population analysis shows that a significant number of H3O2&#8722; anions are present, which exhibit a near symmetrical hydrogen bond with O&#183;&#183;&#183;H distances &lt;1.28 &#197;. The hydroflux can be seen as an intermediate between an alkaline solution and a molten salt {K+&#183;H+&#183;2OH&#8211;}, in which the water has a vanishing chemical activity.

         <title>Gas&#8208;Phase Synthesis of Hyperbranched UHMWPE by Enhancing Chain Walking and Minimizing Chain Transfer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Compared to conventional solution&#8208;phase polymerization, the gas&#8208;phase method significantly suppresses chain transfer while promoting chain walking, leading to a simultaneous increase in both molecular weight and branching density.








ABSTRACT
A series of rigid&#8208;flexible unsymmetrical bulky &#945;&#8208;diimine palladium catalysts was employed for the gas&#8208;phase polymerization of ethylene, enabling the synthesis of hyperbranched ultrahigh molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE). Compared to conventional solution&#8208;phase polymerization, the gas&#8208;phase method significantly suppresses chain transfer while promoting chain walking, leading to a simultaneous increase in both molecular weight and branching density. Under optimized conditions, the resulting polyethylene exhibited high molecular weight (up to 2053&#160;kg/mol) and branching densities as high as 107 branches per 1000 carbon atoms. Structural characterization confirmed the presence of long&#8208;chain branches and branch&#8208;on&#8208;branch architectures, indicative of a hyperbranched topology. The unsymmetrical palladium catalysts produced polyethylene with higher molecular weight and branching density than the benchmark catalysts, by combining suppressed chain transfer with high chain&#8208;walking ability. This work demonstrates the potential of gas&#8208;phase polymerization as a solvent&#8208;free, environmentally benign route to advanced polyolefin materials with tailored architectures.

&lt;p&gt;Compared to conventional solution-phase polymerization, the gas-phase method significantly suppresses chain transfer while promoting chain walking, leading to a simultaneous increase in both molecular weight and branching density.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A series of rigid-flexible unsymmetrical bulky &#945;-diimine palladium catalysts was employed for the gas-phase polymerization of ethylene, enabling the synthesis of hyperbranched ultrahigh molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE). Compared to conventional solution-phase polymerization, the gas-phase method significantly suppresses chain transfer while promoting chain walking, leading to a simultaneous increase in both molecular weight and branching density. Under optimized conditions, the resulting polyethylene exhibited high molecular weight (up to 2053&#160;kg/mol) and branching densities as high as 107 branches per 1000 carbon atoms. Structural characterization confirmed the presence of long-chain branches and branch-on-branch architectures, indicative of a hyperbranched topology. The unsymmetrical palladium catalysts produced polyethylene with higher molecular weight and branching density than the benchmark catalysts, by combining suppressed chain transfer with high chain-walking ability. This work demonstrates the potential of gas-phase polymerization as a solvent-free, environmentally benign route to advanced polyolefin materials with tailored architectures.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Multiple Conductance States in Artificial Unimolecular Channels</title>

         <dc:description>
Conformationally self&#8208;tuning macrocycles for observing and modulating subconductance in artificial channels.








ABSTRACT
Since the 1980s, the patch&#8208;clamp technique has revealed subconductance states (substates) in natural ion channels in addition to the traditional closed and fully open states. While subconductance states offer critical insights into the structure and function of ion channels, the structural basis underlying this behavior remains unclear. Artificial ion channels can serve as simplified molecular models to establish structure&#8211;function relationships; however, replicating subconductance behavior is extremely challenging. Here, we present a concept for a conformationally self&#8208;tuning macrocyclic skeleton designed to observe and modulate subconductance states in artificial channels. This concept was experimentally validated using oxacalix[2]arene[2]triazine&#8208;based molecular funnels.

         <title>Synthesis and Glycosidase Inhibition Studies of Novel Exoglycals Targeting GH3 Family Enzymes: Insights from Comparative Analysis with Macrolide Antibiotics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of structurally diverse exoglycals was synthesized using a modified Julia&#8208;olefination approach from sugar&#8208;derived precursors. These glycosidase transition&#8208;state mimics were further diversified via CuAAC chemistry to yield triazole&#8208;conjugated analogues. Inhibition studies against GH3 &#946;&#8208;glucosidase EryBI revealed competitive inhibition with tunable affinities. Comparative analysis with macrolide antibiotics uncovered distinct inhibition modes, underscoring scaffold&#8208;specific interactions. These findings establish exoglycals as versatile platforms for selective GH3 glycosidase inhibition and therapeutic exploration.








ABSTRACT
Glycosidases are key enzymes involved in carbohydrate metabolism. Members of the GH3 family have emerged as therapeutic targets due to their roles in natural product biosynthesis and disease. Transition&#8208;state analogues represent a powerful strategy for glycosidase inhibition, and exoglycals (C&#8208;glycosylidenes) have gained interest as conformational mimics of glycosidic bond hydrolysis.
Herein, we report the synthesis of novel exoglycals bearing diverse substituents, including terminal alkynes and thymidyl residues, via a modified Julia&#8208;olefination strategy from sugar&#8208;derived lactones and substituted sulfones. Selected alkyne&#8208;containing exoglycals were further functionalized through cycloaddition with azidothymidine.
Inhibition studies against EryBI, a GH3 glycosyl hydrolase, were performed. Kinetic analysis revealed diverse inhibitory mechanisms among the exoglycals, displaying competitive inhibition, with Ki values spanning micromolar to millimolar affinities.
To contextualize the inhibitory potential of exoglycals, we evaluated three clinically relevant macrolide antibiotics&#8208;erythromycin, clarithromycin, and azithromycin. Intriguingly, these macrolides exhibited competitive or uncompetitive inhibition, contrasting with the consistent competitive behavior of exoglycals. This comparative analysis highlights the scaffold&#8208;dependent selectivity of GH3 inhibition.
Our results demonstrate exoglycals as tunable scaffolds for glycosidase inhibition of GH3 glycosidases and provide mechanistic distinctions between carbohydrate mimics and macrolide antibiotics. These insights could guide the development of next&#8208;generation glycosidase inhibitors with improved specificity.

         <title>Multiple Dimerization Modes in Thiocarboxylate Paddlewheel Complexes: A Comprehensive View of Energy Landscapes from DFT Calculations and Statistics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Staggered, square, and heavily bent dimers occur in the five known solvatomorphs of paddlewheel (PW) complex [PtVO(SOCPh)4]. These and other structural motifs are well within energetic reach due to the shallow potential energy surface that guides dimerization and are included in a revised classification of available structural data on heterobimetallic PWs.








ABSTRACT
Thiocarboxylate paddlewheels (PWs) [MTr(SOCR)4L] (M = Pt, Pd; Tr = first&#8208;row transition metal; L = Tr&#8208;coordinated axial ligand) form a variety of dimeric structures via M&#183;&#183;&#183;M' and M&#183;&#183;&#183;S' contacts. We found that [PtVO(SOCPh)4] (1), a molecular spin qubit, yields three crystalline toluene (tol) solvates, namely 1&#183;0.875tol and two polymorphic 1&#183;0.5tol phases. The crystals contain either staggered quasi&#8208;coaxial dimers with short Pt&#183;&#183;&#183;Pt' distances (3.17&#8208;3.23 &#197;) or heavily bent noncoaxial molecular pairs supported by Pt&#183;&#183;&#183;S' contacts (3.34&#8208;3.38 &#197;). By contrast, in the known solvatomorphs 1&#183;CH2Cl2 and 1&#183;0.5hex (hex = n&#8208;hexane), two collinear molecules compose a &#8220;square&#8221; dimer via a pair of reciprocating Pt&#183;&#183;&#183;S' contacts (3.13&#8208;3.16 &#197;). According to gas&#8208;phase DFT calculations (PBE0/def2&#8208;TZVPP/D3BJ), dimerization is energetically favored by 15&#8211;20&#160;kcal mol&#8722;1 and is guided by a shallow potential energy surface, with staggered dimers as ground configurations but eclipsed and square dimers well within energetic reach. Inspection of the local energy minima also disclosed a previously unrecognized eclipsed arrangement with &#8764;45&#176; twisting of both PWs relative to the metal plane, whose existence was confirmed by statistical analysis of PW structures in the Cambridge Structural Database. Our results led to a new classification scheme for these PW dimers relevant to molecular magnetism and quantum technologies.

         <title>Vanadium(V) Complexes Bearing Bidentate Phenoxy&#8208;Phosphine Ligands and Their High Performance Toward Ethylene Homopolymerization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel imido&#8208;vanadium catalysts bearing bidentate phenoxy&#8208;phosphine ligands overcome traditional instability, achieving remarkable performance in ethylene polymerization, including ultra&#8208;high activity, excellent thermal stability, broad solvent compatibility, long catalytic lifetime, and Mw&#8208;tunable polyethylenes. By modifying ligand framework, the performance can be effectively tuned, offering a robust design strategy.








ABSTRACT
A new series of imido&#8208;vanadium(V) complexes bearing bidentate phenoxy&#8208;phosphine ligands was synthesized in high yields and fully characterized by NMR spectroscopy, elemental analysis, and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. These complexes were systematically evaluated as efficient catalysts for ethylene polymerization. Among them, complex C1 exhibited exceptional activity, up to 446.5 &#215; 106 gPE (molV)&#8722;1&#183;h&#8722;1, along with excellent thermal stability (120&#176;C), long catalytic lifetime (120&#160;min), and broad solvent compatibility. The produced polyethylene samples spanned moderate to ultra&#8208;high molecular weights, with a maximum of 160.4 &#215; 104&#160;Da. Systematic structure&#8208;activity&#8208;polymer investigations revealed that both steric and electronic variations on ligand critically tune catalytic behavior and polymer properties, underscoring the effectiveness of phenoxy&#8208;phosphine framework and providing valuable insights for the rational design of high&#8208;performance polyolefin catalysts.

The produced polyethylene samples spanned moderate to ultra-high molecular weights, with a maximum of 160.4 &#215; 10&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;Da. Systematic structure-activity-polymer investigations revealed that both steric and electronic variations on ligand critically tune catalytic behavior and polymer properties, underscoring the effectiveness of phenoxy-phosphine framework and providing valuable insights for the rational design of high-performance polyolefin catalysts.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Distinct Ligand&#8208; and Metal&#8208;Centered Phosphorescence in a Terbium Carbazolyl Complex</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Terbium and lanthanum carbazolide complexes show two distinct modes of luminescence: Strongly temperature&#8208;dependent narrow&#8208;line terbium emission could be induced. In addition, both the terbium and the lanthanum complexes show broad&#8208;line interligand emission processes with excited states of microsecond life&#8208;time.








ABSTRACT
Carbazolide complexes of lanthanum and terbium with cyclooctatetraenediide (COT) and THF coligands of the type [(dtbpCbz)LnCOT(thf)n] (n = 2 for La, 1 for Tb) were synthesized by salt metathesis reactions. The THF molecules were found to be labile, and drying under vacuum led to their partial removal with concomitant formation of the dinuclear complexes [(dtbpCbz)2Ln2(COT)2(thf)]. The luminescence of both lanthanum and terbium complexes was investigated, and at cryogenic temperatures, strongly temperature&#8208;dependent phosphorescence was observed. The terbium complexes show the expected element&#8208;characteristic emission with narrow lines between 480 and 700&#160;nm upon excitation at 370&#160;nm. Beyond that, broad emission was induced selectively by excitation at lower energy. Related phosphorescence was found for the lanthanum complex, which implies intra&#8208; or inter&#8208;ligand excitation as source for the latter. This interpretation was corroborated by TD&#8208;DFT computations.

         <title>Modified Julia Olefination Approach to Chiral &#945;&#8208;Fluorovinyl Amino Alcohols and Amino Acids, via Fluorovinyl Oxazolidine Precursors, Conformational and Crystallographic Analyses</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chiral &#945;&#8208;fluorovinyl oxazolidines were synthesized by condensation of Julia reagents, prepared from L &#8208; or D&#8208;serine, and aldehydes. Olefinations were tunable towards E&#8208; or Z&#8208;alkenes. Fluorovinyl E/Z mixtures with electron rich substituents were isomerized to Z&#8208;olefins. Oxazolidines were converted to amino alcohols, and some were oxidized to protected amino acids. X&#8208;ray, NMR data, and DFT computations were used for conformational analyses.








Abstract
Synthesis of chiral &#945;&#8208;fluorovinyl &#946;&#8208;aryl/heteroaryl/alkyl amino alcohols was achieved via intermediate 4&#8208;(&#945;&#8208;fluorovinyl) 2,2&#8208;dimethyloxazolidines with stereochemically defined preexisting stereogenic centers, derived from (S)&#8208; or (R)&#8208;serine. Previously unknown 4&#8208;fluorovinyl 2,2&#8208;dimethyloxazolidines with a fluorine atom placed alpha to the oxazolidine were prepared via Julia olefination of tert&#8208;butyl (S)&#8208;4&#8208;{(S)&#8208;[benzo[d]thiazol&#8208;2&#8208;ylsulfonyl]fluoromethyl}&#8208;2,2&#8208;dimethyloxazolidine&#8208;3&#8208;carboxylate and its (R,R) enantiomer, with a series of aldehydes. By choice of conditions, olefinations could be tuned towards Z&#8208; or E&#8208;selectivity. E/Z olefin mixtures with electron&#8208;rich aryl and heteroaryl substituents were isomerized exclusively or predominantly to the Z&#8208;isomer. N&#8208;Boc protected &#946;&#8208;aryl/alkyl substituted &#945;&#8208;fluorovinyl amino alcohols were obtained by oxazolidine hydrolysis. To demonstrate utility for synthesis of amino acids, (R,Z)&#8208; and (S,Z)&#8208;p&#8208;methoxyphenyl&#8208; and the (S,E)&#8208;p&#8208;cyanophenyl&#8208;substituted alkenes were subjected to oxidation, which was very challenging. The use of cat. TEMPO/cat. NaOCl/NaClO2 gave the N&#8208;Boc protected fluorovinyl amino acids that were converted to their methyl esters. Enantioselective HPLC of the (S)&#8208; and (R)&#8208;p&#8208;methoxyphenyl&#8208;substituted products formed at each step of the synthetic sequence indicated that high enantiomeric purity was retained through the entire synthesis. Crystal structures of two fluorovinyl oxazolidines and one amino alcohol provided insight into the solid&#8208;state conformations. NMR and computational analyses were used to obtain insight into plausible solution conformations.

         <title>Stafib&#8208;2&#8208;CR: an Improved Nanomolar and Selective Inhibitor of the Transcription Factor STAT5b Developed by Conformational Restriction of Stafib&#8208;2</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Conformational restriction strategies to increase the activity and selectivity of the STAT5b inhibitor Stafib&#8208;2 are presented. The best conformationally restricted inhibitor Stafib&#8208;2&#8208;CR has threefold higher activity against STAT5b than Stafib&#8208;2. A cell&#8208;permeable prodrug of Stafib&#8208;2&#8208;CR inhibits phosphorylation of STAT5b in cultured human leukemia cells with higher activity and selectivity than the prodrug corresponding to Stafib&#8208;2.








ABSTRACT
The highly homologous transcription factors STAT5a and STAT5b are overactivated in many human tumor types. We recently reported catechol bisphosphates as the first chemical entities that inhibit STAT5b with selectivity over STAT5a. Here, we apply conformational restriction strategies to increase the activity and selectivity of Stafib&#8208;2, the most potent STAT5b inhibitor reported to date. The best conformationally restricted Stafib&#8208;2 analogue 8b (dubbed Stafib&#8208;2&#8208;CR) displayed approximately threefold higher activity against STAT5b than Stafib&#8208;2, associated with higher selectivity over STAT5a. Its cell&#8208;permeable prodrug 17 (dubbed Pomstafib&#8208;2&#8208;CR) inhibits phosphorylation of STAT5b in cultured human leukemia cells with slightly higher activity and selectivity over STAT5a than Pomstafib&#8208;2, the prodrug corresponding to Stafib&#8208;2.

         <title>Polymer Size&#8211;Catalytic Activity Relationships in Solution by Fluorescence Correlation Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fluorescence correlation spectroscopy coupled with chemoselective fluorescent monomers enables catalytic activity characterization of catalysts associated with polymers in solution and determines catalytic persistence. Deviation from an ideal population as assessed by &#967;2 is developed to track changes in the relative number of species and characterizes growing polymers as collections of aggregates.








ABSTRACT
Measuring the catalytic activity of specific sizes of polymers with active catalysts in solution is typically challenging, due to limited instrument detection sensitivity and/or dynamic range. Here, a fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) method is developed to determine the catalytic activity of living polymers of a specific apparent size in solution. Deviation from a single&#8208;component FCS data fitting, as assessed by &#967;2, is also introduced and developed as a &#8220;speciation index&#8221;&#8212;a method to evaluate and track changes in the relative amount of distinct polymer sizes with reaction progress. These methods are enabled by incorporating a selectively reactive fluorescent monomer into growing polydicyclopentadiene or polynorbornene during ring&#8208;opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP). Compared to polynorbornene, data showed that catalysts in aggregates of polyDCPD retained higher activity for longer&#8212;outcomes not directly inferable from simple diffusional&#8208;access predictions. The ability to assign catalytic activity to polymers of specific sizes, and then to determine how this activity evolves with reaction progress, support long&#8208;term goals in the development and measurement of nano&#8208;objects that possess size&#8208;dependent catalytic activity.

         <title>Tricarbonyl Rhenium&#8208;Based PROTACs Degrade the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Mpro Protease</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel metallo&#8208;PROTAC platform (Re2) for SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Mpro degradation is synthesized by integrating a covalent rhenium(I) warhead with pomalidomide. This work overcomes intrinsic PROTAC permeability barriers through metalation, enabling three&#8208; to fourfold enhanced cellular uptake and inducing UPS&#8208;mediated protease degradation. The strategy establishes coordination chemistry&#8208;tunable metal complexes as potent solutions for high&#8208;efficacy targeted protein degradation.








ABSTRACT
Targeted protein degradation (TPD) using proteolysis&#8208;targeting chimeras (PROTACs) offers advantages over occupancy&#8208;based inhibitors but faces challenges,&#160;including ligand discovery and cellular permeability. To address these limitations, we developed Re2, a metallo&#8208;PROTAC integrating a covalent rhenium(I) complex warhead targeting SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 main protease (Mpro) Cys145 with the cereblon E3 ligase ligand pomalidomide. Re2 induced effective intracellular Mpro degradation at 100&#160;nM within 72 h, which is significantly below its parent complex's enzymatic inhibition concentration. In vitro and ex vivo studies confirmed covalent Mpro binding and ubiquitin&#8208;proteasome system&#8208;dependent degradation. Crucially, Re2 exhibited three&#8208; to fourfold higher cellular uptake and greater intracellular accumulation than its demetallated organic counterpart, demonstrating that metalation overcomes intrinsic PROTAC permeability barriers. This work establishes metallo&#8208;PROTACs, exploiting the tunable coordination chemistry of metal complexes for enhanced target engagement and cellular delivery, as a potent strategy for designing high&#8208;potent PROTACs.

         <title>(NH4)2[Tc2O2(S2O7)4]: An Unexpected Technetium(V)&#8208;Sulfate From the Reaction of (NH4)(TcO4) With SO3</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reaction of the radioactive pertechnetate (99TcO4)&#8722; with the oxidizer SO3 leads to blue crystals of (NH4)2[Tc2O2(S2O7)4]. The complex dimeric [Tc2O2(S2O7)4]2&#8722; anion exhibits the technetium in the oxidation state V, showing that reduction occurs during the reaction.








ABSTRACT
The reaction of ammonium pertechnetate, (NH4)(TcO4), with SO3 leads to crystals of (NH4)2[Tc2O2(S2O7)4] (monoclinic, P21/c, Z&#160;= 2, a&#160;= 775.67(5), b&#160;= 1339.55(8), c&#160;= 1233.32(8) pm, &#946; = 100.566(2)&#176;). The compound contains the dimeric [Tc2O2(S2O7)4]2&#8722; anion with the Tc atom connected by disulfate anions. It is astonishing that even under the oxidizing reaction conditions, reduction of the Tc(VII) starting material occurs. Contrastingly, an analogous reaction of (NH4)(ReO4) with SO3 gives the Re(VII) sulfate (NH4)[ReO2(S2O7)2] (orthorhombic, Pca21, Z&#160;= 8, a&#160;= 1842.7(1), b&#160;= 847.03(5), c&#160;= 1663.8(1) pm). The compounds have been further studied by vibrational spectroscopy and quantum mechanical calculations.

         <title>Biocompatible SABRE Hyperpolarization of [1&#8208;13C]Ketoleucine for Cellular Metabolic Flux Sensing</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report the biocompatible production of hyperpolarized [1&#8208;13C]ketoleucine, a branched&#8208;chain amino acid probe. Using SABRE hyperpolarization, relying on parahydrogen as a source of hyperpolarized state, we produce a biocompatible solution of this probe and visualize the enzymatic conversion in live yeast cells, establishing a platform for studying branched&#8208;chain amino acid metabolism with cellular and clinical significance.








ABSTRACT
Ketoleucine (&#945;&#8208;ketoisocaproate) is a novel hyperpolarized substrate for noninvasive metabolic imaging, enabling rapid, high&#8208;sensitivity detection of branched&#8208;chain amino acid flux, a pathway that is aberrant in many diseases including cancer and Alzheimer's disease. Utilizing NMR Signal Amplification by Reversible Exchange (SABRE) with an 80:20 acetone:water solvent system, we achieved &gt;11% polarization of [1&#8208;13C]ketoleucine (corresponding to signal enhancement over 230,000&#8208;fold at 0.55 T) at 70&#160;mM within 2 min, using parahydrogen as a cheap and fast source of hyperpolarization. A two&#8208;stage liquid&#8211;liquid extraction and gas stripping protocol removes excess excipients, yielding a biocompatible aqueous solution of [1&#8208;13C]ketoleucine (79 &#177; 10&#160;mM). When mixed with Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Baker's yeast), hyperpolarized [1&#8208;13C]ketoleucine produced strong, long&#8208;lasting signals, where downstream metabolites are observed for &gt;200&#160;s, allowing first&#8208;order kinetic modeling of CO2 and bicarbonate. These cell experiments demonstrate both the biocompatibility and signal strength of SABRE&#8211;hyperpolarized KL, establishing KL as a versatile hyperpolarized agent and opening avenues for real&#8208;time investigation of metabolic dysregulation in cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, and beyond.

ABSTRACT
(RRR)&#8208;&#945;&#8208;tocopherol reacts with 4&#8208;phenyl&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;triazoline&#8208;3,5&#8208;dione (PTAD) at ambient conditions in a fast formal [6+2+2] addition reaction yielding four pairs of diastereomers, three of them containing novel heterocyclic ring systems. Structure elucidation required customized 3,5&#8208;13C2,4&#8208;15N labelled PTAD to establish the connectivity of the PTAD units using 4&#8211;5J 1H&#8208;13C, 2J 13C&#8208;13C, and 1J 13C&#8208;14N NMR correlations. Absolute stereochemistry was determined based on calculated CD spectra compared to experimental data. The reaction occurred also with related 6&#8208;chromanols and required a free phenolic hydroxy group. As one possibility, the addition of the first PTAD involves a hetero&#8208;Alder&#8208;ene reaction, followed by a Diels&#8211;Alder or alternative addition / cyclization of a second PTAD. Together with the derivatization of vitamin K and the known reactions with vitamins A and D, PTAD can thus derivatize all fat&#8208;soluble vitamins in a one pot reaction, offering potential new applications for their analysis in complex matrices.

Together with the derivatization of vitamin K and the known reactions with vitamins A and D, PTAD can thus derivatize all fat-soluble vitamins in a one pot reaction, offering potential new applications for their analysis in complex matrices.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Synthesis of 2&#8242;&#8208;O,4&#8242;&#8208;C&#945;&#8208;Dimethyl Ribonucleoside Analogs and Their Effects on RNA and Modulation of ADAR Editing</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
2&#8242;&#8208;O,4&#8242;&#8208;C&#945;&#8208;dimethyl nucleic acids (24mNA) were synthesized, and their biophysical properties in RNA and in RNA editing were evaluated. 24mNA modulate duplex thermal stability in an analog&#8208;dependent manner, and based on crystal structures of mono&#8208;4&#8242;&#8208;Me&#8208;containing RNA, the 4&#8242;&#8208;Me group projects toward the minor groove of the duplex. Additionally, 24mNA imparts high site specificity for RNA editing 5&#8217;&#8208;UA and 5&#8217;&#8208;AA ADAR targets.








ABSTRACT
Oligonucleotides capable of guiding adenosine deaminases acting on RNA (ADARs) to carry out therapeutic adenosine (A) to inosine (I) editing constitute a promising new class of nucleic acid therapeutics. However, our understanding of the impact of different chemical modifications at the various nucleotide positions in ADAR guide strands is limited. While ribose 2&#8242; modification is common in ADAR&#8208;directing guides, less is known about the impact of modification at the 4&#8242; position. Here we describe the synthesis of several 4&#8242;&#8208;C&#945;&#8208;methyl and 2&#8242;&#8208;O, 4&#8242;&#8208;C&#945;&#8208;dimethyl derivatives of adenosine, uridine, and cytidine and their incorporation into RNA. In addition, we show that these analogs maintain the base pairing selectivity of their parent nucleoside and modulate duplex thermal stability in an analog&#8208;dependent manner. High&#8208;resolution crystal structures of RNA duplexes bearing 4&#8242;&#8208;C&#945;&#8208;methyl A or U showed that these analogs adopt a C3&#8242;&#8208;endo sugar pucker and project 4&#8242; substituents into the minor groove. Finally, we find that 2&#8242;&#8208;O, 4&#8242;&#8208;C&#945;&#8208;dimethyluridine and 2&#8242;&#8208;O, 4&#8242;&#8208;C&#945;&#8208;dimethyladenosine strategically positioned in ADAR guide strands can increase the selectivity of the editing reaction for target sequences with adjacent off&#8208;target adenosines. This work advances our understanding of the ADAR reaction mechanism and informs the design of ADAR guide strands with improved selectivity.

         <title>Design of Uniform Polymer Nanoparticles via Living Crystallization Driven Self&#8208;Assembly</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Living crystallization&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly (CDSA), employing a seeded growth method, has emerged as a pivotal strategy for achieving precise control of anisotropic nanoparticles. A critical aspect of this technique lies in heteroepitaxial crystallization, which transcends the chemical composition constraints of conventional homoepitaxy and enables the design of segmented structures with spatially distinct core components.








ABSTRACT
Living crystallization&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly (CDSA), employing a seeded growth method, has emerged as a pivotal strategy for achieving precise control of anisotropic nanoparticles over the dimensions and structure, which enables the fabrication of 1D cylinders and 2D platelets with low dispersity. This versatile and robust approach, characterized by linearly tunable dimensions and programmability of structural sequences, has been widely applied in the construction of nanoparticles exhibiting uniform size and controlled architecture. A critical aspect of this technique lies in heteroepitaxial crystallization, which transcends the chemical composition constraints of conventional homoepitaxy and enables the design of segmented structures with spatially distinct core components. Building upon this foundation, we elucidate the key aspects of living CDSA seed growth, with a particular emphasis on exploring the mechanism of governing heteroepitaxial growth from crystalline seeds with distinctly chemical compositions. Elucidating the intricate mechanisms of heteroepitaxial crystallization allows access to broaden the design possibilities for segmented nanoparticles with spatially defined core compositions and functionalities. Moreover, the new developing methods for facile synthesis of uniform particles with high solid concentrations are also reviewed, which are promising for the real applications of these advanced nanomaterials.

         <title>Dynamics and Conformational Stability of Chiral Bay&#8208;Phenolate&#8208;Substituted Twisted Octaazaperopyrenedioxides (OAPPDOs)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chiral octaazaperopyrenedioxide (OAPPDO) fluorophores were obtained by functionalizing with BINOL and related fragments bridging the bay position. They possess conformational flexibility but remarkable thermal stability with respect to racemization of the central chromophore, which allowed the study of their chiroptical properties, including circular polarized luminescence (CPL).








ABSTRACT
Configurationally stable chiral octaazaperopyrene dioxide (OAPPDO) derivatives were obtained by nucleophilic substitution of chiral BINOL and related fragments as bridging units onto the bay position. The addition of these phenolate derivatives has given rise to a new group of bright chiral fluorophores with remarkable thermal stability, which allowed the study of their chiroptical properties, in particular, their circular dichroism characteristics as well as circular polarized luminescence (CPL), albeit with a low dissymmetry factor (glum) in the range of 2*10&#8722;4. The introduction of the BINOL bridging groups in the bay position led to equilibria between chiral conformers in solution, the interconversion of which has been studied by DFT modeling, with the two lowest energy species being directly observable in situ by NMR. Insight into the stability of these derivatives with respect to overall racemization has been obtained by DFT modeling which established an overall activation barrier for the process of above 170&#160;kJ mol&#8722;1.

         <title>Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Chemical Systems That Mimic Biological Dynamics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chemists are designing synthetic systems that mimic life's dynamic behaviors, such as motion, sensing, adaptation, and compartmentalization, by integrating reaction networks with stimuli like light, pH, and chemical fuels. This mini&#8208;review surveys molecular machines, responsive materials, nucleic acid networks, and artificial cells, highlighting how chemical design drives the emergence of life&#8208;like functions.








ABSTRACT
Living systems achieve adaptability, motion, and self&#8208;regulation through chemical networks operating out of equilibrium. Reproducing these dynamics synthetically demands precise control over kinetics, thermodynamics, and molecular design to convert energy inputs into time&#8208;programmed function. Recent advances in stimuli&#8208;responsive and chemically powered systems show how life&#8208;like behaviors such as oscillations, autonomous motion, adaptive responses, and compartmentalization can be encoded using fuel&#8208;driven cycles and stimulus&#8208;gated switches powered by chemical, photonic, or enzymatic inputs. This mini&#8208;review highlights molecular assemblies that sustain transient states, molecular machines powered by specific chemical inputs, responsive materials that reconfigure in response to environmental triggers, nucleic acid&#8208;based networks for sensing and regulation, and artificial cells that exhibit compartmentalization and signaling. Together, these developments bridge systems chemistry and biomimicry, expanding the chemical toolkit for engineering matter that can adapt and respond. Beyond mimicking biology, such systems deepen our understanding of the molecular foundations of living matter and open new routes to technology. Self&#8208;powered systems, molecular motors, smart materials, and artificial cells now form a rapidly growing toolbox with the potential to impact drug discovery, biosensing, energy, food production, and materials science. The field's future lies in integrating multiple life&#8208;essential functions into a single construct, ultimately enabling synthetic systems that replicate the complex network behaviors of living organisms and inspire next&#8208;generation innovation.

         <title>Optical Dissymmetry of As&#8208;Grown Twisted Paracetamol Crystals</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
ABSTRACT
Paracetamol crystalline form III grows just above the glass transition temperature as aggressively twisted fibers that thicken in successive stages, forming complex assemblies. The growth direction is parallel to a glide plane leading to heterochiral crystals. These enantiomorphs are not Pasteur&#8208;like polyhedra with hemihedral facets that are the tell&#8208;tale signs of dissymmetric form; here every surface is dissymmetric. The chiroptical properties of the heterochiral forms are assayed as they evolve directly in the solid state using complete polarimetry.

&lt;p&gt;Paracetamol crystalline form &lt;b&gt;III&lt;/b&gt; grows just above the glass transition temperature as aggressively twisted fibers that thicken in successive stages, forming complex assemblies. The growth direction is parallel to a glide plane leading to heterochiral crystals. These enantiomorphs are not Pasteur-like polyhedra with hemihedral facets that are the tell-tale signs of dissymmetric form; here every surface is dissymmetric. The chiroptical properties of the heterochiral forms are assayed as they evolve directly in the solid state using complete polarimetry.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>TEMPO in Solution, Melted, Solid, and Adsorbed on a Silica Surface: A Paramagnetic NMR Study</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Paramagnetic species can often be measured with EPR and NMR spectroscopy. This is demonstrated using the important radical TEMPO. All 1H and 13C NMR signals of TEMPO could be recorded and assigned. The impact of TEMPO on the chemical shifts of solvent signals and a phosphine is described.








ABSTRACT
TEMPO (2,2,6,6&#8208;tetramethyl&#8208;1&#8208;piperidinyloxy) is a stable radical that is phenomenologically interesting and of high importance in synthesis and catalysis. This radical has been studied extensively with EPR and used as a spin tag for biological materials and to probe hydrogen bonding. The NMR properties of TEMPO have not yet been reported. This contribution describes that all 1H and 13C NMR signals of TEMPO are visible in the paramagnetic NMR spectra. The 1H NMR spectra of TEMPO solutions have a chemical shift range of 50&#160;ppm and require only 8 scans. The 13C NMR signals are localized within a chemical shift range of 2600&#160;ppm and are obtained within 30 minutes. Samples prepared with different solvents and TEMPO concentrations have been investigated, and it has been demonstrated that all solvents undergo chemical shift changes due to the presence of TEMPO and adduct formation in the case of CDCl3. The impact of TEMPO on the 31P chemical shift of PPh3 is studied. Higher concentrations of TEMPO in solution lead to narrower signals and the molten substance, measured at 60&#176;C, represents the culmination of this trend. It is demonstrated with paramagnetic solid&#8208;state NMR that TEMPO adsorbs on a silica surface and displays the chemical shift and linewidth features of a dilute solution of TEMPO.

         <title>Bioorthogonal Chemistry in Biomolecule Quantification: A Review of Reactions and Strategies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review summarizes the application of catalyst&#8208;free bioorthogonal reactions: Staudinger ligation, strain promoted azide alkyne cycloaddition, inverse electron&#8208;demand Diels&#8211;Alder, and 2&#8208;cyanobenzothiazole cysteine condensation in the semi&#8208;quantitative and quantitative analysis of biomolecules. These reactions offer fast kinetics, high selectivity, and good biocompatibility, enabling diverse detection strategies for accurate biomolecule quantification.








ABSTRACT
Bioorthogonal chemistry has emerged as a transformative strategy for detecting and quantifying biomolecules in complex biological systems. This review highlights recent advances in catalyst&#8208;free bioorthogonal reactions specifically applied to semi&#8208;quantitative and quantitative biomolecular analysis. We exclude reactions that require toxic or complex catalysts and focus on four reactions: Staudinger ligation, strain&#8208;promoted azide&#8211;alkyne cycloaddition, inverse electron&#8208;demand Diels&#8211;Alder reaction, and 2&#8208;cyanobenzothiazole&#8211;cysteine condensation. For each, we discuss reaction kinetics and strategies for representative applications in biomolecular quantification. The scope of target biomolecules varies by reaction, including proteins, nucleic acids, glycans, and small molecules. Quantification techniques such as fluorescence spectroscopy, luminescence spectroscopy, and mass spectrometry are examined, with reported limits of detection typically ranging from nanomolar to micromolar, and a few advanced techniques reaching femtomolar or attomolar sensitivity. Each reaction is discussed in terms of kinetics, molecular compatibility, and analytical sensitivity. Finally, we outline key challenges and future opportunities, emphasizing the need for faster reaction kinetics, improved probe design, enhanced integration with advanced analytical platforms, and standardized methods to improve reproducibility and cross&#8208;study comparability in biomolecular quantification.

         <title>Lattice Oxygen&#8211;Mediated Water Oxidation on Reconstructed Ni3S2/NiFeOOH Heterointerfaces</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Upon electrochemical activation, Ni3S2/NiFe&#8208;LDH catalysts undergo transformation to Ni3S2/NiFeOOH. This structural reconstruction not only exposes additional catalytic active sites but also activates lattice oxygen species, thereby triggering the lattice oxygen reaction pathway. By circumventing the thermodynamic constraints inherent to the adsorbate mechanism, the reconstructed catalyst achieves a reduced overpotential, ultimately enhancing its oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalytic performance.








ABSTRACT
Developing cost&#8208;effective oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts for industrial current densities remains challenging, hindered by adsorbate evolution mechanism (AEM) scaling limitations and reconstruction instability. Here, we report a heterointerface&#8208;engineered Ni3S2/NiFeOOH catalyst formed via in&#8208;situ electrochemical reconstruction of Ni3S2/NiFe&#8208;LDH. Interfacial charge redistribution stabilizes high&#8208;valent Ni3+/Fe3+ species and generates coordinatively unsaturated lattice oxygen sites, thereby activating the lattice oxygen mechanism (LOM). Combined operando spectroscopy, pH&#8208;dependent kinetics, and isotope labeling confirm LOM dominance. Further theoretical analyses reveal that the heterointerface downshifts the metal d&#8208;band center and upshifts the O 2p&#8208;band center, optimized intermediate adsorption free energy. Benefiting from the compatible multi&#8208;mechanism, the reconstructed catalyst demonstrates outstanding OER performance, only requires overpotentials of 196/305&#160;mV to drive current densities of 10/1000&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 in alkaline media, with robust stability for over 500&#160;h. This work clarifies how interfacial electronic modulation connects pre&#8208;catalyst reconstruction to LOM activation, providing a scalable design strategy for high&#8208;current&#8208;density OER electrocatalysts.

ABSTRACT
The enhanced accessibility of active catalytic sites in 2D Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks (MOFs) is promising for achieving superior catalytic performance. However, the achievement of abundant active catalytic sites along with excellent chemical stability onto a 2D MOF is a formidable challenge and of significant interest. Herein, we have strategically designed and developed a new Lewis&#8208;acidic 2D Ni&#8208;MOF: IITKGP&#8208;61 employing mixed ligand synthesis approach. Interestingly, MOF: IITKGP&#8208;61, even being a 2D framework maintained its superior crystallinity in liquid water for a month and across a wide range of aqueous pH solutions (2&#8211;12) due to the combined contribution from both thermodynamic and kinetic stability factors. With the abundant accessible open metal sites (two OMSs per formula unit), the developed framework was explored in the biologically important Hantzsch condensation reaction under the sustainable synthetic pathway. Good&#8208;to&#8208;excellent yields were achieved for a broad scope of substrates even with lower catalyst loading. Most importantly, to verify the practical utility, MOF: IITKGP&#8208;61 was employed for the synthesis of a biologically important 1,4&#8208;dihydropyridine molecule with antidiabetic properties in ethanol as green solvent with excellent yield. Utilization of a MOF catalyst in such a direction is scarce in the literature and thus demands extensive future research.

         <title>Dynamic Olefinic Bond Restructuring in Coordination Polymers Enables Precision Photocycloaddition</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A 2D Cd&#8208;based coordination polymer (CP1) is reported to dynamically restructure double bonds for selective [2+2] photocycloaddition under the co&#8208;regulation of solvent vapor and visible light, with MeOH/H2O guests further dictating the regioselective pathway for distinct products.








ABSTRACT

         <title>One&#8208;pot Base&#8208;free Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura [11C]Methylation: Kinetic and Mechanistic Insights</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A base&#8208;free Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura [11C]methylation is achieved in a one&#8208;pot process with [11C]CH3I on moderate yields. Electronic effects enable transmetallation without boronate activation, while kinetics and DFT show oxidative addition (heterolytic) as the rate&#8208;limiting step.








ABSTRACT
The Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling reaction is one of the most powerful approaches for forming carbon&#8211;carbon bonds in the synthesis of carbon&#8208;11&#8211;labeled positron emission tomography (PET) radiotracers. Typically, Suzuki cross&#8208;coupling is performed in the presence of a base to activate the boron reagent and sustain the catalytic cycle. Here, we investigate the capacity of the Suzuki reaction to proceed under one&#8208;pot base&#8208;free conditions for [11C]methylation reactions and elucidate the mechanistic features that enable this transformation. Conditions were optimized to successfully achieve one&#8208;pot methylation of a model substrate using [11C]CH3I in the absence of base in moderate yields. Systematic substrate studies reveal that the reaction is partly governed by the electronic properties of the boron substrate, suggesting an alternative transmetallation pathway in this case. Kinetic studies using [14C]CH3I, together with kinetic isotope effect (KIE) measurements and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, reveal that oxidative addition remains the rate&#8208;determining step through a heterolytic pathway, consistent with the formation of a cationic Pd(II) intermediate that can undergo transmetallation in the absence of base. Together, these results provide new mechanistic insights into Pd&#8208;mediated [11C]C&#8211;C bond formation under the unique stoichiometric constraints of radiochemical conditions, expanding the understanding of base&#8208;free cross&#8208;coupling reactions with [11C]CH3I.

         <title>Photochemistry of Aromatic N&#8208;Oxides in Water Probed by Time&#8208;Resolved X&#8208;ray Absorption Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Time&#8208;resolved XAS at the nitrogen and oxygen K&#8208;edges is applied to the photorearrangement of two N&#8208;oxides in water. Pyridine N&#8208;oxide rapidly forms the oxaziridine isomer. Pyridazine N&#8208;oxide undergoes ring opening to the diazo compound, without any evidence of intermediates.








ABSTRACT
Aromatic N&#8208;oxides have a rich photochemistry, but the primary steps have not been investigated in much detail. In this work pyridine N&#8208;oxide and pyridazine N&#8208;oxide are studied using steady&#8208;state and time&#8208;resolved X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS). Absorption changes at the nitrogen and oxygen K&#8208;edges following UV photoexcitation are recorded on a timescale of picoseconds to hundreds of nanoseconds. The spectral features are assigned to the presence of specific transient intermediates. Quantum chemical calculations indicate that the excited state dynamics in the S1 state are characterized by a fast deplanarization. After reaching a minimum energy crossing point (MECP), evolution on the ground state surface leads to the starting materials and metastable products. The primary photoproduct of pyridine N&#8208;oxide, oxaziridine 3, is stable on the sub&#8208;microsecond timescale. In the photochemistry of pyridazine N&#8208;oxide, oxaziridine and oxadiazepine intermediates are not observed, and (Z)&#8208;4&#8208;diazobut&#8208;2&#8208;enal is formed within 100&#160;ps. The mechanistic details of the two different N&#8208;oxides uncovered through characteristic features in the near&#8208;edge X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure (NEXAFS) region serve as an example of how time&#8208;resolved XAS enables the characterization of photochemical dynamics beyond those accessible to more traditional spectroscopies.

ABSTRACT
Designing and synthesizing condensed, thermally stable zeolites by inverse sigma expansion of open&#8208;framework zeolites has been well achieved. However, creating thermally stable open&#8208;framework zeolites through sigma expansion of condensed&#8208;frameworks remains rare. Herein, we present the rational design and synthesis of a thermally stable medium&#8208;pore aluminosilicate zeolite SCM&#8208;53, which possesses a 2D 10&#160;&#215; 10&#8208;ring channel system. The framework of SCM&#8208;53 was theoretically predicted by sigma expansion of the framework of SCM&#8208;51, a small&#8208;pore aluminosilicate zeolite featuring a 2D 8&#160;&#215; 8&#8208;ring channel system prepared by calcination of the layered precursor SCM&#8208;50. SCM&#8208;53 was rationally synthesized by successive interlayer silylation and calcination treatments of SCM&#8208;50. The structure of SCM&#8208;53 was validated by powder X&#8208;ray diffraction (PXRD), scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, and N2 absorption measurement. Our results demonstrate that SCM&#8208;53 possesses accessible micropores (5.9&#160;&#215; 4.9 &#197;), an ultrathin nanosheet morphology (&#8764;15&#160;nm), and high thermal stability (up to 800 &#176;C), suggesting its potential for adsorption and catalytic applications. We anticipate that sigma expansion offers a promising approach for the rational design and synthesis of targeted novel zeolite structures.

         <title>Rectifying Contact&#8208;induced Electronic Regulation of Fe Within Nitrogen&#8208;doped Carbon for Enhanced Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The rectifying contact between Fe nanoparticles and N&#8208;doped 3D honeycomb&#8208;like carbon can induce a built&#8208;in electric field (BIEF) for optimizing charge redistribution of activity center, thereby endowing Fe&#8208;NPs@N&#8208;HC with excellent oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity in alkaline medium and zinc air battery performance.








ABSTRACT
Developing efficient and durable oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) electrocatalysts from earth&#8208;abundant elements is of great significance for the advancement of sustainable energy technologies such as rechargeable zinc&#8208;air batteries. Herein, we present a 3D honeycomb&#8208;like nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon matrix decorated to in&#8208;situ form Fe nanoparticles (denoted as Fe&#8208;NPs@N&#8208;HC) via an ice&#8208;templating method. Theoretical calculations and experimental analyses collectively reveal that the work function mismatch between metallic Fe and the N&#8208;doped carbon host drives spontaneous charge transfer, establishing a built&#8208;in electric field at the heterointerface to form the rectifying contact. This interfacial effect fine tunes electronic structure and optimizes the adsorption of oxygen intermediates, thereby accelerating the ORR kinetics. Benefiting from these synergistic effects, Fe&#8208;NPs@N&#8208;HC achieves a half&#8208;wave potential of 0.86&#160;V, superior tolerance to methanol, and excellent long&#8208;term durability in alkaline media. When integrated into a liquid zinc&#8208;air battery, Fe&#8208;NPs@N&#8208;HC also delivers a high peak power density of 126.4&#160;mW cm&#8722;2 and outstanding cycling stability exceeding 482 cycles, surpassing the benchmark Pt/C&#8208;based system. This work demonstrates that tailoring the electronic structure through interfacial engineering, coupled with rational 3D framework design, provides a promising strategy for the development of next&#8208;generation nonprecious metal catalysts for practical energy conversion applications.

         <title>Supramolecular Host&#8208;Guest Complexation Dynamics by Cost&#8208;Efficient Electronic Structure Methods</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present a cost&#8208;effective multilevel workflow for the kinetic profiling of host&#8211;guest systems, illustrated with cucurbit[6]uril and alkylammonium cations. The method combines rapid docking and reaction path searches at the semi&#8208;empirical level, with refinement of the results using modern density functional theory, accurately reproducing experiment and enabling routine analysis of supramolecular host&#8211;guest association mechanisms.








ABSTRACT
Multilevel computational approaches based on electronic structure methods currently enable the accurate structural and thermodynamic characterization of medium to large&#8208;sized host&#8211;guest systems, but have been scarcely used to systematically study their kinetics. Here, we show how this type of protocol can be easily applied for the task, using the well&#8208;known complexation reaction between the cucurbit[6]uril host and alkylammonium cations as a test case. To this end, the recently reported aISS docking workflow is used for the fast exploration of the coconformational space of a set of nine host&#8211;guest aggregates, at the robust and fast semiempirical GFN2&#8208;xTB(ALPB) level of theory. After identification of appropriate intermediates and reaction products, those can be in turn efficiently connected by the Nudged Elastic Band method, enabling fast screening of different potential reaction mechanisms, and the identification of the corresponding transition states. Further refinement of the equilibrium geometries and a better energetic description of the stationary points is nevertheless mandatory, for instance with the state of the art and efficient &#969;B97X&#8208;3c(COSMO&#8208;RS)//r2SCAN&#8208;3c(CPCM) density functional&#8208;based protocol, which not only accurately reproduces the experimental reference values of the free energy of association (MAE = 1.4&#160;kcal/mol), but also the kinetic in/out barriers reported for the processes (MAE = 2.0 and 2.9&#160;kcal/mol, respectively). Overall, this work presents a robust and cost&#8208;effective multilevel workflow for the routine kinetic profiling of supramolecular association processes.

         <title>Cobalt(II) Single&#8208;Chain Magnet with Strong Anisotropy and Ferromagnetic IntraChain Coupling</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new high&#8208;performance single&#8208;chain magnet (Ueff = 560 K) exhibits strong magnetic anisotropy and ferromagnetic intrachain interactions using redox&#8208;active bridging ligands.








ABSTRACT
Co(II)&#8208;based coordination polymer is reported as a new benchmark single&#8208;chain magnet (SCM), exhibiting an energy barrier (Ueff) of 560 K and a blocking temperature (TB) of 21.5 K&#8210;both the highest values observed for SCM systems. The magnetic behavior originates from the synergistic balance between strong axial anisotropy (DCo = &#8211;83 cm&#8722;1) and moderate ferromagnetic exchange (JCo&#8208;Co = +17.7 K), promoting long&#8208;range spin correlation over thousands of magnetic ions. Detailed analysis of the correlation length and domain&#8208;wall energy reveals a wide SCM regime and a 1D&#8208;to&#8208;3D magnetic crossover at low temperature. Unlike previously reported radical&#8208;bridged SCMs, this work demonstrates a clean, intrinsic design strategy for realizing extreme single&#8208;chain magnetism, offering new principles for developing robust molecular spin materials.

         <title>Covalent Organic Frameworks as Efficient Photocatalysts for Sustainable Ammonia Production</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
COFs are an emerging class of porous materials that exhibit excellent photocatalytic and electrocatalytic properties. Photocatalytic sustainable ammonia synthesis is a new research hotspot in the field of photocatalysis, holding significant importance for reducing global carbon emissions. New materials are being employed to address new challenges in emerging fields, demonstrating captivating characteristics. Perhaps, sustainable ammonia synthesis will become the most promising application direction in the coming years, with COFs serving as a key enabler in advancing this process.








ABSTRACT
Ammonia is one of the most important industrial products. The Haber&#8208;Bosch process has enabled large&#8208;scale ammonia production but also results in substantial carbon emissions. Amid growing environmental concerns, there is an urgent need to transform this highly energy&#8208;intensive process and develop ammonia synthesis technologies under mild conditions. Covalent organic frameworks (COFs), as one of the most prominent emerging materials in recent years, have demonstrated exceptional application potential and advantages in various fields such as photocatalysis and electrocatalysis. The modular structural design of COFs allows for tunable band gaps according to practical requirements, their permanent porosity endows the materials with excellent adsorption capabilities for reactants, and the abundant heteroatoms provide numerous reactive sites. Currently, COFs&#8208;based catalysts have achieved high performance in various photocatalytic applications, and sustainable ammonia synthesis is highly likely to become the next research focus. This review summarizes the fundamental principles of photocatalytic ammonia synthesis, methods for ammonia detection, and the research progress in COFs&#8208;based materials for ammonia synthesis. Finally, it analyzes and discusses the future challenges and prospects of this emerging field of sustainable ammonia synthesis using COFs.

         <title>Helicene&#8208;Based Chiral Macrocycles and Molecular Cages: Synthetic Strategies, Chiroptical Modulation, and Emerging Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This minireview provides a concise overview of recent progress in the design and synthesis of helicene&#8208;based covalent and coordination macrocycles and cages, focusing on advances in synthetic strategies, modulation of chiroptical properties, and emerging opportunities in next&#8208;generation chiral technologies.








ABSTRACT
Macrocycles and molecular cages possess enzyme&#8208;like cavities whose size, shape, and functionality can be precisely engineered.&#160;Helicenes, characterized by rigid &#960;&#8208;conjugated backbones and inherent helical chirality, serve as exceptional scaffolds for constructing highly distorted chiral macrocycles and cages.&#160;These supramolecular architectures demonstrate enhanced circularly polarized luminescence (CPL), enantioselective recognition, and efficient guest adsorption.&#160;This minireview provides a comprehensive overview of recent advances in helicene&#8208;based coordination and covalent strategies, highlighting synthetic methodologies, chiroptical modulation, and emerging applications.&#160;Key challenges&#8212;including fluorescence quenching in metallacages, synthetic complexity, and limited structural diversity&#8212;are critically discussed. We also highlight potential opportunities involving high&#8208;emission linkages, dynamic covalent strategies, and stimuli&#8208;responsive designs.&#160;Collectively, these insights establish a framework for the rational design of helicene&#8208;derived macrocycles and three&#8208;dimensional cages, paving the way toward the development of advanced chiral functional materials.

         <title>Investigating N2 Fixation Using a Bulky Fe(bisphosphine)2 Framework</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The bulky Fe(0) N2 complex Fe(N2)(dibpe)2 has been prepared and efficiently produces NH3/N2H4 upon treatment with acid, similarly to previously investigated Fe(N2)(depe)2. However, it performs much less effectively during attempted catalytic N2 fixation, allowing investigation of the crucial role of steric hindrance in steps such as N2 binding and protonation.








ABSTRACT
An iron(0) dinitrogen complex incorporating highly sterically encumbered bisphosphine ligands, Fe(N2)(dibpe)2 (dibpe&#160;= iBu2PCH2CH2PiBu2), iBu1&#183;N2, has been prepared and thoroughly characterized, and its N2 fixation reactivity assessed. iBu1&#183;N2 is a more hindered analogue of Fe(N2)(depe)2 (depe&#160;= Et2PCH2CH2PEt2), Et1&#183;N2, which has previously been shown to be an efficient N2 reduction catalyst with unusual selectivity for N2H4, and it was anticipated that greater bulk might make iBu1&#183;N2 less prone to deleterious side reactivity, improving performance. The N2 ligand in iBu1&#183;N2 displays a similar degree of activation to Et1&#183;N2, and the two complexes can stoichiometrically fix N2 with similarly high efficiency upon treatment with suitable acids, giving mixtures of NH3 and N2H4. However, attempts to catalytically fix N2 via treatment of iBu1&#183;N2 with mixtures of excess acids and reductants led to poor results. Mechanistic investigations implicate a combination of more sluggish reaction kinetics and weaker binding of N2 to the intermediate Fe(I) cation [Fe(dibpe)2]+, [iBu1]+, whose study was aided by isolation as its BArF4&#8722; salt (ArF&#160;= 3,5&#8208;bis(trifluoromethyl)phenyl), and which has also been fully characterized. This weak interaction hinders regeneration of the initial iBu1&#183;N2 via reduction of [iBu1&#183;N2]+, which appears to be necessary to close the catalytic cycle.

         <title>Evaluation of a New Methylimidazole&#8208;Containing Thiosemicarbazone as a Cu+/Cu2+&#8208;Targeting Ligand in the Context of Alzheimer's Disease</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>

HXE modulates Cu(A&#946;) interaction, reducing ROS production and shifting peptide aggregation in the presence of Cu from toxic amorphous aggregates to less harmful fibrillar structures. These findings highlight HXE potential to interfere with Cu&#8208;induced oxidative stress and aggregation pathways relevant to AD.








ABSTRACT
The binding of copper ions to amyloid&#8208;&#946; (A&#946;) peptide leads to reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation and toxic soluble oligomers, contributing to oxidative stress in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Thus, studying compounds with moderate copper affinity is a promising strategy to prevent its interaction with A&#946; and reduce toxicity. Here, we evaluated a new tri&#8208;coordinating thiosemicarbazone (HXE) with chelating properties to regulate cuprotoxicity in AD. The ligand was nontoxic against HT&#8208;22 hippocampal neuronal cells and bound Cu+ and Cu2+ at pH 7.4, with affinity constants (log Kcond) of 8.7 and 12.3, respectively, showing high selectivity over Zn2+ (log Kapp = 5.0). In the presence of A&#946; and Cu2+, HXE formed stable ternary complexes at physiological pH. Ascorbate consumption and coumarin&#8208;3&#8208;carboxylic acid fluorescence assays showed that the ligand significantly reduces Cu(A&#946;16)&#8208;mediated ROS production. It also prevented Cu2+&#8208;induced modulation of A&#946;40 self&#8208;assembly and restored the typical fibrillar structure of apo&#8208;A&#946;40 aggregates. Overall, HXE effectively modulates metal&#8208;associated A&#946; toxicity and emerges as a promising candidate for AD bioinorganic management.

         <title>Titanium&#8208;Catalyzed Intermolecular Hydrothiomethylation of Alkenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hermetically sealable, inexpensive 42&#8208;well aluminum reactor blocks are used to explore new reactivities of air&#8208; and moisture&#8208;sensitive titanium catalysts. As a result, methyl sulfides undergo efficient &#945;&#8208;alkylation with alkenes in the presence of a titanium catalyst precursor, a formamidinato ligand, and a Lewis acid, yielding branched hydrothiomethylation products with excellent regioselectivity. Graphical design by Melissa Schl&#252;schen.








ABSTRACT
A catalyst screening for six different &#945;&#8208;alkylation reactions of methyl sulfides with unsaturated substrates performed in hermetically sealable and inexpensive 42&#8208;well aluminum reactor blocks is described. As a result, a new titanium&#8208;catalyzed hydrothiomethylation reaction of alkenes, which takes place under C&#9472;H bond activation at the &#945;&#8208;carbon atom of simple methyl sulfides, is presented. The best catalyst is prepared in situ from the readily available titanium catalyst precursor Ti(CH2SiMe3)4, a formamidinato ligand precursor, and the Lewis acid [Ph3C][B(C6F5)4]. Although selected 1,2&#8208;disubstituted alkenes, for example, cyclohexene and cyclopentene, undergo successful hydrothiomethylation reactions, the best results are obtained with monosubstituted 1&#8208;alkenes. In these cases, the reactions take place with excellent regioselectivity and give branched hydrothiomethylation products exclusively (23 examples). When dimethyl sulfide is used as a substrate, either the monohydrothiomethylation product or the dihydrothiomethylation product can be obtained with very good selectivity.

         <title>Acridane[4]Arenes: Scope of the Macro&#8208;Tetramerization, Derivatization Options, and Water&#8208;Soluble Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Acridane[4]arenes (A4As) are introduced as a versatile, conformationally restricted macrocyclic platform accessible in six steps and good yields. Expanded lower&#8208;rim scope, selective upper&#8208;rim functionalization, and N&#8208;Boc modification enable controlled self&#8208;assembly into a dimeric cage that binds tetrabutylammonium salts. Further Buchwald&#8211;Hartwig diversification and ionic substituents afford water&#8208;soluble derivatives, establishing A4As as a broadly modular scaffold for supramolecular applications.








ABSTRACT
Macrocycles are essential scaffolds in supramolecular chemistry, offering versatile platforms for functionalization. Here, we report the optimization, expanded scope, and comprehensive derivatization strategies for acridane[4]arenes (A4A), a large macrocyclic platform featuring a conformationally restricted bowl shape analogous to resorcin[4]arene. The scope of the macrocyclization was expanded with four distinct &#8216;feet&#8217; substituents at the lower rim. Strategies for selective functionalization at the upper rim were developed, including&#160;N&#8208;Boc protection at each acridane subunit. This modification induced self&#8208;assembly into a dimeric cage in apolar solvents, which form stable host&#8211;guest complexes with tetrabutylammonium salts. Further functionalization of the acridane nitrogen via Buchwald&#8211;Hartwig cross&#8208;coupling allowed installation of aromatic groups bearing diverse functional handles. Finally, water&#8208;soluble A4A derivatives were achieved by introducing charged ionic &#8216;feet&#8217; substituents, such as 1&#8208;methylimidazolium. These results establish A4As as a highly modular macrocyclic platform with broad potential for supramolecular applications.

Further functionalization of the acridane nitrogen via Buchwald&#8211;Hartwig cross-coupling allowed installation of aromatic groups bearing diverse functional handles. Finally, water-soluble A4A derivatives were achieved by introducing charged ionic &#8216;feet&#8217; substituents, such as 1-methylimidazolium. These results establish A4As as a highly modular macrocyclic platform with broad potential for supramolecular applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A BODIPY/Coumarin Hybrid Probe for Dual&#8208;Mode Fluorescent/FLIM Imaging of Endoplasmic Reticulum Micro&#8208;Polarity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We designed an ER&#8208;targeted probe&#160;MBDP&#160;via hybridizing coumarin and BODIPY fluorophores, by introducing a benzene to reduce dihedral angles and a methyl group to inhibit intramolecular rotation, enabling specific polarity response. It has a broad linear response and strong anti&#8208;interference, quantifies ER micro&#8208;polarity via dual&#8208;channel and lambda mode imaging, captures ER micro&#8208;polarity changes under stress and hippocampal regional differences, and its notable lifetime variations with micro&#8208;polarity changes endow MBDP with FLIM capability.








ABSTRACT
Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) micro&#8208;polarity, with its spatial heterogeneity and dynamic changes, regulates key physiological processes like protein folding and lipid metabolism. Its abnormal alterations under pathological conditions, such as oxidative stress are closely linked to metabolic diseases and tumors. Capturing these subtle dynamics to reveal connections with organelle dysfunction remains a critical challenge. Existing traditional physical approaches are complex and cannot achieve real&#8208;time spatial imaging. Fluorescent probes for polarity sensing could provide spatiotemporal resolution, nevertheless, suffer from unstable signals due to nonfixed dual channels, narrow response ranges, interference from viscosity, and nonlinear responses, hindering quantitative monitoring. We designed an ER&#8208;targeted probe MBDP via hybridizing coumarin and BODIPY fluorophores, by introducing a benzene to reduce dihedral angles and a methyl group to inhibit intramolecular rotation, enabling specific polarity response. It shows a broad linear response, strong anti&#8208;interference ability, which quantifies ER micro&#8208;polarity via dual&#8208;channel and lambda mode imaging. It captures ER micro&#8208;polarity changes under stress and hippocampal regional differences. Moreover, the remarkable lifetime variations upon polarity change endow MBDP capability under fluorescence lifetime imaging microscope (FLIM). This probe provides a powerful tool with ratiometric imaging and FLIM dual&#8208;modal monitoring for ER micro&#8208;polarity, aiding in revealing ER&#8208;related physiological/pathological mechanisms and disease research.

Syntheses and base pairing properties of halogenated hypoxanthine nucleosides with 8&#8208;aza&#8208;7&#8208;deazapurine skeleton (dI*) are reported. Single X&#8208;ray analyses disclosed unit cells connected by a wobble base pair and consisting of two conformers in high&#8208;anti conformation with N&#8208;type or E&#8208;type sugar puckering. For single incorporations, duplex stability followed the order dI*&#8208;dC = dI*&#8208;dA &gt; dI*&#8208;dT &gt; dI*&#8208;dG. Consecutive incorporations of halogenated dI*&#8208;dC, dI*&#8208;dG, and dI*&#8208;dA base pairs gave stable duplexes, whereas hybridization of dI* with dT failed.








ABSTRACT
Syntheses and base pairing properties of halogenated and nonhalogenated hypoxanthine nucleosides with 8&#8208;aza&#8208;7&#8208;deazapurine skeleton (dI*) are reported. Modified hypoxanthine nucleosides were accessed from 6&#8208;alkoxy precursors. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray analyses disclosed unit cells consisting of two conformers adopting high&#8208;anti conformation around the glycosylic bond with N&#8208;type C3&#8217;&#8208;endo (3T2) or E&#8208;type, O4&#8217;&#8208;endo (0E) sugar puckering. Crystal packing is stabilized by inosine/inosine wobble base pairs as well as intermolecular and intramolecular hydrogen bonds. Hirshfeld surface analyses confirmed these findings. Halogenated and nonhalogenated dI* nucleosides were converted to phosphoramidites and applied to solid&#8208;phase oligonucleotide synthesis. Single and consecutive incorporations were accomplished and Watson&#8211;Crick and purine&#8211;purine base pairing was investigated. Single incorporations opposite to canonical nucleosides afforded stable duplexes in all cases. Tm values revealed the following order of stability dI*&#8208;dC = dI*&#8208;dA &gt; dI*&#8208;dT &gt; dI*&#8208;dG. Consecutive incorporations furnished more distinguished results. Double helices with halogenated dI*&#8208;dC base pairs were the most stable ones, whereas hybridization for dI* opposite to dT was hindered. Halogenated dI*&#8208;dG and dI*&#8208;dA purine&#8208;purine base pairs gave stable duplexes, whereas hybridization of nonhalogenated dI*&#8208;dA pairs failed. From CD spectra, helical changes for duplexes with three dI*&#8208;dG purine&#8208;purine base pairs were detected. All other duplexes showed the typical shape of a B&#8208;DNA.

         <title>Synthesis and Isolation of Bismuth Scorpionate Complexes: Toward Bond Activation via Bismuth&#8208;Ligand Cooperation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
ABSTRACT
Over the past twenty years, main group chemistry has significantly expanded its scope to include reactivities once considered the exclusive domain of transition metals. Among the emerging concepts, element&#8208;ligand cooperation has proven to be a powerful strategy for enabling bond activation reactions but remains relatively unexplored for heavier group 15 elements. In this study, we present a novel class of ylide ligands incorporating additional amino donor sites, specifically designed to promote bismuth&#8208;ligand cooperativity. We successfully isolated a series of well&#8208;defined bismuth scorpionate complexes supported by these dianionic N,Cylide,N ligands, each bearing different substituents at the ylide moiety. These variations modulate the degree of negative charge stabilization, thereby tuning the extent of electron donation to the bismuth center. Halide abstraction generated cationic bismuth complexes, which exhibited enhanced ligand&#8208;to&#8208;bismuth electron donation, resulting in low Lewis acidities and reduced reactivity. In contrast, deprotonation of the ylide ligand bearing an electron&#8208;withdrawing ArF substituent enabled the synthesis and NMR characterization of a rare bismuth yldiide complex. This yldiide underwent a [2 + 2] addition with a carbodiimide across the formal Bi = C double bond, demonstrating that bismuth yldiides can engage in bond activation through bismuth&#8208;ligand cooperativity.

         <title>Effective and Selective Hydrogenation of Methyl Acrylate to Methyl Propionate on Single&#8208;Atom Nickel Catalyst</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Development of highly efficient, selective, and stable single&#8208;atom catalyst (SAC) is an important research hotspot in the field of hydrogenation, due to the atomic utilization of active component. In this study, an effective single&#8208;atom nickel catalyst with a specific coordination structure of Ni&#9472;N4 was constructed using Ni&#8208;containing ZIF&#8208;8 as precursor for efficient hydrogenation of methyl acrylate to methyl propionate in the fixed&#8208;bed reactor. Multiple characterization techniques including HAADF&#8208;STEM, H2&#8208;TPR, XRD, and XAFS were utilized to systematically analyze the structure and physicochemical properties of as&#8208;prepared catalyst series. The effects of catalyst preparation and hydrogenation conditions on the catalytic performance were evaluated and further optimized. As a result, the turn of frequency (TOF) could reach up to 200.8 h&#8722;1 for methyl propionate production, with catalytic selectivity of 100%. In situ IR experiments were performed to monitor the hydrogenation mechanism on the catalyst surface, as well as kinetic studies for confirmation of reaction order and activation barrier. This study will provide a new strategy for the design and of non&#8208;noble metal SAC for the hydrogenation of methyl acrylate.

         <title>Light&#8208;controlled 1D to 2D 2,3&#8208;Diaminophenazine Self&#8208;assembly Transformation on Cu(111) Surface</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel on&#8208;surface transformation from 1D to 2D self&#8208;assembly is achieved. This work demonstrates the feasibility of a series of reactions that are conventionally thermally prohibited due to their entropy&#8208;driven amorphization tendency. The specific stimuli&#8208;selective pathway enables precise molecular control in the field of self&#8208;assembly.








Abstract
Controlled molecular self&#8208;assembly enables precise engineering of nanomaterials with programmable dimensionality and functionality.

&lt;p&gt;A novel on-surface transformation from 1D to 2D self-assembly is achieved. This work demonstrates the feasibility of a series of reactions that are conventionally thermally prohibited due to their entropy-driven amorphization tendency. The specific stimuli-selective pathway enables precise molecular control in the field of self-assembly.

         <title>Eco&#8208;Friendly Synthesis of Cobalt Phthalocyanine for High&#8208;Efficiency CO2${\rm CO}_{2}$ Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A sustainable synthesis of cobalt phthalocyanine (CoPc) using low&#8208;impact solvents yields high&#8208;performance electrocatalysts with reduced waste (E&#8208;factor 18.6). When integrated into gas diffusion electrodes, CoPc achieves up to 12% Faradays efficiency for CO2&#8208;to&#8208;methanol and 65% CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion, aligning with state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art materials and enabling greener CO2 reduction (CO2RR).








ABSTRACT
We report a sustainable and cost&#8208;effective synthesis of cobalt phthalocyanine (CoPc) using low&#8208;impact solvents and a streamlined purification procedure, achieving an 85% yield with limited waste generation, as indicated by an environmental factor (E&#8208;factor) of 18.6. This route provides an eco&#8208;friendly approach to producing a molecular electrocatalyst for CO2${\rm CO}_{2}$ reduction. The catalytic activity of the synthesized CoPc is validated by its integration into a gas diffusion electrode with carbon nanotube supports, exhibiting methanol production with a Faradaic efficiency up to 12%, matching the values reached with the conventionally synthesized counterparts. Notably, under high loading (micrometric crystallites of CoPc), CO2${\rm CO}_{2}$&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion reached 65%, in fair alignment with literature benchmarks. Our work shows that green synthesis can yield high&#8208;performance catalysts for CO2${\rm CO}_{2}$ electrochemical reduction (CO2RR${\rm CO}_{2}{\rm RR}$), enabling sustainable methanol&#160;production.

         <title>Azulene in a Bowl: A Nonalternant Buckybowl With 5/7 Topology, Azulene&#8208;Derived Properties, and Fullerene Complexation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first azulene&#8208;based buckybowl with a distinctive 5/7 ring topology has been synthesized and thoroughly characterized, demonstrating the ability to assemble with fullerene C60 or C70. The incorporation of the nonalternant azulene unit endows this novel buckybowl with unique electronic and photophysical properties, including a narrow HOMO&#8208;LUMO gap, red&#8208;shifted UV&#8208;vis absorption, anti&#8208;Kasha emission, and reversible proton&#8208;responsive behavior.








ABSTRACT
Despite the intriguing potential of azulene&#8208;embedded nanocarbons, their integration into curved buckybowl architectures has remained unexplored due to synthetic and stability challenges. Herein, we report an azulene&#8208;containing buckybowl 6, synthesized via a concise four&#8208;step route where the azulene core remains stable without rearrangement to naphthalene. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray analysis revealed that 6 adopts a nonalternant, bowl&#8208;shaped geometric configuration. Unlike classical buckybowls (e.g., corannulene, dibenzo[a,g]corannulene, and summane), 6 exhibits distinct azulene&#8208;derived properties: red&#8208;shifted UV&#8208;vis absorption, anti&#8208;Kasha photoluminescence, and reversible proton&#8208;responsive behavior. Theoretical studies reveal unique aromaticity in its central pentagon, diverging from known pentagon&#8208;containing buckybowls. Furthermore, it was found that buckybowl 6 can assemble with fullerene C60 or C70 in a 1:1 stoichiometry. This work establishes 6 as the unique azulene&#8208;based buckybowl and pioneers a design strategy for nonalternant, positively curved &#960;&#8208;systems with 5/7 ring topologies and tunable optoelectronic properties.

         <title>Latest Progress on Synchronous Removal of Multiple Heavy Metal Cations and Anions: Adsorbent Design and Mechanism Elucidation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
ABSTRACT
The development of highly efficient remediation technologies for heavy metal pollution has attracted widespread attention. Due to the &#8220;trade&#8208;off&#8221; effect arising from the different occurrence states and physical&#8208;chemical properties of heavy metal cations and anions in the different pH environments, the remediation of coexisting multiple heavy metal contamination is significantly complex and challenging. As such, the investigation of highly selective and efficient adsorbents for multiple heavy metals removal is the present focus of the scientific and industrial community. Under such circumstances, we report the latest progress on multiple heavy metals removal in this review. Firstly, we summarize the current situation of heavy metal contamination and the corresponding remediation methods. Secondly, we divide the discussion into three sections, including the heavy metal cation removal, heavy metal anion removal, and the coexisting multiple heavy metal removal from the perspective of removal mechanisms and the used adsorbents. Finally, we highlight the future challenges and opportunities in the development of promising adsorbents for multiple heavy metals removal.

         <title>A Versatile System of Solvent, Catalyst, and Ligand for Challenging Biphenyl Synthesis Through Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling reactions with electron&#8208;deficient haloarenes and electron&#8208;deficient areneboronic acids proceed with moderate to excellent yields in N&#8208;methylpyrrolidone as solvent, Pd(dba)3 as catalyst, CuI as cocatalyst, and Davephos as ligand.








ABSTRACT
Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling reactions are difficult when both reaction partners (boronic acid and halide) are electron&#8208;poor. We describe here a system of solvent, catalyst, and ligand with which also electron&#8208;poor substrates react, without the necessity to try several conditions. The system consists of N&#8208;methylpyrrolidone as solvent, tris(dibenzylidenaceton)dipalladium(0) as catalyst, CuI as cocatalyst, and Davephos as ligand. This combination yields little or no Ullmann product, and the desired cross&#8208;coupling product is in moderate to excellent yields.

         <title>Facile Synthesis of 2D Metal&#8208;Organic Framework as an Efficient Heterogeneous Catalyst for the Epoxidation of Olefin With H2O2</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using the sacrificial template method, metal porphyrin was attached in situ to the ZnO surface to prepare surfactant&#8208;free, highly dispersed Zn&#8208;TCPP(Mn)/ZnO, which had a positive effect on the stability and activity of the catalyst. Notably, styrene underwent complete conversion within 20 min, with an impressive epoxide selectivity reaching 97%, and exhibits a remarkable conversion frequency of 1980 h&#8722;1. More significantly, the composite catalyst Zn&#8208;TCPP(Mn)/ZnO exhibits a structurally stable framework and maintains a substantial level of catalytic activity even after undergoing five consecutive cycles. Meanwhile, other substrates exhibited varying degrees of selectivity, ranging from moderate to commendable.








ABSTRACT
The 2D ultrathin MOF nanosheets, which effectively integrate metals and functional ligands, possess the advantageous features of molecular catalysts and exhibit remarkable catalytic activity in multiphase catalysis. Herein, we employed the sacrificial template method to achieve in situ attachment of metalloporphyrin onto a ZnO substrate, resulting in the formation of surfactant&#8208;free 2D dispersed structures of Zn&#8208;TCPP(Mn)/ZnO. The multilayered stacked B&#8208;Zn&#8208;TCPP(Mn) (3D) blocks were prepared by growing Zn2+ mixed with metalloporphyrin as a comparison. The novel composite catalyst Zn&#8208;TCPP(Mn)/ZnO was employed for the efficient epoxidation of various alkenes using H2O2 as an oxidant at ambient temperatures. Notably, alkenes conversion within 20 min achieves a high yield and impressive 1980 h&#8722;1 turnover frequency. The composite catalyst can still maintain its structural integrity after undergoing five consecutive cycles, and the total yield of oxidized styrene is slightly reduced. This was confirmed by a series of characterization analyses and other assessments. Additionally, comparative experiments revealed that the B&#8208;Zn&#8208;TCPP(Mn) blocks underwent partial exfoliation into 2D nanosheets following the catalytic reaction, thereby enhancing the catalytic conversion efficiency in subsequent epoxidation reactions. This finding provides compelling evidence for the heightened catalytic activity of 2D materials.

&lt;p&gt;Using the sacrificial template method, metal porphyrin was attached in situ to the ZnO surface to prepare surfactant-free, highly dispersed Zn-TCPP(Mn)/ZnO, which had a positive effect on the stability and activity of the catalyst. Notably, styrene underwent complete conversion within 20 min, with an impressive epoxide selectivity reaching 97%, and exhibits a remarkable conversion frequency of 1980 h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;. More significantly, the composite catalyst Zn-TCPP(Mn)/ZnO exhibits a structurally stable framework and maintains a substantial level of catalytic activity even after undergoing five consecutive cycles. Meanwhile, other substrates exhibited varying degrees of selectivity, ranging from moderate to commendable.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 2D ultrathin MOF nanosheets, which effectively integrate metals and functional ligands, possess the advantageous features of molecular catalysts and exhibit remarkable catalytic activity in multiphase catalysis. Herein, we employed the sacrificial template method to achieve in situ attachment of metalloporphyrin onto a ZnO substrate, resulting in the formation of surfactant-free 2D dispersed structures of Zn-TCPP(Mn)/ZnO. The multilayered stacked B-Zn-TCPP(Mn) (3D) blocks were prepared by growing Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; mixed with metalloporphyrin as a comparison. The novel composite catalyst Zn-TCPP(Mn)/ZnO was employed for the efficient epoxidation of various alkenes using H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; as an oxidant at ambient temperatures. Notably, alkenes conversion within 20 min achieves a high yield and impressive 1980 h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; turnover frequency.

This was confirmed by a series of characterization analyses and other assessments.

         <title>Enantioselective Assembly of Si&#8208;Stereogenic Sila&#8208;[1,4]oxazines via Sequential Si&#9472;O/Si&#9472;C Dehydrocoupling</title>

An iridium&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective dehydrogenative coupling for synthesizing silicon&#8208;stereogenic sila&#8208;[1,4]oxazines is reported. This method directly constructs Si&#8208;stereogenic centers with high enantioselectivity, offering new avenues for silicon&#8208;containing heterocycles.








ABSTRACT
Silacycles have shown great promise in medicinal chemistry, agrochemistry, and materials science. In this study, we report an efficient iridium&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective dehydrogenative coupling of pyrrolo&#8208;phenol derivatives with dihydrosilanes, which leads to the synthesis of Si&#8208;stereogenic sila&#8208;[1,4]oxazines with excellent enantioselectivity. This method successfully integrates silicon into the bioactive [1,4]oxazine framework, broadening the application scope of silicon&#8208;containing heterocycles. Mechanistic studies indicate a two&#8208;step sequence: an enantioselective Ir&#8208;catalyzed Si&#9472;O dehydrocoupling, followed by an intramolecular Si&#9472;C coupling.

         <title>Observation of Quinoxalinyl Radical Produced by Muonium Addition to 1,2&#8208;Diisocyanobenzene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This muon spectroscopic study analyzed a 1,2&#8208;diisocyanobenzene derivative, which led to the isocyanide insertion process. The transverse&#8208;field muon spin rotation (TF&#8208;&#181;SR) measurements observed the quinoxalinyl radical, and the imidoyl radical did not appear due to the prompt cyclization occurring faster than the muon timescale. The &#181;SR&#8208;characterized paramagnetic species was an aryl &#963; radical, exhibiting the corresponding high reactivity in the THF (tetrahydrofuran) solution.








ABSTRACT
Radical isocyanide (isonitrile) insertion reactions have advanced considerably, yet the nature of the underlying paramagnetic intermediates remains poorly understood. We previously studied the isocyanide insertion of muonium (Mu), a light isotope of hydrogen, into 2&#8208;isocyano&#8208;1,1&#8242;&#8208;biphenyls by transverse field muon spin rotation (TF&#8208;&#181;SR) spectroscopy and characterized the resulting radical, which was identified as an imidoyl radical. The cyclized product was not observed on the microsecond timescale. To gain deeper insight, we now report TF&#8208;&#181;SR spectra of 1,2&#8208;diisocyano&#8208;3,4,5,6&#8208;tetramethylbenzene in both THF solution and the crystalline state. A single muoniated radical species was observed, displaying an unusually small muon hyperfine coupling constant (hfc). Guided by density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we identified this species as a quinoxalinyl radical, formed via intramolecular cyclization of the imidoyl intermediate. This observation implies that the imidoyl radical survives only on the nanosecond timescale before cyclization.
