         <title>Switching from Metal&#8208; to Ligand&#8208;Based Oxidation in Cobalt Complexes with Redox&#8208;Active Bisguanidine Ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The substitution of the methyl groups of acetylacetonato (acac) co&#8208;ligands in a cobalt(II) complex with a redox&#8208;active bisguanidine ligand by trifluoromethyl groups (hfacac co&#8208;ligands) changes the redox properties. One&#8208;electron oxidation of the complexes with acac co&#8208;ligands is metal centered (Co(II)&#8594;Co(III)). By contrast, a radical monocationic bisguanidine ligand is formed upon one&#8208;electron oxidation of the complexes with hfacac co&#8208;ligands. The changes are accompanied by distinct changes in the magnetic and optical properties.







Abstract
The control of the redox reactivity, magnetic and optical properties of the different redox states of complexes with redox&#8208;active ligands permits their rational use in catalysis and materials science. The redox&#8208;chemistry of octahedrally coordinated high&#8208;spin CoII complexes (three unpaired electrons) with one redox&#8208;active bisguanidine ligand and two acetylacetonato (acac) co&#8208;ligands is completely changed by replacing the acac by hexafluoro&#8208;acetylacetonato (hfacac) co&#8208;ligands. The first one&#8208;electron oxidation is metal&#8208;centered in the case of the complexes with acac co&#8208;ligands, giving diamagnetic CoIII complexes. By contrast, in the case of the less Lewis&#8208;basic hfacac co&#8208;ligands, the first one&#8208;electron oxidation becomes ligand&#8208;centered, leading to high&#8208;spin CoII complexes with a radical monocationic guanidine ligand unit (four unpaired electrons). Ferromagnetic coupling between the spins on the metal and the organic radical in solution is evidenced by temperature&#8208;dependent paramagnetic NMR studies, allowing to estimate the isotropic exchange coupling constant in solution. Second one&#8208;electron oxidation leads to high&#8208;spin CoII complexes with dicationic guanidine ligand units (three unpaired electrons) in the presence of hfacac co&#8208;ligands, but to low&#8208;spin CoIII complexes with radical monocationic, peralkylated guanidine ligand (one unpaired electron) in the presence of acac co&#8208;ligands. The analysis of the electronic structures is complemented by quantum&#8208;chemical calculations on the spin density distributions and relative energies of the possible redox isomers.

         <title>A Novel Reactivity of Phosphanylalumane (&gt;P&#8722;Al&lt;): Reversible Addition of a Saturated Interelement Bond to Olefins</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Keen on alkenes: Phosphanylalumane (P&#8722;Al single&#8208;bond compound) was treated with relatively small terminal olefins (ethylene, propylene, and hex&#8208;1&#8208;ene) at room temperature. Heating of propylene&#8208; and hex&#8208;1&#8208;ene adducts regenerated the P&#8722;Al bond with liberation of the corresponding olefins. An unprecedented reactivity of the ethylene adduct with the release of ethylene was demonstrated, in sharp contrast to the conventional P/B system.







Abstract
The reversible addition of olefins to a phosphanylalumane, P&#8722;Al single&#8208;bond species, was investigated. The P&#8722;Al bond added to ethylene and relatively small terminal alkenes (propylene and hex&#8208;1&#8208;ene) at room temperature to give the corresponding alkene adducts. Heating the terminal alkene adducts released the corresponding alkenes and regenerated the P&#8722;Al bond, but no release of ethylene was observed even under vacuum conditions. The reactivity of ethylene adduct as a new saturated C2 vicinal P/Al&#8208;based FLP was also investigated. The ethylene adduct was found to undergo complexation with nitriles to give the corresponding nitrile adducts to the Al center, which retained the ethylene tether as in the case of the corresponding P/B&#8208;based FLP. However, the reactivity of ethylene toward CO2 and benzaldehyde differed from that of the P/B system giving the corresponding adducts.

         <title>Fluorinated &#945;&#8208;Diimine Nickel Mediated Ethylene (Co)Polymerization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>

Fluorine effect in olefin polymerization: Fluorine substituents at various positions (ortho&#8208;, meta&#8208;, and para&#8208;) and with different numbers (n=0, 1, 2, 3, and 5) have been systematically studied for the first time in the nickel &#945;&#8208;diimine promoted ethylene polymerization and copolymerization with polar monomer, which show great influence on catalytic activity, polymer molecular weight, branching density, and incorporation of polar monomer.







Abstract
Fluorine substituents in transition metal catalysts are of great importance in olefin polymerization catalysis; however, the comprehensive effect of fluorine substituents is elusive in seminal late transition metal &#945;&#8208;diimine catalytic system. In this contribution, fluorine substituents at various positions (ortho&#8208;, meta&#8208;, and para&#8208;F) and with different numbers (Fn; n=0, 1, 2, 3, 5) were installed into the well&#8208;defined N&#8208;terphenyl amine and thus were studied for the first time in the nickel &#945;&#8208;diimine promoted ethylene polymerization and copolymerization with polar monomers. The position of the fluorine substituent was particularly crucial in these polymerization reactions in terms of catalytic activity, polymer molecular weight, branching density, and incorporation of polar monomer, and thus a picture on the fluorine effect was given. As a notable result, the ortho&#8208;F substituted &#945;&#8208;diimine nickel catalyst produced highly linear polyethylenes with an extremely high molecular weight (Mw=8703&#8197;kDa) and a significantly low degree of branching of 1.4/1000&#8197;C; however, the meta&#8208;F and/or para&#8208;F substituted &#945;&#8208;diimine nickel catalysts generated highly branched (up to 80.2/1000&#8197;C) polyethylenes with significantly low molecular weights (Mw=20&#8208;50&#8197;kDa).

         <title>RNA Ligation for Mono and Dually Labeled RNAs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Labeling of long RNAs, protein&#8208;coding RNAs in particular, still poses a challenge. We developed new adenosine 3&#8217;,5&#8217;&#8208;bisphophate analogues as reagents for RNA 3&#8217;&#8208;end labeling by T4 RNA ligase. The compounds were efficient T4 substrates yielding 3&#8217;&#8208;mono&#8208;labeled RNAs with various 5&#8217;&#8208;ends (triphosphate, NAD). Combination of 3&#8217;&#8208; and 5&#8217;&#8208;end labeling yielded dually labeled m7G&#8208;capped RNAs that enabled quantitative analysis of decapping and were translationally active. The proposed method enables the creation of versatile probes for investigation of RNA function and localization.







Abstract
Labeled RNAs are invaluable probes for investigation of RNA function and localization. However, mRNA labeling remains challenging. Here, we developed an improved method for 3&#8242;&#8208;end labeling of in&#8197;vitro transcribed RNAs. We synthesized novel adenosine 3&#8242;,5&#8242;&#8208;bisphosphate analogues modified at the N6 or C2 position of adenosine with an azide&#8208;containing linker, fluorescent label, or biotin and assessed these constructs as substrates for RNA labeling directly by T4 ligase or via postenzymatic strain&#8208;promoted alkyne&#8208;azide cycloaddition (SPAAC). All analogues were substrates for T4 RNA ligase. Analogues containing bulky fluorescent labels or biotin showed better overall labeling yields than postenzymatic SPAAC. We successfully labeled uncapped RNAs, NAD&#8208;capped RNAs, and 5&#8242;&#8208;fluorescently labeled m7Gp3Am&#8208;capped mRNAs. The obtained highly homogenous dually labeled mRNA was translationally active and enabled fluorescence&#8208;based monitoring of decapping. This method will facilitate the use of various functionalized mRNA&#8208;based probes.

The efficient self&#8208;templated formation of optically active 2,6&#8208;bis(1,2,3&#8208;triazol&#8208;4&#8208;yl)pyridine (btp)&#8208;derived homocircuit [2]catenane enantiomers (S,S)(S,S) and (R,R)(R,R) is reported. This represents the first example of the enantiopure formation of chiral homocircuit [2]catenanes from starting materials consisting of a classical chiral element such as a chiral centre. The self&#8208;assembly reaction was monitored closely in solution facilitating the characterization of the pseudo&#8208;rotaxane reaction intermediate prior to mechanically interlocking the pre&#8208;organised system via ring&#8208;closing metathesis.

We report the efficient self&#8208;templated formation of optically active 2,6&#8208;bis(1,2,3&#8208;triazol&#8208;4&#8208;yl)pyridine (btp) derived homocircuit [2]catenane enantiomers. This represents the first example of the enantiopure formation of chiral btp homocircuit [2]catenanes from starting materials consisting of a classical chiral element; X&#8208;ray diffraction crystallography enabled the structural characterization of the [2]catenane.

         <title>Competitive Coordination of Chloride and Fluoride Anions Towards Trivalent Lanthanide Cations (La3+ and Nd3+) in Molten Salts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The chemical speciation of trivalent lanthanide Ln(III) in different molten salts is studied in this work. In molten LiCl&#8208;KCl&#8208;LnCl3, six chloride anions (Cl&#8722;, green ball) are coordinated with the trivalent lanthanide cation (Ln3+, orange ball) and form the [LnCl6]3&#8722; species (left). After the addition of LiF, the maximum number of fluoride anion (F&#8722;, purple ball) involved in the first coordination shell of Ln(III) is three, and the possible complexes are [LnCl5F]3&#8722;, [LnCl4F2]3&#8722;, and [LnCl4F3]4&#8722; (right).







Abstract
Molten salt electrolysis is a vital technique to produce high&#8208;purity lanthanide metals and alloys. However, the coordination environments of lanthanides in molten salts, which heavily affect the related redox potential and electrochemical properties, have not been well elucidated. Here, the competitive coordination of chloride and fluoride anions towards lanthanide cations (La3+ and Nd3+) is explored in molten LiCl&#8208;KCl&#8208;LiF&#8208;LnCl3 salts using electrochemical, spectroscopic, and computational approaches. Electrochemical analyses show that significant negative shifts in the reduction potential of Ln3+ occur when F&#8722; concentration increases, indicating that the F&#8722; anions interact with Ln3+ via substituting the coordinated Cl&#8722; anions, and confirm [LnClxFy]3&#8722;x&#8722;y (ymax=3) complexes are prevailing in molten salts. Spectroscopic and computational results on solution structures further reveal the competition between Cl&#8722; and F&#8722; anions, which leads to the formation of four distinct Ln(III) species: [LnCl6]3&#8722;, [LnCl5F]3&#8722;, [LnCl4F2]3&#8722; and [LnCl4F3]4&#8722;. Among them, the seven&#8208;coordinated [LnCl4F3]4&#8722; complex possesses a low&#8208;symmetry structure evidenced by the pattern change of Raman spectra. After comparing the polarizing power (Z/r) among different metal cations, it was concluded that Ln&#8722;F interaction is weaker than that between transition metal and F&#8722; ions.

         <title>Pathways of the Extremely Reactive Iron(IV)&#8208;oxido complexes with Tetradentate Bispidine Ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The nonheme iron(IV)&#8208;oxido complex trans&#8208;N3&#8208;[(L1)FeIV=O(Cl)]+ is an extremely reactive oxidant for OAT and HAA processes and is the most reactive nonheme iron model system known so far and of similar reactivity as nonheme iron enzymes. Discussed are spectroscopic and kinetic data, supported by a DFT&#8208;based theoretical analysis. In bulk reactions cyclohexane is selectively oxidized to chlorocyclohexane.







Abstract
The nonheme iron(IV)&#8208;oxido complex trans&#8208;N3&#8208;[(L1)FeIV=O(Cl)]+, where L1 is a derivative of the tetradentate bispidine 2,4&#8208;di(pyridine&#8208;2&#8208;yl)&#8208;3,7&#8208;diazabicyclo[3.3.1]nonane&#8208;1&#8208;one, is known to have an S=1 electronic ground state and to be an extremely reactive oxidant for oxygen atom transfer (OAT) and hydrogen atom abstraction (HAA) processes. Here we show that, in spite of this ferryl oxidant having the &#8220;wrong&#8221; spin ground state, it is the most reactive nonheme iron model system known so far and of a similar order of reactivity as nonheme iron enzymes (C&#8722;H abstraction of cyclohexane, &#8722;90&#8201;&#176;C (propionitrile), t1/2=3.5&#8197;sec). Discussed are spectroscopic and kinetic data, supported by a DFT&#8208;based theoretical analysis, which indicate that substrate oxidation is significantly faster than self&#8208;decay processes due to an intramolecular demethylation pathway and formation of an oxido&#8208;bridged diiron(III) intermediate. It is also shown that the iron(III)&#8208;chlorido&#8208;hydroxido/cyclohexyl radical intermediate, resulting from C&#8722;H abstraction, selectively produces chlorocyclohexane in a rebound process. However, the life&#8208;time of the intermediate is so long that other reaction channels (known as cage escape) become important, and much of the C&#8722;H abstraction therefore is unproductive. In bulk reactions at ambient temperature and at longer time scales, there is formation of significant amounts of oxidation product &#8211; selectively of chlorocyclohexane &#8211; and it is shown that this originates from oxidation of the oxido&#8208;bridged diiron(III) resting state.

         <title>Practical Enzymatic Production of Carbocycles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recent years have witnessed a rapid growth of biocatalytic methods in organic synthesis. This Minireview summarizes the developments in the current state of the art for practical enzyme&#8208;mediated assembly of carbocycles, drawing special attention to case studies that have been performed on preparative scale.







Abstract
The Pd&#8208;catalyzed carbon&#8208;carbon bond formation pioneered by Heck in 1969 has dominated medicinal chemistry development for the ensuing fifty years. As the demand for more complex three&#8208;dimensional active pharmaceuticals continues to increase, preparative enzyme&#8208;mediated assembly, by virtue of its exquisite selectivity and sustainable nature, is poised to provide a practical and affordable alternative for accessing such compounds. In this minireview, we summarize recent state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art developments in practical enzyme&#8208;mediated assembly of carbocycles. When appropriate, background information on the enzymatic transformation is provided and challenges and/or limitations are also highlighted.

         <title>Electrochemical Evaluation of Diketopyrrolopyrrole Derivatives for Nonaqueous Redox Flow Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Blown out of the water: TDPP&#8208;Hex&#8208;CN4, a diketopyrrolopyrrole derivative, was used as anolyte in an all&#8208;organic nonaqueous redox flow battery. Flow cells were assembled with unisol blue and DBBB as catholytes. Both were stable for up to 100 cycles, retaining above &#8764;70&#8201;% capacity. Symmetric flow&#8208;cell and UV&#8208;visible spectroscopy studies of anolyte and both catholytes suggest that TDPP&#8208;Hex&#8208;CN4 is a stable anolyte, and the observed loss in capacity can be attributed to the unstable nature the of catholytes.







Abstract
Redox flow batteries (RFBs) employing nonaqueous electrolytes could potentially operate at much higher cell voltages, and therefore afford higher energy and power densities, than RFBs employing aqueous electrolytes. The development of such high&#8208;voltage nonaqueous RFBs requires anolytes that are electrochemically stable, especially in the presence of traces of oxygen and/or moisture. The inherent atmospheric reactivity of anolytes mandates judicious molecular design with high electron affinity and electrochemical stability. In this study, diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP)&#8208;based TDPP&#8208;Hex&#8208;CN4 is proposed as a stable redox&#8208;active molecule for anolytes in nonaqueous organic RFBs. We demonstrate organic RFBs using TDPP&#8208;Hex&#8208;CN4 as anolyte with unisol blue (UB) 1,4&#8208;bis(isopropylamino)anthraquinone and 1,4&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;2,5&#8208;bis(2&#8208;methoxyethoxy)benzene (DBBB) as catholytes. Cyclic voltammetry measurements with scans repeated over 200 cycles were performed to establish the electrochemical stability of the redox pairs. Symmetric flow&#8208;cell studies show that TDPP&#8208;Hex&#8208;CN4 exhibits stable capacity up to 700 cycles. Redox flow cells employing TDPP&#8208;Hex&#8208;CN4 /UB and TDPP&#8208;Hex&#8208;CN4/DBBB as redox pairs demonstrate that DPP derivatives are propitious materials for anolytes in all organic nonaqueous RFBs.

         <title>Molten&#8208;Salt&#8208;Assisted Annealing for Making Colloidal ZnGa2O4:Cr Nanocrystals with High Persistent Luminescence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new concept in molten salt confinement to thermally anneal as&#8208;synthesized sub&#8208;10&#8197;nm ZnGa2O4:Cr3+ colloidal nanocrystals in a molten salt medium at 650&#8201;&#176;C is presented. This improves their persistent luminescence intensity and lifetime without any loss of their nanostructural characteristics, water dispersibility or biocompatibility.







Abstract
Persistent luminescent nanocrystals (PLNCs) in the sub&#8208;10&#8197;nm domain are considered to be the most fascinating inventions in lighting technology owing to their excellent performance in anti&#8208;counterfeiting, luminous paints, bioimaging, security applications, etc. Further improvement of persistent luminescence (PersL) intensity and lifetime is needed to achieve the desired success of PLNCs while keeping the uniform sub&#8208;10&#8197;nm size. In this work, the concept of molten salt confinement to thermally anneal as&#8208;synthesized ZnGa2O4:Cr3+ (ZGOC) colloidal NCs (CNCs) in a molten salt medium at 650&#8201;&#176;C is introduced. This method led to significantly monodispersed and few agglomerated NCs with a much improved photoluminescence (PL) and PersL intensity without much growth in the size of the pristine CNCs. Other strategies such as i) thermal annealing, ii) overcoating, and iii) the core&#8211;shell strategy have also been tried to improve PL and PersL but did not improve them simultaneously. Moreover, directly annealing the CNCs in air without the assistance of molten salt could significantly improve both PL and PersL but led to particle heterogeneity and aggregation, which are highly unsuitable for in&#8197;vivo imaging. We believe this work provides a novel strategy to design PLNCs with high PL intensity and long PersL duration without losing their nanostructural characteristics, water dispersibility and biocompatibility.

         <title>Promoted NIR&#8208;II Fluorescent Brightness&#8220;Ring&#8208;fusion&#8221; for Detection of Intestinal Inflammation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fluorophores with emission in the second near&#8208;infrared window (NIR&#8208;II) have displayed salient advantages for biomedical applications. However, to achieve red&#8208;shifted wavelengths, the common strategy by reducing the energy bandgap of fluorophores always leads to compromised fluorescent brightness. Herein, we propose a molecular design concept by &#8220;ring&#8208;fusion&#8221; to modify the acceptor of AIEgen, which can extend the luminous wavelength from NIR&#8208;I to NIR&#8208;II. The yielded fluorophore (TTQP) with fused acceptor has shown enhanced absorption coefficient with a higher brightness in the nanoparticle formation, as compared to its NIR&#8208;I emissive counterpart (TTQ&#8208;DP) with the non&#8208;fused acceptor. Theoretical calculation further confirms that the ring&#8208;fusion action can efficiently promote the rigidity and planarity of the electron&#8208;deficient core, leading to a lower reorganization energy and nonradiative decay. The yielded TTQP NPs thus allow sensitive NIR&#8208;II fluorescence imaging of vasculature and intestinal inflammation in mice models. Therefore, we anticipate that our work will provide a promising molecular engineering strategy to enrich the library and broaden the application scope of NIR&#8208;II fluorophores.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Vitamin D receptor ligands have potential for the treatment of hyperproliferative diseases and disorders related to the immune system.

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembled Cationic Polypeptide Supramolecular Nanogels for Intracellular DNA Delivery</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Wrapped in a peptide box: Supramolecular nanogels self&#8208;assembled from poly&#8208;L&#8208;lysine (PLL) modified with host and guest units can entrap molecular cargo such as DNA and deliver it into cells for transfection. The PLL is made by N&#8208;carboxyanhydride polymerization and equipped with cyclodextrin and adamantane groups. The size of the nanogel can be tuned by the length of the PLL and smaller nanogels are better transfection agents.







Abstract
Supramolecular nanogels are an emerging class of polymer nanocarriers for intracellular delivery, due to their straightforward preparation, biocompatibility, and capability to spontaneously encapsulate biologically active components such as DNA. A completely biodegradable three&#8208;component cationic supramolecular nanogel was designed exploiting the multivalent host&#8208;guest interaction of cyclodextrin and adamantane attached to a polypeptide backbone. While cyclodextrin was conjugated to linear poly&#8208;L&#8208;lysine, adamantane was grafted to linear as well as star shaped poly&#8208;L&#8208;lysine. Size control of nanogels was obtained with the increase in the length of the host and guest polymer. Moreover, smaller nanogels were obtained using the star shaped polymers because of the compact nature of star polymers compared to linear polymers. Nanogels were loaded with anionic model cargoes, pyranine and carboxyfluorescein, and their enzyme responsive release was studied using protease trypsin. Confocal microscopy revealed successful transfection of mammalian HeLa cells and intracellular release of pyranine and plasmid DNA, as quantified using a luciferase assay, showing that supramolecular polypeptide nanogels have significant potential in gene therapy applications.

Confocal microscopy revealed successful transfection of mammalian HeLa cells and intracellular release of pyranine and plasmid DNA, as quantified using a luciferase assay, showing that supramolecular polypeptide nanogels have significant potential in gene therapy applications.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Tracking the Electrocatalytic Activity of a Single Palladium Nanoparticle for the Hydrogen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stochastic collision model: A carbon ultramicroelectrode (C&#8208;UME) is used to obtain a 2&#8211;5 orders magnitude enhancement of maximum turnover frequency (kcat) by stochastic collision electrochemistry compared with the ensemble electrochemistry. The electrocatalytic activity of nanoparticle&#8208;based electrocatalysts is directly related to their working conditions, and the electrocatalytic heterogeneity among palladium nanoparticles (Pd NPs) could be displayed by stochastic collision electrochemistry.







Abstract
The nanoparticle&#8208;based electrocatalysts&#8217; performance is directly related to their working conditions. In general, a number of nanoparticles are uncontrollably fixed on a millimetre&#8208;sized electrode for electrochemical measurements. However, it is hard to reveal the maximum electrocatalytic activity owing to the aggregation and detachment of nanoparticles on the electrode surface. To solve this problem, here, we take the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) catalyzed by palladium nanoparticles (Pd NPs) as a model system to track the electrocatalytic activity of single Pd NPs by stochastic collision electrochemistry and ensemble electrochemistry, respectively. Compared with the nanoparticle fixed working condition, Pd NPs in the nanoparticle diffused working condition results in a 2&#8211;5 orders magnitude enhancement of electrocatalytic activity for HER at various bias potential. Stochastic collision electrochemistry with high temporal resolution gives further insights into the accurate study of NPs&#8217; electrocatalytic performance, enabling to dramatically enhance electrocatalytic efficiency.

         <title>Selectively Deoxyfluorinated N&#8208;Acetyllactosamine Analogues as 19F NMR Probes to Study Carbohydrate&#8208;Galectin Interactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Galectins are widely expressed galactose&#8208;binding lectins implied, for example, in immune regulation, metastatic spreading, and pathogen recognition.  N&#8208;Acetyllactosamine (Gal&#946;1&#8208;4GlcNAc, LacNAc) and its oligomeric or glycosylated forms are natural ligands of galectins. To probe substrate specificity and binding mode of galectins, we synthesized a complete series of six mono&#8208;deoxyfluorinated analogues of LacNAc, in which each hydroxyl has been selectively replaced by fluorine while the anomeric position has been protected as methyl &#946;&#8208;glycoside. Initial evaluation of their binding to human galectin&#8208;1 and &#8208;3 by ELISA and  19F NMR  T2  &#8208;filter revealed that deoxyfluorination at C3, C4&#8242; and C6&#8242; completely abolished binding to galectin&#8208;1 but very weak binding to galectin&#8208;3 was still detectable. Moreover, deoxyfluorination of C2&#8242; caused an approximately 8&#8208;fold increase in the&#160;binding affinity towards galectin&#8208;1, whereas binding to galectin&#8208;3 was essentially not affected. Lipophilicity measurement revealed that deoxyfluorination at the Gal moiety affects log  P  very differently compared to deoxyfluorination at the GlcNAc moiety.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Zeolitic vanadotungstates with tunable microporosity have potential interests in gas separation. The pore openings of the materials are in between the diameters of normal butane and isobutane, which causes the materials only adsorb normal butane. The breakthrough experiments show that the materials effectively separate normal butane from the normal butane and isobutane mixture even at high temperatures. The robust materials can be reused without loss of the separation performance.</dc:description>

         <title>NHC Effects on Reduction Dynamics in Iron&#8208;catalyzed Organic Transformations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The high abundance, low toxicity and rich redox chemistry of iron has resulted in a surge of iron catalyzed organic transformations over the last two decades. Within this area, N &#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) ligands have been widely utilized to achieve high yields across reactions including cross&#8208;coupling and C&#8208;H alkylation, amongst others. Central to the development of iron&#8208;NHC catalytic methods is the understanding of iron speciation and the propensity of these species to undergo reduction events, as low&#8208;valent iron species can be advantageous or undesirable from one system to the next. This study highlights the importance of the identity of the NHC on iron speciation upon reaction with EtMgBr, where reactions with SIMes and IMes NHCs were shown to undergo &#946; &#8208;hydride elimination more readily than those with SIPr and IPr NHCs. This insight is vital to developing new iron&#8208;NHC catalyzed transformations as understanding how to control this reduction by simply changing the NHC is central to improving the reactivity in iron&#8208;NHC catalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Tuning the Nanoaggregates of Sialylated Biohybrid Photosensitizers for Intracellular Activation of the Photodynamic Response</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 37, Page 9634-9642, July 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
An insightful approach towards activatable and nanostructured photosensitizers has been developed by preparing dendritic biohybrids composed of a core phthalocyanine decorated with multiple sialic acid moieties. The resulting hybrids self&#8208;assemble into well&#8208;defined nanoaggregates in aqueous solution, and disaggregate upon reaching the target organelles, resulting in the on&#8208;site activation of a highly efficient photodynamic response.







Abstract
In the endeavor of extending the clinical use of photodynamic therapy (PDT) for the treatment of superficial cancers and other neoplastic diseases, deeper knowledge and control of the subcellular processes that determine the response of photosensitizers (PS) are needed. Recent strategies in this direction involve the use of activatable and nanostructured PS. Here, both capacities have been tuned in two dendritic zinc(II) phthalocyanine (ZnPc) derivatives, either asymmetrically or symmetrically substituted with 3 and 12 copies of the carbohydrate sialic acid (SA), respectively. Interestingly, the amphiphilic ZnPc&#8208;SA biohybrid (1) self&#8208;assembles into well&#8208;defined nanoaggregates in aqueous solution, facilitating cellular internalization and transport whereas the PS remains inactive. Within the cells, these nanostructured hybrids localize in the lysosomes, as usually happens for anionic and hydrophilic aggregated PS. Yet, in contrast to most of them (e.&#8201;g., compound 2), hybrid 1 recovers the capacity for photoinduced ROS generation within the target organelles due to its amphiphilic character; this allows disruption of aggregation when the compound is inserted into the lysosomal membrane, with the concomitant highly efficient PDT response.

         <title>Photo&#8208;/Electroinduced Irreversible Isomerization of 2,2&#8217;&#8208;Azobispyridine Ligands in Arene Ruthenium(II) Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 37, Page 9563-9570, July 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
One shot switch in response to light or electrochemical stimuli of 2,2&#8217;&#8208;azobispyridine involved in a 7&#8208;membered chelate ring with a RuII metal center is disclosed. The molecular pathways at work in the course of this transformation were investigated by a combination of analytical and computational techniques, thereby providing a rational for the efficient and irreversible nature of the process.







Abstract
Novel arene RuII complexes containing 2,2&#8217;&#8208;azobispyridine ligands were synthesized and characterized by using 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy, UV/vis spectroscopy, electrochemistry, DFT calculations and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. Z&#8208;configured complexes featuring unprecedented seven&#8208;membered chelate rings involving the nitrogen atom of both pyridines were isolated and were shown to undergo irreversible isomerization to the corresponding E&#8208;configured five&#8208;membered chelate complexes in response to light or electrochemical stimulus.

         <title>Consequences of Amide Connectivity in the Supramolecular Polymerization of Porphyrins: Spectroscopic Observations Rationalized by Theoretical Modelling</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 37, Page 9700-9707, July 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Amide connectivity in the molecular design of porphyrin supramolecular monomers strongly impacts the assembly behavior in nonpolar solvents. While C=O centered monomers aggregate cooperatively into long, 1D supramolecular fibers, their NH&#8208;centered counterparts only form isodesmic J&#8208;aggregates. With a combination of spectroscopy and density functional modelling, the authors shed light on the molecular origins of these differences in properties.







Abstract
The correlation between molecular structure and mechanism of supramolecular polymerizations is a topic of great interest, with a special focus on the pathway complexity of porphyrin assemblies. Their cooperative polymerization typically yields highly ordered, long 1D polymers and is driven by a combination of &#960;&#8208;stacking due to solvophobic effects and hydrogen bonding interactions. Subtle changes in molecular structure, however, have significant influence on the cooperativity factor and yield different aggregate types (J&#8208; versus H&#8208;aggregates) of different lengths. In this study, the influence of amide connectivity on the self&#8208;assembly behavior of porphyrin&#8208;based supramolecular monomers was investigated. While in nonpolar solvents, C=O centered monomers readily assemble into helical supramolecular polymers via a cooperative mechanism, their NH centered counterparts form short, non&#8208;helical J&#8208;type aggregates via an isodesmic pathway. A combination of spectroscopy and density functional theory modelling sheds light on the molecular origins causing this stunning difference in assembly properties and demonstrates the importance of molecular connectivity in the design of supramolecular systems. Finally, their mutual interference in copolymerization experiments is presented.

         <title>Integrated Photoresponsive Alkaline Earth Metal Coordination Networks: Synthesis, Topology, Photochromism and Photoluminescence Investigation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 37, Page 9605-9619, July 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Now you see me: A series of alkaline earth metal coordination networks (&#8220;apples&#8221;) have been synthetizeOd from an amino acid&#8208;naphthalene diimide ligand (&#8220;trunk&#8221;) and Mg2+, Ca2+, and Sr2+ (&#8220;nutriment&#8221;). In addition to their photoluminescence turn&#8208;off toward drug molecules (&#8220;worms&#8221;), they have reusable photochromic properties that would enable them to be used as secret inks or ultraviolet detectors.







Abstract
Photoresponsive materials are a key part of the age of smart technology that have potential in a broad range of applications. Coordination networks (CNs) are widely used due to their designability and stability. In this work, three novel alkaline earth metal coordination networks (AEM&#8208;CNs): [Mg(CMNDI)(H2O)2], [Ca(CMNDI)(H2O)2]&#8901;H2O, and [Sr(CMNDI)(H2O)(DMF)] with fsl, cds, and scn topology nets were synthetized via N,N&#8217;&#8208;bis(carboxymethyl)&#8208;1,4,5,8&#8208;naphthalenediimide (H2CMNDI); the scn net is not found in the Reticular Chemistry Structure Resource or ToposPro. The reusable and sensitive photochromic properties of the three CNs enable them to be used as secret inks or ultraviolet detectors. In addition, the CNs also exhibited reusable photoluminescent turn&#8208;off toward the drug molecules, balsalazide disodium (Bal.) and colchicine (Col.), with good limits of detection of 0.16 and 0.70&#8197;&#956;M. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study of a fluorescence sensor for Bal. Thus, the AEM&#8208;CNs provide a design idea for integrated photoresponsive materials that could be further improved in the near future by further study.

         <title>The Most Active Oxidase&#8208;Mimicking Mn2O3 Nanozyme for Biosensor Signal Generation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 37, Page 9597-9604, July 2, 2021. </description>

Mn2O3 nanoparticles have the highest oxidase&#8208;like activity among the tested metal oxides, but the activity is inhibited by H2O2. Mn3O4 behaves similarly, while the activity of MnO2 is enhanced by H2O2.







Abstract
Oxidase&#8208;mimicking nanozymes are more desirable than peroxidase&#8208;mimicking ones since H2O2 can be omitted. However, only a few nanomaterials are known for oxidase&#8208;like activities. In this work, we compared the activity of Mn2O3, Mn3O4 and MnO2 and found that Mn2O3 had the highest oxidase activity. Interestingly, the activity of Mn2O3 was even inhibited by H2O2. The oxidase&#8208;like activity of Mn2O3 was not much affected by the presence of proteins such as bovine serum albumin (BSA), but the physisorption of antibodies to Mn2O3 was not strong enough to withstand the displacement by BSA. We then treated Mn2O3 with 3&#8208;aminopropyltriethoxysilane to graft an amine group, which was used to conjugate antibodies using glutaraldehyde as a crosslinker. A one&#8208;step indirect competitive ELISA (icELISA) was developed for the detection of isocarbophos, and an IC50 of 261.7&#8197;ng/mL was obtained, comparable with the results of the standard two&#8208;step assay using horseradish peroxidase (HRP)&#8208;labeled antibodies. This assay has the advantage of significant timesaving for rapid detection of large amounts of samples. This work has discovered a highly efficient oxidase&#8208;mimicking nanozyme useful for various nano&#8208; and analytical applications.

         <title>Energetics of Competing Chiral Supramolecular Polymers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 37, Page 9627-9633, July 2, 2021. </description>

Accounting for defects: Subtle energetic differences (chiral mismatches and helix reversals) govern the stability of two competing helical structures and translate into a major change of the macroscopic properties of solutions of racemic versus enantiopure monomers.







Abstract
Chirality can have unexpected consequences including on properties other than spectroscopic. We show herein that a racemic mixture of bis&#8208;urea stereoisomers forms thermodynamically stable supramolecular polymers that result in a more viscous solution than for the pure stereoisomer. The origin of this macroscopic property was probed by characterizing the structure and stability of the assemblies. Both racemic and non&#8208;racemic bis&#8208;urea stereoisomers form two competing helical supramolecular polymers in solution: a double and a single helical structure at low and high temperature, respectively. The transition temperature between these assemblies, as probed by spectroscopic and calorimetric analyses, is strongly influenced by the composition (by up to 70&#8201;&#176;C). A simple model that accounts for the thermodynamics of this system, indicates that the stereochemical defects (chiral mismatches and helix reversals) affect much more the stability of single helices. Therefore, the heterochiral double helical structure predominates over the single helical structure (whilst the opposite holds for the homochiral structures), which explains the aforementioned higher viscosity of the racemic bis&#8208;urea solution. This rationale constitutes a new basis to tune the macroscopic properties of the increasing number of supramolecular polymers reported to exhibit competing chiral nanostructures.

     alt="Energetics of Competing Chiral Supramolecular Polymers"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Accounting for defects&lt;/b&gt;: Subtle energetic differences (chiral mismatches and helix reversals) govern the stability of two competing helical structures and translate into a major change of the macroscopic properties of solutions of racemic versus enantiopure monomers.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chirality can have unexpected consequences including on properties other than spectroscopic. We show herein that a racemic mixture of bis-urea stereoisomers forms thermodynamically stable supramolecular polymers that result in a more viscous solution than for the pure stereoisomer. The origin of this macroscopic property was probed by characterizing the structure and stability of the assemblies. Both racemic and non-racemic bis-urea stereoisomers form two competing helical supramolecular polymers in solution: a double and a single helical structure at low and high temperature, respectively. The transition temperature between these assemblies, as probed by spectroscopic and calorimetric analyses, is strongly influenced by the composition (by up to 70&#8201;&#176;C). A simple model that accounts for the thermodynamics of this system, indicates that the stereochemical defects (chiral mismatches and helix reversals) affect much more the stability of single helices. Therefore, the heterochiral double helical structure predominates over the single helical structure (whilst the opposite holds for the homochiral structures), which explains the aforementioned higher viscosity of the racemic bis-urea solution. This rationale constitutes a new basis to tune the macroscopic properties of the increasing number of supramolecular polymers reported to exhibit competing chiral nanostructures.&lt;/p&gt;

Finite subcellular structures and subtle bioactivities in the living cells are essential to understand biological processes. Super&#8208;resolution microscopy (SRM) is a powerful tool to visualize cellular structures and bioactivities at the nanometer scale. However, synthesizing elaborate probes with outstanding photostability, accurate positioning, reliable selectivity, high brightness is extremely intricate and challenging, especially for SRM bioimaging. In this newly developed probe, strong fluorescence was only realised in the existence of targeting protein at acidic lysosomal pH, ensuring reliable tracking of the dynamics of lysosomal structure and pH in living cells by STED.







Abstract
Super&#8208;resolution microscopy (SRM) imaging of the finite subcellular structures and subtle bioactivities inside organelles delivers abundant cellular information with high fidelity to unravel the intricate biological processes. An ideal fluorescent probe with precise control of fluorescence is critical in SRM technique like stimulated emission depletion (STED). Si&#8208;rhodamine was decorated with both targeting group and H+&#8208;receptor, affording the dually fluorogenic Si&#8208;rhodamine in which the NIR fluorescence was efficiently controlled by the coalescent of spirolactone&#8208;zwitterion equilibrium and PeT mechanism. The dually fluorogenic characters of the probe offer a perfect mutual enhancement in sensitivity, specificity and spatial resolution. Strong fluorescence only released in the existence of targeting protein at acidic lysosomal pH, ensured precisely tracking the dynamic of lysosomal structure and pH in living cells by STED.

Comprehensive studies on the MOF characteristics and optimal reaction condition and mechanism, show an unprecedented three&#8208;phase heterogeneous system has been established for catalytic oxidation of a wide scope of primary and secondary alcohols, and benzyl compounds.

Abstract
Two highly efficient metal&#8208;organic framework catalysts TJU&#8208;68&#8208;NHPI and TJU&#8208;68&#8208;NDHPI have been successfully synthesized through solvothermal reactions of which the frameworks are merged with N&#8208;hydroxyphthalimide (NHPI) units, resulting in the decoration of pore surfaces with highly active nitroxyl catalytic sites. When t&#8208;butyl nitrite (TBN) is used as co&#8208;catalyst, the as&#8208;synthesized MOFs are demonstrated to be highly efficient and recyclable catalysts for a novel three&#8208;phase heterogeneous oxidation of activated C&#8722;H bond of primary and secondary alcohols, and benzyl compounds under mild conditions. Based on the high efficiency and selectivity, an environmentally benign system with good sustainability, mild conditions, simple work&#8208;up procedure has been established for practical oxidation of a wide range of substrates.

Abstract
Novel molybdenum(VI/V) POM&#8208;based self&#8208;constructed frameworks [MoVI12O24(&#956;2&#8208;O)12(trz)6(H2O)6]&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;6Hma&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;18H2O (1, Htrz=1H&#8208;1,2,3&#8208;triazole, ma=methylamine), [MoVI7O14(&#956;2&#8208;O)8(trz)5(H2O)]&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;7Hma&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;5H2O (2), Na3[MoV6O6(&#956;2&#8208;O)9(Htrz)3(trz)3]&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;7.5H2O (3) and [MoV8O8(&#956;2&#8208;O)12(Htrz)8]&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;30H2O (4) have been covalently decorated with tri&#8208;coordinated deprotonated/protonated 1,2,3&#8208;triazoles. Channels with an inner diameter of 7.5&#8197;&#197; were found in 1, whereas a tunnel composed of stacking molecules with an inner diameter of 4.1&#8197;&#197; along the b&#8208;axis exists in 2; it is occupied by free disordered methylamines, showing selective adsorption of O2 and CO2 at 25&#8201;&#176;C. Obvious downfield shifts were observed by 13C NMR spectroscopies for methylamines inside the confined channels in 1 and 2. There are diversified pores in 3 and 4, which are formed by the molecules themselves and intermolecular accumulations. Adsorption tests indicate that 3 and 4 are fine adsorption materials for CH4 and CO2 under low pressure that rely on the environments built by the POMs. Correspondingly, 1 and 2 display reversible photoresponsive thermochromism that is subtlety influenced by the channels. The polyoxometalate organic frameworks (POMOFs) with multiple functional adsorptions are easy to assemble. Their photo&#8208;/thermoresponse properties offer a new pathway for the self&#8208;constructions of one&#8208;off hybrid materials that possess the good properties of both POMs and MOFs.

         <title>Organometallic Molecular Wires with Thioacetylene Backbones, trans&#8208;{RS&#8208;(C&#8801;C)n}2Ru(phosphine)4: High Conductance through Non&#8208;Aromatic Bridging Linkers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 37, Page 9666-9673, July 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The scanning tunneling microscope break&#8208;junction study of thioacetylene ruthenium molecular wires exhibited single&#8208;molecule conductance higher than that of the related organometallic wires indicating the superiority of the acetylene bridging linkers as well as the thioether coordination anchor groups. The DFT non&#8208;equilibrium Green's function study supports the high conductance of the thioacetylene molecular wires, for which HOMOs are the dominant conductance pathways.

In this work, the design, synthesis, and single&#8208;molecule conductance of ethynyl&#8208; and butadiynyl&#8208;ruthenium molecular wires with thioether anchor groups [RS=n&#8208;C6H13S, p&#8208;tert&#8208;Bu&#8722;C6H4S), trans&#8208;{RS&#8722;(C&#8801;C)n}2Ru(dppe)2 (n=1 (1R), 2 (2R); dppe: 1,2&#8208;bis(diphenylphosphino)ethane) and trans&#8208;(n&#8208;C6H13S&#8722;C&#8801;C)2Ru{P(OMe)3}4 3hex] are reported. Scanning tunneling microscope break&#8208;junction study has revealed conductance of the organometallic molecular wires with the thioacetylene backbones higher than that of the related organometallic wires having arylethynylruthenium linkages with the sulfur anchor groups, trans&#8208;{p&#8208;MeS&#8722;C6H4&#8208;(C&#8801;C)n}2Ru(phosphine)4 4n (n=1, 2) and trans&#8208;(Th&#8722;C&#8801;C)2Ru(phosphine)4 5 (Th=3&#8208;thienyl). It should be noted that the molecular junctions constructed from the butadiynyl wire 2R, trans&#8208;{Au&#8722;RS&#8722;(C&#8801;C)2}2Ru(dppe)2 (Au: gold metal electrode), show conductance comparable to that of the covalently linked polyynyl wire with the similar molecular length, trans&#8208;{Au&#8722;(C&#8801;C)3}2Ru(dppe)2 63. The DFT non&#8208;equilibrium Green's function (NEGF) study supports the highly conducting nature of the thioacetylene molecular wires through HOMO orbitals.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The scanning tunneling microscope&lt;/b&gt; break-junction study of thioacetylene ruthenium molecular wires exhibited single-molecule conductance higher than that of the related organometallic wires indicating the superiority of the acetylene bridging linkers as well as the thioether coordination anchor groups. The DFT non-equilibrium Green's function study supports the high conductance of the thioacetylene molecular wires, for which HOMOs are the dominant conductance pathways.

         <title>Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence Emitters Exhibiting Red to Near&#8208;Infrared Emission Derived from Intermolecular Charge&#8208;Transfer Triplet States of Naphthalenediimide&#8722;Halobenzoate Triad Molecules</title>

         <dc:description>
A simple naphthalenediimide derivative with efficient room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) properties, showing red to near&#8208;infrared emission in both solid and aqueous dispersion is demonstrated. The spin&#8208;orbit coupling values are evaluated using TD&#8208;DFT calculations and show that the intermolecular charge&#8208;transfer interaction and the positions of iodine as heavy atom are essential to realize efficient RTP.







Abstract
Room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) emitters have attracted significant attention. However, purely organic RTP emitters in red to near&#8208;infrared region have not been properly investigated. In this study, a series of naphthalenediimide&#8722;halobenzoate&#8208;linked molecules are synthesized, one of which exhibits efficient RTP properties, showing red to near&#8208;infrared emission in solid and aqueous dispersion. Spectroscopic studies and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis have shown that the difference in the stacking modes of compounds affects the optical properties, and the formation of intermolecular charge&#8208;transfer complexes of naphthalenediimide&#8722;halobenzoate moiety results in a bathochromic shift of absorption and RTP properties. The time&#8208;dependent density functional theory calculations showed that the formation of charge&#8208;transfer triplet states and the external heavy atom effect of the halogen atom enhance the intersystem crossing between excited singlet and triplet states.

         <title>Synthesis and Characterization of Bis&#8208;1,2,3&#8208;Triazole Ligand and its Corresponding Copper Complex for the Development of Electrochemical Affinity Biosensors</title>

A powerful alternative for biomolecule labelling, based on the electrochemical properties of a metallic complex, is presented. A bis&#8208;triazole ligand and its corresponding copper complex were synthesized and characterized. The coupling of the copper complex with an aptamer was realized and confirmed by mass spectroscopy analysis. The labelled aptamer was then immobilized on a screen&#8208;printed carbon electrode for the design of an estradiol aptasensor.







Abstract
The bis&#8208;triazole ligand and its corresponding copper complexes were synthesized and characterized for the first time and proposed as new labels for the development of electrochemical aptasensors. The bis&#8208;triazole ligand was prepared from methyl 1,6&#8208;heptadiyne&#8208;4&#8208;carboxylate and 2&#8208;(azidomethyl)phenol using classical CuAAC in presence of different copper salts. The X&#8208;ray structure of bis&#8208;triazole showed a symmetry center (C1). UV&#8208;Vis and X&#8208;band EPR spectra showed that the coordination capacity of the bis&#8208;triazole ligand was improved in the presence of triethylamine due to deprotonation of the triazole and phenolate moieties. After complexation with copper, the obtained complex was successfully attached to an anti&#8208;estradiol aptamer through thiol&#8208;maleimide coupling, and the resulting labelled aptamer was immobilized on a carbon screen&#8208;printed electrode by carbodiimide coupling. The electrochemical response of the resulting sensor was shown to decrease in the presence of estradiol, demonstrating that the developed complexes can be applied for the development of aptasensors.

         <title>Single Mn Atom Anchored on Nitrogen&#8208;Doped Graphene as a Highly Efficient Electrocatalyst for Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 37, Page 9686-9693, July 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Taking the indirect route: All the possible reaction pathways for oxygen reduction on single Mn atom anchored on nitrogen&#8208;doped graphene including intermediates, H+ adsorption sites, and transition states have been investigated by DFT calculations. Four&#8208;electron O2 hydrogenation pathways were found to be energetically more favorable than direct O2 dissociation pathways, with energy barriers as low as 0.13&#8197;eV.







Abstract
Single Mn atom on nitrogen&#8208;doped graphene (MnN4&#8208;G) has exhibited good structural stability and high activity for the adsorption and dissociation of an O2 molecule, becoming a promising single&#8208;atom catalyst (SAC) candidate for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). However, the catalytic activity of MnN4&#8208;G for the ORR and the optimal reaction pathway remain obscure. In this work, density&#8208;functional theory calculations were employed to comprehensively investigate all the possible pathways and intermediate reactions of the ORR on MnN4&#8208;G. The feasible active sites and the most stable adsorption configurations of the intermediates and transition states during the ORR were identified. Screened from all the possibilities, three optimal four&#8208;electron O2 hydrogenation pathways with an ultralow energy barrier of 0.13&#8197;eV were discovered that are energetically more favorable than direct O2 dissociation pathways. Analysis of the free energy diagram further verified the thermodynamical feasibility of the three pathways. Thus, MnN4&#8208;G possesses superior ORR activity. This study provides a fundamental understanding of the design of highly efficient SACs for the ORR.

         <title>Modulation of Src Kinase Activity by Selective Substrate Recognition with Pseudopeptidic Cages</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 37, Page 9542-9549, July 2, 2021. </description>

How to spare Tyr: The selective recognition of tyrosine residues by pseudopeptidic cages protects the substrates from Src kinase&#8208;promoted phosphorylation. The Tyr kinase&#8208;inhibiting activity of the cages can be satisfactorily explained by the formation of host&#8208;guest complexes. This supramolecular approach represents an appealing alternative to modulating Tyr kinase activity by substrate recognition.







Abstract
The selective recognition of tyrosine residues in peptides is an appealing approach to inhibiting their tyrosine kinase (TK)&#8208;mediated phosphorylation. Herein, we describe pseudopeptidic cages that efficiently protect substrates from the action of the Src TK enzyme, precluding the corresponding Tyr phosphorylation. Fluorescence emission titrations show that the most efficient cage inhibitors strongly bind the peptide substrates with a very good correlation between the binding constant and the inhibitory potency. Structural insights and additional control experiments further support the proposed mechanism of selective supramolecular protection of the substrates. Moreover, the approach also works in a completely different kinase&#8208;substrate system. These results illustrate the potential of supramolecular complexes for the efficient and selective modulation of TK signaling.

Cyclic alkyl(amino)carbene&#8208;stabilized (cyano)hydroboryl anions were synthesized by deprotonation of the corresponding (cyano)dihydroborane precursors. They display boron&#8208;centered nucleophilic reactivity towards organohalides but cyano&#8208;nitrogen&#8208;centered nucleophilic reactivity towards haloboranes, resulting in the formation of the first linear 2&#8208;aza&#8208;1,4&#8208;diborabutatrienes.







Abstract
Cyclic alkyl(amino)carbene&#8208;stabilized (cyano)hydroboryl anions were synthesized by deprotonation of (cyano)dihydroborane precursors. While they display boron&#8208;centered nucleophilic reactivity towards organohalides, generating fully unsymmetrically substituted cyano(hydro)organoboranes, they show cyano&#8208;nitrogen&#8208;centered nucleophilic reactivity towards haloboranes, resulting in the formation of hitherto unknown linear 2&#8208;aza&#8208;1,4&#8208;diborabutatrienes.

         <title>Shape&#8208;Adaptability and Redox&#8208;Switching Properties of a Di&#8208;Gold Metallotweezer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 37, Page 9661-9665, July 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A di&#8208;gold metallo&#8208;tweezer is used as receptor of a series of electron&#8208;deficient planar organic guests, including three organic molecules and two square&#8208;planar metal complexes. The host adapts its shape to maximize the attractive interaction with the guests. Redox&#8208;active guests are released upon one electron reduction, thus this tweezer constitutes an interesting example of redox&#8208;switchable binding.







Abstract
The use of a carbazolyl&#8208;connected di&#8208;gold(I) metallotweezer for the encapsulation of several electron&#8208;poor organic substrates, and a planar Au(III) complex containing a CNC pincer ligand, is described. The binding affinity of the receptor depends on the electron&#8208;deficient character of the planar guest, with larger association constants found for the more electron&#8208;poor guests. The X&#8208;ray diffraction molecular structures of two host:guest adducts show that the host approaches its arms in order to facilitate the optimum interaction with the surface of the planar guests, in a clear example of an guest&#8208;induced fit conformational arrangement. The electrochemical studies of the encapsulation of N,N&#8217;&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;naphthalenetetracarboxy diimide (NTCDI) show that the redox active guest is released from the receptor upon one electron reduction, thus constituting an example of redox&#8208;switchable binding.

         <title>First Total Synthesis of Phytoprostanes with Prostaglandin&#8208;Like Configuration, Evidence for Their Formation in Edible Vegetable Oils and Orienting Study of Their Biological Activity</title>

PhytoP against PhytoG: The first total synthesis of phytoglandins (PhytoG), phytoprostanes (PhytoP) with prostaglandin configuration was accomplished. They are indeed metabolites of &#945;&#8208;linolenic acid and form at sizeable levels during aging of edible vegetable oils as demonstrated in a UHPLC&#8208;MS/MS study.







Abstract
Phytoprostanes (PhytoP) are natural products, which form in plants under oxidative stress conditions from &#945;&#8208;linolenic acid. However, their epimers with relative prostaglandin configuration termed phytoglandins (PhytoG) have never been detected in Nature, likely because of the lack of synthetic reference material. Here, the first asymmetric total synthesis of such compounds, namely of PhytoGF1&#945; (9&#8208;epi&#8208;16&#8208;F1t&#8208;PhytoP) and its diastereomer ent&#8208;16&#8208;epi&#8208;PhytoGF1&#945; (ent&#8208;9,16&#8208;diepi&#8208;16&#8208;F1t&#8208;PhytoP), has been accomplished. The synthetic strategy is based on radical anion oxidative cyclization, copper(I)&#8208;mediated alkyl&#8208;alkyl coupling and enantioselective reduction reactions. A UHPLC&#8208;MS/MS study using the synthesized compounds as standards indicates PhytoG formation at significant levels during autoxidation of &#945;&#8208;linolenic acid in edible vegetable oils. Initial testing of synthetic PhytoGs together with F1&#8208;PhytoP and 15&#8208;F2t&#8208;IsoP derivatives for potential interactions with the PGF2&#945; (FP) receptor did not reveal significant activity. The notion that PUFA&#8208;derived oxidatively formed cyclic metabolites with prostaglandin configuration do not form to a significant extent in biological or food matrices has to be corrected. Strong evidence is provided that oxidatively formed PhytoG metabolites may be ingested with plant&#8208;derived food, which necessitates further investigation of their biological profile.

         <title>Theoretical Simulations of Thermochromic and Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission Behaviors of a Series of Red&#8208;Light Anthracene&#8208;o&#8208;carborane Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 37, Page 9571-9579, July 2, 2021. </description>

When the heat is on: A series of anthracene&#8208;o&#8208;carborane derivatives with red&#8208;light aggregation&#8208;induced emission has been studied theoretically. The changes in bond length and dihedral angle result from alteration of the crystal stacking structure after heating, and the thermochromic behavior in crystal is ascribed to the elongation of bond length.







Abstract
Quantum mechanical and molecular dynamics simulations have been carried out on a series of anthracene&#8208;o&#8208;carborane derivatives (ANT&#8208;H, ANT&#8208;Ph, ANT&#8208;Me and ANT&#8208;TMS) with rare red&#8208;light emission in the solid state. The simulation of the heating process of the crystals and further comparison of the molecular structures and excited&#8208;state properties before and after heating help us to disclose the thermochromic behavior, that is, the red&#8208;shift emission is caused by elongation of the C1&#8722;C2 bond in the carborane moiety after heating. Thus, we believe that the molecular structure in the crystal is severely affected by heating. Transformation of the molecular conformation appears in the ANT&#8208;H crystal with increasing temperature. More specifically, the anthracene moiety moves from nearly parallel to the C1&#8722;C2 bond to nearly perpendicular, causing the short&#8208;wavelength emission to disappear after heating. As for the aggregation&#8208;induced emission phenomenon, the structures and photophysical properties were investigated comparatively in both the isolated and crystal states; the results suggested that the energy dissipation in crystal surroundings was greatly reduced through hindering structure relaxation from the excited to the ground state. We expect that discussion of the thermochromic behavior will provide a new analysis perspective for the molecular design of o&#8208;carborane derivatives.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;When the heat is on&lt;/b&gt;: A series of anthracene-&lt;i&gt;o&lt;/i&gt;-carborane derivatives with red-light aggregation-induced emission has been studied theoretically. The changes in bond length and dihedral angle result from alteration of the crystal stacking structure after heating, and the thermochromic behavior in crystal is ascribed to the elongation of bond length.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quantum mechanical and molecular dynamics simulations have been carried out on a series of anthracene-&lt;i&gt;o&lt;/i&gt;-carborane derivatives (ANT-H, ANT-Ph, ANT-Me and ANT-TMS) with rare red-light emission in the solid state. The simulation of the heating process of the crystals and further comparison of the molecular structures and excited-state properties before and after heating help us to disclose the thermochromic behavior, that is, the red-shift emission is caused by elongation of the C1&#8722;C2 bond in the carborane moiety after heating. Thus, we believe that the molecular structure in the crystal is severely affected by heating. Transformation of the molecular conformation appears in the ANT-H crystal with increasing temperature. More specifically, the anthracene moiety moves from nearly parallel to the C1&#8722;C2 bond to nearly perpendicular, causing the short-wavelength emission to disappear after heating. As for the aggregation-induced emission phenomenon, the structures and photophysical properties were investigated comparatively in both the isolated and crystal states; the results suggested that the energy dissipation in crystal surroundings was greatly reduced through hindering structure relaxation from the excited to the ground state. We expect that discussion of the thermochromic behavior will provide a new analysis perspective for the molecular design of &lt;i&gt;o&lt;/i&gt;-carborane derivatives.&lt;/p&gt;

CASTing call: A semi&#8208;rational combinatorial active&#8208;site saturation test (CAST) was performed to improve the C&#946; stereoselectivity of threonine aldolase. MD simulations suggested that the Y314R variant could interact with 4&#8208;methylsulfonyl benzaldehyde through hydrogen bonding to control the direction of entry of substrate, this increased the de value from 58 to 81&#8201;%.







Abstract
l&#8208;Threonine aldolase from Actinocorallia herbida (AhLTA) is an ideal catalyst for producing l&#8208;threo&#8208;4&#8208;methylsulfonylphenylserine [(2S,3R)&#8208;1&#8201;b], a key chiral precursor for florfenicol and thiamphenicol. The moderate C&#946; stereoselectivity is the main obstacle to the industrial application of AhLTA. To address this issue, a combinatorial active&#8208;site saturation test (CAST) together with sequence conservatism analysis was applied to engineer the AhLTA toward improved C&#946; stereoselectivity. The optical mutant Y314R could asymmetrically synthesize l&#8208;threo&#8208;4&#8208;methylsulfonylphenylserine with 81&#8201;% diastereomeric excess (de), which is 23&#8201;% higher than wild&#8208;type AhLTA. Molecular dynamic (MD) simulations revealed that the mechanism for the improvement in C&#946; stereoselectivity of Y314R is due to the acylamino group of residues Arg314 controlling the orientation of substrate 4&#8208;methylsulfonyl benzaldehyde (1&#8201;a) in the active pocket by directed interaction with the methylsulfonyl group; this leads to asymmetric synthesis of l&#8208;threo&#8208;4&#8208;methylsulfonylphenylserine. The success in this study demonstrates that direct control of substrates in an active pocket is an attract strategy to address the C&#946; stereoselectivity problem of LTA and contribute to the industrial application of LTA.

Breathe! Combining synchrotron in&#8197;situ PXRD with gas adsorption has shed light on the mechanism of guest&#8208;induced breathing in dynamic DUT&#8208;13 framework. In the contracted&#8208;pore phase, the crystal has pores half the volume of those in the open&#8208;pore phase; this is consistent with the adsorption isotherms. Methane physisorption isotherms at different temperatures indicate the softness of the framework.







Abstract
The switching mechanism of the flexible framework Zn4O(benztb)1.5 (benztb=N,N,N&#8217;,N&#8217;&#8208;benzidine tetrabenzoate), also known as DUT&#8208;13, was studied by advanced powder X&#8208;ray diffraction (PXRD) and gas physisorption techniques. In&#8197;situ synchrotron PXRD experiments upon physisorption of nitrogen (77&#8197;K) and n&#8208;butane (273&#8197;K) shed light on the hitherto unnoticed guest&#8208;induced breathing in the MOF. The mechanism of contraction is based on the conformationally labile benztb ligand and accompanied by a reduction in specific pore volume from 2.03&#8197;cm3&#8201;g&#8722;1 in the open&#8208;pore phase to 0.91&#8197;cm3&#8201;g&#8722;1 in the contracted&#8208;pore phase. The high temperature limit for adsorption&#8208;induced contraction of 170&#8197;K, determined by systematic temperature variation of methane adsorption isotherms, indicates that the DUT&#8208;13 framework is softer than other mesoporous MOFs like DUT&#8208;49 and does not support the formation of overloaded metastable states required for negative gas&#8208;adsorption transitions.

A simple and efficient radical tetrafluoroethylation was developed that generates &#945;&#8208;tetrafluoroethylated ketones from aryl alkynes and 1,1,2,2&#8208;tetrafluoroethane sulfonic acid (TFESA) with AIBN (azobis(isobutyronitrile)). The reaction proceeds chemoselectively at the terminal aryl alkynes under preservation of internal aryl alkyne moieties. A mechanistic exploration using TEMPO, a crossover experiment, and DFT calculations support the notion that this transformation involves radical processes, and proceeds through an intermolecular pathway.

         <title>Photoresponsive Binding Dynamics in High&#8208;Affinity Cucurbit[8]uril&#8208;Dithienylethene Host&#8208;Guest Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 37, Page 9550-9555, July 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Kinetic studies on host&#8208;guest systems based on cucurbit[8]uril and dithienylethene (DTE) photoswitches shows that the more tightly bound closed DTE isomers are kinetically more stable that their open counterparts. This allows for the modulation of their binding dynamics with light stimulus constituting an attractive tool for the development of out&#8208;of&#8208;equilibrium supramolecular systems.







Abstract
The use of external stimuli to control the binding kinetics in supramolecular systems is of critical importance for the development of advanced molecular machines and devices. In this work, a study focused on the kinetics of a water&#8208;soluble host&#8208;guest system based on cucurbit[8]uril and two dithienylethene (DTE) photoswitches is reported. It is shown that for the DTE guest comprising two anionic sulfonate side arms appended to pyridinium moieties, the formation/dissociation of the pseudorotaxane structures is slowed down by more than 100000&#8208;fold with respect to its bipyridinium analogue. The decrease in ingression rate leads to the emergence of a competitive metastable product with the open DTE isomer that has an important influence in the overall binding kinetics. Moreover, the host&#8208;guest dissociation kinetics is demonstrated to be approximately 100&#8208;fold slower for the closed DTE isomer (t1/2=107&#8197;h vs. t1/2=1.2&#8197;h for the open isomer) allowing control over the dissociation rate with light.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Kinetic studies&lt;/b&gt; on host-guest systems based on cucurbit[8]uril and dithienylethene (DTE) photoswitches shows that the more tightly bound closed DTE isomers are kinetically more stable that their open counterparts. This allows for the modulation of their binding dynamics with light stimulus constituting an attractive tool for the development of out-of-equilibrium supramolecular systems.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The use of external stimuli to control the binding kinetics in supramolecular systems is of critical importance for the development of advanced molecular machines and devices. In this work, a study focused on the kinetics of a water-soluble host-guest system based on cucurbit[8]uril and two dithienylethene (DTE) photoswitches is reported. It is shown that for the DTE guest comprising two anionic sulfonate side arms appended to pyridinium moieties, the formation/dissociation of the pseudorotaxane structures is slowed down by more than 100000-fold with respect to its bipyridinium analogue. The decrease in ingression rate leads to the emergence of a competitive metastable product with the open DTE isomer that has an important influence in the overall binding kinetics. Moreover, the host-guest dissociation kinetics is demonstrated to be approximately 100-fold slower for the closed DTE isomer (t&lt;sub&gt;1/2&lt;/sub&gt;=107&#8197;h vs. t&lt;sub&gt;1/2&lt;/sub&gt;=1.2&#8197;h for the open isomer) allowing control over the dissociation rate with light.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Dual Electroactivity in a Covalent Organic Network with Mechanically Interlocked Pillar[5]arenes</title>

         <dc:description>
Redox active pillar[5]arene macrocycles are inserted via mechanical bonds in a viologen&#8208;based covalent organic network. Solid state electrochemical studies show that both n and p type redox centers are active on a relatively narrow potential range (&#8764;1&#8197;V). The presence of the pillar[5]arene macrocycles boosts the electroactivity of the solid in aqueous electrolyte.







Abstract
The synthesis and characterization of a polyrotaxanated covalent organic network (CON) based on the association between the viologen and pillar[5]arene (P[5]OH) units are reported. The mechanical bond allows for the irreversible insertion of n&#8208;type redox centers (P[5]OH macrocycles) within a pristine structure based on p&#8208;type viologen redox centers. Both redox units are active on a narrow potential range and, in water, the presence of P[5]OH greatly increases the electroactivity of the material.

         <dc:description>
Carbon quantum dots (CQDs) are photostable, highly photoluminescent nanomaterials (size&#8804;10&#8197;nm; high &#934;s) throughout the blue&#8208;to&#8208;red spectral region; their photophysical properties can be tuned by manipulating their sizes and shapes, by doping and by surface passivation. The unequivocal biocompatibility and low&#8208;toxicity of CQDs have made them useful in bioimaging, drug delivery, and in chemical sensing. They can be synthesized from low&#8208;cost carbon precursors (fruits, vegetables, biomass, chemicals) using top&#8208;down (arc discharge, laser ablation, acidic oxidation) and bottom&#8208;up (thermal carbonization, microwave pyrolysis, ultrasonication, solvothermally, electrochemically) approaches. For more information, see the Review by N. Serpone and co&#8208;workers on page 9466&#8197;ff.

         <dc:description>
Transition metal complexes have recently gained momentum as electron spin&#8208;based quantum bit (qubit) candidates due to their synthetic tunability and long achievable coherence times. The decoherence of magnetic quantum states imposes a limit on the use of these qubits for quantum information technologies, such as quantum computing, sensing, and communication. With rapid recent development in the field of molecular quantum information science, a variety of chemical design principles for prolonging coherence in molecular transition metal qubits have been proposed. To find out more, see the Minireview by R. G. Hadt et&#8197;al. on page 9482.

         <title>Cover Feature: Modulation of Src Kinase Activity by Selective Substrate Recognition with Pseudopeptidic Cages (Chem. Eur. J. 37/2021)</title>

The modulation of the activity of tyrosine kinases (TK) is an appealing topic of current research. This work presents new pseudopeptidic cages that protect the substrates from the action of the TK enzyme, precluding the corresponding Tyr phosphorylation, with a very good correlation between the Tyr caging and the kinase inhibition. The results illustrate how TK signaling can be efficiently and selectively modulated with supramolecular complexes. More information can be found in the Full Paper by W.&#8197;T. Miller, I. Alfonso, et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202100990).

         <title>Cover Feature: Photoresponsive Binding Dynamics in High&#8208;Affinity Cucurbit[8]uril&#8208;Dithienylethene Host&#8208;Guest Complexes (Chem. Eur. J. 37/2021)</title>

Photoresponsive binding kinetics was achieved in cucurbit[8]uril&#8208;dithienylethene host&#8208;guest complexes. This work demonstrates that, in the presence of a competitor guest (in purple), the host&#8208;guest dissociation kinetics is approximately 100&#8208;fold slower for the closed (green) than for the open (yellow) dithienylethene isomers (t 1/2=107 hours vs. t 1/2=1.2 hours), allowing control over the dissociation rate with red/NIR light. More information can be found in the Full Paper by A. Jorge&#8197;Parola, N. Bas&#237;lio, et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202100974).

Phytoglandins from the reaction flask enable their identification in Nature. Hypothetical plant&#8208;based prostaglandin analogs were obtained by a 15&#8208;step asymmetric total synthesis. They were applied as an analytical standard in a detailed LC&#8208;MS/MS study confirming phytoglandin formation in autoxidized linolenic acid and in various edible vegetable oils in sizeable quantities. More information can be found in the Full Paper by U. Jahn et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202100872).

Purely organic materials exhibiting room temperature phosphorescence in the red to near&#8208;infrared region were obtained by using simple naphthalene diimide (NDI) derivatives. This cover picture depicts the molecular assembly of the NDI&#8208;iodobenzoate complex determined by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray structure analysis, indicating that the formation of intermolecular charge&#8208;transfer interactions and external heavy atom effects play an important role in the red to near&#8208;infrared luminescence.

         <title>Deconvolving Contributions to Decoherence in Molecular Electron Spin Qubits: A Dynamic Ligand Field Approach</title>

Controlling quantum decoherence in paramagnetic transition metal complexes enables the realization of next&#8208;generation quantum technologies from computing to sensing. Phenomena contributing to electron spin decoherence are deconstructed into three groups: the spin&#8208;spin, motional and spin&#8208;phonon regimes. Corresponding molecular design principles are described for each regime, with particular emphasis on the use of dynamic ligand field theory to analyze intramolecular vibrational contributions to decoherence.







Abstract
In the past decade, transition metal complexes have gained momentum as electron spin&#8208;based quantum bit (qubit) candidates due to their synthetic tunability and long achievable coherence times. The decoherence of magnetic quantum states imposes a limit on the use of these qubits for quantum information technologies, such as quantum computing, sensing, and communication. With rapid recent development in the field of molecular quantum information science, a variety of chemical design principles for prolonging coherence in molecular transition metal qubits have been proposed. Here the spin&#8208;spin, motional, and spin&#8208;phonon regimes of decoherence are delineated, outlining design principles for each. It is shown how dynamic ligand field models can provide insights into the intramolecular vibrational contributions in the spin&#8208;phonon decoherence regime. This minireview aims to inform the development of molecular quantum technologies tailored for different environments and conditions.

         <title>Photoluminescent Carbon Quantum Dots: Synthetic Approaches and Photophysical Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 37, Page 9466-9481, July 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Carbon quantum dots (CQDs) synthesized in four different solvents or mixed solvents with 1,3,6&#8208;trinitropyrene as the carbon precursor: blue&#8208;emitting (DMF/H2O), green&#8208;emitting (EtOH/CH3CO2H), yellow&#8208;emitting (EtOH), and red&#8208;emitting (DMF). Photograph shows the photoluminescent CQDs dispersed in toluene under UV light, and normalized emission spectra with bands at 460, 517, 581, and 620&#8197;nm, respectively.







Abstract
A number of synthetic methodologies and applications of carbon quantum dots (CQDs) have been reported since they were first discovered nearly two decades ago. Unlike metal&#8208;based or semiconductor&#8208;based (e.&#8201;g., metal chalcogenides) quantum dots (MSQDs), CQDs have the unique feature of being prepared through a variety of synthetic protocols, which are typically understood from considerations of reaction models and photoluminescence mechanisms. Consequently, this brief review article describes quantum dots, in general, and CQDs, in particular, from various viewpoints: (i) their definition, (ii) their photophysical properties, and (iii) the superiority of CQDs over MSQDs. Where possible, comparisons are made between CQDs and MSQDs. First, however, the review begins with a general brief description of quantum dots (QDs) as nanomaterials (sizes&#8804;10&#8197;nm), followed by a short description of MSQDs and CQDs. Described subsequently are the various top&#8208;down and bottom&#8208;up approaches to synthesize CQDs followed by their distinctive photophysical properties (emission spectra; quantum yields, &#934;s).

         <title>Coordination&#8208;Induced N&#8722;H Bond Splitting of Ammonia and Primary Amine of CuI&#8722;MOFs</title>

We report a porous three&#8208;dimensional anionic tetrazolium based CuI&#8722;MOF, which is capable of cleaving the N&#8722;H bond of ammonia and primary amine, as well as the O&#8722;H bond of H2O along with spontaneous H2 evolution through single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal (SCSC) structural transformations. The CuI&#8722;MOF material could be reused through simple reduction with ascorbic acid. The results showed that the CuI&#8722;MOF based on polytetrazolium ligand could be applied to activate ammonia and amine vapor in gas&#8208;solid phase.







Abstract
We report a porous three&#8208;dimensional anionic tetrazolium based CuI&#8722;MOF 1, which is capable of cleaving the N&#8722;H bond of ammonia and primary amine, as well as the O&#8722;H bond of H2O along with spontaneous H2 evolution. In the gas&#8208;solid phase reaction of 1 with ammonia and water vapor, CuI&#8722;MOF 1 was gradually oxidized to NH2&#8722;CuII&#8722;MOF and OH&#8722;CuII&#8722;MOF, through single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal (SCSC) structural transformations, which was confirmed by XPS, PXRD and X&#8208;ray single&#8208;crystal diffraction. Density functional theory (DFT) demonstrated that CuI&#8722;MOF could lower N&#8722;H bond dissociation free energy of ammonia through coordination&#8208;induced bond weakening and promote H2 evolution by the reduction potential of 1. To our knowledge, this is the first example of MOFs that activate ammonia and amine in gas&#8208;solid manner.

         <title>Development of Non&#8208;Hydrolysable Oligosaccharide Activity&#8208;Based Inactivators for Endoglycanases: A Case Study on &#945;&#8208;1,6 Mannanases</title>

Carba&#8208;trisaccharide cyclophellitols are potent GH76 &#945;&#8208;1,6 endo&#8208;mannanase inactivators and resistant to endoglycosidic bond cleavage.







Abstract
There is a vast genomic resource for enzymes active on carbohydrates. Lagging far behind, however, are functional chemical tools for the rapid characterization of carbohydrate&#8208;active enzymes. Activity&#8208;based probes (ABPs) offer one chemical solution to these issues with ABPs based upon cyclophellitol epoxide and aziridine covalent and irreversible inhibitors representing a potent and widespread approach. Such inhibitors for enzymes active on polysaccharides are potentially limited by the requirement for several glycosidic bonds, themselves substrates for the enzyme targets. Here, it is shown that non&#8208;hydrolysable trisaccharide can be synthesized and applied even to enzymes with challenging subsite requirements. It was found that incorporation of carbasugar moieties, which was accomplished by cuprate&#8208;assisted regioselective trans&#8208;diaxial epoxide opening of carba&#8208;mannal synthesised for this purpose, yields inactivators that act as powerful activity&#8208;based inhibitors for &#945;&#8208;1,6 endo&#8208;mannanases. 3&#8208;D structures at 1.35&#8211;1.47&#8197;&#197; resolutions confirm the design rationale and binding to the enzymatic nucleophile. Carbasugar oligosaccharide cyclophellitols offer a powerful new approach for the design of robust endoglycosidase inhibitors, while the synthesis procedures presented here should allow adaptation towards activity&#8208;based endoglycosidase probes as well as configurational isosteres targeting other endoglycosidase families.

         <title>From BN&#8208;Naphthalenes to Benzoborole Dianions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 37, Page 9514-9518, July 2, 2021. </description>

Benzoborole dianions have been selectively prepared in one step by lithium reduction of easily available BN&#8208;naphthalene derivatives. With this ring&#8208;contraction strategy, several new types of amino and phenyl&#8208;substituted benzoborole dianions could be obtained in excellent yields. Treatment of these dianions with methyl iodide resulted in the formation of the corresponding borates, which were luminescent both in solution and in the solid state.







Abstract
The synthesis of benzoborole dianions by alkali metal reduction of BN&#8208;naphthalene derivatives via a ring&#8208;contraction strategy has been developed. Reduction of 1&#8208;alkynyl 2,1&#8208;benzazaborine 1&#8201;a in Et2O led to the elimination of alkynyllithium with the formation of 1&#8208;amino&#8208;1&#8208;benzoborole trilithium salt 2&#8201;a, whereas reduction of 1&#8208;phenyl 2,1&#8208;benzazaborine 1&#8201;c in THF yielded 1&#8208;phenyl&#8208;1&#8208;benzoborole dilithium salt 2&#8201;c with the elimination of ArNHLi. The trilithium and dilithium salts 2&#8201;a and 2&#8201;c have been fully characterized. Treatment of trilithium salt 2&#8201;a with Et3NHCl led to the selective protonation of the amino lithium to afford the dilithium salt 2&#8201;aH, which could be cleanly oxidized to 1&#8208;amino&#8208;1&#8208;benzoborole 3 in an excellent yield. Reaction of 1&#8208;phenyl&#8208;1&#8208;benzoborole dilithium salt 2&#8201;c with MeI yielded the lithium borate 4&#8201;c, which is luminescent both in solution and in the solid state.

Boron&#8208;nitrogen analogs of metallacyclopentadienes in the form of 1&#8208;rhoda&#8208;3,2&#8208;azaboroles (see Figure) are shown to be suitable precursors for the synthesis of 1,2&#8208;azaborinines. Comparisons with 1,2&#8208;azaborete rhodium complexes demonstrate their superior reactivity towards alkynes, allowing to expand the range of 1,2&#8208;azaborinines. A series of multiply substituted 1,2&#8208;azaborinines, including a phenylene&#8208;bridged derivative and rare bicyclic derivatives composed of two 1,2&#8208;azaborinine rings linked by a single bond, are reported.







Abstract
A series of highly substituted 1,2&#8208;azaborinines, including a phenylene&#8208;bridged bis&#8208;1,2&#8208;azaborinine, was synthesized from the reaction of 1,2&#8208;azaborete rhodium complexes with variously substituted alkynes. 1&#8208;Rhoda&#8208;3,2&#8208;azaborole complexes, which are accessible by phosphine addition to the corresponding 1,2&#8208;azaborete complexes, were also found to be suitable precursors for the synthesis of 1,2&#8208;azaborinines and readily reacted with alkynyl&#8208;substituted 1,2&#8208;azaborinines to generate new regioisomers of bi&#8208;1,2&#8208;azaborinines, which feature directly connected aromatic rings. Their molecular structures, which can be viewed as boron&#8208;nitrogen isosteres of biphenyls, show nearly perpendicular 1,2&#8208;azaborinine rings. The new method using rhodacycles instead of 1,2&#8208;azaborete complexes as precursors is shown to be more effective, allowing the synthesis of a wider range of 1,2&#8208;azaborinines.

         <title>Coordination&#8208;Driven Selective Formation of D2 Symmetric Octanuclear Organometallic Cages</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 37, Page 9524-9528, July 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electronic effect arising from the different bidentate chelating sites on hydroxamate ligands allows selective coordination modes for the half&#8208;sandwich Ir/Rh metal centers. Despite the potential for obtaining a random statistical mixture of diastereoisomers as a consequence of differences in connectivity, only D2 symmetric octanuclear cages were formed selectively by using asymmetric pyridyl&#8208;carboxylate bridging ligands.







Abstract
The coordination&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly of organometallic half&#8208;sandwich iridium(III)&#8208; and rhodium(III)&#8208;based building blocks with asymmetric ambidentate pyridyl&#8208;carboxylate ligands is described. Despite the potential for obtaining a statistical mixture of multiple products, D2 symmetric octanuclear cages were formed selectively by taking advantage of the electronic effects emanating from the two types of chelating sites &#8211; (O,O&#8217;) and (N,N&#8217;) &#8211; on the tetranuclear building blocks. The metal sources and the lengths of bridging ligands influence the selectivity of the self&#8208;assembly. Experimental observations, supported by computational studies, suggest that the D2 symmetric cages are the thermodynamically favored products. Overall, the results underline the importance of electronic effects on the selectivity of coordination&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly, and demonstrate that asymmetric ambidentate ligands can be used to control the design of discrete supramolecular coordination complexes.

         <title>Quantification and Prediction of Imine Formation Kinetics in Aqueous Solution by Microfluidic NMR Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 37, Page 9508-9513, July 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The imine formation in aqueous solution that was finished within several minutes by microfluidic NMR spectroscopy was investigated. The forward rate constants k+ were quantified by an empirical equation containing three independent parameters: reactivity parameters of aldehydes (SE, E) and amines (N). These results allow the prediction of the unknown forward rate constant k+ and rational design of two reaction networks exhibiting kinetic selectivity.







Abstract
Quantitatively predicting the reactivity of dynamic covalent reaction is essential to understand and rationally design complex structures and reaction networks. Herein, the reactivity of aldehydes and amines in various rapid imine formation in aqueous solution by microfluidic NMR spectroscopy was quantified. Investigation of reaction kinetics allowed to quantify the forward rate constants k+ by an empirical equation, of which three independent parameters were introduced as reactivity parameters of aldehydes (SE, E) and amines (N). Furthermore, these reactivity parameters were successfully used to predict the unknown forward rate constants of imine formation. Finally, two competitive reaction networks were rationally designed based on the proposed reactivity parameters. Our work has demonstrated the capability of microfluidic NMR spectroscopy in quantifying the kinetics of label&#8208;free chemical reactions, especially rapid reactions that are complete in minutes.

         <title>An In&#8208;Situ Self&#8208;regeneration Catalyst for the Production of Renewable Penta&#8208;1,3&#8208;diene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 37, Page 9495-9498, July 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
An alternative approach to the efficient production of penta&#8208;1,3&#8208;diene: Bio&#8208;based hydrogenation of pentane&#8208;2,3&#8208;dione by a Pt/Ce/Al2O3 catalyst under mild conditions with a selectivity of 97&#8201;%, followed by dehydration by an urchin&#8208;like LaPO4 catalyst afforded penta&#8208;1,3&#8208;diene in yield of 59&#8201;%. The LaPO4 self&#8208;regenerated during the dehydration owing to its ability to restore the active sites in&#8197;situ.







Abstract
Catalyst deactivation is a problem of great concern for many heterogeneous reactions. Here, an urchin&#8208;like LaPO4 catalyst was easily developed for pentane&#8208;2,3&#8208;diol dehydration; it has an impressive ability to restore the activity in&#8197;situ by itself during the reaction, accounting for its high stability. This facilitates the efficient production of renewable penta&#8208;1,3&#8208;diene from pentane&#8208;2,3&#8208;dione via a novel approach, where penta&#8208;2,3&#8208;diol was obtained as an intermediate in 95&#8201;% yield under mild conditions.

         <title>A photo&#8208; and redox&#8208;driven two&#8208;directional terthiazole&#8208;based switch: a combined experimental and computational investigation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Terthiazoles with redox&#8208;active substituents like N&#8208;methyl pyridinium group and ferrocene have been synthesized and their photo&#8208; and electro&#8208;chromic behaviors investigated. The presence of two lateral N&#8208;methyl pyridinium substituents in the structure of terthiazole proved to be effective in inducing not only the reductive ring&#8208;closure of the terthiazole core but also its oxidative ring&#8208;opening reaction, leading to the first terarylene&#8208;based switch able to fully operate both photochemically and electrochemically. Moreover, the large increase in the redox potential between its open and closed form (700 mV) means that a part of the photon energy necessary to trigger the cyclization is stored in the form of chemical potential available for other works. Introduction of a second redox&#8208;active unit such as ferrocene onto the central thiazolyl moiety is found to inhibit the photochromism of the switch but not its redox switchability which, instead, got improved for the ring&#8208;opening reaction via the redox properties of the ferrocenyl unit.

The presence of two lateral N-methyl pyridinium substituents in the structure of terthiazole proved to be effective in inducing not only the reductive ring-closure of the terthiazole core but also its oxidative ring-opening reaction, leading to the first terarylene-based switch able to fully operate both photochemically and electrochemically. Moreover, the large increase in the redox potential between its open and closed form (700 mV) means that a part of the photon energy necessary to trigger the cyclization is stored in the form of chemical potential available for other works. Introduction of a second redox-active unit such as ferrocene onto the central thiazolyl moiety is found to inhibit the photochromism of the switch but not its redox switchability which, instead, got improved for the ring-opening reaction via the redox properties of the ferrocenyl unit. The optical and redox properties of the switch in its different oxidation states are analyzed with the aid of DFT calculations in order to rationalize different switching processes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Iminosugar C&#8208;Glycosides Work as Pharmacological Chaperones of NAGLU, a Glycosidase Involved in MPS IIIB Rare Disease**
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Capitalizing on the X&#8208;ray structure of two NAGLU&#8208;homoiminosugar complexes, the synthesis and evaluation as glycosidase inhibitors of a library of rationally designed iminosugar C&#8208;glycosides led to the discovery of several selective NAGLU inhibitors and allowed the identification of a pharmacological chaperone candidate to treat mucopolysaccharidosis type IIIB, a rare and devastating disease.







Abstract
Mucopolysaccharidosis type IIIB is a devastating neurological disease caused by a lack of the lysosomal enzyme, &#945;&#8208;N&#8208;acetylglucosaminidase (NAGLU), leading to a toxic accumulation of heparan sulfate. Herein we explored a pharmacological chaperone approach to enhance the residual activity of NAGLU in patient fibroblasts. Capitalizing on the three&#8208;dimensional structures of two modest homoiminosugar&#8208;based NAGLU inhibitors in complex with bacterial homolog of NAGLU, CpGH89, we have synthesized a library of 17 iminosugar C&#8208;glycosides mimicking N&#8208;acetyl&#8208;D&#8208;glucosamine and bearing various pseudo&#8208;anomeric substituents of both &#945;&#8208; and &#946;&#8208;configuration. Elaboration of the aglycon moiety results in low micromolar selective inhibitors of human recombinant NAGLU, but surprisingly it is the non&#8208;functionalized and wrongly configured &#946;&#8208;homoiminosugar that was proved to act as the most promising pharmacological chaperone, promoting a 2.4 fold activity enhancement of mutant NAGLU at its optimal concentration.

         <title>Rb[Li5Si2O7] &#8211; A Latecomer in the Family of Alkali Lithosilicates Hiding a Green&#8208;Emitting Lithosilicate</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
After the rediscovery of alkali lithosilicates as phosphor materials, a new representative has been found. The novel compound with the sum formula Rb[Li5Si2O7] crystallizes in the orthorhombic space group Pbcm (no. 57), exhibiting a new structure type. Eu2+&#8208;doped Rb[Li5Si2O7] feigns an intense green luminescence, in reality co&#8208;crystallizing as a matrix around a tiny core of the known narrow&#8208;band green phosphor RbLi[Li3SiO4]2:Eu2+.







Abstract
In order to expand the field of alkali lithosilicates, a new representative of the substance class with a previously unknown structure type was found based on solid&#8208;state synthesis. The novel compound with the sum formula Rb[Li5Si2O7] crystallizes in the orthorhombic space group Pbcm (no. 57) with a=7.6269(3), b=9.5415(4), and c=9.4095(3)&#8197;&#197; by means of single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. The structure consists of a highly condensed lithosilicate framework, built up of corner&#8208; and edge&#8208;linked [LiO4]&#8208;tetrahedra and [Si2O7]&#8208;units, and the rubidium ions aligned in channels. Suitable crystals of the material were obtained using sealed tantalum ampoules as reaction tube at a temperature of 750&#8201;&#176;C. The new compound was further characterized via powder diffraction, Rietveld analysis, and EDX measurements. At first glance, Eu2+&#8208;doped Rb[Li5Si2O7] reveals an intense green luminescence. In&#8208;depth crystal analysis shows that a core&#8208;shell formation is present even for apparently high quality single&#8208;crystals. As a minority phase, the known green phosphor RbLi[Li3SiO4]2:Eu2+ is the origin of the luminescence, representing a tiny core inside of the particles surrounded by a large matrix of transparent Rb[Li5Si2O7] dominating the single&#8208;crystal diffraction pattern.

         <title>Midkine Interaction with Chondroitin Sulfate&#160;Model Synthetic Tetrasaccharides and Their Mimetics: The Role of Aromatic Interactions.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Midkine (MK) is a neurotrophic factor that participates in the embryonic central nervous system (CNS) development and neural stem cell regulation, interacting with sulphated glycosaminoglycans (GAGs). Chondroitin sulphate (CS) is the natural ligand in the CNS. In this work, we describe the interactions between a library of synthetic models of CS&#8208;types and mimics. We did a structural study of this library by NMR and MD (Molecular Dynamics), concluding that the basic shape is controlled by similar geometry of the glycosidic linkages. Their 3D structures are a helix with four residues per turn, almost linear. We have studied the tetrasaccharide&#8208;midkine complexes by ligand observed NMR techniques and concluded that the shape of the ligands does not change upon binding. The ligand orientation into the complex is very variable. It is placed inside the central cavity of MK formed by the two structured beta&#8208;sheets domains linked by an intrinsically disordered region (IDR). Docking analysis confirmed the participation of aromatics residues from MK completed with electrostatic interactions. Finally, we test the biological activity by increasing the MK expression using CS tetrasaccharides and their capacity in enhancing the growth stimulation effect of MK in NIH3T3 cells</dc:description>

         <title>Bifunctional Polyene Cyclizations: Synthetic Studies on Pimarane Natural Products</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polyene cyclizations generate molecular complexity from a linear polyene in a single step. While methods to initiate these cyclizations have been continuously expanded and improved over the years, the majority of polyene substrates are still limited to simple alkyl&#8208;substituted alkenes. In this study, we took advantage of the unique reactivity of higher&#8208;functionalized bifunctional alkenes. The realization of a polyene tetracyclization of a dual nucleophilic aryl enol ether involving a transannular  endo  &#8208;termination step enabled the total synthesis of the tricyclic diterpenoid pimara&#8208;15&#8208;en&#8208;3  &#945;  &#8208;8  &#945;  &#8208;diol. The highly flexible and modular route allowed for the preparation of a diverse library of cyclization precursors specifically designed for the total synthesis of the tetracyclic  nor  &#8208;diterpenoid norflickinflimiod C. The tetracyclization of three diversely substituted allenes enabled access to complex pentacyclic products and provided a detailed insight into the underlying reaction pathways.</dc:description>

         <title>Cation ordering and exsolution in copper&#8208;containing forms of the flexible zeolite Rho (Cu,M&#8208;Rho; M = H, Na) and their consequences for CO2 adsorption</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The flexibility of the zeolite Rho framework offers great potential for tunable molecular sieving. The fully copper&#8208;exchanged form of Rho and mixed Cu,H&#8208; and Cu,Na&#8208;forms have been prepared. EPR spectroscopy reveals Cu  2+  cations are present in the dehydrated forms and Rietveld refinement shows these prefer S6R sites, away from the  d8r  windows that control diffusion.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The flexibility of the zeolite Rho framework offers great potential for tunable molecular sieving. The fully copper-exchanged form of Rho and mixed Cu,H- and Cu,Na-forms have been prepared.

         <title>Rigid and Compact Binuclear Bis&#8208;hydrated Gd&#8208;complexes as High Relaxivity MRI Agents</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two novel binuclear PCTA2 and AAZTA2 ligands were synthesized with a multistep process. Their GdIII&#8208;complexes results in molecular relaxivities at 1.5&#8197;T and 298&#8197;K of ca. 24&#8211;25&#8197;mM&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1 thanks to the rigidity and compactness of the ligands. These values are remarkably higher that those found for the corresponding mononuclear complexes.







Abstract
The first binuclear Gd&#8208;complex of the 12&#8208;membered pyridine&#8208;based polyaminocarboxylate macrocyclic ligand PCTA was synthesized by C&#8722;C connection of the pyridine units through two different synthetic procedures. A dimeric AAZTA&#8208;ligand was also synthesized with the aim to compare the relaxometric results or the two ditopic Gd&#8208;complexes. Thus, the 1H relaxometric study on [Gd2PCTA2(H2O)4] and on [Gd2AAZTA2(H2O)4]2&#8722; highlighted the remarkable rigidity and compactness of the two binuclear complexes, which results in molar relaxivities (per Gd), at 1.5&#8197;T and 298&#8197;K of ca. 12&#8211;12.6&#8197;mM&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1 with an increase of ca. 80&#8201;% at 1.5&#8197;T and 298&#8197;K (+70&#8201;% at 310&#8197;K) with respect to the corresponding mononuclear complexes.

         <title>Radical C&#8722;H Trifluoromethoxylation of (Hetero)arenes with Bis(trifluoromethyl)peroxide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bis(trifluoromethyl)peroxide (BTMP) is introduced as a new reagent for the C&#8722;H trifluoromethoxylation of arenes and heteroarenes. Readily accessed from inexpensive bulk chemicals, BTMP serves as a practical source of .OCF3 radicals upon activation through either visible light photoredox or TEMPO catalysis. Both methods deliver valuable fluorine&#8208;containing building blocks in a single step from (hetero)aromatic feedstocks.







Abstract
Trifluoromethoxylated (hetero)arenes are of great interest for several disciplines, especially in agro&#8208; and medicinal chemistry. Radical C&#8722;H trifluoromethoxylation of (hetero)arenes represents an attractive approach to prepare such compounds, but the high cost and low atom economy of existing .OCF3 radical sources make them unsuitable for the large&#8208;scale synthesis of trifluoromethoxylated building blocks. Herein, we introduce bis(trifluoromethyl)peroxide (BTMP, CF3OOCF3) as a practical and efficient trifluoromethoxylating reagent that is easily accessible from inexpensive bulk chemicals. Using either visible light photoredox or TEMPO catalysis, trifluoromethoxylated arenes could be prepared in good yields under mild conditions directly from unactivated aromatics. Moreover, TEMPO catalysis allowed for the one&#8208;step synthesis of valuable pyridine derivatives, which have been previously prepared via multi&#8208;step approaches.

         <title>A Redox&#8208;Active Tetrazine&#8208;Based Pincer Ligand for the Reduction of N&#8208;Oxyanions Using a Redox&#8208;Inert Metal</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
With or without zinc: A redox&#8208;active ligand is shown to be active towards nitrite reduction to nitric oxide, with and without the presence of a coordinated electrophile, zinc. The pre&#8208;reduced ligand stores four protons and four electrons in two reduced tetrazine arms, all of which are used in reactivity with silver nitrite.







Abstract
The reaction chemistry of the bis&#8208;tetrazinyl pyridine ligand (btzp) towards nitrogen oxyanions coordinated to zinc is studied in order to explore the reduction of the NOx&#8722; substrates with a redox&#8208;active ligand in the absence of redox activity at the metal. Following syntheses and characterization of (btzp)ZnX2 for X=Cl, NO3 and NO2, featuring O&#8722;Zn linkage of both nitrogen oxyanions, it is shown that a silylating agent selectively delivers silyl substituents to tetrazine nitrogens, without reductive deoxygenation of NOx&#8722;1. A new synthesis of the highly hydrogenated H4btzp, containing two dihydrotetrazine reductants is described as is the synthesis and characterization of (H4btzp)ZnX2 for X=Cl and NO3, both of which show considerable hydrogen bonding potential of the dihydrotetrazine ring NH groups. The (H4btzp)ZnCl2 complex does not bind zinc in the pincer pocket, but instead H4btzp becomes a bridge between neighboring atoms through tetrazine nitrogen atoms, forming a polymeric chain. The reaction of AgNO2 with (H4btzp)ZnCl2 is shown to proceed with fast nitrite deoxygenation, yielding water and free NO. Half of the H4btzp reducing equivalents form Ag0 and thus the chloride ligand remains coordinated to the zinc metal center to yield (btzp)ZnCl2. To compare with AgNO2, experiments of (H4btzp)ZnCl2 with NaNO2 result in salt metathesis between chloride and nitrite, highlighting the importance of a redox&#8208;active cation in the reduction of nitrite to NO.

         <title>Tuning the &#960;&#8208;Accepting Properties of Mesoionic Carbenes: A Combined Computational and Experimental Study</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In silico screening and experimental verification: A mesoionic imidazolylidene ligand with a diphenyltriazinyl substituent in C2 position (Dpt&#8208;MIC) was found to be a better &#960;&#8208;acceptor when compared to the standard N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene IDipp or to a mesoionic carbene with a phenyl group in C2 position (Ph&#8208;MIC). The utility of the new carbene Dpt&#8208;MIC was evidenced by the synthesis of a low&#8208;valent paramagnetic tin compound.







Abstract
Mesoionic imidazolylidenes are recognized as excellent electron&#8208;donating ligands in organometallic and main group chemistry. However, these carbene ligands typically show poor &#960;&#8208;accepting properties. A computational analysis of 71 mesoionic imidazolylidenes that bear different aryl or heteroaryl substituents in C2 position was performed. The study has revealed that a diphenyltriazinyl (Dpt) substituent renders the corresponding carbene particularly &#960;&#8208;acidic. The computational results could be corroborated experimentally. A mesoionic imidazolylidene with a Dpt substituent was found to be a better &#963;&#8208;donor and a better &#960;&#8208;acceptor compared to an Arduengo&#8208;type N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene. To demonstrate the utility of the new carbene, the ligand was used to stabilize a low&#8208;valent paramagnetic tin compound.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mesoionic imidazolylidenes are recognized as excellent electron-donating ligands in organometallic and main group chemistry. However, these carbene ligands typically show poor &#960;-accepting properties. A computational analysis of 71 mesoionic imidazolylidenes that bear different aryl or heteroaryl substituents in C2 position was performed. The study has revealed that a diphenyltriazinyl (Dpt) substituent renders the corresponding carbene particularly &#960;-acidic. The computational results could be corroborated experimentally. A mesoionic imidazolylidene with a Dpt substituent was found to be a better &#963;-donor and a better &#960;-acceptor compared to an Arduengo-type N-heterocyclic carbene. To demonstrate the utility of the new carbene, the ligand was used to stabilize a low-valent paramagnetic tin compound.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Supramolecular Regulation of Catalytic Activity for an Amphiphilic Pyrene&#8208;Ruthenium Complex in Water</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Off and on again: A supramolecular approach was employed to regulate the catalytic activity of an amphiphilic metal complex pyrene&#8722;ruthenium (Py&#8722;Ru). The self&#8208;assembly of Py&#8722;Ru exhibited an enhanced catalytic efficiency in the transfer hydrogenation of NAD+ to NADH, which could be decreased by forming inclusion complex with cucurbituril. Through competitive replacement with amantadine, the activity of Py&#8722;Ru can be recovered. This supramolecular strategy provides an efficient and flexible method for constructing switchable catalysts.







Abstract
A switchable catalytic system has been designed and constructed with a host&#8722;guest interaction between cucurbituril (CB) and an amphiphilic metal complex pyrene&#8722;ruthenium (Py&#8722;Ru). Py&#8722;Ru can self&#8208;assemble into positively charged nanoparticles in water, and exhibits an enhanced catalytic efficiency in the transfer hydrogenation of NAD+ to NADH. After forming an inclusion complex with CB, Py&#8722;Ru aggregates are broken, leading to a decrease in catalytic efficiency, which can be recovered by competitive replacement with amantadine. This supramolecular strategy provides an efficient and flexible method for constructing reversible catalytic system, which also extends the application scope of the host&#8722;guest interaction.

         <title>&#8220;Snapshot&#8221; Trapping of Multiple Transient Azolyllithiums in Batch</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
&#8220;The selective trapping of multiple transient azolyllithiums in a &#8216;halogen dance&#8217; was realized in a batch reactor, by choosing an appropriate zinc halide diamine complex as the transmetalating agent. The concept that the selectivity is switched by the diamine ligand is unprecedented, in contrast to flow chemistry which controls the reaction time precisely. The reaction is operationally simple and can be performed at 0&#8197;&#176;C with high reproducibility on a multi&#8208;gram scale.&#8221; Read more about the story behind the cover in the Cover Profile and about the research itself on page&#8197;&#9642;&#9642;&#8197;ff.

         <title>Asymmetric Synthesis of Multi&#8208;Substituted Tetrahydrofurans via Palladium/Rhodium Synergistic Catalyzed [3+2] Decarboxylative Cycloaddition of Vinylethylene Carbonates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Unlike the comprehensive development of tandem multi&#8208;metallic catalysis, bimetallic synergistic catalysis has been challenging to achieve high stereoselectivity with the generation of multi&#8208;stereogenic centres. Herein, an efficient synergistic catalysis for the diastereo&#8208; and enantio&#8208;selective synthesis of multi&#8208;substituted tetrahydrofuran derivatives has been developed. Under mild reaction conditions, a series of target molecules with three consecutive stereocenters were synthesized by a palladium(0)/rhodium(III) bimetal&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric decarboxylative [3+2]&#8208;cycloaddition of vinylethylene carbonates with &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated carbonyl compounds.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sandwich complexes of lanthanide have recently attracted a considerable amount of interest due to their applications as single molecule magnet (SMM). Herein, a comprehensive series of heteroleptic lanthanide sandwich complexes ligated by the cyclononatetraenyl (Cnt) and the cyclooctatetraenyl (Cot) ligand [Ln(Cot)(Cnt)] (Ln = Tb, Dy, Er, Ho, Yb, and Lu) is reported. The coordination behavior of the Cnt ligand has been investigated along the series and shows different coordination patterns in the solid&#8208;state depending on the size of the corresponding lanthanide ion without altering its overall anisotropy. Besides the characterization in the solid state by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and in solution by  1  H NMR, static magnetic studies and ab initio computational studies were performed.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Searching novel anode materials to address the issues of poor cycle stability in the aqueous lithium&#8208;ion battery system is highly desirable. In this work, ammonium vanadium bronze (NH  4  )  2  V  7  O  16  with brick&#8208;like morphology has been investigated as an anode material for aqueous lithium&#8208;ion batteries and Li  +  /Na  +  hybrid ion batteries. The two novel full cell systems, (NH  4  )  2  V  7  O  16  // Li  2  SO  4  // LiMn  2  O  4  and (NH  4  )  2  V  7  O  16  // Na  2  SO  4  // LiMn  2  O  4  , both demonstrate good rate capability and excellent cycling performance. The capacity retention of 78.61% after 500 cycles at 300 mA g  &#8208;1  has been demonstrated in the (NH  4  )  2  V  7  O  16  // Li  2  SO  4  // LiMn  2  O  4  system while no capacity attenuation is observed in the (NH  4  )  2  V  7  O  16  // Na  2  SO  4  // LiMn  2  O  4  system. The reaction mechanisms of the (NH  4  )  2  V  7  O  16  electrode and impedance variation of the two full cells have also been researched. The excellent cycling stability suggests that the layered (NH  4  )  2  V  7  O  16  can be a promising anode material for aqueous rechargeable lithium&#8208;ion batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Cata&#8208;Annulated Azaacene Bisimides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ultra&#8208;electron&#8208;deficient azaacenes were synthesized via Buchwald&#8208;Hartwig coupling of ortho&#8208;diaminoarenes with chlorinated mellophanic diimide followed by oxidation of the intermediate N,N&#8217;&#8208;dihydro compounds with MnO2 or PbO2. The resulting cata&#8208;annulated bisimide azaacenes have ultrahigh electron affinities with first reduction potentials as low as &#8211;0.35 V recorded for a tetraazapentacene. Attempts to prepare a tetrakis&#173;(dicarboximide)&#173;tetraazaheptacene resulted in the formation of a symmetric butterfly dimer.</dc:description>

         <title>Chemodynamic Therapy Combined with Multifunctional Nanomaterials and Their Applications in Tumor Treatment</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>During the past few decades, radiotherapy and chemotherapy have once been the standard approaches for tumor treatments. However, the potential toxic effect and side effects of both radiotherapy and chemotherapy on the human body still cannot be neglected. Given this, the Fenton reaction has become one of the most effective treatment strategies to combat tumor cells. This review aims to comprehensively and systematically summarize the recent advances in chemodynamic therapy (CDT) via the Fenton reaction. In addition, a host of the advanced nano&#8208;multifunctional materials and engineering bacteria used in the Fenton reaction were also summarized. This paper would be helpful to provide guidance and lay firm foundations for future tumor treatment.</dc:description>

         <title>Ionic Liquids [M3+][A&#8211;]3 with Three&#8208;Valent Cations and Their Possible Use to Easily Separate Rare Earth Metals</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We introduce a simple way to liquify rare earth metals (REM) by incorporating the corresponding cations, in particular Eu  3+  , La  3+  , and Y  3+  , into polyvalent Ionic Liquids. In contrast to conventional methods, this is achieved not by transforming them into anionic complexes, but by keeping them as bare cations and combining them with convenient, cheap and commercially available anions (A) in the form [REM  3+  ][A  &#8211;  ]  3  . To do so, we follow the COncept of Melting Point Lowering due to EThoxylation (COMPLET) with alkyl polyethylene oxide carboxylates as anions. We provide basic properties, such as glass transition temperatures, viscosities, electrical conductivities, as well as water&#8208;octanol partition constants  P  and show that these ILs have remarkably different properties, despite the similarity of their cations. In addition, we show that the ionic liquids possess interesting luminescent properties as non&#8208;conventional fluorophores.</dc:description>

         <title>Copper&#8208;Photocatalyzed Hydrosilylation of Alkynes and Alkenes under Continuous Flow</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Go with the flow: The photocatalytic hydrosilylation of alkynes and alkenes under continuous&#8208;flow conditions using the [Cu(dmp)(XantphosTEPD)]PF6 catalyst under blue LEDs irradiation is reported. A large panel of alkenes and alkynes was functionalized in good to excellent yields with a large functional group tolerance.







Abstract
Herein, the photocatalytic hydrosilylation of alkynes and alkenes under continuous flow conditions is described. By using 0.2&#8197;mol&#8201;% of the developed [Cu(dmp)(XantphosTEPD)]PF6 under blue LEDs irradiation, a large panel of alkenes and alkynes was hydrosilylated in good to excellent yields with a large functional group tolerance. The mechanism of the reaction was studied, and a plausible scenario was suggested.

         <title>Multi&#8208;Channel Optical Device for Solar&#8208;Driven Bacterial Inactivation under Real&#8208;Time Temperature Feedback</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Solar&#8208;driven photothermal antibacterial device was designed with multilayers based on IrO2 nanoaggregates&#8208;based photothermal and temperature sensor channels. The device can efficiently inactivate bacteria by monitoring the temperature accurately during the photothermal process. This study could provide valuable insight for development of solar&#8208;driven and self&#8208;feedback device for photothermal antibacterial materials.







Abstract
Solar&#8208;driven photothermal antibacterial devices have attracted a lot of interest due to the fact that solar energy is one of the cleanest sources of energy in the world. However, conventional materials have a narrow absorbance band, resulting in deficient solar harvesting. In addition, lack of knowledge on temperature change in these devices during the photothermal process has also led to a waste of energy. Here, we presented an elegant multi&#8208;channel optical device with a multilayer structure to simultaneously address the above&#8208;mentioned issues in solar&#8208;driven antibacterial devices. In the photothermal channel, semiconductor IrO2&#8208;nanoaggregates exhibited higher solar absorbance and photothermal conversion efficiency compared with nanoparticles. In the luminescence channel, thermal&#8208;sensitive Er&#8208;doped upconversion nanoparticles were utilized to reflect the microscale temperature in real&#8208;time. The bacteria were successfully inactivated during the photothermal effect under solar irradiation with temperature monitoring. This study could provide valuable insight for the development of smart photothermal devices for solar&#8208;driven photothermal bacterial inactivation in the future.

         <title>Enantioselective Recognition of Racemic Amino Alcohols in Aqueous Solution by Chiral Metal&#8208;Oxide Keplerate {Mo132}&#8208;cluster Capsules</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Determining the relative configuration or enantiomeric excess of a substance may be achieved using NMR spectroscopy by employing chiral shift reagents (CSRs). Such reagents non&#8208;covalently interact with the chiral solute, resulting in each chiral form experiencing different magnetic anisotropy, which is reflected in their NMR spectra. The Keplerate polyoxometalate (POM) is a molybdenum&#8208;based, water&#8208;soluble, discrete inorganic structure with a pore&#8208;accessible inner cavity, decorated by differentiable ligands. Through ligand exchange from the self&#8208;assembled nanostructure we have synthesized a set of chiral Keplerate host molecules. By exploiting interactions of analyte molecules at the surface pores we establish the relative configuration of chiral amino alcohol guests (phenylalaninol and 2&#8208;amino&#8208;1&#8208;phenylethanol) in aqueous solvent and determine their enantiomeric excess by  1  H NMR. The use of POMs as chiral shift reagents represents an application of the class that is yet to be well established and opens avenues into aqueous host&#8208;guest chemistry with self&#8208;assembled recognition agents.</dc:description>

         <title>Through Bridge Spin Coupling in Homo&#8208; and Heterobimetallic Porphyrin Dimers upon Stepwise Oxidations: A Spectroscopic and Theoretical Investigation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Homo&#8208; and heterobimetallic porphyrin dimers have been synthesized, which, upon 2e&#8208;oxidation, produce stable dication diradical species as shown. Through the bridge, both porphyrin rings exhibited notable conjugation resulting in effective coupling between metal and porphyrin radical spins of both rings while the coupling model dependent on the nature of metal ion used. Mulliken spin density distributions display the Cu(II) porphyrin center as charge donor while Fe(III)/Mn(III) porphyrin center as charge acceptor.







Abstract
We have described copper(II)&#8208;iron(III) and copper(II)&#8208;manganese(III) heterobimetallic porphyrin dimers and compared them with the corresponding homobimetallic analogs. UV&#8208;visible spectra are very distinct in the heterometallic species while electrochemical studies demonstrate that these species, as compared to the homobimetallic analog, are much easier to oxidize. Combined M&#246;ssbauer, EPR, NMR, magnetic and UV&#8208;visible spectroscopic studies show that upon 2e&#8208;oxidation of the heterobimetallic complexes only ring&#8208;centered oxidation occurs. The energy differences between HOMO and LUMO are linearly dependent with the low&#8208;energy NIR band obtained for the 2e&#8208;oxidized complexes. Also, strong electronic communication between two porphyrin rings through the bridge facilitates coupling between various unpaired spins present while the coupling model depends on the nature of metal ions used. While unpaired spins of Fe(III) and the porphyrin &#960;&#8208;cation radical are strongly antiferromagnetically coupled, such coupling is rather weak between Mn(III) and a porphyrin &#960;&#8208;cation radical. Moreover, the coupling between two &#960;&#8208;cation radicals are much stronger in the 2e&#8208;oxidized complexes of dimanganese(III) and copper(II)&#8208;manganese(III) porphyrin dimers as compared to their diiron(III) and copper(II)&#8208;iron(III) analogs. Furthermore, coupling between the unpaired spins of a &#960;&#8208;cation radical and copper(II) is much stronger in the 2e&#8208;oxidized complex of copper(II)&#8208;iron(III) porphyrin dimer as compared to its copper(II)&#8208;manganese(III) analog. The Mulliken spin density distributions in 2e&#8208;oxidized homo&#8208; and heterobimetallic complexes show symmetric and asymmetric spread between the two macrocycles, respectively. In both the 2e&#8208;oxidized heterobimetallic complexes, the Cu(II) porphyrin center acts as a charge donor while Fe(III)/Mn(III) porphyrin center act as a charge acceptor. The experimental observations are also strongly supported by DFT calculations.

&lt;p&gt;We have described copper(II)-iron(III) and copper(II)-manganese(III) heterobimetallic porphyrin dimers and compared them with the corresponding homobimetallic analogs. UV-visible spectra are very distinct in the heterometallic species while electrochemical studies demonstrate that these species, as compared to the homobimetallic analog, are much easier to oxidize. Combined M&#246;ssbauer, EPR, NMR, magnetic and UV-visible spectroscopic studies show that upon 2e-oxidation of the heterobimetallic complexes only ring-centered oxidation occurs. The energy differences between HOMO and LUMO are linearly dependent with the low-energy NIR band obtained for the 2e-oxidized complexes. Also, strong electronic communication between two porphyrin rings through the bridge facilitates coupling between various unpaired spins present while the coupling model depends on the nature of metal ions used. While unpaired spins of Fe(III) and the porphyrin &#960;-cation radical are strongly antiferromagnetically coupled, such coupling is rather weak between Mn(III) and a porphyrin &#960;-cation radical. Moreover, the coupling between two &#960;-cation radicals are much stronger in the 2e-oxidized complexes of dimanganese(III) and copper(II)-manganese(III) porphyrin dimers as compared to their diiron(III) and copper(II)-iron(III) analogs. Furthermore, coupling between the unpaired spins of a &#960;-cation radical and copper(II) is much stronger in the 2e-oxidized complex of copper(II)-iron(III) porphyrin dimer as compared to its copper(II)-manganese(III) analog.

         <title>Synthesis of Three&#8208;Dimensional (Di)Azatricyclododecene Scaffold and Its Application to Peptidomimetics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three&#8208;dimensional (3D) scaffolds have the potential to provide unique bioactivity, which cannot be achieved by conventional flat aromatic ring&#8208;based compounds. (Di)Azatricyclododecene scaffold with a bridged tricyclic system was developed and applied to design peptidomimetics with a 3D scaffold. The designed peptidomimetics showed inhibition of HIF transcription activity and antiviral activity toward rabies virus, both of which &#945;&#8208;helix peptide mediated interaction play a pivotal role.







Abstract
A novel sp3 carbon&#8208;rich tricyclic 3D scaffold&#8208;based peptide mimetic compound library was constructed to target protein&#8208;protein interactions. Tricyclic framework 7 was synthesized from 9&#8208;azabicyclo[3,3,1]nonan&#8208;3&#8208;one (11) via a gold(I)&#8208;catalyzed Conia&#8208;ene reaction. The electron&#8208;donating group on the pendant alkyne of cyclization precursor 12&#8201;b&#8211;e was the key to forming 6&#8208;endo&#8208;dig cyclized product 7 with complete regioselectivity. Using the synthetic strategy for regioselective construction of bridged tricyclic framework 7, a diazatricyclododecene 3D&#8208;scaffold 8&#8201;a, which enables the introduction of substituents into the scaffold to mimic amino acid side chains, was designed and synthesized. The peptide mimetics 21&#8201;a&#8211;u were synthesized via step&#8208;by&#8208;step installation of three substituents on diazatricyclododecene scaffold 8&#8201;a. Compounds 21&#8201;a&#8211;h were synthesized as &#945;&#8208;helix peptide mimics of hydrophobic ZZxxZ and ZxxZZ sequences (Z=Leu or Phe) and subjected to cell&#8208;based assays: antiproliferative activity, HIF&#8208;1 transcriptional activity which is considered to affect cancer malignancy, and antiviral activity against rabies virus. Compound 21&#8201;a showed the strongest inhibitory activity of HIF&#8208;1 transcriptional activity (IC50=4.1&#177;0.8&#8197;&#956;M), whereas compounds 21&#8201;a&#8211;g showed antiviral activity with IC50 values of 4.2&#8211;12.4&#8197;&#956;M, suggesting that the 3D&#8208;scaffold 8&#8201;a has potential as a versatile peptide mimic skeleton.

         <title>Nucleophilicities and Nucleofugalities of Thio&#8208; and Selenoethers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Strong nucleophiles and weak Lewis bases: Kinetic studies by laser flash photolytic methods reveal that dialkyl sulfides and selenides are strong nucleophiles, comparable to pyridine and N&#8208;methylimidazole. Because of their low Lewis basicity (6 to 7 orders of magnitude lower than that of pyridine with respect to C&#8208;centred Lewis acids) they are also good nucleofuges, which makes them useful group&#8208;transfer reagents. Low Marcus intrinsic barriers account for the different ranking of dialkyl chalcogenides in nucleophilicity and Lewis basicity scales.







Abstract
Rate constants for the reactions of dialkyl chalcogenides with laser flash photolytically generated benzhydrylium ions have been measured photometrically to integrate them into the comprehensive benzhydrylium&#8208;based nucleophilicity scale. Combining these rate constants with the previously reported equilibrium constants for the same reactions provided the corresponding Marcus intrinsic barriers and made it possible to quantify the leaving group abilities (nucleofugalities) of dialkyl sulfides and dimethyl selenide. Due to the low intrinsic barriers, dialkyl chalcogenides are fairly strong nucleophiles (comparable to pyridine and N&#8208;methylimidazole) as well as good nucleofuges; this makes them useful group&#8208;transfer reagents.

         <title>Highly Enantioselective Synthesis of Phosphorus&#8208;Containing &#1013;&#8208;Benzosultams by Bifunctional Phosphonium Salt&#8208;Promoted Hydrophosphonylation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The crucial ingredients: The first highly enantioselective hydrophosphonylation of seven&#8208;membered cyclic N&#8208;sulfonyl imines by bifunctional phosphonium salt catalysis has been developed, and a broad range of optically pure phosphorus&#8208;containing &#1013;&#8208;benzosultam compounds was readily prepared under mild conditions with very low catalyst loading, easy purification and high yields. The practicality and utility of this protocol were demonstrated by scaled&#8208;up reactions and facile synthetic elaborations. The mechanistic results suggested that the ion&#8208;pair and H&#8208;bonding interactions were crucial in asymmetric induction.







Abstract
&#1013;&#8208;Benzosultam derivatives are potential drug candidates with diverse biological activities. A series of chiral &#1013;&#8208;benzosultams bearing phosphorus functionalities was synthesized by catalytic asymmetric hydrophosphonylation in the presence of a bifunctional phosphonium salt catalyst. The desired hydrophosphonylation products were obtained in good yields with high enantioselectivities, and scale&#8208;up reactions and further derivations were successfully accomplished. Some control experiments were also conducted to elucidate the plausible reaction mechanism of this chemical transformation.

         <title>Experimental and Computational Models for Side Chain Discrimination in Peptide&#8211;Protein Interactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A model system to study interactions between aromatic cavities and non&#8208;polar side chains was developed and studied by different NMR methods, where a weak but evident side&#8208;chain discrimination was observed. The experimental quantitative and qualitative data was used to evaluate different computational methods, with the conclusion that, for this system, molecular mechanics gave more accurate results than density functional theory calculations. More information can be found in the Full Paper by P.&#8208;O. Norrby, K. W&#228;rnmark, et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202100890).

         <title>Coinage Metal Complexes with Di&#8208;tertiary&#8208;butyl Sulfide as Precursors with Ultra&#8208;Low Decomposition Temperature</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Functional nanomaterials are indispensable to modern technologies and their low&#8208;temperature synthesis is a key&#8208;step to their incorporation in technologically advanced areas. In our pursuit to identify the reagents that are reactive at low temperature, we exploit here the inherent facile decomposition mechanism in the di&#8208;tertiary&#8208;butyl sulfide ligand as a strategy to obtain molecular complexes with ultra&#8208;low decomposition temperature and explore their application as facile precursors to highly crystalline metal sulfide or metallic nanoparticles.

         <title>What is the Catalytic Mechanism of Enzymatic Histone N&#8208;Methyl Arginine Demethylation and Can It be Influenced by an External Electric Field?</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Methylation of arginine residues in histones is an important mechanism of epigenetic regulation, and its dysregulation results in human diseases such as cancer and brain disorders. This study reveals the catalytic mechanism of the demethylation of methylated arginine R3 in H4 histone by a non&#8208;heme Fe(II) and 2&#8208;Oxoglutarate&#8208;Dependent Histone demethylase 4E (KDM4E). Applying QM/MM and MD, we explored both C&#8211;H and N&#8211;H activations pathways. Importantly, the study revealed that by applying external electric fields (EEFs), we can modulate the C&#8211;H and N&#8211;H selectivities. More information can be found in the Full Paper by C.&#8197;Z. Christov et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202101174).

         <title>Metal&#8208;Free Photoredox&#8208;Catalyzed Hydrodefluorination of Fluoroarenes Utilizing Amide Solvent as Reductant</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A metal&#8208;free photoredox&#8208;catalyzed hydrodefluorination of fluoroarenes was achieved using  N,N,N&#8217;,N&#8217;  &#8208;tetramethyl&#8208;  para  &#8208;phenylenediamine  (1  ) as a strong photoreduction catalyst. This reaction was applicable not only to electron&#8208;rich monofluoroarenes but also to polyfluoroarenes to afford non&#8208;fluorinated arenes. The experimental mechanistic studies indicated that the amide solvent NMP plays an important role for regeneration of the photocatalyst, enabling additive&#8208;free photoreduction catalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Graphene oxide assisted covalent triazine framework for boosting photocatalytic H2 evolution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Covalent triazine frameworks (CTFs) with two&#8208;dimensional structures have exhibited promising visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced H2 evolution performance. However, it is still a challenge to improve its activity. Herein, we report &#960;&#8208;conjugation&#8208;linked CTF&#8208;1/GO for boosting photocatalytic H2 evolution. The CTF&#8208;1/GO hybrid material was obtained by a facile low&#8208;temperature condensation of 1,4&#8208;Dicyanobenzene in the presence of GO. The results of photocatalytic H2 evolution indicate that the optimum hybrid, CTF&#8208;1/GO&#8208;3.0, exhibited an H2 evolution rate of 2262.4 &#956;mol&#183;g&#8208;1&#183;h&#8208;1 under visible light irradiation, which was 9 times that of pure CTF&#8208;1. The enhanced photocatalytic performance could be attributed to the GO in CTF&#8208;1/GO hybrids not only acts as an electron collector and transporter like a &#8220;bridge&#8221; to facilitate the separation and transfer of photogenerated charges but also shortens the electron migration path due to its thin sheet layer uniformly distribution over CTF&#8208;1. This work could help future development of novel conjugated CTF&#8208;based composite materials as high&#8208;efficiency photocatalyst for photocatalysis.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Addition of PPh  2  H, PPhMeH, PPhH  2  , P(  para  &#8208;Tol)H&#173;  2  , PMesH  2  and PH  3  to the two&#8208;coordinate Ni(0) N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene species [Ni(NHC)  2  ] (NHC = I  i  Pr  2  , IMe  4  , IEt  2  Me  2  ) affords a series of mononuclear, terminal phosphido Ni complexes. Structural characterisation of nine of these compounds show they exhibit unusual  trans  [H&#8208;Ni&#8208;PR  2  ] or novel  trans  [R  2  P&#8208;Ni&#8208;PR  2  ] geometries. The bis&#8208;phosphido complexes are more accessible when smaller NHCs (IMe  4  &gt; IEt  2  Me  2  &gt; I  i  Pr) and phosphines are employed. P&#8208;P activation of the diphosphines R  2  P&#8208;PR  2  (R  2  = Ph  2  , PhMe) provides an alternative route to some of the [Ni(NHC)  2  (PR  2  )  2  ] complexes. DFT calculations capture these trends with P&#8208;H bond activation proceeding from unconventional phosphine adducts in which the H substituent bridges the Ni&#8208;P bond. P&#8208;P bond activation from [Ni(NHC)  2  (Ph  2  P&#8208;PPh  2  )] adducts proceeds with computed barriers below 10 kcal/mol. The ability of the [Ni(NHC)  2  ] moiety to afford isolable terminal phosphido products reflects the stability of the Ni&#8208;NHC bond that prevents ligand dissociation and onward reaction.</dc:description>

         <title>Stability of AgIII towards Halides in Organosilver(III) Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The involvement of silver in two&#8208;electron processes Ag(I/III) is currently emerging. However, the range of stability of the required and uncommon Ag(III) species is virtually unknown. Here, the stability of Ag(III) towards the whole set of halide ligands in the organosilver(III) complex frame [(CF&#8323;)&#8323;AgX]&#8315; is theoretically analyzed (X = F to At). Even the softest and least electronegative halides (I and At) are found to form reasonably stable Ag(III)&#8211;X bonds. Our estimates were confirmed by experiment. In fact, the whole series of non&#8208;radiative halide complexes [PPh&#8324;][(CF&#8323;)&#8323;AgX] (X = F to I) has been experimentally prepared and isolated in pure form. The pseudohalides [PPh&#8324;][(CF&#8323;)&#8323;AgCN] and [PPh4][(CF&#8323;)&#8323;AgN&#8323;] have also been isolated, the latter being the first silver(III) azido&#8208;complex. Except for the iodo&#8208;compound, the crystal structures have been established by X&#8208;ray diffraction methods. The decomposition paths of the [(CF&#8323;)&#8323;AgX]&#8315; entities at the unimolecular level have been examined in the gas phase by multistage mass spectrometry (MSn). The experimental detection of the two series of mixed complexes [CF&#8323;AgX]&#8315; and [FAgX]&#8315; arising from the corresponding parent species [(CF&#8323;)&#8323;AgX]&#8315; demonstrates that the Ag&#8211;X bond is particularly robust. Our experimental observations are rationalized with the aid of theoretical methods. Smooth variation with the electronegativity of X is also observed in the thermolyses of bulk samples. The experimentally established compatibility of Ag(III) with the heaviest halides is of particular relevance to silver&#8208;mediated or &#8208;catalyzed processes.</dc:description>

         <title>Ni(II) Precatalysts Enable Thioetherification of (Hetero)aryl Halides and Tosylates and Tandem C&#8208;S/C&#8208;N Couplings</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ni&#8208;catalyzed C&#8208;S cross&#8208;coupling reactions have received less attention compared with other C&#8208;heteroatom couplings. Most reported examples comprise the thioetherification of most reactive aryl iodides with aromatic thiols. The use of C&#8208;O electrophiles in this context is almost uncharted. Here we describe that preformed Ni(II) precatalysts of the type NiCl(allyl)(PMe  2  Ar&#8217;) (Ar&#8217; = terphenyl group) efficiently couple a wide range of (hetero)aryl halides, including challenging aryl chlorides, with a variety of aromatic and aliphatic thiols. Aryl and alkenyl tosylates are also well tolerated demonstrating, for the first time, to be competent electrophilic partners in Ni&#8208;catalyzed C&#8208;S bond formation. The chemoselective functionalization of the C&#8208;I bond in the presence of C&#8208;Cl bond allows for designing site&#8208;selective tandem C&#8208;S/C&#8208;N couplings. The formation of the two C&#8208;heteroatom bonds takes place in a single operation and represents a rare example of dual electrophile/nucleophile chemoselective process.</dc:description>

The mild nucleophilicity of NaBHT, coupled with the anti&#8208;oxidant properties of its conjugate acid byproduct, BHT means the process seems to have no functional group incompatibilities. Highly effective coupling of base&#8208;sensitive and redox&#8208;active functional groups was observed in all cases with only 0.1&#8208;0.2 mol percent catalyst.

         <title>Bidentate Disilicate Framework for Bis&#8208;Grafted Surface Species</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Recent advances in surface organometallic chemistry have enabled the detailed characterization of the surface species in single&#8208;site heterogeneous catalysts. However, the selective formation of bis&#8208;grafted surface species remains challenging because of the heterogeneity of the supporting surface. Herein, we introduce a metal complex bearing bidentate disilicate ligands, &#8211;OSi(O  t  Bu)  2  OSi(O  t  Bu)  2  O&#8211;, as a molecular precursor, which has a silicate framework adjacent to the metal (Pt) center. The grafting of the precursors on silica supports (MCM&#8208;41 and CARiACT Q10) proceeded through a substitution reaction on the silicon atoms of the disilicate ligand, which was verified by the detection of isobutene and  t  BuOH as the elimination products, to selectively yield bis&#8208;grafted surface species. The chemical structure of the surface species was characterized by solid&#8208;state NMR, and the chemical shift values of the ancillary ligands and  195  Pt nuclei suggested that the bidentate coordination sphere was maintained following grafting.</dc:description>

         <title>A Fluorescence Sensor Array Based on Zinc(II)&#8208;Carboxyamidoquinolines: Toward Quantitative Detection of ATP**
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fluorescent carboxyamidoquinoline&#8208;zinc(II) assemblies were investigated as sensors for biologically relevant phosphate anions in water at low concentrations (micromolar). Analyte&#8208;specific changes in fluorescence allow for differentiation of inorganic phosphate, pyrophosphate, ADP, and ATP from eight other anionic analytes in a HEPES buffer. A fluorescence based array enabled quantitative analysis of ATP in the concentration range of 5&#8211;100&#8197;&#956;M.







Abstract
The newly prepared fluorescent carboxyamidoquinolines (1&#8211;3) and their Zn(II) complexes (Zn@1&#8208;Zn@3) were used to bind and sense various phosphate anions utilizing a relay mechanism, in which the Zn(II) ion migrates from the Zn@1&#8208;Zn@3 complexes to the phosphate, namely adenosine 5&#8217;&#8208;triphosphate (ATP) and pyrophosphate (PPi), a process accompanied by a dramatic change in fluorescence. Zn@1&#8208;Zn@3 assemblies interact with adenine nucleotide phosphates while displaying an analyte&#8208;specific response. This process was investigated using UV&#8208;vis, fluorescence, and NMR spectroscopy. It is shown that the different binding selectivity and the corresponding fluorescence response enable differentiation of adenosine 5&#8217;&#8208;triphosphate (ATP), adenosine 5&#8217;&#8208;diphosphate (ADP), pyrophosphate (PPi), and phosphate (Pi). The cross&#8208;reactive nature of the carboxyamidoquinolines&#8208;Zn(II) sensors in conjunction with linear discriminant analysis (LDA) was utilized in a simple fluorescence chemosensor array that allows for the identification of ATP, ADP, PPi, and Pi from 8 other anions including adenosine 5&#8217;&#8208;monophosphate (AMP) with 100&#8201;% correct classification. Furthermore, the support vector machine algorithm, a machine learning method, allowed for highly accurate quantitation of ATP in the range of 5&#8211;100&#8197;&#956;M concentration in unknown samples with error &lt;2.5&#8201;%.

         <title>Non&#8208;Covalent Interactions in the Biphenyl Crystal: Is the Planar Conformer a Transition State?</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Planar biphenyl is a stable minimum on the quantum mechanical potential energy surface of the crystal. The lack of thermal disorder in the phase I at 100&#8197;K and the properties of the experimental and theoretical electron densities support this conclusion. The crystal packing is mostly determined by intra and intermolecular hydrogen&#8208;hydrogen bonding, non&#8208;covalent 
 interactions and internal rotation of the biphenyl molecule.







Abstract
A combined experimental and theoretical study of the biphenyl (BP) crystal is presented. The X&#8208;ray diffraction data collected at 100&#8197;K were subjected to Hirshfeld atom and multipole refinements of the electron density, &#961;(r). A theoretical exploration of the potential energy surface (PES) of the crystal was also carried out.

     alt="Non-Covalent Interactions in the Biphenyl Crystal: Is the Planar Conformer a Transition State?"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Planar biphenyl is a stable minimum&lt;/b&gt; on the quantum mechanical potential energy surface of the crystal. The lack of thermal disorder in the phase I at 100&#8197;K and the properties of the experimental and theoretical electron densities support this conclusion. The crystal packing is mostly determined by intra and intermolecular hydrogen-hydrogen bonding, non-covalent 
 interactions and internal rotation of the biphenyl molecule.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A combined experimental and theoretical study of the biphenyl (BP) crystal is presented. The X-ray diffraction data collected at 100&#8197;K were subjected to Hirshfeld atom and multipole refinements of the electron density, &#961;(r). A theoretical exploration of the potential energy surface (PES) of the crystal was also carried out. This investigation challenges the common assumption that the planar structure of BP in the phase I crystal is an average of two twisted configurations in a double-well potential. The theoretical computations provide compelling evidence that this structure corresponds to a minimum on the PES hence to a stable molecular arrangement. Consistently, the experiment showed no evidence of positional or dynamic disorder. The intramolecular hydrogen-hydrogen bonds detected are not repulsive. The topological analysis of the experimental and theoretical &#961;(r) reveals that both the intra- and intermolecular H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H and the C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; contacts stabilize the BP crystal.&lt;/p&gt;

Host&#8208;Guest Interaction in Ethylene and Ethane Separation on Zeolitic Imidazolate Frameworks as Revealed by Solid&#8208;State NMR Spectroscopy (Deng)







Abstract
The separation of ethane/ethylene mixture by using metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) as adsorbents is strongly associated with the pore size&#8208;sieving effect and the adsorbent&#8208;adsorbate interaction. Herein, solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy is utilized to explore the host&#8208;guest interaction and ethane/ethylene separation mechanism on zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs). Preferential access to the ZIF&#8208;8 and ZIF&#8208;8&#8208;90 frameworks by ethane compared to ethylene is directly visualized from two&#8208;dimensional 1H&#8208;1H spin diffusion MAS NMR spectroscopy and further verified by computational density distributions. The 1H MAS NMR spectroscopy provides an alternative for straightforwardly extracting the adsorption selectivity of ethane/ethylene mixture at 1.1&#8764;9.6&#8197;bar in ZIFs, which is consistent with the IAST predictions.

         <title>Unveiling Polymerization Mechanism in pH&#8208;regulated Supramolecular Fibers in Aqueous Media</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis and self&#8208;assembly in aqueous media of an amine functionalized C3&#8208;symmetric benzotrithiophene is reported. A dramatic change in the polymerization mechanism and size of the supramolecular fibers is observed upon modifying the pH, which is further employed to finely control the one&#8208;dimensional supramolecular polymerization and copolymerization processes.







Abstract
An amine functionalized C3&#8208;symmetric benzotrithiophene (BTT) monomer has been designed and synthetized in order to form pH responsive one&#8208;dimensional supramolecular polymers in aqueous media. While most of the reported studies looked at the effect of pH on the size of the aggregates, herein, a detailed mechanistic study is reported, carried out upon modifying the pH to trigger the formation of positively charged ammonium groups. A dramatic and reversible change in the polymerization mechanism and size of the supramolecular fibers is observed and ascribed to the combination of Coulombic repulsive forces and higher monomer solubility. Furthermore, the induced frustrated growth of the fibers is further employed to finely control the one&#8208;dimensional supramolecular polymerisation and copolymerization processes.

         <title>Synthesis of Cu&#8208;Modified Nickel Oxide Nanocrystals and Their Applications as Hole&#8208;Injection layers for Quantum&#8208;Dot Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>

A simple post&#8208;synthetic surface&#8208;modification strategy to anchor Cu species onto the surfaces of as&#8208;prepared NiOx nanocrystals, leading to Cu&#8208;modified NiOx (NiOx&#8208;Cu) nanocrystals was developed. The low&#8208;temperature&#8208;processed (135&#8201;&#176;C) films based on the NiOx&#8208;Cu nanocrystals show enhanced conductance, which is beneficial for use as hole&#8208;injection layers for quantum&#8208;dot light&#8208;emitting diodes.







Abstract
Solution&#8208;processed NiOx thin films have been applied as hole&#8208;injection layers (HILs) in quantum&#8208;dot light&#8208;emitting diodes (QLEDs). The commonly used NiOx HILs are prepared by the precursor&#8208;based route, which requires high annealing temperatures of over 275&#8201;&#176;C to in&#8197;situ convert the precursors into oxide films. Such high processing temperatures of NiOx HILs hinder their applications in flexible devices. Herein, we report a low&#8208;temperature approach based on Cu&#8208;modified NiOx (NiOx&#8208;Cu) nanocrystals to prepare HILs. A simple post&#8208;synthetic surface&#8208;modification step, which anchors the copper agents onto the surfaces of oxide nanocrystals, is developed to improve the electrical conductivity of the low&#8208;temperature&#8208;processed (135&#8201;&#176;C) oxide&#8208;nanocrystal thin films. In consequence, QLEDs based on the NiOx&#8208;Cu HILs exhibit an external quantum efficiency of 17.5&#8201;% and a T95 operational lifetime of &#8764;2,800&#8197;h at an initial brightness of 1,000&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2, meeting the commercialization requirements for display applications. The results shed light on the potential of using NiOx&#8208;Cu HILs for realizing high&#8208;performance flexible QLEDs.

         <title>Solution Processing of Topochemically Converted Layered WO3 for Multifunctional Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
WO3 dispersions: Bulk layered WO3 has been synthesized from bulk WS2 through topochemical conversion. Furthermore, liquid&#8208;phase exfoliation was carried out to obtain a WO3 dispersion that could be directly used to fabricate thin films by the spray&#8208;coating method. WO3 thin films were used as electrodes in supercapacitors and photo&#8208;electrochemical water oxidation.







Abstract
Solution processing of nanomaterials is a promising technique for use in various applications owing to its simplicity and scalability. However, the studies on liquid&#8208;phase exfoliation (LPE) of tungsten oxide (WO3) are limited, unlike others, by a lack of commercial availability of bulk WO3 with layered structures. Herein, a one&#8208;step topochemical synthesis approach to obtain bulk layered WO3 from commercially available layered tungsten disulfide (WS2) by optimizing various parameters like reaction time and temperature is reported. Detailed microscopic and spectroscopic techniques confirmed the conversion process. Further, LPE was carried out on topochemically converted bulk layered WO3 in 22 different solvents; among the solvents studied, the propan&#8208;2&#8208;ol/water (1&#8201;:&#8201;1) co&#8208;solvent system appeared to be the best. This indicates that the possible values of surface tension and Hansen solubility parameters for bulk WO3 could be close to that of the co&#8208;solvent system. The obtained WO3 dispersions in a low&#8208;boiling&#8208;point solvent enable thin films of various thickness to be fabricated by using spray coating. The obtained thin films were used as active materials in supercapacitors without any conductive additives/binders and exhibited an areal capacitance of 31.7&#8197;mF&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 5&#8197;mV&#8201;s&#8722;1. Photo&#8208;electrochemical measurements revealed that these thin films can also be used as photoanodes for photo&#8208;electrochemical water oxidation.

         <title>Molecular Recognition of Nerve Agents and Their Organophosphorus Surrogates:&#160;Toward Supramolecular Scavengers and Catalysts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nerve agents are tetrahedral organophosphorus compounds (OPs) that were developed in the last century to irreversibly inhibit acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and therefore impede neurological signaling in living organisms. Exposure to OPs leads to a rapid development of symptoms from excessive salivation, nasal congestion and chest pain to convulsion and asphyxiation which if left untreated may lead to death. These potent toxins are prepared on a large scale from inexpensive staring materials, making it feasible for terrorist groups or states to use them against military and civilians. The existing antidotes provide limited protection and are difficult to apply to a large number of affected individuals. While new prophylactics are currently being developed, there is still need for therapeutics capable of both preventing and reversing the effects of OP poisoning. In this review, we describe how the science of molecular recognition can expand the pallet of tools for rapid and safe sequestration of nerve agents.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>A novel electrochemical protocol for the oxidative cleavage of indoles has been developed, which o&#64256;ers a simple way to access synthetically useful anthranilic acid derivatives. In undivided cells, a wide variety of indoles and alcohol compounds are examined to a&#64256;ord amide ester aromatics without using extra oxidants and stoichiometric metal catalysts, which avoids the formation of undesired by&#8208;products and exhibits high atom economy. The products we described in this perspective represent synthetic intermediate in numerous drug molecules and industrial chemical reagents and remarkably shows potential application in future.</dc:description>

         <title>Titanium&#8208;Oxo Clusters with Bi&#8208; and Tridentate Organic Ligands: Gradual Evolution of the Structures from Small to Big</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
How TOCs tick: Homometallic titanium oxo clusters are one of the most important groups of metal oxo clusters. Most of them are uncharged and are obtained by partial hydrolysis and condensation of titanium alkoxo derivatives. The cluster cores, ranging from 3 to &gt;50 titanium atoms, are stabilized by organic ligands. Apart from residual OR groups, carboxylato and phosphonato ligands are most frequent. The article critically reviews and categorizes the known structures and works out basic construction principles.







Abstract
Homometallic titanium oxo clusters are one of the most important groups of metal oxo clusters, with more than 300 examples characterized by X&#8208;ray structure analyses. Most of them are uncharged and are obtained by partial hydrolysis and condensation of titanium alkoxo derivatives. The cluster cores, ranging from 3 to &gt;50 titanium atoms, are stabilized by organic ligands. Apart from residual OR groups, carboxylato and phosphonato ligands are most frequent. The article critically reviews and categorizes the known structures and works out basic construction principles by comparing the different cluster types.

         <title>Factors Controlling the Aluminium(I)&#8208;meta&#8208;selective C&#8722;H Activation in Arenes</title>

         <dc:description>The so far poorly understood factors controlling the complete meta&#8208;selectivity observed in the C&#8722;H activation reactions of alkylarenes promoted by aluminyl anions have been explored in detail by means of Density Functional Theory calculations.

         <title>Calcination&#8208;Free Synthesis of Well&#8208;Dispersed and Sub&#8208;10 nm Spinel Ferrite Nanoparticles as High&#8208;Performance Anode Materials for Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries: A Case Study of CoFe2O4</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Spinel ferrites are promising anode materials for lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) owing to their high theoretical specific capacities. However, their practical application is impeded by inherent low conductivity and severe volume expansion, which can be surpassed by increasing surface&#8208;to&#8208;volume ratio of nanoparticles. Currently, most methods produce spinel ferrite nanoparticles with large size and severe aggregation, degrading their electrochemical performance. In this study, a low temperature aminolytic route was designed to synthesize sub&#8208;10 nm CoFe  2  O  4  nanoparticles with good dispersion through carefully exploiting the reaction of acetates and oleylamine. The performance of CoFe  2  O  4  nanoparticles obtained by traditional co&#8208;precipitation method was also investigated for comparison. This work demonstrates that CoFe  2  O  4  nanoparticles synthesized by the aminolytic route are promising as anode materials for LIBs. Besides, this method can be extended to design other spinel ferrites for energy storage devices with superior performance by simply changing the starting material, such as MnFe  2  O  4  , MgFe  2  O  4  , ZnFe  2  O  4  , and so on.</dc:description>

         <title>FeII Metallohelices Stabilize DNA G&#8208;Quadruplexes and Downregulate the Expression of G&#8208;Quadruplex&#8208;Regulated Oncogenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Holding on and holding down: DNA G&#8208;quadruplexes (G4s) represent attractive targets for cancer therapy. We show that metallohelices, which exhibit bioactivity emulating that of natural systems, bind with high affinity to G4 DNA and inhibit the activity of DNA polymerase by stabilizing G4 structures. Moreover, the investigated metallohelices downregulate the expression oncogenes in human embryonic kidney cells at the mRNA and protein levels, thus holding promise as potential multitarget drugs.







Abstract
DNA G&#8208;quadruplexes (G4s) have been identified within the promoter regions of many proto&#8208;oncogenes. Thus, G4s represent attractive targets for cancer therapy, and the design and development of new drugs as G4 binders is a very active field of medicinal chemistry. Here, molecular biophysics and biology methods were employed to investigate the interaction of chiral metallohelices with a series of four DNA G4s (hTelo, c&#8208;myc, c&#8208;kit1, c&#8208;kit2) that are formed by the human telomeric sequence (hTelo) and in the promoter regions of c&#8208;MYC and c&#8208;KIT proto&#8208;oncogenes. We show that the investigated water&#8208;compatible, optically pure metallohelices, which are made by self&#8208;assembly of simple nonpeptidic organic components around FeII ions and exhibit bioactivity emulating the natural systems, bind with high affinity to G4 DNA and much lower affinity to duplex DNA. Notably, both enantiomers of a metallohelix containing a m&#8208;xylenyl bridge (5&#8201;b) were found to effectively inhibit primer elongation catalyzed by Taq DNA polymerase by stabilizing G4 structures formed in the template strands containing c&#8208;myc and c&#8208;kit2 G4&#8208;forming sequences. Moreover, both enantiomers of 5&#8201;b downregulated the expression of c&#8208;MYC and c&#8208;KIT oncogenes in human embryonic kidney cells at mRNA and protein levels. As metallohelices also bind alternative nucleic acid structures, they hold promise as potential multitargeted drugs.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Holding on and holding down&lt;/b&gt;: DNA G-quadruplexes (G4s) represent attractive targets for cancer therapy. We show that metallohelices, which exhibit bioactivity emulating that of natural systems, bind with high affinity to G4 DNA and inhibit the activity of DNA polymerase by stabilizing G4 structures. Moreover, the investigated metallohelices downregulate the expression oncogenes in human embryonic kidney cells at the mRNA and protein levels, thus holding promise as potential multitarget drugs.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DNA G-quadruplexes (G4s) have been identified within the promoter regions of many proto-oncogenes. Thus, G4s represent attractive targets for cancer therapy, and the design and development of new drugs as G4 binders is a very active field of medicinal chemistry. Here, molecular biophysics and biology methods were employed to investigate the interaction of chiral metallohelices with a series of four DNA G4s (&lt;i&gt;hTelo&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;c-myc&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;c-kit1&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;c-kit2&lt;/i&gt;) that are formed by the human telomeric sequence (&lt;i&gt;hTelo&lt;/i&gt;) and in the promoter regions of &lt;i&gt;c-MYC&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;c-KIT&lt;/i&gt; proto-oncogenes. We show that the investigated water-compatible, optically pure metallohelices, which are made by self-assembly of simple nonpeptidic organic components around Fe&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt; ions and exhibit bioactivity emulating the natural systems, bind with high affinity to G4 DNA and much lower affinity to duplex DNA. Notably, both enantiomers of a metallohelix containing a &lt;i&gt;m&lt;/i&gt;-xylenyl bridge (&lt;b&gt;5&#8201;b&lt;/b&gt;) were found to effectively inhibit primer elongation catalyzed by &lt;i&gt;Taq&lt;/i&gt; DNA polymerase by stabilizing G4 structures formed in the template strands containing &lt;i&gt;c-myc&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;c-kit2&lt;/i&gt; G4-forming sequences. Moreover, both enantiomers of &lt;b&gt;5&#8201;b&lt;/b&gt; downregulated the expression of &lt;i&gt;c-MYC&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;c-KIT&lt;/i&gt; oncogenes in human embryonic kidney cells at mRNA and protein levels. As metallohelices also bind alternative nucleic acid structures, they hold promise as potential multitargeted drugs.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Recyclable Supramolecular Assembly&#8208;Induced Emission System for Selective Detection and Efficient Removal of Mercury(II)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A supramolecular functional system with appreciable photoluminescent properties on the basis of the supramolecular assembly&#8208;induced emission enhancement (SAIEE) mechanism is successfully constructed through host&#8208;guest interactions, which shows great potentials in simultaneously selective detection and efficient removal of Hg2+ from water owing to the formation of non&#8208;luminous ground state complexes. This system also possesses excellent regeneration ability without the loss of adsorption activity.







Abstract
An efficient strategy for simultaneously detecting and removing Hg2+ from water is vital to address mercury pollution. Herein a supramolecular assembly G&#8834;H with photoluminescent properties is facilely constructed through the self&#8208;assembly of a functional pillar[5]arene bearing two N,N&#8208;dimethyldithiocarbamoyl binding sites (H) and an AIE&#8208;active tetraphenylethene derivative (G). Remarkably, the fluorescence of G&#8834;H can be exclusively quenched by Hg2+ among the 30 cations due to the formation of non&#8208;luminous ground state complex and only L&#8208;cysteine can restore fluorescence in the common 20 amino acids. Meanwhile, the probe G&#8834;H has a considerable thermal and pH stability, a good anti&#8208;interference property from various cations, and a satisfactory sensitivity. More importantly, G&#8834;H exhibits a prominent capability of Hg2+ removal with rapid capture rate (within 1&#8197;h) and excellent adsorption efficiency (98&#8201;%), as well as a highly efficient recyclability without losing any adsorption activity.

         <title>Simple Synthetic Routes to Carbene&#8208;M&#8208;Amido (M=Cu, Ag, Au) Complexes for Luminescence and Photocatalysis Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
N&#8722;H metallation routes: Interest in carbene&#8208;metal&#8208;amido (CMA) complexes of the coinage metals has inspired comprehensive efforts towards simplifying their synthesis. We now showcase simple and sustainable routes to various CMAs, using mild conditions for the N&#8722;H metallation of carbazole and other amines. The action of a mild base is studied computationally and the photophysical properties of some new CMA complexes are examined.







Abstract
The development of novel and operationally simple synthetic routes to carbene&#8208;metal&#8208;amido (CMA) complexes of copper, silver and gold relevant for photonic applications are reported. A mild base and sustainable solvents allow all reactions to be conducted in air and at room temperature, leading to high yields of the targeted compounds even on multigram scales. The effect of various mild bases on the N&#8722;H metallation was studied in silico and experimentally, while a mechanochemical, solvent&#8208;free synthetic approach was also developed. Our photophysical studies on [M(NHC)(Cbz)] (Cbz=carbazolyl) indicate that the occurrence of fluorescent or phosphorescent states is determined primarily by the metal, providing control over the excited state properties. Consequently, we demonstrate the potential of the new CMAs beyond luminescence applications by employing a selected CMA as a photocatalyst. The exemplified synthetic ease is expected to accelerate the applications of CMAs in photocatalysis and materials chemistry.

         <title>Uncovering the Hidden Landscape of Tris(4&#8208;pyridyl) Ligands: Topological Complexity Derived from the Bridgehead</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The power to change: the new heavy main group metal tris(4&#8208;pyridyl) ligands E(4&#8208;py)3 (E=Sb, Bi) build into topologically complex MOFs with AgI, in which the bridgehead atom plays an important role in structure direction. The E(4&#8208;py)3 ligands can function as pyramidal or tetrahedral nodes, an ability that is modulated by the Lewis basicity (stereochemical activity) of the Group 15 element.







Abstract
Supramolecular main group chemistry is a developing field which parallels the conventional domain of metallo&#8208;organic chemistry. Little explored building blocks in this area are main group metal&#8208;based ligands which have the appropriate donor symmetry to build desired molecular or extended arrangements. Tris(pyridyl) main group ligands (E(py)3, E=main group metal) are potentially highly versatile building blocks since shifting the N&#8208;donor arms from the 2&#8208; to the 3&#8208;positions and 4&#8208;positions provides a very simple way of changing the ligand character from mononuclear/chelating to multidentate/metal&#8208;bridging. Here, the coordination behaviour of the first main group metal tris(4&#8208;pyridyl) ligands, E(4&#8208;py)3 (E=Sb, Bi, Ph&#8722;Sn) is explored, as well as their ability to build metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs). The complicated topology of these MOFs shows a marked influence on the counter anion and on the ability of the E(4&#8208;py)3 ligands to switch coordination mode, depending on the steric and donor character of the bridgehead. This structure&#8208;directing influence of the bridgehead provides a potential building strategy for future molecular and MOF design in this area.

A family of cyclic phosphine&#8208;disiloxane featuring peri&#8208;substituted naphthyl(Nap)/acenaphthyl(Ace) scaffolds has been prepared. This straightforward synthesis takes advantage of both ortho&#8208; and peri&#8208;substitution of Nap/Ace&#8208;substituted phosphine oxides. The synthetic method allows diversifying the polycyclic aromatic platform and the Si substituents. Despite some steric congestion, the P&#8208;atom remains reactive. In particular, Au(I) complex could be prepared. Surprisingly, the P&#8208;trivalent derivatives display unexpected luminescence in the green in solid&#8208;state.







Abstract
A family of cyclic phosphine&#8208;disiloxane featuring peri&#8208;substituted naphthyl(Nap)/acenaphthyl(Ace) scaffolds has been prepared and fully characterized including X&#8208;ray structure, which enables a detailed structural analysis. This straightforward synthesis takes advantage of both ortho&#8208; and peri&#8208;substitution of Nap/Ace&#8208;substituted phosphine oxides. The synthetic method allows diversifying the polycyclic aromatic platform (Nap and Ace) as well as the Si substituents (Me and Ph). Despite a strong steric congestion, the P&#8208;atom remains reactive toward oxidation or coordination. In particular, Au(I) complex could be prepared. All the compounds display absorption/luminescence in the UV&#8208;Vis range. Surprisingly, the P&#8208;trivalent derivatives display unexpected luminescence in the green in solid&#8208;state.

Opening up open&#8208;shell molecular systems: We investigated the influence of AuI&#8722;AuI (aurophilic) interactions on the properties of multispin molecular systems by using multinuclear&#8208;AuI complexes with two or three nitronyl nitroxide&#8208;2&#8208;ide radical anions. Among these complexes, the one in which an aurophilic interaction was observed by structural analysis showed characteristic spin&#8722;spin interactions, electrochemical properties, and a solvatochromic behavior.







Abstract
Multinuclear AuI complexes with two or three nitronyl nitroxide&#8208;2&#8208;ide radical anion and phosphine&#8208;ligand scaffolds, (NN&#8208;Au)2&#8208;1&#8201;o, (NN&#8208;Au)2&#8208;1&#8201;m, and (NN&#8208;Au)2&#8208;1&#8201;p, have been synthesized to investigate the influence of AuI&#8722;AuI (aurophilic) interactions on the properties of multispin molecular systems. The desired complexes were successfully prepared in moderate yields in a one&#8208;pot synthesis from the corresponding phosphine ligand, AuI source, parent NN, and sodium hydroxide. Among the prepared complexes, (NN&#8208;Au)2&#8208;1&#8201;o, in which an aurophilic interaction was clearly observed by crystal structure analysis, showed characteristic spin&#8722;spin interactions, electrochemical properties, and solvatochromic behavior. The results from theoretical calculations also suggested that the differences in properties between complex (NN&#8208;Au)2&#8208;1&#8201;o and the other complexes are due to intramolecular aurophilic interactions.

         <title>Versatile Reaction Pathways of 1,1,3,3,3&#8208;Pentafluoropropene at Rh(I) Complexes [Rh(E)(PEt3)3] (E=H, GePh3, Si(OEt)3, F, Cl): C&#8208;F versus C&#8208;H Bond Activation Steps</title>

Studies on the reactivity of 1,3,3,3&#8208;pentafluoropropene towards rhodium(I) complexes revealed versatile reaction pathways, such as coordination, C&#8722;F and C&#8722;H bond activation steps. Fluorido ligands play a key role for the reactivity pattern observed.







Abstract
The reaction of the rhodium(I) complexes [Rh(E)(PEt3)3] (E=GePh3 (1), H (6), F (7)) with 1,1,3,3,3&#8208;pentafluoropropene afforded the defluorinative germylation products Z/E&#8208;2&#8208;(triphenylgermyl)&#8208;1,3,3,3&#8208;tetrafluoropropene and the fluorido complex [Rh(F)(CF3CHCF2)(PEt3)2] (2) together with the fluorophosphorane E&#8208;(CF3)CH=CF(PFEt3). For [Rh(Si(OEt)3)(PEt3)3] (4) the coordination of the fluoroolefin was found to give [Rh{Si(OEt)3}(CF3CHCF2)(PEt3)2] (5). Two equivalents of complex 2 reacted further by C&#8722;F bond oxidative addition to yield [Rh(CF=CHCF3)(PEt3)2(&#956;&#8208;F)3Rh(CF3CHCF2)(PEt3)] (9). The role of the fluorido ligand on the reactivity of complex 2 was assessed by comparison with the analogous chlorido complex. The use of complexes 1, 4 and 6 as catalysts for the derivatization of 1,1,3,3,3&#8208;pentafluoropropene provided products, which were generated by hydrodefluorination, hydrometallation and germylation reactions.

         <title>Establishing a &#8220;Ring&#8208;Size&#8208;Divergent&#8221; Synthetic Strategy: Synthesis, Structural Revision, and Absolute Configuration of Feroniellins</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Running rings around ethers: A &#8220;ring&#8208;size&#8208;divergent&#8221; strategy enabled us to divergently synthesize the five&#8208;, six&#8208;, and seven&#8208;membered ether rings of feroniellin analogs from diepoxides under simple acidic or neutral conditions in only two steps from bergamottin. Additionally, the proposed structures of feroniellins A and B were revised, and the absolute configurations of all feroniellins were determined from their asymmetric synthesis.







Abstract
Feroniellin analogs isolated from Feroniella lucida possess a furanocoumarin skeleton connected to monoterpenic five&#8208; to seven&#8208;membered ethereal rings by an ether linkage and exhibit a broad spectrum of biological activities. In this contribution, we intended to establish a &#8220;ring&#8208;size&#8208;divergent&#8221; synthetic strategy for the monoterpenic five&#8208; to seven&#8208;membered ethereal rings through the chemical sythesis of feroniellins. The short and comprehensive synthesis of feroniellins was achieved in only two steps from easily available bergamottin based on the &#8220;ring&#8208;size&#8208;divergent&#8221; strategy. In addition, these syntheses resulted in revision of the proposed structures for feroniellins A and B and the determination of all the absolute configurations of feroniellins; their preliminary anti&#8208;inflammatory activities were investigated as well.

         <title>Silver&#8208;Free Au(I) Catalysis Enabled by Bifunctional Urea&#8208; and Squaramide&#8208;Phosphine Ligands via H&#8208;Bonding</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Gold(I) chloride complexes with bifunctional phosphino(thio)urea and phosphinosquaramide ligands have been designed to be catalytically active in the absence of silver additives in intra&#8208; and intermolecular reactions of alkynes. Structure&#8208;activity relationships, DFT calculations focused on the Au&#8722;Cl bond activation, and comprehensive kinetic studies highlight the key role of the H&#8208;bond donor group in enabling catalysis at the Au(I) center.







Abstract
A library of gold(I) chloride complexes with phosphine ligands incorporating pendant (thio)urea and squaramide H&#8208;bond donors was prepared with the aim of promoting chloride abstraction from Au(I) via H&#8208;bonding. In the absence of silver additives, complexes bearing squaramides and trifluoromethylated aromatic ureas displayed good catalytic activity in the cyclization of N&#8208;propargyl benzamides, as well as in a 1,6&#8208;enyne cycloisomerization, a tandem cyclization&#8208;indole addition reaction and the hydrohydrazination of phenylacetylene. Kinetic studies and DFT calculations indicate that the energetic span of the reaction is accounted by both the chloride abstraction step, facilitated by the bidentate H&#8208;bond donor via an associative mechanism, and the subsequent cyclization step.

         <title>Triangular Rhodamine Triads and Their Intrinsic Photophysics Revealed from Gas&#8208;Phase Ion Fluorescence Experiments</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Communication between ionic dyes: New triangular rhodamine triads were synthesized and spectroscopically characterized as isolated trications in the gas phase. Fluorescence spectra reveal efficient energy transfer from one dye (rhodamine 575) to another (rhodamine 640) despite of electrostatic screening by the &#960;&#8208;spacer. No spectral shift due to the internal Coulomb repulsion between the dyes was observed.







Abstract
When ionic dyes are close together, the internal Coulomb interaction may affect their photophysics and the energy&#8208;transfer efficiency. To explore this, we have prepared triangular architectures of three rhodamines connected to a central triethynylbenzene unit (1,3,5&#8208;tris(buta&#8208;1,3&#8208;diyn&#8208;1&#8208;yl)benzene) based on acetylenic coupling reactions and measured fluorescence spectra of the isolated, triply charged ions in vacuo. We find from comparisons with previously reported monomer and dimer spectra that while polarization of the &#960;&#8208;system causes redshifted emission, the separation between the rhodamines is too large for a Stark shift. This picture is supported by electrostatic calculations on model systems composed of three linear and polarizable ionic dyes in D3h configuration: The electric field that each dye experiences from the other two is too small to induce a dipole moment, both in the ground and the excited state. In the case of heterotrimers that contain either two rhodamine 575 (R575) and one R640 or one R575 and two R640, emission is almost purely from R640 although the polarization of the &#960;&#8208;system expectedly diminishes the dipole&#8208;dipole interaction.

         <title>Highly Efficient Trityl&#8208;nitroxide Biradicals for Biomolecular High&#8208;field Dynamic Nuclear Polarization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) is a powerful method to enhance the sensitivity of solid&#8208;state magnetic nuclear resonance (ssNMR) spectroscopy. However, its biomolecular applications at high magnetic fields (preferably &gt; 14 T) have so far been limited by the intrinsically low efficiency of polarizing agents and sample preparation aspects. Herein, we report a new class of trityl&#8208;nitroxide biradicals, dubbed SNAPols that combine high DNP efficiency with greatly enhanced hydrophilicity. SNAPol&#8208;1, the best compound in the series, shows DNP enhancement factors at 18.8 T of more than 100 in small molecules and globular proteins and also exhibits strong DNP enhancements in membrane proteins and cellular preparations. By integrating optimal sensitivity and high resolution, we expect widespread applications of this new polarizing agent in high&#8208;field DNP/ssNMR spectroscopy, especially for complex biomolecules.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The synthesis of 2,9&#8208;diaza&#8208;1,3,8,10&#8208;tetratriflato&#8208;dibenzoperylene (DDP 3a) and corresponding 2,9&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;1,3,8,10&#8208;tetratriflato&#8208;dibenzoperylene (DBP 3b) has been developed at multigram scale via reduction of one of the industrially most important high&#8208;performance dyes, perylene&#8208;3,4,9,10&#8208;tetracarboxylic diimide (PTCDI), and of corresponding dihydroxy peropyrenequinone precursor. The focus of this paper is on the reactivity pattern of 3a as key intermediate towards highly functionalized 2,9&#8208;diazadibenzopyrelenes (DDPs) obtained via catalytic substitution of four triflate by aryl, heteroaryl, alkynyl, aminyl, and O&#8208;phosphanyl substituents. The influence of electron&#8208;donating substituents (&#8208;OSiMe3, &#8208;OPtBu2, &#8208;N&#8208;piperidinyl), electron&#8208;withdrawing (OTf, 3,5&#8208;bis&#8208;trifluoromethyl&#8208;phenyl) and of electron&#8208;rich &#960;&#8208;conjugated (2&#8208;thienyl, 4&#8208;tert&#8208;butylphenyl, trimethylsilyl&#8208;ethynyl) substituents on optoelectronic and structural properties of these functionalized DDPs has been investigated via XRD analyses, UV&#8208;Vis, PL spectroscopy, and by electroanalytical CV. These results were correlated to results of DFT and TD&#8208;DFT calculations. Thus, functionalized DPPs with easily tunable HOMO and LUMO energies and gap became available via a new and reliable synthetic strategy starting from readily available PTCDI.</dc:description>

&#8220;In this work, we have employed the innovative supercritical water&#8208;based technology for synthesising high crystalline calcium silicate hydrate nanominerals, finely controlling the Si&#8208;OH and Ca&#8208;OH contents. A key result of this study relies on the observation, for the first time, of a transformation from an ordered &#8220;ice&#8208;like&#8221; water distribution in the Si&#8208;OH&#8208;rich model nanocrystal to a disordered &#8220;liquid&#8208;like&#8221; one in the Ca&#8208;OH&#8208;rich counterpart.&#8221; Read more about the story behind the cover in the Cover Profile and about the research itself on page&#8197;&#9642;&#9642;&#8197;ff.

         <dc:description>
&#8220;Porphyrinoid out&#8208;of&#8208;plane distortions have been in the focus of the group's research since our finding of a saddling mode being related to copper corrole non&#8208;innocence in 2007. Such modes could be quantified using J.&#8197;A. Shelnutts NSD method (normal&#8208;coordinate structure decomposition), but unfortunately the analysis was exclusive to metal porphyrins and metal chlorins. PorphyStruct is the result from our attempts to quantify these distortions for many different porphyrinoids with little effort, while retaining the established terminology.&#8221; Read more about the story behind the cover in the Cover Profile and about the research itself on page&#8197;&#9642;&#9642;&#8197;ff.

PorphyStruct is the result from our attempts to quantify these distortions for many different porphyrinoids with little effort, while retaining the established terminology&lt;/i&gt;.&#8221; Read more about the story behind the cover in the Cover Profile and about the research itself on page&#8197;&#9642;&#9642;&#8197;ff.

&#8220;We present an improved version of a rotaxane&#8208;based system in which unidirectional threading and dethreading of the molecular components can be carried out repeatedly under stationary optical excitation in solution. By performing the photoreaction in the probe of the NMR spectrometer, we were able to investigate the photoinduced non&#8208;equilibrium behavior of the system, and in particular distinguish between kinetically trapped and stationary dissipative regimes.&#8221; Read more about the story behind the cover in the Cover Profile and about the research itself on page&#8197;&#9642;&#9642;&#8197;ff.

         <title>Polymer Nanodiscs and their Bioanalytical Potential</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Membrane proteins (MPs) play a pivotal role in cellular function and are therefore predominant pharmaceutical targets. Although detailed understanding of MP structure and mechanistic activity is invaluable for rational drug design, challenges are associated with the purification and study of MPs. This review delves into historical developments preluding the currently available membrane mimetic technologies before shining a spotlight on polymer nanodiscs. These are soluble nanosized particles capable of encompassing MPs embedded in a phospholipid annular. The expanding range of reported amphipathic polymer nanodisc materials are presented and discussed in terms of their tolerance to different solution conditions and their nanodisc properties. Finally, the analytical scope of polymer nanodiscs is considered in both the demonstration of basic nanodisc parameters as well as in the elucidation of structures, lipid&#8208;protein interactions, and functional mechanisms of reconstituted membrane proteins. The final emphasis is given to the unique benefits and applications demonstrated for native nanodiscs accessed through a detergent free process.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Graphdiyne  (g&#8208;C  n  H  2n&#8208;2  ), as a novel two&#8208;dimension carbon allotrope material composed of sp&#8208; and sp  2  &#8208;hybrid carbon network, has been widely explored since it was synthesized for the first time by Li&#8217;s group in 2010. A series distinct and excellent properties bestow graphdiyne excellent performance in many fields  . Here, an innovative progress for preparing graphdiyne by using Cu  +  contained material as catalyst is reported and the composite CuI&#8208;GD is coupled with flower&#8208;like  NiAl&#8208;LDH  to produce H  2  from photocatalytic water splitting. The results of FTIR and Raman together reveal that graphdiyne nanosheets are synthesized successfully by employing cross&#8208;coupling method. Photocatalytic hydrogen evolution performance shows that the hydrogen production activity of  CuI&#8208;GD/NiAl&#8208;LDH  has a 15&#8208; and 216&#8208;fold enhancement compared with CuI&#8208;GD and NiAl&#8208;LDH, respectively. A series of characterizations are carried out to expound the underlying reasons in the enhancement of photocatalytic hydrogen production performance of CuI&#8208;GD/NiAl&#8208;LDH. Meanwhile, a possible mechanism for the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution process was proposed to insight understand the interaction among these materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Heterometallic d8&#8211;d10 Coupling of Rh(I) and M(0) (M=Pd, Pt) in a Sandwich Framework of &#960;&#8208;Conjugated Ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A sandwich framework of &#960;&#8208;conjugated unsaturated hydrocarbon ligands was found to provide a unique coordination environment that facilitates unusual coupling of d8 RhI and d10 M0 (M=Pd, Pt). The molecular orbital analysis showed that the electron&#8208;accepting ability of the sandwich framework through back&#8208;donation allows the formation of a d&#963;&#8208;type Rh&#8208;Pd bond in a (d&#8208;d)18 electron system. More information can be found in the Communication by S. Sakaki, T. Murahashi, et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202101133).

In different states: Molecular hexavalent group 8 nitrido fluorides feature different electronic ground&#8208;state d2 configurations in solid Ne matrices. While NFeF3 adopts a high symmetry structure, the heavier homologues are subject to symmetry lowering and spin&#8208;crossover caused by a pseudo Jahn&#8722;Teller effect &#8220;hidden&#8221; in the excited states. For NOsF3 two coexisting high&#8208; and low&#8208;spin structures show triplet&#8211;singlet spin crossover and magnetic bistability. A weakened covalent N&#8722;Fe bond in NFeVIF3 indicates the non&#8208;innocent character of the nitrido ligand.







Abstract
Pseudo&#8208;tetrahedral nitrido trifluorides N&#8801;MF3 (M=Fe, Ru, Os) and square pyramidal nitrido tetrafluorides N&#8801;MF4 (M=Ru, Os) were formed by free&#8208;metal&#8208;atom reactions with NF3 and subsequently isolated in solid neon at 5&#8197;K. Their IR spectra were recorded and analyzed aided by quantum&#8208;chemical calculations. For a d2 electron configuration of the N&#8801;MF3 compounds in C3v symmetry, Hund's rule predict a high&#8208;spin 3A2 ground state with two parallel spin electrons and two degenerate metal d(&#948;)&#8208;orbitals. The corresponding high&#8208;spin 3A2 ground state was, however, only found for N&#8801;FeF3, the first experimentally verified neutral nitrido FeVI species. The valence&#8208;isoelectronic N&#8801;RuF3 and N&#8801;OsF3 adopt different angular distorted singlet structures. For N&#8801;RuF3, the triplet 3A2 state is only 5&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1 higher in energy than the singlet 1A&#8242; ground state, and the magnetically bistable molecular N&#8801;OsF3 with two distorted near degenerate 1A&#8242; and 3A&#8220; electronic states were experimentally detected at 5&#8197;K in solid neon.

         <title>Spatiotemporal Resolved Live Cell Membrane Tracking through Photo&#8208;click Reactions Enriched in Lipid Phase</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A lipid phase mediated photo&#8208;click cycloaddition between photo&#8208;generated nitrile imines and energy&#8208;storable dibenzo[c,g][1,2]diazocine (DBDA) was established, including optimized biocompatibility and highly spatiotemporal resolution as well. A supramolecular assembly of the photo&#8208;switchable DBDA monopeptides was also exploited to implant the DBDA moiety on live cell membranes for studying their dynamics via the photo&#8208;click reaction by using digital micromirror device (DMD) chip.







Abstract
A set of photo&#8208;switchable monopeptides derived from cis&#8208;&#946;&#8208;dibenzodiazocine&#8208;l&#8208;alanine (cis&#8208;DBDAA) have been designed and synthesized, which are capable of photo&#8208;click reacting with diaryltetrazoles or diarylsydnones in a hydrophobic phospholipid bilayer environment. The DBDAA monopeptides include both a hydrophobic tail on C&#8208;terminal, providing high affinity toward lipid membrane, and a modularized functional moiety on N&#8208;terminal, enabling rapid optimization of the self&#8208;assembly strength to form multifunctional supramolecules. With the cis&#8208;DBDAA monopeptides photo&#8208;switched into trans&#8208;configuration, we were able to disrupt the supramolecular assembly through an efficient photo&#8208;click reaction across the lipid bilayer of liposomes. We reveal that the performance of the photo&#8208;click reactions between the monopeptides and photo&#8208;generated nitrile imine intermediates is significantly enhanced by enrichment of both reactants in the hydrophobic membrane lamel of liposomes. Enrichment of the DBDAA monopeptide in lipid phase serves as a convenient method to introduce bioorthogonal chemical handles on live cell membranes, which enables fluorescence labelling of single cell's membrane with high spatiotemporal resolution to facilitate the studies on cell membrane dynamics.

         <title>Upgrading Octane Number of Naphtha by a Robust and Easily Attainable Metal&#8208;Organic Framework through Selective Molecular Sieving of Alkane Isomers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The separation of alkanes, particularly monobranched and dibranched isomers, is of paramount importance in petrochemical industry for optimizing the feedstock of ethylene production as well as for upgrading the octane number of gasoline. Here we report the full separation of linear/monobranched alkanes from their dibranched isomers by a robust and easily scalable metal&#8208;organic framework material, Co3(HCOO)6. The compound completely excludes dibranched alkanes but adsorbs their linear and monobranched isomers, as evidenced by single&#8208;component and multicomponent adsorption measurements. More importantly, the material exhibits excellent performance in separating naphtha and is capable of providing high quality feedstock for the production of ethylene and gasoline components with high octane number, making it a promising candidate for naphtha separation in petrochemical industry.</dc:description>

         <title>Artificial Supramolecular Pumps Powered by Light</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Light&#8208;driven supramolecular pumping was achieved, as a result of unidirectional threading and dethreading movements, by combining photoisomerization and self&#8208;assembly processes in a closed reaction network (represented by reservoirs and pipes in the cover image). While light irradiation (bulb and gears) pushes the species energetically uphill, subsequent exergonic reactions (falling water) convert energy into motion, and a continuous and directional transfer along the cycle (the water flow) is observed at the photostationary state.

         <title>Catalytic Asymmetric Synthesis of Benzobicyclo[3.2.1]octanes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lawsone is naturally obtained from Henna plant leaves (as shown in the cover image), which are responsible for the red&#8208;orange pigment properties. It is well known in the cosmetic industry as a natural coloring agent for hair, nails, and skin. Over the centuries, lawsone has been frequently used as a natural beauty product, but the pharmaceutical applications of lawsone and its analogs are still underexplored. To fulfill these shortcomings, we started utilizing lawsone as a synthon for a new class of cascade reactions to synthesize structurally complex molecules, which are analogues of biologically and pharmaceutically active molecules. We sincerely thank Dr. M. A. Pasha for the excellent design of the cover. More information can be found in the Communication by D.&#8197;B. Ramachary et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202100985).

         <title>PorphyStruct: A Digital Tool for the Quantitative Assignment of Non&#8208;Planar Distortion Modes in Four&#8208;Membered Porphyrinoids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
PorphyStruct is a new digital tool that allows quick and easy analyses of hidden conformational features of porphyrinoids from structural data. The software introduces the well&#8208;established technique of normal&#8208;mode structural decomposition (NSD) to porphyrinoids like the corroles, and while retaining the terminology of the NSD method, it is flexible with respect to the size and shape of the macrocycle perimeter. The cover image shows the utopia of a futuristic analysis laboratory where life&#8208;size molecules are analysed for such hidden structural characteristics. More information can be found in the Full Paper by J.&#8197;Krumsieck and M.&#8197;Br&#246;ring. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202101243).

         <title>Rationalizing the Mechanism of Peroxyformate Decomposition: Computational Insights To Understand Solvent Influence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Solvent effects revealed: An exhaustive mechanistic investigation into the decomposition of tert&#8208;butyl peroxyformate based on DFT calculations sheds light on how the reaction proceeds and how it is modulated depending on the nature and polarity of the surrounding medium. The computed mechanistic pathways are in excellent agreement with the experimental trends for a variety of polar and nonpolar solvents.







Abstract
The heterolytic decomposition of tert&#8208;butyl peroxyformate to tert&#8208;butanol and carbon dioxide, catalyzed by pyridine, is a long&#8208;known example of a reaction whose kinetics are strongly affected by solvent polarity. From DFT and ab initio methods together with the SMD implicit solvation model, an extension on the formerly accepted mechanism is proposed. This novel proposal involves the formation of a carbonic acid ester intermediate and its further decomposition, through an unreported pyridine&#8208;mediated stepwise route. Computed barriers for this mechanism at DLPNO/CCSD(T)&#8208;def2&#8208;TZVP are in excellent agreement with experimental kinetic data across different solvents. Furthermore, the strong relationships between activation energies, geometric parameters in the transition state and the characteristics of the different solvents are also analyzed in depth.

         <title>Correlation between the Dynamics of Nanoconfined Water and the Local Chemical Environment in Calcium Silicate Hydrate Nanominerals</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ultra&#8208;fast synthesis of calcium silicate hydrates was performed in supercritical water that acts as a solvent for mimicking the natural conditions at high pressure and high temperature of the geological process. The synthesised xonotlite and tobermorite represent perfect Ca&#8722;OH&#8208;rich and Si&#8722;OH&#8208;rich model nanocrystals for investigating the effect of different chemical environments on the dynamics of confined water. These results could be applied to other water&#8208;containing construction materials. More information can be found in the Full Paper by J.&#8197;S. Dolado, C. Aymonier et&#8197;al.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A silyl hydride derivative of d&#8208;glucal was used conveniently as a bench&#8208;stable precursor for the construction of C&#8208;glycosidic bond. After activation by fluoride&#8208;mediated dehydrogenative hydrolysis, an intermediate silanol species was used for Hiyama arylation. Various aryl and heteroaryl C&#8208;glycosides, C&#8208;glycopeptides, as well as both a&#8208; and b&#8208;isomers of Dapagliflozin could be constructed rapidly and without the need for protecting groups.

         <title>Low concentration C2H6 capture enabled by size matching in the ultramicropore</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Low concentration ethane capture is crucial for environmental protection and natural gas purification. The ideal physisorbent with strong C 2 H 6 interaction and large C 2 H 6 uptake at low&#8208;concentration level has rarely been reported, due to the large p K a value and small quadrupole moment of C 2 H 6 . Herein, we demonstrate the perfectly size matching between the ultramicropore (pore size of 4.6 &#197;) and ethane (kinetic diameter of 4.4 &#197;) in a nickel pyridine&#8208;4&#8208;carboxylate metal&#8208;organic framework ( PC&#8208;4&#8208;Ni ), which enables the record&#8208;breaking performance for low concentration C 2 H 6 capture. PC&#8208;4&#8208;Ni exhibits the large C 2 H 6 adsorption enthalpy of 56.7 kJ/mol, and record&#8208;high C 2 H 6 uptake at low pressure of 0.01&#8208;0.1 bar and 298 K (1.8 mmol/g at 0.01 bar). Molecule simulations and C 2 H 6 &#8208;loading crystal structure analysis revealed that the maximized interaction sites in PC&#8208;4&#8208;Ni with ethane molecule originates the strong C 2 H 6 adsorption. The dynamic breakthrough experiments for gas mixtures of C 2 H 6 /N 2 (1/999, v / v ) and C 2 H 6 /CH 4 (5/95, v / v ) proved the excellent low&#8208;concentration C 2 H 6 capture performance.</dc:description>

         <title>Controlling Site&#8208;Directed RNA Editing by Chemically Induced Dimerization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Various RNA&#8208;targeting approaches have been engineered to modify specific sites on endogenous transcripts, breaking new ground for a variety of basic research tools and promising clinical applications in the future. Here, we combine site&#8208;directed adenosine&#8208;to&#8208;inosine RNA editing with chemically induced dimerization. Specifically, we achieve tight and dose&#8208;dependent control of the editing reaction with gibberellic acid, and obtain editing yields up to 20 % and 44 % in the endogenous STAT1 and GAPDH transcript in cell culture.

         <title>Germyliumylidene: A Versatile Low Valent Group 14 Catalyst</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Bis&#8208;NHC stabilized germyliumylidenes [RGe(NHC)2]+ are typically Lewis basic (LB) in nature, owing to their lone pair and coordination of two NHCs to the vacant p&#8208;orbitals of the germanium atom. However, they can also show Lewis acidity (LA) via Ge&#8208;CNHC&#963;* orbital. Utilizing this unique electronic feature, we report the first example of bis&#8208;NHC&#8208;stabilized germyliumylidene [MesTerGe(NHC)2]Cl (1), (MesTer= 2,6&#8208;(2,4,6&#8208;Me3C6H2)2C6H3; NHC= IMe4 = 1,3,4,5&#8208;tetramethylimidazol&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene) catalyzed reduction of CO2 with amines and silane, which proceeds via its Lewis basic nature. In contrast, the Lewis acid nature of 1 is utilized in the catalyzed hydroboration and cyanosilylation of carbonyls. Thus, highlighting the versatile ambiphilic nature of bis&#8208;NHC stabilized germyliumylidenes.</dc:description>

         <title>Modulating by molecular design the enantiodiscrimination features of inherently chiral selectors: a HPLC and voltammetry study case with atropisomeric 2,2&#8217;&#8208; biindole based monomers and oligomer films</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A new family of inherently chiral electroactive selectors based on the 2,2&#8217;&#8208;biindole atropisomeric scaffold, of easy synthesis and modulable functional properties, is introduced and studied in cascade in two enantioselection contests. They are at first investigated as probes in enantioselective HPLC, studying molecular structure and temperature effects, and achieving very efficient semipreparative enantioseparation. The enantiomers thus obtained, of remarkable chiroptical features (optical rotation as well as circular dichroism), are successfully applied as selectors in chiral voltammetry in different media for discrimination of the enantiomers of chiral electroactive probes, either by conversion into enantiopure electroactive electrode surfaces by electrooligomerization on glassy carbon substrate (the two monomers with shorter alkyl chains), or as chiral additive in achiral ionic liquid (the monomer with longest alkyl chains). Discrimination is conveniently and reproducibly achieved in terms of significant potential differences for the two enantiomers, specularly inverting either probe or selector configuration. In one case successful discrimination is also observed with the two probe enantiomers concurrently present, either as racemate or with enantiomeric excesses, neatly accounted for by the peak current ratios.</dc:description>

         <title>Chiral Resolution of Spin&#8208;Crossover Active Iron(II) [2x2] Grid Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chiral magnetic materials are proposed for applications in second&#8208;order non&#8208;linear optics, magneto&#8208;chiral dichroism, among others. Recently, we have reported a set of tetra&#8208;nuclear Fe(II) grid complex conformers with general formula C/S&#8208;[Fe  4  L  4  ]  8+  (L: 2,6&#8208;bis(6&#8208;(pyrazol&#8208;1&#8208;yl)pyridin&#8208;2&#8208;yl)&#8208;1,5&#8208;dihydrobenzo[1,2&#8208;d:4,5&#8208;d']diimidazole). In the grid complexes, isomerism emerges from tautomerism and conformational isomerism of the ligand L, and the S&#8208;type grid complex is chiral, which originates from different non&#8208;centrosymmetric spatial organization of the trans type ligand around the Fe(II) center. However, the selective preparation of an enantiomerically pure grid complex in a controlled manner is difficult due to spontaneous self&#8208;assembly. To achieve the pre&#8208;synthesis programmable resolution of Fe(II) grid complexes, we designed and synthesized two novel intrinsically chiral ligands by appending chiral moieties to the parent ligand. The complexation of these chiral ligands with Fe(II) salt resulted in the formation of enantiomerically pure Fe(II) grid complexes, as unambiguously elucidated by CD and XRD studies. The enantiomeric complexes exhibited similar gradual and half&#8208;complete thermal and photo&#8208;induced SCO characteristics. The good agreement between the experimentally obtained and calculated CD spectra further supports the enantiomeric purity of the complexes and even the magnetic studies. The chiral resolution of Fe(II)&#8208; [2x2] grid complexes reported in this study, for the first time, might enable the fabrication of magneto&#8208;chiral molecular devices.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>A Zr&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic polyhedra (MOP) was self&#8208;assembled in a porous MOF host, DUT&#8208;68, successively to synthesize MOP&#8208;1@DUT&#8208;68. The MOP guest (MOP&#8208;1) has the size of  ca.  20 &#197; (diameter), lager than that of the square windows (pore sizes of &#8764;14 &#197;) of DUT&#8208;68 but smaller than that of the rhombicuboctahedral cage (27.7 &#197;), which makes that the migration and leaching of MOP&#8208;1 could be effectively prohibited if MOP&#8208;1 is encapsulated in the MOFs&#8217; cavities. The incorporation of MOP&#8208;1 makes the proton conductivity of MOP&#8208;1@DUT&#8208;68 reach 1.14 &#215; 10  &#8208;3  S cm  &#8208;1  (at 80&#176;C under 98% RH), which is three orders of magnitude higher than that of DUT&#8208;68. Compared with MOP&#8208;1&#204;DUT&#8208;68 which was synthesized by impregnation, MOP&#8208;1@DUT&#8208;68 are more prone to form faster proton&#8208;conduction pathways and thus provides higher proton conductivity.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Rechargeable magnesium battery attracts lots of attention because of its high safety and low cost compared to lithium battery, and it is needed to develop more efficient electrode materials. Although MgMn  2  O  4  is a promising material for the positive electrode in Mg rechargeable batteries, it usually exhibits poor cyclability. To improve the electrochemical behavior, we have prepared nanoparticles of MgMn  2&#8208;y  Fe  y  O  4  . The XRD results have confirmed that when Mn  3+  (Jahn&#8208;Teller ion) ions are replaced by Fe  3+  (non Jahn&#8208;Teller ion), the resulting MgMn  2&#8208;y  Fe  y  O  4  is a cubic phase. The structure and theoretical voltage are theoretically calculated by using the DFT method. The obtained samples have been chemically treated in acid solution for partial demagnesiation, and it is observed that the presence of iron inhibits the deinsertion of Mg through disproportionation and favors the exchange reaction. The electrochemical behavior in non&#8208;aqueous magnesium cells has been explored.</dc:description>

         <title>Remodeling of the Fibrillation Pathway of &#945;&#8208;Synuclein by Interaction with Antimicrobial Peptide LL&#8208;III</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation (LLPS) has emerged as a key mechanism for intracellular organization, and many recent studies have provided important insights into the role of LLPS in cell biology. There is also evidence that LLPS is associated with a variety of medical conditions, including neurodegenerative disorders. Pathological aggregation of &#945;&#8208;synuclein, which is causally linked to Parkinson&#8217;s disease, can proceed via droplet condensation, which then gradually transitions to the amyloid state. We show that the antimicrobial peptide LL&#8208;III is able to interact with both monomers and condensates of a&#8208;synuclein, leading to stabilization of the droplet and preventing conversion to the fibrillar state. The anti&#8208;aggregation activity of LL&#8208;III was also confirmed in a cellular model. We anticipate that studying the interaction of antimicrobial&#8208;type peptides with liquid condensates such as a&#8208;synuclein will contribute to the understanding of disease mechanisms (that arise in such condensates) and may also open up exciting new avenues for intervention.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) has emerged as a key mechanism for intracellular organization, and many recent studies have provided important insights into the role of LLPS in cell biology. There is also evidence that LLPS is associated with a variety of medical conditions, including neurodegenerative disorders. Pathological aggregation of &#945;-synuclein, which is causally linked to Parkinson&#8217;s disease, can proceed via droplet condensation, which then gradually transitions to the amyloid state. We show that the antimicrobial peptide LL-III is able to interact with both monomers and condensates of a-synuclein, leading to stabilization of the droplet and preventing conversion to the fibrillar state. The anti-aggregation activity of LL-III was also confirmed in a cellular model. We anticipate that studying the interaction of antimicrobial-type peptides with liquid condensates such as a-synuclein will contribute to the understanding of disease mechanisms (that arise in such condensates) and may also open up exciting new avenues for intervention.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Application of the Redox&#8208;Transmetallation Procedure to Access Divalent Lanthanide and Alkaline&#8208;Earth NHC Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Divalent lanthanide and alkaline&#8208;earth complexes supported by  N  &#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) ligands have been accessed by redox&#8208;transmetallation between air&#8208;stable NHC&#8211;AgI complexes and the corresponding metals. Using the small ligand 1,3&#8208;dimethylimidazol&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene (IMe), two series of isostructural complexes were obtained: the tetra&#8208;NHC complexes [LnI  2  (IMe)  4  ] (Ln = Eu and Sm) and the bis&#8208;NHC complexes [MI  2  (IMe)  2  (THF)  2  ] (M = Yb, Ca and Sr). In the former, distortions in NHC coordination were found to originate from intermolecular repulsions in the solid state. Application of the redox&#8208;transmetallation strategy with the bulkier 1,3&#8208;dimesitylimidazol&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene (IMes) ligand yielded [SrI  2  (IMes)(THF)  3  ] while using a similar procedure with Ca metal led to [CaI  2  (THF)  4  ] and uncoordinated IMes. DFT calculations were performed to rationalise the selective formation of the bis&#8208;NHC adduct in [SrI  2  (IMe)  2  (THF)  2  ] and the tetra&#8208;NHC adduct in [SmI  2  (IMe)  4  ]. Since the results in the gas phase point towards preferential formation of the tetra&#8208;NHC complexes for both metal centres, the differences between both complexes are a result of solid&#8208;state effects such as slightly different packing forces.</dc:description>

         <title>Infrared Responsive Choline Phosphate Lipids for Cancer Synergistic Therapy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Choline phosphate lipids have been designed and developed as new generation zwitterionic nanocarriers with excellent biocompatibility and bioorthogonality to provide more programmable performance for cancer therapy. However, there is a lack of spatiotemporal and reversible control for drug release at target tumor cells, which may lead to severe adverse effects to normal tissue and discounted treatment outcome. Here, we developed a light&#8208;inducible Lip&#8208;cRGDfk/ICG/Dox liposomes for synergistic cancer therapy. ICG can effectively convert light energy into achieve selective heating in a local environment upon laser irradiation, thus to induce the thermal ablation of tumor cells, and further reversibly trigger the spatiotemporal release of anticancer drugs (Dox) at tumor cells due to the conformation transformation of CP lipids to synergistically kill tumor cells. We also demonstrate the Lip&#8208;cRGDfk/ICG/Dox exhibited significant improvement for breast cancer therapy in vitro and in vivo, which can serve as an efficient platform to noninvasively and spatiotemporally control cytotoxicity activation at tumor cells for precision cancer therapy.</dc:description>

         <title>Bulky Barbiturates as Non&#8208;toxic Ionic Dye Insulators for Enhanced Emission in Polymeric Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Bulky hydrophobic counterions (weakly coordinating anions) can insulate ionic dyes against aggregation&#8208;caused quenching (ACQ) and enable preparation of highly fluorescent dye&#8208;loaded nanoparticles (NPs) for bioimaging, biosensing and light harvesting. Here, we introduce a family of hydrophobic anions based on fluorinated C &#8208;acyl barbiturates with delocalized negative charge and bulky non&#8208;polar groups. Similarly to fluorinated tetraphenylborates, these barbiturates prevent ACQ of cationic dye alkyl rhodamine B inside polymer NPs made of biodegradable poly(lactic&#8208;co&#8208;glycolic acid) (PLGA). Their efficiency to prevent ACQ increases for analogues with higher acidity and bulkiness. Their structure controls dye&#8208;dye communication, yielding bright NPs with on/off switching or stable emission. They enhance dye encapsulation inside NPs, allowing intracellular imaging without dye leakage. Compared to fluorinated tetraphenylborates known as cytotoxic transmembrane ion transporters, the barbiturates display a significantly lower cytotoxicity. These chemically available and versatile barbiturate derivatives are promising counterion scaffolds for preparation of bright non&#8208;toxic fluorescent nanomaterials.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Abstract: Abstract

A room temperature, visible&#8208;light&#8208;promoted and redox neutral direct C&#8208;H amination of glycine and peptides has been firstly accomplished by using  N  &#8208;acyloxyphthalimide or &#8208;succinimide as nitrogen&#8208;radical precursor. The present strategy provides ways to introduce functionalities such as  N  &#8208;acyloxyphthalimide or &#8208;succinimide specifically to terminal glycine segment of peptides. Herein, mild conditions and high functional&#8208;group tolerance allow the preparation of non&#8208;natural &#945;&#8208;amino acids and modification of corresponding peptides in this way.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>This article describes the application of  N  &#8208;heterocyclic iod(az)olium salts (NHISs) as highly reactive organocatalysts. A variety of mono&#8208; and dicationic NHISs are described and utilized as potent XB&#8208;donors in halogen&#8208;bond catalysis. They were benchmarked in seven diverse test reactions in which the activation of carbon&#8208; and metal&#8208;chloride bonds as well as carbonyl and nitro groups was achieved.  N  &#8208;Methylated dicationic NHISs rendered the highest reactivity in all investigated catalytic applications with reactivities even higher than all previously described monodentate XB&#8208;donors based on iodine(I) and (III) and the strong Lewis acid BF  3  .</dc:description>

         <title>Glycol Chitosan Functionalized with a Gd(III) Chelate as a Redox&#8208;responsive Magnetic Resonance Imaging Probe to Label Cell Embedding Alginate Capsules</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>One possibility for the non&#8208;invasive imaging of encapsulated cell grafts is to label the lumen of cell embedding capsules with a redox&#8208;responsive probe, as an increased extracellular reducing potential can be considered as a marker of hypoxia&#8208;induced necrosis. A Gd(III)&#8208;HPDO3A&#8208;like chelate has been conjugated to glycol&#8208;chitosan through a redox&#8208;responsive disulphide bond to obtain a contrast agent for Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). Such a compound can be interspersed with fibroblasts within the lumen of alginate&#8208;chitosan capsules. Increasing reducing conditions within the extracellular microenvironment lead to the reductive cleavage of the disulphide bond and to the release of gadolinium in the form of a low molecular weight, non&#8208;ionic chelate. The efflux of such chelate from capsules is readily detected by a decrease of contrast enhancement in T  1  &#8208;weighted MR images.</dc:description>

         <title>"Zn bridge" Effect Toward Consecutively Tunable Retention Characteristic For Volatile Random Access Memory</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polyimide memory materials with D&#8208;A structure based on charge transfer mechanism exhibit great potential for next generation of information storage technology due to its outstanding high&#8208;temperature resistance, well dimensional and chemical stability. It is one of core challenges in this field to precisely control memory performance by limited chemical decoration. Most of reported work mainly focus on designing novel and elaborate electron donors or acceptors for expected memory behaviour of polyimides, which take a lot of time and is not always efficacious. Herein, we reported a series of porphyrinated copolyimides coPI&#8208;Znx (x=5, 10, 20, 50, 80), where x represents the mole percentage of Zn ion in central core of porphyrin. Experimental and theoretical analysis indicate that the Zn ion could play a vital bridge role in promoting the formation and stabilization of charge transfer complex by enhancing the hybridization of local and charge transfer (HLCT) excitations of porphyrinated polyimides, endowing coPI&#8208;Znx with volatile random access memory performance and continuously tunable retention time. This work could provide one simple strategy to precisely regulate memory performance via only altering the metal content in porphyrinated polyimides</dc:description>

         <title>Engineered cyclotides with potent broad in vitro and in vivo antimicrobial activity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The search for novel antimicrobial agents to combat microbial pathogens is intensifying in response to bioterrorism and rapid drug resistance development to current antibiotic therapeutics. Respiratory failure and septicemia are the leading causes of mortality among hospitalized patients. Here, we report the development of a novel engineered cyclotide with effective broad&#8208;spectrum antibacterial activity against several ESKAPE bacterial strains and clinical isolates. The most active antibacterial cyclotide was extremely stable in serum, showed little hemolytic activity and provided protection in vivo in a murine model of P. aeruginosa peritonitis. These results highlight the potential of the cyclotide scaffold for the development of novel antimicrobial therapeutic leads for the treatment of bacteremia.</dc:description>

         <title>Direct Visualization of Substitutional Li Doping in Supported Pt Nanoparticles and Their Ultra&#8208;selective Catalytic Hydrogenation Performance</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>It has only recently been established that doping light elements (lithium, boron, and carbon) into supported transition metals can fill interstitial sites, which can be observed by the expanded unit cell. As an example, interstitial lithium (intLi) can block H filling octahedral interstices of palladium metal lattice, which improves partial hydrogenation of alkynes to alkenes under hydrogen. In contrast, herein, we report intLi is not found in the case of Pt/C. Instead, we observe for the first time a direct &#8216;substitution&#8217; of Pt with substitutional lithium (subLi) in alternating atomic columns using scanning transmission electron microscopy&#8208;annular dark field (STEM&#8208;ADF). This ordered substitutional doping results in a contraction of the unit cell as shown by high&#8208;quality synchrotron X&#8208;ray diffraction (SXRD). The electron donation of d&#8208;band of Pt without higher orbital hybridizations by subLi offers an alternative way for ultra&#8208;selectivity in catalytic hydrogenation of carbonyl compounds by suppressing the facile CO bond breakage that would form alcohols.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>A rhodium(III)&#8208;catalyzed C6&#8208;selective dehydrogenative cross&#8208;coupling of 2&#8208;pyridones with thiophenes was developed for the synthesis of 6&#8208;thiophenyl pyridin&#8208;2(1  H  )&#8208;one derivatives. In this reaction, the excellent site selectivity was controlled by the 2&#8208;pyridyl directing group on the nitrogen of the pyridone ring. Control experiments indicated that the  N  &#8208;pyridyl was essential for the transformation. To the best of our knowledge, this procedure is the first successful example on the direct C&#8208;6 heteroarylation of 2&#8208;pyridones with electron rich thiophene derivatives. 4&#8208;Pyridone was also used as substrate to generate the corresponding C2 heteroarylated product. Moreover, this pyridyl directing group was readily removable to generate the biheteroaryl structures with a free N&#8208;H group.</dc:description>

         <title>Photo&#8208;Initiated Cobalt Catalyzed Radical Olefin Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Outer&#8208;sphere radical hydrogenation of olefins proceeds via stepwise hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) from transition metal hydride species to the substrate. Typical catalysts exhibit M&#8211;H bonds that are either too weak to efficiently activate H  2  &#160;or too strong to reduce unactivated olefins. This contribution evaluates an alternative approach, that starts from a square&#8208;planar cobalt(II) hydride complex. Photoactivation results in Co&#8211;H bond homolysis. The three&#8208;coordinate cobalt(I) photoproduct binds H  2  &#160;to give a dihydrogen complex, which is a strong hydrogen atom donor, enabling the stepwise hydrogenation of both styrenes and unactivated aliphatic olefins with H  2  &#160;via HAT.</dc:description>

         <title>Mapping the Electronic Structure and the Reactivity Trends for Stabilized &#945;&#8208;Boryl Carbanions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The chemistry of stabilized &#945;&#8208;boryl carbanions show a remarkable diversity, and can enable many different synthetic routes towards efficient C&#8208;C bond formation. The electron&#8208;deficient, trivalent boron center stabilizes the carbanion facilitating its generation and tunning its reactivity. Here, we describe the electronic structure and the reactivity trends of a large dataset of &#945;&#8208;boryl carbanions. We use DFT&#8208;derived parameters for capturing their electronic and steric properties, computational reactivity towards model substrates, and crystallographic analysis within the Cambridge Structural Dataset. This study maps the reactivity space by systematically varying the nature of the boryl moiety, the substituents of the carbanionic carbon, the number of &#945;&#8208;boryl motifs, and the metal counteraction. In general, the free carbanionic intermediates are described as borata&#8208;alkene species with C&#8208;B &#960; interaction polarized towards the carbon. Furthermore, we can classify the &#945;&#8208;boryl alkylidene metal precursors into three classes directly related to their reactivity: 1) nucleophilic borata&#8208;alkene salts with alkali and alkali&#8208;earth metals, 2) nucleophilic &#951;  2  &#8208;(C&#8208;B) borata&#8208;alkene complexes with early transition metals, Cu and Ag, and 3) &#945;&#8208;boryl alkyl complexes with late transition metals. This trend map aids the selection of the appropriate reactive synthon depending on the sought reactivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Fine Tunable, Redox Active Octapalladium Chains Supported by Linear Tetraphosphines, Leading to Dynamically 1D Self&#8208;Assembled Coordination Polymers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A family of Pd8 chains supported by meso&#8208;Ph2PCH2P(Ph)CH2P(Ph)CH2PPh2 (dpmppm), [Pd8(meso&#8208;dpmppm)4(L)2](BF4)4 (L = none (1), solvents (2), RNC (3)) and [Pd8(meso&#8208;dpmppm)4(X)2]&#173;(BF4)2 (4), were systematically synthesized by using 2a (L = CH3CN) as a good precursor. DFT calculations with and without empirically calculating dispersion force stabilization energy (D3) indicated that the formation energy of Pd8 chain from two Pd4 fragments is assumed to involve mainly noncovalent interactions with four sets of interligand C&#8211;H/p interactions and Pd&#8729;&#8729;&#8729;Pd metallophilic one, while electron shared delocalized covalent interactions are almost canceled out within the Pd8 chain. The structures and electronic states of the Pd8 chains are found finely tunable by varying the terminal capping ligands, which are evidenced by the relationships between the NIR absorption energy and the distances of the central Pd&#8211;Pd junction. The isocyanide terminated Pd8 complexes (3) further reacted with excess of RNC to afford the Pd4 complexes, [Pd4(meso&#8208;dpmppm)2(RNC)2]2+ (13), and their cyclic voltammograms demonstrated wide range redox behaviors from 2{Pd4}4+ to 2{Pd4}0 through 2{Pd4}2+ &#8596; {Pd8}4+, {Pd8}3+, and {Pd8}2+ strings. Reactions of 2a with 1 eq. of aromatic linear bisisocyanide (BI) in CH2Cl2 deposited insoluble coordination polymers, {[Pd8(meso&#8208;dpmppm)4(BI)](BF4)4}n (5), and interestingly, they were soluble in acetonitrile, DOSY NMR spectra and SAXS curves suggesting that the coordination polymers exist as dynamically 1D self&#8208;assembled coordination polymers comprising ca. 50 units of the Pd8 rod.</dc:description>

         <title>Structural Transformation of Surface&#8208;Confined Porphyrin Networks by Addition of Co atoms</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The self&#8208;assembly of a nickel&#8208;porphyrin derivative (Ni&#8208;DPPyP) containing two pyridyl coordinating sites and two pentyl chains at trans  meso  positions was studied with scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and low energy electron diffraction (LEED) on Au(111). Deposition of Ni&#8208;DPPyP onto Au(111) gave rise to a close&#8208;packed network for coverages smaller or equal to one monolayer as revealed by STM and LEED. The molecular arrangement of this two&#8208;dimensional network is stabilized via hydrogen bonds formed between the pyridyl&#8217;s nitrogen and hydrogen atoms from the pyrrole groups of neighboring molecules. Subsequent deposition of cobalt atoms onto the close&#8208;packed network and post&#8208;deposition annealing at 423 K led to the formation of a Co&#8208;coordinated hexagonal porous network. As confirmed by XPS measurements, the porous network is stabilized by metal&#8208;ligand interactions between one cobalt atom and three pyridyl ligands, each pyridyl ligand coming from a different Ni&#8208;DPPyP molecule.</dc:description>
