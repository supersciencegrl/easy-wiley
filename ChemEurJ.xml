         <title>Roles that Organic Ammoniums Play on the Surface of the Perovskite Film: A&#160;Review</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Although perovskites show excellent optoelectronic properties leading to unprecedented efficiency increases of perovskite solar cells (PSCs), their polycrystalline films present a number of defect states, especially concentrated on the surface, which seriously affects device efficiency and long&#8208;term stability. Numerous works have reported various organic ammonium salts (OASs) to reduce defect states on the surface of the perovskite film. However, diverse roles of OASs are proposed and a guideline for reasonably selecting an OAS to treat the perovskite film is still lacked. Herein, we summarize recent works regarding the surface treatment of the perovskite film with OASs and discuss various roles that OASs play. Furthermore, we reveal how key factors, including chemical environment of the perovskite surface, types of OASs, and annealing temperature, influence the roles of OASs. This review could provide clues for understanding working mechanisms of OASs and for selecting appropriate OASs to improve the PSC performance.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>N&#8208;2&#8208;Nitrophenylsulfenyl (Nps) imino dipeptides bearing various functional groups were successfully prepared via MnO2mediated oxidation and then subjected to diastereoselective indolylation.

These transformations would be useful for synthesizing non&#8208;canonical amino acid&#8208;containing peptides as novel drug candidates.</dc:description>

         <title>Erythrose and Threose: Carbonyl Migrations, Epimerizations, Aldol, and Oxidative Fragmentation Reactions Under Plausible Prebiotic Conditions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The prebiotic generation of sugars in the context of origins of life studies is of considerable interest. Among the important intramolecular processes of sugars are carbonyl migrations and accompanying epimerizations. Herein we describe the carbonyl migration&#8208;epimerization process occurring down the entire carbon chain of chirally pure d&#8208;tetroses sugars under mild conditions. Employing chirally pure 1&#8208;13C&#8208;erythrose, 4&#8208;13C&#8208;erythrose and 1&#8208;13C&#8208;threose, we (1) identify all the species formed as the carbonyl migrates down the four&#8208;carbon chain and (2) assess the rates associated with the production of each of these species. Competing aldol reactions and oxidative fragmentation processes were also observed. Further observations of self&#8208;condensation of glycolaldehyde mainly yielding 2&#8208;keto&#8208;hexoses (sorbose and tagatose) and tetrulose also provides a basis for understanding the effect of carbonyl migrations on the product distribution in plausible prebiotic scenarios.</dc:description>

         <title>Advanced Stretchable Photodetectors: Strategies, Materials and Devices</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Past decades have witnessed the new generation of stretchable photodetectors in electronic eyes, health sensing, wearable devices, intelligent monitoring and other fields. Stretchable devices require not only outstanding performance but also excellent flexibility, adaptability and stability. Innovative strategies have been proposed to realize the stretchability of devices. In addition, novel functional materials including zero&#8208;dimensional (0D) nanomaterials, one&#8208;dimensional (1D) inorganic nanomaterials, two&#8208;dimensional (2D) layered materials, organic materials, and organic&#8208;inorganic composite materials with excellent properties are also emerging to continuously refresh the performance of devices. Here, the recent research progresses of stretchable photodetectors in terms of both various design methods and functional materials is outlined. The optical performance and stretchable properties are also comprehensively reviewed. Furthermore, the summary and challenges associated with the application of stretchable photodetectors are presented.</dc:description>

         <title>Reconstructured Electrocatalysts during Oxygen Evolution Reaction under Alkaline Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of electrocatalysts with high&#8208;efficiency and clear structure&#8208;activity relationship towards the sluggish oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is essential for the wide application of water electrolyzers. Recently, the dynamic reconstruction phenomenon of the catalysts&#8217; surface structures during the OER process has been discovered. With the help of various advanced ex situ and in situ characterization, it is demonstrated that such surface reconstruction could yield actual active species to catalyze the water oxidation process. However, the attention and studies of potential interaction between reconstructed species and substrate are lacking. This review summarizes the recent development of typical reconstructed electrocatalysts and the substrate effect. First, the advanced characterization for electrocatalytic reconstruction is briefly discussed. Then, typical reconstructed electrocatalysts are comprehensively summarized and the key role of substrate effects during the OER process is emphasized. Finally, the future challenges and perspectives of surface reconstructed catalysts for water electrolysis are discussed.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>
&#8220;The oxidation of a phosphino group to the corresponding phosphine oxide on the inner rim of a helicene derivative induces a CPL response.&#8221; This and more about the story behind the front cover can be found in the article at 10.1002/chem.202202922).







Abstract
Invited for the cover of this issue are the groups of Kazuteru Usui and Satoru Karasawa at Showa Pharmaceutical University, and Yoshitane Imai at Kindai University. The image depicts how a phosphine&#8208;oxide&#8208;bearing helicene exhibits markedly enhanced CPL response in the excited state compared with that of one with a corresponding phosphine.

         <title>Formation, Reactivity and Decomposition of Aryl Phospha&#8208;Enolates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two lithium phospha&#8208;enolates [RP=C(Si i Pr3)OLi]2 were prepared by reaction of triisopropyl silyl phosphaethynolate,  i Pr3SiPCO, with aryl lithium reagents LiR (R = Mes: 1,3,5&#8208;trimethyl phenyl; or Mes*: 1,3,5,&#8208;tri&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl phenyl). Monomer/dimer aggregation of the enolates can be modulated by addition of 12&#8208;crown&#8208;4. Substitution of lithium for a heavier alkali metal was achieved through initial formation of a silyl enol ether, followed by reaction with KO t Bu to form the corresponding potassium phospha&#8208;enolate [MesP=C(Si i Pr3)OK]2. On addition of water, the enolates are protonated to afford RP=C(Si i Pr3)(OH). For the sterically less demanding system (R = Mes), this phospha&#8208;enol rapidly tautomerises to the corresponding acyl phosphine MesP(H)C(Si i Pr 3 )(O), which on heating extrudes CO. In contrast, bulkier phospha&#8208;enol (R = Mes*) is stable to rearrangement at room temperature and thermally decomposes to RH and  i Pr3SiPCO.</dc:description>

         <title>Two&#8208;Factor Fluorogenicity of Tetrazine&#8208;Modified Cyanine&#8208;Styryl Dyes for Bioorthogonal Labelling of DNA</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>TTwo green fluorescent tetrazine&#8208;modified cyanine&#8208;styryl dyes were synthesized for bioorthogonal labelling of DNA by means of the Diels&#8208;Alder reaction with inverse electron demand. With DNA as target biopolymer the fluorescence of these dyes is released by two factors: (i)&#160;sterically by their interaction with DNA, and (ii)&#160;structurally via the conjugated tetrazine as quencher moiety. As a result, the reaction with bicyclononyne&#8208;modified DNA is significantly accelerated up to &#8805;&#160;284,000&#160;M&#8208;1s&#8208;1, and the fluorescence turn&#8208;on is enhanced up to 560 by the two&#8208;factor fluorogenicity. These dyes are cell permeable even in low concentrations and undergo fluorogenic reactions with BCN&#8208;modified DNA in living HeLa cells. The two&#8208;factor fluorescence release improves the signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio such that washing procedures prior to cell imaging are not needed, which is a great advantage for live cell imaging of DNA and RNA in the future.</dc:description>

         <title>Sustainable Production of Molybdenum Carbide (MXene) from Fruit Wastes for Improved Solar Evaporation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Freshwater production using solar&#8208;driven interfacial evaporation is considered to be a green and sustainable strategy. The biggest barrier to practical deployment of solar desalination, however, continues to be the lack of options for renewable materials. Herein, we present a simple two&#8208;step carbonization approach that is sustainable for developing innovative two&#8208;dimensional (2D) molybdenum carbide (Mo2C) materials derived&#160;from carbonized fruit wastes. The resultant 2D Mo2C photothermal layer has a high water evaporation rate of 1.52 kg m&#8208;2 h&#8208;1 with a photothermal conversion efficiency of 94 % under one sun irradiation, which is among the best values reported thus far. The broad solar absorption band, high specific surface area (555.1 m2 g&#8208;1) with large micro&#8208; and meso porosity&#160;of the Mo2C&#160;photothermal layer are responsible for these outstanding results. The conversion of food wastes into valuable products, in this case MXene, can potentially inspire greener developments of advanced materials for solar water evaporator.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>
Vinylene&#8208;linked thiopyrylium&#8208;based covalent organic frameworks (COFs) were synthesized from 2,4,6&#8208;trimethylpyrylium tetrafluoroborate and other common reagents by means of acid&#8208;catalyzed Aldol condensation. Besides, pyrylium&#8208;, and pyridinium&#8208;based COFs also can be prepared from the same monomer under slightly different reaction conditions.







Abstract
The development of new vinylene&#8208;linked covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with special ionic structure and high stability is challenging. Herein, we report a facile, general method for constructing ionic vinylene&#8208;linked thiopyrylium&#8208;based COFs from 2,4,6&#8208;trimethylpyrylium tetrafluoroborate and other common reagents by means of acid&#8208;catalyzed Aldol condensation. Besides, pyrylium&#8208;, and pyridinium&#8208;based COFs also can be prepared from the same monomer under slightly different reaction conditions. The COFs exhibited uniform nanofibrous morphologies with excellent crystallinities, special ionic structures, well&#8208;defined nanochannels, and high specific surface areas.

         <title>Probing Cell&#8208;Surface Interactions in Fungal Cell Walls by High&#8208;Resolution 1H&#8208;Detected Solid&#8208;State NMR Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
How 1H&#8208;detected fast MAS ssNMR spectroscopy can be applied for in&#8208;depth characterization of the Schizophyllum commune cell wall architecture and composition, as well as the elucidation of cell surface&#8208;level interactions. The obtained results reveal the relative abundance and arrangement of the polysaccharide and polypeptide layers and their significance in the binding of ligands to the fungal cell wall.







Abstract
Solid&#8208;state NMR (ssNMR) spectroscopy facilitates the non&#8208;destructive characterization of structurally heterogeneous biomolecules in their native setting, for example, comprising proteins, lipids and polysaccharides. Here we demonstrate the utility of high and ultra&#8208;high field 1H&#8208;detected fast MAS ssNMR spectroscopy, which exhibits increased sensitivity and spectral resolution, to further elucidate the atomic&#8208;level composition and structural arrangement of the cell wall of Schizophyllum commune, a mushroom&#8208;forming fungus from the Basidiomycota phylum. These advancements allowed us to reveal that Cu(II) ions and the antifungal peptide Cathelicidin&#8208;2 mainly bind to cell wall proteins at low concentrations while glucans are targeted at high metal ion concentrations. In addition, our data suggest the presence of polysaccharides containing N&#8208;acetyl galactosamine (GalNAc) and proteins, including the hydrophobin proteins SC3, shedding more light on the molecular make&#8208;up of cells wall as well as the positioning of the polypeptide layer. Obtaining such information may be of critical relevance for future research into fungi in material science and biomedical contexts.

Here we demonstrate the utility of high and ultra-high field &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H-detected fast MAS ssNMR spectroscopy, which exhibits increased sensitivity and spectral resolution, to further elucidate the atomic-level composition and structural arrangement of the cell wall of &lt;i&gt;Schizophyllum commune&lt;/i&gt;, a mushroom-forming fungus from the Basidiomycota phylum. These advancements allowed us to reveal that Cu(II) ions and the antifungal peptide Cathelicidin-2 mainly bind to cell wall proteins at low concentrations while glucans are targeted at high metal ion concentrations. In addition, our data suggest the presence of polysaccharides containing N-acetyl galactosamine (GalNAc) and proteins, including the hydrophobin proteins SC3, shedding more light on the molecular make-up of cells wall as well as the positioning of the polypeptide layer. Obtaining such information may be of critical relevance for future research into fungi in material science and biomedical contexts.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Abstract
A three&#8208;component, solvent&#8208;dependent, Br&#248;nsted&#8208;acid&#8208;catalyzed reaction of benzaldehydes, silyl enolates and arene nucleophiles has been developed for the synthesis of potential drug candidate 3&#8208;aryl&#8208;1&#8208;indanones. This reaction features the formation of three C&#8722;C bonds, high regioselectivity in a one&#8208;pot strategy, broad substrate generality, facile scalability (1.04g), high functional group tolerance and viable substrates. The &#946;&#8208;O&#8208;silyl ethers generated in&#8208;situ from the Mukaiyama aldol reaction were subjected to acid&#8208;catalyzed benzylic arylation with strong as well as weak nucleophiles, and the resultant &#946;,&#946;&#8208;diaryl esters can undergo a third C&#8722;C bond formation with excellent regioselectivity through intramolecular cyclization to afford the indanone products in the same pot. Detailed mechanistic insight leads to a feasible reaction pathway. This transformation opens up a practical and adaptable approach to producing a variety of synthetically valuable transformations and enable the synthesis of medicinally valuable (R)&#8208;tolterodine and (+)&#8208;indatraline.

         <title>Stacking Interactions: A Supramolecular Approach to Upgrade Weak Halogen Bond Donors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
&#960;&#8208;Stacking interactions turn on halogen &#963;&#8208;hole in unactivated chloro&#8208; and bromo&#8208;arenes which are thus enabled to function as good halogen bonding donors.







Abstract
The co&#8208;crystallization of tetracyanobenzene (TCB) with haloarenes ArX provided six new co&#8208;crystals TCB&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;ArX (ArX=PhCl, PhBr, 4&#8208;MeC6H4Cl, 4&#8208;MeC6H4Br, 4&#8208;MeOC6H4Cl, 1,2&#8208;Br2C6H4) which were studied by X&#8208;ray diffraction. In these systems, the strong collective effect of &#960;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; stacking interactions and lone pair&#8208;(X)&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960;&#8208;hole&#8208;(C) bondings between TCB and ArX promote the strength of X&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Ncyano halogen bonding (HaB). Theoretical studies showed that the stacking interactions affect the &#963;&#8208;hole depth of the haloarenes, thus significantly boosting their ability to function as HaB donors. According to the molecular electrostatic potential calculations, the &#963;&#8208; hole&#8208;(Cl) value (1.5&#8197;kcal/mol) in the haloarene 4&#8208;MeOC6H4Cl (featuring an electron&#8208;rich arene moiety and exhibiting very poor &#963;&#8208;hole&#8208;(Cl) ability) increases significantly in the stacked trimer (TCB)2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;4&#8208;MeOC6H4Cl (12.5&#8197;kcal/mol). Theoretical DFT calculations demonstrate the dramatic increase of X&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Ncyano HaB strength for stacked trimers in comparison with parent unstacked haloarenes.

         <title>Efficient Photoredox Cycles to Control Perylenediimide Self&#8208;Assembly
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photoreduction can be used to disassemble perylenediimide&#8208;based supramolecular structures by creating repulsive dianions. Typically, photoreductions are done in oxygen&#8208;free conditions. Here we show that &#8216;indirect photoreduction&#8217; by acetone ketyl radicals is very efficient and can be done in open air. Repeated photoreduction/disassembly followed by oxidation/assembly cycles can in this way be performed by simple UV&#8722;C LED light.







Abstract
Photoreduction of perylenediimide (PDI) derivatives has been widely studied for use in photocatalysis, hydrogen evolution, photo&#8208;responsive gels, and organic semiconductors. Upon light irradiation, the radical anion (PDI&#8901;&#8722;) can readily be obtained, whereas further reduction to the dianion (PDI2&#8722;) is rare. Here we show that full 2&#8208;electron photoreduction can be achieved using UVC light: 1) in anaerobic conditions by &#8216;direct photoreduction&#8217; of PDI aggregates, or 2) by &#8216;indirect photoreduction&#8217; in aerobic conditions due to acetone ketyl radicals. The latter strategy is also efficient for other dyes, such as naphthalenediimide (NDI) and methylviologen (MV2+). Efficient photoreduction on the minute time&#8208;scale using simple LED light in aerobic conditions is attractive for use in dissipative light&#8208;driven systems and materials.

         <title>A Silicon&#8208;Stereogenic Silanol &#8208; 18O&#8208;Isotope Labeling and Stereogenic Probe Reveals Hidden Stereospecific Water Exchange Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Silanols are important industrial building blocks for the functionalization of surfaces. In this research, one silicon&#8208;stereogenic silanol was selectively synthesized and analyzed. By using an innovative combination of this stereochemical probe and isotope labeling, a configurationally stable chiral silanol was studied, providing new insights into mechanistic studies.







Abstract
A silicon&#8208;stereogenic aminosilanol was isolated in excellent diastereomeric ratio and the absolute configuration was determined. The silanol is configurative and condensation stable in solution and shows stereoselective transformations with a clean stereospecific pathway in follow&#8208;up reactions, which leads to the isolation of a silicon&#8208;stereogenic zinc complex and siloxane compounds. Investigations with 18O&#8208;labelled water and mass spectrometry analysis revealed an otherwise hidden exchange of oxygen atoms of silanol and water in solution that proceeds with retention of the configuration at the silicon center. This novel combination of a stereochemical probe and isotopic labeling in a silicon&#8208;stereogenic compound opens new analytic possibilities to study stereochemical courses of reactions with the aid of chiral silanols mechanistically.

         <title>Robust Spirobifluorene Core Based Hole Transporters with High Mobility for Long&#8208;Life Green Phosphorescent Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Devices</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A green phosphorescent OLED with a high external quantum efficiency of 22&#8201;% and a long lifetime (LT50) of 89,000&#8197;h at 1000&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2 has been successfully developed by a spirobifluorene&#8208;based multifunctional hole transporter referred to as TDBFSBF1.







Abstract
Using a tailored high triplet energy hole transport layer (HTL) is a suitable way to improve the efficiency and extend the lifetime of organic light&#8208;emitting devices (OLEDs), which can use all molecular excitons of singlets and triplets. In this study, dibenzofuran (DBF)&#8208;end&#8208;capped and spirobifluorene (SBF) core&#8208;based HTLs referred as TDBFSBF1 and TDBFSBF2 were effectively developed. TDBFSBF1 exhibited a high glass transition temperature of 178&#8201;&#176;C and triplet energy of 2.5&#8197;eV. Moreover, a high external quantum efficiency of 22.0&#8201;%, long operational lifetime at 50&#8201;% of the initial luminance of 89,000&#8197;h, and low driving voltage at 1000&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2 of 2.95&#8197;V were achieved in green phosphorescent OLEDs using TDBFSBF1. Further, a high&#8208;hole mobility &#956;h value of 1.9&#215;10&#8722;3&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1 was recorded in TDBFSBF2. A multiscale simulation successfully reproduced the experimental &#956;h values and indicated that the reorganization energy was the primary factor in determining the mobility differences among these SBF core based HTLs.

         <title>Systematic Modulation of Thiol Functionalities in Inexpensive Porous Polymers for Effective Mercury Removal</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Triple trickle trap: Mercury cations were captured by three thiol&#8208;modified porous polymers with precise sulfur content and chain length. Results show optimized binding with very high capacities and a unique hydrophobic/hydrophobic interplay with multidentate binding facilitates varying capture kinetics. Easily scaled up, these inexpensive solids could feasibly be used in cleaning mercury&#8208;laden water streams.







Abstract
Through accumulation, mercury contamination in aquatic systems still poses serious health risks despite the strict regulations on drinking water and industrial discharge. One effective strategy against this is adsorptive removal, in which a suitably functionalized porous material is added to water treatment protocols. Thiol (SH) group&#8208;grafted structures perform commendably; however, insufficient attention is paid to the cost, scalability, and reusability or how the arrangement of sulfur atoms could affect the HgII binding strength. We used an inexpensive and scalable porous covalent organic polymer (COP&#8208;130) to systematically introduce thiol functional groups with precise chain lengths and sulfur content. Thiol&#8208;functionalized COP&#8208;130 demonstrates enhanced wettability and excellent HgII uptake of up to 936&#8197;mg&#8201;g&#8722;1, with fast kinetics and exceptionally high selectivity. These Hg adsorbents are easily regenerated with HCl and can be used at least six times without loss of capacity even after treatment with strong acid, a rare performance in the domain of Hg&#8208;removal research.

         <title>Protonated Porphyrins: Bifunctional Catalysts for the Metal&#8208;Free Synthesis of N&#8208;Alkyl&#8208;Oxazolidinones</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
CO2 cycloaddition to N&#8208;alkyl aziridines was efficiently promoted by economic and easy&#8208;to&#8208;synthesize protonated forms of porphyrin ligands. The metal&#8208;free procedure does not require the addition of any Lewis base or additive and allows N&#8208;alkyl oxazolidinones to be obtained in high yields and regioselectivities. A catalytic mechanism for the procedure is proposed on the basis of a DFT study.







Abstract
The protonation of commercially available porphyrin ligands yields a class of bifunctional catalysts able to promote the synthesis of N&#8208;alkyl oxazolidinones by CO2 cycloaddition to corresponding aziridines. The catalytic system does not require the presence of any Lewis base or additive, and shows interesting features both in terms of cost effectiveness and eco&#8208;compatibility. The metal&#8208;free methodology is active even with a low catalytic loading of 1&#8201;% mol, and the chemical stability of the protonated porphyrin allowed it to be recycled three times without any decrease in performance. In addition, a DFT study was performed in order to suggest how a simple protonated porphyrin can mediate CO2 cycloaddition to aziridines to yield oxazolidinones.

         <title>Total Synthesis, Absolute Configuration, and Phytotoxic Activity of Foeniculoxin</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Foeniculoxin is a major phytotoxin produced by Italian strains of Phomopsis foeniculi. The first total synthesis is described utilizing the ene reaction and Sonogashira cross&#8208;coupling reaction as key steps. The absolute configuration of the C6&#8217; was determined using chiral separation and advanced Mosher&#8217;s method. The phytotoxicity of the synthesized compound was demonstrated via syringe&#8208;based infiltration into Chenopodium album and Arabidopsis thaliana leaves. Synthetic foeniculoxin induced various defects in A. thaliana leaf cells before lesion formation, including protein leakage into the cytoplasm from both chloroplasts and mitochondria and mitochondrial rounding and swelling. Furthermore, foeniculoxin and the antibiotic hygromycin B caused similar agglomeration of mitochondria around chloroplasts, highlighting this event as a common component in the early stages of plant cell death.</dc:description>

         <title>Oxidation of an Internal&#8208;Edge&#8208;Substituted [5]Helicene&#8208;Derived Phosphine Synchronously Enhances Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Helicenes with controllable chiroptical properties: Herein, we reveal a system in which the oxidation of a phosphino group on the inner rim of a helicene derivative induces a circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) response. A helicene bearing a phosphine oxide group exhibits a markedly enhanced CPL response in the excited state compared with that of such a helicene with a corresponding phosphine. More information can be found in the Research Article by K. Usui, Y. Imai, S. Karasawa, and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202202922).

         <title>Siderophore&#8208;linked Ruthenium Catalysts for Targeted Allyl Ester Prodrug Activation within Bacterial Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Due to rising resistance, new antibacterial strategies are needed, including methods for targeted antibiotic release. As targeting vectors, chelating molecules released by bacteria to acquire iron called siderophores have been investigated for conjugation to antibacterials, leading to the clinically&#8208;approved drug cefiderocol. The use of small&#8208;molecule catalysts for prodrug activation within cells has shown promise in recent years, and here we investigate siderophore&#8208;linked ruthenium catalysts for the activation of antibacterial prodrugs within cells. Moxifloxacin&#8208;based prodrugs were synthesised and their catalyst&#8208;mediated activation was demonstrated under anaerobic, biologically&#8208;relevant conditions. In the absence of catalyst, decreased antibacterial activities were observed compared to moxifloxacin versus&#160;Escherichia coli K12 (BW25113). A series of siderophore&#8208;linked ruthenium catalysts were investigated for prodrug activation, all of which displayed a combinative antibacterial effect with the prodrug, whilst a representative example displayed little toxicity against mammalian cell lines.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Due to rising resistance, new antibacterial strategies are needed, including methods for targeted antibiotic release. As targeting vectors, chelating molecules released by bacteria to acquire iron called siderophores have been investigated for conjugation to antibacterials, leading to the clinically-approved drug cefiderocol. The use of small-molecule catalysts for prodrug activation within cells has shown promise in recent years, and here we investigate siderophore-linked ruthenium catalysts for the activation of antibacterial prodrugs within cells. Moxifloxacin-based prodrugs were synthesised and their catalyst-mediated activation was demonstrated under anaerobic, biologically-relevant conditions.

         <title>Three&#8208;Component Perfluoroalkylvinylation of Alkenes Enabled by Dual DBU/Fe Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This manuscript demonstrates a simple and efficient strategy that involves dual DBU/iron&#8208;catalyzed alkene perfluoroalkylvinylation using perfluoroalkyl iodides and 2aminonaphthalene&#8208;1,4&#8208;diones as coupling partners. In terms of the developed catalytic system, various styrenes and aliphatic alkenes are well&#8208;tolerated, leading to the accurate preparation of perfluoroalkyl&#8208;containing 2&#8208;aminonaphthalene&#8208;1,4&#8208;diones in excellent regioselectivity. Moreover, the protocol can be readily applied in late&#8208;stage modifications of natural products and pharmaceuticals. The title reactions are featured by easily accessible and inexpensive catalysts and substrates, broad substrate applicability, and mild reaction conditions. Mechanistic investigations reveal a tandem C&#8208;I cleavable alkylation and C&#8208;C vinylation enabled by cooperative DBU/iron catalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Catalysts as Key Enablers for the Synthesis of Bioplastics with Sophisticated Architectures</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly active and selective catalysts pave the way for the production of bioplastics with tailor&#8208;made properties. Comonomers can be used to alter the properties of the prominent bioplastic PLA. Besides the variation in the microstructure, a treasure not yet fully uncovered lies within the combination of different monomer classes in multimechanistic polymerizations.







Abstract
Bioplastics are one of the answers to environmental pollution and linear material flows. The most promising bioplastic polylactide (PLA) is already replacing conventional plastics in a number of applications. The properties of PLA, however, do not fit for all potential application areas, but they can be altered by the introduction of comonomers. The copolymerization of lactide (LA) with other lactones like &#1013;&#8208;caprolactone (CL) has been established for several years. Nevertheless, controlling copolymerizations remains a challenge due to the high complexity of the system. Copolymerization of LA with other monomer classes is much less investigated, but has the chance to overcome the limitations in material properties that occur when only lactones are used. The crucial factor for all copolymerizations is the catalyst. It dominates the reaction kinetics and determines the resulting microstructure. In this review, copolymerization catalysts for LA are presented divided into catalysts for the synthesis of lactone block copolymers, lactone random copolymers, and multimechanistically synthesized copolymers. The selected catalysts are highlighted either owing to their industrially applicable polymerization conditions or their non&#8208;standard mechanism.

         <title>Structure&#8211;Property Relationship of Cyano&#8208;Functionalized Conjugated Polymers for Photocatalytic Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photocatalysis: The increase in the degree of CN functionalization can regulate the D&#8208;A interaction with beneficial effects, such as broadened light absorption range, improved charge separation, enhanced interaction with Pt cocatalyst, and strengthened hydrophilicity, which achieves an excellent activity in the photocatalytic hydrogen production reaction.







Abstract
Conjugated polymers (CPs) have garnered increasing attention in the field of photocatalysis due to their stability and molecular tunability. Understanding the structure&#8211;property relationship in CPs and addressing appropriate molecular design strategies are pivotal to improving the photocatalytic performance of CPs. Herein, a new efficient cyano (CN) engineering approach was proposed to promote the photocatalytic performance of CPs, and three representative CP&#8208;based photocatalysts with different CN contents were tailor&#8208;made to investigate the relationship between CN functionalization and photocatalytic activity. A series of systematically experimental and theoretical studies reveal that CN functionalization contributes to strengthening the donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;A) interaction, enhancing the light absorption ability, charge separation/transfer efficiency, and hydrophilicity of CPs, and also facilitating the output of separated photoinduced electrons from CPs to Pt cocatalyst. Thus, the dicyano&#8208;functionalized polymer (P&#8208;2CN) manifests an attractive photocatalytic performance in hydrogen production. This study provides a facile strategy to develop excellent CP&#8208;based photocatalysts for solar fuel production.

         <title>Investigating the Active Oxidants Involved in Cytochrome P450 Catalyzed Sulfoxidation Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Engineering peroxygenase activity into a P450 monooxygenase through mutations of the oxygen activation machinery resulted in a higher activity towards sulfoxidation than O&#8208;demethylation compared to the WT enzyme. This implies the existence of a second oxidant capable of catalyzing sulfoxidation which is proposed to be the Fe(III)&#8208;H2O2 complex as proposed in theoretical work by Shaik.







Abstract
Cytochrome P450 (CYP) heme&#8208;thiolate monooxygenases catalyze the hydroxylation of the C&#8722;H bonds of organic molecules. This reaction is initiated by a ferryl&#8208;oxo heme radical cation (Cpd I). These enzymes can also catalyze sulfoxidation reactions and the ferric&#8208;hydroperoxy complex (Cpd 0) and the Fe(III)&#8208;H2O2 complex have been proposed as alternative oxidants for this transformation. To investigate this, the oxidation of 4&#8208;alkylthiobenzoic acids and 4&#8208;methoxybenzoic acid by the CYP199A4 enzyme from Rhodopseudomonas palustris HaA2 was compared using both monooxygenase and peroxygenase pathways. By examining mutants at the mechanistically important, conserved acid alcohol&#8208;pair (D251N, T252A and T252E) the relative amounts of the reactive intermediates that would form in these reactions were disturbed. Substrate binding and X&#8208;ray crystal structures helped to understand changes in the activity and enabled an attempt to evaluate whether multiple oxidants can participate in these reactions. In peroxygenase reactions the T252E mutant had higher activity towards sulfoxidation than O&#8208;demethylation but in the monooxygenase reactions with the WT enzyme the activity of both reactions was similar. The peroxygenase activity of the T252A mutant was greater for sulfoxidation reactions than the WT enzyme, which is the reverse of the activity changes observed for O&#8208;demethylation. The monooxygenase activity and coupling efficiency of sulfoxidation and oxidative demethylation were reduced by similar degrees with the T252A mutant. These observations infer that while Cpd I is required for O&#8208;dealkylation, another oxidant may contribute to sulfoxidation. Based on the activity of the CYP199A4 mutants it is proposed that this is the Fe(III)&#8208;H2O2 complex which would be more abundant in the peroxide&#8208;driven reactions.

         <title>Accumulation of Four Electrons on a Terphenyl (Bis)disulfide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Charge accumulation is relevant for applications in solar energy conversion. Here, we present an electron acceptor that is able to store up to four electrons by taking advantage of the uncommon phenomenon of potential inversion.







Abstract
The activation of N2, CO2 or H2O to energy&#8208;rich products relies on multi&#8208;electron transfer reactions, and consequently it seems desirable to understand the basics of light&#8208;driven accumulation of multiple redox equivalents. Most of the previously reported molecular acceptors merely allow the storage of up to two electrons. We report on a terphenyl compound including two disulfide bridges, which undergoes four&#8208;electron reduction in two separate electrochemical steps, aided by a combination of potential compression and inversion. Under visible&#8208;light irradiation using the organic super&#8208;electron donor tetrakis(dimethylamino)ethylene, a cascade of light&#8208;induced reaction steps is observed, leading to the cleavage of both disulfide bonds. Whereas one of them undergoes extrusion of sulfur to result in a thiophene, the other disulfide is converted to a dithiolate. These insights seem relevant to enhance the current fundamental understanding of photochemical energy storage.

We report on a terphenyl compound including two disulfide bridges, which undergoes four-electron reduction in two separate electrochemical steps, aided by a combination of potential compression and inversion. Under visible-light irradiation using the organic super-electron donor tetrakis(dimethylamino)ethylene, a cascade of light-induced reaction steps is observed, leading to the cleavage of both disulfide bonds. Whereas one of them undergoes extrusion of sulfur to result in a thiophene, the other disulfide is converted to a dithiolate. These insights seem relevant to enhance the current fundamental understanding of photochemical energy storage.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Pnictogen&#8208;Bridged Diphenyl Sulfones as Photoinduced Pnictogen Bond Forming Emission Motifs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, we investigated pnictogen&#8208;bridged diphenyl sulfones as a new class of luminophores with photoinduced dynamic rearrangement. Experimental and theoretical studies revealed that their emission dynamics could be ascribed to the photoinduced Pn&#8722;bond formation between a lone O pair in the sulfonyl moiety and the antibonding orbital of the Pn&#8722;C bond.







Abstract
In this study, pnictogen (Pn)&#8208;bridged diphenyl sulfones were synthesized as motifs for photoinduced dynamic rearrangement. The newly synthesized sulfones exhibited dual fluorescence at 298&#8197;K. Density functional theory calculations revealed that the longer&#8208;wavelength fluorescence was derived from the geometries after structural relaxation through photo&#8208;driven pnictogen bond formation between the O atom lone pair of the sulfonyl moiety and the antibonding orbital of the Pn&#8722;C bond. This is the first report on emission dynamics driven by pnictogen bond formation upon photoexcitation.

         <dc:description>Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are the one of most promising photovoltaic technologies that can be achieved by a simple solution process. At the current stage, the key issues concern further improvements in efficiency and operational lifetime. Constructing a self&#8208;assembled perovskite structure with manipulated chemical and physical properties is a useful and effective strategy to solve these problems. Herein, we review the basic principles and the recent progress of spontaneous formation behaviors of heterostructured perovskite thin films.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Novel coordination polymers embedding electroactive moieties present a high interest in the development of porous conducting materials. While tetrathiafulvalene (TTF) based metal&#8208;organic frameworks were reported to yield through&#8208;space conducting frameworks, the use of S&#8208;enriched scaffolds remains elusive in this field. Herein is reported the employment of bis(vinylenedithio)&#8208;tetrathiafulvalene (BVDT&#8208;TTF) functionalized with pyridine coordinating moieties in coordination polymers. Its combination with various transition metals yielded four isostructural networks, whose conductivity increased upon chemical oxidation with iodine. The oxidation was confirmed in a single&#8208;crystal to single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction experiment for the Cd(II) complex. Raman spectroscopy measurements and DFT calculations confirmed the oxidation state of the bulk materials, and band structure calculations assessed the ground state as an electronically localized antiferromagnetic state, while the conduction occurs in a 2D manner. These results are shedding light to comprehend how to improve through&#8208;space conductivity thanks to sulfur enriched ligands.</dc:description>

         <title>Stabilization of potent Co(II)&#8208;based Lewis acids with weakly basic ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Pairing cations with weakly coordinating anions (WCAs) often renders them highly Lewis&#8208;acidic and extremely reactive. Although these features are often desirable, excessive reactivity of a cation may lead to decomposition of solvents or WCAs, hindering isolation, storage and practical use of such species. In an attempt to mitigate the problem, we introduce a series of readily available novel Co(II)&#8208;WCA salts with the metal center stabilized by weakly bound ligands: SO2, halogenated acetonitriles and nitromethane with comprehensive characterization including structural, magnetic and spectral (IR) properties as well as thermal stability assessment. The use of these simple yet rarely encountered ligands yields mostly stable and highly Lewis&#8208;acidic complexes, in some cases comparable to SbF5 according to calculated Fluoride Ion Affinities. Highly acidic character of the species is also reflected in observed reactivity. Since the most convenient route towards the Co(II) complexes leads through silver salts, the results are complemented with characterization of a series of novel Ag(I) complexes with abovementioned ligands. Experimental part is backed with DFT calculations which gives insight into the structure and energetics of presented Co(II) complexes and shows that Co(II) center is available for substrates like olefins. This makes them good candidates for catalysts in reactions requiring the presence of Lewis acids.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sodium manganese&#8208;based oxides (NMO) are attracting huge attention as safe and cost&#8208;effective cathode materials for sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs). To date, one of the most important challenges of NMO&#8208;based cathodes is the relatively low capacity. Therefore, it is of great siginificance to develope high&#8208;capacity NMO&#8208;based cathodes. Great efforts have been made to enhance the reversible capacity of NMO&#8208;based cathodes, achieveing considerable progress not only on electrochemical performance, but also the mechanism of massive sodium ion storage. In this paper, the structure and sodium storage mechanism for typical phases of NMO are reviewed, including P2, P3, O3, tunnel&#8208;type and spinel&#8208;type NMO&#8208;based cathodes. Strategies for high&#8208;capacity NMO&#8208;based cathodes, such as cationic substitution, anion redox activation, etc. are introduced in detail. Last but not least, the future opportunities and challenges for high&#8208;capacity NMO&#8208;based cathode are prospected.</dc:description>

         <title>Bimetallic organic framework&#8208;decorated leaf&#8208;like 2D nanosheets as flexible air cathode for rechargeable Zn&#8208;air batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>To explore highly active and robust self&#8208;supporting air electrode is the key for &#64258;exible Zn&#8208;air batteries (FZABs). Therefore, we report a novel 3D structural bimetal&#8208;based self&#8208;supporting electrode consisting of hybrid Cu, Co nanoparticles co&#8208;modified nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon nanosheets on carbon cloth (Cu, Co NPs@NCNSs/CC), which displays excellent electrochemical activity and durability of oxygen reduction/evolution reaction (ORR/OER). The Cu, Co NPs@NCNSs/CC exhibits a half&#8208;wave potential of 0.863 V toward ORR and an overpotential of 225 mV at 10 mA cm&#8208;2 toward OER, owing to its exposed bimetallic sites accelerating kinetic reaction. In addition, the density functional theory calculation proves that the synergistic effect of CuCo sites favors ORR and OER. Hence, the FZABs based on Cu, Co NPs@NCNSs/CC achieve a larger open&#8208;circuit potential (1.45 V), higher energy density (130.10 mW cm&#8208;2), and outstandingly cycling stability. All remarkable results demonstrate valuable enlightenment for seeking advanced energy materials of portable and wearable electronics.</dc:description>

         <title>Probing a General Strategy to Break the C&#8208;C Bond of Benzene by a Cyclic (Alkyl)(Amino)Aluminyl Anion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The oxidative addition of C&#8208;C bonds in aromatic hydrocarbons by low valent main group species has attracted considerable attention from both theoretical and experimental chemists due to the big challenge in breaking their aromaticity. Here, we demonstrate a general strategy to break the C&#8208;C bonds in benzene by cyclic (alkyl)(amino)aluminyl anion via density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Our results suggest that the activation of the C&#8208;C bond of benzene by this anion is both kinetically and thermodynamically unfavorable whereas introducing electron&#8208;withdrawing groups makes such C&#8208;C bond activation becomes favorable both kinetically and thermodynamically. Such a sharp change on the kinetics and thermodynamics could be rationalized by the frontier molecular orbital theory by decreasing the lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals of the mono&#8208; and disubstituted benzenes. Aromaticity is found to stabilize the transition state for the ring open step. All these findings can help develop the chemistry of small&#8208;molecule activation.</dc:description>

         <title>Differences in the reactivity of geminal Si&#8211;O&#8211;P and Al&#8211;O&#8211;P</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The new oxygen&#8208;bridged geminal Si/P Frustrated Lewis Pair (FLP) tBu2P&#8211;O&#8211;Si(C2F5)3 (2) is able to reversibly bind carbon dioxide at ambient temperature. We compared its reactivity towards benzil, but&#8208;3&#8208;en&#8208;2&#8208;one, nitriles and phenylacetylene to that of the Al/P FLP tBu2P&#8211;O&#8211;AlBis2 (Bis = &#8211;CH(SiMe3)2) (1). When reacted with benzil, both, 1 and 2, form the 1,2&#8208;addition product, but in the Si/P FLP 2, the second carbonyl function additionally binds to the silicon atom. With but&#8208;3&#8208;en&#8208;2&#8208;one 2 forms the 1,2&#8208;addition product, while 1 binds in 1,4&#8208;position. The reaction with acetonitrile yielded an unexpected etheneimine adduct for both systems, while only 1 reacted with tert&#8208;butylnitrile. With benzonitrile and acrylonitrile, 2 showed reversible addition to the C&#8801;N bond and 1 forms a stable adduct with benzonitrile. Solely 1 shows reactivity towards phenylacetylene affording a mixture of the CH deprotonation adduct tBu2P(H)&#8211;O&#8211;AlBis2(CCPh) and the FLP&#8208;C&#186;C adduct under ring formation.

         <title>Phosphorescent Metal Halide Nanoclusters for Tunable Photodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is currently limited by the inability of photosensitizers (PSs) to enter cancer cells and generate sufficient reactive oxygen species.&#160; Utilizing phosphorescent triplet states of novel PSs to generate singlet oxygen offers exciting possibilities for PDT. Here, we report&#160; phosphorescent octahedral molybdenum (Mo)&#8208;based nanoclusters&#160; (NC) with tunable toxicity for PDT of cancer cells without use of rare or toxic elements. Upon irradiation with blue light, these molecules are excited to their singlet state and then undergo intersystem crossing to their triplet state. These NCs display surprising tunability of their cellular cytotoxicity and phototoxicity by modulating the apical halide ligand with a series of short chain fatty acids from trifluoroacetate to heptafluorobutyrate. The NCs are effective in PDT against breast, skin, pancreas, and colon cancer cells as well as their highly metastatic derivatives, demonstrating the robustness of these NCs in treating a wide variety of aggressive cancer cells. Furthermore, these NCs are internalized by cancer cells, remain in the lysosome, and can be modulated by the apical ligand to produce singlet oxygen. Thus, (Mo)&#8208;based nanoclusters are an excellent platform for optimizing PSs. Our results highlight the profound impact of molecular nanocluster chemistry in PDT applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Stereoconvergent Synthesis of Z&#8208;1,3&#8208;Disubstituted&#8208;1,3&#8208;Dienes by Uphill Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Isomeric mixtures of 1,3&#8208;dienes were selectively isomerized to their Z&#8208;isomers by uphill photocatalysis using blue LEDs and a catalytic amount of Ru(bpy)32+(PF6&#8722;)2 as the triplet sensitizer. It proved possible to directly convert alkyne and 1&#8208;alkene to Z&#8208;1,3&#8208;dienes by a one&#8208;pot procedure, offering a practical approach to Z&#8208;1,3&#8208;dienes which cannot be made directly by ene&#8208;yne metathesis.







Abstract
A variety of 1&#8208;aryl&#8208;1,3&#8208;dienes were isomerized from E to Z isomers by photocatalysis using Ru(bpy)3[PF6]2 and blue LED light. Enrichment of the Z&#8208;isomer is thought to occur by selective triplet energy transfer from the photocatalyst to the stereoisomeric mixture. The 1,3&#8208;diene starting materials are easily made by catalytic ene&#8208;yne metathesis (EYM). To access 1,3&#8208;diene Z&#8208;stereoisomers directly, a one pot procedure was developed. Additional 1,3&#8208;dienes were investigated for both isomerization and Z&#8208;enrichment. The combination of cross EYM with photocatalysis allows for the stereoconvergent synthesis of Z&#8208;1,3&#8208;dienes.

         <title>Nanoarchitectonics of RGO&#8208;Wrapped CNF/GO Aerogels with Controlled Pore Structures by PVA&#8208;Assisted Freeze&#8208;Casting Approach for Efficient Sound and Microwave Absorption
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A polyvinyl alcohol (PVA)&#8208;assisted freeze&#8208;casting is developed for controllably fabricating reduced graphene oxide wrapped&#8208;carbon nanofiber (RGO@CNF)/graphene oxide composite aerogel. Due to the modulation of the pore size and composition, the resultant aerogel demonstrated an improved sound absorption property, especially at low frequencies. Moreover, the sample exhibits good microwave absorption performance and cyclic loading stability.







Abstract
Acoustic absorption materials play an important role in eliminating the negative effects of noise. Herein, a polyvinyl alcohol (PVA)&#8208;assisted freeze&#8208;casting was developed for controllably fabricating reduced graphene oxide wrapped carbon nanofiber (RGO@CNF)/graphene oxide composite aerogel. During the freeze&#8208;casting, PVA was used as an icing inhibitor to control the size of ice crystals. While the concentration of PVA increased from 0 to 15&#8197;mg&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;ml&#8722;1, the average pore size of the aerogel was reduced from 154 to 45&#8197;&#956;m. Due to the modulation of the pore size and composition, the propagation path and friction loss for sound were optimized, especially at low frequency. For instance, the normalized sound absorption coefficient of RGO@CNF/GO&#8208;10 achieves 0.79 (250&#8211;6300&#8197;Hz). The sample also exhibits a desirable microwave absorbing property whose maximum reflection loss is &#8722;47.3&#8197;dB (9.44 GHz, d=3.0&#8197;mm).

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A polyvinyl alcohol (PVA)-assisted freeze-casting&lt;/b&gt; is developed for controllably fabricating reduced graphene oxide wrapped-carbon nanofiber (RGO@CNF)/graphene oxide composite aerogel. Due to the modulation of the pore size and composition, the resultant aerogel demonstrated an improved sound absorption property, especially at low frequencies. Moreover, the sample exhibits good microwave absorption performance and cyclic loading stability.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acoustic absorption materials play an important role in eliminating the negative effects of noise. Herein, a polyvinyl alcohol (PVA)-assisted freeze-casting was developed for controllably fabricating reduced graphene oxide wrapped carbon nanofiber (RGO@CNF)/graphene oxide composite aerogel. During the freeze-casting, PVA was used as an icing inhibitor to control the size of ice crystals. While the concentration of PVA increased from 0 to 15&#8197;mg&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;ml&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, the average pore size of the aerogel was reduced from 154 to 45&#8197;&#956;m. Due to the modulation of the pore size and composition, the propagation path and friction loss for sound were optimized, especially at low frequency. For instance, the normalized sound absorption coefficient of RGO@CNF/GO-10 achieves 0.79 (250&#8211;6300&#8197;Hz). The sample also exhibits a desirable microwave absorbing property whose maximum reflection loss is &#8722;47.3&#8197;dB (9.44 GHz, d=3.0&#8197;mm). Prospectively, this synthetic strategy can be extended to develop other forms of elastic aerogel with a controlled pore size.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Square&#8208;planar [Pt(C^N*N&#8242;^C&#8242;)] complexes bearing novel nonsymmetric tetradentate ligands display strong green&#8208;yellow emission in their monomeric form in tetrahydrofuran solution. Mixing the THF solutions with water results in aggregation of the complexes to afford nanospecies with clearly visible aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) that shifts the luminescent bands to the near infrared due to a metallophilic interaction between the starting molecular chromophores.

         <title>&#963;&#8208;Holes in Iodonium Ylides: Halogen&#8208;Bond Activation of Carboxylic Acids, Phenols and Thiophenols May Enable Their X&#8722;H Insertion Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Computational analysis revealed iodonium ylides to possess two &#963;&#8208;holes of differing potentials, situated along the extensions of their C&#8722;I bonds. Experimentation revealed that formal O&#8722;H or S&#8722;H insertion reactions were possible with carboxylic acids, phenols and thiophenols. Halogen&#8208;bond activation is presumed to be essential, resulting in &#945;&#8208;substituted&#8208;&#946;&#8208;dicarbonyls in 64&#8201;%&#8211;99&#8201;% yield in five minutes.







Abstract
The first systematic evaluation of the electrostatic potential energy maps of iodonium ylides was conducted. We determined that they possess two &#963;&#8208;holes of differing electron deficiencies, with the more electropositive &#963;&#8208;hole located opposite the dative I&#8722;C bond to the &#946;&#8208;dicarbonyl motif, and the lesser electropositive &#963;&#8208;hole located opposite the iodoarene C&#8722;I bond. We also conducted the first systematic evaluation of carboxylic acids, phenols and thiophenols in the O/S&#8208;alkylation reaction of iodonium ylides. While carboxylic acids and thiophenols were found to be generally viable, only phenols possessing electron&#8208;withdrawing substituents were effective. This high&#8208;yielding and highly chemoselective reaction is believed to involve halogen&#8208;bond activation of heteroatoms, and nicely complements existing diazo&#8208;based methods for alkylation of acidic functional groups.

         <title>Cluster&#8208;Based Crystalline Materials for Iodine Capture</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cluster&#8208;based crystalline materials play an important role in the field of iodine host&#8208;guest chemistry. This review summarizes the recent progress of different types of cluster&#8208;based materials (such as cluster&#8208;based MOFs with different cluster nodes, metal&#8208;organic cages, macrocyclic molecules, and cluster composites) for iodine capture. The research status, possible iodine capture mechanisms and prospects of such crystalline materials are discussed.







Abstract
The treatment of radioactive iodine in nuclear waste has always been a critical issue of social concern. The rational design of targeted and efficient capture materials is of great significance to the sustainable development of the ecological environment. In recent decades, crystalline materials have served as a molecular platform to study the binding process and capture mechanism of iodine molecules, enabling people to understand the interaction between radioactive iodine guests and pores intuitively. Cluster&#8208;based crystalline materials, including molecular clusters and cluster&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic frameworks, are emerging candidates for iodine capture due to their aggregative binding sites, precise structural information, tunable pores/packing patterns, and abundant modifications. Herein, recent progress of different types of cluster materials and cluster&#8208;dominated metal&#8208;organic porous materials for iodine capture is reviewed. Research prospects, design strategies to improve the affinity for iodine and possible capture mechanisms are discussed.

         <title>Small Molecule Tools to Study Cellular Target Engagement for the Intracellular Allosteric Binding Site of GPCRs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A druggable intracellular allosteric binding site (IABS) has recently been identified at several GPCRs. Ligands targeting the IABS are promising drugs and currently evaluated in several clinical trials. Herein, we review small molecule tools that enable an unambiguous identification and characterization of cellular target engagement for intracellular allosteric GPCR ligands.







Abstract
A conserved intracellular allosteric binding site (IABS) has recently been identified at several G protein&#8208;coupled receptors (GPCRs). Ligands targeting the IABS, so&#8208;called intracellular allosteric antagonists, are highly promising compounds for pharmaceutical intervention and currently evaluated in several clinical trials. Beside co&#8208;crystal structures that laid the foundation for the structure&#8208;based development of intracellular allosteric GPCR antagonists, small molecule tools that enable an unambiguous identification and characterization of intracellular allosteric GPCR ligands are of utmost importance for drug discovery campaigns in this field. Herein, we discuss recent approaches that leverage cellular target engagement studies for the IABS and thus play a critical role in the evaluation of IABS&#8208;targeted ligands as potential therapeutic agents.

         <title>Introduction of Ferrocene as a Facilitator for the Construction of Supramolecular Polymers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ferrocene assistant: The central ferrocene unit facilitates the designed monomer (1,n&#8242;&#8208;disubstituted ferrocene&#8208;azobenzene&#8208;long alkyl chains) to form supramolecular polymer (SP) by supporting higher enthalpy gain. The restricted rotational flexibility of ferrocene allows two azobenzene&#8208;dendritic arms to rotate freely, generating the best possible molecular conformation required for effective intermolecular interactions towards SP formation.







Abstract
Proper monomer design is the key to enhancing the strength of noncovalent interactions between the molecules toward the efficient formation of supramolecular polymers (SPs). We have designed and synthesized 1,n&#8242;&#8208;disubstituted ferrocene&#8208;azobenzene&#8208;long alkyl chains, Fc(CONH&#8208;Azo&#8208;TDP)2, to afford SPs with a high probability. The design exploits the &#8216;&#8216;molecular ball&#8208;bearing&#8217;&#8217; property of the ferrocene core, which allows two azobenzene arms to rotate in the planes of cyclopentadienyl rings, generating the most suitable molecular conformation required for SP formation. This ferrocene monomer formed a supergel consisting of SPs supported by strong intermolecular (H&#8208;bonding and &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking) interactions and higher enthalpy gain than the reference molecules, where the central ferrocene core was replaced by flexible aliphatic as well as rigid benzene linkers. The molecular conformation involved in SPs, the strength of noncovalent interactions, and the process of supramolecular polymerization were investigated through NMR, UV&#8208;Vis, XRD and TEM studies. The results demonstrate that ferrocene may act as a good modulator for constructing efficient SPs.

We have designed and synthesized 1,n&#8242;-disubstituted ferrocene-azobenzene-long alkyl chains, Fc(CONH-Azo-TDP)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, to afford SPs with a high probability. The design exploits the &#8216;&#8216;molecular ball-bearing&#8217;&#8217; property of the ferrocene core, which allows two azobenzene arms to rotate in the planes of cyclopentadienyl rings, generating the most suitable molecular conformation required for SP formation. This ferrocene monomer formed a supergel consisting of SPs supported by strong intermolecular (H-bonding and &#960;-&#960; stacking) interactions and higher enthalpy gain than the reference molecules, where the central ferrocene core was replaced by flexible aliphatic as well as rigid benzene linkers. The molecular conformation involved in SPs, the strength of noncovalent interactions, and the process of supramolecular polymerization were investigated through NMR, UV-Vis, XRD and TEM studies. The results demonstrate that ferrocene may act as a good modulator for constructing efficient SPs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Single&#8208;Metal&#8208;Encapsulated Double&#8208;Cage [Pt@Sn17]4&#8722;: An Exception from Group 14 Endohedral Clusters</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An experimentalist removes one Pt atom from the capsule&#8208;like [Pt2@Sn17]4&#8722; cluster lying on the conveyor that drags it through the computational frame. This deciphers an immediate transformation of the capsule&#8208;like architecture to the singly encapsulated double&#8208;cage structure in the reported [Pt@Sn17]4&#8722; cluster that arises due to the insufficient support of the inner metal atom and electron deficiency of the Ge framework.

         <title>Modulating CoFeOX Nanosheets Towards Enhanced CO2 Photoreduction to Syngas: Effect of Calcination Temperature and Mixed&#8208;Valence Multi&#8208;Metals</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The mixed valence state and nanosheet&#8208;like structure of CoFeOX cocatalyst support its ultra&#8208;high charge transfer, abundant CO2 active adsorption sites exposure, and thus outstanding photocatalytic CO2 reduction activity.







Abstract
CoFeOX nanosheets were synthesized by a facile coprecipitation and calcination method. The effect of calcination temperature on the crystal texture, morphology and surface areas of CoFeOX were fully explored. CoFeOX sample calcined at 600&#8201;&#176;C (CoFeOX&#8208;600) showed superior catalytic performance for the reduction of CO2 under visible light. Compared with the pure Ru(bpy)32+&#8208;sensitized CO2 reduction system, the CoFeOX&#8208;added system achieved 19&#8208;fold enhancement of CO production (45.7&#8197;&#956;mol/h). The mixed valence state and nanosheet&#8208;like structure of CoFeOX cocatalyst support its ultra&#8208;high charge transfer and abundant CO2 active adsorption sites exposure, which promote the separation of photogenerated charges, and thus improve the photocatalytic CO2 reduction activity. Carbon source of CO from CO2 was verified by 13CO2 isotopic labelling experiment. Repeated activity experiments confirmed the good stability of CoFeOX in the CO2 photoreduction system. This work would provide prospective insights into developing novel cost&#8208;effective, efficient, and durable non&#8208;precious metal cocatalysts to improve the efficiency of photocatalytic reduction of CO2.

         <title>Light&#8208;Responsive Oligothiophenes Incorporating Photochromic Torsional Switches</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel class of light&#8208;responsive &#960;&#8208;conjugated compounds incorporates photochromic torsional switches (PTS). These compounds are able to tune the planarization of their &#960;&#8208;conjugated backbone, and thus their optical and electronic properties, by using light as an external stimulus. The PTS unit is based on a bithiophene fragment linked to a photochromic azobenzene moiety. When this PTS&#8208;containing oligothiophene is not exposed to light, the azobenzene moiety assumes its extended trans conformation, which forces the oligothiophene backbone to twist out of coplanarity. Exposure to UV light results in isomerization to the cis conformation, which allows the bithiophene fragment to assume a planar, &#960;&#8208;conjugated conformation. More information can be found in the Research Article by D. Fazzi, E. Orentas, G. Sforazzini, and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202202698).

Cyclic alkyl(amino) carbene&#8208;anchored monoanionic phosphorus species have been introduced as the rising ligand to stabilize three unprecedented homo (AgI)&#8208; and mixed (Ag0/AgI)&#8208;valence silver nanoclusters Ag29, Ag12 and Ag8 in the solid state with defined structures. The neutral Ag29 and Ag8 clusters showed electron paramagnetic resonance at room temperature, whereas the green&#8208;emitting tri&#8208;cationic Ag12 cluster is diamagnetic and NMR active.

         <title>Dimorpholinoacetylene and Its Use for the Synthesis of Tetraaminocyclobutadiene Species</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A stable cyclobutadiene dication was isolated and structurally characterized as a bis(tribromide) salt. Unlike the folded minimum structure calculated for the parent C4H42+ system, this dication exhibits a planar geometry in the solid state. However, calculations reveal a nearly isoenergetic folded isomer, and detailed studies employing advanced NICS methods show that, counterintuitively, cyclobutadiene dications are more aromatic when puckered rather than planar. For more information on this topic and related applications of diaminoacetylenes, see the Research Article by M. Tamm and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202202737).

         <title>Long&#8208;Wavelength Light&#8208;Emitting Electrochemical Cells: Materials and Device Engineering</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Long&#8208;wavelength light&#8208;emitting electrochemical cells (LECs) are potential deep&#8208;red and near infrared light sources with solution&#8208;processable simple device architecture, low&#8208;voltage operation, and compatibility with inert metal electrodes. Many scientific efforts have been made to material design and device engineering of the long&#8208;wavelength LECs over the past two decades. The materials designed the for long&#8208;wavelength LECs cover ionic transition metal complexes, small molecules, conjugated polymers, and perovskites. On the other hand, device engineering techniques, including spectral modification via adjusting microcavity effect, light outcoupling enhancement, energy down&#8208;conversion from color conversion layers, and adjusting intermolecular interactions, are also helpful in improving the device performance of long&#8208;wavelength LECs. In this review, recent advances in the long&#8208;wavelength LECs are reviewed from the viewpoints of materials and device engineering. Finally, discussions on conclusion and outlook indicate possible directions for future developments of the long&#8208;wavelength LECs. This review would like to pave the way for the researchers to design materials and device engineering techniques for the long&#8208;wavelength LECs in the applications of displays, bio&#8208;imaging, telecommunication, and night&#8208;vision displays.</dc:description>

         <title>Controlled Formation of Porous 2D Lattices from C3 Symmetric Ph6&#8208;Me&#8208;Tribenzotriquinacene&#8208;OAc3</title>

         <dc:description>The on&#8208;surface self&#8208;assembly of molecules to form holey nanographenes is a promising approach for the control of the properties of the resulting 2D lattice. Usually, planar molecules are utilized to prepare flat, structurally confined molecular layers, with only a few recent examples of warped precursors. However, control of the superstructures is limited thus far. Herein, we report on the temperature&#8208;controlled self&#8208;assembly of a bowl&#8208;shaped, acetylated C 3 &#8208;symmetric hexaphenyltribenzotriquinacene derivative on Cu(111). Combining scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and density functional theory (DFT) confirms the formation of highly differing arrangements starting with &#960;&#8208;stacked bowl&#8208;to&#8208;bowl dimers at low coverage at room temperature via chiral honeycomb structures, an intermediate trigonal superstructure, followed by a fully carbon&#8208;based, flattened hexagonal superstructure formed by on&#8208;surface deacetylation, which is proposed as a precursor for holey graphene networks with unique defect structures.</dc:description>

         <title>Complexation Preferences of Dynamic Constitutional Frameworks as Adaptive Gene Vectors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The growing applications of therapeutic nucleic acids requires the concomitant development of vectors that are optimized to complex one type of nucleic acid, forming nanoparticles suitable for further trafficking and delivery. While fine&#8208;tuning a vector by molecular engineering to obtain a particular nanoscale organization at the nanoparticle level can be a challenging endeavor, we turned the situation around and instead screened the complexation preferences of dynamic constitutional frameworks toward different types of DNAs. Dynamic constitutional frameworks (DCF) are recently&#8208;identified vectors by our group that can be prepared in a versatile manner through dynamic covalent chemistry. Herein, we designed and synthesized 40 new DCFs that vary in hydrophilic/hydrophobic balance, number of cationic headgroups. The results of DNA complexation obtained through gel electrophoresis and fluorescent displacement assays reveal binding preferences of different DCFs toward different DNAs. The formation of compact spherical architectures with an optimal diameter of 100&#8208;200 nm suggests that condensation into nanoparticles is more effective for longer PEG chains and PEI groups that induce a better binding performance in the presence of DNA targets.</dc:description>

         <title>A triazolium&#8208;anchored self&#8208;immolative linker enables self&#8208;assembly&#8208;driven siRNA binding and esterase&#8208;induced release</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The increased importance of RNA&#8208;based therapeutics&#160;comes with a need to develop next&#8208;generation stimuli&#8208;responsive&#160;systems capable of binding, transporting and releasing RNA&#160;oligomers. In this work, we describe triazolium&#8208;based amphiphiles&#160;capable of siRNA binding and enzyme&#8208;responsive release of the&#160;nucleic acid payload. In aqueous medium, the amphiphile selfassembles&#160;into nanocarriers that can disintegrate upon the addition of&#160;esterase. Key to the molecular design is a self&#8208;immolative linker that&#160;is anchored to the triazolium moiety and acts as a positively&#8208;charged&#160;polar head group. We demonstrate that addition of esterase leads to&#160;a degradation cascade of the linker, leaving the neutral triazole&#160;compound unable to form complexes and therefore releasing the&#160;negatively&#8208;charged siRNA. The reported molecular design and overall&#160;approach may have broad utility beyond this proof &#8208;of&#8208;principle study,&#160;because the underlying CuAAC &#8220;click&#8221; chemistry allows bringing&#160;together three groups very efficiently as well as cleaving off one of the&#160;three groups under the mild action of an esterase enzyme.</dc:description>

         <title>Towards Luminescent Vanadium(II) Complexes with Slow Magnetic Relaxation and Quantum Coherence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Molecular entities with doublet or triplet ground states find increasing interest as potential molecular quantum bits (qubits). Complexes with higher multiplicity might even function as qudits and serve to encode further quantum bits. Vanadium(II) ions in octahedral ligand fields with quartet ground states and small zero&#8208;field splittings qualify as qubits with optical read out thanks to potentially luminescent spin&#8208;flip states. We identified two V2+ complexes [V(ddpd)2]2+ with the strong field ligand N,N&#8217;&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;N,N&#8217;&#8208;dipyridine&#8208;2&#8208;yl&#8208;pyridine&#8208;2,6&#8208;diamine (ddpd) in two isomeric forms (cis&#8208;fac and mer) as suitable candidates. The energy gaps between the two lowest Kramers doublets amount to 0.2 and 0.5 cm&#8211;1 allowing pulsed EPR experiments at conventional Q&#8208;band frequencies (35 GHz). Both isomers possess spin&#8208;lattice relaxation times T1 of around 300 &#181;s and a phase memory time TM of around 1 &#181;s at 5 K. Furthermore, the mer isomer displays slow magnetic relaxation in an applied field of 400 mT. While the vanadium(III) complexes [V(ddpd)2]3+ are emissive in the near&#8208;IR&#8208;II region, the [V(ddpd)2]2+ complexes are non&#8208;luminescent due metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge transfer admixture to the spin&#8208;flip states.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The practical application of lithium&#8722;sulfur (Li&#8722;S) batteries is greatly hindered by the shuttle effect of dissolved polysulfides in the sulfur cathode and the severe dendritic growth in the lithium anode. Adopting one type of effective host with dual&#8208;functions including both inhibiting polysulfide dissolution and regulating Li plating/stripping, is recently an emerging&#160;research highlight in Li&#8722;S battery. This review focuses on such dual&#8208;functional hosts and systematically summarizes the recent research progress and application scenarios. Firstly, this review briefly describes the stubborn issues in Li&#8722;S battery operations and the sophisticated counter measurements over the challenges by dual&#8208;functional behaviors. Then, the latest advances on dual&#8208;functional hosts for both cathode and anode in Li&#8722;S full cells are catalogued as species, including metal chalcogenides, metal carbides, metal nitrides, heterojunctions, and the possible mechanisms during the process. Besides, we also outlined the theoretical calculation tools for the dual&#8208;functional host based on the first principles. Finally, several sound perspectives are also rationally proposed for fundamental research and practical development as guidelines.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Direct oxidative coupling of inert C(sp3)&#8208;H bond has been a great challenge. Herein, an environmentally friendly aerobic oxidative coupling of &#945;&#8208;methyl substituted N&#8208;heteroarenes with indoles was reported. A vareity of diheteroaryl ketones were prepared in good yileds (up to 72%). This protocol features simple operation and broad substrates scope (26 examples). Significantly, a plausible mechanism about catalytic cycle was proposed, and two key intermediates were confirmed by high resolution mass spectrometry.</dc:description>

         <title>Revealing Phosphorus Nitrides up to the Megabar Regime: Synthesis of &#945;&#8242;&#8208;P3N5, &#948;&#8208;P3N5 and PN2</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 62, November 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Phase in, phase out: Investigations of the phosphorus&#8211;nitrogen system in a laser&#8208;heated diamond anvil cell resulted in the synthesis of new &#948;&#8208;P3N5 and PN2 phases at 72 and 134&#8197;GPa, respectively. Their structures are composed of PN6 octahedra. Upon decompression, &#948;&#8208;P3N5 transforms into the novel &#945;&#8242;&#8208;P3N5 solid that is stable under ambient conditions.







Abstract
Non&#8208;metal nitrides are an exciting field of chemistry, featuring a significant number of compounds that can possess outstanding material properties. These properties mainly rely on maximizing the number of strong covalent bonds, with crosslinked XN6 octahedra frameworks being particularly attractive. In this study, the phosphorus&#8211;nitrogen system was studied up to 137&#8197;GPa in laser&#8208;heated diamond anvil cells, and three previously unobserved phases were synthesized and characterized by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy measurements and density functional theory calculations. &#948;&#8208;P3N5 and PN2 were found to form at 72 and 134&#8197;GPa, respectively, and both feature dense 3D networks of the so far elusive PN6 units. The two compounds are ultra&#8208;incompressible, having a bulk modulus of K0=322&#8197;GPa for &#948;&#8208;P3N5 and 339&#8197;GPa for PN2. Upon decompression below 7&#8197;GPa, &#948;&#8208;P3N5 undergoes a transformation into a novel &#945;&#8242;&#8208;P3N5 solid, stable at ambient conditions, that has a unique structure type based on PN4 tetrahedra. The formation of &#945;&#8242;&#8208;P3N5 underlines that a phase space otherwise inaccessible can be explored through materials formed under high pressure.

         <title>Proteophenes &#8211; Amino Acid Functionalized Thiophene&#8208;based Fluorescent Ligands for Visualization of Protein Deposits in Tissue Sections with Alzheimer's Disease Pathology</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 62, November 7, 2022. </description>

Proteophenes. A palette of fluorescent thiophene&#8208;based ligands with distinct amino acid side&#8208;chain functionalities along the conjugated backbone was synthesized. Ligands with specific side&#8208;chain functionalities displayed selectivity towards distinct protein aggregates in tissue sections with Alzheimer's disease pathology. We foresee that proteophenes will significantly expand the toolbox of ligands for fluorescent assignment of disease&#8208;associated protein aggregates.







Abstract
Protein deposits composed of specific proteins or peptides are associated with several neurodegenerative diseases and fluorescent ligands able to detect these pathological hallmarks are vital. Here, we report the synthesis of a class of thiophene&#8208;based ligands, denoted proteophenes, with different amino acid side&#8208;chain functionalities along the conjugated backbone, which display selectivity towards specific disease&#8208;associated protein aggregates in tissue sections with Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology. The selectivity of the ligands towards AD associated pathological hallmarks, such as aggregates of the amyloid&#8208;&#946; (A&#946;) peptide or tau filamentous inclusions, was highly dependent on the chemical nature of the amino acid functionality, as well as on the location of the functionality along the pentameric thiophene backbone. Finally, the concept of synthesizing donor&#8208;acceptor&#8208;donor proteophenes with distinct photophysical properties was shown. Our findings provide the structural and functional basis for the development of new thiophene&#8208;based ligands that can be utilized for optical assignment of different aggregated proteinaceous species in tissue sections.

Combustion time! The synthesis of a &#948;&#8208;ketohydroperoxide is described, addressing the compatibilities of ketones and hydroperoxides in these elusive combustion&#8208;relevant species. The hydroperoxide is installed through sulfonylhydrazine substitution, in which it is found that 1,2&#8208;dimethoxyethane is an advantageous medium for the transformation. The synthesis is scalable and safe, providing material for future chemical kinetics studies.







Abstract
A synthesis of a &#948;&#8208;ketohydroperoxide is described, addressing potential functional&#8208;group compatibilities in these elusive species relevant to combustion and atmospheric chemistries. The hydroperoxide is installed via sulfonylhydrazine substitution, which was found to be more effective than displacement of secondary halides. As part of this protocol, it was observed that 1,2&#8208;dimethoxyethane is an advantageous medium for the reaction, avoiding the formation of a tetrahydrofuran hydroperoxide side product. This discovery facilitated the multigram synthesis (6&#8197;steps, 41&#8201;% yield overall) and discrete characterization of the target &#948;&#8208;ketohydroperoxide.

Stereocontrol: We have studied the enantioselective transannular aminohalogenation of unsaturated medium&#8208;sized cyclic benzosulfonamides by using both chiral Br&#248;nsted acid and phase&#8208;transfer catalysis. The mechanism of the reaction was also studied by using computational tools; we observed that the key step for stereocontrol involves the participation of an interconverting planar chiral conformer of the nine&#8208;membered cyclic starting material







Abstract
We have studied the enantioselective transannular aminohalogenation reaction of unsaturated medium&#8208;sized cyclic benzosulfonamides by using both chiral Br&#248;nsted acid and phase&#8208;transfer catalysis. Under optimized conditions, a variety of bicyclic adducts can be obtained with good yields and high enantioselectivities. The mechanism of the reaction was also studied by using computational tools; we observed that the reaction involves the participation of a conformer of the nine&#8208;membered cyclic substrate with planar chirality in which the stereochemical outcome is controlled by the relative reactivity of the two pseudorotational enantiomers when interacting with the chiral catalyst.

         <title>Two Tags in One Probe: Combining Fluorescence&#8208; and Biotin&#8208;based Detection of the Trypanosomal Cysteine Protease Rhodesain</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 62, November 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly potent, bimodal activity&#8208;based probe for the therapeutically relevant cysteine protease rhodesain was developed. We utilized two different access points at the coumarin fluorophore for incorporation of the rhodesain inhibitor part and the biotin affinity label. The two reporter tags were employed for on&#8208;blot chemiluminescence detection and affinity purification as well as post&#8208;labeling quantification of the target protein by size exclusion chromatography with fluorescence detection.







Abstract
Rhodesain is the major cysteine protease of the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma brucei and a therapeutic target for sleeping sickness, a fatal neglected tropical disease. We designed, synthesized and characterized a bimodal activity&#8208;based probe that binds to and inactivates rhodesain. This probe exhibited an irreversible mode of action and extraordinary potency for the target protease with a kinac/Ki value of 37,000&#8197;M&#8722;1s&#8722;1. Two reporter tags, a fluorescent coumarin moiety and a biotin affinity label, were incorporated into the probe and enabled highly sensitive detection of rhodesain in a complex proteome by in&#8208;gel fluorescence and on&#8208;blot chemiluminescence. Furthermore, the probe was employed for microseparation and quantification of rhodesain and for inhibitor screening using a competition assay. The developed bimodal rhodesain probe represents a new proteomic tool for studying Trypanosoma pathobiochemistry and antitrypanosomal drug discovery.

         <title>Metalloenzyme&#8208;Mediated Thiol&#8208;Yne Addition Towards Photoisomerizable Fluorescent Dyes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 62, November 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A regioselective metalloenzyme&#8208;directed synthesis of a vinyl sulfide&#8208;based inhibitor, which has shown to be involved in an unexpected Z to E photoisomerization process, is reported. Tuning of the spectral features guided by theoretical studies revealed structural modifications for effective bidirectional photoconversion of thermally bistable vinyl sulfide diastereoisomers, while maintaining the high biological activity of the parent inhibitor.







Abstract
Proteins are able to irreversibly assemble biologically active ligands from building blocks bearing complementary reactive functions due their spatial proximity, through a kinetic target&#8208;guided synthetic process (also named in&#8197;situ click chemistry). Although linkages thus formed are mostly passive, some of them have shown to significantly contribute to the protein binding through for instance hydrogen bonding and stacking interactions. Biocompatible reactions and click chemistry are a formidable source of inspiration for developing such new protein&#8208;directed ligations. This study reports a proximity&#8208;induced thiol&#8208;yne synthesis of carbonic anhydrase inhibitors. Not only this example widens the arsenal of kinetic target&#8208;guided synthesis (KTGS) eligible reactions, but the obtained product displayed unsuspected photophysical properties. The corresponding vinyl sulfide linkage conjugated to a coumarin core proved to be engaged in a monodirectional Z to E photoisomerization process. Further investigations guided by theoretical calculations showed that fine&#8208;tuning of the nature of the substituents on the coumarin moiety allows to obtain a bidirectional photochemical process, thus discovering a new photoswitching moiety, displaying moreover fluorescence properties. Due to the spectral tunability of coumarin derivatives, this work should open new opportunities for the design of vinyl sulfide&#8208;based photoswitch systems with modular photophysical properties.

         <title>Boosting the Enantioselectivity of Conjugate Borylation of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;Disubstituted Cyclobutenones with Monooxides of Chiral C2&#8208;Symmetric Bis(phosphine) Ligands</title>

A chiral bis(phosphine) monooxide (BPMO) derived from a C2&#8208;symmetric bis(phosphine) ligand does magic to the copper&#8208;catalyzed conjugate borylation of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;disubstituted cyclobutenones. Yields and levels of stereoselection, especially enantioselectivity, are exceedingly high (see scheme).







Abstract
Chiral bis(phosphine) monooxides (BPMOs) derived from C2&#8208;symmetric bis(phosphines) have been found to induce superior levels of enantioselection in copper&#8208;catalyzed conjugate borylation of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;disubstituted cyclobutenones. More precisely, enantiomeric excesses as well as chemical yields are exceedingly high with (R,R)&#8208;Bozphos as the chiral ligand while these values are low with parent (R,R)&#8208;Me&#8208;Duphos. A similar yet less pronounced effect was seen in the corresponding 1,6&#8208;addition to para&#8208;quinone methides.

         <title>Synthesis of Cage&#8208;Shaped Borates Bearing Pyrenylmethyl Groups: Efficient Lewis Acid Catalyst for Photoactivated Glycosylations Driven by Intramolecular Excimer Formation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 62, November 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cage&#8208;shaped borate 3aB having pyrenylmethyl groups was synthesized. The obtained 3aB functioned as a photoactivated Lewis acid catalyst. The photoactivation originates from the deformation of the cage&#8208;shaped scaffold driven by intramolecular excimer formations of the pyrenes, allowing the catalytic O&#8208;glycosylation using glycosyl fluorides to proceed with a high efficiency.







Abstract
We describe the synthesis and characterization of a photoactivated boron&#8208;based Lewis acid catalyst based on a cage&#8208;shaped triphenolic ligand with three pyrenylmethyl moieties. The obtained cage&#8208;shaped borate functioned as a photoactivated Lewis acid catalyst thanks to the flexible three pyrenylmethyl moieties. The deformation of the cage&#8208;shaped scaffold driven by intramolecular excimer formations of the pyrenes is a critical factor in realizing the photoactivation. Mannich&#8208;type reactions and glycosylations significantly were accelerated under 370&#8197;nm light irradiations. It is noteworthy that various glycosyl fluorides, which are not easily activated in photocatalytic systems due to their high C&#8722;F bond stability, are activated by the photoimproved catalytic activity of the catalyst.

         <title>Bimetallic Ruthenium Nitrosyl Complexes with Enhanced Two&#8208;Photon Absorption Properties for Nitric Oxide Delivery</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 62, November 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nitric oxide delivery: A series of bimetallic RuNO complexes with quadrupolar electronic structures exhibit TPA cross&#8208;section up to 1523&#8197;GM under irradiation at &#955;=700&#8197;nm, in the therapeutic window of transparency of biological tissues. The biologically active nitric oxide radical (NO&#8901;) is released in any case.







Abstract
One monometallic and three bimetallic ruthenium nitrosyl (RuNO) complexes are presented and fully characterized in reference to a parent monometallic complex of formula [FTRu(bpy)(NO)]3+, where FT is a fluorenyl&#8208;substituted terpyridine ligand, and bpy the 2,2&#8217;&#8208;bipyridine. These new complexes are built with the new ligands FFT, TFT, TFFT, and TF&#8208;CC&#8208;TF (where an alkyne C&#8801;C group is inserted between two fluorenes). The crystal structures of the bis&#8208;RuNO2 and bis&#8208;RuNO complexes built from the TFT ligand are presented.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Nitric oxide delivery&lt;/b&gt;: A series of bimetallic RuNO complexes with quadrupolar electronic structures exhibit TPA cross-section up to 1523&#8197;GM under irradiation at &lt;i&gt;&#955;&lt;/i&gt;=700&#8197;nm, in the therapeutic window of transparency of biological tissues. The biologically active nitric oxide radical (NO&#8901;) is released in any case.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One monometallic and three bimetallic ruthenium nitrosyl (RuNO) complexes are presented and fully characterized in reference to a parent monometallic complex of formula [FTRu(bpy)(NO)]&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;, where FT is a fluorenyl-substituted terpyridine ligand, and bpy the 2,2&#8217;-bipyridine. These new complexes are built with the new ligands FFT, TFT, TFFT, and TF-CC-TF (where an alkyne C&#8801;C group is inserted between two fluorenes). The crystal structures of the bis-RuNO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and bis-RuNO complexes built from the TFT ligand are presented. The evolution of the spectroscopic features (intensities and energies) along the series, at one-photon absorption (OPA) correlates well with the TD-DFT computations. A spectacular effect is observed at two-photon absorption (TPA) with a large enhancement of the molecular cross-section (&lt;i&gt;&#963;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;TPA&lt;/sub&gt;), in the bimetallic species. In the best case, &lt;i&gt;&#963;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;TPA&lt;/sub&gt; is equal to 1523&#177;98&#8197;GM at 700&#8197;nm, in the therapeutic window of transparency of biological tissues. All compounds are capable of releasing NO&#8901; under irradiation, which leads to promising applications in TPA-based drug delivery.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Macrocyclic Furan with Accessible Oxidation States: Switching Between Aromatic and Antiaromatic Global Ring Currents</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 62, November 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first macrocyclic furan with accessible oxidation states was synthesized using a post&#8208;macrocyclization approach. It exhibits low oxidation potentials, and switching between antiaromatic and aromatic global ring currents upon oxidation.







Abstract
Macrocyclic furans are predicted to switch between global aromaticity and antiaromaticity, depending on their oxidation states. However, the macrocyclic furans reported to date are stabilized by electron withdrawing groups, which result in inaccessible oxidation states. To circumvent this problem, a post&#8208;macrocyclization approach was applied to introduce methylene&#8208;substituted macrocyclic furans, which display an extremely low oxidation potential of &#8722;0.23 vs. Fc/Fc+, and are partially oxidized in ambient conditions. Additional oxidation to the dication results in aromaticity switching to a global 30&#960;e&#8722; aromatic state, as indicated by the formation of a strong diatropic current observed in the 1H&#8197;NMR spectrum. NICS and ACID calculations support this trend and provide evidence for a different pathway for the global current in the neutral and dicationic states. According to these findings, macrocyclic furans can be rendered as promising p&#8208;type materials with stable oxidation states.

         <title>Supramolecular Architecture of an Amphiphilic Amino Alcohol as a Versatile Chiral Environment for Stereocontrolled Photoreaction of Various Anthracenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 62, November 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Supramolecular architecture of an amphiphilic amino alcohol serves as unprecedentedly versatile chiral environment, which can efficiently control the stereochemistry of the self&#8208;photocyclodimerization of various anthracenes (71&#8211;98&#8201;% regio ratio, 76&#8211;86&#8201;% ee) as well as the cross&#8208;photocyclodimerization between two anthracenes (58&#8201;% chemo ratio, 83&#8201;% regio ratio, 90&#8201;% ee).







Abstract
The photocyclodimerization of 2&#8208;anthracenecarboxylic acid has been extensively studied as a model reaction of asymmetric photochemistry. So far, numerous chiral environments have been employed to control this photoreaction, while the scope of photoreactants has been limited only to 2&#8208;anthracenecarboxylic acid and its simple esters and amides. Here, we developed a systematic series of photoreactants (2&#8201;a&#8211;d) by introducing various substituents to 2&#8208;anthracenecarboxylic acid, which showed different reactivities and selectivities depending on the substituents. By using the photoreactants 2&#8201;a&#8211;d, we evaluated the performance of a chiral environment composed of an amphiphilic amino alcohol (1), where the photocyclodimerization of 2&#8201;a&#8211;d generally proceeded in excellent regio&#8208; and enantioselectivities (71&#8211;98&#8201;% regio ratio, 76&#8211;86&#8201;% ee). Furthermore, by reacting 2&#8201;a and 2&#8201;b together in the chiral environment of 1, we succeeded in the first stereocontrolled cross&#8208;photocyclodimerization between two prochiral anthracenes (58&#8201;% chemo ratio, 83&#8201;% regio ratio, 90&#8201;% ee).

         <title>Phosphine&#8208;Functionalized Syndiotactic Polystyrenes: Synthesis and Application to Immobilization of Transition Metal Nanoparticle Catalysts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 62, November 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel phosphine&#8208;functionalized syndiotactic polystyrenes composed of o&#8208;diphenylphosphinostyrene and styrene alternating copolymer block and syndiotactic polystyrene block prepared by the copolymerization of o&#8208;diphenylphosphinostyrene with styrene using (C5Me4SiMe3)Sc(CH2C6H4NMe2&#8208;o)2 showed not only thermal stability and chemical (solvent) resistance, but also excellent performance of immobilization of transition metal nanoparticle catalysts.







Abstract
The precise control of monomer sequence and stereochemistry in copolymerization is of much interest and importance for the synthesis of high performance materials, but studies toward this goal have met with only limited success to date. The coordination polymerization of diphenylphosphinostyrene (p&#8208;StPPh2 and o&#8208;StPPh2) and its copolymerization with styrene (St) by (C5Me4SiMe3)Sc(CH2C6H4NMe2&#8208;o)2 have been achieved for the first time to afford a new series of phosphine functionalized syndiotactic polystyrene. By the design of the polymer structure, the copolymer of o&#8208;StPPh2 and St (poly(o&#8208;StPPh2&#8208;alt&#8208;St)&#8208;b&#8208;sPS) containing o&#8208;StPPh2 and St atactic alternating copolymer block and syndiotactic polystyrene block (sPS) showed excellent thermal stability and chemical resistance. The simple combination of the triphenylphosphine and syndiotactic polystyrene realized the stable immobilization of metal nanoparticles to afford highly robust metal@poly(o&#8208;StPPh2&#8208;alt&#8208;St)&#8208;b&#8208;sPS nanocatalysts at high temperature and various atmospheres. The Cu@poly(o&#8208;StPPh2&#8208;alt&#8208;St)&#8208;b&#8208;sPS catalyst can serve as a highly efficient heterogeneous catalyst for the synthesis of quinoline derivatives by acceptorless dehydrogenative coupling of o&#8208;aminobenzylalcohol with ketones.

         <title>Directing the Self&#8208;Assembly of Aromatic Foldamer Helices using Acridine Appendages and Metal Coordination</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 62, November 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aromatic foldamers helices constitute convenient rigid scaffolds but rarely form ordered arrays upon self&#8208;assembly or in crystals. We show that placing acridine appendages at defined position at the surface of aromatic helices guide their organization in the solid state to form discrete dimers or 1D arrays. Furthermore, metal&#8208;coordination at the acridine units of the same compounds drives self&#8208;assembly in solution.







Abstract
Folded molecules provide complex interaction interfaces amenable to sophisticated self&#8208;assembly motifs. Because of their high conformational stability, aromatic foldamers constitute suitable candidates for the rational elaboration of self&#8208;assembled architectures. Several multiturn helical aromatic oligoamides have been synthesized that possess arrays of acridine appendages pointing in one or two directions. The acridine units were shown to direct self&#8208;assembly in the solid state via aromatic stacking leading to recurrent helix&#8208;helix association patterns under the form of discrete dimers or extended arrays. In the presence of Pd(II), metal coordination of the acridine units overwhelms other forces and generates new metal&#8208;mediated multihelical self&#8208;assemblies, including macrocycles. These observations demonstrate simple access to different types of foldamer&#8208;containing architectures, ranging from discrete objects to 1D and, by extension, 2D and 3D arrays.

         <title>Dehydrocoupling Polymerization: Poly(silylether) Synthesis by Using an Iron &#946;&#8208;Diketiminate Catalyst</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 62, November 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient iron catalyzed method for the formation of poly(silylether)s has been developed, where the only by&#8208;product of the reaction is hydrogen gas. Fourteen different polymers have been prepared, which show a range of different thermal properties. Insight into the reaction, which proceeds via a condensation polymerization mechanism is provided.







Abstract
We describe the iron&#8208;catalyzed polymerizations of diol and silane monomers to obtain fourteen different poly(silylether) products with number average molecular weights (Mn) up to 36.3&#8197;kDa. The polymerization reactions developed in this study are operationally simple and applicable to 1&#176; and 2&#176; silane monomer substrates and a range of benzylic and aliphatic diol substrates as well as one polyol example. The polymers were characterized by IR spectroscopy, DSC and TGA and, where solubility allowed, 1H, 13C{1H}, 29Si{1H} NMR spectroscopies, GPC and MALDI&#8208;TOF were also employed. The materials obtained displayed low Tg values (&#8722;70.6 to 19.1&#8201;&#176;C) and were stable upon heating up to T&#8211;5%,Ar 421.6&#8201;&#176;C. A trend in T&#8211;5%,Ar was observed whereby use of a 2&#176; silane leads to higher T&#8211;5%,Ar compared to those obtained using a 1&#176; silane. Reaction monitoring was undertaken by in situ gas evolution studies coupled with GPC analysis to follow the progression of chain&#8208;length growth which confirmed a condensation polymerization&#8208;type mechanism.

         <title>Iron&#8208;Catalyzed Cross&#8208;Coupling of Thioesters and Organomanganese Reagents
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 62, November 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
This article discloses the development of an iron(III)&#8208;catalyzed coupling of thioesters with aliphatic organomanganese reagents. The good functional group tolerance resulted in successful transformation of a range of thioesters, including biologically relevant compounds. The presence of accessible &#946;&#8208;hydrogen atom in the organomanganese reagent seems crucial for an effective catalyst activation. The liberated thiolate stabilizes the generated alkylferrate(II) species.







Abstract
We report a Fukuyama&#8208;type coupling of thioesters with aliphatic organomanganese reagents utilizing a cheap and easily available iron(III) precatalyst. The reactions exhibit a wide tolerance of solvents and functional groups, allowing for the conversion of thioesters derived from natural products and pharmaceutical compounds. A strong steric impact from each reaction component (carboxylic moiety, thiol substituent and manganese reagent) was displayed, which enabled regioselective transformation of dithioesters. Mechanistic investigations showed that the released thiolate does not act as a mere spectator ligand, but rather positively influences the stability of intermediate alkyl(II)ferrates.

         <title>Experimental and Theoretical Investigation of an Azaoxyallyl Cation&#8208;Templated Intramolecular Aryl Amination Leading to Oxindole Derivatives</title>

A detailed investigation on the reactivity of &#945;&#8208;arylated azaoxyallyl cation undergoing intramolecular nucleophilic aryl&#8208;amination under catalyst&#8208;free conditions is presented. Azaoxyallyl cation&#8208;guided ortho&#8208;activation of the adjacent aromatic ring is central to this process aided by HFIP. This reaction manifold offers broad access to oxindole derivatives.







Abstract
Herein, development and detailed investigation of a SN&#8242;&#8208;type intramolecular aromatic substitution reaction involving &#945;&#8208;arylazaoxyallyl cation intermediate, is disclosed. The study showcased that while &#945;&#8208;aryl&#8208;&#945;&#8208;chlorohydroxamate could be activated by a combination of base and 1,1,1,3,3,3&#8208;hexafluoro&#8208;2&#8208;propanol (HFIP) into the corresponding azaoxyallyl cations, it could further emerge into a &#960;&#8208;extended species involving the adjacent &#945;&#8208;aryl moiety, and this transition is contingent on electronic effects of the aromatic ring as well as on &#945;&#8208;substituents. An effective activation of the &#945;&#8208;aromatic ring could pave the path for intramolecular Ar(Csp2)&#8208;N bond formation towards oxindoles. Control experiments and DFT calculations suggested that a non&#8208;pericyclic nucleophilic amination pathway is most likely operative and precluded the possibility of concerted or electrophilic amination mechanism. HFIP as the reaction solvent plays pivotal roles in the transformation.

         <title>[Nb@Ge13/14]3&#8722;: New Family Members of Ge&#8208;Based Intermetalloid Clusters</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 62, November 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two new clusters [Nb@Ge13]3&#8722; and [Nb@Ge14]3&#8722; were successfully synthesized; they represent the first 13&#8208; and 14&#8208;vertex endohedral Ge cages. HOMO&#8208;2 orbital of [Nb@Ge13]3&#8722; (left) shows a bonding character with respect to the shortest Nb&#8722;Ge contact, whereas the analogous HOMO&#8208;2 orbital of [Nb@Ge14]3&#8722; (right) shows anti&#8208;bonding character over the related fragment.







Abstract
During the past two decades, single&#8208;atom&#8208;centered medium&#8208;sized germanium clusters [M@Gen] (M=transition metals, n&gt;12) have been extensively explored, both from theoretical perspectives and experimental gas&#8208;phase syntheses. However, the actual structural arrangements of the Ge13 and Ge14 endohedral cages are still ambiguous and have long remained an unresolved problem for experimental implementation. In this work, we successfully synthesize 13&#8208;/14&#8208;vertex Ge clusters [Nb@Ge13]3&#8722; (1) and [Nb@Ge14]3&#8722; (2), which are structurally characterized and exhibit unprecedented topologies, neither classical deltahedra nor 3&#8208;connected polyhedral structures. Theoretical analysis indicates that the major stabilization of the Ge backbones arises due to the substantial interaction of Ge 4p&#8208;AOs with the endohedral Nb 4d&#8208;AOs through three/four&#8208;center two&#8208;electron bonds with an enhanced electron density accumulated over the shortest Nb&#8722;Ge13 contact in 1. Low occupancies of the direct two&#8208;center two&#8208;electron (2c&#8211;2e) Nb&#8722;Ge and Ge&#8722;Ge &#963; bonds point to a considerable degree of electron delocalization over the Ge cages revealing their electron deficiency.

&lt;p&gt;During the past two decades, single-atom-centered medium-sized germanium clusters [M@Ge&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;] (M=transition metals, n&amp;gt;12) have been extensively explored, both from theoretical perspectives and experimental gas-phase syntheses. However, the actual structural arrangements of the Ge&lt;sub&gt;13&lt;/sub&gt; and Ge&lt;sub&gt;14&lt;/sub&gt; endohedral cages are still ambiguous and have long remained an unresolved problem for experimental implementation. In this work, we successfully synthesize 13-/14-vertex Ge clusters [Nb@Ge&lt;sub&gt;13&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;3&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; (&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;) and [Nb@Ge&lt;sub&gt;14&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;3&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; (&lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;), which are structurally characterized and exhibit unprecedented topologies, neither classical deltahedra nor 3-connected polyhedral structures. Theoretical analysis indicates that the major stabilization of the Ge backbones arises due to the substantial interaction of Ge 4&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;-AOs with the endohedral Nb 4&lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt;-AOs through three/four-center two-electron bonds with an enhanced electron density accumulated over the shortest Nb&#8722;Ge13 contact in &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;. Low occupancies of the direct two-center two-electron (2c&#8211;2e) Nb&#8722;Ge and Ge&#8722;Ge &#963; bonds point to a considerable degree of electron delocalization over the Ge cages revealing their electron deficiency.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Photostable NIR&#8208;II Pigments from Extended Rylenecarboximides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 62, November 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of organic near infrared (NIR) absorbers based on rylenecarboximide and anthraquinone were obtained with maximum absorption peaks ranging from 870&#8197;nm to 1100&#8197;nm. A photostable pigment with NIR&#8208;II absorption was developed through de&#8208;alkylation reaction under formation of intermolecular hydrogen bonds.







Abstract
A series of near&#8208;infrared (NIR) organic absorbers, named FNs and FPs, have been obtained with absorption maxima from 870&#8197;nm to 1100&#8197;nm and thus falling into the attractive second near&#8208;infrared region (NIR&#8208;II). The synthesis of their extended aromatic cores utilized an initial aryl&#8208;amination between 4&#8208;aminonaphthalene&#8208;1,8&#8208;dicarboximide (NMI&#8208;NH2) or 9&#8208;aminoperylene&#8208;3,4&#8208;dicarboximide (PMI&#8208;NH2) with chloro&#8208;substituted 9,10&#8208;anthraquinones followed by a novel base&#8208;induced cyclodehydrogenation. A NIR&#8208;II pigment, compound FPP, was obtained through de&#8208;alkylation of a soluble precursor. The synthesis of this photostable pigment is high&#8208;yielding and avoids column chromatographic purification which is important for many applications.

&#960;&#8208;Extended Azaborole Helicenes. A unique set of &#960;&#8208;extended azaborole helicenes, assembled from N&#8208;heteroaromatic and dibenzo[g,p]chrysene building blocks, shows excellent optical properties. The lateral and helical extensions of the helicene scaffold significantly enhanced emission quantum yields and dissymmetry factors.







Abstract
The synthesis and characterization of laterally extended azabora[5]&#8208;, &#8208;[6]&#8208; and &#8208;[7]helicenes, assembled from N&#8208;heteroaromatic and dibenzo[g,p]chrysene building blocks is described. Formally, the &#960;&#8208;conjugated systems of the pristine azaborole helicenes were enlarged with a phenanthrene unit leading to compounds with large Stokes shifts, significantly enhanced luminescence quantum yields (&#934;) and dissymmetry factors (glum). The beneficial effect on optical properties was also observed for helical elongation. The combined contributions of lateral and helical extensions resulted in a compound showing green emission with &#934; of 0.31 and |glum| of 2.2&#215;10&#8722;3, highest within the series of &#960;&#8208;extended azaborahelicenes and superior to emission intensity and chiroptical response of its non&#8208;extended congener. This study shows that helical and lateral extensions of &#960;&#8208;conjugated systems are viable strategies to improve features of azaborole helicenes. In addition, single crystal X&#8208;ray analysis of configurationally stable [6]&#8208; and &#8208;[7]helicenes was used to provide insight into their packing arrangements.

         <dc:description>
Olefin metathesis gives access to important petrochemicals, polymers, and pharmaceuticals. The catalysts for these transformations are often based on high&#8208;valent metal ions e.g., Ru(IV), which have been improved through ligand modifications. An attractive, but challenging goal is to catalyze olefin metathesis with a non&#8208;toxic, bio&#8208;compatible, and abundant element; namely, iron. Indeed, the first pieces of evidence suggest that low&#8208;valent Fe(II) complexes are active in olefin metathesis. This Review by K. Meyer, S. B. Tsogoeva, et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202201414) summarizes the key advances and challenges in this endeavor.

For the last 30&#8197;years, the lack of a binary phosphorus nitride containing PN6 octahedra formed a scientific chasm between carbon&#8208;group and oxygen&#8208;group nitrides, both featuring a variety of solids with XN6 units (X being a non&#8208;metal element). Now, the discovery of the &#948;&#8208;P3N5 and PN2 phosphorus nitrides&#8212;formed under high pressure and both composed of the elusive PN6 octahedron&#8212;builds a long&#8208;sought&#8208;after bridge between these two groups of nitrides.

Solar energy&#8208;driven overall water splitting (OWS) is an attractive way for generating green hydrogen. This review focuses on the current research status of BiVO4&#8208;constituted photo(electro)catalytic OWS systems, and summarizes the effective strategies for BiVO4 photo(electro)catalysts in a mainline of efficient charge utilization. It is hoped to provide comprehensive guidance for the construction of advanced solar OWS systems.







Abstract
Solar energy&#8208;driven overall water splitting (OWS) is an attractive way for generating clean and renewable green hydrogen. One key challenge is the construction of OWS systems with high solar energy conversion efficiencies, in which how to manipulate photoexcited charge carriers to efficiently participate in the reaction is the top priority. In recent years, bismuth vanadate (BiVO4) has emerged as one of the most promising materials for photo(electro)catalytic OWS and considerable progress has been achieved. In this review, recent advances of BiVO4&#8208;constituted OWS systems in both photoelectrocatalytic and photocatalytic approaches are presented in a mainline of effective charge carrier utilization. Various strategies for improved charge carrier utilization, including band structure engineering, improving charge separation, reducing charge recombination, and accelerating reaction kinetics, are summarized and analyzed in detail. Finally, perspective and outlook on further exploring the application potential of BiVO4 are proposed.

         <title>Iron&#8208;Catalyzed Olefin Metathesis: Recent Theoretical and Experimental Advances</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 62, November 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Iron&#8208;catalyzed olefin metathesis is high on the list of existing challenges in chemistry. Iron is one of the most abundant elements in the earth&#8216;s crust, and, therefore, iron catalysts would offer highly attractive alternatives to Ru&#8208; and Mo&#8208;based catalysts. This Review summarizes the key recent theoretical and experimental advances towards the development of iron&#8208;catalyzed olefin metathesis.







Abstract
The &#8220;metathesis reaction&#8221; is a straightforward and often metal&#8208;catalyzed chemical reaction that transforms two hydrocarbon molecules to two new hydrocarbons by exchange of molecular fragments. Alkane, alkene and alkyne metathesis have become an important tool in synthetic chemistry and have provided access to complex organic structures. Since the discovery of industrial olefin metathesis in the 1960s, many modifications have been reported; thus, increasing scope and improving reaction selectivity. Olefin metathesis catalysts based on high&#8208;valent group six elements or Ru(IV) have been developed and improved through ligand modifications. In addition, significant effort was invested to realize olefin metathesis with a non&#8208;toxic, bio&#8208;compatible and one of the most abundant elements in the earth&#8242;s crust; namely, iron. First evidences suggest that low&#8208;valent Fe(II) complexes are active in olefin metathesis. Although the latter has not been unambiguously established, this review summarizes the key advances in the field and aims to guide through the challenges.

         <title>Cu&#8208;Catalyzed Stereoselective Borylation and Pd&#8208;Catalyzed Stereospecific Cross&#8208;Coupling to Give&#160;Aryl C&#8208;Glycosides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metabolically stable C&#8208;glycosides are an essential family of compounds in bioactive natural products, therapeutic agents, and biological probes. For their application, development of synthetic methods by connecting glycosides and aglycons with strict stereocontrol at the anomeric carbon as well as with high functional group compatibility and environmental compatibility is a pivotal issue. Although Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura&#8208;type C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp2) cross&#8208;coupling using glycosyl boronates is a potential candidate for the construction of C&#8208;glycosides, neither the cross&#8208;coupling itself nor the facile synthesis of the coupling precursor, glycosyl boronates, have been achieved to date.

         <title>Molecular Twisting Affects the Solid&#8208;State Photochemical Reactions of Unsaturated Ketones and the Photomechanical Effects of Molecular Crystals</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The three group of chalcone derivatives and their analogues involving halogen atoms (X = F, Cl, Br) have been synthesized. Firstly, the nearly planar acyclic chalcone derivatives were inclined to undergo photo&#8208;induced stereospecific [2+2] cycloaddition, which triggered the crystals to exhibit macroscopic motions of bending or cracking. In particular, the single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal transformation happened upon UV irradiation of their crystals, which was helpful for the understanding photomechanical effects. The group of cyclic 3,4&#8208;dihydronaphthalen&#8208;based chalcone analogues possess a more twisted conformation, and they tend to take place trans&#8208;cis isomerization. No photomechanical effect was observed for the crystals of the cyclic chalcone analogues due to the lower isomerization rate. The twist degree of chroman&#8208;based chalcone analogues molecules was in between of the first two, [2+2] cycloaddition and trans&#8208;cis isomerization simultaneously underwent in their crystals. Photo&#8208;induced bending and twisting were observed for the crystals of chroman&#8208;based chalcone analogues. Therefore, the differences in molecular dihedral angles in a,b&#8208;unsaturated ketones were responsible for their photochemical characters and in turn to tune the photomechanical effects. In this work, a bridge between the molecular structures and solid&#8208;state photochemical reactions triggered photomechanical crystals is built.</dc:description>

         <title>Rapid Access to Chiral and Tripodal Cavitands from &#946;&#8208;Pinene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abundant natural product &#946;&#8208;pinene can be rapidly converted into a library of chiral hosts that we call molecular tripods. As tripods complex chiral drugs in water, they hold promise for discovering and building novel sequestering agents, chemosensors or catalysts.







Abstract
We report Pd&#8208;catalyzed cyclotrimerization of (+)&#8208;&#945;&#8208;bromoenone, obtained from monoterpene &#946;&#8208;pinene, into an enantiopure cyclotrimer. This C3 symmetric compound has three bicyclo[3.1.1]heptane rings fused to its central benzene with each ring carrying a carbonyl group. The cyclotrimer undergoes diastereoselective threefold alkynylation with the lithium salts of five terminal alkynes (41&#8211;63&#8201;%, de=4&#8211;83&#8201;%). The addition enabled a rapid synthesis of a small library of novel chiral cavitands that, in shape, resemble a tripod stand. These molecular tripods include a tris&#8208;bicycloannelated benzene head attached to three alkyne legs twisted in one direction to form a nonpolar cavity with polar groups as feet. Tripods with methylpyridinium and methylisoquinolinium legs, respectively, form inclusion complexes with anti&#8208;inflammatory and chiral drugs (R)/(S)&#8208;ibuprofen and (R)/(S)&#8208;naproxen. The mode of binding shows drug molecules docked in the cavity of the host through ion&#8208;ion, cation&#8208;&#960;, and C&#8722;H&#8722;&#960; contacts that, in addition of desolvation, give rise to complexes having millimolar to micromolar stability in water. Our findings open the door to creating a myriad of enantiopure tripods with tunable functions that, in the future, might give novel chemosensors, catalysts or sequestering agents.

         <title>Multifunctional Organocatalysts &#8208; Singly&#8208;Linked and Macrocyclic Bisphosphoric Acids for Asymmetric Phase&#8208;Transfer and Br&#248;nsted&#8208;Acid Catalysis</title>

Covalently linked bisphosphoric acids deliver enhanced stereoselectivities compared to their monofunctional counterparts. The nature, length and number of linkers has a profound influence. Based on a library of singly&#8208;linked and macrocyclic bisphosphoric acids, we could identify catalysts suitable for electrophilic fluorinations and for asymmetric transfer&#8208;hydrogenations.







Abstract
The linking of phosphoric acids via covalent or mechanical bonds has proven to be a successful strategy for the design of novel organocatalysts. Here, we present the first systematic investigation of singly&#8208;linked and macrocyclic bisphosphoric acids, including their synthesis and their application in phase&#8208;transfer and Br&#248;nsted acid catalysis. We found that the novel bisphosphoric acids show dramatically increased enantioselectivities in comparison to their monophosphoric acid analogues. However, the nature, length and number of linkers has a profound influence on the enantioselectivities. In the asymmetric dearomative fluorination via phase&#8208;transfer catalysis, bisphosphoric acids with a single, rigid bisalkyne&#8208;linker give the best results with moderate to good enantiomeric excesses. In contrast, bisphosphoric acids with flexible linkers give excellent enantioselectivities in the transfer&#8208;hydrogenation of quinolines via cooperative Br&#248;nsted acid catalysis. In the latter case, sufficiently long linkers are needed for high stereoselectivities, as found experimentally and supported by DFT calculations.

         <title>An Extremely Stable Interprotein Tetrahedral Hg(Cys)4 Core Forms in the Zinc Hook Domain of Rad50 Protein at Physiological pH</title>

HgII toxicity: HgII targets the intermolecular ZnII&#8208;binding site of DNA binding protein Rad50 to form the strongest metal complex in the living world and jeopardize the DNA repair mechanism.







Abstract
In nature, thiolate&#8208;based systems are the primary targets of divalent mercury (HgII) toxicity. The formation of Hg(Cys)x cores in catalytic and structural protein centers mediates mercury's toxic effects and ultimately leads to cellular damage. Multiple studies have revealed distinct HgII&#8208;thiolate coordination preferences, among which linear HgII complexes are the most commonly observed in solution at physiological pH. Trigonal or tetrahedral geometries are formed at basic pH or in tight intraprotein Cys&#8208;rich metal sites. So far, no interprotein tetrahedral HgII complex formed at neutral pH has been reported. Rad50 protein is a part of the multiprotein MRN complex, a major player in DNA damage&#8208;repair processes. Its central region consists of a conserved CXXC motif that enables dimerization of two Rad50 molecules by coordinating ZnII. Dimerized motifs form a unique interprotein zinc hook domain (Hk) that is critical for the biological activity of the MRN. Using a series of length&#8208;differentiated peptide models of the Pyrococcus furiosus zinc hook domain, we investigated its interaction with HgII. Using UV&#8208;Vis, CD, PAC, and 199Hg&#8197;NMR spectroscopies as well as anisotropy decay, we discovered that all Rad50 fragments preferentially form homodimeric Hg(Hk)2 species with a distorted tetrahedral HgS4 coordination environment at physiological pH; this is the first example of an interprotein mercury site displaying tetrahedral geometry in solution. At higher HgII content, monomeric HgHk complexes with linear geometry are formed. The Hg(Cys)4 core of Rad50 is extremely stable and does not compete with cyanides, NAC, or DTT. Applying ITC, we found that the stability constant of the Rad50 Hg(Hk)2 complex is approximately three orders of magnitude higher than those of the strongest HgII complexes known to date.

         <title>Endoperoxides Compounds for Highly Efficient Cancer Treatment under Hypoxia</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Singlet oxygen is one of the most important reactive oxygen species, which can induce intracellular bio&#8208;molecule damage and oxidative stress. Constructing endoperoxides photosensitizers to supply singlet oxygen during photodynamic therapy can effectively tackle the problem of hypoxic cancer therapy. The introduction of endoperoxides compounds provides a novel and promising strategy for cancer treatment under hypoxia.







Abstract
Photodynamic therapy (PDT) for cancer treatment has garnered tremendous attention with its promising non&#8208;invasiveness, low side effects, and spatiotemporal selectivity. However, the hypoxic microenvironment in solid tumours remains a serious resistant factor to reducing the effects of PDT. Endoperoxides are successfully utilized as the chemical storage or supplier of singlet oxygen (1O2), the active substance for PDT in materials and other domains. Recent reports indicated that this type of compound could remarkably enhance the therapeutic effects of PDT under hypoxia. This concept mainly introduces a few representative endoperoxides and the outlook of their potent application for treating hypoxic cancer cells.

         <title>Evidence for multiple binding modes in the initial contact between SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 spike S1 protein and cell surface glycans
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
More than one way to get in: A hexasaccharide bound to site&#8197;I of the spike protein in two binding modes (orange and green tubes) shows that multiple binding modes between heparan sulfate (HS) and S1 (electrostatic potential map on the surface) are allowed. The hypothetical macromolecular complex HS&#8722;S1 does not interfere with the interaction involving S1&#8208;RBD and ACE2, thus supporting the co&#8208;receptor role of HS in the activation of the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 S protein.







Abstract
Infection of host cells by SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 begins with recognition by the virus S (spike) protein of cell surface heparan sulfate (HS), tethering the virus to the extracellular matrix environment, and causing the subunit S1&#8208;RBD to undergo a conformational change into the &#8216;open&#8217; conformation. These two events promote the binding of S1&#8208;RBD to the angiotensin converting enzyme&#8197;2 (ACE2) receptor, a preliminary step toward viral&#8208;cell membrane fusion. Combining ligand&#8208;based NMR spectroscopy with molecular dynamics, oligosaccharide analogues were used to explore the interactions between S1&#8208;RBD of SARS CoV&#8208;2 and HS, revealing several low&#8208;specificity binding modes and previously unidentified potential sites for the binding of extended HS polysaccharide chains. The evidence for multiple binding modes also suggest that highly specific inhibitors will not be optimal against protein S but, rather, diverse HS&#8208;based structures, characterized by high affinity and including multi&#8208;valent compounds, may be required.

         <title>Continuous Charge Transport in Carbon Nitride Modulated by Interfacial Chemical Bond and Homophase Junction to Boost Photocatalytic Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electron transfer chain, which mimics the electron transport chain in natural photosynthetic system fabricated by the synergistic interfacial chemical bond and brookite TiO2 homophase junction promotes the charge separation efficiency in 2D carbon nitride.







Abstract
Efficient separation of photogenerated electrons and holes is of key importance in photocatalysis. Tuning the charge separation pathway is significant but still suffering from low efficiency for the charge extraction from semiconductors. Herein, taking 2D g&#8208;C3N4 (CN) nanosheets as a model photocatalyst, it was found the decoration of homophase junction between brookite TiO2 rods and nanoparticles (BN&#8208;BR) onto CN can effectively modulate photogenerated charge extraction and transfer in BN&#8208;BR/CN composites. The BN&#8208;BR/CN exhibits a remarkably enhanced photocatalytic H2 evolution under visible light irradiation (&#955;&gt;420&#8197;nm) compared with the single component. A continuous electron transfer channel constructed by an interfacial chemical bond Ti&#8722;O&#8722;N between CN and brookite rods (BR) and BN&#8208;BR homophase junction between brookite nanoparticles and rods was proposed to benefit the charge extraction and transfer. This work provides a strategy to tune the charge separation and transfer to facilitate the photocatalytic performance in heterogeneous photocatalysis.

         <title>Metal Nodes of Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks can Activate Molecular Hydrogen</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal nodes of various robust metal&#8208;organic frameworks activate H2. The catalytic activity is a function of the composition of the metal node and the organic linker. It is proposed that the reaction mechanism is based on the operation of frustrated Lewis acid/base pairs.







Abstract
Hydrogenation of multiple bonds are among the most general and important organic reactions. Typical heterogeneous catalysts are based on transition metal nanoparticles, including noble metals. Data are presented here showing that metal nodes of MIL&#8208;101(Cr) and UiO&#8208;66 in the absence of occluded metal nanoparticles can promote hydrogenation of polarized X=Y double bonds of nitro and carbonyl groups. The catalytic activity is a function of the composition of the metal node and the organic linker. It is proposed that the reaction mechanism is based on the operation of frustrated Lewis acid/base pairs.

         <title>Efficient Hydrogenation of N&#8208;Heterocycles Catalyzed by NNP&#8211;Manganese(I) Pincer Complexes at Ambient Temperature</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Several NImNHP&#8208;Mn(I) pincer complexes were synthesised and studied by a combination of experimental and theoretical investigations. Their interesting catalytic activities were shown in several hydrogenation reactions of N&#8208;heterocycles with good to excellent performance under very mild conditions.







Abstract
In summary, several imidazolylphosphine pincer ligands and the corresponding Mn complexes were synthesized, fully characterized, and studied by a combination of experimental and theoretical investigations. The complexes were tested in several hydrogenation reactions with good to excellent performance. Especially, the reduction of diverse N&#8208;heterocycles can be performed in excellent yields and high selectivity under very mild conditions using catalyst Mn&#8208;2&#8201;b. Spectroscopic studies support a classical metal&#8208;ligand cooperative mechanism for the activation of the catalyst, revealing amido as well as hydrido species. A third species could also be observed, tentatively assigned as the tert&#8208;butoxy species MnOtBu&#8208;NH&#8208;2&#8201;b. DFT supported these findings showing the possibility of equilibrium between all three catalyst species in the reaction. It further revealed higher kinetic reactivity as well as lower formation barrier for MnH&#8208;NH&#8208;2&#8201;b over MnH&#8208;NH&#8208;1&#8201;b as likely causes for its improved reactivity.

         <dc:description>Fluorine (  19  F) incorporation into glycan binding proteins (lectins) has been achieved and exploited to monitor the binding to carbohydrate ligands by Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Spectroscopy. Galectins are a family of lectins that bind carbohydrates, generally with weak affinities, through a combination of intermolecular interactions including a key CH&#8208;&#960; stacking interaction involving a conserved Trp residue. Herein, two galectins, Galectin&#8208;3 (Gal3) and Galectin&#8208;8 (Gal8) with one and two (different) carbohydrate recognition domains (CRDs) respectively were selected. Gal3 contain only one Trp, while Gal8 contains three Trp, one at each CRD binding site and a third not involved in ligand binding, which were substituted by the corresponding F&#8208;Trp analogues. The presence of the fluorine did not significantly modify the affinity for glycan binding, which was in slow exchange in the  19  F NMR chemical shift time scale, even for weak ligands, and allowed to individualise binding events taking place at two different binding sites within the same lectin.</dc:description>

         <title>Modifying the St&#246;ber Process: Is the Organic Solvent Indispensable?</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The St&#246;ber method is one of the most important and fundamental processes for the synthesis of inorganic (nano)materials, but has the drawback of using a large amount of organic solvent. Herein, we used ethanol as an example to explore if the organic solvent in a typical St&#246;ber method can be omitted. We found that ethanol increases the particle size of the obtained silica spheres and aids the formation of uniform silica particles rather than forming a gel. Nevertheless, the results indicated that an organic solvent in the initial synthesis mixture is not indispensable. We discovered, an initially immiscible synthesis method, which can replace the organic solvent&#8208;based St&#246;ber method to successfully synthesize silica particles with the same size ranges as the original St&#246;ber process without addition of organic solvents. Moreover, this process can be of further value to be extended to synthesis processes of other materials based on the St&#246;ber process.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Stereoselective construction of unprotected &#946; &#8208;amino acids is a significant challenge owing to the lack of methods for the catalytic generation of highly enantioenriched carboxylic acid enolates. In this study, we developed a novel copper&#8208;catalyzed diastereo&#8208; and enantioselective reductive Mannich&#8208;type reaction of &#945;,&#946; &#8208;unsaturated carboxylic acids, which provides a direct and scalable synthetic method for enantioenriched &#946; 2,3,3 &#8208;amino acids with vicinal stereogenic centers. Our protocol features in situ generation of transiently protected carboxylic acids by a hydrosilane and their diastereo&#8208; and enantioselective reductive coupling with ketimines. The synthetic utility of this process was demonstrated by a gram&#8208;scale reaction and the transformation of &#946; &#8208;amino acids.</dc:description>

         <title>Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed Formylation of Unactivated Alkyl Chlorides to Aldehydes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The first rhodium&#8208;catalyzed formylation of&#160;non&#8208;activated alkyl chlorides with syn gas (H2/CO) allows to produce aldehydes in high yields (25 examples). A catalyst optimization study revealedRh(acac)(CO)2 in the presence of 1,3&#8208;bisdiphenylphosphinopropane (DPPP) as&#160;the most active catalyst system for this transformation. Key for the success of the reaction is the addition of sodium iodide (NaI) to the reaction system, which leads to the formation of activated alkyl iodides as intermediates. Depending on the reaction conditions, either the linear or branched aldehydes can be preferentially obtained, which is explained by a different mechanism.</dc:description>

         <title>Structure&#8208;Activity Relationships in Nucleic&#8208;Acid&#8208;Templated Vectors Based on Peptidic Dynamic Covalent Polymers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The use of nucleic acids as templates which can trigger the self&#8208;assembly of their own vectors represent an emerging, simple and versatile, approach toward the self&#8208;fabrication of tailored nucleic acids delivery vectors. However, the structure&#8208;activity relationships governing this complex templated self&#8208;assembly process that accompanies the complexation of nucleic acids remains poorly understood. Here, we studied the class of arginine&#8208;rich dynamic covalent polymers (DCPs) composed of different monomers varying the number and position of arginines. We describe the combinations that lead to nucleic acid complexation, in saline buffer, using different templates, from short siRNA to long DNA. Finally, we identify a successful peptidic DCP featuring six&#8208;arginine repeating unit that promote the safe and effective delivery of siRNA in live cancer cells.</dc:description>

         <title>Palladium(0)&#8208;Catalyzed Anti&#8208;Selective Addition&#8208;Cyclizations of Alkynyl Electrophiles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Palladium(0)/monophosphine complexes catalyze anti&#8208;selective alkylative, arylative, and alkynylative cyclizations of alkynyl electrophiles with organometallic reagents. The remarkable anti&#8208;selectivity results from novel oxidative addition, i.e., the nucleophilic attack of electron&#8208;rich palladium(0) on the electrophile across the alkyne followed by transmetalation and reductive elimination ("anti&#8208;Wacker"&#8208;type cyclization). With regard to 5&#8208;alkynals, triphenylphosphine (PPh3)&#8208;ligated palladium(0) catalyzes the cyclization of terminal alkynes and conjugated alkenyl&#8208; or alkynyl&#8208;substituted ones to afford 2&#8208;cyclohexen&#8208;1&#8208;ol and 2&#8208;alkylidene&#8208;cyclopentanol derivatives, respectively. For 6&#8208;alkyl&#8208; or 6&#8208;aryl&#8208;5&#8208;alkynals, the cyclization does not proceed with the palladium/PPh3 catalyst; however, it does proceed with palladium/tricyclohexylphosphine (PCy3), to yield the former products predominantly. Remarkably, the latter catalyst completely switches the regioselectivity in the cyclization of the conjugated diyne&#8208;aldehydes. Notably, palladium/PPh3&#8208;catalyzed cyclizations also proceed with other organometallics or even without them.</dc:description>

         <title>Theoretical Exploration on the Role of Magnetic States to the N2&#160;Fixation behaviors of 2D Transition Metal Tri&#8208;borides (TMB3s)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fixing nitrogen (N2) by electrosynthesis method has become a promising way to ammonia (NH3) production, nevertheless, developing electrocatalysts combining long&#8208;term stable and low&#8208;cost feathers are&#160;still a great challenge to date. Using comprehensive first&#8208;principles calculations, we herein investigate the potential of a new class of two&#8208;dimensional (2D) transition metal tri&#8208;borides (TMB3s) as nitrogen reduction reaction&#160;(NRR) electrocatalysts, and explore the effect of magnetic orders on the NRR. Our results show that the TMB3s can sufficiently activate N2&#160;and convert it to NH3. Particularly, TiB3&#160;is identified as a&#160;high&#8208;efficiency catalyst for NRR because of its low limiting potential (&#8208;0.24 V) and good suppression of the competitive hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). For the first time, we present that these TMB3s with various magnetic states exhibit different performances in the adsorption of N2&#160;and NRR intermediates, and minor effect on activation of N2.&#160;Besides, VB3, CrB3, MnB3, and FeB3&#160;monolayers possess the superior capacity to suppress surface oxidation via the self&#8208;activating process, which reduces *O/*OH into *H2O under NRR electrochemical conditions, thus favoring the N2&#160;electroreduction.&#160;This work paves the way for finding high&#8208;performance NRR catalysts for transition metal borides&#160;and pioneering the research of magnetic states effects in NRR.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The analysis and regulation of proteins are of great significance for the development of disease diagnosis and treatment. However, complicated analytical environment and complex protein structure severely limit the accuracy of their analysis results. Thus, the selection of biometric molecules with good selectivity and high affinity is very important. Among them, peptide with lots of obvious advantages like good biocompatibility, low immunogenicity, variety, strong functionality, flexible chemical modification, etc. has attracted numerous attentions. In this review, we summarize the advances in the use of modular peptide probes for proteins analysis. It focuses on how to design and optimize the structure of probes, as well as their performance. Then, the specific applications of modular peptide probes are introduced. Finally, we also discuss current challenge and provide some ideas for the future direction for modular peptide probes, hoping to accelerate their clinical transformation.</dc:description>

         <title>Edge Decorated Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons via Oxidative Coupling Approach</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Oxidative phenol coupling reduces reliance on halo/metalated substrates needed for conventional redox neutral couplings. A new strategy for construction of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) that incorporates oxidative phenol coupling is outlined via a three&#8208;stage approach: oxidative fragment coupling, linking of two resultant units, and oxidative cyclization.&#160; The protocol allows rapid assembly of both planar and helical systems with a high degree of edge functionalization. The incorporation of 12 alkoxy groups on systems with 12&#8208;14 rings gave rise to lower optical gaps compared to systems with a lesser degree of edge functionalization.</dc:description>

         <title>Unveiling the Metal Incorporation Effect of Steady&#8208;Active FeP Hydrogen Evolution Nanocatalysts for Water Electrolyzer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal phosphides are promising noble metal&#8208;free electrocatalysts for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), but they usually suffer from inferior stability and thus are far from the device applications. We reported a facile and controllable synthetic method to prepare metal&#8208;incorporated M&#8208;FeP nanoparticles (M= Cr, Mn, Co, Fe, Ni, Cu, and Mo) with the guide of the density functional theory (DFT). The evaluated HER activity sequence was consistent with the DFT predictions, and cobalt was revealed to be the appropriate dopant. With the optimization of the Co/Fe ratio, the Fe0.67Co0.33P/C only required overpotentials of 67 mV and 129 mV to obtain the cathodic current density of 10 and 100 mA cm&#8208;2, respectively. It maintained the initial activity in the 10 hours stability test, surpassing the other Co&#8208;FeP/C catalysts. Ex&#8208;situ experiments demonstrated that the decreased element leaching and the increased surface phosphide content contributed to the high stability of the Fe0.67Co0.33P/C. A proton exchange membrane water electrolyzer was assembled using the Fe0.67Co0.33P/C as the cathodic catalyst. It showed a current density of 0.8 A cm&#8208;2 at the applied voltage of 2.0 V and retained the initial activity in the 1000 cycles&#8217; stability test, suggesting the potential application of the catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Luminescent Crystalline Carbon&#8208; and Nitrogen&#8208;Centered Organic Radicals Based on N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene&#8208;Triphenylamine Hybrids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing luminescent radicals with tunable emission is a challenging task due to the limitation of alternative skeletons. Herein, a series of carbene&#8211;triphenylamine hybrids were prepared by the direct C2&#8208;arylation of N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene with 4&#8208;bromo&#8208;N,N&#8208;bis(4&#8208;methoxyphenyl)aniline. These hybrids showed multiple redox&#8208;active properties and could be converted to carbon&#8208;centered luminescent radicals with blue&#8208;to&#8208;cyan emissions (&#955;max: 436&#8211;486 nm) or nitrogen&#8208;centered luminescent radicals with orange emissions (&#955;max: 590&#8211;623 nm) through chemical reduction or oxidation, respectively. The radical species were characterized by electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy, ultraviolet&#8208;visible spectroscopy, and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffractometry analysis. Notably, the corresponding nitrogen&#8208;centered radicals exhibited good stability in atmospheric air, and their thermal decomposition temperatures were determined to be above 200&#176;C. In addition, spectral and theoretical calculations indicate that all radicals exhibit anti&#8208;Kasha emissions</dc:description>

         <title>Smart Phototheranostics based on Carbon Nanohorns for Precise Imaging&#8208;Guided Post&#8208;PDT toward Residual Tumor Cells after Initial Phototherapy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>As promising photonic material, phototheranostics can be activated in the laser irradiation range of tumor with sensitivity and spatiotemporal precision. However, it is difficult to completely eradicate solid tumors due to their irregularity and limited laser irradiation area. Herein, multi&#8208;stimulus responsive HA&#8208;Ce6@SWNHs were constructed with single&#8208;walled carbon nanohorns (SWNHs) and chlorine e6 (Ce6) modified hyaluronic acid (HA) via non&#8208;covalent binding. This SWNHs&#8208;based phototheranostics not only exhibited water dispersion but also could target tumor and be activated by near&#8208;infrared light for photodynamic therapy (PDT) and photothermal therapy (PTT). Additionally, HA&#8208;Ce6@SWNHs could be degraded by hyaluronidase in residual tumor cells, causing HA&#8208;Ce6 to fall off the SWNHs surfaces to restore autofluorescence, thus precisely guiding the programmed photodynamic treatments for residual tumor cells after the initial phototherapy. Thus, this work provides a rationally designed multiple&#8208;stimulus&#8208;response strategy to develop smart SWNHs&#8208;based phototheranostics for precise PDT/PTT and post&#8208;treatment imaging&#8208;guided PDT of residual tumor cells.</dc:description>

         <title>Comparative Screening of DalPhos/Ni Catalysts in C&#8208;N Cross&#8208;couplings of (Hetero)aryl Chlorides Enables Development of Aminopyrazole Cross&#8208;couplings with Amine Base</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Several focused reports have appeared over the past few years documenting the utility of nickel catalysts featuring newly developed DalPhos bisphosphine ligands for C&#8208;N cross&#8208;couplings of typically challenging (hetero)aryl chlorides with targeted NH nucleophiles. Herein, a more expansive and systematic competitive evaluation of this ligand family in N&#8208;arylation chemistry is provided involving primary (linear and branched) and secondary alkylamines, as well as a primary five&#8208;membered heteroarylamine (aminopyrazole), in combination with a diverse set of test electrophiles and bases (NaOtBu, K2CO3, DBU/NaTFA). In addition to providing optimal ligand/catalyst identification, and bringing to light methodology limitations (e.g., unwanted C&#8208;O cross&#8208;coupling with NaOtBu), our survey enabled the development of the first efficient catalyst system for heteroatom&#8208;dense C&#8208;N cross&#8208;coupling of aminopyrazoles and related nucleophiles with (hetero)aryl chlorides by use of an amine &#8216;dual&#8208;base&#8217; system.</dc:description>

         <title>How Bases Catalyze Diels&#8208;Alder Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We have quantum chemically studied the base&#8208;catalyzed Diels&#8208;Alder (DA) reaction between 3hydroxy&#8208;2&#8208;pyrone and N&#8208;methylmaleimide using dispersion&#8208;corrected density functional theory. The uncatalyzed reaction is slow and is preceded by the extrusion of CO2 via a retro&#8208;DA reaction. Base catalysis, e.g., by triethylamine, lowers the reaction barrier up to 10 kcal mol&#8211;1, causing the reaction to proceed smoothly at low temperature, which quenches the expulsion of CO2, yielding efficient access to polyoxygenated natural compounds. Our activation strain analyses reveal that the base accelerates the DA reaction via two distinct electronic mechanisms: (i) by the HOMO&#8208;raising effect, which enhances the normal electron demand orbital interaction; and (ii) by donating charge into 3&#8208;hydroxy2&#8208;pyrone which accumulates in its reactive region and promotes strongly stabilizing secondary electrostatic interactions with N&#8208;methylmaleimide.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrocatalytic CO2 reduction with a binuclear bis&#8208;terpyridine pyrazole&#8208;bridged cobalt complex</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A pyrazole&#8211;based ligand substituted with terpyridine groups at the 3 and 5 positions has been synthesized to form the dinuclear cobalt complex  1  , that electrocatalytically reduces carbon dioxide (CO  2  ) to carbon monoxide (CO) in the presence of Br&#248;nsted acids in DMF. Chemical, electrochemical and UV&#8211;vis spectro&#8211;electrochemical studies under inert atmosphere indicate pairwise reduction processes of complex  1  . Infrared spectro&#8211;electrochemical studies under CO  2  and CO atmosphere are consistent with a reduced CO&#8211;containing dicobalt complex which results from the electroreduction of CO  2  . In the presence of trifluoroethanol (TFE), electrocatalytic studies revealed single&#8211;site mechanism with up to 94% selectivity towards CO formation when 1.47 M TFE were present, at &#8211;1.35 V  vs  Saturated Calomel Electrode in DMF (0.39 V overpotential). The low faradaic efficiencies obtained (&lt;50%) are attributed to the generation of CO&#8211;containing species formed during the electrocatalytic process, which inhibit the reduction of CO  2  .</dc:description>

         <title>Fast and Cost&#8208;Efficient 17O&#8208;Isotopic Labeling of Carboxylic Groups in Biomolecules: from Free Amino Acids to Peptide Chains</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>17  O NMR spectroscopy is a powerful technique, which can provide unique information regarding the structure and reactivity of biomolecules. However, the low natural abundance of  17  O (0.04%) generally requires working with enriched samples, which are not easily accessible. Here, we present simple, fast and cost&#8208;efficient  17  O&#8208;enrichment strategies for amino acids and peptides, using mechanochemistry. First, five unprotected amino acids were enriched under ambient conditions, consuming only microliter amounts of costly labeled water, and producing pure molecules with enrichment levels up to ~ 40%, yields ~ 60&#8208;85%, and no loss of optical purity. Subsequently,  17  O&#8208;enriched Fmoc/  t  Bu&#8208;protected amino acids were produced on a 1g/day scale with high enrichment levels. Lastly, a site&#8208;selective  17  O&#8208;labeling of carboxylic functions in peptide side&#8208;chains was achieved for RGD and GRGDS peptides, with ~ 28% enrichment level. For all molecules,  17  O ssNMR spectra were recorded at 14.1T in reasonable times, making this an important step forward for future NMR studies of biomolecules.</dc:description>

         <title>Identification of Isonitrile&#8208;Containing Natural Products in Complex Biological Matrices Through Ligation with Chlorooximes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Isonitrile&#8208;containing natural products have garnered attention for their manifold bioactivities but are difficult to detect and isolate due to the chemical lability of the isonitrile functional group. Here, we used isonitrile&#8208;chlorooxime ligation (INC) in a reactivity&#8208;based screening (RBS) protocol for the detection and isolation of alkaloid and terpene isonitriles in the cyanobacterium Fischerella&#160;ambigua and the marine sponge Axinella sp., respectively. A trifunctional probe bearing a chlorooxime moiety, a UV active aromatic moiety, and a bromine label facilitated the chemoselective reaction with isonitriles, UV&#8208;Vis spectroscopic detection, and mass spectrometric analysis. The INC&#8208;based RBS allowed for the detection, isolation, and structural elucidation of isonitriles in microgram quantities.</dc:description>

         <title>Tweaking the Optoelectronic Properties of S&#8208;Doped Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons by Chemical Oxidation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Peri&#8208;thiaxanthenothiaxanthene, an S&#8208;doped analog of&#160;peri&#8208;xanthenoxanthene, is used as a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) scaffold to tune the molecular semiconductor properties by editing the oxidation state of the S&#8208;atoms. Chemical oxidation of peri&#8208;thiaxanthenothiaxanthene with H2O2&#160;led to the relevant sulfoxide and sulfone congeners, whereas electrooxidation gave access to sulfonium&#8208;type derivatives forming crystalline mixed valence (MV) complexes. These complexes depicted peculiar molecular and solid&#8208;state arrangements with face&#8208;to&#8208;face&#160;p&#8208;p&#160;stacking organization. Photophysical studies showed a widening of the optical bandgap upon progressive oxidation of the S&#8208;atoms, with the bis&#8208;sulfone derivative displaying the largest value (E00&#160;= 2.99 eV). While peri&#8208;thiaxanthenothiaxanthene showed reversible oxidation properties, the sulfoxide and sulfone derivatives mainly showed reductive events, corroborating their&#160;n&#8208;type properties. Electric measurements of single crystals of the MV complexes exhibited a semiconducting behavior with a remarkably high conductivity at room temperature (10&#8208;1&#8208;10&#8208;2&#160;S cm&#8208;1&#160;and 10&#8208;2&#8208;10&#8208;3&#160;S cm&#8208;1&#160;for the O and S derivatives, respectively), one of the highest reported so far.

         <title>Alkyne Activation in the Diversity Oriented Synthesis of sp2&#8208;Rich Scaffolds: A Biased Library Approach for Targeting Polynucleotides (DNA/RNA)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The targeting of polynucleotide (RNA and DNA) topologies and their protein complexes by small molecules has enormous potential in the discovery of new therapeutics across a broad range of diseases (infectious, chronic and congenital). Polynucleotides are very different structures to proteins and have a much greater capacity to form strong &#960;,&#960;&#8208;interactions with suitably &#960;&#8208;rich small molecules. To exploit this difference, we have developed a diversity&#8208;oriented synthesis approach to &#960;&#8208;rich scaffolds from a common set of substrates. The utility of this approach has been exemplified in the discovery of a novel topoisomerase&#8208;1 inhibitor.







Abstract
Polynucleotides, DNA and RNA (mRNA and non&#8208;coding RNAs) are critically involved in the molecular pathways of disease. Small molecule binding interactions with polynucleotides can modify functional polynucleotide topologies and/or their interactions with proteins. Current approaches to library design (lead&#8208;like or fragment&#8208;like libraries) are based on protein&#8208;ligand interactions and often include careful consideration of the 3&#8208;dimensional orientation of binding motifs and exclude &#960;&#8208;rich compounds (polyfused aromatics) to avoid off&#8208;target R/DNA interactions. In contrast to proteins, where &#960;,&#960;&#8208;interactions are weak, polynucleotides can form strong &#960;,&#960;&#8208;interactions with suitable &#960;&#8208;rich ligands. To assist in designing a polynucleotide&#8208;biased library, a scaffold&#8208;divergent synthesis approach to polyfused aromatic scaffolds has been undertaken. Initial screening hits that form moderately stable polynucleotide&#8208;ligand&#8208;protein ternary complexes can be further optimized through judicious incorporation of substituents on the scaffold to increase protein&#8208;ligand interactions. An example of this approach is given for topoisomerase&#8208;1 (TOP1), generating a novel TOP1 inhibitory chemotype.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The targeting of polynucleotide&lt;/b&gt; (RNA and DNA) topologies and their protein complexes by small molecules has enormous potential in the discovery of new therapeutics across a broad range of diseases (infectious, chronic and congenital). Polynucleotides are very different structures to proteins and have a much greater capacity to form strong &#960;,&#960;-interactions with suitably &#960;-rich small molecules. To exploit this difference, we have developed a diversity-oriented synthesis approach to &#960;-rich scaffolds from a common set of substrates. The utility of this approach has been exemplified in the discovery of a novel topoisomerase-1 inhibitor.
&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Excitation&#8208;Wavelength&#8208;Dependent Functionalities of Temporally Controlled Sensing and Generation of Singlet Oxygen by a Photoexcited State Engineered Rhodamine 6G&#8208;Anthracene Conjugate</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Rhodamine 6G&#8208;anthracene conjugate acts as a conventional 1O2 sensor, a unique spatiotemporally controlled 1O2 sensor, or a good photosensitizer depending on the photoexcitation wavelengths. Experimental results and DFT calculations suggest that the unique multifunctionality was achieved by the unique photoexcited states of the molecule. The molecular ability in living cells was also demonstrated.







Abstract
The present study provides design guidance for unique multipotent molecules that sense and generate singlet oxygen (1O2). A rhodamine 6G&#8208;aminomethylanthracene&#8208;linked donor&#8208;acceptor molecule (RA) is designed and synthesized for demonstrating wavelength&#8208;dependent functionalities as follows; (i) RA acts as a conventional fluorogenic 1O2 sensor molecule like the commercially available reagent, singlet oxygen sensor green (SOSG), when it absorbs ultraviolet (UV)&#8208;visible light and reacts with 1O2. (ii) RA acts as a temporally controlled 1O2 sensing reagent under the longer wavelength (&#8764;700&#8197;nm) photosensitization. RA enters an intermediate state after capturing 1O2 and does not become strongly fluorescent until it is exposed to UV, blue, or green light. (iii) RA acts as an efficient photosensitizer to generate 1O2 under green light illumination. The spin&#8208;orbit charge transfer mediated intersystem crossing (SOCT&#8208;ISC) process achieves this function, and RA shows a potential cancer&#8208;killing effect on pancreatic cancer cells. The wavelength&#8208;switchable functionalities in RA offer to promise molecular tools to apply 1O2 in a spatiotemporal manner.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Reductive Double Carbonylation of Nitroarenes with Aryl Halides Using Mo(CO)6 as a Reductant and Carbonyl Source</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of benzoxazin&#8208;4&#8208;ones by palladium&#8208;catalyzed reductive double carbonylation of nitroarenes with aryl halides has been achieved. The key to success was the use of Mo(CO)6 as a reductant and bench&#8208;stable solid carbonyl source. Various aryl iodides, bromides, and trifluoromethanesulfonates are suitable reaction partners and produce corresponding nitrogen heterocycles in moderate to good yields. Notably, this method avoids the use of toxic CO gas and is further applied to the late&#8208;stage modification of estrone.







Abstract
A new palladium&#8208;catalyzed reductive double carbonylation of nitroarenes with aryl halides for the synthesis of benzoxazin&#8208;4&#8208;ones has been reported. The key to success was the use of Mo(CO)6 as a reductant and bench&#8208;stable solid carbonyl sources. Various aryl iodides, bromides, and trifluoromethanesulfonates are suitable reaction partners and produce corresponding benzoxazin&#8208;4&#8208;one derivatives in moderate to good yields. Preliminary mechanistic studies indicate that nitrosoarene was first generated as the key intermediate through nitro reduction. Remarkably, this method avoids the use of toxic CO gas and is further applied to the late&#8208;stage modification of estrone.

         <title>Dimorpholinoacetylene and Its Use for the Synthesis of Tetraaminocyclobutadiene Species</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dimorpholinoacetylene has been synthesized and structurally characterized as a new member of the class of electron&#8208;rich diaminoacetylenes. The new compound can be used to produce cyclic bent allene (CBA) transition&#8208;metal complexes or oxidized to give the first fully characterized cyclobutadiene dication. Detailed computational studies by NICS and current density calculations were carried out to assess the aromaticity of tetraaminocyclobutadiene dications.







Abstract
The new diaminoacetylene (DAA) dimorpholinoacetylene (3) was prepared from 1,1&#8208;dimorpholinoethene (1) by bromination to form the dibromoketene aminal 2, which upon lithiation afforded 3 through a Fritsch&#8208;Buttenberg&#8208;Wiechell rearrangement. Heating 3 at elevated temperatures resulted in a complete conversion into the dimer 1,1,2,4&#8208;tetramorpholino&#8208;1&#8208;buten&#8208;3&#8208;yne (4), which was used for the synthesis of four&#8208;membered cyclic bent allene (CBA) transition&#8208;metal complexes of the type [(CBA)MLn] (5&#8208;7; MLn=AuCl, RhCl(COD), RhCl(CO)2; CBA=1,3,4,4&#8208;tetramorpholino&#8208;1,2&#8208;cyclobutadiene; COD=1,5&#8208;cyclooctadiene). The reaction of 3 with tetraethylammonium bromide gave 1,2,3,4&#8208;tetramorpholinocyclobutenylium bromide (8), which reacted with bromine to form 1,2,3,4&#8208;tetra(morpholino)cyclobutenediylium bis(tribromide) (9). Compound 9 represents the first fully characterized compound containing a tetraaminocyclobutadiene dication and displays a nearly planar C4N4 core as shown by X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis. Detailed quantum chemical calculations were performed to assess the aromaticity of tetraaminocyclubutadiene dications by employing the Nucleus Independent Chemical Shift (NICS) method and current density analysis.

         <title>Synthesis of 1&#8208;aminoisoquinolines&#160;and Its Application in&#160;Host&#8208;Guest&#8208;Doped Strategy&#160;To Construct Ultralong Room&#8208;Temperature&#160;Phosphorescence Materials for Bioimaging</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic ultralong room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) materials have attracted great attention for their wide applications in optoelectronic devices and bioimaging. However, the development of these materials remains a challenging task, partially due to the lack of rational molecular design strategies and unclear luminescence mechanisms. Herein, we present a method for facile access to structurally diverse substituted 1&#8208;aminoisoquinoline derivatives via a copper&#8208;catalyzed one&#8208;pot three&#8208;component coupling reaction, which provides a promising approach to rapidly assemble a library of 1&#8208;aminoisoquinolines for exploring the regularity of the host&#8208;guest doped system. A series of host&#8208;guest RTP materials with wide&#8208;range lifetimes from 4.4 to 299.3 ms were constructed by doping various substituted isoquinolines derivatives into benzophenone (BP). Furthermore, 4r/BP nanoparticles could be utilized for in vivo imaging with a signal to noise ratio (SNR) value as high as 32, revealing the potential of the isoquinoline framework for the construction of high&#8208;performance RTP materials.</dc:description>

Structural analyses reveal that all Dy(III) centers in complexes  1R  /  1S  and  2R  /  2S  are nine&#8208;coordinate with hula&#8208;loop coordination geometry, and the differences between  1R  /  1S  and  2R  /  2S  are the terminal coordination anion and counter anion. Magnetic studies indicate that complex  2S  displays typical SMM behaviors under a zero dc field, whereas  1S  just shows slow relaxation of magnetization resulting from a relatively weak axial crystal field.

         <title>Carba&#8208;Sugar Analogs of Glucosamine&#8208;6&#8208;Phosphate: New Activators for the glmS Riboswitch</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Riboswitches are 5'&#8208;untranslated mRNA regions mostly found in bacteria. They are promising drug targets to overcome emerging bacterial resistances against commonly used antibiotics. The glmS riboswitch is unique among the family of riboswitches as it is a ribozyme that undergoes self&#8208;cleavage upon binding to glucosamine&#8208;6&#8208;phosphate (GlcN6P). Previously, we could show that carba glucosamine&#8208;6&#8208;phosphate (carba&#8208;GlcN6P) induces self&#8208;cleavage of the riboswitch with a potency similar to GlcN6P. Here, we report a synthetic approach to a new class of carba&#8208;GlcN6P derivatives with an alkoxy substituent in the carba position. Key features of the synthesis are a ring closing metathesis reaction followed by a hydroboration. The strategy gives access to libraries of carba&#8208;GlcN6P derivatives. Ribozyme cleavage assays unraveled new activators for the glmS riboswitch from Listeria monocytogenes and Clostridium difficile.</dc:description>

The compounds 2a&#8208;f and 3a&#8208;f were characterised thoroughly by multinuclear NMR spectroscopy. The data reveal hydrogen bonding of the fluorido ligand with HF molecules and the indolylphosphine ligand. Polyfluorido complexes 2a&#8208;f show larger &#9474;1J(F,Pt)&#9474;, but lower 1J(H,F) coupling constants when compared to the fluorido complexes 3a&#8208;f. Decreasing 1J(P,Pt) coupling constants in 2a&#8208;f and 3a&#8208;f suggest a cis influence of the aryl ligands in the following order: 4&#8208;tBuC6H4 (a) &#8776; 4&#8208;CH3C6H4 (b) &lt; Ph (c) &lt;&lt; 4&#8208;FC6H4 (d) &lt; 4&#8208;ClC6H4 (e) &lt; 4&#8208;CF3C6H4 (f). In addition, the larger cis influence of aryl ligands bearing electron withdrawing groups in the para position correlates with decreasing magnitudes of &#9474;1J(F,Pt)&#9474; coupling constants The interpretation of the experimental data was supported by quantum&#8208;chemical DFT calculations.</dc:description>

         <title>Sulfation of&#160; Heparan and Chondroitin Sulfate Ligands Enables Cell Specific Homing of Nanoprobes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Demystifying the sulfation code of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) to induce precise homing of nanoparticles in tumor or neuron cells influences the development of a potential drug or gene delivery system. However, GAGs, particularly heparan sulfate (HS) and chondroitin sulfate (CS), are structurally highly heterogeneous, and synthesizing well&#8208;defined HS/CS composed nanoparticles is challenging. Here, we decipher how specific sulfation patterns on HS and CS regulate receptor&#8208;mediated homing of nanoprobes in primary and secondary cells. We discovered that aggressive cancer cells such as MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;231 displayed a strong uptake of GAG&#8208;nanoprobes compared to mild or moderate aggressive cancer cells. However, there was no selectivity towards the GAG sequences, indicating the presence of more than one receptor mediated uptake. Whereas U87 cells, olfactory bulb and hippocampal primary neurons showed selective or preferential uptake of CS&#8208;E coated nanoprobes compared to other GAG&#8208;nanoprobes. Further, mechanistic studies revealed that 4,6&#8208;O&#8208;disulfated&#8208;CS nanoprobe utilized CD44 and caveolin&#8208;dependent endocytosis pathway for the uptake. These results imply new opportunities to use GAG nanoprobes in nanomedicine.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Demystifying the sulfation code of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) to induce precise homing of nanoparticles in tumor or neuron cells influences the development of a potential drug or gene delivery system. However, GAGs, particularly heparan sulfate (HS) and chondroitin sulfate (CS), are structurally highly heterogeneous, and synthesizing well-defined HS/CS composed nanoparticles is challenging. Here, we decipher how specific sulfation patterns on HS and CS regulate receptor-mediated homing of nanoprobes in primary and secondary cells. We discovered that aggressive cancer cells such as MDA-MB-231 displayed a strong uptake of GAG-nanoprobes compared to mild or moderate aggressive cancer cells. However, there was no selectivity towards the GAG sequences, indicating the presence of more than one receptor mediated uptake. Whereas U87 cells, olfactory bulb and hippocampal primary neurons showed selective or preferential uptake of CS-E coated nanoprobes compared to other GAG-nanoprobes. Further, mechanistic studies revealed that 4,6-O-disulfated-CS nanoprobe utilized CD44 and caveolin-dependent endocytosis pathway for the uptake. These results imply new opportunities to use GAG nanoprobes in nanomedicine.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Acridone&#8208;Based Host Materials for Green Phosphorescent and Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescent OLEDs with Low&#8208;Efficiency Roll&#8208;Offs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>

By combining carbazole and acridone units through pyridyl bridge, a bipolar host with highly twisted and rigid structure is developed, which guarantees the green phosphorescence and thermally activated delayed fluorescence OLEDs to exhibit remarkably low efficiency roll&#8208;offs.







Abstract
By linking the carbazole unit to the nitrogen atom of acridone through phenyl or pyridyl, two compounds, named 10&#8208;(4&#8208;(9H&#8208;carbazol&#8208;9&#8208;yl)phenyl)acridin&#8208;9(10H)&#8208;one (AC&#8208;Ph&#8208;Cz) and 10&#8208;(5&#8208;(9H&#8208;carbazol&#8208;9&#8208;yl)pyridin&#8208;2&#8208;yl)acridin&#8208;9(10H)&#8208;one (AC&#8208;Py&#8208;Cz) were designed and synthesized. These two materials, characterized with highly twisted and rigid structure, good thermal stability, and balanced carrier&#8208;transporting properties, were employed as host materials for green phosphorescent and thermally activated delayed fluorescent organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs). The carbazole group, despite its small contribution to the highest occupied molecular orbitals (HOMOs) of these two materials, plays an essential role as an intramolecular host in energy delivering and improving the hole transporting ability of these two hosts. The incorporation of the electron&#8208;deficient pyridyl group as a linking group slightly improves the electron transporting capability of AC&#8208;Py&#8208;Cz. The green phosphorescent OLED (PhOLED) based on AC&#8208;Py&#8208;Cz exhibited excellent device performance with a turn&#8208;on voltage of 2.5&#8197;V, a maximum power efficiency and an external quantum efficiency (&#951;ext) of 89.8&#8197;lm&#8201;W&#8722;1 and 25.2&#8201;%, respectively, benefitting from the better charge&#8208;balancing ability of AC&#8208;Py&#8208;Cz host due to the presence of the pyridyl bridge. More importantly, all the devices based on these two hosts showed low efficiency roll&#8208;off at high brightness due to the suppressed non&#8208;radiative transition in the emitting layer. In particular, the AC&#8208;Py&#8208;Cz&#8208;hosted green PhOLED exhibited an efficiency roll&#8208;off of 1.6&#8201;% from the maximum next at a high brightness of 1000&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2 and a roll&#8208;off of 15.9&#8201;% at an extremely high brightness of 10000&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2. This study manifests that acridone&#8208;based host materials have great potential in fabricating OLEDs with low efficiency roll&#8208;off.

         <title>Photochemically Enhanced Emission by Introducing Rational Photoactive Subunits into an Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission Luminogen</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rational design strategy was proposed by introducing photoactive thienyl and pyridyl groups an AIE&#8208;active tetraarylethene skeleton to achieve photochemical fluorescence enhancement behavior, which provides a valuable design principle for photoconvertable fluorophores by controllably regulating photophysical processes and photochemical reactions of AIEgens.







Abstract
Herein, we propose a rational design strategy by introducing photoactive thienyl and pyridyl groups into an AIE&#8208;active tetraarylethene skeleton to achieve highly efficient photochemistry&#8208;activated fluorescence enhancement from dominantly photo&#8208;physical aggregation&#8208;induced emission behavior, and prove that such photoactivated fluorescence enhancement is perfectly suited for superstable photocontrollable dual&#8208;mode patterning applications in both solution and solid matrix. It is found that the photoactivated fluorescence of designed AIEgen is attributed to the irreversible cyclized&#8208;dehydrogenation reaction under UV irradiation, and the oxidation product has a brighter fluorescence in both solution and solid states owning to its rigid and planar structure. The overall transformation rate of the AIEgen from its opened form to dehydrogenated form is up to nearly 100&#8201;% in a short period of UV irradiation, and the fast transformation and the stable product of this photochemical reaction guarantees super stability of photocontrolled patterning, which can be applied in photoactivated dual&#8208;mode patterning and advanced anti&#8208;counterfeiting.

         <title>Facile Synthesis of Liquid Crystal Dimers Bridged with a Phosphonic Group</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a novel synthesis strategy for facile access to a huge family of liquid crystal dimers or mono&#8208;addition homologues characterized with phosphonic group, which is readily achieved with P&#8722;C bonding through addition reaction between P&#8722;H and non&#8208;conjugated vinyl group. The introduced phosphonic group enables homeotropic alignment and further functionalization and one of the LC dimers exhibits NTB phase directly from the isotropic state.







Abstract
Liquid crystal (LC) dimers with well&#8208;defined composition and structure arouse broad attentions for their exhibiting LC properties beyond conventional low molar mass mesogens and serving as fascinating model compounds for LC polymers. Here in this work, a series of LC dimers bridged with a phosphonic group have been synthesized through a facile free radical mediated addition reaction between hypophosphorous acid and vinyl terminated cyanobiphenyl mesogens with variant length alkyl spacers. In addition, two esterified derivatives and a group of mono&#8208;addition homologues with a terminal phosphonic acid group have also been prepared for comparison study. All the newly synthesized compounds exhibit monotropic nematic (N) phase with typical schlieren textures except for the LC dimer with the longest eleven&#8208;methylene spacer, which surprisingly shows twist&#8208;bend nematic (NTB) phase directly from the isotropic state upon cooling. Moreover, the thermal transition properties such as the nematic&#8208;isotropic transition temperatures and associated entropy changes of the series LC dimers display a modest odd&#8208;even effect. Furthermore, both the LC dimers and the mono&#8208;addition homologues in N phase are quite easy to achieve homeotropic alignment upon annealing thanks to the supramolecular interactions between the introduced phosphonic acid group and the hydroxylated glass surface. This work thus provides a novel synthesis strategy for a class of LC materials bridged with a phosphonic acid group prone to further functionalization, which may serve as promising vertical alignment agents and pave the way for developing a new kind of functionalized LC materials of NTB phase.

         <title>Direct Aroylation of Olefins through a Cobalt/Photoredox&#8208;catalyzed Decarboxylative and Dehydrogenative Coupling with &#945;&#8722;Oxo Acids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A photoredox/cobalt dual catalytic procedure has been developed that allows benzoylation of olefins.

         <title>In&#8208;Situ Self&#8208;Catalyzed Growth of Manganese Embedded 3D Flakes&#8208;Coated Carbon Rod as an Efficient Oxygen Reduction Reaction Catalyst of Zinc&#8211;Air Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We demonstrate for the first time the in&#8208;situ self&#8208;catalyzed growth of manganese embedded 3D flakes&#8208;coated carbon rod (GFC) as an efficient ORR catalyst of Zinc&#8211;air batteries. By optimizing the amount of Mn in the precursor, we synthesize a series of 3D graphene&#8208;like flakes&#8208;coated carbon rods. GFC with a doping amount of Mn of 10% (GFC&#8208;10) exhibits excellent oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) performance with an onset potential of 0.94 V (vs. reversible hydrogen electrode). The Zinc&#8211;air battery is constructed with GFC&#8208;10 as the cathode catalyst, and it exhibits a peak power density of 128.9 mW cm&#8208;2 and a cycling stability of 75 h at a current density of 10 mA cm&#8211;2, which are superior to the commercial 20 wt % Pt/C&#8208;based Zinc&#8211;air battery. Interestingly, the introduction of Mn facilitates the self&#8208;catalyzed growth of carbon rods, and the change of Mn amount can effectively regulate the morphology of materials. The improved ORR performance of the catalyst is ascribed to the synergistic effect of unique hierarchical porous structure, high charge transport capacity, abundant carbon defects/edges and Mn&#8208;Nx sites. This research provides a new avenue to fabricating highly active Mn&#8208;based electrocatalysts for renewable energy systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrophile&#8208;Promoted Nucleophilic Cyclization of 2&#8208;Alkynylindoles to Give 4&#8208;Substituted Oxazinoindolones</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A method for the synthesis of 4&#8208;organoselanyl oxazinoindolone derivatives by the cascade cyclization of N&#8208;(alkoxycarbonyl)&#8208;2&#8208;alkynylindoles using iron(III) chloride and diorganyl diselenides as promoters was developed. This protocol was applied to a series of N&#8208;(alkoxycarbonyl)&#8208;2&#8208;alkynylindoles containing different substituents. The reaction conditions also tolerated a variety of diorganyl diselenides having both electron donating and electron withdrawing groups. However, the reaction did not work for diorganyl disulfides and ditellurides. The reaction mechanism seems to proceed via an ionic pathway and the cooperative action between iron(III) chloride and diorganyl diselenides is crucial for successful cyclization.&#160; We also found that using the same starting materials, by simply changing the electrophilic source to iodine, led to the formation of 4&#8208;iodo&#8208;oxazinoindolones. The high reactivity of Csp2&#8208;Se and Csp2&#8208;I bonds were tested under cross&#8208;coupling conditions leading to the preparation of a new class of functionalized indole derivatives. In addition, the absorption, emission and electrochemical properties of 4&#8208;organoselanyl oxazinoindolones showed an important relationship with the substituents of the aromatic rings. The advantages of the methodology include the use of electrophilic to promote the cyclization reaction and functionalization of the indole ring, and the electronic properties presented by the prepared compounds can be exploited as probes, analyte detectors and optical materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Sequential C&#8211;H methylation Catalyzed by the B12&#8208;dependent SAM Enzyme TokK: Comprehensive Theoretical Study of Selectivities</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>TokK is a B  12  &#8208;dependent radical SAM enzyme involved in the biosynthesis of the &#946;&#8208;lactam antibiotic asparenomycin A. It can catalyze three methylations on different sp  3  &#8208;hybridized carbon positions to introduce an isopropyl side chain at the &#946;&#8208;lactam ring of pantetheinylated carbapenem. Herein, we report a quantum chemical study of the reaction mechanism of TokK. A stepwise &#8216;&#8216;push&#8211;pull&#8217;&#8217; radical relay mechanism is proposed for each methylation: 5&#8217;&#8208;deoxyadenosine radical first abstracts a hydrogen atom from the substrate in the active site, then methylcobalamin directionally donates a methyl group to the substrate. More importantly, the calculations are able to uncover the origin of observed chemoselectivity and stereoselectivity for the first methylation and regioselectivity for the following two methylations. Further detailed distortion/interaction analysis can help to unravel the main factors controlling the selectivities. Our findings of sequential methylations by TokK may have profound implications for studying other B  12  &#8208;dependent radical SAM enzymes.</dc:description>

         <title>A Cascade Sonogashira Cross&#8208;Coupling&#8208;Substitution&#8208;Elimination Reaction for the Synthesis of Linear Conjugated Dienynes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Sonogashira cross&#8208;coupling, nucleophilic substitution and elimination cascade reaction allows the synthesis of otherwise difficult to obtain linear dienynes, in moderate to high yields. Ionic liquids are suitable recyclable solvents for the reaction. This synthetic strategy opens new ways to prepare highly conjugated alkenes and alkynes.







Abstract
The engagement in tandem of well&#8208;known organic reactions such as the Pd&#8208;catalyzed Sonogashira cross&#8208;coupling reaction, nucleophilic substitution and elimination reactions, enables the synthesis of otherwise difficult to obtain linear dienynes, in moderate to high yields. This retrosynthetic approach opens new ways to prepare highly conjugated alkenes and alkynes. Furthermore, ionic liquids are suitable solvents to perform the cascade reaction and recycle the metal catalysts.

         <title>Continuous&#8208;Flow Divergent Lithiation of 2,3&#8208;Dihalopyridines: Deprotolithiation versus Halogen Dance</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The divergent lithiation of 2,3&#8208;dihalopyridines is reported. Taking advantage of continuous&#8208;flow technology, either the deprotolithiation or the halogen dance is carried out. After subsequent trapping with various electrophiles, 25 examples of both regioisomers were obtained in excellent yields and selectivities. Finally, this methodology was scaled up and a promising space&#8208;time yield was obtained.







Abstract
We describe herein the first halogen dance (HD) in continuous flow on 2&#8208;chloro&#8208;3&#8208;bromopyridine by selectively trapping a (pyridin&#8208;4&#8208;yl)lithium species that is known to undergo the halogen&#8208;dance process. In addition, this lithiated intermediate was trapped at lower temperature before the HD occurs. The HD process was extended to fluoro&#8208;iodopyridines by using various electrophiles to afford 28 examples with yields ranging from 42 to 97&#8201;% with very short residence times. Finally, scale up of the reaction was demonstrated, affording a promising space&#8208;time yield (STY) of 4.2&#8197;kg.h&#8722;1.L&#8722;1.

A designed strategy for a highly efficient protocol for the diastereodivergent construction of gem&#8208;dibroylcyclopropanes has been established. This was accomplished via the Pd(OAc)2&#8208;catalyzed cyclopropanation reaction of the gem&#8208;diborylalkene &#8220;carbenophile&#8208;reactive&#8221; groups with different &#945;&#8208;diazoarylacetates and &#945;&#8208;diazoaryl&#8208;CF3.







Abstract
We report a designed stereodivergent strategy for the synthesis of gem&#8208;diborylcyclopropanes. The reaction provides a highly modular approach to prepare cyclopropane ring variants bearing gem&#8208;(Bpin,Bpin), gem&#8208;(Bpin,Bdan), and gem&#8208;(Bpin,BF3K), with outstanding levels of stereocontrol. This was achieved by diastereoselective Pd&#8208;catalyzed cyclopropanation reactions of gem&#8208;diborylalkenes with &#945;&#8208;diazoarylacetates and &#945;&#8208;diazoaryl&#8208;trifluoromethyl. The key to the success of this general protocol was the diastereoselective trifluorination reaction of gem&#8208;diborylcyclopropanes, followed by the stereospecific interconversion of the trifluoroborate salts into the Bdan group.

         <title>Light&#8208;Responsive Oligothiophenes Incorporating Photochromic Torsional Switches</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Twist it! A light&#8208;responsive molecular design to tune the &#960;&#8208;conjugation extension of oligothiophenes has been established. The relationship between molecular structure and optoelectronic properties was comprehensively studied both experimentally and theoretically. The results highlight the functionality of the proposed molecular architecture as a promising candidate for the development of novel light&#8208;responsive optoelectronic technologies.







Abstract
We present a quaterthiophene and sexithiophene that can reversibly change their effective &#960;&#8208;conjugation length through photoexcitation. The reported compounds make use of light&#8208;responsive molecular actuators consisting of an azobenzene attached to a bithiophene unit by both direct and linker&#8208;assisted bonding. Upon exposure to 350&#8197;nm light, the azobenzene undergoes trans&#8208;to&#8208;cis isomerization, thus mechanically inducing the oligothiophene to assume a planar conformation (extended &#960;&#8208;conjugation). Exposure to 254&#8197;nm wavelength promotes azobenzene cis&#8208;to&#8208;trans isomerization, forcing the thiophenic backbones to twist out of planarity (confined &#960;&#8208;conjugation). Twisted conformations are also reached by cis&#8208;to&#8208;trans thermal relaxation at a rate that increases proportionally with the conjugation length of the oligothiophene moiety. The molecular conformations of quaterthiophene and sexithiophene were characterized by using steady&#8208;state UV&#8208;vis spectroscopy, X&#8208;ray crystallography and quantum&#8208;chemical modeling. Finally, we tested the proposed light&#8208;responsive oligothiophenes in field&#8208;effect transistors to probe the photo&#8208;induced tuning of their electronic properties.

         <title>Molecular Engineering of Push&#8208;Pull Diphenylsulfone Derivatives towards Aggregation&#8208;Induced Narrowband Deep Blue Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence (TADF) Emitters</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Accompanying effects of restricted intramolecular rotations and intermolecular interactions in D&#8722;A&#8722;D&#8217; typed molecules led to successively blue&#8208;shifted wavelength and narrowed bandwidth from solution to amorphous film then to crystals, realizing deep blue TADF (&#955;=424&#8197;nm, CIE coordinate of (0.15, 0.08), &#916;EST=0.07&#8197;eV) with FWHM of 64&#8197;nm in crystals of tBuO&#8208;SOmAD.







Abstract
Narrowband deep blue thermally activated delayed fluorescent (TADF) materials have attracted significant attention. Herein, four asymmetrical structured TADF emitters based on diphenylsulfone (DPS) acceptor and 9,9&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;9,10&#8208;dihydroacridine (DMAC) donor with progressive performances were developed. The tert&#8208;butyloxy auxiliary electron&#8208;donor was adopted to restrict the intramolecular rotations and provide efficient steric hindrance. Regioisomerization by altering the substitution position of DMAC on DPS unit further enhanced the intra&#8208; and inter&#8208;molecular interactions. The accompanying effects yielded increased energy level, minimized reorganization energy, and inhibited non&#8208;radiative transitions in the crystals of tBuO&#8208;SOmAD, which achieved narrowband deep&#8208;blue emission peaking at 424&#8197;nm (FWHM=64&#8197;nm, &#934;F=33.6&#8201;%) through aggregation&#8208;induced, blue&#8208;shifted emission (AIBSE). In addition, deep&#8208;blue organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs) based on tBuO&#8208;SOmAD realized the electroluminescence (EL) spectrum peaking located at 435&#8197;nm and CIE coordination of (0.12, 0.09).

         <title>An Endoplasmic Reticulum Targeting Type I Photosensitizer for Effective Photodynamic Therapy against Hypoxic Tumor Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ER&#8208;targeted benzophenothiazine&#8208;based photosensitizer NBS&#8208;ER was constructed, which triggered ER stress and induced apoptosis with significantly reduced dark toxicity and improved phototoxicity index (PI). In addition, excellent photodynamic therapeutic effect of NBS&#8208;ER was demonstrated in 4T1&#8208;tumor&#8208;bearing mice.







Abstract
Organelle&#8208;targeted type I photodynamic therapy (PDT) shows great potential to overcome the hypoxic microenvironment in solid tumors. The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is an indispensable organelle in cells with important biological functions. When the ER is damaged due to the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), the accumulation of misfolded proteins will interfere with ER homeostasis, resulting in ER stress. Here, an ER&#8208;targeted benzophenothiazine&#8208;based photosensitizer NBS&#8208;ER was presented. ER targeting modification significantly reduced the dark toxicity and improved phototoxicity index (PI). NBS&#8208;ER could effectively produce O2&#8722;&#8901; with near&#8208;infrared irradiation, making its phototoxicity under hypoxia close to that under normoxia. Meanwhile, the photoinduced ROS triggered ER stress and induced apoptosis. In addition, NBS&#8208;ER possessed excellent photodynamic therapeutic effect in 4T1&#8208;tumor&#8208;bearing mice.

         <title>Probing the Structural Dynamics of a Bacterial Chaperone in Its Native Environment by Nitroxide&#8208;Based EPR Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Take a quick look: NarJ protein structural dynamics was investigated by SDSL&#8208;EPR in the complex environment of the cell. In particular, we exploited the sensitivity of nitroxide labels to report protein dynamics at room temperature. Moreover, we demonstrated that such studies can be performed within 15&#8197;minutes, thus preserving both cell integrity and the activity of the protein under investigation.







Abstract
One of the greatest current challenges in structural biology is to study protein dynamics over a wide range of timescales in complex environments, such as the cell. Among magnetic resonances suitable for this approach, electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy coupled to site&#8208;directed spin labeling (SDSL&#8208;EPR) has emerged as a promising tool to study protein local dynamics and conformational ensembles. In this work, we exploit the sensitivity of nitroxide labels to report protein local dynamics at room temperature. We demonstrate that such studies can be performed while preserving both the integrity of the cells and the activity of the protein under investigation. Using this approach, we studied the structural dynamics of the chaperone NarJ in its natural host, Escherichia coli. We established that spin&#8208;labeled NarJ is active inside the cell. We showed that the cellular medium affects NarJ structural dynamics in a site&#8208;specific way, while the structural flexibility of the protein is maintained. Finally, we present and discuss data on the time&#8208;resolved dynamics of NarJ in cellular context.

         <title>Selective and Reversible Solvent Uptake in Tetra&#8208;4&#8208;(4&#8208;pyridyl)phenylmethane&#8208;based Supramolecular Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
TPPM&#8208;based Supramolecular Organic Frameworks (SOFs) undergo reversible single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal transformations when exposed to vapours of selected organic solvents and heat, respectively. The observed selectivity is dictated by the fitting of the guest in the expanded SOFs, following the degree of packing coefficient.







Abstract
The dynamic behavior of supramolecular organic frameworks (SOFs) based on the rigid tetra&#8208;4&#8208;(4&#8208;pyridyl)phenylmethane (TPPM) organic tecton has been elucidated through 3D electron diffraction, X&#8208;ray powder diffraction and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) analysis. The SOF undergoes a reversible single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal transformation when exposed to vapours of selected organic solvents, moving from a closed structure with isolated small voids to an expanded structure with solvated channels along the b axis. The observed selectivity is dictated by the fitting of the guest in the expanded SOF, following the degree of packing coefficient. The effect of solvent uptake on TPPM solid&#8208;state fluorescence was investigated, evidencing a significant variation in the emission profile only in the presence of chloroform.

         <title>Chiral Anthranyl Trifluoromethyl Alcohols: Structures, Oxidative Dearomatization and Chiroptical Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chiral diphenylanthracenes with two fluorinated alcohols have two stereogenic centers and syn/anti atropisomery. Consequently, depending on their stereochemistry, they make different Hydrogen&#8208;bonded self&#8208;assemblies in the solid state, whereas in solution, they specifically react to provide different chiral dearomatized bisfluorinated ethers. The chiroptical properties of all anthranyl fluorinated molecules have been compared.







Abstract
Chiral trifluoromethyl alcohol groups were introduced at the hindered ortho positions of 9,10&#8208;diphenylanthracenes to investigate their effects on the physical properties and reactivity towards oxidative dearomatization. In such compact structures, the position in different quadrants and the preferred orientation of the &#8722;CH(OH)CF3 groups were determined by the relative and absolute configurations of each stereoisomer, respectively. As a consequence, the stereochemistry governs the organization of the H&#8208;bonded molecules in single crystals (homochiral dimers vs ribbon), whereas in chlorinated solvents, they all behave as discrete compounds. Concerning their reactivity, the stereospecific dearomative oxidation of these molecules leads to 9,10&#8208;bis&#8208;spiro&#8208;isobenzofuran&#8208;anthracenes, when using organic single&#8208;electron transfer oxidants. The chiroptical properties of the alcohols and the corresponding dearomatized products were compared and showed an important modulation of the intensity.

         <title>Photophysics of Anionic Bis(4H&#8208;imidazolato)CuI Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Homoleptic CuI 4H&#8208;imidazolate complexes show a remarkably broad and intense absorption spectrum ranging from the UV to NIR. The excited state decay pathways of four complexes selected for their electron&#8208;withdrawing and steric properties were studied by fs transient absorption spectroscopy and spectro&#8208;electrochemistry. A model&#8208;free 2D correlation approach was applied for data evaluation.







Abstract
In this paper, the photophysical behavior of four panchromatically absorbing, homoleptic bis(4H&#8208;imidazolato)CuI complexes, with a systematic variation in the electron&#8208;withdrawing properties of the imidazolate ligand, were studied by wavelength&#8208;dependent time&#8208;resolved femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy. Excitation at 400, 480, and 630&#8197;nm populates metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge transfer, intraligand charge transfer, and mixed&#8208;character singlet states. The pump wavelength&#8208;dependent transient absorption data were analyzed by a recently established 2D correlation approach. Data analysis revealed that all excitation conditions yield similar excited&#8208;state dynamics. Key to the excited&#8208;state relaxation is fast, sub&#8208;picosecond pseudo&#8208;Jahn&#8208;Teller distortion, which is accompanied by the relocalization of electron density onto a single ligand from the initially delocalized state at Franck&#8208;Condon geometry. Subsequent intersystem crossing to the triplet manifold is followed by a sub&#8208;100&#8197;ps decay to the ground state. The fast, nonradiative decay is rationalized by the low triplet&#8208;state energy as found by DFT calculations, which suggest perspective treatment at the strong coupling limit of the energy gap law.

         <title>Bromine Pentafluoride BrF5, the Formation of [BrF6]&#8722; Salts, and the Stereochemical (In)activity of the Bromine Lone Pairs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Taking a closer look: We present the photochemical synthesis of BrF5, its high&#8208; and low&#8208;temperature crystal structures, its reactions with some alkali metal fluorides and a discussion of the free valence electron pairs on the bromine atoms of the BrF5 molecules and [BrF6]&#8722; anions by using intrinsic bond orbitals.







Abstract
BrF5 can be prepared by treating BrF3 with fluorine under UV light in the region of 300 to 400&#8197;nm at room temperature. It was analyzed by UV&#8208;Vis, NMR, IR and Raman spectroscopy. Its crystal structure was redetermined by X&#8208;ray diffraction, and its space group was corrected to Pnma. Quantum&#8208;chemical calculations were performed for the band assignment of the vibrational spectra. A monoclinic polymorph of BrF5 was quantum chemically predicted and then observed as its low&#8208;temperature modification in space group P21/c by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. BrF5 reacts with the alkali metal fluorides AF (A=K, Rb) to form alkali metal hexafluoridobromates(V), A[BrF6] the crystal structures of which have been determined. Both compounds crystallize in the K[AsF6] structure type (R
, no. 148, hR24). For the species [BrF6]+, BrF5, [BrF6]&#8722;, and [IF6]&#8722;, the chemical bonds and lone pairs on the heavy atoms were investigated by means of intrinsic bond orbital analysis.

         <title>Self&#8208;Repairable and Flexible Polymer Network Electrolyte with Enhanced Lithium&#8208;Ion Conduction for Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Self&#8208;healing quasi&#8208;solid polymer electrolyte (SIPH&#8208;x&#8208;y%) with good flexibility was prepared by polyaddition method. SIPH&#8208;x&#8208;y% could show high room temperature ionic conductivity, high lithium ion transference number, and good interfacial stability with electrode. The Li/LFP battery assembled with SIPH&#8208;20&#8208;40% showed high specific capacity and excellent cycle performance.







Abstract
Developing high&#8208;performance functional polymer&#8208;based electrolytes is important for realizing next generation safe lithium metal batteries. In this study, a new type of quasi&#8208;solid polymer network electrolyte (SIPH&#8208;x&#8208;y%) was prepared by combining synthesized polymer network (SIPH) containing urethane bond linked ionic liquids (ILs), polyethylene glycol (PEG), and disulfide bond moieties, lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide salt (LiTFSI), and glyme type additive. It was found that SIPH&#8208;20&#8208;40% was mechanically flexible, self&#8208;healable, and showed high ionic conductivity of 2.67&#215;10&#8722;4&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1. Also, SIPH&#8208;20&#8208;40% possesses a high lithium ion transference number of 0.43 and good electrochemical stability. These properties enabled the SIPH&#8208;20&#8208;40% electrolyte membrane to support Li/Li symmetrical cell to cycle stably during long term Li plating and stripping. The Li/SIPH&#8208;20&#8208;40%/LFP showed high delivered specific capacity and good stability (166.1&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 106 cycles at 0.2&#8197;C). Such glyme doped polymer network electrolyte provides new experimental findings for developing polymer&#8208;based electrolyte with excellent mechanical integrity and battery related properties.

         <title>A Porous Polyaromatic Solid for Vapor Adsorption of Xylene with High Efficiency, Selectivity, and Reusability</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new porous polyaromatic solid displays unusual vapor adsorption behavior toward VOCs under ambient conditions, such as vapor adsorption of benzene over cyclohexane with 90&#8201;% selectivity, high affinity toward o&#8208;xylene over benzene and toluene with &gt;80&#8201;% selectivity, and ortho&#8208;selective adsorption ability (&gt;50&#8201;%) from mixed xylene isomers.







Abstract
Development of porous materials capable of capturing volatile organic compounds (VOCs), such as benzene and its derivatives, with high efficiency, selectivity, and reusability is highly demanded. Here we report unusual vapor adsorption behavior toward VOCs by a new porous solid, composed of a polyaromatic capsule bearing a spherical nanocavity with subnano&#8208;sized windows. Without prior crystallization and high&#8208;temperature vacuum drying, the porous polyaromatic solid exhibits the following five features: vapor adsorption of benzene over cyclohexane with 90&#8201;% selectivity, high affinity toward o&#8208;xylene over benzene and toluene with &gt;80&#8201;% selectivity, ortho&#8208;selective adsorption ability (&gt;50&#8201;%) from mixed xylene isomers, tight VOCs storage even under high temperature and vacuum conditions, and at least 5&#8197;times reusability for xylene adsorption. The observed adsorption abilities are accomplished at ambient temperature and pressure within 1&#8197;h, which has not been demonstrated by organic/inorganic porous materials reported previously.

         <title>Functional Nanomaterial&#8208;Modified Anodes in Microbial Fuel Cells: Advances and Perspectives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Profiting from superior electrical properties, porosity, specific surface area and biocompatibility, nanomaterials show tremendous potential in promoting the power supply of microbial fuel cells. This Review provides an outline of recent progress on anode modification nanomaterials in microbial fuel cells from the viewpoint of different binding modes of bacteria and materials.







Abstract
Microbial fuel cell (MFC) is a promising approach that could utilize microorganisms to oxidize biodegradable pollutants in wastewater and generate electrical power simultaneously. Introducing advanced anode nanomaterials is generally considered as an effective way to enhance MFC performance by increasing bacterial adhesion and facilitating extracellular electron transfer (EET). This review focuses on the key advances of recent anode modification materials, as well as the current understanding of the microbial EET process occurring at the bacteria&#8208;electrode interface. Based on the difference in combination mode of the exoelectrogens and nanomaterials, anode surface modification, hybrid biofilm construction and single&#8208;bacterial surface modification strategies are elucidated exhaustively. The inherent mechanisms may help to break through the performance output bottleneck of MFCs by rational design of EET&#8208;related nanomaterials, and lead to the widespread application of microbial electrochemical systems.
