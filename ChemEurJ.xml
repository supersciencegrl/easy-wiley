         <title>Conformational Switching through the One&#8208;Electron Reduction of an Acridinium&#8208;based, &#947;&#8208;Cationic Phosphine Gold Complex</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Switch it: The reduction of the acridinium&#8208;based &#947;&#8208;cationic phosphine gold chloride complex neutralizes the carbenium unit and affords a stable radical. Due to a perturbation of the electrostatic potential profile of the complex and donor&#8211;acceptor bonding interactions, this reduction alters the complex's conformation, with the linear phosphine&#8208;gold&#8208;chloride moiety undergoing a windshield&#8208;wiper&#8208;type motion over the surface of the acridinium ring.







Abstract
Our efforts in the chemistry of gold complexes featuring ambiphilic phosphine&#8208;carbenium L/Z&#8208;type ligand have led us to consider the reduction of the carbenium moiety as a means to modulate the gold&#8211;carbenium interaction present in these complexes. Here, it was shown that the one&#8208;electron reduction of [(o&#8208;Ph2P(C6H4)Acr)AuCl]+ (Acr=9&#8208;N&#8208;methylacridinium) produces a neutral stable radical, the structure of which showed a marked increase in the Au&#8211;Acr distance. Related structural changes were observed for the phosphine oxide analogue [(o&#8208;Ph2P(O)(C6H4)Acr]+, the reduction of which interfered with the P=O&#8594;carbenium interaction. These structural effects, driven by a reduction&#8208;induced change in the electronic and electrostatic characteristics of the compounds, showed that the charge and accepting properties of the carbenium unit can be modulated. These results highlight the redox&#8208;noninnocence of carbenium Z&#8208;type ligand, a feature that can be exploited to induce specific conformational changes.

         <title>One&#8208;Pot Dual C&#8722;C Coupling Reaction via Site Selective Cascade Formation by PdII&#8208;Cryptate of an Amino&#8208;Ether Heteroditopic Macrobicycle</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
PdII catalysed site selective dual C&#8722;C Coupling in the presence of heteroditopic macrobicycle was achieved to synthesize symmetrical and unsymmetrical conjugated 1,3&#8208;diynes.







Abstract
Selectivity of aryl iodo over ethynyl iodo toward the Suzuki cross coupling reaction is explored by utilizing a palladium complex of amino&#8208;ether heteroditopic macrobicycle. Subsequently, unreacted ethynyl iodide undergoes homocoupling reaction in the same catalytic atmosphere, thereby representing a cascade dual C&#8722;C coupling reaction. Furthermore, this approach is extended for novel one&#8208;pot synthesis of unsymmetrical 1,3&#8208;diynes.

         <title>Rational Molecular Design of Multifunctional Blue&#8208;Emitting Materials Based on Phenanthroimidazole Derivatives.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Deeper blue: On the basis of multifunctional phenanthroimidazole&#8208;based material PTPBPTA, which acts both as a deep&#8208;blue fluorescent emitter and as a host material for phosphors, high&#8208;performance deep&#8208;blue fluorescent organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs), yellow and red phosphorescent OLEDs, and a white OLED were fabricated.







Abstract
High&#8208;performance deep&#8208;blue emitters with external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) exceeding 5&#8201;% are still scarce in organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs). In this work, by introducing a [1,2,4]triazolo[1,5&#8208;a] pyridine (TP) unit at the N1 position of phenanthroimidazole (PI), two luminescent materials, PTPTPA and PTPTPA, were obtained. Systematic photophysical analysis showed that the TP block is suitable for constructing hybridized local and charge&#8208;transfer (HLCT) emitters. Its moderate electron&#8208;withdrawing ability and rigid planar structure can enhance the CT component while ensuring color purity. In addition, compared with PTPTPA, the additional phenyl ring of PTPBPTA not only increased the oscillator strength, but also decreased the Stokes shift. TDDFT calculations pointed out facile reverse intersystem crossing processes in PTPTPA from high&#8208;lying triplet states to the singlet excited state. A nondoped device based on PTPTPA as emitter showed impressive performance with EQEmax of 7.11&#8201;% and CIE coordinates of (0.15, 0.09). At the same time, it was also an efficient host for yellow and red phosphorescent OLEDs. By doping yellow (PPYBA) and red (BTPG) phosphorescent dyes into PTPTPA, a white OLED with a high EQE of 23.85&#8201;% was achieved. The successful design of PTPTPA not only provided an optimization choice for OLED emitters, but also demonstrated the empirical rules for the design of multifunctional deep&#8208;blue emitters.

         <title>Synergistic Effect of Boron Nitride and Carbon Domains in Boron Carbide Nitride Nanotube Supported Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts for Efficient Nitrogen Fixation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single metal atoms supported on boron carbide nitride nanotubes are considered as promising electrocatalysts for N2 reduction to NH3 with high activity and selectivity. The outstanding performance is ascribed to the synergistic effect of boron nitride and carbon domains, which tuned the charge polarization of metal&#8208;atom active site and the electronic properties of material.







Abstract
Developing the low&#8208;cost and efficient single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) for nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) is of great importance while remains as a great challenge. The catalytic activity, selectivity and durability are all fundamentally related to the elaborate coordination environment of SACs. Using first&#8208;principles calculations, we investigated the SACs with single transition metal (TM) atom supported on defective boron carbide nitride nanotubes (BCNTs) as NRR electrocatalysts. Our results suggest that boron&#8208;vacancy defects on BCNTs can strongly immobilize TM atoms with large enough binding energy and high thermal/structural stability. Importantly, the synergistic effect of boron nitride (BN) and carbon domains comes up with the modifications of the charge polarization of single&#8208;TM&#8208;atom active site and the electronic properties of material, which has been proven to be the essential key to promote N2 adsorption, activation, and reduction. Specifically, six SACs (namely V, Mn, Fe, Mo, Ru, and W atoms embedded into defective BCNTs) can be used as promising candidates for NRR electrocatalysts as their NRR activity is higher than the state&#8208;of&#8208;the art Ru(0001) catalyst. In particular, single Mo atom supported on defective BCNTs with large tube diameter possesses the highest NRR activity while suppressing the competitive hydrogen evolution reaction, with a low limiting potential of &#8722;0.62&#8197;V via associative distal path. This work suggests new opportunities for driving NH3 production by carbon&#8208;based single&#8208;atom electrocatalysts under ambient conditions.

Fit in the groove: Hybrid DNAs with Watson&#8211;Crick and purine&#8211;purine base pairs decorated with dendritic side chains are prepared. Space&#8208;demanding side chains introduced into the 7&#8208;position of 5&#8208;aza&#8208;7&#8208;deazaguanine&#8211;isoguanine base pairs are well accommodated in the large groove of purine&#8211;purine DNA and have a positive impact on helix stability.







Abstract
The Watson&#8211;Crick coding system depends on the molecular recognition of complementary purine and pyrimidine bases. Now, the construction of hybrid DNAs with Watson&#8211;Crick and purine&#8211;purine base pairs decorated with dendritic side chains was performed. Oligonucleotides with single and multiple incorporations of 5&#8208;aza&#8208;7&#8208;deaza&#8208;2&#8242;&#8208;deoxyguanosine, its tripropargylamine derivative, and 2&#8242;&#8208;deoxyisoguanosine were synthesized. Duplex stability decreased if single modified purine&#8211;purine base pairs were inserted, but increased if pyrene residues were introduced by click chemistry. A growing number of consecutive 5&#8208;aza&#8208;7&#8208;deazaguanine&#8211;isoguanine base pairs led to strong stepwise duplex stabilization, a phenomenon not observed for the guanine&#8211;isoguanine base pair. Spacious residues are well accommodated in the large groove of purine&#8211;purine DNA tracts. Changes to the global helical structure monitored by circular dichroism spectroscopy show the impact of functionalization to the global double&#8208;helix structure. This study explores new areas of molecular recognition realized by purine base pairs that are complementary in hydrogen bonding, but not in size, relative to canonical pairs.

Gold (I)&#8208;catalyzed higher&#8208;order cycloaddition: 8&#8208;Aryl&#8208;8&#8208;azafulvenes undergo a regioselective gold catalyzed [8+2] cycloaddition with electron&#8208;rich allenamines and ynamides to give dihydrocyclohepta[b]pyrrole derivatives. The cyclization takes place after the nucleophilic attack of the heptafulvene to the electrophilic intermediates formed by the coordination of cationic gold to either allene or triple bond moieties of the unsaturated systems.







Abstract
Gold(I)&#8208;catalyzed higher&#8208;order [8+2] cycloadditions of 8&#8208;aryl&#8208;8&#8208;azaheptafulvenes 1 with allenamides 2 and ynamides 3 were studied. 1,8&#8208;Dihydrocycloheptapyrroles 4 were achieved by a regioselective [8+2] cycloaddition of azaheptafulvenes 1 and allenamides 2 in the presence of (2,4&#8208;ditBuC6H3O)3PAuNTf2 as catalyst. Besides, ynamides 3 and 8&#8208;aryl&#8208;8&#8208;azaheptafulvenes 1, undergo a regioselective [8+2] cycloaddition, to give 2&#8208;amido&#8208;1,4&#8208;dihydrocycloheptapyrroles 7 in the presence of JohnPhosAuNTf2 as catalyst. Both reactions take place with good yields and with a variety of substituents. A plausible mechanism hypothesis suggests a nucleophilic attack of the 8&#8208;azaheptafulvene to the gold activated electron rich allene or alkyne moieties of the allenamide and ynamide, respectively.

The material PTPBTPA is reported in this work, which is shown in blue in the cover picture. It can act as a high&#8208;efficiency deep blue emitter as well as an efficient host material for yellow (the color of the bull in the image) and red (the festive color, indicating the coming of the Spring Festival) phosphors. Combining the blue fluorescence and yellow or red phosphorescence produced high&#8208;performance WOLED, which emits white light as the color of the external circle.

         <title>A DNA&#8208;Encoded Chemical Library Based on Peptide Macrocycles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A DNA&#8208;encoded chemical library (DEL) based on canonical and non&#8208;canonical peptide macrocycles (YO&#8208;DEL) was generated. The single&#8208;stranded format allowed for selections by affinity capture, through a novel selection method exploiting the competition with an antibody fragment and the annealing to a photoreactive moiety which allowed for selections by a photocrosslinking approach. The YO&#8208;DEL yielded ligands against proteins of pharmaceutical interest such as CAIX, HSA and NKp46, a protein expressed on the surface of activated NK&#8208;cells.







Abstract
The synthesis and characterization of a novel DNA&#8208;encoded library of macrocyclic peptide derivatives are described; the macrocycles are based on three sets of proteinogenic and non&#8208;proteinogenic amino acid building blocks and featuring the use of copper(I)&#8208;catalyzed alkyne&#8208;azide cycloaddition (CuAAC) reaction for ring closure. The library (termed YO&#8208;DEL) which contains 1&#8201;254&#8201;838 compounds, was encoded with DNA in single&#8208;stranded format and was screened against target proteins of interest using affinity capture procedures and photocrosslinking. YO&#8208;DEL selections yielded specific binders against serum albumins, carbonic anhydrases and NKp46, a marker of activated Natural Killer cells.

         <title>Bifunctional Hydrogen Bond Donor&#8208;Catalyzed Diels&#8211;Alder Reactions: Origin of Stereoselectivity and Rate Enhancement</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 16, Page 5180-5190, March 17, 2021. </description>

Speed it up! Quantum chemical activation strain analyses reveal that (thio)urea&#8208;derived bifunctional hydrogen bond organocatalysts accelerate the Diels&#8211;Alder reaction between cyclopentadiene and acrolein by reducing the two&#8208;center four&#8208;electron (steric) Pauli repulsion between the occupied &#960;&#8208;orbitals of the reactants and not by enhancing the donor&#8211;acceptor orbital interactions, as is traditionally considered.







Abstract
The selectivity and rate enhancement of bifunctional hydrogen bond donor&#8208;catalyzed Diels&#8211;Alder reactions between cyclopentadiene and acrolein were quantum chemically studied using density functional theory in combination with coupled&#8208;cluster theory. (Thio)ureas render the studied Diels&#8211;Alder cycloaddition reactions exo selective and induce a significant acceleration of this process by lowering the reaction barrier by up to 7&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1. Our activation strain and Kohn&#8211;Sham molecular orbital analyses uncover that these organocatalysts enhance the Diels&#8211;Alder reactivity by reducing the Pauli repulsion between the closed&#8208;shell filled &#960;&#8208;orbitals of the diene and dienophile, by polarizing the &#960;&#8208;orbitals away from the reactive center and not by making the orbital interactions between the reactants stronger. In addition, we establish that the unprecedented exo selectivity of the hydrogen bond donor&#8208;catalyzed Diels&#8211;Alder reactions is directly related to the larger degree of asynchronicity along this reaction pathway, which is manifested in a relief of destabilizing activation strain and Pauli repulsion.

Our activation strain and Kohn&#8211;Sham molecular orbital analyses uncover that these organocatalysts enhance the Diels&#8211;Alder reactivity by reducing the Pauli repulsion between the closed&#8208;shell filled &#960;&#8208;orbitals of the diene and dienophile, by polarizing the &#960;&#8208;orbitals away from the reactive center and not by making the orbital interactions between the reactants stronger. In addition, we establish that the unprecedented &lt;i&gt;exo&lt;/i&gt; selectivity of the hydrogen bond donor&#8208;catalyzed Diels&#8211;Alder reactions is directly related to the larger degree of asynchronicity along this reaction pathway, which is manifested in a relief of destabilizing activation strain and Pauli repulsion.&lt;/p&gt;

Fast explosive detection: New luminescent cadmium&#8208;based coordination polymers are presented. The nature of the ligand has a strong influence on the light&#8208;emitting properties of these materials. Their remarkable sensitivity and selectivity to highly explosive picric acid or nitrophenol together with their excellent recyclability render them promising candidates for the detection of explosives, where fast responses are needed.







Abstract
Three new cadmium&#8208;based coordination polymers, denoted [Cd(hfipbb)(4,4&#8217;&#8208;bipy)] (CdPF&#8208;1), [Cd(hfipbb)(2,2&#8217;&#8208;bipy)] (CdPF&#8208;2), and [Cd(hfipbb)(1,10&#8208;phen)] (CdPF&#8208;3), have been hydrothermally synthesized by using the well&#8208;known V&#8208;shaped organic linker 4,4&#8217;&#8208;(hexafluoroisopropylidene)bis(benzoic acid) (H2hfipbb), together with different nitrogenated auxiliary linkers. Considering the d10 configuration of the transition metal selected, the luminescent properties for these CdPF&#8208;n materials were explored, finding that materials CdPF&#8208;2 and CdPF&#8208;3 act as excellent sensors in the detection of explosive nitro aromatic compounds. The photoluminescence properties of CdPF&#8208;2 and CdPF&#8208;3 revealed that significant and sensitive fluorescence quenching was observed toward NP (nitrophenol) for CdPF&#8208;2 and PA (picric acid) for CdPF&#8208;3 in MeOH suspensions.

DNA cross&#8208;linking: Two series of 1,1&#8242;&#8208;biphenyl analogues with various leaving groups (L=OAc, OCH3, OCHCH=CH2, OCH2Ph, SPh, SePh, and Ph3P+) are synthesized and their reactivity towards DNA and the reaction mechanism are investigated by determining DNA interstrand cross&#8208;link (ICL) efficiency, radical and carbocation formation, and the cross&#8208;linking reaction sites. The ICL efficiency and the reaction rate strongly depend on the combined effect of the leaving group and the substituent.







Abstract
Two series of 1,1&#8242;&#8208;biphenyl analogues with various leaving groups (L=OAc, OCH3, OCHCH=CH2, OCH2Ph, SPh, SePh, and Ph3P+) were synthesized. Their reactivity towards DNA and the reaction mechanism were investigated by determining DNA interstrand cross&#8208;link (ICL) efficiency, radical and carbocation formation, and the cross&#8208;linking reaction sites. All compounds induced DNA ICL formation upon 350&#8197;nm irradiation via a carbocation that was generated from oxidation of the corresponding free radicals. The ICL efficiency and the reaction rate strongly depended on the combined effect of the leaving group and the substituent. Among all compounds tested, the high ICL efficiency (30&#8211;43&#8201;%) and fast reaction rate were observed with compounds carrying a nitrophenyl group and acetate (2&#8201;a), ether (2&#8201;b and 2&#8201;c), or triphenylphosphonium salt (2&#8201;g) as leaving groups. Most compounds with a 4&#8208;methoxybenzene group showed similar DNA ICL efficiency (&#8776;30&#8201;%) with a slow DNA cross&#8208;linking reaction rate. Both cation trapping and free radical trapping adducts were detected in the photo activation process of these compounds, which provided direct evidence for the proposed mechanism. Heat stability study in combination with sequence study suggested that these photo&#8208;generated benzyl cations alkylate DNA at dG, dA, and dC sites.

         <title>Bis(phenylethynyl)arene Linkers in Tetracationic Bis&#8208;triarylborane Chromophores Control Fluorimetric and Raman Sensing of Various DNAs and RNAs</title>

Aromatic alternative: Four bis&#8208;triarylborane chromophores with high binding affinities to DNA and RNA are reported. Three of them employ bis(phenylethynyl)arene linkers and are strongly fluorescent and highly Raman active. Fluorimetric titration experiments reveal distinct aggregation&#8211;deaggregation processes for two of the compounds, and molecular modelling of complexes of the compounds with DNA illustrates and corroborates the experimental findings.







Abstract
We report four new luminescent tetracationic bis&#8208;triarylborane DNA and RNA sensors that show high binding affinities, in several cases even in the nanomolar range. Three of the compounds contain substituted, highly emissive and structurally flexible bis(2,6&#8208;dimethylphenyl&#8208;4&#8208;ethynyl)arene linkers (3: arene=5,5&#8242;&#8208;2,2&#8242;&#8208;bithiophene; 4: arene=1,4&#8208;benzene; 5: arene=9,10&#8208;anthracene) between the two boryl moieties and serve as efficient dual Raman and fluorescence chromophores. The shorter analogue 6 employs 9,10&#8208;anthracene as the linker and demonstrates the importance of an adequate linker length with a certain level of flexibility by exhibiting generally lower binding affinities than 3&#8211;5. Pronounced aggregation&#8211;deaggregation processes are observed in fluorimetric titration experiments with DNA for compounds 3 and 5. Molecular modelling of complexes of 5 with AT&#8208;DNA, suggest the minor groove as the dominant binding site for monomeric 5, but demonstrate that dimers of 5 can also be accommodated. Strong SERS responses for 3&#8211;5 versus a very weak response for 6, particularly the strong signals from anthracene itself observed for 5 but not for 6, demonstrate the importance of triple bonds for strong Raman activity in molecules of this compound class. The energy of the characteristic stretching vibration of the C&#8801;C bonds is significantly dependent on the aromatic moiety between the triple bonds. The insertion of aromatic moieties between two C&#8801;C bonds thus offers an alternative design for dual Raman and fluorescence chromophores, applicable in multiplex biological Raman imaging.

Get the glow: Photoswitchable fluorescent supramolecular metallacycles with high fatigue&#8208;resistance are constructed by coordination&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly by using bithienylethene with dipyridyl units as a coordination donor and a fluorescent di&#8208;platinum(II) as a coordination acceptor via efficient F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer.







Abstract
In this study, photoswitchable fluorescent supramolecular metallacycles with high fatigue&#8208;resistance have been constructed by coordination&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly by using bithienylethene with dipyridyl units (BTE) as a coordination donor and a fluorescent di&#8208;platinum(II) (Pt&#8208;F) as a coordination acceptor. The photo&#8208;triggered reversible transformation between the ring&#8208;open and ring&#8208;closed form of the metallacycles was confirmed by 1H&#8197;NMR, 31P&#8197;NMR, and UV/Vis spectroscopy. This unique property enabled a reversible noninvasive &#8220;off&#8211;on&#8221; switching of fluorescence through efficient F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET). Importantly, the metallacycles remained structurally intact after up to 10 photoswitching cycles. The photoresponsive property and exceptional photostability of the metallacycles posit their potential promising application in optical switching, image storage, and super&#8208;resolution microscopy.

         <title>An Electron&#8208;Accepting aza&#8208;BODIPY&#8208;Based Donor&#8211;Acceptor&#8211;Donor Architecture for Bright NIR Emission</title>

Shine, little molecule, shine: A molecule that is bright near&#8208;infrared (NIR) fluorescent owing to a highly emissive hybridized locally excited and charge&#8208;transfer state was developed based on a donor&#8211;acceptor&#8211;donor (D&#8211;A&#8211;D) structure comprising a pyrrolopyrrole aza&#8208;BODIPY analog (PPAB) as an acceptor. Its high external quantum efficiency of 3.7&#8201;% in electroluminescence studies and low amplified spontaneous emission threshold of circa 80&#8197;&#956;J&#8201;cm&#8722;2 indicate the high potential for NIR optoelectronic applications.







Abstract
A bright near&#8208;infrared (NIR) fluorescent molecule was developed based on the donor&#8211;acceptor&#8211;donor (D&#8211;A&#8211;D) approach using an aza&#8208;BODIPY analog called pyrrolopyrrole aza&#8208;BODIPY (PPAB) as an electron&#8208;accepting chromophore. Directly introducing electron&#8208;donating triphenylamine (TPA) to develop a D&#8211;A&#8211;D structure caused redshifts of absorption and emission of PPAB into the NIR region with an enhanced fluorescence brightness of up to 5.2&#215;104&#8197;m&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;1, whereas inserting a phenylene linker between the TPA donor and the PPAB acceptor induced solvatochromic behavior in emission. Transient absorption spectra and theoretical calculations revealed the presence of a highly emissive hybridized locally excited and charge&#8208;transfer state in the former case and the contribution of the dark charge&#8208;separated state to the excited state in the latter case. The bright D&#8211;A&#8211;D PPAB as a novel emitter resulted in a NIR electroluminescence with a high external quantum efficiency of 3.7&#8201;% and a low amplified spontaneous emission threshold of ca. 80&#8197;&#956;J&#8201;cm&#8722;2, indicating the high potential for NIR optoelectronic applications.

         <title>Twisting versus Delocalization in CAAC&#8208; and NHC&#8208;Stabilized Boron&#8208;Based Biradicals: The Roles of Sterics and Electronics</title>

Twist or not: A thorough computational investigation of the origin of the distinct electrostructural properties of twisted boron&#8208;based biradicals featuring unsaturated C2R2 (R=Et, Me) bridges is presented. Steric effects are mostly responsible for the preference of twisted over planar structures, while the ground state multiplicity of the twisted structure is modulated by the &#963; framework of the bridge, with different R groups leading to distinct multiplicities.







Abstract
Twisted boron&#8208;based biradicals featuring unsaturated C2R2 (R=Et, Me) bridges and stabilization by cyclic (alkyl)(amino)carbenes (CAACs) were recently prepared. These species show remarkable geometrical and electronic differences with respect to their unbridged counterparts. Herein, a thorough computational investigation on the origin of their distinct electrostructural properties is performed. It is shown that steric effects are mostly responsible for the preference for twisted over planar structures. The ground&#8208;state multiplicity of the twisted structure is modulated by the &#963; framework of the bridge, and different R groups lead to distinct multiplicities. In line with the experimental data, a planar structure driven by delocalization effects is observed as global minimum for R=H. The synthetic elusiveness of C2R2&#8208;bridged systems featuring N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) was also investigated. These results could contribute to the engineering of novel main group biradicals.

         <title>Structurally Modelling the 2&#8208;His&#8208;1&#8208;Carboxylate Facial Triad with a Bulky N,N,O Phenolate Ligand</title>

How N,N,O can you go? A new bulky, tripodal N,N,O phenolate ligand provides access to well&#8208;defined mononuclear, monoligated non&#8208;heme iron and zinc complexes that accurately model the 2&#8208;His&#8208;1&#8208;carboxylate facial triad. These complexes are ideal synthons from which to create a range of biomimetic N,N,O&#8208;bound complexes featuring biorelevant cofactors.







Abstract
We present the synthesis and coordination chemistry of a bulky, tripodal N,N,O ligand, ImPh2NNOtBu (L), designed to model the 2&#8208;His&#8208;1&#8208;carboxylate facial triad (2H1C) by means of two imidazole groups and an anionic 2,4&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;subtituted phenolate. Reacting K&#8208;L with MCl2 (M = Fe, Zn) affords the isostructural, tetrahedral non&#8208;heme complexes [Fe(L)(Cl)] (1) and [Zn(L)(Cl)] (2) in high yield. The tridentate N,N,O ligand coordination observed in their X&#8208;ray crystal structures remains intact and well&#8208;defined in MeCN and CH2Cl2 solution. Reacting 2 with NaSPh affords a tetrahedral zinc thiolate complex, [Zn(L)(SPh)] (4), that is relevant to isopenicillin N synthase (IPNS) biomimicry. Cyclic voltammetry studies demonstrate the ligand's redox non&#8208;innocence, where phenolate oxidation is the first electrochemical response observed in K&#8208;L, 2 and 4. However, the first electrochemical oxidation in 1 is iron&#8208;centred, the assignment of which is supported by DFT calculations. Overall, ImPh2NNOtBu provides access to well&#8208;defined mononuclear, monoligated, N,N,O&#8208;bound metal complexes, enabling more accurate structural modelling of the 2H1C to be achieved.

         <title>Synthesis, Structure and Photophysical Properties of a New Class of Inherently Chiral Boron(III) Chelates&#8212;The tert&#8208;Leucine Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 16, Page 5246-5258, March 17, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chiral boron(III) chelates form under mild conditions from tert&#8208;leucine derivatives without needing resolution of diastereoisomers. These weakly fluorescent complexes possess two chiral centres, namely the B(III) atom and the C atom imported with the leucine fragment, and full stereochemical assignment is made by CD spectroscopy. X&#8208;ray structures show a distorted geometry at the B(III) site, with the crystal exhibiting amplified emission.







Abstract
A new family of boron(III) chelates is introduced whereby molecular chirality, confirmed by circular dichroism, is imported during synthesis such that isolation of the diastereoisomers does not require separation procedures. The photophysical properties of two members of the family have been examined: the N,O,O&#8208;salicylaldehyde&#8208;based derivative shows pronounced intramolecular charge&#8208;transfer character in fluid solution and is weakly fluorescent, with a large Stokes shift. The corresponding 2&#8208;methylamino&#8208;benzaldehyde&#8208;derived N,N,O&#8208;chelate absorbs and fluoresces in the visible region with a much smaller Stokes shift. Orange fluorescence is also observed for this compound as a cast film. Temperature&#8208;dependence studies show that decay of the fluorescent state is weakly activated but emission is less than quantitative at 77&#8197;K. Quite rare for boron(III)&#8208;based chelates, this derivative undergoes intersystem crossing to form a meta&#8208;stable triplet&#8208;excited state. X&#8208;ray crystal structures are reported for both compounds, along with simulated ECD spectra.

Mimicking schemes: Inspired by the interesting Z&#8208;scheme process, herein a photocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction employing chlorophyll derivatives, Chl&#8208;1 and Chl&#8208;2, on the surface of Ti3C2Tx MXene with two&#8208;dimensional accordion&#8208;like morphology, forming the Chl&#8208;1@Chl&#8208;2@Ti3C2Tx composite, is demonstrated.







Abstract
The Z&#8208;scheme process is a photoinduced electron&#8208;transfer pathway in natural oxygenic photosynthesis involving electron transport from photosystem&#8197;II (PSII) to photosystem&#8197;I (PSI). Inspired by the interesting Z&#8208;scheme process, herein a photocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) employing chlorophyll (Chl) derivatives, Chl&#8208;1 and Chl&#8208;2, on the surface of Ti3C2Tx MXene with two&#8208;dimensional accordion&#8208;like morphology, forming Chl&#8208;1@Chl&#8208;2@Ti3C2Tx composite, is demonstrated. Due to the frontier molecular orbital energy alignments of Chl&#8208;1 and Chl&#8208;2, sublayer Chl&#8208;1 is a simulation of PSI, whereas upper layer Chl&#8208;2 is equivalent to PSII, and the resultant electron transport can take place from Chl&#8208;2 to Chl&#8208;1. Under the illumination of visible light (&gt;420&#8197;nm), the HER performance of Chl&#8208;1@Chl&#8208;2@Ti3C2Tx photocatalyst was found to be as high as 143&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;gcat&#8722;1, which was substantially higher than that of photocatalysts of either Chl&#8208;1@Ti3C2Tx (20&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;g&#8722;1) or Chl&#8208;2@Ti3C2Tx (15&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;g&#8722;1).

         <title>Total Synthesis of Tiacumicin&#8197;B: Study of the Challenging &#946;&#8208;Selective Glycosylations**

Selective synthe&#8208;cis: The total synthesis of tiacumicin&#8197;B has been achieved. Through the combined use of a phenylsulfoxide leaving&#8208;group and a remote 3&#8208;O&#8208;picoloyl group on the donors, we have solved the problem of 1,2&#8208;cis glycosylation and reached remarkable facial &#946;&#8208;selectivity relying on an H&#8208;bond&#8208;directed effect.







Abstract
We give a full account of the total synthesis of tiacumicin&#8197;B (Tcn&#8208;B), a natural glycosylated macrolide with remarkable antibiotic properties. Our strategy is based on our experience with the synthesis of the tiacumicin&#8197;B aglycone and on unique 1,2&#8208;cis&#8208;glycosylation steps. We used sulfoxide anomeric leaving&#8208;groups in combination with a remote 3&#8208;O&#8208;picoloyl group on the donors that allowed highly &#946;&#8208;selective rhamnosylation and noviosylation that rely on H&#8208;bond&#8208;mediated aglycone delivery. The rhamnosylated C1&#8211;C3 fragment was anchored to the C4&#8211;C19 aglycone fragment by a Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling. Ring&#8208;size&#8208;selective Shiina macrolactonization provided a semiglycosylated aglycone that was engaged directly in the noviolysation step with a virtually total &#946;&#8208;selectivity. Finally, a novel deprotection method was devised for the removal of a 2&#8208;naphthylmethyl ether on a phenol, and efficient removal of all the protecting groups provided synthetic tiacumicin&#8197;B.

Coming together: The cooperative action of an IrIII complex photosensitizer, a thiourea, and an azo compound enables the visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced formal [4+2] cycloaddition of acyclic &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated amides and imides with N,N&#8208;dialkylanilines to synthesize structurally diverse 1,2,3,4&#8208;tetrahydroquinolines possessing contiguous stereogenic centers in a highly diastereoselective manner. The chemoselective removal of the auxiliary can be achieved.







Abstract
1,2,3,4&#8208;Tetrahydroquinolines should be applicable to the development of new pharmaceutical agents. A facile synthesis of 1,2,3,4&#8208;tetrahydroquinolines that is achieved by a photoinduced formal [4+2] cycloaddition reaction of acyclic &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated amides and imides with N,N&#8208;dialkylanilines under visible&#8208;light irradiation, in which a new IrIII complex photosensitizer, a thiourea, and an oxidant act cooperatively in promoting the reaction, is reported. The photoreaction enables the synthesis of a wide variety of 1,2,3,4&#8208;tetrahydroquinolines, while controlling the trans/cis diastereoselectivity (&gt;99:1) and constructing contiguous stereogenic centers. A chemoselective cleavage of an acyclic imide auxiliary is demonstrated.

&lt;p&gt;1,2,3,4&#8208;Tetrahydroquinolines should be applicable to the development of new pharmaceutical agents. A facile synthesis of 1,2,3,4&#8208;tetrahydroquinolines that is achieved by a photoinduced formal [4+2] cycloaddition reaction of acyclic &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated amides and imides with &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;dialkylanilines under visible&#8208;light irradiation, in which a new Ir&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt; complex photosensitizer, a thiourea, and an oxidant act cooperatively in promoting the reaction, is reported. The photoreaction enables the synthesis of a wide variety of 1,2,3,4&#8208;tetrahydroquinolines, while controlling the &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt; diastereoselectivity (&amp;gt;99:1) and constructing contiguous stereogenic centers. A chemoselective cleavage of an acyclic imide auxiliary is demonstrated.&lt;/p&gt;

Great selection! We present herein a de novo and divergent synthesis of 2&#945;&#8208; and 5&#945;&#8208;substituted furans from 2&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;1,4&#8208;diones and a variety of nucleophiles with good regio&#8208; and chemoselectivity, as well as a very broad substrate scope (&gt;10 types of nucleophiles for the 5&#945; functionalization and &gt;20 types of nucleophiles for the 2&#945; functionalization; see scheme). The products show good potential as antifungal agents.







Abstract
Herein, a divergent synthesis of a variety of 2&#945;&#8208; and 5&#945;&#8208;substituted furan derivatives from 2&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;1,4&#8208;diones is reported. By using appropriate substrates and an acid catalyst, the reactions occurred selectively through cyclization/1,6&#8208;conjugate addition or cyclization/Friedel&#8211;Crafts&#8208;type cascade reactions. A broad range of nucleophilic reagents (&gt;10 types for the 1,6&#8208;conjugate addition for 5&#945; substitution and &gt;20 types for the Friedel&#8211;Crafts&#8208;type cascade reaction for 2&#945; substitution), including alcohols, amides, furan, thiophene, pyrrole, indole, phenols, and many others, can successfully participate in the reactions, providing a universal strategy for a diversity&#8208;oriented synthesis of &#945;&#8208;substituted furan derivatives. Deuteriation experiments and DFT calculations were carried out to support the proposed reaction mechanisms. Antifungal activity experiments revealed that products with an indole or 4&#8208;hydroxycoumarin core substituted at the 2&#945; position showed moderate activities against Rhizoctorzia solani and Botrytis cinerea, respectively.

         <title>Ox&#8208;SLIM: Synthesis of and Site&#8208;Specific Labelling with a Highly Hydrophilic Trityl Spin Label</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 16, Page 5292-5297, March 17, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hydroxylated trityl spin label for proteins, called OxSLIM was synthesized. Given its high hydrophilicity, outstanding bioresistance, and short linkage, it combines the most recent advances in just a single molecule. Moreover, its improved relaxation behaviour allows for highly sensitive electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR)&#8208;based distance measurements down to concentrations as low as 45&#8197;nm.







Abstract
The combination of pulsed dipolar electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy (PDS) with site&#8208;directed spin labelling is a powerful tool in structural biology. Rational design of trityl&#8208;based spin labels has enabled studying biomolecular structures at room temperature and within cells. However, most current trityl spin labels suffer either from aggregation with proteins due to their hydrophobicity, or from bioconjugation groups not suitable for in&#8208;cell measurements. Therefore, we introduce here the highly hydrophilic trityl spin label Ox&#8208;SLIM. Engineered as a short&#8208;linked maleimide, it combines the most recent developments in one single molecule, as it does not aggregate with proteins, exhibits high resistance under in&#8208;cell conditions, provides a short linker, and allows for selective and efficient spin labelling via cysteines. Beyond establishing synthetic access to Ox&#8208;SLIM, its suitability as a spin label is illustrated and ultimately, highly sensitive PDS measurements are presented down to protein concentrations as low as 45&#8197;nm resolving interspin distances of up to 5.5&#8197;nm.

Pretty polly: Stable latexes of size&#8208;controlled spherical and unimolecular polymers, made of a cross&#8208;linked and phosphine&#8208;functionalized hydrophobic core and a poly(N&#8208;methyl&#8208;4&#8208;vinylpyridinium) shell, are efficient nanoreactors for rhodium&#8208;catalyzed hydrogenation under aqueous biphasic conditions with excellent recyclability and negligible levels of leaching.







Abstract
Unimolecular amphiphilic nanoreactors with a poly(4&#8208;vinyl&#8208;N&#8208;methylpyridinium iodide) (P4VPMe+I&#8722;) polycationic outer shell and two different architectures (core&#8208;cross&#8208;linked micelles, CCM, and nanogels, NG), with narrow size distributions around 130&#8211;150&#8197;nm in diameter, were synthesized by RAFT polymerization from an R0&#8208;4VPMe+I&#8722;140&#8208;b&#8208;S50&#8208;SC(S)SPr macroRAFT agent by either chain extension with a long (300 monomer units) hydrophobic polystyrene&#8208;based block followed by cross&#8208;linking with diethylene glycol dimethacrylate (DEGDMA) for the CCM particles, or by simultaneous chain extension and cross&#8208;linking for the NG particles. A core&#8208;anchored triphenylphosphine (TPP) ligand functionality was introduced by using 4&#8208;diphenylphosphinostyrene (DPPS) as a comonomer (5&#8211;20&#8201;%&#8201;mol&#8201;mol&#8722;1) in the chain extension (for CCM) or chain extension/cross&#8208;linking (for NG) step. The products were directly obtained as stable colloidal dispersions in water (latexes). After loading with [RhCl(COD)]2 to yield [RhCl(COD)(TPP@CCM)] or [RhCl(COD)(TPP@NG)], respectively, the polymers were used as polymeric nanoreactors in Rh&#8208;catalyzed aqueous biphasic hydrogenation of the model substrates styrene and 1&#8208;octene, either neat (for styrene) or in an organic solvent (toluene or 1&#8208;nonanol). All hydrogenations were rapid (TOF up to 300&#8197;h&#8722;1) at 25&#8201;&#176;C and 20&#8197;bar of H2 pressure, the biphasic mixture rapidly decanted at the end of the reaction (&lt;2&#8197;min), the Rh loss was negligible (&lt;0.1&#8197;ppm in the recovered organic phase), and the catalyst phase could be recycled 10 times without significant loss of catalytic activity.

         <title>Divergent Carbocatalytic Routes in Oxidative Coupling of Benzofused Heteroaryl Dimers: A Mechanistic Update</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 16, Page 5283-5291, March 17, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Oxidative coupling of benzofused heteroaryl dimers proceeded via divergent mechanistic routes depending on the used substrate and carbocatalyst. DFT level calculations using molecular quinones to compare the thermodynamics between radical and arenium cationic pathways rationalized the experimental behaviour of 2&#8208;(benzofuran&#8208;2&#8208;yl)&#8208;1H&#8208;indole: HNO3 oxidized active carbon (AC) catalyst yielded carbazole derivative while air oxidized AC yielded COTs.







Abstract
Mildly thermal air or HNO3 oxidized activated carbons catalyse oxidative dehydrogenative couplings of benzo[b]fused heteroaryl 2,2&#8217;&#8208;dimers, e.g., 2&#8208;(benzofuran&#8208;2&#8208;yl)&#8208;1H&#8208;indole, to chiral 3,3&#8217;&#8208;coupled cyclooctatetraenes or carbazole&#8208;type migrative products under O2 atmosphere. DFT calculations show that the radical cation and the Scholl&#8208;type arenium cation mechanisms lead to different products with 2&#8208;(benzofuran&#8208;2&#8208;yl)&#8208;1H&#8208;indole, being in accord with experimental product distributions.

     alt="Divergent Carbocatalytic Routes in Oxidative Coupling of Benzofused Heteroaryl Dimers: A Mechanistic Update"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Oxidative coupling&lt;/b&gt; of benzofused heteroaryl dimers proceeded via divergent mechanistic routes depending on the used substrate and carbocatalyst. DFT level calculations using molecular quinones to compare the thermodynamics between radical and arenium cationic pathways rationalized the experimental behaviour of 2&#8208;(benzofuran&#8208;2&#8208;yl)&#8208;1&lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;indole: HNO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; oxidized active carbon (AC) catalyst yielded carbazole derivative while air oxidized AC yielded COTs.

&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Interaction of Hydrogen with Ceria: Hydroxylation, Reduction, and Hydride Formation on the Surface and in the Bulk</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 16, Page 5268-5276, March 17, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A first attempt to establish the interplay between surface and bulk in hydride formation in ceria (CeO2) has been carried out by combining experiment, using surface sensitive and bulk sensitive spectroscopic techniques on the two sample systems, i.e., CeO2(111) thin films and CeO2 powders, and theoretical calculations of CeO2(111) surfaces with oxygen vacancies (Ov) at the surface and in the bulk.







Abstract
The study reports the first attempt to address the interplay between surface and bulk in hydride formation in ceria (CeO2) by combining experiment, using surface sensitive and bulk sensitive spectroscopic techniques on the two sample systems, i.e., CeO2(111) thin films and CeO2 powders, and theoretical calculations of CeO2(111) surfaces with oxygen vacancies (Ov) at the surface and in the bulk. We show that, on a stoichiometric CeO2(111) surface, H2 dissociates and forms surface hydroxyls (OH). On the pre&#8208;reduced CeO2&#8722;x samples, both films and powders, hydroxyls and hydrides (Ce&#8722;H) are formed on the surface as well as in the bulk, accompanied by the Ce3+ &#8596; Ce4+ redox reaction. As the Ov concentration increases, hydroxyl is destabilized and hydride becomes more stable. Surface hydroxyl is more stable than bulk hydroxyl, whereas bulk hydride is more stable than surface hydride. The surface hydride formation is the kinetically favorable process at relatively low temperatures, and the resulting surface hydride may diffuse into the bulk region and be stabilized therein. At higher temperatures, surface hydroxyls can react to produce water and create additional oxygen vacancies, increasing its concentration, which controls the H2/CeO2 interaction. The results demonstrate a large diversity of reaction pathways, which have to be taken into account for better understanding of reactivity of ceria&#8208;based catalysts in a hydrogen&#8208;rich atmosphere.

Plugged in: Efficient reactions that enable the assembly of molecules into complex structures have driven extensive progress in synthetic chemistry, particularly those that occur under mild conditions and in benign solvents while producing no by&#8208;products and that rapidly reach completion. Amongst these, the strain&#8208;promoted azide&#8211;alkyne cycloaddition, involving various cyclooctyne derivatives reacting with azide&#8208;bearing molecules, has gained extensive popularity in organic synthesis and bioorthogonal chemistry. This reaction has also gained momentum in polymer chemistry, where it has been used to decorate, link, crosslink, and even prepare polymer chains.

         <title>Frontispiece: Enhancing Magnetic Communication between Metal Centres: The&#8201;Role of s&#8208;Tetrazine Based Radicals as Ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 16, March 17, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
s&#8208;Tetrazine is a six&#8208;membered aromatic nitrogen&#8208;rich compound that can be easily reduced to form a radical anion with highly delocalized electron density. Additionally, it offers limitless possibilities for creating novel materials owing to the possible derivatization at 3&#8208; and 6&#8208;positions and its highly tunable nature. In recent years, this versatility has led to the emergence of a wide variety of materials based on s&#8208;tetrazines, ranging from energetic materials to magnetic/conducting systems. While examples of radical bridged coordination compounds with specific tetrazines have begun to emerge, there are still a large number of tetrazinyl derivatives that remain unexplored. With the increased research interest and efforts placed on developing tetrazine&#8208;based materials, the pathway is now open for innovative exploration where magnetic communication through s&#8208;tetrazine plays a pivotal role. In their Minireview on page 5091, M. Murugesu et&#8197;al. highlight the incorporation of tetrazines as tunable ligands in the development of novel high&#8208;performing molecule&#8208;based magnets.

         <dc:description>
Developing low&#8208;cost and highly active electrocatalysts to replace Pt group metals is very critical to the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Transition&#8208;metal carbides (TMCs) have drawn broad attention as potential HER catalysts in recent years due to the platinum&#8208;like electron structure. This review highlights recent strides on synthesis routes and optimization strategies of TMC electrocatalysts, and discusses future perspectives in the development of TMC electrocatalysts. For more information see the review article by Jian Li, Yu Wang et al. on page 5074.

         <title>Frontispiece: Bis(phenylethynyl)arene Linkers in Tetracationic Bis&#8208;triarylborane Chromophores Control Fluorimetric and Raman Sensing of Various DNAs and RNAs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 16, March 17, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fluorimetric titration, thermal denaturation and circular dichroism experiments have shown four luminescent tetracationic bis&#8208;triarylboranes to be efficient DNA and RNA sensors. Using bis(phenylethynyl)arenes as linkers results in dual Raman and fluorescence chromophores with high fluorescent quantum yields in aqueous media and strong SERS responses. Comparison with an appropriate analogue confirms the importance of triple bonds for strong Raman activity in such compounds. For more details, see the Full Paper by S. Tomi&#263;, I. Piantanida, T.&#8197;B. Marder et al. on page 5142.

         <title>Frontispiece: Potential Applications of Cucurbit[n]urils and Their Derivatives in the Capture of Hazardous Chemicals</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 16, March 17, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cucurtbit[n]urils can not only encapsulate guest molecules or coordinate with metal cations, but also interact with electronegative species, owing to the hydrophobic cavity, carbonyl portals and electropositive outer surfaces. Therefore, solid&#8208;state materials based on cucurtbit[n]urils and their derivatives have the capability to extract specific hazardous molecules, inorganic cations and anions from gas or solution mixtures. For more details see the Minireview by W.&#8208;Y. Sun et&#8197;al. on page 5107.

Inspired by Greek mythology, Orion is shown in the cover image as a lion&#8208;hearted hunter; he hits acyclic &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated imides and N,N&#8242;&#8208;dialkylanilines with the club to give 1,2,3,4&#8208;tetrahydroquinolines (1,2,3,4&#8208;THQs; the lion fur in the cover image). There are three stars in Orion&#8242;s Belt; i.e., &#1013; Ori, &#950; Ori, and &#948; Ori, which enhance his toughness. The trio applied to the novel iridium(III) complex photo&#8208;sensitizer, the thiourea, and the azo compound, works cooperatively and powerfully to achieve the photochemical synthesis of structurally diverse 1,2,3,4&#8208;THQs with excellent diastereoselectivity. More information can be found in the Full Paper by K. Itoh, H. Fujii, et&#8197;al. on page 5171.

(Thio)ureas have found numerous applications as organocatalysts, yet their mode of action, that is, the mechanism by which they accelerate reactions is still not fully understood. In this work, quantum chemical activation strain analyses reveal that these bifunctional hydrogen bond organocatalysts accelerate the Diels&#8211;Alder reaction between cyclopentadiene and acrolein by reducing the two&#8208;center four&#8208;electron (steric) Pauli repulsion between the occupied &#960;&#8208;orbitals of the reactants and not by enhancing the donor&#8211;acceptor orbital interactions, as is traditionally considered. More information can be found in the Full Paper by P. Vermeeren, T.&#8197;A. Hamlin, F.&#8197;M. Bickelhaupt, and I. Fern&#225;ndez on page 5180.

Boron chemistry offers many systems in which slight variations lead to drastic geometrical and electronic perturbations. This article explains the reasons for variations observed in a system consisting of two boron centers stabilized by CAAC or NHC donors and connected by C2R2 (R=Et, Me, H) bridges. For CAAC and R=Me, Et the bridge is twisted, and the molecule is a biradical. For CAAC and R=H the bridge is not twisted, leading to a closed&#8208;shell structure. For NHC&#8208;stabilized systems we predict closed&#8208;shell molecules with partially twisted bridges. This is attributed to a delicate interplay of steric and electronic effects. More information can be found in the Full Paper by B. Engels et&#8197;al. on page 5160.

         <title>Enhancing Magnetic Communication between Metal Centres: The&#8201;Role of s&#8208;Tetrazine Based Radicals as Ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 16, Page 5091-5106, March 17, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Emerging s&#8208;tetrazine&#8208;based materials demonstrate the vast applicability of these highly versatile systems. This contribution highlights their incorporation as tunable ligands in the development of molecule&#8208;based magnets, where communication between paramagnetic centres is critical, thus opening new avenues in the design of high performing Single&#8208;Molecule Magnets.







Abstract
Although 1,2,4,5&#8208;tetrazines or s&#8208;tetrazines have been known in the literature for more than a century, their coordination chemistry has become increasingly popular in recent years due to their unique redox activity, multiple binding sites and their various applications. The electron&#8208;poor character of the ring and stabilization of the radical anion through all four nitrogen atoms in their metal complexes provide new aspects in molecular magnetism towards the synthesis of new high performing Single Molecule Magnets (SMMs). The scope of this review is to examine the role of s&#8208;tetrazine radical ligands in transition metal and lanthanide based SMMs and provide a critical overview of the progress thus far in this field. As well, general synthetic routes and new insights for the preparation of s&#8208;tetrazines are discussed, along with their redox activity and applications in various fields. Concluding remarks along with the limitations and perspectives of these ligands are discussed.

Click here: This review highlights recent examples of the use of strain&#8208;promoted azide&#8211;alkyne cycloaddition (SPAAC) chemistry in the preparation, decoration, and assembly of macromolecular structures. This highly efficient reaction has found numerous applications in polymer chemistry, allowing the preparation of various polymer architectures and the modification of end&#8208;groups, side&#8208;chains, and backbones of polymers.







Abstract
Highly efficient reactions that enable the assembly of molecules into complex structures have driven extensive progress in synthetic chemistry. In particular, reactions that occur under mild conditions and in benign solvents, while producing no by&#8208;products and rapidly reach completion are attracting significant attention. Amongst these, the strain&#8208;promoted azide&#8211;alkyne cycloaddition, involving various cyclooctyne derivatives reacting with azide&#8208;bearing molecules, has gained extensive popularity in organic synthesis and bioorthogonal chemistry. This reaction has also recently gained momentum in polymer chemistry, where it has been used to decorate, link, crosslink, and even prepare polymer chains. This survey highlights key achievements in the use of this reaction to produce a variety of polymeric constructs for disparate applications.

Carbides in catalysis: Electrochemical water splitting provides a promising strategy for effective and sustainable hydrogen production through renewable electricity, and one of the immediate challenges is the availability of low&#8208;cost and efficient electrocatalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Transition&#8208;metal carbides (TMCs) show catalytic properties resembling the platinum group noble metals, attracting intensive attention for prospective industrial electrochemical water splitting. This review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the latest advances in the preparation and modification of TMC electrocatalysts toward high&#8208;performance HER.







Abstract
With the strengths of zero carbon emission and high gravimetric energy density, hydrogen energy is recognized as a primary choice for future energy supply. Electrochemical water splitting provides a promising strategy for effective and sustainable hydrogen production through renewable electricity, and one of the immediate challenges toward its large&#8208;scale application is the availability of low&#8208;cost and efficient electrocatalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Given the enormous efforts in the exploration of potential transition&#8208;metal carbide (TMC) electrocatalysts, this review aims to summarize the recent advances in synthetic methods and optimization strategies of TMC electrocatalysts. Additionally, the perspectives for the development of novel efficient TMC&#8208;based catalysts are also proposed.

         <title>Potential Applications of Cucurbit[n]urils and Their Derivatives in the Capture of Hazardous Chemicals</title>

Be their guest! Cucurbit[n]urils (Q[n]s), consisting of glycoluril units bridged by methylene groups, have a rigid hydrophobic inner cavity and two polar outer portals lined with carbonyl groups, so Q[n]s not only encapsulate guest species into the cavity, but also coordinate with metal ions/clusters. This Minireview focuses on the recent advances in the potential application of Q[n]s and their derivatives for the capture and adsorption of hazardous chemicals.







Abstract
Cucurbit[n]urils (Q[n]s) are a relatively young family of macrocycles, consisting of glycoluril units bridged by methylene groups, and their unique structures have attracted extensive attention from chemists in recent decades. Due to the presence of a rigid hydrophobic inner cavity and two polar outer portals lined with carbonyl groups, Q[n]s not only encapsulate guest species into the cavity, but also coordinate with metal ions/clusters. Considerable achievements have been obtained in the fields of Q[n]s&#8208;based host&#8211;guest chemistry, coordination chemistry, as well as the combination of host&#8211;guest and coordination chemistry. Furthermore, the outer surface of Q[n]s has been demonstrated to be capable of interacting with definite species to generate supramolecular architectures in recent years. With more in&#8208;depth research into Q[n]s, their application studies have also emerged as a hot topic. This Minireview focuses on recent advances in the potential applications of solid&#8208;state materials based on Q[n]s and their derivatives for the capture and adsorption of hazardous chemicals from a solution or a gas mixture.

         <title>Tenfold Metalation of Ferrocene: Synthesis, Structures, and Metallophilic Interactions in FeC10(HgX)10</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 16, Page 5125-5129, March 17, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
That's so metal: All ten C&#8722;H bonds of ferrocene can be metalated in a simple one&#8208;pot reaction by using mercury butyrate to give permercurated ferrocene, an air&#8208; and water stable compound. The completeness of metalation is confirmed by NMR and vibrational spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, as well as elemental analysis.







Abstract
The permercuration of ferrocene was achieved by reacting ferrocene with 10&#8197;equivalents of mercury(II) butyrate Hg(O2CC3H7)2 in a facile one&#8208;pot reaction in multi&#8208;gram scale and high yields. The butyrate groups in FeC10(HgX)10 (X=O2CC3H7) can be exchanged by treatment with trifluoro&#8208; or trichloroacetic acid (X=O2CCF3, O2CCCl3). Substitution of the trifluoroacetate groups by halides (X=Cl, F) proceeds easily in aqueous THF. The completeness of metalation was confirmed by NMR and vibrational spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, as well as elemental analysis. Additionally, the first crystal structures of permetallated metallocenes are presented: FeC10(HgX)10 (X=Cl, O2CCF3, O2CCCl3).

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The permercuration of ferrocene was achieved by reacting ferrocene with 10&#8197;equivalents of mercury(II) butyrate Hg(O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CC&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in a facile one&#8208;pot reaction in multi&#8208;gram scale and high yields. The butyrate groups in FeC&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;(HgX)&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; (X=O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CC&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;) can be exchanged by treatment with trifluoro&#8208; or trichloroacetic acid (X=O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CCF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CCCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;). Substitution of the trifluoroacetate groups by halides (X=Cl, F) proceeds easily in aqueous THF. The completeness of metalation was confirmed by NMR and vibrational spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, as well as elemental analysis. Additionally, the first crystal structures of permetallated metallocenes are presented: FeC&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;(HgX)&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; (X=Cl, O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CCF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CCCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Direct Asymmetric &#945;&#8208;Selective Mannich Reaction of &#946;,&#947;&#8208;Unsaturated Ketones with Cyclic &#945;&#8208;Imino Ester: Divergent Synthesis of Cyclocanaline and Tetrahydro Pyridazinone Derivatives</title>

         <dc:description>
Two roads diverged: Direct asymmetric &#945;&#8208;selective Mannich reaction of &#946;,&#947;&#8208;unsaturated ketones with cyclic &#945;&#8208;imino ester is realized by a dinuclear zinc catalyst giving Mannich adducts with high enantioselectivity. These products could be used as common intermediates in the synthesis of multisubstituted cyclocanalines, tetrahydro pyridazinones, and 4H&#8208;furo[2,3&#8208;b][1,4]benzoxazine derivatives.







Abstract
The first regio&#8208;, diastereo&#8208;, and enantioselective direct Mannich reaction of &#946;,&#947;,&#8208;unsaturated ketones with benzoxazinone cyclic imines was enabled by Lewis acid/Br&#248;nsted base cooperative catalysis. The dinuclear zinc complex catalyzed the reaction of a broad range of &#946;,&#947;&#8208;unsaturated ketones to proceed at the &#945;&#8208;site exclusively, leading to corresponding adducts with two consecutive tertiary carbon stereocenters in diastereomeric ratios of up to &gt;20:1 and enantioselectivities generally in the 90&#8211;99&#8201;% ee range. These products were used as general intermediates in the synthesis of multisubstituted cyclocanalines, tetrahydro pyridazinones, and 4H&#8208;furo[2,3&#8208;b][1,4]benzoxazine derivatives.

         <title>Calix[4]pyrrolato Aluminates: The Effect of Ligand Modification on the Reactivity of Square&#8208;Planar Aluminum Anions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 16, Page 5120-5124, March 17, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
New ligand, new reactivity: Changing the alkyl&#8208;substituents in the meso&#8208;positions of the octa&#8208;alkyl calix[4]pyrrolato ligand leads to new derivatives of planar&#8208;tetracoordinated aluminum anions. The substituents modulate the preference of the aluminates to act as a Lewis acid towards &#963;&#8208;donors or toward carbonyls by element&#8208;ligand cooperativity.







Abstract
Structural constraint represents an attractive tool to modify p&#8208;block element properties without the need for unusual oxidation or valence states. The recently reported methyl&#8208;calix[4]pyrrolato aluminate established the effect of forcing a tetrahedral aluminum anion into a square&#8208;planar coordination mode. However, the generality of this structural motif and any consequence of ligand modification remained open. Herein, a systematic ligand screening was launched, and the class of square&#8208;planar aluminum anions was extended by two derivatives that differ in the meso&#8208;substitution at the calix[4]pyrrolato ligand. Strikingly, this modification provoked opposing trends in the preference for a Lewis acidic binding mode with &#963;&#8208;donors versus the aluminum&#8208;ligand cooperative binding mode with carbonyls. Insights into the origin of these counterintuitive experimental observations were provided by computation and bond analysis. Importantly, this rationale might allow to exploit mode&#8208;selective binding for catalytic rate control.

         <title>Hierarchical Spin&#8208;Crossover Cooperativity in Hybrid 1D Chains of FeII&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;Triazole Trimers Linked by [Au(CN)2]&#8722; Bridges</title>

Hierarchical cooperativity: Crucial information on the nature, magnitude, and dimensional hierarchy of elastic coupling in spin&#8208;crossover systems is achieved in a family of materials consisting of trimers linked into coordination chains and spaced by anions and exchangeable guests.







Abstract
Foremost, practical applications of spin&#8208;crossover (SCO) materials require control of the nature of the spin&#8208;state coupling. In existing SCO materials, there is a single, well&#8208;defined dimensionality relevant to the switching behavior. A new material, consisting of 1,2,4&#8208;triazole&#8208;based trimers coordinated into 1D chains by [Au(CN)2]&#8722; and spaced by anions and exchangeable guests, underwent SCO defined by elastic coupling across multiple dimensional hierarchies. Detailed structural, vibrational, and theoretical studies conclusively confirmed that intra&#8208;trimer coupling was an order of magnitude greater than the intramolecular coupling, which was an order of magnitude greater than intermolecular coupling. As such, a clear hierarchy on the nature of elastic coupling in SCO materials was ascertained for the first time, which is a necessary step for the technological development of molecular switching materials.

Two dimensional nanomaterials: An asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC, HRG//m&#8208;WO3 ASC) fabricated from tungsten oxide (m&#8208;WO3) nanoplates as a negative electrode and highly reduced graphene oxide (HRG) as a positive electrode material attains specific capacitance of 389&#8197;F&#8201;g&#8722;1 at a current density of 0.5&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1, with an associated high energy density of 93&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 at a power density of 500&#8197;W&#8201;kg&#8722;1 in a wide 1.6&#8197;V operating potential window. In addition, the HRG//m&#8208;WO3 ASC displays long&#8208;term cycling&#8208;stability, maintaining around 92&#8201;% of the original specific capacitance after 5000 galvanostatic charge&#8211;discharge cycles.







Abstract
Tungsten oxide/graphene hybrid materials are attractive semiconductors for energy&#8208;related applications. Herein, we report an asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC, HRG//m&#8208;WO3 ASC), fabricated from monoclinic tungsten oxide (m&#8208;WO3) nanoplates as a negative electrode and highly reduced graphene oxide (HRG) as a positive electrode material. The supercapacitor performance of the prepared electrodes was evaluated in an aqueous electrolyte (1&#8201;m H2SO4) using three&#8208; and two&#8208;electrode systems. The HRG//m&#8208;WO3 ASC exhibits a maximum specific capacitance of 389&#8197;F&#8201;g&#8722;1 at a current density of 0.5&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1, with an associated high energy density of 93&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 at a power density of 500&#8197;W&#8201;kg&#8722;1 in a wide 1.6&#8197;V operating potential window. In addition, the HRG//m&#8208;WO3 ASC displays long&#8208;term cycling stability, maintaining 92&#8201;% of the original specific capacitance after 5000 galvanostatic charge&#8211;discharge cycles. The m&#8208;WO3 nanoplates were prepared hydrothermally while HRG was synthesized by a modified Hummers method.

         <title>Probing Multiconfigurational States by Spectroscopy: The Cerium XAS L3&#8208;edge Puzzle</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Ce L3 X&#8208;ray absorption spectra of CeO2 and Ce(C8H8)2 are calculated with relativistic multiconfigurational wavefunction approaches. Calculated spectra are in excellent agreement with experiments. The metal oxidation state in the ground vs. the core&#8208;excited states, and the experimental 4f electron count derived spectroscopically, are fully rationalized.







Abstract
The Ce L3 edge XAS spectra of CeO2 and cerocene [Ce(C8H8)2] were calculated with relativistic ab&#8208;initio multireference wavefunction approaches capable of reproducing the observed spectra accurately. The study aims to resolve the decades&#8208;long puzzle regarding the relationship between the number and relative intensities of the XAS peaks and the 4f electron occupation in the ground state (GS) versus the core&#8208;excited states (ESs). CeO2 and cerocene exemplify the different roles of covalent bonding and wavefunction configurational composition in the observed intensity patterns. Good agreement is found between the calculated GS 4f&#8208;shell occupations and the value derived from XAS measurements using peak areas (nf). The identity of the two&#8208;peaked Ce L3 edge is fully rationalized from the perspective of the relaxed wavefunctions for the GS and core ESs. The states underlying the different peaks differ from each other in a surprisingly simple way that can be associated with 4f1 vs. 4f0 sub&#8208;configurations. Furthermore, part of one of the cerocene spectral peaks is associated with 4f2 sub&#8208;configurations. The pattern therefore reveals excited states that can be interpreted in terms of Ce&#8201;IV and III oxidation numbers, as long assumed, with Ce&#8201;II states additionally appearing in the cerocene spectrum. While this work demonstrates the rough accuracy of the conventional approach to determining nf from Ce L3&#8208;edge XAS, limitations are highlighted in terms of the ultimate accuracy of this approach and the potential of observing new types of excited states. The need to determine the sources of nf by calculations, is stressed.

         <title>Fluorinated Rings: Conformation and Application</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fluorine&#8208;containing compounds are widely used in different applications owing to their unique properties and effects. A particularly interesting feature is the impact of the C&#8722;F bond on the conformational preference when incorporated with organic molecules. In this Review, the conformational behavior of fluorinated aliphatic carbo&#8208; and heterocyclic systems will be discussed through presentation of the most recent applications.







Abstract
The introduction of fluorine atoms into molecules and materials across many fields of academic and industrial research is now commonplace, owing to their unique properties. A particularly interesting feature is the impact of fluorine substitution on the relative orientation of a C&#8722;F bond when incorporated into organic molecules. In this Review, we will be discussing the conformational behavior of fluorinated aliphatic carbo&#8208; and heterocyclic systems. The conformational preference of each system is associated with various interactions introduced by fluorine substitution such as charge&#8208;dipole, dipole&#8208;dipole, and hyperconjugative interactions. The contribution of each interaction on the stabilization of the fluorinated alicyclic system, which manifests itself in low conformations, will be discussed in detail. The novelty of this feature will be demonstrated by presenting the most recent applications.

         <title>Directed Design of a AuI Complex with a Reduced Mesoionic Carbene Radical Ligand: Insights from 1,2,3&#8208;Triazolylidene Selenium Adducts and Extensive Electrochemical Investigations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
MIC drop! The first example and the spectroscopic characterization of a metal&#8208;bound as well as selenium&#8208;bound mesoionic carbene (MIC)&#8208;radical of the 1,2,3&#8208;triazol&#8208;5&#8208;ylidene type is reported. Design principles for stabilizing such radicals are presented as well.







Abstract
Carbene&#8208;based radicals are important for both fundamental and applied chemical research. Herein, extensive electrochemical investigations of nine different 1,2,3&#8208;triazolylidene selenium adducts are reported. It is found that the half&#8208;wave potentials of the first reduction of the selones correlate with their calculated LUMO levels and the LUMO levels of the corresponding triazolylidene&#8208;based mesoionic carbenes (MICs). Furthermore, unexpected quasi&#8208;reversibility of the reduction of two triazoline selones, exhibiting comparable reduction potentials, was discovered. Through UV/Vis/NIR and EPR spectroelectrochemical investigations supported by DFT calculations, the radical anion was unambiguously assigned to be triazoline centered. This electrochemical behavior was transferred to a triazolylidene&#8208;type MIC&#8208;gold phenyl complex resulting in a MIC&#8208;radical coordinated AuI species. Apart from UV&#8208;Vis&#8208;NIR and EPR spectroelectrochemical investigations of the reduction, the reduced gold&#8208;coordinated MIC radical complex was also formed in situ in the bulk through chemical reduction. This is the first report of a monodentate triazolylidene&#8208;based MIC ligand that can be reduced to its anion radical in a metal complex. The results presented here provide design principles for stabilizing radicals based on MICs.

A novel photocatalyst is designed with consideration of heterojunction band matching and porous structure. The SrTiO3/SrSO4 heterojunction using Pt as the co&#8208;catalyst reaches 396.82&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1, which is 16&#8197;times higher than that of SrTiO3/Pt. It is proposed that the presence of SrSO4 provides extra channels for electron transportation as well as promoting photocatalytic activity.







Abstract
Efficient separation of photogenerated electron&#8211;hole pairs is a crucial factor for high&#8208;performance photocatalysts. Effective electron&#8211;hole separation and migration could be achieved by heterojunctions with suitable band structures. Herein, a porous SrTiO3/SrSO4 heterojunction is prepared by a sol&#8208;gel method at room temperature followed by an annealing process. XRD characterization suggests high crystallinity of the heterostructure. A well&#8208;defined interface between the two phases is confirmed by high&#8208;resolution (HR)TEM. The photocatalytic H2 evolution productivity of the SrTiO3/SrSO4 heterojunction with Pt as co&#8208;catalyst reaches 396.82&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1, which is 16&#8197;times higher than that of SrTiO3/Pt. The boosted photocatalytic activity of SrTiO3/SrSO4/Pt can be ascribed to the presence of SrSO4, which promotes the transfer and migration of photogenerated carriers by forming the heterojunction and porous structure, which provides a large amount of active sites. This novel porous heterostructure brings new ideas for the development of high&#8208;efficiency photocatalysts for H2 release.

         <title>Organic Nanoparticles with Persistent Luminescence for In Vivo Afterglow Imaging&#8208;Guided Photodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Afterglow organic nanoparticles (ONPs) with long lifetime and near&#8208;infrared (NIR) emission offered high signal&#8208;to&#8208;background ratio and good tissue penetration for afterglow imaging&#8208;guided photodynamic therapy (PDT) in vivo. Owing to strong afterglow luminescence and abundant singlet oxygen generation from the ONPs upon NIR laser irradiation, they have shown effective suppression of tumor growth after imaging&#8208;guided PDT in mice with minimal damage to major organs.







Abstract
Optical imaging&#8208;guided photodynamic therapy (PDT), with precise localization and non&#8208;invasive treatment of tumors, is an emerging technique with great potential for cancer therapy. However, impaired by tissue auto&#8208;fluorescence that causes low signal&#8208;to&#8208;background ratio (SBR), most fluorescence imaging systems show poor sensitivity to tumors in vivo. In this study, we synthesized organic nanoparticles (ONPs) with persistent luminescence and good biocompatibility for afterglow imaging&#8208;guided PDT. The ONPs displayed near&#8208;infrared light emission with half&#8208;life time at minute level, which offered high SBR and good tissue penetration for in vivo afterglow tumor imaging. Taking advantage of their abundant singlet oxygen generation by NIR laser irradiation guided to the tumor sites, the ONPs also enabled imaging&#8208;guided PDT for efficient suppression of tumor growth in mice with minimal damage to major organs.

         <title>Lighting up the plasma membrane: Development and applications of fluorescent ligands for transmembrane proteins.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Despite the fact that transmembrane proteins represent the main therapeutic targets for decades, complete and in&#8208;depth knowledge about their biochemical and pharmacological profiling is not fully available. In this regard, target&#8208;tailored small&#8208;molecule fluorescent ligands are a viable approach to fill in the missing pieces of the puzzle. Such tools, coupled with the ability of high&#8208;precision optical techniques to image with an unprecedented resolution at a single&#8208;molecule level, helped unraveling many of the conundrums related to plasma proteins&#8217; life&#8208;cycle and druggability. Herein, we review the recent progress made during the last two decades in fluorescent ligand design and potential applications in fluorescence microscopy of voltage&#8208;gated ion channels, ligand&#8208;gated ion channels and G&#8208;coupled protein receptors.</dc:description>

         <title>Naphthalenediimides with High Fluorescence Quantum Yield: Bright&#8208;Red, Stable, and Responsive Fluorescent Dyes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first example of a bis&#8208;NH2 core&#8208;substituted naphthalenediimide (NDI) with remarkably high 
. A simple synthetic protocol to NH2&#8208;substituted NDIs is described. Dependent on the substituents, fluorescence can be tuned from bright&#8208;green to the red/NIR region and the 
 modulated by two orders of magnitude. These fluorophores show large Stokes&#8208;shift and great responsiveness to solvent polarity.







Abstract
The naphthalenediimide (NDI) scaffold in contrast to its higher congeners possess low&#8208;fluorescence. In spite of elegant synthetic developments, a highly emissive NDI is quite rare to find, as well as, a green&#8208;light&#8208;emitting NDI is yet to be explored. Herein, we report a novel class of symmetric and asymmetric NH2&#8208;substituted core&#8208;NDIs (1&#8211;5) with tunable fluorescence in the visible region and extending to the NIR frontier. Importantly, the bis&#8208;NH2&#8208;substituted NDI 2 revealed quantum yield, 
 of &#8776;81 and &#8776;68&#8201;% in toluene and DMSO, respectively, suggesting versatility of the fluorophore in a wide range of solvent polarity. The dye 1 is shown to be the first NDI&#8208;based green&#8208;light emitter. The donor piperidine group in 5 diminish the 
 by 40&#8208;fold providing a lever to modulate the excited&#8208;state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT) process. Our synthetic protocol applies a Pd catalyst and a benign hydride source simplifying the non&#8208;trivial &#8722;NH2 group integration at the NDI&#8208;core. TD&#8208;DFT calculations predicted strong intramolecular hydrogen bonds in the excited state in the bulk nonpolar medium and responsiveness to solvent polarity. The maximization of the NDI emission outlined here would further boost the burgeoning repertoire of applications of the NDI scaffold.

         <title>Uranium versus Thorium: Synthesis and Reactivity of [&#951;5&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;(Me3C)3C5H2]2U[&#951;2&#8208;C2Ph2]</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The intrinsic reactivity of a stable uranium metallacyclopropene complex, [&#951;5&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;(Me3C)3C5H2]2U(&#951;2&#8208;C2Ph2), was evaluated and compared to that of other uranium and thorium metallacyclopropenes. Although structurally similar, the thorium and uranium metallacyclopropenes exhibit distinctively different reactivity.







Abstract
The synthesis, electronic structure, and reactivity of a uranium metallacyclopropene were comprehensively studied. Addition of diphenylacetylene (PhC&#8801;CPh) to the uranium phosphinidene metallocene [&#951;5&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;(Me3C)3C5H2]2U=P&#8208;2,4,6&#8208;tBu3C6H2 (1) yields the stable uranium metallacyclopropene, [&#951;5&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;(Me3C)3C5H2]2U[&#951;2&#8208;C2Ph2] (2). Based on density functional theory (DFT) results the 5f orbital contributions to the bonding within the metallacyclopropene U&#8208;(&#951;2&#8208;C=C) moiety increases significantly compared to the related ThIV compound [&#951;5&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;(Me3C)3C5H2]2Th[&#951;2&#8208;C2Ph2], which also results in more covalent bonds between the [&#951;5&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;(Me3C)3C5H2]2U2+ and [&#951;2&#8208;C2Ph2]2&#8722; fragments. Although the thorium and uranium complexes are structurally closely related, different reaction patterns are therefore observed. For example, 2 reacts as a masked synthon for the low&#8208;valent uranium(II) metallocene [&#951;5&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;(Me3C)3C5H2]2UII when reacted with Ph2E2 (E=S, Se), alkynes and a variety of hetero&#8208;unsaturated molecules such as imines, ketazine, bipy, nitriles, organic azides, and azo derivatives. In contrast, five&#8208;membered metallaheterocycles are accessible when 2 is treated with isothiocyanate, aldehydes, and ketones.

&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;(Me&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;U=P&#8208;2,4,6&#8208;&lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;Bu&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;) yields the stable uranium metallacyclopropene, [&lt;i&gt;&#951;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;(Me&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;U[&lt;i&gt;&#951;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#8208;C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Ph&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;] (&lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;). Based on density functional theory (DFT) results the 5f orbital contributions to the bonding within the metallacyclopropene U&#8208;(&lt;i&gt;&#951;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#8208;C=C) moiety increases significantly compared to the related Th&lt;sup&gt;IV&lt;/sup&gt; compound [&lt;i&gt;&#951;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;(Me&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Th[&lt;i&gt;&#951;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#8208;C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Ph&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;], which also results in more covalent bonds between the [&lt;i&gt;&#951;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;(Me&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;U&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and [&lt;i&gt;&#951;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#8208;C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Ph&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; fragments. Although the thorium and uranium complexes are structurally closely related, different reaction patterns are therefore observed. For example, &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt; reacts as a masked synthon for the low&#8208;valent uranium(II) metallocene [&lt;i&gt;&#951;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;(Me&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;U&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt; when reacted with Ph&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;E&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (E=S, Se), alkynes and a variety of hetero&#8208;unsaturated molecules such as imines, ketazine, bipy, nitriles, organic azides, and azo derivatives. In contrast, five&#8208;membered metallaheterocycles are accessible when &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt; is treated with isothiocyanate, aldehydes, and ketones.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Sulfur Tetrahydride and Allied Superhydride Clusters: When Resonance Takes Precedence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
H2S + H2 reactants are (computationally) found to form metastable &#8220;superhydride&#8221; SH4 that in turn forms (SH4&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H2S)n = &#8220;(SH3)2n&#8221; clusters with well&#8208;adapted (x,y,z) geometry for crystallization. Natural resonance theory (NRT) clarifies the uniqueness of the hypervalent bonding in this species.







Abstract
Sulfur offers a variety of bonding surprises compared to the parent oxygen atom of the chalcogen family. In the present work, we employ standard quantum chemistry methods to characterize formation of previously unrecognized sulfur tetrahydride (C4v&#8208;symmetric SH4) from hydrogen sulfide (H2S) and molecular hydrogen (H2) on the ground state potential energy surface. The unusual intramolecular interactions of SH4 defy Lewis&#8208;like bonding conceptions, exhibiting the dominance of resonance&#8208;type donor&#8208;acceptor delocalizations well beyond those of SF4 (C2v sawhorse geometry) and other known tetrahalides. The distressed character of SH4 bonding also leads to exotic intermolecular structural motifs in clusters of pure (SH4)n and mixed (SH4&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H2S)n composition. We evaluate structural, spectroscopic, and electronic properties for various 2D/3D coordination patterns and discuss how (SH4&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H2S)n&#8208;type building blocks may relate to recent experimental studies of superconductivity in high&#8208;pressure materials of &#8220;SH3&#8221; stoichiometry.

         <title>Tuning the Properties of MOF&#8208;808 via Defect Engineering and Metal Nanoparticle Encapsulation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Defects and metal nanoparticle encapsulations have been shown to have significant impacts on structure, texture, morphology and reactivity of the synthesized MOFs. Control over defects creation and metal nanoparticle encapsulations can become useful avenues to adjust the properties of MOFs.







Abstract
Defect engineering and metal encapsulation are considered as valuable approaches to fine&#8208;tune the reactivity of metal&#8211;organic frameworks. In this work, various MOF&#8208;808 (Zr) samples are synthesized and characterized with the final aim to understand how defects and/or platinum nanoparticle encapsulation act on the intrinsic and reactive properties of these MOFs. The reactivity of the pristine, defective and Pt encapsulated MOF&#8208;808 is quantified with water adsorption and CO2 adsorption calorimetry. The results reveal strong competitive effects between crystal morphology and missing linker defects which in turn affect the crystal morphology, porosity, stability, and reactivity. In spite of leading to a loss in porosity, the introduction of defects (missing linkers or Pt nanoparticles) is beneficial to the stability of the MOF&#8208;808 towards water and could also be advantageously used to tune adsorption properties of this MOF family.

         <title>Synthetic Approaches to Selenoesters</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Selenoesters are an important class of compounds that have wide possibilities for chemical transformations, being considered excellent building blocks for the synthesis of more complex molecules. In this review, an overview of the available methods for the synthesis of selenoesters will be presented. This overview is hoped to serve as a source of inspiration for the development of new strategies for the synthesis of this type of compound, as well as for their use as building blocks in synthesis.







Abstract
Selenoesters are compounds of great synthetic relevance since they can be used in several types of chemical transformations and mainly due to their great capacity in the formation of acyl radicals. Therefore, the scientific community has been developing several methods for the synthesis of this class of molecules. This review will address the synthesis of these compounds from different starting materials, such as carboxylic acids derivatives (acid chlorides and anhydrides), aldehydes, selenoacetylenes and miscellaneous methods.

         <title>Regioselective Synthesis of 1,2,3,4&#8208;Tetrasubstituted Arenes by Vicinal Functionalization of Arynes Derived from Aryl(Mes)iodonium Salts**
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Densely functionalized 1,2,3,4&#8208;substituted arenes are found in societally important molecules but are challenging to synthesize. This work reports on a method that uses aryl(Mes)iodonium salts as an aryne precursor via regioselective deprotonation. Various arynophiles are used and result in formation of C&#8722;C, C&#8722;N, C&#8722;O, C&#8722;Cl, and C&#8722;Si bonds; mechanistic insights from experiments and DFT calculations are provided.







Abstract
Herein, the synthesis of 1,2,3,4&#8208;tetrasubstituted benzenoid rings, motifs found in pharmaceutical, agrochemical, and natural products, is described.[1] In the past, the regioselective syntheses of such compounds have been a significant challenge. This work reports a method using substituted arynes derived from aryl(Mes)iodonium salts to access a range of densely functionalized 1,2,3,4&#8208;tetrasubstituted benzenoid rings. Significantly, it was found that halide substituents are compatible under these conditions, enabling post&#8208;synthetic elaboration via palladium&#8208;catalyzed coupling. This concise strategy is predicated on two regioselective events: 1)&#8197;ortho&#8208; deprotonation of aryl(Mes)iodonium salts to generate a substituted aryne intermediate, and 2)&#8197;regioselective trapping of said arynes, thereby improving previously reported reaction conditions to generate arynes at room temperature and in shorter reaction times. Density functional theory (DFT) computations and linear free energy relationship (LFER) analysis suggest the regioselectivity of deprotonation is influenced by both proximal and distal ring substituents on the aryne precursor. A competition experiment further reveals the role of arene substituents on relative reactivity of aryl(Mes)iodoniums as aryne precursors.

         <title>Scalable Synthesis of Porous SiFe@C Composite with Excellent Lithium Storage</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Threesome is impressive: A novel and scalable strategy for the fabrication of porous SiFe@C composite with mesoporous structure is reported. The conductive phase of FeSi2 is partially retained; together with a uniform carbon layer excellent lithium storage is achieved.







Abstract
Utilizing cost&#8208;effective raw materials to prepare high&#8208;performance silicon&#8208;based anode materials for lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) is both challenging and attractive. Herein, a porous SiFe@C (pSiFe@C) composite derived from low&#8208;cost ferrosilicon is prepared via a scalable three&#8208;step procedure, including ball milling, partial etching, and carbon layer coating. The pSiFe@C material integrates the advantages of the mesoporous structure, the partially retained FeSi2 conductive phase, and a uniform carbon layer (12&#8211;16&#8197;nm), which can substantially alleviate the huge volume expansion effect in the repeated lithium&#8208;ion insertion/extraction processes, effectively stabilizing the solid&#8211;electrolyte interphase (SEI) film and markedly enhancing the overall electronic conductivity of the material. Benefiting from the rational structure, the obtained pSiFe@C hybrid material delivers a reversible capacity of 1162.1&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 200&#8197;cycles at 500&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1, with a higher initial coulombic efficiency of 82.30&#8201;%. In addition, it shows large discharge capacities of 803.1 and 600.0&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 500&#8197;cycles at 2 and 4&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1, respectively, manifesting an excellent electrochemical lithium storage. This work provides a good prospect for the commercial production of silicon&#8208;based anode materials for LIBs with a high lithium&#8208;storage capacity.

         <title>Chemical Bonding in Homoleptic Carbonyl Cations [M{Fe(CO)5}2]+ (M=Cu, Ag, Au)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Donation of an electron pair from the HOMO of [Fe(CO)5]2 to the 4s LUMO of Cu+ giving the (+,+) component of the Fe&#8208;Cu&#8208;Fe &#963; bond in [Cu{Fe(CO)5}2]+. The associated charge flow with the direction red&#8594;blue is given by the deformation density.







Abstract
Syntheses of the copper and gold complexes [Cu{Fe(CO)5}2][SbF6] and [Au{Fe(CO)5}2][HOB{3,5&#8208;(CF3)2C6H3}3] containing the homoleptic carbonyl cations [M{Fe(CO)5}2]+ (M=Cu, Au) are reported. Structural data of the rare, trimetallic Cu2Fe, Ag2Fe and Au2Fe complexes [Cu{Fe(CO)5}2][SbF6], [Ag{Fe(CO)5}2][SbF6] and [Au{Fe(CO)5}2][HOB{3,5&#8208;(CF3)2C6H3}3] are also given. The silver and gold cations [M{Fe(CO)5}2]+ (M=Ag, Au) possess a nearly linear Fe&#8208;M&#8208;Fe&#8217; moiety but the Fe&#8208;Cu&#8208;Fe&#8217; in [Cu{Fe(CO)5}2][SbF6] exhibits a significant bending angle of 147&#176; due to the strong interaction with the [SbF6]&#8722; anion. The Fe(CO)5 ligands adopt a distorted square&#8208;pyramidal geometry in the cations [M{Fe(CO)5}2]+, with the basal CO groups inclined towards M. The geometry optimization with DFT methods of the cations [M{Fe(CO)5}2]+ (M=Cu, Ag, Au) gives equilibrium structures with linear Fe&#8208;M&#8208;Fe&#8217; fragments and D2 symmetry for the copper and silver cations and D4d symmetry for the gold cation. There is nearly free rotation of the Fe(CO)5 ligands around the Fe&#8208;M&#8208;Fe&#8217; axis. The calculated bond dissociation energies for the loss of both Fe(CO)5 ligands from the cations [M{Fe(CO)5}2]+ show the order M=Au (De=137.2&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1)&gt;Cu (De=109.0&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1)&gt;Ag (De=92.4&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1). The QTAIM analysis shows bond paths and bond critical points for the M&#8722;Fe linkage but not between M and the CO ligands. The EDA&#8208;NOCV calculations suggest that the [Fe(CO)5]&#8594;M+&#8592;[Fe(CO)5] donation is significantly stronger than the [Fe(CO)5]&#8592;M+&#8594;[Fe(CO)5] backdonation. Inspection of the pairwise orbital interactions identifies four contributions for the charge donation of the Fe(CO)5 ligands into the vacant (n)s and (n)p AOs of M+ and five components for the backdonation from the occupied (n&#8208;1)d AOs of M+ into vacant ligand orbitals.

         <title>Fluorogenic Squaraine Dendrimers for Background&#8208;Free Imaging of Integrin Receptors in Cancer Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fluorogenic dendrimer probe for imaging membrane receptors has been developed. It combines eight squaraine dyes that undergo polarity&#8208;dependent aggregation&#8211;disaggregation within the dendrimer, resulting in OFF&#8211;ON fluorescence response to a biomolecular target. It enables integrin&#8208;specific imaging of cancer cells with high signal&#8208;to&#8208;background ratio.







Abstract
To overcome the limited brightness of existing fluorogenic molecular probes for biomolecular targets, we introduce a concept of fluorogenic dendrimer probe, which undergoes polarity&#8208;dependent switching due to intramolecular aggregation&#8208;caused quenching of its fluorophores. Based on a rational design of dendrimers with four and eight squaraine dyes, we found that octamer bearing dyes through a sufficiently long PEG(8) linker displays &gt;400&#8208;fold fluorescence enhancement from water to non&#8208;polar dioxane. High extinction coefficient (&#8776;2,300,000&#8201;m&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;1) resulted from eight squaraine dyes and quantum yield (&#8776;25&#8201;%) make this octamer the brightest environment&#8208;sensitive fluorogenic molecule reported to date. Its conjugate with cyclic RGD used at low concentration (3&#8197;nm) enables integrin&#8208;specific fluorescence imaging of cancer cells with high signal&#8208;to&#8208;background ratio. The developed dendrimer probe is a &#8220;golden middle&#8221; between molecular probes and nanoparticles, combining small size, turn&#8208;on response and high brightness, important for bioimaging.

         <title>Specific Ion&#8211;Protein Interactions Influence Bacterial Ice Nucleation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Effects of ions on bacterial ice nucleation: Freezing droplet experiments, sum&#8208;frequency generation spectroscopy, and molecular dynamic simulations were used to demonstrate that ions can profoundly influence the efficiency of bacterial ice nucleators in a manner that follows the Hofmeister series. The different effects are due to specific interactions of the ions with ice&#8208;nucleating proteins on the surface of the bacteria.







Abstract
Ice nucleation&#8208;active bacteria are the most efficient ice nucleators known, enabling the crystallization of water at temperatures close to 0&#8201;&#176;C, thereby overcoming the kinetically hindered phase transition process at these conditions. Using highly specialized ice&#8208;nucleating proteins (INPs), they can cause frost damage to plants and influence the formation of clouds and precipitation in the atmosphere. In nature, the bacteria are usually found in aqueous environments containing ions. The impact of ions on bacterial ice nucleation efficiency, however, has remained elusive. Here, we demonstrate that ions can profoundly influence the efficiency of bacterial ice nucleators in a manner that follows the Hofmeister series. Weakly hydrated ions inhibit bacterial ice nucleation whereas strongly hydrated ions apparently facilitate ice nucleation. Surface&#8208;specific sum&#8208;frequency generation spectroscopy and molecular dynamics simulations reveal that the different effects are due to specific interactions of the ions with the INPs on the surface of the bacteria. Our results demonstrate that heterogeneous ice nucleation facilitated by bacteria strongly depends upon the nature of the ions, and specific ion&#8211;protein interactions are essential for the complete description of heterogeneous ice nucleation by bacteria.

         <title>Metal Cation Valency Dependence in Morphology Evolution of Cu2&#8722;xS Nanodisk Seeds and Their Pseudomorphic Cation Exchanges</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tin cation valency&#8208;dependent morphology evolution of Cu2&#8722;xS nanodisk seeds was initially developed. Subsequent pseudomorphic full/partial cation exchanges with Zn2+ and Cd2+ to produce traditionally inaccessible nanostructures were reported as well.







Abstract
A crucial parameter in the design of semiconductor nanoparticles (NPs) with controllable optical, magnetic, electronic, and catalytic properties is the morphology. Herein, we demonstrate the potential of additive metal cations with variable valency to direct the morphology evolution of copper&#8208;deficient Cu2&#8722;xS nanoparticles in the process of seed&#8208;mediated growth. In particular, the djurleite Cu1.94S seed could evolve from disk into tetradecahedron in the presence of tin(IV) cations, whereas they merely formed sharp hexagonal nanodisks with tin(II) cations. In addition to djurleite Cu1.94S, the tin(IV) cations could be generalized to direct the growth of roxbyite Cu1.8S and covellite CuS nanodisk seeds into tetradecahedra. We further perform pseudomorphic cation exchanges of Cu1.94S tetradecahedra with Zn2+ and Cd2+ to produce polyhedral zinc sulfide (ZnS) and cadmium sulfide (CdS) NPs. Moreover, we achieve Cu1.8S/ZnS and Cu1.94S/CdS tetradecahedral heterostructures via partial cation exchange, which are otherwise inaccessible by traditional synthetic approaches.

         <title>Overview of N&#8208;Rich Antennae Investigated in Lanthanide&#8208;Based Temperature Sensing</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Noncontact temperature sensors are gaining importance. Lanthanide&#8208;based temperature sensors stand out as they benefit form for example, high photostability. In this Review, an extensive overview on N&#8208;rich antennae used in lanthanide based temperature sensing is provided. The potential of N&#8208;rich small molecules, bi&#8208;and polynuclear complexes, metal organic frameworks, periodic mesoporous organosilicas and porous organic polymers are discussed.







Abstract
The market share of noncontact temperature sensors is expending due to fast technological and medical evolutions. In the wide variety of noncontact sensors, lanthanide&#8208;based temperature sensors stand out. They benefit from high photostability, relatively long decay times and high quantum yields. To circumvent their low molar light absorption, the incorporation of a light&#8208;harvesting antenna is required. This Review provides an overview of the nitrogen&#8208;rich antennae in lanthanide&#8208;based temperature sensors, emitting in the visible light spectrum, and discusses their temperature sensor ability. The N&#8208;rich ligands are incorporated in many different platforms. The investigation of different antennae is required to develop temperature sensors with diverse optical properties and to create a diverse offer for the multiple application fields. Molecular probes, consisting of small molecules, are first discussed. Furthermore, the thermometer properties of ratiometric temperature sensors, based on di&#8208; and polynuclear complexes, metal&#8211;organic frameworks, periodic mesoporous organosilicas and porous organic polymers, are summarized. The antenna mainly determines the application potential of the ratiometric thermometer. It can be observed that molecular probes are operational in the broad physiological range, metal&#8211;organic frameworks are generally very useful in the cryogenic region, periodic mesoporous organosilica show temperature dependency in the physiological range, and porous organic polymers are operative in the cryogenic&#8208;to&#8208;medium temperature range.

         <title>Biological and Medical Applications of Calcium Phosphate Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Calcium phosphate nanoparticles are well suited to transport organic or biological molecules into cells and tissue. They are well tolerated by cells and organisms and have a clearly defined degradation pathway, also due to their almost ubiquitous presence in the body. Promising applications for them are seen in drug and gene delivery and also in immunization, for example, for vaccination. This Review explores the synthesis, characterization, functionalization and biomedical applications of calcium phosphate nanoparticles from the recent literature.







Abstract
Calcium phosphate nanoparticles have a high biocompatibility and biodegradability due to their chemical similarity to human hard tissue, for example, bone and teeth. They can be used as efficient carriers for different kinds of biomolecules such as nucleic acids, proteins, peptides, antibodies, or drugs, which alone are not able to enter cells where their biological effect is required. They can be loaded with cargo molecules by incorporating them, unlike solid nanoparticles, and also by surface functionalization. This offers protection, for example, against nucleases, and the possibility for cell targeting. If such nanoparticles are functionalized with fluorescing dyes, they can be applied for imaging in vitro and in vivo. Synthesis, functionalization and cell uptake mechanisms of calcium phosphate nanoparticles are discussed together with applications in transfection, gene silencing, imaging, immunization, and bone substitution. Biodistribution data of calcium phosphate nanoparticles in vivo are reviewed.

         <title>Engineered Bifunctional Luminescent Pillared&#8208;Layer Frameworks for Adsorption of CO2 and Sensitive Detection of Nitrobenzene in Aqueous Media</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Space for guests: Five isoreticular luminescent pillared&#8208;layer metal&#8211;organic frameworks showing CO2 uptake and the sensitive detection of nitrobenzene (NB) in aqueous solution are engineered. The NB&#8208;included framework provides direct evidence for framework&#8211;NB interactions.







Abstract
Through a dual&#8208;ligand synthetic approach, five isoreticular primitive cubic (pcu)&#8208;type pillared&#8208;layer metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs), [Zn2(dicarboxylate)2(NI&#8208;bpy&#8208;44)]&#8901;x&#8201;DMF&#8901;y&#8201;H2O, in which dicarboxylate=1,4&#8208;bdc (1), Br&#8208;1,4&#8208;bdc (2), NH2&#8208;1,4&#8208;bdc (3), 2,6&#8208;ndc (4), and bpdc (5), have been engineered. MOFs 1&#8211;5 feature twofold degrees of interpenetration and have open pores of 27.0, 33.6, 36.8, 52.5, and 62.1&#8201;%, respectively. Nitrogen adsorption isotherms of activated MOFs 1&#8242;&#8211;5&#8242; at 77&#8197;K all displayed type&#8197;I adsorption behavior, suggesting their microporous nature. Although 1&#8242; and 3&#8242;&#8211;5&#8242; exhibited type&#8197;I adsorption isotherms of CO2 at 195&#8197;K, MOF 2&#8242; showed a two&#8208;step gate&#8208;opening sorption isotherm of CO2. Furthermore, MOF 3&#8242; also had a significant influence of amine functions on CO2 uptake at high temperature due to the CO2&#8211;framework interactions. MOFs 1&#8211;5 revealed solvent&#8208;dependent fluorescence properties; their strong blue&#8208;light emissions in aqueous suspensions were efficiently quenched by trace amounts of nitrobenzene (NB), with limits of detection of 4.54, 5.73, 1.88, 2.30, and 2.26&#8197;&#956;m, respectively, and Stern&#8211;Volmer quenching constants (Ksv) of 2.93&#215;103, 1.79&#215;103, 3.78&#215;103, 4.04&#215;103, and 3.21&#215;103&#8201;m&#8722;1, respectively. Of particular note, the NB&#8208;included framework, NB@3, provided direct evidence of the binding sites, which showed strong host&#8211;guest &#960;&#8211;&#960; and hydrogen&#8208;bonding interactions beneficial for donor&#8211;acceptor electron transfer and resulting in fluorescence quenching.

Although &lt;b&gt;1&#8242;&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;3&#8242;&lt;/b&gt;&#8211;&lt;b&gt;5&#8242;&lt;/b&gt; exhibited type&#8197;I adsorption isotherms of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; at 195&#8197;K, MOF &lt;b&gt;2&#8242;&lt;/b&gt; showed a two&#8208;step gate&#8208;opening sorption isotherm of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Furthermore, MOF &lt;b&gt;3&#8242;&lt;/b&gt; also had a significant influence of amine functions on CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; uptake at high temperature due to the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8211;framework interactions. MOFs &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;&#8211;&lt;b&gt;5&lt;/b&gt; revealed solvent&#8208;dependent fluorescence properties; their strong blue&#8208;light emissions in aqueous suspensions were efficiently quenched by trace amounts of nitrobenzene (NB), with limits of detection of 4.54, 5.73, 1.88, 2.30, and 2.26&#8197;&#956;&lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;m&lt;/span&gt;, respectively, and Stern&#8211;Volmer quenching constants (&lt;i&gt;K&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;sv&lt;/sub&gt;) of 2.93&#215;10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, 1.79&#215;10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, 3.78&#215;10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, 4.04&#215;10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, and 3.21&#215;10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;
&lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;m&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, respectively. Of particular note, the NB&#8208;included framework, NB@&lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt;, provided direct evidence of the binding sites, which showed strong host&#8211;guest &#960;&#8211;&#960; and hydrogen&#8208;bonding interactions beneficial for donor&#8211;acceptor electron transfer and resulting in fluorescence quenching.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Iron Catalyzed Double Bond Isomerization: Evidence for an FeI/FeIII Catalytic Cycle</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using deuterium labelling, electrochemistry, EPR and DFT, an iron catalyzed double bond isomerization reaction was disclosed that is likely to proceed through on&#8208;cycle FeI and FeIII intermediates. The reaction uses an FeII pre&#8208;catalyst that undergoes a one&#8208;electron reduction to get to the first on&#8208;cycle species. These studies on mechanism, along with synthetic scope of the reaction, are presented.







Abstract
Iron&#8208;catalyzed isomerization of alkenes is reported using an iron(II) &#946;&#8208;diketiminate pre&#8208;catalyst. The reaction proceeds with a catalytic amount of a hydride source, such as pinacol borane (HBpin) or ammonia borane (H3N&#8901;BH3). Reactivity with both allyl arenes and aliphatic alkenes has been studied. The catalytic mechanism was investigated by a variety of means, including deuteration studies, Density Functional Theory (DFT) and Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) spectroscopy. The data obtained support a pre&#8208;catalyst activation step that gives access to an &#951;2&#8208;coordinated alkene FeI complex, followed by oxidative addition of the alkene to give an FeIII intermediate, which then undergoes reductive elimination to allow release of the isomerization product.

         <title>Selection of Planar Chiral Conformations between Pillar[5,6]arenes Induced by Amino Acid Derivatives in Aqueous Media</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A side&#8208;chain link to chirality: The &#945;&#8208;side chain or ethyl ester moieties of a chiral &#945;&#8208;amino acid ethyl ester hydrochloride were recognized by detecting induced CD signals of WP5 or its homologue WP6. The forces involved in selecting the chiral conformation, such as C (or N)&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; interactions, hydrogen bonds, and &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking were illuminated by DFT calculations.







Abstract
Chiral &#945;&#8208;amino acids play critical roles in the metabolic process in nearly all life forms. So far, chiral recognition of &#945;&#8208;amino acids has mainly focused on the determination of l/d enantiomers. Herein, selection of planar chiral conformations between water&#8208;soluble pillar[5]arene WP5 and pillar[6]arene WP6 was observed due to &#945;&#8208;side chain or ethyl ester moieties of l&#8208;&#945;&#8208;amino acid ethyl ester hydrochlorides binding with WP5 and WP6, respectively. Therefore, &#945;&#8208;side chain and ethyl ester moieties of l&#8208;&#945;&#8208;amino acid ethyl ester hydrochlorides were recognized by observing the induced CD signal and its inversion. This is a rare example of being able to detect the chiral region around &#945;&#8208;carbon of a chiral &#945;&#8208;amino acid molecule.

         <title>Catalytic Performance of Zr&#8208;Based Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks Zr&#8208;abtc and MIP&#8208;200 in Selective Oxidations with H2O2</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An eight&#8208;connected metal&#8211;organic framework Zr&#8208;abtc catalyzes a range of H2O2&#8208;based selective oxidations. The significant predominance of 1,2&#8208;epoxide in the epoxidation of carvone and high sulfone selectivity in thioether oxidation point to a nucleophilic oxidation mechanism. With highly reactive alkenes, such as caryophyllene, electrophilic oxidation can also be realized.







Abstract
The catalytic performance of Zr&#8208;abtc and MIP&#8208;200 metal&#8211;organic frameworks consisting of 8&#8208;connected Zr6 clusters and tetratopic linkers was investigated in H2O2&#8208;based selective oxidations and compared with that of 12&#8208;coordinated UiO&#8208;66 and UiO&#8208;67. Zr&#8208;abtc demonstrated advantages in both substrate conversion and product selectivity for epoxidation of electron&#8208;deficient C=C bonds in &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated ketones. The significant predominance of 1,2&#8208;epoxide in carvone epoxidation, coupled with high sulfone selectivity in thioether oxidation, points to a nucleophilic oxidation mechanism over Zr&#8208;abtc. The superior catalytic performance in the epoxidation of unsaturated ketones correlates with a larger amount of weak basic sites in Zr&#8208;abtc. Electrophilic activation of H2O2 can also be realized, as evidenced by the high activity of Zr&#8208;abtc in epoxidation of the electron&#8208;rich C=C bond in caryophyllene. XRD and FTIR studies confirmed the retention of the Zr&#8208;abtc structure after the catalysis. The low activity of MIP&#8208;200 in H2O2&#8208;based oxidations is most likely related to its specific hydrophilicity, which disfavors adsorption of organic substrates and H2O2.

         <title>New Noncentrosymmetric Tetrel Pnictides Composed of Square&#8208;Planar Gold(I) with Peculiar Bonding</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bonding natures: Compared with common types of AuI coordination observed in extended solids, square&#8208;planar coordination is rare. Au(I)relia shows off the three&#8208;centered bonding of Au&#8722;Tt&#8722;Au and Au&#8722;Pn&#8722;Au (on her feathers; Tt=tetrel, Pn=pnictogen), square&#8208;planar cis&#8208;[AuTt2Pn2] units (her body), and linear chains of Au (her legs) that are characteristic of equiatomic AuSiAs, AuGeP, and AuGeAs compounds.







Abstract
Three novel isostructural equiatomic gold tetrel pnictides, AuSiAs, AuGeP, and AuGeAs, were synthesized and characterized. These phases crystallize in the noncentrosymmetric (NCS) monoclinic space group Cc (no. 9), featuring square&#8208;planar Au within cis&#8208;[AuTt2Pn2] units (Tt=tetrel, Si, Ge; Pn=pnictogen, P, As). This is in drastic contrast to the structure of previously reported AuSiP, which exhibits typical linear coordination of Au with Si and P. Chemical bonding analysis through the electron localization function suggests covalent two&#8208;center two&#8208;electron Tt&#8722;Pn bonds, and three&#8208;center Au&#8722;Tt&#8722;Au and Au&#8722;Pn&#8722;Au bonds with 1.6&#8197;e&#8722; per bond. X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy studies support the covalent and nonionic nature of Au&#8722;Pn and Au&#8722;Tt bonds. The title materials were found to be n&#8208;type narrow&#8208;gap semiconductors or semimetals, with nearly temperature&#8208;independent electrical resistivities and low thermal conductivities. A combination of the semimetallic properties with tunable NCS structure provides opportunities for the development of materials based on gold tetrel pnictides.

These phases crystallize in the noncentrosymmetric (NCS) monoclinic space group &lt;i&gt;Cc&lt;/i&gt; (no. 9), featuring square&#8208;planar Au within &lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;[AuTt&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Pn&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;] units (Tt=tetrel, Si, Ge; Pn=pnictogen, P, As). This is in drastic contrast to the structure of previously reported AuSiP, which exhibits typical linear coordination of Au with Si and P. Chemical bonding analysis through the electron localization function suggests covalent two&#8208;center two&#8208;electron Tt&#8722;Pn bonds, and three&#8208;center Au&#8722;Tt&#8722;Au and Au&#8722;Pn&#8722;Au bonds with 1.6&#8197;&lt;i&gt;e&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; per bond. X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy studies support the covalent and nonionic nature of Au&#8722;Pn and Au&#8722;Tt bonds. The title materials were found to be &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;type narrow&#8208;gap semiconductors or semimetals, with nearly temperature&#8208;independent electrical resistivities and low thermal conductivities. A combination of the semimetallic properties with tunable NCS structure provides opportunities for the development of materials based on gold tetrel pnictides.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Circularly Polarized Luminescence of Achiral Metal&#8211;Organic Colloids and Guest Molecules in a Vortex Field</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Spinning around: Two metal&#8211;organic colloids based on achiral starting materials show active CD and circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) properties in a vortex field. The optical properties of the colloids can be transferred to achiral Rhodamine derivatives, with glum 10&#8722;2 in magnitude and quantum yields of 40&#8211;83&#8201;%.







Abstract
Recently, scientists have reported a range of chiral fluorescence materials or chiral composites that can emit circularly polarized luminescence. Herein, two achiral metal&#8211;organic colloidal solutions were studied, showing active circularly polarized luminescence, which is observed in vortex stirring. The absolute values for glum are 0.05 and 0.03 and the plus or minus sign of glum depends on the colloidal structure and stirring direction, which make the property easy to manipulate. Further, the host&#8211;guest interaction study suggests both electrostatic interactions and coordination bonding may influence the chiroptical property from the colloidal solution to the guest molecule. Rhodamine 6G and its carboxylic acid derivative exhibit good quantum yields and acceptable glum values in the colloidal solution.

         <title>Altered Membrane Mechanics Provides a Receptor&#8208;Independent Pathway for Serotonin Action</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
It is known that serotonin binds to lipid membranes with high affinity, but what does it do to it? We find that it makes artificial lipid bilayers softer and easier to indent by an AFM tip (top), and promotes disorder in ordered regions. For cell membranes, this effect facilitates increased endocytosis (bottom). This increase occurs even when the serotonin receptors are blocked, providing a receptor&#8208;independent pathway for serotonin action.







Abstract
Serotonin, an important signaling molecule in humans, has an unexpectedly high lipid membrane affinity. The significance of this finding has evoked considerable speculation. Here we show that membrane binding by serotonin can directly modulate membrane properties and cellular function, providing an activity pathway completely independent of serotonin receptors. Atomic force microscopy shows that serotonin makes artificial lipid bilayers softer, and induces nucleation of liquid disordered domains inside the raft&#8208;like liquid&#8208;ordered domains. Solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy corroborates this data at the atomic level, revealing a homogeneous decrease in the order parameter of the lipid chains in the presence of serotonin. In the RN46A immortalized serotonergic neuronal cell line, extracellular serotonin enhances transferrin receptor endocytosis, even in the presence of broad&#8208;spectrum serotonin receptor and transporter inhibitors. Similarly, it increases the membrane binding and internalization of oligomeric peptides. Our results uncover a mode of serotonin&#8211;membrane interaction that can potentiate key cellular processes in a receptor&#8208;independent fashion.

         <dc:description>
Charged droplets: The detection of multiply charged helium droplet anions is reported for the first time. By ionizing droplets of superfluid helium with low energy electrons (up to 25&#8197;eV), it was possible to produce droplets containing up to five negative charges, which remain intact on the timescale of the experiment.







Abstract
The detection of multiply charged helium droplet anions is reported for the first time. By ionizing droplets of superfluid helium with low energy electrons (up to 25&#8197;eV), it was possible to produce droplets containing up to five negative charges, which remain intact on the timescale of the experiment. The appearance sizes for different charge states are determined and are found to be orders of magnitude larger than for the equivalent cationic droplets, starting at 4 million He atoms for dianions. Droplets with He*&#8722; as charge carriers show signs of being metastable, but this effect is quenched by the pickup of water molecules.

         <title>Characterization of the Simplest Thiolimine: The Higher Energy Tautomer of Thioformamide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Keep it simple! Thioamides resemble viable prebiotic building blocks for biologically relevant molecules. However, only a handful of experimental reports on parent thioformamide exist. X&#8208;ray diffraction data of thioformamide are reported and its tautomerization induced by UV irradiation under cryogenic conditions is presented. Four conformers of the corresponding thiolimine form, whose (tunneling) reactivity is investigated.







Abstract
As sulfur&#8208;containing organic molecules thioamides and their isomers are conceivable intermediates in prebiotic chemistry, for example, in the formation of amino acids and thiazoles and resemble viable candidates for detection in interstellar media. Here, we report the characterization of parent thioformamide in the solid state via single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and its photochemical interconversion to its hitherto unreported higher energy tautomer thiolimine in inert argon and dinitrogen matrices. Upon photogeneration, four conformers of thiolimine form, whose ratio depends on the employed wavelength. One of these conformers interconverts due to quantum mechanical tunneling with a half&#8208;life of 30&#8211;45&#8197;min in both matrix materials at 3 and 20&#8197;K. A spontaneous reverse reaction from thiolimine to thioformamide is not observed. To support our experimental findings, we explored the potential energy surface of the system at the AE&#8208;CCSD(T)/aug&#8208;cc&#8208;pCVTZ level of theory and computed tunneling half&#8208;lives with the CVT/SCT approach applying DFT methods.

         <title>Tunable Anticancer Activity of Furoylthiourea&#8208;Based RuII&#8211;Arene Complexes and Their Mechanism of Action</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multitasking! Fourteen new Ru&#8211;arene (p&#8208;cymene or benzene) complexes bearing different furoylthiourea ligands have been synthesized and characterized. All the complexes were found to be highly toxic towards IMR&#8208;32 cancer cells. The complexes catalytically oxidized glutathione and promoted cell death by apoptosis and cell cycle arrest. They also showed good binding ability with receptors commonly overexpressed in cancer cells.







Abstract
Fourteen new RuII&#8211;arene (p&#8208;cymene/benzene) complexes (C1&#8211;C14) have been synthesized by varying the N&#8208;terminal substituent in the furoylthiourea ligand and satisfactorily characterized by using analytical and spectroscopic techniques. Electrostatic potential maps predicted that the electronic effect of the substituents was mostly localized, with some influence seen on the labile chloride ligands. The structure&#8211;activity relationships of the Ru&#8211;p&#8208;cymene and Ru&#8211;benzene complexes showed opposite trends. All the complexes were found to be highly toxic towards IMR&#8208;32 cancer cells, with C5 (Ru&#8211;p&#8208;cymene complex containing C6H2(CH3)3 as N&#8208;terminal substituent) and C13 (Ru&#8211;benzene complex containing C6H4(CF3) as N&#8208;terminal substituent) showing the highest activity among each set of complexes, and hence they were chosen for further study. These complexes showed different behavior in aqueous solutions, and were also found to catalytically oxidize glutathione. They also promoted cell death by apoptosis and cell cycle arrest. Furthermore, the complexes showed good binding ability with the receptors Pim&#8208;1 kinase and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2, commonly overexpressed in cancer cells.

All the complexes were found to be highly toxic towards IMR&#8208;32 cancer cells, with &lt;b&gt;C5&lt;/b&gt; (Ru&#8211;&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;cymene complex containing C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; as &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;terminal substituent) and &lt;b&gt;C13&lt;/b&gt; (Ru&#8211;benzene complex containing C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;(CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) as &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;terminal substituent) showing the highest activity among each set of complexes, and hence they were chosen for further study. These complexes showed different behavior in aqueous solutions, and were also found to catalytically oxidize glutathione. They also promoted cell death by apoptosis and cell cycle arrest. Furthermore, the complexes showed good binding ability with the receptors Pim&#8208;1 kinase and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2, commonly overexpressed in cancer cells.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Novel Ferrocene&#8208;Appended &#946;&#8208;Ketoimines and Related BF2 Derivatives with Significant Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission and Second&#8208;Order Nonlinear Optical Properties</title>

Strong candidates! The synthesis and structural characterization of ferrocene&#8208;appended &#946;&#8208;ketoimines and their BF2 complexes is reported. A study of their photophysical properties revealed that both the &#946;&#8208;ketoimines and their BF2 complexes show aggregation&#8208;induced emission and a strong second&#8208;order nonlinear optical (NLO) response, and thus are excellent multifunctional candidates for NLO and luminescence applications.







Abstract
A series of new &#946;&#8208;ketoimines containing a ferrocene moiety and their BF2 complexes have been synthesized and structurally characterized. The solvatochromism of the &#946;&#8208;ketoimines was studied, putting in evidence a redshift with increasing solvent polarity. This positive solvatochromism can be attributed to a more polarized excited state compared with the ground state, due to intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) transitions. The &#946;&#8208;ketoimines exhibited weak emission, attributable to the excited&#8208;state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT) phenomenon. This ESIPT effect is suppressed upon restriction of the keto&#8208;enamine tautomerism, induced upon addition of BF3&#8901;OEt2, which afforded the related BF2 complexes, characterized by an enhancement of the fluorescence through the ICT effect. Both the &#946;&#8208;ketoimines and BF2 complexes exhibited significant aggregation&#8208;induced emission behavior in mixtures of CH3CN/H2O, due to restriction of intramolecular rotation in the aggregated state. The frontier molecular orbital levels, ground&#8208; and excited&#8208;state dipole moments (&#956;g and &#956;e), and the origin of electronic absorption spectra were studied by time&#8208;dependent DFT calculations. The second&#8208;order nonlinear optical (NLO) properties were determined by the electric&#8208;field&#8208;induced second&#8208;harmonic generation technique. The &#956;&#946;1907 values of the &#946;&#8208;ketoimines increased upon the formation of the related BF2 complexes, mainly due to an enhancement of the ground&#8208;state dipole moment. The results presented here reveal that some of these novel compounds are excellent multifunctional candidates for NLO and luminescence applications.

         <title>Controlling Emissive Properties by Intramolecular Hydrogen Bonds: Alkyl and Aryl meso&#8208;Substituted Porphycenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
Porphycene, a porphyrin isomer, is an efficient fluorophore. However, four&#8208;fold meso substitution with alkyl groups decreases the fluorescence quantum yield by orders of magnitude. For aryl substituents, this effect is small. To explain this difference, we have synthesized and studied a mixed aryl&#8208;alkyl&#8208;substituted compound, 9,20&#8208;diphenyl&#8208;10,19&#8208;dimethylporphycene, as well as the 9,20&#8208;diphenyl and 9,20&#8208;dimethyl derivatives. Analysis of the structural, spectroscopic, and photophysical data of the six porphycenes, combined with quantum chemical calculations, shows a clear correlation between the strength of the intramolecular NH&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;N hydrogen bonds and the efficiency of the radiationless depopulation of the lowest&#8208;excited singlet state. This result led us to propose a model in which the delocalization of the inner protons in the cavity of the macrocycle is responsible for the nonradiative deactivation channel. The applicability of the model is confirmed by the literature data for other alkyl&#8208; or aryl&#8208;substituted porphycenes. The finding of a correlation between structural and emissive characteristics enables a rational design of porphycenes with desired photophysical properties.

Abstract
We report on the results of an in&#8197;situ synchrotron powder X&#8208;ray diffraction study of the crystallisation in aqueous medium of two recently discovered perfluorinated CeIV&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs), analogues of the already well investigated ZrIV&#8208;based UiO&#8208;66 and MIL&#8208;140A, namely, F4_UiO&#8208;66(Ce) and F4_MIL&#8208;140A(Ce). The two MOFs were originally obtained in pure form in similar conditions, using ammonium cerium nitrate and tetrafluoroterephthalic acid as reagents, and small variations of the reaction parameters were found to yield mixed phases. Here, we investigate the crystallisation of these compounds, varying parameters such as temperature, amount of the protonation modulator nitric acid and amount of the coordination modulator acetic acid. When only HNO3 is present in the reaction environment, only F4_MIL&#8208;140A(Ce) is obtained. Heating preferentially accelerates nucleation, which becomes rate determining below 57&#8201;&#176;C. Upon addition of AcOH to the system, alongside HNO3, mixed&#8208;phased products are obtained. F4_UiO&#8208;66(Ce) is always formed faster, and no interconversion between the two phases occurs. In the case of F4_UiO&#8208;66(Ce), crystal growth is always the rate&#8208;determining step. A higher amount of HNO3 favours the formation of F4_MIL&#8208;140A(Ce), whereas increasing the amount of AcOH favours the formation of F4_UiO&#8208;66(Ce). Based on the in&#8197;situ results, a new optimised route to achieving a pure, high&#8208;quality F4_MIL&#8208;140A(Ce) phase in mild conditions (60&#8201;&#176;C, 1&#8197;h) is also identified.

The European Young Chemists&#8217; Network (EYCN) has been actively collaborating with the European Chemical Society (EuChemS) to create a platform for early&#8208;career scientists to contribute to policy&#8208;making in Europe. This article comments on the roles of chemists in policy&#8208;making and provides an overview of the initiatives and platforms for influencing at the European level from the perspective of early&#8208;career chemists, hoping to stimulate further engagement.







Abstract
Global societal challenges emphasize the importance of collaboration between scientists and policy&#8208;makers, while the participation of a diverse group of professionals, including early&#8208;career scientists, is critical towards a sustainable future. The European Young Chemists&#8217; Network (EYCN) has been actively working with the European Chemical Society (EuChemS) to create a platform for early&#8208;career chemists in policy advice. This article comments on the possible roles of scientists in policy&#8208;making and provides an overview of relevant initiatives and platforms at the European level that could facilitate involvement. Opportunities for participation in policy advice from the perspective of early&#8208;career chemists are discussed and examples of impact are provided, hoping to stimulate further discussions and engagement in policy&#8208;making.

Abstract
The so far missing parent compound of the large family of pentaphosphaferrocenes [CpFe(&#951;5&#8208;P5)] (1&#8201;b) was synthesized by the thermolysis of [CpFe(CO)2]2 with P4 using the very high&#8208;boiling solvent diisopropylbenzene. It was comprehensively characterized by, inter alia, NMR spectroscopy, single crystal X&#8208;ray structure analysis, cyclic voltammetry and DFT computations. Moreover, its coordination behavior towards CuI halides was explored, revealing the unprecedented 2D polymeric networks [{CpFe(&#951;5:1:1:1:1&#8208;P5)}Cu2(&#956;&#8208;X)2]n (2&#8201;a: X=Cl, 2&#8201;b: X=Br) and [{CpFe(&#951;5:1:1&#8208;P5)}Cu(&#956;&#8208;I)]n (3) and even the first cyclo&#8208;P5&#8208;containing 3D coordination polymer [{CpFe(&#951;5:1:1&#8208;P5)}Cu(&#956;&#8208;I)]n (4). The sandwich complex&#8197;1&#8201;b can also be incorporated in nano&#8208;sized supramolecules based on [Cp*Fe(&#951;5&#8208;P5)] (1&#8201;a) and CuX (X=Cl, Br, I): [CpFe(&#951;5&#8208;P5)]@[{Cp*Fe(&#951;5&#8208;P5)}12(CuX)20&#8208;n] (5&#8201;a: X=Cl, n=2.4; 5&#8201;b: X=Br, n=2.4; 5&#8201;c: X=I, n=0.95). Thereby, the formation of the CuI&#8208;containing fullerene&#8208;like sphere 5&#8201;c is found for the first time.

Abstract
In recent years, luminescent materials doped with Ln3+ ions have attracted much attention for their application as optical thermometers based on both downshifting and upconversion processes. This study presents research done on the development of highly sensitive optical thermometers in the physiological temperature range based on poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) films doped with two series of visible Ln3+ complexes (Ln3+=Tb3+, Eu3+, and Sm3+) and SiO2 nanoparticles (NPs) coated with these PMMA films. The best performing PMMA film doped with Tb3+ and Eu3+ complexes was the PMMA[TbEuL1tppo]1 film (L1=4,4,4&#8208;trifluoro&#8208;1&#8208;phenyl&#8208;1,3&#8208;butadionate; tppo=triphenylphosphine oxide), which showed good temperature sensing of Sr=4.21&#8201;%&#8201;K&#8722;1 at 313&#8197;K, whereas for the PMMA films doped with Tb3+ and Sm3+ complexes the best performing was the PMMA[TbSmL2tppo]3 film (L2=4,4,4&#8208;trifluoro&#8208;1&#8208;(4&#8208;chlorophenyl)&#8208;1,3&#8208;butadionate), with Sr=3.64&#8201;%&#8201;K&#8722;1 at 313&#8197;K. Additionally, SiO2 NPs coated with the best performing films from each of the series of PMMA films (Tb&#8211;Eu and Tb&#8211;Sm) and their temperature&#8208;sensing properties were studied in water, showing excellent performance in the physiological temperature range (PMMA[TbEuL1tppo]1@SiO2: Sr=3.84&#8201;%&#8201;&#176;C at 20&#8201;&#176;C; PMMA[TbSmL2tppo]3@SiO2: Sr=3.27&#8201;%&#8201;&#176;C at 20&#8201;&#176;C) and the toxicity of these nanoparticles on human cells was studied, showing that they were nontoxic.

         <title>Directing Polymorphism in the Helical Nanofilament Phase</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polymorphism is defined as the formation of more than two kinds of crystal structures from a single compound, which is essential for practical applications such as pharmaceuticals and agriculture. Stimuli&#8208;responsive polymorphism of the helical nanofilament (HNF) is investigated by using light&#8208;driven and nanoconfinement methods. The light&#8208;driven HNFs form the twisted ribbons, while the nanoconfined HNFs show the cylindrical ribbons. The discovery of polymorphism on HNF structures will provide insights for future studies on chirality. More information can be found in the Full Paper by D.&#8197;K. Yoon et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202005221).

         <title>Enantioselective Aromatic Amination?</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>









Abstract
The atroposelective formation of C&#8722;N bonds has recently emerged within the field of amination reactions. On first sight, it may seem quite surprising that such an ancient class of organic coupling reactions (Gabriel, Ullmann, Goldberg, Buchwald, Hartwig and many others) has so few enantioselective solutions, and this in spite of asymmetric synthesis being now a mature concept and field. Why should enantioselective C&#8722;N bond formation be so difficult? This question and some of the first examples that promise an imminent change of paradigm are herein discussed.

         <title>Highly Emissive 9&#8208;Borafluorene Derivatives: Synthesis, Photophysical Properties and Device Fabrication</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Luminescent boroles: Highly twisted donor&#8208;functionalised 9&#8208;borafluorenes have been synthesised that exhibit bright luminescence without obvious charge&#8208;transfer character, as well as excellent thermal stability, suggesting their suitability for optoelectronic applications (see figure). Two organic light&#8208;emitting diode devices fabricated with these compounds showed properties highly favourable for future development.







Abstract
A series of 9&#8208;borafluorene derivatives, functionalised with electron&#8208;donating groups, have been prepared. Some of these 9&#8208;borafluorene compounds exhibit strong yellowish emission in solution and in the solid state with relatively high quantum yields (up to 73.6&#8201;% for FMesB&#8208;Cz as a neat film). The results suggest that the highly twisted donor groups suppress charge transfer, but the intrinsic photophysical properties of the 9&#8208;borafluorene systems remain. The new compounds showed enhanced stability towards the atmosphere, and exhibited excellent thermal stability, revealing their potential for application in materials science. Organic light&#8208;emitting diode (OLED) devices were fabricated with two of the highly emissive compounds, and they exhibited strong yellow&#8208;greenish electroluminescence, with a maximum luminance intensity of &gt;22&#8201;000&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2. These are the first two examples of 9&#8208;borafluorene derivatives being used as light&#8208;emitting materials in OLED devices, and they have enabled us to achieve a balance between maintaining their intrinsic properties while improving their stability.

         <title>The Prospect of Dimensionality in Porous Semiconductors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
With the advent of electronic devices, lightweight alternatives to conventionally used semiconductors are required. Porous (metal&#8211;)organic semiconductors are intriguing alternatives to silicon and especially their structural tunability resulted in a wide variety of functional materials. Although molecular design of these semiconductors is well understood, dimensionality and its influences are seldomly evaluated. In this Minireview, the role of dimensionality in porous semiconductors is critically evaluated.







Abstract
With the advent of silicon&#8208;based semiconductors, a plethora of previously unknown technologies became possible. The development of lightweight low&#8208;dimensional organic semiconductors followed soon after. However, the efficient charge/electron transfers enabled by the non&#8208;porous 3D structure of silicon is rather challenging to be realized by their (metal&#8208;)organic counterparts. Nevertheless, the demand for lighter, more efficient semiconductors is steadily increasing resulting in a growing interest in (metal&#8208;)organic semiconductors. These novel materials are faced with a variety of challenges originating from their chemical design, their packing and crystallinity. Although the effect of molecular design is quite well understood, the influence of dimensionality and the associated change in properties (porosity, packing, conjugation) is still an uncharted area in (metal&#8208;)organic semiconductors, yet highly important for their practical utilization. In this Minireview, an overview on the design and synthesis of porous semiconductors, with a particular emphasis on organic semiconductors, is presented and the influence of dimensionality is discussed.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Dependent and Selective Crystallization of CAU&#8208;10 and MIL&#8208;53 Frameworks through Linker Nitration</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In the frame: The nitration of the V&#8208;shaped linker 5&#8208;hydroxyisophthalic acid by Al(NO3)3 and Ga(NO3)3 prior to crystallization of the MOF leads selectively to Al&#8208;CAU&#8208;10 and Ga&#8208;MIL&#8208;53 type compounds. In situ IR spectroscopy and light scattering experiments in combination with 1H&#8208;NMR spectroscopy were used to study the product formation. DFT and GCMC calculations were employed to understand the differences in framework formation and water adsorption properties.







Abstract
The reaction of the V&#8208;shaped linker molecule 5&#8208;hydroxyisophthalic acid (H2L0), with Al or Ga nitrate under almost identical reaction conditions leads to the nitration of the linker and subsequent formation of metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) with CAU&#8208;10 or MIL&#8208;53 type structure of composition [Al(OH)(L)], denoted as Al&#8208;CAU&#8208;10&#8208;L0,&#8201;2,&#8201;4,&#8201;6 or [Ga(OH)(L)], denoted as Ga&#8208;MIL&#8208;53&#8208;L2. The Al&#8208;MOF contains the original linker L0 as well as three different nitration products (L2, L4 and L4/6), whereas the Ga&#8208;MOF mainly incorporates the linker L2. The compositions were deduced by 1H&#8201;NMR spectroscopy and confirmed by Rietveld refinement. In situ and ex situ studies were carried out to follow the nitration and crystallization, as well as the composition of the MOFs. The crystal structures were refined against powder X&#8208;ray diffraction (PXRD) data. As anticipated, the use of the V&#8208;shaped linker results in the formation of the CAU&#8208;10 type structure in the Al&#8208;MOF. Unexpectedly, the Ga&#8208;MOF crystallizes in a MIL&#8208;53 type structure, which is usually observed with linear or slightly bent linker molecules. To study the structure directing effect of the in situ nitrated linker, pure 2&#8208;nitrobenzene&#8208;1,3&#8208;dicarboxylic acid (m&#8208;H2BDC&#8208;NO2) was employed which exclusively led to the formation of [Ga(OH)(C8H3NO6)] (Ga&#8208;MIL&#8208;53&#8208;m&#8208;BDC&#8208;NO2), which is isoreticular to Ga&#8208;MIL&#8208;53&#8208;L2. Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations confirmed the higher stability of Ga&#8208;MIL&#8208;53&#8208;L2 compared to Ga&#8208;CAU&#8208;10&#8208;L2 and grand canonical Monte Carlo simulations (GCMC) are in agreement with the observed water adsorption isotherms of Ga&#8208;MIL&#8208;53&#8208;L2.

         <title>Helically and Linearly Fused Rylenediimide&#8208;Hexabenzocoronenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fantastic fusion: The fusion of naphthalene&#8208; as well as perylenediimides and hexabenzocoronenes via a fully conjugated benzimidazole linker enables the formation of helical as well as linear &#960;&#8208;extended donor&#8211;acceptor&#8208;hybrids applying Diels&#8211;Alder and Scholl&#8208;type chemistry. Remarkable differences in aggregation, charge&#8208;transfer (CT) stabilization as well as CT lifetimes emphasize the influence of the configuration of the bridge on donor&#8211;acceptor properties.







Abstract
Perylene&#8208; as well as naphthalenediimides were fused to hexabenzocoronenes (HBCs) at their imide position to realize highly &#960;&#8208;extended donor&#8211;acceptor (D&#8211;A)&#8208;hybrids. Successful isomer separation in the first step was decisive to guarantee a straightforward synthetic sequence. Hexaphenylbenzenes as precursors were accessed via Diels&#8211;Alder reactions and reacted in a Scholl oxidation to yield the respective HBC derivatives. The fully conjugated benzimidazole linker, which separates the electron donating HBC from the electron accepting rylenediimide, enabled the formation of either a linear or a helical configuration. Largely different chemical, physical, and optoelectrical characteristics were noted for the two configurations. What stood out was their aggregation and their excited state deactivation depending on the solvent polarity. Results from global analysis of the femtosecond transient absorption data corroborated the formation of a charge&#8208;transfer (CT) state that is stabilized in the helically fused configuration relative to the linear analogue. However, a comparison with spectroelectrochemical experiments failed to disclose evidence for a charge&#8208;separated (CS) state.

         <title>Experimental and Computational Studies on Quadruply Bonded Dimolybdenum Complexes with Terminal and Bridging Hydride Ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Quadruply bonded dimolybdenum complexes: A variety of hydride complexes with a quadruply bonded Mo2 core are presented in his article, focusing on an unusual trans&#8208;(H)Mo&#8803;Mo(H) central unit stabilized by amidinate ligands. The structure and thermodynamic stability of the different adducts have been investigated by experimental and computational techniques.







Abstract
This contribution focuses on complex [Mo2(H)2(&#956;&#8208;AdDipp2)2] (1) and tetrahydrofuran and pyridine adducts [Mo2(H)2(&#956;&#8208;AdDipp2)2(L)2] (1&#8901;thf and 1&#8901;py), which contain a trans&#8208;(H)Mo&#8803;Mo(H) core (AdDipp2=HC(NDipp2)2; Dipp=2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3). Computational studies provide insights into the coordination and electronic characteristics of the central trans&#8208;Mo2H2 unit of 1, with four&#8208;coordinate, fourteen&#8208;electron Mo atoms and &#1013;&#8208;agostic interactions with Dipp methyl groups. Small size C&#8208; and N&#8208;donors give rise to related complexes 1&#8901;L but only one molecule of P&#8208;donors, for example, PMe3, can bind to 1, causing one of the hydrides to form a three&#8208;centered, two&#8208;electron (3c&#8208;2e) Mo&#8208;H&#8594;Mo bond (2&#8901;PMe3). A DFT analysis of the terminal and bridging hydride coordination to the Mo&#8803;Mo bond is also reported, along with reactivity studies of the Mo&#8722;H bonds of these complexes. Reactions investigated include oxidation of 1&#8901;thf by silver triflimidate, AgNTf2, to afford a monohydride [Mo2(&#956;&#8208;H)(&#956;&#8208;NTf2)(&#956;&#8208;AdDipp2)2] (4), with an O,O&#8217;&#8208;bridging triflimidate ligand.

         <title>Directing Polymorphism in the Helical Nanofilament Phase</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Morphogenesis control: the morphogenesis of the helical nanofilament (HNF) liquid&#8208;crystal phase was controlled to give structures that depend on the growth conditions. Two different growth methods were used to investigate the polymorphism of HNFs: nanoconfinement and light&#8208;driven orientation. This is apparently the first report on the polymorphism of an HNF phase formed by single kind of molecules.







Abstract
Herein, it is reported that the polymorphism in the helical nanofilament (HNF, B4) liquid&#8208;crystalline phase depends on the fabrication methods, that is, UV&#8208;driven formation and template&#8208;assisted self&#8208;assembly in the nanoconfined geometry. As a result, uniaxially oriented HNFs with different helical structures were obtained, in which generation of the twisted&#8208;ribbon and cylindrical&#8208;ribbon polymorphs showed that even the molecular lattice has a different orientation. The detailed structures were directly observed by SEM and grazing&#8208;incidence X&#8208;ray diffraction with synchrotron radiation. The resultant polymorphs could be used in chiro&#8208;optical applications due to the capability for fine control of the helical structures.

Tri&#8208; and difluoromethylation/cyclization/indole oxidative cleavage: An unprecedented electrochemical tri&#8208; and difluoromethylation/cyclization/indole oxidative cleavage process has been established in an undivided cell. The protocol employs a readily prepared Langlois reagent as the fluoroalkyl source, affording a series of tri&#8208; or difluoromethylated 2&#8208;(2&#8208;acetylphenyl)isoquinoline&#8208;1,3&#8208;diones in good yields with excellent stereoselectivity.







Abstract
Considering their unique roles in organic synthesis, and pharmaceutical and agrochemical applications, the development of fluoroalkylation, cyclization, and indole oxidative cleavage are important topics. Herein, an unprecedented electrochemical tri&#8208; and difluoromethylation/cyclization/indole oxidative cleavage process occurring in an undivided cell is presented. The protocol employs a readily prepared Langlois reagent as the fluoroalkyl source, affording a series of tri&#8208; or difluoromethylated 2&#8208;(2&#8208;acetylphenyl)isoquinoline&#8208;1,3&#8208;diones in good yields with excellent stereoselectivity. It is worth noting that this new methodology merges the fluoroalkylation/cyclization of N&#8208;substituted acrylamide alkenes with the oxidative cleavage of an indole C(2)=C(3) bond under external oxidant&#8208;free conditions.

         <title>Conformational Dependence of Triplet Energies in Rotationally Hindered N&#8208; and S&#8208;Heterocyclic Dimers: New Design and Measurement Rules for High Triplet Energy OLED Host Materials</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new series of high ET heterocyclic dimers has been synthesized with large dihedral angles enforced by steric hindrance. A meta&#8208;conjugated carbazole dimer displays the highest ET of 3.07&#8197;eV in dilute polymer film, however in a neat film this falls to 2.83&#8197;eV. Similar variation is observed across the series. This work highlights that to reliably estimate host/guest compatibility, ET determined from phosphorescence of neat films must be reported for new host materials. The currently accepted practice of reporting values from frozen solution or polymer films is no substitute.







Abstract
A series of four heterocyclic dimers has been synthesized, with twisted geometries imposed across the central linking bond by ortho&#8208;alkoxy chains. These include two isomeric bicarbazoles, a bis(dibenzothiophene&#8208;S,S&#8208;dioxide) and a bis(thioxanthene&#8208;S,S&#8208;dioxide). Spectroscopic and electrochemical methods, supported by density functional theory, have given detailed insights into how para&#8208; vs. meta&#8208; vs. broken conjugation, and electron&#8208;rich vs. electron&#8208;poor heterocycles impact the HOMO&#8211;LUMO gap and singlet and triplet energies. Crucially for applications as OLED hosts, the triplet energy (ET) of these molecules was found to vary significantly between dilute polymer films and neat films, related to conformational demands of the molecules in the solid state. One of the bicarbazole species shows a variation in ET of 0.24&#8197;eV in the different media&#8212;sufficiently large to &#8220;make&#8208;or&#8208;break&#8221; an OLED device&#8212;with similar discrepancies found between neat films and frozen solution measurements of other previously reported OLED hosts. From consolidated optical and optoelectronic investigations of different host/dopant combinations, we identify that only the lower ET values measured in neat films give a reliable indicator of host/guest compatibility.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A new series of high&lt;/b&gt; 
&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;b&gt;E&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;b&gt;T&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt; heterocyclic dimers has been synthesized with large dihedral angles enforced by steric hindrance. A &lt;i&gt;meta&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;conjugated carbazole dimer displays the highest &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt; of 3.07&#8197;eV in dilute polymer film, however in a neat film this falls to 2.83&#8197;eV. Similar variation is observed across the series. This work highlights that to reliably estimate host/guest compatibility, &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt; determined from phosphorescence of neat films must be reported for new host materials. The currently accepted practice of reporting values from frozen solution or polymer films is no substitute.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A series of four heterocyclic dimers has been synthesized, with twisted geometries imposed across the central linking bond by &lt;i&gt;ortho&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;alkoxy chains. These include two isomeric bicarbazoles, a bis(dibenzothiophene&#8208;&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;dioxide) and a bis(thioxanthene&#8208;&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;dioxide). Spectroscopic and electrochemical methods, supported by density functional theory, have given detailed insights into how &lt;i&gt;para&lt;/i&gt;&#8208; vs. &lt;i&gt;meta&lt;/i&gt;&#8208; vs. broken conjugation, and electron&#8208;rich vs. electron&#8208;poor heterocycles impact the HOMO&#8211;LUMO gap and singlet and triplet energies. Crucially for applications as OLED hosts, the triplet energy (&lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt;) of these molecules was found to vary significantly between dilute polymer films and neat films, related to conformational demands of the molecules in the solid state. One of the bicarbazole species shows a variation in &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt; of 0.24&#8197;eV in the different media&#8212;sufficiently large to &#8220;make&#8208;or&#8208;break&#8221; an OLED device&#8212;with similar discrepancies found between neat films and frozen solution measurements of other previously reported OLED hosts. From consolidated optical and optoelectronic investigations of different host/dopant combinations, we identify that only the lower &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt; values measured in neat films give a reliable indicator of host/guest compatibility. This work also provides new molecular design rules for obtaining very high &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt; materials and controlling their HOMO and LUMO energies.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Fluorescence Response and Self&#8208;Assembly of a Tweezer&#8208;Type Synthetic Receptor Triggered by Complexation with Heme and Its Catabolites</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
At a pinch: A tweezer&#8208;type synthetic receptor bearing sulfo&#8208;Cy5 as a hydrophilic fluorophore exhibits a significant fluorescence response upon host&#8211;guest complexation with heme in aqueous solution at pH&#8197;7.4. The complex acquires a supramolecular amphiphilic character that facilitates the formation of self&#8208;assembled aggregates. Fluorescence responses of the receptor to heme catabolites and other biologically relevant molecules were also evaluated.







Abstract
There is increasing interest in the development and applications of synthetic receptors that recognize target biomolecules in aqueous media. We have developed a new tweezer&#8208;type synthetic receptor that gives a significant fluorescence response upon complexation with heme in aqueous solution at pH&#8197;7.4. The synthetic receptor consists of a tweezer&#8208;type heme recognition site and sulfo&#8208;Cy5 as a hydrophilic fluorophore. The receptor&#8211;heme complex exhibits a supramolecular amphiphilic character that facilitates the formation of self&#8208;assembled aggregates, and both the tweezer moiety and the sulfo&#8208;Cy5 moiety are important for this property. The synthetic receptor also exhibits significant fluorescence responses to biliverdin and bilirubin, but shows very weak fluorescence responses to flavin mononucleotide, folic acid, and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, which contain smaller &#960;&#8208;scaffolds.

         <title>Approaches to the Synthesis of Perfluoroalkyl&#8208;Modified Carbohydrates and Derivatives: Thiosugars, Iminosugars, and Tetrahydro(thio)pyrans</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Perfluoroalkyl&#8208;modified carbohydrates: New protocols for the direct incorporation of fluoroalkyl groups onto carbohydrate scaffolds that rely on thermal metal&#8208;mediated chemistry and photocatalysis are presented. Along with the introduction of fluoroalkyl moieties into carbohydrates, the fluorination and fluoroalkylation reactions of iminosugars, pyrans, and thiopyrans will be presented. Recent examples on the trifluoromethylthiolation of glycals are illustrated.







Abstract
Fluoroalkyl&#8208;substituted carbohydrates play relevant roles in diverse areas such as supramolecular chemistry, glycoconjugation, liquid crystals, and surfactants, with direct applications as wetting, antifreeze, and coating agents. In light of these promising applications, new methodologies for the late&#8208;stage incorporation of fluoroalkyl RF groups into carbohydrates and derivatives are herein presented as they are relevant to the synthetic carbohydrate community. Previously reviewed protocols for the installation of RF groups onto carbohydrates and derivatives will be succinctly summarized in the light of the new achievements. Fluoroalkyl&#8208;substituted iminosugars, on the other hand, are also interesting glycomimetic derivatives with prominent roles as glycosidases and glycosyltransferases inhibitors, as has recently been demonstrated. Also, they positively contribute to the study of sugar&#8211;protein interactions and enzyme mechanisms. New advances in the syntheses of fluoroalkyl&#8208;substituted iminosugars will also be presented here.

         <title>A Guide to Directing Group Removal: 8&#8208;Aminoquinoline</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Obstinate auxiliaries: How can directing groups be removed after successful C&#8722;H activation or transition metal&#8208;catalyzed functionalization? This Review discusses different strategies for 8&#8208;aminoquinoline removal to access a wide variety of products. Challenges and limitations are highlighted and alternative approaches are suggested to provide a comprehensive end&#8208;users&#8217; guide to directing group removal.







Abstract
The use of directing groups allows high levels of selectivity to be achieved in transition metal&#8208;catalyzed transformations. Efficient removal of these auxiliaries after successful functionalization, however, can be very challenging. This review provides a critical overview of strategies used for removal of Daugulis&#8217; 8&#8208;aminoquinoline (2005&#8211;2020), one of the most widely used N,N&#8208;bidentate directing groups. The limitations of these strategies are discussed and alternative approaches are suggested for challenging substrates. Our aim is to provide a comprehensive end&#8208;users&#8217; guide for chemists in academia and industry who want to harness the synthetic power of directing groups&#8212;and be able to remove them from their final products.

Magnesium and p&#8208;block metallocenes: The synthesis and structures of diphosphanylmetallocenes of s&#8208; and p&#8208;block elements are described, including the first group&#8197;15 diphosphanylmetallocene. Their application as ligands in coordination chemistry was demonstrated for different metal fragments and the reactivity of a magnesocene towards small molecules was investigated.







Abstract
Several 1,1&#8242;&#8208;diphosphanyl&#8208;substituted metallocenes of magnesium (magnesocenes) were synthesized, structurally characterized, and their reactivity and coordination chemistry were investigated. Transmetalation of these magnesocenes gives access to group&#8197;14 metallocenes (tetrelocenes), as well as to group 15 stibonocenes. These s&#8208; and p&#8208;block metallocenes represent a novel class of bis(phosphanyl) ligands, exhibiting Lewis&#8208;amphiphilic character. Their coordination chemistry towards different transition&#8208;metal and main&#8208;group fragments was investigated and different complexes are presented.

         <title>Accessing Lanthanide&#8208;to&#8208;Lanthanide Energy Transfer in a Family of Site&#8208;Resolved [LnIIILnIII&#8242;] Heterodimetallic Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lanthanides: A new method to prepare a large number of different heterometallic [LnLn&#8242;] dinuclear complexes is exploited for unique visible&#8208;to&#8208;near&#8208;infrared (NIR) and NIR&#8208;to&#8208;NIR energy transfer (ET) within molecules, by using the [EuYb] and [NdYb] analogues, respectively. This demonstrates intramolecular sensitisation of Yb3+ by Nd3+, which acts as an ET donor.







Abstract
The ligand H3L (6&#8208;[3&#8208;oxo&#8208;3&#8208;(2&#8208;hydroxyphenyl)propionyl]pyridine&#8208;2&#8208;carboxylic acid), which exhibits two different coordination pockets, has been exploited to engender and study energy transfer (ET) in two dinuclear [LnIIILnIII&#8242;] analogues of interest, [EuYb] and [NdYb]. Their structural and physical properties have been compared with newly synthesised analogues featuring no possible ET ([EuLu], [NdLu], and [GdYb]) and with the corresponding homometallic [EuEu] and [NdNd] analogues, which have been previously reported. Photophysical data suggest that ET between EuIII and YbIII does not occur to a significant extent, whereas emission from YbIII originates from sensitisation of the ligand. In contrast, energy migration seems to be occurring between the two NdIII centres in [NdNd], as well as in [NdYb], in which YbIII luminescence is thus, in part, sensitised by ET from Nd. This study shows the versatility of this molecular platform to further the investigation of lanthanide&#8208;to&#8208;lanthanide ET phenomena in defined molecular systems.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Lanthanides&lt;/b&gt;: A new method to prepare a large number of different heterometallic [LnLn&#8242;] dinuclear complexes is exploited for unique visible&#8208;to&#8208;near&#8208;infrared (NIR) and NIR&#8208;to&#8208;NIR energy transfer (ET) within molecules, by using the [EuYb] and [NdYb] analogues, respectively. This demonstrates intramolecular sensitisation of Yb&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; by Nd&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;, which acts as an ET donor.

&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Surprising Homolytic Gas Phase (Co&#8208;C)&#8208;Bond Dissociation Energies of Organometallic Aryl&#8208;Cobinamides Reveal Notable Non&#8208;Bonded Intramolecular Interactions</title>

         <dc:description>Aryl&#8208;cobalamins are a new class of organometallic structural mimics of vitamin B12 designed as potential &#8216;antivitamins B12&#8217;. Here, the first cationic aryl&#8208;cobinamides are described, which were synthesized using the newly developed diaryl&#8208;iodonium method. The aryl&#8208;cobinamides were obtained as pairs of organometallic coordination isomers, whose stereo&#8208;structure was unambiguously assigned based on homo&#8208; and heteronuclear NMR&#8208;spectra. The availability of isomers with axial attachment of the aryl group, either at the &#8216;beta&#8217; or at the &#8216;alpha&#8217; face of the cobalt&#8208;center allowed for an unprecedented comparison of the organometallic reactivity of such pairs. The homolytic gas&#8208;phase bond dissociation energies (BDEs) of the coordination&#8208;isomeric phenyl&#8208; and 4&#8208;ethylphenyl&#8208;cobinamides were determined by ESI&#8208;mass threshold CID experiments, furnishing (Co&#8208;Csp2)&#8208;BDEs of 38.4 and 40.6 kcal/mol, respectively, for the two b&#8208;isomers, and the larger BDEs of 46.6 and 43.8 kcal/mol for the corresponding a&#8208;isomers. Surprisingly, the observed (Co&#8208;Csp2)&#8208;BDEs of the Cob&#8208;aryl&#8208;cobinamides were smaller than the (Co&#8208;Csp3)&#8208;BDE of Cob&#8208;methyl&#8208;cobinamide. DFT&#8208;studies and the magnitudes of the experimental (Co&#8208;Csp2)&#8208;BDE revealed relevant contributions of non&#8208;bonded interactions in aryl&#8208;cobinamides, notably steric strain between the aryl and the cobalt&#8208;corrin moieties and non&#8208;bonded interactions with and among the peripheral sidechains.</dc:description>

         <title>Directed Assembly of Multi&#8208;Walled Nanotubes and Nanoribbons of Amino Acid Amphiphiles Using a Layer&#8208;by&#8208;Layer Approach</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Monodisperse unilamellar nanotubes (NTs) and nanoribbons (NRs) were transformed to multilamellar NRs and NTs in a well&#8208;defined fashion. This was done by using a step&#8208;wise approach in which self&#8208;assembled cationic amino acid amphiphile (AAA) forms the initial NTs or NRs, and added polyanion produces an intermediate coating. Successive addition of cationic AAA forms a covering AAA layer, and by repeating this layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer (LBL) procedure, multi&#8208;walled AAA (MWAAA) NTs and NRs are formed. This process was structurally investigated by combining small&#8208;angle neutron scattering (SANS) and cryogenic&#8208;transmission electron microscopy (cryo&#8208;TEM), confirming the multilamellar structure and the precise layer spacing. In this way we demonstrate the controlled formation of MWAAA suprastructures in a simple and reproducible fashion, which allows to control the charge on the surface of these 1D aggregates. This pathway to 1D colloidal materials is interesting for applications in life science and creating well&#8208;defined building blocks in nanotechnology.</dc:description>

         <title>Mononuclear Dysprosium Alkoxide and Aryloxide Single&#8208;Molecule Magnets</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Recent studies have shown that mononuclear lanthanide (Ln) complexes can be high&#8208;performing single&#8208;molecule magnets (SMMs). Recently, there has been an influx of mononuclear Ln alkoxide and aryloxide SMMs, which have provided the necessary geometrical control to improve SMM properties and to allow the intricate relaxation dynamics of Ln SMMs to be studied in detail. Here we review non&#8208;aqueous Ln alkoxide and aryloxide chemistry applied to the synthesis of low&#8208;coordinate mononuclear Ln SMMs. We focus on mononuclear Dy(III) alkoxide and aryloxide SMMs with coordination numbers up to eight, covering synthesis, solid state structures and magnetic attributes. Brief overviews are also provided of mononuclear Dy(III) siloxide SMMs as heavier analogues, and complementary Tb(III), Ho(III), Er(III) and Yb(III) alkoxide and aryloxide SMMs.</dc:description>

         <title>Co&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Intramolecular [3+2] Cycloaddition of Yne&#8208;Alkylidenecyclopropanes and Reaction Mechanism</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing new transition&#8208;metal catalyzed asymmetric cycloadditions for the synthesis of five&#8208;membered carbocycles (FMCs) is a research frontier in reaction development, due to the ubiquitous presence of chiral FMCs in various functional molecules. Reported here is our discovery of a highly enantioselective intramolecular [3+2] cycloaddition of yne&#8208; alkylidenecyclopropanes (yne&#8208;ACPs) to both bicyclo[3.3.0]octa&#8208;dienes and bicyclo[4.3.0]nonadienes molecules, by using cheap Co catalyst and commercially available chiral ligand (S)&#8208;Xyl&#8208;BINAP. This reaction avoids the use of precious Pd and Rh catalysts which are usually the choices for ACPs&#8217; [3+2] reactions. The ee values in the present reaction can be up to 92%. Cationic cobalt (I) species was suggested by experiments as the catalytic species. DFT calculations showed that this [3+2] reaction starts with oxidative cyclometallation of alkyne and ACP, followed by ring opening of the cyclopropyl (CP) group and reductive elimination to form the cycloadduct. This mechanism is different from previous [3+2] reactions of ACPs, which usually start from CP cleavage, not from oxidative cyclization.</dc:description>

         <title>Recent Advances in the Synthesis of Glycodendrimers with Antiviral and Antibacterial Activity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Glycodendrimers are an important class of synthetic macromolecules that can be used to mimic many structural and functional features of cell surface glycoconjugates. Their carbohydrate moieties perform key important functions in bacterial and viral infections, often regulated by carbohydrate&#8211;protein interactions. Several studies have shown that the molecular structure, the valency and spatial organization of carbohydrate epitopes in glycoconjugates are key factors in the specificity and avidity of carbohydrate&#8208;protein interactions. Choosing the right glycodendrimers almost always helps to interfere in such interactions and blocks bacteria o viral adhesion or entry into host cells as an effective strategy to inhibit bacterial or viral infections. In this review, we describe the state of the art in the design and synthesis of glycodendrimers employed for the development of anti&#8208;adhesion therapy against bacterial and viral infections.Glycodendrimers are an important class of synthetic macromolecules that can be used to mimic many structural and functional features of cell surface glycoconjugates.

Choosing the right glycodendrimers almost always helps to interfere in such interactions and blocks bacteria o viral adhesion or entry into host cells as an effective strategy to inhibit bacterial or viral infections. In this review, we describe the state of the art in the design and synthesis of glycodendrimers employed for the development of anti&#8208;adhesion therapy against bacterial and viral infections.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Additive&#8208;free Aqueous Dispersions of Two&#8208;Dimensional Materials&#160;with Glial Cell Compatibility and Enzymatic&#160;Degradability</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Water&#8208;dispersible two&#8208;dimensional (2D) materials are desirable for diverse applications. Aqueous dispersions make processing safer and greener, and enable evaluation of these materials on biological and environmental fronts. To evaluate the effects of 2D materials with biological systems, obtaining dispersions without additives is critical and has been a challenge. Herein, we developed a method for obtaining additive&#8208;free aqueous dispersions of 2D materials like transition metal dichalcogenides and hexagonal boron nitride (h&#8208;BN). The nanosheet dispersions are investigated through spectroscopic and microscopic methods, along with the role of size on stability. The aqueous media enabled investigations on cytocompatibility and enzymatic degradation of molybdenum disulphide (MoS  2  ) and h&#8208;BN. Cytocompatibility with mixed glial cells is observed up to concentrations of 100 &#956;g ml  &#8208;1  , suggesting their plausible usage in bioelectronics. Besides, biodegradation using human myeloperoxidase (hMPO) mediated catalysis is investigated through Raman spectroscopy and electron microscopy. The findings suggest that additive&#8208;free 2H&#8208;MoS  2  and h&#8208;BN are degradable by hMPO, with 2H&#8208;phase exhibiting better resistance to degradation than the 1T&#8208;phase, while h&#8208;BN exhibits slower degradation. The findings pave a path for incorporating 2D materials in the burgeoning field of transient bioelectronics.</dc:description>

         <title>Tunable Light Emission Properties of Solution&#8208;Processable N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene Cyclometalated Gold(III) Complexes for Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) cyclometalated gold(III) complexes remain very scarce and therefore their photophysical properties remain currently underexplored. Moreover, gold(III) complexes emitting in the blue region of the electromagnetic spectrum are rare. In this work, a series of four phosphorescent gold(III) complexes were investigated bearing four different NHC monocyclometalated (C^C*)&#8208;type ligands and a dianionic (N^N)&#8208;type ancillary ligand ((N^N) = 5,5&#8217;&#8208;(propane&#8208;2,2&#8208;diyl)bis(3&#8208;(trifluoromethyl)&#8208;1H&#8208;pyrazole) (mepzH2)). The complexes exhibit strong phosphorescence when doped in poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) at room temperature, which were systematically tuned from sky&#8208;blue [&#955;PL = 456 nm, CIE coordinates: (0.20, 034)] to green [&#955;PL = 516 nm, CIE coordinates: (0.31, 0.54)] by varying the monocyclometalated (C^C*) ligand framework. The complexes revealed high quantum efficiencies (&#981;PL) of up to 43% and excited&#8208;state lifetimes (&#964;0) between 15&#8211;266 &#956;s. The radiative rate constant values found for these complexes (kr = 103&#8211;104 s&#8211;1) are the highest found in comparison to previously known best performing monocyclometalated gold(III) complexes. Density functional theory (DFT) and time&#8208;dependent DFT (TD&#8208;DFT) calculations of these complexes further lend support to the excited state nature of these complexes.&#160;Additionally, organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) were fabricated using solution&#8208;process to provide the first insight into the electroluminescent (EL) properties of this new class of gold(III) complexes.</dc:description>

         <title>Experimental and Theoretical Investigation on Structural and Opto&#8208;electronic Properties of Fe&#8208;Doped Lead&#8208;Free Cs2AgBiCl6 Double Perovskite</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we report the synthesis of Fe&#8208;doped Cs2AgBiCl6 lead&#8208;free double perovskite with blue emission using an antisolvent method. The crystal structure, morphology, optical properties, band structure, and stability of Fe&#8208;doped double perovskites are investigated systematically. Formation of Fe&#8208;doped Cs2AgBiCl6 double perovskite is confirmed by XRD and XPS analysis. XRD and TGA shows that the Cs2AgBiCl6 double perovskite has high structural and thermal stability, respectively. FE&#8208;SEM analysis revealed the formation of dipyramidal shape Cs2AgBiCl6 crystals. Furthermore, EDS mapping shows the overlapping of Cs, Bi, Ag, Fe, and Cl elements and homogenous incorporation of Fe in Cs2AgBiCl6 double perovskite. The Fe&#8208;doped Cs2AgBiCl6 double perovskite shows a strong absorption at 380 nm. It extends up to 700 nm, suggesting that sub&#8208;bandgap states transition may originate from the surface defect of the doped perovskite material. The radiative kinetics of the crystals was studied using the TCSPC technique. Lattice parameters and band gap value Fe&#8208;doped Cs2AgBiCl6 double perovskites predicted by the DFT calculations are confirmed by XRD and UV&#8208;Visible spectroscopy analysis. Time&#8208;dependent photo&#8208;response characteristics for Fe&#8208;doped Cs2AgBiCl6 double perovskite show fast response and recovery time of charge carriers. We believe that the successful incorporation of Fe in lead&#8208;free, environmentally friendly Cs2AgBiCl6 double perovskite can open a new class of doped double perovskites with significant potential opto&#8208;electronics applications, photocatalysts, and photovoltaics.</dc:description>

         <title>Hydrogenation of secondary amides using phosphane oxide and frustrated Lewis pair catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The metal&#8208;free catalytic hydrogenation of secondary carboxylic acid amides is developed. The reduction is realized by two new catalytic reactions. First, the amide is converted into the imidoyl chloride by triphosgene (CO(OCCl3)2) using novel phosphorus(V) catalysts. Second, the in situ generated imidoyl chlorides are hydrogenated in high yields by an FLP&#8208;catalyst. Mechanistic and quantum mechanical calculations support an autoinduced catalytic cycle for the hydrogenation with chloride acting as unusual Lewis base for FLP&#8208;mediated H2&#8208;activation.</dc:description>

         <title>Temperature dependence of 1 H paramagnetic chemical shifts in actinide complexes, beyond Bleaney&#8217;s theory. The AnVIO22+ &#8722; DPA complexes (An = Np, Pu) as an example.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Actinide +VI complexes (An VI = U VI , Np VI and Pu VI ) with

dipicolinic acid derivatives were synthesized and characterized by

powder XRD, SQUID magnetometry and NMR spectroscopy. In

addition, Np VI and Pu VI complexes were described by first principles

CAS based and two&#8208;component spin&#8208;restricted DFT methods. The

analysis of the 1 H paramagnetic NMR chemical shifts for all protons

of the ligands according to the X&#8208;rays structures shows that the

Fermi contact contribution is negligible. The magnetic susceptibility

tensor is determined by combining SQUID, pNMR shifts and Evans&#8217;

method. The SO&#8208;RASPT2 results fit well the experimental magnetic

susceptibility and pNMR chemical shifts. The role of the counterions

in the solid phase is pointed out; their presence impacts the magnetic

properties of the Np VI complex. The temperature dependence of the

pNMR chemical shifts has a strong 1 &#8260; T contribution, contrarily to

Bleaney&#8217;s theory for lanthanide complexes. The fitting of the

temperature dependence of the pNMR chemical shifts and SQUID

magnetic susceptibility by a two&#8208;Kramers&#8208;doublet model for the Np VI

complex and a non&#8208;Kramers&#8208;doublet model for the Pu VI complex

         <title>Carbon Origami via Alumina Assisted Cyclodehydrofluorination Algorithm</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Strategy for the synthesis of pristine non&#8208;planar nanographenes (NGs) via cyclodehydrofluorination algorithm is reported and creation of highly strained systems via alumina&#8208;assisted C&#8208;F bond activation is shown. Steric hindrance could execute an alternative coupling program leading to rare octagon formation, that opens an access to the elusive non&#8208;classical NGs. The combination of two alternative ways of folding could lead to the formation of various 3D NG objects, resembling the Japanese art &#8211; origami. The power of the presented &#8220;origami&#8221; approach is proved by the assembly of 12 challenging nanographenes that are p&#8208;isoelectronic to planar hexabenzocoronene but forced out of planarity.</dc:description>
