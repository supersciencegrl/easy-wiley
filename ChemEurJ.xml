         <title>DNA Molecular Glue Assisted Bacterial Conjugative Transfer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Bacterial conjugation, a commonly used method to horizontally transfer functional genes from donor to recipient strains, plays an important role in the genetic manipulation of bacteria for basic research and industrial production. Successful conjugation depends on the donor&#8208;recipient cell recognition and a tight mating junction formation. However, the efficiency of conjugative transfer is usually very low. In this work, we developed a new technique that employed DNA molecule &#8220;glue&#8221; to increase the match frequency and the interaction stability between the donor and recipient cells. We used two&#160;E. coli&#160;strains, ETZ and BL21, as a model system, and modified them with the complementary ssDNA oligonucleotides by click chemistry. The conjugation efficiency of the modified bacteria was improved more than 4 times from 10% to 46%. This technique is simple and generalizable as it only relies on the active amino groups on the bacterial surface. It is expected to have broad applications in constructing&#160;engineered bacteria.</dc:description>

         <title>Construction of Boron Difluoride Complexes with Asymmetric N,N&#8217;&#8208;Bidentate Ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Boron difluoride (BF2) complexes with asymmetrical N,N&#8217;&#8208;bidentate ligands have received increasing attention due to their fascinating properties and broad applications. They are generally constructed in two steps: ligand formation, followed by boron complexation. This review focuses on categorizing these BF2 complexes based on the key synthetic strategies that have been applied in the ligand formation steps. The post&#8208;functionalization, properties and applications of different types of BF2 complexes are presented. Their challenges and opportunities are also discussed. This should help the future rational design and synthesis of BF2 complexes with intriguing properties and practical applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis and Application of Robust Spiro [Fluorene&#8209;9] CAAC Ruthenium Alkylidene Complexes for the &#8222;One&#8208;Pot&#8220; Conversion of Allyl Acetate to Butane&#8208;1,4&#8208;diol</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A series of a novel CAAC ligands featuring a spiro&#8208;fluorene group have been synthesized and complexed with ruthenium alkylidenes, yielding the corresponding Hoveyda&#8208;type derivatives as a new family of olefin metathesis catalysts. The novel complexes have been characterized by XRD, HRMS and NMR measurements. The synthetized complexes were tested in catalysis and showed good activity in olefin metathesis, as demonstrated on diethyl diallylmalonate and allyl acetate substrates. The unique backbone in the ligand system with the large, yet inflexible condensed system renders interesting properties to the catalyst, exemplified by the good catalytic performance and improved&#160;Z&#8209;selectivity. In addition, the complex can also serve as a hydrogenation catalyst in a consecutive (one&#8208;pot) reaction. The latter reaction can convert allyl acetate to butane&#8209;1,4&#8209;diol, a valuable chemical intermediate for biodegradable polybutylene succinate (PBS).</dc:description>

         <title>Engineering applications of solar photocatalysis &amp; photothermal catalysis for hydrogen production from biomass:A review</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Biomass photoreforming is a promising way of producing sustainable hydrogen thanks to the abundant sources of biomass feedstocks. Solar energy provides the heat and driven force to initial biomass oxidation coupled with H2 evolution. Currently, biomass photoreforming is still far from plant&#8208;scale applications due to the lower solar energy utilization efficiencies, the low H2 yield, and the lack of appropriate photoreactors. The production of H2 from photoreforming of native biomass and platform molecules was summarized and discussed with special attention to the prospects of scaling up the catalysis technology for mass production of hydrogen. The types of photoreforming including photocatalysis and photothermal catalysis were discussed consequently considering the different requirements for photoreactors. We also reviewed the photoreactors that support biomass photoreforming. Numerical simulation methods were implemented for the solid&#8208;liquid two&#8208;phase flow and inter&#8208;particle radiative transfer involved in the reaction process. Developing concentrated photothermal catalytic flowed reactors is beneficial to scale&#8208;up catalytic hydrogen production from biomass.</dc:description>

Owing to the presence of AIE and photochromic moiety, the molecule exhibits emissive aggregates, photochromism, and acidochromism. The multiple stimuli sensitive behavior of the molecule was explored for anti&#8208;counterfeiting behavior on TLC plate and commercial banknotes.

         <title>Host&#8208;Guest Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Click Chemistry</title>

         <dc:description>
Stimuli&#8208;responsive click chemistry implements molecular switches within host&#8208;guest complexes, allowing non&#8208;covalent ligation of molecular fragments and external stimulation of bound/unbound constitutional states. With selected examples, we show that these supramolecular systems are ideal candidates for stimuli&#8208;controlled molecular conjugation, thereby advancing efforts towards a more function&#8208;oriented chemical synthesis.







Abstract
Click chemistry has reached its maturity as the weapon of choice for the irreversible ligation of molecular fragments, with over 20&#8197;years of research resulting in the development or improvement of highly efficient kinetically controlled conjugation reactions. Nevertheless, traditional click reactions can be disadvantageous not only in terms of efficiency (side products, slow kinetics, air/water tolerance, etc.), but also because they completely avoid the possibility to reversibly produce and control bound/unbound states. Recently, non&#8208;covalent click chemistry has appeared as a more efficient alternative, in particular by using host&#8208;guest self&#8208;assembled systems of high thermodynamic stability and kinetic lability. This review discusses the implementation of molecular switches in the development of such non&#8208;covalent ligation processes, resulting in what we have termed stimuli&#8208;responsive click chemistry, in which the bound/unbound constitutional states of the system can be favored by external stimulation, in particular using host&#8208;guest complexes. As we exemplify with handpicked selected examples, these supramolecular systems are well suited for the development of human&#8208;controlled molecular conjugation, by coupling thermodynamically regulated processes with appropriate temporally resolved extrinsic control mechanisms, thus mimicking nature and advancing our efforts to develop a more function&#8208;oriented chemical synthesis.

         <title>Fagopyrins from Buckwheat Flowers: Structural and Stereochemical Characterization Through Combined NMR/CD Spectroscopy and Theoretical Calculations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 33, June 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
For the first time, nine fagopyrin isomers have been structurally characterized and their stereochemistry fully elucidated by integrated 1H&#8208;NMR and CD spectroscopy studies. The presence of two different heterocyclic ring substituents, two stereogenic centers and the inherent axial chirality of the aromatic system provides a complex stereochemical relationships among isomers, giving account of the high level of molecular multiplicity.







Abstract
Fagopyrins are phenantroperylenequinones present in the flowers of Fagopyrum esculentum (buckwheat) endowed with photodynamic activity. It has been reported that fagopyrin extracts actually contain a complex mixture of closely related compounds, differing only on the nature of the perylenequinone substituents. We report our systematic and detailed study on the chemical composition of fagopyrin extracts by a combination of preparative and analytical techniques. The combined use of 1H&#8208;NMR and CD spectroscopy was found to be particularly suited to fully characterize all stereochemical aspects of the extracted fagopyrins. For the first time nine isomers have been structurally characterized and their stereochemistry fully elucidated. The presence of two different heterocyclic ring substituents, two stereogenic centers and the inherent axial chirality of the aromatic system provides a complex stereochemical relationships among isomers, thus giving account of the high level of molecular multiplicity found in the extract.

         <title>External Electric Field Control of Exciton Motion in Porphyrin&#8208;Based Metal Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 33, June 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Porphyrins excel as light&#8208;harvesting complexes, but their unsuitability for photovoltaics stems from poor transport properties causing significant exciton loss. While arranging them in surface&#8208;anchored metal&#8208;organic frameworks (PP&#8208;SURMOFs) aids charge carrier dissociation, it doesn&#8242;t notably enhance conductivity. To address this, we propose guiding exciton diffusion indirectly with an external electric field. Fields as low as 0.1&#8197;V&#8201;nm&#8722;1 induce a Stark effect, reducing band gaps in PP&#8208;SURMOFs. Applied as a gradient, this creates a unidirectional hopping pathway, potentially reducing exciton diffusion lengths and enhancing their utility in photovoltaic and photocatalytic applications.







Abstract
Porphyrins are excellent light&#8208;harvesting complexes. Presently they are unsuitable for photovoltaic applications, as their excellent light absorbance is compensated to a large extent by their poor transport properties, where most excitons are lost by recombination. Arranging porphyrins in regular, strongly bound, lattices of surface&#8208;anchored metal&#8208;organic frameworks (PP&#8208;SURMOFs) may facilitate charge carrier dissociation, but does not significantly enhance the conductive properties. In most cases, photogenerated excitons traverse undirected, Brownian motion through a hopping process, resulting in a substantial diffusion length to reach electrodes, leading to significant exciton loss through recombination. Here, we propose to guide exciton diffusion indirectly by an external electric field. We show that electric fields, even as strong as 1&#8197;V&#8201;nm&#8722;1, do not affect the HOMO&#8208;LUMO gap of the porphyrins. However, fields of 0.1&#8197;V&#8201;nm&#8722;1 and even less demonstrate a notable Stark effect, with slight band gap reductions, for some PP&#8208;SURMOFs. When applied as an electric field gradient, for instance, via the substrate, it creates a unidirectional hopping pathway for the excitons. Consequently, we expect a significant reduction of exciton diffusion length leading to increased utilization of photogenerated excitons as they reach the electrodes. This strategy holds promise for integrating photoactive molecules in photovoltaic and photocatalytic applications.

         <title>Theoretical Study of the Ternary Compound Monolayer CuP2Se for Photocatalytic Water Splitting with Efficient Optical Absorption</title>

The variation of energy change of uphill and downhill in the right panels indicate the endothermic and exothermic reactions, respectively.







Abstract
Utilizing photocatalytic method to produce hydrogen by splitting water is an efficient strategy to solve the hotspot issues of energy crisis and environmental pollution. Herein, we systematically investigate the corresponding properties of the reported Cu&#8208;bearing ternary compound monolayer CuP2Se by using the first&#8208;principle calculations. The monolayer CuP2Se has quite small cleavage energy of 0.51&#8197;J/m2, indicating it can be easily produced by the mechanical exfoliation method experimentally. In addition, it is an indirect bandgap semiconductor material which has a moderate value of 1.91&#8197;eV. The conduction band minimum (CBM) and valence band maximum (VBM) can perfectly straddle the redox potentials of water when a biaxial strain of &#8722;4% to 4% is applied, unveiling the high photocatalytic thermodynamic stability of monolayer CuP2Se in response to the effect of solvent tension. Remarkably, the monolayer CuP2Se also demonstrates significant sunlight capturing ability in the visible region. The outstanding electronic and optical properties suggest that the monolayer CuP2Se is undoubtedly a viable material for photocatalytic water splitting.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Responsive Gradient Structured Actuator via Photopolymerization&#8208;Induced Diffusion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 33, June 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A method has been developed for the fabrication of gradient&#8208;structured actuators with cross&#8208;link variation by using two distinct photoinitiator systems to selectively trigger thiol&#8208;ene polymerization and acrylate homopolymerization. The gradient&#8208;structured actuator undergoes bending deformation in both air and solvent environments, and can be controlled by carefully tailoring the photopolymerization conditions.







Abstract
Stimuli&#8208;responsive materials have recently gained significant attention in the field of soft robotics, sensors, and biomimetic devices. The most facile way for the fabrication of such materials remains to endow bilayer structures which are fabricated with the combination of active and passive layers. Although, easily fabricated, these structures suffer from the generation of stress points between connection areas. In this work we develop a method to create a thin film with controlled cross&#8208;link variation across its thickness. The cross&#8208;link gradient is achieved through polymerization induced diffusion of dithiol molecules in thiol&#8208;ene network. As a result, the film exhibits bending deformation upon illumination with light or exposure to a chemical solvent, thereby demonstrating dual responsiveness. Light actuation of the film is achieved via photothermal effects due to the incorporation of dye into the system which can absorb UV light and heat the network. While solvent induced actuation is due to anisotropic swelling. Furthermore, the straightforward fabrication procedure allows for the creation of more complex deformations by patterning the film using a photomask during photopolymerization.

         <title>Improving the Stability and Kinetic Inertness of Mn(II) Complexes by Increasing the Bridge Length in Bicyclic CDTA&#8208;Like Ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 33, June 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bicyclic trans&#8208;diaminotetraacetate ligands were synthesized to form paramagnetic Mn(II) complexes with improved kinetic inertness for application as MRI contrast agents. The length of the alkyl bridge on the cyclohexane ring was varied from methylene (BCH&#8208;DTA), ethylene (BCO&#8208;DTA) to propylene (BCN&#8208;DTA) to evaluate the influence of the different structures on the relaxometric properties, thermodynamic stability and kinetic inertness of the Mn(II) complexes.







Abstract
Kinetic inertness of Mn(II)&#8208;based MRI contrast agents can be improved by increasing the rigidity of the polydentate ligand that tightly coordinate the metal ion. Taking inspiration from the remarkable increase in kinetic inertness of [Mn(CDTA)]2&#8722; compared to [Mn(EDTA)]2&#8722; due to the cyclohexyl backbone rigidity, we devised that bicyclic ligands would further improve the kinetic inertness of the Mn(II) complexes. The length of the alkyl bridge on the cyclohexane ring was varied from methylene (BCH&#8208;DTA), ethylene (BCO&#8208;DTA) to propylene (BCN&#8208;DTA) to evaluate the influence of the different trans&#8208;diaminotetraacetate ligands on relaxometric, thermodynamic and kinetic properties of the Mn(II) complexes. 1H and 17O&#8197;NMR relaxometric studies showed a slight increase in relaxivity and a faster water exchange rate in these Mn(II)&#8208;complexes with respect to [Mn(CDTA)]2&#8722;.

&lt;p&gt;Bicyclic &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;-diaminotetraacetate ligands were synthesized to form paramagnetic Mn(II) complexes with improved kinetic inertness for application as MRI contrast agents. The length of the alkyl bridge on the cyclohexane ring was varied from methylene (BCH-DTA), ethylene (BCO-DTA) to propylene (BCN-DTA) to evaluate the influence of the different structures on the relaxometric properties, thermodynamic stability and kinetic inertness of the Mn(II) complexes.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kinetic inertness of Mn(II)-based MRI contrast agents can be improved by increasing the rigidity of the polydentate ligand that tightly coordinate the metal ion. Taking inspiration from the remarkable increase in kinetic inertness of [Mn(CDTA)]&lt;sup&gt;2&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; compared to [Mn(EDTA)]&lt;sup&gt;2&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; due to the cyclohexyl backbone rigidity, we devised that bicyclic ligands would further improve the kinetic inertness of the Mn(II) complexes. The length of the alkyl bridge on the cyclohexane ring was varied from methylene (BCH-DTA), ethylene (BCO-DTA) to propylene (BCN-DTA) to evaluate the influence of the different &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;-diaminotetraacetate ligands on relaxometric, thermodynamic and kinetic properties of the Mn(II) complexes. &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H and &lt;sup&gt;17&lt;/sup&gt;O&#8197;NMR relaxometric studies showed a slight increase in relaxivity and a faster water exchange rate in these Mn(II)-complexes with respect to [Mn(CDTA)]&lt;sup&gt;2&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;. Solution studies revealed that the conditional stability (pMn) and dissociation half-life (&lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;1/2&lt;/sub&gt;) at pH&#8197;7.4 follow the order [Mn(BCH-DTA)]&lt;sup&gt;2&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;lt;[Mn(BCO-DTA)]&lt;sup&gt;2&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;lt;[Mn(BCN-DTA)]&lt;sup&gt;2&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; highlighting the effect of the bridge length on the overall stability of the Mn(II) complexes. Remarkably, [Mn(BCN-DTA)]&lt;sup&gt;2&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; shows an improved pMn value and a 7-times higher kinetic inertness than [Mn(CDTA)]&lt;sup&gt;2&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;.

         <title>Linear, Planar, Orbicular, and Macrocyclic Multinuclear Zinc (Meth)acrylate Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 33, June 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The diverse structures of zinc (meth)acrylate are present herein. The linear polymeric structure consisting of dinuclear repeating units of zinc (meth)acrylate is converted to a Zn4 cluster upon treating with ZnO. Recrystallization of zinc acrylate from a hydrous solvent affords a sheet&#8208;like structure consisting of Zn5 repeating units bridged by two &#956;3&#8208;OH, whereas zinc methacrylate affords a cyclic Zn12 structure supported by methacrylato ligands.







Abstract
Zinc carboxylate complexes are widely utilized as artificial models of metalloenzymes and as secondary building units of PCPs/MOFs. However, the relationship between the structure of the monodentate carboxylato ligand and the molecular arrangement of multinuclear zinc carboxylate complexes is not fully understood because of the coordination flexibility of the Zn ion and carboxylato ligands. Herein, we report the structural analysis of a series of complexes derived from zinc (meth)acrylate which has a linear infinite chain structure. The molecular structure of &#956;4&#8208;oxido&#8208;bridged tetranuclear complexes [Zn4(&#956;4&#8208;O)(OCOR)6] revealed a distorted Zn4O core. Crystallization of zinc acrylate under aqueous conditions afforded a &#956;3&#8208;hydroxido&#8208;containing pentanuclear complex [Zn5(&#956;3&#8208;OH)2(OCOR)8] as the repeating unit of an infinite sheet&#8208;like structure in the solid state. It was also obtained by the hydrolysis of the &#956;4&#8208;oxido&#8208;bridged tetranuclear complex. In sharp contrast, the methacrylate analog retained the methacrylato ligands under aqueous crystallization conditions to form a macrocyclic dodecanuclear complex with methacrylato as the sole ligand.

         <title>Chemoselective Post&#8208;Synthesis Modification of Pyridyl&#8208;Substituted, Aromatic Phosphorus Heterocycles: Cationic Ligands for Coordination Chemistry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 33, June 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pyridyl&#8208;functionalized triazaphospholes provide the possibility for a post&#8208;synthesis modification, affording a variety of mono&#8208; and dicationic species. This is achieved by a chemoselective and stepwise alkylation exclusively of the nitrogen atoms and can be controlled by the choice and by the stoichiometry of the used electrophile. This targeted synthesis opens up a fascinating coordination chemistry.







Abstract
Triazaphospholes are potential polydentate ligands due to the presence of both phosphorus and nitrogen donor atoms within the aromatic 5&#8208;membered heterocycle. The incorporation of an additional pyridyl&#8208;substituent opens up the possibility of a post&#8208;synthesis modification via chemoselective and also stepwise alkylation exclusively of the nitrogen atoms. This can be controlled by the choice and by the stoichiometry of the electrophile and allows the targeted synthesis of a variety of novel mono&#8208; and dicationic ligands. Reaction with Cu(I)&#8208;halides causes the formation of cuprates of the type [CuXn](n&#8722;1)&#8722;, which enables coordination of the &#960;&#8208;acidic phosphorus donor to the negatively charged metal core, which is favored over the coordination by a strongly &#963;&#8208;donating nitrogen atom. The use of cationic triazaphosphole derivatives can be used as a strategy to enforce the coordination of the ligand to an electron rich metal solely via the phosphorus atom. However, there is a subtle balance between the formation of either coordination polymers or dimeric structures, as the substitution pattern on the heterocycle and the nature of the halide have a large influence on the coordination motifs formed.

The synthesis of AlPDA&#8208;53&#8208;DEF, AlPDA&#8208;53&#8208;H, and AlPDA&#8208;68 with insights into Aluminum Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks (Al&#8208;MOFs), their defect structures, lattice rearrangement, and the role of defects and disorders in the transformation from AlPDA&#8208;53&#8208;DEF to AlPDA&#8208;53&#8208;H.







Abstract
The transition from disorder to order and structural transformation are distinctive metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) features. How to adapt or control both behaviors in MOF has rarely been studied. In this case, we demonstrate that our successful synthesis of [Al(OH)(PDA)]n (AlPDA&#8208;53&#8208;DEF, AlPDA&#8208;53&#8208;H, and AlPDA&#8208;68) with H2PDA=4,4&#8242;&#8208;[1,4&#8208;phenylenebis(ethyne&#8208;2,1&#8208;diyl)]&#8208;di benzoic acid has shown the intricate world of Aluminum Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks (Al&#8208;MOFs). It offers profound insights into defect structures to order and transformations. AlPDA&#8208;53&#8208;DEF, in particular, revealed a fascinating interplay of various pore sizes within both micro and mesoporous regions, unveiling a unique lattice rearrangement phenomenon upon solvent desorption. Defects and disorders emerged as crucial impacts of transforming AlPDA&#8208;53&#8208;DEF, with its initially imperfect crystallinity, into the highly crystalline, hierarchically porous AlPDA&#8208;53&#8208;H.

         <title>Elucidating the Binding Mode of Sulfur&#8208; and Selenium&#8208;Based Cationic Chalcogen&#8208;Bond Donors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 33, June 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The noncovalent interaction modes of 2&#8208;chalcogeno&#8208;imidazolium salts have been studied in the solid state, in solution by DOSY, NMR titration and activation experiments, as well as in silico. A combined anion&#8208;&#960; /chalcogen bonding interaction mode prevails for most compounds. For the tellurium derivatives, the pure chalcogen bonding gains in importance, while hydrogen bonding becomes more relevant for the sulfur analogs.

For a comparison of the interaction modes of various chalcogen&#8208;bond donors, 2&#8208;chalcogeno&#8208;imidazolium salts have been designed, synthesized, and studied by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, solution NMR and DFT as well as for their ability to act as activators in an SN1&#8208;type substitution reaction. Their interaction modes in solution were elucidated based on NMR diffusion and chemical shift perturbation experiments, which were supported by DFT&#8208;calculations. Our finding is that going from lighter to the heavier chalcogens, hydrogen bonding plays a less, while chalcogen bonding an increasingly important role for the coordination of anions. Anion&#8208;&#960; interactions also show importance, especially for the sulfur and selenium derivatives.

         <title>Highly Efficient and Thermally Durable Luminescence of 1D Eu3+ Coordination Polymers with Arsenic Bridging Ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 33, June 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Luminescent Eu3+ coordination polymers bridged by bisarsine oxides exhibited intense emission even at 550&#8197;K. In addition, they showed heating&#8208;induced emission enhancement when heated from 300&#8197;K to 400&#8197;K.







Abstract
In this work, bisarsine oxides were evaluated as novel bridging ligands, aiming to develop practical and efficient luminescent lanthanide coordination polymers. We have synthesized one&#8208;dimensional (1D) Eu3+ coordination polymers that incorporate bisarsine oxide bridging ligands and hexafluoroacetylacetonate anions. These polymers exhibited a denser packing of chains compared to analogous polymers bridged with bisphosphine oxides. The coordination polymers demonstrated exceptional thermal stability and substantial emission quantum yields. Additionally, the bisarsine oxides induced a pronounced polarization effect, facilitating a sensitive electric dipole transition that yields considerably narrow band red emission. Remarkably, the Eu3+ coordination polymers with bisarsine oxides maintained intense emission even at 550&#8197;K. A distinctive feature of these polymers is their heating&#8208;induced emission enhancement observed when the temperature was increased from 300&#8197;K to 400&#8197;K.

         <title>A Fluorination Strategy and Low&#8208;Acidity Anchoring Group in Self&#8208;Assembled Molecules for Efficient and Stable Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 33, June 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two self&#8208;assembled hole transport materials with low acidity anchoring group, benzoic acid, and a fluorination strategy have been developed. With the new hole transport materials, high&#8208;performance PSCs were fabricated with high&#8208;quality perovskite layer and excellent interfacial contacts, and a champion PCE of 20.32&#8201;% was achieved with remarkably enhanced stability.







Abstract
Herein, we synthesized two donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;A) type small organic molecules with self&#8208;assembly properties, namely MPA&#8208;BT&#8208;BA and MPA&#8208;2FBT&#8208;BA, both containing a low acidity anchoring group, benzoic acid. After systematically investigation, it is found that, with the fluorination, the MPA&#8208;2FBT&#8208;BA demonstrates a lower highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy level, higher hole mobility, higher hydrophobicity and stronger interaction with the perovskite layer than that of MPA&#8208;BT&#8208;BA. As a result, the device based&#8208;on MPA&#8208;2FBT&#8208;BA displays a better crystallization and morphology of perovskite layer with larger grain size and less non&#8208;radiative recombination. Consequently, the device using MPA&#8208;2FBT&#8208;BA as hole transport material achieved the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 20.32&#8201;% and remarkable stability. After being kept in an N2 glove box for 116&#8197;days, the unsealed PSCs&#8217; device retained 93&#8201;% of its initial PCE. Even exposed to air with a relative humidity range of 30&#177;5&#8201;% for 43&#8197;days, its PCE remained above 91&#8201;% of its initial condition. This study highlights the vital importance of the fluorination strategy combined with a low acidity anchoring group in SAMs, offering a pathway to achieve efficient and stable PSCs.

         <title>Photoreduction of Trifluoromethyl Group: Lithium Ion Assisted Fluoride&#8208;Coupled Electron Transfer from EDA Complex</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 33, June 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have developed an electron&#8208;donor&#8208;acceptor complex mediated single&#8208;electron transfer of &#945;,&#945;,&#945;&#8208;trifluoromethyl arenes in the presence of lithium salt to give &#945;,&#945;&#8208;difluoroalkylarenes. The C&#8722;F bond reduction was realized by lithium iodide and triethylamine, two common feedstock reagents. Computational studies indicated that the lithium&#8208;assisted defluorination and the single&#8208;electron reduction occurred concertedly. We call this phenomenon fluoride&#8208;coupled electron transfer (FCET).







Abstract
Photoinduced single&#8208;electron reduction is an efficient method for the mono&#8208;selective activation of the C&#8722;F bond on a trifluoromethyl group to construct a difluoroalkyl group. We have developed an electron&#8208;donor&#8208;acceptor (EDA) complex mediated single&#8208;electron transfer (EDA&#8208;SET) of &#945;,&#945;,&#945;&#8208;trifluoromethyl arenes in the presence of lithium salt to give &#945;,&#945;&#8208;difluoroalkylarenes. The C&#8722;F bond reduction was realized by lithium iodide and triethylamine, two common feedstock reagents. Mechanistic studies revealed the generation of a &#945;,&#945;&#8208;difluoromethyl radical by single&#8208;electron reduction and defluorination, followed by the radical addition to alkenes. Lithium salt interacted with the fluorine atom to promote the photoinduced reduction mediated by the EDA complex. Computational studies indicated that the lithium&#8208;assisted defluorination and the single&#8208;electron reduction occurred concertedly. We call this phenomenon fluoride&#8208;coupled electron transfer (FCET). FCET is a novel approach to C&#8722;F bond activation for the synthesis of organofluorine compounds.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Photoinduced single-electron reduction is an efficient method for the mono-selective activation of the C&#8722;F bond on a trifluoromethyl group to construct a difluoroalkyl group. We have developed an electron-donor-acceptor (EDA) complex mediated single-electron transfer (EDA-SET) of &#945;,&#945;,&#945;-trifluoromethyl arenes in the presence of lithium salt to give &#945;,&#945;-difluoroalkylarenes. The C&#8722;F bond reduction was realized by lithium iodide and triethylamine, two common feedstock reagents. Mechanistic studies revealed the generation of a &#945;,&#945;-difluoromethyl radical by single-electron reduction and defluorination, followed by the radical addition to alkenes. Lithium salt interacted with the fluorine atom to promote the photoinduced reduction mediated by the EDA complex. Computational studies indicated that the lithium-assisted defluorination and the single-electron reduction occurred concertedly. We call this phenomenon fluoride-coupled electron transfer (FCET). FCET is a novel approach to C&#8722;F bond activation for the synthesis of organofluorine compounds.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Luminescent Supramolecular Metallogels: Drug Loading and Eu(III) as Structural Probe</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 33, June 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Eu(III) is combined with iminodiacetic acid to create luminescent hydrogels, with tunable rheological properties. Utilizing Eu(III) luminescence as a structural probe, we propose molecular structures for the materials. We also assess their capacity for loading bioactive molecules. This research could inspire luminescent hydrogel development for optical and biomedical materials, leveraging Eu(III) luminescence for advanced material characterization.







Abstract
Supramolecular metallogels combine the rheological properties of gels with the color, magnetism, and other properties of metal ions. Lanthanide ions such as Eu(III) can be valuable components of metallogels due to their fascinating luminescence. In this work, we combine Eu(III) and iminodiacetic acid (IDA) into luminescent hydrogels. We investigate the tailoring of the rheological properties of these gels by changes in their metal:ligand ratio. Further, we use the highly sensitive Eu(III) luminescence to obtain information about the chemical structure of the materials. In special, we take advantage of computational calculations to employ an indirect method for structural elucidation, in which the simulated luminescent properties of candidate structures are matched to the experimental data. With this strategy, we can propose molecular structures for different EuIDA gels. We also explore the usage of these gels for the loading of bioactive molecules such as OXA, observing that its aldose reductase activity remains present in the gel. We envision that the findings from this work could inspire the development of luminescent hydrogels with tunable rheology for applications such as 3D printing and imaging&#8208;guided drug delivery platforms. Finally, Eu(III) emission&#8208;based structural elucidation could be a powerful tool in the characterization of advanced materials.

We have established a convenient method for the synthesis of 2&#8208;aryl&#8208;3H&#8208;1,3&#8208;benzazaphosphole oxides, which exhibit the characteristic optical properties reflecting the electronic effects of the &#946; nitrogen atom. The ortho&#8208;hydroxyphenyl derivative underwent ESIPT in solution to emit considerably Stokes&#8208;shifted fluorescence in the range of 600&#8211;800&#8197;nm.







Abstract
Inclusion of a heteroatom to the phosphole ring is a promising strategy to intrinsically modulate the optical properties of phosphole derivatives. We report on a series of 2&#8208;aryl&#8208;3H&#8208;1,3&#8208;benzazaphosphole oxides that were efficiently prepared via sequential C&#8722;P cross&#8208;coupling, dehydrative [3+2] cycloaddition, and ring&#8208;oxidation reactions. The inclusion of one nitrogen atom into the benzophosphole framework caused red shifting of the absorption and emission maxima, reflecting the greater stabilization of the LUMO level. 2&#8208;(2&#8208;Hydroxyphenyl)benzazaphosphole oxide underwent excited state intramolecular proton transfer and emitted a weak fluorescence from the excited state of the N&#8722;H tautomer.

         <title>Silver(i) Perfluoroalcoholates: Synthesis, Structure, and their Use as Transfer Reagents</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 33, June 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Degradable fluorinated groups are an opportunity for the future, as ECHA is considering the regulation of persistent PFAS in the coming years. Therefore, the OCF3 group is emerging as a degradable group for a variety of applications, while higher perfluoroalkoxy groups are still of interest for agrochemicals or pharmaceuticals. The silver(I) perfluoroalcoholates can provide valuable reagents for incorporation into organic molecules.







Abstract
Herein we report a general access to silver(i) perfluoroalcoholates, their structure in the solid state and in solution, and their use as transfer reagents. The silver(i) perfluoroalcoholates are prepared by the reaction of AgF with the corresponding perfluorinated carbonyl compounds in acetonitrile and are stable for a prolonged time at &#8722;18&#8201;&#176;C. X&#8208;ray analysis of single crystals of perfluoroalcoholate species showed that two Ag(i) centers are bridged by the alcoholate ligands. In acetonitrile solution, Ag[OCF3] forms different structures as indicated by IR spectroscopy. Furthermore, the silver(i) perfluoroalcoholates can be used as easy&#8208;to&#8208;handle transfer reagents for the synthesis of Cu[OCF3], Cu[OC2F5], [PPh4][Au(CF3)3(OCF3)], and fluorinated alkyl ethers.

         <dc:description>
A de&#8197;novo approach to synthesize d&#8208;bradyrhizose diastereomers from an achiral ketoenolester is presented. The strategy uses transfer hydrogenation, an Achmatowicz rearrangement and alkene oxidations as key steps in the synthesis. The effect of the configuration at C&#8208;2, C&#8208;4 and C&#8208;9 on the isomeric composition of the reducing sugars in water was analyzed and compared with the natural product.







Abstract
A de&#8197;novo asymmetric strategy for the synthesis of d&#8208;bradyrhizose diastereomers from an achiral ketoenolester precursor is described. Key transformations used in the stereodivergent approach include two Noyori asymmetric reductions, an Achmatowicz rearrangement, diastereoselective alkene oxidations, and the first example of a palladium(0)&#8208;catalyzed glycosylation of a vinylogous pyranone. The isomeric composition of the bicyclic reducing sugars obtained was analyzed and their behaviour was compared to the natural product, revealing key stereocentres that impact the overall distribution.

         <title>Regioselective Synthesis of Hamilton&#8208;Receptor&#8208;Fullerene Oligo&#8208;Adducts for the Supramolecular Binding of Cyanuric Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 33, June 12, 2024. </description>

This work presents a new concept for the regioselective synthesis of Hamilton&#8208;receptor and cyanurate functionalized fullerene oligo&#8208;adducts. Based on an in&#8208;situ deprotection and click&#8208;post&#8208;functionalization approach up to twelve Hamilton&#8208;receptor/cyanurate moieties were attached to a suitable fullerene C60&#8208;based hexakis&#8208;adduct precursor. The versatility of this approach was further demonstrated by synthesis of Hamilton&#8208;receptor/cyanurate functionalized mono&#8208;adducts, which were unobtainable by direct Bingel cyclopropanation.







Abstract
A new concept for the regioselective synthesis of Hamilton&#8208;receptor and cyanurate&#8208;functionalized oligo adducts of the fullerene C60 was developed. Based on an in&#8208;situ deprotection and click&#8208;post&#8208;functionalization approach with novel azido precursors, the corresponding fullerene hexakis&#8208;adducts with octahedral addition patterns and up to twelve Hamilton&#8208;receptor/cyanurate moieties surrounding the fullerene sphere were synthesized. The versatility of this approach was further demonstrated by the synthesis of Hamilton&#8208;receptor/cyanurate functionalized fullerene mono&#8208;adducts, which are not accessible by direct cyclopropanation. Several fullerene target compounds were purified by simple washing procedures of the solid crude reaction mixture without the need for chromatography. The resulting fullerene mono&#8208; and hexakis&#8208;adducts were fully characterized and their supramolecular properties were investigated by NMR&#8208;spectroscopy and isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC).

         <title>Total Chemical Synthesis of Aggregation&#8208;Prone Disulfide&#8208;Rich Starfish Peptides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 33, June 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents a comprehensive synthetic strategy for creating relaxin&#8208;like peptides characterized by a two&#8208;chain structure linked by three disulfide bonds. Utilizing Fmoc solid&#8208;phase peptide synthesis, the A&#8208; and B&#8208;chains are independently assembled with orthogonal cysteine protecting groups (tBu, Acm, Trt) to facilitate the controlled formation of disulfide bonds. The synthesis proceeds through four key steps: (i.) Oxidation of the A&#8208;chain to establish the intramolecular disulfide bond; (ii.) Conversion of Cys(tBu) to a more reactive Cys(SPyr) derivative; (iii.) Thiolysis&#8208;driven combination of A&#8208; and B&#8208;chain to form the first inter&#8208;chain disulfide bond; and (iv.) Final disulfide bond formation via iodine oxidation, culminating in the production of the fully assembled peptide.







Abstract
A relaxin&#8208;like gonad&#8208;stimulating peptide (RGP), Aso&#8208;RGP, featuring six cysteine residues, was identified in the Crown&#8208;of&#8208;Thorns Starfish (COTS, Acanthaster cf. solaris) and initially produced through recombinant yeast expression. This method yielded a single&#8208;chain peptide with an uncleaved C&#8208;peptide (His Tag) and suboptimal purity. Our objective was to chemically synthesize Aso&#8208;RGP in its mature form, comprising two chains (A and B) and three disulfide bridges, omitting the C&#8208;peptide. Furthermore, we aimed to synthesize a newly identified relaxin&#8208;like peptide, Aso&#8208;RLP2, from COTS, which had not been previously synthesized. This paper reports the first total chemical synthesis of Aso&#8208;RGP and Aso&#8208;RLP2. Aso&#8208;RGP synthesis proceeded without major issues, whereas the A&#8208;chain of Aso&#8208;RLP2, in its reduced and unfolded state with two free thiols, presented considerable challenges. These were initially marked by &#8220;messy&#8221; RP&#8208;HPLC profiles, typically indicative of synthesis failure. Surprisingly, oxidizing the A&#8208;chain significantly improved the RP&#8208;HPLC profile, revealing the main issue was not synthesis failure but the peptide's aggregation tendency, which initially obscured analysis. This discovery highlights the critical need to account for aggregation in peptide synthesis and analysis. Ultimately, our efforts led to the successful synthesis of both peptides with purities exceeding 95&#8201;%.

         <title>Insight into the MOtBu (M=Na, K)&#8208;Mediated Dehydrogenation of Dimethylamine&#8208;Borane and Transfer Hydrogenation of Nitriles to Primary Amines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 33, June 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A practical, operationally simple, and efficient protocol for the NaOtBu&#8208;mediated transfer hydrogenation of nitriles to the corresponding primary amines with a relatively unexplored sacrificial hydrogen source (dimethylamine borane) is reported. The reaction encompasses a broad substrate scope and furnishes good&#8208;to&#8208;excellent yields of the primary amines under solvent&#8208;free conditions.







Abstract
Selective synthesis of primary amines from nitriles is challenging in synthetic chemistry due to the possible en&#8208;route generation of various amines and imines. Herein, we report a practical and operationally simple MOtBu&#8208;mediated (M=Na, K) transfer hydrogenation of nitriles to the corresponding primary amines with a relatively unexplored sacrificial hydrogen source (dimethylamine borane). The strategy encompasses a broad substrate scope under transition metal&#8208;free conditions and does not require any solvent. The mechanistic investigation was performed with the aid of control experiments and spectroscopic studies. The GC analysis of the reaction mixture exhibited the evolution of the H2 gas. Additionally, detailed computational calculations were undertaken to shed light on the possible intermediates and transition states involved during the present protocol.

Hydrogen bonding frameworks can do it all; catalysis, selective encapsulation, and control of tautomeric state.







Abstract
Herein we report the use of tetrakis (guanidinium) pyrenetetrasulfonate (G4PYR) and bis (guanidinium) 1,5&#8208;napthalene disulfonate (G2NDS) to catalyze the cyclization of 2&#8208;cyanobenzamide (1) to isoindolone (2). Moreover, we demonstrate the remarkable selectivity of these guanidinium organosulfonate hosts in encapsulating 2 over 1. By thoroughly investigating the intramolecular cyclization reaction, we determined that guanidinium and the organosulfonate moiety acts as the catalyst in this process. Additionally, 2 is selectively encapsulated, even in mixtures of other structurally similar heterocycles like indole. Furthermore, the tautomeric state of 2 (amino isoindolone (2&#8211;A) and imino isoindolinone forms (2&#8211;I)) can be controlled by utilizing different guanidinium organosulfonate frameworks.

         <dc:description>
Hydroxylamine&#8208;mediated C(sp2)&#8722;H trifluoromethylation of terminal alkenes was developed, which shows good reactivity, impressive E/Z selectivity, and broad group compatibility. Expansion of this approach to perfluoroalkylation and late&#8208;stage trifluoromethylation demonstrates its promising applications in pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals.







Abstract
Introduction of the trifluoromethyl (CF3) group into organic compounds has garnered substantial interest because of its significant role in pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals. Here, we report a hydroxylamine&#8208;mediated radical process for C(sp2)&#8722;H trifluoromethylation of terminal alkenes. The reaction shows good reactivity, impressive E/Z selectivity (up to &gt;20&#8201;:&#8201;1), and broad functional group compatibility. Expansion of this approach to perfluoroalkylation and late&#8208;stage trifluoromethylation of bioactive molecules demonstrates its promising application potential. Mechanistic studies suggest that the reaction follows a radical addition and subsequent elimination pathway.

&lt;p&gt;Hydroxylamine-mediated C(sp&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)&#8722;H trifluoromethylation of terminal alkenes was developed, which shows good reactivity, impressive &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;Z&lt;/i&gt; selectivity, and broad group compatibility.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Introduction of the trifluoromethyl (CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) group into organic compounds has garnered substantial interest because of its significant role in pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals. Here, we report a hydroxylamine-mediated radical process for C(sp&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)&#8722;H trifluoromethylation of terminal alkenes. The reaction shows good reactivity, impressive &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;Z&lt;/i&gt; selectivity (up to &amp;gt;20&#8201;:&#8201;1), and broad functional group compatibility. Expansion of this approach to perfluoroalkylation and late-stage trifluoromethylation of bioactive molecules demonstrates its promising application potential. Mechanistic studies suggest that the reaction follows a radical addition and subsequent elimination pathway.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

The ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed oxidative annulation reaction of imidazo[1,5&#8208;a]quinolin&#8208;2&#8208;ium salts with alkynes via N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene&#8208;directed C&#8722;H activation to obtain &#960;&#8208;expanded imidazo[1,5&#8208;a]quinolin&#8208;2&#8208;ium derivatives is reported. Methodology is compatible with a wide range of substrate scope including pharmacophere containing scaffolds. Mechanistic studies and DFT calculation complement the synthetic work.







Abstract
Ruthenium(II)&#8208;catalyzed synthesis of &#960;&#8208;conjugated fused imidazo[1,5&#8208;a]quinolin&#8208;2&#8208;ium derivatives have been achieved via C&#8722;H activation of quinoline&#8208;functionalized NHC (NHC=N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene) and oxidative coupling with internal alkynes. The reaction occurred with high efficiency, broad substrate scope, tolerates a wide range of functional groups and utilized into a gram&#8208;scale. Synthetic applications of the coupled product have been exemplified in the late&#8208;stage derivatization of various highly functionalized scaffolds. Moreover, most of the annulated products exhibit intense fluorescence and have potential applications in optoelectronic devices. Mechanistic studies have provided insights into the spectroscopic characterization of key five&#8208;membered ruthenacycle intermediate and Ru(0) sandwich species. Based on several control experiments, deuterium&#8208;kinetic isotope effect, and thermodynamic activation parameters the mechanistic finding demonstrated that fused imidazo&#8208;[1,5&#8208;a]quinolin&#8208;2&#8208;ium C(2)&#8722;H bond cleavage is the rate&#8208;determining step and ruling out the possibility of reductive elimination for controlling the rate of reaction.

         <title>Smartphone&#8208;Based Sensing of Cortisol by Functionalized Rhodamine Probes</title>

Cortisol detection by optical Strip Test, based on fluorescent rhodamine probes properly functionalized to interact by non&#8208;covalent interactions with cortisol, is here described. Furthermore, we used a smartphone as detector, obtaining a prototype for the monitoring cortisol levels in real life.







Abstract
During a stress condition, the human body synthesizes catecholamine neurotransmitters and specific hormones (called &#8220;stress hormones&#8221;), the most important of which is cortisol. The monitoring of cortisol levels should be extremely important to control the stress levels, and for this reason, it shows important medical applications. The common analytical methods (HPLC, GC&#8208;MS) cannot be used in real life, due to the bulky size of the instruments and the necessity of specialized personnel. Molecular probes solve these problems due to their fast and easy use. The synthesis of new fluorescent rhodamine probes, able to interact by non&#8208;covalent interactions with cortisol, the recognition properties in solution as well as in solid state by Strip Test, using a smartphone as detector, are here reported. DFT calculations and FT&#8208;IR measurements suggest the formation of supramolecular complexes through hydrogen bonds as main non&#8208;covalent interaction. The present study represents one of the first sensor, based on synthetical chemical receptors, able to detect cortisol in a linear range from 1&#8197;mM to 1&#8197;pM, based on non&#8208;covalent molecular recognition and paves the way to the realization of practical point&#8208;of&#8208;care device for the monitoring of cortisol in real live.

Diborylalkenes are useful building blocks for the synthesis of pharmaceuticals and organic materials. We demonstrate a metal&#8208;free phosphine&#8208;catalyzed cis&#8208;diboration of 1,3&#8208;diynes with B2pin2 to afford cis&#8208;diboryl&#8208;1,3&#8208;enynes in good yields with high regio&#8208; and stereo&#8208;selectivity (up to 96&#8201;% yield and &gt;99&#8201;:&#8201;1 Z/E selectivity). The diboration product can be conveniently transformed into densely functionalized 1,3&#8208;enynes.







Abstract
Trialkyl phosphines PMe3 and PEt3 catalyze the 1,2&#8208;cis&#8208;diboration of 1,3&#8208;butadiynes to give 1,2&#8208;diboryl enynes. The products were utilized to synthesize 1,1,2,4&#8208;tetraaryl enynes using a Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura protocol and can readily undergo proto&#8208;deborylation.

         <dc:description>
A gradient structured film has been fabricated through photopolymerization&#8208;induced diffusion. First, illumination with low&#8208;intensity UV light initiates the thiol&#8208;ene reaction only at the surface, and this triggers the diffusion of thiol molecules to the surface. Then, illumination with blue light initiates chain&#8208;growth acrylate homopolymerization, which arrests the spatial gradient of crosslink density. Due to its gradient structure, the film exhibits bending actuation both in air and solvent. More information can be found in the Research Article by D. Liu and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202400515).

Just as a station is the starting point of a journey and each person has their own destination, different shapes of complexes can be obtained starting from zinc (meth)acrylate. The recrystallization of zinc methacrylate from THF and water afforded a macrocyclic dodecanuclear complex, whereas that of zinc acrylate formed a sheet&#8208;like pentanuclear core with hydroxido ligands. The treatment of zinc (meth)acrylate with ZnO led to tetranuclear complex with oxido ligand. More information can be found in the Research Article by T. Iwasaki, K. Nozaki and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202400586).

The implementation of molecular switches within host&#8211;guest complexes allows the noncovalent ligation of molecular fragments, resulting in what E. Pazos, M.&#8197;D. Garc&#237;a, and co&#8208;workers have termed stimuli&#8208;responsive click chemistry. Their Concept article (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202400743) shows that these supramolecular systems are ideal candidates for controlling molecular conjugation on demand, opening up new possibilities towards a more function&#8208;oriented chemical synthesis.

         <title>Challenges in the Synthesis and Processing of Hydrosilanes as Precursors for Silicon Deposition</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 33, June 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Liquid hydrosilanes are required for the production of silicon films. The silicon layers can be processed for electronic devices like transistors or thin&#8208;film solar cells. Hydrosilanes are highly reactive and pyrophoric. Therefore, the synthesis of these compounds is challenging and dangerous. The available synthesis methods for hydrosilanes are reviewed and compared.







Abstract
Hydrosilanes are highly attractive compounds, which can be processed as liquids with printing technology to amorphous silicon films on nearly any solid substrate. The silicon layers can be processed for electronic devices like transistors or thin&#8208;film solar cells. The endothermic character of hydrosilanes with their positive enthalpies of formation results in favorable properties for processing. The larger the molecules, the lower their decomposition temperature and the higher their photoactivity. Cyclic hydrosilanes such as cyclopentasilane and cyclohexasilane can be easily deposited. The branched neopentasilane is more difficult to deposit but yields better&#8208;quality films after processing. The key challenge is the complex synthesis of the precursors and the hydrosilanes. The available preparative methods are presented in this review and their advantages and disadvantages are evaluated. The following synthesis methods are presented and discussed in this article: Wurtz coupling and other reductive coupling processes, dehydrogenative coupling of silanes, plasma synthesis of chlorinated polysilanes, amine&#8208; or chloride&#8208;induced disproportionations, and transformation of monosilane to higher silanes. Plasma synthesis is already carried out today as a continuous industrial process. The most effective synthesis methods in the laboratory are currently amine&#8208; and chloride&#8208;induced disproportionations. There is a great need to further optimize the syntheses of hydrosilanes and to develop new simple synthesis variants.

         <title>Strategies for Using Quaternary Ammonium Salts as Alternative Reagents in Alkylations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 33, June 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review outlines strategies for using quaternary ammonium salts (QAS) as alternative and solid reagents in alkylation reactions, enabling safer chemical synthesis methods for researchers. Unlike traditional reagents, which entail notable health and safety hazards, QAS present a safer alternative, being non&#8208;carcinogenic, non&#8208;mutagenic, non&#8208;flammable, and non&#8208;corrosive.







Abstract
Alkylation reactions are pivotal in organic chemistry, with wide&#8208;ranging utilization across various fields of applied synthetic chemistry. However, conventional reagents employed in alkylations often pose substantial health and exposure risks. Quaternary ammonium salts (QAS) present a promising alternative for these transformations offering significantly reduced hazards as they are non&#8208;cancerogenic, non&#8208;mutagenic, non&#8208;flammable, and non&#8208;corrosive. Despite their potential, their use in direct organic transformations remains relatively unexplored. This review outlines strategies for utilizing QAS as alternative reagents in alkylation reactions, providing researchers with safer approaches to chemical synthesis.

         <dc:description>
This review article classifies the title compounds into families that differ in the position(s) of the donor group(s) D on the corresponding amidinatotetrylene moiety (E=Si, Ge, Sn), schematically presents the structures of the members of each family, and describes the synthetic approaches utilized for their preparation and their use as ligands in transition metal&#8208;catalysed reactions.







Abstract
This review article focuses on amidinatotetrylenes that potentially can (or have already shown to) behave as bi&#8208; or tridentate ligands because they contain at least one amidinatotetrylene moiety (silylene, germylene or stannylene) and one (or more) additional coordinable fragment(s). Currently, they are being widely used as ligands in coordination chemistry, small molecule activation and catalysis. This review classifies those that have been isolated as transition metal&#8208;free compounds into five families that differ in the position(s) of the donor group(s) (D) on the amidinatotetrylene moiety, namely: ED{R1NC(R2)NR1}, EX{DNC(R2)NR1}, EX{R1NC(D)NR1}, EX{DNC(R2)ND} and E{R1NC(R2)ND}2 (E=Si, Ge or Sn). Those that do not exist as transition metal&#8208;free compounds but have been observed as ligands in transition metal complexes are cyclometallated and ring&#8208;opened amidinatotetrylene ligands. This article presents schematic descriptions of their structures, the approaches used for their syntheses and a quick overview of their involvement (as ligands) in transition metal&#8208;catalysed reactions. The literature is covered up to the end of 2023.

Near&#8208;infrared&#8208;II (NIR&#8208;II) imaging, combined with activatable materials responsive to tumor microenvironments or external stimulation, reduces tissue scattering, allows deeper tissue penetration and enhances imaging resolution, thus improving tumor diagnosis and treatment. This review outlines recent advances in activatable NIR&#8208;II photodiagnosis and phototherapy, as well as addresses clinical hurdles and strategies for NIR&#8208;II phototherapy.







Abstract
Near&#8208;Infrared&#8208;II (NIR&#8208;II) spans wavelengths between 1,000 to 1,700 nanometers, featuring deep tissue penetration and reduced tissue scattering and absorption characteristics, providing robust support for cancer treatment and tumor imaging research. This review explores the utilization of activatable NIR&#8208;II photodiagnosis and phototherapy based on tumor microenvironments (e.&#8201;g., reactive oxygen species, pH, glutathione, hypoxia) and external stimulation (e.&#8201;g., laser, ultrasound, photothermal) for precise tumor treatment and imaging. Special emphasis is placed on the advancements and advantages of activatable NIR&#8208;II nanomedicines in novel therapeutic modalities like photodynamic therapy, photothermal therapy, and photoacoustic imaging. This encompasses achieving deep tumor penetration, real&#8208;time monitoring of the treatment process, and obtaining high&#8208;resolution, high signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio images even at low material concentrations. Lastly, from a clinical perspective, the challenges faced by activatable NIR&#8208;II phototherapy are discussed, alongside potential strategies to overcome these hurdles.

         <title>Oxygen Promoted On&#8208;Surface Synthesis of Polyboroxine Molecules</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We present our findings on the on&#8208;surface synthesis of polyboroxine molecules derived from boroxine molecules precursors. This process is promoted by oxygen species present on the Au(111) surface: oxygen atoms facilitate the detachment of naphthalene units of trinaphthyl&#8208;boroxine molecules and bridge two unsaturated boroxine centers to form a boroxine&#8208;O&#8208;boroxine chemical motif. X&#8208;ray spectroscopic characterization shows that, as the synthesis process proceeds, it progressively tunes the electronic properties of the interface, thus providing a promising route to control the electron level alignment. .</dc:description>

         <title>Defect Engineering in Bi&#8208;based Photo/electrocatalysts for Nitrogen Reduction to Ammonia</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this review, the categories, construction strategies and advanced characterization techniques of defect engineering in current Bi&#8208;based NRR catalysts are summarized, and the main challenges and opportunities for the future development of defective Bi&#8208;based NRR catalysts are discussed, providing a comprehensive theoretical guidance for this field.







Abstract
Main group Bi&#8208;based materials have gained popularity as N2 reduction reaction (NRR) photo/electrocatalysts due to their ability to inhibit competitive H2 evolution reactions (HER) and the unique N2 adsorption activities. The introduction of defects in Bi&#8208;based catalysts represents a highly effective strategy for enhancing light absorption, promoting efficient separation of photogenerated carriers, optimizing the activity of free radicals, regulating electronic structure, and improving catalytic performance. In this review, we outline the various applications of state of the defect engineering in Bi&#8208;based catalysts and elucidate the impact of vacancies on NRR performance. In particular, the types of defects, methods of defects tailoring, advanced characterization techniques, as well as the Bi&#8208;based catalysts with abundant defects and their corresponding catalytic behavior in NRR were elucidated in detail. Finally, the main challenges and opportunities for future development of defective Bi&#8208;based NRR catalysts are discussed, which provides a comprehensive theoretical guidance for this field.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The prodigious employment of fossil fuels to conquer the global energy demand is becoming a dreadful threat to the human society.

With this interest, we have fabricated a ternary heterostructure of Ti3C2 nanosheet modified g&#8208;C3N4/Bi2O3 (MCNRBO) Z&#8208;scheme photocatalyst through self&#8208;assembly process.

The potential of MCNRBO towards photocatalytic application was investigated by H2O2 and H2 evolution reaction. A superior photocatalytic H2O2 and H2 production rate for MCNRBO is observed, which are respectively around 5 and 18 folds higher as compared to pristine CNR nanorod. The present work encourages for the development of a noble, eco&#8208;benign and immensely efficient dual heterojunction based photocatalyst, which can acts as saviour of human society from energy crisis.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis, Characterization and Energetic Properties of Hydroxymethyl&#8208;Bishomocubanone Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The present work reports synthesis, characterization and theoretical insights on novel hydroxymethyl&#8208;bishomocubanone derivatives. Twelve new bishomocubanes (BHCs) were synthesized and fully characterized by various spectroscopic techniques and single&#160;crystal X&#8208;ray analysis. The densities of the title compounds were found in the range of 1.34&#8208;1.59 g/cm3. Density&#8208;functional theory (DFT) based calculations at B3LYP/6&#8208;311++G(d,p) level of theory were performed on &#160;ten selected BHC based cage compounds. Propulsive and ballistic properties of newly synthesized hydroxymethyl&#8208;bishomocubanone derivatives in solid and liquid propulsion systems were calculated, and the results suggested that these compounds are superior to conventional fuel RP1 and binder HTPB. The detonation parameters revealed that these compounds are not explosive in nature and safe to use as solid propellants. Furthermore, kinetic and thermal stabilities of the title compounds were determined by HOMO&#8208;LUMO energy gap, ESP maps, impact sensitivity (h50) and bond dissociation energies (BDEs) followed by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential thermogravimetry analysis (DTA). Three compounds, a dinitroazide (Isp,vac= 310.98s), a dinitrate (Isp,vac = 309.51s), and a dinitronitrate (Isp,vac= 309.20s) were&#160;found to be excellent candidates for volume limited applications.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein we report that readily available 4&#8208;alkenylisocouma&#173;rins can be regarded as potent dienolate equivalents. For example, lactol silyl ethers derived from 4&#8208;alkenylisocoumarins were selectively converted to the corresponding benzo&#8208;homophthalates through a flu&#173;oride&#8208;induced ring opening step that was followed by a ring closure through a vinylogous intramolecular aldol condensation. Likewise, nu&#173;cleophilic activation of 4&#8208;alkenylisocoumarins directly yields diversely poly&#8208;substituted naphthalenes and anthracenes without formation of any regioisomer. Photophysical evaluation of a set of thus obtained 1,3&#8208;di&#8208; and 1,3,4&#8208;trisubstituted anthracenes reveals their distinct intra&#173;molecular charge transfer (ICT) character during light absorption in polar solutions and excimer emission from the solid state when a face to face &#960;&#8208;stacked molecular assembly is present in the crystal packing.</dc:description>

         <title>Studying Cation Exchange in {Cr7Co} Pseudorotaxanes: Preparatory Studies for Making Hybrid Molecular Machines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
1H NMR spectroscopy is applied to study the relative binding affinities between a {Cr7Co} macrocycle (Cr7Co=Cr7CoF8(O2CCH2tBu)16) and a series of linear alkylammonium threads. The ammonium cation is observed to exchange in solution using 1H NMR spectroscopy and kinetic studies show that the exchange takes place via a dissociative mechanism. The position of the equilibrium is dependent upon the solvent and structure of the ammonium. Collision&#8208;induced dissociation mass spectrometry (CID&#8208;MS) is used to measure the energy needed to induce 50&#8201;% of the precursor ion loss (E50). The trend in pseudorotaxane stabilities is similar when compared to the NMR trends in acetone&#8208;d6. These preliminary studies yield information which are valuable in the future design of hybrid inorganic&#8208;organic molecular machines.







Abstract
In the design of dynamic supramolecular systems used in molecular machines, it is important to understand the binding preferences between the macrocycle and stations along the thread. Here, we apply 1H NMR spectroscopy to investigate the relative stabilities of a series of linear alkylammonium templated pseudorotaxanes with the general formula [H2NRR&#8217;][Cr7CoF8(O2CCH2tBu)16] by exchanging the cation in solution. Our results show that the pseudorotaxanes are able to exchange threads via a dissociative mechanism. The position of equilibrium is dependent upon the ammonium cation and solvent used. Short chain primary ammonium cations are shown to be far less favourable macrocycle stations than secondary ammonium cations. Collision&#8208;induced dissociation mass spectrometry (CID&#8208;MS) has been used to look at disassembly of the pseudorotaxanes in a solvent&#8208;free environment and stability trends compared to those in acetone&#8208;d6. The energy needed to induce 50&#8201;% of the precursor ion loss (E50) is used and shows a similar trend to the equilibria measured by NMR. The relative stabilities of these hybrid inorganic&#8208;organic pseudo&#8208;rotaxanes are different to those of host&#8208;guest compounds involving crown ethers and this may be valuable for the design of molecular machines.

         <title>Co(II) Macrocyclic Complexes with Amide&#8208;Glycinate Pendants as ParaCEST and Liposomal CEST Agents</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Macrocyclic Co(II) complexes with appended amide&#8208;glycinate groups were prepared to develop paramagnetic Co(II) chemical exchange saturation transfer (CEST) agents of reduced overall charge. Complexes with reduced charge and lowered osmolarity are important for their loading into liposomes and to provide complexes that are highly water soluble and well tolerated in animals. Co(L1) has two non&#8208;coordinating benzyl groups and two amide&#8208;glycinate pendants, whereas Co(L2) has two unsubstituted amide pendants and two amide&#8208;glycinate pendants on cyclam (1,4,8,11&#8208;tetraazacyclododecane). The 1H NMR spectrum of Co(L1) is consistent with a single cis&#8208;pendant isomer with both amide protons in the trans&#8208;configuration, as supported by an X&#8208;ray crystal structure. Co(L2) has a mixture of different isomers in solution, including the trans&#8208;1,4 and 1,8 pendant isomers. The Z&#8208;spectrum of Co(L1) shows one highly&#8208;shifted CEST peak, whereas Co(L2) exhibits six CEST peaks. Encapsulation of 40 mM Co(L1) in a liposome with osmotically&#8208;induced shrinking at 300 mOsm/L produces a liposomal CEST agent with saturation frequency offset of 3 ppm. Addition of the amphiphilic 1,4,7&#8208;triazacyclononane&#8208;based complex Co(L5) to the liposomal bilayer at 18 mM with Co(L1) encapsulated in the liposome at 50 mM changes the sign and increases the magnitude of the saturation frequency offset to &#8208;7.5 ppm at 300 mOsm/L.</dc:description>

         <title>Pegylated Phosphine Ligands in Iridium(I) Catalyzed Hydrogen Isotope Exchange Reactions in Aqueous Buffers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthesis of a water&#8208;soluble, phosphine&#8208;pegylated iridium(I) catalyst and its application in hydrogen isotope exchange (HIE) reactions in buffer is reported. The longer polyethylene glycol side chains on the phosphine increased the water solubility independently from the pH. HIE reactions of polar substrates in protic solvents were studied. DFT calculations gave further insides into the catalytic processes.

         <title>Electronic Structure Interpretation: How much do we understand the Ce L3 XANES?</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Historically, cerium has been attractive for pharmaceutical and industrial applications. The cerium atom has the unique ability to cycle between two chemical states (Ce(III) and Ce(IV)) and drastically adjust its electronic configuration: [Xe] 4f1 5d1 6s2 in response to a chemical reaction. Understanding how electrons drive chemical reactions is an important topic. The most direct way of probing the chemical and electronic structure of materials is by X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) or X&#8208;ray absorption near&#8208;edge structure (XANES) in high energy resolution fluorescence detection (HERFD) mode. Such measurements at the Ce L3 edge have the advantage of a high penetration depth, enabling in&#8208;situ reaction studies in a time&#8208;resolved manner and investigation of material production or material performance under specific conditions. But how much do we understand Ce L3 XANES? This article provides an overview of the information that can be extracted from experimental Ce L3 XAS/XANES/HERFD data. A collection of XANES data recorded on various cerium systems in HERFD mode is presented here together with detailed discussions on data analysis and the current status of spectral interpretation, including electronic structure calculations.</dc:description>

         <title>Heterogeneous Porous Synergistic Photocatalysts for Organic Transformations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Porous materials including metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs), covalent&#8211;organic frameworks (COFs), and porous organic polymers (POPs) have recently been established as an ideal platform to enhance synergistic photocatalysis for organic transformations. Benefitting from the designability of these molecular materials, both photosensitizers and catalysts can be intricately incorporated into the porous carriers, leading to greatly enhanced performance over their homogeneous counterparts.







Abstract
Recent interest has surged in using heterogeneous carriers to boost synergistic photocatalysis for organic transformations. Heterogeneous catalysts not only facilitate synergistic enhancement of distinct catalytic centers compared to their homogeneous counterparts, but also allow for the easy recovery and reuse of catalysts. This mini&#8208;review summarizes recent advancements in developing heterogeneous carriers, including metal&#8211;organic frameworks, covalent&#8211;organic frameworks, porous organic polymers, and others, for synergistic catalytic reactions. The advantages of porous materials in heterogeneous catalysis originate from their ability to provide a high surface area, facilitate enhanced mass transport, offer a tunable chemical structure, ensure the stability of active species, and enable easy recovery and reuse of catalysts. Both photosensitizers and catalysts can be intricately incorporated into suitable porous carriers to create heterogeneous dual photocatalysts for organic transformations. Notably, experimental evidence from reported cases has shown that the catalytic efficacy of heterogeneous catalysts often surpasses that of their homogeneous analogues. This enhanced performance is attributed to the proximity and confinement effects provided by the porous nature of the carriers. It is expected that porous carriers will provide a versatile platform for integrating diverse catalysts, thus exhibiting superior performance across a range of organic transformations and appealing prospect for industrial applications.

         <title>Chemical Predictive Modelling and Natural Product&#8208;based Divergent Synthesis &#8211; Design of Type B PPAPs with Nanomolar Activities against MRSA</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In response to the pressing global challenge of antibiotic resistance, time efficient design and synthesis of novel antibiotics are of immense need. Polycyclic polyprenylated acylphloroglucinols (PPAP) were previously reported to effectively combat a range of gram&#8208;positive bacteria. Although the exact mode of action is still not clear, we conceptualized a late&#8208;stage divergent synthesis approach to expand our natural product&#8208;based PPAP library by 30 additional entities to perform SAR studies against methicillin&#8208;resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Although at this point only data from cellular assays are available and understanding of molecular drug&#8208;target interactions are lacking, the experimental data were used to generate 3D&#8208;QSAR models via an artificial intelligence training and to identify a common pharmacophore model. The experimentally validated QSAR model enabled the estimation of anti&#8208;MRSA activities of a virtual compound library consisting of more than 100.000 in&#8208;silico generated B PPAPs, out of which the 20 most promising candidates were synthesized. These novel PPAPs revealed significantly improved cellular activities against MRSA with growth inhibition down to nanomolar concentrations.</dc:description>

         <title>Chromium Complexes with Benzanellated N&#8208;heterocyclic Phosphenium Ligands &#8211; Synthesis, Reactivity and Application in Catalytic CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A chromium complex carrying two benzanellated N&#8208;heterocyclic phosphenium (bzNHP) ligands was prepared by a salt metathesis approach. Spectroscopic studies suggest that the anellation enhances the &#960;&#8208;acceptor ability of the NHP&#8208;units, which is confirmed by the facile electrochemical reduction of the complex to a spectroscopically characterized radical anion. Co&#8208;photolysis with H2 allowed extensive conversion into a &#963;&#8208;H2&#8208;complex, which shows a diverse reactivity towards donors and isomerizes under H&#8211;H bond fission and shift of a hydride to a P&#8208;ligand. The product carrying phosphenium, phosphine and hydride ligands was also synthesized independently and reacts reversibly with CO and MeCN to yield bis&#8208;phosphine complexes under concomitant Cr&#8208;to&#8208;P&#8208;shift of a hydride. In contrast, CO2 was not only bound but reduced to give an isolable formato complex, which reacted with ammonia borane under partial recovery of the metal hydride and production of formate. Further elaboration of the reactions of the chromium complexes with CO2 and NH3BH3 allowed to demonstrate the feasibility of a Cr&#8208;catalyzed transfer hydrogenation of CO2 to methanol. The various complexes described were characterized spectroscopically and in several cases by XRD studies. Further insights in reactivity patterns were provided through (spectro)electrochemical studies and DFT calculations.</dc:description>

         <title>Diastereoselective Synthesis of Sulfoxide&#8208;Functionalised N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene Ruthenium Complexes, Experimental and Computational Study.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthesis of sulfoxide&#8208;functionalized NHC ligand precursors were carried out by direct and mild oxidation from corresponding thioether precursors with high selectivity. A series of cationic [Ru(II)(&#951;6&#8208;p&#8208;cymene)(NHC&#8208;SO)Cl]+ complexes were obtained in excellent yields by the classical Ag2O transmetallation route. NMR analyses suggested a chelate structure for the metal complexes, and X&#8208;ray diffractometry studies of 4 complexes unambiguously confirmed the preference for the bidentate (&#954;2&#8208;C,S) coordination mode of the NHC&#8208;SO ligands. Interestingly, only one diastereomer, in the form of an enantiomeric pair, was observed both in 1H NMR and in the solid state for the complexes. DFT calculations showed a possible intrinsic energy difference between the two pairs of diastereomers. The calculated energy barriers&#160;suggested that inversion of the sulfoxide is only plausible from the higher energy diastereomer together with bulky substituents. Inverting the configuration at the Ru center instead shows a lower and accessible activation barrier to provide the most stable diastereomer through thermodynamic control, consistent with the observation of a single species by 1H NMR as a pair of enantiomers. All these complexes catalyse the &#946;&#8208;alkylation of secondary alcohols.</dc:description>

         <title>Silver&#8208;Catalyzed Olefination of Aryl Aldehydes Using Propiolates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Olefination of aldehydes is one of the fundamental reactions in organic synthesis. The commonly used Wittig olefination reaction however uses stoichiometric quantities reagents under basic conditions resulting in stoichiometric amounts of byproducts. Known catalytic alternate to the Wittig reaction requires stoichiometric amounts of silane reducing agents and high temperature. Herein, we report a base&#8208;free olefination of aryl aldehydes using propiolates as a surrogate for the Witting reagent under silver catalysis. Trimethyl orthoformate, in the presence of a silver catalyst adds to the alkynoate to form the nucleophilic silver allenolate which reacts with the reactive oxocarbenium ion formed from aldehyde under the reaction conditions. Subsequently decarbonylation occurs to form the olefin. Trans olefin is formed exclusively from simple aryl aldehydes and cinnamaldehydes. Such a silver allenolate is conceptually novel and has not been explored so far.</dc:description>

Known catalytic alternate to the Wittig reaction requires stoichiometric amounts of silane reducing agents and high temperature. Herein, we report a base-free olefination of aryl aldehydes using propiolates as a surrogate for the Witting reagent under silver catalysis. Trimethyl orthoformate, in the presence of a silver catalyst adds to the alkynoate to form the nucleophilic silver allenolate which reacts with the reactive oxocarbenium ion formed from aldehyde under the reaction conditions. Subsequently decarbonylation occurs to form the olefin. Trans olefin is formed exclusively from simple aryl aldehydes and cinnamaldehydes. Such a silver allenolate is conceptually novel and has not been explored so far.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Hypervalent Chalcogen Bonds Catalysis on the Intramolecular Aza&#8208;Michael Reaction of Aminochalcone: Catalytic Performance and Chalcogen Bond Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chalcogen bond (ChB) catalysis, as a new type in the field of non&#8208;covalent bond catalysis, has become a hot research topic in the field of organocatalysis in recent years. In the present work, we investigated the catalytic performance of a series of hypervalent ChB catalysis based on the intramolecular Aza&#8208;Michael reaction of aminochalcone. The reaction includes the carbon&#8208;nitrogen bond coupling step (key step) and the proton transfer step. The catalytic performance of mono&#8208;dentate pentafluorophenyl chalcogen bond donor ChB1 was comparable to that of bis&#8208;dentate chalcogen bond donor ChB4, and stronger than that of mono&#8208;dentate chalcogen bond donors ChB2 and ChB3. The formation of the chalcogen bond between the catalyst and the carbonyl oxygen atom of the reactant, causing the charge rearrangement of the reactant and C(1) charge of the &#8208;C&#8208;Ph group to become more positive, thereby the ChB catalysis promoted the nucleophile reaction. The electron density of the chalcogen bond of the pre&#8208;complex, the most positive electrostatic potentials of the catalyst, and the NPA charge of the key atom are proportional to the Gibbs energy barrier of the C&#8208;N bond coupling process, which provides an idea to predict the catalytic activity of the ChB catalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Ambiguous Faces of Water&#8208;Based Inclusion Compounds: L4(4)8(8) Intercalato&#8208;Clathrate Hydrate of Pt(II) Complex</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reported Pt(II) complex encapsulated by intercalated water layers of L4(4)8(8) topology forms intercalato&#8208;clathrate. Its comparison to similar water&#8208;based inclusion compounds allowed to suggest parameters (e.&#8201;g. h&#8208;corrugation height; Nvol&#8208; volumetric corrugation density) characterizing the corrugation of individual layers. Intra&#8208;water energies define particular water systems as confined or confining mediums.







Abstract
Clathrate hydrates are among the most intensively studied H&#8208;bond inclusion compounds. Despite the broad definition for this class of compounds, their meaning commonly refers to closed polyhedral nanocages that encapsulate small guest molecules. On the other hand, larger solutes enforce another type of encapsulation because of the solute size effect. Herein, we report a series of structures containing various molecules encapsulated by intercalated water layers constructed of polycyclic moieties of L4(4)8(8) topology. We parametrized the corrugation of individual layers and characterized interactions governing their formation. We suggested that these could be categorized as two&#8208;dimensional clathrates based on the character of intra&#8208;layer interactions and the effects observed between entrapped molecules and water&#8208;based intercalators.

         <title>Chirality Sensing of Cryptochiral Guests with Prism[n]arenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Prismarenes function as chiroptical probes for optical chirality sensing. Encapsulation of cryptochiral molecules within the cavity of prismarenes triggers ECD signals. This enables the determination of the absolute configuration of the most stable chiral host&#8208;guest complex. Additionally, the measurement of ECD band intensities facilitates the determination of the enantiomeric ratio of scalemic mixtures.







Abstract
Optical chirality sensing has gained significant attention in recent years. Within this field, the quest for stereodynamic chiroptical probes capable of detecting cryptochiral guests presents a formidable challenge. Macrocycles exhibiting planar chirality have emerged as promising candidates for amplifying the chirality of cryptochiral guests. In this study, we demonstrate that the formation of host&#8208;guest complexes between cryptochiral molecules and planar chiral prismarenes triggers electronic circular dichroism (ECD) signals via host&#8208;guest complexation&#8208;induced chirality amplification. The absolute configuration of the most stable chiral macrocyclic host&#8208;guest complex has been established by resorting to both exciton model and DFT computations. Furthermore, we demonstrated that this supramolecular chirality sensing system can be employed to determine the enantiomeric composition of scalemic mixtures by measuring the ECD bands intensity. The information described here opens the way for the use of prismarenes as stereodynamic probes for sensing of cryptochiral guests.

         <title>A Cu/MnOx Composite with Copper&#8208;Doping&#8208;Induced Oxygen Vacancies as a Cathode for Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We use a simple hydrothermal synthesis method to compound MnOx and Cu. Cu doping can cause the creation of an oxygen vacancy, which increases the material&#8216;s internal electric field and enhances cycle stability. MnOx also has great cyclic stability and promotes ion transport. At a current density of 0.2&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1, the Cu/MnOx nanocomposite obtained a high specific capacitance of 304.4&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1. In addition, Cu/MnOx nanocomposites showed A high specific capacity of 198.9&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 1000 cycles at a current density of 0.5&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1.







Abstract
Aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries are anticipated to be the next generation of important energy storage devices to replace lithium&#8208;ion batteries due to the ongoing use of lithium resources and the safety hazards associated with organic electrolytes in lithium&#8208;ion batteries. Manganese&#8208;based compounds, including MnOx materials, have prominent places among the many zinc&#8208;ion battery cathode materials. Additionally, Cu doping can cause the creation of an oxygen vacancy, which increases the material&#8216;s internal electric field and enhances cycle stability. MnOx also has great cyclic stability and promotes ion transport. At a current density of 0.2&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1, the Cu/MnOx nanocomposite obtained a high specific capacitance of 304.4&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1. In addition, Cu/MnOx nanocomposites showed A high specific capacity of 198.9&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 1000 cycles at a current density of 0.5&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1. Therefore, Cu/MnOx nanocomposites are expected to be a strong contender for the next generation of zinc&#8208;ion battery cathode materials in high energy density storage systems.

Manganese-based compounds, including MnOx materials, have prominent places among the many zinc-ion battery cathode materials. Additionally, Cu doping can cause the creation of an oxygen vacancy, which increases the material&#8216;s internal electric field and enhances cycle stability. MnOx also has great cyclic stability and promotes ion transport. At a current density of 0.2&#8197;A&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, the Cu/MnO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; nanocomposite obtained a high specific capacitance of 304.4&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. In addition, Cu/MnO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; nanocomposites showed A high specific capacity of 198.9&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; after 1000 cycles at a current density of 0.5&#8197;A&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. Therefore, Cu/MnO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; nanocomposites are expected to be a strong contender for the next generation of zinc-ion battery cathode materials in high energy density storage systems.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Pronounced Self&#8208;Induced Diastereomeric Anisochronism in Anisidine Amino Acid Diamides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>

Self&#8208;recognition of enantiomers: Anisidine amino acid diamides show extraordinary signal splitting in NMR spectra through supramolecular interaction and homochiral self&#8208;recognition making them to versatile NMR shift&#8208;reagents.







Abstract
The emergent properties resulting from selective supramolecular interactions are of significant importance for materials and chemical systems. For the directed use of such properties, a fundamental understanding of the interaction mechanism and the resulting mode of function is necessary for a tailored design. The self&#8208;induced diastereomeric anisochronism effect (SIDA), which occurs in the intermolecular interaction of chiral molecules, generates unique properties such as chiral self&#8208;recognition and nonlinear effects. Here we show that anisidine amino acid diamides lead to extraordinary signal splitting in NMR spectra through supramolecular interaction and homochiral self&#8208;recognition. By systematic experiments we have investigated the underlying SIDA effect, explored its limits and finally successfully utilized it in the determination of enantiomeric ratios by NMR spectroscopy of chiral &#8216;SIDA&#8208;inactive&#8217; compounds such as thalidomide.

         <title>Short Peptide and Amino Acid&#8208;Based Supramolecular Ionogels and Eutectogels</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ionic liquids and deep eutectic solvents are considered ideal choices for soft materials under environmental conditions. Understanding the self&#8208;assembly mechanisms of biological molecules, and specifically unmodified and modified peptide and amino acids, in these solvents is crucial for accelerating future research, fostering the development of innovative, bio&#8208;based soft materials.







Abstract
The capability of peptide and amino acid&#8208;based molecules to act as ionogelators and eutectogelators entrapping ionic liquids (ILs) and deep eutectic solvents (DESs) forming ionogels and eutectogels has gathered attention in recent decades. The self&#8208;assembly process, primarily driven by non&#8208;covalent interactions as hydrogen bonding, remains serendipitous in nature. This review provides a comprehensive and detailed report on self&#8208;assembly of unmodified and modified amino acids and peptides in the non&#8208;conventional solvents, ILs and DESs. Understanding these processes holds great promise for the development of innovative soft&#8208;materials, and to the progress of supramolecular systems in non&#8208;conventional solvent environments.

         <title>Structural Flexibility is a Decisive Factor in FLP Dihydrogen Cleavage with Tetrahedral Lewis Acids: A Silane Case Study</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dihydrogen activation is the paradigmatic reaction of frustrated Lewis pairs (FLPs). While trigonal&#8208;planar Lewis acids have been well established in this transformation, tetrahedral Lewis acids are surprisingly limited. Indeed, several cases were computed as thermodynamically and kinetically feasible but exhibit puzzling discrepancies with experimental results. In the present study, a computational investigation of the factors influencing dihydrogen activation are considered by large ensemble sampling of encounter complexes, deformation energies and the activation strain model for a silicon/nitrogen FLP and compared with a boron/phosphorous FLP. The analysis adds the previously missing dimension of Lewis acids&#8217; structural flexibility as a factor that influences preexponential terms beyond pure transition state energies. It sheds light on the origin of &#8220;overfrustration&#8221; (defined herein), indicates structural constraint in Lewis acids as a linchpin for activation of weak donor substrates, and allows drawing a more refined mechanistic picture of this emblematic reactivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Valorization of Corn Straw for Production of Glucose by Two&#8208;step Depolymerization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Depolymerization of the cellulose part in lignocellulose to glucose is a significant step for lignocellulose valorization. As one of the main by&#8208;products of agricultural biomass in crop&#8208;producing filed, valorization of corn straw has attracted considerable attention. In this study, a two&#8208;step depolymerizing strategy of high&#8208;pressure CO2&#8208;H2O pretreatment and oxidation&#8208;hydrolysis was applied for selective depolymerization of the cellulose component of corn straw to glucose production. Most part of the hemicellulose component could be removed through high&#8208;pressure CO2&#8208;H2O pretreatment in the presence of low concentration of acetic acid, and then as high as 32.2% yield of glucose was achieved in water at 170 oC for 6 h without additional catalyst. The active acid sites generated during the partial oxidation of hydroxymethyl groups to carboxyl groups on glucose units of cellulose was shown to be crucial for the efficient valorization of corn straw for glucose production.</dc:description>

         <title>Ligand Conformation Controls Assembly of a Helicate/Mesocate, Heteroleptic [Pd2L2L&#8217;2] Cages and a Six&#8208;Jagged [Pd6L12] Ring</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Molecular building blocks, capable of adopting several strongly deviating conformations, are of particular interest in the development of stimuli&#8208;responsive self&#8208;assemblies. The pronounced structural flexibility of a short acridone&#8208;based bridging ligand, equipped with two monodentate isoquinoline donors, is herein exploited to assemble a surprisingly diverse series of coordination&#8208;driven Pd(II) architectures. First, it can form a highly twisted Pd2L4 helicate,&#160;transformable into the corresponding mesocate, controlled by temperature, counter anion and choice of solvent. Second, it also allows the formation of heteroleptic cages, either from a mix of ligands with Pd(II) cations or by cage&#8208;to&#8208;cage transformation from homoleptic assemblies. Here, the acridone&#8208;based ligand tolerates counter ligands that carry their donors either in a diverging or converging arrangement, as it can rotate its own coordination sites by 90&#176; and structurally adapt to both situations via shape complementarity. Third, by a near 180&#176; rotation of only one of its arms, the ligand can adopt an S&#8208;shape conformation and form an unprecedented C6h&#8208;symmetric Pd6L12 saw&#8208;toothed six&#8208;membered ring.</dc:description>

         <title>Masking the Bioactivity of Hydroxamic Acids by Coordination to Cobalt: Towards Bioreductive Anticancer Agents</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The clinical use of many potent anticancer agents is limited by their non&#8208;selective toxicity to healthy tissue. One of these examples is vorinostat (SAHA), a pan histone deacetylase inhibitor, which shows high cytotoxicity with limited discrimination for cancerous over healthy cells. In an attempt to improve tumor selectivity, we exploited the properties of cobalt(III) as a redox&#8208;active metal center through stabilization with cyclen and cyclam tetraazamacrocycles, masking the anticancer activity of SAHA and other hydroxamic acid derivatives to allow for the complex to reach the hypoxic microenvironment of the tumor. Biological assays demonstrated the desired low in vitro anticancer activity of the complexes, suggesting effective masking of the activity of SAHA. Once in the tumor, the bioactive moiety may be released through the reduction of the CoIII center. Investigations revealed high long&#8208;term stability of the complexes, with cyclic voltammetry and chemical reduction experiments supporting the design hypothesis of SAHA release through the reduction of the CoIII prodrug. The results highlight the potential for further developing this complex class as novel anticancer agents by masking the high cytotoxicity of a given drug, however, the cellular uptake needs to be improved.</dc:description>

         <title>The Perfluoro&#8208;o&#8208;phenylene&#8208;mercury Trimer [Hg(o&#8208;C6F4)]3 &#8211; a Textbook Example of Phase&#8208;Dependent Structural Differences</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The geometric and electronic structure of [Hg(o&#8208;C6F4)]3 (1) in the gas phase, i.e. free of intermolecular interactions, was deter&#173;mined by a synchronous gas&#8208;phase electron diffraction/mass spec&#173;trometry experiment (GED/MS), complemented by quantum chemi&#173;cal calculations. 1 is stable up to 498 K and the gas phase contains a single molecular form: the trimer [Hg(o&#8208;C6F4)]3. It has a planar structure of D3h sym&#173;metry with a Hg&#8211;C distance of 2.075(5) &#197; and a Hg&#8211;Hg distance of 3.614(7) &#197; (both rh1). Structural differences between the crystalline and gaseous state have been analyzed. Different DFT functio&#173;nal&#8208;basis combi&#173;na&#173;tions were tested, demon&#173;stra&#173;ting the importance to consider the relativistic effects of the mercury atoms. The combi&#173;na&#173;tion PBE0/&#173;MWB(Hg),cc&#8208;pVTZ(C,F) turned out to be the most appro&#173;priate for the geometry optimization of such organomercurials. The elec&#173;tronic structure of 1, the nature of the chemical bonding in C&#8211;Hg&#8211;C fragments and the nature of the Hg&#183;&#183;&#183;Hg inter&#173;actions have been analyzed in terms of the Natural Bond Orbital (NBO) and Quantum Theory of Atoms in Molecules (QTAIM) approaches. The influence of the nature of halogen substi&#173;tution on the structure of the molecules in the series [Hg(o&#8208;C6H4)]3, [Hg(o&#8208;C6F4)]3, [Hg(o&#8208;C6Cl4)]3, [Hg(o&#8208;C6Br4)]3 was also analyzed.</dc:description>

         <title>Magnon Sensing of NO, NO2 and NH3 Gas Capture on CrSBr Monolayer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Air pollution and greenhouse emissions are significant problems across various sectors, urging the need for advanced technologies to detect and capture harmful gases. In recent years, two&#8208;dimensional (2D) materials have attracted increasing attention due to their large surface&#8208;to&#8208;volume ratio and reactivity. Herein, we investigate the potential of single&#8208;layer CrSBr for gas sensing and capturing by means of first&#8208;principles calculations. We explore the adsorption behaviour of different pollutant gases (H2S, NH3, NO, NO2, CO and CO2) on this 2D ferromagnet and the impact of intrinsic defects on its magnetic properties. Interestingly, we find that Br vacancies enhance the adsorption of NH3, NO and NO2 and induce&#160;a selective frequency shift on the magnon dispersion. This work motivates the creation of novel magnonic gas sensing devices based on 2D van der Waals magnetic materials.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report herein of a novel, enantioselective and rhodium&#8208; catalyzed cyclisation of allenyl alcohols towards chiral &#945;&#8208;vinylic, cyclic ethers employing a rhodium/(R,R)&#8208;Me&#8208;ferrocelane catalyst. The corresponding chiral cyclic products were obtained in general high yield and enantioselectivities. The synthetic value of our obtained products was further exemplified by transformations of the allylic ether function. Furthermore, applying our newly developed method in our previously reported route towards the total synthesis of (R,R,R)&#8208;&#945;&#8208;tocopherol, we were able to devise a significantly improved 2nd generation total synthesis with 12 steps in the longest linear sequence and an overall total yield of 24%.</dc:description>

         <title>Tuning the Flavin Core via Donor Appendage for Selective Subcellular Bioimaging and PDT Application</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we report a novel flavin analogue as singular chemical component for lysosome bioimaging and inherited photosensitizer capability of the flavin core was demonstrated as a promising candidate for photodynamic therapy (PDT) application. Fine&#8208;tuning the flavin core with the incorporation of methoxy naphthyl appendage provides an&#160;appropriate&#160;chemical design, thereby offering greater photostability, selectivity, and lysosomal colocalization, along with the aggregation&#8208;induced emissive nature, making it suitable for lysosomal bioimaging, applications. Additionally, photosensitization capability of the flavin core with photostable nature of the synthesized analogue has shown remarkable capacity for generating reactive oxygen species (ROS) within cells making it a promising candidate for photodynamic therapy (PDT) application.</dc:description>

         <title>Crystal to Hydrogel Transformation in S&#8208;Benzyl&#8208;L&#8208;Cysteine&#8208;Containing Cyclic Dipeptides &#8208; Nanostructure Elucidation and Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cyclic dipeptides (CDPs) are crucial building blocks for a range of functional nanomaterials due to their simple chemical structure and high molecular stability. In this investigation, we synthesized a set of S&#8208;benzyl&#8208;L&#8208;cysteine&#8208;based CDPs (designated as P1&#8211;P6) and thoroughly examined their self&#8208;assembly behavior in a methanol&#8208;water solvent to elucidate the relationship between their structure and gelation properties. The hydrophobicity of the amino acids within the CDPs was gradually increased. The present study employed a comprehensive array of analytical techniques, including NMR, FT&#8208;IR, AFM, thioflavin&#8208;T, congo&#8208;red CD, X&#8208;ray crystallography, and biophysical calculations like Hirshfield Surface analysis and DFT analysis. These methods revealed that in addition to hydrogen bonding, the hydrophobic nature of the amino acid side chain significantly influences the propensity of CDPs to form hydrogels. Each CDP yielded distinct nanofibrillar networks rich in &#946;&#8208;sheet structures, showcasing unique morphological features. Moreover, we explored the practical application of these CDP&#8208;based hydrogels in water purification by utilizing them to remove harmful organic dyes from contaminated water. This application underscores the potential of CDPs in addressing environmental challenges, offering a promising avenue for the future development of these materials in water treatment technologies.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A series of air&#8208;stable cobalt(&#8546;)salen complexes Co&#8208;1 to Co&#8208;4 have been synthesized and employed in the hydrosilylation of ketones. Notably, the most intricately tailored Co&#8208;3 pre&#8208;catalyst exhibited exceptional catalytic activity under mild reaction conditions. The developed catalytic hydrosilylation protocol proceeded with an unusual ppm level (5 ppm) catalyst loading of Co&#8208;3 and achieved a maximum TON of 200,000. A wide variety of aromatic, aliphatic, and heterocyclic ketones encompassing both electron&#8208;donating and electron&#8208;withdrawing substituents were successfully transformed into the desired silyl ethers or secondary alcohols in moderate to excellent yields.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>MXenes, a class of two&#8208;dimensional transition metal carbides, nitrides, and carbonitrides, have garnered significant attention due to their remarkable potential for energy storage, electrocatalysis, and gas separation applications. The fabrication processes of MXene involve building up the MXene structure from constituent elements and the selective elimination of M&#8722;A bonds from the precursor MAX. However, considerable efforts are still required to design and develop efficient MXene&#8208;based technologies. This review article aims to briefly analyse the synthesis methods employed for MXene production, ranging from direct synthesis and conventional chemical wet etching approach to the more recent molten salt etching technique. The review highlights the advancements made in achieving precise control over the terminal groups, which is paramount for tailoring the properties of MXenes for specific applications. Furthermore, the potential of MXene&#8208;based materials for carbon capture applications, particularly in developing advanced adsorbents, is emphasized. The in&#8208;depth examination of MXene synthesis techniques and their implications for carbon capture applications provides a solid foundation for developing and optimizing these promising materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Bridging dehydrogenation and hydrogenation in heterogeneous catalysis: A demonstration of a unified catalytic approach</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In the pursuit of enhancing the applications of hydrogen as an energy carrier, this research delved into the utilization of a singular hybrid catalyst capable of performing both dehydrogenation and hydrogenation processes for Liquid Organic Hydrogen Carriers (LOHCs). This study presents the synthesis and characterization of a hybrid catalyst, combining an organometallic pincer complex with Pd&#8208;Ru heterostructures supported on &#947;&#8208;alumina. Unlike conventional transition and noble metal nanoparticles, the use of a pincer complex offers exceptional thermal stability due to its aryl backbone, which is advantageous for various endothermic dehydrogenation reactions of hydrocarbons in LOHCs. This pioneering hybrid catalyst is a novel approach, demonstrating a proof of concept. In this study, we utilized the hybrid catalyst to investigate the dehydrogenation and hydrogenation of a lower enthalpic system, specifically the cyclooctane&#8208;cyclooctene system. The dehydrogenation of cyclooctane was conducted at 443 K using tertiary butyl ethylene as a sacrificial hydrogen acceptor, while the hydrogenation of cyclooctene reaction catalyzed by Pd&#8208;Ru nanostructures occurred at 298 K and 1 atm H2. The results showed successful tandem dehydrogenation&#8208;hydrogenation reactions. However, challenges were noted in terms of catalytic activity and recyclability, providing valuable insights for further refinement and optimization.</dc:description>

         <title>Under the Influence of Water: Molecular Recognition of Organic Hydrophilic Molecules in Water with a Prismarene Host Driven by Hydration Effects</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Abstract:A water&#8208;soluble prism[5]arene host can form endo&#8208;cavity complexes with hydrophilic organic substances in water by displacing frustrated water molecules from its deep cavity. Water molecules structured at both rims of the prismarene host can mediate hydrogen bonding interactions with the guest. Water&#8208;mediated hydrogen bonding interactions were invoked here to elucidate the elevated binding affinities and selectivity of the prismarene host toward hydrophilic organic guests. We show that water at the interface of a host&#8208;guest complex can act as an extension of the host structure, facilitating the accommodation of neutral guests within the binding site. This study highlights the crucial role of water in facilitating supramolecular interactions between a deep&#8208;cavity prismarene host and organic hydrophilic guests in aqueous medium.</dc:description>

         <title>Rational Design&#160;of Highly Selective Sialyllactose&#8208;Imprinted Nanogels</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We describe a facile method to prepare water&#8208;compatible molecularly imprinted polymer nanogels (MIP NGs) as synthetic antibodies against target glycans. Three different phenylboronic acid (PBA) derivatives were explored as monomers for the synthesis of MIP NGs targeting either &#945;2,6&#8208; or &#945;2,3&#8208;sialyllactose, taken as oversimplified models of cancer&#8208;related sT and sTn antigens. Starting from commercially available 3&#8208;acrylamidophenylboronic acid, also its 2&#8208;substituted isomer and the 5&#8208;acrylamido&#8208;2&#8208;hydroxymethyl cyclic PBA monoester derivative were initially evaluated by NMR studies. Then, a small library of MIP NGs imprinted with the &#945;2,6&#8208;linked template was synthesized and tested by mobility shift Affinity Capillary Electrophoresis (msACE) to rapidly assess an affinity ranking. Finally, the best monomer o&#8208;acrylamido PBA was selected for the synthesis of polymers targeting both sialyllactoses. The resulting MIP NGs display an affinity constant &#8776; 106 M&#8208;1 and selectivity towards imprinted glycans. This general procedure could be applied to any non&#8208;modified carbohydrate template possessing a reducing end.</dc:description>

         <title>Fluorogenic in&#8208;situ Labelling of Gelatin Polymer in Aqueous Solution and Hydrogel</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Gelatin polymers made from partially degraded collagen are important biomaterials, but their in&#8208;situ analysis suffers from uncontrollable covalent labelling and poor spatio&#8208;temporal imaging resolution. Herein, three tetrazolate&#8208;tagged tetraphenylethylene fluorophores (TPE&#8208;TAs) are introduced for practical fluorogenic labelling of gelatin in aqueous phase and hydrogels. These probes with aggregation&#8208;induced emission characteristics offer negligible background and elicit turn&#8208;on fluorescence by simply mixing with the gelatin in aqueous phase, giving a detection limit of 0.15 mg/L over a linear dynamic range up to 100 mg/L. This method does not work for collagens and causes minimal interference with gelatin properties. Mechanistic studies reveal a key role for multivalent electrostatic interactions between the abundant basic residues in gelatin (e.g., lysine, hydroxylysine, arginine) and anionic tetrazolate moieties of the lipophilic fluorophore synergistically in spatially rigid macromolecular encapsulation to achieve fluorogenic labelling. The AIE strategy by forming non&#8208;covalent fluorophore&#8208;gelatin complexes was developed for novel hydrogels that exhibited reversible fluorescence in response to dynamic microstructural changes in the hydrogel scaffold upon salting&#8208;in/out treatments, and enabled high spatio&#8208;temporal imaging of the fiber network in lyophilized samples. This work may open up avenues for in&#8208;situ imaging analysis and evaluation of gelatin&#8208;based biomaterials during processes such as in vivo degradation and mineralization.</dc:description>

         <title>Targeted Endoperoxides Delivering Singlet Oxygen to Cancer Cell Mitochondria: Exploration of the Therapeutic Potential</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The clinical practice of photodynamic therapy of cancer (PDT) is mostly limited to superficial types of skin cancer. The major reason behind this limited applicability is the need for light in the photogeneration of ROS, and in particular singlet oxygen. In order to circumvent this major roadblock, we designed and synthesized naphthalene&#8208;derived endoperoxides with mitochondria targeting triphenylphosphonium moieties. Here, we show that these compounds release singlet oxygen by thermal cycloreversion, and initiate cell death with IC50 &lt; 10 &#956;M in cancer cell cultures. The mouse 4T1 breast tumor model study, where the endoperoxide compound was introduced intraperitoneally, also showed highly promising results, with negligible systemic toxicity. Targeted delivery of singlet oxygen to cancer cell mitochondria could be the breakthrough needed to transform Photodynamic Therapy into a broadly applicable methodology for cancer treatment by keeping the central tenet and discarding problematic dependencies on oxygen or external light.</dc:description>

         <title>Thermally Stable P&#8208;Chiral Supramolecular Phosphines, their Self&#8208;Assembly and Implication in Rh&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>P&#8208;chiral supramolecular phosphine ligands are crucial for asymmetric transformations, but their synthesis is tedious. We report a one&#8208;step synthesis of thermally stable P&#8208;chiral supramolecular phosphines and their performance in the asymmetric hydrogenation of functionalized alkenes. A rational designing and synthesis of (R, R)&#8208;QuinoxP* ligated palladium complex (Pd&#8208;2) in excellent yield is reported. This Pd&#8208;2 catalyzed a direct P&#8208;C coupling of 2,3&#8208;dihydro&#8208;1&#8208;H&#8208;phosphindole (A1)/1,2,3,4&#8208;tetrahydrophosphindoline (A2) with 1&#8208;(3&#8208;iodophenyl)urea/2&#8208;iodo (B1)/6&#8208;hydroxy pyridine (B2) and, produced corresponding ligands L1&#8208;L3. The P&#8208;C coupling between A1 and B2 produced 6&#8208;(2,3&#8208;dihydro&#8208;1H&#8208;phosphindol&#8208;1&#8208;yl)pyridine&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;one (L2) with an excellent enantiomeric excess of up to 99%. L2 was found to be remarkably stable even at 150 &#176;C and did not oxidize/hydrolyze for at least 24 hours in open air. Such thermal stability and an impediment to oxidation are unprecedented. L2 self&#8208;assembled and produced L2&#8208;C1 (Pt), L2&#8208;C2(Pd), and L2&#8208;C3(Rh) assemblies. The utility of the self&#8208;assembled P&#8208;chiral ligand was demonstrated in the Rh&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric hydrogenation (AH) of functionalized olefins.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;P-chiral supramolecular phosphine ligands are crucial for asymmetric transformations, but their synthesis is tedious. We report a one-step synthesis of thermally stable P-chiral supramolecular phosphines and their performance in the asymmetric hydrogenation of functionalized alkenes. A rational designing and synthesis of (R, R)-QuinoxP* ligated palladium complex (Pd-2) in excellent yield is reported. This Pd-2 catalyzed a direct P-C coupling of 2,3-dihydro-1-H-phosphindole (A1)/1,2,3,4-tetrahydrophosphindoline (A2) with 1-(3-iodophenyl)urea/2-iodo (B1)/6-hydroxy pyridine (B2) and, produced corresponding ligands L1-L3. The P-C coupling between A1 and B2 produced 6-(2,3-dihydro-1H-phosphindol-1-yl)pyridine-2(1H)-one (L2) with an excellent enantiomeric excess of up to 99%. L2 was found to be remarkably stable even at 150 &#176;C and did not oxidize/hydrolyze for at least 24 hours in open air. Such thermal stability and an impediment to oxidation are unprecedented. L2 self-assembled and produced L2-C1 (Pt), L2-C2(Pd), and L2-C3(Rh) assemblies. The utility of the self-assembled P-chiral ligand was demonstrated in the Rh-catalyzed asymmetric hydrogenation (AH) of functionalized olefins. The L2-C3 catalyzed AH of functionalized alkenes and delivered chiral products with excellent enantioselectivity of &amp;gt;99%. A small library of 16 substrates was subjected to AH using L2-C3 to produce chiral compounds with excellent conversion and ee.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Rare&#8208;earth&#8208;metal complexes (Ln=Y, La, Ce, Sm and Lu) of tripodal N&#8208;donor ligands respecting the CHON principle have been synthetized and characterized. The selectivity of the ligands through the lanthanide cations was investigated and related to their donor strength.

The bending of (E)&#8208;1,2&#8208;Bis(pyridinium&#8208;4&#8208;yl)ethene dinitrate crystals induced by light and stress has been demonstrated.







Abstract
We report on the elastic and photodynamic properties of (E)&#8208;1,2&#8208;bis(pyridinium&#8208;4&#8208;yl)ethene dinitrate [H2Ebpe](NO3)2, whose needle&#8208;like crystals can be reversibly deformed by applying external mechanical stress. The macro&#8208;scale mechanical properties of [H2Ebpe](NO3)2 crystals were quantified by a three&#8208;point bending test, which gave a stress&#8208;strain curve with an elastic modulus of 1.18&#8197;GPa, and its values are lower than those of other flexible elastic organic crystals. It can also be reversibly bent through the [2+2] cycloaddition reaction of the olefin moiety, depending on the direction of UV irradiation.

Abstract
Two new chiral 1,2,3&#8208;triazole&#8208;containing macrocyclic oligoamides (i.&#8201;e.: triazolopeptoid 4 and 5) were obtained through solid&#8208;phase synthesis of linear precursors followed by high dilution macrocyclization reaction. Theoretical (DFT) and spectroscopic (NMR) studies revealed the intricate interplay between the N&#945;&#8208;chiral side chains and their conformational attitudes. BH3&#8208;mediated reduction of the tertiary amide groups of known 1&#8211;3 and newly synthesized 4 gave novel azamacrocycles 6&#8211;9. Detection of borane complexes of azamacrocycles 6 and 9 (i.&#8201;e.: 10 and 11), corroborated by X&#8208;ray diffraction studies, demonstrated the peculiar properties of 1,2,3&#8208;triazole&#8208;containing macrorings.

         <title>Ferrocene&#8208;Based N&#8208;Heterocyclic Silylenes: Monomeric Silanechalcogenones, Silanimines, Silirenes, and Insertion Products with P4</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reactivity of two ferrocene&#8208;based N&#8208;heterocyclic silylenes towards small to moderately sized molecular substrates (P4, S8, Se8, organic azides and alkynes) is studied. The aryl&#8208;substituted congener is more reactive than the sterically more encumbered and less ambiphilic 1,3,2&#8208;diazaborolyl homologue. Monomeric silanechalcogenones, silanimines and silirenes are readily available from both silylenes.







Abstract
The stable ferrocene&#8208;based N&#8208;heterocyclic silylenes fc[(N{B})2Si] (A; fc=1,1&#8217;&#8208;ferrocenylene, {B}=(HCNDipp)2B, Dipp=2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl) and fc[(NDipp)2Si] (B) are compared in a study focussing on their reactivity towards a range of small to moderately sized molecular substrates, viz. P4, S8, Se8, MesN3 (Mes=mesityl), RC&#8801;CH, and RC&#8801;CR (R=Ph, SiMe3). The Dipp&#8208;substituted congener B exhibits a more pronounced ambiphilicity and is sterically less congested than its 1,3,2&#8208;diazaborolyl&#8208;substituted relative A, in line with the higher reactivity of the former. The difference in reactivity is obviously due more to electronic than to steric reasons, as is illustrated by the fact that both A and B react with the comparatively bulky substrate MesN3 under mild conditions to afford the corresponding silanimine fc[(N{B})2Si=NMes] and fc[(NDipp)2Si=NMes], respectively. The heavier ketone analogues fc[(N{B})2Si=E] (E=S, Se, Te) are readily available from A and the corresponding chalcogen. In contrast, the reaction of the more reactive silylene B with elemental sulfur or selenium is unspecific, affording product mixtures. However, fc[(NDipp)2Si=Se] is selectively prepared from B and (Et2N)3PSe; the Te analogue is also accessible, but crystallises as head&#8208;to&#8208;tail dimer.

         <title>sAPP&#945; Peptide Promotes Damaged Microglia to Clear Alzheimer's Amyloid&#8208;&#946; via Restoring Mitochondrial Function</title>

         <dc:description>
It's an important challenge to find new ways to clear Amyloid&#8208;&#946; (A&#946;) from the brain. Soluble amyloid precursor protein &#945; (sAPP&#945;), an extracellular fragment peptide by the normal metabolism of amyloid precursor protein (APP), is similar to antibodies and promotes and protects microglia in phagocytosis and degradation of A&#946; through normalizing mitochondrial function. sAPP&#945; is a potential therapeutic peptide drug or drug carrier for Alzheimer's disease.







Abstract
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an age&#8208;related neurodegenerative disease with amyloid&#8208;&#946; (A&#946;) deposition as the main pathological feature. It's an important challenge to find new ways to clear A&#946; from the brain. The soluble amyloid precursor protein &#945; (sAPP&#945;) is a neuroprotective protein and can attenuate neuronal damage, including toxic A&#946;. However, the regulatory role of sAPP&#945; in non&#8208;neuronal cells, such as microglia, is less reported and controversial. Here, we showed that sAPP&#945; promoted the phagocytosis and degradation of A&#946; in both normal and damaged microglia. Moreover, the function of damaged microglia was improved by the sAPP&#945; through normalizing mitochondrial function. Furthermore, the results of molecular docking simulation showed that sAPP&#945; had a good affinity with A&#946;. We preliminarily reveal that sAPP&#945; is similar to antibodies and can participate in the regulation of microglia phagocytosis and degradation of A&#946; after binding to A&#946;. sAPP&#945; is expected to be a mild and safe peptide drug or drug carrier for AD.

         <title>A Phosphanyl Phosphagermene and its Reactivity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Reaction of a nucleophilic germylene Ge[CH(SiMe3)2]2 with the phosphanyl phosphaketene [{(H2C)(NDipp)}2P]PCO induces decarbonylation to form a phosphanyl phosphagermene [{(H2C)(NDipp)}2P]P=Ge[CH(SiMe3)2]2 (1; Dipp = 2,6&#8208;diisopropyl&#8208;phenyl). Addition of CO2 or MeCN to 1 results in [3+2]&#8208;cycloaddition reactions to afford five&#8208;membered heterocycles. This mode of reactivity is reminiscent of that observed for frustrated Lewis pairs, with the pendant phosphanyl group acting as a base and the germanium center as a Lewis acid. Contrastingly, 1,2&#8208;addition across the P=Ge bond was observed when using ammonia, small primary amines (NH2nPr, NH2iPr), or metal complexes (e.g. Au(PPh3)Cl and ZnEt2). These latter reactions allow for the one&#8208;step synthesis of metal phosphide complexes.</dc:description>

         <title>Design of Single&#8208;atom Catalysts on C5N2 for&#160;Nitrogen Fixation at Ambient Conditions : A First&#8208;principles Study</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Single atom catalysts (SACs) exhibit the flexible coordination&#160;structure of the active site and high utilization of active&#160;atoms, making them promising candidates for nitrogen&#160;reduction reaction (NRR) under ambient conditions. By&#160;the aid of first&#8208;principles calculations based on DFT, we&#160;have&#160;systematically explored the NRR catalytic behavior of&#160;thirteen 4d&#8208; and 5d&#8208;transition metal atoms anchored on 2D&#160;porous graphite carbon nitride C5N2. With high selectivity&#160;and outstanding activity, Zr, Nb, Mo, Ta, W and Re&#8208;doped&#160;C5N2 are identified as potential nominees for NRR. Particularly,&#160;Mo@C5N2 possesses an impressive low limiting potential&#160;of &#8722;0.39 V (corresponding to a very low temperature&#160;and atmospheric pressure), featuring the potential determining&#160;step involving *N&#8211;N transitions to *N&#8211;NH via the&#160;distal path. The catalytic performance of TM@C5N2 can&#160;be well characterized by the adsorption strength of intermediate&#160;*N2H. Moreover, there exists a volcanic relationship&#160;between the catalytic property UL and the structure descriptor&#160;&#936;, which validates the robustness and universality&#160;of &#936;, combined with our previous study. This work sheds light on the design of SACs with eminent NRR performance.</dc:description>

         <title>Graphene&#8208;Molecule Hybridization at a Ferromagnetic Interface</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The introduction of a graphene (Gr) buffer layer between a ferromagnetic substrate and a metallorganic molecule is known to mediate the magnetic coupling between them, an effect attributed to a weak hybridization between graphene and molecule. In this paper, we present experimental evidence of this effect through a detailed investigation of the frontier electronic properties of iron phthalocyanine deposited on cobalt&#8208;supported graphene. Despite being physisorbed, the molecular adsorption on Gr/Co induces a sizeable charge transfer from graphene to the molecular macrocycle leading to the partial occupation of the LUMO and the appearance of an energetically localized hybrid state, which can be attributed to the overlap between the graphene pz state and the molecular macrocycle. Graphene is not inert either; the adsorption of the molecule induces doping and alters the Fermi velocity of both the hybrid minicone state and the Dirac cone. Similar effects are observed when the molecular periphery is decorated with fluorine atoms, known for their electron&#8208;withdrawing properties, with minimal changes in the energy alignment.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The functionality of metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) is often encoded by particular chemical moieties found within these architectures. As such, new techniques to install increasingly more complex functionalities in MOFs are regularly being reported in the literature. One such functional group is the disulfide bond. The redox behavior of this covalent linkage renders MOFs responsive to stimuli, often under reducing conditions. Here, we review examples in which disulfide&#8208;containing MOFs are deployed in applications including drug delivery, therapeutic ferroptosis, exfoliation, energy storage, sensing, and others.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly Efficient Quenching of Singlet Oxygen by DNA Origami Nanostructures</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>DNA origami nanostructures (DONs) are able to scavenge reactive oxygen species (ROS) and their scavenging efficiency toward ROS radicals was shown to be comparable to that of genomic DNA. Herein, we demonstrate that DONs are highly efficient singlet oxygen quenchers outperforming double&#8208;stranded (ds) DNA by several orders of magnitude. To this end, a ROS mixture rich in singlet oxygen is generated by light irradiation of the photosensitizer methylene blue and its cytotoxic effect on Escherichia coli cells is quantified in the presence and absence of DONs. DONs are found to be vastly superior to dsDNA in protecting the bacteria from ROS&#8208;induced damage and even surpass established ROS scavengers. At a concentration of 15 nM, DONs are about 50&#160;000 times more efficient ROS scavengers than dsDNA at an equivalent concentration. This is attributed to the dominant role of singlet oxygen, which has a long diffusion length and reacts specifically with guanine. The dense packing of the available guanines into the small volume of the DON increases the overall quenching probability compared to a linear dsDNA with the same number of base pairs. DONs thus have great potential to alleviate oxidative stress caused by singlet oxygen in diverse therapeutic settings.</dc:description>

Herein, we demonstrate that DONs are highly efficient singlet oxygen quenchers outperforming double-stranded (ds) DNA by several orders of magnitude. To this end, a ROS mixture rich in singlet oxygen is generated by light irradiation of the photosensitizer methylene blue and its cytotoxic effect on Escherichia coli cells is quantified in the presence and absence of DONs. DONs are found to be vastly superior to dsDNA in protecting the bacteria from ROS-induced damage and even surpass established ROS scavengers. At a concentration of 15 nM, DONs are about 50&#160;000 times more efficient ROS scavengers than dsDNA at an equivalent concentration. This is attributed to the dominant role of singlet oxygen, which has a long diffusion length and reacts specifically with guanine. The dense packing of the available guanines into the small volume of the DON increases the overall quenching probability compared to a linear dsDNA with the same number of base pairs. DONs thus have great potential to alleviate oxidative stress caused by singlet oxygen in diverse therapeutic settings.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

The complexes were characterized by X&#8208;ray crystallography, high&#8208;resolution mass spectrometry, and infrared (IR), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and electronic absorption spectroscopies. The molecular structures show a rigidly square planar Ni(II) center linking two four&#8208;membered chelate rings whose dimensions are constant across the series. The electronic effect of the ligand substituents are revealed in the 13C NMR and electronic spectra, and corroborated by density functional calculations. Electron withdrawing groups deshield the low&#8208;field CS2 resonance, and the signature charge transfer band in the visible region is red&#8208;shifted. These observables have been accurately reproduced computationally, and revealed the Ni contribution to the ground state diminishes with decreasing electron withdrawing capacity of the ligand substituents. In contrast to 1,2&#8208;dithiolates, the redox inactivity afforded by 1,1&#8208;dithiolates stems from the smaller chelate ring and substantially reduced sulfur content that is key to stabilizing the radical form.</dc:description>

         <title>Dynamics of Coordinated Phosphonate Group Directly Observed by 17O&#8208;NMR in Lanthanide(iii) Complexes of a Mono(ethyl phosphonate) DOTA Analogue</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dynamics of mutual exchange of coordinated and non&#8208;coordinated oxygen atoms on phosphate anion analogue was measured for the first time. It proceeds through a sterically demanding four&#8208;membered &#954;2&#8208;O2P chelate. Its energy barrier steeply increases for smaller Ln(III) ions and is accessible only in more flexible TSA isomers of large Ln(III) ions.







Abstract
Biological phosphates can coordinate metal ions and their complexes are common in living systems. Dynamics of mutual oxygen atom exchange in the tetrahedral group in complexes has not been investigated. Here, we present a direct experimental proof of exchange (&#8220;phosphonate rotation&#8221;) in model Ln(III) complexes of monophosphonate H4dota analogue which alters phosphorus atom chirality of coordinated phosphonate monoester. Combination of macrocycle&#8208;based isomerism with P&#8208;based chirality leads to several diastereoisomers. (Non)&#8208;coordinated oxygen atoms were distinguished through 17O&#8208;labelled phosphonate group and their mutual exchange was followed by various NMR techniques and DFT calculations. The process is sterically demanding and occurs through bulky bidentate (&#954;2&#8208;PO2)&#8722; coordination and was observed only in twisted&#8208;square antiprism (TSA) diastereoisomer of large Ln(III) ions. Its energy demands increase for smaller Ln(III) ions (298&#916;G&#8800;(exp./DFT)=51.8/52.1 and 61.0/71.5&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1 for La(III) and Eu(III), respectively). These results are helpful in design of such complexes as MRI CA and for protein paramagnetic NMR probes. It demonstrates usefulness of 17O NMR to study solution dynamics in complexes involving phosphorus acid derivatives and it may inspire use of this method to study dynamics of phosphoric acid derivatives (as e.&#8201;g. phosphorus acid&#8208;based inhibitors of metalloenzymes) in different areas of chemistry.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Driven by escalating environmental concerns, synthetic chemistry faces an urgent need for a green revolution. Green chemistry, with its focus on low environmental impacting chemicals and minimized waste production, emerges as a powerful tool in addressing this challenge. Metrics such as the E&#8208;factor guide the design of environmentally friendly strategies for chemical processes by quantifying the waste generated in obtaining target products, thus enabling interventions to minimize it. Phthalocyanines (Pcs), versatile molecules with exceptional physical and chemical properties, hold immense potential for technological applications. This review aims to bridge the gap between green chemistry and phthalocyanine synthesis by collecting the main examples of environmentally sustainable syntheses documented in the literature. The calculation of the E&#8208;factor of a selection of them provides insights on how crucial it is to evaluate a synthetic process in its entirety. This approach allows for a better evaluation of the actual sustainability of the phthalocyanine synthetic process and indicates possible strategies to improve it.</dc:description>

         <title>The structure of carbon dioxide at the air&#8208;water interface and its chemical implications.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The efficient reduction of CO2 into valuable products is a challenging task in an international context marked by the climate change crisis and the need to move away from fossil fuels. Recently, the use of water microdroplets has emerged as an interesting reaction media where many redox processes which do not occur in conventional solutions take place spontaneously. Indeed, several experimental studies in microdroplets have already been devoted to study the reduction of CO2 with promising results. The increased reactivity in microdroplets is thought to be linked to unique electrostatic solvation effects at the air&#8208;water interface. In the present work, we report a theoretical investigation on this issue for CO2 using first&#8208;principles molecular dynamics simulations. We show that CO2 is stabilized at the interface, where it can accumulate, and that compared to bulk water solution, its electron capture ability is larger. Our results suggests that reduction of CO2 might be easier in interface&#8208;rich systems such as water microdroplets, which is in line with early experimental data and indicate directions for future laboratory studies. The effect of other relevant factors which could play a role in CO2 reduction potential is discussed.</dc:description>

         <title>Mechanisms of Mn(V)&#8208;Oxo to Mn(IV)&#8208;Oxyl Conversion: From Closed&#8208;Cubane Photosystem II to Mn(V) Catalysts and the Role of the Entering Ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An Mn(V)&#8208;oxo complex with a trigonal bipyramidal structure can change its identity to an Mn(IV)&#8208;oxyl if it rearranges into a square pyramidal structure. An L ligand can trap the Mn(IV)&#8208;oxyl complex by coordinating to the square pyramidal structure, thereby making the resulting complex energetically more available to serve as a highly reactive catalyst in H2O oxidation and C&#8722;H bond functionalization.







Abstract
The low activation barrier for O&#8722;O coupling in the closed&#8208;cubane Oxygen&#8208;Evolving Centre (OEC) of Photosystem&#8197;II (PSII) requires water coordination with the Mn4 &#8242;dangler&#8242; ion in the Mn(V)&#8208;oxo fragment. This coordination transforms the Mn(V)&#8208;oxo complex into a more reactive Mn4(IV)&#8208;oxyl species, enhancing O&#8722;O coupling. This study explains the mechanism behind the coordination and indicates that in the most stable form of the OEC, the Mn4 fragment adopts a trigonal bipyramidal geometry but needs to transition to a square pyramidal form to be activated for O&#8722;O coupling. This transition stabilizes the Mn4 dxy orbital, enabling electron transfer from the oxo ligand to the dxy orbital, converting the oxo ligand into an oxyl species. The role of the water is to coordinate with the square pyramidal structure, reducing the energy gap between the oxo and oxyl forms, thereby lowering the activation energy for O&#8722;O coupling. This mechanism applies not only to the OEC system but also to other Mn(V)&#8208;based catalysts. For other catalysts, ligands such as OH&#8722; stabilize the Mn(IV)&#8208;oxyl species better than water, improving catalyst activation for reactions like C&#8722;H bond activation. This study is the first to explain the Mn(V)&#8208;oxo to Mn(IV)&#8208;oxyl conversion, providing a new foundation for Mn&#8208;based catalyst design.

         <title>Post&#8208;formation of Fused Pentagonal Structure on Fjord Region of Polyaromatic Hydrocarbons under Hydrothermal Conditions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Platinum catalyzes the cleavage of two C&#8722;H bonds at the fjord position of a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH), and the subsequent C&#8722;C bond formation gives a cyclopenta&#8208;PAH. This post&#8208;construction of the pentagonal structure is energetically challenging and requires high temperatures. With water as the medium, it has been found that the monocyclization selectively occurs at a lower temperature. Fe2O3 is effective in suppressing side reactions. We found this reactivity in the Pt&#8208;catalyzed deuteration of dibenzo[g,p]chrysene in D2O. More information can be found in the Research Article by H. Tsuji and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202400987).

         <dc:description>
The Cover Feature presents Li@calix[3]pyrrole, the newest member of the molecular electride family, realizing its unique electronic structure. Theoretical investigations reveal the position of its anionic electron localized outside the molecular structure, adjacent to the pyrrole N&#8722;H moieties. This special charge&#8208;separated configuration is facilitated by an electron transfer from lithium to a molecular orbital located at the back of the calix[3]pyrrole fragment. More information can be found in the Research Article by R. Saha, B.&#8197;B. Skjelstad and S. Pan (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202400448).

         <title>Spectroscopic Manifestations Of (Anti)Aromaticity In Oxidized And Reduced Porphyrin And Norcorrole</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aromaticity and antiaromaticity are foundational principes in organic chemistry, regularly invoked to explain stability, structure, and magnetic and electronic properties. There are ongoing challenges in assigning molecules as aromatic or antiaromatic using optical spectroscopy. Here we report spectroelectrochemical and computational analyses of porphyrin (18&#960; neutral, aromatic) and norcorrole (16&#960; neutral, antiaromatic), and their oxidized (16&#960; porphyrin dication) and reduced (norcorrole 18&#960; dianion) forms. Our results show that while the visible spectra are characteristic of (anti)aromaticity consistent with H&#252;ckel&#8217;s rules, the IR spectra are much less informative, owing to the relative rigidity of norcorrole. The results have implications for the assignment of (anti)aromaticity in both ground&#8208;state and time&#8208;resolved excited&#8208;state spectra.</dc:description>

         <title>Advancing Nitrile&#8208;Aminothiol Strategy for Dual and Sequential Bioconjugation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nitrile&#8208;aminothiol conjugation (NATC) stands out as a promising biocompatible ligation technique due to its high chemo&#8208;selectivity. Herein we investigated the reactivity and substrate scope of NAT conjugation chemistry, thus developing a novel pH dependent orthogonal NATC as a valuable tool for chemical biology. The study of reaction kinetics elucidated that the combination of heteroaromatic nitrile and aminothiol groups led to the formation of an optimal bioorthogonal pairing, which is pH dependent. This pairing system was effectively utilized for sequential and dual conjugation. Subsequently, these rapid (&#8776;1 h) and high yield (&gt;90%) conjugation strategies were successfully applied to a broad range of complex biomolecules, including oligonucleotides, chelates, small molecules and peptides. The effectiveness of this conjugation chemistry was demonstrated by synthesizing a fluorescently labelled antimicrobial peptide&#8208;oligonucleotide complex as a dual conjugate to imaging in live cells. This first&#8208;of&#8208;its&#8208;kind sequential NATC approach unveils unprecedented opportunities in modern chemical biology, showcasing exceptional adaptability in rapidly creating structurally complex bioconjugates. Furthermore, the results highlight its potential for versatile applications across fundamental and translational biomedical research.</dc:description>

         <title>Precisely Designed Ultra&#8208;Small CoP Nanoparticles&#8208;decorated Hollow Carbon Nanospheres as Highly Efficient Host in Lithium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Designing porous carbon materials with metal phosphides as host materials holds promise for enhancing the cyclability and durability of lithium&#8208;sulfur (Li&#8208;S) batteries by mitigating sulfur poisoning and exhibiting high electrocatalytic activity. Nevertheless, it is urgent to precisely control the size of metal phosphides to further optimize the polysulfide conversion reaction kinetics of Li&#8208;S batteries. Herein, a subtlety regulation strategy was proposed to obtain ultra&#8208;small CoP nanoparticles&#8208;decorated hollow carbon nanospheres (CoP@C) by using spherical polyelectrolyte brush (SPB) as the template with stabilizing assistance from polydopamine coating, which also works as carbon source. Leveraging the electrostatic interaction between SPB and Co2+, ultra&#8208;small Co particles with sizes measuring 5.5 &#177; 2.6 nm were endowed after calcination. Subsequently, through a gas&#8208;solid phosphating process, these Co particles were converted into CoP nanoparticles with significantly finer sizes (7.1 &#177; 3.1 nm) compared to state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art approaches. By uniformly distributing the electrocatalyst nanoparticles on hollow carbon nanospheres, CoP@C facilitated the acceleration of Li ion diffusion and enhanced the conversion reaction kinetics of polysulfides through adsorption&#8208;diffusion synergy. As a result, Li&#8208;S batteries utilizing the CoP@C/S cathode demonstrated an initial specific discharge capacity of 850.0 mAh g&#8208;1 at 1.0 C, with a low&#8208;capacity decay rate of 0.03% per cycle.</dc:description>

As a result, Li-S batteries utilizing the CoP@C/S cathode demonstrated an initial specific discharge capacity of 850.0 mAh g-1 at 1.0 C, with a low-capacity decay rate of 0.03% per cycle.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Structure&#8208;Based Design of Ultrapotent Tricyclic Ligands for FK506&#8208;Binding proteins</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Access to small, rigid, and sp3&#8208;rich molecules is a major limitation in the drug discovery for challenging protein targets. FK506&#8208;binding proteins hold high potential as drug targets or enablers of molecular glues but are fastidious in the chemotypes accepted as ligands. We here report an enantioselective synthesis of a highly rigidified pipecolate&#8208;mimicking tricyclic scaffold that precisely position functional groups for interacting with FKBPs. This was enabled by a 14&#8208;step gram&#8208;scale synthesis featuring anodic oxidation, stereospecific vinylation, and N&#8208;acyl iminium cyclization. Structure&#8208;based optimization resulted in the discovery of FKBP inhibitors with picomolar biochemical and subnanomolar cellular activity that represent the most potent FKBP ligands known to date.</dc:description>

         <title>Expanding the &#960;&#8208;system of fatty acid&#8208;anion transporter conjugates modulates their mechanism of proton transport and mitochondrial uncoupling activity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mitochondrial uncoupling by small molecule protonophores is a promising strategy for developing novel anticancer agents. Recently, aryl urea substituted fatty acids (aryl ureas) were identified as a new class of protonophoric anticancer agents. To mediate proton transport these molecules self&#8208;assemble into membrane&#8208;permeable anionic dimers in which intermolecular hydrogen bonds between the carboxylate and aryl&#8208;urea anion receptor delocalise the negative charge across the aromatic &#960;&#8208;system. In this work, we extend the aromatic &#960;&#8208;system by introducing a second phenyl substituent to the aryl urea scaffold and compare the proton transport mechanisms and mitochondrial uncoupling actions of these compounds to their monoaryl analogues. It was found that incorporation of meta&#8208;linked phenyl substituents into the aryl urea scaffold enhanced proton transport in vesicles and demonstrated superior capacity to depolarise mitochondria, inhibit ATP production and reduce the viability of MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;231 breast cancer cells. In contrast, diphenyl ureas linked through a 1,4&#8208;distribution across the phenyl ring displayed diminished proton transport activity, despite both diphenyl urea isomers possessing similar binding affinities for carboxylates. Mechanistic studies suggest that inclusion of a second aryl ring changes the proton transport mechanism, presumably due to steric factors that impose higher energy penalties for dimer formation.</dc:description>

         <title>Hybrid Ethylcellulose Polymeric Films: Ag(I)&#8208;Based Components and Curcumin as Reinforcing Ingredients for Enhanced Food Packaging Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Bio&#8208;active ethylcellulose (EC) polymeric films have been obtained by incorporating curcumin (curc) and Ag(I)&#8208;based compounds, known for their antioxidant and antimicrobial activity, respectively, within the polymeric matrix. The recently reported Ag(I) coordination polymer, in both its structural forms (&#945;&#8208;[(bpy)Ag(OTf)]&#8734; and &#946;&#8208;{[(bpy)Ag][OTf]}&#8734;), and the [(bpy)Ag(OTf)]&#8734;&#8208;curc polymeric co&#8208;crystal (bpy = 2,2&#8217;&#8208;bipyridine; OTf = trifluoromethanesulfonate) have been selected as Ag(I) species. The hybrid composite films have been prepared through the simple solvent casting method and characterized through Powder X&#8208;Ray Diffraction (PXRD), Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) and Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM), UV&#8208;vis spectroscopy. The deep investigation of the film samples highlighted the non&#8208;inert behaviour of EC towards these specific active ingredients. Antimicrobial tests showed that EC films embedding the Ag(I)&#8208;based compounds present good antimicrobial performance, in particular against Staphylococcus aureus, used as a model of Gram&#8208;positive bacteria. In addition, Silver migration tests, performed on the Ag(I)&#8208;incorporating EC films, evidenced low values of silver release particularly in the case of the EC films incorporating [(bpy)Ag(OTf)]&#8734;&#8208;curc.</dc:description>

         <title>Rationalization of a Streptavidin Based Enantioselective Artificial Suzukiase: An Integrative Computational Approach</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A computational modeling approach is applied to rationalize the impact of streptavidin mutations and length of the biotion cofactor on the enantioselective Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura synthesis of binaphthyls by means of an Artificial Metalloenzyme built employing the streptavidin&#8208;biotin technology. The integrative computational approach includes DFT calculations, protein&#8208;ligand dockings and molecular dynamics simulations.







Abstract
An Artificial Metalloenzyme (ArM) built employing the streptavidin&#8208;biotin technology has been used for the enantioselective synthesis of binaphthyls by means of asymmetric Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling reactions. Despite its success, it remains a challenge to understand how the length of the biotin cofactors or the introduction of mutations to streptavidin leads the preferential synthesis of one atropisomer over the other. In this study, we apply an integrated computational modeling approach, including DFT calculations, protein&#8208;ligand dockings and molecular dynamics to rationalize the impact of mutations and length of the biotion cofactor on the enantioselectivities of the biaryl product. The results unravel that the enantiomeric differences found experimentally can be rationalized by the disposition of the first intermediate, coming from the oxidative addition step, and the entrance of the second substrate. The work also showcases the difficulties facing to control the enantioselection when engineering ArM to catalyze enantioselective Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura couplings and how the combination of DFT calculations, molecular dockings and MD simulations can be used to rationalize artificial metalloenzymes.

         <title>Asymmetric and Chemoselective Iridium Catalyzed Hydrogenation of Conjugated Unsaturated Oxime Ethers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The selective hydrogenation of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated oxime ethers is described. The hydrogenation reaction proceeded smoothly at (20&#8211;50&#8197;bar) room temperature. The generated chiral oxime ethers showed good isolated yields and excellent enantioselectivity (84&#8201;%&#8211;99&#8201;% yield, &gt;97&#8201;% ee).

Research on the chemoselective metal&#8208;catalyzed hydrogenation of conjugated &#960;&#8208;systems has mostly been focussed on enones. Herein, we communicate the understudied asymmetric hydrogenation of enimines catalyzed by N,P&#8208;iridium complexes and chemoselective toward the alkene. A number of enoxime ethers underwent hydrogenation smoothly to yield the desired products in high yield and stereopurity (up to 99&#8201;% yield, up to 99&#8201;% ee). No hydrogenation of the C=N &#960;&#8208;bond was observed under the applied reaction conditions (20&#8197;bar H2, rt, DCM). It was demonstrated that the chiral oxime ether could be hydrolyzed into the ketone with complete preservation of the installed stereogenity at the &#945;&#8208;carbon. At last, a binding mode of the substrate to the active iridium catalyst and the consequence for the stereoselective outcome was proposed.

&lt;p&gt;The selective hydrogenation of &#945;,&#946;-unsaturated oxime ethers is described. The hydrogenation reaction proceeded smoothly at (20&#8211;50&#8197;bar) room temperature. The generated chiral oxime ethers showed good isolated yields and excellent enantioselectivity (84&#8201;%&#8211;99&#8201;% yield, &amp;gt;97&#8201;% ee). The hydrogenation products could be further hydrolysed to chiral ketones.

         <title>Nitrophenol Reduction with Silver Oxide Nanostructures as a Sustainable Approach to Environmental Remediation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We propose silver oxide as a cost&#8208;effective and sustainable alternative to noble metals for the catalytic reduction of nitroaromatic compounds.&#160; In the present investigation, we have adopted a facile and green synthetic route for the synthesis of silver oxide nanostructures. The prepared nanostructures were found to have crystallized in the cuprite phase and exhibited absorbance over the entire visible range of the electromagnetic spectrum. The catalytic potential of the silver oxide was evaluated by following the kinetics of nitrophenol reduction under ambient conditions and is observed to follow pseudo&#8208;first order kinetics with the apparent rate constant kapp = 4.24 x 10&#8208;3 s&#8208;1 at minimum concentration of the catalyst. We attribute the observed catalytic activity to the freshly generated catalytic surface featuring a partially reduced form of silver oxide. The findings highlight the efficacy of silver oxide in mitigating the environmental pollution originating from the recalcitrant nitroarenes.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis and Characterization of a Cyclic Trimer of a Chiral Spirosilabifluorene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis and characterization of a spirosilabifluorene cyclic trimer have been successfully demonstrated. The HOMO and LUMO energy levels were decreased through the C/Si substitution in the spiro&#8208;atom of spirobifluorene in the cyclic trimer. Furthermore, the chiroptical properties were investigated from both experimental and theoretical points of view with careful discussion.







Abstract
A chiral shape&#8208;persistent macrocyclic compound (Si&#8208;[3]), designed by the C/Si substitution in the spiro&#8208;atom of spirobifluorene in the cyclic trimer (C&#8208;[3]), has been successfully synthesized in this study. The C/Si substitution made the spiro&#8208;conjugation and energy levels of HOMO and LUMO decrease. Due to the silicon substitution, the macrocyclic compound Si&#8208;[3] was able to be degraded by fluoride ions, but its reaction rate was slower than that of the unsubstituted spirosilabifluorene, showing the chemical stability of Si&#8208;[3]. Furthermore, the chiroptical properties of Si&#8208;[3] with D3&#8208;symmetric macrocyclic structure were investigated, and (P,P,P)&#8208;Si&#8208;[3] showed a high emission quantum yield (&#934;f=80&#8201;%) and moderate dissymmetry factor of circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) (glum,exp=&#8722;1.2&#215;10&#8722;3). According to the time&#8208;dependent density&#8208;functional theory (TD&#8208;DFT) calculations using polarizable continuum model (PCM), the bright CPL from Si&#8208;[3] was explained by a planarization of one bisilafluorenyl moiety at the excited state, which is responsible for the almost fully&#8208;allowed radiative transition with a short emission lifetime of &#964;f=1.89&#8197;ns.

         <title>Thio and Seleno&#8208;Psoralens as Efficient Triplet Harvesting Photosensitizers for Photodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work demonstrates the role of exocyclic replacement of carbonyl oxygen of psoralen with sulfur and selenium. DFT and TD&#8208;DFT studies revealed a significant red&#8208;shifted absorption, increased oscillator strength, and spin&#8208;orbit coupling values, along with reduced singlet&#8208;triplet energy gaps in thio and seleno derivatives of psoralen. These factors led to efficient triplet harvesting, enabling them as promising photosensitizers for photodynamic therapy.







Abstract
The Psoralen (Pso) molecule finds extensive applications in photo&#8208;chemotherapy, courtesy of its triplet state forming ability. Sulfur and selenium replacement of exocyclic carbonyl oxygen of organic chromophores foster efficient triplet harvesting with near unity triplet quantum yield. These triplet&#8208;forming photosensitizers are useful in Photodynamic Therapy (PDT) applications for selective apoptosis of cancer cells. In this work, we have critically assessed the effect of the sulfur and selenium substitution at the exocyclic carbonyl (TPso and SePso, respectively) and endocyclic oxygen positions of Psoralen. It resulted in a significant redshifted absorption spectrum to access the PDT therapeutic window with increased oscillator strength. The reduction in singlet&#8208;triplet energy gap and enhancement in the spin&#8208;orbit coupling values increase the number of intersystem crossing (ISC) pathways to the triplet manifold, which shortens the ISC lifetime from 10&#8722;5&#8197;s for Pso to 10&#8722;8&#8197;s for TPso and 10&#8722;9&#8197;s for SePso. The intramolecular photo&#8208;induced electron transfer process, a competitive pathway to ISC, is also considerably curbed by exocyclic functionalizations. In addition, a maximum of 115&#8197;GM of two&#8208;photon absorption (2PA) with IR absorption (660&#8211;1050&#8197;nm) confirms that the Psoralen skeleton can be effectively tweaked via single chalcogen atom replacement to design a suitable PDT photosensitizer.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Vinyl sulfones are crucial building blocks in synthetic chemistry and core structural units of pharmaceutically active molecules, thus extensive investigations have been conducted on the construction of these skeletons. In contrast to the classical synthetic approaches, the radical sulfonylation of alkynes for producing vinyl sulfones has garnered considerable interest because of its mild conditions and high efficiency. Radical sulfonation of alkynes typically begins with the sulfonyl radical attacking the alkynes, followed by further functionalization. Moreover, the association of metal&#8208;catalyst&#8208;free systems with multicomponent reactions (MCRs) offers an environmentally friendly pathway for efficiently constructing complex scaffolds from readily available partners. However, there is no comprehensive review summarizing the advancements in metal&#8208;catalyst&#8208;free multicomponent radical sulfonylation of alkynes. Hence, we provide a categorical overview based on the objects of sulfonylation of alkynes (hydrosulfonylation, carbosulfonylation, aminosulfonylation, oxysulfonylation, sulfosulfonylation, selenosulfonylation, and iodosulfonylation), along with interpretations of the reaction mechanisms.</dc:description>

         <title>Constructing Dynamic Cross&#8208;Linking Networks as Durable Bifunctional Coating for Highly Stable Zinc Anodes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The serious dendrite growth and H2O&#8208;induced side reactions on the Zn electrode lead to a significant fading in the cycling performance, hindering the development of commercial applications of aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs). Herein, a novel bifunctional network coating of dynamically cross&#8208;linking sodium alginate with trehalose has been rationally constructed on the Zn anode (Zn@AT). Firstly, the AT coating possesses abundant zinophilic oxygen&#8208;containing functional groups, which are able to induce uniform Zn2+ ion flux. Secondly, the AT coating as a solid barrier can effectively inhibit H2O&#8208;induced side reactions by lowering the activity of H2O molecules. More specially, based on the dynamic cross&#8208;linking, AT network coating is endowed with self&#8208;healing capacity during cycling for durable battery operation. Consequentially, Zn@AT anodes in symmetric cells can cycle stably for 2787 h at 2 mA cm&#8208;2/2 mAh cm&#8208;2, and even achieve a significantly long cycle performance of 1087 h at large charge/discharge depths of 10 mA cm&#8208;2/10 mAh cm&#8208;2. Moreover, the Zn@AT//MnO2 full cell shows excellent specific capacity of 175 mAh g&#8208;1 after 400 cycles. This study lights an effective strategy to enhance the durability of Zn electrodes in AZIBs.</dc:description>

Firstly, the AT coating possesses abundant zinophilic oxygen-containing functional groups, which are able to induce uniform Zn2+ ion flux. Secondly, the AT coating as a solid barrier can effectively inhibit H2O-induced side reactions by lowering the activity of H2O molecules. More specially, based on the dynamic cross-linking, AT network coating is endowed with self-healing capacity during cycling for durable battery operation. Consequentially, Zn@AT anodes in symmetric cells can cycle stably for 2787 h at 2 mA cm-2/2 mAh cm-2, and even achieve a significantly long cycle performance of 1087 h at large charge/discharge depths of 10 mA cm-2/10 mAh cm-2. Moreover, the Zn@AT//MnO2 full cell shows excellent specific capacity of 175 mAh g-1 after 400 cycles. This study lights an effective strategy to enhance the durability of Zn electrodes in AZIBs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Pathway Selection in Temporal Evolution of Supramolecular Polymers of Ionic &#960;&#8208;Systems: Amphiphilic Organic Solvent Dictates the Fate of Water</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
AOS dictates aqueous: The temporal evolution of short supramolecular polymers (SPs) of ionic &#960;&#8208;systems into long SP networks in water and amphiphilic organic solvent (AOS) mixture follows two distinct pathways. The release or retaining water from ionic &#960;&#8208;systems is the key for pathway selection, and it is dictated by AOS.







Abstract
Understanding solvent&#8208;solute interactions is essential to designing and synthesising soft materials with tailor&#8208;made functions. Although the interaction of the solute with the solvent mixture is more complex than the single solvent medium, solvent mixtures are exciting to unfold several unforeseen phenomena in supramolecular chemistry. Here, we report two unforeseen pathways observed during the hierarchical assembly of cationic perylene diimides (cPDIs) in water and amphiphilic organic solvent (AOS) mixtures. When the aqueous supramolecular polymers (SPs) of cPDIs are injected into AOS, initially kinetically trapped short SPs are formed, which gradually transform into thermodynamically stable high aspect ratio SP networks. Using various experimental and theoretical investigations, we found that this temporal evolution follows two distinct pathways depending on the nature of the water&#8208;AOS interactions. If the AOS is isopropanol (IPA), water is released from cPDIs into bulk IPA due to strong hydrogen bonding interactions, which further decreases the monomer concentration of cPDIs (Pathway&#8208;1). In the case of dioxane AOS, cPDI monomer concentration further increases as water is retained among cPDIs (Pathway&#8208;2) due to relatively weak interactions between dioxane and water. Interestingly, these two pathways are accelerated by external stimuli such as heat and mechanical agitation.

         <title>Control Over Anion Coordination on Pd(II), Cu(I), and Ag(I) with Regioisomeric Phosphine&#8208;Carboxylate Ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of regioisomeric carboxylate&#8208;phosphine ligands is shown to enable control over anion coordination on Pd(II) centers. Palladium(II) carboxylates are important for C&#8722;H activation and the complexes with specific orientations of the carboxylate anion or with a coordinated carboxylic acid group provide relevant coordination models. Additionally, the spatial anion control can be extended to other metal centers.







Abstract
The coordination of anionic donors is involved at various stages of catalytic cycles in transition&#8208;metal catalysis, but control over the spatial positioning of anions around a metal center is a challenge in coordination chemistry. Here we show that regioisomeric phosphine&#8208;carboxylate ligands provide spatial anion control on palladium(II) centers by favoring either &#954;2, cis&#8208;&#954;1, or trans&#8208;&#954;1 coordination of the carboxylate donor. Additionally, the palladium(II) carboxylates, which contain a methyl donor, upon protonation, deliver metal&#8208;alkyl complexes that feature a coordinated carboxylic acid. Such complexes can be considered as models for the minima that follow the concerted metalation&#8208;deprotonation transition state for C&#8722;H activation. The predictability of the coordination modes is further demonstrated on silver(I) and copper(I) centers, for which less common structures of mononuclear and dinuclear complexes can be obtained by using spatial anion control. Our results demonstrate the potential for spatial control over carboxylate anions in coordination chemistry.

         <title>Photochemical Aerobic Upcycling of Polystyrene Plastics via Synergistic Indirect HAT Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Plastic pollution constitutes an evergrowing urgent environmental problem, since overaccumulation of plastic waste, arising from the immense increase of the production of disposable plastic products, overcame planet&#8217;s capacity to properly handle them. Chemical upcycling of polystyrene constitutes a convenient method for the conversion of plastic waste into high&#8208;added value chemicals, suggesting an attractive perspective in dealing with the environmental crisis. We demonstrate herein a novel, easy&#8208;to&#8208;perform organocatalytic photoinduced aerobic protocol, which proceeds via synergistic indirect hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) catalysis under LED 390 nm Kessil lamps as the irradiation source. The developed method employs a BrCH2CN&#8208;thioxanthone photocatalytic system and was successfully applied to a variety of everyday&#8208;life plastic products, leading to the isolation of benzoic acid after simple base&#8208;acid work up in yields varying from 23&#8208;49%, while a large&#8208;scale experiment was successfully performed, suggesting that the photocatalytic step is susceptible to industrial application.</dc:description>

         <title>A Photoredox Thiol&#8208;yne Reaction for the Synthesis of Vinyl Sulfide&#8208;Based Coumarins and its Effect on Fluorescence Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Coumarins still remain one of the most widely explored fluorescent dyes, with a broad spectrum of applications spanning various fields, such as molecular imaging, bioorganic chemistry, materials chemistry, or medical sciences. Their fluorescence is strongly based on a push&#8208;pull mechanism involving an electron&#8208;donating group (EDG), mainly located at the C7 or C8 positions of the dye core. Unfortunately, up to now, these positions have been very limited to hydroxyl or amino groups. In this study, we present in detail the synthesis of the first series of coumarins bearing a vinyl sulfide as the EDG at the C7 position. These derivatives were prepared by thiol&#8211;yne reaction, promoted by ruthenium&#8208; or porphyrin&#8208;based photoredox catalysis, enabling rapid late&#8208;stage diversification. We also functionalized coumarins with short peptides, and BSA protein as a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept study, in a single&#8208;step process. This strategy, capable of proceeding under aqueous conditions, overcomes the protection/deprotection steps usually required by traditional methods, which also use strong bases and organic solvents. Moreover, the photophysical properties such as absorption and emission of obtained coumarins (for 3&#8208;CF3, 3&#8208;benzothiazole, 6&#8208;8&#8208;difluoro derivatives), predominantly exhibited large Stokes shifts (up to 204 nm) and maintained intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) characteristics.</dc:description>

However, even slight differences in the molecular structure often result in formation of non&#8208;isostructural polymorphic frameworks particularly in the case of hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) because the structures of HOFs are based on a subtle balance of reversible interactions. In this study, we found that three simple analogues of tetracarboxylic acids with naphthalene, quinoxaline, and pyrazinopyrazine cores (NT, QX, and PP, respectively) yielded isostructural solvated HOFs (NT&#8208;1, QX&#8208;1, and PP&#8208;1, respectively), where hydrogen&#8208;bonded sql&#8208;networked sheets were slip&#8208;stacked with closely similar manners. These isostructural HOFs underwent structural transformations in different manners upon removal of the guest solvents. Comparison of the crystal structures of the HOFs before and after the transformation revealed that intermolecular interactions of the core significantly affected on rearrangements of hydrogen bonds in the transformation. The results suggest the potential to control the properties and functions of isostructural HOFs by elemental doping.</dc:description>

         <title>Intramolecular Cyclopropanation of Active Methylene Derivatives Based on FeCl2 or FeCl3&#8208;Promoted Radical&#8208;Polar Crossover Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The bicyclic cyclopropanes were synthesized by two radical&#8208;polar crossover reactions based on the FeCl3&#8208;promoted oxidative radical cyclization of active methylene derivatives and the redox radical cyclization of &#945;&#8208;chloro&#8208;active methylenes using the subcatalytic amount of FeCl2 and ligand.







Abstract
Radical&#8208;polar crossover reactions were studied for the intramolecular cyclopropanation of active methylene derivatives. In the presence of FeCl3 as a stoichiometric oxidant and K2HPO4 as a base, the dehydrogenative cyclopropanation of active methylenes proceeded through the FeCl3&#8208;promoted oxidative radical cyclization followed by the ionic cyclization to give the bicyclic cyclopropanes. The use of &#945;&#8208;chloro&#8208;active methylenes leads the subcatalytic cyclopropanation involving two redox pathways. In the presence of K2HPO4, the redox cyclopropanation proceeded by using FeCl2 (20&#8197;mol%) in combination with ligand (20&#8197;mol%).

         <title>Robust Radicals Featuring B&#8208; and N&#8208;Embedded Dioxygen&#8208;Bridged Units: Synthesis, Structures, and Optical Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The rigid B&#8208; and N&#8208;embedded dioxygen&#8208;bridged units with special electronic effect are introduced to the TTM unit to construct stable luminescent radicals (BO&#8208;TTM and NO&#8208;TTM). NO&#8208;TTM exhibits near&#8208;infrared emission at 830&#8197;nm with a narrow full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 55&#8197;nm, while BO&#8208;TTM shows blue&#8208;shifted luminescence at 635&#8197;nm and a narrower FWHM of merely 43&#8197;nm.







Abstract
Tris(2,4,6&#8208;trichlorophenyl)methyl (TTM) group has been widely used for constructing organic radicals, but the poor optical stabilities limit the application prospects of the TTM radicals. In this work, the rigid B&#8208; and N&#8208;embedded dioxygen&#8208;bridged (BO and NO) units were attached to the TTM skeleton as the strong electron&#8208;withdrawing and electron&#8208;donating groups, respectively. The rigidity and strong electronic effect of the BO and NO units contribute to the high chemical and optical stability of BO&#8208;TTM and NO&#8208;TTM radicals. Notably, NO&#8208;TTM exhibits near&#8208;infrared emission at 830&#8197;nm with a narrow full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 55&#8197;nm (100&#8197;meV), while BO&#8208;TTM shows blue&#8208;shifted luminescence at 635&#8197;nm and a narrower FWHM of merely 43&#8197;nm (130&#8197;meV). This study has developed a methodology to produce highly efficient and enduring luminescent radicals, which could tune emission properties such as wavelength and FWHM.

         <title>Tandem Four&#8208;Component Reaction to Access Fused Polycycles Exhibiting Aggregation&#8208;Enhanced Through&#8208;Space Charge Transfer Emission</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A set of fused polycyclic compounds were synthesized efficiently through tandem four&#8208;component reactions that incorporated a chiral binaphthyl&#8208;based dicarbaldehyde, malonitrile and two carbonyl acetonitriles. Notably, Aggregation&#8208;enhanced through&#8208;space charge transfer emission could be observed based on the polycyclic spacer. Theoretical analyses further supported the possibility of spatial electronic communication.







Abstract
Rapid construction of new fluorescence emitters is essential in advancing synthetic luminescent materials. This study illustrated a piperidine&#8208;promoted reaction of chiral dialdehyde with benzoylacetonitrile and malonitrile, leading to the formation of the 6/6/7 fused cyclic product in good yield. The proposed reaction mechanism involves a dual condensation/cyclization process, achieving the formation of up to six bonds for fused polycycles. The single crystal structure analysis revealed that the fused cyclic skeleton contains face&#8208;to&#8208;face naphthyl and cyanoalkenyl motifs, which act as the electronic donor and acceptor, respectively, potentially resulting in through&#8208;space charge transfer (TSCT) emission. While the TSCT emissions were weak in solution, a notable increase in luminescence intensity was observed upon aggregation, indicating bright fluorescent light. A series of theoretical analyses further supported the possibility of spatial electronic communication based on frontier molecular orbitals, the distance of charge transfer, and reduced density gradient analysis. This work not only provides guidance for the one&#8208;step synthesis of complex polycycles, but also offers valuable insights into the design of aggregation&#8208;enhanced TSCT emission materials.

         <title>Peri&#8208;Alkylated Terrylenes and Ternaphthalenes Building&#8208;Blocks Towards Multi&#8208;Edge Nanographenes
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile synthetic route has been developed to produce highly soluble peri&#8208;alkylated terrylene and its derivatives with enhanced &#960;&#8208;conjugation at bay&#8208;regions. The synthesized terrylene derivatives exhibit remarkably high fluorescence quantum yields and molar extinction coefficients, making them ideal candidates for applications in single&#8208;molecule spectroscopy, photonics, and quantum emission.







Abstract
Since its first synthesis by Clar in 1948, terrylene &#8211; a fully connected ternaphthalene oligomer via naphthalene's peri&#8208;positions &#8211; has gained special focus within the rylene family, drawing interest for its unique chemical, structural, optoelectronic and single photon emission properties. In this study, we introduce a novel synthetic pathway that enhances the solubility of terrylene derivatives through complete peri&#8208;alkylation, while also facilitating extensions at the bay&#8208;positions. This approach not only broadens the scope of terrylene's chemical versatility but also opens new avenues for developing solution processable novel multi&#8208;edge nanographenes and tailoring electronic energy levels through topological edge structures. Our findings include a comprehensive structural and spectroscopic characterization along with transient absorption spectroscopy and photophysics of both the synthesized peri&#8208;alkylated terrylene and its phenylene&#8208;fused derivative.

The G&#8208;quadruplex with a diagonal 10&#8208;nt loop shows a unique equilibrium between two structures, both stabilized by base stacking and non&#8208;standard hydrogen bonding. In addition to the 12&#8197;guanines involved in three G&#8208;quartets, most residues in the loop regions are well defined and involved in the interactions.







Abstract
We report the high&#8208;resolution NMR solution&#8208;state structure of an intramolecular G&#8208;quadruplex with a diagonal loop of ten nucleotides. The G&#8208;quadruplex is formed by a 34&#8208;nt DNA sequence, d[CAG3T2A2G3TATA2CT3AG4T2AG3T2], named UpsB&#8208;Q&#8208;1. This sequence is found within promoters of the var genes of Plasmodium falciparum, which play a key role in malaria pathogenesis and evasion of the immune system. The [3+1]&#8208;hybrid G&#8208;quadruplex formed under physiologically relevant conditions exhibits a unique equilibrium between two structures, both stabilized by base stacking and non&#8208;canonical hydrogen bonding. Unique equilibrium of the two closely related 3D structures originates from a North&#8208;South repuckering of deoxyribose moiety of residue T27 in the lateral loop. Besides the 12 guanines involved in three G&#8208;quartets, most residues in loop regions are involved in interactions at both G&#8208;quartet&#8208;loop interfaces.

         <title>Afterglow Performance of Phenylenevinylene&#8208;Based Semiconducting Polymer Nanoparticles Doped with Photosensitizers Containing Electron&#8208;Withdrawing Groups</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
For the doped photosensitizers with strong electron&#8208;withdrawing groups, the stronger the electron&#8208;withdrawing ability of the group, the worse of the afterglow performance of the SPN regardless of the 1O2 generation ability of the photosensitizer. When the doped photosensitizer exhibited weak or none electron&#8208;withdrawing effect, the 1O2 generation ability of the photosensitizer played a dominant role on the afterglow performance of the SPNs.







Abstract
It is usually believed that doping with photosensitizers capable of generating singlet oxygen (1O2) plays a pivotal role in enhancing the afterglow performance of semiconducting polymer nanoparticles (SPNs). However, the effect of doping photosensitizer bearing electron&#8208;withdrawing groups has not been reported. Here we report the effect of doping with six photosensitizers possessing different electron&#8208;withdrawing groups on the afterglow performance of SPNs using poly[(9,9&#8208;di(2&#8208;ethylhexyl)&#8208;9H&#8208;fluo&#8208;rene&#8208;2,7&#8208;vinylene)&#8208;co&#8208;(1&#8208;methoxy&#8208;4&#8208;(2&#8208;ethylhexyloxy)&#8208;2,5&#8208;phenylenevinylene)] (PF&#8208;MEHPPV) as substrate. It was found that the afterglow performance of SPNs was significantly influenced by doping with photosensitizers bearing electron&#8208;withdrawing groups. For the doped photosensitizers with strong electron&#8208;withdrawing groups, the stronger the electron&#8208;withdrawing ability of the group, the worse of the afterglow performance of the SPN regardless of the 1O2 generation ability of the photosensitizer. When the doped photosensitizer exhibited weak or none electron&#8208;withdrawing effect, the 1O2 generation ability of the photosensitizer played a dominant role on the afterglow performance of the SPNs. This work deepens the understanding of the design and synthesis of SPNs with different afterglow properties.

         <title>Unique Reactivity of the 1,4&#8208;Bis(silyloxy)&#8208;1,3&#8208;cyclopentadiene Moiety: Application to the Synthesis of 7&#8208;Norbornanone Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The silyloxy&#8208;substituted carbons of 1,4&#8208;bis(silyloxy)&#8208;1,3&#8208;cyclopentadienes prepared from 2,2&#8208;disubstituted&#8208;1,3&#8208;cyclopentanediones exhibit unique reactivities. Despite being sterically hindered, one of these carbons attacks on the carbocation generated at the &#948;&#8208;position to form a 4,5&#8208;cis&#8208;fused ring skeleton. Subsequent skeletal rearrangement of the bicyclic core produces the corresponding 2&#8208;silyloxy&#8208;2&#8208;norbornen&#8208;7&#8208;one.







Abstract
We describe a method for the synthesis of various 2&#8208;silyloxy&#8208;2&#8208;norbornen&#8208;7&#8208;ones by exploiting the specific reactivity of the 1,4&#8208;bis(silyloxy)&#8208;1,3&#8208;cyclopentadiene framework, which is generated by the silylation of a 2,2&#8208;disubstituted&#8208;1,3&#8208;cyclopentanedione bearing a picolinoyloxy group at the 2&#8242; position of its C&#8208;2 side chain. The release of the acyloxy group during the reaction generates carbocations that are then attacked by silyloxy&#8208;substituted carbons in the 1,4&#8208;bis(silyloxy)&#8208;1,3&#8208;cyclopentadiene moiety skeleton, forming a 4,5&#8208;cis&#8208;fused ring skeleton. Skeletal rearrangement of the bicyclic core results in the formation of the corresponding 2&#8208;silyloxy&#8208;2&#8208;norbornen&#8208;7&#8208;one. This novel transformation of 1,3&#8208;cyclopentanedione moieties can be used to synthesise other cyclopentenone&#8208;fused bicyclic frameworks.

         <title>Ammonothermal Synthesis and Solid&#8208;State NMR Study of the Imidonitridosilicate Rb3Si6N5(NH)6</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The imidonitridosilicate Rb3Si6N5(NH)6 was synthesized using the ammonothermal synthesis. Analysis of the compound is performed using X&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier&#8208;Transform infrared (FTIR) and magic&#8208;angle spinning (MAS) NMR spectroscopy. The characterization of the imidonitridosilicate Rb3Si6N5(NH)6, only the second representative of this compound class, as possible intermediate during the ammonothermal synthesis of nitridosilicates helps to improve the understanding for the ammonothermal synthesis of nitrides.







Abstract
The imidonitridosilicate Rb3Si6N5(NH)6, being only the second representative of this compound class, was synthesized ammonothermally at 870&#8197;K and 230&#8197;MPa. Its crystal structure was solved from single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction data. The imidonitridosilicate crystallizes isotypically with the respective potassium compound in space group P4132 with the lattice parameter a=10.9422(4)&#8197;&#197; forming a three&#8208;dimensional imidonitridosilicate tetrahedra network with voids for the rubidium ions. The structure model and the presence of the imide groups were verified by Fourier&#8208;Transform infrared (FTIR) and magic&#8208;angle spinning (MAS) NMR spectroscopy, using cross polarization 15N{1H} and 29Si{1H} MAS NMR experiments. Rb3Si6N5(NH)6 represents a possible intermediate during the ammonothermal synthesis of nitridosilicates. The characterization of such intermediates improves the understanding of the reaction pathway from ammonothermal solutions to nitrides. Thus, the ammonothermal synthesis is an alternative approach to the well&#8208;established high&#8208;temperature synthesis leading to the compound class of nitridosilicates.

         <dc:description>
MXenes, 2D nanomaterials constituted by alternating stacking of transition metal and carbide layers, drawn here as the fronds of a palm tree, are proposed as heterogeneous catalysts in the Concept by A. Dhakshinamoorthy, R. Ram&#237;rez&#8208;Grau, H. Garcia and A. Primo (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202400576). MXenes convert indane molecules, represented as birds flying to the tree, into indanol and indanone products that are hanging on the tree as fruits. The sea and the beach highlight that the process is environmentally benign.

         <dc:description>
The Cover Feature illustrates an activated carboxylic acid (ACA) pushing a swing in order to populate the high&#8208;energy state associated with the aromatic imine laid on the swing seat. The energy derived from the decarboxylation of the ACA is partially diverted into the imine dynamic library that is temporarily brought into an out&#8208;of&#8208;equilibrium state in which an aromatic imine prevails over an aliphatic imine. More information can be found in the Research Article by M. Valentini, G. Ercolani, and S. Di&#8197;Stephano (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202401104).

         <title>A Real&#8208;Time LSPR&#8208;Based Study of Metal&#8208;Organic Framework (MOF) Growth</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
LSPR spectroscopy is applied to monitor the layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer like deposition of twelve different MOFs based on Cu, Al, Fe and Zn. The microfluidic setup of LSPR enables an in&#8208;situ spectroscopic readout based on the plasmonic properties of immobilized gold nanoparticle sensors under mild synthesis conditions. The MOF&#8208;coated nanoparticles can be used in gas sensing applications.







Abstract
MOFs are known for their absorption properties and widely used for accumulation, filtering, sensorics, photothermal, catalytical and other applications. Their combination with plasmonic metal nanoparticles leads to hybrid structures that profit from the stabilizing effect and high porosity of the MOF as well as the optical and electronic properties of the nanoparticles. The growth of MOFs on plasmonic nanoparticles can be monitored in&#8208;situ using LSPR spectroscopy, simultaneously applying microfluidic reaction conditions for the fabrication of NP@MOF structures. Here, a systematic study is conducted using LSPR spectroscopy for the monitoring of the Layer&#8208;by&#8208;Layer deposition of twelve different MOFs, determining the suitability of LSPR spectroscopy for this purpose. In addition to some well&#8208;investigated materials like HKUST&#8208;1, other MOFs such as MIL&#8208;53, MIL&#8208;88&#8197;A and Cu&#8208;BDC are deposited successfully. For some MOFs such as Zn&#8208;Fum, the LSPR experiment indicates that no deposition had taken place. The results are confirmed with AFM, SEM and XPS measurements. This work shows that LSPR spectroscopy is suitable for the in&#8208;situ monitoring of LbL MOF growth and the microfluidic setup is a very promising method for the controlled manufacturing of NP@MOF hybrid structures. Further studies may include the optimization of the synthesis process or the transfer to other materials.

         <title>Linkage&#8208;Mediated Electronic Structure Modulation in Multicomponent Covalent Organic Frameworks for Dramatically Promoted Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Precise and multiple modifications toward linkage lead to the redistribution of charge on COFs with extended &#960;&#8208;conjugation and reinforced D&#8208;A effect, thus boosting photogenerated carrier separation and migration, enabling remarkably promoted photoctalytic HER performance, which highlights the strategy of linkage&#8208;mediated electronic structure modulation in COFs.







Abstract
Linkage chemistry is an essential aspect to covalent organic framework (COF) applications; it is highly desirable to precisely modulate electronic structure mediated directly by linkage for efficient COF&#8208;based photocatalytic hydrogen evolution, which however, remains substantially challenging. Herein, as a proof of concept, a collection of robust multicomponent pyrene&#8208;based COFs with abundant donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8722;A) interactions has been judiciously designed and synthesized through molecularly engineering linkage for photogeneration of hydrogen. Controlled locking and conversion of linkage critically contribute to continuously regulating COFs&#8217; electronic structures further to optimize photocatalytic activities. Remarkably, the well&#8208;modulated optoelectronic properties turn on the average hydrogen evolution rate from zero to 15.67&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 by the protonated quinoline&#8208;linked COF decorated with the trifluoromethyl group (TT&#8208;PQCOF&#8208;CF3). Using diversified spectroscopy and theoretical calculations, we show that multiple modifications toward linkage synergistically lead to the redistribution of charge on COFs with extended &#960;&#8208;conjugation and reinforced D&#8722;A effect, making TT&#8208;PQCOF&#8208;CF3 a promising material with significantly boosted carrier separation and migration. This study provides important guidance for the design of high&#8208;performance COF photocatalysts based on the strategy of linkage&#8208;mediated electronic structure modulation in COFs.

         <title>A Structure&#8208;Activity Investigation of the Fungal Metabolite (&#8722;)&#8208;TAN&#8208;2483B: Inhibition of Bruton's Tyrosine Kinase</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
(&#8722;)&#8208;TAN&#8208;2483B is a fungal metabolite that inhibits Bruton's Tyrosine Kinase (Btk), showing immunomodulatory potential. Docking revealed binding modes for (&#8722;)&#8208;TAN&#8208;2483B and analogues in the Btk active site. Newly synthesised analogues were tested, corroborating docking observations and highlighting the requirements for Btk inhibition and selectivity. These findings inform the development of new Btk inhibitors for leukemia and immune disorders.







Abstract
The natural product (&#8722;)&#8208;TAN&#8208;2483B is a fungal secondary metabolite which displays promising anti&#8208;cancer and immunomodulatory activity. Our previous syntheses of (&#8722;)&#8208;TAN&#8208;2483B and sidechain analogues uncovered inhibitory activity against Bruton's tyrosine kinase (Btk), an established drug target for various leukaemia and immunological diseases. A structure&#8208;based computational study using ensemble docking and molecular dynamics was performed to determine plausible binding modes for (&#8722;)&#8208;TAN&#8208;2483B and analogues in the Btk binding site. These hypotheses guided the design of new analogues which were synthesised and their inhibitory activities determined, providing insights into the structural determinants of the furopyranone scaffold that confer both activity and selectivity for Btk. These findings offer new perspectives for generating optimised (&#8722;)&#8208;TAN&#8208;2483B&#8208;based kinase inhibitors for the treatment of leukaemia and immunological diseases.

Our previous syntheses of (&#8722;)-TAN-2483B and sidechain analogues uncovered inhibitory activity against Bruton's tyrosine kinase (Btk), an established drug target for various leukaemia and immunological diseases. A structure-based computational study using ensemble docking and molecular dynamics was performed to determine plausible binding modes for (&#8722;)-TAN-2483B and analogues in the Btk binding site. These hypotheses guided the design of new analogues which were synthesised and their inhibitory activities determined, providing insights into the structural determinants of the furopyranone scaffold that confer both activity and selectivity for Btk. These findings offer new perspectives for generating optimised (&#8722;)-TAN-2483B-based kinase inhibitors for the treatment of leukaemia and immunological diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Overcrowded 14,14&#8242;&#8208;Bidibenzo[a,j]anthracenes: Challenges in Syntheses and Atypical Property of Lacking Symmetry&#8208;Breaking Charge Transfer (SBCT)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The overcrowded biaryl bears two highly distorted molecular halves and a small interplanar angle between two anthryl moieties (31&#176;, currently the lowest reported value). The close contact between the two aryl fragments endows them with intramolecular interactions. Whereas the restricted rocking around the central C&#8722;C bond suspends the formation of the symmetry&#8208;breaking charge transfer (SBCT) state.







Abstract
14,14&#8242;&#8208;Bidibenzo[a,j]anthracenes (BDBAs) were prepared by iridium&#8208;catalyzed annulation of 5,5&#8242;&#8208;biterphenylene with alkynes. The molecular geometries of overcrowded BDBAs were verified by X&#8208;ray crystallography. The two dibenzo[a,j]anthryl moieties are connected through the sterically hindered 14 positions, resulting in highly distorted molecular halves. The conformation with a small twist angle between two molecular halves can minimize steric conflicts between the substituents at 1 and 13 positions and the carbon atoms of the central axis, as well as steric clashes between those substituents. One such example is octafluoro&#8208;substituted BDBA, where the interplanar angle between two anthryl moieties is approximately 31&#176; (currently the lowest reported value, cf. 81&#176; in 9,9&#8242;&#8208;bianthracene). The intramolecular interactions and electronic couplings between two molecular halves resulted in upfield 1H NMR signals, redshifted absorption and emission bands, and a reduced HOMO&#8211;LUMO gap. Photodynamic investigations on BDBAs indicated that the formation of the conventional symmetry&#8208;breaking charge transfer (SBCT) state was suspended by restricted rocking around the central C&#8722;C bond. Such a mechanism associated with this highly constrained conformation was examined for the first time.

         <title>Radiation&#8208;Induced Defects in Uranyl Trinitrate Solids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Uranyl trinitrate solid&#8208;state materials are exposed to gamma radiation and characterized by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and Raman spectroscopy. Density functional theory calculations confirm the spectroscopic signatures and the presence of a nitrate radical bound in a monodentate fashion to the uranyl cation. Including alkali cations in the theoretic models is crucial to accurate calculation of the g&#8208;values.







Abstract
Actinides are inherently radioactive; thus, ionizing radiation is emitted by these elements can have profound effects on its surrounding chemical environment through the formation of free radical species. While previous work has noted that the presence of free radicals in the system impacts the redox state of the actinides, there is little atomistic understanding of how these metal cations interact with free radicals. Herein, we explore the effects of radiation (UV and &#947;) on three U(VI) trinitrate complexes, M[UO2(NO3)3] (where M=K+, Rb+, Cs+), and their respective nitrate salts in the solid state via electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and Raman spectroscopy paired with Density Functional Theory (DFT) methods. We find that the alkali salts form nitrate radicals under UV and &#947; irradiation, but also note the presence of additional degradation products. M[UO2(NO3)3] solids also form nitrate radicals and additional DFT calculations indicate the species corresponds to a change from the bidentate bound nitrate anion into a monodentate NO3&#8226; radical. Computational studies also highlight the need to include the second sphere coordination environment around the [UO2(NO3)3]0,1 species to gain agreement between the experimental and predicted EPR signatures.

         <title>High&#8208;Intensity Circular Dichroism of Head&#8208;To&#8208;Tail Regioregular Poly(1,4&#8208;Phenylene)s in the Aggregated State</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The use of nickel&#8208;Chiraphos complex as a catalyst enables the synthesis of a variety of poly(1,4&#8208;phenylene) with a chiral side chain and provides new insights into the correlation with their helical structure through the measurement of CD spectra.







Abstract
Circular dichroism (CD) studies on poly(1,4&#8208;phenylene)s bearing a chiral side chain in the aggregated conditions were carried out. Little CD was observed in a solution form, while addition of a poor solvent into the polyphenylene solution induced aggregation and a strong CD was observed, accordingly. Applying the controlled degree of polymerization (DP) of poly(1,4&#8208;phenylene) in the use of bidentate diphosphine Chiraphos as a ligand for the nickel catalyst, the relationship of DP with CD strength was studied to reveal to show the highest CD at the DP=84 (gabs=ca. 2&#215;10&#8722;2). It was also found that the related aggregation was observed in good solvent 1,2&#8208;dichloroethane upon standing the solution at 4&#8201;&#176;C for 3&#8211;23&#8197;days to observe gabs=ca. 10&#8722;1. Studies on the substituent effect of poly(1,4&#8208;phenylene) suggested that CD behaviors were dependent on the type of non&#8208;chiral substituent on the aromatic ring as well as the side&#8208;chain chirality.

         <title>A Comprehensive Review on Reductive Recycling of Cathode Materials of Spent Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review aims to digest lithium&#8208;ion battery cathode material recycling and regeneration methods based on the reduction reaction mechanism. It discusses several reductants commonly used in the recycling process, and introduces some recently proposed direct regeneration methods. Finally, it concludes and outlooks the battery recycling based on the reduction reaction mechanism.







Abstract
The prosperity of the lithium&#8208;ion battery market is inevitably accompanied by the depletion of corresponding resources and the accumulation of spent batteries in a dialectical manner. Spent lithium&#8208;ion batteries are harboring the characteristics of hazardous waste and high&#8208;value resources, so efficient recycling is of great significance. The cathode material is considered as an interesting target for repurposing. Despite some important reviews give commendable emphasis to recycling technologies, there is still a dearth of exploration of recycling mechanisms. This deficiency of awareness highlights the need for further research and development in this area. This review aims to systematically review and thoroughly discuss the reduction reaction mechanism of each method regarding different cathode materials. And systematically digest the selection of reducing agent and the effect of reduction reaction on material regeneration are systematically digested, as well as the impact of the reduction reaction on the regeneration of materials. This review emphasizes the importance of balancing efficiency, economic and environmental benefits in reuse technologies. Finally, the review proposes an outlook on the opportunities and challenges facing the reuse of key materials for next&#8208;generation spent batteries aimed at promoting the green and sustainable development of lithium&#8208;ion batteries, circular economy and ecological balance.

         <title>Breaking Cycles: Saponification&#8208;Enhanced NMR Fingerprint Matching for the Identification and Stereochemical Evaluation of Cyclic Lipodepsipeptides from Natural Sources</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unlocking the stereochemistry of cyclic lipodepsipeptides (CLiPs) is simplified and made more universal. By comparing the (CH&#945;) HSQC NMR fingerprint of linear diastereomeric sequences from automated synthesis with linearized natural compound obtained by controlled hydrolysis, the procedure for stereochemistry determination is streamlined. The adaptable approach enhances research efficiency across the diverse CLiP structural portfolio.







Abstract
We previously described NMR based fingerprint matching with peptide backbone resonances as a fast and reliable structural dereplication approach for Pseudomonas cyclic lipodepsipeptides (CLiPs). In combination with total synthesis of a small library of configurational CLiP congeners this also allows unambiguous determination of stereochemistry, facilitating structure&#8208;activity relationship studies and enabling three&#8208;dimensional structure determination. However, the on&#8208;resin macrocycle formation in the synthetic workflow brings considerable burden and limits universal applicability. This drawback is here removed altogether by also transforming the native CLiP into a linearized analogue by controlled saponification of the ester bond. This eliminates the need for macrocycle formation, limiting the synthesis effort to linear peptide analogues. NMR fingerprints of such linear peptide analogues display a sufficiently distinctive chemical shift fingerprint to act as effective discriminators. The approach is developed using viscosin group CLiPs and subsequently demonstrated on putisolvin, leading to a structural revision, and tanniamide from Pseudomonas ekonensis COR58, a newly isolated lipododecapeptide that defines a new group characterized by a ten&#8208;residue large macrocycle, the largest to date in the Pseudomonas CLiP portfolio. These examples demonstrate the effectiveness of the saponification&#8208; enhanced approach that broadens applicability of NMR fingerprint matching for the determination of the stereochemistry of CLiPs.

         <title>Crystalline CdS/Amorphous Cd(OH)2 Composite for Electrochemical CO2 Reduction to CO in a Wide Potential Window</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The c&#8208;CdS/a&#8208;Cd(OH)2/CP electrode exhibits a highest CO Faradaic efficiency of ~100&#8201;% at &#8722;2.16&#8197;V to &#8722;2.46&#8197;V vs. Fc/Fc+ in the ionic liquid&#8208;based electrolytes. Meanwhile, the CO Faradaic efficiencies of &gt;90&#8201;% can be obtained in a wide potential window of 1000&#8197;mV with the maximum CO partial current density of 154.7&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at &#8722;2.76&#8197;V vs. Fc/Fc+.







Abstract
Electrochemical CO2 reduction is a promising method for converting atmospheric CO2 into valuable low&#8208;carbon chemicals. In this study, a crystalline cadmium sulfide/amorphous cadmium hydroxide composite was successfully deposited on the carbon paper substrate surface by in&#8208;situ chemical bath deposition (named as c&#8208;CdS/a&#8208;Cd(OH)2/CP electrodes) for the efficient electrochemical CO2 reduction to produce CO. The c&#8208;CdS/a&#8208;Cd(OH)2/CP electrode exhibited high CO Faradaic efficiencies (&gt;90&#8201;%) under a wide potential window of 1.0&#8197;V, with the highest value reaching ~100&#8201;% at the applied potential ranging from &#8722;2.16&#8197;V to &#8722;2.46&#8197;V vs. ferrocene/ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+), superior to the crystalline counterpart c&#8208;CdS/CP and c&#8208;CdS/c&#8208;Cd(OH)2@CP electrodes. Meanwhile, the CO partial current density reached up to 154.7&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at &#8722;2.76&#8197;V vs. Fc/Fc+ on the c&#8208;CdS/a&#8208;Cd(OH)2/CP electrode. The excellent performance of this electrode was mainly ascribed to its special three&#8208;dimensional structure and the introduction of a&#8208;Cd(OH)2. These structures could provide more active sites, accelerate the charge transfer, and enhance adsorption of *COOH intermediates, thereby improving the CO selectivity. Moreover, the electrolytes consisting of 1&#8208;butyl&#8208;3&#8208;methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate and acetonitrile also enhanced the reaction kinetics of electrochemical CO2 reduction to CO.

         <title>Homochiral and Heterochiral Self&#8208;Sorting Assemblies of Antiaromatic Ni(II) Norcorrole Dimers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We found that covalently linked norcorrole dimers formed closely stacked assemblies based on the attractive interactions between antiaromatic &#960;&#8208;systems. The supramolecular assembling event of the norcorrole dimers occurred through high&#8208;fidelity chiral self&#8208;sorting. The subtle modification in the linking position and peripheral substituents resulted in complete change both in the structure of the aggregates and the chiral self&#8208;sorting mode.







Abstract
Recently, &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacked antiaromatic &#960;&#8208;systems have received considerable attention because they can exhibit stacked&#8208;ring aromaticity due to substantial intermolecular orbital interactions. Here, we report three antiaromatic norcorrole dimers that self&#8208;assemble to form supramolecular architectures through chiral self&#8208;sorting. A 2,2&#8217;&#8208;linked norcorrole dimer with 3,5&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butylphenyl groups forms a &#960;&#8208;stacked dimer both in solid and solution states via homochiral self&#8208;sorting. Its association constant in solution is (3.6&#177;1.7)&#215;105&#8197;M&#8722;1 at 20&#8201;&#176;C. In the solid state, 3,3&#8217;&#8208;linked norcorrole dimers with 3,5&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butylphenyl and phenyl groups afford macrocyclic and helical supramolecular assemblies via heterochiral and homochiral self&#8208;sorting, respectively. Notably, the subtle modification in the substituent resulted in a complete change in the structure of the aggregates and the chiral self&#8208;sorting mode. The present findings demonstrate that structural manipulation in antiaromatic monomer units leads to the formation of various supramolecular assemblies on the basis of the attractive interactions between antiaromatic &#960;&#8208;systems.

         <title>Heterocycle&#8208; and Amine&#8208;Free Electrochromic and Electrofluorochromic Molecules for Energy&#8208;Saving See&#8208;Through Smart Windows and Displays</title>

         <dc:description>
Two new electrochromes are synthesized by functionalizing tetrabenzofluorene core with acceptor units, without using heterocyclic rings and amine derivatives. These molecules can switch color from pale yellow to dark hues and also display electrofluorochromism. Smart windows fabricated using these electrochromes can store the injected energy and the stored energy can be reused to charge electronic gadgets.







Abstract
Electrochromic (EC) smart windows are an elegant alternative to dusty curtains, blinds, and traditional dimming devices. The EC energy storage smart windows and displays received remarkable attention in the optoelectronic industry as they hold promise for high energy efficiency, low power consumption, reversibility, and swift response to stimuli. However, achieving these properties remains challenging. Moreover, most EC molecules do not exhibit electrofluorochromism, which is highly essential for smart displays because its EC property can modulate the solar heat entering the building, and its electrofluorochromic (EFC) aspects can create lighting during the night. In this work, a structure&#8208;property relationship is utilized to develop new electrochromes that can store the injected charge, and these molecules indeed exhibit electrofluorochromism. The compounds are synthesized from tetrabenzofluorene with two aromatic acceptor units, and avoids the use of widely studied heterocycles and amine derivatives. The electrochromes switches from yellow to dark hue in solution, solid, and gel state. The compounds display exceptional electrochemical stability and reversibility in 1000 cycles and capacity retention of 93&#8211;100&#8201;% in 300 charging&#8208;discharging cycles. The proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept device fabrication of the self&#8208;dimming EC smart window presented here demonstrates that it can furnish visual comfort, modulate transmitted light and glare, and reduce energy usage.

         <title>Proton Domino Reactions at an Imidazole Relay Control the Oxidation of a TyrZ&#8208;His190 Artificial Mimic of Photosystem II</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer from an imidazole&#8208;phenol ligand to a covalently bound photooxidant was characterized. Upon oxidation of the phenol, the hydrogen&#8208;bonded imidazole accepts the phenolic proton and releases a proton from its 1&#8208;nitrogen group stabilizing the oxidized state. The system works with low driving force and closely mimics the Tyrz&#8208;His couple at the donor side of photosystem II.







Abstract
A close mimic of P680 and the TyrosineZ&#8208;Histidine190 pair in photosystem II (PS II) has been synthesized using a ruthenium chromophore and imidazole&#8208;phenol ligands. The intramolecular oxidation of the ligands by the photoproduced Ru(III) species is characterized by a small driving force, very similar to PS II where the complexity of kinetics was attributed to the reversibility of electron transfer steps. Laser flash photolysis revealed biphasic kinetics for ligand oxidation.

     alt="Proton Domino Reactions at an Imidazole Relay Control the Oxidation of a TyrZ-His190 Artificial Mimic of Photosystem II"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Proton-coupled electron transfer from an imidazole-phenol ligand to a covalently bound photooxidant was characterized. Upon oxidation of the phenol, the hydrogen-bonded imidazole accepts the phenolic proton and releases a proton from its 1-nitrogen group stabilizing the oxidized state. The system works with low driving force and closely mimics the Tyrz-His couple at the donor side of photosystem II.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A close mimic of P680 and the Tyrosine&lt;sub&gt;Z&lt;/sub&gt;-Histidine&lt;sub&gt;190&lt;/sub&gt; pair in photosystem II (PS II) has been synthesized using a ruthenium chromophore and imidazole-phenol ligands. The intramolecular oxidation of the ligands by the photoproduced Ru(III) species is characterized by a small driving force, very similar to PS II where the complexity of kinetics was attributed to the reversibility of electron transfer steps. Laser flash photolysis revealed biphasic kinetics for ligand oxidation. The fast phase (&lt;i&gt;&#964;&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;50&#8197;ns) corresponds to partial oxidation of the imidazole-phenol ligand, proton transfer within the hydrogen bond, and formation of a neutral phenoxyl radical. The slow phase (5&#8211;9&#8197;&#956;s) corresponds to full oxidation of the ligand which is kinetically controlled by deprotonation of the distant 1-nitrogen of the imidazolium. These results show that imidazole with its two protonatable sites plays a special role as a proton relay in a &#8216;proton domino&#8217; reaction.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Redox&#8208;Active Triazole&#8208;Derived Mesoionic Imines with Ferrocenyl Substituents and their Metal Complexes: Directed Hydrogen&#8208;Bonding, Unusual C&#8722;H Activation and Ion&#8208;Pair Formation</title>

The properties of redox&#8208;active MIIs and their metal complexes are shown to be strongly influenced by non&#8208;covalent interactions such as hydrogen&#8208;bonding and ion&#8208;pair formation.







Abstract
We present herein the synthesis, characterization and complexation of ferrocenyl&#8208;substituted MIIs (mesoionic imines) and their metal complexes. In the free MIIs, strong hydrogen bonding interactions are observed between the imine&#8208;N and the C&#8722;H bonds of the ferrocenyl substituents both in the solid state and in solution. The influence of this hydrogen bonding is so strong that complexation of the MIIs with [IrCp*Cl2]2 yields unique six&#8208;membered iridacycles via C&#8722;H&#8208;activation of the corresponding C&#8722;H&#8208;site at the Fc&#8208;substituent and not the Ph&#8208;substituent. This result is in contrast to previous reports in which always a preferential C&#8722;H activation at the phenyl substituent is observed in competitive reactions in the presence of ferrocenyl substituents. The corresponding Ir complexes formed after in&#8208;situ halide exchange reaction exist in either [Ir&#8722;I] contact or as [Ir]+I&#8722; solvent separated ion&#8208;pairs depending on the solvent polarity. The iodide coordinated and solvent separated ion&#8208;pairs display drastically different physical properties. The TEP (Tolman&#8208;electronic&#8208;parameter) of these ligands was determined and lines up with previously reported MII&#8208;ligands. The redox properties were investigated by a combination of electrochemical and spectroelectrochemical methods. We show here how non&#8208;covalent interactions can have a drastic influence on the physical and chemical properties of these new class of compounds.

         <title>Efficient Synthetic Access to Stable Isotope Labelled Pseudouridine Phosphoramidites for RNA NMR Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A perfect combination of nucleotide chemistry and enzyme catalysis. The work describes the efficient chemo&#8208;enzymatic production of stable isotope labeled RNA building blocks. The synthetic route outcompetes previously reported procedures and makes the production of stable isotope labeled pseudouridine RNA building blocks economically reasonable.







Abstract
Here we report the efficient synthetic access to 13C/15N&#8208;labelled pseudouridine phosphoramidites, which were incorporated into a binary H/ACA box guide RNA/product complex comprising 77 nucleotides (nts) in total and into a 75&#8197;nt E. coli tRNAGly. The stable isotope (SI) labelled pseudouridines were produced via a highly efficient chemo&#8208;enzymatic synthesis. 13C/15N labelled uracils were produced via chemical synthesis and enzymatically converted to pseudouridine 5&#8242;&#8208;monophosphate (&#936;MP) by using YeiN, a &#936;&#8208;5&#8242;&#8208;monophosphate C&#8208;glycosidase. Removal of the 5&#8242;&#8208;phosphate group yielded the desired pseudouridine nucleoside (&#936;), which was transformed into a phosphoramidite building suitable for RNA solid phase synthesis. A &#936; &#8208;building block carrying both a 13C and a 15N label was incorporated into a product RNA and the complex formation with a 63&#8197;nt H/ACA box RNA could be observed via NMR. Furthermore, the SI labelled pseudouridine building block was used to determine imino proton bulk water exchange rates of a 75&#8197;nt E. coli tRNAGly CCmnm5U, identifying the T&#936;C&#8208;loop 5&#8208;methyluridine as a modifier of the exchange rates. The efficient synthetic access to SI&#8208;labelled &#936; building blocks will allow the solution and solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopic studies of &#936; containing RNAs and will facilitate the mass spectrometric analysis of &#936;&#8208;modified nucleic acids.

         <title>Surface Engineering of the Mechanical Properties of Molecular Crystals via an Atomistic Model for Computing the Facet Stress Response of Solids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new atomistic model called MechaPredict uses DFT to predict the Young's modulus of crystal surfaces to within numerical accuracy. Within a computer, a crystal surface experiences mechanical stress leading to an accurate estimate of the surface mechanical properties. Crucially, unlike the existing experimental nanoindentation technique, which must be done serially on one crystal facet at a time, MechaPredict can perform multiple computations for multiple crystals and their facets. In the cover image, only one CPU core is being used, leaving the impression that the unused CPU cores can be used to perform additional high&#8208;throughput computations of dozens of crystal surfaces, saving time, effort and money in the quest for the discovery of new mechanically responsive molecular crystals. More information can be found in the Research Article by C.&#8197;C. Sun, S. Mohamed and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202400779).

Crucially, unlike the existing experimental nanoindentation technique, which must be done serially on one crystal facet at a time, MechaPredict can perform multiple computations for multiple crystals and their facets. In the cover image, only one CPU core is being used, leaving the impression that the unused CPU cores can be used to perform additional high-throughput computations of dozens of crystal surfaces, saving time, effort and money in the quest for the discovery of new mechanically responsive molecular crystals.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Organic Framework PCN&#8208;224 Combined Cobalt Oxide Nanoparticles for Hypoxia Relief and Synergistic Photodynamic/Chemodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We design and synthesize a tumor targeted nanoplatform (PCN&#8208;224@Co3O4&#8208;HA). HA can specifically target 4T1 cells and Co3O4 can produce oxygen in&#8197;situ to alleviate the hypoxic environment of the tumor. This nanosystem presents reliable biosafety performance, and can combine with PDT and CDT therapy to prevent the growth of tumor.







Abstract
Photodynamic therapy (PDT) and chemodynamic therapy (CDT) are promising tumor treatments mediated by reactive oxygen species (ROS), which have the advantages of being minimally invasive. However, the hypoxia of tumor microenvironment and poor target ability often reduce the therapeutic effect. Here we propose a tumor targeted nanoplatform PCN&#8208;224@Co3O4&#8208;HA for enhanced PDT and synergistic CDT, constructed by hyaluronate&#8208;modified Co3O4 nanoparticles decorated metal&#8208;organic framework PCN&#8208;224. Co3O4 can catalyze the decomposition of highly expressed H2O2 in tumor cells to produce oxygen and alleviate the problem of hypoxia. It can also produce hydroxyl radicals according to the Fenton&#8208;like reaction for chemical dynamic therapy, significantly improving the therapeutic effect. The cell survival experiment showed that after in&#8197;vitro treatment, 4T1 and MCF&#8208;7 cancer cells died in a large area under the anaerobic state, while the survival ability of normal cell L02 was nearly unchanged. This result effectively indicated that PCN&#8208;224@Co3O4&#8208;HA could effectively relieve tumor hypoxia and improve the effect of PDT and synergistic CDT. Cell uptake experiments showed that PCN&#8208;224@Co3O4&#8208;HA had good targeting properties and could effectively aggregate in tumor cells. In vivo experiments on mice, PCN&#8208;224@Co3O4&#8208;HA presented reliable biosafety performance, and can cooperate with PDT and CDT therapy to prevent the growth of tumor.

         <title>A Highly Sterically Encumbered Boron Lewis Acid Enabled by an Organotellurium&#8208;Based Ligand</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The new boron Lewis acid B[OTeF3(C6F5)2]3 combines one of the most sterically encumbered boron centres with a Lewis acidity comparable to that of B(C6F5)3. It additionally provides ligand transfer reactivity towards fluoride compounds as shown in the synthesis of an Au(III) complex and a hypervalent iodine species.







Abstract
Lewis acidic boron compounds are ubiquitous in chemistry due to their numerous applications, yet tuning and optimizing their properties towards different purposes is still a challenging field of research. In this work, the boron&#8208;based Lewis acid B[OTeF3(C6F5)2]3 was synthesized by reaction of the teflate derivative HOTeF3(C6F5)2 with BCl3 or BCl3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;SMe2. This new compound presents a remarkably high thermal stability up to 300&#8201;&#176;C, as well as one of the most sterically encumbered boron centres known in the literature. Theoretical and experimental methods revealed that B[OTeF3(C6F5)2]3 exhibits a comparable Lewis acidity to that of the well&#8208;known B(C6F5)3. The affinity of B[OTeF3(C6F5)2]3 towards pyridine was accessed by Isothermal Titration Calorimetry (ITC) and compared to that of B(OTeF5)3 and B(C6F5)3. The ligand&#8208;transfer reactivity of this new boron compound towards different fluorides was demonstrated by the formation of an anionic Au(III) complex and a hypervalent iodine(III) species.

         <title>A Mechanistic Spectrum of O&#8722;H Bond Cleavage Observed for Reactions of Phenols with a Manganese Superoxo Complex</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reactions of MnIII(BDPBrP)(O2&#8901;) (1) with Me2NPhOH and NO2PhOH at &#8722;80&#8201;&#176;C proceed via concerted proton electron transfer (CPET) and proton transfer (PT) to produce MnIII(BDPBrP)(OOH) (2) and [MnIV(BDPBrP)(OOH)]+ (3), respectively. Intriguingly, two routes of CPET and sequential PT and electron transfer (ET) were invoked for the reactions of 1 with ClPhOH and MeOPhOH to ultimately generate 2.







Abstract
Reaction of a rare and well&#8208;characterized MnIII&#8208;superoxo species, Mn(BDPBrP)(O2&#8901;) (1, H2BDPBrP=2,6&#8208;bis((2&#8208;(S)&#8208;di(4&#8208;bromo)phenylhydroxylmethyl&#8208;1&#8208;pyrrolidinyl)methyl)pyridine), with 4&#8208;dimethylaminophenol at &#8722;80&#8201;&#176;C proceeds via concerted proton electron transfer (CPET) to produce a MnIII&#8208;hydroperoxo complex, Mn(BDPBrP)(OOH) (2), alongside 4&#8208;dimethylaminophenoxy radical; whereas, upon treatment with 4&#8208;nitrophenol, complex 1 undergoes a proton transfer process to afford a MnIV&#8208;hydroperoxo complex, [Mn(BDPBrP)(OOH)]+ (3). Intriguingly, the reactions of 1 with 4&#8208;chlorophenol and 4&#8208;methoxyphenol follow two routes of CPET and sequential proton and electron transfer to furnish complex 2 in the end. UV&#8208;vis and EPR spectroscopic studies coupled with DFT calculations provided support for this wide mechanistic spectrum of activating various phenol O&#8722;H bonds by a single MnIII&#8208;superoxo complex, 1.

         <title>Exploration of Vitamin B6&#8208;Based Redox&#8208;Active Pyridinium Salts Towards the Application in Aqueous Organic Flow Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of novel redox&#8208;active benzoyl pyridinium salts was prepared from pyridoxal hydrochloride. Cyclic voltammetry studies demonstrated redox reversibility under basic conditions with the redox wave corresponding to a two&#8208;electron process. Under the bulk electrolysis conditions, the reduction via consecutive electron transfer (ET) and proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET) follows by a proton transfer (PT) to give the secondary alcohol product.







Abstract
Pyridoxal hydrochloride, a vitamin B6 vitamer, was synthetically converted to a series of diverse redox&#8208;active benzoyl pyridinium salts. Cyclic voltammetry studies demonstrated redox reversibility under basic conditions, and two of the most promising salts were subjected to laboratory&#8208;scale flow battery tests involving galvanostatic cycling at 10&#8197;mM in 0.1&#8197;M NaOH. In these tests, the battery was charged completely, corresponding to the transfer of two electrons to the electrolyte, but no discharge was observed. Both CV analysis and electrochemical simulations confirmed that the redox wave observed in the experimental voltammograms corresponds to a two&#8208;electron process. To explain the irreversibility in the battery tests, we conducted bulk electrolysis with the benzoyl pyridinium salts, affording the corresponding benzylic secondary alcohols. Computational studies suggest that the reduction proceeds in three consecutive steps: first electron transfer (ET), then proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET) and finally proton transfer (PT) to give the secondary alcohol. 1H&#8197;NMR deuterium exchange studies indicated that the last PT step is not reversible in 0.1&#8197;M NaOH, rendering the entire redox process irreversible. The apparent reversibility observed in CV at the basic media likely arises from the slow rate of the PT step at the timescale of the measurement.

         <title>Solvent&#8208;Free Mechanosynthesis of Oligopeptides by Coupling Peptide Segments of Different Lengths &#8211; Elucidating the Role of Cesium Carbonate in Ball Mill Processes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present a concept inspired by playing with blocks, in which it is possible to construct various objects from segments (blocks) of different sizes and lengths. An attempt is made to explain the mechanism of coupling reaction in a ball mill in the presence of cesium carbonate. The usefulness of the method in the synthesis of oligopeptides has been proven.







Abstract
We report an idea for the synthesis of oligopeptides using a solvent&#8208;free ball milling approach. Our concept is inspired by block play, in which it is possible to construct different objects using segments (blocks) of different sizes and lengths. We prove that by having a library of short peptides and employing the ball mill mechanosynthesis (BMMS) method, peptides can be easily coupled to form different oligopeptides with the desired functional and biological properties. Optimizing the BMMS process we found that the best yields we obtained when TBTU and cesium carbonate were used as reagents. The role of Cs2CO3 in the coupling mechanism was followed on each stage of synthesis by 1H, 13C and 133Cs NMR employing Magic Angle Spinning (MAS) techniques. It was found that cesium carbonate acts not only as a base but is also responsible for the activation of substrates and intermediates. The unique information about the BMMS mechanism is based on the analysis of 2D NMR data. The power of BMMS is proved by the example of different peptide combinations, 2+2, 3+2, 4+2, 5+2 and 4+4. The tetra&#8208;, penta&#8208;, hexa&#8208;, hepta&#8208; and octapeptides obtained under this project were fully characterized by MS and NMR techniques.

         <title>Photo/Mechanical/Acidic Multi&#8208;Stimuli Responses and Information Encryption Design of Acylhydrazone Derivative</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three polymorphs of acylhydrazone derivative are prepared, the mechanisms of their photo/mechanical/acidic multi&#8208;stimuli responses are investigated, and an information encryption system based on photochromism and acidochromism is developed.







Abstract
Stimuli&#8208;responsive crystalline materials have received much attention for being potential candidates of smart materials. However, the occurrence of polymorphism&#8208;driven stimuli responses in crystalline materials remains interesting but rare. Herein, three polymorphs of an acylhydrazone derivative, N&#8242;&#8208;[(E)&#8208;(1&#8208;benzofuran&#8208;2&#8208;yl) methylidene] pyridine &#8722;4&#8208;carbohydrazide (BFMP) were prepared. Form&#8208;1 undergoes a photomechanical response via E&#8594;Z photoisomerization under UV irradiation, accompanied by a decrease in fluorescence intensity and a change from colorless to yellow. Two types of Z&#8594;E thermal isomerization mechanisms with significant differences in conversion rate were observed at different temperatures in form&#8208;1. The solid&#8208;melt&#8208;solid transition has a faster conversion rate compared to the solid&#8208;solid transition due to freedom from lattice confinement. The transition from form&#8208;2 to form&#8208;3 can be achieved under grinding, coupled with a significant decrease in fluorescence intensity. The similar molecular stacking pattern of form&#8208;2 and form&#8208;3 provides a structural basis for the grinding&#8208;induced crystalline transition behavior. In addition, the presence of the pyridine moiety imparts an acidochromic property. The combination of photochromism and acidochromism explores the possible applications of acylhydrazone derivatives in information encryption.

         <title>Ni Single Atom Decorated Porous Hollow Carbon Nanosphere&#8208;Based Electrodes for High Performance Symmetric Solid&#8208;State Supercapacitors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study describes the synthesis of Ni single atom containing N&#8208;doped porous hollow carbon nanospheres and explores its supercapacitive properties. An optimized Ni doping, surface area and graphitization improves its electrical conductivity leading to superior charge storage performance. It displays remarkable capacitance with outstanding energy and power density and long cycle life.







Abstract
Ni single atom containing hollow carbon nanospheres with nitrogen doping has been synthesized by carbonization of Ni(NO3)2/phloroglucinol&#8208;formaldehyde polymer/silica composite. The samples have been characterized by powder X&#8208;ray diffraction, nitrogen adsorption/desorption, electron microscopic, Raman and X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopic studies. The microstructure and surface area vary with the amount of Ni(NO3)2 employed in the syntheses and the carbonization environment. An optimized amount of nickel and argon as the carbonization gas afford Ni&#8208;1.0@N@HCN&#8208;Ar which possesses overall superior features. The uniformly dispersed Ni single atoms within the hollow porous carbon framework fully utilize all the electroactive sites thereby improving the supercapacitive performance. The specific capacitance of Ni&#8208;1.0@N@HCN&#8208;Ar reaches 777&#8197;F&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 with a Coulombic efficiency of 98.4&#8201;% and excellent recyclability. The energy and power density of Ni&#8208;1.0@N@HCN&#8208;Ar are found to be high; at 1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 its energy density is 155.4&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 with a power density of 600.3&#8197;W&#8201;kg&#8722;1. At a high current density of 10&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 the material shows a high energy density of 118.4&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 with excellent power density of 6003.4&#8197;W&#8201;kg&#8722;1. A symmetric solid&#8208;state supercapacitor assembled with this material, Ni&#8208;1.0@N@HCN&#8208;Ar//Ni&#8208;1.0@N@HCN&#8208;Ar using H2SO4/PVA gel electrolyte shows a superior energy density value of 30&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 at a power density of 1200&#8197;W&#8201;kg&#8722;1.

At a high current density of 10&#8197;A&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; the material shows a high energy density of 118.4&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; with excellent power density of 6003.4&#8197;W&#8201;kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. A symmetric solid-state supercapacitor assembled with this material, &lt;b&gt;Ni-1.0@N@HCN-Ar//Ni-1.0@N@HCN-Ar&lt;/b&gt; using H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;/PVA gel electrolyte shows a superior energy density value of 30&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at a power density of 1200&#8197;W&#8201;kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>
