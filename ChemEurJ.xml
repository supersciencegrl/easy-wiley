      <title>Alkyl Chain Length&#8208; and Polymorph&#8208;Dependent photomechanochromic fluorescence of anthracene photodimerization in molecular crystals: roles of the lattice stiffness</title>
      <dc:description>An anthracene&#8208;pentiptycene hybrid system ( 1&#8208;C n  , where n  refers to the number of carbon atom in the linear alkyl chain) crystalizes in three different polymorphs, called Y (yellow), G (green), and B (blue) forms in terms of the fluorescence color. While all the Y&#8208;form crystals perform the same yellow&#8208;to&#8208;blue fluorescence color responses to the photomechanical stress generated by the antrhacene [4+4] photodimerization reaction, the four G forms display distinct photomechanofluorochromism (PMFC): namely, from green to blue for G&#8208;1&#8208;C4  , to orange for G&#8208;1&#8208;C7  , to red for G&#8208;1&#8208;C8  , and to red then blue for G&#8208;1&#8208;C9  , and there is no photochromic activity for the B forms. The intriguing RGB three&#8208;color PMFC and the abnormal topochemical reactivity of G&#8208;1&#8208;C9 are attributed to an inherent softness of the crystal lattice.</dc:description>

      <title>Homochiral Covalent Organic Frameworks for Asymmetric Catalysis</title>
      <dc:description>Owing to their permanent porosity, high&#8208;ordered and extended structure, good chemical stability and tuneability, covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have emerged as a new type of organic materials that can offer various applications in different fields. Benefiting from the huge database of organic reactions, the required functionality of COFs can be readily achieved by modification of the corresponding organic functional groups on either polymerizable monomers or established COF frameworks. This striking feature allows us to reasonably design and synthesize homochiral COFs (HCCOFs), furthermore, use them as a unique platform to fabricate asymmetric catalysts. This contribution provides an overview of new progress in HCCOFs&#8208;based asymmetric catalysis, including design, synthesis and their application in asymmetric organic synthesis. Moreover, major challenges and developing trends in this field are also discussed.

      <title>Meticulous Doxorubicin Release from pH&#8208;responsive Nanoparticles Entrapped within an Injectable Thermoresponsive Depot.</title>
      <dc:description>The dual stimuli&#8208;controlled release of doxorubicin from gel&#8208;embedded nanoparticles is reported. Non&#8208;cytotoxic polymer nanoparticles are formed from poly(ethylene glycol)&#8208;  b  &#8208;poly(benzyl glutamate) that, uniquely, contain a central ester link. This connection renders the nanoparticles pH&#8208;responsive, enabling extensive doxorubicin release in acidic solutions (pH 6.5), but not in solutions of physiological pH (pH 7.4). Doxorubicin loaded nanoparticles were found to be stable for at least 31 days and lethal against the three breast cancer cell lines tested. Furthermore, doxorubicin loaded nanoparticles could be incorporated within a thermoresponsive poly(2&#8208;hydroxypropyl methacrylate) gel depot, which forms immediately upon injection of poly(2&#8208;hydroxypropyl methacrylate) in DMSO solution into aqueous solution. The combination of the poly(2&#8208;hydroxypropyl methacrylate) gel and poly(ethylene glycol)&#8208;  b  &#8208;poly(benzyl glutamate) nanoparticles yields an injectable doxorubicin delivery system that facilities near&#8208;complete drug release when maintained at elevated temperatures (37 &#176;C) in acidic solution (pH 6.5). In contrast, negligible payload release occurs when the material is stored at room temperature in non&#8208;acidic solution (pH 7.4).

      <title>Toward understanding the enhanced pseudocapacitive storage in 3D SnS/MXene architecture enabled by engineered surface reactions</title>
      <dc:description>The optimization of three&#8208;dimensional (3D) MXene&#8208;based electrodes with desired electrochemical performances is highly demanded. Here, we report a precursor&#8208;guided strategy for fabricating 3D SnS/MXene architecture with tiny SnS nanocrystals (~ 5 nm in size) covalently decorated on wrinkled Ti3C2Tx nanosheets via Ti&#8208;S bonds (denoted as SnS/Ti3C2Tx&#8208;O). The formation of Ti&#8208;S bonds between SnS and Ti3C2Tx was confirmed by extended X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS). Rather than bulky SnS plates decorated on Ti3C2Tx (SnS/Ti3C2Tx&#8208;H) by one&#8208;step hydrothermal sulfidation followed by post annealing, our SnS/Ti3C2Tx&#8208;O presents size&#8208;dependent structural and dynamic properties. The as&#8208;formed 3D hierarchical structure can provide short ion&#8208;diffusion pathways and electron transport distance because of more accessible surface sites. In addition, benefiting from the tiny SnS nanocrystals that can effectively improve Na+ diffusion and suppress structural variation upon charge/discharge processes, our as&#8208;obtained SnS/Ti3C2Tx&#8208;O can generate pseudocapacitance&#8208;dominated storage behavior enabled by engineered surface reactions. As predicted, this electrode exhibits enhanced Na storage capacity of 565 mAh g&#8208;1 at 0.1 A g&#8208;1 after 75 cycles, outperforming SnS/Ti3C2Tx&#8208;H (336 mAh g&#8208;1), SnS (212 mAh g&#8208;1) and Ti3C2Tx (104 mAh g&#8208;1) electrodes.</dc:description>

      <title>Rational Design of Azothiophenes &#8211; Substitution Effects on the Switching Properties</title>
      <dc:description>A series of substituted azothiophenes was prepared and investigated toward their isomerization behavior.

      <title>Synthesis, Photophysical and Electronic Properties of Mono&#8208;, Di&#8208;, Tri&#8208;Amino&#8208;Substituted Ortho&#8208;Perylenes, and Comparison to the Tetra&#8208;Substituted Derivative</title>
      <dc:description>We synthesized a series of new mono&#8208;, di&#8208;, tri&#8208; and tetra&#8208;substituted perylene derivatives with strong bis(  para  &#8208;methoxyphenyl)amine (DPA) donors at the uncommon 2,5,8,11&#8208;positions. The properties of our new donor&#8208;substituted perylenes were studied in detail to establish a structure&#8208;property relationship. Interesting trends and unusual properties are observed for this series of new perylene derivatives, such as a decreasing charge transfer (CT) character with increasing number of DPA moieties and individual reversible oxidations for each DPA moiety. Thus,  (DPA)&#8208;Per  possesses one reversible oxidation while  (DPA)  4  &#8208;Per  has four. The mono&#8208; and di&#8208;substituted derivatives display unusually large Stokes shifts not previously reported for perylenes. Furthermore, transient absorption measurements of the new derivatives reveal an excited state with lifetimes of several hundred microseconds, which sensitizes singlet oxygen with quantum yields of up to 0.83.</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;We synthesized a series of new mono&#8208;, di&#8208;, tri&#8208; and tetra&#8208;substituted perylene derivatives with strong bis(  para  &#8208;methoxyphenyl)amine (DPA) donors at the uncommon 2,5,8,11&#8208;positions. The properties of our new donor&#8208;substituted perylenes were studied in detail to establish a structure&#8208;property relationship. Interesting trends and unusual properties are observed for this series of new perylene derivatives, such as a decreasing charge transfer (CT) character with increasing number of DPA moieties and individual reversible oxidations for each DPA moiety. Thus,  (DPA)&#8208;Per  possesses one reversible oxidation while  (DPA)  4  &#8208;Per  has four. The mono&#8208; and di&#8208;substituted derivatives display unusually large Stokes shifts not previously reported for perylenes. Furthermore, transient absorption measurements of the new derivatives reveal an excited state with lifetimes of several hundred microseconds, which sensitizes singlet oxygen with quantum yields of up to 0.83.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Modulation of Self&#8208;Separating Molecular Catalysts for Highly Efficient Biomass Transformations</title>
      <dc:description>The energetically viable fabrication of stable and highly efficient solid acid catalysts is one of the key steps in the large&#8208;scale transformation processes of biomass resources. Herein, we report the covalent modification of the classical Dawson polyoxometalate (POMs) with sulphonic acids (&#8210;SO3H) by grafting the sulfonic acid groups on the POM&#8217;s surface followed by oxidation of (3&#8208;Mercaptopropyl)trimethoxysilane. The acidity of TBA6&#8208;P2W17&#8208;SO3H (TBA = tetrabutyl ammonium) has been demonstrated using 31P.NMR, clearly indicating the presence of strong Br&#248;nsted acid sites. The presence of TBA counterions renders the solid acid catalyst as a promising candidate for phase transfer catalytic processes. The TBA6&#8208;P2W17&#8208;SO3H shows remarkable activity and selectivity, excellent stability and great substrate compatibility for the esterification of free fatty acids (FFA) with methanol and conversion into biodiesel at 70 &#176;C with &gt;98% conversion of oleic acid in 20 min. The excellent catalytic performance can be attributed to the formation of a catalytically active emulsion, which results in a uniform catalytic behavior during the reaction leading to efficient interaction between the substrate and the active sites of the catalyst. Most importantly, the catalyst can be easily recovered and reused without any loss of its catalytic activity due to its excellent phase transfer properties. This work offers an efficient and cost&#8208;effective strategy for large scale biomass conversion applications.</dc:description>

      <title>Tetracationic Bis&#8208;Triarylborane 1,3&#8208;Butadiyne as a Combined Fluorimetric and Raman Probe for Simultaneous and Selective Sensing of Various DNA, RNA, and Proteins</title>
      <dc:description>
Got the link? Linking two dicationic triarylborane units by Raman&#8208;responsive 1,3&#8208;butadiyne yielded a triple&#8208;action probe: fluorimetric and SERS sensing of ds&#8208;DNA, RNA and proteins, as well as circular dichroism sensing of ss&#8208;RNA (see figure).







Abstract
A bis&#8208;triarylborane tetracation (4&#8208;Ar2B&#8208;3,5&#8208;Me2C6H2)&#8208;C&#8801;C&#8722;C&#8801;C&#8208;(3,5&#8208;Me2C6H2&#8208;4&#8208;BAr2 [Ar=(2,6&#8208;Me2&#8208;4&#8208;NMe3&#8208;C6H2)+] (24+) shows distinctly different behaviour in its fluorimetric response than that of our recently published bis&#8208;triarylborane 5&#8208;(4&#8208;Ar2B&#8208;3,5&#8208;Me2C6H2)&#8208;2,2&#8242;&#8208;(C4H2S)2&#8211;5&#8242;&#8208;(3,5&#8208;Me2C6H2&#8208;4&#8208;BAr2) (34+). Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction data on the neutral bis&#8208;triarylborane precursor 2&#8201;N confirm its rod&#8208;like dumbbell structure, which is shown to be important for DNA/RNA targeting and also for BSA protein binding. Fluorimetric titrations with DNA/RNA/BSA revealed the very strong affinity of 24+ and indicated the importance of the properties of the linker connecting the two triarylboranes. Using the butadiyne rather than a bithiophene linker resulted in an opposite emission effect (quenching vs. enhancement), and 24+ bound to BSA 100&#8197;times stronger than 34+. Moreover, 24+ interacted strongly with ss&#8208;RNA, and circular dichroism (CD) results suggest ss&#8208;RNA chain&#8208;wrapping around the rod&#8208;like bis&#8208;triarylborane dumbbell structure like a thread around a spindle, a very unusual mode of binding of ss&#8208;RNA with small molecules. Furthermore, 24+ yielded strong Raman/SERS signals, allowing DNA or protein detection at ca. 10&#8197;nm concentrations. The above observations, combined with low cytotoxicity, efficient human cell uptake and organelle&#8208;selective accumulation make such compounds intriguing novel lead structures for bio&#8208;oriented, dual fluorescence/Raman&#8208;based applications.

Highly&#8208;reduced Ni pre&#8208;catalyst: Dilithiumbis(cyloocta&#8208;1,5&#8208;diene)nickelate(&#8722;II) enables the hydrogenation of C=C double bonds. The mild conditions tolerate various functional groups. Mechanistic studies, including reaction progress analyses, poisoning experiments, and multinuclear NMR monitoring, indicate that the molecular Ni&#8722;II complex is a precursor to a heterotopic Ni nanoparticle catalyst.







Abstract
The hydrogenation of olefins, styrenes, enoates, imines, and sterically hindered tri&#8208;substituted olefins was accomplished using the pre&#8208;catalyst dilithiumbis(cycloocta&#8208;1,5&#8208;diene)nickelate(&#8722;II) (1). The mild conditions tolerate hydroxyl, halide, ester, and lactone functionalities. Mechanistic studies, including reaction progress analyses, poisoning experiments, and multinuclear NMR monitoring, indicate that a heterotopic (nickel nanoparticle) catalyst is in operation.

      <title>A Sequential Umpolung/Enzymatic Dynamic Kinetic Resolution Strategy for the Synthesis of &#947;&#8208;Lactones</title>
      <dc:description>
Value guarantee: Herein we report the development of a two&#8208;step&#8208;one&#8208;pot synthesis of &#947;&#8208;lactones through the unification of a robust NHC&#8208;catalyzed Stetter reaction with a ketoreductase&#8208;catalyzed dynamic kinetic resolution, reduction, and cyclization.

Abstract
Combining biological and small&#8208;molecule catalysts under a chemoenzymatic manifold presents a series of significant advantages to the synthetic community. We report herein the successful development of a two&#8208;step/single flask synthesis of &#947;&#8208;lactones through the merger of Umpolung catalysis with a ketoreductase&#8208;catalyzed dynamic kinetic resolution, reduction, and cyclization. This combined approach delivers highly enantio&#8208; and diastereoenriched heterocycles and demonstrates the feasibility of integrating NHC catalysis with enzymatic processes.

      <title>A Mechanistic Dichotomy in Two&#8208;Electron Reduction of Dioxygen Catalyzed by N,N&#8217;&#8208;Dimethylated Porphyrin Isomers</title>
      <dc:description>Selective two&#8208;electron reduction of dioxygen (O  2  ) to hydrogen peroxide (H  2  O  2  ) has been achieved by two saddle&#8208;distorted  N  ,  N  &#8217;&#8208;dimethylated porphyrin isomers, an  N  21,  N  &#8217;22&#8208;dimethylated porphyrin (  anti  &#8208;Me  2  P  ) and an  N  21,  N  &#8217;23&#8208;dimethylated porphyrin (  syn  &#8208;Me  2  P  ) as catalysts and ferrocene derivatives as electron donors in the presence of protic acids in acetonitrile. The higher catalytic performance in an oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) was achieved by  anti  &#8208;Me  2  P  with higher turnover number (TON = 250 for 30 min) than that by  syn  &#8208;Me  2  P  (TON = 218 for 60 min). The reactive intermediates in the catalytic ORR were confirmed to be the corresponding isophlorins (  anti  &#8208;Me  2  Iph  or  syn  &#8208;Me  2  Iph  ) by spectroscopic measurements. The rate&#8208;determining step in the catalytic ORRs was concluded to be proton&#8208;coupled electron&#8208;transfer reduction of O  2  with isophlorins based on kinetic analysis. The ORR rate by  anti  &#8208;Me  2  Iph  was accelerated by external protons, judging from the dependence of the observed initial rates on acid concentrations. In contrast, no acceleration of the ORR rate with  syn  &#8208;Me  2  Iph  by external protons was observed. The different mechanisms in the O  2  reduction by the two isomers should be derived from that of the arrangement of hydrogen bonding of a O  2  with inner N  H  protons of the isophlorins.</dc:description>

      <title>Converting Poly(Methyl Methacrylate) into a Triple&#8208;Responsive Polymer</title>
      <dc:description>
Making PMMA responsive: PMMA can be converted into a triple&#8208;responsive polymer, being responsive to temperature, pH and CO2 gas, by a quantitative post&#8208;polymerization amidation with N,N&#8208;diethylethylenediamine. This will open access to a large variety of responsive macromolecular architectures, because this method can be applied to PMMA and PMMA&#8208;based block copolymers, being easily accessible by living anionic or controlled radical polymerization (see scheme).







Abstract
Multiresponsive polymers that can respond to several external stimuli are promising materials for a manifold of applications. Herein, a facile method for the synthesis of triple&#8208;responsive (pH, temperature, CO2) poly(N,N&#8208;diethylaminoethyl methacrylamide) by a post&#8208;polymerization amidation of poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) is presented. Combined with trivalent counterions ([Fe(CN)6]3&#8722;) both an upper and lower critical solution temperature (UCST/LCST)&#8208;type phase behavior can be realized at pH&#8197;8 and 9. PMMA and PMMA&#8208;based block copolymers are readily accessible by living anionic and controlled radical polymerization techniques, which opens access to various responsive polymer architectures based on the developed functionalization method. This method can also be applied on melt&#8208;processed bulk PMMA samples to introduce functional, responsive moieties at the PMMA surface.

      <title>Shape&#8208;selective Targeting on RNA Bulges by Peptidomimetic Metallohelices</title>
      <dc:description>RNA bulges represent one of the most common motifs in RNA secondary structure and serve in a variety of biological functions. Compounds stabilizing RNA bulges are important for probing RNA structure and function and therapy of some diseases. Here, we investigated the ability of a series of enantiomeric pairs of optically pure bimetallic metallohelices with different flexible linkers to target various RNA bulges. The results show that binding affinities of the metallohelices to bulged RNA differ and strongly depend on the size of the bulge and the base composition of the bulge loop. Notably, the shorter, more compact, and less flexible metallohelices bind to RNA bulges most efficiently and selectively. Interestingly, the ability of the metallohelices to bind to RNA bulges correlates with their previously reported antimicrobial activity, which suggests that the selective recognition of bulged regions in RNA by the metallohelices might also contribute to their biological activity.</dc:description>

      <title>Multinuclear Pt(II) Complexes: Why Three is Better Than Two to Enhance Photophysical Properties</title>

      <title>Photocytotoxicity of Oligothienyl&#8208;functionalized Chelates that Sensitize LnIII Luminescence and Generate 1O2</title>
      <dc:description>Three new compounds containing a heptadentate lanthanide (LnIII) ion chelator functionalized with oligothiophenes,  nThept(COOH)4 ( n  =  1 ,  2, or  3 ), were isolated. Their LnIII complexes not only display the characteristic metal&#8208;centred emission in the visible or near&#8208;infrared (NIR) but also generate singlet oxygen (1O2). Luminescence efficiencies (&#981;Ln) for [Eu 1Thept(COO)4]&#8208; and [Eu 2Thept(COO)4]&#8208; are &#981;Eu = 3% and 0.5% in TRIS buffer and 33% and 3% in 95% ethanol, respectively.  3Thept(COO)44&#8208; does not sensitize EuIII emission due to its low&#8208;lying triplet state. NIR luminescence is observed for all NIR&#8208;emitting LnIII and ligands with efficiencies of &#981;Yb = 0.002%, 0.005% and 0.04% for [Yb nThept(COO)4]&#8208; ( n  =  1, 2, or 3), and &#981;Nd = 0.0007%, 0.002% and 0.02% for [Nd nThept(COO)4]&#8208; ( n  =  1, 2, or 3) in TRIS buffer. In 95% ethanol, quantum yields of NIR luminescence increase and are &#981;Yb = 0.5%, 0.31% and 0.05% for [Yb nThept(COO)4]&#8208; ( n  =  1, 2, or  3 ), and &#981;Nd = 0.40%, 0.45% and 0.12% for [Nd nThept(COO)4]&#8208; ( n  =  1 ,  2 , or  3 ). All complexes are capable of generating 1O2 in 95% ethanol with &#981;1&#927;2 efficiencies which range from 2% to 29%. These complexes are toxic to HeLa cells when irradiated with UV light (&#955;exc = 365 nm) for 2 minutes. IC50 values for the LnIII complexes are in the range 15.2 &#8211; 16.2 &#956;M; the most potent compound is [Nd 2Thept(COO)4]&#8208;. The cell death mechanisms are further explored using an Annexin V &#8211; propidium iodide assay which suggests that cell death occurs through both apoptosis and necrosis.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>
Second&#8208;coordination sphere effects can have varying roles in enzymatic reaction mechanisms and drive the reaction to alternative pathways. In this review, based on extensive computational studies on heme and nonheme iron dioxygenases, several main second&#8208;coordination sphere effects are identified that determine substrate activation and product distribution. These range from substrate and oxidant positioning in the active site to guide a reaction specificity. Moreover, perturbations through local hydrogen&#8208;bonding interactions and salt bridges from the local environment as well as charge stabilization can affect the local charge and spin distributions of the oxidant and substrate and give the enzyme its selectivity. For more information see the review on page&#8197;5308&#8197;ff. by S.&#8197;P. de&#8197;Visser.

      <title>Frontispiece: Use of Dithiasuccinoyl&#8208;Caged Amines Enables COS/H2S Release Lacking Electrophilic Byproducts</title>
      <dc:description>
The thiol&#8208;mediated reduction of dithiasuccinoyl groups was harnessed to develop a method for controlled carbonyl sulfide (COS) generation under buffered aqueous conditions. This reactivity generates two equivalents of COS and does not result in formation of electrophilic byproducts such as (imino)quinone methides. The rate of COS generation can be tuned as function of amine identity, and theoretical investigations provide key insights into COS release from thiocarbamate intermediates.

      <title>Cover Feature: BODIPYs as Chemically Stable Fluorescent Tags for Synthetic Glycosylation Strategies towards Fluorescently Labeled Saccharides (Chem. Eur. J. 24/2020)</title>
      <dc:description>
Chemically robust, fluorescent boron&#8208;dipyrromethene (BODIPY) dyes can be employed as aglycons in the synthesis of fluorescently&#8208;labeled oligosaccharides. They withstand the reaction conditions commonly used in these protocols: glycosylation and protecting&#8208;group manipulations. Additionally, the BODIPY aglycon plays a dual role as: i)&#8197;a glycosyl tag facilitating the visualization of the intermediate saccharides; and ii)&#8197;as the fluorescent label in the target saccharide. The cover artwork was kindly created by Guillermo Corrales. More information can be found in the Full Paper by J. Ba&#241;uelos, A.&#8197;M. G&#243;mez, J.&#8197;C.

      <title>Cover Feature: pH&#8208;Dependent Hydration Change in a Gd&#8208;Based MRI Contrast Agent with a Phosphonated Ligand (Chem. Eur. J. 24/2020)</title>
      <dc:description>
A phosphonated podand&#8208;type ligand forms very stable complexes with lanthanide cations, which change their coordination environment from a nonadentate dihydrated complex at acidic pH to an octadentate monohydrated one at basic pH. This hydration change around neutral pH is governed by the formation of a proton bridge between two phosphonate functions and is correlated to an almost two&#8208;fold enhancement of the relaxivity (wavy curve of the cover) in the case of the Gadolinium complex.

Aromaticity has attracted continuous attention from both experimentalists and theoreticians for many decades. Although planar M&#246;bius aromaticity was confirmed in metallapentalenes, the aromaticity of metallapentalenes containing heteroatoms (such as B, N, and O) is rarely investigated.

      <title>Second&#8208;Coordination Sphere Effects on Selectivity and Specificity of Heme and Nonheme Iron Enzymes</title>
      <dc:description>
Coordination sphere effects: Metalloenzymes have important functions in chemical biology and oxygen activating ones participate in biosynthesis and biodegradation reactions in biosystems. Often these reactions are stereospecific or regioselective owing the specific long&#8208; or midrange interactions from the second&#8208;coordination sphere. In this review paper an overview is given of the types of second&#8208;coordination sphere effects in iron&#8208;containing enzymes.







Abstract
Mononuclear iron&#8208;containing enzymes are highly versatile oxidants that often react stereospecifically and/or regioselectively with substrates. Combined experimental and computational studies on heme monooxygenases, nonheme iron dioxygenases and halogenases have revealed the intricate details of the second&#8208;coordination sphere, which determine this specificity and selectivity. These second&#8208;coordination sphere effects originate from the positioning of the substrate and oxidant, which involve the binding of the co&#8208;factors and substrate into the active site of the protein. In addition, some enzymes affect the selectivity and reactivity through charge&#8208;stabilization from nearby bound cations/anions, an induced electric field or through the positioning of salt bridges and hydrogen&#8208;bonding interactions to first&#8208;coordination sphere iron ligands and/or the substrate. Examples of all of these second&#8208;coordination sphere effects in iron&#8208;containing enzymes and how these influence structure and reactivity are given.

      <dc:description>
Janus graphene nanosheets with hydroxyl groups on one side and fluorine atoms on the other have been prepared by the team at RCPTM Olomouc (Czechia) by a simple nucleophilic substitution reaction of fluorographene in a biphasic aqueous&#8208;organic system. The graphene derivative interacts with polar water via hydroxyl groups, while it faces its fluorine atoms to nonpolar solvents. More information can be found in the Full Paper by M.

      <title>Fundamental Insights into the Covalent Silane Functionalization of NiFe Layered Double Hydroxides</title>
      <dc:description>
Layered double hydroxides (LDHs) have attracted enormous attention due to their outstanding energy applications. Although these materials have been intensively investigated, some fundamental aspects of their chemistry remain elusive for the scientific community. This work explores the covalent functionalization with (3&#8208;aminopropyl)trietoxysilanes of a NiFe&#8208;LDH, widely known for its excellent electrochemical properties. The influence of the covalent grafting on its structure, morphology, magnetism, adsorptive properties, and electrochemical behavior is fully addressed, paving the way to the synthesis of new hybrid materials and architectures.

      <title>Bromine&#8208;Functionalized Covalent Organic Frameworks for Efficient Triboelectric Nanogenerator</title>
      <dc:description>
The Bro code: A 2D electron withdrawing bromine functionalized covalent organic frameworks (COFs) was constructed and served as the first example for fabricating a triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) device.







Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) enable precise integration of various organic building blocks into porous skeletons through topology predesign. Here, we report the first example of COFs by integrating electron withdrawing bromine group onto the skeletons for triboelectric nanogenerators (TENG). The resulting framework exhibits high surface area and good crystallinity. Thus, the bromine functionalized COF has more regular aligned &#960; columns and arrays over the skeleton than bare COFs, which in turn significantly enhances charge transport ability. As a result, bromine functionalized COFs showed higher electrical output performance at 5&#8197;Hz with a peak value of short circuit current density of 43.6&#8197;&#956;A and output voltage of 416&#8197;V, which is 2 and 1.3&#8197;times higher than those of bare COFs (21.6&#8197;&#956;A and 318&#8197;V), respectively. These results demonstrated that this strategy for engineering electron withdrawing groups on the skeleton could open a new aspect of COFs for developing TENG devices.

     alt="Bromine&#8208;Functionalized Covalent Organic Frameworks for Efficient Triboelectric Nanogenerator"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Bro code&lt;/b&gt;: A 2D electron withdrawing bromine functionalized covalent organic frameworks (COFs) was constructed and served as the first example for fabricating a triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) device.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) enable precise integration of various organic building blocks into porous skeletons through topology predesign. Here, we report the first example of COFs by integrating electron withdrawing bromine group onto the skeletons for triboelectric nanogenerators (TENG). The resulting framework exhibits high surface area and good crystallinity. Thus, the bromine functionalized COF has more regular aligned &#960; columns and arrays over the skeleton than bare COFs, which in turn significantly enhances charge transport ability. As a result, bromine functionalized COFs showed higher electrical output performance at 5&#8197;Hz with a peak value of short circuit current density of 43.6&#8197;&#956;A and output voltage of 416&#8197;V, which is 2 and 1.3&#8197;times higher than those of bare COFs (21.6&#8197;&#956;A and 318&#8197;V), respectively. These results demonstrated that this strategy for engineering electron withdrawing groups on the skeleton could open a new aspect of COFs for developing TENG devices.&lt;/p&gt;

      <dc:description>Electrochemical water splitting is a clean and sustainable process for hydrogen production in large scale as the power of electricity can be obtained from various renewable energy resources. The key challenge in electrochemical water splitting process is to develop low&#8208;cost electrocatalysts with high catalytic activity for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) on cathode and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) on anode. OER is the most important half&#8208;reaction involved in water splitting, which has been extensively studied since the last century and a large amount of electrocatalysts including noble and non&#8208;noble metal&#8208;based materials have been developed.

In recent years, many efforts have been devoted to explore the OER mechanism of TMBs and to improve the OER activity and stability of TMBs. Here in this review, we summarized the recent research progress made in TMBs as efficient electrocatalysts for OER. The chemical properties, synthetic methodologies, catalytic performance evaluation and improvement strategy of TMBs as OER electrocatalysts are discussed.

      <title>Reactivity of Binary and Ternary Sulfur Halides towards Transition&#8208;Metal Compounds</title>
      <dc:description>
So much sulfur: The reactivity of the binary and ternary sulfur halides S2Cl2, SCl2, SF4, SF6, and SF5Cl towards transition&#8208;metal compounds is described. Reaction pathways include sulfurization, chlorination, chlorofluorination, or fluorination at metal centers, but also the generation of ligands containing sulfur halide moieties.







Abstract
Binary sulfur fluorides exhibit an interesting reactivity towards transition metal complexes. They open up routes for the generation of sulfur&#8208;containing building blocks. Often ligands with particular properties can be constructed. This includes their ability to transfer sulfur atoms or polysulfide units as well as fluorination reactions. This Minireview provides an insight into the reactivity of the binary and ternary sulfur halides S2Cl2, SCl2, SF4, SF6 and SF5Cl towards transition&#8208;metal compounds.

One to hold them all: A redox&#8208;active tris(ferrocenyl)triazine&#8208;based tris&#8208;phosphane was shown to bind all coinage metal(I) ions in the same trigonal&#8208;planar mode, stabilised by rare triazine&#8211;metal interactions.

The C3&#8208;symmetric coordination in both solid state and solution is stabilised by an uncommon cation&#8211;&#960; interaction between the triazine core and the metal cation. Intramolecular dynamic behaviour was observed by variable&#8208;temperature NMR spectroscopy.

      <title>Octaboraneyl Complexes of Nickel: Monomers for Redox&#8208;Active Coordination Polymers</title>
      <dc:description>Herein, we establish the preparation, characterization, and reactivity of a new diphosphine ligand,&#160;1,2&#8208; bis (di(3&#8208;dicyclohexylpropylboraneyl)phosphino)ethane (P 2 B Cy 4 ), a scaffold that contains tetraboraneyl functionality. An entryway into the coordination chemistry of P 2 B Cy 4 is established using nickel, providing the octaboraneyl complex, Ni(P 2 B Cy 4 ) 2 &#8211; this species contains a boron&#8208;rich secondary coordination sphere that reacts readily with Lewis bases. In the case of&#160;4,4&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine , an air&#8208;sensitive coordination polymer is obtained. Characterization of this material by solid&#8208;state NMR and EPR spectroscopy reveals the presence of a charge transfer polymer, which forms as a function of intramolecular Ni&#160;&#8594;&#160;4,4&#8242;&#8208;bpy electron transfer (ET), providing an array of oxidized nickel&#160;and reduced&#160;4,4'&#8208;bpy radical anion sites. Notably, the related intermolecular reaction between the model fragments,&#160; Ni(d n ppe) 2 (d n ppe = 1,2&#8208; bis (di&#8208; n &#8208;propylphosphino)ethane) and a&#160; bis (boraneyl)protected&#160;4,4&#8242;&#8208;bpy, provides no ET.

      <title>Fast Acquisition of Proton Detected HETCOR Solid&#8208;State NMR Spectra of Quadrupolar Nuclei and Rapid Measurement of NH Bond Lengths by Frequency Selective HMQC and RESPDOR Pulse Sequences</title>
      <dc:description>Fast magic angle spinning (MAS), frequency selective (FS) heteronuclear multiple quantum coherence (HMQC) experiments which function in an analogous manner to solution SOFAST HMQC NMR experiments, are demonstrated. Fast MAS enables efficient FS excitation of  1  H solid&#8208;state NMR signals. Selective excitation and observation preserves  1  H magnetization, leading to a significant shortening of the optimal inter&#8208;scan delay. Dipolar and scalar  1  H{  14  N} FS HMQC solid&#8208;state NMR experiments routinely provide 4&#8208; to 9&#8208;fold reductions in experiment times as compared to conventional  1  H{  14  N} HMQC solid&#8208;state NMR experiments.  1  H{  14  N} FS resonance&#8208;echo saturation&#8208;pulse double&#8208;resonance (RESPDOR) allowed dipolar dephasing curves to be obtained in minutes, enabling the rapid determination of NH dipolar coupling constants and inter&#8208;nuclear distances.  1  H{  14  N} FS RESPDOR was used to assign multicomponent active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) as salts or cocrystals. FS HMQC also provided enhanced sensitivity for  1  H{  17  O} and  1  H{  35  Cl} HMQC experiments on  17  O labeled Fmoc&#8208;alanine and histidine hydrochloride monohydrate, respectively. FS HMQC and FS RESPDOR experiments will provide access to valuable structural constraints from materials that are challenging to study due to unfavorable relaxation times or dilution of the nuclei of interest.</dc:description>

      <title>Modular medical imaging agents based on azide&#8208;alkyne Huisgen cycloadditions: Synthesis and pre&#8208;clinical evaluation of 18F&#8208;labeled PSMA&#8208;tracers for prostate cancer imaging.</title>
      <dc:description>The seminal contribution of Rolf Huisgen to develop the [3+2]&#8208;cycloaddition of 1,3&#8208;dipolar compounds, its azide&#8208;alkyne variant has established itself as the key step in numerous organic syntheses and bioorthogonal processes in materials science and chemical biology. In the present study, the copper(I)&#8208;catalyzed azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition was applied for the development of a modular molecular platform for medical imaging of the prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA), using positron emission tomography. This process is shown from molecular design, through synthesis automation and in vitro studies, all the way to preclinical in vivo evaluation of fluorine&#8208;18&#8211; labeled PSMA&#8208;targeting &#8216;F&#8208;PSMA&#8208;MIC&#8217; radiotracers (t&#189; = 109.7 min). Preclinical data indicate that the modular PSMA&#8208;scaffold has similar binding affinity and imaging properties to the clinically used [68Ga]PSMA&#8208;11. Furthermore, we demonstrated that targeting the arene&#8208;binding in PSMA, facilitated through the [3+2]&#8208;cycloaddition, can improve binding affinity, which was rationalized by molecular modeling. The here presented PSMA&#8208;binding scaffold potentially facilitates easy coupling to other medical imaging moieties, enabling future developments of new modular imaging agents.</dc:description>

      <title>A Resin&#8208;Supported Formate Catalyst for the Transformative Reduction of Carbon Dioxide with Hydrosilanes</title>
      <dc:description>A heterogeneous formate anion catalyst for the transformative reduction of carbon dioxide (CO  2  ) based on a polystyrene and divinylbenzene copolymer modified with alkylammonium formate was prepared from a widely available anion exchange resin. The catalyst preparation was easy and the characterization was carried out using elemental analysis, Fourier transform infrared (FT&#8208;IR) spectroscopy, X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and solid&#8208;state  13  C cross&#8208;polarization/magic angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance (  13  C CP/MAS NMR) spectroscopy. The catalyst displayed good catalytic activity for the direct reduction of CO  2  with hydrosilanes, tunably yielding silylformate or methoxysilane products depending on the hydrosilanes used. The catalyst was also active for the reductive insertion of CO  2  into both primary and secondary amines. The catalytic activity of the resin&#8208;supported formate can be predicted from the FT&#8208;IR spectra of the catalyst, probably because of the difference in the ionic interaction strength between the supported alkylammonium cations and formate anions. The ion pair density is thought to influence the catalytic activity, as shown by the elemental and solid&#8208;state  13  C NMR analyses.</dc:description>

The catalyst displayed good catalytic activity for the direct reduction of CO  2  with hydrosilanes, tunably yielding silylformate or methoxysilane products depending on the hydrosilanes used. The catalyst was also active for the reductive insertion of CO  2  into both primary and secondary amines. The catalytic activity of the resin&#8208;supported formate can be predicted from the FT&#8208;IR spectra of the catalyst, probably because of the difference in the ionic interaction strength between the supported alkylammonium cations and formate anions. The ion pair density is thought to influence the catalytic activity, as shown by the elemental and solid&#8208;state  13  C NMR analyses.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Porous Si&#8208;Cu3Si&#8208;Cu Microsphere@C Core&#8211;Shell Composites with Enhanced Electrochemical Lithium Storage</title>
      <dc:description>
Sharing a shell: Porous Si&#8208;Cu3Si&#8208;Cu microsphere@C core&#8211;shell composites fabricated by an etching/electroless deposition and subsequent carbon coating show excellent lithium storage performance.







Abstract
Low&#8208;cost Si&#8208;based anode materials with excellent electrochemical lithium storage present attractive prospects for lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs). Herein, porous Si&#8208;Cu3Si&#8208;Cu microsphere@C composites are designed and prepared by means of an etching/electroless deposition and subsequent carbon coating. The composites show a core&#8211;shell structure, with a porous Si/Cu microsphere core surrounded by the N&#8208;doped carbon shell. The Cu and Cu3Si nanoparticles are embedded inside porous silicon microspheres, forming the porous Si/Cu microsphere core. The microstructure and lithium storage performance of porous Si&#8208;Cu3Si&#8208;Cu microsphere@C composites can be effectively tuned by changing electroless deposition time. The Si&#8208;Cu3Si&#8208;Cu microsphere@C composite prepared with 12&#8197;min electroless deposition delivers a reversible capacity of 627&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 200&#8197;cycles at 2&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1, showing an enhanced lithium storage ability. The superior lithium storage performance of the Si&#8208;Cu3Si&#8208;Cu microsphere@C composite can be ascribed to the improved electronic conductivity, enhanced mechanical stability, and better buffering against the large volume change in the repeated lithiation/delithiation processes.

      <title>A Study of Magnetic Relaxation in Dysprosium(III) Single&#8208;Molecule Magnets
</title>
      <dc:description>
Pyramid scheme: An extended and systematic study of a family of lanthanide single&#8208;molecule magnets (SMMs) with pentagonal&#8208;bipyramidal geometry reveals the relaxation parameters and correlations. The energy barriers correlate with structure, mainly the electronegativity of donor atoms on the axial sites (the axial Dy&#8722;X bond lengths), and the energy barriers correlate with the blocking and hysteresis temperatures.







Abstract
Although the development of single&#8208;molecule magnets (SMMs) is rapid, there are only two families of high energy barrier (Ueff) dysprosium(III) SMMs known so far: the cyclopentadienyl (Cp) family with a sandwich structure and the pentagonal&#8208;bipyramidal (PB) family with D5h symmetry. These high&#8208;barrier SMMs, which usually possess Ueff&gt;500&#8197;cm&#8722;1 allow the separate study of the four magnetic relaxation paths, namely, direct, quantum tunnelling, Raman and Orbach processes, in detail. Whereas the first family is chemically more challenging to modify the Cp rings, it is shown herein that the latter family, with the common formulae [DyX1X2(Leq)5]+, such as X1/X2=&#8722;OCMe3, &#8722;OSiMe3, &#8722;OPh, Cl&#8722; or Br&#8722;; Leq=THF/pyridine/4&#8208;methylpyridine, can be readily fine&#8208;tuned with a range of axial and equatorial ligands by simple substitution reactions. This allows unambiguous confirmation that the Ueff mainly depends on the identity of X1 and X2, rather than on Leq. More importantly, the fitted parameters are barrier dependent. If X1 is an O donor and X2 is a halide, 500&lt;Ueff&lt;600&#8197;cm&#8722;1, log&#8201;&#964;0avg (s)=&#8722;10.66, log&#8201;Cavg (s&#8722;1&#8201;K&#8722;n)= &#8722;5.05, navg=4.1 and TH=9&#8197;K (in which &#964;0 is the pre&#8208;exponential factor for the Orbach relaxation process, C and n are parameters used to describe Raman relaxation, and TH is the highest temperature at which magnetic hysteresis is observed). For cases in which both X1 and X2 are O donors, 900&lt;Ueff&lt;1300&#8197;cm&#8722;1, log&#8201;&#964;0avg (s)=&#8722;11.63, log&#8201;Cavg (s&#8722;1&#8201;K&#8722;n)= &#8722;6.03, navg=4.1 and 18&lt;TH&lt;25&#8197;K. Based on these results, it can be further concluded that Ueff not only has a linear correlation to the axial Dy&#8722;X bond lengths, but also to TH for these PB SMMs. This represents the first systematic study of a family of lanthanide SMMs and derives the first magneto&#8208;structural correlation in Dy SMMs.

&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;lt;25&#8197;K. Based on these results, it can be further concluded that &lt;i&gt;U&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;eff&lt;/sub&gt; not only has a linear correlation to the axial Dy&#8722;X bond lengths, but also to &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt; for these PB SMMs. This represents the first systematic study of a family of lanthanide SMMs and derives the first magneto&#8208;structural correlation in Dy SMMs.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Two Rare&#8208;Earth Molecular Ferroelectrics with High Curie Temperatures, Large Spontaneous Polarization, Switchable Second Harmonic Generation Effects, and Strong Photoluminescence</title>
      <dc:description>
Multifunctional ferroelectrics: Two rare&#8208;earth metal molecular ferroelectrics are synthesized: (nBu4N)3[M(NO3)x(SCN)y] (M=Nd, Pr). The two compounds have strong on&#8211;off second harmonic generation effects, and fluorescence characteristics that are adjustable from bright yellow&#8211;red to green light simply by changing the rare&#8208;earth ion. These novel multifunctional molecular ferroelectric materials are promising for future applications.







Abstract
Smart multifunctional molecular ferroelectrics bearing high Curie temperatures and diverse excellent physical properties, such as second harmonic generation (SHG) responses, luminescence, and semiconductivity, among others, have significant applications but have seldom been documented. Herein, the rare&#8208;earth metals Nd and Pr are introduced into a simple molecular system (nBu4N)3[M(NO3)x(SCN)y] (nBu4N=tetrabutyl ammonium, M=rare&#8208;earth metal, nBu=CH3CH2CH2CH2), and two new multifunctional molecular ferroelectrics are obtained: (nBu4N)3[Nd(NO3)4(SCN)2] (1) and (nBu4N)3[Pr(NO3)4(SCN)2] (2). Their distinct heat and dielectric anomaly dependence on temperature verifies that compounds&#8197;1 and 2 experience high&#8208;temperature para&#8208;ferroelectric phase transitions at 408 and 413&#8197;K, respectively. Strikingly, both molecular ferroelectrics possess large spontaneous polarization with Ps values of 9.05 and 8.50&#8197;&#956;C&#8201;cm&#8722;2, respectively, and are further characterized by the appearance of multiple intersecting non&#8208;180&#176; domains and polarization switching behavior. In particular, compounds&#8197;1 and 2 show good stability with only a small decrease in SHG intensity after switching cycles, suggesting that they have great potential for application in nonlinear optical (NLO) switches. Simultaneously, the rare&#8208;earth compounds&#8197;1 and 2 present bright yellow&#8211;red and bright green fluorescence, respectively, at room temperature.

      <title>Surface Design for Immobilization of an Antimicrobial Peptide Mimic for Efficient Anti&#8208;Biofouling</title>
      <dc:description>
Efficient anti&#8208;biofouling: We show that an archetypical antimicrobial peptoid could retain high activity even with terminal modifications. Immobilization by alkyne&#8211;azide &#8222;click&#8220; coupling on one&#8208;step modified amino&#8208;surfaces was demonstrated. Appropriate spatial separation between immobilized peptoids, rather than increasing surface density, was found to promote both resistance against bacterial attachment and AMP surface activity.







Abstract
Microbial surface attachment negatively impacts a wide range of devices from water purification membranes to biomedical implants. Mimics of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) constituted from poly(N&#8208;substituted glycine) &#8222;peptoids&#8220; are of great interest as they resist proteolysis and can inhibit a wide spectrum of microbes. We investigate how terminal modification of a peptoid AMP&#8208;mimic and its surface immobilization affect antimicrobial activity. We also demonstrate a convenient surface modification strategy for enabling alkyne&#8211;azide &#8222;click&#8220; coupling on amino&#8208;functionalized surfaces. Our results verified that the N&#8208; and C&#8208;terminal peptoid structures are not required for antimicrobial activity. Moreover, our peptoid immobilization density and choice of PEG tether resulted in a &#8222;volumetric&#8220; spatial separation between AMPs that, compared to past studies, enabled the highest AMP surface activity relative to bacterial attachment. Our analysis suggests the importance of spatial flexibility for membrane activity and that AMP separation may be a controlling parameter for optimizing surface anti&#8208;biofouling.

      <title>Synthetic Ellagic Acid Glycosides Inhibit Early Stage Adhesion of Streptococcus agalactiae Biofilms as Observed by Scanning Electron Microscopy</title>
      <dc:description>
Synthetic ellagic acid glycosides possess carbohydrate&#8208;specific antibiofilm activity against Streptococcus agalactiae. SEM has revealed that these compounds likely inhibit early stage bacterial adhesion mechanisms. Additionally, these compounds possess antimicrobial activity against gram&#8208;negative ESKAPE pathogens, further broadening the antibiotic profile of synthetic ellagic acid glycosides (see figure).







Abstract
Ellagic acid derivatives possess antimicrobial and antibiofilm properties across a wide&#8208;range of microbial pathogens. Due to their poor solubility and ambident reactivity it is challenging to synthesize, purify, and characterize the activity of ellagic acid glycosides. In this study, we have synthesized three ellagic acid glycoconjugates and evaluated their antimicrobial and antibiofilm activity in Streptococcus agalactiae (Group B Streptococcus, GBS). Their significant impacts on biofilm formation were examined via SEM to reveal early&#8208;stage inhibition of cellular adhesion. Additionally, the synthetic glycosides were evaluated against five of the six ESKAPE pathogens and two fungal pathogens. These studies reveal that the ellagic acid glycosides possess inhibitory effects on the growth of gram&#8208;negative pathogens.

      <title>Chiral Bent&#8208;Shaped Molecules Exhibiting Unusually Wide Range of Blue Liquid&#8208;Crystalline Phases and Multistimuli&#8208;Responsive Behavior</title>
      <dc:description>
Out of shape: A chiral bent&#8208;core liquid crystal is successfully engineered, in which an electronegative chloro moiety is introduced at the transverse position of the central benzene ring. These chiral, bent&#8208;shaped liquid crystals exhibit an unusually wide range of blue phases with multistimuli&#8208;responsive behavior.







Abstract
Recently, an unprecedented observation of polar order, thermochromic behavior, and exotic mesophases in new chiral, bent&#8208;shaped systems with a &#8722;CH3 moiety placed at the transverse position of the central core was reported. Herein, a homologous series of compounds with even&#8208;numbered carbon chains from n=4 to 18 were synthesized, in which &#8722;Cl was substituted for &#8722;CH3 at the kink position and a drastic modification in the phase structure of the bent&#8208;shaped molecule was observed. An unusual stabilization of the cubic blue phase (BP) over a wide range of 16.4&#8201;&#176;C has been witnessed. Two homologues in this series (1&#8208;12 and 1&#8208;14) exhibit an interesting phase sequence consisting of BPI/II, chiral nematic, twist grain boundary, smectic&#8197;A, and smectic&#8197;X (SmX) phases. The higher homologues (1&#8208;16 and 1&#8208;18) stabilize the SmX phase enantiotropically over the entire temperature range. Crystal structure analysis confirmed the bent molecular architecture, with a bent angle of 148&#176;, and revealed the presence of two different molecular conformations in an asymmetric unit of compound 1&#8208;4. A DFT study corroborated that the &#8722;Cl moiety at the central core of the molecule led to an increase in the dipole moment along the transverse direction, which, in turn, facilitated the unusual stabilization of frustrated structures. Crystal polymorphism has been evidenced in three homologues (1&#8208;10, 1&#8208;12, and 1&#8208;14) of the series. On the application of mechanical pressure through grinding, compound 1&#8208;10 transformed from a bright yellow crystalline solid to a dark orange&#8211;green amorphous solid, which reversed upon dropwise addition of dichloromethane, indicating reversible mechanochromism in this class of compounds. In addition, excellent thermochromic behavior has been observed for compound 1&#8208;10 with a controlled temperature&#8211;color combination.

     alt="Chiral Bent&#8208;Shaped Molecules Exhibiting Unusually Wide Range of Blue Liquid&#8208;Crystalline Phases and Multistimuli&#8208;Responsive Behavior"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Out of shape&lt;/b&gt;: A chiral bent&#8208;core liquid crystal is successfully engineered, in which an electronegative chloro moiety is introduced at the transverse position of the central benzene ring. These chiral, bent&#8208;shaped liquid crystals exhibit an unusually wide range of blue phases with multistimuli&#8208;responsive behavior.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently, an unprecedented observation of polar order, thermochromic behavior, and exotic mesophases in new chiral, bent&#8208;shaped systems with a &#8722;CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; moiety placed at the transverse position of the central core was reported. Herein, a homologous series of compounds with even&#8208;numbered carbon chains from &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;=4 to 18 were synthesized, in which &#8722;Cl was substituted for &#8722;CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; at the kink position and a drastic modification in the phase structure of the bent&#8208;shaped molecule was observed. An unusual stabilization of the cubic blue phase (BP) over a wide range of 16.4&#8201;&#176;C has been witnessed. Two homologues in this series (&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;&#8208;12 and &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;&#8208;14) exhibit an interesting phase sequence consisting of BPI/II, chiral nematic, twist grain boundary, smectic&#8197;A, and smectic&#8197;X (SmX) phases. The higher homologues (&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;&#8208;16 and &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;&#8208;18) stabilize the SmX phase enantiotropically over the entire temperature range. Crystal structure analysis confirmed the bent molecular architecture, with a bent angle of 148&#176;, and revealed the presence of two different molecular conformations in an asymmetric unit of compound &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;&#8208;4. A DFT study corroborated that the &#8722;Cl moiety at the central core of the molecule led to an increase in the dipole moment along the transverse direction, which, in turn, facilitated the unusual stabilization of frustrated structures. Crystal polymorphism has been evidenced in three homologues (&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;&#8208;10, &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;&#8208;12, and &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;&#8208;14) of the series. On the application of mechanical pressure through grinding, compound &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;&#8208;10 transformed from a bright yellow crystalline solid to a dark orange&#8211;green amorphous solid, which reversed upon dropwise addition of dichloromethane, indicating reversible mechanochromism in this class of compounds. In addition, excellent thermochromic behavior has been observed for compound &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;&#8208;10 with a controlled temperature&#8211;color combination.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Synthesis and Supramolecular Functional Assemblies of Ratiometric pH Probes</title>
      <dc:description>
Right on track! Recent synthetic strategies towards the preparation of molecular ratiometric probes for intracellular pH imaging are reviewed. The integration of these pH molecular probes into supramolecular systems allow the fabrication of new sensors with enhanced selectivity and sensitivity.







Abstract
Tracking pH with spatiotemporal resolution is a critical challenge for synthetic chemistry, chemical biology and beyond. Over the last decade, different small probes and supramolecular systems have emerged for in cellulo or in vivo pH tracking. However, pH reporting still presents critical limitations, such as background reduction, improved sensor stability, cell targeting, endosomal escape, near&#8208; and far&#8208;infrared ratiometric pH tracking and adaption to new imaging techniques (i.e., super&#8208;resolution). These challenges will require the combined efforts of synthetic and supramolecular chemistry working together to develop the next generation of smart materials that will resolve current limitations. Herein, recent advances in the synthesis of small fluorescent probes, together with new supramolecular functional systems employed for pH tracking, are described with an emphasis on ratiometric probes. The combination of organic synthesis and stimuli&#8208;responsive supramolecular functional materials will be essential to solve future challenges of pH tracking, such as improved signal to noise ratio, on target activation and microenvironment reporting.

Abstract
New redox&#8208;active 1,2,5,6&#8208;tetrakis(guanidino)&#8208;naphthalene compounds, isolable and storable in the neutral and deep&#8208;green dicationic redox states and oxidisable further in two one&#8208;electron steps to the tetracations, are reported. Protonation switches on blue fluorescence, with the fluorescence intensity (quantum yield) increasing with the degree of protonation. Reactions with N&#8208;halogenosuccinimides or N&#8208;halogenophthalimides led to a series of new redox&#8208;active halogeno&#8208; and succinimido&#8208;/phthalimido&#8208;substituted derivatives. These highly selective reactions are proposed to proceed via the tri&#8208; or tetracationic state as the intermediate. The derivatives are oxidised reversibly at slightly higher potentials than that of the unsubstituted compounds to dications and further to tri&#8208; and tetracations. The integration of redox&#8208;active ligands in the transition&#8208;metal complexes shifts the redox potentials to higher values and also allows reversible oxidation in two potentially separated one&#8208;electron steps.

      <title>Effect of Phosphorylation on the Structural Behaviour of Peptides Derived from the Intrinsically Disordered C&#8208;Terminal Domain of Histone H1.0</title>
      <dc:description>
Spot the differences! Based on the NMR data of model peptides, the TPKK and TPVK phosphorylation motifs that are present in the intrinsically disordered C&#8208;terminal domain of histone H1.0 show the same backbone conformations when phosphorylated and non&#8208;phosphorylated, but different side&#8208;chain interactions (see figure). Furthermore, the phospho&#8208;threonine pKa in the TPKK motif is much lower than the intrinsic one, whereas in the TPVK motif it is only slightly lower.







Abstract
To investigate the structural impact of phosphorylation on the human histone H1.0 C&#8208;terminal domain, we performed NMR structural studies of model peptides containing a single phosphorylation site: T118&#8208;H1.0 (T118PKK motif) and T140&#8208;H1.0 (T140PVK motif). Both model peptides are mainly disordered in aqueous solution in their non&#8208;phosphorylated and phosphorylated forms, but become structured in the presence of trifluoroethanol. The peptides T118&#8208;H1.0 and pT118&#8208;H1.0 contain two helical regions, a long amphipathic &#945; helix spanning residues 104&#8211;115 and a short &#945;/310 helix (residues 119&#8211;123), that are almost perpendicular in T118&#8208;H1.0 but have a poorly defined orientation in pT118&#8208;H1.0. Peptides T140&#8208;H1.0 and pT140&#8208;H1.0 form very similar &#945; helices between residues 141&#8211;147. The TPKK and TPVK motifs show the same backbone conformation, but differ in their side&#8208;chain contacts; the Thr and pThr side chains interact with the i+2 Lys side chain in the TPKK motif, and with the i+3 Lys side chain in the TPVK motif. The pT phosphate group in pT118&#8208;H1.0 and pT140&#8208;H1.0 has pKa values below the intrinsic values, which can be explained by non&#8208;specific charge&#8211;charge interactions with nearby Lys. The non&#8208;polar Val in the TPVK motif accounts for the pT140 pKa being closer to the intrinsic pKa value than the pT118 pKa. Altogether, these results validate that minimalist strategies using model peptides can provide structural details difficult to obtain in short&#8208;lived intrinsically disordered proteins and domains.

      <title>A Novel Visible Range FRET Probe for Monitoring Acid Sphingomyelinase Activity in Living Cells</title>
      <dc:description>
More than just FRET: A visible range FRET probe for acid sphingomyelinase (ASM) was developed. The fluorescence increase is &gt;100 fold and additionally fueled by environmental sensitivity of the fluorescein dye. The probe was used for analysis of live cell ASM activities by flow cytometry.







Abstract
Activity of acid sphingomyelinase has been implicated in a number of diseases like acute lung injury, sepsis or metastasis of melanoma cells. Here, we present a sphingomyelinase FRET probe based on FAM/BODIPY dyes for real&#8208;time monitoring of acid sphingomyelinase. The probe gives rise to a tremendous increase in fluorescence of the fluorescein FRET donor upon cleavage and we show that this is, to a significant part, due to cleavage&#8208;associated phase transition, suggesting a more systematic consideration of such effects for future probe development. The probe allows for the first time to monitor relative sphingomyelinase activities of intact living cells by flow cytometry.

      <title>Parallel Versus Antiparallel &#946;&#8208;Sheet Structure in Cyclic Peptide Hybrids Containing &#947;&#8208; or &#948;&#8208;Cyclic Amino Acids</title>
      <dc:description>
Cycles and tubes: Cyclic peptides containing aminocycloalkanecarboxylic acid alternated with &#945;&#8208;residues stack preferably in parallel&#8208;like &#946;&#8208;sheet structures.







Abstract
Cyclic peptides with disc&#8208;shaped structures have emerged as potent building blocks for the preparation of new biomaterials in fields ranging from biological to material science. In this work, we analyze in depth the self&#8208;assembling properties of a new type of cyclic peptides based on the alternation of &#945;&#8208;residues and cyclic &#948;&#8208;amino acids (&#945;,&#948;&#8208;CPs). To examine the preferred stacking properties adopted by cyclic peptides bearing this type of amino acids, we carried out a synergistic in vitro/in silico approximation by using simple dimeric models and then extended to nanotubes. Although these new cyclic peptides (&#945;,&#948;&#8208;CPs) can interact either in a parallel or antiparallel fashion, our results confirm that although the parallel &#946;&#8208;sheet is more stable, it can be switched to the antiparallel stacking by choosing residues that can establish favorable cross&#8208;strand interactions. Moreover, the subsequent comparison by using the same methodology but applied to &#945;,&#947;&#8208;CPs models, up to the moment assumed as antiparallel&#8208;like d,l&#8208;&#945;&#8208;CPs, led to unforeseen conclusions that put into question preliminary conjectures about these systems. Surprisingly, they tend to adopt a parallel &#946;&#8208;sheet directed by the skeleton interactions. These results imply a change of paradigm with respect to cyclic peptide designs that should be considered for dimers and nanotubes.

      <title>A Chemical History of Polycyclic Musks</title>
      <dc:description>
Seven musks: Seven stories related to the discovery of seven polycyclic aromatic compounds diffusing the smell of musk. Seven chemical endeavors involving organic chemists with great personalities, resulting in immense industrial successes in the second half of the 20th century. Seven musk raw materials that reshaped the course of modern perfumery.







Abstract
Musk odorants are ubiquitous in fine perfumery as well as household products, and are divided into four main families, the nitromusks, the macrocyclic musks, the polycyclic aromatic musks, and the alicyclic musks, following their order of appearance on the perfumery market. This article presents the scientific and industrial adventures during the discovery of the seven commercial polycyclic musks, which invigorated the aroma chemistry corporations during the second half of the 20th century, resulting in relentless competition. Research and development strategies are exposed, and reactivity, analytical, mechanistic, and structure&#8211;activity relationships aspects are discussed as well as some biographical elements of the main scientific actors, and some fine perfumery examples are given as illustrations of their use.

The 3&#8208;D fragments were designed to contain suitable synthetic handles for future fragment elaboration.

      <title>Graphene/Amorphous Carbon Restriction Structure for Stable and Long&#8208;Lifespan Antimony Anode in Potassium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
      <dc:description>
Under cover: A graphene/amorphous carbon restriction structure is designed for an Sb anode, in which the anode is protected from pulverization and aggregation, thus leading to the excellent stability and long lifespan of Sb in K&#8208;ion batteries.







Abstract
Sb&#8208;based materials have attracted much attention owing to their ability to undergo a multi&#8208;electron alloy reaction with K+. However, there are still the serious problems of volume change and aggregation of particles, which lead to rapid capacity fading and a limited lifespan. In this work, a graphene/amorphous carbon restriction structure is proposed, in which the amorphous carbon layer on the surface of Sb nanoparticles can protect the particles from pulverization, and the graphene can buffer the volume change of the material. In addition, the conductive network formed by the dual carbon structure effectively improves the rate performance of the material. Thus, the material delivers a high capacity of 550&#8197;mA&#8201;h&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 100&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1, a rate capability of 370&#8197;mA&#8201;h&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 2000&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1, and a long lifespan of 350&#8197;cycles without significant capacity fading. The dual carbon strategy proposed offers a reference for the design of high&#8208;performance anode materials.

      <title>Selectivity over kinetic and thermodynamically driven pathways of crystallization to yield Co&#8208;facial and Slipped Stack dimers in single crystals</title>
      <dc:description>Control over the molecular packing in the solid state is of utmost importance in regulating the bulk optical properties of organic semiconductors. The electronic coupling between the molecules makes it possible to improve the properties of the bulk materials. Herein, we report an example on the control over selectivity  of the formation of  polymorphic single crystals of  25TR  by (i) kinetic or (ii) thermodynamic course of crystallisation to yield slipped stack (  S  ) and co&#8208;facial (  C  ) dimeric type in their single crystals.&#160;&#160;Both the forms show significant excitonic interactions in solid state and eventually the  S&#8208;  dimeric form has strong yellowish orange fluorescence while the  C  &#8208;dimeric form is non fluorescent in their crystalline state. Density functional theory calculations and the differential scanning calorimetric experiments revealed that the  C  &#8208;dimer polymorph is the thermodynamically stable form with a free energy offset of 0.43 eV in comparison to the  S  &#8208;dimer. Interestingly, the thermodynamically driven non&#8208;fluorescent single crystal is found to be convertible to its fluorescent form irreversibly by thermal trigger.

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Control over the molecular packing in the solid state is of utmost importance in regulating the bulk optical properties of organic semiconductors. The electronic coupling between the molecules makes it possible to improve the properties of the bulk materials. Herein, we report an example on the control over selectivity  of the formation of  polymorphic single crystals of  25TR  by (i) kinetic or (ii) thermodynamic course of crystallisation to yield slipped stack (  S  ) and co&#8208;facial (  C  ) dimeric type in their single crystals.&#160;&#160;Both the forms show significant excitonic interactions in solid state and eventually the  S&#8208;  dimeric form has strong yellowish orange fluorescence while the  C  &#8208;dimeric form is non fluorescent in their crystalline state. Density functional theory calculations and the differential scanning calorimetric experiments revealed that the  C  &#8208;dimer polymorph is the thermodynamically stable form with a free energy offset of 0.43 eV in comparison to the  S  &#8208;dimer. Interestingly, the thermodynamically driven non&#8208;fluorescent single crystal is found to be convertible to its fluorescent form irreversibly by thermal trigger. The charge carrier&#8208;transport characteristics of these two polymorphs are computed using the Marcus&#8211;Hush formalism. The computational results on the charge carrier transport behaviour revealed that the  S  &#8208;dimer (  25TR  (R)  ) is ambipolar while the  C  &#8208;dimer (  25TR  (Y)  ) is majorly n&#8208;type.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>The Xanthate Route to Indolines, Indoles, and their Aza Congeners</title>
      <dc:description>Convergent routes to a variety of indolines, indoles, oxindoles, and their aza analogues involving radical additions of xanthates are described. Three approaches are summarized. The first is the least general and relies on the generation of aryl or heteroaryl radicals starting from diazonium salts. The second involves radical addition to  N  &#8208;allylanilines followed by ring&#8208;closure onto the aromatic core. A large variety of indolines and azaindolines can thus be obtained and, in many cases, converted into the corresponding indoles and azaindoles by various methods. The synthesis of novel fluoroazaindolines and fluoroazaindoles by a rare homolytic  ipso  &#8208;substitution of fluorine atoms is particularly noteworthy. The last approach hinges on the direct modification of indoles by radical addition to the pyrrole subunit of the indole nucleus. Application of this methodology to the total synthesis of melatonin and the alkaloids mersicarpine, caulerpine, and the pentacyclic skeleton of tronocarpine is briefly discussed. Most of the compounds described herein would be difficult to obtain by more traditional routes.</dc:description>

      <title>Structural Transformation of SnS2 to SnS by Mo Doping Produces Electro/Photocatalyst for Hydrogen Production</title>
      <dc:description>SnS and SnS  2  are layered semiconductors, with potential promising properties for electro&#8208;catalytic and photocatalytic hydrogen (H  2  ) production.

This demonstrated the occurrence of photoinduced charge separation between FLSb and C  60  in (FLSb+C  60  )  m  . Furthermore, a photoelectrochemical device with an electrophoretically deposited (FLSb+C  60  )  m  film exhibited an enhanced efficiency of photocurrent generation, compared to th ose of the single&#8208;components, FLSb and C  60  , due to the photoinduced charge separation between FLSb and C  60  .

      <title>Kinetics of Photoinduced Reactions at the Single&#8208;Molecule Level: The KACB Method
</title>
      <dc:description>
Blink, don't FRET! The kinetics of photoinduced reactions can be accessed through fluorescence correlation spectroscopy. By measuring the OFF time during blinking, the lifetimes of photoinduced intermediates, such as triplet, radical ion, and isomerized states, can be determined.







Abstract
The kinetics of photoinduced reactions can be approached by laser flash photolysis techniques. Although such techniques allow for a detailed understanding of the important photophysics of molecules, they normally require a substantial amount of sample for measurements (&gt;1&#8197;nmol), and thus, they are difficult to apply to analytical and diagnostic applications. The photophysics of a fluorescent molecule can be accessed by monitoring the kinetics of the fluctuation of fluorescence, which is called blinking. Blinking is a phenomenon that can be monitored only if molecules are observed at the single&#8208;molecule level. In bulk solution, blinking kinetics can be measured by using fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS), which normally requires more than 105 times less sample than that required for laser flash photolysis. Blinking is controlled to extract fruitful microenvironmental information around a fluorescent molecule, by using a method named kinetic analysis based on the control of fluorescence blinking (KACB). This Concept highlights the adaption of the KACB method to investigate the local conformation of DNA with less than 1&#8197;pmol of DNA sample.

      <title>Mononuclear to Polynuclear UIV Structural Units: Effects of Reaction Conditions on U&#8208;Furoate Phase Formation</title>
      <dc:description>
U what? Five UIV&#8208;furoate compounds were isolated through the examination of reaction conditions on phase formation. Solid&#8208;state structural investigations showed that variation in the synthetic parameters led to notable differences in the structural chemistry, with ligand bridged mononuclear units to tetranuclear and hexanuclear units, and large polyoxo {U38}&#8208;clusters isolated under fairly similar synthetic conditions. For all reaction solutions, increasing the temperature resulted in the formation of UO2 nanoparticles.







Abstract
Uranium(IV) complexation by 2&#8208;furoic acid (2&#8208;FA) was examined to better understand the effects of ligand identity and reaction conditions on species formation and stability. Five compounds were isolated: [UCl2(2&#8208;FA)2(H2O)2]n (1), [U4Cl10O2(THF)6(2&#8208;FA)2]&#8901;2&#8201;THF (2), [U6O4(OH)4(H2O)3(2&#8208;FA)12]&#8901;7&#8201;THF&#8901;H2O (3), [U6O4(OH)4(H2O)2(2&#8208;FA)12]&#8901;8.76&#8201;H2O (4), and [U38Cl42O54(OH)2(H2O)20]&#8901;m&#8201;H2O&#8901;n&#8201;THF (5). The structures were determined by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and further characterized by Raman, IR, and optical absorption spectroscopy.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;U what?&lt;/b&gt; Five U&lt;sup&gt;IV&lt;/sup&gt;&#8208;furoate compounds were isolated through the examination of reaction conditions on phase formation. Solid&#8208;state structural investigations showed that variation in the synthetic parameters led to notable differences in the structural chemistry, with ligand bridged mononuclear units to tetranuclear and hexanuclear units, and large polyoxo {U&lt;sub&gt;38&lt;/sub&gt;}&#8208;clusters isolated under fairly similar synthetic conditions. For all reaction solutions, increasing the temperature resulted in the formation of UO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; nanoparticles.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Uranium(IV) complexation by 2&#8208;furoic acid (2&#8208;FA) was examined to better understand the effects of ligand identity and reaction conditions on species formation and stability. Five compounds were isolated: [UCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(2&#8208;FA)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt; (&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;), [U&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(THF)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;(2&#8208;FA)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;b&gt;&#8901;&lt;/b&gt;2&#8201;THF (&lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;), [U&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;(OH)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(2&#8208;FA)&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;b&gt;&#8901;&lt;/b&gt;7&#8201;THF&lt;b&gt;&#8901;&lt;/b&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O (&lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt;), [U&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;(OH)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(2&#8208;FA)&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;b&gt;&#8901;&lt;/b&gt;8.76&#8201;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O (&lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt;), and [U&lt;sub&gt;38&lt;/sub&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;42&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;54&lt;/sub&gt;(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;sub&gt;20&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;b&gt;&#8901;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;i&gt;m&lt;/i&gt;&#8201;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;b&gt;&#8901;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;&#8201;THF (&lt;b&gt;5&lt;/b&gt;). The structures were determined by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and further characterized by Raman, IR, and optical absorption spectroscopy. The thermal stability and magnetic behavior of the compounds were also examined. Variations in the synthetic conditions led to notable differences in the structural units observed in the solid state.

      <title>Lithium&#8211;Lanthanide Bimetallic Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks towards Negative Electrode Materials for Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
      <dc:description>
Expanded capacity: Three Ln&#8722;Li metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs; Ln=Ce and Pr) were successfully designed and structurally characterized. The unique electrochemical performances of Ln&#8722;Li MOFs lead to promising applications as next&#8208;generation electrode materials for lithium&#8208;ion batteries.







Abstract
Novel lithium&#8211;lanthanide (Ln: cerium and praseodymium) bimetallic coordination polymers with formulas C10H2LnLiO8 (Ln: Ce (CeLipma) and Pr (PrLipma)) and C10H3CeO8 (Cepma) were prepared through a simple hydrothermal method. The three compounds were characterized by means of FTIR spectroscopy, X&#8208;ray diffraction, single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, SEM, TEM, and X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The results of structural refinement show that they belong to triclinic symmetry and P
 space group with cerium (or praseodymium) and lithium cations, forming coordination bonds to oxygen atoms from different pyromellitic acid molecules, and leading to the construction of 3D structures. It is interesting to note that the frameworks exclude any coordination water and lattice water. As an electrode material for lithium&#8208;ion batteries, CeLipma exhibits a maximum capacity of 800.5&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 and a retention of 91.4&#8201;% after 50 cycles at a current density of 100&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1. The favorable electrochemical properties of the lanthanide coordination polymers show potential application prospects in the field of electrode materials.

     alt="Lithium&#8211;Lanthanide Bimetallic Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks towards Negative Electrode Materials for Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Expanded capacity&lt;/b&gt;: Three Ln&#8722;Li metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs; Ln=Ce and Pr) were successfully designed and structurally characterized. The unique electrochemical performances of Ln&#8722;Li MOFs lead to promising applications as next&#8208;generation electrode materials for lithium&#8208;ion batteries.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Novel lithium&#8211;lanthanide (Ln: cerium and praseodymium) bimetallic coordination polymers with formulas C&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;LnLiO&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; (Ln: Ce (CeLipma) and Pr (PrLipma)) and C&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CeO&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; (Cepma) were prepared through a simple hydrothermal method. The three compounds were characterized by means of FTIR spectroscopy, X&#8208;ray diffraction, single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, SEM, TEM, and X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The results of structural refinement show that they belong to triclinic symmetry and &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;
 space group with cerium (or praseodymium) and lithium cations, forming coordination bonds to oxygen atoms from different pyromellitic acid molecules, and leading to the construction of 3D structures. It is interesting to note that the frameworks exclude any coordination water and lattice water. As an electrode material for lithium&#8208;ion batteries, CeLipma exhibits a maximum capacity of 800.5&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and a retention of 91.4&#8201;% after 50 cycles at a current density of 100&#8197;mA&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. The favorable electrochemical properties of the lanthanide coordination polymers show potential application prospects in the field of electrode materials.&lt;/p&gt;

      <dc:description>Hydrogen production via energy&#8208;efficient electrochemical water electrolysis is a green avenue to meet the development of contemporary society. However, oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and urea oxidation reaction (UOR) occurring on the anode are impeded by the sluggish kinetics reaction during the water&#8208;splitting process.

Herein, we report a bifunctional CoMn layered double hydroxides (LDH) grown on nickel foam with a 1D&#8208;2D&#8208;3D hierarchical structure for efficient OER and UOR performance in alkaline solution. Benefited from the significant synergistic effect of Mn doping and heterostrcuture engineering simultaneously, the obtained Co1Mn1 LDH/NF exhibits a satisfactory OER activity with a low potential of 1.515 V to attain 10 mA&#8226;cm&#8208;2. Besides, the potential of Co1Mn1 LDH/NF catalyst for UOR at the same current density is only 1.326 V, much lower than other counterparts and most reported electrocatalysts. Remarkably, a urea electrolytic cell with anodic Co1Mn1 LDH/NF and cathodic Pt&#8208;C/NF electrode is established, then the low cell voltage of 1.354 V at 10 mA&#8226;cm&#8208;2 is acquired.

      <title>Solubility&#8208;Driven Isolation of a Metastable Nonagold Cluster with Body&#8208;Centered Cubic Structure</title>
      <dc:description>The conventional synthetic methodology of atomically precise gold nanoclusters using reduction in solutions offers only thermodynamically most stable nanoclusters. We report herein a solubility&#8208;driven isolation strategy to access the synthesis of a metastable gold cluster. The cluster, with the composition of &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;[Au 9 (PPh 3 ) 8 ] + ( 1 ), displays an unusual, nearly perfect body&#8208;centered&#8208;cubic (bcc) structure. As revealed by ESI&#8208;MS and UV/Vis measurement, the cluster is metastable in solution and converts to the well&#8208;known [Au 11 (PPh 3 ) 8 Cl 2 ] + ( 2 ) within just 90 min. DFT calculations revealed that while both 1 and 2 are eight&#8208;electron superatoms, there is a driving force to convert 1 to 2 as shown by the increased cohesion and larger HOMO&#8208;LUMO energy gap of 2 . The isolation and crystallization of the metastable gold cluster were achieved in a biphasic reaction system in which reduction of gold precursors and crystallization of 1 took place concurrently. This synthetic protocol represents a successful strategy for investigations of other metastable species in metal nanocluster chemistry.</dc:description>

      <title>Post&#8208;Metalation Modification of Macrocyclic Dicobalt(III) Metallohost by Site&#8208;Selective Ligand Exchange for Guest Recognition Control</title>
      <dc:description>We propose the post&#8208;metalation modification as a useful strategy to control the guest recognition behavior of a metal&#8208;containing macrocyclic host. This is based on the ligand exchange of the axial ligands of a cobalt(III) dinuclear macrocyclic host, [LCo  2  X  4  ]  2+  (X = axial amine ligand). Four piperidine ligands in [LCo  2  (pip)  4  ]  2+  (pip = piperidine) were site&#8208;selectively replaced with primary amines. The competitive experiments revealed that the order of the affinity toward the cobalt centers in [LCo  2  X  4  ]  2+  is primary amine &gt; secondary amine &gt; tertiary amine and that the piperidine&#8208;coordinating complex, [LCo  2  (pip)  4  ]  2+  , was reasonably reactive among the isolable complexes. Indeed, two piperidine ligands at the diagonal positions in [LCo  2  (pip)  4  ]  2+  were site&#8208;selectively replaced with pyridine or acetate ion. The replacement of piperidine with acetate ion significantly enhanced the recognition ability towards Na  +  .</dc:description>

      <title>Cobalt(II)&#8208;Catalyzed [4+2] Annulation of Picolinamides with Alkynes via C&#8722;H Bond Activation</title>
      <dc:description>
Free from any oxidation factor: A co&#8208;oxidant free cobalt(II)&#8208;catalyzed picolinamide&#8208;directed annulation of alkyne via C(sp2)&#8722;H bond activation was developed. Under the optimized reaction condition, the reaction system shows a wide scope of alkynes and obtains the novel annulation acyl&#8208;substituted 1H&#8208;benzoquinoline in good to excellent yields (up to 96&#8201;%).







Abstract
A cobalt(II)&#8208;catalyzed [4+2] annulation of picolinamides with alkynes via C&#8722;H bond activation has been developed. The operationally simple annulation reaction allows for the synthesis of acyl&#8208;substituted 1H&#8208;benzoquinoline bearing multiple aromatic rings (up to 96&#8201;% yield) without co&#8208;oxidant or other oxidation factors under mild conditions. Several control experiments were carried out. This practical [4+2] annulation provides an efficient route to access highly functionalized compounds.

      <title>Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Mediated Click Chemistry for Highly Regioselective Azide&#8211;Alkyne Cycloaddition by a Photoredox Electron&#8208;Transfer Strategy</title>
      <dc:description>
One more click! A novel design strategy for the azide&#8211;alkyne cycloaddition reaction by visible&#8208;light catalysis through a photoredox electron&#8208;transfer process (see scheme) has been developed for the first time. The reaction can be performed with a metal&#8208;free catalyst in water using solar energy, making this a sustainable and environmentally friendly photocatalytic system, and represents an important development for click chemistry.







Abstract
Click chemistry focuses on the development of highly selective reactions using simple precursors for the exquisite synthesis of molecules. Undisputedly, the CuI&#8208;catalyzed azide&#8211;alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC) is one of the most valuable examples of click chemistry, but it suffers from some limitations as it requires additional reducing agents and ligands as well as cytotoxic copper. Here, we demonstrate a novel strategy for the azide&#8211;alkyne cycloaddition reaction that involves a photoredox electron&#8208;transfer radical mechanism instead of the traditional metal&#8208;catalyzed coordination process. This newly developed photocatalyzed azide&#8211;alkyne cycloaddition reaction can be performed under mild conditions at room temperature in the presence of air and visible light and shows good functional group tolerance, excellent atom economy, high yields of up to 99&#8201;%, and absolute regioselectivity, affording a variety of 1,4&#8208;disubstituted 1,2,3&#8208;triazole derivatives, including bioactive molecules and pharmaceuticals. The use of a recyclable photocatalyst, solar energy, and water as solvent makes this photocatalytic system sustainable and environmentally friendly. Moreover, the azide&#8211;alkyne cycloaddition reaction could be photocatalyzed in the presence of a metal&#8208;free catalyst with excellent regioselectivity, which represents an important development for click chemistry and should find versatile applications in organic synthesis, chemical biology, and materials science.

      <title>Salinomycin Derivatives Kill Breast Cancer Stem Cells by Lysosomal Iron Targeting</title>
      <dc:description>
Library of salinomycin derivatives: The search for new candidates to tackle the cancer stem cells (CSC) niche has led to the synthesis of a library of salinomycin derivatives. This study demonstrates that the stereoselective reductive amination at C20 is a key modification for selective targeting of breast CSC. The new C20&#8208;cyclopropylamine derivative exhibited an impressive nanomolar activity against CSC, killing these cells by ROS production, induced after iron accumulation in lysosomes.







Abstract
Salinomycin (1) exhibits a large spectrum of biological activities including the capacity to selectively eradicate cancer stem cells (CSC), making it and its derivatives promising candidates for the development of drug leads against CSC. It has been previously shown that salinomycin and its C20&#8208;propargylamine derivative (Ironomycin (2)) accumulate in lysosomes and sequester iron in this organelle. Herein, a library of salinomycin derivatives is reported, including products of C20&#8208;amination, C1&#8208;esterification, C9&#8208;oxidation, and C28&#8208;dehydration. The biological activity of these compounds is evaluated against transformed human mammary epithelial HMLER CD24low/CD44high cells, a well&#8208;established model of breast CSC, and HMLER CD24high/CD44low cells deprived of CSC properties. Unlike other structural alterations, derivative 4, which displays a cyclopropylamine at position C20, showed a strikingly low IC50 value of 23&#8197;nm against HMLER CD24low/CD44high cells. This study provides highly selective molecules to target the CSC niche, a potential interesting advance for drug development to prevent cancer resistance.

      <title>Non&#8208;emissive Ru(II) polypyridyl complexes as efficient and selective photosensitizers for the photooxidation of benzylamines</title>
      <dc:description>Five new Ru(II) polypyridyl complexes bearing N&#8208;(arylsulfonyl)&#8208;8&#8208;amidoquinolate ligands and three of their biscyclometalated Ir(III) congeners have been prepared and employed as photocatalysts (PCs) in the photooxidation of benzylamines with O  2  . In particular, the new Ru(II) complexes do not exhibit photoluminescence but they harvest visible light efficiently and are very stable in solution under irradiation with blue light. Their non&#8208;emissive behavior has been related to the low electrochemical energy gaps and rationalized on the basis of theoretical calculations (DFT analysis), which predict low S  0  &#8592; T  1  energy values. Moreover, the Ru(II) complexes, despite being non&#8208;emissive, display excellent activities in the selective photocatalytic transformation of benzylamines into the corresponding imines. The presence of an electron withdrawing group (&#8211;CF  3  ) on the arene ring of the N&#8208;(arylsulfonyl)&#8208;8&#8208;amidoquinolate ligand improves the photocatalytic activity of the corresponding photocatalyst. Furthermore, all the experimental evidences, including Transient Absorption Spectroscopy measurements suggest that singlet oxygen is the actual oxidant. The Ir(III) analogues are considerably more photosensitive and consequently less efficient photosensitizers (PSs).</dc:description>

Moreover, the Ru(II) complexes, despite being non&#8208;emissive, display excellent activities in the selective photocatalytic transformation of benzylamines into the corresponding imines. The presence of an electron withdrawing group (&#8211;CF  3  ) on the arene ring of the N&#8208;(arylsulfonyl)&#8208;8&#8208;amidoquinolate ligand improves the photocatalytic activity of the corresponding photocatalyst. Furthermore, all the experimental evidences, including Transient Absorption Spectroscopy measurements suggest that singlet oxygen is the actual oxidant. The Ir(III) analogues are considerably more photosensitive and consequently less efficient photosensitizers (PSs).&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Chameleonic Behavior of the &#945;&#8208;Methylcyclopropyl Group and Its Through&#8208;Space Interactions: A Route to Stabilized Three Redox States in Diarylnitroxides</title>
      <dc:description>
Redox chameleons: First examples of nitroxide radicals containing &#945;&#8208;methylcyclopropyl (MCP) groups have been synthesized. Different orientations of the &#8220;chameleonic&#8221; MCP substituent relative to the phenyl ring are dependent on the redox state of the system, and through&#8208;space hyperconjugative interactions provide enhanced stability of the radical, cationic, and anionic forms and open the possibility of the new nitroxides to be used as ambipolar redox&#8208;active materials.







Abstract
The &#945;&#8208;methylcyclopropyl (MCP) group with conformationally dependent electronic properties is suggested as an additional structural &#8220;instrument&#8221; for stabilization of both open&#8208;shell and ionic states of diarylnitroxides, to be used as &#8220;ambipolar&#8221; redox active materials. New MCP&#8208;substituted diphenylnitroxides (fully characterized by electrochemical, spectral, and X&#8208;ray data) are the most stable nitroxides of the diaryl type known to date [&#964;1/2 in benzene exceeds three months (2310&#8197;h)]. The radicals are capable to reversible oxidation and reduction, yielding stable oxoammonium cations and aminoxyl anions. DFT investigation of the electronic structure and geometry of the compounds confirmed the conformational switching of the cyclopropyl orientation relative to the adjacent aromatic &#960; system is dependent on the nitroxide's redox state. Additional through&#8208;space stabilizing interaction between the &#960;&#8208;acceptor orbital of the NO+ moiety and the cyclopropyl &#8220;banana&#8221; bond orbital was also detected, highlighting its good hyperconjugative ability. The estimated &#963;(para)MCP value (&#8722;0.32) confirms its strong electron&#8208;donating properties.

Abstract
In this work, the ternary hybrid structure VSe2/SWCNTs/rGO is reported for supercapacitor applications. The ternary composite exhibits a high specific capacitance of 450&#8197;F&#8201;g&#8722;1 in a symmetric cell configuration, with maximum energy density of 131.4&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 and power density of 27.49&#8197;kW&#8201;kg&#8722;1. The ternary hybrid also shows a cyclic stability of 91&#8201;% after 5000&#8197;cycles. Extensive density functional theory (DFT) simulations on the structure as well as on the electronic properties of the binary hybrid structure VSe2/SWCNTs and the ternary hybrid structure VSe2/SWCNTs/rGO have been carried out. Due to a synergic effect, there are enhanced density of states near the Fermi level and higher quantum capacitance for the hybrid ternary structure compared to VSe2/SWCNTs, leading to higher energy and power density for VSe2/SWCNTs/rGO, supporting our experimental observation. Computed diffusion energy barrier of electrolyte ions (K+) predicts that ions move faster in the ternary structure, providing higher charge storage performance.

Artificial protein mimics: The self&#8208;assembly of five peptide coiled&#8208;coil motifs was templated by the hybridization of a d&#8208;DNA triplex or its mirror&#8208;image counterpart, an l&#8208;DNA triplex.

Abstract
DNA nanostructures have been designed and used in many different applications. However, the use of nucleic acid scaffolds to promote the self&#8208;assembly of artificial protein mimics is only starting to emerge. Herein five coiled&#8208;coil peptide structures were templated by the hybridization of a d&#8208;DNA triplex or its mirror&#8208;image counterpart, an l&#8208;DNA triplex. The self&#8208;assembly of the desired trimeric structures in solution was confirmed by gel electrophoresis and small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering, and the stabilizing synergy between the two domains was found to be chirality&#8208;independent but orientation&#8208;dependent. This is the first example of using a nucleic acid scaffold of l&#8208;DNA to template the formation of artificial protein mimics. The results may advance the emerging POC&#8208;based nanotechnology field by adding two extra dimensions, that is, chirality and polarity, to provide innovative molecular tools for rational design and bottom&#8208;up construction of artificial protein mimics, programmable materials and responsive nanodevices.

Studying the early phases of ferritin&#8208;assisted biomineralization in homopolymeric recombinant human ferritin shows that the process initiates from the inner cage surface. Time&#8208;resolved X&#8208;ray crystallography was successfully used to observe octa&#8208;nuclear iron cluster growth, starting from an initial (&#956;3&#8208;oxo) triiron seed anchored to glutamate residues on each subunit.

      <title>Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed ortho&#8208;Bromination of O&#8208;Phenyl Carbamates Accelerated by a Secondary Amide&#8208;Pendant Cyclopentadienyl Ligand</title>
      <dc:description>
A newly developed cyclopentadienyl rhodium(III) [CpARhIII] complex, bearing an acidic secondary amide moiety on the Cp ring, is able to catalyze the ortho&#8208;bromination of O&#8208;phenyl carbamates with NBS at room temperature. The presence of the acidic secondary amide moiety on the CpA ligand accelerates bromination by the hydrogen bond between the acidic NH group of the CpA ligand and the carbonyl group of NBS. This cover feature illustrates the activation of NBS by the above hydrogen bond. The background forest is inspired by the green chemistry aspect of this reaction.

      <title>Enhanced NiO dispersion on a high surface pillared heterostructure covered by niobium leads to an optimal behavior in the ODH of ethane</title>
      <dc:description>Nb&#8208;containing siliceous porous clay heterostructure (PCH) (Nb&#8208;content from 0 to 30 wt%), prepared from a bentonite, has been used as effective support in the preparation of supported NiO catalysts (with NiO loading from 15 to 80 wt%).

A high dispersion of nickel oxide (which presents a low crystallinity) has been observed when using the Nb&#8208;containing PCH supports. In addition, when NiO is supported on these Nb&#8208;containing porous clays, it displays a higher effectiveness in the ODH of ethane (ethylene selectivity of ca. 90 %) than NiO supported on the corresponding Nb&#8208;free siliceous PCH or on Nb  2  O  5  (ethylene selectivity of ca. 30 and 60 %, respectively).

      <title>Precursor Design Strategies for the Low&#8208;Temperature Synthesis of Functional Oxides: It's All in the Chemistry</title>
      <dc:description>
Overview of the different explored low&#8208;temperature strategies increasing the energy efficiency for functional oxide synthesis, taking into account the application of green precursors and atom economy considerations.







Abstract
Solution&#8208;based (multi)metal oxide synthesis has been carried out employing a large diversity of precursor routes. The selection of an appropriate synthesis strategy is frequently dictated by the resulting material properties, although this choice should also be based on green chemistry principles, atom economy considerations and energy efficiency. In order to limit the required energy budget to convert the chemical precursor to the target oxide material, various approaches were recently reported. This Review summarizes some frequently encountered low&#8208;temperature routes, critically assessing their application window and advantages. More specifically, auto&#8208;combustion synthesis, UV&#8208;assisted decomposition routes, sol&#8211;gel network adjustments and precursor complex design concepts are discussed. It is expected that this toolbox of low&#8208;temperature strategies may assist further progress in the field, stimulating novel applications, such as flexible electronics or organic&#8211;oxide hybrid materials, which are very sensitive to the temperature requirements.

      <title>Stability, Structure and Reconstruction of 1H&#8208;Edges in MoS2</title>
      <dc:description>
A complete density functional study of S&#8208;terminated edges in 1H&#8208;MoS2 finds new potential entropically favored structures for Mo&#8208;100&#8201;%S edges, and proposes a Peierls&#8217; distortion model explaining the stability of triply periodic Mo&#8208;50&#8201;%S edges.







Abstract
Density functional studies of the edges of single&#8208;layer 1H&#8208;MoS2 are presented. This phase presents a rich variability of edges that can influence the morphology and properties of MoS2 nano&#8208;objects, play an important role in industrial chemical processes, and find future applications in energy storage, electronics and spintronics. The so&#8208;called Mo&#8208;100&#8201;%S edges vertical S&#8208;dimers were confirmed to be stable, however the authors also identified a family of metastable edges combining Mo atoms linked by two&#8208;electron donor symmetrical disulfide ligands and four&#8208;electron donor unsymmetrical disulfide ligands. These may be entropically favored, potentially stabilizing them at high temperatures as a &#8220;liquid edge&#8221; phase. For Mo&#8208;50&#8201;%S edges, S&#8208;bridge structures with 3&#215; periodicity along the edge are the most stable, compatible with a Peierls&#8217; distortion arising from the d&#8208;bands of the edge Mo atoms. An additional explanation for this periodicity is proposed through the formation of 3&#8208;center bonds.

      <title>Exploring the Biocatalytic Potential of Fe/&#945;&#8208;Ketoglutarate&#8208;Dependent Halogenases</title>
      <dc:description>
Fe/&#945;&#8208;ketoglutarate halogenases are turning into valuable tools for the stereoselective incorporation of halogen atoms into unactivated C&#8722;H bonds. To date, halogenases which selectively derivatize free amino acids or indole alkaloids have been discovered. While first enzyme engineering examples highlight that the substrate scope can be expanded, structural and biochemical characterizations continue to inform about the enzymes&#8217; catalytic mechanism.







Abstract
Freestanding Fe/&#945;&#8208;ketoglutarate&#8208;dependent halogenases are oxidoreductases that catalyze the installation of halogen atoms into unactivated sp3&#8208;hybridized carbon centers with high stereo&#8208; and regioselectivity.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Fe/&#945;&#8208;ketoglutarate halogenases are turning into valuable tools&lt;/b&gt; for the stereoselective incorporation of halogen atoms into unactivated C&#8722;H bonds. To date, halogenases which selectively derivatize free amino acids or indole alkaloids have been discovered. While first enzyme engineering examples highlight that the substrate scope can be expanded, structural and biochemical characterizations continue to inform about the enzymes&#8217; catalytic mechanism.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Freestanding Fe/&#945;&#8208;ketoglutarate&#8208;dependent halogenases are oxidoreductases that catalyze the installation of halogen atoms into unactivated sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&#8208;hybridized carbon centers with high stereo&#8208; and regioselectivity. Since their discovery in 2014, a small number of indole alkaloid and amino acid halogenases have been identified and characterized. First enzyme engineering examples suggest that the accessible substrate range of these enzymes may be expanded through the use of rational enzyme design and directed evolution. Structural investigations of non&#8208;heme iron halogenases acting on freestanding as well as tethered substrates are beginning to inform about the principles of the underlying halogenation mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>C&#8722;F Arylation of Polyfluorophenols by Means of Sigmatropic Dearomatization/Defluorination Sequence</title>
      <dc:description>
Selective C&#8722;F arylation of polyfluorophenols with aryl sulfoxides has been accomplished by means of a sigmatropic dearomatization/defluorination sequence: interrupted Pummerer reaction, [3,3] sigmatropic rearrangement with dearomatization, and Zn&#8208;mediated defluorinative rearomatization. The utility of the strategy is demonstrated by the synthesis of a fluorinated analogue of Maxipost (see scheme).







Abstract
Selective C&#8722;F arylation of polyfluorophenols with aryl sulfoxides has been accomplished by means of a sigmatropic dearomatization/defluorination sequence. This sequence consists of three processes: 1)&#8197;interrupted Pummerer reaction to form S&#8722;O&#8208;tethered sulfonium salt; 2)&#8197;C&#8722;C&#8208;forming [3,3] sigmatropic rearrangement with dearomatization; and 3)&#8197;Zn&#8208;mediated defluorinative rearomatization. The present biaryl construction provides a facile access to polyfluorinated biaryls that is difficult to synthesize by other methods. The synthetic utility of the strategy is clearly demonstrated by the synthesis of a fluorinated analogue of Maxipost, a potassium channel modulator.

      <title>Synthesis of 3D IrRuMn Sphere as a Superior Oxygen Evolution Electrocatalyst in Acidic Environment</title>
      <dc:description>
Spherical electrocatalyst: A spherical IrRuMn catalyst is synthesized through a wet chemical approach. This catalyst exhibits exceptional performance for the OER, with an overpotential of 260&#8197;mV at a current density of 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in strongly acidic media.







Abstract
The design of a three&#8208;dimensional structure for an Ir&#8208;based catalyst offers a great opportunity to improve the electrocatalytic performance and maximize the use of the precious metal. Herein, a novel wet chemical strategy is reported for the synthesis of an IrRuMn catalyst with a sphere structure and porous features. In the synthetic process, the combined use of citric acid and formamide is requisite for the formation of the sphere structure. This method leads to a favorable 3D IrRuMn sphere structure with many fully exposed active sites. Furthermore, an alloying noble metal, such as Ir or Ru, with the transition metal leads to enhanced oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity. The doping of a transition metal, such as Mn, is an interesting example, because it exhibits stability and activity in both acidic and alkaline media. For the OER, the IrRuMn sphere catalyst exhibits an overpotential of 260&#8197;mV at a current density of 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in strongly acidic 0.1&#8201;m HClO4, which is superior to that of a commercial IrO2/C catalyst. This approach provides a novel way to synthesize an Ir&#8208;based multimetallic spherical electrocatalyst, which exhibits exceptional efficiency for the acidic OER. It will pave the way for new approaches to the practical utilization of PEM electrolyzers.

      <title>FeIII&#8211;Salen&#8208;Based Probes for the Selective and Sensitive Detection of E450 in Foodstuff</title>
      <dc:description>
Selective brightness: A selective FeIII&#8211;salen&#8208;based probe that fluorometrically detects pyrophosphate (alias E450) in baking powder by a disassembly approach is described.







Abstract
Inorganic pyrophosphate (PPi) is considered as a diagnostic marker for various diseases such as cancer and vascular calcification. PPi also plays an important preservative role as an additive E450 in foodstuff. In this work, a selective FeIII&#8211;salen&#8208;based probe for PPi is described; this probe disassembles in the presence of the target analyte into its molecular blocks, 1,2&#8208;propanediamine and 3&#8208;chloro&#8208;5&#8208;formyl&#8208;4&#8208;hydroxybenzenesulfonic acid. The latter signaling unit leads to a fluorometric response. Compared with a related prototype, the new complex shows a 2.3&#8208;times stronger emission at 500&#8197;nm and a 155&#8208;times better selectivity of PPi over adenosine triphosphate (ATP). Importantly, the new probe was successfully applied for detecting E450 in foodstuff.

      <title>Two&#8208;Dimensional MOF and COF Nanosheets: Synthesis and Applications in Electrochemistry</title>
      <dc:description>
Materials for electrochemistry: Metal&#8211;organic framework and covalent organic framework nanosheets represent one promising kind of power materials for electrochemical. Synthesis strategies, tailored material properties and different electrochemical performances are prominent features of supercapacitors, batteries, OER and HER. Metal&#8211;organic framework and covalent organic framework nanosheets comprehensively summarized and evaluations are given in this Review.







Abstract
Metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) and covalent organic framework (COF) nanosheets are a new type of two&#8208;dimensional (2D) materials with unique design principles and various synthesis methods. They are considered ideal electrochemical devices due to the ultrathin thickness, easily tunable molecular structure, large porosity and other unique properties. There are two common methods to synthesize 2D MOF/COF nanosheets: bottom&#8208;up and top&#8208;down. The top&#8208;down strategy mainly includes ultrasonic assisted exfoliation, electrochemical exfoliation and mechanical exfoliation. Another strategy mainly includes interface synthesis, modulation synthesis, surfactant&#8208;assisted synthesis. In this Review, the development of ultrathin 2D nanosheets in the field of electrochemistry (supercapacitors, batteries, oxygen reduction, and hydrogen evolution) is introduced, and their unique dimensional advantages are highlighted.
