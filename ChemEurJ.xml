      <title>Tuning the Topological Landscape of DNA&#8208;Cyclodextrin Nanocomplexes by Molecular Design</title>
      <dc:description>Here we report original molecular vectors that ensure broad flexibility to tune the shape and surface properties of plasmid DNA (pDNA) condensates. The prototypic design involves a cyclodextrin (CD) platform bearing a polycationic cluster at the primary face and a doubly&#8208;linked aromatic module bridging two consecutive monosaccharide units at the secondary face, which behaves as a topology&#8208;encoding element. Subtle differences at the molecular level then translate into disparate morphologies at the nanoscale, including rods, worms, toroids, globules, ellipsoids and spheroids. In vitro evaluation of the transfection capabilities revealed marked selectivity differences as a function of nanocomplex morphology. Remarkably high transfection efficiencies were associated to ellipsoidal or spherical shapes with a lamellar internal arrangement of pDNA chains and CD bilayers. Computational studies support that the stability of such supramolecular edifices is directly related to the tendency of the molecular vector to form noncovalent dimers upon DNA templation. Since the stability of the dimers depends on the protonation state of the polycationic clusters, the co&#8208;aggregates display pH responsiveness, which facilitates endosomal scape and timely DNA release, a key step in successful transfection. The results provide a versatile strategy for the construction of fully synthetic and perfectly monodisperse non&#8208;viral gene delivery systems uniquely suited for optimization schemes.</dc:description>

      <title>A Click Chemistry Approach to Developing Molecularly Targeted DNA Scissors</title>
      <dc:description>Nucleic acid click chemistry was used to prepare a family of chemically modified triplex forming oligonucleotides (TFOs) for application as a new gene&#8208;targeted technology. Azide&#8208;bearing phenanthrene ligands&#8212;designed to promote triplex stability and copper binding&#8212;were &#8216;clicked&#8217; to alkyne&#8208;modified parallel TFOs. Using this approach, a library of TFO hybrids was prepared and shown to effectively target purine&#8208;rich genetic elements in vitro. Several of the hybrids provide significant stabilisation toward melting in parallel triplexes (&gt;20 &#176;C) and DNA damage can be triggered upon copper binding in the presence of added reductant. Therefore, the TFO and &#8216;clicked&#8217; ligands work synergistically to provide sequence&#8208;selectivity to the copper cutting unit which, in turn, confers high stabilisation to the DNA triplex. To extend the boundaries of this hybrid system further, a click chemistry&#8208;based di&#8208;copper binding ligand was developed to accommodate designer ancillary ligands such as DPQ and DDPZ. When this ligand was inserted into a TFO, a dramatic improvement in targeted oxidative cleavage is afforded.</dc:description>

      <title>Zinc Imine Polyhedral Oligomeric Silsesquioxane as a Quattro&#8208;Site Catalyst for the Synthesis of Cyclic Carbonates from Epoxides and Low Pressure CO2</title>
      <dc:description>In the present research we designed, and hereby describe, the synthesis, spectroscopic characterization, and structural investigations of a unique Zn(II) complex of imine functionalized polyoctahedral oligomeric silsesquioxane (POSS) as a versatile platform for the synthesis of cyclic carbonates from epoxides and CO2  . The uncommon feature of the designed catalytic system is elimination of high pressure of CO2  and significant shortening of reaction times commonly associated with such difficult transformations as that of styrene oxide to styrene carbonate. Our studies have shown that imine&#8208;POSS is able to chelate metal ions like Zn(II) to form a unique coordination complex. The silsesquioxane core and the hindrance of the side arms (their steric effect) influence the construction process of the homoleptic  Zn4@POSS&#8208;1  complex. The compound was characterized in solution by: NMR (  1H,  13C,  29Si), ESI&#8208;MS, UV&#8722;vis and in solid state by: TG&#8208;DTA, elemental analysis, DRIFT, CP&#8208;MAS NMR (  13C,  29Si) and X&#8208;ray crystallography.</dc:description>

      <title>Hierarchical Synthesis, Structure, and Photophysical Properties of Gallium&#8208; and Ruthenium&#8208;Porphyrins with Axially Bonded Azo Ligands</title>
      <dc:description>Abstract:  &#160;The hierarchical synthesis of&#160;three porphyrin&#160;and&#160;four&#160;bisporphyrin derivatives is presented. This strategy relies on the incorporation linkers based on azo moieties appended with pyridyl and/or acetylenic groups that facilitate axial coordination to Ga&#8208; and Ru&#8208;metalloporphyrins. These porphyrinic systems allow for a quantitative analysis of the effects of diamagnetic anisotropy (DA) using&#160;  1  H NMR spectroscopic and X&#8208;ray crystallographic analyses. A simple power&#8208;law relationship between the proton chemical shift and distance from the porphyrin core is experimentally outlined, which confirms previous theoretical predictions and shows that the limit of DA is about 2 nm. Photophysical properties of the azo&#8208;linked porphyrins are analyzed by UV&#8208;vis spectroscopy, showing that significant&#160;  cis&#8208;trans  &#160;isomerization is not observed for azo ligands bound only to Ga&#8208;porphyrins. Incorporation of Ru&#8208;porphyrins to an azo ligand facilitates photoswitching behavior,&#160;but the process faces competition from decarbonylation of the Ru&#8208;porphyrin, and appreciable switching is only documented for&#160;  GaL1Ru  .</dc:description>

      <title>Mechanistic in situ and ex situ studies of phase transformations in molecular co&#8208;crystals</title>
      <dc:description>Co&#8208;crystallisation is widely explored as a route to improve the physical properties of pharmaceutical active ingredients, but little is known about the fundamental mechanisms of the process. Here we apply a novel hyphenated differential scanning calorimetry &#8208; X&#8208;ray diffraction technique to mimic the commercial hot melt extrusion process, and explore the heat&#8208;induced synthesis of four new co&#8208;crystals containing isonicotinamide.

The formation of co&#8208;crystals during heating is complex mechanistically. In addition to co&#8208;crystallisation, conversions between polymorphs of the co&#8208;former starting materials and co&#8208;crystal products are also observed. A subsequent study exploring the use of inkjet printing and milling to generate co&#8208;crystals revealed that the synthetic approach has a major effect on the co&#8208;crystal species and polymorphs produced.</dc:description>

A subsequent study exploring the use of inkjet printing and milling to generate co&#8208;crystals revealed that the synthetic approach has a major effect on the co&#8208;crystal species and polymorphs produced.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Hydrostibination of alkynes: A radical mechanism</title>
      <dc:description>The addition of Sb&#8208;H bonds to alkynes was reported recently as a new hydroelementation reaction that exclusively yields anti&#8208;Markovnikov  Z  &#8208;olefins from terminal acetylenes. We examine four possible mechanisms that are consistent with the observed stereochemical and regiochemical outcomes. A comprehensive analysis of solvent, substituent, isotope, additive, and temperature effects on hydrostibination reaction rates definitively refutes three ionic mechanisms involving closed&#8208;shell charged intermediates. Instead the data support a fourth pathway featuring open&#8208;shell neutral intermediates. Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations are consistent with this model, predicting an activation barrier that is in agreement with the experimental value (Eyring analysis) and a rate limiting step that is congruent with experimental kinetic isotope effect. We therefore conclude that hydrostibination of arylacetylenes is initiated by the generation of stibinyl radicals, which then participate in a cycle featuring Sb  II  and Sb  III  intermediates to yield the observed  Z  &#8208;olefins as products. This mechanistic understanding will enable rational evolution of hydrostibination as a methodology for accessing challenging products such as  Z  &#8208;olefins.</dc:description>

      <title>Helicity control in the aggregation of achiral squaraine dyes in solution and thin films</title>
      <dc:description>Squaraine dyes are well known for their strong absorption in the visible regime. Reports on chiral squaraine dyes are, however, scarce. To address this gap, we here report two novel chiral squaraine dyes and their achiral counterparts. The presented dyes are aggregated in solution and in thin films. A detailed chiroptical study shows that thin films formed by co&#8208;assembling the chiral dye with its achiral counterpart exhibit exceptional photophysical properties. The calculated dissymmetry factor  g  abs  of the co&#8208;assembled structures reaches a maximum when just 25% of the chiral dye are present in the mixture. The solid structures with the highest  g  abs  are achieved when the chiral dye is used solely as a director, rather than the structural component. The chiroptical data are further supported by selected spin&#8208;filtering measurements using mc&#8208;AFM. These findings provide a promising platform for investigating the relationship between the dissymmetry of a supramolecular structure and emerging material properties rather than a comparison between a chiral molecular structure and an achiral counterpart.</dc:description>

      <title>Full Thermal Switching Of Enzymes By Thermoresponsive Poly(2&#8208;oxazoline)&#8208;based Enzyme Inhibitors</title>
      <dc:description>Controlling the activity of enzymes is an important feature for many processes in medicine, bioanalytics, and biotechnology. So far it was not successful to fully switch biocatalysts ON and OFF by thermoresponsive enzyme inhibitors. Here, we present poly(2&#8208;oxazoline)s with IDA end groups (POx&#8208;IDA) that are LCST polymers and thus thermosensitive. They are capable of reversibly inhibiting the activity of horse radish peroxidase and laccase by more than 99%. Increasing the temperature makes the POx&#8208;IDA precipitate, which leads to 100% recovery of the respective enzyme activity. This switching cycle is fully reversible. The LCST of the POx&#8208;IDA can be tuned by varying the polymer composition to generate a wide range of switching windows.</dc:description>

      <title>Hybrid White Light&#8208;Emitting Electrochemical Cells Based on a Blue Cationic Iridium(III) Complex and Red Quantum Dots</title>
      <dc:description>Solid&#8208;state white light&#8208;emitting electrochemical cells (LECs) show promising advantages of simple solution fabrication processes, low operation voltage and compatibility with air&#8208;stable cathode metals, which are required for lighting applications. To date, white LECs based on ionic transition metal complexes (iTMCs) have been shown higher device efficiencies than white LECs employing other types of materials. However, relatively lower emission efficiencies of red iTMCs limit further improvement in device performance. Alternatively, efficient red CdZnSeS/ZnS core&#8208;shell quantum dots are integrated with a blue iTMC to form a hybrid white LEC in this work. With achieving good carrier balance under a proper device architecture, peak external quantum efficiency and power efficiency reach 11.2% and 15.1 lm W  &#8208;1  , respectively. Such device efficiency is indeed higher than those of the reported white LECs employing host&#8208;guest iTMCs. Time and voltage dependent electroluminescent (EL) characteristics of the hybrid white LECs are studied with the evidence of the temporal evolution of emission zone position extracted by fitting the simulated and measured EL spectra. The working principles of the hybrid white LECs are clarified and the high device efficiency renders the proposed new white&#8208;emitting devices suitable for solid&#8208;state lighting technology.</dc:description>

      <title>Enhanced Electrocatalytic Activity of a Zinc Porphyrin for CO2 Reduction: Cooperative Effects of Triazole Units in the Second Coordination Sphere</title>
      <dc:description>The control of the second coordination sphere in a coordination complex plays an important role in improving catalytic efficiency. Herein, we report a zinc porphyrin complex  ZnPor8T  with multiple flexible triazole units comprising the second coordination sphere, as an electrocatalyst for the highly selective electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide (CO  2  ) to carbon monoxide (CO). This electrocatalyst converted CO  2  to CO with a Faradaic efficiency of 99% and a current density of &#8211;6.2 mA/cm  2  at &#8211;2.4 V vs Fc/Fc  +  in  N,N  &#8208;dimethylformamide using water as the proton source. Structure&#8208;function relationship studies were carried out on  ZnPor8T  analogs containing different numbers of triazole units and distinct triazole geometries; these unveiled that the triazole units function cooperatively to stabilize the CO  2  &#8208;catalyst adduct in order to facilitate intramolecular proton transfer. Our findings demonstrate that incorporating triazole units that function in a cooperative manner is a versatile strategy to enhance the activity of electrocatalytic CO  2  conversion.</dc:description>

      <title>High energy density heteroatom (O, N and S) enriched activated carbon in rational design of symmetric supercapacitor</title>
      <dc:description>Carbon&#8208;based symmetric supercapacitors (SCs) are known for their high power and long cyclability, making them an ideal candidate for power sources in new generation electronic devices. To boost their electrochemical performances, deriving activated carbon with heteroatoms like (N, O, and S) are highly desirable for increasing the specific capacitance. In this regard,&#160;self&#8208;doped heteroatoms activated carbon (AC) materials directly derived from bio&#8208;waste of the lima&#8208;bean shell by different KOH activation processes. The heteroatom enriched AC synthesized from 1:2 ratio of pretreated carbon and KOH (ONS@AC&#8208;2) shows excellent surface morphology with a large surface area of 1508 m2 g&#8208;1. As an SCs electrode material, the presence of heteroatoms (N and S) reduces the interfacial charge transfer resistance and increase the ion&#8208;accessible surface area which inherently provides additional pseudocapacitance. The ONS@AC&#8208;2 electrode attains a maximum specific capacitance (Csp) of 342 F g&#8208;1 at a specific current of 1 A g&#8208;1 in 1 M NaClO4 electrolyte at the wide potential window of 1.8 V. Moreover, as symmetric SCs the ONS@AC&#8208;2 electrode delivers a maximum Csc of 191 F g&#8208;1 with a maximum specific energy of 21.48 Wh kg&#8208;1 and high specific power of 14000 W kg&#8208;1 and excellent retention of its initial capacitance value (98%) even for 10000 cycles of charge/discharge. In addition, a flexible supercapacitor fabricated utilizing ONS@AC&#8208;2 electrodes and LiCl/polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) based gel polymer electrolyte shows a maximum Csc of 119 F g&#8208;1 with considerable specific energy and power.</dc:description>

      <title>Structural design and synthesis of SnO2@C@Co&#8208;NC composite as high&#8208;performance anode material for lithium&#8208;ion batteries</title>
      <dc:description>To overcome the drawbacks of the structural instability and poor conductivity of SnO2&#8208;based anode materials, we designed and synthesized a hollow core&#8208;shell structured SnO2@C@Co&#8208;NC composite by employing the heteroatoms&#8208;doping and multi&#8208;confining strategy. This composite material displayed a much&#8208;reduced resistance for charge transfer and excellent cycling performance compared to the bare SnO2 NPs and SnO2@C composites. The doped heteroatoms and heterostructure boost the charge transfer, and the porous structure shortens the Li&#8208;ions diffusion pathway. Also, the volume expansion of SnO2 NPs was accommodated by the hollow space and restricted by the multi&#8208;shell of heteroatoms&#8208;doped carbon framework. As a result, this structured anode material delivered a high initial capacity of 1559.1 mA h g&#8208;1 at 50 mA g&#8208;1, and an initial charge capacity of 627.2 mA h g&#8208;1 at 500 mA g&#8208;1. Moreover, the discharge capacity could be maintained at 410.8 mA h g&#8208;1 after 500 cycles with an attenuation rate of only 0.069% per cycle. This multi&#8208;confined SnO2@C@Co&#8208;NC structure with superior energy density and durable lifespan is highly promising for the next&#8208;generation LIBs.</dc:description>

      <title>Highly Specific Recognition of Guanosine Using Engineered Base Excised Aptamers</title>
      <dc:description>Purines and their derivatives are highly important molecules in biology for nucleic acids synthesis, energy storage, and signaling. While many DNA aptamers have been obtained for binding adenine derivatives such as adenosine, AMP and ATP, the success for specific binding of guanosine has been limited. Instead of performing new aptamer selections, we report herein a base&#8208;excised strategy to engineer existing aptamers for binding guanosine. Both the Na+&#8208;binding aptamer and classical adenosine aptamer were manipulated as the base&#8208;excising scaffold. A total of seven guanosine aptamers were desined, in which a G16&#8208;deleted Na+&#8208;aptamer showed the highest binidng specificity and affinity for guanoisne, with an apparent Kd of 0.78 mM. Single monophosphate difference was recognizable. Both the aptamer scaffold generality and excised&#8208;site generality were systematically studied. Overall, this work provides a few guanosine binding aptamers by using non&#8208;SELEX method. It also provides deeper insights into engineering aptamers for molecular recognition.</dc:description>

      <title>Amphiphilic Polymeric Nanoparticles for Photoredox Catalysis in Water</title>
      <dc:description>
Photoredox catalysis takes a bath: Single&#8208;chain polymeric nanoparticles are utilized as an efficient and recyclable platform to perform photoredox catalysis in water. The reduction of aryl halides and C&#8722;C cross coupling reactions are studied upon UV&#8208;light illumination under ambient conditions.







Abstract
Photoredox catalysis has recently emerged as a powerful synthesis tool in organic and polymer chemistry. In contrast to the great achievements realized in organic solvents, performing photocatalytic processes efficiently in aqueous media encounters several challenges. Here, it is presented how amphiphilic single&#8208;chain polymeric nanoparticles (SCPNs) can be utilized as small reactors to conduct light&#8208;driven chemical reactions in water. By incorporating a phenothiazine (PTH) catalyst into the polymeric scaffold, metal&#8208;free reduction and C&#8722;C cross&#8208;coupling reactions can be carried out upon exposure to UV light under ambient conditions. The versatility of this approach is underlined by a large substrate scope, tolerance towards oxygen, and excellent recyclability. This approach thereby contributes to a sustainable and green way of implementing photoredox catalysis.

      <title>Modeling the Reaction of Carboxylic Acids and Isonitriles in a Self&#8208;Assembled Capsule</title>
      <dc:description>
Filling the capsule: Reactions of a carboxylic acid with n&#8208;butyl and isopropyl isonitriles in a self&#8208;assembled capsule were investigated by DFT. For R=iPr, the transition state and the product of the final, acyl transfer step are significantly shorter than the preceding intermediate, and this results in energetically unfavorable empty spaces inside the capsule, which cause a higher barrier, whereas for R=nBu the C4 chain can untwine and thus maintain an appropriate guest length.







Abstract
Quantum chemical calculations were used to study the reaction of carboxylic acids with isonitriles inside a resorcinarene&#8208;based self&#8208;assembled capsule. Experimentally, it has been shown that the reactions between p&#8208;tolylacetic acid and n&#8208;butyl isonitrile or isopropyl isonitrile behave differently in the presence of the capsule compared both with each other and also with their solution counterparts. Herein, the reasons for these divergent behaviors are addressed by comparing the detailed energy profiles for the reactions of the two isonitriles inside and outside the capsule. An energy decomposition analysis was conducted to quantify the different factors affecting the reactivity. The calculations reproduce the experimental findings very well. Thus, encapsulation leads to lowering of the energy barrier for the first step of the reaction, the concerted &#945;&#8208;addition and proton transfer, which in solution is rate&#8208;determining, and this explains the rate acceleration observed in the presence of the capsule. The barrier for the final step of the reaction, the 1,3 O&#8594;N acyl transfer, is calculated to be higher with the isopropyl substituent inside the capsule compared with n&#8208;butyl. With the isopropyl substituent, the transition state and the product of this step are significantly shorter than the preceding intermediate, and this results in energetically unfavorable empty spaces inside the capsule, which cause a higher barrier. With the n&#8208;butyl substituent, on the other hand, the carbon chain can untwine and hence uphold an appropriate guest length.

      <title>Distinct helical molecular orbitals through conformational lock</title>
      <dc:description>Several theoretical studies have proposed strategies to generate helical molecular orbitals (Hel&#8208;MOs) in [n]cumulenes. While chiral even&#8208;[n] cumulenes feature Hel&#8208;MOs, odd&#8208;[n] cumulenes may also present them if the terminal groups lie on different planes. However, the proposed systems have been either experimentally unfeasible or resulted in opposite pseudo&#8208;degenerated Hel&#8208;MOs. We hereby demonstrate the introduction of a remarkable energy difference between helical orbitals of opposite twist by fixing the torsion angle between the terminal groups in butadiyne fragments. In order to experimentally lock the conformation of the terminal groups, we designed and synthesized cyclic architectures by combining acetylenes with chiral spirobifluorenes. The high stability of these systems with distinct helical orbitals allowed their isolation and full characterization. In our view these results constitute a milestone in the development of real systems presenting helical molecular orbitals.</dc:description>

      <title>Alternating Magnetic Field (AMF) Controlled Targeting Drug Delivery Based on Graphene Oxide&#8208;Grafted Nano&#8208;Supramolecules</title>
      <dc:description>Graphene oxide (GO)&#8208;grafted nano&#8208;supramolecules have been recently emerged as a neoteric nano&#8208;drug carrier in therapy of refractory diseases. Herein, we reported an original multicomponent nano&#8208;supramolecular drug carrier based on targeted peptide and magnetic GO whose behavior of drug releasing can be regulate by alternating magnetic field (AMF). This multicomponent nano&#8208;supramolecular carrier was composed of &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin (&#946;&#8208;CD)/nickel nanoparticle&#8208;modified graphene oxide (GONiCD) and mitochondrial ion&#8208;targeting peptide (MitP)&#8208;grafted hyaluronic acid (HAMitP). Owing to the host&#8208;guest interaction between &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin and the cyclohexyl groups on MitP, GONiCD and HAMitP could form supramolecular assemblies during the doxorubicin (Dox)&#8208;loading process, not only remarkably enhancing the drug&#8208;loading capacity, but also improving the drug&#8208;releasing efficiency under the stimulus of alternating magnetic field (AMF). During co&#8208;incubation with the tumor cells, the Dox&#8208;loading assemblies could strongly target the tumor mitochondria, and damage both the mitochondria and the nuclei, owing to Dox release from the assemblies induced by AMF.

      <title>Tuning the ground and excited state dynamics of hemithioindigo molecular motors by substituents</title>
      <dc:description>Efficiency and performance of light triggered molecular motors are crucial features that need to be mechanistically understood in order to improve the performance and enable conscious property tailoring for specific applications. In this work three different hemithioindigo based molecular motors are investigated and all four steps in their complete unidirectional rotation are unraveled fully quantitatively. Transient absorption spectroscopy across twelve orders in magnitude in time is used to probe the fs nuclear motions up to the ms thermal kinetics covering the timeframe of the whole motor rotation. The newly known full mechanism allows simulating the motor system to scrutinize its performance at realistic illumination conditions. This highlights the importance of photoisomerization quantum yields for the rotation speed. The substitution pattern in close proximity to the rotation axle influences the excited and ground state properties. Reduction of electron donation and concomitant increase of steric hindrance leads to faster photoisomerization reactions with quasi&#8208;ballistic behavior, but also to a slight decrease in the quantum efficiency. The expected decelerating effects of increased sterics are primarily manifested in the ground state. A promising approach for next generation hemithioindigo motors is to elevate electron donation at the rotor fragment followed by an increase of steric hindrance.</dc:description>

      <title>The Photoisomerization Pathway(s) of Push&#8208;Pull Phenylazoheteroarenes</title>
      <dc:description>Azoheteroarenes are the most recent derivatives targeted to further improve the properties of azo&#8208;based photoswitches. Their light&#8208;induced mechanism for trans&#8208;cis isomerization is assumed to be very similar to that of the parent azobenzene.

While the controversy seems settled in azobenzene, the extent to which the same conclusions apply to the more structurally&#8208;diverse family of azoheteroarenes is unclear. Here, we unravel by means of non&#8208;adiabatic molecular dynamics, the photoisomerization mechanism of three prototypical phenyl&#8208;azoheteroarenes with an increasing push&#8208;pull character. The evolution of the rotational and inversion conical intersection energies, the preferred pathway, and the associated kinetics upon both n&#960;* and &#960;&#960;* excitations can be linked directly with the push&#8208;pull substitution effects. Overall, we clarify the working conditions of this family of azo&#8208;dyes and identify a possibility to exploit push&#8208;pull substituents to tune their photoisomerization mechanism, with potential impact on their quantum yield.</dc:description>

      <title>Multiscale approach of spin crossover materials &#8208; a concept mixing Russian dolls and domino effects</title>
      <dc:description>The spin crossover (SCO) phenomenon corresponds to a modification that originates at the atomic scale. However, the simple consideration of the transformations that occur following the SCO at this scale or in its close vicinity does not allow anyone to truly understand, anticipate and thus take advantage of what happens at the scale of the material, and even less at the device one. As the fruit of years of work and experience on this phenomenon, we formalize here the concept of the multiscale understanding of SCO. Clearly, the deflagration generated by the initial impressive atomic modification on all the physical scales of the solid must be understood in terms of structure&#8208;properties relationships that fit together, like Russian dolls, and propagate according to a kind of domino effect. Each scale can both give different and independent consequences from those of the other scales but at the same time can influence those of a larger or smaller scale, the whole being imperatively to take into account. The concept appears well illustrated by the volume modification, always the same at the atomic level but drastically different and adaptable, in amplitude and sense, at any other physical scale. This approach results in a much wider range of potential applications than the atomic level alone initially suggests, including one serious path to shape memory materials.</dc:description>

      <title>Transition&#8208;Metal&#8208;Free Coupling of 1,3&#8208;Dipoles and Boronic Acids as a Sustainable Approach to C&#8722;C Bond Formation</title>
      <dc:description>
A scalable and metal&#8208;free approach to carbon&#8211;carbon bond formation using 1,3&#8208;dipole systems generated from hydrazonyl chloride or hydroxamoyl chloride precursors and aryl boronic acid derivatives is reported. Generation of the 1,3&#8208;dipole results in activation of the boronic acid, with migration of the pendant aryl group to forge a new C&#8722;C bond in yields up to 80&#8201;% (see scheme).







Abstract
The need for alternative, complementary approaches to enable C&#8722;C bond formation within organic chemistry is an on&#8208;going challenge in the area. Of particular relevance are transformations that proceed in the absence of transition&#8208;metal reagents. In the current study, we report a comprehensive investigation of the coupling of nitrile imines and aryl boronic acids as an approach towards sustainable C&#8722;C bond formation. In situ generation of the highly reactive 1,3&#8208;dipole facilitates a Petasis&#8211;Mannich&#8208;type coupling via a nucleophilic boronate complex. The introduction of hydrazonyl chlorides as a complementary nitrile imine source to the 2,5&#8208;tetrazoles previously reported by our laboratory further broadens the scope of the approach. Additionally, we exemplify for the first time the extension of this protocol into another 1,3&#8208;dipole, through the synthesis of aryl ketone oximes from aryl boronic acids and nitrile N&#8208;oxides.

      <title>Density Functional Theory Study of Pd Aggregation on a Pyridine&#8208;Terminated Self&#8208;Assembled Monolayer</title>
      <dc:description>
How to aggregate: DFT calculations for the initial stage of Pd electrodeposition onto a pyridine&#8208;terminated self&#8208;assembled monolayer (SAM) are reported. By using periodic models and methods comprising standard structure optimization and molecular dynamic simulations, the large energetic driving force for the initial metal aggregation is predicted.







Abstract
By using density functional theory calculations, the initial steps towards Pd metal cluster formation on a pyridine&#8208;terminated self&#8208;assembled monolayer (SAM) consisting of 3&#8208;(4&#8208;(pyridine&#8208;4&#8208;yl)phenyl)propane&#8208;1&#8208;thiol on an Au(1&#8201;1&#8201;1) surface are investigated. Theoretical modelling allows the investigation of structural details of the SAM surface and the metal/SAM interface at the atomic level, which is essential for elucidating the nature of Pd&#8211;SAM and Pd&#8211;Pd interactions at the liquid/solid interface and gaining insight into the mechanism of metal nucleation in the initial stage of electrodeposition. The structural flexibility of SAM molecules was studied first and the most stable conformation was identified, planar molecules in a herringbone packing, as the model for Pd adsorption. Two binding sites are found for Pd atoms on the pyridine end group of the SAM. The strong interaction between Pd atoms and pyridines illustrates the importance of SAM functionalisation in the metal nucleation process. Consistent with an energetic driving force of approximately &#8722;0.3&#8197;eV per Pd atom towards Pd aggregation suggested by static calculations, a spontaneous Pd dimerisation is observed in ab initio molecular dynamic studies of the system. Nudged elastic band calculations suggest a potential route with a low energy barrier of 0.10&#8197;eV for the Pd atom diffusion and then dimerisation on top of the SAM layer.

      <title>Fluorogenic Protein Probes with Red and Near&#8208;Infrared Emission for Genetically Targeted Imaging</title>
      <dc:description>Fluorogenic probes are important tools to image proteins with high contrast and no wash protocols. In this work, we rationally designed and synthesized a small set of four protein fluorogens with red or near&#8208;infrared emission. The fluorophores were characterized in the presence of albumin as a model protein environment and exhibited good fluorogenicity and brightness (fluorescence quantum yield up to 36 %). Once conjugated to a haloalkane ligand, the probes reacted with the protein self&#8208;labeling tag HaloTag with a high fluorescence enhancement (up to 156&#8208;fold). The spectroscopic properties of the fluorogens and their reaction with HaloTag were investigated  in vitro  experimentally and with the help of molecular dynamics. The two most promising probes, one in the red and one in the near&#8208;infrared range, were finally applied to image the nucleus or actin in live&#8208;cell and in wash&#8208;free conditions using fluorogenic and chemogenetic targeting of HaloTag fusion proteins.</dc:description>

      <title>Conformational Sensing by a Mammalian Olfactory Receptor</title>
      <dc:description>
Rotate to activate: Precisely what molecular features do the olfactory GPCRs sense in odorant ligands? The rodent Olfr2 receptor binds aliphatic aldehydes indiscriminately, but conformational restriction experiments on the flexible agonist, octanal, correlates the C5&#8722;C6 rotamer position with different receptor outputs&#8212;activation, partial activation, or antagonism. Thus, an olfactory GPCR can carry out conformational analysis during odor recognition.







Abstract
To identify odors, the mammalian nose deploys hundreds of olfactory receptors (ORs) from the rhodopsin&#8208;like class of the G&#8197;protein&#8208;coupled receptor superfamily. Odorants having multiple rotatable bonds present a problem for the stereochemical shape&#8208;based matching process assumed to govern the sense of smell through OR&#8211;odorant recognition. We conformationally restricted the carbon chain of the odorant octanal to ask whether an OR can respond differently to different odorant conformations. By using calcium imaging to monitor signal transduction in sensory neurons expressing the mouse aldehyde OR, Olfr2, we found that the spatial position of the C7 and C8 carbon atoms of octanal, in relation to its &#8722;CHO group, determines whether an aliphatic aldehyde functions as an agonist, partial agonist or antagonist. Our experiments provide evidence that an odorant can manipulate an OR through its intrinsic conformational repertoire, in unexpected analogy to the photon&#8208;controlled aldehyde manipulation observed in rhodopsin.

      <title>Escaping from Flatland: Stereoconvergent Synthesis of 3&#8208;Dimensional Scaffolds via Ruthenium(II)&#8208;Catalyzed Noyori&#8208;Ikariya Transfer Hydrogenation.</title>
      <dc:description>Noyori&#8208;Ikariya&#8208;type ruthenium(II)&#8208;catalysts for asymmetric transfer hydrogenation (ATH) have been known for 25 years and have proved as a well&#8208;behaved and user&#8208;friendly platform for the synthesis of chiral secondary alcohols. A progress has been made in the past five years in understanding the asymmetric reduction of complex ketones, where up to four stereocenters can be controlled in a single chemical transformation. Intriguing multi&#8208;chiral molecular architectures are therefore available in few well understood and robust synthetic steps from commercially available building blocks, and possess handles for additional functionalization. The aim of this review is to showcase the availability of three&#8208;dimensional scaffolds and homo&#8208;chiral lead&#8208;like compounds via ATH and inspire their direct use in drug discovery endeavors. Basic mechanistic insights are provided to demystify the stereo&#8208;chemical outcomes, as well as examples of diastereoselective transformations of enantiopure alcohols to give a feeling of how these rigid non&#8208;planar molecules can be further elaborated.</dc:description>

      <title>Handling (Nano&#8208;)Silver as Antimicrobial Agent: Therapeutic Window, Dissolution Dynamics, Detection Methods and Molecular Interactions</title>
      <dc:description>Silver is a well&#8208;known antimicrobial agent known since antiquity.

A thorough search of literature from chemistry, materials and environmental science, biology and medicine lead to this review in which we resume the potential use of silver and its compounds in medicine, ongoing processes of dissolution and the different methods by which this usefulness can be evaluated. It also highlights the therapeutic window of silver, mechanistic interactions of silver and biological media as well as best practices for handling silver in a biomedical environment.

Single&#8208;ion magnets (SIMs) are magnetic compounds that could retain their magnetization after removing the field but due to noninteracting isolated magnetic ions (as it is illustrated by the figure) instead of domains in classical ferromagnets. Usually they are constructed from metal&#8211;organic complexes of magnetic d or f ions but here, a Minireview of another approach that is using inorganic solid state compounds as a matrix for individual magnetic ions with SIM properties is presented by M.&#8197;A.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A &#8220;Mill &amp; Shake&#8221; process to make DNA fragments &lt;/b&gt;: This study demonstrates that di&#8208; and trinucleotides can be assembled under ball&#8208;milling conditions by multi&#8208;step reactions, in a one&#8208;pot fashion, and in the absence of bulk solvents. The process is fully compatible with H&#8208;phosphonate and phosphoramidite chemistries, currently applied to oligo&#8208;DNA and RNA synthesis. For more information, see the Communication by M.&#8197;J. Damha et&#8197;al. on &lt;a&gt;https://doi.org/10.1002/chem.202001193page&#8197;8857&#8197;ff.&lt;/a&gt;

      <title>Ratiometric Detection of ATP by Fluorescent Cyclophanes with Bellows&#8208;Type Sensing Mechanism</title>

The cover feature illustrates the mechanism of ATP detection by a new fluorescent receptor in aqueous solution. The receptor works like bellows: it exists in solution in a stacked form but opens only for binding of ATP. Moreover, the receptor represent an example of a ratiometric probe, which changes its color from yellow to blue upon ATP recognition. Test tubes in the picture display our efforts to separate the pyrene derivatives by column chromatography. More information can be found in the Full Paper by E.&#8197;A. Kataev et&#8197;al.

      <title>Thermal Adaptation of Enzymes: Impacts of Conformational Shifts on Catalytic Activation Energy and Optimum Temperature</title>

Evolution has led to conserved enzyme families that efficiently catalyze the same chemical reaction but in radically different thermal environments. In particular, some enzymes need to be stable and to work in very hot conditions that usually lead to protein melting. Using atomistic simulations and analytic modeling, it is shown that the temperature&#8208;dependence of the enzyme accessible conformations plays a key role in the determination of its optimum working temperature, that cannot be predicted from its melting temperature alone.

      <title>Thermal Elimination of Ethylene from Cyclobutyl Groups Characterized by X&#8208;ray Crystallography in a Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Matrix
</title>
      <dc:description>
The thermolytic expulsion of ethylene from cyclobutyl rings isolated in a metal&#8211;organic framework matrix delivers vinyl&#8208;substituted aromatic compounds that cannot be prepared by conventional synthetic routes.







Abstract
Methods to synthesize and characterize aromatic molecules with vinyl substituents are sought after yet limited in the literature. Here, we introduce cyclobutyl groups into a metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) matrix that are poised to produce ethylene upon heating. The expulsion of ethylene produces vinyl groups on an aromatic core, which are isolated by the crystalline matrix of the framework. This enables full characterization of the thermolysis by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. Further, we modify the vinyl groups by a bromine addition reaction. Importantly, the two transformations happen in a single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal manner without changing the overall network structure of the parent framework. New insights into the structural and synthetic chemistry of this important class of compound are generated. Installing reactive vinyl tags in materials by the high temperature thermolysis of cyclobutyl groups is a powerful strategy for altering their physicochemical characteristics.

     alt="Thermal Elimination of Ethylene from Cyclobutyl Groups Characterized by X&#8208;ray Crystallography in a Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Matrix&amp;#xA;"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The thermolytic expulsion &lt;/b&gt; of ethylene from cyclobutyl rings isolated in a metal&#8211;organic framework matrix delivers vinyl&#8208;substituted aromatic compounds that cannot be prepared by conventional synthetic routes.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Methods to synthesize and characterize aromatic molecules with vinyl substituents are sought after yet limited in the literature. Here, we introduce cyclobutyl groups into a metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) matrix that are poised to produce ethylene upon heating. The expulsion of ethylene produces vinyl groups on an aromatic core, which are isolated by the crystalline matrix of the framework. This enables full characterization of the thermolysis by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. Further, we modify the vinyl groups by a bromine addition reaction. Importantly, the two transformations happen in a single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal manner without changing the overall network structure of the parent framework. New insights into the structural and synthetic chemistry of this important class of compound are generated. Installing reactive vinyl tags in materials by the high temperature thermolysis of cyclobutyl groups is a powerful strategy for altering their physicochemical characteristics.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Growth and Atomic&#8208;Scale Characterization of Ultrathin Silica and Germania Films: The Crucial Role of the Metal Support</title>
      <dc:description>The present research article reports on the preparation and atomic&#8208;scale characterization of the thinnest possible films of the glass&#8208;forming materials silica and germania. To this end state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art surface science techniques, in particular scanning probe microscopy, and density functional theory calculations have been&#160; employed. The investigated films range from monolayer to bilayer coverage where both, the crystalline and the amorphous films, contain characteristic XO$_4$ (X=Si,Ge) building blocks. A side&#8208;by&#8208;side comparison of silica and germania monolayer, zigzag phase and bilayer films supported on Mo(112), Ru(0001), Pt(111), and Au(111) leads to a more general comprehension of the network structure of glass former materials. This allows us to understand the crucial role of the metal support for the pathway from crystalline to amorphous ultrathin film growth.</dc:description>

      <title>Asymmetric Host Molecule bearing Pyridine Core for Highly Efficient Blue Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence&#8208;OLEDs</title>
      <dc:description>In this study, two host materials, pCzBzbCz  and pCzPybCz  , were synthesized for achieving high efficiency and long lifetime of blue thermally activated delayed fluorescence&#8208;organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (TADF&#8208;OLEDs). The molecular design strategy is conducted by introducing pyridine group into the core structure of pCzPybCz  as an electron&#8208;withdrawing unit and electron&#8208;donating phenyl group into the structure of pCzBzbCz  . These host materials demonstrated good thermal stability and high triplet energy (T 1  = 3.07 eV for pCzBzbCz  and 3.06 eV for pCzPybCz  ) for fabricating blue TADF&#8208;OLEDs. In particular, pCzPybCz  &#8208;based OLED devices demonstrated an external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 22.7% and an operational lifetime of 24 h (LT 90  , time to attain 90% of initial luminance) at an initial luminance of 1000 cd m &#8208;2  . This superior lifetime could be explained by the C&#8208;N bond dissociation energy (BDE) in the host molecular structure. Furthermore, a mixed host system using the electron&#8208;deficient 2,4&#8208;bis(dibenzo[ b,d  ]furan&#8208;2&#8208;yl)&#8208;6&#8208;phenyl&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triazine (DDBFT) was proposed to inhibit the formation of anion state of our host materials. In short, the device operational lifetime was further improved by applying DDBFT. The carbazole&#8208;based asymmetric host molecule containing pyridine core realized a high&#8208;efficiency blue TADF&#8208;OLED, showing a positive effect on the operating lifetime and can provide useful strategies for designing new host materials.</dc:description>

The thermal and photophysical properties of RPL&#8208;1 were investigated using thermogravimetric analysis and absorbance, fluorescence, and lifetime spectroscopies.

      <title>Photoregulation of Gene Expression with Amantadine&#8208;modified Caged siRNAs Through Host/Guest Interaction</title>
      <dc:description>RNA interference (RNAi) is an essential and powerful tool for targeting and verifying specific gene functions. Conditional control of siRNA activity, especially using light activation, is a potential method to regulate target gene expression and functions. Here, a series of photolabile siRNAs with amantadine modification were rationally designed and developed through host/guest interaction of amantadine and &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin derivatives to enhance the blocking effect of siRNA binding and/or processing. These caged siRNAs with amantadine modification at the 5&#8217;end of antisense&#8208;strand RNA were efficiently inactivated due to the host/guest interaction of amantadine and &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin. Photomodulation of gene silencing activity of these amantadine&#8208;modified caged siRNAs targeting both exogenous and endogenous genes was successfully achieved with low leaking activity, which indicated that host/guest interaction could be a new strategy for developing new caged siRNAs for gene photoregulation.</dc:description>

      <title>Spatiotemporal studies of the one dimensional coordination polymer [Fe(ebtz)2(C2H5CN)2](BF4)2. Tug of war &#8208; nitrile reorientation versus crystal lattice as tool for tuning of spin crossover properties</title>
      <dc:description>Reaction of 1,2&#8208;di(tetrazol&#8208;2&#8208;yl)ethane (ebtz) with Fe(BF4)2&#183;6H2O in different nitriles yields one dimensional coordination polymers [Fe(ebtz)2(RCN)2](BF4)2&#8901;nRCN (n  =2 for R=&#8208;CH3&#160;  (1) and  n=0 for R=&#8208;C2H5&#160;  (2),&#8208;C3H7&#160;  (3),&#8208;C3H5&#160;  (4),&#8208;CH2Cl (5)) exhibiting spin crossover (SCO). SCO in  1  and  3&#8208;5  is complete and occurs above 160 K. In  2  it is shifted to lower temperatures and is accompanied by wide hysteresis (T1/2&#8595;=78 K, T1/2&#8593;=123 K) and proceeds extremely slow. Isothermal (80K) time resolved single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction studies revealed a complex nature of the HS&#8594;LS transition in  2  . Initial, slow stage is associated with shrinkage of polymeric chains and with reduction of cell volume at 77% (in relation to difference between cell volumes VHS  &#8208;VLS  ) whereas only 16% of iron(II) ions changed spin state. In the second stage an abrupt SCO commences, associated with breathing of crystal lattice along direction of Fe&#8208;nitrile bonds, while the nitriles reorient. HS&#8594;LS switching triggered by light (808 nm) reveals the coupling of spin state and nitrile orientation. The importance of this coupling was confirmed by studies of [Fe(ebtz)2(C2H5CN/C3H7CN)2  ](BF4)2  mixed crystals (2a,  2b), showing a shift of T1/2  to higher values and narrowing of the hysteresis loop occurring together with an increase of fraction of butyronitrile. This increase reduces the capability of nitriles molecules to reorient. Density functional theory (DFT) studies of models of  1&#8208;5  suggest a particular possibility of  2  to adopt a low (140&#8208;145&#176;) value of its Fe&#8208;N&#8208;C(propionitrile) angle.</dc:description>

      <title>Enhanced Performance of Zirconium&#8208;Doped Ceria Catalysts for the Methoxycarbonylation of Anilines</title>
      <dc:description>The methoxycarbonylation of anilines stands as an attractive method for the phosgene&#8208;free production of carbamates. Despite the high yields reported for ceria as catalyst, the reduction of the amount of side products and the prevention of catalyst deactivation still represent major hurdles in this chemistry. One advantage of ceria is the possibility of tuning its reactivity by doping its lattice with other metals. A series of doped ceria&#8208;based materials, prepared by substitution with metals, are evaluated in the methoxycarbonylation of 2,4&#8208;diaminotoluene with dimethylcarbonate. Among all catalysts, containing Eu, Hf, La, Pr, Sm, Tb, Y or Zr oxides, ceria with 2 mol% ZrO2 exhibited 96% selectivity towards the desired carbamates, improving the CeO2 catalyst. Density functional theory demonstrates that two descriptors are needed: (i) a geometric factor that governs the reduction of energy barriers for carbamate formation through ureas; (ii) catalyst basicity as N&#8208;H bonds need to be activated. Assessment in subsequent reaction cycles revealed that the CeO2/ZrO2 catalyst is more stable than bulk CeO2, along with the reduction of fouling processes.</dc:description>

      <title>Isolated Cobalt Ions Embedded in Magnesium Oxide Nanostructures: Spectroscopic Properties and Redox Activity</title>

      <title>Selective hydrolysis of terminal glycosidic bond in &#945;&#8208;1&#8208;acid glycoprotein promoted by Keggin and Wells&#8208;Dawson type heteropolyacids</title>
      <dc:description>The reactivity of a range of Keggin and Wells&#8208;Dawson type heteropolyacids (HPAs): H3PW12O40 H4SiW12O40, H3PMo12O40, K6P2W18O62, and NaH2W12O4, towards the heavily glycosylated &#945;&#8208;1&#8208;acid glycoprotein (AGP) is reported. Sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS&#8208;PAGE) and high&#8208;performance anion exchange chromatography with pulsed amperometric detection (HPAEC&#8208;PAD) show that after incubation of the protein with HPAs at 80 &#176;C and pH 2.8 complete hydrolysis of terminal glycosidic bond has been achieved, resulting in the removal of sialic acids with no observed destruction of the protein core or the residual glycan chains. The 1H NMR spectroscopy confirmed that the released sialic acids preserve intact structure upon their excision from the protein, which makes the reported method suitable for the analysis of sialic acid modifications which play an important role in numerous biological processes. The presence of other sugars was not detected by 1H NMR and HPAEC&#8208;PAD, suggesting that HPAs hydrolyze only the terminal glycosidic bond in the glycoprotein, resulting in the selective release of sialic acid from AGP. The observed rate constants were in the range 6,7 x 10&#8208;2 &#8208;11,9 x 10&#8208;2 min&#8208;1 and the complete and selective excision of sialic acids could be achieved within 60 min of incubation. The Trp fluorescence and CD spectroscopy show that non&#8208;covalent interaction between HPA and protein takes place in solution which could lead to stabilization of the sialosyl cation that is formed during the glycosidic bond hydrolysis by anionic HPA cluster.</dc:description>

As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, we explored the use of Poly(1&#8208;vinylimidazole) brushes primer obtained via surface&#8208;initiated atom transfer radical polymerization (SI&#8208;ATRP) for the synthesis of Zn&#8208;based ZIF&#8208;8 MOF films. By modifying the grafting density of the brushes, smooth porous films were obtained featuring both, the inherently hydrophobic microporosity arising from ZIF&#8208;8 structure, and an additional constructional interparticle mesoporosity, which can be employed for differential adsorption of targeted adsorbates. We have found that grafting density modulates the constructional porosity of the films obtained; higher grafting densities result in more compact structures, while lower grafting density, generates increasingly inhomogeneous films with a higher proportion of interparticle constructional porosity.</dc:description>

      <title>New&#160;Supercage Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Based on Medicine Molecule Ligands Showing&#160;Acetylene Storage and Separation</title>
      <dc:description>To develop efficient adsorbent materials for storage and separation of C2H2, an unprecedented supercage MOF, [Me2NH2]&#183;[Zn3(ALP)(TDC)2.5]&#183;3.5DMF&#183;2H2O (1) was constructed through medicine molecule allopurinol (ALP) and S&#8208;containing 2,5&#8208;Thiophenedicarboxylic acid (H2TDC). 1 contains a novel linear trinuclear cluster that is composed by ALP and carboxylates and forms a final uncommon 5&#8208;connected yfy topological framework. The framework possesses three types of interlinked cages decorated by rich functional sites, and reveals not only high adsorption capacity for C2H2 but also excellent selective separation for C2H2/CO2 and C2H2/CH4 at 298 K. Dynamic breakthrough experiments on C2H2/CO2 (1:1) mixture and C2H2/CH4 (1:1) mixture also demonstrated the potential of the material to separate C2H2 from CO2 or CH4 mixtures. Molecular simulations were also studied to identify the different CO2&#8208; and C2H2&#8208; binding sites in 1, such as carboxylate groups, S atoms and carbonyl groups.</dc:description>

      <title>Structures and Chemical Bonding in Antimony(III) Bromide complexes with Pyridine</title>
      <dc:description>Weakly&#160;or &#8220;partially&#8221; bonded molecules are an important link between the chemical and van der Waals interactions. Molecular structures of six new SbBr  3  &#8211; Py complexes in the solid state have been determined by the single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis.

To reveal the nature of Sb&#8208;Br and Sb&#8208;N interactions, the DFT calculations were performed followed by the analysis of the electrostatic potentials, the orbital interactions and the topological analysis.

A simple structural parameter, non&#8208;covalence index (NCI) is defined as a ratio of the atom&#8208;atom distance to the linear combination of &#160;sums of covalent and van der Waals radii.

      <title>DNA alkylation of the RUNX&#8208;binding sequence by CBI&#8208;PI polyamide comjugates</title>
      <dc:description>Many types of molecular targeted drugs that inhibit cancer growth by acting on specific molecules have been developed. The runt&#8208;related transcription factor (RUNX) family, which induces cancer development by binding to a specific DNA sequence, has attracted attention as a new target for cancer treatment. We have developed Chb&#8208;M &#162; , which targets the RUNX&#8208;binding sequence. Chb&#8208;M &#162; was developed by conjugating pyrrole&#8211;imidazole (PI) polyamides and chlorambucil as an anticancer agent. It was recently reported that Chb&#8208;M &#162; had a remarkable anticancer effect in vivo. In this study, to explore the possibility of an alternative structure, we designed a new series of CBI&#8211;PI polyamides, in which seco&#8208;CBI was applied as a DNA&#8208;alkylating agent. We examined the characteristics of the CBI&#8211;PI polyamides targeting the RUNX&#8208;binding sequence and found that these conjugates have great potential for cancer treatment.</dc:description>
