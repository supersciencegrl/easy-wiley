      <title>Recyclable Ruthenium Catalyst for Distal meta&#8208;C&#8211;H Activation</title>
      <dc:description>We disclose the unprecedented hybrid&#8208;ruthenium catalysis for distal meta &#8208;C&#8211;H activation. The hybrid&#8208;ruthenium catalyst was recyclable, as was proven by various heterogeneity tests, and fully characterized with various microscopic and spectroscopic techniques, highlighting the physical and chemical stability. Thereby, the hybrid&#8208;ruthenium catalysis proved broadly applicable for meta &#8208;C&#8211;H alkylations of among others purine&#8208;based nucleosides and natural product conjugates. Additionally, its versatility was further reflected by meta &#8208;C&#8211;H activations through visible&#8208;light irradiation, as well as para &#8208;selective C&#8211;H activations.</dc:description>

      <title>Nucleation of Tiny Silver Nanoparticles Using a Tetrafacial Organic Molecular Barrel for Potential Use in Visible Light Triggered Photocatalysis</title>
      <dc:description>Coordination&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly of discrete molecular architectures of diverse shapes and sizes is well studied in last three decades. Use of dynamic imine bond for designing analogous metal&#8208;free architectures is a growing challenge in recent time. This article reports an organic molecular barrel (OB4R) as a potential template for nucleation and stabilization of very tiny (&lt; 1.5 nm) Ag nanoparticles (AgNPs). Imine bond condensation of a rigid tetra&#8208;aldehyde with a flexible diamine followed by imine&#8208;bond reduction yielded the discrete tetragonal organic barrel (OB4R). Presence of molecular pocket ornamented with eight diamine moieties is potential for encapsulation of silver(I). The organic barrel was finally used as a molecular vessel for the controlled nucleation of AgNPs with fine size tuning via binding of Ag(I) ions in the confined space of barrel followed by reduction. Transmission electron microscopic (TEM) analysis of the Ag(0)@OB4R composite revealed that the mean particle size is 1.44&#177;0.16 nm. The composite material has ~52 wt% silver loading. The barrel supported ultrafine AgNPs [Ag(0)@OB4R] are found to be efficient photocatalyst for facile Ullmann&#8208;type aryl&#8208;amination coupling of haloarenes at ambient temperature without using any additives. The catalyst was stable for several cycles of reuse without any agglomeration. The new composite Ag(0)@OB4R represents the first example of discrete organic&#8208;barrel supported AgNPs employed as photocatalyst in Ullmann&#8208;type coupling reaction at room temperature.</dc:description>

      <title>Tailoring a Dress to Single Protein Molecules: Proteins Can Do It Themselves through Localized Photo&#8208;Polymerization and Molecular Imprinting.</title>
      <dc:description>Molecularly imprinted nanoparticles (MIP NPs) are antibody&#8208;like recognition materials prepared by a template assisted synthesis. MIP NPs able to target biomolecules, like proteins, are under the spotlight for their great potential in medicine, but using the molecular imprinting technique with biological macromolecular templates efficiently is still very challenging. Here we propose generating a molecular imprint in single NPs, by photochemically initiating the polymerization from individual protein templates. In this way, each protein molecule somehow tailors itself its own 'polymeric dress'. For this, the template protein is covalently coupled with a photoinitiator, Eosin Y. Irradiated with light at 533 nm, the Eosin moiety acts as an antenna and transfers energy to a co&#8208;initiator (an amine), which generates a radical and initiates polymerization. As a result, a polymer network is forming only around the very template molecule, producing cross&#8208;linked NPs of 50 nm, with single binding sites showing high affinity (K D 10 &#8208;9 M) for their biological target, and selectivity over other proteins.</dc:description>

More importantly, it also possesses excellent cycle stability to maintain 80.6% capacitance after 5000 cycles. An asymmetric supercapacitor device utilizing Mn0.1&#8208;Ni&#8208;MOF/NF as the positive electrode and activated carbon as the negative electrode attains a high energy density of 39.6 Wh kg&#8208;1 at 143.8 W kg&#8208;1 power density with a capacitance retention of 83.6% after 5000 cycles.</dc:description>

An asymmetric supercapacitor device utilizing Mn0.1&#8208;Ni&#8208;MOF/NF as the positive electrode and activated carbon as the negative electrode attains a high energy density of 39.6 Wh kg&#8208;1 at 143.8 W kg&#8208;1 power density with a capacitance retention of 83.6% after 5000 cycles.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Hydrolysis of Peptide Bonds in Protein Micelles Promoted by a Zirconium(IV)&#8208;Substituted Polyoxometalate as an Artificial Protease</title>
      <dc:description>
The hydrolysis of hydrophobic and unstructured proteins is difficult due to their poor solubility in aqueous solutions. This study demonstrates the ability of ZrIV&#8208;substituted Keggin polyoxometalate (Et2NH2)10[Zr(&#945;&#8208;PW11O39)2] to promote selective hydrolysis of &#946;&#8208;casein, an intrinsically unstructured protein consisting of 209 amino acids. The amphipathic nature of &#946;&#8208;casein causes it to assemble into large micelles, in which the hydrophilic part of the protein is solvent exposed and able to interact with Zr&#8208;POM that activates peptide bonds towards hydrolysis. More information can be found in the Full Paper by T.&#8197;N. Parac&#8208;Vogt et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202001920).

      <title>Octaboraneyl Complexes of Nickel: Monomers for Redox&#8208;Active Coordination Polymers</title>
      <dc:description>
Eight pendant boranes are better than one for the activation of Lewis bases. A new diphosphine ligand that features four pendant borane groups has been prepared. The coordination chemistry of this new scaffold has been established using nickel&#8212;giving an octaboraneyl Ni0 complex; this species reacts readily with Lewis bases such as 4&#8208;(dimethylamino)pyridine and 4,4&#8217;&#8208;bipyridine. In the latter case, an unusual air&#8208;sensitive open&#8208;shell Ni&#8208;coordination polymer is obtained, which has been characterized in the solid state.

A series of pentanuclear coinage&#8208;metal&#8208;containing complexes is synthesized and high&#8208;level spectroscopic and theoretical investigations are applied to elucidate the cooperative effects between a coinage metal triangle and the ruthenium centers with respect to structures, electronic transitions, and redox properties.

      <dc:description>
Aggregation and self&#8208;assembly of nuclear coactivator binding domain of CREB&#8208;binding protein was studied under different experimental conditions. Single l&#8208; or d&#8208;enantiomers fold into left&#8208; or right&#8208;handed helical structures at neutral pH while &#946;&#8208;sheet amyloid arrangement occurs under acidic conditions. Mixtures of both enantiomers promote self&#8208;assembly into amyloid &#946;&#8208;sheet structures highlighting the role of chirality in the formation of thermodynamically more stable racemic &#946;&#8208;sheet structures.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Aggregation and self&#8208;assembly &lt;/b&gt; of nuclear coactivator binding domain of CREB&#8208;binding protein was studied under different experimental conditions. Single &lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;l &lt;/span&gt;&#8208; or &lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;d &lt;/span&gt;&#8208;enantiomers fold into left&#8208; or right&#8208;handed helical structures at neutral pH while &#946;&#8208;sheet amyloid arrangement occurs under acidic conditions. Mixtures of both enantiomers promote self&#8208;assembly into amyloid &#946;&#8208;sheet structures highlighting the role of chirality in the formation of thermodynamically more stable racemic &#946;&#8208;sheet structures.

      <dc:description>
Selective C&#8722;H bond functionalization catalyzed by metal complexes have completely revolutionized the way in which chemical synthesis is conceived nowadays. Full control of the site&#8208;selectivity of this process is as desirable as it is challenging in transition metal catalysis, especially for benzanilide derivatives. In this Review by R. Gramage&#8208;Doria on page&#8197;9688&#8197;ff., the developments of these methodologies are discussed.

      <dc:description>
Sequential, domino and tandem reactions could be defined as a sequence of synthetic transformations that occur one after the other, in the same reaction flask. This Review highlights recent advances on the transition&#8208;metal&#8208;mediated C&#8722;H activation as a trigger of cascade reactions for the synthesis of heterocycles. To shed some light on this research area at the intersection of two fields, focus was put on the reaction mechanism rather than on the type of metal or the chronological order of the reaction. The aim is to separate and highlight the true domino reactions initiated by C&#8722;H activation, compared to other examples of C&#8722;H functionalization for heterocycle synthesis.

      <dc:description>
Over the past several years, transition&#8208;metal&#8208;mediated chemical reactions have been increasingly used for chemo&#8208; and regioselective modification of biomolecules. In this Minireview, by J. Rodr&#237;guez and M. Mart&#237;nez&#8208;Calvo on page&#8197;9792&#8197;ff., the recent developments in this rapidly evolving field have been summarized. While most biomolecule functionalization reactions have been carried out in vitro on isolated samples of the corresponding biomolecule, some examples of biomolecule derivatization in more complex biological environments have also been described.

      <dc:description>
The conformation of a molecule strongly affects its function, as demonstrated for peptides and nucleic acids. This correlation is much less established for carbohydrates, the most abundant organic materials in nature. In this Minireview, recent achievements in the structural characterization of carbohydrates, enabled by systematic studies of chemically defined oligosaccharides, are discussed.

      <dc:description>
The spatial colocalization and the nanoscale confinement of functional biomolecules in natural systems are widespread mechanisms that regulate a number of cell activities. This, alongside recent progresses in DNA nanotechnology, represents a source of inspiration for the design of artificial, nucleic acid&#8208;based systems with programmable properties. In this Minireview, it is highlighted and discussed how effective molarity&#8208;driven processes induced by biomolecular confinement can be engineered and applied to synthetic DNA&#8208;based systems.

      <title>Control of Axial Chirality by Planar Chirality Based on Optically Active [2.2]Paracyclophane</title>
      <dc:description>Optically active X&#8208;shaped molecules based on the planar chiral [2.2]paracyclophane building block were prepared, in which di(methoxy)terphenyl units were stacked on the central benzene rings. At 25 &#176;C, anisolyl rings freely rotate in solution, while in the crystal form, they are fixed by intramolecular CH&#8208;&#960; interactions, thereby leading to the expression of the axial chirality, i.e., propeller chirality was exhibited by the planar chiral [2.2]paracyclophane moiety. The X&#8208;shaped molecule exhibited good circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) profiles with moderate  &#934;  PL  and a large  g  lum  value in the order of 10  &#8211;3  at 25 &#176;C, in solution. In contrast, at &#8211;120 &#176;C, dual CPL emission with opposite signs was observed. According to the theoretical studies, the rotary motion of the anisolyl units is suppressed in the excited states, and so emission from two isomers could be observed. These results demonstrate that the axial chirality was controlled by the planar chirality, leading ultimately to propeller chirality.</dc:description>

      <title>Rational design of a&#160; Zn(II)&#8208;MOF with multiple functional sites for highly efficient fixation of CO2 at mild conditions: A combined experimental and theoretical investigation</title>
      <dc:description>The development of efficient heterogeneous catalysts suitable for carbon capture and utilization (CCU) under mild conditions is a promising step towards mitigating the growing concentration of CO2&#160;in the atmosphere. Consequently, herein we report construction of a novel hydrogen&#8208;bonded 3D framework, {[Zn(hfipbba)(MA)].3DMF}n (HbMOF1) by utilizing Zn(II) center, a partially fluorinated, long&#8208;chain dicarboxylate ligand (hfipbba) and an amine&#8208;rich melamine (MA) co&#8208;ligand. Interestingly, the framework possesses two types of 1D channels decorated with CO2&#160;&#8208;philic (&#8208;NH2&#160;and &#8208;CF3) groups promoting highly selective CO2&#160;adsorption properties to the framework&#160;which was further supported by&#160;the computational simulations.&#160;Further, the synergistic involvement of both Lewis acidic and basic sites exposed in the confined 1D pores along with high thermal and chemical stability rendered HbMOF1&#160;an ideal heterogeneous catalyst for highly efficient fixation of CO2&#160;with terminal/internal epoxides at mild conditions of RT and 1 bar CO2. Moreover, in&#8208;depth theoretical studies were carried out by periodic Density Functional Theory (DFT) to obtain the relative energy for each stage involved in the catalytic&#160;reaction and an insight mechanistic details of the&#160;reaction is presented.

      <title>Bimetallic Rod&#8208;Packing Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Combining Two Charged Forms of 2&#8208;Hydroxyterephthalic Acid</title>
      <dc:description>
Ordered heterometallic rod: A unique rod&#8208;packing metal&#8208;organic framework features an unprecedented bimetallic rod with crystallographically distinguishable metal sites and two charged forms (&#8722;3 and &#8722;2) of the H3OBDC ligand. This new inorganic building block has the potential to generate high&#8208;density open&#8208;metal sites.







Abstract
Although many rod&#8208;packing metal&#8208;organic frameworks are known, few are based on ordered heterometallic rod building unit. We show here the synthesis of CPM&#8208;76 based on an unprecedented Zn&#8208;Mg bimetallic rod with crystallographically distinguishable metal sites. The configuration of the rod offers two types of coordination site with trigonal bipyramidal and octahedral sites selectively occupied by Zn and Mg, respectively. Also unusual is the inter&#8208;connection mode between the rods, which is based on dual&#8208;charged forms (&#8722;3 and &#8722;2) of the 2&#8208;hydroxyterephthalic acid (H3OBDC) ligand. Interestingly, each metal site in CPM&#8208;76 binds one solvent molecule, leading to a high density of solvent binding sites.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ordered heterometallic rod &lt;/b&gt;: A unique rod&#8208;packing metal&#8208;organic framework features an unprecedented bimetallic rod with crystallographically distinguishable metal sites and two charged forms (&#8722;3 and &#8722;2) of the H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;OBDC ligand. This new inorganic building block has the potential to generate high&#8208;density open&#8208;metal sites.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although many rod&#8208;packing metal&#8208;organic frameworks are known, few are based on ordered heterometallic rod building unit. We show here the synthesis of CPM&#8208;76 based on an unprecedented Zn&#8208;Mg bimetallic rod with crystallographically distinguishable metal sites. The configuration of the rod offers two types of coordination site with trigonal bipyramidal and octahedral sites selectively occupied by Zn and Mg, respectively. Also unusual is the inter&#8208;connection mode between the rods, which is based on dual&#8208;charged forms (&#8722;3 and &#8722;2) of the 2&#8208;hydroxyterephthalic acid (H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;OBDC) ligand. Interestingly, each metal site in CPM&#8208;76 binds one solvent molecule, leading to a high density of solvent binding sites.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Destabilizing Alkaline Water by 3d&#8208;Metal (Oxy)(Hydr)Oxides for Improved Hydrogen Evolution</title>
      <dc:description>Alkaline water electrolysis enables the use of nonprecious metal&#8208;based catalysts and therefore holds great promise for large&#8208;scale generation of renewable hydrogen fuel, especially when driven by renewable energy sources, such solar and wind. However, the sluggish kinetics of water adsorption and dissociation steps in alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) lower its energy conversion efficiency. Recent achievements have proved that 3d  &#8208;metal (oxy)(hydr)oxides can accelerate these two kinetic processes and thereby improve the activity of diverse HER electrocatalysts from experimental and theoretical points of view. Moreover, a positive role of strong coupling between HER catalysts and 3d  &#8208;metal (oxy)(hydr)oxides has been discovered recently. In this minireview we provide a compendious introduction to recent progress, including experiments and theory.

      <title>Control of intermolecular photoinduced electron transfer in deoxyadenosine&#8208;based fluorescent probes</title>
      <dc:description>In this paper, we report on the Photoinduced Electron Transfer ( PET) reaction between a donor (adenine analog) and an acceptor (3&#8208;methoxychromone dye,  3MC  ) in the context of designing efficient fluorescent probes as DNA sensors. Firstly, Gibbs energy was investigated in disconnected donor&#8208;acceptor systems by Rehm&#8208;Weller equation. The oxidation potential of the adenine derivative was responsible for exergonicity of the PET reaction in separated combinations. Then, the PET reaction in donor&#8208;&#960;&#8208;acceptor conjugates was investigated using steady&#8208;state fluorescence spectroscopy, acid&#8208;mediated PET inhibition and transient absorption techniques. In conjugated systems, PET is a favorable pathway of fluorescent quenching when an electron&#8208;rich adenine analog (  d7A  ) was connected to the fluorophore (  3MC  ). We found that formation of ground&#8208;state complexes even at nM concentration range dominated the dye photophysics and generated poorly emissive species likely through intermolecular PET from  d7A  to  3MC  . On the other hand, solution acidification disrupts complexation and turns on the dye emission. Bridging an electron&#8208;poor adenine analog with high oxidation potential (  8d7A  ) to  3MC  presenting low reduction potential is another alternative to prevent complex formation and produce highly emissive monomer conjugates.</dc:description>

      <title>Dynameric Collagen Self&#8208;healing Membranes with High Mechanical Strength for Effective Cell Grow Applications</title>
      <dc:description>The fabrication of biocompatible adaptive materials with high stiffness and self&#8208;healing properties for medical applications is a challenging endeavor. Collagen is a major&#160;extracellular matrix component acting as a substrate for cell adhesion and migration. Dynamers are constitutional polymers whose monomeric components are linked through reversible bonds, able to modify their constitution via reversible exchange of their components. In the current work, we demonstrate that the rational combination of collagen and dynameric networks connected with reversible covalent imine bonds is a very important and previously unreported strategy to provide biocompatible membranes with self&#8208;healing ability and excellent mechanical strength. The key challenge in the construction of such membranes is the interaction between collagen and the cross&#8208;linkers, preventing the formation of defects. For example, by varying structure and molecular lengths of the dynamers, the tensile strength of the dynameric membranes reach over 80 MPa, more than 400% higher than that observed of the reference collagen membrane and the highest value for break strain was recorded 19%. The self&#8208;healing property was observed when reconnecting two membrane pieces or even from crushed status of the membranes. Moreover, both MTT assay and confocal laser scanning microscopy method demonstrated the good biocompatibility of the collagen membranes, leaving more than 90% viability for NIH 3T3 cells after 24 h co&#8208;culture.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>
A new series of 2,4,6&#8208;triaryl&#8208;&#955;5&#8208;phosphinines were synthesized and characterized. Supported by DFT calculations, the structure&#8211;property relationships of these unsaturated phosphorus heterocycles were investigated in detail. For the first time, an organic light&#8208;emitting device was developed based on a blue phosphinine emitter.

A new series of 2,4,6&#8208;triaryl&#8208;&#955;5&#8208;phosphinines have been synthesized that contain different substituents both on the carbon backbone and the phosphorus atom of the six&#8208;membered heterocycle. Their optical and redox properties were studied in detail, supported by in&#8208;depth theoretical calculations. The modularity of the synthetic strategy allowed the establishment of structure&#8211;property relationships for this class of compounds and an OLED based on a blue phosphinine emitter could be developed for the first time.

      <title>Template&#8208;Controlled Synthesis of Polyimidazolium Salts by Multiple [2+2] Cycloaddition Reactions</title>
      <dc:description>
Polyimidazolium cations: The octakisimidazolium salt H8&#8208;5(BF4)8 has been obtained from two equivalents of tetrakisimidazolium salt H4&#8208;2(BF4)4 in a template synthesis via the tetranuclear octakis&#8208;NHC complex [Ag4(2)2] followed by postsynthetic irradiation and formation of four cyclobutane linkers between the two tetra&#8208;NHC ligands and demetallation. The binding of selected anions by H8&#8208;5(BF4)4 has been studied.







Abstract
The tetrakisimidazolium salt H4&#8208;2(Br)4, featuring a central benzene linker and 1,2,4,5&#8208;(nBu&#8208;imidazolium&#8208;Ph&#8208;CH=CH&#8208;) substituents reacts with Ag2O in the presence of AgBF4 to yield the tetranuclear, oktakis&#8208;NHC assembly [3](BF4)4. Cation [3]4+ features four pairs of olefins from the two tetrakis&#8208;NHC ligands perfectly arranged for a subsequent [2+2] cycloaddition. Irradiation of [3](BF4)4 with a high pressure Hg lamp connects the two tetra&#8208;NHC ligands through four cyclobutane linkers to give compound [4](BF4)4. Removal of the template metals yields the novel oktakisimidazolium salt H8&#8208;5(BF4)8. The tetrakisimidazolium salt H4&#8208;2(BF4)4 and the oktakisimidazolium salt H8&#8208;5(BF4)8 have been used as multivalent anion receptors and their anion binding properties towards six different anions have been compared.

      <dc:description>
Activity&#8208;directed synthesis was harnessed in the function&#8208;driven discovery of inhibitors of a protein&#8211;protein interaction. Pairs of substrates, inspired by known ligands, were exploited in 346 microscale reactions. The crude reaction mixtures were screened for biological function, and the products of promising reactions purified and characterised. Four novel and distinct inhibitor series were discovered.

      <title>Enabling Control over Mechanical Conformity and Luminescence in Molecular Crystals: Interaction Engineering in Action</title>
      <dc:description>Molecular crystals of&#160;&#960;&#8208;conjugated molecules are of great interest as the highly ordered dense packing offers superior charge and exciton transport. However, integration into optoelectronic devices remains a major challenge due to its inherent brittle nature. Herein, we report the control over mechanical conformity in the single crystals of pyridine appended thiazolothizaole derivative by modulating the molecular packing through interaction engineering. Two polymorphs were prepared by achieving control over the thermodynamic/kinetic factors of crystallization, one of the polymorphs exhibits elastic bending while the other is brittle. The control over the bending ability was achieved by forming co&#8208;crystals with hydrogen/halogen bond donors. A seamless extended criss&#8208;cross pattern with respect to the bend plane through ditopic H&#8208;bonding motif showed the highest compliance towards elastic bending, while the co&#8208;crystals with a layered criss&#8208;cross arrangement with the segregated layers of co&#8208;formers exhibit slightly lower bending conformity. Our results update the rationale behind the plastic/elastic bending in molecular crystals. The co&#8208;crystals of ditopic halogen bond co&#8208;crystals are particularly appealing for waveguiding applications as the co&#8208;crystals blends high mechanical flexibility and luminescence properties. The hydrogen bond co&#8208;crystals are non emissive in nature due to excited state proton transfer dynamics. The rationale behind the fluorescence properties of these materials were also established from DFT calculations in a QM:MM framework.</dc:description>

      <title>Intracellular Photophysics of an Osmium Complex bearing an Oligothiophene Extended Ligand</title>
      <dc:description>This contribution describes the excited&#8208;state properties of an Osmium&#8208;complex when taken up into human cells. The complex 1 [Os(bpy)2(IP&#8208;4T)](PF6)2 with bpy = 2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine and IP&#8208;4T = 2&#8208;{5'&#8208;[3',4'&#8208;diethyl&#8208;(2,2'&#8208;bithien&#8208;5&#8208;yl)]&#8208;3,4&#8208;diethyl&#8208;2,2'&#8208;bithiophene}imidazo[4,5&#8208;f][1,10]phenanthroline) can be discussed as a candidate for photodynamic therapy in the biological red/NIR window. The complex is taken up by MCF7 cells and localizes rather homogeneously within in the cytoplasm. To detail the sub&#8208;ns photophysics of 1, comparative transient absorption measurements were carried out in different solvents to derive a model of the photoinduced processes.

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;This contribution describes the excited&#8208;state properties of an Osmium&#8208;complex when taken up into human cells. The complex 1 [Os(bpy)2(IP&#8208;4T)](PF6)2 with bpy = 2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine and IP&#8208;4T = 2&#8208;{5'&#8208;[3',4'&#8208;diethyl&#8208;(2,2'&#8208;bithien&#8208;5&#8208;yl)]&#8208;3,4&#8208;diethyl&#8208;2,2'&#8208;bithiophene}imidazo[4,5&#8208;f][1,10]phenanthroline) can be discussed as a candidate for photodynamic therapy in the biological red/NIR window. The complex is taken up by MCF7 cells and localizes rather homogeneously within in the cytoplasm. To detail the sub&#8208;ns photophysics of 1, comparative transient absorption measurements were carried out in different solvents to derive a model of the photoinduced processes. Key to rationalize the excited&#8208;state relaxation is a long&#8208;lived 3ILCT state associated with the oligothiophene chain. This model was then tested with the complex internalized into MCF7 cells, since the intracellular environment has long been suspected to take big influence on the excited state properties.

      <title>Flexible &#960;&#8208;Conjugated 2,5&#8208;Diarylamino&#8208;terephthalates: A New Class of Mechanochromic Luminophores with Tunable Aggregation States</title>
      <dc:description>The generation of different thermodynamically (meta)stable states is crucial for the development of smart solid&#8208;state luminescent materials. However, the design of luminophores with tunable aggregation states is remaining a grand challenge. Herein, we present a family of mechanochromic luminophores with tunable metastable states, based on the dynamically controllable &#960;&#8722;&#960; stacking of the flexible &#960;&#8208;conjugated structure of 2,5&#8208;diarylamino&#8208;terephthalates in the solid&#8208;state. The experimental data revealed that both the kinetically controlled metastable state and thermodynamic controlled stable state can be generated via tuning the intermolecular interactions such as &#960;&#8722;&#960; stacking and hydrogen bonds. As a result, the highly sensitive mechano&#8208;stimuli response of these luminophores has been successfully achieved.</dc:description>

      <title>Function&#8208;Topology Relationship in Catalytic Hydrolysis of Chemical Warfare Simulant inTwo Zr&#8208;MOFs</title>
      <dc:description>Due to the grate surface area, high concentration of active metal sites and water stability, zirconium(VI)&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic frameworks (Zr&#8208;MOFs) have shown excellent activity for the hydrolysis of organophosphorus nerve agents (OPNs). In this regard, for the first time, two topologically different Zr&#8208;MOFs (Zr&#8208;  fcu  &#8208;tmuc and Zr&#8208;  bcu  &#8208;tmuc; build up from same organic and inorganic building blocks) were rationally chosen to investigate the effect of network topology on catalytic hydrolysis of nerve agent simulant, dimethyl&#8208;4&#8208;nitrophenyl phosphate (DMNP). Remarkable enhancement in the DMNP hydrolysis rate was observed using Zr&#8208;  bcu  &#8208;tmuc, reducing the half&#8208;life more than three times compared to Zr&#8208;  fcu  &#8208;tmuc. Higher accessibility toward active Zr(VI) sites in 8&#8208;connected  bcu  net versus 12&#8208;connected  fcu  , lead to faster hydrolysis of DMNP on Zr&#8208;  bcu  &#8208;tmuc. Intrestingly, the higher activity of Zr&#8208;  bcu  &#8208;tmuc was also confirmed by its higher fluorescence sensitivity toward DMNP (LOD: 0.557 &#181;M) compared to Zr&#8208;  fcu  &#8208;tmuc (LOD: 1.09 &#181;M). The results showed that dictating the desired topology in Zr&#8208;MOFs, is a useful strategy to improve their performance in catalytic detoxification and detection of OPNs.</dc:description>

      <title>Crucial role of water in the mechanosynthesis of CsPbI3 and other ABX3 halides</title>
      <dc:description>Mechanochemical synthesis of CsPbI  3  , as a model system for ABX  3  halides, was studied. Water was shown to strongly promote the kinetics of formation of CsPbI  3  from the CsI+PbI  2  mixture through increased mobility of the constituting ionic species. Since many binary and ternary halides are hygroscopic, it was concluded that the presence of small, uncontrollable and unintentional additions of water should often occur in both precursor mixtures and synthesized complex halides boosting the kinetics of formation of many, if not all, ternary organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid halides such as, for example, MAPbX  3  (X=Cl, Br, I). In addition, trace amounts of water should influence the transport characteristics of complex halides.

      <title>Direct Introduction of an Alkylsulfonamido Group on C&#8208;sites of Isomeric Carboranes; the Influence of Stereochemistry on Inhibitory Activity Against Cancer&#8208;associated Carbonic Anhydrase IX Isoenzyme</title>
      <dc:description>Carbonic Anhydrase IX (CA IX), a tumor&#8208;associated metalloenzyme, represents a validated target for cancer therapy and diagnostics. Herein, we report the inhibition properties of isomeric families of sulfonamidopropyl&#8208;dicarba&#8208;  closo  &#8208;dodecaboranes group(s) prepared using a new direct five&#8208;step synthesis from the corresponding parent cages. The protocol offers a reliable solution for synthesis of singly and doubly substituted dicarba&#8208;  closo  &#8208;dodecaboranes with a different geometric position of carbon atoms. The  closo  &#8208; compounds from the  ortho  &#8208; and  meta  &#8208; series were then degraded to corresponding 11&#8208;vertex dicarba&#8208;  nido  &#8208;undecaborate(1&#8208;) anions. All the compounds show  in vitro  enzymatic activity against CA IX in the low nanomolar or subnanomolar range. This is accompanied by clear isomer dependence of the inhibition constant (  K  i) and selectivity towards CA IX. Decreasing trends in  K  i and selectivity index (S  I  ) values are observed with increasing separation of the cage carbon atoms. Interactions of compounds with the active sites of CA IX were explored with X&#8208;ray crystallography, and eight high&#8208;resolution crystal structures uncovered the structural basis of inhibition potency and selectivity.</dc:description>

      <title>Unraveling the Mechanism of the Ir(III)&#8208;Catalyzed Regiospecific Synthesis of &#945;&#8208;Chlorocarbonyl Compounds from Allylic Alcohols</title>
      <dc:description>We have used experimental studies and DFT calculations to investigate the Ir(III)&#8208;catalyzed isomerization of allylic alcohols into carbonyl compounds, and the regiospecific isomerization&#8211;chlorination of allylic alcohols into &#945;&#8208;chlorinated carbonyl compounds. The mechanism involves a hydride elimination followed by a migratory insertion step that may take place at C&#946; but also at C&#945; with a small energy&#8208;barrier difference of 1.8 kcal/mol. After a protonation step, calculations show that the final tautomerization can take place both at the Ir center and outside the catalytic cycle. For the isomerization&#8211;chlorination reaction, calculations show that the chlorination step takes place outside the cycle with an energy barrier much lower than that for the tautomerization to yield the saturated ketone. All the energies in the proposed mechanism are plausible, and the cycle accounts for the experimental observations.</dc:description>

      <title>Fe3O4@C Nanotubes Grown on Carbon Fabric as a Free&#8208;Standing Anode for High Performance Li&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
      <dc:description>Recently, Li&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) have attracted extensive attention due to their wide application in portable and flexible electronic devices, and such huge market of LIBs causes an ever&#8208;increase demand of excellent mechanical flexibility, outstanding cycling life and superior rate capability electrodes. Herein, an anode of self&#8208;supported Fe3O4@C nanotubes grown on carbon fabric cloth (CFC) is rationally designed via an  in&#8208;situ  etching and deposition route, combined with an annealing process. These carbon&#8208;coated nanotube structured Fe3O4  arrays with large surface area and enough void space, can not only moderate the volume variation during the repeated Li  +  insertion/extraction, but also facilitate Li  +  /electrons transportation and electrolyte penetration. Such a novel structure design endows Fe3O4@C nanotube arrays stable cycle performance (a large reversible capacity of 900 mA h g  &#8208;1  up to 100 cycles at 0.5 A g  &#8208;1  ) and outstanding rate capability (a reversible capacity of 1030, 985, 908, and 755 mA h g  &#8208;1  at 0.15, 0.3, 0.75, and 1.5 A g  &#8208;1  , respectively).

      <title>Hybridorubrins A&#8722;D, novel azaphilone heterodimers from stromata of Hypoxylon fragiforme and insights into the biosynthetic machinery for azaphilone diversification</title>
      <dc:description>The diversity of azaphilones in stromatal extracts of the fungus  Hypoxylon fragiforme  was investigated and linked to their biosynthetic machineries using bioinformatics. Nineteen azaphilone&#8208;type compounds were isolated and characterized by NMR spectroscopy and mass spectrometry, with their absolute stereoconfigurations assigned using Mosher ester analysis and ECD spectroscopy. Four unprecedented bisazaphilones, named hybridorubrins A&#8722;D (  1  &#8722;  4  ), were elucidated, in addition to new fragirubrins F&#8722;G (  5  &#8722;  6  ) and various known mitorubrin derivatives. Only the hybridorubrins, which are composed of mitorubrin and fragirubrin moieties, exhibited strong inhibition of  Staphylococcus aureus  biofilm formation. Analysis of the genome of  H.&#160;fragiforme  revealed the presence of two separate biosynthetic gene clusters (BGC)  hfaza1  and  hfaza2  responsible for azaphilone formation. While the  hfaza1  BGC likely encodes the assembly of the backbone and addition of fatty acid moieties to yield the (  R  )&#8208;configured series of fragirubrins, the  hfaza2  BGC contains the necessary genes to synthesise the widely distributed (  S  )&#8208;mitorubrins. This study is the first example of two distant cross&#8208;acting fungal BGC collaborating to produce two families of azaphilones and bisazaphilones derived thereof.</dc:description>

      <title>Polyhydrido Copper Nanoclusters with a Hollow Icosahedral Core: [Cu30H18{E2P(OR)2}12] (E=S or Se; R=nPr, iPr or iBu)</title>
      <dc:description>
The structurally precise polyhydrido copper nanocluster (NC) [Cu30H18{S2P(OnPr)2}12] which contains an unprecedented inner hollow Cu12 icosahedral core has been fully characterized by single&#8208;crystal neutron diffraction; while Ag12 and Au12 inner hollow icosahedra encircled within Ag44 and Au32 NCs have been reported by Bigioni and Wang in 2013 and 2019, respectively. Pd doping on the Cu30 NC led to the isolation of Pd&#8722;Cu bimetallic NCs, which exhibit a linear [(PdH2)2&#8722;]&#8208;centered icosahedral core.

Gold catalysis promoted the domino reaction to form four bonds and two aromatic rings, dramatically increasing the structural complexity of the starting materials. This domino reaction pushed the switch of the diversity&#8208;directed total synthesis of six dictyodendrins, and accelerated the medicinal application study of dictyodendrin derivatives.

      <title>Esterification of Tertiary Amides: Remarkable Additive Effects of Potassium Alkoxides for Generating Hetero Manganese&#8211;Potassium Dinuclear Active Species</title>
      <dc:description>
A manganese&#8211;potassium heterodinuclear catalyst was found to exhibit higher catalytic activity than manganese dinuclear catalysts toward catalytic esterification of tertiary N,N&#8208;dialkyl aliphatic amides through C&#8722;N bond cleavage. Based on stoichiometric reactions, kinetic analysis, and DFT calculations, the reaction mechanism was elucidated, in which the potassium supported the manganese to construct an appropriate transition state for nucleophilic attack of an alkoxide to a carbonyl moiety of an amide.

      <title>High enzyme activity of a binuclear nickel complex formed with the binding loops of the NiSOD enzyme</title>
      <dc:description>Detailed equilibrium, spectroscopic and SOD activity studies are reported on a nickel complex formed with the new metallopeptide bearing two nickel binding loops of NiSOD. The metallopeptide exhibits unique nickel binding ability and the binuclear complex is a major species with 2x(NH 2 ,N amide ,S &#8211; ,S &#8211; ) donor set even in an equimolar solution of the metal ion and the ligand. Nickel(III) species were generated by oxidizing the Ni(II) complexes with KO 2 and the coordination modes were identified by EPR spectroscopy. The binuclear complex formed with the binding motifs exhibits superior SOD activity, in this respect it is an excellent model of the native NiSOD enzyme. A detailed kinetic model is postulated which incorporates spontaneous decomposition of the superoxide ion, the dismutation cycle and fast redox degradation of the binuclear complex. The latter process leads to the elimination of the SOD activity. A unique feature of this system is that the Ni(III) form of the catalyst rapidly accumulates in the dismutation cycle and simultaneously the Ni(II) form becomes a minor species.</dc:description>

      <title>Determination of configuration and conformation of a Reserpine derivative with seven stereogenic centers using molecular dynamics with RDC&#8208;derived tensorial constraints</title>
      <dc:description>NMR&#8208;based determination of the configuration of complex molecules containing many stereocenters is often not possible using traditional NOE data and coupling patterns. Making use of residual dipolar couplings (RDCs) we were able to determine the relative configuration of a natural product containing seven stereocenters including a chiral amine lacking direct RDC data. To identify the correct relative configuration out of 32 possible ones, experimental RDCs were used in three different approaches for data interpretation: by fitting experimental data based singular value decomposition (SVD) using a single alignment tensor and either (i) a single conformer or (ii) multiple conformers, or alternatively (iii) using molecular dynamics simulations with tensorial orientational constraints (MDOC). Even though in all three approaches one and the same configuration could be selected and clear discrimination between possible configurations was achieved, the experimental data was not fully satisfied by the methods based on single tensor approaches. While these two approaches are faster, only MDOC is able to fully reproduce experimental results, as the obtained conformational ensemble adequately covers the conformational space necessary to describe the molecule with inherent flexibility.</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;NMR&#8208;based determination of the configuration of complex molecules containing many stereocenters is often not possible using traditional NOE data and coupling patterns. Making use of residual dipolar couplings (RDCs) we were able to determine the relative configuration of a natural product containing seven stereocenters including a chiral amine lacking direct RDC data. To identify the correct relative configuration out of 32 possible ones, experimental RDCs were used in three different approaches for data interpretation: by fitting experimental data based singular value decomposition (SVD) using a single alignment tensor and either (i) a single conformer or (ii) multiple conformers, or alternatively (iii) using molecular dynamics simulations with tensorial orientational constraints (MDOC). Even though in all three approaches one and the same configuration could be selected and clear discrimination between possible configurations was achieved, the experimental data was not fully satisfied by the methods based on single tensor approaches. While these two approaches are faster, only MDOC is able to fully reproduce experimental results, as the obtained conformational ensemble adequately covers the conformational space necessary to describe the molecule with inherent flexibility.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>A Mechanistic Dichotomy in Two&#8208;Electron Reduction of Dioxygen Catalyzed by N,N&#8217;&#8208;Dimethylated Porphyrin Isomers</title>
      <dc:description>
Selective two&#8208;electron reduction of O2 to H2O2 has been achieved by nonplanar N,N&#8217;&#8208;dimethylated porphyrin isomers as organocatalysts, showing the highest TON among homogeneous metal&#8208;free catalysts. Hydrogen bonding between pyrrolic protons of reduced porphyrinoids and O2 plays an important role to control the reaction mechanism in catalytic O2 reduction. The cover art describes different mechanisms of the O2 reduction by the two isomers on the background showing shining Mt. Tsukuba in the sunset. More information can be found in the Full Paper by T. Kojima et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202000942).

      <title>Bimodal Therapeutic Agents against Glioblastoma, one of the most Lethal Cancer</title>
      <dc:description>About 95% of people diagnosed with glioblastoma die within five years. Glioblastoma is the most aggressive central nervous system tumour. It is necessary to make progress in the glioblastoma treatment so that advanced chemotherapy drugs or radiation therapy or, ideally, two&#8208;in&#8208;one hybrid systems should be implemented.

      <dc:description>The selection of suitable nanozymes with easy synthesis, tumor specificity, multifunction and high therapeutics is meaningful for tumor therapy.

No selenirane Ad  2  Se (  33  ) is formed from seleniranium salts, instead cleavage to the alkene (  1  ) and diselenide (  13  ,  15  ) occurs. The thiirenium salt [Ad  2  C  2  SCH  2  CH  2  SiMe  3  ]  +  Tf  2  N  &#8211;  (  35  ) does not yield the thiiren Ad  2  C  2  S (  37  ), the three&#8208;membered ring is cleaved, forming the alkyne (  3  ) and disulfide (  4  ). All compounds are characterized by ESI&#8208;mass spectra, NMR spectra, and by quantum chemical calculations. Crystal structures of the salts  8  ,  12  ,  25  ,  17  ,  26  ,  36  and the thiiranes  27  ,  30  are presented.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <dc:description>Triple&#8208;negative breast cancer (TNBC) is the most aggressive breast cancer subtype. In the last years, navitoclax has emerged as a possible treatment for TNBC. Nevertheless, rapid navitoclax resistance onset has been observed thorough Mcl&#8208;1 overexpression. As a strategy to overcome Mcl&#8208;1&#8208;mediated resistance, herein we present a controlled drug co&#8208;delivery system based on mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs) targeted to TNBC cells.

The apMUC1&#8208;capped nanoparticles effectively target TNBC cell lines and successfully induce apoptosis, overcoming navitoclax resistance. Moreover, navitoclax encapsulation protects platelets against apoptosis.

      <dc:description>A Ru&#8208;doping strategy is reported to substantially improve both hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalytic activity of Ni/Fe&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) for overall water splitting.

      <title>Aryl Triflates in On&#8208;Surface Chemistry</title>
      <dc:description>The reactivity of aryl triflates in on&#8208;surface C&#8208;C coupling is reported.

      <title>Desymmetrization of Perylenediimide Bay&#8208;Regions using selective Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura Reaction s from Dinitro Substituted derivatives</title>
      <dc:description>The bay&#8208;decoration of perylenediimide (PDI) is an attractive approach to tune the optoelectronic properties of the dye with the possibility to break its backbone planarity preventing the formation of aggregates. Usually performed through successive bis&#8208;bromination of PDI and pallado&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling, this approach classically leads to symmetric triads. We describe herein an efficient synthetic strategy for the desymmetrization of the accepting PDI core starting from its bis&#8208;nitration. In this respect, Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura Couplings (SMC) were carried out on a mixture of 1,6&#8208; and 1,7&#8208;dinitroPDI regioisomers to graft triphenylamine donating moieties and reach Donor&#8208;Acceptor&#8208;Donor triads. Investigating deeply the reactivity of dinitroPDI derivatives toward SMC allowed us to access unprecedented asymmetric p&#8208;conjugated PDI&#8208;centered triads accounting for the peculiar reactivity of dinitroPDI. &#160;Those 1,6&#8208; and 1,7&#8208;PDI based triads, prepared as regioisomeric mixture, were successfully separated and their spectroscopic, crystallographic and optoelectronic differences are reported.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>
A double oxidative coupling: The RhIII&#8208;catalyzed double oxidative coupling of free 1&#8208;naphthylamines and &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated esters were achieved, leading to the formation of a class of biologically important alkylidene&#8208;1,2&#8208;dihydrobenzo[cd]indoles scaffolds.







Abstract
The RhIII&#8208;catalyzed, consecutive double C&#8722;H oxidative coupling of free 1&#8208;naphthylamine and &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated esters through C&#8722;H/C&#8722;H and C&#8722;H/N&#8722;H bonds is reported. The one step reaction leads to the formation of biologically important alkylidene&#8208;1,2&#8208;dihydrobenzo[cd]indoles scaffolds. This efficient process is much more synthetically convenient and useful than others because the starting materials, such as 1&#8208;naphthylamine derivatives are readily available and the free amine serves as a directing group.
