         <title>Insights into Structural Diversity and Morphotropic Evolution in A4Th(WO4)4 (A = Li, Na, K, Rb and Cs) Family</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A series of four new thorium tungstates, A4Th(WO4)4 (A = Li, K, Rb, Cs), were synthesized using high&#8208;temperature solid&#8208;state method. Structural studies of the materials reveal distinct structural changes with underlying similarities influenced by the nature of A&#8208;site cations. Li4Th(WO4)4 exhibits a two&#8208;dimensional corrugated sheet structure stabilized by Li+ cations, crystallizing in P space group. K4Th(WO4)4 crystallizes in I41/a space group and exhibits a three&#8208;dimensional framework consisting of ThO8 antiprisms and WO4 tetrahedra. Rb4Th(WO4)4 forms in C2/c space group, showcasing a framework with two&#8208;dimensional sheet structure. Cs4Th(WO4)4 is isostructural to Rb4Th(WO4)4 but displays increased interlayer spacing due to the larger ionic radius of Cs. Raman spectroscopy confirms the structural data, revealing distinct vibrational modes that correlate with tungsten coordination changes from WO6 in Li4Th(WO4)4 to WO4 in the Cs4Th(WO4)4. This study demonstrates how variation of alkali metals affects the structural properties of thorium tungstates series, showing a morphotropic evolution as a factor of the ionic radii of the alkali metals.</dc:description>

         <title>Br&#248;nsted&#8208;Acid Catalyzed Diastereo&#8208; and Enantioselective Synthesis of Spiroisoindolinones from Enamides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A highly stereoselective Br&#248;nsted&#8208;acid catalyzed synthesis of densely substituted spiroisoindolinones from enamides and 3&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;isoindolinones is described. With simple Br&#248;nsted&#8208;acids, such as para&#8208;toluene sulfonic acid, spiroisoindolinones with three contiguous stereogenic centers are formed in high yields (up to 97%) and diastereoselectivities (up to &gt; 98:&lt;2:0:0 dr) under mild reaction conditions. With the use of a chiral phosphoric acid catalyst, a diastereo&#8208; and enantioselective synthesis of the corresponding spiroisoindolinones was achieved. Mechanistic investigations indicate a step&#8208;wise mechanism via an initial addition of the enamide to an electrophilic N&#8208;acylimine species followed by an intramolecular aza&#8208;Friedel&#8208;Crafts reaction. Addition of a strong Lewis acid can be used facilitate the second step for less reactive substrates.</dc:description>

         <title>Ni2+ in Distorted Octahedral Geometry toward High&#8208;Efficiency NIR&#8208;II/III emitter</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ni2+ activated phosphor has attracted wide attention because it can be radiated in near&#8208;infrared (NIR) II&#8208;III region; however, the low external quantum yield (EQY) hinders its further application (most are below 8%). In this work, distortion of crystallographic site strategy is proposed to enhance EQY. LaTiTaO6: 0.004Ni2+ exhibits an NIR emitting spectrum centered at 1450 nm with an EQY of ~ 9.00%, which has been the highest EQY of reported Ni2+ single&#8208;doped phosphor. Distortion degrees of the octahedral geometry in LaTiTaO6 and LaTiTaO6: 0.004Ni2+ changing from 0.038 to 0.047 result in the absorption efficiency of 38.6% due to the breaking of parity forbidden of the d&#8208;d transition, further improving the EQY. Besides, LaTiTaO6: 0.004Ni2+ mixed with LaTiTaO6: 0.04Cr3+ phosphors have demonstrated their application for spectral analysis. This work provides a new idea for constructing efficient NIR&#8208;II to NIR&#8208;III phosphors.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly Efficient Aggregation&#8208;induced Electrochemiluminescence Performance of Covalent Organic Frameworks with Electron&#8208;rich Conjugated Structures</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Since aggregation&#8208;induced electrochemiluminescence (AIECL) luminophore overcomes the restriction of aggregation&#8208;caused quenching in solid luminescent materials, AIECL luminophore has become a promising material in the field of electrochemiluminescence (ECL) engineering. However, the lack of ECL emitters with high AIECL performance limits its wide application. Herein, imine&#8208;linked covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with C4 symmetrical tetraphenyl ethylene and C2 symmetrical five&#8208;membered heteroaromatic monomers are designed as ECL emitter in aqueous media. Significantly, the ECL intensity of COFs with terthienyl units (TTA&#8208;TAPE) is 206 times that of COFs with furan units in the presence of tri&#8208;n&#8208;propylamine (TPrA), which is the result of enhancing ECL signals by increasing the thiophene units and &#960;&#8208;&#960; conjugation of COFs. Furthermore, the ECL mechanism of these COFs is vested in the bandgap model. Thus, the study provides a strategy for designing highly efficient ECL&#8208;active COFs emitters with excellent AIECL efficiency.</dc:description>

         <title>Activation of CO2, CS2, and COS by &#945;&#8208;Diimine&#8208;Stabilized Gallylenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
New &#945;&#8208;diimine&#8208;ligated gallylenes [LGa:]&#8722; were synthesized, which react with CO2, CS2, and COS via diverse pathways. 1) Reductive disproportionation of CO2 gives carbonate and oxo&#8208;carbonate complexes; 2) Reductive coupling of CS2 affords ethenetetrathiolate [C2S4]4&#8722; complexes; 3) Reductive disproportionation of COS yields a disulfide&#8208;bridged complex or a dithiocarbonate (S2CO)2&#8722; complex.







Abstract
Several gallylenes [LPhGaM(THF)n] stabilized by an &#945;&#8208;diimine ligand (LPh=[(2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3)NC(Ph)]22&#8722;; M=Li, n=3, 3&#8208;Li; M=Na, n=4, 3&#8208;Na; M=K, n=1, 3&#8208;K) were prepared, which display diverse reactivities toward carbon dioxide and its sulfurized analogues. The reaction of 3 with CO2 yielded a trimeric carbonate complex [{LPhGa(CO3)2}3{&#956;&#8208;K9(THF)6}] (4) and a dinuclear oxo&#8208;carbonate complex [K2(THF)6][LPhGa(&#956;&#8208;CO3)(&#956;&#8208;O)GaLPh] (5) in one pot through reductive disproportionation of CO2. For CS2, two ethenetetrathiolate gallium complexes, [M2(Solv)4][LPhGa(&#956;&#8208;C2S4)GaLPh] (M=Na, Solv=THF, 6; M=K, Solv=DME, 7), were obtained via reductive coupling of CS2. In the case of COS, disproportionation gave a disulfide&#8208;bridged complex [K2(THF)6] [LPhGa(&#956;&#8208;S)2GaLPh] (8) at room temperature, but a dithiocarbonate [Na2(THF)5][LPhGa(S2CO)]2 (9) at low temperature, the latter being the first example of dithiocarbonates of p&#8208;block elements.

         <title>Expanding the Toolset of Biomolecular NMR with Efficient and Cost&#8208;Effective 17O&#8208;Labeling via Bacterial Expression</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Oxygen plays a central role in biomolecular structures and functions, with&#160;17O NMR emerging as a powerful tool for elucidating biomolecular properties. However, the low natural abundance of the NMR&#8208;active isotope,&#160;17O (0.0373%), presents a significant hurdle to its widespread application. Here, we introduce a rapid and cost&#8208;effective approach for amino acid&#8208;specific&#160;17O&#8208;labeling of recombinant proteins. Using a common bacterial expression system and with a 30&#8208;minute rapid synthesis protocol of&#160;17O&#8208;labeled amino acids via mechanochemical saponification,&#160;we have generated Leu&#8208; and Phe&#8208;specific&#160;17O&#8208;labeled recombinant proteins derived from diverse organisms, including CrgA and FtsQ from&#160;Mycobacterium tuberculosis&#160;and E protein from SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 virus, demonstrating the applicability of our technique for amino acids known to be isotopically labeled without scrambling. We have acquired magic&#8208;angle&#8208;spinning&#160;17O NMR of these proteins to confirm the successful&#160;17O labeling and illustrate the sensitivity of&#160;17O NMR to the protein&#8217;s local structural environments. Our work significantly broadens the accessibility of&#160;17O&#8208;NMR, empowering researchers to delve deeper into protein biophysics and biochemistry. This approach opens new avenues for understanding cellular processes at the molecular level by providing an effective tool for investigating oxygen&#8208;related interactions and chemistry within biomolecules.</dc:description>

         <title>Harnessing cyanine&#8208;like properties to develop bright fluorogenic probes based on viscosity&#8208;sensitive molecular rotors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dipolar fluorescent molecular rotors (FMRs) are environmentally&#8208;sensitive fluorophores that can be used in bioimaging applications to sense local viscosity and polarity. Their sensitivity to viscosity can also be used for the fluorogenic labeling of biomolecules such as DNA or proteins. In particular, we have previously used FMRs to develop a series of tunable fluorogens targeting the self&#8208;labeling protein tag Halotag for wash&#8208;free protein imaging in live cells. Despite these very useful properties, FMRs typically display moderate molar absorption coefficients that limits their overall fluorescence brightness. Herein, we synthesized a series of three model hemicyanines based on a styrylindolenium scaffold and performed a detailed study of their photophysical properties in solvents with various polarity and viscosity. We show that with a strong julolidine electron&#8208;donating group it is possible to combine intense cyanine&#8208;like absorption with the high sensitivity to viscosity of FMRs. We use this property to develop a lysosomal pH sensor and two bright cell&#8208;impermeant fluorogens targeting HaloTag for imaging membrane proteins. We believe that this bright fluorogenic scaffold based on a simple chemical structure can be used in the future to build up a variety of probes and sensors with efficient photophysical properties.</dc:description>

         <title>Photogeneration and Direct Observation of a 2H&#8208;Phosphirene and a Closed&#8208;Shell Singlet Arylphosphenium Ion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Phosphenium ions are highly reactive species with the formula of RR`P+. Although phosphenium ions were proposed as the invaluable intermediates of various important chemical processes, the methods to generate and characterize them were very limited. In this study, a novel photoprecursor to give rise to the arylphosphenium ions, 1&#8208;(naphthalen&#8208;2&#8208;yl)phosphirane, was synthesized and investigated by femtosecond to nanosecond transient absorption spectroscopies, photoproduct analysis, and density functional theory calculations. Subsequent to photoexcitation, the S1&#160;state of the photoprecursor of interest is populated from the higher excited states, accompanied by the generation of an unexpected 2H&#8208;phosphirene, 7bH&#8208;naphtho[1,2&#8208;b]phosphirene. After that, the resulted 2H&#8208;phosphirene is protonated by H2O in the solvent to generate the naphthalen&#8208;2&#8208;yl(hydryl)phosphenium ion, which can be attacked by H2O and oxidized by O2&#160;to give naphthalen&#8208;2&#8208;ylphosphinic acid as the major final product. The presence of these transient species is confirmed by density functional theory calculation and control experiments with different solvents. This study provides an understanding of the reactivity of arylphosphenium ions as well as 2H&#8208;phosphirenes, and provides a novel method to generate and characterize these reactive species, which may help to further reveal their reactivity and explore their chemistry and use in a range of applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Mo&#8211;O&#8211;Sn Bond Boosting Kinetics of MoO2&#8722;xSnO2/Sn Anode for High&#8208;Performance Li&#8208;ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Obtaining a robust electrode composed of Sn&#8208;based metal oxides and carbonaceous matrix through nanoscale structure engineering is essential for effectively improving Li&#8208;ion batteries' electrochemical performance and stability. Herein, we report a bimetallic MoO2&#8208;xSnO2/Sn nanoparticles uniformly anchored on N, S co&#8208;doped graphene nanosheets (MoO2&#8208;xSnO2/Sn@NSG) as an anode electrode for Li&#8208;ion battery via a one&#8208;step hydrothermal and thermal treatment approach. In the MoO2&#8208;xSnO2/Sn nanocomposite, the generated Sn&#8208;O&#8208;Mo bond can modulate the electronic and composition structures to improve the intrinsic conductivity of SnO2 and reinforce the structural stability during cycles. Moreover, featuring excellent electronic conductivity via coupling of MoO2&#8208;xSnO2/Sn and hierarchical NBG matrix, the MoO2&#8208;xSnO2/Sn@NSG electrode possesses ultrafast electrochemical kinetics and superior long&#8208;term cycling stability and rate capability. Additionally, the hierarchical MoO2&#8208;2SnO2/Sn@NSG can suppress the aggregation and accommodate the volume variations of active substances, thereby providing more lithium storage sites. Consequently, the optimized MoO2&#8208;2SnO2/Sn@NSG anode exhibits a high reversible capacity of 904 mA h g&#8208;1 at 0.2 A g&#8208;1 and excellent cycling performance with the reversible capacity of 456 mAh g&#8208;1 at 1 A g&#8208;1 over 600 cycles. The universal synthesis technology of bimetallic oxide anodes for advanced LIBs may provide vital guidance in designing high&#8208;performance energy&#8208;storage materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Apoptosis&#8208;Inducing Activity of a 2&#8208;Hydroxyphenyl Benzamide&#8208;Based Self&#8208;Assembled Anion Channel</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Despite the significant interest in designing artificial ion channels, there is limited availability of channel&#8208;forming molecules to tackle complex issues, especially in biological systems. Moreover, a major challenge is the scarcity of chloride transporters that can selectively induce toxicity in cancer cells while minimizing harm to normal healthy cells. This work reports a series of 2&#8208;hydroxyphenyl benzamide&#8208;based small molecules 1a&#8722;1c, which self&#8208;assemble to form barrel rosette&#8208;type artificial ion channels that selectively transport chloride ions across membranes. The formation of these ion channels primarily relies on intermolecular hydrogen bonding and &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking interactions, as supported by the analysis of single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Importantly, chloride ion transport by these compounds specifically triggers apoptosis in cancer cells while demonstrating relatively low toxicity toward non&#8208;cancerous cell lines.</dc:description>

         <title>Unraveling mechanism and enhancing selectivity of a RuII&#8208;bis&#8208;bipyridyl&#8208;morphocumin complex with RAFT&#8208;generated glycopolymer exploiting Warburg effect in cancer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Warburg effect, generates increased demand of glucose in cancer but&#160;is relatively underexplored phenomenon in existing commercial anti&#8208;cancer drugs. Here, we present a&#160;Ru(II)&#8208;bis&#8208;bipyridyl&#8208;morphocumin complex (2) encapsulated in a self&#8208;assembling glucose&#8208;functionalized co&#8208;polymer P(G&#8208;EMA&#8208;co&#8208;MMA) (where G = glucose; MMA = methyl methacrylate; EMA = ethyl methacrylate), designed to exploit Warburg effect and enhance cancer selectivity. The P(G&#8208;EMA&#8208;co&#8208;MMA) polymer, synthesized via reversible&#8208;addition fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization, has a number average molecular weight (Mn, NMR) of 8000 g/mol. Complex 2, stable in aqueous media, selectively releases a cytotoxic, lysosome&#8208;targeting compound morphocumin in the presence of excess&#160;H2O2, a reactive oxygen species (ROS) prevalent in tumor microenvironments. Complex 2 promotes ROS accumulation enhancing morphocumin release through a synergistic domino effect. Comparatively,&#160;2 outperforms its curcumin Ru(II) complex (1) in solution stability, organelle specificity, and cellular mechanisms. Both 1 and 2 exhibit phototherapeutic effects under low&#8208;intensity visible light, but their dark toxicity surpasses their photoactivity, highlighting they are&#160;superior as chemotherapeutic agents. Complex 2 induces apoptosis via mitochondrial pathway with 9&#8208;fold increase in selectivity for pancreatic cancer cells (MIA PaCa&#8208;2) over non&#8208;cancerous HEK293 cells when delivered encapsulated in&#160;glucose&#8208;conjugated polymer (DP@2)activity&#160;enhance further&#160;5&#8208;fold by glucose deprivation underscoring their potential in targeted cancer therapy.</dc:description>

         <title>Quantum&#8208;Classical Simulations Reveal the Photoisomerization Mechanism of a Prototypical First&#8208;Generation Molecular Motor</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Light&#8208;driven molecular rotary motors convert the energy of absorbed light into unidirectional rotational motion and are key components in the design of molecular machines. The archetypal class of light&#8208;driven rotary motors is chiral overcrowded alkenes, where the rotational movement is achieved through consecutive cis&#8208;trans photoisomerization reactions and thermal helix inversion steps. While the thermal steps have been rather well understood by now, our understanding of the photoisomerization reactions of overcrowded alkene&#8208;based motors still misses key points that would explain the striking differences in operation efficiency of the known systems. Here, we employ quantum&#8208;chemical calculations and nonadiabatic molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the excited&#8208;state decay and photoisomerization mechanism in a prototypical alkene&#8208;based first&#8208;generation rotary motor. We show that the initially excited bright state undergoes an ultrafast relaxation to multiple excited&#8208; state minima separated by low energy barriers and reveal a slow picosecond&#8208;timescale decay to the ground state, which only occurs from a largely twisted dark excited&#8208;state minimum, far from any conical&#8208;intersection point. Additionally, we attribute the origin of the high yields of forward photoisomerization in our investigated motor to the favorable topography of the ground&#8208;state potential energy surface, which is controlled by the conformation of the central cyclopentene rings.</dc:description>

         <title>High&#8208;resolution Molecular Dynamics Simulations of the Pyruvate Kinase Muscle Isoform 1 and 2 (PKM1/2).</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Glucose metabolism plays a pivotal role in physiological processes and cancer growth. The final stage of glycolysis, converting phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) into pyruvate, is catalyzed by the pyruvate kinase (PK) enzyme. Whereas PKM1 is mainly expressed in cells with high energy requirements, PKM2 is preferentially expressed in proliferating cells, including tumor cells. Structural analysis of PKM1 and PKM2 is essential to design new molecules with antitumoral activity. To understand their structural dynamics, we performed extensive high&#8208;resolution molecular dynamics (MD) simulations using adaptive sampling techniques coupled to the polarizable AMOEBA force field. Performing more than 6 &#181;s of simulation, we considered all oligomerization states of PKM2 and propose structural insights for PKM1 to further study the PKM2&#8208;specific allostery. We focused on key sites including the active site and the natural substrate Fructose Bi&#8208;Phosphate (FBP) fixation pocket. Additionally, we present the first MD simulation of biologically active PKM1 and uncover important similarities with its PKM2 counterpart \textcolor{red}{bound} to FBP. We also analysed TEPP&#8208;46&#8217;s fixation, a pharmacological activator binding a different pocket, on PKM2 and highlighted the structural differences and similarities compared to PKM2 bound to FBP. Finally, we determined potential new cryptic pockets specific to PKM2 for drug targeting.</dc:description>

         <title>Partially Sulfated Pillar[5]arenes: Synthesis and Molecular Recognition Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report the synthesis and characterization of sulfated pillar[5]arene hosts (P5S2 &#8211; P5S10) that differ in the number of sulfate substituents. All five P5Sn hosts display high solubility in water (73 &#8211; 131 mM) and do not undergo significant self&#8208;association according to 1H NMR dilution experiments. The x&#8208;ray crystal structures of P5S6, P5S6&#8226;Me6HDA, P5S8&#8226;Me6HDA, and P5S10&#8226;Me6HDA reveal one intracavity molecule of Me6HDA and several external molecules of Me6HDA which form a network of close methonium&#8226;&#8226;&#8226;sulfate interactions. The thermodynamic parameters of complexation between P5Sn and the panel of guests was measured by direct or competitive isothermal titration calorimetry. We find that the binding free energy toward a guest becomes more negative as the number of sulfate substituents increase. Conversely, the binding free energy of a specific sulfated pillar[5]arene toward a homologous series of guests becomes more negative as the number of NMe groups increases. The ability to tune the host&#8226;guest affinity by changing the number of sulfate substituents will be valuable in supramolecular polymers, separation materials, and latching applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Mechanistical Study on Substrate&#8208;Controlled Highly Selective [2+2] and [2+3] Cycloaddition Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polycyclic conjugated hydrocarbons have acquired increased interests recently because of their potential applications in electronic devices. On metal surfaces, the selective synthesis of four&#8208; and five&#8208;membered carbon rings remains challenging due to the presence of diverse reaction pathways. Here, utilizing the same precursor molecule, we successfully achieved substrate&#8208;controlled highly selective cycloaddition reactions towards four&#8208; and five&#8208;membered carbon rings. A 97% yield for four&#8208;membered carbon rings on Au(111), while a 96% yield towards five&#8208;membered carbon rings is achieved on Ag(111). The detailed topological structures of the reaction products are carefully examined by bond&#8208;resolving scanning tunneling microscopy (BR&#8208;STM) imaging with a CO functionalized tip. The underlying mechanism of the novel surface&#8208;directed reaction selectivity is elucidated by extensive density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Our study paves the way for high selective synthesis of polycyclic conjugated hydrocarbons with non&#8208;benzenoid rings.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Herein, we describe a stereoselective Ni&#8208;catalyzed N&#8208;glycosylation of glycals. The reaction is enabled by addition of an in situ generated nickel hydride across an olefin prior to C&#8211;N bond&#8208;formation. Stereodivergence can be accomplished on kinetic or thermodynamic grounds, thus giving access to either &#945;&#8208; or &#946;&#8208;N&#8208;glycosides with equal ease. The protocol is distinguished by its operational simplicity, generality and exquisite selectivity, thus offering a new gateway to expedite the synthesis of N&#8208;glycosides.</dc:description>

         <title>Role of Secondary Structure and Time&#8208;Dependent Binding on&#160;Disruption of Phthalocyanine Aggregates by Guanine&#8208;rich Nucleic Acids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Phthalocyanines are versatile photodynamic therapy agents whose biological activity depends on their aggregation state, which is expected to be influenced by binding to biomolecules. Here, guanine&#8208;rich nucleic acid binding of a water&#8208;soluble cationic, regiopure C4h zinc phthalocyanine bearing four triethylene glycol methyl ether and four N&#8208;methyl&#8208;4&#8208;pyridinium substituents (1) is reported. In contrast to double&#8208;stranded DNA, guanine systems GpG, (GG)10, poly(G) and quadruplex DNA are shown to effectively disrupt phthalocyanine aggregates in buffered solution. This process is accompanied by evolution of the Q&#8208;band absorbance and enhanced emission. Increasing the sequence length from GpG to (GG)10 increases the binding and confirms the importance of multiple binding interactions. Enhanced binding in the presence of KCl suggests the importance of nucleobase hydrogen&#8208;bonded mosaics in phthalocyanine binding. Notably, the (GT)10 sequence is even more effective than quadruplex and pure guanine systems at disrupting the aggregates of 1. Significant time&#8208;dependent binding of 1 with poly(G) reveals biexponential binding over minutes and hours, which is linked to local conformations of poly(G) that accommodate monomers of 1 over time. The study highlights the ability of biomacromolecules to disrupt phthalocyanines aggregates over time, which is an important consideration when rationalizing photoactivity of photosensitizers in&#8208;vivo.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Kagome lattices have attracted much attention due the very interesting properties they can exhibit, both from the electronic and the magnetic points of view, although much of the experimental studies have been reported on 3D metals or 2D nanosheets. In the past few years, on&#8208;surface synthesis has allowed the fabrication of strictly monolayer 2D metal&#8208;organic networks, many of them containing transition metals. In this paper we report the fabrication and the study of the electronic and magnetic properties of a monolayer 2D metal&#8208;organic network where the nodes are lanthanide atoms forming a kagome lattice.</dc:description>

By liquid&#8208;crystallization&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly (LCDSA) of copolymers consisting of star&#8208;like PAMAM and chain termini of liquid crystalline Azo units (PAMAM&#8208;Azo6), uniform multi&#8208;morphology fried&#8208;egg&#8208;like micelles containing an inner spherical/bowl&#8208;like core and platelet&#8208;like structure protruded for the core can be generated. It is found that the aggregation rate of PAMAM&#8208;Azo6 is one of the most important factors determining LCDSA behavior and morphology of formed micelles.







Abstract
Liquid&#8208;crystallization&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly (LCDSA) has recently emerged as an efficient strategy to create uniform one&#8208;dimensional (1&#8208;D), 2&#8208;D and 3&#8208;D nanostructures in a controlled manner. However, the examples of generation of uniform multi&#8208;morphology nanostructures from solution self&#8208;assembly of one single polymer sample are rare. Herein, we report the first example of preparation of multi&#8208;morphology fried&#8208;egg&#8208;like nanostructures consisting of an inner spherical/bowl&#8208;like core of uniform size and platelets protruded from the core by LCDSA of PAMAM&#8208;Azo6 (PAMAM=polyamidoamine, Azo=azobenzene) in methanol. It is disclosed that the different aggregation rates for PAMAM&#8208;Azo6 with varying contents of Azo units spontaneously separated nucleation and growth stages, which led to the formation of inner spherical/bowl&#8208;like cores (&#8220;seeds&#8221;) firstly, followed by the formation of platelets protruded from the edges of inner core to give &#8220;imperfect&#8221; fried&#8208;egg&#8208;like nanostructures. Additional annealing of initially formed &#8220;imperfect&#8221; fried&#8208;egg&#8208;like micelles will promote the rearrangement of Azo units to give thermodynamically&#8208;favored &#8220;perfect&#8221; fried&#8208;egg&#8208;shaped micelles with a uniform dimension both in the core and whole structure. This work not only provides an efficient strategy to create uniform multi&#8208;morphology fried&#8208;egg&#8208;shaped nanostructures, but also reveals the essential impact of aggregation kinetics of liquid&#8208;crystalline&#8208;coil BCPs in the formation of multi&#8208;morphology nanostructures.

         <title>Deep&#8208;Ultraviolet Transparent Nonlinear Optical Phosphates: A New Alternative to Conventional Borates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Old Tree Blossoms Anew: The recent discovery of Mg2PO4Cl, which demonstrates a remarkable SHG response (5.2&#215;KDP), has reignited interest in non&#8208;&#960;&#8208;conjugated deep ultraviolet (DUV) transparent nonlinear optical (NLO) phosphates. This review provides a comprehensive summary of the latest advancements in DUV&#8208;transparent NLO phosphates and offers valuable insights into potential future directions for research in this field.







Abstract
Deep ultraviolet (DUV) nonlinear optical (NLO) crystals with balanced performance are crucial for extending laser wavelengths into the DUV region, essential for various laser applications. However, developing ideal DUV crystals is challenging due to stringent requirements: strong second&#8208;harmonic generation (SHG) response, short cut&#8208;off wavelength, and effective phase&#8208;matching behavior. DUV NLO borates, which feature &#960;&#8208;conjugated groups, have garnered attention for their higher SHG coefficients compared to phosphates. However, phosphates typically show short UV cut&#8208;off edges due to the large HOMO&#8208;LUMO gap (approximately 9.6&#8197;eV) of the [PO&#8324;] units. To enhance the SHG effect while maintaining DUV transparency in phosphates, several strategies have been proposed: 1) using distorted polymerized P&#8722;O groups like isolated C&#8321;&#8208;[P&#8323;O&#8321;&#8320;]&#8309;&#8722; and [P&#8322;O&#8327;]&#8308;&#8722;; 2) aligning isolated [PO&#8324;]3&#8722; tetrahedra along the polar screw axis; 3) introducing additional NLO&#8208;active units; and 4) exploring new units derived from [PO&#8324;]3&#8722;, such as [PO&#8323;F]2&#8722; tetrahedra. These strategies have led to the successful development of various non&#8208;centrosymmetric phosphates, highlighting their potential as DUV NLO candidates. This review explores the relationship between their crystal structures and DUV NLO performance, and proposes future directions for developing ideal DUV NLO materials.

         <title>The Emissive and Electrochemical Properties of Hypervalent Pyridine&#8208;Dipyrrolide Bismuth Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report on hypervalent bismuth complexes, featuring ligands with the pyridine&#8208;2,6&#8208;bis(pyrrolide) motif. These complexes exhibit HOMO&#8594;LUMO transitions with ligand&#8208;to&#8208;metal&#8208;charge transfer (LMCT) and interligand charge transfer (LL'CT) characteristics, as revealed by TD&#8208;DFT calculations. At 77&#8197;K, the complexes display red phosphorescence. Electrochemical and structural analyses demonstrate the influence of substituents on the electronic properties and the Lewis acidity of the Bi3+ ion.







Abstract
We present a series of six hypervalent bismuth complexes Bi(R1PDPR2)X bearing ligands characterized by the pyridine&#8208;2,6&#8208;bis(pyrrolide) (PDP) structural motif. While bismuth holds considerable potential for facilitating efficient intersystem crossing (ISC), reports on phosphorescent molecular bismuth complexes are still scarce and mostly based on systems that exhibit inter&#8208; or intraligand charge transfer character of their optical excitations. Herein, the UV/vis absorptive, luminescent, and electrochemical properties of complexes Bi(R1PDPR2)X are explored, where the substituents R1 and R2, as well as the halide ligand X are varied. These compounds are characterized by an intense HOMO&#8594;LUMO transition of mixed ligand&#8208;to&#8208;metal charge transfer (LMCT) and interligand charge transfer (LL'CT) character, as shown by time&#8208;dependent density functional theory (TD&#8208;DFT) calculations. At 77&#8197;K in a 2&#8208;MeTHF matrix, these compounds exhibit red, long&#8208;lived phosphorescence with lifetimes ranging from 479 to 14&#8197;&#956;s. Cyclic voltammetry measurements and TD&#8208;DFT calculations show that the substituents influence HOMO and LUMO energies to almost equal extent, resulting in nearly constant emission wavelengths throughout this series. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction studies of four of the six complexes exemplify the inherent Lewis acidity of the coordinated Bi3+ ion, in spite of its hypervalency.

While bismuth holds considerable potential for facilitating efficient intersystem crossing (ISC), reports on phosphorescent molecular bismuth complexes are still scarce and mostly based on systems that exhibit inter- or intraligand charge transfer character of their optical excitations. Herein, the UV/vis absorptive, luminescent, and electrochemical properties of complexes &lt;b&gt;Bi(&lt;sup&gt;R1&lt;/sup&gt;PDP&lt;sup&gt;R2&lt;/sup&gt;)X&lt;/b&gt; are explored, where the substituents R&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, as well as the halide ligand X are varied. These compounds are characterized by an intense HOMO&#8594;LUMO transition of mixed ligand-to-metal charge transfer (LMCT) and interligand charge transfer (LL'CT) character, as shown by time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) calculations. At 77&#8197;K in a 2-MeTHF matrix, these compounds exhibit red, long-lived phosphorescence with lifetimes ranging from 479 to 14&#8197;&#956;s. Cyclic voltammetry measurements and TD-DFT calculations show that the substituents influence HOMO and LUMO energies to almost equal extent, resulting in nearly constant emission wavelengths throughout this series. Single-crystal X-ray diffraction studies of four of the six complexes exemplify the inherent Lewis acidity of the coordinated Bi&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; ion, in spite of its hypervalency.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Two novel star&#8208;shaped fluorophores named PDI&#8722;S and PDI&#8722;Se are constructed by S/Se&#8208;fused perylene diimides (PDIs) connected with bicarbazole core. Particularly, PDI&#8722;S presents excellent two&#8208;photon absorption cross&#8208;action (&#948;TPA) of 3775&#8197;GM excited with 800&#8197;nm light, which is the highest value based on PDIs motif in the NIR&#8722;I region (700&#8211;900&#8197;nm).







Abstract
Two&#8208;photon absorption (TPA) has attracted growing attention over recent years owing to the wide range of applications in organic nonlinear optical (NLO) materials. The quantitative sensitivity of a two&#8208;photon molecular entity is determined by its TPA cross&#8208;section (&#948;TPA). Perylene diimides (PDIs) are excellent n&#8208;type organic semiconductor materials demonstrating distinguished thermal, optical, and chemical stability. Nonetheless, PDIs&#8208;based scaffolds exhibit poor &#948;TPA in the NIR&#8722;I region (700&#8211;900&#8197;nm) due to the lack of suitable molecular design. Here, two novel star&#8208;shaped PDIs fluorophores, namely PDI&#8722;S and PDI&#8722;Se, were constructed by four periphery S/Se&#8208;fused PDIs connected with bicarbazole core. PDI&#8722;S manifested excellent &#948;TPA of 3775&#8197;GM, which are among the highest values reported for PDIs excited in the NIR&#8722;I region.

         <title>Study on Intelligent Bionic Superhydrophobic Material and its Oil&#8208;Water Separation Mechanism</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel Fe3O4@SiO2@PMMA&#8208;based smart bionic superhydrophobic material demonstrates efficient oil&#8208;water separation performance. With outstanding durability, chemical stability, and high separation efficiency for oil&#8208;water mixtures and emulsions, this material achieves a separation efficiency of up to 99.85&#8201;% and enables precise oil absorption under magnetic control, showcasing broad application prospects in ecological pollution management and oil spill remediation.







Abstract
Marine oil spills and improper disposal of daily oil usage have posed significant threat to ecological environments and human health due to rapid industrial development. In this study, an environmentally friendly, simple process and high&#8208;performance Fe3O4@SiO2@Polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA)&#8208;based smart bionic superhydrophobic oil&#8208;absorbing material was developed for effectively collecting and removing oil pollutants from water. By studying the effects of Fe3O4 particle size, polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) concentration, and heating time on the superhydrophobicity of the materials, the directional regulation of superhydrophobicity and oil&#8208;water separation performance of Fe3O4@SiO2@PMMA@PDMS materials was realized. The results showed that the material exhibited optimal performance when the Fe3O4 particle size combination was 20/500&#8197;nm/1&#8197;&#956;m, the mass ratio of PDMS to Fe3O4@SiO2@PMMA was 7&#8201;:&#8201;1, and it was heated at 350&#176;C for 1&#8197;minute. The coating achieved an apparent contact angle (APCA) of 158.7&#176; and a rolling angle as low as 4.9&#176;. This coating not only remained superhydrophobic after a 21&#8197;m abrasion test and 288&#8197;h immersion in acid, alkali, salt, and high&#8208;temperature solutions, but also efficiently separated oil&#8208;water mixtures and water&#8208;in&#8208;oil emulsions, and the separation efficiency for oil&#8208;water mixtures of trichloromethane, dichloromethane and bromomethane was over 99.78&#8201;%, and that for water&#8208;in&#8208;oil emulsions was over 98.34&#8201;%. Furthermore, the superhydrophobic magnetic polyurethane (SFPU) sponge prepared using Fe3O4@SiO2@PMMA not only exhibited excellent oil&#8208;absorbing capacity (11&#8211;28&#8197;g/g), but also realized precise oil absorption at multiple sites by magnetic conduction. In the actual oily wastewater test, the oil&#8208;water separation efficiency of the sponge reached 90.58&#8201;% and the oil absorption capacity reached 17.03&#8197;g/g. This efficient oil&#8208;water separation performance as well as oil adsorption capacity comes from the fact that the nonpolar molecules (e.&#8201;g., &#8722;CH3) generated by the hydrolysis of PDMS can produce van der Waals adsorption with oil substances, while the excellent micro&#8208;nanostructure of the coating surface greatly increases the contact area between oil droplets and the coating, which can make them adsorb or pass through quickly. This multifunctional coating and sponge had immense application potential in fields like offshore oil spill treatment, organic pollution control in water bodies.

         <title>Pd&#8208;Catalyzed Site&#8208;Selective Defluorinative Etherification Between Unactivated Perfluoroarenes and Hydrobenzoxazoles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using hydrobenzoxazoles as the surrogate of phenol, the first Pd(0) catalyzed synthesis of polyfluoaryl ethers motifs through selective C&#8722;F bond activation and C&#8722;O bond cleavage was described. This transformation proceeded under mild conditions, and exhibited broad substrate scope and ability for post&#8208;functionalization of natural products. DFT investigations suggested that oxidative addition step through C&#8722;F bond cleavage constitutes the rate&#8208;determining step.







Abstract
Polyfluoroaryl ethers represent an important framework of biologically active molecules and materials. Owing to the strong bond dissociation energy of C&#8722;F bond, selectivity and other issues, transition metal&#8208;catalyzed synthesis of polyfluoroaryl ethers from perfluoroarenes via the activation of C&#8722;F bond is challenging and underdeveloped, as compared to the well&#8208;documented C&#8722;O bond formation starting from aryl iodides, aryl bromides or aryl chlorides. Herein, an unprecedented Pd&#8208;catalyzed defluorinative etherification for the synthesis of polyfluoroaryl ether skeletons using hydrobenzoxazoles as phenol surrogate, has been reported. The substrate scope for this protocol is broad, with respect to hydrobenzoxazoles and perfluoroarenes, under mild reaction conditions. More importantly, challenging alkenyl and alkynyl substituted polyfluoroarenes could be successfully used as the cou&#8208;pling component for Pd&#8208;catalyzed etherification reaction. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were employed to investigate the reaction mechanism, which suggested that oxidative addition between polyfluorobenzene and Pd(0) constituted the rate&#8208;determining step.

         <title>CoFe2O4 with the In&#8208;Situ Formed Oxygen Vacancies and Co Particles as an Efficient Bifunctional Catalyst for Rechargeable Zinc&#8208;Air Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient bifunctional catalyst rGO&#8208;CoFe2O4/Co is synthesized by a simple hydrothermal reaction and one&#8208;step annealing process using cobalt nitrate and ferric nitrate as raw materials. The in&#8208;situ formed cobalt particles and oxygen vacancies optimize the adsorption energy of the catalyst for H2O and O2 molecules and contribute to the enhanced catalytic activity.







Abstract
Rechargeable zinc&#8208;air batteries (RZABs) are considered as one of the most promising clean energy device due to their abundant resources, low cost and environmental friendliness. However, their energy efficiency and cycle life are far from satisfactory due to the poor activity and stability of bi&#8208;functional electrocatalyst in air cathode. In this work, an efficient bi&#8208;functional catalyst (rGO&#8208;CoFe2O4/Co) was derived from its precursor (rGO&#8208;CoFe2O4) through a simple annealing process. Electrochemical measurements prove that rGO&#8208;CoFe2O4/Co with the in&#8208;situ formed Co nano particles and rich oxygen vacancies appears excellent oxygen reduction reaction and oxygen evolution reaction catalytic activity compared to its counterpart. Its half&#8208;wave potential is 0.81&#8197;V (vs RHE) and the OER overpotential is only 310&#8197;mV (vs RHE). In addition, rechargeable zinc&#8208;air batteries assembled with rGO&#8208;CoFe2O4/Co show the highest peak power density (128.9&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2) and cycling stability compared to rGO&#8208;CoFe2O4 and commercial Pt/C&#8208;RuO2 catalysts. This work provides a simple strategy for the design of advanced bifunctional catalysts.

&lt;p&gt;An efficient bifunctional catalyst rGO-CoFe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;/Co is synthesized by a simple hydrothermal reaction and one-step annealing process using cobalt nitrate and ferric nitrate as raw materials. The in-situ formed cobalt particles and oxygen vacancies optimize the adsorption energy of the catalyst for H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O and O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; molecules and contribute to the enhanced catalytic activity.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rechargeable zinc-air batteries (RZABs) are considered as one of the most promising clean energy device due to their abundant resources, low cost and environmental friendliness. However, their energy efficiency and cycle life are far from satisfactory due to the poor activity and stability of bi-functional electrocatalyst in air cathode. In this work, an efficient bi-functional catalyst (rGO-CoFe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;/Co) was derived from its precursor (rGO-CoFe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) through a simple annealing process. Electrochemical measurements prove that rGO-CoFe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;/Co with the in-situ formed Co nano particles and rich oxygen vacancies appears excellent oxygen reduction reaction and oxygen evolution reaction catalytic activity compared to its counterpart. Its half-wave potential is 0.81&#8197;V (vs RHE) and the OER overpotential is only 310&#8197;mV (vs RHE). In addition, rechargeable zinc-air batteries assembled with rGO-CoFe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;/Co show the highest peak power density (128.9&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;) and cycling stability compared to rGO-CoFe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and commercial Pt/C-RuO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; catalysts. This work provides a simple strategy for the design of advanced bifunctional catalysts.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Boron atoms, due to their electron&#8208;deficient nature, have been extensively studied in luminescent, semiconductor, and chemical sensing materials. This review highlights the synthesis and properties of boron&#8208;containing graphene nanoribbons, covalent organic frameworks, and 2D conjugated polymers. Their tunable electronic structures pave the way for innovations in optoelectronics, catalysis, energy storage and etc.







Abstract
Organic two&#8208;dimensional materials have garnered widespread attention due to their well&#8208;defined structures, structural diversity, and rich electronic effects, demonstrating significant application potential across various fields. Atomic&#8208;level manipulation of the structures of organic two&#8208;dimensional materials has been a primary strategy for enriching and optimizing their properties. The introduction of heteroatoms often significantly affects their electronic structure, thereby endowing these materials with novel and unique properties. Boron atoms, due to their electron&#8208;deficient nature, have been extensively studied in luminescent materials, semiconductor materials, and chemical sensing materials. Consequently, boron&#8208;containing organic two&#8208;dimensional materials are also believed to be promising as a new class of materials with excellent optoelectronic and chemical activities. This article collates and summarizes the preparation and property studies of three types of boron&#8208;containing organic two&#8208;dimensional materials in recent years.

         <title>Ortho Arylation of N&#8208;Aryl Amides and the Construction of Diagonal Tetraarylbenzenediamines and N&#8208;Doped Fulminenes via BBr3&#8208;Derived Dibromoboracycles</title>

         <dc:description>
We report the discovery of a boron&#8208;driven ortho&#8208;arylation reaction of N&#8208;aryl amides and ureas. This novel method enables directed borylation of a wide range of substrates, leading to the synthesis of unique compounds such as N&#8208;doped fulminene and diagonal tetraarylbenzenediamines. These compounds hold significant promise for applications in pharmaceuticals, materials science, and organic synthesis.







Abstract
The synthesis of biaryl amides, which are prevalent motifs in bioactive molecules, often necessitates lengthy and inefficient procedures. To address these limitations, catalytic C&#8722;H activation protocols have emerged, enabling the direct ortho&#8208;arylation of aryl amides. However, these protocols often suffer from issues such as lack of selectivity, reliance on stoichiometric oxidants, and the requirement for excess reagents and harsh reaction conditions. To overcome these challenges, we present a novel and highly selective protocol for the ortho&#8208;arylation of N&#8208;aryl amides and ureas. The high selectivity originates from the directed installation of BBr3 to form a boracycle, which then undergoes cross&#8208;coupling with an aryl halide. Our method offers significant advantages, including mild reaction conditions, excellent site&#8208;specificity, and scalability. The protocol demonstrates broad compatibility with a diverse range of readily accessible functionalized anilides and aryl iodides, as evidenced by 55 successful examples yielding products in the 30&#8211;95&#8201;% range. Furthermore, our methodology surpasses conventional approaches by facilitating the one&#8208;pot selective diagonal diarylation of dianilides. This capability unlocks the construction of previously unattainable diagonal aryl systems, which serve as valuable precursors for the synthesis of diagonal tetraarylbenzenediamines and N&#8208;doped fulminenes, two crucial compound classes in materials science.

         <title>A Multistep Oxidative Cascade Reaction from a Naphthalenediol&#8208;Based Pre&#8208;Ligand to a Tetranuclear Perylenequinone&#8208;Based FeIII Complex</title>

Two 1,8&#8208;naphthalenediol&#8208;based ligands are coupled in a multistep oxidative cascade reaction to a tetranuclear perylenequinone&#8208;based FeIII complex involving an overall 10&#8208;electron oxidation. The assignment of the electronic structure of the new backbone is based on experimental data supported by DFT calculations.







Abstract
We have developed a family of dinuclear complexes using 2,7&#8208;disubstituted 1,8&#8208;naphthalenediol ligands that bind by molecular recognition to two neighboring phosphate diesters of the DNA backbone with the dinuclear CuII and NiII complexes exhibiting a severe cytotoxicity for human cancer cells. To increase the binding affinity, we intended to synthesize the corresponding dinuclear FeIII complex. Surprisingly, we obtained a tetranuclear FeIII perylene&#8208;based complex instead of the expected dinuclear FeIII naphthalene&#8208;based complex. In order to establish a rational and reproducible synthesis, we carefully analyzed this reaction. This revealed a multistep oxidative cascade reaction including the pre&#8208;coordination of FeII ions in the N3&#8208;binding pockets, the Lewis&#8208;acid assisted MOM&#8208;deprotection of the pre&#8208;ligand by the pre&#8208;oriented FeII ions, two oxidative aromatic C&#8722;C coupling reactions, oxidation of the perylene&#8208;based backbone and of FeII to FeIII. The careful analysis of bond lengths, HOMA indices (harmonic oscillation model of aromaticity), FTIR and UV&#8208;Vis&#8208;NIR spectra supported by DFT calculations reveals the presence of an aromatic 18&#8208;electron oxidized perylenequinone ligand backbone. In summary, a multistep cascade reaction involving in total a 10&#8208;electron oxidation has been established for the straight&#8208;forward synthesis of an unprecedented perylenequinone&#8208;based ligand system.

         <title>A Chalcogenide&#8208;Derived NiFe2O4 as Highly Efficient and Stable Anode for Anion Exchange Membrane Water Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work develops a new strategy for reconstructing NiFe&#8208;based chalcogenides to highly efficient and alkali&#8208;stable NiFe2O4&#8208;based OER electrode (NiFeOx&#8208;350&#8208;Ov) for the anion exchange membrane water electrolyzer. Coupled with a non&#8208;noble metal&#8208;based cathode, the resulting device displays energy efficiency and stability as high as the proton exchange membrane water electrolyzer.







Abstract
Developing low&#8208;cost, highly active, and durable oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrodes is one of the critical scientific issues for anion exchange membrane water electrolyzer (AEM&#8208;WE). Herein, we report a vacancy&#8208;rich and alkali&#8208;stable NiFe2O4&#8208;type electrode (named as NiFeOx&#8208;350&#8208;Ov), derived from the chemical&#8208;vapor deposited precursor NiFeSexSy&#8208;350, as an efficient and robust anode material. The obtained electrode affords current densities of 100 and 500&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at overpotentials of 245 and 270&#8197;mV, respectively, and displays excellent long&#8208;term durability sustaining 1.0&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at least for 1000&#8197;h. When coupled with Ni4Mo/MoO2/NF as a hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) catalyst, the resulting platinum&#8208;group metal (PGM)&#8208;free single&#8208;cell AEM&#8208;WE exhibits a cell voltage of 1.71&#8197;V at the current density of 1000&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 80&#8201;&#176;C and long&#8208;term durability during a current&#8208;cycling test between 0.5&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and 1.0&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 over 150&#8197;h at 60&#8201;&#176;C. This work highlights a unique reconstruction strategy for preparing highly active and durable OER catalysts used in PGM&#8208;free AEM&#8208;WE.

When coupled with Ni&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;Mo/MoO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/NF as a hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) catalyst, the resulting platinum-group metal (PGM)-free single-cell AEM-WE exhibits a cell voltage of 1.71&#8197;V at the current density of 1000&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; at 80&#8201;&#176;C and long-term durability during a current-cycling test between 0.5&#8197;A&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; and 1.0&#8197;A&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; over 150&#8197;h at 60&#8201;&#176;C. This work highlights a unique reconstruction strategy for preparing highly active and durable OER catalysts used in PGM-free AEM-WE.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Molecular Engineering of Covalent Organic Frameworks for Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution from Water</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The photoelectrochemical properties and photocatalytic performance over hydrogen evoluation reaction of covalent organic frameworks can be significantly affected through molecular engineering of nitrogen sites by regulating the content and position of nitrogen atoms in the COFs. As a result, the optimal photocatalyst TpPpm with excellent capacities of charge transfer and electron&#8208;hole separation exhibits superior hydrogen production rates among all COFs.







Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have demonstrated significant potential as photocatalysts for efficiently generating hydrogen through photocatalytic water splitting. However, the design of COFs with distinct organic unit blocks at a molecular level profoundly influences their photocatalytic performance. In this study, we synthesized a series of &#946;&#8208;ketoamine COFs through molecular engineering of nitrogen sites, including phenyl&#8208;structured TpBD, phenylpyridine&#8208;structured TpPpy, phenylpyrimidine&#8208;structured TpPpm, and bipyridine&#8208;structured TpBpy. Advanced characterization techniques reveal that TpPpm and TpBpy with more nitrogen sites exhibit superior efficiencies in electron transfer and charge separation compared to TpBD and TpPpy, thereby endowing them with enhanced photocatalytic performance for hydrogen evolution from water. As a result, the photocatalytic hydrogen production rates of TpPpm (33.80&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1) and TpBpy (29.18&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1) surpass those of TpBD (20.82&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1) and TpPpy (27.49&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1). Additionally, due to the different plane symmetries between Ppm and Bpy resulting from the various positions of nitrogen sites, TpPpm displays superior photochemical properties and better photocatalytic performance compared to TpBpy. Moreover, theoretical calculation results further confirm the exceptional intramolecular charge transfer ability of TpPpm among all COFs. This work underscores the significance of precisely controlling N sites in COFs for designing high&#8208;performance photocatalysts.

         <title>Development of Continuous&#8208;Flow Reactions for the Synthesis of Anti&#8208;Alzheimer Drug Memantine</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Memantine hydrochloride, a non&#8208;competitive antagonist of NMDA&#8208;type glutamate receptors, is known to suppress the progression of symptoms in Alzheimer's disease. Possessing a characteristic adamantane skeleton as its core structure and an amino group at the bridgehead position, memantine was synthesized starting from acenaphthene. The synthesis involved nucleus hydrogenation of acenaphthene to perhydroacenaphthene, skeletal rearrangement of perhydroacenaphthene, nitration of 1,3&#8208;dimethyladamantane, and reduction of the nitro groups to an amino group. In each step, continuous flow reactions were investigated to achieve continuous manufacturing of memantine.</dc:description>

         <title>Unveiling the Long&#8208;Awaited Aldehyde Intermediate in Oxidative Dephosphorylation: A Unique Approach to Access Useful Carboxaldehydes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Oxidative dephosphorylation reactions usually generate symmetrically substituted alkenes from organophosphonates. Even the ubiquitous presence of oxygen can produce such alkenes inadvertently as a side product in small amounts from Wittig/ Horner&#8208;Wadsworth&#8208;Emmons (HWE) reactions. So far, aldehydes have been expected to be the on&#8208;pathway intermediate since their discovery, but there was no substantial experimental evidence to support this. Herein, aldehyde intermediates are judiciously trapped before forming alkene on dephosphorylation reactions of diverse phosphonates. Consequently, a unique synthetic strategy has been established to access structurally diverse aldehydes by oxidizing phosphonate carbanions using molecular oxygen. This is the first report to trap and isolate aldehydes since the historical discovery of Wittig/ HWE reactions. Only ketone/amide was isolated as a support, but no aldehyde. The optimization studies offer 48&#8208;84% reaction yields of such aldehydes. The mechanistic studies are validated with reaction mixture 1H and 31P&#8208;NMR studies. Along with other various aldehydes, a unique class of structurally diverse anthracenyl aldehydes exhibiting intense fluorescence has been identified. The extended process to bis&#8208;phosphonates led to bis&#8208;carboxaldehyde forming in 52&#8208;68% yield within 30 min. The scope is further extended to achieve 2,1,3&#8208;benzothiadiazole&#8208;linked phosphonate, functionalized with carboxaldehyde.</dc:description>

         <title>TiO2&#8208;Phase&#8208;Mediated Size Effect of Rh Nanoparticles on Photothermal Catalytic CO2 Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photothermal catalytic CO2 hydrogenation on TiO2&#8208;based catalysts has drawn extensive attention. However, few reports have focused on the impact of particle size of the active sites by altering TiO2 crystal phase on the CO2 hydrogenation activity. Herein, we successfully regulated Rh nanoparticle size by adjusting the crystal phases of TiO2 at different calcination temperatures and obtained impressive photothermal catalytic CO2 hydrogenation performance. Notably, the anatase&#8208;phase TiO2 loaded with Rh nanoparticles achieved a CH4 production rate of 2.7 mmol&#8729;h&#8722;1 with nearly 100% selectivity and a single&#8208;pass CO2 conversion rate of 69.4%. Given the anatase&#8208;phase TiO2 is more favorable for the presence of surface hydroxyl groups and oxygen vacancies, which can facilitate the distribution of Rh cations, Rh nanoparticles on the anatase&#8208;phase TiO2 exhibited the smallest sizes. Small Rh particle size further enhanced CO2 adsorption and activation, leading to high photothermal CO2 hydrogenation performance. Furthermore, the optimized Rh nanoparticle&#8208;loaded anatase&#8208;phase TiO2 catalyst exhibited high structural stability and resistance to coke accumulation, maintaining stability during long&#8208;term performance tests. This work investigated the particle size effect of active sites adjusted by crystal phase of light&#8208;harvesting materials on the photothermal catalytic performance, providing guidance for the preparation of effective catalysts for CO2 hydrogenation to CH4.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>This work describes the scalability process of a continuous&#8208;injection protocol employed to produce tin&#8208;doped indium oxide nanocrystal dispersions. Different levels of manipulation starting from the synthesis and processing also related to the tuning of the optical response (considering the peculiar combination of UV and NIR absorption with visible transparency) make these materials incredibly versatile. But one of the most attractive features concern the modulation of their charge carrier density through chemical or post&#8208;synthetic doping, as for the case of core&#8208;shell materials, expanding the properties of the core composition. In addition, the colloidal nature of such materials allows for easy solution processing which enables an extensive use in different applications within current thin films base technologies.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Exfoliation of non&#8208;layered materials is crucial to unleash their enormous potential in wide range of applications. However, the presence of strong non&#8208;van der Waals interactions in all three dimensions makes exfoliation challenging. Boron carbide (B4C), known for its high hardness, holds great potential for diverse applications. In this work, B4C is exfoliated in 29 solvents to determine its Hansen solubility parameters (HSP) and understand the dispersion stability. The experimentally determined HSP values are 19.6, 15.3 and 15.1 MPa1/2 for dispersive interactions (&#948;D), polar interactions (&#948;P) and hydrogen bonding interactions (&#948;H), respectively. Subsequently, in situ dispersion stability is analyzed qualitatively and quantitatively from the space&#8208;time resolved extinction profiles employing an analytical centrifuge. The sedimentation kinetics of B4C dispersions are analyzed using instability index, integral extinction and sedimentation velocity. B4C dispersions in solvents like &#949;&#8208;caprolactone, isopropyl alcohol, propylene carbonate and formamide exhibited excellent stability. Additionally, B4C nanosheets are utilized to investigate their field emission properties. These nanosheets exhibit a turn&#8208;on electric field of 3.35 V/&#956;m at an emission current density of 1 &#956;A cm&#8208;2, and it delivered a large emission current density of ~ 375 &#956;A cm&#8208;2 at an applied electric field of 5.7 V/&#956;m.</dc:description>

         <title>Tailoring ORR Activity in Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C Catalysts through Phosphorus Incorporation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C catalysts, doped with phosphorus, show improved ORR activity. Fe&#8208;NPC catalyst exhibits high metal loading, excellent ORR performance (onset potential of 1.00&#8197;V, half&#8208;wave potential of 0.864&#8197;V), and promising application in Zn&#8208;air batteries (758.8&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1Zn). DFT calculations reveal that phosphorus enhances O2 activation and reduces the energy barrier for the rate&#8208;determining step.







Abstract
Atomically dispersed iron and nitrogen co&#8208;doped carbon materials (Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C) represent promising non&#8208;precious metal catalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), offering potential alternatives to noble metal&#8208;based benchmarks. In our study, we investigated the influence of phosphorus doping on the catalytic activity of Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C. The experimental research demonstrate that the doping of phosphorus significantly enhances the ORR activity. Specifically, the resulting Fe&#8208;NPC exhibits high metal loading and excellent ORR activity in 0.1&#8197;M KOH with an onset potential of 1.00&#8197;V and a half&#8208;wave potential of 0.864&#8197;V. Density functional theory (DFT) simulations reveal that phosphorus improves the electrocatalytic activity by activating O2 molecules and reducing the energy barrier (the hydrogenation reaction *OH&#8594;H2O) of the rate&#8208;determining step. Furthermore, Fe&#8208;NPC exhibits promising application prospects as an air cathode in Zn&#8208;air batteries, delivering a high maximum discharge power density of 180.3&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and outstanding discharge specific capacity (758.8&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1Zn) at a discharge current density of 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2.

         <title>Synthesis of Polysubstituted Vinyl Sulfones by Direct C&#8722;S Cross&#8208;Coupling</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A process for the synthesis of polysubstituted vinylsulfones under mild conditions was developed to promote a selective, post&#8208;synthetic integration of molecular diversity, which should expedite the discovery of new medicines.







Abstract
Vinyl sulfones are valued for their unique chemical properties and bioactivity, but creating a wide range of different analogs remains a challenge. To address this limitation, we have developed a novel approach that facilitates the synthesis of polysubstituted vinyl sulfones. This method utilizes the dual functionality of NIS as a promoter that enables sulfonation and elimination in the synthesis of vinyl sulfones. We used the broad applicability, efficiency, selectivity, and functional group tolerance of this approach to synthesize more than 70 examples. Additionally, competition experiments have provided insights into the reactivity and selectivity of the transient sulfonyl radical towards various C&#8722;C multiple bonds. Herein, we describe using this mild protocol in the late&#8208;stage vinyl sulfonation of complex molecules to simplify the synthesis of specific targets and enable the modification of complex natural products and advanced materials.

         <title>Oxydiazomethylation of Alkenes via Photoredox Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general and modular approach for the direct 1,2&#8208;formyloxyl&#8208;diazomethylation of alkenes through visible&#8208;light photoredox catalysis has been developed to assemble &#947;&#8208;hydroxyl&#8208;&#945;&#8208;diazoesters.







Abstract
&#945;&#8208;Diazoesters belong to significantly important carbenoid precursors in synthetic chemistry. Diazomethylation&#8208;based difunctionalization of alkenes is highly valuable but remain nontrivial. Herein, we reported a general and modular approach for the direct 1,2&#8208;oxydiazomethylation of alkenes through visible&#8208;light photoredox catalysis. This process exploits photocatalyzed strategy to convert alkenes to &#947;&#8208;formyloxyl&#8208;&#945;&#8208;diazoesters using &#945;&#8208;diazo iodonium salts as carbyne precursors, featuring wide substrate tolerance and broad late&#8208;stage diversifications. Mechanistic studies suggest that the formation of &#947;&#8208;carbocation&#8208;tethered &#945;&#8208;diazoesters plays a crucial role in trapping DMF and H2O to allow for this transformation.

         <title>Regulating Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence of Organic Luminophores Through Stepwise Stabilization by Coordination and In&#8208;Situ Precipitation Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The dim and short&#8208;lived RTP emissive organic molecules were transferred into afterglow materials with an emission efficiency of 45&#8201;% and emission lifetime of 1.9&#8197;s, through a straightforward coordination and in&#8208;situ precipitation reaction. The coordination reaction reduced the energy gaps between singlet and triplet states and stabilized the excited states of the guest molecules.







Abstract
Developing efficiency and long&#8208;lived room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) materials through straightforward methods is highly desired. In this work, a stepwise stabilization strategy was proposed by the coordination and in&#8208;situ precipitation reactions among organic precursors, inorganic cation and anions, producing room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence materials with high emission efficiency (phosphorescence quantum yield of 45&#8201;%). Structural and photophysical characterizations revealed the coordination reaction reduced the energy gaps between singlet and triplet states and stabilized the excited states of the guest molecules. The in&#8208;situ precipitation reaction produced a solid matrix, which provided isolated environments for protecting the excitons from quenching.

&lt;p&gt;The dim and short-lived RTP emissive organic molecules were transferred into afterglow materials with an emission efficiency of 45&#8201;% and emission lifetime of 1.9&#8197;s, through a straightforward coordination and in-situ precipitation reaction. The coordination reaction reduced the energy gaps between singlet and triplet states and stabilized the excited states of the guest molecules.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Developing efficiency and long-lived room-temperature phosphorescence (RTP) materials through straightforward methods is highly desired. In this work, a stepwise stabilization strategy was proposed by the coordination and in-situ precipitation reactions among organic precursors, inorganic cation and anions, producing room-temperature phosphorescence materials with high emission efficiency (phosphorescence quantum yield of 45&#8201;%). Structural and photophysical characterizations revealed the coordination reaction reduced the energy gaps between singlet and triplet states and stabilized the excited states of the guest molecules. The in-situ precipitation reaction produced a solid matrix, which provided isolated environments for protecting the excitons from quenching. The applications of RTP materials in information encryption were demonstrated. The presented results provided a new clue for producing RTP materials, and extended their applications in wide fields.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Changes in Secondary Structure Upon Pr to Pfr Transition in Cyanobacterial Phytochrome Cph1 Detected by DNP NMR</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Phytochromes undergo structural changes upon light reception, involving a &#946;&#8208;sheet&#8208;to&#8208;helix transition for the canonical subgroup. We show this for the cyanobacterial phytochrome Cph1, that has a different sheet sequence than a previous example, by solid&#8208;state NMR under dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) conditions. An estimation of minimal helix length suggests conservation of the mechanism.







Abstract
Phytochromes perceive subtle changes in the light environment and convert them into biological signals by photoconversion between the red&#8208;light absorbing (Pr) and the far&#8208;red&#8208;absorbing (Pfr) states. In the primitive bacteriophytochromes this includes refolding of a tongue&#8208;like hairpin loop close to the chromophore, one strand of an antiparallel &#946;&#8208;sheet being replaced by an &#945;&#8208;helix. However, the strand sequence in the cyanobacterial phytochrome Cph1 is different from that of previously investigated bacteriophytochromes and has a higher &#946;&#8208;sheet propensity. We confirm here the transition experimentally and estimate minimum helix length using dynamic nuclear polarisation (DNP) magic angle spinning NMR. Sample conditions were optimized for protein DNP NMR studies at high field, yielding Boltzmann enhancements &#1013;B of 19 at an NMR field of 18.801&#8197;T. Selective labelling of Trp, Ile, Arg, and Val residues with 13C and 15N enabled filtering for pairs of labelled amino acids by the 3D CANCOCA technique to identify signals of the motif 483Ile&#8208;Val&#8208;Arg485 (IVR) present in both sheet and helix. Those signals were assigned for the Pfr state of the protein. Based on the chemical shift pattern, we confirm for Cph1 the formation of a helix covering the IVR motif.

         <title>Parts&#8208;Per&#8208;Million Level Loading Cyclometalated Ru(II)&#8208;NHC Catalyzed Selective Oxidation of Olefins to Carbonyls</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Imidazo[1,5&#8208;a]quinoxaline&#8208;based cyclometalated ruthenium complex&#8208;catalyzed selective oxidative scission of olefins to carbonyls is reported. Complex shows high catalytic activity and a long lifetime. Protocol is compatible with a wide range of substrate including biomass, natural products, sugar, amino acids, and fatty acid&#8208;derived compounds. The use of the by&#8208;product NaIO3 in the catalytic efficiency is disclosed for the first time.







Abstract
Oxidative cleavage of olefins is a useful reaction in organic synthesis. The most well&#8208;known catalytic system is the osmium based Lemieux&#8208;Johnson catalyst, which generally requires high catalyst loading and tends to suffer from rapid overoxidation to produce the acid predominantly. Hence, the development of a mild, general, and selective method toward the oxidative cleavage of alkenes to carbonyl compounds is highly desired. In this work, a highly efficient ruthenium&#8208;based catalyst for olefin oxidation has been demonstrated by employing a fused &#960;&#8208;conjugated imidazo[1,5&#8208;a]quinoxaline (ImQx) based NHC ligand with bidentate C(carbanion)&#8201;CNHC motif. Strong C&#8208;donor ligands, paired with a rigid backbone and ruthenium redox activity, provided exceptionally high catalytic activity and a long lifetime for olefin oxidation. Complex showed high catalytic activity and a long lifetime, TONs are several million. The catalyst tolerates numerous functional groups and can be applicable to challenging biomass, natural products, sugar, amino acids, and fatty acid&#8208;derived substrates. Based on kinetic studies, thermodynamic activation parameters, and DFT study, the mechanistic finding demonstrated that [3+2] cycloaddition reaction is the key step in the oxidation process. The use of the by&#8208;product NaIO3 in the catalytic efficiency has been disclosed for the first time.

         <title>Synthesis of Clickable Isotactic Poly(vinyl ether)s through Organocatalytic Stereoselective Cationic Copolymerization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly stereoselective cationic copolymerization of C&#8722;C triple bond&#8208;containing vinyl ethers with simple alkyl vinyl ethers has been successfully developed by employing confined Br&#248;nsted acid as catalyst. Subsequent post&#8208;modification of the clickable alkyne groups via thiol&#8208;yne click reactions or copper(I)&#8208;catalyzed alkyne&#8208;azide cycloaddition reaction enables a modular access to isotactic polymers with various functional groups.







Abstract
By virtue of the high reliability of click chemistry, polymers with clickable groups provide a useful platform for the rapid synthesis of polymer materials with diverse functionalities and architectures. However, the polymerization of clickable vinyl monomers with a concurrent regulation on tacticity remains underdeveloped. Herein, we report the successful development of a stereoselective cationic copolymerization of C&#8722;C triple bond&#8208;containing vinyl ethers with simple alkyl vinyl ethers by employing confined Br&#248;nsted acid as catalyst, which allows for the synthesis of alkyne&#8208;functionalized vinyl ether copolymers with high isotacticity (up to 90&#8201;% m), controlled molecular weight, and variable content of C&#8722;C triple bonds. Further transformation of the pendant clickable alkyne groups via thiol&#8208;yne click reactions and copper(I)&#8208;catalyzed alkyne&#8208;azide cycloaddition reaction enables a modular access to isotactic polymers with various functional groups.

         <title>Active Photonic Glass for Hydrogen Generation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This article reports the fabrication of photonic glass with a chiral nematic structure using a simple sol&#8208;gel evaporation&#8208;induced cellulose nanocrystals self&#8208;assembly method. The glass exhibits variable iridescent colors over the UV&#8208;visible range. The chiral nematic structure provides the photoactive films the capability to improve the localized surface plasmon of Au and lead to improved photocatalytic H2 generation







Abstract
Chirality is vital in many living species since it is responsible for structural iridescent coloration and plays a key role in light harvesting during natural photosynthesis. Developing photoactive materials with such chiral structures is a challenging but promising strategy for energy applications. Here, we present a straightforward method to establish an active photonic glass obtained through the co&#8208;condensation of tetramethyl orthosilicate (TMOS) and titanium diisopropoxide bis(acetylacetonate) (TAA) dissolved in a liquid crystal formed from cellulose nanocrystalline (CNC). The inorganic glass maintains a long range of chiral nematic ordering, displaying iridescent colors characterized by a Bragg peak reflection. The reflected wavelengths are tuned all over the UV&#8208;visible range, demonstrating that the replica of the chiral nematic structure generates photonic properties. Incorporation of gold nanoparticles (Au NPs) into the films is further performed by impregnation/chemical reduction. We show that the charge carrier density and photocatalytic H2 generation were amplified when the photonic band gap edges matched the absorbance of the TiO2 and localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) of AuNPs. This photocatalytic glass with chiral nematic ordering and a tunable photonic bandgap paves the way for the development of metamaterials with new applications, such as asymmetric photocatalysis.

In this study, a bimetallic iron&#8208;cobalt phytic acid complex loaded with polyaniline hollow structure (FCP@PAn) was constructed, via a progress of selective etching and surface modification in one step without high&#8208;temperature phosphating or carbonization. The FCP@PAn displayed high catalytic activity and stability at high current densities.







Abstract
Developing oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts in an efficient strategy, while maintaining high catalytic activity and stability under high current densities, remains a crucial problem. In this study, a bimetallic iron&#8208;cobalt phytic acid complex loaded with polyaniline hollow structure (FCP@PAn) was successfully constructed, via a progress of selective etching and surface modification in one step without high&#8208;temperature phosphating or carbonization. The as&#8208;obtained FCP@PAn required only 329 and 385&#8197;mV overpotentials at high current densities of 500 and 1000&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, respectively, due to phytic acid and polyaniline incorporation and the coordinated effect of each component. Additionally, the FCP@PAn exhibited the lowest Tafel slope values of 44.6&#8197;mV&#8201;dec&#8722;1 and was able to continuously operate for 120&#8197;h at 500&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, displaying high catalytic activity and stability. Hence, the hollow structure of the conductive polymer and MOFs composites provided a new surface modification strategy for transition metal&#8208;based catalysts that are prone to dissolution or corrosion during the OER process, as well as for high current density applications.

         <title>Remarkable Effect of Stereoisomerism on the Am(III)/Ln(III) Solvent Extraction. New Ligands for Highly Efficient Separation of Americium</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
DAPhen ligands with chiral carbon atoms in amide substituents selectively extract Am(III) from strongly acidic media reaching SFAm(III)/La(III) values of 140. DAm(III) is nearly an order of magnitude higher for individual meso&#8208;forms. An abrupt increase in extraction efficiency from La(III) to Lu(III) is a result of formation of unusual L2M2 or even L4M5 ionic complexes of heavy lanthanides.







Abstract
Two novel 1,10&#8208;phenanthroline&#8208;2,9&#8208;diamide ligands were constructed on the basis of 2&#8208;phenylpyrrolidine and obtained as pure diastereomers. These ligands demonstrated advanced properties in liquid&#8208;liquid extraction tests. They revealed high efficiency of americium(III) extraction alongside with the record values of selectivity in the separation of americium from light lanthanides from strongly acidic media. An abrupt increase of extraction efficiency when moving along the lanthanide series from lanthanum to lutetium was observed. The examination of the extraction behavior of pure diastereomeric forms revealed noticeable differences in their selectivity while maintaining the overall extraction trend. The explanation of the discovered patterns was elucidated by a comprehensive study of the ability of the ligands to bind lanthanide nitrates in solutions. All the data collected (UV&#8208;vis and NMR titration, X&#8208;ray analysis of resulting complexes, solvation numbers estimation) were supported by quantum chemical calculation. These data clearly indicated that in the case of light lanthanides the formation of 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 complexes is most preferable. At the same time, complexes with heavy lanthanides, such as ytterbium and lutetium, exist as ionic pairs which may consist of [L2M]z+ cations counterbalanced by metallate anions, which may result in the formation of the species of unusual composition like L2M2 or even L4M5 clusters.

         <title>Bispecific Thio&#8208;Linked Disaccharides as Inhibitors of Pseudomonas Aeruginosa Lectins LecA (PA&#8208;IL) and LecB (PA&#8208;IIL): Dual&#8208;Targeting Strategy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a major pathogen linked to cystic fibrosis, relies on the virulence factors, lectins LecA and LecB, responsible for the cytotoxicity and adhesion to host cells. As inhibitors of these lectins, thiodisaccharides were synthesized including bispecific compounds targeting both lectins. Their inhibitory potential was confirmed, and structural insights were gained from ligand&#8208;lectin interactions.







Abstract
Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a prevalent opportunistic human pathogen, particularly associated with cystic fibrosis. Among its virulence factors are the LecA and LecB lectins. Both lectins play an important role in the adhesion to the host cells and display cytotoxic activity. In this study, we successfully synthesized hardly hydrolysable carbohydrate ligands targeting these pathogenic lectins, including two bispecific glycans. The interactions between LecA/LecB lectins and synthetic glycans were evaluated using hemagglutination (yeast agglutination) inhibition assays, comparing their efficacy with corresponding monosaccharides. Additionally, the binding affinities of bispecific glycans were assessed using isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC). Structural insight into the lectin&#8208;ligand interaction was obtained by determining the crystal structures of LecA/LecB lectins in complex with one of the bispecific ligands using X ray crystallography. This comprehensive investigation into the inhibitory potential of synthetic glycosides against P. aeruginosa lectins sheds light on their potential application in antimicrobial therapy.

         <title>Evolution Enhances Kemp Eliminase Activity by Optimizing Oxyanion Stabilization and Conformational Flexibility</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The HG3&#8208;to&#8208;HG3.17 evolutionary pathway enhances Kemp eliminase activity by refining active&#8208;site interactions and enhancing conformational dynamics. Molecular dynamics simulations reveal that a water&#8208;mediated network of non&#8208;covalent interactions supports a catalytically competent conformation. Gln50 contributes to oxyanion stabilization, while Trp44 regulates Gln50 flexibility, influencing active&#8208;site preorganization and catalytic efficiency for the most evolved variant HG3.17.







Abstract
The base&#8208;promoted Kemp elimination reaction has been used as a model system for enzyme design. Among the multiple computationally designed and evolved Kemp eliminases generated along the years, the HG3&#8208;to&#8208;HG3.17 evolutionary trajectory is particularly interesting due to the high catalytic efficiency of HG3.17 and the debated role of glutamine 50 (Gln50) as potential oxyanion stabilizer. This study aims to elucidate the structural and dynamic changes along the evolutionary pathway from HG3 to HG3.17 that contribute to improved catalytic efficiency. In particular, we evaluate key variants along the HG3 evolutionary trajectory via molecular dynamics simulations coupled to non&#8208;covalent interactions and water analysis. Our computational study indicates that HG3.17 can adopt a catalytically competent conformation promoted by a water&#8208;mediated network of non&#8208;covalent interactions, in which aspartate 127 (Asp127) is properly positioned for proton abstraction and Gln50 and to some extent mutation cysteine 84 (Cys84) contribute to oxyanion stabilization. We find that HG3.17 exhibits a rather high flexibility of Gln50, which is regulated by the conformation adopted by the active site residue tryptophan 44 (Trp44). This interplay between Gln50 and Trp44 positioning induced by distal active site mutations affects the water&#8208;mediated network of non&#8208;covalent interactions, Gln50 preorganization, and water content of the active site pocket.

         <title>Stepwise Construction of Supramolecular A2B4&#8208;Type Miktoarm Star Copolymers with a Cobalt Phthalocyanine Core</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal&#8208;ligand coordination has been used to generate a supramolecular miktoarm star&#8208;shaped copolymer with a cobalt(II) phthalocyanine (CoPc) core. Stepwise axial coordination of the terminal pyridyl group of poly(methyl methacrylate) to the CoPc core of the four&#8208;armed, star&#8208;shaped polystyrene provided AB4&#8208; and A2B4&#8208;type microstars.







Abstract
Supramolecular interactions between polymers play a crucial role in the construction of three&#8208;dimensional polymer structures with unique physical and chemical properties. In this study, we have fabricated a novel supramolecular miktoarm star copolymer (&#956;&#8208;star) with a cobalt(II) phthalocyanine (CoPc) core using metal&#8208;ligand coordination. Axial coordination of the terminal pyridyl group of poly(methyl methacrylate) with the CoPc core of four&#8208;armed star&#8208;shaped polystyrene provided AB4&#8208; and A2B4&#8208;type &#956;&#8208;stars through stepwise complexation. The spin&#8208;coated polymer films from mixed solutions of CoPcPS4 and pyPMMA in 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 or 1&#8201;:&#8201;2 mass ratios exhibited phase&#8208;separated nanodomains with smooth surfaces. Supramolecular interactions in polymer systems provide a unique topology to polymers and affect their bulk morphology.

The spin-coated polymer films from mixed solutions of CoPcPS&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and pyPMMA in 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 or 1&#8201;:&#8201;2 mass ratios exhibited phase-separated nanodomains with smooth surfaces. Supramolecular interactions in polymer systems provide a unique topology to polymers and affect their bulk morphology.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>The Photophysics of Naphthalimide&#8208;Phenoselenazine Electron Donor&#8208;Acceptor Dyads: Revisiting the Heavy&#8208;Atom Effect in Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence</title>

TADF: Heavy&#8208;Atom Effect Does Not Always Enhance rISC: We prepared compact orthogonal electron donor/acceptor dyads. The delayed fluorescence lifetime and triplet state lifetime of compounds containing heavy atoms are longer than the heavy atom&#8208;free counterparts, suggesting that the heavy atom effect on the rISC is not straightforward. The simultaneous observation of the presence of LE and CS triplet states in the TREPR spectra is the experimental evidence for the spin&#8208;vibronic coupling mechanism for TADF.







Abstract
We prepared thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitter dyads, NI&#8208;PTZ, NI&#8208;PTZ&#8208;2Br and NI&#8208;PSeZ, with naphthalimide (NI) as electron acceptor and 10H&#8208;phenothiazine (PTZ) or 10H&#8208;phenoselenazine (PSeZ) as electron donor to study the heavy&#8208;atom effect on the intersystem crossing (ISC) and reverse ISC (rISC) in the TADF emitters. The delayed fluorescence lifetimes of the dyads containing heavy atoms (

Nanosecond transient absorption (ns&#8208;TA) spectral study and the time&#8208;resolved electron paramagnetic resonance (TREPR) spectra show the presence of both 3LE and 3CS states. These findings represent solid experimental evidences for the spin&#8208;vibronic coupling mechanism of TADF. Moreover, the ns&#8208;TA spectra show that the heavy atoms don't have a significant effect since the lifetime of the triplet transient species (1.3&#8197;&#956;s for NI&#8208;PTZ) is not shortened in their presence (4.5&#8197;&#956;s for NI&#8208;PSeZ and 5.3&#8197;&#956;s for NI&#8208;PTZ&#8208;2Br). These results show that the previously claimed heavy&#8208;atom effect on rISC and TADF is not a universal principle. The femtosecond transient absorption (fs&#8208;TA) spectra of the compounds indicate the occurrence of fast charge separation within 1&#8211;2&#8197;ps, and the charge recombination is slow (&gt;4 ns)

         <title>Engineering Metal&#8208;MOF Interfaces for Selective CO2 Hydrogenation to Methanol</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The hydrogenation of CO2 to methanol is a promising pathway toward sustainable fuel production and carbon recycling. A key factor in the efficiency of this process lies in the interaction between the metal catalyst and its support. Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks (MOFs) have emerged as highly effective platforms due to their tunable structures, large surface areas, and ability to form stable interfaces with single&#8211;atom metals or metal nanoparticles. These metal&#8208;MOF interfaces are crucial for stabilizing active sites, preventing sintering, and enhancing catalytic performance. In this concept paper, we explore the role of these interfaces in promoting CO2 hydrogenation, focusing on Cu&#8208;Zn, Cu&#8208;Zr, and Zn&#8208;Zr interfaces. The formation of strong interactions between metal sites and MOF nodes enables precise control over the dispersion and electronic environment of the active species, significantly improving methanol selectivity and long&#8208;term stability. By analyzing recent advancements in MOF&#8208;supported catalysts, this work highlights the concept of engineered metal&#8208;MOF interfaces to drive the development of next&#8208;generation catalysts for efficient methanol synthesis from CO2.</dc:description>

         <title>Dispersion Forces&#8208;Driven Hierarchical Assembly of Protein&#8208;Like Lanthanide Octamers and Emergent CPL</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hierarchical self&#8208;assembly driven by non&#8208;covalent interactions is a prevalent strategy employed by nature to construct sophisticated biomacromolecules, such as proteins. However, the construction of protein&#8208;like superstructures that rely on weaker dispersion forces&#8208;driven hierarchical assembly remains largely unexplored. Here, we report the first example of dispersion forces driving the high&#8208;order assembly of the lanthanide trinuclear circular helicate [HNEt&#8323;]&#8323;[Eu&#8323;(LL)&#8326;] (&#916;&#916;&#916;&#8208;1) into a protein&#8208;like lanthanide octamer ((&#916;&#916;&#916;&#8208;1)&#8328;&#8208;2). Within the octamer, the forty&#8208;eight (48) menthol groups on the ligands and eighty&#8208;four (84) 1,4&#8208;dioxane solvent molecules contribute to enhanced dispersion forces through conformational adaptation and size&#8208;matching effects. These enhanced dispersion forces not only drive the formation of the hierarchical superstructure but also result in a four&#8208;level chirality transfer from the menthol to the octamer. Benefiting from the homochirality of Eu&#179;&#8314;, the octamer is endowed the strong circularly polarized emission (|glum| = 0.34, &#934;overall = 41%). This understanding of how dispersion forces drive hierarchical self&#8208;assembly provides a foundation for the directed fabrication of more fascinating superstructures.</dc:description>

         <title>Insight into the Simultaneous Super&#8208;Stable Mineralization of AsO43&#8722;, Cd2+ and Pb2+ Using MgFe&#8208;LDHs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, the MgFe&#8208;CO3 and MgFe&#8208;NO3&#160;were synthesized by Separate Nucleation and Aging Steps and ion&#8208;exchange method, respectively. The MgFe&#8208;CO3 demonstrated the maximum saturation adsorption capacity of 55.86, 543.48 and 1597.4 mg g&#8722;1 for single AsO43&#8722;, Cd2+ and Pb2+ in aqueous solution, while MgFe&#8208;NO3 exhibited 92.50, 387.59 and 869.56 mg g&#8722;1, respectively. Kinetic and thermodynamic results for mineralization of single AsO43&#8722;, Cd2+ and Pb2+ fitted well with the pseudo&#8208;second&#8208;order kinetic model and Langmuir isotherm model, indicating the occurrence of chemisorption and monolayer adsorption for both MgFe&#8208;CO3 and MgFe&#8208;NO3. Furthermore, simultaneous mineralization of AsO43&#8722;, Cd2+ and Pb2+ with &gt; 99.0% efficiency in 240 min in aqueous solution and &gt; 81.1% efficiency in 14 days in soil can be achieved by both MgFe&#8208;CO3 and MgFe&#8208;NO3. Preliminary experiments indicated that the released Mg2+ ions from MgFe&#8208;CO3 and MgFe&#8208;NO3 were capable to promote the emergence and growth of red bean seedlings. The&#160;AsO43&#8722; anions were adsorbed on the laminate of LDHs, whereas the Pb3(OH)2(CO3)2 was the mineralization product for both MgFe&#8208;CO3 and MgFe&#8208;NO3. In terms of Cd2+, CdCO3 was obtained as a mineralization product for MgFe&#8208;CO3, while CdCO3 and Cd(OH)2 can be detected due to the slow transformation of MgFe&#8208;NO3 to MgFe&#8208;CO3 in air.</dc:description>

         <title>Critical Evaluation of Childs Method for the NMR Spectroscopic Scaling of Effective Lewis Acidity: Limitations and Resolution of Earlier Discrepancies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Quantifying Lewis acidity is essential for understanding and optimizing the performance of Lewis acids in diverse applications. Next to the widely accepted Gutmann&#8208;Beckett (GB) method, using triethyl phosphine oxide (TEPO) as a probe, the Childs method&#8212;employing trans&#8208;crotonaldehyde (TCA)&#8212;gained attention as an NMR&#8208;based technique for measuring effective Lewis acidity (eLA). Despite its steady use, the robustness of Childs method and its correlation with other measures remain underexplored. Previous comparisons between the GB and Childs scales revealed significant discrepancies, suggesting that hard and soft acid/base (HSAB) characteristics may be operative. In this study, we compare thermodynamic data for TCA binding to 117 Lewis acids (representing global Lewis acidity, gLA) with their corresponding NMR&#8208;induced chemical shifts in TCA. Our findings showcase notable deviations that reinforce key distinctions between eLA and gLA perspectives. Moreover, we identify significant limitations in the Childs method. First, the weak donor strength of TCA limits its applicability to only the strongest Lewis acids. Second, the exposed protons of TCA are prone to secondary interactions, obscuring the measurement of true Lewis acidity. Finally, our analysis reconciles discrepancies, refuting earlier assumptions that these arise from HSAB effects.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Quantifying Lewis acidity is essential for understanding and optimizing the performance of Lewis acids in diverse applications. Next to the widely accepted Gutmann-Beckett (GB) method, using triethyl phosphine oxide (TEPO) as a probe, the Childs method&#8212;employing trans-crotonaldehyde (TCA)&#8212;gained attention as an NMR-based technique for measuring effective Lewis acidity (eLA).

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The aryloxyamine motif is a prominent pharmacophore in drug design and development. While these biologically relevant structures could in principle be sustainably assembled from the base metal&#8208;catalyzed O&#8208;arylation of inexpensive and abundant amino alcohols with (hetero)aryl chlorides, reports of such challenging C&#8211;O bond formations with useful scope are lacking. In response, we report herein the hitherto unknown Ni&#8208;catalyzed C&#8211;O cross&#8208;coupling of N&#8208;protected amino alcohols (primary, secondary, and tertiary) with (hetero)aryl chlorides.

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembly of a Perfluorinated Amphiphilic Cyanine Dye into Branched Tubular J&#8208;Aggregates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The self&#8208;assembly process is governed by the individual constituents of molecules through precise non&#8208;covalent interactions. Amphiphilic cyanines are intriguing in supramolecular chemistry due to the large polarizability of their delocalized &#960;&#8211;electron systems, their tuneable optical properties and their ability to form well&#8208;defined self&#8208;assembled structures in different media. Here we present the synthesis of a novel tetrahydroxy amphiphilic carbocyanine dye with perfluoro alkylated chains &#8208;(CH2)2&#8208;(CF2)5&#8208;CF3 as hydrophobic segments and aminoproanediol as hydrophilic segment. The target molecule was synthesized in a multi&#8208;step process, which illustrates the complexity and precision required to achieve the desired structure. This study focuses on the comparison of the influence of C8H17 and C8H4F13 tails and the effects of carboxylated and non&#8208;ionic aminopropanediol head groups as substituents on self&#8208;assembly of the TBC dye. Absorption and fluorescence measurements show similar spectroscopic properties to cyanine dyes studied previously. Cryogenic transmission electron microscopy (cryo&#8208;TEM) reveals formation of multiple supramolecular aggregates. As supramolecular assembly is very sensitive to sample preparation, multilamellar or multivesicular vesicles are obtained preferentially in vigorously vortexed solutions. Moreover, time&#8208;dependent tube formation was observed in gently mixed solutions. Thereby, we could follow the growing mechanism of the unprecedented Y&#8208;junctions of supramolecular tubes.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Bis(diimino)palladium Nanosheets as Highly Active Electrocatalysts for Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Development of efficient electrocatalysts for hydrogen evolution reactions (HERs) is necessary to achieve environmentally friendly and sustainable hydrogen production. To reduce cost and to circumvent the scarcity of platinum, the most efficient catalyst for HER, it is essential to develop catalysts using ubiquitous base metals or minimal amounts of precious noble metals. Bis(diimino)metal (MDI) coordination nanosheets are potential HER catalysts because their electric conductivities, two&#8208;dimensionality, and porous structures provide large surface areas and efficient mass and electron transfer. In addition, with sparse metal arrangements in their chemical structures, nanosheets can reduce the amount of metal needed. We synthesized bis(diimino)palladium coordination nanosheets (PdDI) as a coordination polymer composed of bis(diimino)palladium, with semiconducting characteristics, using gas&#8208;liquid interfacial synthesis and electrochemical oxidation. These electrochemically synthesized PdDIs exhibit remarkable catalytic performance with overpotential reaching 10 mA cm&#8722;2 of 34 mV, a Tafel slope of 47 mV dec&#8722;1, and an exchange current density of 2.1 mA cm&#8722;2 after appropriate activation. This performance is closely comparable to that of metallic platinum. An ex&#8208;situ investigation of the activation process revealed that reduction of the divalent Pd center in bis(diimino)palladium produced a composite of Pd(0) species and PdDI, combining high catalytic activity with smooth electron transfer.</dc:description>

Four shades of pastel: The synthesis, reactivity and in&#8208;depth characterisation of cationic group 15 carbene analogues is reported.







Abstract
The synthesis, characterization and reactivity of the diferrocenylphosphenium ion [Fc2P]+ was extended to the heavier diferrocenylpnictogenium ions, [Fc2E]+ (E=As, Sb, Bi). The lighter diferrocenylnitrenium ion, [Fc2N]+, was detected by mass spectrometry, but could not be isolated. The molecular structures of [Fc2E]+ (E=P, As, Sb, Bi) reveal intramolecular coordination of the iron atoms, which counterbalance the electron deficiency of the pnictogens without affecting the strong Lewis acidities, which were determined according to the method of Gutmann and Beckett. The (electro&#8722;)chemical oxidation and reduction afforded the dications [Fc2E]2+ (E=P (unstable), As) and the neutral dipnictogens Fc2EEFc2 (E=P, As).

         <title>&#960;&#8208;mers and &#960;&#8208;dimers: Two Radical Supramolecular Interactions &#8211; A Tutorial Review</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
&#960;&#8208;mers and &#960;&#8208;dimers are two radical interactions being easily confused on account of their similarities. This tutorial review introduces i) a clear definition of each interaction, ii) their main physico&#8208;chemical differences observable by major analytical techniques (X&#8208;Ray, UV/Vis/NIR, EPR, NMR and electrochemistry), iii) some of their thermodynamic features, and iii) examples showing strategies to enhance their stability (using a covalent spacer, a confined environment and mechanical bonds).







Abstract
In this review, the difference between &#960;&#8208;mers (pimers) and &#960;&#8208;dimers (pi&#8208;dimers) will be discussed. Often interchanged or confused in the literature, these two radical interactions lead to different or even opposite physico&#8208;chemical behaviors. This review aims at clarifying the terms &#960;&#8208;mers and &#960;&#8208;dimers and at describing their main physico&#8208;chemical properties to address their differences. Finally, selected literature examples exhibiting the successive formation of &#960;&#8208;mers and &#960;&#8208;dimers within the same systems will be detailed to emphasize the physico&#8208;chemical changes occurring upon conversion.

A fresh approach to 2&#8208;quinolone synthesis! This study presents an innovative organocatalytic electrophilic arene amination strategy, enabling the efficient synthesis of a diverse array of 2&#8208;quinolones &#8211; a critical scaffold with extensive industrial applications. By circumventing traditional metal&#8208;based catalysts, this approach paves the way for advancements in multiple sectors, offering a sustainable and versatile alternative.







Abstract
For decades, the synthesis of 2&#8208;quinolones, a crucial structural motif in pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals, has relied heavily on costly noble metal complexes and structurally complex ligands. Despite considerable efforts from synthetic chemists, a mild, metal&#8208;free, environmentally friendly, and cost&#8208;effective approach has remained elusive. This study introduces a robust, metal&#8208;free synthetic platform that leverages an innovative organoiodine&#8208;catalyzed electrophilic arene C(sp2)&#8722;H amination strategy to efficiently produce a wide range of new and modifiable 2&#8208;quinolones. Moreover, this study allows ready synthetic access to novel 8&#8208;aryl&#8208;substituted 2&#8208;quinolones, uncovering new chemical spaces with significant potential for medicinal applications.

         <title>Metal Pyrazolyl&#8208;Diphosphonate Pillared Materials as Heterogeneous Catalysts in the Mukaiyama&#8208;Type Aerobic Olefin Epoxidation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The coordination of the organic PZDP linker to alkaline earth or transition metals yields 2D&#8208;pillared metal phosphonate frameworks under solvothermal or hydrothermal conditions. The structures of the materials are determined and the catalytic performance of Co&#8208;PZDP is tested in the Mukaiyama olefin epoxidation, achieving high yields of the corresponding epoxides.







Abstract
The structural variability and chemical stability of metal phosphonates under harsh conditions are attractive attributes that have drawn considerable attention in recent years. As the need for more sustainable solutions rises, the demand for novel and tolerant materials also increases. Thus, herein we report, for the first time, the synthesis of a novel diphosphonic organic linker named pyrazole diphenyl phosphonate (PZDP), envisioning the fabrication of durable metal phosphonates. In view of this, a series of M&#8208;PZDP materials (M=Ca, Sr, Ba, Zn and Co) were synthesized employing either solvothermal or hydrothermal methods. The crystal structures of the Ca, Sr, Zn, and Co derivatives were determined revealing a 2D&#8208;pillared architecture. Zn&#8208;PZDP is an anionic framework with dimethylammonium cations. The Co&#8208;PZDP compound was tested as a heterogeneous catalyst in olefin epoxidation employing molecular oxygen.

         <title>A Novel Methacryloyl&#8211;Masked NIR Fluorescent Probe for Detection of Cysteine and Its Application in Bioimaging</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report the NIR fluorescent probe SNC&#8208;Cys that allows Cys detection. It is a highly sensitive and selective fluorescent probe that detects Cys based on the ICT photo mechanism. The probe works through Michael addition. SNC&#8208;Cys was successfully employed in the endogenous and exogenous imaging of Cys in living cells with good cell permeability.







Abstract
Cysteine (Cys) detection is recognized as an essential element in this investigation due to the critical function of Cys in several physiological processes in living organisms. A new NIR fluorescent probe SNC&#8211;Cys has been synthesized by incorporating a five&#8208;membered malononitrile derivatized ring as an electron withdrawing group, and a methacryloyl group detection moiety for cysteine. After adding Cys, SNC&#8211;Cys shows an emission of 654&#8197;nm and further works as a &#8220;Turn&#8211;on&#8221; probe via ICT photomechanism. SNC&#8211;Cys has high sensitivity and selectivity for Cys (LOD=0.46&#8197;&#956;M) and can discriminate it from other closely related amino acids, molecules with structural similarity, and in some cases very close functional group likeness. Thus, these results allow the effective imaging of Cys in living A549 cells which indicates good cell permeability and high applicability in live cell imaging. This study anticipates that SNC&#8211;Cys could be an aid in the detection of Cys&#8211;relevant diseases.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Coreactants Enhanced Electrochemiluminescence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
One plus one is greater than two: A remarkable electrochemiluminescence (ECL) enhancement of Ru(bpy)32+/TPrA is observed by introducing another coreactant, TEOA, with a 10.8&#8208;fold increase of ECL intensity and 1.7&#8208;fold extension of ECL layer. The enhancement was interpreted by a chemical oxidation route, in which TEOA+&#8901; acts as an enhancer to produce more TPrA+&#8901; and meanwhile allow the remote formation of TPrA+&#8901;. This dual&#8208;coreactants strategy works not only in solution with freely diffusive Ru(bpy)32+ but also on Ru(bpy)32+&#8208;functionalized microbeads, showing promise in ECL&#8208;based bioassay and microscopy.







Abstract
The electrochemiluminescence (ECL) of ruthenium(II) tris(2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridyl) (Ru(bpy)32+) with tri&#8208;n&#8208;propylamine (TPrA) as the good coreactant can be unexpectedly enhanced by a weak coreactant, such as triethanolamine (TEOA). First, the intensity of ECL emitted by Ru(bpy)32+/TPrA can be remarkably amplified by 10.8&#8208;fold after adding some amount of TEOA. Moreover, the ECL layer thickness, measured by self&#8208;interference spectroscopy, is also doubled. The enhancement far exceeding the superposition of respective contribution of TPrA and TEOA was elucidated by a &#8220;chemical oxidation mechanism&#8221;, in which TEOA+&#8901; acts as a chemical enhancer to oxidize TPrA in solution and to accelerate significantly the ECL reaction kinetics. This mechanism was proved by single&#8208;photon counting experiment and finite element simulations. In addition, the dual&#8208;coreactants strategy works well not only in solution with freely diffusive Ru(bpy)32+, but also on Ru(bpy)32+&#8208;functionalized microbeads, suggesting that ethanolamines could act as cheap, easily available and low&#8208;background enhancers for ECL&#8208;based bioanalysis and microscopy.

Phase&#8208;pure, crystalline &#947;&#8208;Sn3N4 was synthesized via reaction of argon&#8208;diluted SnCl4 with Mg3N2. The exothermic nature of the reaction is controlled by slow mixing of the starting materials with a continuous flow of argon. The reaction can be further facilitated by the use of a tin flux. This new method not only leads to pure &#947;&#8208;Sn3N4 material, but is also promising for the synthesis of other nitride materials.







Abstract
Nitrides represent a promising class of materials for a variety of applications. However, bulk synthesis remains a challenging task due to the stability of the N2 molecule. In this study, we introduce a simple and scalable approach for synthesizing nitride bulk materials. Moderate reaction temperatures are achieved by using reactive starting materials, slow and continuous mixing of the starting materials, and by dissipating heat generated during the reaction. The impact on the synthesis of using different starting materials as nitrogen source and the influence of a flux were examined. &#947;&#8208;Sn3N4 was selected as the model compound. The synthesis of pure &#947;&#8208;Sn3N4 bulk material on a large scale has still been a challenge, although a few synthesis methods were already described in the literature. Here we synthesized &#947;&#8208;Sn3N4 by metathesis reaction of argon&#8208;diluted SnCl4 with Li3N, Mg3N2 or Ca3N2 as nitrogen sources. Products were characterized by powder X&#8208;ray diffraction, scanning and transmission electron microscopy, energy&#8208;dispersive X&#8208;ray spectroscopy, dynamic flash combustion analysis, hot gas extraction analysis, X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy, M&#246;ssbauer spectroscopy and X&#8208;ray absorption and emission spectroscopy. Additionally, single&#8208;crystal diffraction data of &#947;&#8208;Sn&#8323;N&#8324;, previously unavailable, were successfully collected.

         <title>Nutation Spectroscopy of a Weakly Interacting Heterobimetallic Spin System</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An heterobimetallic VIV&#8722;CuII complex is synthesized by a modular process involving external coordination sites of a porphyrinato ligand and a PdII linker. Pulsed Electron Paramagnetic Resonance experiments, in particular spin nutation spectroscopy at variable microwave powers or magnetic fields, reveals weak but non&#8208;negligible magnetic interactions and the presence of two transitions of different tipping angles.







Abstract
The use of VIV and CuII spins to design weakly coupled and dissymmetric spin systems has been examined. Such systems were synthesized using porphyrin&#8208;based complexes, with external coordination sites allowing for the formation of dimers via a PdII linker ion. Continuous&#8208;wave (CW) Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) spectroscopy allowed the unequivocal magnetic characterization of the mononuclear precursors VO and Cu. The porphyrin dimer (VO)PdCu presented a broad and overlapped spectrum that was more pronounced than for the previously reported (VO)Pd(VO), hinting at the effect of weak interspin interactions between dissimilar spins. Pulsed EPR experiments on VO, (VO)Pd(VO) and (VO)PdCu samples diluted in a diamagnetic matrix confirmed that this complication is also present in the Field&#8208;Swept Echo&#8208;Detected (FSED) spectra of the heterometallic (VO)PdCu system. Despite the strongly overlapped field&#8208;swept spectra, spin nutation experiments revealed two distinct oscillations in the case of (VO)PdCu, which are assigned to transitions with different spin characters. Remarkably, coherence is retained above liquid nitrogen temperatures for all complexes, in particular up to 295&#8197;K for VO and (VO)Pd(VO) and 150&#8197;K for (VO)PdCu.

         <title>Translating Solid&#8208;Phase Conformational Memory in the Prophecy of Multi&#8208;stimuli Responsive Low Molecular Weight Gels</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Introducing flexible non&#8208;polar functional groups, a bis&#8208;urea based low molecular weight organogelator is synthesized. Three distinct polymorphic crystalline phases of the gelator were isolated with noticeable solubility differences. Different stimuli like heat&#8208;cool, sonication, shaking, grinding showed varied gelling performances among the polymorphic phases further corroborated with their solubility parameter in the respective gelling solvents.







Abstract
Polymorphism and its screening to select the best&#8208;performing form is in high demand. In low molecular weight organogels (LMWG), gelators are designed as they contain flexible groups, functionalities capable of varied H&#8208;bonding, and increased the potential to show polymorphism. We synthesized a bis&#8208;urea based LMWG G1 and isolated three distinct polymorphic phases (Form I, II, and III). G1 polymorphs showed noticeable differences in solubility; precisely, Form I is highly soluble compared to the other two. Gel screening was carried out for all three polymorphs using different stimuli like heat&#8208;cool, sonication, shaking, and grinding. Among the polymorphs, Form I was found to have better gelling ability which was reflected by the solvent scope, thermal stability (gel&#8208;sol transition temperature Tgel), minimum gelator concentration (M.G.C.), stimuli&#8208;responsiveness, morphology, and rheological properties. The differences in their gelation performance among the three polymorphs are associated with their solubility parameter. Stimuli like sonication, shaking, and grinding triggered Form I to form a gel. Form II and III responded to heat&#8208;cool stimuli only due to poor solubility. Therefore, it is noted crucial to add polymorph screening as an integral part of the gel synthesis to avoid problems associated with reproducibility in the gel prophecy of LMWG systems.

         <title>An Organic Vapor&#8208;Responsive Actuator Based on a Novel Urea Macrocycle</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A polymeric composite incorporating a novel urea macrocycle as a filler has been shown to act as a soft actuator that is responsive to organic solvent vapors. The actuation mechanism arises from a crystalline phase transition of the urea macrocycle at the molecular level, driven by host&#8211;guest interactions.







Abstract
The mechanical actuation of smart materials has garnered considerable attention in biological and medical research due to their ability to mimic biological processes at both molecular level, such as conformational changes in individual compounds, and at the macroscopic level, where polymeric substrates respond to external stimuli. In this study, we present a polymeric composite incorporating a novel urea macrocycle as a filler, forming a soft actuator that responds to various organic solvent vapors. The underlying actuation mechanism is attributed to crystalline phase transition of urea macrocycle, driven by the host&#8211;guest interactions with diverse guest molecules. This work provides valuable insights for advancing the design of supramolecular hosts in smart material applications.

         <title>Stereodivergent Macrocyclization in Dynamic Chiral Confinement</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Full stereodivergence in a macrocyclization event can be achieved by implementing a dynamic chirality switching into robust confinement using a repeatedly switchable chiral capsule. The consecutive chirality switching enables the confined reactions of an enclosed achiral substrate to sequentially install multiple chirality with full stereocontrol by changing only a sequence of physical stimuli.







Abstract
The absolute and relative configurations of a macrocyclic natural product bearing multiple chirality have a crucial influence on its physical and biological properties. Nevertheless, their preparation with full stereocontrol remains largely unexplored in synthetic community. Here, we show a stereodivergent macrocyclization under dynamic chiral confinement in which the stepwise chirality switching of a chiral space directs complete stereocontrol. To confine a substrate in a dynamic chiral space, we used a chiral capsule enclosing a substrate which is collectively switchable in the chirality in response to external stimuli, but their conformations are firmly fixed by subsequent self&#8208;assembly. The consecutive chirality switching enables the confined reactions of an enclosed achiral substrate to sequentially install diverse chirality on a macrocycle product with full stereocontrol in a single pot operation, thus changing only a sequence of physical stimuli enables access to a remarkable stereodivergence in a macrocyclization process.

         <title>Open Sn Framework Structure Hosting Bi Guest atoms&#8211;Synthesis, Crystal and Electronic Structure of Na13Sn26Bi</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Na13Sn26&#8208;xBi1+x is the first compound in the Na&#8208;Sn&#8208;Bi ternary system. Sn atoms form a three&#8208;dimensional open framework hosting Na and also one loosely bound Bi guest atom. Interestingly, for both x=0 and x=2 results a semiconducting small indirect band gap Zintl compound owning the same atomic structure but different electron numbers.







Abstract
The large variety of structures of Zintl phases are generally well understood since their anionic substructures follow bonding rules according to the valence concept. But there are also exceptions, which make the semiconductors especially interesting in terms of structure&#8208;property relationships. Although several Na&#8208;Sn&#8208;Pnictides with a variety of structural motives are known, up to this point no ternary compound in the Na&#8208;Sn&#8208;Bi system has been described. In this paper we present the Zintl&#8208;phase Na13Sn25.73Bi1.27 comprising a complex, open&#8208;framework structure of Sn atoms, with one mixed Sn/Bi site, hosting Na atoms. An additional Bi atom is loosely connected with only weak contacts to the framework filling a larger cavity within the network. According to band structure calculations of the two ordered variants with either full occupation of the mixed site with Sn or Bi, resulting in Na13Sn26Bi and Na13Sn24Bi3, respectively, both compounds are semiconductors with band gaps of 0.5&#8197;eV. A comparison of the band structures with the structurally related binary compounds Na5Sn13 and Na7Sn12 shows that only the perfectly charge balanced Na7Sn12 is a semiconductor whereas Na5Sn13 is metallic. The rather specific electronic situation in the ternary compound is traced back to the loosely bound Bi atom, which acts as a guest atom according to Bix@Na13Sn26&#8208;yBiy, with x=1 and y=0.27, capable to change its oxidation state and thus to uptake additional electrons allowing the system to be a semiconductor. Therefore, Na13Sn25.73Bi1.27 can be understood as a rare example of an open framework structure of Sn atoms comprising Bi atoms in the cavities.

A Pd(II)&#8208;catalyzed non&#8208;template synthesis of furo[2,3&#8208;b]pyrrolo[2,3&#8208;d]pyridines from &#946;&#8208;ketodinitriles and buta&#8208;1,3&#8208;diynes has been accomplished via dual annulative cyclization. The participation of both the nitrile (&#8722;CN) groups led to the concurrent construction of three heterocycles viz. furan, pyrrole, and pyridine forming C&#8722;C, C=C, C&#8722;O, C&#8722;N, and C=N bonds in one pot. The synthetic utility of the protocol was further demonstrated through a few post&#8208;synthetic manipulations.

         <dc:description>
An unprecedented bis(hexahapto)&#8208;coordination mode for terphenyl substituents was identified in reaction of deprotonated Ar*GeH3 with [(COD)RhCl]2 followed by chloride abstraction. The germanium bridged cationic dirhodium complex features a delocalized [Rh&#8722;Ge&#8722;Rh] &#960;&#8208;system. The [RhGeRh]&#8208;cation abstracts a chloride ligand from transition metal chloride complexes and acts as metal&#8208;only Lewis base chelating the metal fragments.







Abstract
Terphenylgermanium Ar*Ge [Ar*=C6H3(2,6&#8208;Trip)2, Trip=2,4,6&#8208;C6H2iPr3] was found to act as a novel &#956;2&#8208;Ge&#8208;bis(hexahapto&#8208;Trip) bridging ligand. Deprotonated terphenyl germanium trihydride [Li(thf)3][Ar*GeH2] (1) undergoes reductive elimination and transfer of hydrogen in reaction with dimeric [(COD)RhCl]2 to yield the dinuclear complex [Ar*GeRh(COE)RhCl(COD)] (2). Subsequent chloride abstraction from compound 2 using Na[BArF4] or Li[Al(OtBuF)4] results in the cationic complexes [Ar*GeRh(COE)Rh(COD)][WCA] (3) {WCA: [BArF4]&#8722; (ArF=C6H3&#8211;3,5&#8208;(CF3)2), [Al(OtBuF)4]&#8722;}. Ligand exchange of olefin for CO yields the carbonyl complex [Ar*Ge(Rh(CO))2][BArF4] (4). In an alternative approach to the synthesis of carbonyl complex 4, [Li(thf)3][Ar*GeH2] (1) was treated with [Rh(CO)2Cl]2 leading to the isolation of a hexanuclear rhodium cluster [(&#956;3&#8208;Ar*Ge)2{Rh(CO)2}6(&#956;3&#8208;H)2] (5) in reasonable yield. In reactions with [Rh(CO)2Cl]2 or [Ph3PAuCl] complex 4 abstracts the chloride ligand and forms tetranuclear complexes featuring a GeRh3&#8208; or GeRh2Au&#8208;rectangle, [Ar*GeCl(Rh3(CO)4)][BArF4] (6), or [Ar*GeCl{Rh2(CO)2}(AuPPh3)][BArF4] (7).

         <title>Regulating Zn Deposition Manner by Confining the Reactivity of Free Water in the Electric Double Layer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
To address the poor reversibility of Zn anode, we propose to use benzotriazole as decent electrolyte additive to confine the reactivity of free water in the electric double layer, which can adsorb on the surface of Zn metal and then react with Zn2+ to form solid Zn&#8208;BTA complexes on the Zn anode surface.







Abstract
Aqueous Zn ion batteries (AZIBs) are promising candidates of next&#8208;generation energy storage devices with high safety and theoretical capacity. However, the irreversibility of metallic Zn anode, attributed to dendrite growth and water decomposition, severely limits the cycling durability of AZIBs and restricts their further development. Herein, a facile surface engineering strategy is put forward to tackle the issue of poor reversibility of the Zn anode. Benzotriazole (BTA) is employed as a functional additive of ZnSO4 electrolyte to confine the reactivity of free water situated in the electric double layer (EDL). Experimental results and theoretical simulation reveal that BTA can preferiencially adsorb onto the Zn surface to uniform Zn2+ ion distribution and alleviate H2O&#8208;involved side reactions like hydrogen evolution, and surface passivation.

     alt="Regulating Zn Deposition Manner by Confining the Reactivity of Free Water in the Electric Double Layer"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To address the poor reversibility of Zn anode, we propose to use benzotriazole as decent electrolyte additive to confine the reactivity of free water in the electric double layer, which can adsorb on the surface of Zn metal and then react with Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; to form solid Zn-BTA complexes on the Zn anode surface.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aqueous Zn ion batteries (AZIBs) are promising candidates of next-generation energy storage devices with high safety and theoretical capacity. However, the irreversibility of metallic Zn anode, attributed to dendrite growth and water decomposition, severely limits the cycling durability of AZIBs and restricts their further development. Herein, a facile surface engineering strategy is put forward to tackle the issue of poor reversibility of the Zn anode. Benzotriazole (BTA) is employed as a functional additive of ZnSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; electrolyte to confine the reactivity of free water situated in the electric double layer (EDL). Experimental results and theoretical simulation reveal that BTA can preferiencially adsorb onto the Zn surface to uniform Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; ion distribution and alleviate H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O-involved side reactions like hydrogen evolution, and surface passivation. Consequently, in BTA-modulated aqueous electrolyte, the lifespan of the Zn anode is extended from 170&#8197;h&#8211;1092&#8197;h at 1&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;/1&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;. The reversibility improvement of Zn anode also benefits the cycling durability of full devices including supercapacitors and batteries. Zn||I&#8322; batteries assembled in as-designed electrolyte witness only 11.3&#8201;% capacity decay over 17000 cycles at 1&#8197;A&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, far outstripping that observed in ZnSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; counterpart (~4675 cycles). The design criteria proposed in this study offers a new concept for the development of regulation additives that confine the reactivity of free water in the electric double layer.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Site&#8208;specifically Phosphorylated Hsp90C&#8208;terminal Domain Variants Provide Access to Deciphering the Chaperone Code.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>

Expressed Protein Selenoester Ligation (EPSL) allows for an efficient generation of semi&#8208;synthetic Hsp90 CTD bearing site&#8208;specific phosphorylations in a traceless manner to facilitate elucidation of the chaperone code.







Abstract
The ubiquitous molecular chaperone Heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) is pivotal in many cellular processes through folding of client proteins under stressed and normal conditions. Despite intensive research on its function as a chaperone, the influence of posttranslational modifications on Hsp90 (the &#8216;chaperone code&#8217;), and its interactions with co&#8208;chaperones and client proteins, still remains to be elucidated. The C&#8208;terminal domain (CTD) of Hsp90 is essential for formation of the active homodimer state of Hsp90 and contains recognition sites for co&#8208;chaperones and client proteins. Here we used expressed protein selenoester ligation to introduce site&#8208;selective phosphorylations in the Hsp90 CTD, while preserving the native amino acid sequence. The two phosphorylations do not affect the overall secondary structure, but in combination, slightly decrease the thermal stability of the CTD. The Hsp90 CTD functions as a chaperone in decreasing aggregation of model client proteins, but the C&#8208;terminal phosphorylations do not significantly alter the anti&#8208;aggregation activity for these clients. The optimization of expressed protein selenoester ligation (EPSL) to carry out several steps in one pot provides an efficient route to access site&#8208;specifically modified Hsp90 CTD variants, allowing the generation of Hsp90 variants with site&#8208;specific PTMs to decipher the chaperone code.

         <title>Highly Luminescent Aceno[6]helicenones by Intramolecular Radical Cyclization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Carbo[n]helicenes are poor emitters with the emission peak in purple or blue region. Inserting a carbonyl group into the skeleton shifts the emission to longer wavelengths and greatly improves the fluorescence quantum yield. The color can be tuned by shifting the position of the carbonyl.







Abstract
Helicenes and helicenoid structures are promising candidates for future applications exploiting circularly polarized light. Ideal candidates should possess near&#8208;quantitative photoluminescence quantum yield, a high luminescence dissymmetry factor and an adjustable HOMO&#8208;LUMO gap. However, carbo[n]helicenes are poorly luminescent compounds and they absorb light mainly in the ultraviolet region. Here we show that the incorporation of a carbonyl group into helical scaffold significantly improves the fluorescence quantum yield and shifts the absorption to visible region. Although the carbonyl group is commonly considered as detrimental to efficient emission, fluorescence quantum yields up to &#934;=0.43 were recorded. A straightforward synthetic approach to a highly luminescent tetraceno[6]helicenone and an aza analogue has been developed. The key step is a radical cyclization which is achieving dehydrative &#960;&#8208;extension. The aza&#8208;analogue was incorporated as an emitter in organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs) and showed good performance.

Consequently, they exhibit great potential in various applications, including blood vessel removal, controlled delivery systems, soft actuation, and robotics. The recent work on liquid crystal elastomer tubal actuators, hydrogel tubal actuators, and shape memory plastic tubal actuators is introduced, emphasizing their potentials in various biomedical and engineering applications.

This perspective emphasizes the advantages, response mechanisms, and fundamental design principles of stimuli&#8208;responsive polymers for tubal actuators. It also addresses the biological and engineering applications, current challenges, and future prospects of stimuli&#8208;responsive polymers for tubal actuators. The discussion categorizes stimuli&#8208;responsive polymers for tubal actuators based on various properties, including liquid crystal elastomer actuators, hydrogel actuators, and shape memory polymer actuators. The subsequent sections focuses on the structural features, design principles, and biological applications of stimuli&#8208;responsive polymers for tubal actuator, elucidating their potential interrelationships. The molecular architectures and design principles are intricately linked to the stimuli&#8208;responsive mechanisms.

         <title>Functionalization of Emulsion Interfaces: Surface Chemistry Made Liquid</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Emulsions are widely used disperse liquid/liquid systems but usually carrying inert interfaces. Here, we overview the existing methods to functionalize their interfaces, which we categorize into coating strategies and methods based on emulsifiers as function carriers. We emphasize the importance of their liquid nature, from current challenges to perspectives for future studies and applications.







Abstract
Disperse systems, and emulsions in particular, are currently massively used in fields as varied as food industry, cosmetics, health care and environmentally&#8208;friendly materials. To meet increasingly precise needs or targeted applications, these systems need to be endowed with new functionalities at their interfaces, in addition to their composition and structural properties. However, due to the fragility of drops and the low reactivity of their surface, conventional solid surface chemistry cannot be used for such a purpose. Several specific emulsion interface functionalization techniques have thus been developed for targeted systems and applications, but a general framework has yet to be drawn. In this review, we attempt to present these methods in a unified way through the prism of what we may call &#8220;liquid surface chemistry&#8221;. We propose to categorize existing methods into drop&#8208;coating strategies, including layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer techniques and polymer coating, with a particular focus on polydopamine, and emulsifier&#8208;carrier approaches involving particles and/or amphiphilic molecules. They are discussed in a transversal way, highlighting the underlying physico&#8208;chemical principles and providing a comparative analysis of their advantages, current limitations and potential for improvement. We also propose future directions and opportunities, involving for instance DNA&#8208;based programmability or artificial intelligence, which could make liquid surface chemistry more versatile and controlled.

         <title>Advances in Pyridine C &#8211; H Functionalizations: Beyond C2 Selectivity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The pyridine core is a crucial component in numerous FDA&#8208;approved drugs and Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulated agrochemicals. It also plays a significant role in ligands for transition metals, alkaloids, catalysts, and various organic materials with diverse properties, making it one of the most important structural frameworks. However, despite its significance, direct and selective functionalization of pyridine is still relatively underdeveloped due to its electron&#8208;deficient nature and the strong coordinating ability of nitrogen. Among the variety of synthetic transformation, direct functionalization of C&#8208;H bond is straightforward and atom economical approach and it&#8217;s advantageous for late&#8208;stage functionalization of pyridine containing drugs.

This review emphasizes the latest advancements in meta and para&#8208;C&#8208;H functionalization of pyridines through various approaches, including pyridine phosphonium salts, photocatalytic methods, temporary de&#8208;aromatization, Minisci&#8208;type reactions, and transition metal&#8208;catalyzed C&#8208;H activation techniques.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The pyridine core is a crucial component in numerous FDA-approved drugs and Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulated agrochemicals. It also plays a significant role in ligands for transition metals, alkaloids, catalysts, and various organic materials with diverse properties, making it one of the most important structural frameworks. However, despite its significance, direct and selective functionalization of pyridine is still relatively underdeveloped due to its electron-deficient nature and the strong coordinating ability of nitrogen. Among the variety of synthetic transformation, direct functionalization of C-H bond is straightforward and atom economical approach and it&#8217;s advantageous for late-stage functionalization of pyridine containing drugs. In recent years, innovative strategies for regioselective C-H functionalization of pyridines and azines have emerged, offering numerous benefits such as high regioselectivity, mild conditions, and enabling transformations that were challenging with traditional methods. This review emphasizes the latest advancements in meta and para-C-H functionalization of pyridines through various approaches, including pyridine phosphonium salts, photocatalytic methods, temporary de-aromatization, Minisci-type reactions, and transition metal-catalyzed C-H activation techniques. We discuss the advantages and limitations of these current methods and aim to inspire further progress in this significant field.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Superior Ionic Conducting Plastic Crystal Near Room Temperature with Electrical Bistability and Magnetic Transition</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Multifunctional ionic plastic crystals (IPCs) are a class of unique materials that exhibit a wide range of advanced applications. In this work, we proposed a strategy for the design of multifunctional, superior ion&#8208;conducting IPCs with bistability in both magnetic and electric properties, moreover, we successfully prepared and thoroughly characterized such an IPC, [PMPyr][Ni(mnt)2] (1; PMPyr&#8314; = N&#8208;propyl&#8208;N&#8208;methylpyrrolidinium, and mnt2&#8315; = maleonitriledithiolate). Plastic crystal 1 exhibits superior ion conduction near room temperature, and its ion conductivity reaches the order of 10&#8315;&#178; S cm&#8315;&#185; at 373 K. Remarkably, the crystal&#8208;to&#8208;plastic crystal transformation results in 1 simultaneously exhibiting electrical bistability and magnetic transition. Our study paves the way for the development of new IPCs with desirable functional properties.</dc:description>

         <title>Hybrid Strategies for Enhancing the Multifunctionality of Smart Dynamic Molecular Crystal Materials</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dynamic molecular crystals are an emerging class of smart engineering materials that possess unique ability to convert external energy into mechanical motion. Moreover, they have being considered as strong candidates for dynamic elements in applications such as flexible electronic devices, artificial muscles, sensors, and soft robots. However, the inherent defects of molecular crystals like brittleness, short&#8208;life and fatigue, have significantly impeded their practical applications. Inspired by the concept of "the whole is greater than the sum of its parts" in the field of biology, building stimuli&#8208;response composites materials can be regarded as one of the ways to break through the current limitations of dynamic molecular crystals. Moreover, the hybrid materials can exhibit new functionalities that cannot be achieved by a single object. In this review, the focus was placed on the analysis and discussion of various hybrid strategies and options, as well as the functionalities of hybrid dynamic molecular crystal materials and the important practical applications of composite materials, with the introduction of photomechanical molecular crystals and flexible molecular crystals as a starting point.&#160;Moreover, the efficiency, limitations, and advantages of different hybrid methods were compared and discussed.</dc:description>

         <title>Unraveling the Mechanism of Stereospecific Self&#8208;promoted N&#8208;Glycosylations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this study, the mechanism of selfpromoted
N&#8208;glycosylations is extensively investigated
through kinetic experiments, computational studies, and
nucleophilic competition experiments. Based on the findings,
the mechanism is proposed to be initiated by proton
transfer from the acidic sulfonyl carbamate to the
trichloroacetimidate, upon formation of an associated contact
ion pair. This ion pair then collapses in an SN1&#8208;like
fashion, with formation of an oxocarbeniumion&#8208;like intermediate.
According to the proposed mechanism, stereospecificity
arises from the associated nature of all intermediates
formed throughout the reaction. During the
mechanistic study, it was also found that the sulfonyl carbamates
have catalytic properties if a competing nucleophile
is present.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Self&#8208;assembly of &#945;&#8208;D nucleosides to supramolecular hydrogels is described in detail. Hydrogel formation was studied on &#945;&#8208;D 2'&#8208;deoxyguanosine (&#945;&#8208;dG), and the fluorescent 8&#8208;azapurine &#945;&#8208;D nucleosides 2&#8208;amino&#8208;8&#8208;aza&#8208;2&#8217;&#8208;deoxyadenosine (&#945;&#8208;2&#8208;NH2&#8208;z8Ad) and 8&#8208;aza&#8208;2&#8217;&#8208;deoxyisoguanosine (&#945;&#8208;z8iGd). These compounds were prepared from &#945;&#8208;D 8&#8208;aza&#8208;2&#8217;&#8208;deoxyguanosine by an activation/amination protocol followed by deamination. Protonation and deprotonation pKa values of monomeric nucleosides were determined. Fluorescence measurements displayed the pH&#8208;dependent fluorescence intensity of &#945;&#8208;D 8&#8208;azapurine nucleosides. &#945;&#8208;dG and &#945;&#8208;z8iGd self&#8208;assemble to gels that are selective for K+&#8208;ions. The &#945;&#8208;dG gel is transparent and the &#945;&#8208;z8iGd gel shows fluorescence. &#945;&#8208;2&#8208;NH2&#8208;z8Ad forms fluorescent gels in the presence of alkali metal ions of different size. SEM images exposed a large condensed and flat structure for the &#945;&#8208;dG gel, whereas the &#945;&#8208;2&#8208;NH2&#8208;z8Ad gel consists of flakes that are connected to bundles. A porous structure generated by helical cylindric fibers was found for the &#945;&#8208;z8iGd gel. All &#945;&#8208;D hydrogels showed long&#8208;term lifetime stability. The &#945;&#8208;z8iGd hydrogel in KCl solution has the highest Tgel value. The minimum gelation concentration of the hydrogels was 0.3&#8208;0.5 mg nucleoside/100 &#181;L alkali ion solution. In periodical step&#8208;strain experiments, the hydrogels of &#945;&#8208;dG and &#945;&#8208;2&#8208;NH2&#8208;z8Ad&#160;and&#160;&#945;&#8208;z8iGd&#160;displayed thixotropy.

         <title>Supramolecular Chiral Assembly of Dendritic Amphiphiles in Aqueous Media</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dendritic amphiphiles are a promising class of topological blocks for self&#8208;assembly to construct chiral supramolecular aggregates in aqueous media. Their unique dendritic geometry, structure variability and multivalence can mediate the assemblies with versatile morphologies and functions. The bulky dendritic moieties also enable the appropriate association&#8208;repulsion balance to control supramolecular growth, and simultaneously shield the assemblies with enhanced stabilities. Moreover, the crowded packing of dendritic segments facilitates the efficient chirality transfer from molecular level to supramolecular level, to achieve chirality amplification or enhancement. Dendritic moieties also provide chances to stabilize the assemblies in aqueous media through shielding and cooperative effects. The dendritic assemblies can be intriguingly made responsive to external stimuli including temperature, light, solvents or guests to switch their nanostructures or supramolecular chirality. Various dendritic amphiphiles bearing peptide or aromatic motifs have been reported in supramolecular chiral assembly, and their functional applications investigated. This review summarizes the significant progresses with a particular focus on the dendritic structural effects on supramolecular chiral assembly and the stimuli&#8208;responsiveness in aqueous media.</dc:description>

Despite some advancements, further exploration of the emerging field of planar hypercoordinate hydrogen chemistry is still necessary. Herein, we report a D4h symmetric H&#169;Li4Au4&#8722; cluster containing a planar tetracoordinate hydrogen (ptH) center. Both density functional theory (DFT) and ab initio calculations revealed that designed H&#169;Li4Au4&#8722; is a real global minimum. Meanwhile, it also possesses excellent dynamic stability. This stability is dominated by electrostatic interactions, and reinforced by multicenter covalent bonds rather than any aromaticity.

         <title>Ligand Engineering Toward Robust Sodium Storage in Self&#8208;Supported Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sodium&#8208;ion batteries capable of charging and discharging rapidly and durably are eagerly demanded to replace current lithium&#8208;ion batteries. However, large Na+ ions need more space to accommodate them. Metal&#8208;organic frameworks are promising anode materials, and their structure and performance are governed by organic ligands. Herein, we report a ligand engineering to design metal&#8208;organic frameworks with large conjugated naphthalene&#8208;2,6&#8208;dicarboxylic acid. Self&#8208;supported arrays of metal&#8208;organic frameworks reveal robust sodium storage when used as a binder&#8208;free anode. The uniquely long and conjugated aromatic ligands endow the metal&#8208;organic frameworks with rich sites to accommodate Na+ ions, thus enabling a high reversible capacity for sodium storage. As a result, such metal&#8208;organic frameworks exhibit a high capacity of 330 mAh g&#8722;1 at 1000 mA g&#8211;1 with remarkable rate capability and cycling performance. This work provides an exciting ligand strategy to design high&#8208;capacity metal&#8208;organic framework materials and would find extensive applications in various energy storage systems.</dc:description>

         <title>A Photolockable Polyaromatic Capsule Designed via Regiochemical Substitution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photocontrol over host frameworks is an elegant way to manipulate host&#8208;guest composites, yet the majority of previous systems suffer from long irradiation time and narrow guest scope, and are restricted to intramolecular photoreactions in organic solvents. Herein we present a photolockable polyaromatic capsule with improved guest binding abilities in water. The capsule assembles from bent amphiphiles featuring two 2&#8208;subsutituted anthracene panels, which shows high stability against dilution and undergoes intermolecular [4+4] photo&#8208;oligomerization upon short light irradiation (&lt;10 min). The photolocked capsule provides a roughly spherical framework, with an average, core diameter of ~3 nm, composed of amphiphilic oligomers (e.g., trimer). The new capsule shows improved host ability (up to 10&#8208;fold) in water toward various hydrophobic compounds (e.g., organic and metal&#8208;complex dyes), as compared with an analogous, non&#8208;photolockable capsule with 9&#8208;subsutituted anthracene panels. In addition, the resultant dye&#8208;loaded capsules are also successfully photolocked via short irradiation with high retention of the bound dyes.</dc:description>

         <title>Imaging Dihydrogen Bond&#8208;Driven Assembly of Borazine on Au(111)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dihydrogen bonding&#160;is a peculiar type of attractive interaction occurring between a partially positively charged hydrogen atom and a partially negatively charged hydrogen atom. Borazine represents a prototypical molecule exhibiting dihydrogen bonding in both gas phase, as well as in its crystalline form. For borazine assemblies on solid surfaces, a direct observation and characterization of dihydrogen bonding has remained elusive, possibly due to an intricate interplay of substrate&#8208;molecule and intermolecular interactions. Here we present evidence of dihydrogen bonding occurring in borazine assemblies on a Au(111) surface. By means of low&#8208;temperature scanning tunneling microscopy, we unveiled distinct configurations, exhibiting single and double dihydrogen bonding. Density functional theory calculations elucidate the interplay between substrate adsorption and intermolecular interactions to stabilize the formation of borazine dimers on Au(111), being the building blocks for the formation of larger assemblies.</dc:description>

         <title>Impact of Dihedral Angle in Conjugated Organic Cation on the Structures and Properties of Organic&#8208;Inorganic Lead Iodides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Conjugated organic cations are intriguing for organic&#8208;inorganic halide perovskites due to their direct participation in the optoelectronic properties of hybrid materials. In conjugated cations, the dihedral angle, or torsion angle, between adjacent aromatic rings is a critical secondary structural element. This angle influences not only the shape of the cations but also the overlap between the &#960;&#8208;orbitals on adjacent rings, thereby affecting their electronic properties. Understanding how variations in the dihedral angle impact the structure and properties of hybrid organic&#8208;inorganic metal halides (HOIMHs) is fundamentally important. In this study, we utilized 2,2'&#8208;dimethyl bipyridinium as the organic cation, reacting it with PbI&#8322; to form hybrid lead iodides. Remarkably, variations in the dihedral angle between the two pyridinium rings resulted in the formation of two distinct crystal structures with different band gaps. Our findings demonstrate that manipulating the dihedral angle offers a novel approach to controlling the structures and properties of hybrid metal halides with conjugated cations.</dc:description>

         <title>Isolation of a Staudinger&#8208;type Intermediate Utilizing a Five&#8208;membered Phosphorus&#8208;centered Biradicaloid</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The Staudinger reaction provides chemists with a valuable tool for the reduction of azides, which are notoriously unstable and can decompose explosively. By providing a controlled method for the conversion of azides to amines, the reaction opened up new avenues for the synthesis of various amine&#8208;containing compounds that are widely used in natural products, pharmaceuticals and polymers. The Staudinger reaction begins with the nucleophilic attack of a trivalent phosphine (usually triphenylphosphine), leading to the formation of a triazenide intermediate, a highly reactive species. Here we report how a divalent phosphorus&#8208;centered biradicaloid reacts with covalent azides and show that it is possible to capture and fully characterize the transient intermediate. The experimental data is supported by quantum chemical calculations of the reaction paths and in terms of thermodynamics and chemical bonding.</dc:description>

         <title>CoFe Hydroxide Nanospheres for Enhanced Alkaline Water Splitting and Seawater Oxidation:Anion Doping Effects of Fluorine and Carbonate</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The catalyst F&#8208;CoFe(OH)&#8208;CO3/NF with three&#8208;dimensional nanosphere structure, which promotes the exposure of active sites through an increase in specific surface area, thereby enhancing both mass and charge transfer pathways. Furthermore, partial oxidation of CoFe hydroxide to CoFe (oxy)hydroxide as the active center can accelerating the adsorption of oxygen&#8208;related intermediates, which improves the corrosion resistance of alkaline electrolyte and seawater.







Abstract
Green hydrogen production can be achieved through electrolysis of fresh water or the use of renewable energy to electrolyze seawater. However, due to the low activity and poor stability of oxygen evolution reaction catalysts, direct electrolysis of alkaline seawater faces significant challenges. Herein, The catalyst F&#8208;CoFe(OH)&#8208;CO3/NF with three&#8208;dimensional nanosphere structure was prepared, The introduction of CO32&#8722; into the intermediate layer of CoFe hydroxide improves the corrosion resistance of alkaline electrolyte and the doping of F&#8722; is to design three&#8208;dimensional layered nanostructures, increase the active site, and accelerate the diffusion of the electrolyte. By in&#8197;situ Raman analysis, partial oxidation of CoFe hydroxide to CoFe (oxy)hydroxide as the active center can accelerating the adsorption of oxygen&#8208;related intermediates. In 1&#8197;M KOH, it requires overpotentials of 210&#8197;mV and 251&#8197;mV to drive current densities of 10 and 100&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, respectively. And it remained stable at the current density of 100&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 for 120&#8197;h in 1&#8197;M KOH. F&#8208;CoFe(OH)&#8208;CO3/NF can also catalyzes the decomposition of electrolytic seawater. Compared with hydroxide, anion&#8208;doped carbonate hydroxide is more efficient and stable in electrolyte solution, which is of great importance for the development of a new stable electrocatalyst for water decomposition.

And it remained stable at the current density of 100&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; for 120&#8197;h in 1&#8197;M KOH. F-CoFe(OH)-CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;/NF can also catalyzes the decomposition of electrolytic seawater. Compared with hydroxide, anion-doped carbonate hydroxide is more efficient and stable in electrolyte solution, which is of great importance for the development of a new stable electrocatalyst for water decomposition.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>From Double&#8208;Stranded Helicates to Abiotic Double Helical Supramolecular Assemblies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Foldamers are synthetic oligomers that can spontaneously adopt compact, ordered, and stable folded conformations, due to the establishment of intramolecular non&#8208;covalent interactions. These secondary structures can also aggregate into complex supramolecular assemblies. These review focuses on the self&#8208;assembly of double helical structures based on intermolecular interactions between both complementary strands.







Abstract
The folding of oligomeric strands is the method that nature has selected to generate ordered assemblies presenting spectacular functions. In the purpose to mimic these biomacromolecules and extend their properties and functions, chemists make important efforts to prepare artificial secondary, tertiary, and even quarternary structures based on folded abiotic backbones. A large variety of oligomers and polymers, encoded with chemical informations, were designed, synthesized and characterized, and the establishment of non&#8208;covalent interactions lead to complex and functional supramolecular architectures resulting from a spontaneous self&#8208;assembly process. The association of complementary molecular strands into double helical structures is a common structural pattern of nucleic acids and proteins, so the synthesis of bio&#8208;inspired double helices has emerged as an important subject. In recent years, a number of synthetic oligomers have been reported to form stable double helices and it was shown that the equilibrium between single and double helices can be controlled via different stimuli like the modification of the solvent or the temperature. This kind of structure presents highly interesting functions, such as molecular recognition within the cavity of double helices, and some other potential applications will emerge in the future.

         <title>Sonodynamic Cancer Therapy by Mn(I)&#8208;tricarbonyl Complexes via Ultrasound&#8208;triggered CO Release and ROS Generation</title>

Sonochemistry and Sonobiology: A novel ferrocene appended Mn(I)&#8208;tricarbonyl complex was developed as a potent sonosensitizer and ultrasound&#8208;activable CO&#8208;releasing molecule for synergistic sonodynamic therapy and CO gas therapy. The complex&#8208;induced apoptosis in cancer cells via 1O2 and &#8901;OH radical generation and release of CO.







Abstract
A novel ferrocene conjugated Mn(I)&#8208;tricarbonyl complex viz [Mn(Fc&#8208;tpy)(CO)3Br] (Mn2) where, Fc&#8208;tpy=4&#8242;&#8208;ferrocenyl&#8208;2,2&#8242;:6&#8242;,2&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;terpyridine was synthesized and fully characterized along with its non&#8208;ferrocene analog [Mn(Ph&#8208;tpy)(CO)3Br] Ph&#8208;tpy=4&#8242;&#8208;phenyl&#8208;2,2&#8242;:6&#8242;,2&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;terpyridine (Mn1) for ultrasound (US) activated anticancer applications. The X&#8208;ray structure of Mn2 confirmed its distorted octahedral geometry. Mn1 and Mn2, for the first time, showed US&#8208;triggered release of CO and ROS generation (1O2 and &#8901;OH) in an aqueous solution from any Mn(I)&#8208;tricarbonyl complexes, indicating its potential for synergetic CO gas therapy and sonodynamic therapy. The above&#8208;mentioned in&#8208;solution chemistry was successfully translated into in&#8197;vitro cellular models. These complexes showed unprecedented US&#8208;triggered toxicity against T&#8208;cell lymphoma and human breast cancer cells (IC50 for Mn2&lt;1&#8197;&#956;M) while were minimally toxic without US or against normal spleen and human embryonic kidney cells. Mn2 was ca. 12 fold more anticancer active than Mn1, indicating that the ferrocene conjugation augmented the US sensitivity. The apoptotic sonotoxicity of Mn2 was due to US&#8208;promoted mitochondrial depolarization via ROS generation and CO release. The apoptosis was triggered by caspase 3 activation. This is the first report of Mn(I)&#8208;tricarbonyl&#8208;based sonosensitizers for cancer SDT. Overall, this study, for the first time, establishes the effectiveness of 3d metal carbonyls in SDT.

         <title>Towards Designer Photocatalysts: Structure&#8208;Property Relationships in 2,6&#8208;Diaryl&#8208;pyryliums</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Key design parameters and linear free&#8208;energy relationships were elucidated for 2,6&#8208;diarylpyrylium photocatalysts, allowing broad range control over both photophysical and electrochemical properties. Corrections to systematic errors in computational modeling of these systems were also developed.







Abstract
Fully organic photocatalyst systems are highly attractive, not merely because they are transition&#8208;metal free, but more importantly due to their unique and often potent reactivity. A detailed understanding of the various redox states, both ground and excited state, and specifically what structural parameters control them is therefore crucial for harnessing the full potential of these systems in organic synthesis. However, unlike their organometallic counterparts, detailed structure&#8208;property relationships for organic photocatalysts are largely absent from the literature. In this study, we demonstrate linear free&#8208;energy relationships across a range of key photophysical and electrochemical properties of 2,6&#8208;diarylpyryliums. Electronic absorption and emission maxima can be carefully tuned over the ranges of 83&#8197;nm and 102&#8197;nm respectively. Intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) interactions were revealed in cases of substitution with polarizable heavy&#8208;atoms. A strong linear dependence of ground state reduction potentials on substituent electronics was observed. Notably, the excited state reduction potential, E*red, could be controlled over a range of nearly 1000&#8197;mV. Systematic errors in computational modeling of ground and excited state redox potentials were identified and corrected. We believe the quantitative structure&#8208;property relationships identified here provide foundational tools for rational and predictive organic photocatalyst design.

         <title>Triflyl [18F]Fluoride as a Solution for Base&#8208;Sensitive Late&#8208;Stage Nucleophilic Aromatic 18F&#8208;Fluorination Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, we present the late&#8208;stage nucleophilic 18F&#8208;fluorination of (hetero)aryls under low&#8208;base conditions using triflyl [18F]fluoride. This method avoids the application of base and cryptand and enabled the efficient radiolabeling of a broad scope of (hetero)arenes and the successful production of clinical doses of [18F]mFBG, [18F]SynVesT&#8208;1 and [18F]FPEB in improved radiochemical yields (RCY) and/or shorter preparation times.







Abstract
Fluorine&#8208;18 is the predominant radionuclide used to label Positron Emission Tomography (PET) tracers. One outstanding challenge in nucleophilic aromatic radiofluorination reactions is the sensitivity of precursors and catalysts for basic reaction conditions, which are necessary for the work&#8208;up of [18F]fluoride, resulting in limited reproducibility. Triflyl [18F]fluoride is a new [18F]fluoride source that allows freedom in choice of type and amounts of base and cryptand. The aim of the current work is to explore the scope and limitations of triflyl [18F]fluoride in the late&#8208;stage nucleophilic aromatic 18F&#8208;fluorination of various functionalized precursors, exploring reduced amounts of base and cryptand. The assessment allowed for the application of this new nucleophilic [18F]fluoride reagent to the successful radiosynthesis of boron, stannane, hypervalent iodonium ylide and phenol substrates bearing electron&#8208;deficient, &#8208;neutral and &#8208;rich functional groups as well as the clinically relevant PET tracers [18F]FPEB, [18F]mFBG and [18F]SynVesT&#8208;1.

         <title>Flipping the Metalation of 4&#8208;Dimethylaminopyridine: Steric Repulsion versus London Dispersion Attraction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We demonstrate the effective utilization of steric interactions for flipping the lithiation of 4&#8208;dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP). Introduction of a Me3Si substituent to the position 1 of DMAP or simple complexation with t&#8208;BuLi allows selective C3&#8208;lithiation, due to the steric hindrance of a C2&#8722;H bond. The utilization of i&#8208;Pr3Si substituent leads to exclusive C2&#8208;functionalization due to the dispersion interactions with organometallic bases.







Abstract
Non&#8208;covalent interactions, including the coordination of an organolithium reagent by a directing group and the steric hindrance from substituents, play a crucial role in determining the selectivity of metalation reactions. Here, we demonstrate the effective utilization of steric interactions for flipping the lithiation of 4&#8208;dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP). Introduction of a Me3Si substituent to the position 1 of DMAP or simple complexation with t&#8208;BuLi allows selective C3&#8208;lithiation, due to the steric hindrance of a C2&#8722;H bond by the bulky moiety at the pyridine nitrogen. This simple approach creates a convenient way to achieve the selective C3&#8208;functionalization of DMAP. In contrast, the utilization of an even bulkier i&#8208;Pr3Si substituent leads to exclusive C2&#8208;functionalization due to the dispersion interactions with organometallic bases. For the first time, it is demonstrated that the i&#8208;Pr3Si moiety can serve as a directing group, providing a new type of directed ortho&#8208;metalation effect.

         <title>Steric Activation in the Nazarov Cyclization of Fully Substituted Divinyl Ketones</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Contrary to expectations, the Nazarov cyclization of fully substituted divinyl ketones bearing only electronically neutral (non&#8208;activating) substituents has been found to be extraordinarily facile. Indeed, increasing the size of R&#8208;groups, including those at the point of ring closure, can increase the cyclization rate. Steric interactions between R&#8208;groups and OA deflect the pentadienyl cation intermediate from planarity, thus raising its energy and reducing the barrier height to cyclization.







Abstract
Fully substituted divinyl ketones (fsDVKs) have long been regarded as resistant to Nazarov cyclization (NC) unless they contain strategically positioned electronically activating substituents. Here, however, we show that fsDVKs bearing only electronically neutral alkyl or aryl groups actually undergo facile NC due to steric crowding in the pentadienyl cation intermediate, which raises its energy and reduces the barrier height to cyclization. Strongly ionizing and suitably bulky acid moieties further increase the energy of this intermediate cation, favoring cyclization. These features enable NCs of fsDVKs to be employed in the ready construction of multiple contiguous all&#8208;carbon quaternary stereocenters under mild conditions, in the absence of electronically activating groups.

         <title>Intramolecular Pericyclic Re&#8208;hydroboration via Six&#8208;Membered Transition State: Synthesis of Fused Borolo[3,2&#8208;b]siloles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reaction of 1,4&#8208;pentadiynes with 9&#8208;BBN&#8722;H initially leads to 2,3&#8208;dihydrosiloles with BBN and propargyl groups at the endocyclic double bond, followed by closure of the borole ring forming borolo[3,2&#8208;b]siloles with high to moderate yields. The last step proceeds by a pericyclic mechanism via a six&#8208;membered transition state and is accompanied by an unprecedented dehydroboration of the 9&#8208;BBN unit.







Abstract
We experimentally demonstrate a new type of the intramolecular reaction between non&#8208;activated alkyne units and the dialkylboryl group (9&#8208;BBN), which was previously only hypothesized and studied on a calculational level. The reaction described here can formally be classified as a 1,2&#8208;hydroboration reaction, but, in contrast to the classical mechanism via a cyclic four&#8208;membered transition state, the reaction proceeds by a pericyclic mechanism involving a six&#8208;membered transition state. In practice, the reaction allows the synthesis of a new class of the borolenes fused with silole or dihydrosilole units. Thus, the heating (125&#8201;&#176;C) of 2,3&#8208;dihydrosiloles or 2,3&#8208;dihydrosilolo[2,3&#8208;b]silole bearing 9&#8208;BBN and propargyl or dimethylpropargyl groups in positions 4 and 5, respectively, affords, in high to moderate yields, di&#8208; and tricyclic compounds containing a borolo[3,2&#8208;b]silole unit. In all cases, the reactions are accompanied by an unprecedented dehydroboration of the 9&#8208;BBN fragment, leading, in the final products, to a cyclooct&#8208;4&#8208;enyl group on the boron atom. The effects of the substituents on the rate and the selectivity of the reaction are discussed. The structures of all the new compounds have been determined from HRMS together with multinuclear 1D and 2D NMR spectroscopy, the results of which are in excellent agreement with DFT calculated chemical shifts.

         <title>Regulating Solvated Sheath with Anion Chelant Enables 4.6&#8197;V Ultra&#8208;Stable Commercial LiCoO2</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We employ an electrolyte additive strategy to stabilize commercial LiCoO2 at high&#8208;voltage of 4.6&#8197;V. The anion&#8208;chelating agent (ACA) TPFPB promotes the F&#8208;rich CEI formation on LiCoO2, which endows Li/LCO half cells and 4&#8197;Ah Gr/LCO pouch cell with enhanced cycling stability under the high voltage condition.







Abstract
Increasing cut&#8208;off voltage of lithium cobalt oxide (LCO) (&gt;4.6&#8197;V) is an effective strategy to satisfy the ever&#8208;increasing demand for high energy density. However, the irreversible phase transition significantly destroys the structure of high&#8208;voltage LCO, especially the surface lattice. Considering that the structural stability of LCO is primarily dominated by the intrinsic merits of electrode&#8208;electrolyte interface (EEI), we explored and disclosed the operating mechanism of anion chelating agent tris(pentafluorophenyl) borane (TPFPB) and regulate the CEI layer on LCO electrode. Benefiting from the high HOMO energy level and preferential decomposition of TPFPB&#8208;PF6&#8722;, a robust LiF&#8208;rich CEI layer is constructed and greatly improves the stability of electrode/electrolyte interface. The well&#8208;designed electrolyte composed of 1&#8197;mol&#8201;L&#8722;1 LiPF6 in EC/EMC with TPFPB additives endows Li/LCO half cells and 4&#8197;Ah Gr/LCO pouch cell with enhanced cycling stability under a high voltage condition. This work provides pave a new direction for the development of economical high&#8208;voltage LIBs.

         <title>Quenching Rate Constants of Lewis Base&#8208;Boryl Radical by Substrates: a Laser Flash Photolysis Study</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reaction rate constants of a Lewis base&#8208;boryl radical, 4&#8208;dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP)&#8208;BH2&#8226;, with several methyl chlorobenzoates and chlorinated acetanilides are measured. Compared with the abstraction of the chlorine atom, the radical&#8208;addition to the carbonyl oxygen atom is more favorable as the rate&#8208;determining step in the whole reaction.







Abstract
The advanced strategy using Lewis base&#8208;boryl radicals (LBRs) has recently been proposed for the addition of alkyl substituents to the full&#8208;carbon quaternary center of an organic molecule. However, as the rate&#8208;determining step in the whole route, reaction rate constants of LBRs with substrates are extremely lacking. In this paper, 4&#8208;dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP)&#8208;BH2&#8901; was selected as a representative of LBRs, and its reactions with six monochloro&#8208;substituted substrates, including three methyl chlorobenzoates and three chlorinated acetanilides were studied in experiments and theoretical calculations. The bimolecular reaction rate constants, kq, were determined using laser flash photolysis approach. By comparing activation energies along the two addition pathways, we have clarified the rate&#8208;determining step as the attacking to carbonyl oxygen instead of chlorine atom. Furthermore, noncovalent interaction (NCI) analyses on these substrates indicate that weak interactions, such as hydrogen&#8208;bonding and van der Waals interactions, have significant influence on the reactivity of these substrates. Our study provides concrete clues to extend this synthetic strategy.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The advanced strategy using Lewis base-boryl radicals (LBRs&lt;b&gt;)&lt;/b&gt; has recently been proposed for the addition of alkyl substituents to the full-carbon quaternary center of an organic molecule. However, as the rate-determining step in the whole route, reaction rate constants of LBRs with substrates are extremely lacking. In this paper, 4-dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP)-BH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8901; was selected as a representative of LBRs, and its reactions with six monochloro-substituted substrates, including three methyl chlorobenzoates and three chlorinated acetanilides were studied in experiments and theoretical calculations. The bimolecular reaction rate constants, &lt;i&gt;k&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;q&lt;/sub&gt;, were determined using laser flash photolysis approach. By comparing activation energies along the two addition pathways, we have clarified the rate-determining step as the attacking to carbonyl oxygen instead of chlorine atom. Furthermore, noncovalent interaction (NCI) analyses on these substrates indicate that weak interactions, such as hydrogen-bonding and van der Waals interactions, have significant influence on the reactivity of these substrates. Our study provides concrete clues to extend this synthetic strategy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Construction of Luminescent Terpyridine&#8208;Based Metallo&#8208;Bowties with Alkyl Chain&#8208;Bridged Dimerized Building Blocks</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Luminescent terpyridine (TPY)&#8208;based metallo&#8208;bowties were constructed using a flexible alkyl chain to bridge TPY building blocks, offering a novel alternative to the conventional &lt;TPY&#8208;Ru&#8208;TPY&gt; linkage. The introduction of alkyl chain guides the self&#8208;assembly into well&#8208;defined metallo&#8208;bowties while simultaneously eliminating the quenching effects commonly associated with the &lt;TPY&#8208;Ru&#8208;TPY&gt; linkage. This approach provides a versatile platform for the design and construction of complex metallo&#8208;supramolecular architectures with desired optical properties.







Abstract
Numerous metallo&#8208;supramolecules with well&#8208;defined sizes and shapes have been successfully constructed via the strong coordination interaction between terpyridine (TPY) moieties and ruthenium cations. However, the pseudo&#8208;octahedral geometry of &lt;TPY&#8208;Ru&#8208;TPY&gt; unit hampers the luminescent properties of such metallo&#8208;architectures, thus limiting their applications as optical materials. To address this issue, we herein use a flexible alkyl chain to bridge TPY building blocks, replacing conventional &lt;TPY&#8208;Ru&#8208;TPY&gt; linkage. The introduction of alkyl chain guides the self&#8208;assembly into desired architecture while simultaneously eliminating the quenching effects typically associated with the &lt;TPY&#8208;Ru&#8208;TPY&gt; linkage. More importantly, this design strategy enables the precise construction of bowtie&#8208;shaped metallo&#8208;supramolecules with significantly enhanced emission. The incorporation of alkyl chain linkage not only maintains structural integrity but also enhances optical performance, making these metallo&#8208;supramolecular assemblies highly promising for applications in advanced photonic and luminescent materials. This study offers a versatile approach to construct complex metallo&#8208;supramolecular architectures with desired optical properties.

         <title>A Nanosized {NiII18} Cluster with a &#8216;Flying Saucer&#8217; Topology Exhibiting Slow Relaxation of Magnetisation Phenomena at Both 15&#8197;K and 1.3&#8197;K</title>

A high&#8208;nuclearity {Ni18} nanosized complex with an unprecedented &#8216;flying saucer&#8217; motif has been prepared from the organic chelate &#945;&#8208;methyl&#8208;2&#8208;pyridine&#8208;methanol (mpmH) in conjunction with bridging azido and peroxido groups. The {Ni18} compound behaves as single&#8208;molecule magnet and exhibits very rare two relaxation processes at 15 and 1.3&#8197;K.







Abstract
A high&#8208;nuclearity {Ni18} complex (1) with a unique &#8216;flying saucer&#8217; motif has been prepared from the organic chelate, &#945;&#8208;methyl&#8208;2&#8208;pyridine&#8208;methanol (mpmH), in conjunction with bridging azido (N3&#8722;) and peroxido (O22&#8722;) ligands. Magnetic susceptibility measurements revealed the presence of both ferro&#8208; and antiferromagnetic exchange interactions between the metal centres in 1, and the stabilization of spin states with appreciable S values at two different temperature regimes. The end&#8208;on bridging azido and alkoxido groups are in all likelihood the ferromagnetic mediators, while the &#951;3:&#951;3:&#956;6&#8208;bridging peroxides most likely promote the antiparallel alignment of the metals&#8217; spin vectors, yielding an overall non&#8208;zero spin ground state for the centrosymmetric compound 1. Furthermore, the {Ni18} nanosized cluster behaves as a single&#8208;molecule magnet, exhibiting magnetic hysteresis at low temperatures and two relaxation processes at 15&#8197;K and 1.3&#8197;K, a very rare phenomenon in polynuclear magnetic 3d&#8208;metal clusters.

         <title>Model Catalytic Studies on the Thermal Dehydrogenation of the Benzaldehyde/Cyclohexylmethanol LOHC System on Pt(111)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The dehydrogenation mechanism and thermal robustness of the liquid organic hydrogen carrier (LOHC) couple benzaldehyde/cyclohexylmethanol (H0&#8208;BA/H8&#8208;BA) are investigated in&#8197;situ on Pt(111) by synchrotron radiation&#8208;based photoelectron spectroscopy and temperature&#8208;programmed desorption. The results are compared with a previous study on the structurally related secondary alcohol 1&#8208;cyclohexylethanol, demonstrating the influence of the substitution degree of the alcohol group on the dehydrogenation characteristics of alcohol&#8208;functionalized LOHCs.







Abstract
We investigated the dehydrogenation reaction and the thermal robustness of the liquid organic hydrogen carrier (LOHC) couple benzaldehyde/cyclohexylmethanol on a Pt(111) model catalyst in&#8197;situ in synchrotron radiation photoelectron spectroscopy&#8208; and complementary temperature&#8208;programmed desorption experiments. The system stores hydrogen in a cyclohexyl group and a primary alcohol functionality and achieves an attractive hydrogen storage capacity of 7.0&#8197;mass&#8201;%. We observed a stepwise dehydrogenation mechanism, characterized by a low temperature dehydrogenation of the alcohol group at 235&#8197;K. However, stability limitations challenge the system's application as reversible hydrogen storage solution, as the resultant aldehyde was found to decompose during the dehydrogenation of its cyclohexyl group (between 250 and 350&#8197;K). A comparison of cyclohexylmethanol with the structurally related secondary alcohol (1&#8208;cyclohexylethanol; 6.3&#8197;mass&#8201;% hydrogen) revealed a parallel stepwise dehydrogenation pattern for both compounds, but a technically relevant superior thermal robustness of the latter, demonstrating the influence of the alcohol&#8208;group's substitution degree on the dehydrogenation characteristics of alcohol&#8208;functionalized LOHCs. Density functional theory calculations are in agreement with the experimentally observed stability trend.

         <title>Design Concepts of High&#8208;Entropy Materials for Zinc Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Zinc&#8208;ion batteries have emerged as strong candidates for replacing Li/Na&#8208;ion batteries owing to their high safety and environmental friendliness. However, the large electrostatic repulsion between the cathode and Zn2+, the irreversible growth of zinc dendrites at the anode, and the hydrogen precipitation side reaction in the aqueous electrolyte have hindered the practical application of zinc ion batteries. Fortunately, the emergence of the revolutionary concept of high entropy has provided new opportunities for the development of battery materials. High&#8208;entropy materials, with their unique atomic structures and uniform distribution of multiple elements, offer flexible options for material compositions and electronic structures, thus attracting significant attention in battery systems. In this concept article, we summarize the definitions and intrinsic structural characteristics of high&#8208;entropy materials and provide a detailed overview of the latest design concepts from the perspectives of cathodes, anodes, and electrolytes. Finally, we outline the challenges faced by high&#8208;entropy materials and potential solutions to guide researchers in developing efficient and stable zinc&#8208;ion batteries.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Low&#8208;dimensional hybrid metal halides (LDHMHs) have emerged as a highly promising class of functional materials for a wide range of optoelectronic applications. Their exceptional structural tunability, facilitated by the hybridization of metal halides with organic compounds, enables the formation of three&#8208;, two&#8208;, one&#8208;, or zero&#8208;dimensional structures. This flexibility in structural design also allows the incorporation of chirality into the crystalline lattice, giving rise to novel LDHMH materials that are capable of selectively interacting with the spin angular momentum of electrons and photons. Among the unique optoelectronic properties of LDHMHs, the focus of this concept article is their chiroptical nonlinear optical (NLO) effect. LDHMHs demonstrate a highly effective discrimination and generation of circularly polarized (CP) light in the NLO regime, particularly in the second harmonic generation (SHG) process, referred to as SHG&#8208;circular dichroism (SHG&#8208;CD) and CP&#8208;SHG. These anisotropic responses are several orders of magnitude larger than linear chiroptical responses, such as CD and CP luminescence; consequently, LDHMHs are expected to be promising candidates for future optical&#8208;information devices and encryption systems. This article introduces recently reported chiral LDHMH materials that exhibit excellent CP&#8208;dependent anisotropic SHG responses.</dc:description>

         <title>Confinement Effects of Coordination Cages on the Synthesis and Application of Polyoxometalates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The confinement effects within coordination cages present powerful tools in modern chemistry, particularly for the synthesis and manipulation of complex molecules. This concept article reviews the use of coordination cages to stabilize and tune the properties of polyoxometalates (POMs), a class of nano&#8208;sized metallic clusters, expanding the focus beyond traditional organic reactions. The article provides a brief overview of coordination cages, and POM chemistry and discusses the encapsulation of POMs in coordination cages, highlighting how these cages provide a confinement effect that enhances the stability and reactivity of POMs. Additionally, the concept of cavity&#8208;directed synthesis is explored as a method for creating labile POMs, which are often unstable in aqueous conditions, underlining its implications for supramolecular catalysis. Future research will focus on expanding the structures and applications of encapsulated POMs, as well as improving cage designs to unlock new cluster architectures.</dc:description>

         <title>Intermolecular Forces&#8208;oriented Growth of MOF&#8208;on&#8208;MOF Heterostructures</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Well&#8208;controlled conjugation of distinct metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) with dissimilar components and structures into a multi&#8208;component MOF system is important for the design of myriad materials with structural complexity, integrated properties, and desired applications. Herein, we developed an interesting integration strategy that relies on intermolecular force, and which can overcome the difference in lattice parameters. The strategy uses the pre&#8208;formed MOF matrixes as seeds to direct the self&#8208;assembly of secondary MOF particles for the construction of hybrid MOFs. As a proof of concept, the representative core&#8208;satellite&#8208;type Ni&#8208;MOF@ZIF&#8208;8 and core&#8208;shell&#8208;type MOF&#8208;74@ZIF&#8208;8 heterostructures were achieved. Theory calculations elucidate the uncommon formation of well&#8208;defined hybrid MOFs by self&#8208;assembly of secondary ZIF&#8208;8 particles to anchor on Ni&#8208;MOF or MOF&#8208;74 seed surface via hydrogen bonds and van der Waals interactions. We anticipate that this work opens an avenue to design the multi&#8208;component MOF systems from different MOFs with lattice mismatching.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthesis of unprecedented triskelion&#8208;shaped hexa&#8208;peri&#8208;hexabenzocoronenes with C3, C3h or D3h symmertry is reported. We present a new, five step synthetic access to tris&#8208;iodinated HBC derivatives carrying different solubilizing moieties (tert&#8208;butyl and mesityl), which serve as suitable building blocks for further functionalization. These molecules can undergo Sonogashira cross coupling reactions to obtain a series of seven ethynyl tris&#8208;substituted HBCs. The coupling partners range from carbon&#8208;based aromatic scaffolds (tBu&#8208;benzene, naphthalene, phenanthrene) to ligands for metal complexes (bipyridine, phenanthroline, terpyridine, acetylacetone). The optoelectronic properties were investigated by UV/vis absorption spectroscopy resulting in a significant batho&#8208;chromic shift of the absorption maximum compared to the iodinated starting material. Semiempirical calculations were used to determine the conformation and symmetry of the compounds.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>
This concept review summarizes signal amplification strategies including DNAzyme catalytic reaction, hybrid chain reaction (HCR), catalytic hairpin assembly (CHA) to enhance detection signal of lowly expressed miRNAs; external stimuli and internal stimuli to prevent nonspecific activation; and the development of NIR&#8208;II fluorescent probes for in&#8197;vivo miRNA imaging and indicated current challenges for in&#8197;vivo miRNA imaging.







Abstract
As a post transcriptional regulator of gene expression, microRNAs (miRNA) is closely related to many major human diseases, especially cancer. Therefore, its precise detection is very important for disease diagnosis and treatment. With the advancement of fluorescent dye and imaging technology, the focus has shifted from in&#8197;vitro miRNA detection to in&#8197;vivo miRNA imaging. This concept review summarizes signal amplification strategies including DNAzyme catalytic reaction, hybrid chain reaction (HCR), catalytic hairpin assembly (CHA) to enhance detection signal of lowly expressed miRNAs; external stimuli of ultraviolet (UV) light or near&#8208;infrared region (NIR) light, and internal stimuli such as adenosine triphosphate (ATP), glutathione (GSH), protease and cell membrane protein to prevent nonspecific activation for the avoidance of false positive signal; and the development of fluorescent probes with emission in NIR for in&#8197;vivo miRNA imaging; as well as rare earth nanoparticle based the second near&#8208;infrared window (NIR&#8208;II) nanoprobes with excellent tissue penetration and depth for in&#8197;vivo miRNA imaging. The concept review also indicated current challenges for in&#8197;vivo miRNA imaging including the dynamic monitoring of miRNA expression change and simultaneous in&#8197;vivo imaging of multiple miRNAs.

         <title>Achieving Regioselectivity for Remote C&#8722;H Activation by Substructure Conformations: an Approach of Paralogous Cytochrome P450 Enzymes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 66, November 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Controlling regioselectivity in C&#8722;H activation is challenging, particularly for complex substrates. Cytochrome P450 monooxygenases (CYPs) offer a solution by modulating distance and geometry between the reaction center and target site. Comparative studies on homologous CYPs, such as IkaD and CftA, reveal that distinct substructure conformations can influence regioselectivity and have implications for CYP engineering.







Abstract
For advanced synthetic intermediates or natural products with multiple unactivated and energetically similar C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds, controlling regioselectivity for the C&#8722;H activation is particularly challenging. The use of cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYPs) is a promising solution to the &#8216;regioelectivity&#8217; challenge in remote C&#8722;H activation. Notably, CYPs and organic catalysts share a fundamental principle: they strive to control the distance and geometry between the metal reaction center and the target C&#8722;H site. Most structural analyses of the regioselectivity of CYPs are limited to the active pocket, particularly when explaining why regioselectivity could be altered by enzyme engineering through mutagenesis. However, the substructures responsible for forming the active pocket in CYPs are well known to display complex dynamic changes and substrate&#8208;induced plasticity. In this context, we highlight a comparative study of the recently reported paralogous CYPs, IkaD and CftA, which achieve different regioselectivity towards the same substrate ikarugamycin by distinct substructure conformations. We propose that substructural conformation&#8208;controlled regioselectivity might also be present in CYPs of other natural product biosynthesis pathways, which should be considered when engineering CYPs for regioselective modifications.

Noncovalent interactions (NCIs) are the driving forces for the formation and stability of host&#8208;guest complexes that ubiquitously exist in fields as diverse of biology, chemistry, materials sciences, pharmaceuticals, and environmental ion separations. Now the absolute interaction strength of NCIs can be directly and precisely measured by gas&#8208;phase electrospray ionization negative ion photoelectron spectroscopy.







Abstract
Noncovalent interactions (NCIs) are crucial for the formation and stability of host&#8208;guest complexes, which have wide&#8208;ranging implications across various fields, including biology, chemistry, materials science, pharmaceuticals, and environmental science. However, since NCIs are relatively weak and sensitive to bulk perturbation, direct and accurate measurement of their absolute strength has always been a significant challenge. This concept article aims to demonstrate the gas&#8208;phase electrospray ionization (ESI)&#8208;negative ion photoelectron spectroscopy (NIPES) as a direct and precise technique to measure the absolute interaction strength, probe nature of NCIs, and reveal the electronic structural information for host&#8208;guest complexes. Our recent studies in investigating various host&#8208;guest complexes that involve various types of NCIs such as anion&#8211;&#960;, (di)hydrogen bonding, charge&#8208;separated ionic interactions, are overviewed. Finally, a summary and outlook are provided for this field.

         <title>Uncovering the Potent Antiviral Activity of the Sesterterpenoids from the Sponge Ircinia Felix Against Human Adenoviruses: from the Natural Source to the Total Synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 66, November 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Isolation, structure elucidation, biological activity, and total synthesis of ircinialactam J, a novel sesterterpene lactam produced by the sponge Ircinia felix, is presented. Ircinialactam J displays a significant antiviral activity against Human Adenoviruses (11 times more active than cidofovir&#174;) without cytotoxicity. This work reports the first synthesis of a lactamic sesterterpene.







Abstract
Human Adenovirus (HAdV) infections in immunocompromised patients can result in disseminated diseases with high morbidity and mortality rates due to the absence of available treatments for these infections. The sponge Ircinia felix was selected for the significant anti&#8208;HAdV activity displayed by its organic extracts. Its chemical analysis yielded three novel sesterterpene lactams, ircinialactams J&#8722;L, along with three known sesterterpene furans which structures were established by a deep spectrometric analysis. Ircinialactam J displayed significant antiviral activity against HAdV without significant cytotoxicity, showing an effectiveness 11 times greater than that of the standard treatment, cidofovir&#174;. Comparison of the antiviral evaluation results of the isolated compounds allowed us to deduce some structure&#8208;activity relationships. Mechanistic assays suggest that ircinialactam J targets an early step of the HAdV replicative cycle before HAdV genome reaches the nucleus of the host cell. The first total synthesis of ircinialactam J was also accomplished to prove the structure and to provide access to analogues. Key steps are a regio&#8208; and stereoselective construction of the trisubstituted Z&#8208;olefin at &#916;7 by iron&#8208;catalyzed carbometallation of a homopropargylic alcohol, a stereoselective methylation to generate the stereogenic center at C18, and the formation of the (Z)&#8208;&#916;20 by stereoselective aldol condensation to introduce the tetronic acid unit. Ircinialactam J is a promising chemical lead to new potent antiviral drugs against HAdV infections.

         <title>Diels&#8208;Alder Reaction Mechanisms of La@C60 and Gd@C60 Studied Using Density Functional Theory</title>

         <dc:description>
Improving the understanding of fullerene reactivity through calculation. DFT calculations reproduce and rationalize the behaviour of endohedral fullerenes containing lanthanum of gadolinium centers, either in cationic or neutral form, towards Diels&#8208;Alder reactions. These results can be extrapolated to the reactivity of other endohedral fullerenes with other dienes.







Abstract
Encapsulation of transition metals represents a crucial method for modifying the electronic structure and regulating the reactivity of fullerene, thereby expanding its applications. Herein, we present calculations with density functional theory methods to investigate the mechanisms of the Diels&#8208;Alder (DA) reactions of cyclopentadiene and La@C60 or Gd@C60 as well as their tricationic derivatives. Our findings indicate that the encapsulation of La and Gd into the C60 cage is thermodynamically favorable. The DA reactions are favored by the presence of La and Gd, with lower barriers, though the regioselectivity, favoring 6&#8722;6 bonds in the fullerene, is not affected. The effect of external electric fields has been also considered.

         <title>Urea Ligand&#8208;Promoted Chainwalking Heteroannulation for the Synthesis of 6&#8208; and 7&#8208;membered Azaheterocycles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 66, November 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Urea ligands promote chainwalking heteroannulation reactions for the synthesis of 6&#8208; and 7&#8208;membered azaheterocycles from a common set of precursors. In this reaction, ureas outperform established ligands for Pd&#8208;catalyzed chainwalking processes, particularly for more challenging substrates such as 1,5&#8208;dienes.







Abstract
Typical approaches to heterocycle construction require significant changes in synthetic strategy even for a change as minor as increasing the ring size. The ability to access multiple heterocyclic scaffolds through a common synthetic approach, simply through trivial modification of one reaction component, would enable facile access to diverse libraries of structural analogues of core scaffolds. Here, we show that urea&#8208;derived ligands effectively promote Pd&#8208;mediated chainwalking processes to enable remote heteroannulation for the rapid construction of six&#8208; and seven&#8208;membered azaheterocycles under essentially identical reaction conditions. This method demonstrates good functional group tolerance and effectively engages sterically hindered substrates. In addition, this reaction is applicable to target&#8208;oriented synthesis, demonstrated through the formal synthesis of antimalarial alkaloid galipinine.

         <title>What is the Origin of the Regioselective C3&#8208;Hydroxylation of L&#8208;Arg by the Nonheme Iron Enzyme Capreomycin C?</title>

A computational study on the nonheme iron dioxygenase CmnC highlights the origin of the regioselectivity of L&#8208;Arg hydroxylation step as the result of substrate binding and positioning by polar residues in the substrate binding pocket.







Abstract
The nonheme iron dioxygenase capreomycin C (CmnC) hydroxylates a free L&#8208;arginine amino acid regio&#8208; and stereospecifically at the C3&#8208;position as part of the capreomycin antibiotics biosynthesis. Little is known on its structure, catalytic cycle and substrate specificity and, therefore, a comprehensive computational study was performed. A large QM cluster model of CmnC was created of 297 atoms and the mechanisms for C3&#8722;H, C4&#8722;H and C5&#8722;H hydroxylation and C3&#8722;C4 desaturation were investigated. All low&#8208;energy pathways correspond to radical reaction mechanisms with an initial hydrogen atom abstraction followed by OH rebound to form alcohol product complexes. The work is compared to alternative L&#8208;Arg hydroxylating nonheme iron dioxygenases and the differences in active site polarity are compared. We show that a tight hydrogen bonding network in the substrate binding pocket positions the substrate in an ideal orientation for C3&#8722;H activation, whereby the polar groups in the substrate binding pocket induce an electric field effect that guides the selectivity.

A large QM cluster model of CmnC was created of 297 atoms and the mechanisms for C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&#8722;H, C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&#8722;H and C&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;&#8722;H hydroxylation and C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&#8722;C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; desaturation were investigated. All low-energy pathways correspond to radical reaction mechanisms with an initial hydrogen atom abstraction followed by OH rebound to form alcohol product complexes. The work is compared to alternative L-Arg hydroxylating nonheme iron dioxygenases and the differences in active site polarity are compared. We show that a tight hydrogen bonding network in the substrate binding pocket positions the substrate in an ideal orientation for C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&#8722;H activation, whereby the polar groups in the substrate binding pocket induce an electric field effect that guides the selectivity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Orthogonal Geometry Enhancing the Intersystem Crossing and Photosensitive Efficiency of Spiro Organoboron Compounds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 66, November 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
DFT and TD&#8208;DFT calculations are conducted to investigate the potential photosensitivity of spiro organoboron compounds. Geometric analysis reveals that the configuration of S1 determines the molecular ISC rate constants, and PSs with a (N, N) acceptor exhibit higher theoretical sensitization efficiency than those with a (N, O) acceptor, which is contributed by the donor&#8208;acceptor orthogonal feature.







Abstract
Based on the reported spiro organoboron compounds (PS1 and PS2 as potent 1O2 sensitizers), several new organoboron molecules (PS4&#8211;PS9) were constructed through structural modification, and their low&#8208;lying excited states and photophysical properties have been explored by density functional theory (DFT) and time&#8208;dependent DFT (TD&#8208;DFT) calculations. The predicted effective intersystem crossing (ISC) processes arise from the S1&#8594;T2 transition for PS4&#8211;PS6 and the S1&#8594;T4 transition for PS1, and corresponding KISC rate constants reach the order of magnitude of 109 (s&#8722;1). The organoboron compounds with a (N, N) chelate acceptor are predicted to exhibit relatively higher ISC efficiency than those bearing a (N, O) acceptor, and the planar C3NBN ring and the orthogonal configuration between the donor and acceptor moieties are responsible for the ISC rate enhancement. Importantly, the geometric features of the lowest singlet excited state (S1) for these compounds play a decisive role in their photosensitive efficiency. The present results provide a basis for better understanding of the photosensitivity of these spiro organoboron compounds and the structural modification effect.

         <title>Access to Diverse Carbonyl Compounds by Catalyst&#8208;Free and Photoinduced Aerobic Cleavage of C=N Bonds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 66, November 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A catalyst&#8208;free and photoinduced aerobic cleavage of C=N bonds has been developed using oxygen from air as green oxidant. This strategy features broad substrate scope and a series of carbonyl compounds including ketones, aldehydes, carboxylic acids and relative drug analogues were obtained. Moreover, the easy&#8208;operation and gram&#8208;scale synthesis indicates the practicality of this method.







Abstract
Functional group interconversion is of great significance in organic synthesis. However, aerobic cleavage of C=N bonds to access carbonyl compounds still suffered from some limitations such as harsh reaction conditions, stoichiometric oxidants, poor substrate scope and use of toxic reagents. Herein, we report a catalyst&#8208;free and photo&#8208;induced aerobic cleavage of C=N bonds to afford diverse carbonyl compounds using oxygen from air as green oxidant. This mild methodology permits N&#8208;tosylhydrazones converted into the corresponding carbonyl compounds including ketones, aldehydes and carboxylic acids, showing broad functional group tolerance and compatibility. Moreover, the gram&#8208;scale reaction and post&#8208;modification of complicated molecules proved the applicability and efficiency of this strategy. Finally, a plausible mechanism was proposed based on spectroscopic investigations and detailed mechanistic studies.

         <title>&#945;&#8208;Bi2Mo3O12: A Dual&#8208;Functional Material for Electrocatalytic Water Splitting and Supercapacitor Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 66, November 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study examines &#945;&#8208;Bi2Mo3O12 (BMO) in different forms as a dual&#8208;functional material for water splitting and supercapacitor applications. BMO (AC) and BMO (BC) show superior electrocatalytic activity, while BMO (BE) excels in supercapacitors.







Abstract
This study explores the functionality of &#945;&#8208;Bi2Mo3O12 (BMO) as an electrocatalyst for water splitting and its suitability for supercapacitor applications. BMO was synthesized by the solvothermal method and characterized in pre&#8208;calcination [BMO (BC)], post&#8208;calcination [BMO (AC)], and base&#8208;etched forms [BMO (BE)]. Structural analysis confirmed the formation of &#945;&#8208;Bi2Mo3O12 with well&#8208;defined crystallographic planes. Electrochemical analysis revealed that BMO (AC) exhibited the lowest overpotential for hydrogen evolution reactions (HER) and BMO (BC) exhibited the lowest overpotential for oxygen evolution reactions (OER), indicating its superior electrocatalytic activity. The Tafel slope and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy results confirmed the superior kinetics and charge transfer properties of BMO material. Furthermore, BMO samples demonstrated excellent stability during prolonged chronoamperometry (CA) testing for 12&#8197;h. For supercapacitor performances, the BMO (BE) exhibits a superior specific capacitance value of 398&#8197;F/g at 2.0&#8197;A/g. Thus, the BMO material delivers prominent electrocatalytic activity as well as supercapacitor performance. Overall, this study demonstrates the potentiality of &#945;&#8208;Bi2Mo3O12 in different forms as a dual&#8208;functional material for efficient energy storage and conversion.

         <title>Room&#8208;Temperature Quantum Coherence of Reversible Photo&#8208;Generated Radical and its Film</title>

The reversible photogenerated radicals 2,4,6&#8208;Tri(4&#8208;pyridyl)&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triazine (tpt) show a temperature&#8208;independent quantum coherence with Tm=1.1&#8197;&#956;s at 20&#8211;300&#8197;K and the Tm of tpt&#8208;film increased by two times at low temperature.







Abstract
Electron spin qubits are becoming an important research direction in the field of quantum computing and information storage. However, the quantum decoherence has seriously hindered the development of this field. So far, few qubits exhibit long phase memory time (Tm), and even fewer qubits that can reach room temperature. Some reports show that the coherence times of radicals are generally long, so radicals may be the preferred spin carriers for qubits. Here, we demonstrate the qubit properties of a photogenerated radical (1&#8201;a) based on 2,4,6&#8208;Tri(4&#8208;pyridyl)&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triazine (tpt, 1). More importantly, the photogenerated radical is a spin self&#8208;diluting complex, which the dilution is generally used in the investigation of qubits to reduce the interference of environment on qubits in order to overcome the decoherence of qubits. It is surprised that radical tpt has a stable Tm=1.1&#8197;&#956;s above 20&#8197;K, even keep it to room temperature. In addition, the tpt&#8208;film prepared by the vacuum evaporation is significantly increase the T1 and Tm at low temperature.

         <title>Photoinduced Deoxygenative C2 Arylation of Quinoline N&#8208;oxides with Phenylhydrazines to 2&#8208;Arylquinolines over Porous Tubular Graphitic Carbon Nitride Semiconductor Photocatalyst</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 66, November 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
By using porous tubular graphitic carbon nitride (PTCN) as recyclable heterogeneous catalyst and arylhydrazines as cheap and commercially available arylation reagent, a novel photoinduced deoxygenative C2 arylation of quinoline N&#8208;oxides to 2&#8208;arylquinolines was developed successfully.







Abstract
The photo&#8208;induced deoxygenative C2 arylation of quinoline N&#8208;oxides to 2&#8208;arylquinolines is achieved over a heterogeneous porous tubular graphitic carbon nitride (PTCN) catalyst with phenylhydrazines as arylation reagent. A wide range of quinoline N&#8208;oxides can be efficiently transformed into their corresponding 2&#8208;arylquinolines under visible light irradiation. Moreover, PTCN catalyst is easily separated and could be reused several times without loss to its original activity.

         <title>Electrodeposition and Optimisation of Amorphous NixSy Catalyst for Hydrogen Evolution Reaction in Alkaline Environment</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 66, November 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study reports the optimisation of nickel sulfide&#8208;based catalyst prepared via electrodeposition process. Thiourea concentration and current density for deposition are the most influential factors. The optimised NixSy catalyst shows excellent performance in an anion exchange membrane water electrolyser, achieving 500&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at a cell voltage of 1.88&#8197;V under 333&#8197;K in 1&#8197;M KOH.







Abstract
Anion exchange membrane (AEM) water electrolysers have shown their potential in green hydrogen production. One of the crucial tasks is to discover novel cost&#8208;effective and sustainable electrocatalyst materials. In this study, a low&#8208;cost Ni&#8722;S&#8208;based catalyst for hydrogen evolution reaction was prepared via a simple electrodeposition process from a modified Watts bath recipe. Physical characterisation methods suggest this deposit film to be amorphous. Optimisation of the electrodeposition parameters of the NixSy catalyst was carried out using a rotating disk electrode setup. The optimised catalyst exhibited excellent catalytical performance in 1&#8197;M KOH on a microelectrode, with overpotentials of 41&#8197;mV, 111&#8197;mV and 202&#8197;mV at 10, 100 and 1000&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 with Tafel slope of 67.9&#8197;mV&#8201;dec&#8722;1 recorded at 333&#8197;K. Long&#8208;term testing of the catalyst demonstrated steady performance over a 24&#8197;h period on microelectrode at 100&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 with only 71&#8197;mV and 37&#8197;mV overpotential increase at 293&#8197;K and 333&#8197;K respectively. Full cell testing with the optimised NixSy as cathode and NiFe(OH)2 as anode showed 1.88&#8197;V after 1&#8197;h electrolysis at 500&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in 1&#8197;M KOH under 333&#8197;K with FAA&#8208;3&#8208;30 membrane.

         <title>Migration of para&#8208;Nitrophenyl Groups in Methyl Pyranosides: Configuration and Conformation Determine the Kinetics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 66, November 26, 2024. </description>

Surprising complexity. O&#8208;Aryl migration in carbohydrates under basic Zempl&#233;n conditions (NaOMe in MeOH) was investigated employing a library of para&#8208;nitrophenyl&#8208;substituted methyl pyranosides. Rate constants and activation energies as obtained from extensive NMR measurements revealed clear migration trends, which could be related to configurational and conformational characteristics. Theoretical chemistry shows the complexity of this seemingly simple reaction.







Abstract
para&#8208;Nitrophenyl (PNP) ethers of glycosides are important building blocks en route to functional carbohydrates. They are stable in neutral media, however, under basic conditions such as during the Zempl&#233;n deacylation of sugars, aryl migration is frequently observed. We have employed a library of O&#8208;PNP&#8208;substituted methyl glycosides of the manno&#8208;, galacto&#8208;, gluco&#8208; and altro&#8208;series to study the kinetics of aryl migration in MeOH/sodium methoxide using NMR spectroscopy revealing that migration between cis&#8208;oriented OH groups is faster than between trans&#8208;oriented ones. The rate constants of migration decrease in the order of Alt&gt;Man&gt;Gal&gt;Glc and are related to the energy barriers of chair conformation inversion. The energy profile of the 3 to 4&#8208;PNP migration in methyl mannoside was calculated using DFT methods suggesting the Meisenheimer complex is an intermediate of PNP migration and that coordination of the sodium cation has a major impact on the energy profile.

         <title>Luminescence Changeable CO2&#8208;Storage Cylinder: Triple&#8208;Stranded Helical Eu(III)/Tb(III) Fluorinated MOFs with Amide Linkers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 66, November 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel lanthanide MOFs with CO2 gas adsorption are demonstrated. The MOFs constructed a cylindrical structure. The inner channel of the cylindrical structure was covered with fluorine atoms. The fluorine atoms enhance interaction with CO2 gas molecules. Eu/Tb&#8208;mixed MOFs exhibited the change of ratiometric emission intensity between Eu and Tb by CO2 gas adsorption behavior.







Abstract
Triple&#8208;stranded helical lanthanide MOFs with CO2 adsorption properties were investigated. Lanthanide MOFs ([Eu0.1Tb0.9(hfa)3(dpa)]n) are composed of lanthanide luminophores (Eu(III) and/or Tb(III) ions), fluorinated antenna ligands (hfa: hexafluoroacetylacetonate), and polyamide&#8208;type linker ligands (dpa: 4&#8208;(diphenylphosphoryl)&#8208;N&#8208;(4&#8208;(diphenylphosphoryl)phenyl)benzamide). The cylindrical structure was characterized by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray analysis, thermogravimetric analysis, and gas adsorption measurements. The inner surfaces of the cylindrical channels were covered with the fluorine atoms of the hfa ligands. The emission intensity ratio (IEu/ITb) in [Eu0.1Tb0.9(hfa)3(dpa)]n is affected by the CO2 gas adsorption behavior. The change in IEu/ITb value was caused by the intermolecular interactions between the CO2 gas molecules and the fluorinated ligands, resulting in an electronic structural change of the lowest triplet excited state in the photosensitized hfa ligands.

         <title>Aromaticity in Isoelectronic Analogues of Benzene, Carborazine and Borazine, from Electronic Structure and Magnetic Property</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 66, November 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electronic structures and magnetic properties of carborazine and borazine were theoretically studied and compared with those of benzene. It was confirmed that carborazine is evidently aromatic, while borazine only exhibits rather weak aromaticity. The C atom between B and N atoms in carborazine behaves as a conjugated bridge, which is the essence of the distinctly different aromaticity between the isoelectronic analogues of benzene.







Abstract
Carborazine (B2C2N2H6) and borazine (B3N3H6) are isoelectronic analogues of benzene (C6H6). The aromatic character of borazine have basically reached a consensus after a long period of controversy, but the related properties of carborazine are even rarely reported. In this work, we systematically investigated the geometric structure, charge distribution, frontier molecular orbital characteristics, bonding, electronic delocalization, magnetic shielding effect, and induced ring current of carborazine and borazine, and compared the studied characteristics with those of benzene to determine the aromatic character of the two analogues. The combination of multiple properties shows that although they are isoelectronic, carborazine is evidently aromatic, while borazine only exhibits rather weak aromaticity. The C atom acting as a connecting bridge between B and N atoms in carborazine reduces the electronegativity difference on the molecular backbone and enhances the electronic delocalization over the conjugated path, which is the essence of the distinct disparity of aromaticity between carborazine and borazine.

         <title>Constructing Cyclic Hydrogen Bonding to Suppress Side Reactions and Dendrite Formation on Zinc Anodes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 66, November 26, 2024. </description>

N&#8208;hydroxymethylacetamide additives in 2&#8197;M ZnSO4 electrolytes disrupt water molecule networks, inhibiting dendrite growth and improving zinc anode stability, while guiding uniform zinc deposition, significantly enhancing battery cycle life and Coulombic efficiency. This work underscores the potential of electrolyte additives to address critical limitations in zinc metal batteries.







Abstract
The high electrochemical reactivity of H2O molecules and zinc metal results in severe side reactions and dendrite formation on zinc anodes. Here we demonstrate that these issues can be addressed by using N&#8208;hydroxymethylacetamide (NHA) as additives in 2&#8197;M ZnSO4 electrolytes. The addition of NHA molecules, acting as both a hydrogen bond donor and acceptor, enables the formation of cyclic hydrogen bonding with H2O molecules. This interaction disrupts the existing hydrogen bonding networks between H2O molecules, hindering proton transport, and containing H2O molecules within the cyclic hydrogen bonding structure to prevent deprotonation. Additionally, NHA molecules show a preference for adsorption on the (101) crystal surface of zinc metal. This preferential adsorption reduces the surface energy of the (101) plane, facilitating the homogeneous Zn deposition along the (101) direction. Thus, the NHA enables Zn||Zn symmetric cell with a cycle lifespan of 1100&#8197;hours at 5&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and Zn||Cu asymmetric cell with a high Coulombic efficiency over 99.5&#8201;%. Moreover, the NHA&#8208;modified Zn||AC zinc ion hybrid capacitor is capable of sustaining 15000 cycles at 2&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1. This electrolyte additive engineering presents a promising strategy to enhance the performance and broaden the application potential of zinc metal&#8208;based energy storage devices.

         <title>Regulating the Topologies and Photoresponsive Properties of Lanthanum&#8208;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 66, November 26, 2024. </description>

Two lanthanum&#8208;organic frameworks with dinuclear lanthanum as building blocks and distinct bipyridinedicarboxylate as likers are prepared. Their structural differences result in the diversities of photoresponsive functionalities in terms of photochromism, photomodulated fluorescence and proton conductivity.







Abstract
Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) show potential application in many domains, in which photochromic MOFs (PMOFs) have received enormous attention. Researchers mainly utilize photoactive ligands to build PMOFs. Recently, the mixed electron donating and accepting ligands strategies have also been used to construct PMOFs driven by the electron transfer between nonphotochromic moieties. However, the potential interligand competition inhibits the formation of PMOFs. Therefore, the exploration of single&#8208;ligand&#8208;guided assembly is conductive for building PMOFs. Considering the existing electron accepting and donating role of pyridyl and carboxyl, the pyridinecarboxyate derived from the fusion of pyridyl and carboxyl units may serve as single ligand to yield PMOFs (Figure&#8197;1d). In this work, the coordination assembly of bipyridinedicarboxylate (2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine&#8208;4,4&#8242;&#8208;dicarboxylic acid, H2bpdc; 1,10&#8208;phenanthroline&#8208;2,9&#8208;dicarboxylic acid, H2pda) and LaCl3 generate two PMOFs, [La(bpdc)(H2O)Cl] (1) and [La(pda)(H2O)2Cl]&#8901;2H2O (2). Both complexes feature dinuclear lanthanum as building blocks with differences in the connecting number of likers, in which 1 has (4,8)&#8208;connected topology and 2 exhibits sql topology. Their structural differences result in the diversities of photoresponsive functionalities. Compared with reported PMOFs built from photoactive ligands and mixed ligands, this study provides new available categories of single ligand for generating PMOFs and tuning the structure and photoresponsive properties via ligand substitution and external photostimulus.

The Front Cover illustrates adsorption of the CO2 molecule into the inner channel of luminescent EuIII/TbIII fluorinated metal&#8211;organic frameworks. These MOFs form a cylindrical structure composed of triple&#8208;stranded helical chains. This characteristic cylindrical structure selectively adsorbs CO2, but not N2. The intensity ratio between red&#8208;emitting EuIII and green&#8208;emitting TbIII is dependent on the gas adsorption. More information can be found in the Research Article by Y. Hasegawa and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202403224).

         <title>Cover Feature: Probing Noncovalent Interaction Strengths of Host&#8208;Guest Complexes Using Negative Ion Photoelectron Spectroscopy (Chem. Eur. J. 66/2024)</title>

         <dc:description>
Host&#8211;guest complexes formed by noncovalent interactions (NCIs) exist widely in nature. Gas&#8208;phase electrospray ionization&#8211;negative ion photoelectron spectroscopy is demonstrated as a direct and precise technique to measure the absolute interaction strength, probe the nature of NCIs, and reveal electronic structure information for H&#8211;G complexes.

Carborazine (B2C2N2H6) and borazine (B3N3H6) are isoelectronic analogues of benzene (C6H6). In this work, we systematically investigated the geometric structure, charge distribution, frontier molecular orbital characteristics, bonding, electronic delocalization, magnetic shielding effect, and induced ring current of carborazine and borazine, and compared the studied characteristics with those of benzene to determine the aromatic character of the two analogues. More information can be found in the Research Article by Z. Liu, T. Lu and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202403369).

The Cover Feature shows a race between different sugars in which a para&#8208;nitrophenyl (PNP) substituent must be transferred from the start to the finish line. The rate constants of the substituents&#8242; migration are represented by animals (and a stone). The track itself has a bump that represents the energy barrier of the migration. Thus, the cover sums up our work investigating PNP migration for different sugars, which yielded the rate constants and energy barriers. We also performed theoretical studies on the mechanism and its energetic profile. More information can be found in the Research Article by L.&#8197;M. Friedrich, C. L&#252;tjohann, B. Hartke and T.&#8197;K. Lindhorst (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202403117).

         <title>Electrochemical CO2 Reduction Reaction: Comprehensive Strategic Approaches to Catalyst Design for Selective Liquid Products Formation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 66, November 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electrochemical CO2 reduction presents a promising avenue for transforming CO2 molecules into value added liquid chemicals, such as methanol, ethanol, formate, acetate, oxalate, C3&#8208;C4 products: 1&#8208;propanol, 2&#8208;propanol, 1&#8208;butanol, methylglyoxal, ethyl glycol, 2,3&#8208;furandiol etc. This review aims to focus on the fundamental principles guiding the pre&#8208;determining factors behind catalyst designing principles for the conversion of CO2 into liquid products.







Abstract
The escalating concern regarding the release of CO2 into the atmosphere poses a significant threat to the contemporary efforts in mitigating climate change. Amidst a multitude of strategies for curtailing CO2 emissions, the electrochemical CO2 reduction presents a promising avenue for transforming CO2 molecules into a diverse array of valuable gaseous and liquid products, such as CO, CH3OH, CH4, HCO2H, C2H4, C2H5OH, CH3CO2H, 1&#8208;C3H7OH and others. The mechanistic investigations of gaseous products (e.&#8201;g. CO, CH4, C2H4, C2H6 and others) broadly covered in the literature. There is a noticeable gap in the literature when it comes to a comprehensive summary exclusively dedicated to coherent roadmap for the designing principles for a selective catalyst all possible liquid products (such as CH3OH, C2H5OH, 1&#8208;C3H7OH, 2&#8208;C3H7OH, 1&#8208;C4H9OH, as well as other C3&#8208;C4 products like methylglyoxal and 2,3&#8208;furandiol, in addition to HCO2H, AcOH, oxalic acid and others), selectively converted by CO2 reduction. This entails a meticulous analysis to justify these approaches and a thorough exploration of the correlation between materials and their electrocatalytic properties. Furthermore, these insightful discussions illuminate the future prospects for practical applications, a facet not exhaustively examined in prior reviews.

Nickel&#8208;based catalysts are particularly advantageous for electrochemical ammonia synthesis due to their low cost, high efficiency, and readily available resources. This review provides a comprehensive summary of the properties and catalytic mechanisms of various nickel&#8208;based catalysts employed in nitrogen reduction reactions. Furthermore, it explores future research directions for advancing nickel&#8208;based catalyst technologies.







Abstract
The electrochemical nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) to synthesize ammonia (NH3) is considered as a promising method due to its approvable advantages of zero&#8208;pollution emission, feasible reaction proceedings, good safety and easy management. The multiple efforts have been devoted to the exploration of earth&#8208;abundant&#8208;element&#8208;based nanomaterials as high&#8208;efficiency electrocatalysts for realizing their industrial applications. Among these, the Ni&#8208;based nanomaterials is prioritized as an attractive non&#8208;noble&#8208;metal electrocatalysts for catalyzing NRR because they are earth&#8208;abundance and exceedingly easy to synthesize as well as also delivers the potential of high electrocatalytic activity and durability. In this review, after briefly elucidating the underlying mechanisms of NRR during the electrochemical process, we systematically sum up the recent research progress in representative Ni&#8208;based electrocatalysts, including monometallic Ni&#8208;based nanomaterials, bimetallic Ni&#8208;based nanomaterials, polymetallic Ni&#8208;based nanomaterials, etc. In particular, we discuss the effects of physicochemical properties, such as phases, crystallinity, morphology, composition, defects, heteroatom doping, and strain engineering, on the comprehensive performance of the abovementioned electrocatalysts, with the aim of establishing the nanostructure&#8208;function relationships of the electrocatalysts. In addition, the promising directions of Ni&#8208;based electrocatalysts for NRR are also pointed out and highlighted. The generic approach in this review may expand the frontiers of NRR and provides the inspiration for developing high&#8208;efficiently Ni&#8208;based electrocatalysts.

         <title>Electrochemical Decarboxylation Coupling Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 66, November 26, 2024. </description>

Carboxylic acids play an important role in organic synthesis, and electrochemical decarboxylation coupling is a very important way in the construction of chemical bonds such as C&#8722;C, C&#8722;N, C&#8722;O, C&#8722;S, C&#8208;Halide, and C&#8722;B bonds. Here, we summarise a series of reactions using electrochemistry for decarboxylation coupling in recent years. Electrocatalysis is widely used in organic synthesis due to its green and efficient features, and electrochemical decarboxylation coupling is a very important way. Chemical bonds such as C&#8722;C, C&#8722;O, C&#8722;N, C&#8722;S, C&#8722;B, and C&#8722;Si have been successfully constructed using this method. This paper summarises the development of electrochemical decarboxylative coupling in recent years and gives an outlook for the future.







Abstract
Carboxylic acids are attractive synthetic feedstocks with stable, non&#8208;toxic, and inexpensive properties that can be easily obtained from natural sources or through synthesis. Carboxylic acids have long been considered environmentally friendly coupling agents in various organic transformations. In recent years, electrochemically mediated decarboxylation reactions of decarboxylic acids and their derivatives (NHPI) have emerged as effective new methods for constructing carbon&#8208;carbon or carbon&#8208;heterocarbon chemical bonds. Compared with transition metal and photochemistry&#8208;mediated catalytic reactions, which do not require the addition of oxidants and strong bases, electrochemically&#8208;mediated decarboxylative transformations are considered a sustainable strategy. In addition, various functional groups tolerate the electrochemical decarboxylation conversion strategy well. Here, we summarize the recent electrochemical decarboxylation reactions to better elucidate the advantages of electrochemical decarboxylation reactions.

         <title>Strategies and Applications for Supramolecular Protein Self&#8208;Assembly</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 66, November 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Supramolecular hierarchical protein self&#8208;assembly is vital for constructing diverse and functional biomaterials, as well as to explore information exchange and cooperation between proteins. In this paper, the classical supramolecular protein assembly construction strategies and the flexible regulaion of assemblies are summarized and analyzed. In addition, the applications and the enormous potential and significance of supramolecular protein materials are also reviewed.







Abstract
Supramolecular chemistry achieves higher&#8208;order molecular self&#8208;assembly through non&#8208;covalent interactions. Utilizing supramolecular methods to explore the polymorphism of proteins, the building blocks of life, from a &#8220;bottom&#8208;up&#8221; perspective is essential for constructing diverse and functional biomaterials. In recent years, significant progress has been achieved in the design strategies and functional applications of supramolecular protein self&#8208;assembly, becoming a focal point for researchers. This paper reviews classical supramolecular strategies driving protein self&#8208;assembly, including electrostatic interactions, metal coordination, hydrogen bonding, hydrophobic interactions, host&#8208;guest interactions, and other mechanisms. We discuss how these supramolecular interactions regulate protein assembly processes and highlight protein supramolecular assemblies&#8242; unique structural and functional advantages in constructing artificial photosynthetic systems, protein hydrogels, bio&#8208;delivery systems, and other functional materials. The enormous potential and significance of supramolecular protein materials are elucidated. Finally, the challenges in preparing and applying protein supramolecular assemblies are summarized, and future development directions are projected.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this study, we report the design and synthesis of two novel carbazole&#8208;based bis&#8208;cyanostilbenes incorporating phenyl and thiophene &#960;&#8208;spacer units to investigate their distinct impacts on photophysical properties. Notably, the thiophene&#8208;based derivative exhibits remarkable far&#8208;red/near&#8208;infrared (NIR) solid&#8208;state emission, with an emission peak at 732 nm, which shifts to 750 nm upon mechanical grinding, demonstrating pronounced mechanochromic fluorescence in the NIR region. Although its quantum yield is moderate, the ability to modulate its emission through mechanical stimuli opens exciting opportunities for stimuli&#8208;responsive NIR applications. Conversely, the phenyl&#8208;based analogue shows excellent solid&#8208;state emission at 596 nm, achieving significantly higher quantum yields, due to suppressing &#960;&#8208;&#960; interactions. Both compounds also exhibit strong AIE, with the thiophene system emitting at 730 nm and the phenyl&#8208;based analogue at 580 nm in the aggregate state. In addition to their optical properties, both derivatives demonstrate remarkable thermal stability and reversible MFC. These intriguing behaviors highlight the critical role of &#960;&#8208;spacer engineering in fine&#8208;tuning solid&#8208;state emission, enhancing stimuli&#8208;responsive capabilities, and ensuring robust thermal performance. Overall, our findings provide valuable insights into the design of next&#8208;generation NIR&#8208;emissive materials, with promising potential for advancing applications in optoelectronics, bioimaging, and smart sensing technologies.</dc:description>

         <title>Exploring glycan&#8208;lectin interactions in natural&#8208;like environments: A view using NMR experiments&#160;inside cell and on cell surface</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Glycan&#8208;mediated molecular recognition events are essential for life. NMR is widely used to monitor glycan binding to&#160;lectins in solution&#160;using isolated glycans and lectins. In this context, we herein explore diverse NMR methodologies,&#160;from both the receptor and ligand perspectives,&#160;to monitor glycan&#8208;lectin interactions under experimental conditions mimicking the&#160;native milieu inside cells and on cell surface. For the NMR experiments inside cells, galectin&#8208;7 is employed as model, since most galectins are soluble and carry out their functions in the cellular micro&#8208;environment. Using&#160;Danio Rerio&#160;oocytes,&#160;the&#160;1H&#8208;15N HMQC&#160;NMR spectrum of a&#160;folded&#160;galectin has been observed inside cell for the first time,&#160;using a glycomimetic ligand (TDG) to&#160;overcoming the natural tendency of galectins to bind to numerous galactose&#8208;containing receptors within cells. Alternatively,most lectins, other than galectins, are displayed on the cell surface,&#160;providing a multivalent presentation to bind their glycan partners in&#160;cis&#160;(at the same cell) or in&#160;trans&#160;(on other cells).&#160;In this case,&#160;ligand&#8208;based&#160;STD&#8208;NMR experiments&#160;have been successfully applied to account for the interactions of natural glycans and glycomimetics with Siglec&#8208;10. These methodologies provide the proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept to open the door to the NMR analysis of the recognition of glycans&#160;in native&#8208;like settings.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>We report the development of an azanide (&#8722;NH2) surrogate which enables the facile conversion of (hetero)aryl halides into primary N&#8208;aryl amines under transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free conditions. The designed amidine reagent is easy to prepare, bench stable, and undergoes facile N&#8208;arylation under basic conditions at 40 &#176;C. Intermediate N&#8208;aryl amidines are readily cleaved to form N&#8208;aryl amines in situ through hydrolysis or base&#8208;promoted elimination. The developed surrogate is a safer and more selective alternative to existing anionic N&#8208;nucleophiles, such as alkali metal amides or azide salts.</dc:description>

         <title>Stimuli Induced Reversible Switching Between a Self&#8208;assembled 2&#8208;Catenane and the Constituent Coordination Rings</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A pair of comparable sized C&#8208;shaped bis&#8208;monodentate ligands (L1 and L22+) and a linear bis&#8208;monodentate ligand (L3) complimenting to the terminal&#8208;lengths of the C&#8208;shaped ligands have been identified. One&#8208;pot combination of cis&#8208;Pd(tmeda)2+, L1 and L3 (2:1:1 ratio) in water resulted an octa&#8208;cationic 2&#8208;catenane, [Pd2(tmeda)2(L1)(L3)]28+ in which two identical tetra&#8208;cationic macromonocyclic coordination rings are interlocked; however, a guest bound coordination ring was formed in presence of a selected di&#8208;anionic guest. Complexation of cis&#8208;Pd(tmeda)2+ with a mixture of L22+ and L3 (2:1:1 ratio) in water resulted the hexa&#8208;cationic macromonocyclic coordination ring, [Pd2(tmeda)2(L2)(L3)]6+ whereas&#160; a guest bound coordination ring was formed in the presence of the di&#8208;anionic guest.&#160; Addition of the guest to the preformed octa&#8208;cationic catenane caused ring separation to favour the guest&#8208;bound ring. This guest bound ring could be reverted to the 2&#8208;catenane by sequestering the bound guest using the relatively electron deficient hexa&#8208;cationic coordination ring. Thus, a design principle for reversible switching between a 2&#8208;catenane and the constituent macromonocyclic&#8208;rings using anion&#8208;binding/&#8208;sequestering as the core concept has been established.</dc:description>

         <title>NIR Diradical&#8208;Featured   Croconaine Nanoagent for Cancer Photoacoustic Imaging and Photothermal Therapy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Radical&#8208;featured organic materials usually demonstrate significantly narrower bandgap than that of regular organic materials, which is beneficial for near&#8208;infrared (NIR) absorption and non&#8208;radiative decay process, making them good candidates for photothermal agents (PTAs) of photothermal therapy (PTT). &#160;However, most organic radicals are too short&#8208;lived to be separated and stable. Herein, a stable pyrylium&#8208;croconaine (CR) dye CR845 with high diradical character was synthesized and assembled into CR845 nanoparticles (NPs) to explore the photoacoustic imaging (PAI) and photothermal therapeutic performance under NIR irradiation in vitro&#160;and in vivo. CR845 exhibited a stable NIR absorption at 845 nm (&#949;&#160;= 3.37 &#215; 105&#160;L mol&#8722;1&#160;cm&#8722;1) and a relatively high photothermal conversion efficiency (PCE) of 58.8%. When assembled into nanoparticles, CR845 NPs showed good photostability, good biocompatibility, favorable NIR photoacoustic potential, effective cancer cell killing and complete tumor elimination upon 850 nm laser irradiation. The work demonstrates a diradical&#8208;featured CR PTA with favorable PAI/PTT effects, which can help to provide new ideas for the development of NIR PTAs, and further promote the application of organic radical materials in the field of biomedicine.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we present a method for the diastereoselective synthesis of N&#8208;heterocycle&#8208;substituted cyclobutanes from commercially available bromocyclobutanes. This method enables the efficient formation of various heterocyclic aminocyclobutane esters and amides using simple reagents. Notably, N&#8208;nucleophiles such as imidazoles, azoles, and nucleobase derivatives were successfully incorporated, enhancing the chemical diversity of small ring building blocks for medicinal chemistry applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Catalytic Activity of Cellulose&#8208;supported Platinum and&#160;Palladium Nanoparticles for Allylbenzene Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Platinum and palladium nanoparticles were successfully deposited on tunicate cellulose via the photodeposition or microemulsion deposition method. Evenly distributed, small and narrow&#8208;sized particles in the range of 2&#8209;3 nm&#160;were obtained for microemulsion&#8208;prepared cellulose catalysts. The photodeposition method led to larger particle sizes, broader size distribution, and occasional agglomerations. The catalysts were tested in the allylbenzene hydrogenation reaction and the results were compared to commercially available catalysts. Because of smaller particles, both microemulsion&#8208;prepared catalysts and photodeposited ones show better activity than commercial catalysts. Even platinum and palladium nanoparticles were active for the hydrogenation, only cellulose&#8208;supported platinum nanoparticles showed good stability. For palladium nanoparticles, stronger leaching from the surface of cellulose was observed. Cellulose&#8208;supported catalysts were recycled, and reusability is comparable to commercial catalysts. Therefore, cellulose could be used as an alternative catalyst support.</dc:description>

         <title>Influence of ionic liquid film thickness and flow rate on macrocyclization efficiency and selectivity in supported ionic liquid&#8208;liquid phase catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Supported ionic&#8208;liquid phase (SILP) technology in a biphasic setting with n&#8208;heptane as the transport phase was applied to the Ru&#8208;alkylidene&#8208;N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) catalyzed macrocyclization of&#160; &#945;,&#969;&#8208;dienes to elucidate the effect of ionic liquid (IL)&#8208;film thickness, flow rate as well as substrate and product concentration on macrocyclization efficiency, and Z&#8208;selectivity. To understand the molecular&#8208;level behavior of the substrates and products at the n&#8208;heptane/IL interphase, atomistic molecular dynamics simulations were conducted and correlated with experimental observations. The thickness of the IL layer strongly influences the Z/E ratio of the products in that a thin IL layer favors higher Z/E ratios by confining the catalyst between the pore wall and the liquid&#8208;liquid interphase whereas a thick IL layer favors formation of the E&#8208;product and Ru&#8208;hydride catalyzed isomerization reactions. Also, macrocyclization efficiency, expressed by the ratio of oligomers/macromonocycle (O/MMC), is influenced both by the flow rate and the thickness of the IL layer.</dc:description>

         <title>From a P&#8208;Bridging Phosphaketene to &#956;&#8208;Phosphinidenide and &#956;&#8208;Diphosphaurea Units at a Dinickel Core</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Salt metathesis of dinickel(II) complex LNi2Br (1; L is a dinucleating pyrazolate ligand with two &#946;&#8208;diketiminato chelate arms) with Na(OCP)&#8729;(dioxane)2.5 yielded LNi2(PCO) (2) with a P&#8208;bridging phosphaethynolate. Further reaction of 2 with benzyl isocyanide or with an N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) triggered decarbonylation and gave LNi2(PCN&#8208;CH2Ph) (3) and LNi2P(NHC) (4) with P&#8208;bridging cyanophosphide and NHC&#8208;phosphinidenide, respectively. Electronic structure analysis indicated a &#956;2&#8208;&#951;2:&#951;1 binding mode of the PCO&#8211; anion between the two NiII ions in 2, which is even more pronounced for the [PCN(&#8208;CH2Ph)]&#8722; anion in 3. DFT assessment of the formation mechanism of 4 showed that attack at the phosphaketene&#8208;C atom is kinetically preferred but reversible and unproductive, while kinetically more demanding back&#8208;side SN2 attack at the phosphaketene&#8208;P atom triggers CO release with 4 as thermodynamic product. Nucleophilic addition at the phosphaketene&#8208;C could be demonstrated by the strongly exergonic reaction of 2 with KPPh2, giving unstable K[LNi2(P(O)CPPh2)] (5) with a P&#8208;bridging and K+&#8208;stabilized diphosphaurea derivative.

Further reaction of 2 with benzyl isocyanide or with an N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC) triggered decarbonylation and gave LNi2(PCN-CH2Ph) (3) and LNi2P(NHC) (4) with P-bridging cyanophosphide and NHC-phosphinidenide, respectively. Electronic structure analysis indicated a &#956;2-&#951;2:&#951;1 binding mode of the PCO&#8211; anion between the two NiII ions in 2, which is even more pronounced for the [PCN(-CH2Ph)]&#8722; anion in 3. DFT assessment of the formation mechanism of 4 showed that attack at the phosphaketene-C atom is kinetically preferred but reversible and unproductive, while kinetically more demanding back-side SN2 attack at the phosphaketene-P atom triggers CO release with 4 as thermodynamic product. Nucleophilic addition at the phosphaketene-C could be demonstrated by the strongly exergonic reaction of 2 with KPPh2, giving unstable K[LNi2(P(O)CPPh2)] (5) with a P-bridging and K+-stabilized diphosphaurea derivative. All new complexes 2&#8211;5 have been comprehensively characterized, including by X-ray diffraction.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Twofold 6&#960;&#8208;Electrocyclization as a Route Toward Multi&#8208;Heteroatom&#8208;Doped Nanographenes Built&#160;on 1,4&#8208;Dihydropyrrolo[3,2&#8208;b]pyrrole Core</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Here we present a highly versatile synthetic strategy based on twofold 6&#960;&#8208;electrocyclization accompanied with HBr elimination as a novel approach towards centrosymmetric multi&#8208;heteroatom&#8208;doped nanographenes build around an electron&#8208;rich 1,4&#8208;dihydropyrrolo[3,2&#8208;b]pyrrole core. A straightforward synthesis from readily available substrates offers a unique possibility of fusing the 1,4&#8208;dihydropyrrolo[3,2&#8208;b]pyrrole subunit not only with carbocyclic building blocks, such as electron&#8208;deficient phenanthrenes, chrysenes, or [4]helicenes, but also with heterocyclic systems, such as benzo[b]furan and 5&#8208;thiatruxene. The clear advantage of this strategy is that there is no requirement to assemble complex scaffolds possessing bromoaryl units since bromine atom is introduced by bromination of 1,4&#8208;dihydropyrrolo[3,2&#8208;b]pyrrole core which, because of its exceptionally electron&#8208;rich character, is universal and straightforward reaction. The obtained &#967;&#8208;shaped and S&#8208;shaped nanographenes containing 10 or more fused rings, exhibit visible&#8208;range emissions characterized by fluorescence quantum yields reaching 48%. Computational studies of the reaction mechanism revealed that the 6&#960;&#8208;electrocyclization is kinetically favourable over photo&#8208;induced direct arylation. Steady&#8208;state UV/Visible spectroscopy reveals that upon photoexcitation, the prepared S&#8208;shaped N&#8208;doped nanographenes undergo mostly radiative relaxation leading to large fluorescence quantum yields. We anticipate that this chemistry will empower the creation of new materials with various functionalities.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We present the preparation and investigation of a fluorine&#8208;free surface&#8208;active bis&#8208;N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) platinum(II) complex &#8212; trans&#8208;[Pt(mPEG3C8Im)2Cl2] &#8212; for interface&#8208;enhanced supported ionic liquid phase (SILP) catalysis within a group of (mPEGn)&#8208;substituted ionic liquids (ILs) ([(mPEGn)2Im][A] ILs). The complex was characterized by means of single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (scXRD) analysis and multinuclear (1H, 13C, 195Pt) NMR spectroscopy, indicating the presence of two almost equimolar syn&#8211;anti rotamers of the square&#8208;planar complex in solution. Angle&#8208;resolved X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (ARXPS) revealed pronounced interface&#8208;accumulation of trans&#8208;[Pt(mPEG3C8Im)2Cl2] in IL solutions of [(mPEG2)2Im][A] (A&#8722; = I&#8722; and PF6&#8722;).</dc:description>

         <title>Neutral interface directed 3D confined self&#8208;assembly of block copolymer: Anisotropic patterned particles with ordered structures</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Three&#8208;dimensional confined self&#8208;assembly (3D&#8208;CSA) of block copolymers (BCPs) is a distinctive and robust strategy that can yield colloidal polymer particles boasting ordered internal structures and diverse morphologies. The unique advantage of neutral interface lies in its ability to create anisotropic particles with surface patterns. The resulting unique polymer particles exhibit deformability under swelling, coupled with excellent spreadability and optical properties. These particles can also be used for fabrication of anisotropic nanoobjects or mesoporous particles via disassembly or serving as templates. This review comprehensively outlines the research advancements in neutral interface&#8208;guided 3D&#8208;CSA systems, including surfactant engineering, internal structure control, properties and future possibilities of anisotropic patterned particles.</dc:description>
