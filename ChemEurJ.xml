         <title>Side&#8208;Chain Interactions in d/l Peptide Nanotubes: Studies by Crystallography, NMR Spectroscopy and Molecular Dynamics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cyclic d/l peptide nanotubes (CPNs) have diverse applications in biological and materials science. We study the impact of side chain alignment, hydrophobicity and charge on CPN stability and report crystal structures of non&#8208;tubular folded peptide conformations. Molecular dynamics simulations correlate with measured H&#8208;bond half&#8208;lives, showing how the composition and relative orientation of amino acids are key factors in CPN stability.







Abstract
Our understanding of the factors affecting the stability of cyclic d/l peptide (CP) nanotubes remains underdeveloped. In this work, we investigate the impact of side chain alignment, hydrophobicity and charge on CP nanotube stability through X&#8208;ray crystallography, NMR spectroscopy and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. We characterise the distinct CP&#8208;CP alignments that can form and identify stable and unstable dimers by MD simulation. We measure H&#8208;bond half&#8208;lives of synthesised CPs by 1H&#8722;D exchange experiments and find good correlation with predicted CP&#8208;CP stabilities. We find that hydrophobic amino acids improve CP dimer stability but experimentally reduce solubility. Charged amino acids either increase or decrease CP dimer stability depending on the relative orientation and composition of charged groups. X&#8208;ray crystal structures are solved for two CPs, revealing non&#8208;tubular folded conformations. Ultimately, this work will assist the educated design of stable tubular structures for potential applications in biomedicine.

         <title>&#8220;Golden&#8221; Cascade Cyclization to Benzo[c]&#8208;Phenanthridines</title>

         <dc:description>
Suitable substitution: The synthesis of highly substituted six&#8208;membered N&#8208;heterocycles using gold catalysis is reported. The applied cascade reaction using different substituted alkyne systems as starting materials furnished the corresponding benzo[c]phenanthridines in very high overall yields. In addition, two &#960;&#8208;extended molecules were studied as organic semiconductors in organic thin&#8208;film transistors.







Abstract
Herein, we describe a gold&#8208;catalyzed cascade cyclization of Boc&#8208;protected benzylamines bearing two tethered alkyne moieties in a domino reaction initiated by a 6&#8208;endo&#8208;dig cyclization. The reaction was screened intensively, and the scope was explored, resulting in nine new Boc&#8208;protected dihydrobenzo[c]phenanthridines with yields of up to 98&#8201;%; even a &#960;&#8208;extension and two bidirectional approaches were successful. Furthermore, thermal cleavage of the Boc group and subsequent oxidation gave substituted benzo[c]phenanthridines in up to quantitative yields. Two bidirectional approaches under the optimized conditions were successful, and the resulting &#960;&#8208;extended molecules were tested as organic semiconductors in organic thin&#8208;film transistors.

         <title>The Stereoselective Oxidation of para&#8208;Substituted Benzenes by a Cytochrome P450 Biocatalyst</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The efficient and sustainable hydroxylation, epoxidation and sulfoxidation of a wide range of benzene derivatives using an engineered variant of a bacterial cytochrome P450 enzyme is reported. These reactions were catalyzed with high activity, regioselectivity and total turnover number (up to 20,000) and in certain instances these reactions were achieved with high enanatioselectivity (up to 98&#8201;% ee.).







Abstract
The serine 244 to aspartate (S244D) variant of the cytochrome P450 enzyme CYP199A4 was used to expand its substrate range beyond benzoic acids. Substrates, in which the carboxylate group of the benzoic acid moiety is replaced were oxidised with high activity by the S244D mutant (product formation rates &gt;60&#8197;nmol.(nmol&#8208;CYP)&#8722;1.min&#8722;1) and with total turnover numbers of up to 20,000. Ethyl &#945;&#8208;hydroxylation was more rapid than methyl oxidation, styrene epoxidation and S&#8208;oxidation. The S244D mutant catalysed the ethyl hydroxylation, epoxidation and sulfoxidation reactions with an excess of one stereoisomer (in some instances up to &gt;98&#8201;%). The crystal structure of 4&#8208;methoxybenzoic acid&#8208;bound CYP199A4 S244D showed that the active site architecture and the substrate orientation were similar to that of the WT enzyme. Overall, this work demonstrates that CYP199A4 can catalyse the stereoselective hydroxylation, epoxidation or sulfoxidation of substituted benzene substrates under mild conditions resulting in more sustainable transformations using this heme monooxygenase enzyme.

         <title>Backbonding in Thorium(IV) and Uranium(IV) Diarsenido Complexes with tBuNC and CO</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rare phenomenon: A pronounced shift to lower frequency in the IR spectra of isostructural ThIV and UIV complexes of isocyanide and carbonyl indicates strong backbonding between the actinide and ligand. Quantum mechanical calculations show that charge transfer from an An&#8722;As &#963;&#8208;bond to the &#960;* orbital of the ligand is responsible for the strong donor&#8208;acceptor interaction.







Abstract
The coordination of tBuNC and CO with the diarsenido complexes (C5Me5)2An(&#951;2&#8208;As2Mes2), An=Th, U, has been investigated. For the first time, a comparison between isostructural complexes of ThIV and UIV has been possible with CO; density functional calculations indicated an appreciable amount of &#960; backbonding that originates from charge transfer from an actinide&#8208;arsenic sigma bond. The calculated CO stretching frequencies in the ThIV and UIV diarsenido complexes are consistent with the experimental measurements, both show large shifts to lower frequency. We demonstrate that the &#960; backbonding is crucial to explaining the red shifts of CO frequency upon AnIV complex formation. Interestingly, this interaction essentially correlates to the parallel orientation of &#960;*(C&#8722;O) orbitals relative to the An&#8722;As bond.

         <title>Amine&#8208;Directed Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed C&#8722;H Halogenation of Phenylalanine Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A site&#8208;selective, primary amine (as a native NH2 functionality)&#8208;directed, palladium&#8208;catalyzed C(sp2)&#8722;H halogenation (X=I, Br, Cl) of phenylalanine platforms is demonstrated. Efficient and versatile, this strategy paves the way to constructing a large array of original halogenated phenylalanine derivatives as nonproteinogenic AAs.

An efficient primary&#8208;amine&#8208;directed, palladium&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H halogenation (X=I, Br, Cl) of phenylalanine derivatives is reported on a range of quaternary amino acid (AA) derivatives thanks to suitable conditions employing trifluoroacetic acid as additive. The extension of this original native functionality&#8208;directed ortho&#8208;selective halogenation was even demonstrated with the more challenging native phenylalanine as tertiary AA.

         <title>Investigation of Masked N&#8208;Acyl&#8208;N&#8208;isocyanates: Support for Oxadiazolones as Blocked N&#8208;Isocyanate Precursors</title>

         <dc:description>
Masked synthesis: N&#8208;isocyanates are reactive intermediates and their N&#8208;acyl derivatives, amido&#8208;isocyanates, are rare. Herein, their synthesis and reactivity are studied, supporting that under suitable conditions the amido&#8208;isocyanate is in equilibrium with the parent oxadiazolone. Reactions with amino&#8208;amides as nucleophiles form nitrogen&#8208;rich products, either aza&#8208;tripeptides or their parent hydantoins. Support for an isocyanate intermediate was also obtained using carboxylate ions as nucleophiles, affording N&#8208;acylhydrazides.







Abstract
In contrast to carbon&#8208;substituted isocyanates that are common building blocks, N&#8208;substituted isocyanates remain underdeveloped and reports on their N&#8208;acyl derivatives (i.&#8201;e. amido&#8208;isocyanates) are exceedingly rare. Herein, amido&#8208;isocyanates were investigated in the context of syntheses of aza&#8208;tripeptide and hydantoins subunits starting from simple bench&#8208;stable precursors. A key finding is that the amido&#8208;isocyanate formed in&#8197;situ cyclized to yield an oxadiazolone, and that under suitable reaction conditions this heterocycle is a traceless blocked (masked) N&#8208;isocyanate. Using organic bases as catalysts and upon heating, oxadiazolone formation is observed, and various nucleophiles to provide the desired aza&#8208;dipeptides or hydantoins in moderate to high yields. Further support for an amido&#8208;isocyanate intermediate was obtained using carboxylic acids as nucleophiles, affording N&#8208;acylhydrazide products.

         <title>Lateral Metallation and Redistribution Reactions of Sodium Ferrates Containing Bulky 2,6&#8208;Diisopropyl&#8208;N&#8208;(trimethylsilyl)anilide Ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Influenced by the large steric demands imposed by the 2,6&#8208;diisopropyl&#8208;N&#8208;(trimethylsilyl)anilide ligand, N(SiMe3)Dipp, new examples of chemical cooperativity on sodium ferrates have been disclosed. This includes: (a) the chemoselective ferration of pentafluorobenzene by a heteroleptic tris(amido) sodium ferrate; and, (b) the lateral metallation of a N(SiMe3)Dipp group at one Me of its SiMe3 substituent when attempting the co&#8208;complexation of the sodium and iron (II) single&#8208;metal amides.







Abstract
Alkali&#8208;metal ferrates containing amide groups have emerged as regioselective bases capable of promoting Fe&#8722;H exchanges of aromatic substrates. Advancing this area of heterobimetallic chemistry, a new series of sodium ferrates is introduced incorporating the bulky arylsilyl amido ligand N(SiMe3)(Dipp) (Dipp=2,6&#8208;iPr2&#8208;C6H3). Influenced by the large steric demands imposed by this amide, transamination of [NaFe(HMDS)3] (HMDS=N(SiMe3)2) with an excess of HN(SiMe3)(Dipp) led to the isolation of heteroleptic [Na(HMDS)2Fe{N(SiMe3)Dipp}]&#8734; (1) resulting from the exchange of just one HMDS group. An alternative co&#8208;complexation approach, combining the homometallic metal amides [NaN(SiMe3)Dipp] and [Fe{N(SiMe3)Dipp}2] induces lateral metallation of one Me arm from the SiMe3 group in the iron amide furnishing tetrameric [NaFe{N(SiCH2Me2)Dipp}{N(SiMe3)Dipp}]4 (2). Reactivity studies support that this deprotonation is driven by the steric incompatibility of the single metal amides rather than the basic capability of the sodium reagent. Displaying synergistic reactivity, heteroleptic sodium ferrate 1 can selectively promote ferration of pentafluorobenzene using one of its HMDS arms to give heterotrileptic [Na{N(SiMe3)Dipp}(HMDS)Fe(C6F5)]&#8734; (4). Attempts to deprotonate less activated pyridine led to the isolation of NaHMDS and heteroleptic Fe(II) amide [(py)Fe{N(SiMe3)Dipp}(HMDS)] (5), resulting from an alternative redistribution process which is favoured by the Lewis donor ability of this substrate.

         <title>Sequential Hydrogen Tunneling in o&#8208;Tolylmethylene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Who is first? Conformer specificity, although rarely evidenced, is expected to play a crucial role in tunneling reactions. [1,4] hydrogen transfer in o&#8208;tolylmethylene is a puzzling example in this respect, as the apparent rate constants do not differ for the two conformers. Our structural, kinetic, and energetic analyses demonstrate that conformer specificity is disguised by a rotational tunneling pre&#8208;equilibrium.







Abstract
o&#8208;Tolylmethylene 1 is a metastable triplet carbene that rearranges to o&#8208;xylylene 2 even at temperatures as low as 2.7&#8197;K via [1,4] H atom tunneling. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and electron nuclear double resonance (ENDOR) spectroscopical techniques were used to identify two conformers of 1 (anti and syn) in noble gas matrices and in frozen organic solutions. Conformer&#8208;specific kinetic measurements revealed that the rate constants for the rearrangements of the anti and syn conformers of 1 are very similar. However, the orbital alignment in the syn conformer is less favorable for the hydrogen transfer reaction than the orbital configuration in the anti conformer. Our spectroscopic and quantum chemical investigations indicate that anti 1 and syn 1 rapidly interconvert via efficient quantum tunneling forming a rotational pre&#8208;equilibrium. The subsequent second tunneling reaction, the [1,4] H migration from anti 1 to 2, is rate&#8208;limiting for the formation of 2. We here present an efficient strategy for the study of such tunneling equilibria.

         <title>CD Stretching Modes are Sensitive to the Microenvironment in Ionic Liquids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Knowledge of the structure of the electrical double layer in ionic liquids is crucial for their applications in electrochemical technologies. We report the synthesis and applicability of an imidazolium&#8208;based amphiphilic ionic liquid with a perdeuterated alkyl chain for studies of electric potential&#8208;dependent rearrangements, and changes in the microenvironment in a monolayer on a Au(111) surface. Electrochemical measurements show two states of the organization of ions on the electrode surface. In situ IR spectroscopy shows that the alkyl chains in imidazolium cations change their orientation depending on the adsorption state. The methylene&#8208;  d  2  stretching modes in the perdeuterated SAIL display a reversible, potential&#8208;dependent appearance of a new band. The presence of this mode also depends on the anion in the SAIL. Supported by quantum chemical calculations, this new mode is assigned to a second n  as  (CD  2  ) band in alkyl&#8208;chain fragments embedded in a polar environment of the anions/solvent present in the vicinity of the imidazolium cation and electrode. It is a measure of the potential&#8208;dependent segregation between polar and non&#8208;polar environments in the layers of a SAIL closest to the electrode.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Knowledge of the structure of the electrical double layer in ionic liquids is crucial for their applications in electrochemical technologies. We report the synthesis and applicability of an imidazolium-based amphiphilic ionic liquid with a perdeuterated alkyl chain for studies of electric potential-dependent rearrangements, and changes in the microenvironment in a monolayer on a Au(111) surface. Electrochemical measurements show two states of the organization of ions on the electrode surface. In situ IR spectroscopy shows that the alkyl chains in imidazolium cations change their orientation depending on the adsorption state. The methylene-  d  2  stretching modes in the perdeuterated SAIL display a reversible, potential-dependent appearance of a new band. The presence of this mode also depends on the anion in the SAIL. Supported by quantum chemical calculations, this new mode is assigned to a second n  as  (CD  2  ) band in alkyl-chain fragments embedded in a polar environment of the anions/solvent present in the vicinity of the imidazolium cation and electrode. It is a measure of the potential-dependent segregation between polar and non-polar environments in the layers of a SAIL closest to the electrode.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Hetero&#8208;bimetallic Lanthanide&#8208;Coinage Metal Compounds Featuring Possible Metal&#8208;Metal Interactions in the Excited State</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Rare interactions for rare earths: The trivalent lanthanide compounds [dpfam3Ln] (Ln&#160;=&#160;La, Nd, dpfam&#160;=&#160;N,N&#8242;&#8208;bis[(2&#8208;diphenylphosphino)phenyl]formamidinate) were used as scaffold to incorporate Ag+ and Au+ ions, resulting in the hetero&#8208;bimetallic compounds [dpfam3LnM][OTf]. The compounds were investigated by photoluminescence spectroscopy and quantum chemical calculations, of which the latter showed rare La&#8722;Au interactions for the first excited state.







Abstract
Heterometallic complexes, combining metals of the outer rims of the d&#8208;block, for example lanthanides(III) (Ln) and coinage metals(I) (M) are scarcely reported, synthetically challenging and highly interesting in terms of their interactions. In this context, we synthesized hetero&#8208;bimetallic Ln&#8722;M compounds ligated by the phosphine functionalized amidinate system (N,N&#8217;&#8208;bis[(2&#8208;diphenylphosphino)phenyl]formamidinate, &#8220;dpfam&#8221;). The resulting compounds [dpfam3LnM][OTf] (Ln&#160;=&#160;La, Nd and M&#160;=&#160;Ag, Au) feature a close proximity of the two metal centres and were investigated experimentally by photoluminescence spectroscopy and quantum chemical calculations. The latter showed rare La&#8722;Au interactions for the first excited state.

         <title>Electrochemical studies of CO2&#8208;reducing metalloenzymes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Only two enzymes are capable of directly reducing CO2  : the CO dehydrogenase, which produces CO at a [NiFe4S4  ] active site, and the formate dehydrogenase, which produces formate at a W/Mo active site. Both metalloenzymes are very rapid, energy&#8208;efficient and specific in terms of product. They have been connected to electrodes with two different objectives. A series of studies used protein film electrochemistry to learn about different aspects of the reactivity of these enzymes (reactivity with substrates, inhibitors&#8230;). Another series focused on taking advantage of the catalytic performance of these enzymes to build biotechnological devices, from CO2&#8208;reducing electrodes to full photochemical devices performing artificial photosynthesis. Here, we review all these works.</dc:description>

         <title>Engineering of Silicon Core&#8208;shell Structures for Li&#8208;ion Anodes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The amount of silicon in anode materials for Li&#8208;ion batteries is still limited by the huge volume changes during charge&#8208;discharge cycles. Such changes lead to the loss of electrical contacts, as well as mechanical and surface electrolyte interphase (SEI) instabilities, strongly reducing the cycle life. Core&#8208;shell structures have attracted a vast research interest due to the possibility of modifying some properties with a judicious choice of the shell. It is, for example, possible to improve the electronic conductivity and ionic diffusion, or buffer volume variations. This review gives a comprehensive overview of the recent developments and the different strategies used for the design, synthesis and electrochemical performance of silicon&#8208;based core&#8208;shells. It is based on a selection of the main types of silicon coatings reported in the literature, including carbon, inorganic, organic and double&#8208;layer coatings, Finally, a summary of the advantages and drawbacks of these different types of core&#8208;shells as anode materials for Li&#8208;ion batteries and some insightful suggestions in regards to their use are provided.</dc:description>

         <title>Morphology Dependent Peroxidase Mimicking Enzyme Activity of Copper Metal&#8211;Organic Polyhedra Assemblies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The morphology of nanomaterials (geometric shape and dimension) play a significant role in its various physical and chemical properties. Thus, it is essential to link morphology with performance in specific applications. For this purpose, the morphology of copper metal&#8208;organic polyhedra&#160;(Cu&#8208;MOP) can be modulated through distinct assemble process, which facilitates the exploration of the relationship between morphology and catalytic performance. In this work, the assemblies of Cu&#8208;MOP with three different morphologies (nanorods, nanofibers and nanosheets) were facilely prepared by the variation of solvent mixture of N, N&#8208;dimethylformamide (DMF) and methanol, revealed the important role of the interaction between the surface group and the solvent on the morphology of these assemblies. Cu&#8208;MOP nanofibers exhibited the highest mimetic peroxidase enzyme activity over the Cu&#8208;MOP nanosheets and nanorods, which have been utilized in the detection of glucose. Cu&#8208;MOPs assemblies with tunable morphology accompanied with adjustable mimic peroxidase activity, had great potential applications in the field of bioanalytical chemistry and biomedicals.</dc:description>

         <title>The photophysics and photochemistry of melanin&#8208; like nanomaterials depend on morphology and structure</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Melanin&#8208;like nanomaterials have found application in a large variety of high economic and social impact fields as medicine, energy conversion and storage, photothermal catalysis and environmental remediation. These materials have been used mostly for their optical and electronic properties, but also for their high biocompatibility and simplicity and versatility of preparation. Beside this, their chemistry is complex and it yields structures with different molecular weight and composition ranging from oligomer, to polymer as well as nanoparticles (NP). The comprehension of the correlation of the different compositions and morphologies to the optical properties of melanin is still incomplete and challenging, even if it is fundamental also from technological point of view. In this minireview we focus on scientific papers, mostly recent ones, that indeed examine the link between composition and structural feature and photophysical and photochemical properties proposing this approach as a general one for future research.</dc:description>

         <title>Macrocyclic Inorganic Tin Containing Oxo Clusters: Heterometallic Strategy for Configuration and Catalytic Activity Modulation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this work, we report the first examples of inorganic macrocyclic tin&#8208;oxo clusters which are stabilized by sulfate ligands. As determined by X&#8208;ray diffraction and photoelectron spectroscopy analyses, the prepared inorganic Sn10&#8208;oxo cluster displays interesting mixed valence behaviors, with 8 Sn4+ located at the cyclic skeleton and two Sn2+ encapsulated in the center. When further introducing Ti4+ and In3+ ions to the synthetic systems, heterometallic Sn2Ti6 and SnIn5Ti6 complexes with Ti6(SO4)9 and SnIn5(SO4)12 macrocyclic skeletons were prepared whose configuration and packing models were affected by the ionic radius of incorporated metals. Moreover, comparative CO2 reduction experiments confirm that such heterometallic composition can significantly improve the catalytic activities of these inorganic macrocyclic oxo clusters. This work represents a milestone in constructing inorganic tin complexes and also macrocyclic metal oxo clusters with tunable configurations and properties.</dc:description>

         <title>Selectively Deoxyfluorinated N&#8208;Acetyllactosamine Analogues as 19F NMR Probes to Study Carbohydrate&#8208;Galectin Interactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 51, Page 13040-13051, September 9, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Six mono&#8208;deoxyfluorinated LacNAc analogues were prepared, and their affinity to galectin&#8208;1 and &#8722;3 was tested. Fluorination at positions 3, 4&#8242;, and 6&#8242; abrogated binding to galectin&#8208;1 and substantially reduced binding to galectin&#8208;3. Placement of fluorine at the positions 6 and 2&#8242; increased affinity to galectin&#8208;1, whereas binding to galectin&#8208;3 was unaffected. Fluorination at position 3&#8242; did not significantly influence binding to either galectin.







Abstract
Galectins are widely expressed galactose&#8208;binding lectins implied, for example, in immune regulation, metastatic spreading, and pathogen recognition. N&#8208;Acetyllactosamine (Gal&#946;1&#8208;4GlcNAc, LacNAc) and its oligomeric or glycosylated forms are natural ligands of galectins. To probe substrate specificity and binding mode of galectins, we synthesized a complete series of six mono&#8208;deoxyfluorinated analogues of LacNAc, in which each hydroxyl has been selectively replaced by fluorine while the anomeric position has been protected as methyl &#946;&#8208;glycoside. Initial evaluation of their binding to human galectin&#8208;1 and &#8208;3 by ELISA and 19F NMR T2&#8208;filter revealed that deoxyfluorination at C3, C4&#8242; and C6&#8242; completely abolished binding to galectin&#8208;1 but very weak binding to galectin&#8208;3 was still detectable. Moreover, deoxyfluorination of C2&#8242; caused an approximately 8&#8208;fold increase in the binding affinity towards galectin&#8208;1, whereas binding to galectin&#8208;3 was essentially not affected. Lipophilicity measurement revealed that deoxyfluorination at the Gal moiety affects log P very differently compared to deoxyfluorination at the GlcNAc moiety.

         <title>Zeolitic Vanadotungstates with Ultrahigh Porosities for Separation of Butane and Isobutane</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 51, Page 13067-13071, September 9, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Zeolitic octahedral metal oxides based on vanadotungstates with different cations were successfully obtained and characterized. They efficiently separated n&#8208;butane from n&#8208;butane and i&#8208;butane mixtures. Single&#8208;gas adsorption measurements showed that the adsorbed volume of n&#8208;butane was much larger than that of i&#8208;butane. Breakthrough measurements showed that the materials efficiently achieved the separation of n&#8208;butane and i&#8208;butane, which was environmental friendly and cost&#8208;efficiently.







Abstract
Zeolitic vanadotungstates with tunable microporosity have potential interests in gas separation. The pore openings of the materials are in between the diameters of normal butane and isobutane, which causes the materials only adsorb normal butane. The breakthrough experiments show that the materials effectively separate normal butane from the normal butane and isobutane mixture even at high temperatures. The robust materials can be reused without loss of the separation performance.

The &#960;&#8208;conjugation&#8208;linked CTF&#8208;1/GO hybrid material fabricated by facile low&#8208;temperature condensation of 1,4&#8208;dicyanobenzene in the presence of graphene oxide (GO) exhibited an optimum H2 evolution rate of 2262.4&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&#8722;1 under visible light irradiation, which was 9 times that of pure CTF&#8208;1. This result indicates addition of certain additives, particularly like graphene, could significantly improve the materials&#8242; conductivity, make the crystallinity of the framework itself play a less critical role.







Abstract
Covalent triazine frameworks (CTFs) with two&#8208;dimensional structures have exhibited promising visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced H2 evolution performance. However, it is still a challenge to improve their activity. Herein, we report &#960;&#8208;conjugation&#8208;linked CTF&#8208;1/GO for boosting photocatalytic H2 evolution. The CTF&#8208;1/GO hybrid material was obtained by a facile low&#8208;temperature condensation of 1,4&#8208;dicyanobenzene in the presence of GO. The results of photocatalytic H2 evolution indicate that the optimum hybrid, CTF&#8208;1/GO&#8208;3.0, exhibited an H2 evolution rate of 2262.4&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&#8722;1 under visible light irradiation, which was 9 times that of pure CTF&#8208;1. The enhanced photocatalytic performance could be attributed to the fact that GO in CTF&#8208;1/GO hybrids not only acts as an electron collector and transporter like a &#8220;bridge&#8221; to facilitate the separation and transfer of photogenerated charges but also shortens the electron migration path due to its thin sheet layer uniformly distribution over CTF&#8208;1. This work could help future development of novel conjugated CTF&#8208;based composite materials as high&#8208;efficiency photocatalyst for photocatalysis.

Lanthanoid keys to proteins: A stable chiral lanthanide(III) tag reacts spontaneously and quantitatively with a cysteine residue to generate a stable thioether bond. The lanthanide&#8208;binding tag presents a tool to probe proteins using multiple spectroscopic techniques, including NMR, electron paramagnetic resonance and time&#8208;resolved FRET experiments.







Abstract
A lanthanide&#8208;binding tag site&#8208;specifically attached to a protein presents a tool to probe the protein by multiple spectroscopic techniques, including nuclear magnetic resonance, electron paramagnetic resonance and time&#8208;resolved luminescence spectroscopy. Here a new stable chiral LnIII tag, referred to as C12, is presented for spontaneous and quantitative reaction with a cysteine residue to generate a stable thioether bond. The synthetic protocol of the tag is relatively straightforward, and the tag is stable for storage and shipping. It displays greatly enhanced reactivity towards selenocysteine, opening a route towards selective tagging of selenocysteine in proteins containing cysteine residues. Loaded with TbIII or TmIII ions, the C12 tag readily generates pseudocontact shifts (PCS) in protein NMR spectra. It produces a relatively rigid tether between lanthanide and protein, which is beneficial for interpretation of the PCSs by single magnetic susceptibility anisotropy tensors, and it is suitable for measuring distance distributions in double electron&#8211;electron resonance experiments. Upon reaction with cysteine or other thiol compounds, the TbIII complex exhibits a 100&#8208;fold enhancement in luminescence quantum yield, affording a highly sensitive turn&#8208;on luminescence probe for time&#8208;resolved FRET assays and enzyme reaction monitoring.

         <title>Germyliumylidene: A Versatile Low Valent Group 14 Catalyst</title>

The versatile ambiphilic catalytic application of a bis&#8208;NHC&#8208;stabilized germyliumylidene enables a range of reductive functionalization reactions, with a particular emphasis on C=O reduction that is, CO2 and carbonyls.







Abstract
Bis&#8208;NHC stabilized germyliumylidenes [RGe(NHC)2]+ are typically Lewis basic (LB) in nature, owing to their lone pair and coordination of two NHCs to the vacant p&#8208;orbitals of the germanium center. However, they can also show Lewis acidity (LA) via Ge&#8722;CNHC &#963;* orbital. Utilizing this unique electronic feature, we report the first example of bis&#8208;NHC&#8208;stabilized germyliumylidene [MesTerGe(NHC)2]Cl (1), (MesTer=2,6&#8208;(2,4,6&#8208;Me3C6H2)2C6H3; NHC= IMe4=1,3,4,5&#8208;tetramethylimidazol&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene) catalyzed reduction of CO2 with amines and arylsilane, which proceeds via its Lewis basic nature. In contrast, the Lewis acid nature of 1 is utilized in the catalyzed hydroboration and cyanosilylation of carbonyls, thus highlighting the versatile ambiphilic nature of bis&#8208;NHC stabilized germyliumylidenes.

         <title>Gold(I)&#8208;Catalyzed Intermolecular Formal [4+2] Cycloaddition of O&#8208;Aryl Ynol Ethers and Enol Ethers: Synthesis of Chromene Derivatives</title>

Two electron&#8208;rich unsaturated substrates such as O&#8208;aryl ynol ethers and enol ethers react in the presence of gold(I) catalyst through an intermolecular formal [4+2] cycloaddition to give chromene derivatives. The reaction takes place under mild conditions, and the process is regio&#8208; and stereoselective. The transformation shows high versatility for both substrates, including terminal or internal O&#8208;aryl ynol ethers, as well as cyclic, acyclic or silyl enol ethers.







Abstract
Gold(I)&#8208;catalyzed formal [4+2] cycloaddition of O&#8208;aryl ynol ethers 1 and enol ethers 2 is described. This intermolecular reaction between two electron&#8208;rich unsaturated systems takes place, under mild conditions, in the presence of 5&#8197;mol% [IPrAu(CH3CN)]SbF6 as catalyst giving chromene derivatives with good yields. The cycloaddition is completely regio&#8208; and stereoselective, as well as versatile for both reactives. Silyl enol ethers can also react in the same way and under the same reaction conditions with quantitative yields. A plausible mechanism through a selective addition of the enol ether to the alkyne gold activated complex followed by an intramolecular aromatic electrophilic substitution is proposed. Several experimental results support the presence of a cationic oxonium intermediate prior to the aromatic substitution. The reaction represents a new entry to the chromene core.

         <title>Cation Ordering and Exsolution in Copper&#8208;Containing Forms of the Flexible Zeolite Rho (Cu,M&#8208;Rho; M=H, Na) and Their Consequences for CO2 Adsorption</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 51, Page 13029-13039, September 9, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Copper cations favour 6&#8208;membered ring (6R) sites in dehydrated zeolite Rho, away from 8R windows that allow adsorption into lta cages. Exchange of Cu cations into Na&#8208;Rho, in which Na cations occupy 8R gating sites between the lta cages, improves CO2 uptake kinetics, while retaining some Na cations enhances CO2/CH4 selectivity. Upon dehydration, Cu,Na&#8208;Rho shows exsolution behaviour, because its framework can adopt distorted and undistorted forms that provide favourable coordination sites for Na and Cu cations, respectively.







Abstract
The flexibility of the zeolite Rho framework offers great potential for tunable molecular sieving. The fully copper&#8208;exchanged form of Rho and mixed Cu,H&#8208; and Cu,Na&#8208;forms have been prepared. EPR spectroscopy reveals that Cu2+ ions are present in the dehydrated forms and Rietveld refinement shows these prefer S6R sites, away from the d8r windows that control diffusion. Fully exchanged Cu&#8208;Rho remains in an open form upon dehydration, the d8r windows remain nearly circular and the occupancy of window sites is low, so that it adsorbs CO2 rapidly at room temperature. Breakthrough tests with 10&#8201;% CO2/40&#8201;% CH4 mixtures show that Cu4.9&#8208;Rho is able to produce pure methane, albeit with a relatively low capacity at this pCO2 due to the weak interaction of CO2 with Cu cations. This is in strong contrast to Na&#8208;Rho, where cations in narrow elliptical window sites enable CO2 to be adsorbed with high selectivity and uptake but too slowly to enable the production of pure methane in similar breakthrough experiments. A series of Cu,Na&#8208;Rho materials was prepared to improve uptake and selectivity compared to Cu&#8208;Rho, and kinetics compared to Na&#8208;Rho. Remarkably, Cu,Na&#8208;Rho with &gt;2 Cu cations per unit cell exhibited exsolution, due to the preference of Na cations for narrow S8R sites in distorted Rho and of Cu cations for S6R sites in the centric, open form of Rho. The exsolved Cu,Na&#8208;Rho showed improved performance in CO2/CH4 breakthrough tests, producing pure CH4 with improved uptake and CO2/CH4 selectivity compared to that of Cu4.9&#8208;Rho.

         <title>NIR&#8208;II Fluorescent Brightness Promoted by &#8220;Ring Fusion&#8221; for the Detection of Intestinal Inflammation</title>

Bright, even at longer wavelengths: A &#8220;ring&#8208;fusion&#8221; approach is proposed to adjust the emission wavelength from the NIR&#8208;I to NIR&#8208;II region with enhanced total brightness of the fluorophore. Theoretical calculation confirms that our strategy can efficiently narrow the energy gap and lower the reorganization energy of the TTQP molecule, promoting sensitive fluorescent angiography and diagnosis of intestinal inflammation. This molecular design strategy thus is promising to enrich the library of NIR&#8208;II fluorophores for versatile bioimaging studies.







Abstract
Fluorophores with emission in the second near&#8208;infrared window (NIR&#8208;II) have displayed salient advantages for biomedical applications. However, the common strategy of reducing the energy bandgap of fluorophores so as to achieve red&#8208;shifted wavelengths always leads to compromised fluorescent brightness. Herein, we propose a molecular design concept of &#8220;ring&#8208;fusion&#8221; to modify the acceptor of AIEgen that can extend the luminous wavelength from NIR&#8208;I to NIR&#8208;II. The fused&#8208;acceptor&#8208;containing fluorophore yielded, TTQP, has an enhanced absorption coefficient with a higher brightness in nanoparticle formation compared to its NIR&#8208;I emissive counterpart (TTQ&#8208;DP) with a non&#8208;fused acceptor. Theoretical calculation further confirms that the ring fusion can efficiently promote the rigidity and planarity of the electron&#8208;deficient core, leading to a lower reorganization energy and nonradiative decay. The TTQP NPs yielded thus allow sensitive NIR&#8208;II fluorescence imaging of vasculature and intestinal inflammation in mice models. Therefore, we anticipate that our work will provide a promising molecular&#8208;engineering strategy to enrich the library and broaden the application scope of NIR&#8208;II fluorophores.

         <title>Access to Indole&#8208;Fused Benzannulated Medium&#8208;Sized Rings through a Gold(I)&#8208;Catalyzed Cascade Cyclization of Azido&#8208;Alkynes</title>

Golden keys close the loop: Starting from phenylene&#8208;tethered azido&#8208;alkynes, pharmaceutically relevant indole&#8208;fused benzannulated eight&#8208;membered rings were constructed by exploiting &#945;&#8208;imino gold(I) carbenes as key intermediates for the gold(I)&#8208;catalyzed cascade reaction. The necessity of the C&#8208;dtbm ligand for the cyclization to a more challenging nine&#8208;membered ring is also demonstrated.







Abstract
Because benzannulated and indole&#8208;fused medium&#8208;sized rings are found in many bioactive compounds, combining these fragments might lead to unexplored areas of biologically relevant and uncovered chemical space. Herein is shown that &#945;&#8208;imino gold carbene chemistry can play an important role in solving the difficulty in the formation of medium&#8208;sized rings. Namely, phenylene&#8208;tethered azido&#8208;alkynes undergo arylative cyclization through the formation of a gold carbene intermediate to afford benzannulated indole&#8208;fused medium&#8208;sized tetracycles. The reactions allow a range of different aryl substitution patterns and efficient access to these otherwise difficult&#8208;to&#8208;obtain medium&#8208;sized rings. This study also demonstrates the feasibility of the semihollow&#8208;shaped C&#8208;dtbm ligand for the construction of a nine&#8208;membered ring.

A novel method of electrochemical oxidation cleavage of indole derivatives and reorganization with alcohols to construct a variety of useful o&#8208;amidobenzoate building blocks was developed. The reaction involves a mild and easy handling protocol that occurs without any stoichiometric metals and extra oxidants. N&#8208;unprotected indoles or indoles substituted with electron&#8208;withdrawing groups, even free indole could give the desired product, which expanded the substrate range.







Abstract
A novel electrochemical protocol for the oxidative cleavage of indoles has been developed, which o&#64256;ers a simple way to access synthetically useful anthranilic acid derivatives. In undivided cells, a wide variety of indoles and alcohol compounds are examined to a&#64256;ord amide ester aromatics without using extra oxidants and stoichiometric metal catalysts, which avoids the formation of undesired by&#8208;products and exhibits high atom economy. The products we described in this perspective represent a synthetic intermediate in numerous drug molecules and industrial chemical reagents and remarkably show potential application in the future.

         <title>Ionic Liquids [M3+][A&#8722;]3 with Three&#8208;Valent Cations and Their Possible Use to Easily Separate Rare Earth Metals</title>

Alkyl polyethylene oxide carboxylates allow for simple and safe synthesis of polyvalent ionic liquids with &#8216;naked&#8217; rare earth metals without the need of additional complexation. The direct interactions between the ions produce strong ion&#8208;specific properties despite the similarities between lanthanides. Proof of concept experiments highlight the feasibility of rare earth metal separation in liquid/liquid separation.







Abstract
We introduce a simple way to liquify rare earth metals (REM) by incorporating the corresponding cations, in particular Eu3+, La3+, and Y3+, into polyvalent ionic liquids (ILs). In contrast to conventional methods, this is achieved not by transforming them into anionic complexes, but by keeping them as bare cations and combining them with convenient, cheap and commercially available anions (A) in the form [REM3+][A&#8722;]3. To do so, we follow the COncept of Melting Point Lowering due to EThoxylation (COMPLET) with alkyl polyethylene oxide carboxylates as anions. We provide basic properties, such as glass transition temperatures, viscosities, electrical conductivities, as well as water&#8208;octanol partition constants P and show that these ILs have remarkably different properties, despite the similarity of their cations. In addition, we show that the ionic liquids possess interesting luminescent properties as non&#8208;conventional fluorophores.

         <title>Dicyano&#8208;Imidazole: A Facile Generation of Pure Blue TADF Materials for OLEDs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 51, Page 12998-13008, September 9, 2021. </description>

The efficiencies of the blue&#8208;emissive devices with imM&#8208;SPAC and imM&#8208;DMAC obtained in this work are the highest among the reported imidazole&#8208;based TADF&#8208;OLEDs, which are 13.8&#8201;% and 13.4&#8201;%, respectively. Both of Commission Internationale de l&#8242;Eclairage (CIE) coordinates are close to the saturated blue region at (0.17, 0.18) and (0.16, 0.19), respectively. Combining these tailor&#8208;made TADF compounds with specific device architectures, electroluminescent (EL) emission from sky&#8208;blue to deep&#8208;blue could be achieved, proving their great potential in EL applications.







Abstract
A series of dicyano&#8208;imidazole&#8208;based molecules with thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) properties were synthesized to obtain pure blue&#8208;emitting organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs). The targeted molecules used dicyano&#8208;imidazole with a short&#8208;conjugated system as the electron acceptor to strong intermolecular &#960;&#8208;&#960; interactions, and provide a relatively shallow energy level of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO). The cyano group was selected to improve imidazole as an electron acceptor due to its prominent electron&#8208;transporting characteristics. Four different electron donors, that is, 9,9&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;9,10&#8208;dihydroacridine (DMAC), 10H&#8208;spiro(acridine&#8208;9,9&#8217;&#8208;fluoren) (SPAC), and 9,9&#8208;diphenyl&#8208;9,10&#8208;dihydroacridine (DPAC), were used to alternate the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy level to tune the emission color further.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A series of dicyano-imidazole-based molecules with thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) properties were synthesized to obtain pure blue-emitting organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs). The targeted molecules used dicyano-imidazole with a short-conjugated system as the electron acceptor to strong intermolecular &lt;i&gt;&#960;-&#960;&lt;/i&gt; interactions, and provide a relatively shallow energy level of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO). The cyano group was selected to improve imidazole as an electron acceptor due to its prominent electron-transporting characteristics. Four different electron donors, that is, 9,9-dimethyl-9,10-dihydroacridine (DMAC), 10&lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;-spiro(acridine-9,9&#8217;-fluoren) (SPAC), and 9,9-diphenyl-9,10-dihydroacridine (DPAC), were used to alternate the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy level to tune the emission color further. The crowded molecular structure in space makes the electron donor and acceptor almost orthogonal, reducing the energy gap (&#916;&lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;ST&lt;/sub&gt;) between the first excited singlet (S&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) and the triplet (T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) states and introducing significant TADF property. The efficiencies of the blue-emissive devices with &lt;b&gt;imM-SPAC&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;imM-DMAC&lt;/b&gt; obtained in this work are the highest among the reported imidazole-based TADF-OLEDs, which are 13.8&#8201;% and 13.4&#8201;%, respectively. Both of Commission Internationale de l&#8242;Eclairage (CIE) coordinates are close to the saturated blue region at (0.17, 0.18) and (0.16, 0.19), respectively. Combining these tailor-made TADF compounds with specific device architectures, electroluminescent (EL) emission from sky-blue to deep-blue could be achieved, proving their great potential in EL applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Although the field of MOF&#8208;polymer hybrid membranes and their application in gas storage and separation, catalysis, sensing, etc. is evolving quickly, many opportunities and challenges remain. This minireview summarizes recent advances in the optimization of the hybrid membrane structure and looks at the expansion of applications: the homogeneity, compatibility and structure&#8208;performance relationship between MOF and polymer, and membranes with dynamic structures that could be modulated by external stimuli so as to play a role in smart devices. For more information, see the Minireview by B. Chen et&#8197;al. on page&#8197;ff12940.

Synthetic polymer nanodiscs, structures that arise from amphipathic copolymers that capture membrane proteins (MPs) and surrounding phospholipids, offer a convenient detergent&#8208;free solution to the challenges associated with MP purification and analysis. Thereby they help to further our understanding of MP structure and activity and so aid rational drug design. For more information on the scope of possible analytical applications of polymer nanodiscs to the study of MPs and biomolecules, see the Review by M.&#8197;D. Farrelly, L.&#8197;L. Martin and S.&#8197;H. Thang on page&#8197;12922&#8201;ff.

The cover picture shows octapalladium metal strings catching a soccer ball of C60 or C70 fullerene in the central Pd&#8211;Pd junction to give metal&#8208;chain&#8208;wired bucky balls. The enantiopure chiral Pd8 strings also afforded the chiral bucky balls through dimensionally and chirality controlled self&#8208;assembly. These findings could provide a new platform for developing functional metal&#8208;carbon nanocomposite materials, including nano&#8208;electronics with unusual properties derived from the combination of redox active fullerenes and metal chains. More information can be found in the Communication by T. Tanase et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202102020).

Pure blue&#8208;emitting organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) based on dicyano&#8208;imidazole with thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) have been studied at Providence University (of which a building is shown). The efficiencies obtained in this work are the highest among the reported imidazole&#8208;based TADF&#8208;OLEDs. By combining these tailor&#8208;made TADF compounds with specific device architectures, electroluminescent emission from sky blue to deep blue could be achieved.

This work presents emissive Cr(0), Mo(0) and W(0) complexes that contain a bidentate pyridyl&#8208;mesoionic carbene ligand and CO coligands. These systems exhibit dual visible and NIRII emission at room temperature and represent a milestone in the design of noble&#8208;metal&#8208;free NIR luminophores. The emissive excited states were characterized by luminescence lifetime investigations and step&#8208;scan FTIR spectroscopy, supported by density functional theory. The NIR quantum yield increases from Cr(0) via Mo(0) to W(0), reaching a very high value at room temperature. More information can be found in the Communication by M. Gerhards, B. Sarkar et&#8197;al.

The NIR quantum yield increases from Cr(0) via Mo(0) to W(0), reaching a very high value at room temperature. More information can be found in the Communication by M. Gerhards, B. Sarkar et&#8197;al.

In this image, a golden compass guides the adventurer's way in an unknown chemical space. The compass leads the structures with one&#8208; and two&#8208;dimensional content towards those with an increased three&#8208;dimensional character. These three&#8208;dimensional compounds rise towards uncharted chemical space leaving the flatland behind, based on the cascade cyclization of alkynyl azides generating indole fused medium&#8208;sized rings.

Discovering discs: Although understanding membrane protein (MP) structure and activity is invaluable for rational drug design, challenges are associated with purification and analysis of MPs. Synthetic polymer nanodiscs, structures that arise from amphipathic copolymers capturing membrane proteins and surrounding phospholipids, offer a convenient detergent&#8208;free solution. This review explores the scope of possible analytical applications for polymer nanodiscs in the study of MPs and biomolecules.







Abstract
Membrane proteins (MPs) play a pivotal role in cellular function and are therefore predominant pharmaceutical targets. Although detailed understanding of MP structure and mechanistic activity is invaluable for rational drug design, challenges are associated with the purification and study of MPs. This review delves into the historical developments that became the prelude to currently available membrane mimetic technologies before shining a spotlight on polymer nanodiscs. These are soluble nanosized particles capable of encompassing MPs embedded in a phospholipid ring. The expanding range of reported amphipathic polymer nanodisc materials is presented and discussed in terms of their tolerance to different solution conditions and their nanodisc properties. Finally, the analytical scope of polymer nanodiscs is considered in both the demonstration of basic nanodisc parameters as well as in the elucidation of structures, lipid&#8211;protein interactions, and the functional mechanisms of reconstituted membrane proteins. The final emphasis is given to the unique benefits and applications demonstrated for native nanodiscs accessed through a detergent free process.

Greater than the sum of their parts: MOF/polymer hybrid materials and membranes can not only inherit the individual component's properties but also lead to some collaboratively enforced functions. This Minireview outlines some design strategies of MOF&#8208;polymer hybrid membranes and their structure&#8208;function relationship, and highlights some significant recent advances in MOF&#8208;polymer hybrid membrane, particularly on their application in separation, conduction, and sensing.







Abstract
The fabrication of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art membranes with customized functions and high efficiency is of great significance, but presents challenges. Emerging metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs)/polymer hybrid membranes have provided bright promise as an innovative platform to target multifunctional hybrid materials and devices; this is thanks to their unique properties, which come from three components that are collaboratively enforced. This minireview provides a brief overview of recent progress in the construction of such hybrid membranes, and highlights some of their very important applications in separation, conduction, and sensing.

A III&#8211;V quantum dots (QDs) chemistry platform is presented. III&#8208;nitrides QDs are prepared in short residence times in a one&#8208;step continuous process involving supercritical solvents. InxGa1&#8208;xN QDs fabricated via this platform exhibit strong photoluminescence with continuous bandgap shift towards lower energies measured when increasing indium content. The chemistry platform proposed could be easily transferred to other binary and ternary III&#8211;V systems source.







Abstract
A chemistry platform for the fast continuous synthesis of III&#8211;V quantum dots is demonstrated. III&#8208;nitride QDs are prepared by using short residence times (less than 30&#8197;s) in a one&#8208;step continuous process with supercritical solvents. GaN QDs prepared via this route exhibit strong UV photoluminescence with a structuring of the emission signal at low temperature (5&#8197;K), confirming their high quality. An example of metal site substitution is given with the synthesis of InxGa1&#8208;xN solid solution. A continuous bandgap shift towards lower energies is demonstrated when increasing the indium content with strong photoluminescence signals from UV to visible. The chemistry platform proposed could be easily extrapolated to binary and ternary III phosphides or arsenides with the homologous V source.

         <title>Octapalladium Strings Trap C60 and C70 Fullerenes Affording Metal&#8208;Chain&#8208;Wired Bucky Balls</title>

Ball and chain: The Pd8 strings supported by the linear tetraphosphines meso&#8208; and rac&#8208;dpmppm, [Pd8(meso&#8208; or rac&#8208;dpmppm)4(L)2](BF4)4 trap a C60 or C70 fullerene molecule in the central Pd&#8211;Pd junction, exclusively affording the unprecedented metal&#8208;chain&#8208;wired bucky balls, [{Pd4(meso&#8208; or rac&#8208;dpmppm)2(L)}2(C60 or 70)]X4 (L=CH3CN, XylNC; X=TfO, BF4), through chirality&#8208;controlled self&#8208;assembly.







Abstract
Reactions of Pd8 strings supported by meso&#8208;Ph2PCH2P(Ph)CH2P(Ph)CH2PPh2 (meso&#8208;dpmppm) ligands, [Pd8(meso&#8208;dpmppm)4(L)2]4+ (L=CH3CN (1), XylNC (2)) with C60 resulted in the exclusive formation of unprecedented metal&#8208;chain&#8208;wired C60 bucky balls, [{Pd4(meso&#8208;dpmppm)2(L)}2(C60)]4+ (L=CH3CN (11), XylNC (12)), in which a C60 fullerene is trapped in the central Pd&#8211;Pd junction, as unambiguously established by spectroscopic, X&#8208;ray crystallographic, and theoretical techniques. The similar reaction of Pd8 strings supported by rac&#8208;dpmppm, [Pd8(rac&#8208;dpmppm)4(CH3CN)2]4+ (3) also afforded a racemic mixture of [{Pd4((R*,R*)&#8208;dpmppm)2(CH3CN)}2(C60)]4+ (13) without scrambling the Pd4 fragments with (R,R)&#8208; and (S,S)&#8208;dpmppm ligands. Consequently, those of enantiopure chiral Pd8 strings, [Pd8((R*,R*)&#8208;dpmppm)4(CH3CN)2]4+, certainly afforded chiral bucky balls of [{Pd4((R*,R*)&#8208;dpmppm)2(CH3CN)}2(C60)]4+ (13RR and 13SS), that exhibit mirror&#8208;image circular dichroism spectra. The reactions of 1 and 2 were also applied for trapping a C70 fullerene to give 2&#8201;:&#8201;1 adducts of [{Pd4(meso&#8208;dpmppm)2(L)}2(C70)]4+ (L=CH3CN (21), XylNC (22)). These results provide useful information for creating a platform to develop dimensionally and chirality controlled metal&#8211;carbon nanocomposite materials.

         <title>ChemBead Enabled High&#8208;Throughput Cross&#8208;Electrophile Coupling Reveals a New Complementary Ligand</title>

Shaken, not stirred: Coating reductants onto glass beads simplifies &#956;mol&#8208;scale cross&#8208;electrophile coupling, enabling the rapid survey of 222 different reactions and the discovery of a new, useful catalyst. Although the reactions are heterogeneous, the glass beads enable the use of shakers instead of complex micro stirrers.







Abstract
High&#8208;throughput experimentation (HTE) methods are central to modern medicinal chemistry. While many HTE approaches to C&#8722;N and Csp2&#8722;Csp2 bonds are available, options for Csp2&#8722;Csp3 bonds are limited. We report here how the adaptation of nickel&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;electrophile coupling of aryl bromides with alkyl halides to HTE is enabled by AbbVie ChemBeads technology. By using this approach, we were able to quickly map out the reactivity space at a global level with a challenging array of 3&#215;222 micromolar reactions. The observed hit rate (56&#8201;%) is competitive with other often&#8208;used HTE reactions and the results are scalable. A key to this level of success was the finding that bipyridine 6&#8208;carboxamidine (BpyCam), a ligand that had not previously been shown to be optimal in any reaction, is as general as the best&#8208;known ligands with complementary reactivity. Such &#8220;cryptic&#8221; catalysts may be common and modern HTE methods should facilitate the process of finding these catalysts.

This work presents emissive Cr(0), Mo(0), and W(0) complexes that contain a bidentate pyridyl&#8208;mesoionic carbene ligand and CO coligands. These systems exhibit dual vis and NIR II emissions at room temperature. The emissive excited triplet states were characterized by temperature&#8208;dependent luminescence and step&#8208;san FTIR spectroscopy in combination with density functional theory. The NIR quantum yield increases from Cr(0) over Mo(0) to W(0), reaching a very high value of 1.4&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;10&#8722;3 at room temperature.







Abstract
The development of NIR emitters based on earth&#8208;abundant elements is an important goal in contemporary science. We present here Cr(0), Mo(0), and W(0) carbonyl complexes with a pyridyl&#8208;mesoionic carbene (MIC) based ligand. A detailed photophysical investigation shows that all the complexes exhibit dual emissions in the VIS and in the NIR region. The emissive excited states are assigned to two distinct triplet states by time&#8208;resolved emission and step&#8208;scan FTIR spectroscopy at variable temperature, supported by density functional theory. In particular, the NIR emissive triplet state exhibits unprecedented lifetimes of up to 600&#177;10&#8197;ns and quantum yields reaching 1.7&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;10&#8722;4 at room temperature. These are the first examples of Cr(0), Mo(0) and W(0) complexes that emit in the NIR II region.

         <title>Controlling Antibacterial Activity Exclusively with Visible Light: Introducing a Tetra&#8208;ortho&#8208;Chloro&#8208;Azobenzene Amino Acid</title>

A novel photoswitchable amino acid has provided access to tyrocidine&#8197;A analogues fully operated under visible light. This has led to linear analogues that have shown good photoswitchability and strain selectivity against A. baumannii and S. pyogenes clinical strains by using different analogues. Activated cis compounds turn back to their deactivated trans form upon short exposure times to sunlight, paving the way to self&#8208;deactivating antibacterials with minor evolutionary pressure on the environment.







Abstract
The introduction of a novel tetra&#8208;ortho&#8208;chloroazobenzene amino acid (CEBA) has enabled photoswitching of the antimicrobial activity of tyrocidine&#8197;A analogues by using exclusively visible light, granting spatiotemporal control under benign conditions. Compounds bearing this photoswitchable amino acid become active upon irradiation with red light, but quickly turn&#8208;off upon exposure to other visible light wavelengths. Critically, sunlight quickly triggers isomerisation of the red light&#8208;activated compounds into their original trans form, offering an ideal platform for self&#8208;deactivation upon release into the environment. Linear analogues of tyrocidine&#8197;A were found to provide the best photocontrol of their antimicrobial activity, leading to compounds active against Acinetobacter baumannii upon isomerisation. Exploration of their N&#8208; and C&#8208;termini has provided insights into key elements of their structure and has allowed obtaining new antimicrobials displaying excellent strain selectivity and photocontrol.

         <title>KCs2[Pb2Br5(HCOO)2]: A Polar 3D Lead&#8208;Bromide Framework Exhibiting Strong Second&#8208;Harmonic Generation Response</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 51, Page 12976-12980, September 9, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
KCs2[Pb2Br5(HCOO)2] possessing strong second&#8208;harmonic generation (SHG) response, large birefringence, and a wide transparent window in most visible light and mid&#8208;IR region, has been obtained by the combination of [HCOO] groups and lead bromides. Interestingly, KCs2[Pb2Br5(HCOO)2] features a polar 3D lead&#8208;bromide framework in which adjacent Pb&#8722;Br layers containing coplanar Pb6Br6 rings not only parallel to each other, but also orient in the same direction. These oriented arrangements are responsible for the strong SHG response and large birefringence that are elucidated by both local dipole moment and theoretical calculations.







Abstract
The discovery of new nonlinear optical (NLO) crystals with excellent properties is in urgently demand because of their ability to generate coherent light. Herein, we report an unique NLO lead bromide formate, KCs2[Pb2Br5 (HCOO)2], which has been synthesized by a mix&#8208;solvothermal method. KCs2[Pb2Br5(HCOO)2] exhibits strong phase&#8208;matching second&#8208;harmonic generation (SHG) response (6.5&#215;KDP), large birefringence (0.16@ 1064&#8197;nm), and a wide transparent window in most visible light and mid&#8208;IR region. Interestingly, KCs2[Pb2Br5(HCOO)2] features a polar 3D lead&#8208;bromide framework in which adjacent Pb&#8722;Br layers containing coplanar Pb6Br6 rings are not only parallel to each other, but also orient in the same direction. These oriented arrangements are responsible for the strong SHG response and large birefringence that are elucidated by both local dipole moment and theoretical calculations. This research provides a new strategy to explore subsequent NLO crystals.

         <title>Pd&#8208;Catalysed Decarbonylation Free Approach to Carbonylative Esterification of 5&#8208;HMF to Its Aryl Esters Synthesis Using Aryl Halides and Oxalic Acid as C1 Source</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 51, Page 12971-12975, September 9, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aldehyde unaffected: Selective carbonylative esterification of 5&#8208;HMF was achieved on a polystyrene&#8208;supported palladium (Pd@PS) catalyst with aryl halides as coupling partner. Using oxalic acid as a solid and environmentally benign CO source avoided the need for highly sophisticated equipment to trap CO gas. A series of aryl esters of 5&#8208;HMF were synthesized in good&#8208;to&#8208;moderate yield by overcoming the issue of decarbonylation.







Abstract
A decarbonylation free, polystyrene&#8208;supported, Pd (Pd@PS)&#8208;catalysed carbonylative esterification of the hydroxy group of 5&#8208;hydroxymethyl furfural (5&#8208;HMF) to its corresponding aryl esters has been developed. The use of Pd@PS, oxalic acid as CO source, and aryl halides was first explored for the aryl ester of 5&#8208;HMF synthesis. Here, we investigated the vital role of a polystyrene support to avoid the commonly known decarbonylation of 5&#8208;HMF. The reaction exhibits vast substrate scope with comparably good yield and catalyst recyclability.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A review with 349 references discussing recent advances in the chemistry of saturated boronic acids, boronates, and trifluoroborates. Applications of the title compounds in design of boron&#8208;containing drugs are surveyed, with special emphasis on a&#8208;amino boronic derivatives. A general overview of saturated boronic compounds as the modern tools to construct C(  sp  3  )&#8211;C and C(  sp  3  ) &#8211; heteroatom bonds is given, including recent developments in the Suzuki &#8211; Miyaura and Chan &#8211; Lam cross&#8208;couplings, single&#8208;electron transfer processes including metallo&#8208; and organocatalytic photoredox reactions, and transformations of boron &#8216;ate&#8217; complexes. Finally, an attempt to summarize the current state&#8208;of&#8208;art in the synthesis of saturated boronic acids, boronates, and trifluoroborates is made, with brief mentioning of the &#8216;classical&#8217; methods (transmetallation of organolithium/magnesium reagents with boron species, anti&#8208;Markovnikov hydroboration of alkenes, and modification of alkenyl boron compounds) and special focus on the recent methodologies (boronation of alkyl (pseudo)halides, derivatives of carboxylic acids, alcohols, and primary amines, boronative C&#8211;H activation, novel approaches to alkene hydro&#173;boration, and 1,2&#8208;metallate&#8208;type rearrangements).</dc:description>

         <title>Continuous Flow Acylation of (Hetero)aryllithiums with Polyfunctional N,N&#8208;Dimethylamides and Tetramethylurea in Toluene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
N,N&#8208;Dimethylamides for continuous flow acylations: A new acylation of (hetero)aryllithiums with polyfunctional and enolizable N,N&#8208;dimethylamides in toluene in continuous flow was reported. The required lithium species was prepared at 25&#8201;&#176;C from (hetero)aryl bromides and sec&#8208;BuLi in toluene. Additionally, a new telescoped procedure, using tetramethylurea as C1&#8208;building block, was described providing highly functionalized unsymmetrical ketones.







Abstract
The continuous flow reaction of various aryl or heteroaryl bromides in toluene in the presence of THF (1.0&#8197;equiv) with sec&#8208;BuLi (1.1&#8197;equiv) provided at 25&#8201;&#176;C within 40&#8197;sec the corresponding aryllithiums which were acylated with various functionalized N,N&#8208;dimethylamides including easily enolizable amides at &#8722;20&#8201;&#176;C within 27&#8197;sec, producing highly functionalized ketones in 48&#8211;90&#8201;% yield (36 examples). This method was well suited for the preparation of &#945;&#8208;chiral ketones such as naproxene and ibuprofen derived ketones with 99&#8201;% ee. A one&#8208;pot stepwise bis&#8208;addition of two different lithium organometallics to 1,1,3,3&#8208;tetramethyurea (TMU) provided unsymmetrical ketones in 69&#8211;79&#8201;% yield (9 examples).

The required lithium species was prepared at 25&#8201;&#176;C from (hetero)aryl bromides and &lt;i&gt;sec&lt;/i&gt;-BuLi in toluene. Additionally, a new telescoped procedure, using tetramethylurea as C1-building block, was described providing highly functionalized unsymmetrical ketones.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The continuous flow reaction of various aryl or heteroaryl bromides in toluene in the presence of THF (1.0&#8197;equiv) with &lt;i&gt;sec&lt;/i&gt;-BuLi (1.1&#8197;equiv) provided at 25&#8201;&#176;C within 40&#8197;sec the corresponding aryllithiums which were acylated with various functionalized &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-dimethylamides including easily enolizable amides at &#8722;20&#8201;&#176;C within 27&#8197;sec, producing highly functionalized ketones in 48&#8211;90&#8201;% yield (36 examples). This method was well suited for the preparation of &#945;-chiral ketones such as naproxene and ibuprofen derived ketones with 99&#8201;% &lt;i&gt;ee&lt;/i&gt;. A one-pot stepwise bis-addition of two different lithium organometallics to 1,1,3,3-tetramethyurea (TMU) provided unsymmetrical ketones in 69&#8211;79&#8201;% yield (9 examples).&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Self&#8208;Propelling Hybrid Gels Incorporating an Active Self&#8208;Assembled, Low&#8208;Molecular&#8208;Weight Gelator</title>

Motion capture: Gel beads that incorporate a self&#8208;assembled low&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight gelator (LMWG) into an agarose polymer gel particle are reported; when loaded with ethanol and placed in water, they self&#8208;propel as a result of the Marangoni effect. The presence of the LMWG significantly increases their mobility and endows them with unique functions, such as enhanced ability to adsorb a pollutant dye.







Abstract
Hybrid gel beads based on combining a low&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight gelator (LMWG) with a polymer gelator (PG) demonstrate an enhanced ability to self&#8208;propel in water, with the LMWG playing an active role. Hybrid gel beads were loaded with ethanol and shown to move in water owing to the Marangoni effect changes in surface tension caused by the expulsion of ethanol &#8211; smaller beads move farther and faster than larger beads. Flat shapes of the hybrid gel were cut using a &#8220;stamp&#8221; &#8211; circles moved the furthest, whereas stars showed more rotation on their own axes. Comparing hybrid LMWG/PG gel beads with PG&#8208;only beads demonstrated that the LMWG speeds up the beads, enhancing the rate of self&#8208;propulsion. Self&#8208;assembly of the LMWG into a &#8220;solid&#8208;like&#8221; network prevents its leaching from the gel. The LMWG also retains its own unique function &#8211; specifically, remediating methylene blue pollutant dye from basic water as a result of noncovalent interactions. The mobile hybrid beads accumulate this dye more effectively than PG&#8208;only beads. Self&#8208;propelling gel beads have potential applications in removal/delivery of active agents in environmental or biological settings. The ability of self&#8208;assembling LMWGs to enhance mobility and control removal/delivery suggests that adding them to self&#8208;propelling systems can add significant value.

         <title>Contorted Heteroannulated Tetraareno[a,d,j,m]coronenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tuning tetraarenocoronenes: Cata&#8208;condensed heteroannulated tetraarenocoronenes with C2h symmetry have been obtained from three doubly brominated diarenoperylenes. X&#8208;ray diffraction showed that the coronenes mostly adopt S&#8208;shaped contorted &#960;&#8208;planes. The large variety of fused rings in the coronenes&#8242; core allows good control of their photophysical properties and thus their potential use in organic electronics applications.







Abstract
Fused polycyclic aromatic compounds are interesting materials for organic electronics applications. To fine&#8208;tune photophysical or electrochemical properties, either various substituents can be attached or heteroatoms (such as N or S) can be incorporated into the fused aromatic backbone. Coronenes and heterocoronenes are promising compounds in this respect. Up until now, the possibilities for varying the attached fused heteroaromatics at the coronene core were quite limited, and realizing both electron&#8208;withdrawing and &#8208;donating rings at the same time was very difficult. Here, a series of pyridine, anisole and thiophene annulated tetraareno[a,d,j,m]coronenes has been synthesized by a facile two&#8208;step route that is a combination of Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling and a following cyclization step, starting from three different diarenoperylene dibromides. The contorted molecular &#960;&#8208;planes of the obtained cata&#8208;condensed tetraarenocoronenes were analyzed by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray crystallography, and the photophysical and electrochemical properties were systematically investigated by UV/Vis spectroscopy and cyclovoltammetry.

         <title>A Small&#8208;Molecule Diketopyrrolopyrrole&#8208;Based Dye for in&#8197;vivo NIR&#8208;IIa Fluorescence Bioimaging</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Based on the small&#8208;molecule DPP&#8208;based fluorophore T25 with NIR&#8208;II and NIR&#8208;IIa emission, T25@F127 were selected for fluorescence angiography and cerebral vascular microscopic imaging of mice with nearly 800&#8197;&#956;m penetrating depth and excellent signal&#8208;background ratio of 4.07 and 2.26 (at 250 and 400&#8197;&#956;m), respectively. Furthermore, T25@cRGD with tumor targeting ability could image tiny metastatic tumor on intestine with a small size of 0.3&#8197;mm&#215;1.0&#8197;mm.







Abstract
Organic small&#8208;molecule fluorophores with near&#8208;infrared IIa (NIR&#8208;IIa) emission have great potential in pre&#8208;clinical detection and inoperative imaging due to the high&#8208;spatial resolution and deep penetration. However, developments of the NIR&#8208;IIa fluorophores are still facing considerable challenges. In this work, a series of diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP)&#8208;based fluorophores were designed and synthesized. Subsequently, nanomaterial T25@F127 with significant NIR&#8208;IIa emission properties was rationally prepared by encapsulating DPP&#8208;based fluorophore T25, and was selected for fluorescence angiography and cerebral vascular microscopic imaging with nearly 800&#8197;&#956;m penetrating depth and excellent signal&#8208;background ratio of 4.07 and 2.26 (at 250 and 400&#8197;&#956;m), respectively. Furthermore, the nanomaterial T25@cRGD with tumor targeting ability can image tiny metastatic tumor on intestine with a small size of 0.3&#8197;mm&#215;1.0&#8197;mm and high&#8208;spatial resolution (SBR=3.84). This study demonstrates that the nanomaterials which encapsulated T25 behave as excellent NIR&#8208;IIa fluorescence imaging agents and have a great potential for in&#8197;vivo biological application.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A method for the selective tryptophan modification and labelling of tryptophan&#8208;containing peptides is described. Photoirradiation of acylsilanes generates reactive siloxycarbenes which undergo H&#173;&#8211;N&#8208;insertion into the indole moiety of tryptophan to give stable silyl protected hemiaminals. This method is successfully applied to chemically modify various tryptophan containing oligopeptides. The method enables the selective introduction of alkynes to peptides that are eligible for further alkyne&#8208;azide click chemistry. In addition, the dansyl fluorophore can be conjugated to a peptide using this approach.</dc:description>

Controlled thermolysis of HKUST&#8208;1 produces the partial removal of ligands, the generation of structural defects and additional porosity in a controlled way. The resulting defective materials denoted according to the literature as quasi&#8208;MOFs, were subsequently employed as catalyst for one pot imine synthesis by cross coupling of alcohols with amines.







Abstract
Copper&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic framework (Cu3(BTC)2(H2O)3]n&#8901;nH2OMeOH (HKUST&#8208;1) has been subjected to thermolysis under air atmosphere at different temperatures ranging from 100 to 300&#8201;&#176;C. This treatment produces the partial removal of ligands, the generation of structural defects and additional porosity in a controlled way. The resulting defective materials denoted according to the literature as quasi&#8208;MOFs, were subsequently employed as heterogeneous catalysts in the one pot synthesis of N&#8208;benzylideneaniline from aniline and benzyl alcohol in open air as terminal oxidant at 70&#8201;&#176;C under base&#8208; and dehydrating agent&#8208;free conditions. The Q&#8208;HKUST catalysts calcined at 240&#8201;&#176;C (QH&#8208;240) was the most efficient in the series, promoting imine synthesis. Data from Knoevenagel condensation of malononitrile shows that in QH&#8208;240 the distances of Cu ions in HKUST&#8208;1 cavities are preserved, increasing the Knoevenagel activity, but a strong rearrangement takes place at 300&#8201;&#176;C or above. The unsaturated copper active sites with simultaneous presence of micro&#8208; and mesopores in QH&#8208;240 are responsible for this excellent catalytic performance. The effective parameters on catalytic activity of QH&#8208;240 including deligandation temperature, the amount of catalyst, the ratio of reactants, and reaction temperature as well as the stability and recyclability of the catalyst were also investigated. The possible mechanism used by QH&#8208;240 follows alcohol aerobic oxidation and subsequent anaerobic condensation of aldehyde intermediate with aniline.

         <dc:description>The interaction of molecules, especially hydrocarbons, at the gas/ionic liquid (IL) surface plays a crucial role in supported IL catalysis. The dynamics of this process is investigated by measuring the trapping probabilities of  n&#8208;  butane,  iso&#8208;  butane and 1&#8209;butene on a set of frozen 1&#8209;alkyl&#8208;3&#8209;methylimidazolium&#8208;based ILs [C  n  C  1  Im]X, where  n  =&#160;4, 8 and X  &#8208;  =&#160;Cl  &#8208;  , Br  &#8208;  , [PF  6  ]  &#8208;  and [Tf  2  N]  &#8208;  . The decrease of the initial trapping probability with increasing surface temperature is used to determine the desorption energy of the hydrocarbons at the IL surfaces. It increases with increasing alkyl chain length  n  and decreasing anion size for the ILs studied. We attribute these effects to different degrees of alkyl chain surface enrichment, while interactions between the adsorbate and the anion do not play a significant role. The adsorption energy also depends on the adsorbing molecule: It decreases in the order  n  &#8208;butane &gt; 1&#8209;butene &gt;  iso&#8208;  butane, which can be explained by different dispersion interactions.</dc:description>

         <title>The introduction of a cysteine residue modulates the mechanical properties of aromatic&#8208;based solid aggregates and self&#8208;supporting hydrogels</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Peptide&#8208;based hydrogels, originated by multiscale self&#8208;assembling phenomenon, have been proposed as multivalent tools in different technological areas. Structural studies and molecular dynamics simulations pointed out the capability of completely aromatic peptides to gelificate if hydrophilic and hydrophobic forces are opportunely balanced. Here we evaluated the effect produced by the introduction of a Cys residue in the heteroaromatic sequence of (FY)3 and in its PEGylated variant. The physicochemical characterization indicates that both FYFCFYF and PEG8&#8208;FYFCFYF are able to self&#8208;assemble in supramolecular nanostructures whose basic cross&#8208;&#946; motif resembles the one detected in the ancestor (FY)3 assemblies. However, gelification occurs only for FYFCFYF at a concentration of 1.5 wt%. After cross&#8208;linking of cysteine residues, the hydrogel undergoes to an improvement of the rigidity compared to the parent (FY)3 assemblies as suggested by the storage modulus (G&#8217;) that increases from 970 to 3360 Pa. The mechanical properties of FYFCFYF are compatible with its potential application in bone tissue regeneration. Moreover, the avalaibility of a Cys residue in the middle of the peptide sequence could allow the hydrogel derivatization with targeting moieties or with biologically relevant molecules.</dc:description>

         <title>The Catalytic Mechanism of the Retaining Glycosyltransferase Mannosylglycerate Synthase</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The mannosylglycerate synthase from the extremophile Rhodothermus marinus is a retaining glycosyltransferase able to synthesize a variety of small negatively charged molecules called compatible solutes. These molecules confer protection against extreme conditions such as extremely high or low temperatures, pH, and high salinity. Therefore, it has exciting potential biotechnological applications.







Abstract
To protect their intracellular proteins, extremophile microorganisms synthesize molecules called compatible solutes. These molecules are the result of the attachment of a small negatively charged molecule to a sugar molecule. It has been found that these molecules, not only protect the microorganism against osmotic stress but also against other extreme conditions. They can also confer protection against extreme conditions to isolated enzymes from different organisms making them an exciting prospect for potential biotechnological applications. One of the most widespread compatible solute in hyperthermophile organisms is the molecule 2&#8208;O&#8208;&#945;&#8208;D&#8208;mannosyl&#8208;D&#8208;glycerate (MG). In addition to confer protection to proteins against extreme conditions, MG was found to prevent Alzheimer's &#946;&#8208;amyloid aggregation and reduce &#945;&#8208;synuclein fibril formation in Parkinson's disease. In this work we studied, using computational methods, the catalytic mechanism of the synthesis of MG by the enzyme mannosylglycerate synthase (MGS) from the thermophilic bacteria Rhodothermus marinus.

Repair and reuse: The recovery of waste LiCoO2 material is realized by the combination of industrial machinery process and small&#8208;scale equipment repair technology. The results showed that the crystal structure of the material was repaired with the excellent electrochemical performance.







Abstract
A large number of lithium batteries have been retiring from the market of energy storage. Thus, recycling of the used electrode materials is becoming urgent. In this study, an industrial machinery processing was used to recover the crystal structure of the waste LiCoO2 materials with the combination of small&#8208;scale equipment repair technology.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Repair and reuse&lt;/b&gt;: The recovery of waste LiCoO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; material is realized by the combination of industrial machinery process and small-scale equipment repair technology. The results showed that the crystal structure of the material was repaired with the excellent electrochemical performance.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A large number of lithium batteries have been retiring from the market of energy storage. Thus, recycling of the used electrode materials is becoming urgent. In this study, an industrial machinery processing was used to recover the crystal structure of the waste LiCoO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; materials with the combination of small-scale equipment repair technology. The results show that the crystal parameters of the repaired LiCoO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; material become small, the unit cell volume is reduced, and the crystal structure tends to be stable. The Co&#8722;O bond length of 1.9134&#8197;nm, O&#8722;Co&#8722;O bond angle of 94.72&#176;, the (003) interplanar spacing of 0.467&#8197;nm indicate the excellent recovery level of the repaired LiCoO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. In addition, the electrochemical performance of the repaired LiCoO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; material is greatly improved, compared with the waste material. The capacity of the repaired electrode material can be maintained at 120&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; after 100 cycles at the current density of 0.2C. The promising rate performance of the repaired electrode material demonstrates the stable structure. This research work provides a large-scale method for the direct recovery of LiCoO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; with the reduction of unnecessary energy and reagent consumption, which will be beneficial to the environmental protection.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Atypical and Asymmetric 1,3&#8208;P,N Ligands: Synthesis, Coordination and Catalytic Performance of Cycloiminophosphanes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Complexes, chirality and catalysts: 1,3&#8208;P,N hybrid ligands are broadly applied in cooperative catalysis, but show limited electronic variation. We report novel analogues with a high N&#8208;basicity, based on 7&#8208;membered cyclic imines. Their transition metal complexes demonstrated their donor strength (W), hemilabile coordination (Rh), and catalytic activity for nitrile hydration (Ru) and transfer hydrogenation (Ru, Ir). Chiral derivatives were also obtained, synthesized from l&#8208;menthone.







Abstract
Novel seven&#8208;membered cyclic imine&#8208;based 1,3&#8208;P,N ligands were obtained by capturing a Beckmann nitrilium ion intermediate generated in situ from cyclohexanone with benzotriazole, and then displacing it by a secondary phosphane under triflic acid promotion. These &#8220;cycloiminophosphanes&#8221; possess flexible non&#8208;isomerizable tetrahydroazepine rings with a high basicity; this sets them apart from previously reported iminophophanes. The donor strength of the ligands was investigated by using their P&#8208;&#954;1&#8208; and P,N&#8208;&#954;2&#8208;tungsten(0) carbonyl complexes, by determining the IR frequency of the trans&#8208;CO ligands. Complexes with [RhCp*Cl2]2 demonstrated the hemilability of the ligands, giving a dynamic equilibrium of &#954;1 and &#954;2 species; treatment with AgOTf gives full conversion to the &#954;2 complex. The potential for catalysis was shown in the RuII&#8208;catalyzed, solvent&#8208;free hydration of benzonitrile and the RuII&#8208; and IrI&#8208;catalyzed transfer hydrogenation of cyclohexanone in isopropanol. Finally, to enable access to asymmetric catalysts, chiral cycloiminophosphanes were prepared from l&#8208;menthone, as well as their P,N&#8208;&#954;2&#8208;RhIII and a P&#8208;&#954;1&#8208;RuII complexes.

Here we describe an efficient trifluoromethoxylative substitution, using an inexpensive and easy&#8208;to&#8208;handle reagent. By mixing DMAP with a slight excess of 1,4&#8208;dinitro&#8208;trifluoromethoxybenzene (DNTFB), a stable solution of trifluoromethoxide anion is obtained and can be used to perform a SN2 reaction without any silver additives. A precise study of the properties and behavior of this unusual stable solution of CF3O&#8208; species is also performed.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Oligonucleotides Containing Trans Mitomycin C DNA Adducts at N6 of Adenine and N2 of Guanine</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A route to access modified oligonucleotides containing trans dA monoadducts produced from the reaction between mitomycin C and DNA is presented. Parent oligonucleotides containing a trans dG monoadduct and a trans dG&#8208;MC&#8208;dG ICL were also produced. The stability and spectral properties of all substrates were compared and virtual models were created to explore the conformational space and structural features of these MC&#8208;DNA complexes.







Abstract
Mitomycin C, (MC), an antitumor drug, is a DNA alkylating agent currently used in the clinics. Inert in its native form, MC is reduced to reactive mitosenes, which undergo nucleophilic attack by guanine or adenine bases in DNA to form monoadducts as well as interstrand crosslinks (ICLs). Although ICLs are considered the most cytotoxic lesions, the role of each individual adduct in the drug's cytotoxicity is still not fully understood. Synthetic routes have been developed to access modified oligonucleotides containing dG MC&#8208;monoadducts and dG&#8208;MC&#8208;dG ICL at a single position of their base sequences to investigate the biological effects of these adducts. However, until now, oligonucleotides containing monoadducts formed by MC at the adenine base had not been available, thus preventing the examination of the role played by these lesions in the toxicity of MC. Here, we present a route to access these substrates. Structural proof of the adducted oligonucleotides were provided by enzymatic digestion to nucleosides and high&#8208;resolution mass spectral analysis. Additionally, parent oligonucleotides containing a dG monoadduct and a dG&#8208;MC&#8208;dG ICL were also produced. The stability and physical properties of all substrates were compared via CD spectroscopy and UV melting temperature studies. Finally, virtual models were created to explore the conformational space and structural features of these MC&#8208;DNA complexes.

         <title>Monocyclometalated (C&#8201;N) Gold(III) Metallacycles: Tunable Emission and Singlet Oxygen (1O2) Generation Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Gold(III) metallacycles. Monocyclometalated gold(III) metallacycles with tunable emission properties have been demonstrated. The complexes show highly emissive triplet excited states (T1) with long excited state lifetimes. The T1 of the complexes and the triplet excited state of dioxygen (3O2) lie in a delicate balance resulting in an efficient quenching of these triplet states to generate 1O2. The first use case of monocyclometalated gold(III) complexes to generate 1O2 photochemically is demonstrated.







Abstract
The synthesis, characterization and photoluminescent properties of four cyclometalated (C&#8201;N)&#8208;type gold(III) complexes bearing a bidentate diacetylide ligand, tolan&#8208;2,2&#8217;&#8208;diacetylide (tda), are reported. The complexes exhibit highly tunable excited state properties and show photoluminescence (PL) across the entire visible spectrum from sky&#8208;blue (&#955;PL=493&#8197;nm) to red (&#955;PL=675&#8197;nm) with absolute PL quantum yields (PLQY) of up to 75&#8201;% in solution, the highest PLQY found for any monocyclometalated Au(III) complex in solution. As a consequence of the use of the strongly rigidifying diacetylide bidentate ligand, a significant increase in the excited state lifetimes (&#964;0=16&#8211;258 &#956;s) was found in solution and in thin films. The complexes showed remarkable singlet oxygen generation in aerated solution with absolute singlet oxygen quantum yield (&#981;1&#916;) values reaching up to 7.5&#215;10&#8722;5 and singlet oxygen lifetimes (&#964;01&#916;) in the range of 66&#8211;95 &#956;s. Furthermore, the radiative and non&#8208;radiative rates of singlet oxygen were determined using the &#981;1&#916; and &#964;01&#916; values and correlations are drawn between the formation of singlet oxygen and its interaction with cyclometalated (C&#8201;N) gold(III) complexes.

The complexes showed remarkable singlet oxygen generation in aerated solution with absolute singlet oxygen quantum yield (&#981;&lt;sup&gt;1&#916;&lt;/sup&gt;) values reaching up to 7.5&#215;10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;5&lt;/sup&gt; and singlet oxygen lifetimes (&#964;&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;1&#916;&lt;/sup&gt;) in the range of 66&#8211;95 &#956;s. Furthermore, the radiative and non-radiative rates of singlet oxygen were determined using the &#981;&lt;sup&gt;1&#916;&lt;/sup&gt; and &#964;&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;1&#916;&lt;/sup&gt; values and correlations are drawn between the formation of singlet oxygen and its interaction with cyclometalated (C&#8201;N) gold(III) complexes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Diazophosphonates: Effective Surrogates for Diazoalkanes in Pyrazole Synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Starring in a triple role&#8230; Diazophosphonates are excellent 1,3&#8208;dipoles in both inter&#8208; and intramolecular cycloadditions with alkynes to give N&#8208;H pyrazoles. The phosphoryl group has three key roles: its electron&#8208;withdrawing nature stabilizes the diazo compound, its unexploited propensity to migrate readily in sigmatropic rearrangements facilitates its transfer from C to N in the initial cycloadduct, and hence it is easily removed from the final pyrazole product.







Abstract
Diazophosphonates, readily prepared from &#945;&#8208;ketophosphonates by oxidation of the corresponding hydrazones in batch or in flow, are useful partners in 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloaddition reactions to alkynes to give N&#8208;H pyrazoles, including the first intramolecular examples of such a process. The phosphoryl group imbues a number of desirable properties into the diazo 1,3&#8208;dipole. The electron&#8208;withdrawing nature of the phosphoryl stabilizes the diazo compound making it easier to handle, whilst the ability of the phosphoryl group to migrate readily in a [1,5]&#8208;sigmatropic rearrangement enables its transfer from C to N to aromatize the initial cycloadduct, and hence its facile removal from the final pyrazole product. Overall, the diazophosphonate acts as a surrogate for the much less stable diazoalkane in cycloadditions, with the phosphoryl group playing a vital, but traceless, role. The cycloaddition proceeds more readily with alkynes bearing electron&#8208;withdrawing groups, and is regiospecific with asymmetrical alkynes. The potential of diazophosphonates for use in bioorthogonal cycloadditions is demonstrated by their facile addition to strained alkynes.

         <title>Platinum Indolylphosphine Fluorido and Polyfluorido Complexes: An Interplay between Cyclometallation, Fluoride Migration, and Hydrogen Bonding</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fluorine on Skatole's scent. Tetramethylammoniumfluoride permits the twofold cyclometallation of 3&#8208;methyl&#8208;2&#8208;indolylphosphine ligands at platinum(ii) complexes. Hydrogen fluoride opens the cyclometallation yielding a unique Pt(ii) complex which exhibits hydrogen&#8208;bonding to the fluorido ligand in its outer coordination sphere. The fluorido complex reacts with an ynamide to give an exceptional metal bound oxazole derivative.







Abstract
The reaction of [PtCl2(COD)] (COD=1,5&#8208;cyclooctadiene) with diisopropyl&#8208;2&#8208;(3&#8208;methyl)indolylphosphine (iPr2P(C9H8N)) led to the formation of the platinum(ii) chlorido complexes, cis&#8208;[PtCl2{iPr2P(C9H8N)}2] (1) and trans&#8208;[PtCl2{iPr2P(C9H8N)}2] (2). The cis&#8208;complex 1 reacted with NEt3 yielding the complex cis&#8208;[PtCl{&#954;2&#8208;(P,N)&#8208;iPr2P(C9H7N)}{iPr2P(C9H8N)}] (3) bearing a cyclometalated &#954;2&#8208;(P,N)&#8208;phosphine ligand, while the isomer 2 with a trans&#8208;configuration did not show any reactivity towards NEt3. Treatment of 1 or 3 with (CH3)4NF (TMAF) resulted in the formation of the twofold cyclometalated complex cis&#8208;[Pt{&#954;2&#8208;(P,N)&#8208;iPr2P(C9H7N)}2] (4). The molecular structures of the complexes 1&#8211;4 were determined by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. The fluorido complex cis&#8208;[PtF{&#954;2&#8208;(P,N)&#8208;iPr2P(C9H7N)}{iPr2P(C9H8N)}]&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;(HF)4 (5&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;(HF)4) was formed when complex 4 was treated with different hydrogen fluoride sources. The Pt(ii) fluorido complex 5&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;(HF)4 exhibits intramolecular hydrogen bonding in its outer coordination sphere between the fluorido ligand and the NH group of the 3&#8208;methylindolyl moiety. In contrast to its chlorido analogue 3, complex 5&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;(HF)4 reacted with CO or the ynamide 1&#8208;(2&#8208;phenylethynyl)&#8208;2&#8208;pyrrolidinone to yield the complexes trans&#8208;[Pt(CO){&#954;2&#8208;(P,C)&#8208;iPr2P(C9H7NCO)}{iPr2P(C9H8N)}][F(HF)4] (7) and a complex, which we suggest to be cis&#8208;[Pt{C=C(Ph)OCN(C3H6)}{&#954;2&#8208;(P,N)&#8208;iPr2P(C9H7N)}{iPr2P(C9H8N)}][F(HF)4] (9), respectively. The structure of 9 was assigned on the basis of DFT calculations as well as NMR and IR data. Hydrogen bonding of HF and NH to fluoride was proven to be crucial for the existence of 7 and 9.

         <title>Target&#8208;Dependent Protection of DNA Aptamers against Nucleolytic Digestion Enables Signal&#8208;On Biosensing with Toehold&#8208;Mediated Rolling Circle Amplification</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Digestion protection: a fluorescence assay is demonstrated based on target&#8208;mediated protection of aptamers from 3&#8242;&#8208;exonuclease digestion by phi29 DNA polymerase followed by toehold mediated strand displacement of the target by a circular template to initiate rolling circle amplification, providing sub&#8208;nanomolar detection limits for protein targets, including in serum and plasma.







Abstract
We report a generalizable strategy for biosensing that takes advantage of the resistance of DNA aptamers against nuclease digestion when bound with their targets, coupled with toehold mediated strand displacement (TMSD) and rolling circle amplification (RCA). A DNA aptamer containing a toehold extension at its 5&#8242;&#8208;end protects it from 3&#8242;&#8208;exonuclease digestion by phi29 DNA polymerase (phi29 DP) in a concentration&#8208;dependent manner. The protected aptamer can participate in RCA in the presence of a circular template that is designed to free the aptamer from its target via TMSD. The absence of the target leads to aptamer digestion, and thus no RCA product is produced, resulting in a turn&#8208;on sensor. Using two different DNA aptamers, we demonstrate rapid and quantitative real&#8208;time fluorescence detection of two human proteins: platelet&#8208;derived growth factor (PDGF) and thrombin. Sensitive detection of PDGF was also achieved in human serum and human plasma, demonstrating the selectivity of the assay.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Digestion protection&lt;/b&gt;: a fluorescence assay is demonstrated based on target-mediated protection of aptamers from 3&#8242;-exonuclease digestion by phi29 DNA polymerase followed by toehold mediated strand displacement of the target by a circular template to initiate rolling circle amplification, providing sub-nanomolar detection limits for protein targets, including in serum and plasma.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We report a generalizable strategy for biosensing that takes advantage of the resistance of DNA aptamers against nuclease digestion when bound with their targets, coupled with toehold mediated strand displacement (TMSD) and rolling circle amplification (RCA). A DNA aptamer containing a toehold extension at its 5&#8242;-end protects it from 3&#8242;-exonuclease digestion by phi29 DNA polymerase (phi29 DP) in a concentration-dependent manner. The protected aptamer can participate in RCA in the presence of a circular template that is designed to free the aptamer from its target via TMSD. The absence of the target leads to aptamer digestion, and thus no RCA product is produced, resulting in a turn-on sensor. Using two different DNA aptamers, we demonstrate rapid and quantitative real-time fluorescence detection of two human proteins: platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) and thrombin. Sensitive detection of PDGF was also achieved in human serum and human plasma, demonstrating the selectivity of the assay.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>The Role of Common Alcoholic Sacrificial Agents in Photocatalysis: Is it Always Trivial?</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photocatalytic hydrogen production is proposed as a sustainable energy source. Simultaneous reduction and oxidation of water is a complex multistep reaction with high overpotential. Photocatalytic processes involving semiconductors transfer electrons from the conduction band to the valence band. Sacrificial substrates that react with the photochemically formed holes in the conduction band are often used to study the mechanism of H2  production, as they scavenge the holes and hinder the charge carrier recombination. The desired sacrificial agent is one forming a radical that is a fairly strong reducing agent, and that its oxidized form is not a good electron acceptor that might suppress the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). In an acidic medium, methanol was found better to fulfill both these requirements than ethanol and 2&#8208;propanol in the TiO2  &#8208;(M0  &#8208;NPs) (M = Au or Pt) system, while in an alkaline medium, the alcohols exhibit a reverse order of activity. Moreover, we report that CH2(OH)2  is by far the most efficient sacrificial agent in a non&#8208;trivial mechanism in acidic media. Our study provides general guidelines for choosing an appropriate sacrificial substrate and helps to explain the variance in the performance of alcohol scavengers&#8208;based photocatalytic systems.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Herein, we report a detailed structural, electric, thermal and optical analysis of a titanium and tantalum phosphate LiNaTiTa  2  P  2  O  13  . The title compound is comprised of typical ReO  3  &#8208;type layers constituted by corner&#8208;sharing TiO  6  and TaO  6  octahedra, bridged by PO  4  tetrahedra, which is closely related to monophosphate niobium bronzes. The existence of pentagonal tunnels, hosting the Li  +  and Na  +  ions, endow LiNaTiTa  2  P  2  O  13  a moderate ion transportation behavior (4.67&#215;10  &#8208;4  S/cm at 823 K). In addition, the successful substitution of Nb for Ta in LiNaTiTa  2  P  2  O  13  results in the optical absorption red&#8208;shift towards visible range with a narrowing band gap, which may provide a route of isomorphic replacement to band engineering for photo&#8208;catalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Synergistic Effects of Co and Fe on the OER activity of LaCoxFe1&#8722;xO3</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In a combined experimental and theoretical study we assess the role of Co incorporation on the OER activity of LaCo  x  Fe  1&#8722;  x  O  3  . Phase pure perovskites were synthesized up to  x  = 0.300 in 0.025/0.050 steps. HAADF STEM and EDX analysis points towards FeO2  &#8208;terminated (001)&#8208;facets of LaFeO3, in accordance with the stability diagram obtained from density functional theory calculations with a Hubbard  U  term (DFT+  U  ). Linear sweep voltammetry shows a reduction of the OER overpotential and a nonmonotonic trend wtih  x  , with double layer capacitance measurements indicating an intrinsic nature of activity. This is supported by DFT+  U  results that show reduced overpotentials for both Fe and and Co reaction sites with the latter reaching values of 0.32&#8208;0.40 V, ~0.3 V lower than for Fe.&#160;This correlates with a stronger reduction of the binding energy difference of the *O and&#160; *OH intermediates towards an optimum value of 1.6 eV for  x  =0.25, the OH deprotonation being the potential limiting step in most cases. Significant variations of the magnetic moments of both surface and subsurface Co and Fe during the OER demonstrate that the beneficial effect is a result of a concerted action involving many surrounding ions, which extends the concept of the active site.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The combination of a peptide catalyst and a gold catalyst is presented for enantioselective addition reactions between allenamides and branched aldehydes. The two catalysts act in concert to provide &#947;,&#948;&#8208;enamide aldehydes bearing a fully substituted, benzylic stereogenic center &#8211; a structural motif common in many natural products and therapeutically active compounds &#8211; with good yields and enantioselectivities. The reaction tolerates a variety of alkyl and alkoxy aldehydes and the products can be elaborated into several chiral building blocks bearing either 1,4&#8208; or 1,5&#8208; functional group relationships. Mechanistic studies showed that the conformational features of the peptide are important for both the catalytic efficiency and stereochemistry, while a fine balance of acid/base additives is key for ensuring formation of the desired product over undesired side reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Expanding the Chemical Space of Tetracyanobuta&#8208;1,3&#8208;diene (TCBD) through a Cyano&#8208;Diels&#8208;Alder Reaction: Synthesis, Structure, and Physicochemical Properties of an Anthryl&#8208;fused&#8722;TCBD Derivative</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Tetracyanobuta&#8208;1,3&#8208;diene (TCBD) is a powerful and versatile electron&#8208;acceptor moiety widely used for the preparation of electroactive conjugates. While many reports addressing its electron&#8208;accepting capability have appeared in the literature, significantly scarcer are those dealing with its chemical modification, a relevant topic which allows to broaden the chemical space of this interesting functional unit. Here, we report on the first example of a high&#8208;yielding cyano&#8208;Diels&#8208;Alder (CDA) reaction between TCBD (i.e., where a nitrile group acts as a dienophile) and an anthryl moiety (i.e., acting as a diene). The resulting anthryl&#8208;fused&#8722;TCBD derivative, which structure was unambiguously identified by X&#8208;ray diffraction, shows high thermal stability, remarkable electron&#8208;accepting capability, and interesting electronic ground&#8208; and excited&#8208;state features, as characterized by a thorough theoretical, electrochemical and photophysical investigation. Moreover, a detailed kinetic analysis of the intramolecular CDA reaction transforming the anthryl&#8722;TCBD&#8208;based reactant into the anthryl&#8208;fused&#8722;TCBD product was carried out at different temperatures.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Tetracyanobuta-1,3-diene (TCBD) is a powerful and versatile electron-acceptor moiety widely used for the preparation of electroactive conjugates. While many reports addressing its electron-accepting capability have appeared in the literature, significantly scarcer are those dealing with its chemical modification, a relevant topic which allows to broaden the chemical space of this interesting functional unit. Here, we report on the first example of a high-yielding cyano-Diels-Alder (CDA) reaction between TCBD (i.e., where a nitrile group acts as a dienophile) and an anthryl moiety (i.e., acting as a diene). The resulting anthryl-fused&#8722;TCBD derivative, which structure was unambiguously identified by X-ray diffraction, shows high thermal stability, remarkable electron-accepting capability, and interesting electronic ground- and excited-state features, as characterized by a thorough theoretical, electrochemical and photophysical investigation. Moreover, a detailed kinetic analysis of the intramolecular CDA reaction transforming the anthryl&#8722;TCBD-based reactant into the anthryl-fused&#8722;TCBD product was carried out at different temperatures.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Divergent Synthesis of Molecular Winch Prototypes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report the synthesis of conceptually new prototypes of molecular winches with the ultimate aim to investigate the work performed by a single ruthenium&#8208;based molecular motor anchored on a surface by probing its ability to pull a load upon electrically&#8208;driven directional rotation. According to a technomimetic design, the motor was embedded in a winch structure, with a long flexible polyethylene glycol chain terminated by an azide hook to connect a variety of molecular loads. The structure of the motor was first derivatized by means of two sequential cross&#8208;coupling reactions involving a penta(4&#8208;halogenophenyl)cyclopentadienyl hydrotris(indazolyl)borate ruthenium(II) precursor and the resulting benzylamine derivative was next exploited as key intermediate in the divergent synthesis of a family of nanowinch prototypes. A one&#8208;pot method involving sequential peptide coupling and Cu&#8208;catalyzed azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition was developed to yield four loaded nanowinches, with load fragments encompassing triptycene, fullerene and porphyrin moieties.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis and Characterisation of Luminescent [CrIII2L(&#956;&#8208;carboxylato)]3+ Complexes with High&#8208;Spin S = 3 Ground States (L = N6S2 donor ligand)</title>

         <dc:description>The synthesis, structure, magnetic, and photophysical properties of two dinuclear, luminescent, mixed&#8208;ligand [Cr  III  2  L(O  2  CR)]  3+  complexes (R = CH  3  (  1  ), Ph (  2  )) of a 24&#8208;membered binucleating hexa&#8208;aza&#8208;dithiophenolate macrocycle (L)  2&#8722;  are presented. X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis reveals an edge&#8208;sharing bioctahedral N  3  Cr(  &#956;  &#8208;SR)  2  (  &#956;  1,3  &#8208;O  2  CR)CrN  3  core structure with  &#956;  1,3  &#8208;bridging carboxylate groups. A ferromagnetic superexchange interaction between the electron spins of the Cr  3+  ions leads to a high&#8208;spin (  S  = 3) ground state. The coupling constants (  J  = +24.2(1) cm  &#8722;1  (  1  ), +34.8(4) cm  &#8722;1  (  2  ), H = &#8722;2  J  S  1  S  2  ) are significantly larger than in related  bis  &#8208;  &#956;  &#8208;alkoxido&#8208;  &#956;  &#8208;carboxylato structures. DFT calculations performed on both complexes reproduce both the sign and strength of the exchange interactions found experimentally.

         <dc:description>New dinuclear Au(I), Au(II) and Au(III) complexes containing (CF  2  )  n  bridging chains were obtained. Metallomacrocycles [Au  2  {&#956;&#8208;(CF  2  )  4  }{&#956;&#8208;diphosphine}] show an uncommon figure&#8208;eight structure, whose helicity inversion barrier is influenced by aurophilic interactions and steric constraints imposed by the diphosphine. Halogenation of LAu(CF  2  )  4  AuL (L = PPh  3  , PMe  3  , (dppf)  1/2  , (binap)  1/2  ) gave [Au(II)]  2  species, some of which display unprecedented folded structures with Au&#8211;Au bonds. Aurophilic interactions facilitate this oxidation process by preorganizing the starting [Au(I)]  2  complexes and lowering its redox potential. The obtained [Au(II)]  2  complexes undergo thermal or photochemical elimination of R  3  PAuX to give Au(III) perfluorinated auracycles. Evidence of a radical mechanism for these decomposition reactions was obtained.</dc:description>

         <title>The Influence of Secondary Interactions on the [N&#8722;I&#8722;N]+ Halogen Bond</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Halogen bond&#8208;stabilized halonium ions are mild halenium transfer agents. The dependence of their reactivity on chelation, strain, steric hindrance and electrostatic interaction has been evaluated using NMR, DFT and kinetics experiments. The mechanistic analysis of the transfer is expected to provide a handle in the induction of stereoselectivity in electrophilic halogenations.







Abstract
[Bis(pyridine)iodine(I)]+ complexes offer controlled access to halonium ions under mild conditions. The reactivity of such stabilized halonium ions is primarily determined by their three&#8208;center, four&#8208;electron [N&#8722;I&#8722;N]+ halogen bond. We studied the importance of chelation, strain, steric hindrance and electrostatic interaction for the structure and reactivity of halogen bonded halonium ions by acquiring their 15N NMR coordination shifts and measuring their iodenium release rates, and interpreted the data with the support of DFT computations. A bidentate ligand stabilizes the [N&#8722;I&#8722;N]+ halogen bond, decreasing the halenium transfer rate. Strain weakens the bond and accordingly increases the release rate. Remote modifications in the backbone do not influence the stability as long as the effect is entirely steric. Incorporating an electron&#8208;rich moiety close by the [N&#8722;I&#8722;N]+ motif increases the iodenium release rate. The analysis of the iodine(I) transfer mechanism highlights the impact of secondary interactions, and may provide a handle on the induction of stereoselectivity in electrophilic halogenations.

         <title>A Water Soluble Pd2L4 Cage for Selective Binding of Neu5Ac</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The carbohydrate binding pocket of an organic soluble [Pd2L4]4+ cage could be equipped with guanidinium&#8208;terminating dendrons to give the water soluble [Pd2L4][NO3]16 cage. It was shown by means of NMR spectroscopy that the cage binds selectively to anionic monosaccharides and strongest to Neu5Ac with Ka=24&#8197;M&#8722;1. The cage had low to no affinity for the thirteen neutral saccharides studied.







Abstract
The sialic acid N&#8208;acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac) and its derivatives are involved in many biological processes including cell&#8208;cell recognition and infection by influenza. Molecules that can recognize Neu5Ac might thus be exploited to intervene in or monitor such events. A key obstacle in this development is the sparse availability of easily prepared molecules that bind to this carbohydrate in its natural solvent; water. Here, we report that the carbohydrate binding pocket of an organic soluble [Pd2L4]4+ cage could be equipped with guanidinium&#8208;terminating dendrons to give the water soluble [Pd2L4][NO3]16 cage 7. It was shown by means of NMR spectroscopy that 7 binds selectively to anionic monosaccharides and strongest to Neu5Ac with Ka=24&#8197;M&#8722;1. The cage had low to no affinity for the thirteen neutral saccharides studied. Aided by molecular modeling, the selectivity for anionic carbohydrates such as Neu5Ac could be rationalized by the presence of charge assisted hydrogen bonds and/or the presence of a salt bridge with a guanidinium solubilizing arm of 7. Establishing that a simple coordination cage such as 7 can already selectively bind to Neu5Ac in water paves the way to improve the stability, affinity and/or selectivity properties of M2L4 cages for carbohydrates and other small molecules.

Abstract
Novel multistimuli&#8208;responsive phosphine ligands comprising a redox&#8208;active [3]dioxaphosphaferrocenophane backbone and a P&#8208;bound imidazolin&#8208;2&#8208;ylidenamino entity that allows switching by protonation are reported. Investigation of the corresponding metal complexes and their redox behaviour are reported and show the sensitivity of the system towards protonation and metal coordination. The experimental findings are supported by DFT calculations. Protonation and oxidation events are applied in Rh&#8208;catalysed hydrosilylations and demonstrate a remarkable influence on reactivity and/or selectivity.

         <title>Effectiveness of the Oxygenation over Classical Protonolysis Reactions: A Case of Alkylzinc Complexes Incorporating an Aminoalcoholate Ligand</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The stepwise controlled oxygenation of a tert&#8208;butylzinc complex incorporating a pridinolum (prinol) ligand affords a dinuclear adduct of a (prinol)ZnOOR moiety with the parent tBuZn(prinol) complex and a novel dimer [tBuOOZn(prinol)]2 with terminal alkylperoxide groups. Strikingly, these seemingly simple zinc alkylperoxides and related zinc alkoxides are not accessible via the classical protonolysis route.







Abstract
Alkylzinc aminoalcoholates have emerged as powerful catalysts in organic synthesis and polymerization processes. Despite extensive research, difficulties in the rational design of these catalytic systems and in&#8208;depth understanding of their modes of action have hitherto been encountered. Most of the major obstacles stem largely from the relatively limited knowledge of the structure&#8208;activity relationship of zinc catalysts. In fact, the key active species are often generated in&#8197;situ via the protonolysis of the alkylzinc precursors, which precludes their isolation and detailed characterization. Herein, the effectiveness of the oxygenation over the classical protonolysis in the synthesis of zinc alkylperoxides stabilized by an aminoalcoholate ligand is demonstrated. The controlled oxygenation of a tert&#8208;butylzinc complex incorporating a pridinolum (prinol) ligand leads to well&#8208;defined a dinuclear adduct of a (prinol)ZnOOtBu moiety with the parent tBuZn(prinol) complex and a novel dimer [tBuOOZn(prinol)]2 with terminal alkylperoxide groups. The observed reaction outcomes strongly depend on the reaction conditions. Although sparse examples of heteroleptic adducts of the [RZn(L)]x[ROOZn(L)]y&#8208;type are known, the herein reported homoleptic [ROOZn(L)]x aggregate is unprecedented. Strikingly, comparative studies involving reactions between tBuZn(prinol) and tert&#8208;butylhydroperoxide or ethanol revealed that the respective seemingly simple zinc alkylperoxides, or zinc alkoxides, respectively, are not accessible via the classical alcoholysis. We believe that these game&#8208;changing results concerning multifaceted chemistry of organozinc aminoalcoholates should pave the way for more rational development of various Zn&#8208;based catalytic systems.

The controlled oxygenation of a &lt;i&gt;tert&lt;/i&gt;-butylzinc complex incorporating a pridinolum (&lt;i&gt;prinol&lt;/i&gt;) ligand leads to well-defined a dinuclear adduct of a (&lt;i&gt;prinol&lt;/i&gt;)ZnOO&lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;Bu moiety with the parent &lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;BuZn(&lt;i&gt;prinol&lt;/i&gt;) complex and a novel dimer [&lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;BuOOZn(&lt;i&gt;prinol&lt;/i&gt;)]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; with terminal alkylperoxide groups. The observed reaction outcomes strongly depend on the reaction conditions. Although sparse examples of heteroleptic adducts of the [RZn(L)]&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;[ROOZn(L)]&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;-type are known, the herein reported homoleptic [ROOZn(L)]&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; aggregate is unprecedented. Strikingly, comparative studies involving reactions between &lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;BuZn(&lt;i&gt;prinol&lt;/i&gt;) and &lt;i&gt;tert&lt;/i&gt;-butylhydroperoxide or ethanol revealed that the respective seemingly simple zinc alkylperoxides, or zinc alkoxides, respectively, are not accessible via the classical alcoholysis. We believe that these game-changing results concerning multifaceted chemistry of organozinc aminoalcoholates should pave the way for more rational development of various Zn-based catalytic systems.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Halogen&#8208;Bonding Strapped Porphyrin BODIPY Rotaxanes for Dual Optical and Electrochemical Anion Sensing</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first examples of porphyrin&#8208;BODIPY halogen bonding [2]rotaxanes have been prepared according to an active metal template strategy. Capitalising on the augmented anion affinities by virtue of axle triazole ligation to macrocyclic zinc(II) metalloporphyrin, the incorporation of fluorogenic BODIPY and redox&#8208;active porphyrin transducing groups allows dual&#8208;channel sensing of anions by quenching BODIPY emission and through cathodic perturbations of porphyrin oxidation redox couples.







Abstract
Anion receptors employing two distinct sensory mechanisms are rare. Herein, we report the first examples of halogen&#8208;bonding porphyrin BODIPY [2]rotaxanes capable of both fluorescent and redox electrochemical sensing of anions. 1H NMR, UV/visible and electrochemical studies revealed rotaxane axle triazole group coordination to the zinc(II) metalloporphyrin&#8208;containing macrocycle component, serves to preorganise the rotaxane binding cavity and dramatically enhances anion binding affinities. Mechanically bonded, integrated&#8208;axle BODIPY and macrocycle strapped metalloporphyrin motifs enable the anion recognition event to be sensed by the significant quenching of the BODIPY fluorophore and cathodic perturbations of the metalloporphyrin P/P+. redox couple.

Making a transfer: An iron&#8208;catalyzed, aerobic, biomimetic oxidation of various N&#8208;heterocycles by using the bifunctional hybrid catalyst Co(Salophen)&#8208;HQ as an electron&#8208;transfer mediator (ETM) is reported. The reaction provides various important aromatic heterocycles in good&#8208;to&#8208;excellent yields. The dehydrogenation involves several electron&#8208;transfer steps that are inspired by biological oxidation processes in which molecular oxygen (O2) is used as terminal oxidant.







Abstract
Herein, an iron(II)&#8208;catalyzed biomimetic oxidation of N&#8208;heterocycles under aerobic conditions is described. The dehydrogenation process, involving several electron&#8208;transfer steps, is inspired by oxidations occurring in the respiratory chain. An environmentally friendly and inexpensive iron catalyst together with a hydroquinone/cobalt Schiff base hybrid catalyst as electron&#8208;transfer mediator were used for the substrate&#8208;selective dehydrogenation reaction of various N&#8208;heterocycles. The method shows a broad substrate scope and delivers important heterocycles in good&#8208;to&#8208;excellent yields.

         <title>Impact of surface defects on LaNiO3 perovskite electrocatalysts for oxygen evolution reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Perovskite oxides are regarded as promising electrocatalysts for water splitting due to their cost&#8208;effectiveness, high efficiency and durability in the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Despite these advantages, a fundamental understanding of how critical structural parameters of perovskite electrocatalysts influences their activity and stability is lacking. Here, we investigate the impact of structural defects on OER performance for representative LaNiO  3  perovskite electrocatalysts. Hydrogen reduction of 700 &#176;C calcined LaNiO  3  induces a high density of surface oxygen vacancies, and confers significantly enhanced OER activity and stability compared to unreduced LaNiO  3  ; the former exhibit a low onset overpotential of  380 mV at 10 mA.cm  &#8208;2  and a small Tafel slope of 70.8 mV.dec  &#8208;1  . Oxygen vacancy formation is accompanied by mixed Ni  2+  /Ni  3+  valence states, which quantum&#8208;chemical DFT calculations reveal modify the perovskite electronic structure. Surface oxygen vacancy formation is relatively facile, and favoured over lattice vacancy formation, and increases the electronic conductivity of reduced LaNiO  3  , in accordance with the enhanced OER activity observed.</dc:description>

         <title>Water&#8208;Assisted Chemical Route Towards the Oxygen Evolution Reaction at the Hydrated (110) Ruthenium Oxide Surface: heterogeneous catalysis via DFT&#8208;MD&#160;&amp;&#160;metadynamics simulations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Notwithstanding RuO 2&#160; is one of the most active catalysts toward oxygen evolution reaction (OER), a plethora of fundamental details on its catalytic properties are still elusive, severely limiting its large&#8208;scale deployment. Herein, spin&#8208;polarized Density Functional Theory Molecular Dynamics (DFT&#8208;MD) simulations, coupled with advanced enhanced sampling methods in the well&#8208;tempered metadynamics framework, are applied to gain a global understanding of RuO 2&#160; aqueous interface (explicit water solvent) in catalyzing the OER, and hence possibly help in the design of novel catalysts in the context of photochemical water oxidation. The present study quantitatively assesses the free&#8208;energy barriers behind the OER at the (110)&#8208;RuO 2&#160; catalyst surface revealing plausible pathways composing the reaction network of the O 2&#160; evolution. In particular, OER is investigated at room temperature when such a surface is exposed to both gas&#8208;phase and liquid&#8208;phase water. Albeit a unique efficient pathway has been identified in the gas&#8208;phase OER, a surprisingly lowest&#8208;free&#8208;energy&#8208;requiring reaction route is possible when (110)&#8208;RuO 2&#160; is in contact with explicit liquid water. By estimating the free&#8208;energy surfaces associated to these processes, we reveal a&#160;water&#8208;assisted OER mechanism which involves a crucial proton&#8208;transfer&#8208;step assisted by the local water environment. These findings pave the way toward the systematic usage of those techniques for the fine assessment of the activity of catalysts, considering finite&#8208;temperature and explicit&#8208;solvent effects.</dc:description>

         <title>Pathway&#8208;Dependent Phase Transitions of Supramolecular Self&#8208;assemblies Containing Cationic Amphiphiles with Azobenzene and Disulfide Groups</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The original molecular crystals containing cationic amphiphiles with azobenzene and disulfide groups showed different phase transitions depending on the application order of a reduction agent and light irradiation. The current molecular system can provide a methodology for developing new stimuli&#8208;responsive materials that exhibit the desirable properties under specific circumstances from a systems chemistry viewpoint.







Abstract
There have been several attempts to construct supramolecular chemical systems that mimic the phase transitions in living systems. However, most of these phase transitions are one&#8208;to&#8208;one and induced by one stimulus or chemical; there have been few reports on the pathway&#8208;dependent phase transition of supramolecular self&#8208;assemblies in multi&#8208;step. To induce multistep phase transitions, molecular crystals were prepared that contained a cationic amphiphile bearing azobenzene and disulfide groups. A reducing agent caused the crystals to become vesicles, and adjacent, non&#8208;touching vesicles fused under UV and subsequent visible light. Adding a reducing agent to the worm&#8208;like aggregates that were generated after UV irradiation of the original crystals resulted in the growth of sheet&#8208;like aggregates. 1H NMR and fluorescence anisotropy measurements showed that a series of phase transitions was induced by changes in the phase structures from molecular conversions of the reactive amphiphiles. The multiple pathway&#8208;dependent phase transitions of supramolecular self&#8208;assemblies can provide a methodology for developing new stimuli&#8208;responsive materials that exhibit the desirable properties under specific circumstances from a systems chemistry viewpoint.

         <title>Ternary Hybrid Perovskite Solid Solution Single Crystals: Growth, Composition Determination and Phase Stability in Highly Moist Atmosphere</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two&#8208;centimeter&#8208;sized ternary hybrid perovskite solid solution single crystals have been grown. Wavelength disperse X&#8208;ray fluorescence is used as a quantitative elemental analysis method. The crystals with optimized composition show superior phase stability when they are stored in high&#8208;humidity environment for over two weeks, while those Cs&#8208;richer or Cs&#8208;poorer samples undergo various degrees of phase segregation induced by moisture.







Abstract
Ternary hybrid perovskite solid solutions have shown superior optoelectronic properties and better stability than their ABX3 simple perovskite counterparts under ambient conditions. However, crystal growth and identification of the accurate composition of these complex crystalline compounds remain challenging, and their stability under extreme conditions such as in highly moist atmosphere is unknown. Herein, large&#8208;size (up to 2&#8197;cm) single crystals of ternary perovskite 0.80FAPbI3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;x&#8242;FAPbBr3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;y&#8242;CsPbI3 (x&#8242;+y&#8242;=0.20) are grown. An elemental analysis method based on wavelength dispersive X&#8208;ray fluorescence is proposed to determine their accurate compositions. Among these single crystals, the composition with y&#8242;=0.12 shows the best moisture stability at 90&#8201;% relative humidity for 15&#8197;days. Other components with richer or poorer Cs+ ions undergo different phase segregation behaviours. The performance and stability of photodetectors based on these single crystals are tested. This work offers a deeper insight into phase stability of ternary hybrid perovskite solid solution crystals in highly moist atmosphere.

         <title>Oxidatively Induced Selective Carbon&#8208;Carbon Bond Formation From Isolated Rhodium(III) Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In the oxidation&#8208;induced reaction based on octahedral RhIII complexes synthesized from Rh2(TFA)4 with 2&#8208;arylpyridines, different regioselective C&#8722;C bond formations were achieved by changing the steric and electronic properties of the aryl ligands. This study provides feasible selective activation of C&#8722;H bonds by the oxidation induction of RhIII complexes, which may be useful for the design of new rhodium metal catalysts and development of efficient and highly selective reactions.







Abstract
This work focuses on oxidatively induced regioselective intramolecular C&#8722;C bond formations based on the RhIII complexes synthesized from dirhodium(II) trifluoroacetate with 2&#8208;arylpyridines. With the selection of electron&#8208;donating groups on the arene rings of 2&#8208;arylpyridines, the unusual meta&#8208;ortho C&#8722;C bond&#8208;forming was favored, which led to the formation of meta&#8208;substituted 2&#8208;arylpyridine homocoupling dimers. On the contrary, the electron&#8208;withdrawing groups have tendency to occur conventional ortho&#8208;ortho bond&#8208;forming, resulting in the formation of new RhIII complexes possessing the intriguing RhIII(TFA)3 fragment. Preliminary mechanistic experiments suggest that the sequential oxidation of RhIII occurred in the reaction.

         <title>Potassium Ion Conductivity in the Cubic Labyrinth of a Piezoelectric, Antiferromagnetic Oxoferrate(III) Tellurate(VI)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
K(nockout) response: K12+6xFe6Te4&#8722;xO27 was synthesized under hydroflux conditions. The acentric cubic crystal structure comprises two non&#8208;interpenetrating chiral oxometalate networks formed by edge&#8208; or corner&#8208;sharing [TeVIO6] and [FeIIIO5] polyhedra. The potassium ions are mobile in the labyrinth between the networks. The magnetic moments of the iron cations are pairwise antiparallel, and the compound exhibits a strong piezoelectric response.







Abstract
Orange&#8208;colored crystals of the oxoferrate tellurate K12+6xFe6Te4&#8722;xO27 [x=0.222(4)] were synthesized in a potassium hydroxide hydroflux with a molar water&#8211;base ratio n(H2O)/n(KOH) of 1.5 starting from Fe(NO3)3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;9H2O, TeO2 and H2O2 at about 200&#8201;&#176;C. By using (NH4)2TeO4 instead of TeO2, a fine powder consisting of microcrystalline spheres of K12+6xFe6Te4&#8722;xO27 was obtained. K12+6xFe6Te4&#8722;xO27 crystallizes in the acentric cubic space group I
3d. [FeIIIO5] pyramids share their apical atoms in [Fe2O9] groups and two of their edges with [TeVIO6] octahedra to form an open framework that consists of two loosely connected, but not interpenetrating, chiral networks. The flexibility of the hinged oxometalate network manifests in a piezoelectric response similar to that of LiNbO3.The potassium cations are mobile in channels that run along the &lt;111&gt; directions and cross in cavities acting as nodes. The ion conductivity of cold&#8208;pressed pellets of ball&#8208;milled K12+6xFe6Te4&#8722;xO27 is 2.3&#215;10&#8722;4 S&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at room temperature. Magnetization measurements and neutron diffraction indicate antiferromagnetic coupling in the [Fe2O9] groups.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of methodologies to control on demand and reversibly supramolecular transformations from self&#8208;assembled metalla&#8208;structures requires the rational design of architectures able to answer to an applied stimulus. While solvent, concentration, guest, light, addition of a chemical have been largely explored to provide these transformations, the case of pH sensitive materials is less described. Herein, we report the first example of a pH&#8208;triggered dissociation of a coordination&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembled interlocked molecular link. It incorporates a pH sensitive benzobisimidazole&#8208;based ligand that can be selectively protonated on its bisimidazole moieties. This generates intermolecular electrostatic repulsions that reduces drastically the stability of the interlocked structure, leading to its dissociation without any sign of protonation of the basic pyridine moieties involved in the coordination bonds. Importantly, the dissociation process is reversible through addition of a base.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>
Mis&#8208;matched: Air stable pentaphosphaferrocene or white phosphorus are used as polyphosphorus source to access molecular group 2 polyphosphides. Structurally diverse polyphosphides ranging supramolecular wheel to Zintl ions have been accessed by using various group 2 reagents such as organo&#8208;magnesium, mono&#8208;valent magnesium or molecular calcium hydride complex. The ancillary ligands and the metal ions influences the structural motifs of the polyphosphides, which was investigated theoretically as well.







Abstract
A series of molecular group 2 polyphosphides has been synthesized by using air&#8208;stable [Cp*Fe(&#951;5&#8208;P5)] (Cp*=C5Me5) or white phosphorus as polyphosphorus precursors. Different types of group 2 reagents such as organo&#8208;magnesium, mono&#8208;valent magnesium, and molecular calcium hydride complexes have been investigated to activate these polyphosphorus sources. The organo&#8208;magnesium complex [(DippBDI&#8722;Mg(CH3))2] (DippBDI={[2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3NCMe]2CH}&#8722;) reacts with [Cp*Fe(&#951;5&#8208;P5)] to give an unprecedented Mg/Fe&#8208;supramolecular wheel. Kinetically controlled activation of [Cp*Fe(&#951;5&#8208;P5)] by different mono&#8208;valent magnesium complexes allowed the isolation of Mg&#8208;coordinated formally mono&#8208; and di&#8208;reduced products of [Cp*Fe(&#951;5&#8208;P5)]. To obtain the first examples of molecular calcium&#8208;polyphosphides, a molecular calcium hydride complex was used to reduce the aromatic cyclo&#8208;P5 ring of [Cp*Fe(&#951;5&#8208;P5)]. The Ca&#8208;Fe&#8208;polyphosphide is also characterized by quantum chemical calculations and compared with the corresponding Mg complex. Moreover, a calcium coordinated Zintl ion (P7)3&#8722; was obtained by molecular calcium hydride mediated P4 reduction.

Through a new method of low&#8208;temperature (only 350&#8201;&#176;C) self&#8208;reduction, a highly efficient deep blue&#8208;emitting phosphor Ca[B8O11(OH)4]&#8201;:&#8201;Eu2+ was prepared, with a high PLQY of 95&#8201;% and a color purity of 97.6&#8201;%. Then, a WLED fabricated by the as&#8208;prepared CBH&#8201;:&#8201;2&#8201;%Eu2+ presents outstanding performance with a luminous efficacy (LE) of 13.9&#8197;lm/W, a color rendering index (CRI) of 89.4, and a correlated color temperature (CCT) of 5825&#8197;K.







Abstract
Highly efficient inorganic phosphors are crucial for solid&#8208;state lighting. In this paper, a new method of low&#8208;temperature self&#8208;reduction was used for preparing a highly efficient deep blue&#8208;emitting phosphor of Ca[B8O11(OH)4]&#8201;:&#8201;Eu2+ (CBH&#8201;:&#8201;Eu2+). The crystal structure, morphology, chemical state, and photoluminescence (PL) properties of the CBH&#8201;:&#8201;Eu2+ phosphor have been investigated. By using the screened hybrid function (HSE06), the band gap (Eg) of CBH was calculated to be 7.48&#8197;eV, which is a necessary condition for achieving high quantum yield phosphors. The experiment results show that almost all the added raw materials of Eu3+ can be reduced to Eu2+ in CBH crystal under a non&#8208;reducing atmosphere. The CBH&#8201;:&#8201;Eu2+ phosphor shows a broad excitation spectrum centered at 277 and 327&#8197;nm in the range of 220 to 400&#8197;nm, and a narrow&#8208;band emission spectrum centered at 428&#8197;nm in the range of 400 to 500&#8197;nm, with a full width at half maximum (fwhm) of 42.35&#8197;nm. Under UV radiation, the CBH&#8201;:&#8201;2&#8201;%Eu2+ exhibits high photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY=95.0&#8201;%), high external quantum efficiency (EQE=31.1&#8201;%), and ultra&#8208;high color purity (97.6&#8201;%). The PL intensity of CBH&#8201;:&#8201;2&#8201;%Eu2+ remains 62.6&#8201;% of the initial intensity at 150&#8201;&#176;C. Finally, the white light&#8208;emitting diodes (WLED) fabricated by CBH&#8201;:&#8201;2&#8201;%Eu2+, excited by a 365&#8197;nm chip, presents outstanding performances with a luminous efficacy (LE) of 13.9 lm/W, a color rendering index (CRI) of 89.4, and a correlated color temperature (CCT) of 5825&#8197;K. The above results show that CBH&#8201;:&#8201;Eu2+ can be used as a promising blue phosphor for WLED. This new method of low&#8208;temperature self&#8208;reduction can be applied to design and prepare other new types of highly efficient phosphors.

         <title>Unveiling the Role of Hydrogen Bonds in Luminescent N&#8208;Annulated Perylene Liquid Crystals</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>

Getting into position: The position of hydrogen&#8208;bonding amide groups affects the properties of a series of luminescent N&#8208;annulated perylenes that self&#8208;assemble into nanostructured liquid&#8208;crystalline columnar phases. The liquid crystals with the amide linkers close to the central perylene core exhibit liquid&#8208;crystalline phases with a wider temperature range. In contrast, perylenes with ester groups, instead of amides, close to the central core exhibit vapochromism upon exposure to organic solvents.







Abstract
We report the liquid&#8208;crystalline (LC) and luminescent properties of a series of N&#8208;annulated perylenes (1&#8211;4) in whose molecular structures amide and ester groups alternate. We found that the LC properties of these compounds not only depend on the number of hydrogen&#8208;bonding units, but also on the relative position of the amide linkers in the molecule. The absence of amide groups in compound 1 leads to no LC properties, whereas four amide groups induce the formation of a wide temperature range columnar hexagonal phase in compound 4. Remarkably, compound 3, with two amide groups in the inner part of the structure, stabilizes the columnar LC phases better than its structural isomer 2, with the amide groups in the outer part of the molecule. Similarly, we found that only compounds 1 and 2, which have no hydrogen bonding units in the inner part of the molecule, exhibit luminescence vapochromism upon exposure to organic solvent vapors.

         <title>Influence of N&#8208;Substituents on Photovoltaic Properties of Singly Bay&#8208;Linked Dimeric Perylene Diimides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By developing a general synthetic strategy, we synthesized a new series of bay&#8208;linked dimeric perylene diimides (diPDIs), some of which possess primary N&#8208;alkyl substituents or unsymmetric N&#8208;substitution pattern. The systematic investigation on their photovoltaic properties revealed that the primary alkyl substituents are advantageous for enhancing the device performance in terms of crystallinity improvement and film&#8208;forming controllability.







Abstract
The influence of N&#8208;substituents on the photovoltaic properties of singly bay&#8208;linked perylene diimides (diPDIs) was systematically investigated to understand the aromatic&#8208;aliphatic balance, which is beneficial for achieving high device performance in organic photovoltaic (OPV) systems. The synthesis of various N&#8208;substituted diPDIs was successfully achieved using a newly developed one&#8208;step procedure, resulting in sufficiently high yields. Detailed investigations of seven variants of diPDIs demonstrated that the primary alkyl substituents, particularly the 2&#8208;ethylhexyl group, induce the self&#8208;organized growth of thin films with high crystallinity. This is beneficial for enhancing the device performance of bulk heterojunction (BHJ) systems. The results presented herein reveal the important roles of alkyl side chains as hydrophobic solubilizing auxiliaries or primary determinants in the control of the active layer nanomorphology. This offers a valuable guideline that is essential for developing high&#8208;performance organic semiconductor materials for future practical applications.

     alt="Influence of N-Substituents on Photovoltaic Properties of Singly Bay-Linked Dimeric Perylene Diimides"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;By developing&lt;/b&gt; a general synthetic strategy, we synthesized a new series of bay-linked dimeric perylene diimides (diPDIs), some of which possess primary &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-alkyl substituents or unsymmetric &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-substitution pattern. The systematic investigation on their photovoltaic properties revealed that the primary alkyl substituents are advantageous for enhancing the device performance in terms of crystallinity improvement and film-forming controllability.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The influence of &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-substituents on the photovoltaic properties of singly bay-linked perylene diimides (diPDIs) was systematically investigated to understand the aromatic-aliphatic balance, which is beneficial for achieving high device performance in organic photovoltaic (OPV) systems. The synthesis of various &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-substituted diPDIs was successfully achieved using a newly developed one-step procedure, resulting in sufficiently high yields. Detailed investigations of seven variants of diPDIs demonstrated that the primary alkyl substituents, particularly the 2-ethylhexyl group, induce the self-organized growth of thin films with high crystallinity. This is beneficial for enhancing the device performance of bulk heterojunction (BHJ) systems. The results presented herein reveal the important roles of alkyl side chains as hydrophobic solubilizing auxiliaries or primary determinants in the control of the active layer nanomorphology. This offers a valuable guideline that is essential for developing high-performance organic semiconductor materials for future practical applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Galactose Grafted Two&#8208;Dimensional Nanosheets as a Scaffold for the In Situ Synthesis of Silver Nanoparticles: A Potential Catalyst for the Reduction of Nitroaromatics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Amphiphilicity&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly of galactose&#8208;hexaphenylbenzene based amphiphiles into galactose&#8208;decorated 2D nanosheet is reported. The extremely dense decoration of reducing sugar on the surface of the sheets is used for the in&#8197;situ synthesis and immobilization of ultrafine catalytically active AgNPs by using Tollens&#8217; reaction. The potential of the system as a recyclable catalyst for the reduction of various nitroaromatics is demonstrated. Enhanced catalytic activity is observed for the immobilized AgNPs when compared to the corresponding discrete AgNPs.







Abstract
Two major hurdles in NP&#8208;based catalysis are the aggregation of the NPs and their recycling. Immobilization of NPs onto a 2D support is the most promising strategy to overcome these difficulties. Herein, amphiphilicity&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly of galactose&#8208;hexaphenylbenzene&#8208;based amphiphiles into galactose&#8208;decorated 2D nanosheet is reported. The extremely dense decoration of reducing sugar on the surface of the sheets is used for the in&#8197;situ synthesis and immobilization of ultrafine catalytically active AgNPs by using Tollens&#8217; reaction. The potential of the system as a catalyst for the reduction of various nitroaromatics is demonstrated. Enhanced catalytic activity is observed for the immobilized AgNPs when compared to the corresponding discrete AgNPs. Recovery of the catalytic system from the reaction mixture by ultrafiltration and its subsequent recycling for several cycles without dropping its activity is shown. This is the first report demonstrating the in&#8197;situ synthesis and immobilization of ultrafine AgNPs onto a 2D nanosheet that exhibits excellent catalytic performance for the reduction of nitroaromatics.

         <title>Heterobimetallic Coinage Metal&#8208;Ruthenium Complexes Supported by Anionic N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Silver(I) and copper(I) arene complexes [(WCA&#8208;NHC)M(&#951;2&#8208;toluene)] (M=Ag, Cu) with a weakly coordinating anionic (WCA) borate moiety were prepared and their ability to serve as transmetalation reagents was investigated. However, the high stability of WCA&#8208;NHC&#8208;metal bonds provided access to heterobimetallic complexes such as [(WCA&#8208;NHC)M(&#956;&#8208;Cl)2Ru(PPh3)(&#951;6&#8208;p&#8208;cymene)], which resisted the elimination of AgCl or CuCl, respectively.







Abstract
The lithium complexes [(WCA&#8208;NHC)Li(toluene)] of anionic N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes with a weakly coordinating borate moiety (WCA&#8208;NHC, WCA=B(C6F5)3, NHC=IDipp=1,3&#8208;bis(2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl)imidazolin&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene) were used for the preparation of silver(I) or copper(I) WCA&#8208;NHC complexes. While the reactions in THF with AgCl or CuCl afforded anionic mono&#8208; and dicarbene complexes with solvated lithium counterions [Li(THF)n]+ (n=3, 4), the reactions in toluene proceeded with elimination of LiCl and formation of the neutral phosphine and arene complexes [(WCA&#8208;NHC)M(PPh3)] and [(WCA&#8208;NHC)M(&#951;2&#8208;toluene)] (M=Ag, Cu). The latter were used for the preparation of chlorido&#8208; and iodido&#8208;bridged heterobimetallic Ag/Ru and Cu/Ru complexes [(WCA&#8208;NHC)M(&#956;&#8208;X)2Ru(PPh3)(&#951;6&#8208;p&#8208;cymene)] (M=Ag, Cu, X=Cl; M=Ag, X=I). Surprisingly, these complexes resisted the elimination of CuCl, AgCl, or AgI, precluding WCA&#8208;NHC transmetalation.

         <title>SnS nanosheets for rapid and effective bacteria sterilization under near&#8208;infrared irradiation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Today, the threat of pathogenic bacterial infection worldwide that leads to the increase of mortality rate strongly demands the development of new antibacterial agents that can kill bacteria quickly and effectively. Although there are a lot of antibacterial agents that have been developed so far, few studies on the antibacterial ability of SnS have been investigated at 808 nm laser.   Here, we synthesized SnS nanosheets with strong near&#8208;infrared absorption performance and excellent antibacterial performance via a simple hydrothermal synthesis route.  The as&#8208;prepared SnS nanosheets showed excellent photothermal conversion efficiency (38.7%), photodynamic performance, and photostability, and at the same time 99.98% and 99.7% sterilization effect against Gram&#8208;negative  Escherichia coli  (  E. coli  ) and Gram&#8208;positive  Bacillus subtilis  (  B. subtilis  ) under near&#8208;infrared irradiation (808 nm, 1.5 W / cm  2  ). This study suggests that SnS nanosheets could be a promising candidate for antibacterial therapy owing to the synergetic effects of photothermal and photodynamic performance..</dc:description>

         <title>Liquid&#8208;Crystalline Polymer Particles Prepared by Classical Polymerization Techniques</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Getting things in order: Liquid crystal (LC) polymer particles have a unique anisotropic supramolecular order that distinguishes them from conventional polymer particles. This review focuses on the preparation of LC polymer particles by classical polymerization techniques, including suspension, mini&#8208;emulsion, dispersion and precipitation polymerization. The particle size, LC phases, alignment, properties and applications are also presented.







Abstract
Liquid&#8208;crystalline polymer particles prepared by classical polymerization techniques are receiving increased attention as promising candidates for use in a variety of applications including micro&#8208;actuators, structurally colored objects, and absorbents. These particles have anisotropic molecular order and liquid&#8208;crystalline phases that distinguish them from conventional polymer particles. In this minireview, the preparation of liquid&#8208;crystalline polymer particles from classical suspension, (mini&#8208;)emulsion, dispersion, and precipitation polymerization reactions are discussed. The particle sizes, molecular orientations, and liquid&#8208;crystalline phases produced by each technique are summarized and compared. We conclude with a discussion of the challenges and prospects of the preparation of liquid&#8208;crystalline polymer particles by classical polymerization techniques.

         <title>How Aromatic Fluorination Exchanges the Interaction Role of Pyridine with Carbonyl Compounds: The Formaldehyde Adduct</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The full ring fluorination of pyridine has a dramatic effect on its binding properties by creating a &#960;&#8208;hole. In the adduct pentafluoropyridine&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;formaldehyde the presence of fluorine atoms exchanges the electron donor&#8208;acceptor roles of both molecules when compared to those observed in the pyridine&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;formaldehyde adduct.







Abstract
The rotational spectrum of the weakly bound complex pentafluoropyridine&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;formaldehyde has been investigated using Fourier transform microwave spectroscopy. From the analysis of the rotational parameters of the parent species and of the 13C and 15N isotopologues, the structural arrangement of the adduct has been unambiguously established. The full ring fluorination of pyridine has a dramatic effect on its binding properties: It alters the electron density distribution at the &#960;&#8208;cloud of pyridine creating a &#960;&#8208;hole and changing its electron donor&#8208;acceptor capabilities. In the complex, formaldehyde lies above the aromatic ring with one of the oxygen lone pairs, as conventionally envisaged, pointing toward its centre. This lone pair&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960;&#8208;hole interaction, reinforced by a weak C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;N interaction, indicates an exchange of the electron&#8208;acceptor roles of both molecules when compared to the pyridine&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;formaldehyde adduct. Tunnelling doublets due to the internal rotation of formaldehyde have also been observed and analysed leading to a discussion on the competition between lone pair&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960;&#8208;hole and &#960;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; stacking interactions.

         <title>Charge&#8208;Transfer in Panchromatic Porphyrin&#8208;Tetracyanobuta&#8208;1,3&#8208;Diene&#8208;Donor Conjugates: Switching the Role of Porphyrin in the Charge Separation Process</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Charge Transfer and Separation. Occurrence of charge transfer and separation processes in newly synthesized porphyrin&#8208;TCBD&#8208;Donor multi&#8208;modular donor&#8208;acceptor systems is reported. The significance of the nature of porphyrins and second electron donor in governing the charge transfer events in these closely positioned conjugates is borne out from the present study.







Abstract
Using a combination of cycloaddition&#8208;retroelectrocyclization reaction, free&#8208;base and zinc porphyrins (H2P and ZnP) are decorated at their &#946;&#8208;pyrrole positions with strong charge transfer complexes, viz., tetracyanobuta&#8208;1,3&#8208;diene (TCBD)&#8208;phenothiazine (3 and 4) or TCBD&#8208;aniline (7 and 8), novel class of push&#8208;pull systems. The physico&#8208;chemical properties of these compounds (MP&#8208;Donor and MP&#8208;TCBD&#8208;Donor) have been investigated using a range of electrochemical, spectroelectrochemical, DFT as well as steady&#8208;state and time&#8208;resolved spectroscopic techniques. Ground&#8208;state charge transfer interactions between the porphyrin and the electron&#8208;withdrawing TCBD directly attached to the porphyrin &#960;&#8208;system extended the absorption features well into the near&#8208;infrared region. To visualize the photo&#8208;events, energy level diagrams with the help of free&#8208;energy calculations have been established. Switching the role of porphyrin from the initial electron acceptor to electron donor was possible to envision. Occurrence of photoinduced charge separation has been established by complementary transient absorption spectral studies followed by global and target data analyses. Better charge stabilization in H2P derived over ZnP derived conjugates, and in phenothiazine derived over aniline derived conjugates has been possible to establish. These findings highlight the importance of the nature of porphyrins and second electron donor in governing the ground and excited state charge transfer events in closely positioned donor&#8208;acceptor conjugates.

         <title>Reactivity and Passivation of Fe Nanoclusters on h&#8208;BN/Rh(111)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reactivity of iron nanoclusters (Fe&#8208;NCs) on h&#8208;BN/Rh(111) was investigated using in&#8197;situ high&#8208;resolution X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy and CO as a probe molecule. The hollow/edge sites were determined to be the most active sites of the clusters. Dissociation of CO was only observed on the as&#8208;prepared Fe&#8208;NCs, while no catalytic activity towards CO dissociation was found for the precovered clusters as a result of blocking of the most active sites by adatoms.







Abstract
The reactivity of iron nanocluster arrays on h&#8208;BN/Rh(111) was studied using in&#8197;situ high&#8208;resolution X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The morphology and reactivity of the iron nanoclusters (Fe&#8208;NCs) were investigated by CO adsorption. On&#8208;top and hollow/edge sites were determined to be the available adsorption sites on the as&#8208;prepared Fe&#8208;NCs and CO dissociation was observed at 300&#8197;K. C&#8208; and O&#8208;precovered Fe&#8208;NCs showed no catalytic activity towards CO dissociation because the hollow/edge sites were blocked by the C and O atoms. Therefore, these adsorption sites were identified to be the most active sites of the Fe&#8208;NCs.

     alt="Reactivity and Passivation of Fe Nanoclusters on h-BN/Rh(111)"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The reactivity of iron nanoclusters&lt;/b&gt; (Fe-NCs) on &lt;i&gt;h&lt;/i&gt;-BN/Rh(111) was investigated using in&#8197;situ high-resolution X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and CO as a probe molecule. The hollow/edge sites were determined to be the most active sites of the clusters. Dissociation of CO was only observed on the as-prepared Fe-NCs, while no catalytic activity towards CO dissociation was found for the precovered clusters as a result of blocking of the most active sites by adatoms.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reactivity of iron nanocluster arrays on &lt;i&gt;h-&lt;/i&gt;BN/Rh(111) was studied using in&#8197;situ high-resolution X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The morphology and reactivity of the iron nanoclusters (Fe-NCs) were investigated by CO adsorption. On-top and hollow/edge sites were determined to be the available adsorption sites on the as-prepared Fe-NCs and CO dissociation was observed at 300&#8197;K. C- and O-precovered Fe-NCs showed no catalytic activity towards CO dissociation because the hollow/edge sites were blocked by the C and O atoms. Therefore, these adsorption sites were identified to be the most active sites of the Fe-NCs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Rethinking Uncaging: A New Antiaromatic Photocage Driven by a Gain of Resonance Energy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The concept of excited state aromaticity was used to design a new class of photolabile protecting groups, based on cyclic, ground&#8208;state&#8208;antiaromatic systems. Supported by theoretical calculations, several thio&#8208; and nitrogen functionalized compounds were synthesized, characterized and further optimized, resulting in a well accessible, visible light absorbing, new photocage with a high uncaging cross section of 893&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 405&#8197;nm.







Abstract
Photoactivatable compounds for example photoswitches or photolabile protecting groups (PPGs, photocages) for spatiotemporal light control, play a crucial role in different areas of research. For each application, parameters such as the absorption spectrum, solubility in the respective media and/or photochemical quantum yields for several competing processes need to be optimized. The design of new photochemical tools therefore remains an important task. In this study, we exploited the concept of excited&#8208;state&#8208;aromaticity, first described by N. Colin Baird in 1971, to investigate a new class of photocages, based on cyclic, ground&#8208;state&#8208;antiaromatic systems. Several thio&#8208; and nitrogen&#8208;functionalized compounds were synthesized, photochemically characterized and further optimized, supported by quantum chemical calculations. After choosing the optimal scaffold, which shows an excellent uncaging quantum yield of 28&#8201;%, we achieved a bathochromic shift of over 100&#8197;nm, resulting in a robust, well accessible, visible light absorbing, compact new photocage with a clean photoreaction and a high quantum product (&#1013;&#8901;&#934;) of 893&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 405&#8197;nm.

         <title>Hydrogenation of Secondary Amides using Phosphane Oxide and Frustrated Lewis Pair Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The hydrogenation of secondary carboxylic acid amides by combined phosphane oxide and frustrated Lewis pair catalysis is described. The reaction proceeds under mild conditions and displays excellent functional group tolerance. Kinetic and quantum&#8208;chemical experiments support the autoinduced catalytic cycle with chloride as active Lewis base for the hydrogen activation.







Abstract
The metal&#8208;free catalytic hydrogenation of secondary carboxylic acid amides is developed. The reduction is realized by two new catalytic reactions. First, the amide is converted into the imidoyl chloride by triphosgene (CO(OCCl3)2) using novel phosphorus(V) catalysts. Second, the in&#8197;situ generated imidoyl chlorides are hydrogenated in high yields by an FLP&#8208;catalyst. Mechanistic and quantum mechanical calculations support an autoinduced catalytic cycle for the hydrogenation with chloride acting as unusual Lewis base for FLP&#8208;mediated H2&#8208;activation.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks&#8208;Derived Self&#8208;Supported Carbon&#8208;Based Composites for Electrocatalytic Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrocatalytic water splitting has been considered as a promising strategy for the sustainable evolution of hydrogen energy and storage of intermittent electric energy. Efficient catalysts for electrocatalytic water splitting are urgently demanded to decrease the overpotentials and promote the sluggish reaction kinetics. Carbon&#8208;based composites, including heteroatom&#8208;doped carbon materials, metals/alloys@carbon composites, metal compounds@carbon composites, and atomically dispersed metal sites@carbon composites have been widely used as the catalysts due to their fascinating properties. However, these electrocatalysts are almost powdery form, and should be cast on the current collector by using the polymeric binder, which would result in the unsatisfied electrocatalytic performance. In comparison, a self&#8208;supported electrode architecture is highly attractive. Recently, self&#8208;supported metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) constructed by coordination of metal centers and organic ligands have been considered as suitable templates/precursors to construct free&#8208;standing carbon&#8208;based composites grown on conductive substrate. MOFs&#8208;derived carbon&#8208;based composites have various merits, such as the well&#8208;aligned array architecture and evenly distributed active sites, and easy functionalization with other species, which make them suitable alternatives to non&#8208;noble metal&#8208;included electrocatalysts. In this review, we intend to show the research progresses by employment of MOFs as precursors to prepare self&#8208;supported carbon&#8208;based composites. Focusing on these MOFs&#8208;derived carbon&#8208;based nanomaterials, the latest advances in their controllable synthesis, composition regulation, electrocatalytic performances in hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and overall water splitting (OWS) are presented. Finally, the challenges and perspectives are showed for the further developments of MOFs&#8208;derived self&#8208;supported carbon&#8208;based nanomaterials in electrocatalytic reactions.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We herein report a circularly polarized luminescent (CPL) probe that can respond to chirality of nucleic acids. An achiral nanostructure was prepared by hybridization of symmetric serinol nucleic acid (SNA) containing pyrene&#8208;modified residues. When chiral oligomers were added that were complementary to the SNA, they induced helicity into the SNA nanowire. Efficient circular dichroism (CD) signal amplification was observed when pyrene was attached to uracil base through a rigid alkynyl linker.&#160; Both CPL signals and CD signals were observed that depended on the chirality of added acyclic threoninol nucleic acid (  a  TNA) oligomer. This system can be used to convert chirality of chiral biomolecules into chiroptical signals.</dc:description>

         <title>Electronic Structure and Superconductivity of Compressed Metal Tetrahydrides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Tetrahydrides crystallizing in the ThCr  2  Si  2  structure type have been predicted to become stable for a plethora of metals under pressure, and some have recently been synthesized. Through detailed first&#8208;principles investigations we show that the metal atoms within these  I  4  /mmm  symmetry MH  4  compounds may be divalent, trivalent or tetravalent. The valence of the metal atom and its radius govern the bonding and electronic structure of these phases, and their evolution under pressure. The factors important for enhancing superconductivity include a large number of hydrogenic states at the Fermi level, and the presence of quasi&#8208;molecular H units whose bonds have been stretched and weakened (but not broken) via electron transfer from the electropositive metal, and via a Kubas&#8208;like interaction with the metal. Analysis of the microscopic mechanism of superconductivity in MgH  4  , ScH  4  and ZrH  4  reveals that phonon modes involving a coupled libration and stretch of the H units leading to the formation of more complex hydrogenic motifs are important contributors towards the electron phonon coupling mechanism. In the divalent hydride MgH  4  , modes associated with motions of the hydridic hydrogen atoms were also key contributors, and softened substantially at lower pressures.</dc:description>

         <title>Direct Synthesis of Tri/Difluoromethyl Ketones from Carboxylic Acids via Cross&#8208;Coupling with Acyloxyphosphonium Ions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A simple and straightforward approach for the synthesis of trifluoromethyl&#8208; and difluoromethyl ketones from widely available carboxylic acids is disclosed. The transformation utilizes an acyloxyphosphonium ion as the active electrophile, conveniently generated in situ from the carboxylic acid substrate using commodity chemicals. The utility of the reaction system is exemplified by its chemoselectivity, with tolerance to a variety of important functional groups. The late&#8208;stage functionalization of carboxylic acid APIs and pharmaceutically relevant compounds is also discussed.</dc:description>

         <title>Recent Advances in the Syntheses and Catalytic Applications of Homonuclear Ru&#8208;, Rh&#8208;, and Ir&#8208;Complexes of CNHC^C Cyclometalated Ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In the past few decades, chemistry of cyclometalated species has gained momentum with increased applications in several areas of scientific developments. Cyclometalation reactions result in the formation of stable metalacycles through the generation of metal&#8208;carbon covalent bonds by activating the unreactive Csp2&#8208;H or Csp3&#8208;H bonds. The extra stability gained by the formation of metalacycles enhances their applicability scopes especially in the area of homogeneous catalysis. In the recent research development in this area, NHC ligands (strong  &#963;&#8208;donor and generally, weak  &#960;&#8208;acceptor) have been found to be one of the most suitable candidates for the intramolecular C&#8208;H activation process which leads to the cyclometalated species. The growth in the area of cyclometalation chemistry that started in the late 20th  century is still continuing and in the past few decades, various examples of NHC derived transition metal&#8208;based cyclometalated complexes came into the picture. As&#160;covering all the reported literatures in this area (includes mainly late transition metals) will exceed the limits of minireview, we restricted ourselves to the recent (2015 &#8208; May, 2021) examples of the most common Ru&#8208;, Rh&#8208;, and Ir&#8208;based CNHC^C cyclometalated complexes and their applications in various homogeneous catalytic conversions such as the transfer hydrogenation, amidation, oxidation of alcohols, annulations, etc.</dc:description>

         <title>One&#8208;Step Synthesis and Schlenk&#8208;Type Equilibrium of Cyclopentadienylmagnesium Bromides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In the in situ Grignard metalation method (iGMM), the addition of bromoethane to a suspension of magnesium turnings and cyclopentadienes [C  5  H  6  (HCp), C  5  H  5  &#8208;Si(  i  Pr)  3  (HCp  TIPS  )] in diethyl ether smoothly yields heteroleptic [(Et  2  O)Mg(Cp  R  )(&#181;&#8208;Br)]  2  (Cp  R  = Cp (  1  ), Cp  TIPS  (  2  )). The Schlenk equilibrium of  2  in toluene leads to ligand exchange and formation of homoleptic [Mg(Cp  R  )  2  ] (  3  ) and [(Et  2  O)MgBr(&#181;&#8208;Br)]  2  (  4  ). Interfering solvation and aggregation as well as ligand redistribution equilibria hamper a quantitative elucidation of thermodynamic data for the Schlenk equilibrium of  2  in toluene. In ethereal solvents, mononuclear species [(Et  2  O)  2  Mg(Cp  TIPS  )Br] (  2&#8217;  ), [(Et  2  O)  n  Mg(Cp  TIPS  )  2  ] (  3&#8217;  ), and [(Et  2  O)  2  MgBr  2  ] (  4&#8217;  ) coexist. Larger coordination numbers can be realized with cyclic ethers like tetrahydropyran allowing crystallization of [(thp)  4  MgBr  2  ] (  5  ). The interpretation of the temperature&#8208;dependency of the Schlenk equilibrium constant in diethyl ether gives a reaction enthalpy &#916;H and reaction entropy &#916;S of &#8208;11.5 kJ mol  &#8208;1  and 60 J mol  &#8208;1  , respectively.</dc:description>

         <title>Single amino&#8208;acid based self&#8208;assembled biomaterials with potent antimicrobial activity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The design and development of soft biomaterials based on amino acid and short&#8208;peptide have gained much attention due to their potent biomedical applications. A slight alteration in the side&#8208;chain of single amino acid in a peptide or protein sequence has a huge impact on the structure and function. Phenylalanine is one of the most studied amino acids, which contains an aromatic phenyl group connected through a flexible &#8211;CH  2  &#8208; unit. In this work, we have examined whether flexibility and aromatic functionality of phenylalanine (Phe) are important in gel formation of model gelator Fmoc&#8208;Phe&#8208;OH or not. To examine this hypothesis, we synthesized Fmoc&#8208;derivatives of three analogues unnatural amino acids including cyclohexylalanine, phenylglycine, and homophenylalanine; which are slightly varied from Phe. Interestingly, all these three new analogues formed hydrogels in phosphate buffer at pH 7.0 having different gelation efficacy and kinetics. This study suggests that the presence of aromatic side&#8208;chain and flexibility are not mandatory for the gelation of the model gelator. Newly synthesized unnatural amino acid derivatives have also exhibited promising antimicrobial activity towards gram&#8208;positive bacteria by inhibiting cellular oxygen consumption. We further determined the biocompatibility of these amino acid derivatives by using a hemolysis assay on human blood cells. Overall studies described the development of single amino acid&#8208;based new injectable biomaterials with improved antimicrobial activity by the slight alteration in the side&#8208;chain of amino acid.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Various triaminocyclopentadienyl ruthenium complexes have been synthesized from Ru3(CO)12. The new complexes were tested for their ability to catalyze cascade conversions of propargyl alcohols. Their associated catalytic activities complement the activities of known diaminocyclopentadienone ruthenium complexes. In particular, the substrate scope of catalytic cycloadditions with 3&#8208;ketolactones or phloroglucinol derivatives is extended to terpenoid&#8208;derived propargyl alcohols containing an internal alkyne moiety. A wide range of cyclic terpenoid and phloroglucinol adducts are obtained by complementary application of both types of catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Photophysics of azobenzene constrained in a UiO metal&#8208;organic framework: effects of pressure, solvation and dynamic disorder</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photophysical studies of chromophoric linkers in metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) are undertaken commonly in the context of sensing applications, in search of readily observable changes of optical properties in response to external stimuli. The advantages of the MOF construct as a platform for investigating fundamental photophysical behaviour have been somewhat overlooked. The linker framework offers a unique environment in which the chromophore is geometrically constrained and its structure can be determined crystallographically, but it exists in spatial isolation, unperturbed by inter&#8208;chromophore interactions. Furthermore, high&#8208;pressure studies enable the photophysical consequences of controlled, incremental changes in local environment or conformation to be observed and correlated with structural data. We demonstrate this approach in the present study of the  trans  &#8208;azobenzene chromophore, constrained in the form of the 4&#8217;4&#8208;azobenzenedicarboxylate (abdc) linker, in a UiO topology framework. We report previously unobserved effects of pressure&#8208;induced solvation and conformational distortion on the lowest energy, np* transition, and interpret these in the light of crystallographic data. We find that  trans  &#8208;azobenzene remains non&#8208;fluorescent (with a quantum yield less than 10  &#8208;4  ) despite the prevention of  trans&#8208;cis  isomerization by the constraining MOF structure. We propose that efficient non&#8208;radiative decay is mediated by the local, pedal&#8208;like twisting of the azo group that is evident as dynamic disorder in the crystal structure.</dc:description>

         <title>How to look for compounds: predictive screening and in situ studies in Na&#8208;Zn&#8208;Bi system</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Here we demonstrate the combination of theoretical computations followed by rapid experimental screening and in&#8208;situ diffraction studies as a powerful strategy for novel compounds discovery. When applied for the previously &#8220;empty&#8221; Na&#8208;Zn&#8208;Bi system, such an approach led to 4 novel phases. The compositional space of this system was rapidly screened via the hydride route method and the theoretically predicted NaZnBi (PbClF type, P4/nmm) and Na11Zn2Bi5 (Na11Cd2Sb5 type, P&#8208;1) phases were successfully synthesized, while other computationally generated compounds on the list were rejected. In addition, single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction studies of NaZnBi indicate minor deviations from the stoichiometric 1:1:1 molar ratio. As a result, two isostructural (PbClF type, P4/nmm) Zn&#8208;deficient phases with similar compositions, but distinctly different unit cell parameters were discovered. The vacancies on Zn sites and unit cell expansion were rationalized from bonding analysis using electronic structure calculations on stoichiometric &#8220;NaZnBi&#8221;. In&#8208;situ synchrotron powder X&#8208;ray diffraction studies shed light on complex equilibria in the Na&#8208;Zn&#8208;Bi system at elevated temperatures. In particular, the high&#8208;temperature polymorph HT&#8208;Na3Bi (BiF3 type, Fm&#8208;3m) was obtained as a product of Na11Zn2Bi5 decomposition above 611 K. HT&#8208;Na3Bi cannot be stabilized at room temperature by quenching, and this type of structure was earlier observed in the high&#8208;pressure polymorph HP&#8208;Na3Bi above 0.5 GPa. The aforementioned approach of predictive synthesis can be extended to other multinary systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Static Retention of Dynamic Chiral Arrangements for Achiral Shear Thinning Metal&#8211;Organic Colloids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Spin doctoring: Shear thinning is suggested to help colloidal particles adopt a chiral arrangement in a vortex, which results in strong CD properties. Furthermore, the introduction of a small molecule that both undergoes electrostatic interaction and possesses dual&#8208;site coordination bonding ability will greatly increase the storage modulus of colloids and make them maintain dynamic CD properties in the static state.







Abstract
Chiral compounds are known to be important not only because they are the fundamental components of living organisms, but also for their unique chiroptical properties. In recent years, scientists have fabricated several chiral organic supramolecular aggregates by using chiral physical fields, such as vortex flow. Herein, the relationship between dynamic chiroptical properties and rheological nature is discussed, suggesting the shear thinning properties of non&#8208;Newtonian fluids might help colloidal particles adopt a chiral arrangement in vortices. Furthermore, the storage modulus of colloids could be increased by adding a linking agent, which successfully kept the dynamic chiroptical properties in the static state. Moreover, the salt effect on the host&#8211;guest interaction involved in the colloids was studied, the results suggested a significant enhancement of the transferred dynamic circular dichroism for the achiral guest molecule.

         <title>Facile Synthesis of Platinum Right Bipyramids by Separating and Controlling the Nucleation Step in a Continuous Flow System</title>

Right Bipyramids. By separating nucleation from growth and controlling the nucleation step in a continuous flow system, Pt right bipyramids containing one single twin plane were obtained in high yield.







Abstract
Colloidal synthesis of metal nanocrystals with controlled shapes and internal structures calls for a tight control over both the nucleation and growth processes. Here we report a method for the facile synthesis of Pt right bipyramids (RBPs) by separating nucleation from growth and controlling the nucleation step in a continuous flow reactor. Specifically, homogeneous nucleation was thermally triggered by introducing the reaction solution into a tubular flow reactor held at an elevated temperature to generate singly&#8208;twinned seeds. At a lower temperature, the singly&#8208;twinned seeds were protected from oxidative etching to allow their slow growth and evolution into RBPs while additional nucleation of undesired seeds could be largely suppressed to ensure RBPs as the main product. Further investigation indicated that the internal structure and growth pattern of the seeds were determined by the temperatures used for the nucleation and growth steps, respectively. The Br&#8722; ions involved in the synthesis also played a critical role in the generation of RBPs by serving as a capping agent for the Pt{100} facets while regulating the reduction kinetics through coordination with the Pt(IV) ions.

         <dc:description>
Four selectively mono&#8208;, bis&#8208; and tris&#8208;trimethylammonium&#8208;substituted, bithiophene&#8208;bridged bis&#8208;triarylboranes were synthesized and their potential biological applications were investigated including live cell imaging and photo&#8208;induced cell death.

Abstract
The synthesis, photophysical, and electrochemical properties of selectively mono&#8208;, bis&#8208; and tris&#8208;dimethylamino&#8208; and trimethylammonium&#8208;substituted bis&#8208;triarylborane bithiophene chromophores are presented along with the water solubility and singlet oxygen sensitizing efficiency of the cationic compounds Cat1+, Cat2+, Cat(i)2+, and Cat3+. Comparison with the mono&#8208;triarylboranes reveals the large influence of the bridging unit on the properties of the bis&#8208;triarylboranes, especially those of the cationic compounds. Based on these preliminary investigations, the interactions of Cat1+, Cat2+, Cat(i)2+, and Cat3+ with DNA, RNA, and DNApore were investigated in buffered solutions. The same compounds were investigated for their ability to enter and localize within organelles of human lung carcinoma (A549) and normal lung (WI38) cells showing that not only the number of charges but also their distribution over the chromophore influences interactions and staining properties.

         <title>Aminotroponiminates: Impact of the NO2 Functional Group on Coordination, Isomerisation, and Backbone Substitution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unforeseen aspects of ATI chemistry: The impact of a nitro substituent in the backbone of the aminotroponiminate (ATI) ligand on the coordination chemistry and reactivity of alkali metal (Li&#8722;K) complexes has been investigated. This includes the first examples of i) an isolable free ATI anion, ii) E/Z imine isomerisations of ATI species and iii) N,N&#8208;coordinated silver ATIs.







Abstract
Aminotroponiminate (ATI) ligands are a versatile class of redox&#8208;active and potentially cooperative ligands with a rich coordination chemistry that have consequently found a wide range of applications in synthesis and catalysis. While backbone substitution of these ligands has been investigated in some detail, the impact of electron&#8208;withdrawing groups on the coordination chemistry and reactivity of ATIs has been little investigated. We report here Li, Na, and K salts of an ATI ligand with a nitro&#8208;substituent in the backbone. It is demonstrated that the NO2 group actively contributes to the coordination chemistry of these complexes, effectively competing with the N,N&#8208;binding pocket as a coordination site. This results in an unprecedented E/Z isomerisation of an ATI imino group and culminates in the isolation of the first &#8220;naked&#8221; (i.&#8201;e., without directional bonding to a metal atom) ATI anion. Reactions of sodium ATIs with silver(I) and tritylium salts gave the first N,N&#8208;coordinated silver ATI complexes and unprecedented backbone substitution reactions. Analytical techniques applied in this work include multinuclear (VT&#8208;)NMR spectroscopy, single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis, and DFT calculations.

         <title>High&#8208;Pressure Synthesis of Sc5P12N23O3 and Ti5P12N24O2 by Activation of the Binary Nitrides ScN and TiN with NH4F</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The oxonitridophosphates Sc5P12N23O3 and Ti5P12N24O2 have been prepared by high&#8208;pressure high&#8208;temperature reactions from the refractory nitrides ScN and TiN, respectively. These reactions were enabled by the addition of NH4F as a mineralizing agent. The crystal structures were elucidated by a combination of SCXRD, BVS calculations and magnetic measurements for Ti5P12N24O2 revealing two distinct crystallographic sites occupied by either Ti3+ or Ti4+, respectively.







Abstract
Multinary transition metal nitrides and oxonitrides are a versatile and intriguing class of compounds. However, they have been investigated far less than pure oxides. The compounds Sc5P12N23O3 and Ti5P12N24O2 have now been synthesized from the binary nitrides ScN and TiN, respectively, by following a high&#8208;pressure high&#8208;temperature approach at 8&#8197;GPa and 1400&#8201;&#176;C. NH4F acts as a mineralizing agent that supports product formation and crystallization. The starting materials ScN and TiN are seemingly an uncommon choice because of their chemical inertness but, nevertheless, react under these conditions. Sc5P12N23O3 and Ti5P12N24O2 crystallize isotypically with Ti5B12O26, consisting of solely vertex&#8208;sharing P(O/N)4 tetrahedra forming two independent interpenetrating diamond&#8208;like nets that host TM(O/N)6 (TM=Sc, Ti) octahedra. Ti5P12N24O2 is a mixed&#8208;valence compound and shows ordering of Ti3+ and Ti4+ ions.

         <title>Variations in Complementary Hydrogen Bonds Direct Assembly Patterns of Isosteric Polyheteroaromatics at Surfaces</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The 2D on&#8208;surface assembly of isosteric phenazine derivatives was investigated by utilizing scanning tunneling microscopy on single&#8208;crystal gold, silver and copper surfaces. The strength and directionality of hydrogen bonding donor&#8208;acceptor pairs and prototropic tautomerism were found to have a profound impact on the 2D assembly patterns, as evidenced by the variations in surface structure for the three derivative molecules used in this study.







Abstract
Intermolecular interactions guide self&#8208;assembly on the surface. Precise control over these interactions by rational design of the molecule should allow fine control over the self&#8208;assembly patterns. Functional groups installed for electronic modulation often induce significant changes in the molecular dimensions, thereby disrupting the original assembly pattern. To overcome this challenge, we have employed a family of isosteric phenazine derivatives, DHP, DAP, and DBQD, to investigate the impacts of hydrogen bonding on two&#8208;dimensional molecular self&#8208;assembly. While these molecules are similar in size and chemical composition, the strength and directionality of hydrogen bonding differ significantly depending on the chemical structure of donor&#8208;acceptor pairs and prototropic tautomerization from positional isomerism. Scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) characterization of the assembled structures on Ag(111), Au(111), and Cu(100) surfaces revealed that minimal changes in molecular structure have a profound impact on the self&#8208;assembly patterns. While DHP exhibits highly ordered and robust assemblies, DAP and DBQD show either spatially confined or ill&#8208;defined assemblies. In conjunction with hydrogen bonding, prototropic tautomerism is a potent strategy to modulate molecular 2D lattices on surfaces.

Heterofullerene tailoring: The inherently chiral trans&#8208;4&#8242; bisadduct of azafullerene has been synthesized. X&#8208;ray crystallography validated the trans&#8208;4&#8242; addition pattern, and 13C NMR spectroscopy showed C1 symmetry. The bisadduct was enantiomerically resolved, and the mirror&#8208;image relation of the enantiomers was probed by CD spectroscopy. The UV&#8208;Vis absorption and electrochemical data suggest that the addition pattern has a reflection in the light&#8208;harvesting and redox properties of the bisadduct as compared to the equatorialface bisadduct.







Abstract
The multiaddition chemistry of azafullerene C59N has been scarcely explored, and the isolation of pure bisadducts is in its infancy. Encouraged by the recent regioselective synthesis of the inherently chiral equatorialface bisadduct of C59N, we focused on the isolation of the first trans&#8208;4 bisadduct in a simple two&#8208;step approach. The first regioselective synthesis of the trans&#8208;4 bisadduct of C59N by using cyclo&#8208;[2]&#8208;dodecylmalonate as a tether is now reported. The newly synthesized bisadduct has C1 symmetry, as evidenced by 13C NMR, while X&#8208;ray crystallography validated the trans&#8208;4&#8242; addition pattern. Furthermore, the inherently chiral trans&#8208;4&#8242; C59N bisadduct was enantiomerically resolved, and the mirror&#8208;image relation of the two enantiomers was probed by circular dichroism spectroscopy. Finally, UV&#8208;Vis and redox assays suggested that the addition pattern has a reflection in the light&#8208;harvesting and redox properties of the bisadduct.

         <title>Diphenylalanine Motif Drives Self&#8208;Assembling in Hybrid PNA&#8208;Peptide Conjugates</title>

Forces triggering self&#8208;assembly. Conjugates of the PNA gc to the dipeptide FF assemble in water, producing fluorescent materials. Watson&#8208;Crick hydrogen bonds between complementary nucleobases and aromatic interactions between amino acids could stabilize the aggregate. The latter mainly drive the aggregation process.







Abstract
Peptides and nucleic acids can self&#8208;assemble to give supramolecular structures that find application in different fields, ranging from the delivery of drugs to the obtainment of materials endowed with optical properties. Forces that stabilize the &#8220;suprastructures&#8221; typically are hydrogen bonds or aromatic interactions; in case of nucleic acids, Watson&#8208;Crick pairing drives self&#8208;assembly while, in case of peptides, backbone hydrogen bonds and interactions between aromatic side chains trigger the formation of structures, such as nanotubes or ribbons. Molecules containing both aromatic peptides and nucleic acids could in principle exploit different forces to self&#8208;assemble. In this work we meant to investigate the self&#8208;assembly of mixed systems, with the aim to understand which forces play a major role and determine formation/structure of aggregates. We therefore synthesized conjugates of the peptide FF to the peptide nucleic acid dimer &#8220;gc&#8221; and characterized their aggregates by different spectroscopic techniques, including NMR, CD and fluorescence.

         <title>Study of the Lithium Storage Mechanism of N&#8208;Doped Carbon&#8208;Modified Cu2S Electrodes for Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ad LIB: In this study, thermal carbon reduction of CuS into Cu2S was monitored by high&#8208;temperature synchrotron radiation diffraction (SRD). As LIB electrode material, Li+ storage intermediate Cu1.8S is confirmed by operando methods. The result shows that some original Cu2S remains unreacted after the first cycle, and carbon modification can improve the cycling stability of Cu2S for LIBs in the long&#8208;term cycle.







Abstract
Owing to their high specific capacity and abundant reserve, CuxS compounds are promising electrode materials for lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs). Carbon compositing could stabilize the CuxS structure and repress capacity fading during the electrochemical cycling, but the corresponding Li+ storage mechanism and stabilization effect should be further clarified. In this study, nanoscale Cu2S was synthesized by CuS co&#8208;precipitation and thermal reduction with polyelectrolytes. High&#8208;temperature synchrotron radiation diffraction was used to monitor the thermal reduction process. During the first cycle, the conversion mechanism upon lithium storage in the Cu2S/carbon was elucidated by operando synchrotron radiation diffraction and in&#8197;situ X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy. The N&#8208;doped carbon&#8208;composited Cu2S (Cu2S/C) exhibits an initial discharge capacity of 425&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1, with a higher, long&#8208;term capacity of 523&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 200 cycles; in contrast, the bare CuS electrode exhibits 123&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 200 cycles. Multiple&#8208;scan cyclic voltammetry proves that extra Li+ storage can mainly be ascribed to the contribution of the capacitive storage.

         <title>Efficient Entropy&#8208;Driven Inhibition of Dipeptidyl Peptidase III by Hydroxyethylene Transition&#8208;State Peptidomimetics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A transition&#8208;state&#8208;based inhibitor has been developed which efficiently inhibits the metalloprotease dipeptidylpeptidase 3 (DPP3) by releasing structured water molecules from the binding cleft.







Abstract
Dipeptidyl peptidase III (DPP3) is a ubiquitously expressed Zn&#8208;dependent protease, which plays an important role in regulating endogenous peptide hormones, such as enkephalins or angiotensins. In previous biophysical studies, it could be shown that substrate binding is driven by a large entropic contribution due to the release of water molecules from the closing binding cleft. Here, the design, synthesis and biophysical characterization of peptidomimetic inhibitors is reported, using for the first time an hydroxyethylene transition&#8208;state mimetic for a metalloprotease. Efficient routes for the synthesis of both stereoisomers of the pseudopeptide core were developed, which allowed the synthesis of peptidomimetic inhibitors mimicking the VVYPW&#8208;motif of tynorphin. The best inhibitors inhibit DPP3 in the low &#956;M range. Biophysical characterization by means of ITC measurement and X&#8208;ray crystallography confirm the unusual entropy&#8208;driven mode of binding. Stability assays demonstrated the desired stability of these inhibitors, which efficiently inhibited DPP3 in mouse brain homogenate.

         <dc:description>A metal&#8208;free a&#8208;aminomethylation of heteroaryls promoted by eosin Y under green light irradiation is reported. A large variety of a&#8208;trimethylsilylamines as precursor of a&#8208;aminomethyl radical species were engaged to functionalize sulfonyl&#8208;heteroaryls following a Homolytic Aromatic Substitution (HAS) pathway. This method has provided a range of a&#8208;aminoheteroaryl compounds including a functionalized natural product. The mechanism of this late&#8208;stage functionalization of aryls was investigated and suggests the formation of a sulfonyl radical intermediate over a reductive quenching cycle.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Recently published syntheses, reactions and characterization of unusual unsaturated ring strained Group 4 metallocene metallacycles like metalla&#8208;cyclocumulenes, &#8208;cycloallenes and &#8208;cycloalkynes with different ring size are updated  for the last three years. There exist for some of these metallacycles, depending on the ring size, 7&#8208;, 5&#8208; and 4&#8208;membered compounds. The new results for these metallacycles are summarized here and considered in addition to the former published results. Additionally, several compounds of this type were now characterized by new reactions. For a better understanding of these compounds, some spectroscopical methods as well as theoretical calculations were published. Despite of these  all  &#8208;C&#8208;metallacycles, only in some cases the syntheses and reactions for the corresponding  hetero  &#8208;metallacycles were published too. Examples for these metallaheterocyclic compounds will not be considered in this article. All these unusual ring strained compounds have a great potential for a lot of interesting synthetic applications in the future. Additionally, are they very interesting from the theoretical point of view.</dc:description>

         <title>Perylene Bisimide&#8208;Cored Supramolecular Coordination Complexes: Interplay between Ensembles, Excited State Processes, and Aggregation Behaviors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Manipulating the optical properties of fluorescent species is challenging owing to complicated and tedious synthetic works. Herein, the photophysical properties of perylene bisimide (PBI) were effectively tuned by varying the geometrical arrangement of PBI moieties within supramolecular coordination complexes (SCCs), where a PBI&#8208;based dicycle (  2  ) and a trigonal prism (  3  ) were generated  via  using a typical 90&#176; Pt(II) reagent,  cis  &#8208;(PEt  3  )  2  Pt(OTf)  2  &#8208;based coordination&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly approach. The ligand, an  ortho  &#8208;tetrapyridiyl&#8208;PBI (  1  ), exhibits a moderate fluorescence quantum yield (~13%) and efficient inter&#8208;system crossing (ISC).  2  , however, is much more emissive with a fluorescence quantum yield of ~41%, and the relevant ISC process is significantly hindered. The fluorescence quantum yield of  3  is merely ~6% due to the observed symmetry&#8208;breaking charge separation (SB&#8208;CS), which turns to triplet state upon charge recombination. Interestingly,  3  could be fully transformed into  2  by simply adding a suitable amount of a 90&#176; Pt(II)&#8208;based neutral triangle. Moreover,  2  tends to form discrete dimers both in crystal and solution states, but  3  does not show the property. Therefore, controling geometrical arrangement of fluorophores through coordination&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly could be taken as another effective way to tune their excited state relaxation pathways and construct high&#8208;performance optical molecular materials, which generally have to be prepared  via  organic synthesis.</dc:description>

The fluorescence quantum yield of  3  is merely ~6% due to the observed symmetry-breaking charge separation (SB-CS), which turns to triplet state upon charge recombination.

         <title>Nanoparticles for Triple Drug Release for Combined Chemo&#8208; and Photodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A pH&#8208;responsive drug delivery system (DDS) based on mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs) has been prepared for the delivery of three anticancer drugs with different modes of action. The novelty of this system is its ability to combine a synergistic chemotherapy and photodynamic therapy. Herein, a photoactive conjugate of a phthalocyanine (Pc) and a topoisomerase I inhibitor (topo&#8208;I), namely camptothecin (CPT), linked by a polyethylene glycol (PEG) chain has been synthesized and then loaded into the mesopores of MSNs. Doxorubicin (DOX), which is a topoisomerase II inhibitor (topo&#8208;II), has also been covalently anchored to the outer surface of the MSNs through a dihydrazide polyethylene glycol linker. In the acidic environment of tumor cells, selective release of the three drugs takes place.  In vitro  studies have demonstrated the endocytosis of the system into HeLa and HepG2 cells and the subsequent release of the three drugs into the cytoplasm and nucleus. Furthermore, the cytotoxic effect of DOX, CPT and Pc has been assessed  in vitro  before and upon light irradiation.</dc:description>

         <title>Facile conversion of molecularly complex (hetero)aryl carboxylic acids into alkynes for accelerated SAR exploration</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>1,2,3&#8208;Triazoles are well&#8208;established bioisosteres for amides, often installed as a result of structure&#8208;activity&#8208;relationship (SAR) exploration. A straightforward approach to assess the effect of the replacement of an amide by a triazole would start from the carboxylic acid and the amine used for the formation of a given amide and convert them into the corresponding alkyne and azide for cyclization via copper&#8208;catalyzed alkyne&#8208;azide cycloaddition (CuAAC). Herein, we report a functional&#8208;group&#8208;tolerant and operationally simple decarbonylative alkynylation reaction allowing the conversion of complex (hetero)aryl carboxylic acids into alkynes. Furthermore, the utility of this method was demonstrated in the preparation of a triazolo analog of the commercial drug moclobemide. Lastly, mechanistic investigations using labelled carboxylic acid derivatives clearly show the decarbonylative nature of this transformation.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Polyoxometalates (POMs) can act as unique reservoirs for multiple electron transfers. As POMs display only weak absorption in the visible spectrum, they can be associated with chromophores such as porphyrins and porphyrin antennae.

         <title>Metathesis of P=C Bonds Catalyzed by N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Abstract:&#160; The catalytic metathesis of C=C bonds is a textbook reaction that has no parallel in the widely studied area of multiple bonds involving heavier p&#8208;block elements. We have discovered a high&#8208;yielding P=C bond metathesis of phosphaalkenes (ArP=CPh 2 , Ar = Mes,&#160; o &#8208;Tol, Ph) that is catalyzed by N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes (NHC = Me 2 IMe, Me 2 I i Pr). The products are cyclic oligomers formally derived from ArP=PAr [i.e.&#160; cyclo &#8208;(ArP) n ; n = 3, 4, 5, 6] and Ph 2 C=CPh 2 . Preliminary mechanistic studies of this remarkable transformation have established NHC=PAr (Ar = Mes,&#160; o &#8208;Tol, Ph) as key phosphinidene transfer agents. In addition, novel cyclic intermediates, such as,&#160; cyclo &#8208;(ArP) 2 CPh 2&#160; and&#160; cyclo &#8208;(ArP) 4 CPh 2&#160; have also been observed. This work represents a rare application of non&#8208;metal&#8208;based catalysts for transformations involving main&#8208;group elements.</dc:description>

         <title>Polycationic Redox&#8208;Active Cyclophanes with Integrated Electron&#8208;Rich Diboron Units</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cationic cyclophanes are widely used in a variety of applications in supramolecular chemistry and materials science. In this work we systematically study the integration of electron&#8208;rich diboron units with B  II  atoms into polycationic cyclophanes with viologen&#8208;like electron&#8208;acceptor units. We also report a first hexacationic cage&#8208;compound in which three diboron units connect two tris(4&#8208;pyridyl)triazine acceptor units. Moreover, di&#8208; and tetracationic open&#8208;structure compounds, in which one diboron unit connects two bispyridyl groups, were synthesized and the properties compared to those of the corresponding closed structures (cyclophanes). The combination of diboron electron&#8208;donor units and bi&#8208; or oligopyridyl electron&#8208;acceptor units leads to intriguing optical and redox properties.</dc:description>

         <title>Steering Scholl Oxidative Heterocoupling by Tuning Topology and Electronics for Building Thiananographenes and Their Functional N&#8208;/C&#8208;Congeners</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>While intramolecular Scholl oxidative coupling between two arenes is common, successful C&#8208;C heterocoupling between thiophene and arene is scarce. The latter is due to the notorious reactivity of thiophene towards polymerization under oxidative conditions. This report systematically demonstrates how topological variation of electronics and reactivity in thiophene substrates can lead to efficient oxidative heterocoupling. Bis(biaryl)thiophenes having reactive &#945;&#8208; and &#946;&#8208;positions open are the choice of substrates. The cyclizing arene partners are so electronically tuned for thiophene&#8217;s reactivity (at &#945;&#8208; and &#946;&#8208;) as to establish C&#8208;C bond oxidatively generating symmetrical as well as unsymmetrical diphenanthrothiophenes &#8211; basic thiananographenes. Depending on the cyclizing&#8208;couple&#8217;s electronics, either arene&#8208; or thiophene&#8208;centered oxidation initiates C&#8208;C heterocoupling. The potential utility of these simple thiananographenes is further unfurled by converting them to functional N&#8208;/C&#8208;graphene segments that are aza&#8208;corannulene precursor and tetrabenzospirobifluorene. Their bright emission and extended electrochemical stability are remarkable that may be potentially important and applicable.</dc:description>

         <title>C&#8722;C Cross&#8208;Couplings from a Cyclometalated Au(III) C
N Complex: Mechanistic Insights and Synthetic Developments</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The mechanism of C(sp2)&#8722;C(sp) coupling templated by the Au(III) cyclometalated complex [Au(CCH2N)Cl2] has been investigated. By tuning the reaction conditions and monitoring its progress by NMR, a number of intermediate species involved in the reductive elimination process could be isolated and characterised by different spectroscopic and analytical methods, including XRD, as well as by DFT studies.







Abstract
In recent years, the reactivity of gold complexes was shown to extend well beyond &#960;&#8208;activation and to hold promises to achieve selective cross&#8208;couplings in several C&#8722;C and C&#8722;E (E=heteroatom) bond forming reactions. Here, with the aim of exploiting new organometallic species for cross&#8208;coupling reactions, we report on the Au(III)&#8208;mediated C(sp2)&#8722;C(sp) occurring upon reaction of the cyclometalated complex [Au(CCH2N)Cl2] (1, CCH2N=2&#8208;benzylpyridine) with AgPhCC. The reaction progress has been monitored by NMR spectroscopy, demonstrating the involvement of a number of key intermediates, whose structures have been unambiguously ascertained through 1D and 2D NMR analyses (1H, 13C, 1H&#8208;1H COSY, 1H&#8208;13C HSQC and 1H&#8208;13C HMBC) as well as by HR&#8208;ESI&#8208;MS and X&#8208;ray diffraction studies. Furthermore, crystallographic studies have serendipitously resulted in the authentication of zwitterionic Au(I) complexes as side&#8208;products arising from cyclization of the coupling product in the coordination sphere of gold. The experimental work has been paralleled and complemented by DFT calculations of the reaction profiles, providing valuable insight into the structure and energetics of the key intermediates and transition states, as well as on the coordination sphere of gold along the whole process. Of note, the broader scope of the cross&#8208;coupling at the Au(III) CCH2N centre has also been demonstrated studying the reaction of 1 with C(sp2)&#8208;based nucleophiles, namely vinyl and heteroaryl tin and zinc reagents. These reactions stand as rare examples of C(sp2)&#8722;C(sp2) cross&#8208;couplings at Au(III).

         <title>Additive and Emergent Catalytic Properties of Dimeric Unnatural Amino Acid Derivatives: Aldol and Conjugate Additions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Different densely substituted L&#8208; and D&#8208;proline esters were prepared by asymmetric (3+2) cycloaddition reactions catalyzed by conveniently selected EhuPhos chiral ligands. The &#947;&#8208;nitro&#8208;2&#8208;alkoxycarbonyl pyrrolidines thus obtained in either their  endo  or  exo  forms were functionalized and coupled to yield the corresponding &#947;&#8208;dipeptides. The catalytic properties of these latter dimers were examined using aldol and conjugate additions as case studies. When aldol reactions were analyzed, an additive behavior in terms of stereocontrol was observed on going from the monomers to the dimers. In contrast, in the case of the conjugate additions between ketones and nitroalkenes, the monomers did not catalyze this reaction, whereas the different &#947;&#8208;dipeptides promoted the formation of the corresponding Michael adducts. Therefore, in this latter case emergent catalytic properties were observed for these novel &#947;&#8208;dipeptides based on unnatural proline derivatives. Under certain conditions (stoichiometric amounts of ketone, acid and nitroalkene), formation of  N&#8208;  acyloxy&#8208;2&#8208;oxooctahydro&#8208;1  H  &#8208;indoles was observed.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>In the field of photocatalysis, building a heterojunction is an effective way to promote electron transfer and enhance the reducibility of electrons. Herein, the S&#8208;scheme&#160;heterojunction photocatalyst&#160;(CoS  2  /Zn  0.5  Cd  0.5  S) of CoS  2  &#160;nanospheres&#160;modified Zn  0.5  Cd  0.5  S solid solution&#160;was synthesized and studied. The H  2  &#160;evolution&#160;rate of composite catalyst reached 25.15 mmol&#183;g  &#8208;1  &#183;h  &#8208;1  , which was 3.26 times that of single&#160;Zn  0.5  Cd  0.5  S, while pure CoS  2  &#160;showed almost no hydrogen production activity.&#160;Moreover,&#160;CoS  2  /Zn  0.5  Cd  0.5  S&#160;had excellent stability, and the hydrogen production&#160;rate after six&#160;cycles of experiments only dropped by 6.19%.&#160;In addition, photoluminescence spectroscopy and photoelectrochemical experiments&#160;had effectively proved that the photogenerated carrier transfer rate of CoS  2  /Zn  0.5  Cd  0.5  S&#160;was&#160;better than CoS  2  &#160;or&#160;Zn  0.5  Cd  0.5  S&#160;single catalyst.&#160;In this study, the synthesized CoS  2  &#160;and Zn  0.5  Cd  0.5  S were&#160;both n&#8208;type semiconductors. After close contact, they followed an S&#8208;scheme heterojunction electron transfer mechanism, which not only promoted the separation of their respective holes and electrons, but also retained a stronger reduction potential, thus promoting the reduction of H  +  &#160;protons in photocatalytic experiments. In short, this work provided&#160;a new basis for the construction of S&#8208;scheme&#160;heterojunction&#160;in addition to being used for photocatalytic hydrogen production.</dc:description>

         <title>Salicylideneaniline is a Photoswitchable Ferroelectric Crystal</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Since the discovery of the first ferroelectric Rochelle salt, most ferroelectrics have been investigated showing thermally triggered symmetry&#8208;breaking phase transition. Although photochromism arising from geometrical isomerization has been reported earlier in 1867, such photoswitchable ferroelectric crystals have scarcely been developed to date. Herein, we report that salicylideneaniline is a photochromic ferroelectric crystal. Upon photoirradiation, the dielectric constant shows obvious switching between high and low dielectric states, and more importantly, the ferroelectric polarization demonstrates quickly and reversibly switching. This work opens the gate of developing photoswitchable ferroelectrics, which holds great potential for applications in optically controlled smart devices.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>An electrochemical three component cascade phosphorylation of various heteroatoms&#8208;containing nucleophiles including carbazoles, phenols, alcohols, and thiols with Ph  2  PH has been established. Electricity is used as the &#8220;traceless&#8221; oxidant and water and air are utilized as the &#8220;green&#8221; oxygen source. All kinds of structurally diverse organophosphorus compounds with P(O)&#8208;N/P(O)&#8208;O/P(O)&#8208;S bonds are assembled in moderate to excellent yields (three categories of phosphorylation products, 48 examples, up to 97% yield). A tentative free radical course is put forward to rationalize the reaction procedure.</dc:description>

         <title>Structure&#8208;based design, synthesis, and biological evaluation of Hsp90&#946;&#8208;selective inhibitors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The 90 kDa heat shock proteins (Hsp90) are molecular chaperones that are responsible for the folding and/or trafficking of ~400 client proteins, many of which are directly associated with cancer progression. Consequently, inhibition of Hsp90 can exhibit similar activity as combination therapy as multiple signaling nodes can be targeted simultaneously. In fact, seventeen small&#8208;molecule inhibitors that bind the Hsp90 N&#8208;terminus entered clinical trials for the treatment of cancer, all of which exhibited pan&#8208;inhibitory activity against all four Hsp90 isoforms. Unfortunately, most demonstrated undesired effects alongside induction of the pro&#8208;survival heat shock response. As a result, isoform&#8208;selective inhibitors have been sought to overcome these detriments. Described herein is a structure&#8208;based approach to design Hsp90&#946;&#8208;selective inhibitors along with preliminary SAR. In the end, compound  5  was shown to manifest ~370&#8208;fold selectivity for Hsp90&#946; versus Hsp90&#945;, and induced the degradation of select Hsp90&#946;&#8208;dependent clients. These data support the development of Hsp90&#946;&#8208;selective inhibitors as a new paradigm to overcome the detriments associated with pan&#8208;inhibition of Hsp90.</dc:description>

         <title>Facile Synthesis of Azahelicenes and Diaza[8]circulenes through the Intramolecular Scholl Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Carbazole&#8208;based aza[7]helicenes and hetero[9]helicenes were successfully obtained via the intramolecular Scholl reaction of 3,6&#8208;bis(biphenyl&#8208;2&#8208;yl)carbazole congeners, while the reaction of 3,6&#8208;bis(naphthylphenyl)&#8208;appended carbazole gave a triple helicene via an unexpected simultaneous double aryl rearrangement. DFT calculations suggested that the rearrangement proceeded via an arenium cation intermediate. In addition, the reaction of methoxy&#8208;appended substrate gave an azahepta[8]circulene via the concurrent C&#8211;C bond formation. These helical dyes showed circularly polarized luminescence. The azahepta[8]circulene was further transformed into deeply saddle&#8208;distorted dibenzodiaza[8]circulenes as the first example of its solution&#8208;based synthesis and unambiguous structural determination .</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Multinuclear metal complexes have seen tremendous progress in synthetic advances, their versatile structural features, and emerging applications. Here, we conceptualize metal&#8208;to&#8208;metal distance modulation in co&#8208;facially stacked cyclophanyl metal complexes by ligand design employing cyclophanyl&#8208;derived pseudo&#8208;  geminal  , &#8208;  ortho  , &#8208;  meta  , and &#8208;  para  constitutional isomers grafted with N&#8208;, O&#8208;, and P&#8208; containing chelates that allow the installation of diverse (hetero)metallic moieties in a distance&#8208;defined and spatially&#8208;oriented relation to one another. Metal&#8211;to&#8211;metal distance modulation and innate transannular "through&#8208;space" &#960;&#8211;&#960; electronic interactions  via  the co&#8208;facially stacked benzene rings in cyclophanyl&#8208;derived complexes, as well as their specific stereochemical structural features (element of planar chirality), are crucial factors that contribute to the tuning of structure&#8208;property relationships, which stand at the very center from the perspective of cooperative effects in catalysis as well as material applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Stereospecific on&#8208;Surface Cyclodehydrogenation of Bishelicenes: Preservation of Handedness from Helical to Planar Chirality</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Flattening helices while keeping the handedness: On&#8208;surface cyclodehydrogenation of bishelicene enantiomers leads stereospecifically to (M,M) and (P,P) chiral planar polyaromatic hydrocarbons. This is followed by their homochiral aggregation into a 2D conglomerate. Thermally induced cyclodehydrogenation proceeds stereospecifically to chiral, planar coronocoronene. Such a reaction is a special example of topochemistry in which enantiospecific conversion is supported by the alignment of the reactant by the surface.

         <title>Canopy Catalysts for Alkyne Metathesis: Investigations into a Bimolecular Decomposition Pathway and the Stability of the Podand Cap</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Vulnerable? The activity and functional group tolerance of metal alkylidyne canopy catalysts for alkyne metathesis is excellent, but their stability leaves room for optimization. The search for the Achilles&#8242; heels unveiled a new decomposition pathway through bimolecular coupling and led to the discovery of a facile cyclo&#8208;tetramerization reaction by (reversible) opening of the tripodal ligand cage.







Abstract
Molybdenum alkylidyne complexes with a trisilanolate podand ligand framework (&#8220;canopy catalysts&#8221;) are the arguably most selective catalysts for alkyne metathesis known to date. Among them, complex 1&#8201;a endowed with a fence of lateral methyl substituents on the silicon linkers is the most reactive, although fairly high loadings are required in certain applications. It is now shown that this catalyst decomposes readily via a bimolecular pathway that engages the Mo&#8801;CR entities in a stoichiometric triple&#8208;bond metathesis event to furnish RC&#8801;CR and the corresponding dinuclear complex, 8, with a Mo&#8801;Mo core. In addition to the regular analytical techniques, 95Mo NMR was used to confirm this unusual outcome. This rapid degradation mechanism is largely avoided by increasing the size of the peripheral substituents on silicon, without unduly compromising the activity of the resulting complexes. When chemically challenged, however, canopy catalysts can open the apparently somewhat strained tripodal ligand cages; this reorganization leads to the formation of cyclo&#8208;tetrameric arrays composed of four metal alkylidyne units linked together via one silanol arm of the ligand backbone. The analogous tungsten alkylidyne complex 6, endowed with a tripodal tris&#8208;alkoxide (rather than siloxide) ligand framework, is even more susceptible to such a controlled and reversible cyclo&#8208;oligomerization. The structures of the resulting giant macrocyclic ensembles were established by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction.

         <title>Photoelectrochemical Reduction of Carbon Dioxide with a Copper Graphitic Carbon Nitride Photocathode</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Shining visible light and passing DC current through a carbon nitride material doped with copper atoms catalyzes the selective reduction of the greenhouse gas, carbon dioxide, to an important chemical intermediate, carbon monoxide. X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy was used to show how visible light increases the current and activity of the material. More information can be found in the Communication by R. Neumann et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202101820).

         <title>Determining the Diastereoselectivity of the Formation of Dipeptidonucleotides by NMR Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The origin of homochirality is one of the unresolved issues of prebiotic chemistry. Why are the amino acids found in proteins of the l configuration? Perhaps peptido nucleotides could have played a role as transitional species, as suggested visually by the Archaeopteryx in the image. It was recently shown that these phosphoramidate&#8208;linked species form spontaneously from simple precursors. Now, the diastereoselectivity of the the dipeptide&#8208;forming step has been determined by in&#8208;situ NMR spectroscopy, revealing that homochiral products are preferred. This is reported in the Full Paper by C. Richert et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202101630).

A transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free method using tert&#8208;butyl hypoiodite (t&#8208;BuOI) or N&#8208;iodosuccinimide (NIS) for the intramolecular C&#8722;H amination of N&#8208;alkylsulfamides is reported. The six&#8208;membered cyclic sulfamide products can be easily converted into a variety of useful 1,3&#8208;diamines. The present amination that effectively proceeds under ambient conditions, features operationally simple, practical, and scalable methodology.







Abstract
1,3&#8208;Diamines are an important class of compounds that are broadly found in natural products and are also widely used as building blocks in organic synthesis. Although the intramolecular C&#8722;H amination of N&#8208;alkylsulfamide derivatives is a reliable method for the construction of 1,3&#8208;diamine structures, the majority of these methods involve the use of a transition&#8208;metal catalyst. We herein report on a new transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free method using tert&#8208;butyl hypoiodite (t&#8208;BuOI) or N&#8208;iodosuccinimide (NIS), enabling secondary non&#8208;benzylic and tertiary C&#8722;H amination reactions to proceed. The cyclic sulfamide products can be easily transformed into 1,3&#8208;diamines. Mechanistic investigations revealed that amination reactions using t&#8208;BuOI or NIS each proceed via different pathways.
