         <title>A Benzodiphosphaborolediide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The first example of a diphosphaborolediide, the benzo&#8208;fused [C 6 H 4 P 2 BPh] 2&#8211; ( 1 2&#8208; ), is prepared from ortho&#8208;bis(phosphino)benzene (C 6 H 4 {PH 2 }) and dichlorophenylborane, via a sequential lithiation approach. The dilithio&#8208;salt can be obtained as an oligomeric THF solvate or discrete TMEDA adduct, both of which are fully characterized, including by X&#8208;ray diffraction. Alongside NICS calculations, data strongly suggest some aromaticity within 1 2&#8208; , which is further supported by preliminary coordination studies that demonstrate &#951; 5 &#8208;coordination to a zerovalent molybdenum center, as observed crystallographically for the oligomeric [{Mo(CO) 3 (&#951; 5 &#8208; 1 )}{&#956;&#8208;&#951; 1 &#8208;Mo(CO) 3 (TMEDA)} 2 ].[Li(THF)][Li(TMEDA)].</dc:description>

         <title>GPhos Ligand Enables Production of Chiral&#160;N&#8208;Arylamines in a Telescoped Transaminase&#8211;Buchwald&#8208;Hartwig&#160;Amination Cascade in the Presence of Excess Amine Donor</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The combination of biocatalysis and chemocatalysis can be more powerful than either technique alone. However, combining the two is challenging due to typically very different reaction conditions. Herein, chiral N &#8208;aryl amines, key features of many active pharmaceutical ingredients, are accessed in excellent enantioselectivity (typically &gt;99.5% ee ) by combining transaminases with the Buchwald Hartwig amination. By employing a bi&#8208;phasic buffer&#8208;toluene system as well as the ligand GPhos, the telescoped cascade proceeded with up to 89% overall conversion in the presence of excess alanine. No coupling to alanine was observed.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly Efficient Simulated Solar Light&#8208;Driven Photocatalytic Degradation of 4&#8208;Nitrophenol over CdS/Carbon/MoSx Hybrids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Among the various organic pollutants and industrial chemicals, 4&#8208;nitrophenol has been one of the most monitored substances in aqueous environments, due to its enhanced solubility in such systems. This research reports for the first time the microwave&#8208;assisted synthesis of CdS/carbon/MoS  x  hybrids and the subsequent utilization of such systems as photocatalysts for 4&#8208;nitrophenol degradation. The hybrids demonstrated a variable photocatalytic activity, by using a variety of organic substances as precursors for the solvothermal carbonization step. By using ascorbic acid as precursor, the corresponding ternary composite exhibited excellent photocatalytic activity, with the 4&#8208;nitrophenol concentration been almost quantitatively decayed within 45 min of irradiation. This could be ascribed due to the generation of a high population of heterojunctions as well as the chemical speciation of Mo&#8208;based nanostructures. Such ternary hybrids may be utilized as potential photocatalytic systems in processes, where removal of toxic water&#8208;soluble substances is the key issue.</dc:description>

         <title>Asymmetric Synthesis of Indoline from Achiral Phthalimide Involving Crystallization&#8208;Induced Deracemization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Asymmetric synthesis was performed by combining the photochemical reaction of an achiral substrate followed by crystallization&#8208;induced deracemization. The results indicated that a fused indoline produced by photochemical intramolecular d&#8208;hydrogen abstraction and cyclization of N&#8208;(5&#8208;chloro&#8208;2&#8208;methylphenyl)phthalimide crystallized as a racemic conglomerate. Since this substrate has an aminal skeleton, racemization involving a ring&#8208;opening and ring&#8208;closing equilibrium process occurred under suitable conditions. Efficient racemization was observed in acetone containing a catalytic base, 1,8&#8208;diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec&#8208;7&#8208;ene (DBU). Crystallization&#8208;induced dynamic deracemization by Viedma ripening from racemic indoline was performed with an excellent enantioselectivity of 99% ee. Furthermore, one&#8208;pot asymmetric synthesis of the indoline was achieved by the photochemical reaction of achiral phthalimide followed by continuous attrition&#8208;enhanced deracemization converging to 99% ee of enantiomeric crystals. This is the first example of asymmetric expression and amplification by photochemical hydrogen abstraction and crystallization&#8208;induced dynamic deracemization.</dc:description>

         <title>Structure&#8208;Based Design, Synthesis, and Biological Evaluation of Hsp90&#946;&#8208;Selective Inhibitors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The high identity shared among the various Hsp90 isoforms (&gt;85&#8201;%) within the N&#8208;terminal ATP&#8208;binding pocket has made the development of isoform selective inhibitors very challenging. Recently, we reported the first Hsp90&#946;&#8208;selective inhibitor, which induced the degradation of Hsp90&#946;&#8208;dependent clients without induction of Hsp90 levels. Structure&#8208;activity relationships for the first Hsp90&#946;&#8208;selective inhibitor are disclosed herein and led to the identification of compound 5, which exhibited &#8764;370&#8208;fold selectivity for Hsp90&#946; over Hsp90&#945;.







Abstract
The 90&#8197;kDa heat shock proteins (Hsp90) are molecular chaperones that are responsible for the folding and/or trafficking of &#8764;400 client proteins, many of which are directly associated with cancer progression. Consequently, inhibition of Hsp90 can exhibit similar activity as combination therapy as multiple signaling nodes can be targeted simultaneously. In fact, seventeen small&#8208;molecule inhibitors that bind the Hsp90&#8197;N&#8208;terminus entered clinical trials for the treatment of cancer, all of which exhibited pan&#8208;inhibitory activity against all four Hsp90 isoforms. Unfortunately, most demonstrated undesired effects alongside induction of the pro&#8208;survival heat shock response. As a result, isoform&#8208;selective inhibitors have been sought to overcome these detriments. Described herein is a structure&#8208;based approach to design Hsp90&#946;&#8208;selective inhibitors along with preliminary SAR. In the end, compound 5 was shown to manifest &#8764;370&#8208;fold selectivity for Hsp90&#946; versus Hsp90&#945;, and induced the degradation of select Hsp90&#946;&#8208;dependent clients. These data support the development of Hsp90&#946;&#8208;selective inhibitors as a new paradigm to overcome the detriments associated with pan&#8208;inhibition of Hsp90.

         <title>Covalent Linkage of BODIPY&#8208;Photosensitizers to Anderson&#8208;Type Polyoxometalates Using CLICK Chemistry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Covalent functionalization of Anderson&#8208;polyoxometalates with BODIPY light&#8208;absorbers using CLICK chemistry is reported. The resulting photosensitizer&#8208;polyoxometalate dyads are characterized by photophysical and theoretical methods, highlighting the electronic interactions between the sub&#8208;components, and their possible application in visible light&#8208;driven chemistry.







Abstract
The covalent attachment of molecular photosensitizers (PS) to polyoxometalates (POMs) opens new pathways to PS&#8208;POM dyads for light&#8208;driven charge&#8208;transfer and charge&#8208;storage. Here, we report a synthetic route for the covalent linkage of BODIPY&#8208;dyes to Anderson&#8208;type polyoxomolybdates by using CLICK chemistry (i.&#8201;e. copper&#8208;catalyzed azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition, CuAAC). Photophysical properties of the dyad were investigated by combined experimental and theoretical methods and highlight the role of both sub&#8208;components for the charge&#8208;separation properties. The study demonstrates how CLICK chemistry can be used for the versatile linkage of organic functional units to molecular metal oxide clusters.

         <title>Prolonging the Triplet State Lifetimes of Rhenium Complexes with Imidazole&#8208;Pyridine Framework for Efficient CO2 Photoreduction</title>

CO2 photoreduction: A series of new mononuclear rhenium(I) complexes with imidazole&#8208;pyridine framework based on the long&#8208;lived excited triplet state exhibit satisfactory stability and catalytic efficiency in photoreduction of CO2 to CO. This work emphasizes the practice and importance of tailored photocatalyst design on molecular level, representing appealing and potentially applications for phosphorescent catalysts in CO2 reduction to solar fuels.







Abstract
The photocatalytic reduction of CO2 into fuels offers the prospect for creating a new CO2 economy. Harnessing visible light&#8208;driven CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO reduction mediated by the long&#8208;lived triplet excited state of rhenium(I) tricarbonyl complexes is a challenging approach. We here develop a series of new mononuclear rhenium(I) tricarbonyl complexes (Re&#8208;1&#8722;Re&#8208;4) based on the imidazole&#8208;pyridine skeleton for photo&#8208;driven CO2 reduction. These catalysts are featured by combining pyridyl&#8208;imidazole with the aromatic ring and different pendant organic groups onto the N1 position of 1,3&#8208;imidazole unit, which display phosphorescence under Ar&#8208;saturated solution even at ambient conditions. By contrast, {Re[9&#8208;(pyren&#8208;1&#8208;yl)&#8208;10&#8208;(pyridin&#8208;2&#8208;yl)&#8208;9H&#8208;pyreno[4,5&#8208;d]imidazole)](CO)3Cl} (Re&#8208;4) by introducing pyrene ring at the N1 position of pyrene&#8208;fused imidazole unit exhibits superior catalytic performance with a higher turnover number for CO (TONCO=124) and &gt;99.9&#8201;% selectivity, primarily ascribed to the strong visible light&#8208;harvesting ability, long&#8208;lived triplet lifetimes (164.2&#8197;&#956;s) and large reductive quenching constant. Moreover, the rhenium(I) tricarbonyl complexes derived from &#960;&#8208;extended pyrene chromophore exhibit a long lifetime corresponding to its ligand&#8208;localized triplet state (3IL) evidenced from spectroscopic investigations and DFT calculations.

         <title>n&#8208;Butane, iso&#8208;Butane and 1&#8208;Butene Adsorption on Imidazolium&#8208;Based Ionic Liquids Studied with Molecular Beam Techniques</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The dynamical interaction of n&#8208;butane, iso&#8208;butane and 1&#8208;butene with 1&#8208;alkyl&#8208;3&#8208;methyl&#8208;imidazolium&#8208;based ionic liquids is investigated by determining the temperature&#8208;dependent initial trapping probabilities by using molecular beam techniques. The adsorption and desorption energy increases with increasing length of the alkyl substituent of the cation, decreasing size of the anion and in the order iso&#8208;butane&lt;1&#8208;butene&lt;n&#8208;butane when changing the adsorbing molecule.







Abstract
The interaction of molecules, especially hydrocarbons, at the gas/ionic liquid (IL) surface plays a crucial role in supported IL catalysis. The dynamics of this process is investigated by measuring the trapping probabilities of n&#8208;butane, iso&#8208;butane and 1&#8208;butene on a set of frozen 1&#8208;alkyl&#8208;3&#8208;methylimidazolium&#8208;based ILs [CnC1Im]X, where n=4, 8 and X&#8722;=Cl&#8722;, Br&#8722;, [PF6]&#8722; and [Tf2N]&#8722;. The decrease of the initial trapping probability with increasing surface temperature is used to determine the desorption energy of the hydrocarbons at the IL surfaces. It increases with increasing alkyl chain length n and decreasing anion size for the ILs studied. We attribute these effects to different degrees of alkyl chain surface enrichment, while interactions between the adsorbate and the anion do not play a significant role. The adsorption energy also depends on the adsorbing molecule: It decreases in the order n&#8208;butane&gt;1&#8208;butene&gt;iso&#8208;butane, which can be explained by different dispersion interactions.

         <dc:description>
A photocatalytic aminomethylation of heterocycles with organic dye is reported. The C&#8722;C bond formation through a aminomethyl radical formation enables access to a series of functionalized heterocycles in one step with no need of transition metals.







Abstract
A metal&#8208;free &#945;&#8208;aminomethylation of heteroaryls promoted by eosin Y under green light irradiation is reported. A large variety of &#945;&#8208;trimethylsilylamines as precursor of &#945;&#8208;aminomethyl radical species were engaged to functionalize sulfonyl&#8208;heteroaryls following a Homolytic Aromatic Substitution (HAS) pathway. This method has provided a range of &#945;&#8208;aminoheteroaryl compounds including a functionalized natural product. The mechanism of this late&#8208;stage functionalization of aryls was investigated and suggests the formation of a sulfonyl radical intermediate over a reductive quenching cycle.

         <title>Alkali Metal Complexes of a Bis(diphenylphosphino)methane Functionalized Amidinate Ligand: Synthesis and Luminescence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Combined functionalities: A bis(diphenylphosphino)methane functionalized amidine was synthesized and employed as a ligand for the whole alkali metal series. The resulting complexes show interesting photophysical properties, revealing differences in emission with regards to the respective alkali metal. In addition, a caesium derivative was obtained by cleavage of a diphenylphosphino moiety, forming an unusual six&#8208;membered ring structure in the solid state.







Abstract
A novel bis(diphenylphosphino)methane (DPPM) functionalized amidine ligand (DPPM&#8722;C(N&#8208;Dipp)2H) (Dipp=2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl) was synthesized. Subsequent deprotonation with suitable alkali metal bases resulted in the corresponding complexes [M{DPPM&#8722;C(N&#8208;Dipp)2}(Ln)] (M=Li, Na, K, Rb, Cs; L=thf, Et2O). The alkali metal complexes form monomeric species in the solid state, exhibiting intramolecular metal&#8208;&#960;&#8208;interactions. In addition, a caesium derivative [Cs{PPh2CH2&#8208;C(N&#8208;Dipp)2}]6 was obtained by cleavage of a diphenylphosphino moiety, forming an unusual six&#8208;membered ring structure in the solid state. All complexes were fully characterized by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, NMR spectroscopy, IR spectroscopy as well as elemental analysis. Furthermore, the photoluminescent properties of the complexes were thoroughly investigated, revealing differences in emission with regards to the respective alkali metal. Interestingly, the hexanuclear [Cs{PPh2CH2&#8208;C(N&#8208;Dipp)2}]6 metallocycle exhibits a blue emission in the solid state, which is significantly red&#8208;shifted at low temperatures. The bifunctional design of the ligand, featuring orthogonal donor atoms (N vs. P) and a high steric demand, is highly promising for the construction of advanced metal and main group complexes.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A novel bis(diphenylphosphino)methane (DPPM) functionalized amidine ligand (DPPM&#8722;C(N-Dipp)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H) (Dipp=2,6-diisopropylphenyl) was synthesized. Subsequent deprotonation with suitable alkali metal bases resulted in the corresponding complexes [M{DPPM&#8722;C(N-Dipp)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}(L&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;)] (M=Li, Na, K, Rb, Cs; L=thf, Et&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O). The alkali metal complexes form monomeric species in the solid state, exhibiting intramolecular metal-&#960;-interactions. In addition, a caesium derivative [Cs{PPh&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-C(N-Dipp)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}]&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; was obtained by cleavage of a diphenylphosphino moiety, forming an unusual six-membered ring structure in the solid state. All complexes were fully characterized by single crystal X-ray diffraction, NMR spectroscopy, IR spectroscopy as well as elemental analysis. Furthermore, the photoluminescent properties of the complexes were thoroughly investigated, revealing differences in emission with regards to the respective alkali metal. Interestingly, the hexanuclear [Cs{PPh&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-C(N-Dipp)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}]&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; metallocycle exhibits a blue emission in the solid state, which is significantly red-shifted at low temperatures. The bifunctional design of the ligand, featuring orthogonal donor atoms (N vs. P) and a high steric demand, is highly promising for the construction of advanced metal and main group complexes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Novel Strategy to Design and Construct AIE&#8208;active Mechanofluorochromic Materials via Regulation of Molecular Structure</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, tetraphenylene&#8208;fused aryl&#8208;imidazole derivatives were synthesized and investigated with regulation of molecular structure. The results illustrated that these compounds exhibited obvious AIE characteristics. The multiple rotors (pyridine and benzene rings) causes twisted conformations of the molecules that prevents &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking and enhances solid&#8208;state emission. Significantly, two of these compounds also exhibited reversible mechanochromic behavior with color changes between blue and green emissions.







Abstract
In this work, we first designed and synthesized tetraphenylene&#8208;fused aryl&#8208;imidazole derivatives TM&#8208;1&#8211;4 via regulation of molecular structure, which were consisted of 1H&#8208;imidazo[4,5&#8208;f][1,10]phenanthroline, 1H&#8208;phenanthro[9,10&#8208;d]imidazole, 4,5&#8208;diphenyl&#8208;1H&#8208;imidazole, 3,3&#8242;&#8208;(1H&#8208;imidazole&#8208;4,5&#8208;diyl)dipyridine moieties and AIE&#8208;active tetraphenylethene units, respectively. The results illustrated that TM&#8208;1&#8211;4 exhibited clear AIE characteristics. Meanwhile, TM&#8208;2 and TM&#8208;3 show excellent solid emission properties (&#934;TM&#8208;2=13.73&#8201;% and &#934;TM&#8208;3=36.21&#8201;%), whereas TM&#8208;1 and TM&#8208;4 exhibit the opposite properties (&#934;TM&#8208;1=1.48&#8201;% and &#934;TM&#8208;4=4.83&#8201;%). The multiple rotors (pyridine and benzene ring) causes twisted conformations of the molecule that prevents &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking and enhances solid emission(&#934;TM&#8208;2&lt;&#934;TM&#8208;3, &#934;TM&#8208;1&lt;&#934;TM&#8208;4). Significantly, TM&#8208;2 and TM&#8208;3 also exhibited reversible mechanochromic behavior (Emission red shifts: &#916;&#955;TM&#8208;2=43&#8197;nm and &#916;&#955;TM&#8208;3=41&#8197;nm) with color changes between blue and green emissions. The powder X&#8208;ray diffraction (PXRD) suggested the disordered state of ground sample could be readily returned to an ordered crystalline. Therefore, the mechanochromisms of TM&#8208;2 and TM&#8208;3 are ascribable to the phase transformation between crystal and amorphous structure. The single crystal X&#8208;ray analysis of TM&#8208;2 reveals a twisted conformation for TPE moiety and the absence of &#960;&#8208;&#960; intermolecular stacking. These excellent optical properties of TM&#8208;2 and TM&#8208;3 make them potentially applications in mechanochromic materials and imaging agents.

         <title>A Study in Red: The Overlooked Role of Azo&#8208;Moieties in Polymeric Carbon Nitride Photocatalysts with Strongly Extended Optical Absorption</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The unique optical and photoredox properties of heptazine&#8208;based polymeric carbon nitride (PCN) materials make them promising semiconductors for driving various productive photocatalytic conversions. However, their typical absorption onset at ca. 430&#8208;450 nm is still far from optimum for efficient sunlight harvesting.  Despite many reports of successful attempts to extend the light absorption range of PCNs, the determination of the structural features responsible for the red shift of the light absorption edge beyond 450 nm has often been obstructed by the highly disordered structure of PCNs and/or low content of the moieties responsible for changes in optical and electronic properties. In this work, we implement a high&#8208;temperature (900 &#176;C) treatment procedure for turning the conventional melamine&#8208;derived yellow PCN into a red carbon nitride. This approach preserves the typical PCN structure but incorporates a new functionality that promotes visible light absorption. A detailed characterization of the prepared material reveals that partial heptazine fragmentation accompanied by de&#8208;ammonification leads to the formation of azo&#8208;groups in the red PCN, a chromophore moiety whose role in shifting the optical absorption edge of PCNs has been overlooked so far. These azo moieties can be activated under visible&#8208;light (470 nm) for H  2  evolution even without any additional co&#8208;catalyst, but are also responsible for enhanced charge&#8208;trapping and radiative recombination, as shown by spectroscopic studies.</dc:description>

         <title>Insights on Luminescent Micro&#8208; and Nanospheres of Infinite Coordination Polymers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Coordination polymers have been extensively studied in recent years. Some of these materials can exhibit several properties such as permanent porosity, high surface area, thermostability and light emission, as well as open sites for chemical functionalization. Concerning the fact that this kind of compounds are usually solids, the size and morphology of the particles are important parameters when an application is desired. Inside this context, there is a subclass of coordination polymers, named Infinite Coordination Polymers (ICPs), which auto&#8208;organize as micro&#8208; or nanoparticles with low crystallinity. Specifically, the particles exhibiting spherical shapes and reduced sizes can be better dispersed, enter cells much easier than bulk crystals and be converted to inorganic materials by topotactic transformation. Luminescent ICPs, in particular, can find applications in several areas, such as sensing probes, light&#8208;emitting devices and bioimaging. In this review, we present the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art of ICP&#8208;based spherical particles, including the growth mechanisms, some applications for luminescent ICPs and the challenges to overcome in future commercial usage of these materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Transition Metal&#8208;Catalyzed Hydroalkoxylation of Alkynes: An Overview</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydroalkoxylation of alkynes has come fore as one of the reliable method for the construction of oxygen bearing entities. In this domain, plethora of strategies describing hydroalkoxylation/hydroalkoxylation accompanied cascade reactions of alkynes have been reported for the construction of oxygen bearing complex heterocycles in a diastereo&#8208; as well as enantioselective manner.







Abstract
Oxygen&#8208;bearing motifs, mainly the congener heterocycles are ubiquitous due to their presence in various natural products and bioactive scaffolds. Although in literature, several strategies have been developed for their synthesis, hydroalkoxylation of alkynes has come forward as a method of choice and has been used extensively. In particular, hydroalkoxylation of alkynes has gained enormous attention from the synthetic community due to the rapid access to a very useful and reactive synthetic intermediate like &#8216;enol ether&#8217;. Furthermore, to manifold the utility of these methods, reports have been developed elaborating the generation of &#8216;enol ether&#8217; using hydroalkoxylation and their usage in various reactions in cascade or tandem manner. This review focuses on recent development on the hydroalkoxylation of alkynes for the synthesis of oxygen&#8208;containing entities.

         <title>Intermetallic Compounds: Liquid&#8208;Phase Synthesis and Electrocatalytic Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this minireview, the general thermodynamics for the formation of intermetallics have been discussed, followed by the introduction of two main approaches for the synthesis of intermetallics and the corresponding techniques. Then, the application of intermetallics in electrocatalysis has been illustrated case by case. Finally, perspectives on the development of intermetallics and the related catalysis have been proposed.







Abstract
Characterized by long&#8208;range atomic ordering, well&#8208;defined stoichiometry, and controlled crystal structure, intermetallics have attracted increasing attention in the area of chemical synthesis and catalytic applications. Liquid&#8208;phase synthesis of intermetallics has arisen as the promising methodology due to its precise control over size, shape, and resistance toward sintering compared with the traditional metallurgy. This short review tends to provide perspectives on the liquid&#8208;phase synthesis of intermetallics in terms of both thermodynamics and methodology, as well as its applications in various catalytic reactions. Specifically, basic thermodynamics and kinetics in the synthesis of intermetallics will be first discussed, followed by discussing the main factors that will affect the formation of intermetallics during synthesis. The application of intermetallics in electrocatalysis will be demonstrated case by case at last. We conclude the review with perspectives on the future developments with respect to both synthesis and catalytic applications.

         <title>Lewis Superacidic Tellurenyl Cation&#8208;Induced Electrophilic Activation of an Inert Carborane</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
B&#8722;H bond activation: The Lewis superacidic aryltellurenyl cation [2&#8208;(tBuNCH)C6H4Te]+ increases the Br&#248;nsted acidity of the weakly coordinating carborane anion (CB11H12)&#8722; by more than 120 orders of magnitude. Upon heating, the formal B&#8722;H bond is converted into an acidic N&#8722;H bond, while a Te&#8722;B bond is formed. A mechanism for the electrophilic substitution is proposed.







Abstract
The aryltellurenyl cation [2&#8208;(tBuNCH)C6H4Te]+, a Lewis super acid, and the weakly coordinating carborane anion [CB11H12]&#8722;, an extremely weak Br&#248;nsted acid (pKa=131.0 in MeCN), form an isolable ion pair complex [2&#8208;(tBuNCH)C6H4Te][CB11H12], in which the Br&#248;nsted acidity (pKa 7.4 in MeCN) of the formally hydridic B&#8722;H bonds is dramatically increased by more than 120 orders of magnitude. The electrophilic activation of B&#8722;H bonds in the carborane moiety gives rise to a proton transfer from boron to nitrogen at slightly elevated temperatures, as rationalized by the isolation of a mixture of the zwitterionic isomers 12&#8208; and 7&#8208;[2&#8208;(tBuN{H}CH)C6H4Te(CB11H11)] in ratios ranging from 62&#8201;:&#8201;38 to 80&#8201;:&#8201;20.

         <title>C4&#8217;&#8208;Fluorinated Oligodeoxynucleotides: Synthesis, Stability, Structural Studies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
4&#8217;&#8208;F&#8208;Thymidine was synthesized and introduced into DNA strands based on standard solid&#8208;phase DNA synthesis protocols. The 4&#8217;&#8208;F&#8208;thymidine in the context of DNA strand is rather stable in neutral buffers. Unlike native deoxyribonucleosides whose ribose predominantly exist in the South conformation, 4&#8217;&#8208;F&#8208;thymidine prefers the North conformation. Incorporation of 4&#8217;&#8208;F&#8208;deoxyribonucleoside into nucleic acids represents an advanced approach to modulate the local structure and, hence, the function of nucleic acids.







Abstract
Fluoro&#8208;substitution on the ribose moiety (e.&#8201;g., 2&#8217;&#8208;F&#8208;deoxyribonucleotide) represents a popular way to modulate the ribose conformation and, hence, the structure and function of nucleic acids. In the present study, we synthesized 4&#8217;&#8208;F&#8208;deoxythymidine (4&#8217;&#8208;FT) and introduced it to oligodeoxyribonucleotides (ODNs). Though scission of the glycosylic bond of 4&#8217;&#8208;FT followed by strand cleavage occurred to some extent under alkaline conditions, the 4&#8217;&#8208;FT&#8208;modified ODNs were rather stable in neutral buffers. NMR studies showed that like 2&#8217;&#8208;F&#8208;deoxyribonucleoside, 4&#8217;&#8208;FT exists predominantly in the North conformation not only in the nucleoside form but also in the context of ODN strands. Circular dichroism spectroscopy, thermal denaturing and RNase H1 footprinting studies of 4&#8217;&#8208;FT&#8208;modified ODN/cDNA and ODN/cRNA duplexes indicated that the North conformation tendency of 4&#8217;&#8208;FT is maintained in the duplexes, leading to a local structural perturbation. Collectively, 4&#8217;&#8208;F&#8208;deoxyribonucleotide structurally resembles the 2&#8217;&#8208;F&#8208;deoxyribonucleotide but imparts less structural perturbation to the duplex than the latter.

Core subjects: Two new early transition metal (Zr or Hf)&#8211;protected octaborane derivatives, [(Cp2MBH3)2B8H6] (Cp=&#951;5&#8208;C5H5; M=Zr (1&#8208;Zr) and Hf (1&#8208;Hf)) have been isolated and structurally characterized. The solid&#8208;state structures of both 1&#8208;Zr and 1&#8208;Hf comprise a B8 dodecahedron core protected by {Cp2MBH3} moieties on both sides of the cluster. The spectroscopic data also validate the intactness of the B8 dodecahedron core in the solution as well.







Abstract
Despite the synthesis and structural characterization of closo&#8208;hydroborate dianions, [BnHn]2&#8722; (n=6&#8211;12) more than 50&#8197;years ago, some ambiguity remains about the structure of [B8H8]2&#8722;. Although the solid&#8208;state structure of [B8H8]2&#8722; was established by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray studies in 1969, fast rearrangements in solution at accessible temperatures prevented its detailed characterization. We therefore stabilized a derivative of [B8H8]2&#8722; by using Cp2MBH3 and structurally characterized two new octaborane analogues, [(Cp2MBH3)2B8H6] (Cp=&#951;5&#8208;C5H5; M=Zr (1&#8208;Zr) and Hf (1&#8208;Hf)), so that the dynamics of the B8 skeleton were arrested. The solid&#8208;state structures of both 1&#8208;Zr and 1&#8208;Hf comprise a dodecahedron core protected by {Cp2MBH3} moieties on both sides of the cluster. Spectroscopic characterization (11B NMR) validates the intactness of the B8 dodecahedron core in solution as well. Theoretical calculations establish that the two exo&#8208;{Cp2MBH3} fragments provide structural and electronic structural stability to the B8 core and its intact dodecahedral dianionic nature. Furthermore, we propose isodesmic equations for the formation of higher analogues of the Bn core (n&gt;8) guarded by different group 4 transition metals. Our analysis suggests that, as we move to higher polyhedra (n&gt;10), the formation becomes unfavourable irrespective of metal.

Although the solid-state structure of [B&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; was established by single-crystal X-ray studies in 1969, fast rearrangements in solution at accessible temperatures prevented its detailed characterization. We therefore stabilized a derivative of [B&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; by using Cp&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;MBH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and structurally characterized two new octaborane analogues, [(Cp&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;MBH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;B&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;] (Cp=&#951;&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;-C&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;; M=Zr (&lt;b&gt;1-Zr&lt;/b&gt;) and Hf (&lt;b&gt;1-Hf&lt;/b&gt;)), so that the dynamics of the B&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; skeleton were arrested. The solid-state structures of both &lt;b&gt;1-Zr&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;1-Hf&lt;/b&gt; comprise a dodecahedron core protected by {Cp&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;MBH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;} moieties on both sides of the cluster. Spectroscopic characterization (&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;B NMR) validates the intactness of the B&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; dodecahedron core in solution as well. Theoretical calculations establish that the two &lt;i&gt;exo&lt;/i&gt;-{Cp&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;MBH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;} fragments provide structural and electronic structural stability to the B&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; core and its intact dodecahedral dianionic nature. Furthermore, we propose isodesmic equations for the formation of higher analogues of the B&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt; core (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;&amp;gt;8) guarded by different group 4 transition metals. Our analysis suggests that, as we move to higher polyhedra (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;&amp;gt;10), the formation becomes unfavourable irrespective of metal.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>N&#8208;Cyanation of Primary and Secondary Amines with Cyanobenzio&#8208;doxolone (CBX) Reagent</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
More stability, less toxicity: We demonstrate an efficient electrophilic N&#8208;cyanation of primary and secondary amines with a stable and less&#8208;toxic cyanobenziodoxole reagent. This synthetically practicable strategy allows the construction of a wide variety of cyanamides under very mild and simple conditions with a broad functional group compatibility, which provides a complementary method to existing procedures for the synthesis of cyanamides.







Abstract
An efficient electrophilic N&#8208;cyanation of amines with a stable and less&#8208;toxic cyanobenziodoxole reagent towards the synthesis of cyanamides is disclosed. This synthetically practicable strategy allows the construction of a wide variety of cyanamides under very mild and simple conditions with a broad functional group compatibility, and showcases a huge potential in late&#8208;stage modification of complex molecules.

         <title>Impact of Surface Defects on LaNiO3 Perovskite Electrocatalysts for the Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Promoting renewable energy production: LaNiO3 perovskite electrocatalysts have been prepared by a sol&#8208;gel protocol. Subsequent calcination at 700&#8201;&#176;C yields a macroporous material with modest surface area. Hydrogen reduction induces surface defects, in particular a high concentration of surface oxygen vacancies. The resulting electrocatalyst exhibits a significantly higher current density at lower overpotential, with faster kinetics and superior stability for oxygen evolution for water splitting.







Abstract
Perovskite oxides are regarded as promising electrocatalysts for water splitting due to their cost&#8208;effectiveness, high efficiency and durability in the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Despite these advantages, a fundamental understanding of how critical structural parameters of perovskite electrocatalysts influence their activity and stability is lacking. Here, we investigate the impact of structural defects on OER performance for representative LaNiO3 perovskite electrocatalysts. Hydrogen reduction of 700&#8201;&#176;C calcined LaNiO3 induces a high density of surface oxygen vacancies, and confers significantly enhanced OER activity and stability compared to unreduced LaNiO3; the former exhibit a low onset overpotential of 380&#8197;mV at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and a small Tafel slope of 70.8&#8197;mV&#8201;dec&#8722;1. Oxygen vacancy formation is accompanied by mixed Ni2+/Ni3+ valence states, which quantum&#8208;chemical DFT calculations reveal modify the perovskite electronic structure. Further, it reveals that the formation of oxygen vacancies is thermodynamically more favourable on the surface than in the bulk; it increases the electronic conductivity of reduced LaNiO3 in accordance with the enhanced OER activity that is observed.

         <title>A Diazirine&#8208;Modified Membrane Lipid to Study Peptide/Lipid Interactions &#8211; Chances and Challenges</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Can diazirine&#8208;modified lipids be used to locate the position of UV&#8208;induced cross&#8208;links between this lipid and a membrane peptide by using MS? Although DiazPC fulfils all prerequisites for a photo&#8208;activatable membrane lipid to study protein/lipid interactions and the cross&#8208;links can be exactly assigned, we observed a backfolding of the lipid's alkyl chain. This is a general phenomenon for any type of membrane lipids with a hydrophilic group in the alkyl chain.







Abstract
Although incorporation of photo&#8208;activatable lipids into membranes potentially opens up novel avenues for investigating interactions with proteins, the question of whether diazirine&#8208;modified lipids are suitable for such studies, remains under debate. Focusing on the potential for studying lipid/peptide interactions by cross&#8208;linking mass spectrometry (XL&#8208;MS), we developed a diazirine&#8208;modified lipid (DiazPC), and examined its behaviour in membranes incorporating the model &#945;&#8208;helical peptide LAVA20. We observed an unexpected backfolding of the diazirine&#8208;containing stearoyl chain of the lipid. This surprising behaviour challenges the potential application of DiazPC for future XL&#8208;MS studies of peptide and protein/lipid interactions. The observations made for DiazPC most likely represent a general phenomenon for any type of membrane lipids with a polar moiety incorporated into the alkyl chain. Our finding is therefore of importance for future protein/lipid interaction studies relying on modified lipid probes.

The excited coinage metal catch, or how to form luminescent hetero&#8208;bimetallic lanthanide coinage metal compounds. The cover picture depicts how the ligand system dpfam, represented by an octopus, can form preformed lanthanide scaffolds that can catch silver or gold cations. Upon excitation of the system, the octopus can force the two different metal centres to interact. The new deep&#8208;sea dwellers obtained illuminate the dark ocean and reveal a new class of interesting hetero&#8208;bimetallic compounds.

There is a pressing engineering need to produce hexagonal SiGe, that is untemplated, to be able to develop optoelectronic devices with hex&#8208;SiGe and Si integrated on the same chip. We have contributed the timely, broad&#8208;interest advance of producing a bulk hexagonal SiGe landscape and explain how and under what conditions each Si&#8211;Ge composition becomes hexagonal. Moreover, the ability to synthesize different hexagonal polytypes affords further tailoring of optoelectronic properties. More information can be found in the Full Paper by G. Serghiou et&#8197;al.

         <title>From the {FeIII2Ln2} butterfly's perspective: the magnetic benefits and challenges of cooperativity within 3d&#8208;4f based coordination clusters</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this perspective review we discuss the tuning handles which can be used to steer the magnetic properties of FeIII&#8208;4f &#8220;butterfly&#8221; compounds. The majority of presented compounds were produced in the context of project A3 &#8220;Di&#8208; to tetranuclear compounds incorporating highly anisotropic paramagnetic metal ions&#8221; within the SFB/TRR88 &#8220;3MET&#8221;. These contain {FeIII2Ln2} cores encapsulated in ligand shells which are easy to tune in a &#8220;test&#8208;bed&#8221; system. We identify the following advantages and variables in such systems: (i) the complexes are structurally simple usually with one crystallographically independent FeIII and LnIII, respectively. This simplifies theory and anaylsis; (ii) choosing Fe allows 57Fe M&#246;ssbauer spectroscopy to be used as an additional technique which can give information about oxidation levels and spin states, local moments at the iron nuclei and spin&#8208;relaxation and, more importantly, about the anisotropy not only of the studied isotope, but also of elements interacting with this isotope; (iii) isostructural analogues with all the available (i.e. not Pm) 4f ions can be synthesised, enabling a systematic survey of the influence of the 4f ion on the electronic structure; (iv) this cluster type is obtained by reacting [FeIII3O(O2CR)6(L)3](X) (X = anion, L = solvent such as H2O, py) with an ethanolamine&#8208;based ligand L&#8217; and lanthanide salts. This allows to study analogues of [FeIII2Ln2(&#956;3&#8208;OH)2(L&#8217;)2(O2CR)6] using the appropriate iron trinuclear starting materials. (v) the organic main ligand can be readily functionalised, facilitating a systematic investigation of the effect of organic substituents on the ligands on the magnetic properties of the complexes. We describe and discuss 34 {MIII2Ln2} (M = Fe or in one case Al) butterfly compounds which have been reported up to 2020. The analysis of these gives perspectives for designing new SMM systems with specific electronic and magnetic signatures.</dc:description>

         <title>Tailoring the Properties of Optical Force Probes for Polymer Mechanochemistry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The correlation of mechanical properties of polymer materials with those of their molecular constituents is the foundation for their holistic comprehension and eventually for improved material designs and syntheses. Over the last decade, optical force probes (OFPs) were developed, shedding light on various unique mechanical behaviors of materials. The properties of polymers are diverse, ranging from soft hydrogels to ultra&#8208;tough composites, from purely elastic rubbers to viscous colloidal solutions, and from transparent glasses to super black dyed coatings. Only very recently, researchers started to develop tailored OFP solutions that account for such material requirements in energy (both light and force), in time, and in their spatially detectable resolution. We here highlight notable recent examples and identify future challenges in this emergent field.</dc:description>

         <title>Spin&#8208;Phonon Coupling and Slow&#8208;Magnetic Relaxation in Pristine Ferrocenium</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report the spin dynamic properties of non&#8208;substituted ferrocenium complexes. Ferrocenium shows a field&#8208;induced single&#8208;molecule magnet behaviour in DMF solution while cobaltocene lacks of slow spin relaxation neither in powder nor in solution. Multireference quantum mechanical calculations give a non&#8208;Aufbau orbital occupation for ferrocenium with small first excitation energy that agrees with the relatively large measured magnetic anisotropy for a transition metal S=1/2 system. The analysis of the spin relaxation shows an important participation of quantum tunnelling, Raman, direct and local&#8208;mode mechanisms which depend on temperature and the external field conditions. The calculation of spin&#8208;phonon coupling constants for the vibrational modes shows that the first vibrational mode, despite having a low spin&#8208;phonon constant, is the most efficient process for the spin relaxation at low temperatures. In such conditions, vibrational modes with higher spin&#8208;phonon coupling constants are not populated. Additionally, the vibrational energy of this first mode is in excellent agreement with the experimental fitted value obtained from the local&#8208;mode mechanism.</dc:description>

         <title>Design, Synthesis and Structural Analysis of Glucocerebrosidase Imaging Agents</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Gaucher disease (GD) is a lysosomal storage disorder caused by inherited deficiencies in &#946;&#8208;glucocerebrosidase (GBA). Current treatments require rapid disease diagnosis and a means of monitoring therapeutic efficacy, both of which may be supported by the use of GBA&#8208;targeting activity&#8208;based probes (ABPs). Here, we report the synthesis and structural analysis of a range of cyclophellitol epoxide and aziridine inhibitors and ABPs for GBA. We demonstrate their covalent mechanism&#8208;based mode of action and uncover binding of the new  N&#8208;  functionalised aziridines to the ligand binding cleft. These inhibitors became scaffolds for the development of ABPs; the O6&#8208;fluorescent tags of which bind in an allosteric site at the dimer interface. Considering GBA&#8217;s preference for O6&#8208; and  N  &#8208;functionalised reagents, we synthesised a bi&#8208;functional aziridine ABP which we hoped would offer a more powerful imaging agent. Whilst this ABP binds to two unique active site clefts of GBA, no further benefit in potency was achieved over our first generation ABPs. Nevertheless, such ABPs should serve useful in the study of GBA in relation to GD and inform the design of future probes.</dc:description>

         <title>Breathing&#8208;Assisted Selective Adsorption of C8 Alkyl Aromatics in Zn&#8208;Based Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks</title>

Breathing exercises: Two Zn&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic frameworks showed reversible structural flexibility through the breathing phenomenon upon the addition and removal of guest molecules. Moreover, these two MOF compounds demonstrated selective sorption of C8 alkyl aromatics in their binary mixtures.







Abstract
The breathing phenomenon in metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) has revealed supramolecular host&#8208;guest interactions that could be beneficial for chemical separation in numerous industrial applications. The cost&#8208;effective purification of C8 alkyl aromatics such as o&#8208;xylene, m&#8208;xylene, p&#8208;xylene, and ethylbenzene remains challenging owing to their similar molecular structures, boiling points, kinetic diameters, polarities, etc. Herein, we report two Zn&#8208;based pillar&#8208;bilayered MOFs, denoted [Zn2(aip)2(pillar)] (aip=5&#8208;aminoisophthalic acid; pillar: bpy=4,4&#8217;&#8208;bipyridine or bpe=1,2&#8208;bis(4&#8208;pyridyl)ethane) that exhibit a breathing effect depending on the adsorbed guest molecules.

     alt="Breathing-Assisted Selective Adsorption of C8 Alkyl Aromatics in Zn-Based Metal-Organic Frameworks"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Breathing exercises&lt;/b&gt;: Two Zn-based metal-organic frameworks showed reversible structural flexibility through the breathing phenomenon upon the addition and removal of guest molecules. Moreover, these two MOF compounds demonstrated selective sorption of C&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; alkyl aromatics in their binary mixtures.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The breathing phenomenon in metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) has revealed supramolecular host-guest interactions that could be beneficial for chemical separation in numerous industrial applications. The cost-effective purification of C&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; alkyl aromatics such as &lt;i&gt;o&lt;/i&gt;-xylene, &lt;i&gt;m&lt;/i&gt;-xylene, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;-xylene, and ethylbenzene remains challenging owing to their similar molecular structures, boiling points, kinetic diameters, polarities, etc. Herein, we report two Zn-based pillar-bilayered MOFs, denoted [Zn&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(aip)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(pillar)] (aip=5-aminoisophthalic acid; pillar: bpy=4,4&#8217;-bipyridine or bpe=1,2-bis(4-pyridyl)ethane) that exhibit a breathing effect depending on the adsorbed guest molecules. Guest-dependent sorption studies in organic solvents such as &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-dimethylformamide, methanol, benzene, and water vapor display reversible structural flexibility through the breathing effect in both framework compounds. The experiments conducted on C&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;-alkyl aromatics resulting in both MOF compounds can access these isomers in the shrunken pores, and thereby expand the pore size by framework breathing. In C&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; binary mixtures, these Zn-MOFs exhibit selective sorption properties based on the different interactions between guest C&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; aromatics and the framework structure.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Inherent Reactivity of Spiro&#8208;Activated Electrophilic Cyclopropanes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The kinetics of the ring&#8208;opening reactions of thiophenolates with geminal bis(acceptor)&#8208;substituted cyclopropanes in DMSO at 20 &#176;C was monitored by photometric methods. The determined second&#8208;order rate constants of the S  N  2 reactions followed linear relationships with Mayr nucleophilicity parameters (  N  /  s  N  ) and Br&#248;nsted basicities (p  K  aH  ) of the thiophenolates as well as with Hammett substituent parameters (&#963;) for groups attached to the thiophenolates. Phenyl&#8208;substituted cyclopropanes reacted by up to a factor of 15 faster than their unsubstituted analogues, in accord with the known activating effect of adjacent &#960;&#8208;systems in S  N  2 reactions. Variation of electronic properties of substituents at the phenyl groups of the cyclopropanes gave rise to parabolic Hammett relationships. Thus, inherent S  N  2 reactivity of electrophilic cyclopropanes is activated by electron&#8208;rich &#960;&#8208;systems because of more advanced C1&#8208;C2 bond polarization in the transition state. On the other hand, also electron&#8208;poor &#960;&#8208;systems lower the energetic barriers for the attack of anionic nucleophiles owing to attractive electrostatic interactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyldiphosphatetrahedrane as a Source of 1,2&#8208;Diphosphacyclobutadiene Ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reactions of iron and cobalt metalates with di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyldiphosphatetrahedrane readily afford 1,2&#8208;diphosphacyclobutadiene complexes. The corresponding 1,3&#8208;isomers were accessed by dimerisation of tert&#8208;butylphosphaalkyne on the metal centre. The reactivity of 1,2&#8208; and 1,3&#8208;diphosphacyclobutadiene cobaltates toward electrophiles was studied and the electronic structures of the new metalates were investigated by spectroscopy and quantum chemical calculations.







Abstract
Reactions of di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyldiphosphatetrahedrane (1) with cycloocta&#8208;1,5&#8208;diene&#8208; or anthracene&#8208;stabilised metalate anions of iron and cobalt consistently afford complexes of the rarely encountered 1,2&#8208;diphosphacyclobutadiene ligand, which have previously been very challenging synthetic targets. The subsequent reactivity of 1,2&#8208;diphosphacyclobutadiene cobaltates toward various electrophiles has also been investigated and is compared to reactions of related 1,3&#8208;diphosphacyclobutadiene complexes. The results highlight the distinct reactivity of such isomeric species, showing that the 1,2&#8208;isomers can act as precursors for previously unknown triphospholium ligands. The electronic structures of the new complexes were investigated by several methods, including NMR, EPR and M&#246;&#223;bauer spectroscopies as well as quantum chemical calculations.

         <title>Revisiting Alkane Hydroxylation with m&#8208;CPBA (m&#8208;Chloroperbenzoic Acid) Catalyzed by Nickel(II) Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydroxylation of alkanes with m&#8208;CPBA (m&#8208;chloroperbenzoic acid) catalyzed by NiII&#8208;complexes was investigated. Based on the detailed mechanistic studies, we propose that both (L)NiII&#8722;O. and aroyloxyl radical species generated by the O&#8722;O bond homolysis of a (L)NiII&#8208;m&#8208;CPBA adduct a contribute to the hydrogen atom abstraction process from the substrates in the alkane hydroxylation reaction.







Abstract
Mechanistic studies are performed on the alkane hydroxylation with m&#8208;CPBA (m&#8208;chloroperbenzoic acid) catalyzed by nickel(II) complexes, NiII(L). In the oxidation of cycloalkanes, NiII(TPA) acts as an efficient catalyst with a high yield and a high alcohol selectivity. In the oxidation of adamantane, the tertiary carbon is predominantly oxidized. The reaction rate shows first&#8208;order dependence on [substrate] and [NiII(L)] but is independent on [m&#8208;CPBA]; vobs=k2[substrate][NiII(L)]. The reaction exhibited a relatively large kinetic deuterium isotope effect (KIE) of 6.7, demonstrating that the hydrogen atom abstraction is involved in the rate&#8208;limiting step of the catalytic cycle. Furthermore, NiII(L) supported by related tetradentate ligands exhibit apparently different catalytic activity, suggesting contribution of the NiII(L) in the catalytic cycle. Based on the kinetic analysis and the significant effects of O2 and CCl4 on the product distribution pattern, possible contributions of (L)NiII&#8722;O. and the aroyloxyl radical as the reactive oxidants are discussed.

         <title>An Adjustable Cleft Based on an 8&#8208;Sulfonamide&#8208;2&#8208;Naphthoic Acid with Oxyanion Hole Geometry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The torsion angle around the sulfonamide bond gives these oxyanion hole&#8208;like receptors a variable size cleft. As stronger H&#8208;bonds imply shorter distances between H&#8208;bond donors and acceptors, these clefts with sulfonamide and carboxamide functions might be of interest in catalysis. X&#8208;ray crystal structures confirm the formation of two strong linear H&#8208;bonds between the NHs and carbonyl or alcohol oxygens, showing the adaptability of the cleft.







Abstract
Cleft type receptors showing the oxyanion hole motif have been prepared in a straightforward synthesis starting from the commercial 3,7&#8208;dihidroxy&#8208;2&#8208;naphthoic acid. The double H&#8208;bond donor pattern is achieved by the introduction of a sulfonamide group in the C&#8208;8 position of naphthalene and a carboxamide at the C&#8208;2 position. This cleft, for which the geometry resembles that of an oxyanion hole, is able to adjust to different guests, as shown by the analysis of the X&#8208;ray crystal structures of associates with methanol or acetic acid. Combination of hydrogen bonds and charge&#8208;transfer interactions led to further stabilization of the complexes, in which the electron&#8208;rich aromatic ring of the receptor was close in space to the electron&#8208;deficient dinitroaromatic guests. Modelling studies and bidimensional NMR experiments have been carried out to provide additional information.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The torsion angle&lt;/b&gt; around the sulfonamide bond gives these oxyanion hole-like receptors a variable size cleft. As stronger H-bonds imply shorter distances between H-bond donors and acceptors, these clefts with sulfonamide and carboxamide functions might be of interest in catalysis. X-ray crystal structures confirm the formation of two strong linear H-bonds between the NHs and carbonyl or alcohol oxygens, showing the adaptability of the cleft.

         <dc:description>The innate immunity TLR4/MD&#8208;2 system is a membrane receptor of paramount importance as therapeutic target. Its assembly, upon binding of Gram&#8208;negative bacteria lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and also dependent on the membrane composition, finally triggers the immune response cascade. We here combine  ab&#8208;initio  calculations, molecular docking, all&#8208;atom molecular dynamics simulations, and thermodynamics calculations to provide the most realistic and complete 3D models of the active full TLR4 complex embedded into a realistic membrane to date. Our studies reveal functional and structural insights into the transmembrane domain behavior in different membrane environments, the ectodomain bouncing movement, and the dimerization patterns of the intracellular TIR domain. Our work provides TLR4 models as reasonable 3D structures for the (TLR4/MD&#8208;2/LPS)  2  architecture accounting for the active (agonist) state of the TLR4, and pointing to a signal transduction mechanism across cell membrane. These observations unveil relevant molecular aspects involved in the TLR4 innate immune pathways and will promote the discovery of new TLR4 modulators.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Antimony pentafluoride is a strong Lewis acid and fluoride&#8208;ion acceptor that has not previously demonstrated any discreet fluoride&#8208;ion donor properties. The first donor&#8208;stabilised [SbF4]+ cations were prepared from the autoionisation of SbF5 in the presence of bidentate N&#8208;donor ligands 2,2&#8217;&#8208;bipyridine (bipy) and 1,10&#8208;phenanthroline (phen) as their [SbF6]&#8211; salts. The [SbF4(N&#8211;N)][Sb2F11] (N&#8211;N = bipy, phen) salts were synthesised by the addition of one equivalent of SbF5&#183;SO2 to [SbF4(N&#8211;N)][SbF6] in liquid SO2. The salts show remarkable stability and were characterised by Raman spectroscopy and multinuclear NMR spectroscopy. The crystal structures of [SbF4(phen)][SbF6]&#8729;3CH3CN and [SbF4(phen)][SbF6]&#8729;2SO2 were determined, showing distorted octahedral cations. DFT calculations and NBO analyses reveal that significant degree of electron&#8208;pair donation from N to Sb stabilizes [SbF4]+ with the Sb&#8211;N bond strength being ca. &#160;of that of the Sb&#8211;F bonds in these cations and the cationic charge being primarily ligand&#8208;centred.</dc:description>

         <title>Effect of Arylmethylene Substitutions on Molecular Structure, Optoelectronic Properties and Photovoltaic Performance of Dithienocyclopentafluorene&#8208;Based Small&#8208;Molecule Acceptors</title>

         <dc:description>
Arylmethylene&#8208;functionalized conjugated side chains: Two dithienocyclopentafluorene&#8208;based small&#8208;molecule acceptors (SMAs) featuring methylene&#8208;functionalized conjugated side chains have been developed to systemically investigate the impact of arylmethylene substitution and its number on molecular structure, optoelectronic properties and photovoltaic performance. Better light&#8208;harvesting properties and molecular planarity, lower bandgaps and higher LUMO levels are achieved, enabling improvements in device efficiency both for halogenated and non&#8208;halogenated processing solvents.







Abstract
Two dithienocyclopentafluorene&#8208;based small&#8208;molecule acceptors (SMAs) were developed that feature methylene&#8208;functionalized conjugated side chains, to study the effect of arylmethylene substitution and its number on structure, optoelectronic properties and device performance. Results showed that two SMAs have better absorption properties and planarity, lower bandgaps and higher LUMOs compared with the control SMA without conjugated side chains. The synthesized SMAs were tested in polymer solar cells for examples of their applicability. This work argues that the introduction of methylene&#8208;functionalized conjugated side chains has great potential in tuning molecular structure, optoelectronic properties, device physics and photovoltaic performance of SMAs.

         <title>Elastic organic crystals based on barbituric derivative: multifaceted bending and flexible optical waveguide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Elastic organic single crystals with light&#8208;emitting and multifaceted bending properties are extremely rare. They have potential application in optical materials and have attracted the extensive attention of researchers. In this paper, we reported a structurally simple barbituric derivative  DBDT  , which was easily crystallized and gained long needle&#8208;like crystals (centimeter&#8208;scale) in DCM/CH  3  OH (v/v=2/8). Upon applying or removing the mechanical force, both the (100) and (040) faces of the needle&#8208;like crystal showed reversible bending behaviour, showing the nature of multi&#8208;faceted bending. The average hardness (  H  ) and elastic modulus (  E  ) were 0.28 &#177; 0.01 GPa and 4.56 &#177; 0.03 GPa for the (040) plane, respectively. Through the analysis of the single crystal data, it could be seen that the van der waals (C&#8208;H&#183;&#183;&#183;&#960; and C&#8208;H&#183;&#183;&#183;C), H&#8208;bond (C&#8208;H&#183;&#183;&#183;O) and &#960;&#183;&#183;&#183;&#960; interactions between molecules were responsible for the generation of the crystal elasticity. Interestingly, elastic crystals exhibited optical waveguide characteristics in straight or bent state. The optical loss coefficients measured at 627 nm were 0.7 dBmm  &#8208;1  (straight state) and 0.9 dBmm  &#8208;1  (bent state), while the optical loss coefficient (&#945;) were 1.5 dBmm  &#8208;1  (straight state) and 1.8 dBmm  &#8208;1  (bent state) at 567 nm. Notably, the elastic organic molecular crystal based on barbituric derivative could be used as the candidate for flexible optical devices.</dc:description>

The optical loss coefficients measured at 627 nm were 0.7 dBmm  -1  (straight state) and 0.9 dBmm  -1  (bent state), while the optical loss coefficient (&#945;) were 1.5 dBmm  -1  (straight state) and 1.8 dBmm  -1  (bent state) at 567 nm. Notably, the elastic organic molecular crystal based on barbituric derivative could be used as the candidate for flexible optical devices.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Deuterated Indocyanine Green (ICG) with Extended Aqueous Storage Shelf&#8208;Life: Chemical and Clinical Implications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A deuterium atom in the right place mitigates the 60&#8208;year problem of aqueous Indocyanine Green (ICG) instability. A clinical stock solution of heavy ICG in water can be stored for an extended period without significant loss of fluorescence brightness; this will improve the effectiveness of various biomedical imaging, diagnostic and therapy procedures.







Abstract
Indocyanine Green (ICG) is a clinically approved near&#8208;infrared fluorescent dye that is used extensively for various imaging and diagnostic procedures. One drawback with ICG is its instability in water, which means that reconstituted clinical doses have to be used very shortly after preparation. Two deuterated versions of ICG were prepared with deuterium atoms on the heptamethine chain, and the spectral, physiochemical, and photostability properties were quantified. A notable mechanistic finding is that self&#8208;aggregation of ICG in water strongly favors dye degradation by a photochemical oxidative dimerization reaction that gives a nonfluorescent product. Storage stability studies showed that replacement of C&#8722;H with C&#8722;D decreased the dimerization rate constant by a factor of 3.1, and it is likely that many medical and preclinical procedures will benefit from the longer shelf&#8208;lives of these two deuterated ICG dyes. The discovery that ICG self&#8208;aggregation promotes photoinduced electron transfer can be exploited as a new paradigm for next&#8208;generation photodynamic therapies.

         <title>An Optimized Protocol for the Synthesis of Peptides Containing trans&#8208;Cyclooctene and Bicyclononyne Dienophiles as Useful Multifunctional Bioorthogonal Probes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 54, Page 13632-13641, September 24, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple methodology for the introduction of two strained dienophiles, bicyclononyne (BCN) and trans&#8208;cyclooctene (TCO), into synthetic peptides is presented. The method is based on the post&#8208;synthetic attachment of the clickable groups to lysine residues after selective deprotection steps. The resulting peptides can be used for construction of useful peptide conjugates in highly efficient and biocompatible manner via two orthogonal click reactions, the strain&#8208;promoted azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition (SPAAC) and the inverse electron&#8208;demand Diels&#8208;Alder reaction (iEDDA).







Abstract
Despite the great advances in solid&#8208;phase peptide synthesis (SPPS), the incorporation of certain functional groups into peptide sequences is restricted by the compatibility of the building blocks with conditions used during SPPS. In particular, the introduction of highly reactive groups used in modern bioorthogonal reactions into peptides remains elusive. Here, we present an optimized synthetic protocol enabling installation of two strained dienophiles, trans&#8208;cyclooctene (TCO) and bicyclononyne (BCN), into different peptide sequences. The two groups enable fast and modular post&#8208;synthetic functionalization of peptides, as we demonstrate in preparation of peptide&#8208;peptide and peptide&#8208;drug conjugates. Due to the excellent biocompatibility, the click&#8208;functionalization of the peptides can be performed directly in live cells. We further show that the introduction of both clickable groups into peptides enables construction of smart, multifunctional probes that can streamline complex chemical biology experiments such as visualization and pull&#8208;down of metabolically labeled glycoconjugates. The presented strategy will find utility in construction of peptides for diverse applications, where high reactivity, efficiency and biocompatibility of the modification step is critical.

         <title>Facile Preparation of CuCo2S4/Cu7.2S4 Nanocomposites as High&#8208;Performance Cathode Materials for Rechargeable Magnesium Batteries**
</title>

Moving one step further beyond lithium? A nanosized CuCo2S4/Cu7.2S4 material has been synthesized by a facile solvothermal method. Its excellent rate performance, outstanding cycling stability and pseudocapacitive energy storage properties give it promise for use as an efficient cathode material for rechargeable magnesium batteries.







Abstract
Rechargeable magnesium batteries (RMBs) have been considered a promising energy&#8208;storage device due to their high energy density and high safety, but they still suffer from a lack of high&#8208;rate performance and cycle performance of the cathode. Nanosized CuCo2S4/Cu7.2S4 composites have been synthesized for the first time by a facile solvothermal method. Herein, the magnesium ion storage behavior when applied in the cathode for RMBs is discussed. Electrochemical results demonstrated that the CuCo2S4/Cu7.2S4 composites exhibit a high initial discharge capacity of 256&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1 and 123&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 300&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1 at room temperature and an outstanding long&#8208;term cyclic stability over 300&#8197;cycles at 300&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1. Furthermore, the electrochemical storage mechanism demonstrated that the storage process of magnesium ion in the CuCo2S4/Cu7.2S4 cathode is mainly driven by strong pseudocapacitive effects.

A catalytic domino reduction / imine formation / intramolecular cyclization / oxidation allows the synthesis of a wide variety of biologically relevant N&#8208;polyheterocycles. The reported process employs an inexpensive and nontoxic dioxomolybdenum(VI) complex as catalyst, easily available nitroarenes as starting materials and different glycols as reducing agents with reuse of the waste reduction carbonyl byproduct, which is embodied into the final compounds.







Abstract
A catalytic domino reduction&#8211;imine formation&#8211;intramolecular cyclization&#8211;oxidation for the general synthesis of a wide variety of biologically relevant N&#8208;polyheterocycles, such as quinoxaline&#8208; and quinoline&#8208;fused derivatives, and phenanthridines, is reported. A simple, easily available, and environmentally friendly dioxomolybdenum(VI) complex has proven to be a highly efficient and versatile catalyst for transforming a broad range of starting nitroarenes involving several redox processes. Not only is this a sustainable, step&#8208;economical as well as air&#8208; and moisture&#8208;tolerant method, but also it is worth highlighting that the waste byproduct generated in the first step of the sequence is recycled and incorporated in the final target molecule, improving the overall synthetic efficiency. Moreover, selected indoloquinoxalines have been photophysically characterized in cyclohexane and toluene with exceptional fluorescence quantum yields above 0.7 for the alkyl derivatives.

Improving your memory: Combining the intrinsic sub&#8208;nanometer pore of pillar[5]arene with the nanometer pore structure of two&#8208;dimensional polymers provides a multichannel for Ag+ migration so that a ternary&#8208;state memristor based on the conductive filament mechanism could be designed. The obtained Ag/2DPTPAZ+TAPB/ITO devices show excellent ternary memory performance, including low threshold voltage, steady retention time, clearly distinguishable resistance states, high ON/OFF ratio, considerable ternary yield, and good thermal stability and flexibility.







Abstract
Nowadays, most manufacturing memory devices are based on materials with electrical bistability (i.&#8201;e., &#8220;0&#8221; and &#8220;1&#8221;) in response to an applied electric field. Memory devices with multilevel states are highly desired so as to produce high&#8208;density and efficient memory devices. Herein, we report the first multichannel strategy to realize a ternary&#8208;state memristor. We make use of the intrinsic sub&#8208;nanometer channel of pillar[5]arene and nanometer channel of a two&#8208;dimensional imine polymer to construct an active layer with multilevel channels for ternary memory devices. Low threshold voltage, long retention time, clearly distinguishable resistance states, high ON/OFF ratio (OFF/ON1/ON2=1&#8201;:&#8201;10&#8201;:&#8201;103), and high ternary yield (75&#8201;%) were obtained. In addition, the flexible memory device based on 2DPTPAZ+TAPB can maintain its stable ternary memory performance after being bent 500 times. The device also exhibits excellent thermal stability and can tolerate a temperature as high as 300&#8201;&#176;C. It is envisioned that the results of this work will open up possibilities for multistate, flexible resistive memories with good thermal stability and low energy consumption, and broaden the application of pillar[n]arene.

         <title>Determining the Diastereoselectivity of the Formation of Dipeptidonucleotides by NMR Spectroscopy</title>

The diastereoselectivity of the peptide coupling between aminoacidylnucleotides and amino acid esters in aqueous condensation buffer was determined by NMR spectroscopy. Homochiral dipeptides were found as the preferred products.







Abstract
Proteins are composed of l&#8208;amino acids, but nucleic acids and most oligosaccharides contain d&#8208;sugars as building blocks. It is interesting to ask whether this is a coincidence or a consequence of the functional interplay of these biomolecules. One reaction that provides an opportunity to study this interplay is the formation of phosphoramidate&#8208;linked peptido RNA from amino acids and ribonucleotides in aqueous condensation buffer. Here we report how the diastereoselectivity of the first peptide coupling of the peptido RNA pathway can be determined in&#8197;situ by NMR spectroscopy. When a racemic mixture of an amino acid ester was allowed to react with an 5&#8242;&#8208;aminoacidyl nucleotide, diastereomeric ratios of up to 72&#8201;:&#8201;28 of the resulting dipeptido nucleotides were found by integration of 31P&#8208; or 1H&#8208;NMR peaks. The highest diastereomeric excess was found for the homochiral coupling product d&#8208;Ser&#8208;d&#8208;Trp, phosphoramidate&#8208;linked to adenosine 5&#8242;&#8208;monophosphate with its d&#8208;ribose ring. When control reactions with an N&#8208;acetyl amino acid and valine methyl ester were run in organic solvent, the diastereoselectivity was found to be lower, with diastereomeric ratios&#8804;62&#8201;:&#8201;38. The results from the exploratory study thus indicate that the ribonucleotide residue not only facilitates the coupling of lipophilic amino acids in aqueous medium but also the formation of a homochiral dipeptide. The methodology described here may be used to search for other stereoselective reactions that shed light on the origin of homochirality.

         <title>Size&#8208;Controlled Hapticity Switching in [Ln(C9H9)(C8H8)] Sandwiches</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 54, Page 13558-13567, September 24, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of trivalent lanthanide heteroleptic sandwich complexes with the cyclooctatetraenyl (Cot) and cyclononatetraenyl (Cnt) ligands shows a significant bending of the Cnt ligand when the size of the ion decreases, implying a size&#8208;controlled hapticity switch.







Abstract
Sandwich complexes of lanthanides have recently attracted a considerable amount of interest due to their applications as Single Molecule Magnet (SMM). Herein, a comprehensive series of heteroleptic lanthanide sandwich complexes ligated by the cyclononatetraenyl (Cnt) and the cyclooctatetraenyl (Cot) ligand [Ln(Cot)(Cnt)] (Ln=Tb, Dy, Er, Ho, Yb, and Lu) is reported. The coordination behavior of the Cnt ligand has been investigated along the series and shows different coordination patterns in the solid&#8208;state depending on the size of the corresponding lanthanide ion without altering its overall anisotropy. Besides the characterization in the solid state by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and in solution by 1H NMR, static magnetic studies and ab initio computational studies were performed.

         <title>DNA&#8208;Triggered Enhancement of Singlet Oxygen Production by Pyridinium Alkynylanthracenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 54, Page 13591-13604, September 24, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
New pyridinium alkynylanthracenes are capable to generate singlet oxygen upon irradiation with green light only, when bound to polynucleotides by intercalation, whereas they slowly decompose when irradiated in water showing poor sensitization activity. Enhanced sensitization activity is observed upon interaction with AT but not GC base pairs. This makes them interesting for applications, where singlet oxygen has to be generated with local control.







Abstract
There is an ongoing interest in 1O2 sensitizers, whose activity is selectively controlled by their interaction with DNA. To this end, we synthesized three isomeric pyridinium alkynylanthracenes 2&#8201;o&#8211;p and a water&#8208;soluble trapping reagent for 1O2. In water and in the absence of DNA, these dyes show a poor efficiency to sensitize the photooxygenation of the trapping reagent as they decompose due to electron transfer processes. In contrast, in the presence of DNA 1O2 is generated from the excited DNA&#8208;bound ligand. The interactions of 2&#8201;o&#8211;p with DNA were investigated by thermal DNA melting studies, UV/vis and fluorescence spectroscopy, and linear and circular dichroism spectroscopy. Our studies revealed an intercalative binding with an orientation of the long pyridyl&#8208;alkynyl axis parallel to the main axis of the DNA base pairs. In the presence of poly(dA&#8201;:&#8201;dT), all three isomers show an enhanced formation of singlet oxygen, as indicated by the reaction of the latter with the trapping reagent. With green light irradiation of isomer 2&#8201;o in poly(dA&#8201;:&#8201;dT), the conversion rate of the trapping reagent is enhanced by a factor &gt;10. The formation of 1O2 was confirmed by control experiments under anaerobic conditions, in deuterated solvents, or by addition of 1O2 quenchers. When bound to poly(dG&#8201;:&#8201;dC), the opposite effect was observed only for isomers 2&#8201;o and 2&#8201;m, namely the trapping reagent reacted significantly slower. Overall, we showed that pyridinium alkynylanthracenes are very useful intercalators, that exhibit an enhanced photochemical 1O2 generation in the DNA&#8208;bound state.

Upon reaction of Fe(OAc)2, NHC, and EtMgBr, it was found that the NHC utilized determined the rate of &#946;&#8208;hydride elimination. Fe(0)&#8208;ethylene and Fe(II)&#8208;ethyl species were isolated and characterized by X&#8208;ray crystallography, 57Fe M&#246;ssbauer, and MCD spectroscopy. The Fe(0)&#8208;ethylene complexes were found to have a rare S=1 ground state. The Fe(II)&#8208;ethyl species were found to form cross&#8208;coupled product under stoichiometric reaction conditions.







Abstract
The high abundance, low toxicity and rich redox chemistry of iron has resulted in a surge of iron&#8208;catalyzed organic transformations over the last two decades. Within this area, N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) ligands have been widely utilized to achieve high yields across reactions including cross&#8208;coupling and C&#8722;H alkylation, amongst others. Central to the development of iron&#8208;NHC catalytic methods is the understanding of iron speciation and the propensity of these species to undergo reduction events, as low&#8208;valent iron species can be advantageous or undesirable from one system to the next. This study highlights the importance of the identity of the NHC on iron speciation upon reaction with EtMgBr, where reactions with SIMes and IMes NHCs were shown to undergo &#946;&#8208;hydride elimination more readily than those with SIPr and IPr NHCs. This insight is vital to developing new iron&#8208;NHC catalyzed transformations as understanding how to control this reduction by simply changing the NHC is central to improving the reactivity in iron&#8208;NHC catalysis.

         <title>Matrix Isolation Spectroscopic and Relativistic Quantum Chemical Study of Molecular Platinum Fluorides PtFn (n=1&#8211;6) Reveals Magnetic Bistability of PtF4</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 54, Page 13642-13650, September 24, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Spin cycle: The IR spectra of molecular platinum fluorides PtFn (n=1&#8211;6) isolated in rare&#8208;gas matrices are presented. PtF4 is formed almost quantitatively under blue light radiation of PtF6, while PtF5 and PtF3 were produced by subsequent UV radiation of PtF4. The coexistence of a singlet and a triplet electronic spin state of PtF4 caused by competing Jahn&#8208;Teller and spin&#8211;orbit coupling effects has been verified spectroscopically in the low&#8208;temperature matrix.







Abstract
Molecular platinum fluorides PtFn, n=1&#8211;6, are prepared by two different routes, photo&#8208;initiated fluorine elimination from PtF6 embedded in solid noble&#8208;gas matrices, and the reaction of elemental fluorine with laser&#8208;ablated platinum atoms. IR spectra of the reaction products isolated in rare&#8208;gas matrices under cryogenic conditions provide, for the first time, experimental vibrational frequencies of molecular PtF3, PtF4 and PtF5. Photolysis of PtF6 enabled a highly efficient and almost quantitative formation of molecular PtF4, whereas both PtF5 and PtF3 were formed simultaneously by subsequent UV irradiation of PtF4. The vibrational spectra of these molecular platinum fluorides were assigned with the help of one&#8208; and two&#8208;component quasirelativistic DFT computation to account for scalar relativistic and spin&#8211;orbit coupling effects. Competing Jahn&#8208;Teller and spin&#8211;orbit coupling effects result in a magnetic bistability of PtF4, for which a spin&#8208;triplet (3B2g, D2h) coexists with an electronic singlet state (1A1g, D4h) in solid neon matrices.

         <title>A 70&#8208;Year&#8208;Old Mystery in Technetium Chemistry Explained by the New Technetium Polyoxometalate&#160;[H7O3]4[Tc20O68]&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;4H2O</title>

The red product obtained upon concentration of an HTcO4 solution contains the [Tc20O68]4&#8722; polyanion, which is the first technetium polyanionic species reported. The [Tc20O68]4&#8722; species exhibits a molecular structure never observed before and consists of a square&#8208;planar Tc4O4 ring decorated by sixteen Tc(VII)O4 units. The red color is due to d&#8594;d electronic transitions between the Tc(V) atoms of the central ring.







Abstract
[H7O3]4[Tc20O68]&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;4H2O [1] was prepared from an aqueous Tc2O7 solution concentrated over anhydrous H2SO4. [Tc20O68]4&#8722; is the first polyanionic species to be reported for Tc. The unit cell contains one centrosymmetric [Tc20O68]4&#8722; polyanion as well as hydronium ions and water molecules. The core of the structure consists of four Tc(V)O6 octahedra that form a square Tc4O4 ring. The four Tc(V)O6 octahedra are decorated by sixteen Tc(VII)O4 tetrahedra. Calculations show the bonding within the Tc4O4 ring to consist of a 3&#8208;center bond formed between each neighboring pair of Tc atoms and their bridging oxygen. Calculations also indicate that a strong d&#8594;d electronic transition at 513&#8197;nm is the origin of the red color of [1]. The characterization of red HTcO4 solutions by X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy has complemented the description of this compound in aqueous solution. The formation mechanisms in solution, including the possible role of technetium's radioactivity in the formation of [1], are discussed.

         <title>A Comprehensive Study on the Full Series of Alkali&#8208;Metal Selenocyanates AI[SeCN] (AI=Li&#8722;Cs)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 54, Page 13552-13557, September 24, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
AI[SeCN] with AI=Li&#8722;Rb were synthesized by oxidation of cyanides with selenium or by metathesis (AI=Cs). Whereas all reactions proceed in solution, LiSeCN can only be obtained solvent free by ball milling. All compounds were crystallographically characterized, their structures optimized by DFT methods and their vibrational spectra recorded. DSC measurements showed congruent melting and allowed for extraction of the melting points.







Abstract
The full series of quasibinary alkali&#8208;metal selenocyanates was synthesized either by oxidation of the respective cyanides (A=Li&#8722;Rb) or by metathesis (A=Cs). For Li[SeCN] only ball&#8208;milling and subsequent annealing led to the isolation of the quasibinary selenocyanate. Their structures were refined from single&#8208;crystal and powder X&#8208;ray data. The respective solid&#8208;state IR and Raman spectra were interpreted with the aid of solid&#8208;state quantum&#8208;mechanical calculations and DSC&#8208;TGA measurements allowed for extraction of melting points. Only for Li[SeCN] a possible phase transition was observed that is discussed on the basis of VT&#8208;PXRD experiments. It is also the only quasibinary selenocyanate to form a hydrate (Li[SeCN]&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2H2O).

&lt;b&gt;[SeCN] with&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;i&gt;A&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt;=Li&#8722;Rb were synthesized by oxidation of cyanides with selenium or by metathesis (&lt;i&gt;A&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt;=Cs). Whereas all reactions proceed in solution, LiSeCN can only be obtained solvent free by ball milling. All compounds were crystallographically characterized, their structures optimized by DFT methods and their vibrational spectra recorded. DSC measurements showed congruent melting and allowed for extraction of the melting points.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The full series of quasibinary alkali-metal selenocyanates was synthesized either by oxidation of the respective cyanides (&lt;i&gt;A&lt;/i&gt;=Li&#8722;Rb) or by metathesis (&lt;i&gt;A&lt;/i&gt;=Cs). For Li[SeCN] only ball-milling and subsequent annealing led to the isolation of the quasibinary selenocyanate. Their structures were refined from single-crystal and powder X-ray data. The respective solid-state IR and Raman spectra were interpreted with the aid of solid-state quantum-mechanical calculations and DSC-TGA measurements allowed for extraction of melting points. Only for Li[SeCN] a possible phase transition was observed that is discussed on the basis of VT-PXRD experiments. It is also the only quasibinary selenocyanate to form a hydrate (Li[SeCN]&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O).&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>New Ideas for Understanding the Structure and Magnetism in AgF2: Prediction of Ferroelasticity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 54, Page 13582-13590, September 24, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
With the help of DFT calculations, we show that the experimental orthorhombic (Pbca) structure of the argentate AgF2, which displays an antiferromagnetic (AFM) order perpendicular to the long axis of the lattice, comes from a cooperative trigonal Jahn&#8208;Teller distortion of (AgF6)4&#8722; complexes in a cubic Pa&#8208;3 high&#8208;symmetry reference phase. As a consequence, the system, displaying three equivalent minima, is ferroelastic and displays a strong magneto&#8208;elastic effect that controls the orientation of the AFM order.







Abstract
In the search for new high&#8208;temperature superconductors, it has been proposed that there are strong similarities between the fluoroargentate AgF2 and the cuprate La2CuO4. We explored the origin of the possible layered structure of AgF2 by studying its parent high&#8208;symmetry phase and comparing these results with those of a seemingly analogous cuprate, CuF2. Our findings first stress the large differences between CuF2 and AgF2. Indeed, the parent structure of AgF2 is found to be cubic, naturally devoid of any layering, even though Ag2+ ions occupy trigonal sites that, nevertheless, allow the existence of a Jahn&#8208;Teller effect. The observed Pbca orthorhombic phase is found when the system is cooperatively distorted by a local E&#8855;e trigonal Jahn&#8208;Teller effect around the silver sites that creates both geometrical and magnetic layering. While the distortion implies that two Ag2+&#8722;F&#8722; bonds increase their distance by 15&#8201;% and become softer, our simulations indicate that covalent bonding and interlayer electron hopping is strong, unlike the situation in cuprate superconductors, and that, in fact, exfoliation of individual planes might be a harder task than previously suggested. As a salient feature, these results prove that the actual magnetic structure in AgF2 is a direct consequence of vibronic contributions involved in the Jahn&#8208;Teller effect. Finally, our findings show that, due to the multiple minima intrinsic to the Jahn&#8208;Teller energy surface, the system is ferroelastic, a property that is strongly coupled to magnetism in this argentate.

         <title>High&#8208;Temperature and Large&#8208;Polarization Ferroelectric with Second Harmonic Generation Response in a Novel Crown Ether Clathrate</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 54, Page 13575-13581, September 24, 2021. </description>

A modern material: A novel high&#8208;temperature host&#8208;guest inclusion ferroelectric, [(C6H5NF3)(18&#8208;crown&#8208;6)][BF4], has successfully been synthesized; it underwent a reversible structural phase transition around Tc=348&#8197;K, with a wide band gap of 4.43&#8197;eV. The chief contributors to this are the C, H and O atoms of the crystals, the obvious second harmonic generation response and the large value of spontaneous ferroelectric polarization of around 4.06&#8197;&#956;C/cm2.







Abstract
Molecular ferroelectrics of high&#8208;temperature reversible phase transitions are very rare and have attracted increasing attention in recent years. In this paper is described the successful synthesis of a novel high&#8208;temperature host&#8208;guest inclusion ferroelectric: [(C6H5NF3)(18&#8208;crown&#8208;6)][BF4] (1) that shows a pair of reversible peaks at 348&#8197;K (heating) and 331&#8197;K (cooling) with a heat hysteresis about 17&#8197;K by differential scanning calorimetry measurements, thus indicating that 1 undergoes a reversible structural phase transition. Variable&#8208;temperature PXRD and temperature&#8208;dependent dielectric measurements further prove the phase&#8208;transition behavior of 1. The second harmonic response demonstrates that 1 belongs to a non&#8208;centrosymmetric space group at room temperature and is a good nonlinear optical material. In its semiconducting properties, 1 shows a wide optical band gap of about 4.43&#8197;eV that comes chiefly from the C, H and O atoms of the crystals. In particular, the ferroelectric measurements of 1 exhibit a typical polarization&#8208;electric hysteresis loop with a large spontaneous polarization (Ps) of about 4.06&#8197;&#956;C/cm2. This finding offers an alternative pathway for designing new ferroelectric&#8208;dielectric and nonlinear optical materials and related physical properties in organic&#8208;inorganic and other hybrid crystals.

Among the different reactions that lead to the formation of C&#8722;C bonds, the Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura approach has a fundamental role, at the level of basic research and industrial applications. In particular, the palladium is usually the metal of the corresponding catalyst. The complexity of the reaction lies in the individual steps of the cycle, as well as in the generation of the catalytically active species. Here, through a chronology from the beginnings of cross coupling, how far the field has come is analyzed. For more information, see the Review by S. P. Nolan, A. Poater et&#8197;al. on page&#8197;13481.

         <dc:description>
In addition to avoiding the shuttling caused by soluble polysulfides, the design and preparation of sulfur cathodes for Li&#8722;S batteries must overcome challenges such as the low use of S, rapid decay of capacity and poor cycle life. This review spotlights recent progress in improving the performance of Li&#8722;S batteries by employing multifunctional metal phosphides as host materials. The current state of development of sulfur electrodes is summarized by emphasizing the relationship between the essential properties of metal phosphide&#8208;based hybrid nanomaterials, chemical reaction with lithium polysulfides and the latter's influence on electrochemical performance. Finally, trends in the development and practical applications of Li&#8722;S batteries are considered. For more information, see the Review by J. Yuan, J. Liu, et&#8197;al. on page 13494&#8197;ff.

The origin of homochirality is one of the unresolved issues of prebiotic chemistry. Why are the amino acids found in proteins of the l configuration? Perhaps peptido nucleotides could have played a role as transitional species, as suggested visually by the Archaeopteryx in the image. It was recently shown that these phosphoramidate&#8208;linked species form spontaneously from simple precursors. Now, the diastereoselectivity of the the dipeptide&#8208;forming step has been determined by in&#8208;situ NMR spectroscopy, revealing that homochiral products are preferred. This is reported in the Full Paper by C. Richert et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202101630).

Shining visible light and passing DC current through a carbon nitride material doped with copper atoms catalyzes the selective reduction of the greenhouse gas, carbon dioxide, to an important chemical intermediate, carbon monoxide. X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy was used to show how visible light increases the current and activity of the material. More information can be found in the Communication by R. Neumann et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202101820).

High&#8208;symmetry organometallic sandwiches of lanthanides are of current high interest because of their magnetic and optical properties. When trivalent lanthanide complexes feature the large monoanionic cyclononatetraenyl (Cnt) ligand, an interesting hapticity switching is observed along with a decrease in the size of the metal center. This cover shows the structural evolution from the terbium to the lutecium metal ion. More information can be found in the Full Paper by P.&#8197;W. Roesky, G. Nocton, et&#8197;al.

Being a good host: Metal phosphide&#8208;based hybrid materials have huge potential to boost the development of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density Li&#8722;S batteries. This review presents a comprehensive overview of recent progress in the use of metal phosphides for advanced Li&#8722;S batteries, in particular with a focus on the modified approaches, design principles, representative applications and development direction.







Abstract
For the past few years, a new generation of energy storage systems with large theoretical specific capacity has been urgently needed because of the rapid development of society. Lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8722;S) batteries are regarded as one of the most promising candidates for novel battery systems, since their resurgence at the end of the 20th century Li&#8722;S batteries have attracted ever more attention, attributed to their notably high theoretical energy density of 2600&#8197;W&#8201;h&#8201;kg&#8722;1, which is almost five times larger than that of commercial lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs). One of the determining factors in Li&#8722;S batteries is how to design/prepare the sulfur cathode. For the sulfur host, the major technical challenge is avoiding the shuttling effect that is caused by soluble polysulfides during the reaction. In past decades, though the sulfur cathode has developed greatly, there are still some enormous challenges to be conquered, such as low utilization of S, rapid decay of capacity, and poor cycle life. This article spotlights the recent progress and foremost findings in improving the performance of Li&#8722;S batteries by employing multifunctional metal phosphides as host materials. The current state of development of the sulfur electrode of Li&#8722;S batteries is summarized by emphasizing the relationship between the essential properties of metal phosphide&#8208;based hybrid nanomaterials, the chemical reaction with lithium polysulfides and the latter&#8242;s influence on electrochemical performance. Finally, trends in the development and practical application of Li&#8722;S batteries are also pointed out.

The complexity of the Pd&#8208;catalyzed Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura C&#8722;C bond formation reaction lies in the indivdual steps of the cycle, as well as in the generation of the catalytically active species. An overview of the topic is provided from a historical perspective.







Abstract
The story of C&#8722;C bond formation includes several reactions, and surely Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura is among the most outstanding ones. Herein, a brief historical overview of insights regarding the reaction mechanism is provided. In particular, the formation of the catalytically active species is probably the main concern, thus the preactivation is in competition with, or even assumes the role of the rate determining step (rds) of the overall reaction. Computational chemistry is key in identifying the rds and thus leading to milder conditions on an experimental level by means of predictive catalysis.

         <title>N&#8208;Type Quinoidal Polymers Based on Dipyrrolopyrazinedione for Application in All&#8208;Polymer Solar Cells</title>

Two intrinsic quinoidal conjugated polymers (PzDP&#8208;T and PzDP&#8208;ffT) based on dipyrrolopyrazinedione were developed for the use as polymer acceptors in all&#8208;polymer solar cells (all&#8208;PSCs). The all&#8208;PSCs with pseudo&#8208;bilayer structure exhibited PCEs of 1.33 and 2.37&#8201;% for PzDP&#8208;T and PzDP&#8208;ffT, respectively. This is the first report on the application of intrinsic quinoidal conjugated polymers in all&#8208;PSCs.







Abstract
Conjugated molecules and polymers with intrinsic quinoidal structure are promising n&#8208;type organic semiconductors, which have been reported for application in field&#8208;effect transistors and thermoelectric devices. In principle, the molecular and electronic characteristics of quinoidal polymers can also enable their application in organic solar cells. Herein, two quinoidal polymers, named PzDP&#8208;T and PzDP&#8208;ffT, based on dipyrrolopyrazinedione were synthesized and used as electron acceptors in all&#8208;polymer solar cells (all&#8208;PSCs). Both PzDP&#8208;T and PzDP&#8208;ffT showed suitable energy levels and wide light absorption range that extended to the near&#8208;infrared region. When combined with the polymer donor PBDB&#8208;T, the resulting all&#8208;PSCs based on PzDP&#8208;T and PzDP&#8208;ffT exhibited a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 1.33 and 2.37&#8201;%, respectively. This is the first report on the application of intrinsic quinoidal conjugated polymers in all&#8208;PSCs. The photovoltaic performance of the all&#8208;PSCs was revealed to be mainly limited by the relatively poor and imbalanced charge transport, considerable charge recombination. Detailed investigations on the structure&#8208;performance relationship suggested that synergistic optimization of light absorption, energy levels, and charge transport properties is needed to achieve more successful application of intrinsic quinoidal conjugated polymers in all&#8208;PSCs.

         <title>Stereospecific on&#8208;Surface Cyclodehydrogenation of Bishelicenes: Preservation of Handedness from Helical to Planar Chirality</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 54, Page 13523-13526, September 24, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Flattening helices while keeping the handedness: On&#8208;surface cyclodehydrogenation of bishelicene enantiomers leads stereospecifically to (M,M) and (P,P) chiral planar polyaromatic hydrocarbons. This is followed by their homochiral aggregation into a 2D conglomerate. Thermally induced cyclodehydrogenation proceeds stereospecifically to chiral, planar coronocoronene. Such a reaction is a special example of topochemistry in which enantiospecific conversion is supported by the alignment of the reactant by the surface.

         <title>Electrocatalytic H2 Generation from Water Relying on Cooperative Ligand Electron Transfer in &#8220;PN3P&#8221; Pincer&#8208;Supported NiII Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 54, Page 13518-13522, September 24, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Towards sustainable H2 production: To bring electrocatalytic hydrogen production into the sustainable realm, earth&#8208;abundant metal catalysts should function with water as the substrate. These newly reported hydrogen&#8208;generating catalysts of NiII are robust, stable in air and electrocatalytically reduce water to hydrogen with excellent Faradaic efficiency. Computations supplemented our understanding of a unique ligand&#8208;based electron transfer with the cooperativity of the PN3P ligand as an electron reservoir as a requirement for successful catalysis.







Abstract
Water is the most sustainable source for H2 production, and the efficient electrocatalytic production of H2 from mixed water/acetonitrile solutions by using two new air&#8208;stable nickel(II) pincer complexes, [Ni(&#954;3&#8208;2,6&#8208;{Ph2PNR}2(NC5H3)Br2] (R=H I, Me II) is reported. Hydrogen generation from H2O/CH3CN solutions is initiated at &#8722;2&#8197;V against Fc+/0, and bulk electrocatalysis studies showed that the catalyst functions with an excellent Faradaic efficiency and a turnover frequency of 160&#8197;s&#8722;1. A DFT computational investigation of the reduction behavior of I and II revealed a correlation of H2 formation with charge donation from electrons originating in a reduced ligand&#8208;localized orbital. As a result, these catalysts are proposed to proceed by a novel mechanism involving electron/proton transfer between a Ni0I species bonded to an anionic PN3P ligand (&#8220;L&#8722;/Ni0I&#8221;) and a NiI&#8208;hydride (&#8220;Ni&#8722;H&#8221;). Furthermore, these catalysts are able to reduce phenol and acetic acid, more active proton sources, at lower potentials that correlate with the substrate pKa.

Keep it simple: A sustainable approach (ethyl acetate under ambient conditions without metals, additives or irradiation) for the synthesis of di&#8208; and tetra&#8208;hydroquinolines bearing one or two SO2CF3 groups has been developed.A Convenient Formal [4+2] Heterocylization Route to Bis(triflyl)tetrahydroquinolines (L&#225;zaro&#8208;Milla and Almendros) @IQOG_CSIC







Abstract
We report the sustainable and efficient synthesis of a new type of quinoline derivatives bearing one or two SO2CF3 groups. The protocol is metal&#8208;, catalyst&#8208; and irradiation&#8208;free, involves the use of readily available and stable precursors, and avoids the formation of side products. Also, the mild conditions of the process allow the tolerance of a wide range of functional groups.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We report the sustainable and efficient synthesis of a new type of quinoline derivatives bearing one or two SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; groups. The protocol is metal-, catalyst- and irradiation-free, involves the use of readily available and stable precursors, and avoids the formation of side products. Also, the mild conditions of the process allow the tolerance of a wide range of functional groups.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Au nanoparticles co&#8208;functionalized with guanidiniocarbonyl pyrrole carboxylate zwitterions (GCPZ) and guanidiniocarbonyl pyrrole carboxylates (GCP) show a a multi&#8208;pH&#8208;controlled and temperature&#8208;controlled reversible self&#8208;assembly in water. When both binding motifs are installed in a carefully balanced ratio, the Au nanoparticles possess seven alternating regimes in which they are assembled/disassembled, simply controlled by pH and temperature.







Abstract
We report a pH&#8208; and temperature&#8208;controlled reversible self&#8208;assembly of Au&#8208;nanoparticles (AuNPs) in water, based on their surface modification with cationic guanidiniocarbonyl pyrrole (GCP) and zwitterionic guanidiniocarbonyl pyrrole carboxylate (GCPZ) binding motifs. When both binding motifs are installed in a carefully balanced ratio, the resulting functionalized AuNPs self&#8208;assemble at pH&#8197;1, pH&#8197;7 and pH&#8197;13, whereas they disassemble at pH&#8197;3 and pH&#8197;11. Further disassembly can be achieved at elevated temperatures at pH&#8197;1 and pH&#8197;13. Thus, we were able to prepare functionalized nanoparticles that can be assembled/disassembled in seven alternating regimes, simply controlled by pH and temperature.

         <title>Photoelectrochemical Reduction of Carbon Dioxide with a Copper Graphitic Carbon Nitride Photocathode</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 54, Page 13513-13517, September 24, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Copper substituted graphitic carbon nitride is shown to be a photoactive electrocatalyst for the two&#8208;electron reduction of CO2 to CO. Electrocatalytic activity as measured by yield and faradaic efficiency is increased upon irradiation with visible light. X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectra measured in the presence of visible light exhibit pronounced, &gt;1&#8197;eV, light&#8208;induced shifts to lower binding energies representing significant photoconductivity.







Abstract
Research on the photoreduction of CO2 often has been dominated by the use of sacrificial reducing agents. A pathway that avoids this problem would be the development of photocathodes for CO2 reduction that could then be coupled to a photoanodic oxygen evolution reaction. Here, we present the use of copper&#8208;substituted graphitic carbon nitride (Cu&#8722;CN) on a fluorinated tin oxide (FTO) electrode for the photoelectrochemical two&#8208;electron reduction of CO2 to CO as a major product (&gt;95&#8201;%) and formic acid (&lt;5&#8201;%). The results show that at a potential of &#8722;2.5&#8197;V versus Fc\Fc+ the CO2 reduction activity of Cu&#8722;CN on FTO electrode improves by 25&#8201;% upon illumination by visible light with a faradaic efficiency of nearly 100&#8201;%. Independently, X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy conclusively shows a pronounced increase in the electrical conductivity of the Cu&#8722;CN upon white light illumination under vacuum and a contactless measuring configuration. This photo&#8208;assisted charge mobility is shown to play a key role in the increased reactivity and faradaic efficiency for the reduction of CO2.

         <title>Electronic Structure and Superconductivity of Compressed Metal Tetrahydrides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Superconducting tetrahydrides: First&#8208;principles calculations show that the distance between the hydrogen atoms comprising the quasi&#8208;molecular H2 units in the metal tetrahydrides that emerge as being stable under pressure can be tuned via the choice of the metal, as well as chemical and physical pressure. Vibrations of the H&#8722;H bond are important for the superconducting mechanism.







Abstract
Tetrahydrides crystallizing in the ThCr2Si2 structure type have been predicted to become stable for a plethora of metals under pressure, and some have recently been synthesized. Through detailed first&#8208;principles investigations we show that the metal atoms within these 
 symmetry MH4 compounds may be divalent, trivalent or tetravalent. The valence of the metal atom and its radius govern the bonding and electronic structure of these phases, and their evolution under pressure. The factors important for enhancing superconductivity include a large number of hydrogenic states at the Fermi level, and the presence of quasi&#8208;molecular H
 units whose bonds have been stretched and weakened (but not broken) via electron transfer from the electropositive metal, and via a Kubas&#8208;like interaction with the metal. Analysis of the microscopic mechanism of superconductivity in MgH4, ScH4 and ZrH4 reveals that phonon modes involving a coupled libration and stretch of the H
 units leading to the formation of more complex hydrogenic motifs are important contributors towards the electron phonon coupling mechanism. In the divalent hydride MgH4, modes associated with motions of the hydridic hydrogen atoms are also key contributors, and soften substantially at lower pressures.

The first total syntheses of the Stemona alkaloid dehydrostenine A and the structure assigned to dehydrostenine B have been completed from a simple pyrrole substrate in 10 and 11 steps, respectively. Two independent Br&#248;nsted&#8208;acid&#8208;mediated intramolecular Michael additions were exploited to construct the tetracyclic dehydrostenine core. As a result of our synthetic studies and associated analysis of the relevant literature, we propose revisions of the structures originally assigned to dehydrostenines A and B.

Na3V2(PO4)3 (NVP) has been regarded as a potential cathode material for sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) due to its excellent structural stability and rapid Na+ conductivity. However, its electrochemical performances are restricted by the large bulk structure and poor electronic conductivity. The construction of porous NVP materials is a powerful method to improve the electrochemical properties. This concept aims to provide an overview of recent progress of porous NVP materials for SIBs. Herein, the synthetic strategies and formation mechanisms of porous NVP materials as well as the relationship between the porous structures and electrochemical performances of NVP materials are reviewed. Furthermore, the challenges and prospects for the preparation of porous NVP materials in this field are outlined.

         <title>Protection of Ag Clusters by Metal&#8208;Oxo Modules</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ag clusters protected by metal&#8208;oxo modules have emerged as the new stars of silver nanoclusters, exhibiting enhanced and unique properties. Three types of metal&#8208;oxo modules are identified in these systems. Some insights into fabricating such clusters and problems to be solved are discussed in this Concept article.







Abstract
Monodisperse and atomically precise Ag nanoclusters have attracted considerable recent research interest. A conventional silver cluster usually consists of a silver metallic kernel and an organic peripheral ligand shell. Nevertheless, the present inevitable problem is the unsatisfied stability of such nanoclusters. In this concept, we will give an introduction to Ag clusters protected by metal&#8208;oxo modules, which exhibit enhanced stability and unique properties. Accordingly, three different types of clusters are summarized: (1) Ag clusters protected by mononuclear oxometallates; (2) Ag clusters protected by block&#8208;like metal&#8208;oxo clusters; (3) Ag clusters protected by hollow&#8208;like metal&#8208;oxo clusters. The aim of this concept is to offer possible general guidance and insight into future rational design of more metal&#8208;oxo clusters protected silver clusters or even other coinage metal nanoclusters.

         <title>Amine&#8208;Directed Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed C&#8722;H Halogenation of Phenylalanine Derivatives</title>

         <dc:description>
The link is shown between a pioneering chemist's questioning &#8211; drawing and sharing thoughts on a blackboard &#8211; and a solution by means of modern catalytic tools &#8211; illustrated by computer lettering. Our question was how to regioselectively introduce a halogen atom into valuable phenylalanine derivatives without using a heavy protecting group in order to rapidly construct nonproteinogenic amino acids. The proposed solution was a Pd&#8208;catalyzed and sustainable regioselective C&#8722;H halogenation process directed by a native amine functional group. More information can be found in the Communication by G. Journot, C. Schneider, J.&#8208;F. Bri&#232;re et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202102411).

         <title>Low&#8208;Temperature Electrolyte Design for Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries: Prospect and Challenges</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lithium&#8208;ion batteries have dominated the energy market from portable electronic devices to electric vehicles. However, the LIBs applications are limited seriously when they were operated in the cold regions and seasons if there is no thermal protection. This is because the Li+ transportation capability within the electrode and particularly in the electrolyte dropped significantly due to the decreased electrolyte liquidity, leading to a sudden decline in performance and short cycle&#8208;life. Thus, design a low&#8208;temperature electrolyte becomes ever more important to enable the further applications of LIBs. Herein, we summarize the low&#8208;temperature electrolyte development from the aspects of solvent, salt, additives, electrolyte analysis, and performance in the different battery systems. Then, we also introduce the recent new insight about the cation solvation structure, which is significant to understand the interfacial behaviors at the low temperature, aiming to guide the design of a low&#8208;temperature electrolyte more effectively.</dc:description>

         <title>High Fidelity Enzyme&#8208;Free Primer Extension with an Ethynylpyridone Thymidine Analog</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>High fidelity base pairing is important for the transmission of genetic information. Weak base pairs can lower fidelity, complicating sequencing, amplification and replication of DNA.&#160; Thymidine 5'&#8208;monophosphate (TMP) is the most weakly pairing nucleotide among the canonical deoxynucleotides, causing high errors rates in enzyme&#8208;free primer extension. &#160;Here we report the synthesis of an ethynylpyridone  C  &#8208;nucleoside analog of 3'&#8208;amino&#8208;2',3'&#8208;dideoxythymidine monophosphate and its incorporation in a growing strand by enzyme&#8208;free primer extension. The ethynylpyridone  C  &#8208;nucleotide accelerates extension more than five&#8208;fold, reduces misincorporation and readily displaces TMP in competition experiments. The results bode well for the use of the  C  &#8208;nucleoside as replacements for thymidine in practical applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Development of the Peripheral Functionalization Chemistry of meso&#8208;Free Corroles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Since reliable synthetic methods for meso&#8208;free corroles were developed, the peripheral functionalization chemistry of corroles has blossomed again. In this Minireview, classical electrophilic reactions, SNAr reactions, and unique oxidation behavior are introduced, and their impact on the structures, electronic states, optical properties, and aromaticities of corroles are highlighted.







Abstract
In contrast to the extensive development of the meso&#8208;functionalization of porphyrins, that of corroles had rarely been explored until the development of practical synthetic methods for meso&#8208;free corroles in 2015. The ready availability of meso&#8208;free corroles opened up meso&#8208;functionalization chemistry of corroles, giving rise to successful synthesis of various meso&#8208;substituted corroles such as meso&#8208;halogen, meso&#8208;nitro, meso&#8208;amino, meso&#8208;oxo, and meso&#8208;iminocorroles as well as meso&#8211;meso&#8208;linked corrole dimers and corrole tapes. In some cases, 2NH corroles exist as stable or transient radical species. The impact of meso&#8208;functionalization on the structures, electronic properties, optical characteristics, and aromaticity of corroles are highlighted in this Minireview.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Since reliable synthetic methods&lt;/b&gt; for &lt;i&gt;meso&lt;/i&gt;-free corroles were developed, the peripheral functionalization chemistry of corroles has blossomed again. In this Minireview, classical electrophilic reactions, S&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;Ar reactions, and unique oxidation behavior are introduced, and their impact on the structures, electronic states, optical properties, and aromaticities of corroles are highlighted.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In contrast to the extensive development of the &lt;i&gt;meso&lt;/i&gt;-functionalization of porphyrins, that of corroles had rarely been explored until the development of practical synthetic methods for &lt;i&gt;meso&lt;/i&gt;-free corroles in 2015. The ready availability of &lt;i&gt;meso&lt;/i&gt;-free corroles opened up &lt;i&gt;meso&lt;/i&gt;-functionalization chemistry of corroles, giving rise to successful synthesis of various &lt;i&gt;meso&lt;/i&gt;-substituted corroles such as &lt;i&gt;meso&lt;/i&gt;-halogen, &lt;i&gt;meso&lt;/i&gt;-nitro, &lt;i&gt;meso&lt;/i&gt;-amino, &lt;i&gt;meso&lt;/i&gt;-oxo, and &lt;i&gt;meso&lt;/i&gt;-iminocorroles as well as &lt;i&gt;meso&#8211;meso&lt;/i&gt;-linked corrole dimers and corrole tapes. In some cases, 2NH corroles exist as stable or transient radical species. The impact of &lt;i&gt;meso&lt;/i&gt;-functionalization on the structures, electronic properties, optical characteristics, and aromaticity of corroles are highlighted in this Minireview.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>DNA Adduct Detection after Post&#8208;Labeling Technique with PCR Amplification (DNA&#8208;ADAPT&#8211;qPCR) Identifies the Pre&#8208;ribosomal RNA Gene as a Direct Target of Platinum&#8211;Acridine Anticancer Agents</title>

         <dc:description>
The DNA damage caused by a platinum&#8211;acridine agent in cancer cells was studied by using an assay that combines post&#8208;labeling of click chemistry&#8208;enabled DNA adducts, affinity pull&#8208;down purification, and PCR amplification. The method demonstrates that rDNA repeats are a cellular, and potentially pharmacological, target of the hybrid agents.







Abstract
To study the DNA damage caused by a potent platinum&#8211;acridine anticancer agent (PA) in cancer cells, an assay based on biorthogonal post&#8208;labeling using a click chemistry&#8208;enabled, azide&#8208;modified derivative (APA) was developed. The method involves biotinylation, affinity capture, and bead&#8208;based enrichment of APA&#8208;modified genomic DNA. The key steps of the assay were validated and optimized in model duplexes, including full&#8208;length plasmids, restriction fragments, and a DNA ladder. Native DNA treated with APA and subsequently subjected to post&#8208;labeling with a biotin affinity tag was enzymatically digested and fragments were analyzed by in&#8208;line LC&#8211;MS and MS/MS. The monofunctional&#8211;intercalative adducts formed by APA in 5&#8242;&#8208;pyrimidine/guanine sequences in double&#8208;stranded DNA were quantitatively biotinylated by strain&#8208;promoted 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloaddition chemistry. When applied to DNA extracted from A549 lung cancer cells, the assay in combination with qPCR amplification demonstrates that platinum&#8211;acridines form adducts in the gene sequences encoding pre&#8208;ribosomal RNA, a potential pharmacological target of these agents.

         <title>Constructing Highly Efficient Blue OLEDs with EQE up to 7.5% Based on Anthracene Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Acquiring desirable device performance with deep&#8208;blue color purity that fulfills practical application requirements is still a challenge. Bipolar fluorescent emitters with HLCT state may serve to address this issue. Herein, by inserting anthracene core in the deep&#8208;blue building blocks, we successfully developed two highly twisted D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A fluorescent emitters,  ICz&#8208;An&#8208;PPI  and  IP&#8208;An&#8208;PPI  , featuring different acceptor groups. Both exhibited superb thermal stabilities, high PLQYs and excellent bipolar transport capabilities. The non&#8208;doped OLEDs using  ICz&#8208;An&#8208;PPI  and  IP&#8208;An&#8208;PPI  as the emitting layers showed efficient blue emission with an EQE  max  of 4.32% and 5.41%, and the CIE coordinates of (0.147, 0.180) and (0.149, 0.150), respectively. In addition, the deep blue doped device based on  ICz&#8208;An&#8208;PPI  was achieved with an excellent CE  max  of 5.83 cd A  &#8208;1  , EQE  max  of 4.6% and the CIE coordinate of (0.148, 0.078), which is extremely close to the National Television Standards Committee (NTSC) standard. Particularly,  IP&#8208;An&#8208;PPI  &#8208;based doped device had better performance, with an EQE  max  of 7.51% and the CIE coordinate of (0.150, 0.118), which was very impressive among the recently reported deep&#8208;blue OLEDs with the CIE  y&#160;  &#65308;&#160;0.12. Such high performance may be attributed to the hot exciton HLCT mechanism via T  7  to S  2  . Our work may provide a new approach for designing high&#8208;efficiency deep&#8208;blue materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Fluorescent Supramolecular Organic Frameworks Constructed by Amidinium&#8208;Carboxylate Salt Bridges</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fluorescent supramolecular organic frameworks were constructed by linking the tetraphenylethylene&#8208;based tetra(amidinium) cation, TPE4+, and aromatic dicarboxylate anions through amidinium&#8208;carboxylate salt bridges. These self&#8208;assembled structures can be reversibly &#8220;broken up&#8221; and &#8220;reformed&#8221; in response to acid/base stimuli and are characterized by fluorescence quantum yields in the range of 4.6&#8201;%&#8764;14&#8201;%. This emissive behavior is ascribed to a combination of electrostatic interactions and hydrogen bonds that operate in concert to impede motions that would otherwise lead to excited state energy dissipation.







Abstract
We report here a set of fluorescent supramolecular organic frameworks (SOFs) that incorporate aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) units within their frameworks. The fluorescent SOFs of this study were constructed by linking the tetraphenylethylene (TPE)&#8208;based tetra(amidinium) cation TPE4+ and aromatic dicarboxylate anions through amidinium&#8208;carboxylate salt bridges. The resulting self&#8208;assembled structures are characterized by fluorescence quantum yields in the range of 4.6&#8764;14&#8201;%. This emissive behavior is ascribed to a combination of electrostatic interactions and hydrogen bonds that operate in concert to impede motions that would otherwise lead to excited state energy dissipation. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray di&#64256;raction analyses revealed that the length of the dicarboxylate anion bridges has a considerable impact on the structural features of the resulting frameworks. Nevertheless, all SOFs prepared in the context of the present study were found to display emissive features characteristic of TPE&#8208;based AIE luminogens with only a modest dependence on the structural specifics being seen. The SOFs reported here could be reversibly &#8220;broken up&#8221; and &#8220;reformed&#8221; in response to acid/base stimuli. This reversible structural behavior is consistent with their SOF nature.

         <title>Hybrid EuIII Coordination Luminophore Standing on Two Legs on Silica Nanoparticles for Enhanced Luminescence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hold tight, shine bright: A novel method for the development of lanthanide&#8208;based hybrid nanomaterials, taking advantage of an EuIII complex with an organic ligand covalently bound to the silica nanoparticle supports at two binding sites has been demonstrated. The hybrid nanoluminophore exhibited higher intrinsic luminescence quantum yield (93&#8201;%) and longer emission lifetime (0.98&#8197;ms), which is much larger than those of previous EuIII&#8208;based hybrid materials.







Abstract
In this study, we have demonstrated a two&#8208;legged, upright molecular design method for monochromatic and bright red luminescent LnIII&#8208;silica nanomaterials. A novel EuIII&#8208;silica hybrid nanoparticle was developed by using a doubly binding TPPO&#8722;Si(OEt)3 (TPPO: triphenyl phosphine oxide) linker. The TPPO&#8722;Si(OEt)3 was confirmed by 1H, 31P, 29Si NMR spectroscopy and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray analysis. Luminescent Eu(hfa)3 and Eu(tfc)3 moieties (hfa: hexafluoroacetylacetonate, tfc: 3&#8208;(trifluoromethylhydroxymethylene)camphorate) were fixed onto TPPO&#8722;Si(OEt)3&#8208;modified silica nanoparticles, producing Eu(hfa)3(TPPO&#8722;Si)2&#8208;SiO2 and Eu(tfc)3(TPPO&#8722;Si)2&#8208;SiO2, respectively. Eu(hfa)3(TPPO&#8722;Si)2&#8722;SiO2 exhibited the higher intrinsic luminescence quantum yield (93&#8201;%) and longer emission lifetime (0.98&#8197;ms), which is much larger than those of previously reported EuIII&#8208;based hybrid materials. Eu(tfc)3(TPPO&#8722;Si)2&#8722;SiO2 showed an extra&#8208;large intrinsic emission quantum yield (54&#8201;%), although the emission quantum yield for the precursor Eu(tfc)3(TPPO&#8722;Si(OEt)3)2 was found to be 39&#8201;%. These results confirmed that the TPPO&#8722;Si(OEt)3 linker is a promising candidate for development of EuIII&#8208;based luminescent materials.

Luminescent Eu(hfa)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and Eu(tfc)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; moieties (hfa: hexafluoroacetylacetonate, tfc: 3-(trifluoromethylhydroxymethylene)camphorate) were fixed onto TPPO&#8722;Si(OEt)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-modified silica nanoparticles, producing Eu(hfa)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(TPPO&#8722;Si)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and Eu(tfc)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(TPPO&#8722;Si)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, respectively. Eu(hfa)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(TPPO&#8722;Si)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8722;SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; exhibited the higher intrinsic luminescence quantum yield (93&#8201;%) and longer emission lifetime (0.98&#8197;ms), which is much larger than those of previously reported Eu&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt;-based hybrid materials. Eu(tfc)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(TPPO&#8722;Si)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8722;SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; showed an extra-large intrinsic emission quantum yield (54&#8201;%), although the emission quantum yield for the precursor Eu(tfc)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(TPPO&#8722;Si(OEt)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; was found to be 39&#8201;%. These results confirmed that the TPPO&#8722;Si(OEt)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; linker is a promising candidate for development of Eu&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt;-based luminescent materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Large Isotope Effects in Organometallic Chemistry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Kinetic isotope effects (KIEs, kH/kD) above the typical limit of 7 are reviewed, for organometallic reaction types from protonation of clusters to catalytic C&#8722;H activation. The KIEs are as large as 105, or even so large that reactivity is unobserved for deuterium. Large KIEs in organometallics have been explained by a combination of (a) proton tunneling, (b) compound effects from multiple steps, and (c) semi&#8208;classical effects on a single step.







Abstract
The kinetic isotope effect (KIE) is key to understanding reaction mechanisms in many areas of chemistry and chemical biology, including organometallic chemistry. This ratio of rate constants, kH/kD, typically falls between 1&#8211;7. However, KIEs up to 105 have been reported, and can even be so large that reactivity with deuterium is unobserved. We collect here examples of large KIEs across organometallic chemistry, in catalytic and stoichiometric reactions, along with their mechanistic interpretations. Large KIEs occur in proton transfer reactions such as protonation of organometallic complexes and clusters, protonolysis of metal&#8211;carbon bonds, and dihydrogen reactivity. C&#8722;H activation reactions with large KIEs occur with late and early transition metals, photogenerated intermediates, and abstraction by metal&#8208;oxo complexes. We categorize the mechanistic interpretations of large KIEs into the following three types: (a) proton tunneling, (b) compound effects from multiple steps, and (c) semi&#8208;classical effects on a single step. This comprehensive collection of large KIEs in organometallics provides context for future mechanistic interpretation.

         <title>Domino dehydrative &#960;&#8208;extension &#8211; a facile path to extended perylenes and terrylenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we report a new method of synthesis of extended perylenes and terrylenes. The technique is based on the cascade dehydrative &#960;&#8208;extensions (DPEX) of aryl aldehydes, where stepwise annulations activate previously &#8220;dormant&#8221; substituents. Two&#8208;fold and four&#8208;fold cyclizations of 3&#8208;aryl&#8208;biphenyl&#8208;2,2'&#8208;dicarbaldehydes offer a rapid path to unsymmetrical perylenes and elusive terrylene derivatives, respectively. DPEX of 3,3''&#8208;(phenanthrene&#8208;1,8&#8208;diyl)bis (([1,1'&#8208;biphenyl]&#8208;2,2'&#8208;dicarbaldehyde)) leads to the biradical structure, which in situ proceeds into oxidative electrocyclization at room temperature. The described domino process complements and expands DPEX approach to a large family of fused acenes and related PAHs.</dc:description>

The asymmetric catalytic synthesis of hexahydropyrrolo&#8208;isoquinolines by using a three&#8208;component 1,3&#8208;dipolar&#8208;cycloaddition reaction is investigated.







Abstract
An asymmetric three&#8208;component 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloaddition of 3,4&#8208;dihydroisoquinolines, bromoacetates and &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated pyrazole amide is realized by using a chiral N,N&#8217;&#8208;dioxide&#8208;Y(OTf)3 complex as the catalyst. The process includes a base&#8208;promoted formation of dihydroisoquinolium ylides in&#8197;situ, and a chiral Lewis acid&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric [3+2] cycloaddition with &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated pyrazole amides. A series of hexahydropyrrolo&#8208;isoquinolines are obtained in moderate to good yields with excellent diastereo&#8208; and enantioselectivities.

         <title>PdNi/Ni Nanotubes Assembled by Mesoporous Nanoparticles for Efficient Alkaline Ethanol Oxidation Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The mesoporous PdNi/Ni nanoparticles assembled nanotubes (mPdNi/Ni NTs) have been synthesized via replacement reaction, in which nickel nanowires serve as sacrificial template to form tubular structure and the diblock copolymer induce the formation of mesoporous structures. Due to the mesoporous nanoparticle structure and tubular geometry, the mPdNi/Ni NTs have better catalytic performance than mesoporous Pd nanotubes and commercial Pd black for ethanol oxidation reaction.







Abstract
The optimization of structure and composition is essential to improve the performance of catalysts. Herein, mesoporous nanoparticles assembled PdNi/Ni nanotubes (mPdNi/Ni NTs) are successfully fabricated using nickel nanowires as sacrificial template. The combination of nanotubular structure with mesoporous nanoparticle morphology can provide facilitated transfer channels and sufficient active sites, allowing the full contact and reaction between catalysts and reactants. Therefore, the synthesized mPdNi/Ni NTs exhibite superior ethanol oxidation performance to mesoporous Pd nanotubes and commercial Pd black. This study proposes a rational strategy for the development of nanoparticle assembled nanotubes with surface mesoporous morphology, which can greatly improve catalytic performance in various electrocatalytic fields.

         <title>Ultrahigh Rate Capability and Lifespan MnCo2O4/Ni&#8208;MOF Electrode for High Performance Battery&#8208;Type Supercapacitor</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanoflower structural MnCo2O4/Ni&#8208;MOF composite prepared by in&#8197;situ growth of Ni&#8208;MOF on the surface of MnCo2O4 nanorods derived from Co/Mn&#8208;MOF at 600&#8201;&#176;C has a high cycling stability and outstanding rate performance as supercapacitor electrode material.







Abstract
MnCo2O4 is derived from a Co/Mn bimetallic metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF). Then Ni&#8208;MOF is directly grown on the surface of the obtained MnCo2O4 to form a nano&#8208;flower structure with small balls. A large surface area, abundant active sites of MnCo2O4 and porosity of Ni&#8208;MOF allow the prepared MnCo2O4/Ni&#8208;MOF composite material to deliver an excellent electrochemical performance. At the same time, an appropriate thermal treatment temperature of the MnCo2O4 precursor is also very important for controlling the morphology of the obtained MnCo2O4 and electrochemical performances of the resulted composite material including electric conductivity, specific capacitance and rate performance. The prepared MnCo2O4&#8208;600/Ni&#8208;MOF shows an ultrahigh rate performance (when the current density increases from 1 to 10&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1, the capacitance retention rate is as high as 93.41&#8201;%) and good cycle stability (the assembled asymmetric supercapacitor advice delivers a capacitance retention rate of 94.74&#8201;% after 20&#8201;000 charge and discharge cycles) as well as a relatively high specific capacitance.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MnCo&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; is derived from a Co/Mn bimetallic metal-organic framework (MOF). Then Ni-MOF is directly grown on the surface of the obtained MnCo&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; to form a nano-flower structure with small balls. A large surface area, abundant active sites of MnCo&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and porosity of Ni-MOF allow the prepared MnCo&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;/Ni-MOF composite material to deliver an excellent electrochemical performance. At the same time, an appropriate thermal treatment temperature of the MnCo&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; precursor is also very important for controlling the morphology of the obtained MnCo&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and electrochemical performances of the resulted composite material including electric conductivity, specific capacitance and rate performance. The prepared MnCo&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;-600/Ni-MOF shows an ultrahigh rate performance (when the current density increases from 1 to 10&#8197;A&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, the capacitance retention rate is as high as 93.41&#8201;%) and good cycle stability (the assembled asymmetric supercapacitor advice delivers a capacitance retention rate of 94.74&#8201;% after 20&#8201;000 charge and discharge cycles) as well as a relatively high specific capacitance. These excellent electrochemical properties indicate that MnCo&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;/Ni-MOF has a good application prospect in the market.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

A novel two&#8208;dimensional porphyrin&#8208;based covalent organic framework with excellent crystallinity, high Brunauer&#8211;Emmett&#8211;Teller surface areas (1200&#8197;m2&#8201;g&#8722;1), wide light absorption range (200&#8208;1300&#8197;nm) and suitable band structure was successfully synthesized, and it functioned as an efficient metal&#8208;free heterogeneous photocatalytst for photocatalytic aerobic oxidative coupling of amines under the irradiation of white (400&#8211;830&#8197;nm), and red light (660&#8211;680&#8197;nm).







Abstract
Imines are important intermediates in drug synthesis. Photocatalytic aerobic oxidative coupling of amines has been considered as a clean and promising way to produce imines and has attracted great attention. Herein, we designed and synthesized a novel two&#8208;dimensional porphyrin&#8208;based covalent organic framework (Por&#8208;BC&#8208;COF) which adopts an AA stacking mode with excellent crystallinity, high Brunauer&#8211;Emmett&#8211;Teller surface areas (1200&#8197;m2&#8201;g&#8722;1), wide light absorption range (200&#8211;1300&#8197;nm) and good stability in a variety of organic solvents. Por&#8208;BC&#8208;COF can be used as a metal&#8208;free heterogeneous photocatalyst for the photocatalytic oxidation of amines to imines under visible light and red light with a high yield (97&#8201;%). This work presents a novel and efficient COF photocatalyst in the application of light&#8208;driven organic synthesis.

         <title>Photoinduced Water Oxidation in Chitosan Nanostructures Containing Covalently Linked RuII Chromophores and Encapsulated Iridium Oxide Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Restricted environment frees up reaction: Chitosan fibers with covalently linked RuII polypyridine complexes and encapsulated IrO2 nanoparticles exhibit a remarkable quantum yield of 0.21 for photoinduced water oxidation in sacrificial schemes. The restricted environment is held responsible for accelerating electron transfer steps, which are considered to be the basis of the efficiency of the overall photocatalytic process.







Abstract
The luminophore Ru(bpy)2(dcbpy)2+ (bpy=2,2&#8217;&#8208;bipyridine; dcbpy=4,4&#8217;&#8208;dicarboxy&#8208;2,2&#8217;&#8208;bipyridine) is covalently linked to a chitosan polymer; crosslinking by tripolyphosphate produced Ru&#8208;decorated chitosan fibers (NS&#8208;RuCh), with a 20&#8201;:&#8201;1 ratio between chitosan repeating units and RuII chromophores. The properties of the RuII compound are unperturbed by the chitosan structure, with NS&#8208;RuCh exhibiting the typical metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge&#8208;transfer (MLCT) absorption and emission bands of RuII complexes. When crosslinks are made in the presence of IrO2 nanoparticles, such species are encapsulated within the nanofibers, thus generating the IrO2&#8834;NS&#8208;RuCh system, in which both RuII photosensitizers and IrO2 water oxidation catalysts are within the nanofiber structures. NS&#8208;RuCh and IrO2&#8834;NS&#8208;RuCh have been characterized by dynamic light scattering, scanning electronic microscopy, and energy&#8208;dispersive X&#8208;ray analysis, which indicated a 2&#8201;:&#8201;1 ratio between RuII chromophores and IrO2 species. Photochemical water oxidation has been investigated by using IrO2&#8834;NS&#8208;RuCh as the chromophore/catalyst assembly and persulfate anions as the sacrificial species: photochemical water oxidation yields O2 with a quantum yield (&#934;) of 0.21, definitely higher than the &#934; obtained with a similar solution containing separated Ru(bpy)32+ and IrO2 nanoparticles (0.05) or with respect to that obtained when using NS&#8208;RuCh and &#8220;free&#8221; IrO2 nanoparticles (0.10). A fast hole&#8208;scavenging process (rate constant, 7&#215;104&#8197;s&#8722;1) involving the oxidized photosensitizer and the IrO2 catalyst within the IrO2&#8834;NS&#8208;RuCh system is behind the improved photochemical quantum yield of IrO2&#8834;NS&#8208;RuCh.

         <title>Supported CuII Single&#8208;Ion Catalyst for Total Carbon Utilization of C2 and C3 Biomass&#8208;Based Platform Molecules in the N&#8208;Formylation of Amines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Waste not, want not: Oxidative N&#8208;formylation of amines to formamides by sustainable C2 and C3 biomass&#8208;based carbonyl sources such as glycolic acid, 1,3&#8208;dihydroxyacetone and glyceraldehyde is catalyzed by very few CuII single sites in zeolite 5A with unprecedented 100&#8201;% utilization efficiency of carbon atoms.







Abstract
The shift from fossil carbon sources to renewable ones is vital for developing sustainable chemical processes to produce valuable chemicals. In this work, value&#8208;added formamides were synthesized in good yields by the reaction of amines with C2 and C3 biomass&#8208;based platform molecules such as glycolic acid, 1,3&#8208;dihydroxyacetone and glyceraldehyde. These feedstocks were selectively converted by catalysts based on Cu&#8208;containing zeolite 5A through the in&#8197;situ formation of carbonyl&#8208;containing intermediates. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first example in which all the carbon atoms in biomass&#8208;based feedstocks could be amidated to produce formamide. Combined catalyst characterization results revealed preferably single CuII sites on the surface of Cu/5A, some of which form small clusters, but without direct linking via oxygen bridges. By combining the results of electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spin&#8208;trapping, operando attenuated total reflection (ATR) IR spectroscopy and control experiments, it was found that the formation of formamides might involve a HCOOH&#8208;like intermediate and .NHPh radicals, in which the selective formation of .OOH radicals might play a key role.

         <dc:description>
In the search for bioactive organotellurium compounds, promising hypervalent TeIV&#8208;containing heterocycles with possible biological applications have been obtained. 125Te NMR of a series of 16 halogenated organotelluranes confirms that these products contain a Te&#8722;O bond within the five&#8208; or six&#8208;membered ring. We describe their synthesis, identification of the most favorable mechanism and diastereoselectivity, stability assays and in&#8197;vitro potential against L.&#8197;amazonensis.







Abstract
Inspired by the synthetic and biological potential of organotellurium substances, a series of five&#8208; and six&#8208;membered ring organotelluranes containing a Te&#8722;O bond were synthesized and characterized. Theoretical calculations elucidated the mechanism for the oxidation&#8208;cyclization processes involved in the formation of the heterocycles, consistent with chlorine transfer to hydroxy telluride, followed by a cyclization step with simultaneous formation of the new Te&#8722;O bond and deprotonation of the OH group. Moreover, theoretical calculations also indicated anti&#8208;diastereoisomers to be major products for two chirality center&#8211;containing compounds. Antileishmanial assays against Leishmania amazonensis promastigotes disclosed 1,2&#955;4&#8208;oxatellurane LQ50 (IC50=4.1&#177;1.0; SI=12), 1,2&#955;4&#8208;oxatellurolane LQ04 (IC50=7.0&#177;1.3; SI=7) and 1,2&#955;4&#8208;benzoxatellurole LQ56 (IC50=5.7&#177;0.3; SI=6) as more powerful and more selective compounds than the reference, being up to four times more active. A stability study supported by 125Te NMR analyses showed that these heterocycles do not suffer structural modifications in aqueous&#8208;organic media or at temperatures up to 65&#8201;&#176;C.

         <dc:description>In an assisted self&#8208;assembly approach starting from the [Mn  6  O  2  (piv)  10  (4&#8208;Me&#8208;py)  2  (pivH)  2  ] cluster a family of Mn&#8208;Ln compounds (Ln=Pr&#8208;Yb) was synthesised. The reaction of [Mn  6  O  2  (piv)  10  (4&#8208;Me&#8208;py)  2  (pivH)  2  ] (  1  ) with  N  &#8208;methyldiethanolamine (mdeaH  2  ) and Ln(NO  3  )  3  &#183;6H  2  O in MeCN generally yields two main structure types: for Ln=Tb&#8208;Yb a previously reported Mn  5  Ln  4  motif is obtained, while for Ln=Pr&#8208;Eu a series of Mn  7  Ln  3  clusters is obtained. Within this series the Gd  III  analogue represents a special case since it shows both structural types as well as a third Mn  2  Ln  2  inverse butterfly motif. Variation in reaction conditions allows access to different structure types across the whole series. This prompts further studies into the reaction mechanism of this cluster assisted self&#8208;assembly approach. For the Mn  7  Ln  3  analogues reported here variable&#8208;temperature magnetic susceptibility measurements suggest that antiferromagnetic interactions between the spin carriers are dominant. Compounds incorporating Ln=Nd  III  (  2  ), Sm  III  (  3  ) and Gd  III  (  5  ) display SMM behaviour. The slow relaxation of the magnetization for these compounds was confirmed by ac measurements above 1.8 K.</dc:description>

         <title>Determination of Relative Stabilities of Metal&#8208;Peptide Bonds in the Gas Phase</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Understanding binding site preferences in biological systems as well as affinities to binding partners is a crucial aspect in metallodrug development. We here present a mass spectrometrybased method to compare relative stabilities of metal&#8208;peptide adducts in the gas phase. Angiotensin 1 and substance P were used as model peptides. Incubation with isostructural N &#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) complexes of Ru II , Os II , Rh III , and Ir III led to the formation of various adducts, which were subsequently studied by energy&#8208;resolved fragmentation experiments. The gas phase stability of the metalpeptide bonds depended on the metal and the binding partner. Of the four complexes used, the Os II derivative binds strongest to Met, while Ru II forms the most stable coordination bond with His. Rh III was identified as the weakest peptide binder and Ir III formed peptide adducts with intermediate stability. Probing these intrinsic gas phase properties can help in the interpretation of biological activities and the design of site&#8208;specific protein binding metal complexes.</dc:description>

         <title>Designing a Red&#8208;Emitting Viscosity Sensitive BODIPY Fluorophore for Intracellular Viscosity Imaging</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Viscosity imaging at a microscopic scale can provide important information about biosystems, including the development of serious illnesses. Microviscosity imaging is achievable with viscosity&#8208;sensitive fluorophores, the most popular of which are based on the BODIPY group. However, most of the BODIPY probes fluoresce green light, whereas the red luminescence is desired for the imaging of biological samples. Designing a new viscosity probe with suitable spectroscopic properties is a challenging task because it is difficult to preserve viscosity sensitivity after modifying the molecular structure. Here we describe how we developed a new red&#8208;emitting, viscosity sensitive, BODIPY fluorophore BP&#8208;PH&#8208;2M&#8208;NO2 that is suitable for reliable intracellular viscosity imaging of lipid droplets in MCF&#8208;7 breast cancer cells. The design of BP&#8208;PH&#8208;2M&#8208;NO2 was aided by DFT calculations that allowed a successful prediction of the viscosity sensitivity of fluorophores before synthesis. In summary, we report a new red viscosity probe possessing monoexponential fluorescence decay that makes it attractive for lifetime&#8208;based viscosity imaging.</dc:description>

         <title>Hollow Carbon Sphere&#8208;Modified Graphitic Carbon Nitride for Efficient Photocatalytic H2 Production</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Spheres of influence: Hollow carbon nanospheres implanted in the surface plane of carbon nitride curly nanosheets were synthesized by thermal polymerization of freeze&#8208;dried urea and a NCS precursor. When the CN/NCS photocatalyst is irradiated by visible light, electron&#8208;hole pairs are generated in CN, then the electrons in the conduction bands of CN are transferred to the NCS. This results in efficient photocatalytic performance under visible light irradiation with a high H2 production rate and notable quantum yield.







Abstract
A novel hybrid photocatalyst composed of hollow carbon nanospheres (NCS) and graphitic carbon nitride (CN) curly nanosheets has been prepared by the calcination of a NCS precursor and freeze&#8208;dried urea. The optimized photocatalyst exhibits an efficient photocatalytic performance under visible light irradiation with a highest H2 generation rate of 3612.3&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1, leading to an apparent quantum yield of 10.04&#8201;% at 420&#8197;nm, five times higher than the widely reported benchmark photocatalyst CN (2.01&#8201;% AQY). The materials characterization shows that NCS&#8208;modified CN curly nanosheets can promote photoelectron transfer and suppress charge recombination through their special coupling interface and NCS as an electron acceptor, which significantly improves the photocatalytic efficiency. Thus, this study provides an efficient strategy for the design of highly efficient photocatalyst, particularly suitable for a totally metal&#8208;free photocatalytic system.

         <title>Lewis Acid&#8208;Promoted Oxidative Addition at a [Ni0(diphosphine)2] Complex: The Critical Role of a Secondary Coordination Sphere</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Oxidative addition represents a critical elementary step in myriad catalytic transformations. Here, the importance of thoughtful ligand design cannot be overstated. In this work, we report the intermolecular activation of iodobenzene (PhI) at a coordinatively saturated 18&#8208;electron [Ni0(diphosphine)2] complex bearing a Lewis acidic secondary coordination sphere. Whereas alkyl&#8208;substituted diphosphine complexes of Group 10 are known to be unreactive in such reactions, we show that [Ni0(P2BCy4)2](P2BCy4  =&#160;1,2&#8208;  bis  (di(3&#8208;dicyclohexylboraneyl)&#8208;propylphosphino)ethane)is competent for room&#8208;temperature PhI cleavage to give [NiII(P2BCy4)(Ph)(I)]. This difference in oxidative addition reactivity has been scrutinized computationally &#8211; an outcome that is borne out in ring&#8208;opening to provide the reactive precursor &#8211; for [Ni0(P2BCy4)2], a &#8220;boron&#8208;trapped&#8221; 16&#8208;electron&#160;k1  &#8208;diphosphine Ni(0) complex. Moreover, formation of [NiII(P2BCy4)(Ph)(I)] is inherent to the&#160;P  2  B  Cy  4  secondary coordination sphere: treatment of the Lewis adduct, [Ni0(P2BCy4)2(DMAP)  8  ] with PhI provides [Ni  II  (P  2  B  Cy  4  )  2  (DMAP)  8  (I)]I  via  iodine&#8208;atom abstraction and&#160;  not  a [Ni  II  (Ph)(I)(diphosphine)] compound &#8211; an interesting secondary sphere effect. Last, the reactivity of [Ni  0  (P  2  B  Cy  4  )  2  ] with 4&#8208;iodopyridine was surveyed, which resulted in a pyridyl&#8208;borane linked oligomer. The implications of these outcomes are discussed in the context of designing strongly donating, and yet labile diphosphine ligands for use in a critical bond activation step relevant to catalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Osmaindenes: Synthesis and Reversible Mechanochromism Characteristics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
New classes of osmaindenes bearing different substituents have been synthesized by nucleophilic reaction and fully characterized by NMR spectroscopy and elemental analysis. The solid&#8208;state fluorescence emissions, mechanochromism properties of these complexes have been explored. The experimental results indicated that different substituents play a role in regulating their solid&#8208;state fluorescence colors and all of the target molecules show reversible mechanochromism.







Abstract
A series of novel osmaindenes 1&#8211;6 bearing different substituents (CF3, H, I, Br, OCH3, N(Ph)2) has been synthesized by nucleophilic reaction of water with the corresponding aromatic osmanaphthalyne complexes. All osmaindenes 1&#8211;6 have been characterized by elemental analysis (EA) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, although the low solubilities of 3 and 4 precluded the accumulation of their 13C NMR spectra. Osmaindenes 2, 3 and 5 have also been characterized by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis. Subsequently, through solid&#8208;state fluorescence spectroscopy, mechanochromic studies, and powder X&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD) analysis, we found that osmaindenes 1&#8211;6 fluoresce at wavelengths in the range 500&#8211;800&#8197;nm, while also displaying reversible mechanochromic properties. The solid&#8208;state fluorescence emission of 1 after grinding extends into the near&#8208;infrared region. This research provides new insight into the design and synthesis of metallic materials with excellent mechanochromic properties.

         <title>Breathing Effect via Solvent Inclusions on the Linker Rotational Dynamics of Functionalized MIL&#8208;53</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The breathing effects of functionalized MIL&#8208;53 induced by the inclusion of water, methanol, acetone, and N,N&#8208;dimethylformamide solvents were comprehensively investigated by solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy. The alteration of NMR chemical shifts indicates the phase transitions from narrow pore to large pore forms. The host&#8208;guest interactions between confined solvents and MIL&#8208;53&#8208;NO2, MIL&#8208;53&#8208;CH3 would significantly reduce the rotational frequency of linkers.







Abstract
The breathing effects of functionalized MIL&#8208;53&#8208;X (X=H, CH3, NH2, OH, and NO2) induced by the inclusions of water, methanol, acetone, and N,N&#8208;dimethylformamide solvents were comprehensively investigated by solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy. 2D homo&#8208;nuclear correlation NMR provided direct experimental evidence for the host&#8208;guest interaction between the guest solvents and the MOF frameworks. The variations of the 1H and 13C&#8197;NMR chemical shifts in functionalized MIL&#8208;53 from the narrow pore phase transitions to large pore forms due to solvent inclusions were clearly identified. The influence of functionalized linkers and their host&#8208;guest interactions with the confined solvents on the rotational dynamics of the linkers was examined by separated&#8208;local&#8208;field MAS NMR experiments in conjunction with DFT theoretical calculations. It is found that the linker rotational dynamics of functionalized MIL&#8208;53 in narrow pore form is closely related to the computational rotational energy barrier. The BDC&#8208;NO2 linker of activated MIL&#8208;53&#8208;NO2 undergoes relatively faster rotation, whereas the BDC&#8208;NH2 and BDC&#8208;OH linkers of activated MIL&#8208;53&#8208;NH2 and MIL&#8208;53&#8208;OH exhibit relatively slower rotation. The host&#8208;guest interactions between confined solvents and MIL&#8208;53&#8208;NO2, MIL&#8208;53&#8208;CH3 would significantly induce an increase of the order parameters of unsubstituted carbon and reduce the rotational frequency of linkers. This study provides a spectroscopic approach for the investigation of linker rotation in functionalized MOFs at natural abundance with solvents inclusions.

Abstract
The 36&#8208;NiII&#8208;containing 54&#8208;tungsto&#8208;6&#8208;silicate, [Ni36(OH)18(H2O)36(SiW9O34)6]6&#8722; (Ni36) was synthesized by a simple one&#8208;pot reaction of the Ni2&#8208;pivalate complex [Ni2(&#956;&#8208;OH2)(O2CCMe3)4(HO2CCMe3)4] with the trilacunary [SiW9O34]10&#8722; polyanion precursor in water and structurally characterized by a multitude of physicochemical techniques including single&#8208;crystal XRD, FTIR, TGA, elemental analysis, magnetic and electrochemical studies. Polyanion Ni36 comprises six equivalent {NiII6SiW9} units which are linked by Ni&#8722;O&#8722;W bridges forming a macrocyclic assembly. Magnetic studies demonstrate that the {Ni6} building blocks in Ni36 remain magnetically intact while forming a hexagonal ring with antiferromagnetic exchange interactions between adjacent {Ni6} units. Electrochemical studies indicate that the first reduction is reversible and associated with the WVI/V couple, whereas the second reduction is irreversible attributed to the NiII/0 couple.

&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;SiW&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt;} units which are linked by Ni&#8722;O&#8722;W bridges forming a macrocyclic assembly. Magnetic studies demonstrate that the {Ni&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;} building blocks in &lt;b&gt;Ni&lt;sub&gt;36&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; remain magnetically intact while forming a hexagonal ring with antiferromagnetic exchange interactions between adjacent {Ni&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;} units. Electrochemical studies indicate that the first reduction is reversible and associated with the W&lt;sup&gt;VI/V&lt;/sup&gt; couple, whereas the second reduction is irreversible attributed to the Ni&lt;sup&gt;II/0&lt;/sup&gt; couple.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Helical Oligophenylene Linked with [2.2]Paracyclophane: Stereogenic &#960;&#8208;Conjugated Dye for Highly Emissive Chiroptical Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A stereogenic &#960;&#8208;system based on dimer (  2  ) and trimer (  3  ) of [2.2]paracyclophane (PC) and biphenyl was prepared and its structural, photophysical, and chiroptical properties were investigated. X&#8208;ray analysis revealed that the quaterphenyl moieties in  2  adopt a double helical structure anchoring [2.2]PC from both sides. Furthermore,  3  forms a isosceles triangle structure with a large chiral cavity. A homodesmotic reaction using DFT calculations revealed that  2  has a larger strain energy than  3  owing to its highly twisted phenylene linkers. Electronic and circular dichroic (CD) spectra were recorded in CH  2  Cl  2  solution. The spectra of both  2  and  3  are similar, and their longest absorption band accompanying a remarkable Cotton effect is attributed to the transition from HOMO to LUMO, which is delocalized to the quaterphenyl moiety. These compounds exhibit fairly high fluorescence quantum yields (  &#981;  = 0.70&#8211;0.82) and moderate dissymmetry factor (|  g  CPL  | = 1.6 &#215; 10  &#8211;3  ) in circularly polarized luminescence (CPL).</dc:description>

         <title>Switchable Chemoselectivity of Reactive Intermediates Formation and Their Direct Use in a Flow Microreactor</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We developed a chemoselectivity switchable flowmicro reaction to generate reactive and unstable intermediates. The switchable chemoselectivity of this reaction enables a selection for one of two different intermediates, an aryllithium or a benzyl lithium, at will from the same starting material. Starting from bromo&#8208;substituted styrenes, the aryllithium intermediates were converted to the substituted styrenes, whereas the benzyl lithium intermediates were engaged in an anionic polymerization. These chemoselectivity&#8208;switchable reactions can be integrated to produce polymers that cannot be formed during typical polymerization reactions.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The availability and synthesis of fluorinated enamine derivatives such as N&#8208;(3,3,3&#8208;trifluoropropenyl)heterocycles are challenging, especially through direct functionalization of the heterocyclic scaffold. Herein, we describe a stereoselective N&#8208;trifluoropropenylation method based on the use of a bench&#8208;stable trifluoropropenyl iodonium salt. This reagent enables the straightforward trifluoropropenylation of various N&#8208;heterocycles under mild reaction conditions, providing trifluoromethyl enamine type moieties with high stereoselectivity and efficiency.</dc:description>

         <title>Time&#8208;resolved spectroscopy and electronic structure of mono&#8208;and dinuclear pyridyl&#8208;triazole/DPEPhos based Cu(I) complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chemical and spectroscopic characterization of the mononuclear photosensitizers [(DPEPhos)Cu(I)(MPyrT)]  0/+  (  CuL  ,  CuLH  ) and their dinuclear analogues (  Cu  2  L&#8217;  ,  Cu  2  L&#8217;H  2  ), backed by (TD)DFT and high&#8208;level G  W  &#8208;Bethe&#8208;Salpeter equation calculations, exemplifies the complex influence of charge, nuclearity and structural flexibility on UV&#8208;induced photophysical pathways. Ultrafast transient absorption and step&#8208;scan FTIR spectroscopy reveal flattening distortion in the triplet state of  CuLH  as controlled by charge, which also appears to have a large impact on the symmetry of the long&#8208;lived triplet states in  Cu  2  L&#8217;  and  Cu  2  L&#8217;H  2  . Time&#8208;resolved luminescence spectroscopy (solid state), supported by transient photodissociation spectroscopy (gas phase), confirm a lifetime of some tens of &#181;s for the respective triplet states, as well as the energetics of thermally activated delayed luminescence, both being essential parameters for application of these materials based on earth&#8208;abundant copper in photocatalysis and luminescent devices.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A number of novel alkynyl&#8208;functionalized diarylbis(dimethylamino)diboranes(4) are prepared by salt metathesis, and the appended alkynyl groups are subjected to hydroboration.

The oligomeric species were found to comprise 4&#8208;19 repeat units and are soluble in common organic solvents. Some of the oligomeric species have good air stability and all were characterized by NMR and vibrational spectroscopy and size exclusion chromatography techniques.</dc:description>

         <title>Morphology Engineering of Fullerene (C60) Microstructures Featuring Surface Cracks with Enhanced Photoluminescence and Microscopic Recognition Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Surface cracks could improve the optical and photoelectronic properties of crystalline materials due to the increased specific surface area, but controlled self&#8208;assembly of fullerene (C60) molecules into micro&#8208;/nanostructures with surface cracks is still challenging. Herein, we report the morphology engineering of novel C60 microstructures bearing surface cracks for the first time, selecting phenetole and n&#8208;propanol (NPA) as the good and poor solvents, respectively. Our systematic investigations reveal that phenetole molecules initially participate in the formation of the ends of the C60 microstructures, and then NPA molecules are involved in the gradual growth of the sidewalls of the microstructures. Therefore, the surface cracks of C60 microstructures can be finely regulated by adjusting the addition of NPA and the crystallization time. Interestingly, the cracked C60 microstructures show superior photoluminescence properties relative to the smooth microstructures due to the increased specific surface area. Besides, C60 microstructures with wide cracks show preferential recognition of silica particles over C60 particles owing to electrostatic interactions between the negatively charged C60 microstructures and the positively charged silica microparticles. Our work introduces surface cracks into C60 crystals for the first time, demonstrating their potential applications from optoelectronics to biology.</dc:description>

         <title>Local field induced mass transfer: New insight in nano&#8208;electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Unravelling complex kinetics of electrocatalysis is essential for the design of electrocatalysts with high performance. Mass transfer and electron transfer are two primary factors need to be optimized in order to enhance electrocatalytic reaction. Utilization of nano&#8208;catalysts proves to be promising ways promoting performance of electrocatalytic reactions, which is usually attributed to their ability of enhancing the electron transfer. However, when catalysts downsize to the nanoscale, their size is comparable to the thickness of electrical double layer, so that curvatures of nano&#8208;catalysts may lead to inhomogeneous local electric field on the electrode, which then changes essentially the mass transfer. In this review, we introduce the new concept of local&#8208;field&#8208;induced mass transfer in nano&#8208;electrocatalytic systems, and provide a brief review of recent progresses revealing its effect on nano&#8208;electrocatalysis, which may bring new insight in future design of nano&#8208;electrocatalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Engineering Functional Interface with Built&#8208;in Catalytic and Self&#8208;Oxidation Sites for Highly Stable Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
More than a separator: An integrated functional interface on separator of lithium&#8722;sulfur battery is fabricated with graphene&#8208;wrapped MnCO3 nanowires (G@MC). The G@MC possesses &#8220;built&#8208;in&#8221; catalytic Mn2+ sites and good electronic conductivity, which endows the batteries with fast kinetic conversion of polysulfides and rapid electron transfer in electrochemical process. The reversible and strong chemical interaction between intermediates and G@MC is beneficial for achieving enhanced cycling stability and rate capability.







Abstract
Lithium&#8722;sulfur (Li&#8722;S) batteries have attracted great attention due to their high theoretical energy density. The rapid redox conversion of lithium polysulfides (LiPS) is effective for solving the serious shuttle effect and improving the utilization of active materials. The functional design of the separator interface with fast charge transfer and active catalytic sites is desirable for accelerating the conversion of intermediates. Herein, a graphene&#8208;wrapped MnCO3 nanowire (G@MC) was prepared and utilized to engineer the separator interface. G@MC with active Mn2+ sites can effectively anchor the LiPS by forming the Mn&#8722;S chemical bond according to our theoretical calculation results. In addition, the catalytic Mn2+ sites and conductive graphene layer of G@MC could accelerate the reversible conversion of LiPS via the spontaneous &#8220;self&#8208;redox&#8221; reaction and the rapid electron transfer in electrochemical process. As a result, the G@MC&#8208;based battery exhibits only 0.038&#8201;% capacity decay (per cycle) after 1000 cycles at 2.0&#8197;C. This work affords new insights for designing the integrated functional interface for stable Li&#8722;S batteries.

         <title>Photoswitchable Composite Polymer Electrolytes Using Spiropyran&#8208;Immobilized Nanoporous Templates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photoswitchable ionic conductivity of spiropyran&#8208;based composite polymer electrolyte is developed and demonstrated. The photoisomerization of the spiropyran derivative results in a tunable ionic conductivity with a maximum 30&#8201;% difference under UV and visible irradiations. The quantitative and qualitative ATR&#8208;FTIR data reveal the interactions of the ions and the grafted molecules at the interfaces. The knowledge obtained from this work provides a potential platform for synthetic electrolytes with tailored conducting functionality.







Abstract
Composite polymer electrolytes (CPEs) with smart, stimuli&#8208;responsive characteristics have gained considerable attention owing to their noninvasive manipulation and applications in future technologies. To address this potential, in this work, we demonstrate photoresponsive composite polymer electrolytes, consisting of gel polymer electrolyte (GPE) and spiropyran&#8208;immobilized nanoporous anodic aluminum oxide (SP&#8208;AAO) templates. Under UV irradiation, the close SP form isomerizes to the open merocyanine (MC) form, creating extremely polarized AAO surfaces; whereas, under visible light irradiation, the MC form reverts to the SP form, creating neutral surface conditions. The electrostatic interactions between ions and AAO surfaces are investigated by attenuated total reflection Fourier&#8208;transform infrared (ATR&#8208;FTIR) spectroscopy. Moreover, the behavior of ionic conductivity of the GPE@SP&#8208;AAO is found to be consistent with the kinetics of isomerization tracked by UV&#8208;Vis spectroscopy. This work provides a promising platform for developing next&#8208;generation photoelectronic smart devices.

         <title>Seven&#8208;Membered Cyclic Potassium Diamidoalumanyls</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Seven&#8208;membered cyclic potassium diamidoalumanyls react with toluene by reductive activation of a methyl C(sp3)&#8722;H bond and as a nucleophile with BPh3 and RN=C=NR (R=i&#8208;Pr, Cy) to yield the respective Al&#8208;B&#8208; and Al&#8208;C&#8208;bonded potassium aluminaborate and alumina&#8208;amidinate products. The dimeric structure of [{SiNDipp}AlK]2 can be disrupted by partial or complete sequestration of potassium with 18&#8208;cr&#8208;6 or 2,2,2&#8208;cryptand to provide either Al&#8722;K bonded or charge&#8208;separated species comprising the &#8216;free&#8217; alumanyl anion.







Abstract
The seven&#8208;membered cyclic potassium alumanyl species, [{SiNMes}AlK]2 [{SiNMes}={CH2SiMe2N(Mes)}2; Mes=2,4,6&#8208;Me3C6H2], which adopts a dimeric structure supported by flanking K&#8208;aryl interactions, has been isolated either by direct reduction of the iodide precursor, [{SiNMes}AlI], or in a stepwise manner via the intermediate dialumane, [{SiNMes}Al]2. Although the intermediate dialumane has not been observed by reduction of a Dipp&#8208;substituted analogue (Dipp=2,6&#8208;i&#8208;Pr2C6H3), partial oxidation of the potassium alumanyl species, [{SiNDipp}AlK]2, where {SiNDipp}={CH2SiMe2N(Dipp)}2, provided the extremely encumbered dialumane [{SiNDipp}Al]2. [{SiNDipp}AlK]2 reacts with toluene by reductive activation of a methyl C(sp3)&#8208;H bond to provide the benzyl hydridoaluminate, [{SiNDipp}AlH(CH2Ph)]K, and as a nucleophile with BPh3 and RN=C=NR (R=i&#8208;Pr, Cy) to yield the respective Al&#8208;B&#8208; and Al&#8208;C&#8208;bonded potassium aluminaborate and alumina&#8208;amidinate products. The dimeric structure of [{SiNDipp}AlK]2 can be disrupted by partial or complete sequestration of potassium. Equimolar reactions with 18&#8208;crown&#8208;6 result in the corresponding monomeric potassium alumanyl, [{SiNDipp}Al&#8722;K(18&#8208;cr&#8208;6)], which provides a rare example of a direct Al&#8722;K contact. In contrast, complete encapsulation of the potassium cation of [{SiNDipp}AlK]2, either by an excess of 18&#8208;cr&#8208;6 or 2,2,2&#8208;cryptand, allows the respective isolation of bright orange charge&#8208;separated species comprising the &#8216;free&#8217; [{SiNDipp}Al]&#8722; alumanyl anion. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations performed on this moiety indicate HOMO&#8208;LUMO energy gaps in the of order 200&#8211;250&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1.

Although the intermediate dialumane has not been observed by reduction of a Dipp-substituted analogue (Dipp=2,6-&lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;-Pr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), partial oxidation of the potassium alumanyl species, [{SiN&lt;sup&gt;Dipp&lt;/sup&gt;}AlK]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, where {SiN&lt;sup&gt;Dipp&lt;/sup&gt;}={CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SiMe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;N(Dipp)}&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, provided the extremely encumbered dialumane [{SiN&lt;sup&gt;Dipp&lt;/sup&gt;}Al]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. [{SiN&lt;sup&gt;Dipp&lt;/sup&gt;}AlK]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reacts with toluene by reductive activation of a methyl C(&lt;i&gt;sp&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)-H bond to provide the benzyl hydridoaluminate, [{SiN&lt;sup&gt;Dipp&lt;/sup&gt;}AlH(CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Ph)]K, and as a nucleophile with BPh&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and RN=C=NR (R=&lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;-Pr, Cy) to yield the respective Al-&lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;- and Al-&lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;-bonded potassium aluminaborate and alumina-amidinate products. The dimeric structure of [{SiN&lt;sup&gt;Dipp&lt;/sup&gt;}AlK]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; can be disrupted by partial or complete sequestration of potassium. Equimolar reactions with 18-crown-6 result in the corresponding monomeric potassium alumanyl, [{SiN&lt;sup&gt;Dipp&lt;/sup&gt;}Al&#8722;K(18-cr-6)], which provides a rare example of a direct Al&#8722;K contact. In contrast, complete encapsulation of the potassium cation of [{SiN&lt;sup&gt;Dipp&lt;/sup&gt;}AlK]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, either by an excess of 18-cr-6 or 2,2,2-cryptand, allows the respective isolation of bright orange charge-separated species comprising the &#8216;free&#8217; [{SiN&lt;sup&gt;Dipp&lt;/sup&gt;}Al]&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; alumanyl anion. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations performed on this moiety indicate HOMO-LUMO energy gaps in the of order 200&#8211;250&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Metathesis of P=C Bonds Catalyzed by N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The catalytic transformation of a P=C bond to C=C and P=P bonds is disclosed. Treating phosphaalkenes (ArP=CPh2) with N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (10&#8197;mol% NHC) affords Ph2C=CPh2 and cyclo&#8208;[ArP]n (n=3&#8208;6) which are formally cyclic oligomers of ArP=PAr. Mechanistic studies reveal that this remarkable catalytic transformation proceeds via initial formation of NHC=PAr which is subsequently transformed into cyclo&#8208;(ArP)2CPh2 and cyclo&#8208;(ArP)4CPh2. Phosphaalkene metathesis highlights the close analogy between P=C and C=C bonds.







Abstract
The catalytic metathesis of C=C bonds is a textbook reaction that has no parallel in the widely studied area of multiple bonds involving heavier p&#8208;block elements. A high&#8208;yielding P=C bond metathesis of phosphaalkenes (ArP=CPh2, Ar=Mes, o&#8208;Tol, Ph) has been discovered that is catalyzed by N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes (NHC=Me2IMe, Me2IiPr). The products are cyclic oligomers formally derived from ArP=PAr [i.&#8201;e. cyclo&#8208;(ArP)n; n=3, 4, 5, 6] and Ph2C=CPh2. Preliminary mechanistic studies of this remarkable transformation have established NHC=PAr (Ar=Mes, o&#8208;Tol, Ph) as key phosphinidene transfer agents. In addition, novel cyclic intermediates, such as, cyclo&#8208;(ArP)2CPh2 and cyclo&#8208;(ArP)4CPh2 have also been observed. This work represents a rare application of non&#8208;metal&#8208;based catalysts for transformations involving main&#8208;group elements.

         <title>Halogen Bonding Propensity in Solution: Direct Observation and Computational Prediction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Halogen bonded complexes are often designed by consideration of electrostatic potential (ESP) predictions. ESP predictions do not capture the myriad variables associated with halogen bond (XB) donors and acceptors; thus, binding interaction cannot be quantitatively predicted. Here, a discrepancy between predictions based on ESP energy difference (&#916;Vs) and computed gas phase binding energy (&#916;Ebind) motivated the experimental determination of the relative strength of halogen bonding interactions in solution by Raman spectroscopic observation of complexes formed from interacting five iodobenzene&#8208;derived XB donors and four pyridine XB acceptors. Evaluation of &#916;Ebind  coupled with absolutely&#8208;localized molecular orbital energy decomposition analysis (ALMO&#8208;EDA) deconvolutes halogen bonding energy contributions and reveals a prominent role for charge transfer (CT) interactions. Raman spectra reveal &#916;Ebind  accurately predicts stronger interactions within iodopentafluorobenzene (IPFB) complexes than with 1&#8208;iodo&#8208;3,5&#8208;dinitrobenzene (IDNB) complexes even though IPFB has similar electrostatics to IDNB and contains a smaller &#963;&#8208;hole.</dc:description>

         <title>Mechanochromic Luminescence (MCL) of Purely Organic Two&#8208;Component Dyes: Wide&#8208;Range MCL over 300&#8197;nm and Two&#8208;Step MCL by Charge&#8208;Transfer Complexation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The creation of two&#8208;component dyes has proven to be an effective strategy to achieve remarkable mechanochromic luminescence (MCL) properties. The shift of the maximum emission wavelength (&#916;&#955;em) range of a bis(1&#8208;pyrenylmethyl)diamine derivative has been significantly improved by mixing it with typical organic dyes that do not exhibit MCL behavior. Most notably, a wide&#8208;range MCL (&#916;&#955;em=340&#8197;nm) has been achieved for a mixture with 3,4,9,10&#8208;perylenetetracarboxylic diimide. Furthermore, a two&#8208;step MCL has been realized by mixing with 9,10&#8208;anthraquinone. More information can be found in the Full Paper by S. Ito, T.&#8197;Tachikawa, et&#8197;al.

         <title>Near&#8208;Infrared Spectrum of the First Excited State of Au2+</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Gold nanoclusters have surprising and interesting optical and catalytic properties. Understanding of the electronic structure of the prototypical Au2+ dimer gives us the tools we need to understand more complex systems that are dominated by the strong relativistic effects and spin&#8211;orbit coupling of gold. The first optical spectrum of the low&#8208;lying excited electronic state of cold Au2+ obtained by Ar tagging is exceptionally well resolved, and its surprisingly simple vibronic structure provides detailed information about structure and bonding in the ground and first excited states. More information can be found in the Communication by M.&#8197;F&#246;rstel, O.&#8197;Dopfer et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202102542).

         <title>Towards an Understanding of the Molecular Mechanisms of Variable Unnatural Base&#8208;Pair Behavior: A Biophysical Analysis of dNaM&#8208;dTPT3</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A biophysical analysis of nucleic acid duplexes containing the unnatural hydrophobic base pair (d)NaM&#8208;dTPT3 provides an understanding of the type of molecular level interactions that could contribute to variabilities in replication, transcription and translation in a semisynthetic organism. Such approaches could provide a basis for comprehending the behavior of other unnatural base pairs (spheres top left) with a view towards unrestricted expansion of the genetic alphabet and code (spheres bottom&#8208;right) in a semisynthetic organism. More information can be found in the Full Paper by R.&#8197;Krishnamurthy et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202102348). Picture by Saurav Nagpal with the help of R.K.

         <title>Study of the cycloaddition of CO2 with styrene oxide over 6&#8208;connected spn topology MOFs (Zr, Hf) at room temperature</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We synthesized a series of MOFs with a 6&#8208;connected spn topology (MOF&#8208;808&#8208;(Zr, Hf), PCN&#8208;777&#8208;(Zr, Hf), MOF&#8208;818&#8208;(Zr, Hf)). Through the in&#8208;situ DRIFTS of NH  3  &#160;adsorption&#8208;desorption, we found that the activated catalyst mainly contains Lewis acid sites. The effects of different organic ligands on the Lewis acid of the Zr  6  &#160;cluster were analyzed by XPS and NH  3  &#8208;TPD, and the relative Lewis acidity of the same metal was obtained: PCN&#8208;777&gt;MOF&#8208;808&gt;MOF&#8208;818.&#160;In the Py&#8208;FTIR results, we confirmed that MOF&#8208;818 has a higher acid site density. In the activity test, MOFs with mesoporous structure showed better catalytic activity under normal temperature and pressure. Among them, MOF&#8208;818 can still maintain a high degree of crystallinity after catalysis. Finally, we use density functional theory to propose the mechanism of the cycloaddition reaction of carbon dioxide and styrene oxide. The results show that the metal is coordinated with styrene oxide and halogens attack the &#946; carbon of the epoxide.</dc:description>

         <title>Computational Analysis of Photophysical Properties and Reactivity of a New Phototherapeutic Cyclometalated Au(III)&#8208;Hydride Complex</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Gold(III) complexes have recently emerged as new versatile and efficacious metal containing anticancer agents. In an attempt to reconcile the specific affinity of such complexes for target sulfur containing biomolecules with their capability to strongly bind thiol&#8208;containing compounds widely distributed in non&#8208;tumoral cells, a new series of cyclometalated Au(III)&#8208;hydride complexes has been proposed as photoactivatable anticancer prodrugs. Here, the computational exploration of the photophysical properties and reactivity in dark and under light irradiation of the first member of the series, named  1a  , is reported. Complex  1a  low hydricity in dark together with facile hydride substitution leading to H  2  elimination under excitation by visible light have been examined by means of DFT and TD&#8208;DFT computations. Both singlet and triplet excited states have been characterized, allowing the identification of the active species involved in photoactivation pathways leading to the controlled detachment of the hydride ligand. Also the viable two&#8208;photon activation at the ideal phototherapeutic window has been investigated.</dc:description>

         <title>Elucidating Inner Workings of Naturally Sourced Organic Optoelectronic Materials with Ultrafast Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Recent advances in sustainable optoelectronics including photovoltaics, light&#8208;emitting diodes, transistors, and semiconductors have been enabled by &#960;&#8208;conjugated organic molecules. A fundamental understanding of light&#8208;matter interactions involving these materials can be realized by time&#8208;resolved electronic and vibrational spectroscopies. In this Minireview, the photoinduced mechanisms including charge/energy transfer, electronic (de)localization, and excited&#8208;state proton transfer are correlated with functional properties encompassing optical absorption, fluorescence quantum yield, conductivity, and photostability. Four naturally derived molecules (xylindein, dimethylxylindein, alizarin, indigo) with ultrafast spectral insights showcase efficient energy dissipation involving H&#8208;bonding networks and proton motions, which yield high photostability. Rational design principles derived from such investigations could increase the efficiency for light harvesting, triplet formation, and photosensitivity for improved and versatile optoelectronic performance.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The hexadecafluorophthalocyanine&#8211;iron complex FePcF16 was recently shown to convert olefins into ketones in the presence of stoichiometric amounts of triethylsilane in ethanol at room temperature under an oxygen atmosphere. Herein, we describe an extensive mechanistic investigation for the conversion of 2&#8208;vinylnaphthalene into 2&#8208;acetylnaphthalene as model reaction. A variety of studies including deuterium&#8208; and 18O2&#8208;labeling experiments, ESI&#8208;MS, and 57Fe M&#246;ssbauer spectroscopy have been performed to identify the intermediates involved in the catalytic cycle of the oxidation process. Finally, a detailed and well&#8208;supported reaction mechanism for the FePcF16&#8208;catalyzed Wacker&#8208;type oxidation has been proposed.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis and Hydrogen&#8208;Bond Patterns of Aryl&#8208;Group Substituted Silanediols and &#8208;triols from Alkoxy&#8208; and Chlorosilanes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organosilanols typically show a high condensation tendency and only exist as stable isolable molecules under very specific steric and electronic conditions at the silicon atom. In the present work, various novel representatives of this class of compounds were synthesized by hydrolysis of alkoxy&#8208; or chlorosilanes. Phenyl, 1&#8209;naphthyl, and 9&#8209;phenanthrenyl substituents at the silicon atom were applied to systematically study the influence of the aromatic substituents on the structure and reactivity of the compounds. Chemical shifts in 29Si NMR spectroscopy in solution, correlated well with the expected electronic situation induced by the substitution pattern on the Si atom. 1H&#160;NMR studies allowed the detection of strong intermolecular hydrogen bonds. Single crystal X&#8208;ray structure of the alkoxides and the chlorosilanes are dominated by &#960;&#8208;&#960; interactions of the aromatic systems, which are substituted by strong hydrogen bonding interactions representing various structural motifs in the respective organosilanol structures.</dc:description>

         <title>Diphosphino&#8208;Functionalized 1,8&#8208;Naphthyridines: a Multifaceted Ligand Platform for Boranes and Diboranes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A 1,8&#8208;naphthyridine diphosphine (NDP) reacts with boroncontaining Lewis acids to generate complexes featuring a number of different naphthyridine bonding modes. When exposed to diborane B  2  Br  4  , NDP underwent self&#8208;deprotonation to afford [NDP&#8208;B  2  Br  3  ]Br, an unsymmetrical diborane comprised of four fused rings. The reaction of two equivalents of monoborane BBr  3  and NDP in a non&#8208;polar solvent provided the simple phosphine&#8208;borane adduct NDP(BBr  3  )  2  , which then underwent intramolecular halide abstraction to furnish the salt [NDP&#8208;BBr  2  ][BBr  4  ], featuring a different coordination mode from that of [NDP&#8208;B  2  Br  3  ]Br. Direct deprotonation of NDP by KHMDS or PhCH  2  K generates mono&#8208; and dipotassium reagents, respectively. The monopotassium reagent reacts with one or half an equivalent of B  2  (NMe  2  )  2  Cl  2  to afford NDP&#8208;based diboranes with three or four amino substituents.</dc:description>

         <title>Switching the Mechanism of NADH Photooxidation by Supramolecular Interactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A series of three Ru(II) polypyridine complexes was investigated for the selective photocatalytic oxidation of NAD(P)H to NAD(P)  +  in water. A combination of (time&#8208;resolved) spectroscopic studies and photocatalysis experiments revealed that ligand design can be used to control the mechanism of the photooxidation: For prototypical Ru(II) complexes a  1  O  2  pathway was found.  Rudppz  ([(tbbpy)  2  Ru(dppz)]Cl  2  , tbbpy = 4,4&#180;&#8208;di&#8208;  tert  &#8208;butyl&#8208;2,2&#180;&#8208;bipyridine, dppz = dipyrido[3,2&#8208;a:2&#8242;,3&#8242;&#8208;c]phenazine), instead, initiated the cofactor oxidation by electron transfer from NAD(P)H enabled by supramolecular binding between substrate and catalyst. Expulsion of the photoproduct NAD(P)  +  from the supramolecular binding site in  Rudppz  allowed very efficient turnover. Therefore,  Rudppz  permits repetitive selective assembly and oxidative conversion of reduced naturally occurring nicotinamides by recognizing the redox state of the cofactor under formation of H  2  O  2  as additional product. This photocatalytic process can fuel discontinuous photobiocatalysis.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Bright near&#8208;infrared electrochemiluminescence (NIR&#8211;ECL) of Au  18  nanoclusters is reported herein.

         <title>Simultaneous Tuning Band Gaps of Cu2O and TiO2 to Form S&#8208;Scheme Hetero&#8208;Photocatalyst</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Simultaneous tuning of band gaps of Cu2O and TiO2 to form a S&#8208;Scheme hetero&#8208;photocatalyst was reported. Quantum dot Cu2O was aimed to make conduction band more negative while the introduction of Ti3+ was to make its absorption edge red shift to visible light region. Such a heterostructured photocatalyst has shown greatly improved activity and stability for visible light photodegradation of 4&#8208;chloro phenol.







Abstract
Photocatalytic Z or S scheme merits higher redox potentials and faster charge separation. However, heterostructure photocatalysts with band gaps of bulk materials often have a type&#8197;I band structure leading to poor photocatalytic activity. In view of this, we report simultaneous tuning of band gaps of Cu2O and TiO2, where quantum dot Cu2O nanoparticles were formed on doped TiO2 with Ti3+. The reduced size of Cu2O made its conduction band more negative, whereas the introduction of Ti3+ made the absorption edge red shift to the visible light region. The as&#8208;formed heterostructure enabled an S&#8208;Scheme mechanism with remarkable activity and stability for visible light photodegradation of 4&#8208;chlorophenol (4&#8208;CP). The as&#8208;obtained photocatalysts&#8217; activity demonstrated ca. 510&#8208;fold increase as compared to individual ones and a mechanical blend. The as&#8208;obtained photocatalysts maintained over 80&#8201;% for 5&#8197;cycles and 2&#8197;months exposure to O2 did not decrease the degradation rate. ESR characterization and scavenger experiments proved the S&#8208;Scheme mechanism.

         <title>Structural Modulation on NiCo2S4Nanoarray by N Doping to Enhance 2e&#8208;ORR Selectivity for Photothermal AOPs and Zn&#8722;O2Batteries**
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Zn&#8722;O2 batteries: A 2e oxygen reduction reaction (ORR)&#8208;active electrocatalyst was synthesized by loading N&#8208;doped NiCo2S4 nanoarray on filter paper derived carbon paper with two coordination complexes as precursors. The electrocatalyst also exhibits good photothermal properties. Under the heating of the photothermal effect, H2O2 produced by 2e&#8208;ORR is decomposed and releases .OH radicals, which can degrade antibiotics, pesticides, and phenol through advanced oxidation processes. With this electrocatalyst as cathode material and Zn as anode, a Zn&#8722;O2 battery was constructed.







Abstract
As a H2O2 generator, a 2e&#8722; oxygen reduction reaction active electrocatalyst plays an important role in the advanced oxidation process to degrade organic pollutants in sewage. To enhance the tendency of NiCo2S4 towards the 2e&#8722; reduction reaction, N atoms are doped in its structure and replace S2&#8722;. The result implies that this weakens the interaction between NiCo2S4 and OOH*, suppresses O&#8722;O bond breaking and enhances H2O2 selectivity. This electrocatalyst also shows photothermal effect. Under photothermal heating, H2O2 produced by the oxidation reduction reaction can decompose and releaseOH, which degrades organic pollutants through the advanced oxidation process. Photothermal effect induced by the advance oxidation process shows obvious advantages over the traditional Fenton reaction, such as wide pH adaptation scope and low secondary pollutant due to its Fe2+ free character. With Zn as anode and the electrocatalyst as cathode material, a Zn&#8722;O2 battery is assembled. It achieves electricity generation and photothermal effect induced by the advance oxidation process simultaneously.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Zn&#8722;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; batteries&lt;/b&gt;: A 2e oxygen reduction reaction (ORR)-active electrocatalyst was synthesized by loading N-doped NiCo&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; nanoarray on filter paper derived carbon paper with two coordination complexes as precursors. The electrocatalyst also exhibits good photothermal properties. Under the heating of the photothermal effect, H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; produced by 2e-ORR is decomposed and releases &lt;sup&gt;.&lt;/sup&gt;OH radicals, which can degrade antibiotics, pesticides, and phenol through advanced oxidation processes. With this electrocatalyst as cathode material and Zn as anode, a Zn&#8722;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; battery was constructed.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; generator, a 2e&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; oxygen reduction reaction active electrocatalyst plays an important role in the advanced oxidation process to degrade organic pollutants in sewage. To enhance the tendency of NiCo&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; towards the 2e&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; reduction reaction, N atoms are doped in its structure and replace S&lt;sup&gt;2&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;. The result implies that this weakens the interaction between NiCo&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and OOH*, suppresses O&#8722;O bond breaking and enhances H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; selectivity. This electrocatalyst also shows photothermal effect. Under photothermal heating, H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; produced by the oxidation reduction reaction can decompose and releaseOH, which degrades organic pollutants through the advanced oxidation process. Photothermal effect induced by the advance oxidation process shows obvious advantages over the traditional Fenton reaction, such as wide pH adaptation scope and low secondary pollutant due to its Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; free character. With Zn as anode and the electrocatalyst as cathode material, a Zn&#8722;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; battery is assembled. It achieves electricity generation and photothermal effect induced by the advance oxidation process simultaneously.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Excited State Charge Separation in an Azobenzene&#8208;Bridged Perylenediimide Dimer &#8211; Effect of Photochemical Trans&#8208;Cis Isomerization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Excited state charge transfer and charge separation events in a newly synthesized azobenzene bridged PDI&#8208;dimer are demonstrated. Photoconversion of trans to cis&#8208;isomer accelerated the photoevents to an appreciable level.







Abstract
Photoinduced charge transfer and separation events in a newly synthesized azobenzene&#8208;bridged perylenediimide&#8208;dimer (PDI&#8208;dimer) are demonstrated. Trans&#8208;to&#8208;cis conversion (&#8764;50&#8201;% efficiency) from the initial trans PDI&#8208;dimer by 355&#8197;nm pulsed laser light, and its reversal, cis&#8208;to&#8208;trans, process by 435&#8197;nm laser light irradiation has been possible to accomplish. Efficient fluorescence quenching in the PDI&#8208;dimer, more so for the cis isomer was witnessed, and such quenching increased with increasing solvent polarity. DFT&#8208;calculated geometry and electronic structures helped in visualizing the charge transfer in the PDI&#8208;dimer in both isomeric forms, and also revealed certain degree of participation of the azobenzene entity in the charge transfer events. Femtosecond transient absorption spectral studies confirmed occurrence of both charge transfer followed by charge separation in the studied PDI&#8208;dimer in both trans and cis forms in polar solvents, and the evaluated time constants from Global target analysis revealed accelerated events in the cis PDI&#8208;dimer due to proximity effects. The present study offers key insights on the role of the azobenzene bridge, and the dimer geometry in governing the excited state charge transfer and separation in symmetrically linked PDI dimer.

         <title>Carbon Dioxide Capture Enhanced by Pre&#8208;Adsorption of Water and Methanol in UiO&#8208;66</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
MOF trap: We successfully applied a recently developed methodology for water adsorption modelling that allows to elucidate the influence of water on CO2 adsorption and study the mechanism of this effect. We show that water is adsorbed in octahedral cage and stands for promotor for CO2 adsorption in less favorable space than tetrahedral cages. We explain the mechanism of increased CO2 adsorption in the presence of water and methanol, as polar solvents, in the UiO&#8208;66 pores for a potential post&#8208;combustion carbon dioxide capture application.







Abstract
The rapidly rising level of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere resulting from human activity is one of the greatest environmental problems facing our civilization today. Most technologies are not yet sufficiently developed to move existing infrastructure to cleaner alternatives. Therefore, techniques for capturing carbon dioxide from emission sources may play a key role at the moment. The structure of the UiO&#8208;66 material not only meets the requirement of high stability in contact with water vapor but through the water pre&#8208;adsorbed in the pores, the selectivity of carbon dioxide adsorption is increased. We successfully applied the recently developed methodology for water adsorption modelling. It allowed to elucidate the influence of water on CO2 adsorption and study the mechanism of this effect. We showed that water is adsorbed in octahedral cage and stands for promotor for CO2 adsorption in less favorable space than tetrahedral cages. Water plays a role of a mediator of adsorption, what is a general idea of improving affinity of adsorbate. On the basis of pre&#8208;adsorption of methanol as another polar solvent, we have shown that the adsorption sites play a key role here, and not, as previously thought, only the interaction between the solvent and quadrupole carbon dioxide. Overall, we explained the mechanism of increased CO2 adsorption in the presence of water and methanol, as polar solvents, in the UiO&#8208;66 pores for a potential post&#8208;combustion carbon dioxide capture application.

         <title>Stepwise Stress&#8208;Induced Transformations of Metal&#8211;Organic Polyhedral Cluster&#8208;Based Assemblies: Where Conformational and Supramolecular Features Meet</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The understanding of multiple polymorphic phase transitions in molecular crystals is still in its infancy. With this in mind, single&#8208;crystal high&#8208;pressure X&#8208;ray diffraction studies were targeted at a polyhedral oxo cluster featuring phenyl rings in the outer sphere. Pressure evolution leads to a gradual relaxation of induced structural strains through stepwise conformational twisting of the phenyl rings with the reorganization of cooperative noncovalent interactions; this propagates the conformational isomerization. More information can be found in the Full Paper by A.&#8197;Katrusiak, J.&#8197;Lewi&#324;ski et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202101732).

Mg&#8208;doped SiO2/TiO2 hollow nanoparticles and various plant&#8208;derived carrier liquids are used to make ecoresorbable electrorheological fluids. The particles are arranged perpendicular to the electrodes to form rigid fibril structures. The type of oil affects the wettability, resulting in differences in electrorheological performance and sedimentation behavior. The biocompatible smart fluids provide better commercial potential with diminishing concerns of environmental issues. More information can be found in the Full Paper by S.&#8197;Lee et&#8197;al.

         <title>Isomerization of Functionalized Olefins by Using the Dinuclear Catalyst [PdI(&#956;&#8208;Br)(PtBu3)]2: A Mechanistic Study</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
It takes two: The isomerization activity of [PdI(&#956;&#8208;Br)(PtBu3)]2 has been investigated both experimentally and by DFT calculations. The energy profiles for the catalyst activation, alternative dinuclear and mononuclear catalytic cycles, and catalyst deactivation are in good agreement with the experimental results. Evaluation of the kinetic stereoselectivities revealed that a substantial fraction of the product is formed via cooperative dinuclear pathways.

In a combined experimental and computational study, the isomerization activity of the dinuclear palladium(I) complex [PdI(&#956;&#8208;Br)(PtBu3)]2 towards allyl arenes, esters, amides, ethers, and alcohols has been investigated. The calculated energy profiles for catalyst activation for two alternative dinuclear and mononuclear catalytic cycles, and for catalyst deactivation are in good agreement with the experimental results. Comparison of experimentally observed E/Z ratios at incomplete conversion with calculated kinetic selectivities revealed that a substantial amount of product must form via the dinuclear pathway, in which the isomerization is promoted cooperatively by two palladium centers. The dissociation barrier towards mononuclear Pd species is relatively high, and once the catalyst enters the energetically more favorable mononuclear pathway, only a low barrier has to be overcome towards irreversible deactivation.

         <title>Mirror symmetry breaking and network formation in achiral polycatenars with thioether tail</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mirror symmetry breaking in systems composed of achiral molecules is of importance for the design of functional materials for technological applications as well as for the understanding of the mechanisms of spontaneous emergence of chirality. Herein, we report the design and molecular self&#8208;assembly of two series of rod&#8208;like achiral polycatenar molecules derived from a &#960;&#8208;conjugated 5,5&#8217;&#8208;diphenyl&#8208;2,2&#8217;&#8208;bithiophene core with a fork&#8208;like triple alkoxylated end and a variable single alkylthio chain at the other end. In both series of liquid crystalline materials, differing in the chain length at the trialkoxylated end, helical self&#8208;assembly of the  &#960;  &#8208;conjugated rods in networks occurs, leading to wide temperature range (&gt; 200 K) of bicontinuous cubic network phases, in some cases being stable even around ambient temperatures. The achiral bicontinuous cubic  I  a3  d  phase (gyroid) is replaced upon alkylthio chain elongation by a spontaneous mirror symmetry broken bicontinuous cubic phase (  I  23) and a chiral isotropic liquid phase (Iso  1  [  *  ]  ). Further chain elongation results in removing the  I  23 phase and the re&#8208;appearance of the  Ia3  d  phase with &#160;different pitch lengths. In the second series an additional tetragonal phase separates the two cubic phase types.</dc:description>

         <title>The E2 state of FeMoco: hydride formation vs. Fe reduction and a mechanism for H2 evolution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The iron&#8208;molybdenum cofactor (FeMoco) is responsible for dinitrogen reduction in Mo nitrogenase. Unlike the resting state, E0, reduced states of FeMoco are much less well characterized. The E2 state has been proposed to contain a hydride but direct spectroscopic evidence is still lacking. The E2 state can, however, relax back the E0 state via a H2 side&#8208;reaction, implying a hydride intermediate prior to H2 formation. This E2&#8594;E0 pathway is one of the primary mechanisms for H2 formation under low&#8208;electron flux conditions.
In this study we present an exploration of the energy surface of the E2 state. Utilizing both cluster&#8208;continuum and QM/MM calculations, we explore various classes of models: including terminal hydrides, bridging hydrides with a closed or open sulfide&#8208;bridge, as well as models without. Importantly, we find the hemilability of a protonated belt&#8208;sulfide to strongly influence the stability of hydrides. Surprisingly, non&#8208;hydride models are found to be almost equally favorable as hydride models. While the cluster&#8208;continuum calculations suggest multiple possibilities, QM/MM suggest only two models as contenders for the E2 state. These models feature either i) a bridging hydride between Fe2 and Fe6 and an open sulfide&#8208;bridge (terminal SH on Fe6) (E2&#8208;hyd) or ii) a double belt&#8208;sulfide protonated, reduced cofactor without a hydride (E2&#8208;nonhyd). We suggest both models as contenders for the E2 redox state and further calculate a mechanism for H2 evolution. The changes in electronic structure of FeMoco during the proposed redox&#8208;state cycle, E0&#8594;E1&#8594; E2&#8594; E0, are discussed.</dc:description>

         <title>Structural and Photophysical Characterization of All Five Constitutional Isomers of the Octaethyl&#8208;&#946;,&#946;'&#8208;dioxo&#8208;bacterio&#8208; and &#8208;isobacteriochlorin Series</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>It is well&#8208;known that treatment of &#946;&#8208;octaethylporphyrin with H  2  O  2  /conc. H  2  SO  4  converts it to a &#946;&#8208;oxochlorin as well as all five constitutional isomers of the corresponding &#946;,&#946;&#8217;&#8208;dioxo&#8208;derivatives: two bacteriochlorin&#8208;type isomers (&#946;&#8208;oxo groups at opposite pyrrolic building blocks) and three isobacteriochlorin&#8208;type isomers (&#946;&#8208;oxo&#8208;groups at adjacent pyrrolic building blocks). By virtue of the presence of the strongly electronically coupled &#946;&#8208;oxo auxochromes, none of the chromophores are archetypical chlorins, bacteriochlorins, or isobacteriochlorins. We firstly present here, inter alia, the single crystal X&#8208;ray structures of all free&#8208;base diketone isomers and a comparative description of their UV&#8208;vis absorption spectra in neutral and acidic solutions, and fluorescence emission and singlet oxygen photosensitization properties, Magnetic Circular Dichroism (MCD) spectra, and singlet excited state lifetimes.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;It is well-known that treatment of &#946;-octaethylporphyrin with H  2  O  2  /conc. H  2  SO  4  converts it to a &#946;-oxochlorin as well as all five constitutional isomers of the corresponding &#946;,&#946;&#8217;-dioxo-derivatives: two bacteriochlorin-type isomers (&#946;-oxo groups at opposite pyrrolic building blocks) and three isobacteriochlorin-type isomers (&#946;-oxo-groups at adjacent pyrrolic building blocks). By virtue of the presence of the strongly electronically coupled &#946;-oxo auxochromes, none of the chromophores are archetypical chlorins, bacteriochlorins, or isobacteriochlorins. We firstly present here, inter alia, the single crystal X-ray structures of all free-base diketone isomers and a comparative description of their UV-vis absorption spectra in neutral and acidic solutions, and fluorescence emission and singlet oxygen photosensitization properties, Magnetic Circular Dichroism (MCD) spectra, and singlet excited state lifetimes. DFT computations uncover underlying tautomeric equilibria and electronic interactions controlling their electronic properties, adding to the understanding of porphyrinoids carrying &#946;-oxo functionalities. This comparative study lays the basis for their further study and utilization.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>gem&#8208;Heteroatom&#8208;substituted fluoroalkenes as mimics of amide derivatives or phosphates: a comprehensive review</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>gem  &#8208;Heteroatom&#8208;substituted fluoroalkenes have received little attention despite their great potential in medicinal chemistry or in fine chemistry. Indeed, due to the electronic and steric similarity between fluoroalkene moiety and amide bond as well as the high strength of carbon&#8208;fluorine bond, these  gem  &#8208;heteroatom&#8208;substituted fluoroalkenes could be envisioned as stable mimics of various important organic functions such as phosphates, carbamates, S&#8208;thiocarbamates and ureas. We present herein an overview describing the syntheses over the last decade of heteroatom&#8208;substituted fluoroalkenes in geminal position. This review will be divided into several sections covering each the common following heteroatom: Oxygen&#8208;, Nitrogen&#8208;, Sulfur&#8208;, Phosphorus&#8208;, Boron&#8208; and Silicon&#8208; substituted fluoroalkenes.</dc:description>

         <title>Crystal Structure Dependent Dissolution of Non&#8208;Cubic Au Crystallites in Aqua Regia</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Properties of metal crystallites are governed by their morphologies and inherent crystal structures. In this work, bipyramidal Au microcrystallites hosting non&#8208;cubic lattices, body&#8208;centered orthorhombic and tetragonal (together termed as bc(o,t)), are investigated for their stability in aqua regia. Specifically, microcrystallites comprising 92% of bc(o,t) have been subjected to aqua regia of different concentrations and the changes in morphology and lattice phases have been monitored using scanning electron microscopy and X&#8208;ray diffraction techniques. The dissolution process was found to be crystal structure dependent and begin at the bipyramidal tips enriched with fcc lattice while retaining the bc(o,t) rich body. Interestingly, with increasing the reaction times, the remaining core was found to be highly reluctant to dissolution and instead, transformed to tetragonal lattices which with increasing treatment, exhibited lattice parameters closer to that of fcc. The study reveals the presence of a bc(o,t)&#8208;fcc core&#8208;shell structure with the tips enriched with fcc.</dc:description>

         <title>Achieving Enhanced Photochromic Property of Diarylethene Through Host&#8208;Guest Interaction in Aqueous Solution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Diarylethene (DTE) has been widely used in fluorescence probes, molecular logic gates, optical data&#8208;storage devices owing to the excellent photochromic property, while constructing high&#8208;performance photochromic DTE in aqueous media remains a big challenge. Herein we present several host&#8208;guest systems formed between cucurbit[  n  ]uril (CB[  n  ],  n  = 7, 8, 10) and two water&#8208;soluble DTE derivatives  1  and  2  . It was found that host&#8208;guest interactions not only affect the photophysical properties of photochromic guests, also make great differences on the photoreaction process. Different host&#8208;guest binding behaviors also lead to different effects on the photochromic properties of guests. In the presence of CB[  n  ], both  1  and  2  showed enhanced emission and higher fluorescence quenching ratio at photostationary state. Besides, CB[10]&#8226;  1  exhibited faster response rate in cyclization reaction and better photofatigue resistance than free  1  in aqueous solution, while the supramolecular assembly of (CB[8])  n  &#8226;(  2  )  n  showed slower response rate in both directions of the reversible photoreaction. Besides, the photofatigue resistance of  2  can be greatly improved through binding with CB[7]. Our results suggest that host&#8208;guest interactions could be an efficient way to improve photochromic properties of DTE in aqueous solution.</dc:description>

         <title>Partial Hydrolysis of Cyanide Coordination Polymer Induced by Pillar Ligand with Optimized Electrochemical Kinetics for Rechargeable Alkaline Battery</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Coordination polymers are promising cathode materials for rechargeable alkaline batteries. Therefore, the precise modulation by chemical structure and in&#8208;depth structure transform study of these cathodes are necessary. In this article, two model coordination polymer battery cathodes were designed to demonstrate the dynamic structure&#8208;performance relationship. We studied the electrochemical performance of two kinds of nickel&#8208;based coordination polymers, comprising a planar 2D cyanide bridged networks and a 3D cyanide bridged networks pillared by pyrazine molecules, respectively. The 2D coordination polymer showed serious voltage degradation with poor rate capability while 3D coordination polymer exhibited stable voltage output coupled with high rate at various current densities. The investigation revealed the underlining relationship of plateau voltage degradation and hydrolysis process of electrodes. It was reflected that the pyrazine pillar molecules in 3D coordination polymer could suppress the hydrolysis and lead to the in&#8208;situ formation of partial hydrolyzed structure with excellent electrochemical kinetics, which exhibited obvious smaller peak separation (27 mV compared with 149 mV) and hence almost two&#8208;fold increase in capacity retention (31.9% to 50.0%) and energy density retention (18.2% to 35.9%) at 10 A g  &#8208;1  .</dc:description>

         <title>Carbazole&#8208;Containing Carbadecaphyrins: Non&#8208;aromatic Expanded Porphyrins that Undergo Proton&#8208;Triggered Conformational Changes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A pair of  meso  &#8208;unsubstituted expanded carbaporphyrins containing two carbazole moieties were prepared in high isolated yields (82 and 76%, respectively). The two macrocycles, namely  3  and  4  , differ with respect to their substitution at the carbazole N&#8208;atoms i.e. by H and  i  &#8208;Bu, respectively. As prepared in their free&#8208;base forms, macrocycles  3  and  4  adopt figure&#8208;of&#8208;eight conformations and are best characterized as 40 &#960;&#8208;electron, non&#8208;aromatic species possessing a decaphyrin(1.1.0.0.0.1.1.0.0.0) skeleton. Protonation of  3  with either trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) or perchloric acid (HClO  4  ) produces a parallelogram&#8208;shaped structure. A similar structure is produced when N&#8208;functionalized system  4  is treated with TFA. In contrast, protonation of  4  with HClO  4  leads it to adopt a twisted M&#246;bius strip&#8208;like structure in the solid state, thus allowing access to three distinct conformational states as a function of the conditions.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>

         <title>Quinoid&#8208;aromatic Resonance for Very Small Optical Energy Gaps in Small&#8208;molecule Organic Semiconductors: a Naphthodithiophenedione&#8208;oligothiophene triad system</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic semiconductors with very small optical energy gaps have attracted much attention for near&#8208;infrared&#8208;active optoelectronic applications. Herein, we present a series of donor&#8208;acceptor&#8208;donor (D&#8208;A&#8208;D) organic semiconductors consisting of a highly electron&#8208;deficient naphtho[1,2&#8208;  b  :5,6&#8208;  b  ']dithiophene&#8208;2,7&#8208;dione quinoidal acceptor and oligothiophene donors that show very small optical energy gaps of down to 0.72 eV in the solid state. Investigation of the physicochemical properties of the D&#8208;A&#8208;D molecules as well as theoretical calculations of their electronic structures revealed an efficient intramolecular interaction between the quinoidal acceptor and the aromatic oligothiophene donors in the D&#8208;A&#8208;D molecules, which significantly enhances the backbone resonance and thus reduces the bond length alternation along the &#960;&#8208;conjugated backbones. Despite the very small optical energy gaps, the D&#8208;A&#8208;D molecules have low&#8208;lying frontier orbital energy levels that give rise to air&#8208;stable ambipolar carrier transport properties with hole and electron mobilities of up to 0.026 and 0.043 cm  2  V  &#8722;1  s  &#8722;1  , respectively, in the field&#8208;effect transistors.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A series of six new Fe(II)NHC&#8208;carboxylic sensitizers with their ancillary ligand decorated with functions of varied electronic properties have been designed with the aim to increase the metal&#8208;to&#8208; surface charge separation and light harvesting in iron&#8208;based Dye&#8208;sensitized solar cells (DSCCs).  ARM130  scored the highest efficiency ever reported for an iron&#8208;sensitized solar cell (1.83%) using Mg  2+  and NBu  4  I&#8208;based electrolyte and a thick 20&#956;m TiO  2  anode. Computational modelling, transient absorption spectroscopy and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) revealed that the electronic properties induced by the dimethoxyphenyl substituted NHC ligand of  ARM130  led to the best combination of electron injection yield and spectral sensitivity breadth.</dc:description>

         <title>An Isolable Three&#8208;Coordinate Germanone and Its Reactivity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A rare three&#8208;coordinate germanone [IPrN]  2  Ge=O (IPrN = bis(2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl)imidazolin&#8208;2&#8208;imino) was successfully isolated. The germanone has a rather high thermal stability in arene solvent, and no detectable change was observed at 80&#160;  o  C for at least one week. However, high thermal stability of [IPrN]  2  Ge=O does not prevent its reactivity toward small molecules. Structural analysis and initial reactivity studies revealed the highly polarized nature of the terminal Ge=O bond. Besides, the addition of phenylacetylene, as well as O&#8208;atom transfer with 2,6&#8208;dimethylphenyl isocyanide make it a mimic of nucleophilic transition&#8208;metal oxides. Mechanism for O&#8208;atom transfer reaction was investigated via DFT calculations, which revealed that the reaction proceeds via a [2+2] cycloaddition intermediate.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Enantiodivergent one&#8208;pot synthesis of biaryls was developed using a catalytic amount of a single chiral source. A domino organocatalyst&#8208;mediated enantioselective Michael reaction and aldol condensation provided centrally chiral dihydronaphthalenes with excellent enantioselectivity, from which an enantiodivergent chirality conversion from central&#8208;to&#8208;axial chirality was achieved. Both enantiomers of biaryls were obtained with excellent enantioselectivity. All transformations can be conducted in a single reaction vessel. A plausible reaction mechanism for the enantiodivergence is proposed.</dc:description>

         <title>Diastereoselective Double C&#8208;H Functionalization of Chiral Ferrocenes with Heteroaromatics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Diastereoselective double C&#8208;H heteroarylation of chiral ferrocenes provides valuable compounds with multiple functionalities using mild reaction conditions and simple reagents. Pd&#8208;Complexes with chiral mono&#8208;protected amino acids afforded corresponding heteroarylated ferrocenyl amines in good yields and high diastereomeric purities. In this way, a variety of indole, thiophene, pyrrole, or furan substituents were introduced to the ferrocene moiety. Furthermore, a range of relevant functional groups, e.g. ketone, ester, chloro, nitro, silyl, are tolerated by this method. An alternative combination of amino acid and ferrocenyl amine configurations was leveraged to provide the complementary diastereomeric products. The products of C&#8208;H heteroarylation can be transformed into corresponding phosphines. Absolute configurations of CH&#8208;activation products were confirmed by the combination of X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis and CD spectroscopy.  19  F NMR kinetic study and DFT calculations provided insights into the reaction mechanism and reasons governing stereoinduction.</dc:description>

         <title>Stepwise increase NdIII&#8208;based phosphorescence by AIE&#8208;active sensitizer: Broaden AIPE family from transition metals to discrete NIR lanthanide complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We designed two near&#8208;infrared lanthanide complexes [(  L  )  2  &#8208;Nd(NO  3  )  3  ] (  L  = TPE  2  &#8208;BPY for  1  , TPE&#8208;BPY for  2  ) by employing aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE)&#8208;active tetraphenylethylene (TPE) derivatives as sensitizers, which possessed matched energy to Nd  III  , effectively preventing competitive deactivation under aggregation, even shifting the excitation window toward 600 nm by twisted intramolecular charge transfer. Furthermore, benefiting from the 4  f  electron shielding effect and antenna effect, the enhanced excitation energies of the AIE&#8208;active sensitizers by structural rigidification transferred into the inert Nd  III  excited state through  3  LMCT, affording the first aggregation&#8208;induced phosphorescence enhancement (AIPE)&#8208;active discrete NIR&#8208;emitting lanthanide complexes. As  1  equipped with more AIE&#8208;active TPE than  2  ,  L  &#8594;Nd energy transfer efficiency of the former was larger than that of the latter under the same conditions. Moreover, the crystal of  1  exhibited one of the longest lifetimes (9.69  &#956;  s) among Nd  III  &#8208;based complexes containing C&#8722;H bonds.</dc:description>

As  1  equipped with more AIE-active TPE than  2  ,  L  &#8594;Nd energy transfer efficiency of the former was larger than that of the latter under the same conditions. Moreover, the crystal of  1  exhibited one of the longest lifetimes (9.69  &#956;  s) among Nd  III  -based complexes containing C&#8722;H bonds.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>
