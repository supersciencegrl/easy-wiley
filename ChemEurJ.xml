         <title>Regulation of fluorescence and self&#8208;assembly of a salicylaldehyde azine&#8208;containing amphiphile by pillararene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Regulation of fluorescence and self&#8208;assembly of a salicylaldehyde azine&#8208;containing amphiphile by a water&#8208;soluble pillar[5]arene via host&#8211;guest recognition in water was realized. The fluorescence and the self&#8208;assembled aggregates of the bola&#8208;type amphiphile G can be tailored by adding different amounts of water&#8208;soluble pillar[5]arene (WP5). In addition, the emission property and self&#8208;assembly behavior of G and WP5 are responsive to pH conditions. Furthermore, the fluorescence emission property of G and the regulation by WP5 or pH conditions was applied as information encryption material, rewritable paper, and erasable ink. We believe that this fluorescence regulation strategy is promising for the construction of advanced fluorescent organic materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Construction of Bidentate Phosphines Enabled by Photoinduced Reductive Diphosphination of Alkenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The diphosphination of alkenes through a radical pathway offers a promising approach for the rapid construction of aryl bisphosphines. However, such a synthetic strategy has not been successfully applied to the preparation of alkyl bisphosphines, partially due to the difficulties in the generation of phosphorus&#8208;centered radicals from common alkyl phosphine compounds. We herein demonstrate that this challenge can be overcome by hiring Janus&#8208;faced chlorophosphine as the phosphine source that can act as not only a radical precursor to generate phosphine&#8208;centered radicals but also a radicalphile to capture alkyl radicals. With this novel strategy, a photocatalyzed reductive diphosphination reaction has been established, allowing for a straightforward synthesis of both aryl and alkyl 1,2&#8208;bisphosphines from readily accessible alkenes and chlorophosphines.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrochemical Multicomponent Synthesis of&#160;Alkyl Alkenesulfonates using Styrenes, SO2 and Alcohols</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A novel electrochemical approach to access alkyl alkenesulfonates via a multicomponent reaction was developed. The metal&#8208;free method features easy&#8208;to&#8208;use SO2 stock solution forming monoalkylsulfites from alcohols with an auxiliary base in&#8208;situ. These intermediates serve a dual role as starting materials and as supporting electrolyte enabling conductivity. Anodic oxidation of the substrate styrene, radical addition of these monoalkylsulfites and consecutive second oxidation and deprotonation preserve the double bond and form alkyl &#946;&#8208;styrenesulfonates in a highly regio&#8208; and stereoselective fashion. The feasibility of this electrosynthetic method is demonstrated in 44 examples with yields up to 81%, employing various styrenes and related substrates as well as a diverse set of alcohols. A gram&#8208;scale experiment underlines the applicability of this process, which uses inexpensive and readily available electrode materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Electropolymerization of Preferred&#8208;Oriented Conjugated Microporous Polymer Films for Enhanced Fluorescent Sensing</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>High&#8208;quality conjugated microporous polymer (CMP) films with orientation and controlled structure are extremely desired for applications. Here, we report the effective construction of CMP 3D composite films (pZn/PTPCz) with a controlled porosity structure and preferred orientation using the template&#8208;assisted electropolymerization (EP) approach for the first time. The structure of pZn/PTPCz composite thin films and nitrophenol sensing performance were thoroughly studied. When compared to the control CMP film made on flat indium tin oxide (ITO) substrates, the as&#8208;prepared pZn/PTPCz composite films showed significantly enhanced fluorescent intensity and much better sensing performance for the model explosive. This was attributed to the metal&#8208;enhanced fluorescence (MEF) of porous nanostructured zinc (pZn) and the additional macroporosity of the pZn/PTPCz composite films. This work provides a feasible approach for creating oriented 3D CMP&#8208;based thin films for advanced applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Selective Manipulation of Well&#8208;Defined Trinuclear Pd(II)&#8208;Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Several strategies abound to design well&#8208;defined multimetallic molecular entities bearing functional ligands. Substoichiometric exchange reactions in the coordination sphere of pre&#8208;existing multinuclear precursors is relatively underexploited in this context. Palladium(II) acetate is not a mononuclear compound in the solid state but rather exists as a trimer, i.e. [Pd3(OAc)6]. Although this material is ubiquitously used to synthesize mononuclear Pd species, it may principally also lend itself to selective exchange of some of the edge&#8208;sharing acetate units in its triangular motif, whilst keeping the overall multinuclear architecture intact. Strikingly, little is known about the controlled manipulation and substoichiometric substitution chemistry of this well&#8208;defined conglomerate. We herein conclusively demonstrate that, for the first time, the targeted exchange of two or four acetate units from the Pd3(acetate)6 platform is possible, thereby installing either one or two new tridentate ligands onto this trinuclear architecture. &#160;Follow&#8208;up exchange and substitution chemistry is available without disrupting the multimetallic nature of the core structure. New complexes 2&#8208;7 are all conclusively characterized using multinuclear NMR spectroscopy, UV&#8208;vis and IR spectroscopy as well as X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Solid&#8208;State Synthesis of B&#8592;N Adducts by the Amine&#8208;Facilitated Trimerization of the Phenylboronic Acid</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Stable boroxine&#8208;amine adducts comprising dative B&#8592;N bond(s) were prepared by mechanochemically&#8208;induced reactions of phenylboronic acid (PBA) and amines (pyridine, DMAP, 1H&#8208;pyrazole, piperidine, DABCO, hexamethylenetetramine, or 4,4&#8217;&#8208;bipyridine). In&#8208;situ Raman monitoring, ex&#8208;situ PXRD and DFT calculations were used for product identification. Stoichiometry of the product (3:1, 3:2 or 6:1 adduct) was controlled by the amine structure and the molar ratio of the reactants. The 1:2 H&#8208;bonded assembly of PBA and 4,4&#8217;&#8208;bipyridine (bpy) was confirmed as an intermediate in the adduct formation for bpy. Competitive binding experiments indicated that the exchange of the amines in the 3:1 adducts follows the computed adduct stabilities that increase with the amine basicity. Following the DFT prediction, the first adduct with two different amines, DMAP and pip, bound to one boroxine moiety was isolated and structurally characterized. Results show that calculations can be used to predict possible and preferred product(s) and their spectral characteristics.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Geometry of the molecules plays important role in various chemical and physical properties. Photoswitches are molecules that undergo structural changes from a stable isomer (trans) to a geometrically different less stable structure (cis) by light irradiation through isomerization. Here an unconventional phenomenon is reported where a cis isomer undergo oligomerization in the absence of light, however, behave as typical photoswitches in the presence of light irradiation.







Abstract
Photoswitches are molecules that can absorb light of specific wavelengths and undergo a reversible transformation between their trans and cis isomeric forms. In phenylazo photoswitches, it is common for the less stable cis (Z) isomer to convert back to the more stable trans (E) isomer either through photochemical or thermal means. In this research, we designed new derivatives of phenylazothiazole (PAT) photoswitches, PAT&#8208;Fn, which feature fluorine substituents on their phenyl component. These derivatives can reversibly isomerize under visible light exposure with the enrichment of E and Z isomers at photostationary state (PSS). Surprisingly, we observed an unconventional phenomenon when these PAT&#8208;Fn (n&#8807;2) photoswitches were in their cis isomeric state in the absence of light. Instead of the anticipated transformation from cis to trans isomer, these compounds converted to an oligomeric compound. Our detailed experimental investigation and theoretical calculations, indicated the crucial role of fluorine substituents and the distinctive geometric arrangement of the cis isomer in driving the unexpected oligomerization process originating from the cis isomeric state.

         <title>Osme Bond: Geometric and Energetic Features in the Adducts between OsO4 and Lewis Bases</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Adducts formed by OsO4 and Lewis bases, have already been rationalised as &#963;&#8208;hole based adducts. The interaction involving Osmium as electrophilic site is named Osme Bond (Omb). Here, new adducts with OmB interaction were characterized. Computations confirm a strong correlation between &#963;&#8208;hole interaction energy and geometric deformation of OsO4.







Abstract
Adducts between OsO4 and Lewis bases exert a role in important oxidation processes such as epoxidation and dihydroxylation. It has been shown that the attractive interaction driving the formation of these adducts is a &#963;&#8208;hole bond involving the metal as the electrophilic species; the term Osme Bond (OmB) was proposed for designating it. Here some new adducts between OsO4 and various bases have been characterized through single crystal x&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD) and computational studies (density functional theory, DFT), confirming the existence of a robust correlation between &#963;&#8208;hole interaction energy and deformation of the tetrahedral geometry of OsO4. Also, some adducts formed by RuO4 with nucleophiles were investigated computationally.

         <title>Switchable Redox and Thermo&#8208;Responsive Supramolecular Polymers Based on Cyclodextrin&#8208;Polyoxometalate Tandem</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The chaotropic behavior of polyoxometalates is exploited as an operating principle to promote a reversible and thermo&#8208;responsive sol&#8208;gel transition of cyclodextrin&#8208;based polymer where supramolecular networking results from the host&#8208;guest interactions between cyclodextrin&#8208;based oligomers and Keggin&#8208;type POMs acting as electro&#8208;active crosslinking agents. This study reveals that the chaotropic effect corresponds to an effective force able to induce responsiveness into supramolecular materials.







Abstract
Supramolecular polymers built from stimuli&#8208;responsive host&#8208;guest interactions represent an attractive way of tailoring smart materials. Herein, we exploit the chaotropic effect of polyoxometalates and related host&#8208;guest properties to design unconventional polymer systems with reversible redox and thermo&#8208;responsive sol&#8208;gel transition. These supramolecular networks result from the association of cyclodextrin&#8208;based oligomers and Keggin&#8208;type POMs acting as electro&#8208;active crosslinking agents. The structure and the dynamics of such self&#8208;assembly systems have been investigated using a multiscale approach involving MALDI&#8208;TOF, viscosity measurements, cyclic voltammetry, 1H&#8208;NMR (1D and DOSY), and Small&#8208;Angle X&#8208;ray Scattering. Our results reveal that the chaotropic effect corresponds to a powerful and efficient force that can be used to induce responsiveness in hybrid supramolecular oligomeric systems.

         <title>Mimicking the Shape and Function of the ClC Chloride Channel Selective Pore by Combining a Molecular Hourglass Shape with Anion&#8211;&#960; Interactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The concept of combining molecular hourglass with anion&#8211;&#960; interactions for mimicking the shape and function of the ClC chloride channel selective pore is presented. High and regulatable chloride transport conductance and selectivity that replicate the properties demonstrated by ClC is achieved through modifying the constituent components of the molecular hourglass.







Abstract
ClC is the main family of natural chloride channel proteins that transport Cl&#8722; across the cell membrane with high selectivity. The chloride transport and selectivity are determined by the hourglass&#8208;shaped pore and the filter located in the central and narrow region of the pore. Artificial unimolecular channel that mimics both the shape and function of the ClC selective pore is attractive, because it could provide simple molecular model to probe the intriguing mechanism and structure&#8208;function relevance of ClC. Here we elaborated upon the concept of molecular hourglass plus anion&#8211;&#960; interactions for this purpose. The concept was validated by experimental results of molecular hourglasses using shape&#8208;persistent 1,3&#8208;alternate tetraoxacalix[2]arene[2]triazine as the central macrocyclic skeleton to control the conductance and selectivity, and anion&#8211;&#960; interactions as the driving force to facilitate the chloride dehydration and movement along the channel.

         <title>Selectively transport and removal of fluoride ion by pillar[5]arene polymer&#8208;filled nanochannel membrane</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fluoride contamination of groundwater has become one of the most serious problems in the world. Currently, excessive absorption of fluoride can be toxic to humans and crops. To address the challenge, we explored the excellent properties of functionalized pillar[5]arene polymer framework. By constructing a multistage porous nanochannel membrane, the pillar[5]arene polymer&#8208;filled nanochannel membrane achieves a fluoride removal.







Abstract
Excess fluoride ions in groundwater accumulate through the roots of crops, affecting photosynthesis and inhibiting their growth. Long&#8208;term bioaccumulation also threatens human health because it is poorly degradable and toxic. Currently, one of the biggest challenges is developing a unique material that can efficiently remove fluoride ions from the environment. The excellent properties of functionalized pillar[5]arene polymer&#8208;filled nanochannel membranes were explored to address this challenge. Constructing a multistage porous nanochannel membrane, consisting of microscale etched nanochannels and nanoscale pillar[5]arene cross&#8208;linked polymer voids. A fluoride removal rate of 0.0088&#8197;mmol&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;L&#8722;1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;min&#8722;1 was achieved. Notably, this rate surpassed the rates observed with other control ions by a factor of 6 to 8.8. Our research provides a new direction for developing water fluoride ion removal materials.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, we present the synthesis and detailed photophysical characterization of qU &#8211; a novel fluorescent base analogue of uridine. qU exhibits interesting properties such as excitation in the visible region with high brightness, dual emission, pH sensitivity, and an ESPT reaction. This work has extended the toolbox of internal RNA labels for future applications such as fluorescence lifetime imaging.







Abstract
Fluorescent base analogues (FBAs) have become useful tools for applications in biophysical chemistry, chemical biology, live&#8208;cell imaging, and RNA therapeutics. Herein, two synthetic routes towards a novel FBA of uracil named qU (quadracyclic uracil/uridine) are described. The qU nucleobase bears a tetracyclic fused ring system and is designed to allow for specific Watson&#8208;Crick base pairing with adenine. We find that qU absorbs light in the visible region of the spectrum and emits brightly with a quantum yield of 27&#8201;% and a dual&#8208;band character in a wide pH range. With evidence, among other things, from fluorescence lifetime measurements we suggest that this dual emission feature results from an excited&#8208;state proton transfer (ESPT) process. Furthermore, we find that both absorption and emission of qU are highly sensitive to pH. The high brightness in combination with excitation in the visible and pH responsiveness makes qU an interesting native&#8208;like nucleic acid label in spectroscopy and microscopy applications in, for example, the field of mRNA and antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) therapeutics.

         <title>Electroplated electrodes for continuous and mass&#8208;efficient electrochemical hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrocatalytic hydrogenation reactions (ECH) receive growing attention due to their sustainable potential. Our innovative one&#8208;step protocol creates carbon&#8208;supported silver electrodes, finely tunable for morphology and catalytic activity. Achieving 93&#8201;% current efficiency in ECH for the vitamin synthon 2&#8208;methyl&#8208;3&#8208;butyn&#8208;2&#8208;ol, even at higher current densities and reduced metal loadings, we successfully converted a library of 17&#8197;diverse substrates. More information can be found in the Research Article by U.&#8208;P. Apfel, D. Siegmund and co&#8208;workers (DOI: https://doi.org/10.1002/chem.202303808).







Abstract
Electrocatalytic hydrogenations (ECH) enable the reduction of organic substrates upon usage of electric current and present a sustainable alternative to conventional processes if green electricity is used. Opposed to most current protocols for electrode preparation, this work presents a one&#8208;step binder&#8208; and additive&#8208;free production of silver&#8208; and copper&#8208;electroplated electrodes. Controlled adjustment of the preparation parameters allows for the tuning of catalyst morphology and its electrochemical properties. Upon optimization of the deposition protocol and carbon support, high faradaic efficiencies of 93&#8201;% for the ECH of the Vitamin&#8197;A&#8208; and E&#8208;synthon 2&#8208;methyl&#8208;3&#8208;butyn&#8208;2&#8208;ol (MBY) are achieved that can be maintained at current densities of 240&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and minimal catalyst loadings of 0.2&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2, corresponding to an unmatched production rate of 1.47&#8197;kgMBE&#8201;gcat&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1. For a continuous hydrogenation process, the protocol can be directly transferred into a single&#8208;pass operation mode giving a production rate of 1.38&#8197;kgMBE&#8201;gcat&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1. Subsequently, the substrate spectrum was extended to a total of 17&#8197;different C&#8722;C&#8722;, C&#8722;O&#8722; and N&#8722;O&#8722;unsaturated compounds revealing the general applicability of the reported process. Our results lay an important groundwork for the development of electrochemical reactors and electrodes able to directly compete with the palladium&#8208;based thermocatalytic state of the art.

         <title>Photochemical Action Plots Reveal Red&#8208;shifted Wavelength&#8208;dependent Photoproduct Distributions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photochemical action plots are used to deconvolute the wavelength&#8208;selective photoreactivity of a single chromophore. Remarkably, by irradiating with different monochromatic wavelengths of light, either the trans&#8208; to cis&#8208;isomerization or the [2+2]&#8208;photocyclisation can be selectively triggered.







Abstract
Photochemical action plots are a powerful tool for mapping photochemical reaction outcomes wavelength&#8208;by&#8208;wavelength. Typically, they map either the depletion of a reactant or the formation of a specific product as a function of wavelength. Herein, we exploit action plots to simultaneously map the formation of several photochemical products from a single chromophore. We demonstrate that the wavelength&#8208;resolved mapping of two reaction products formed during the irradiation of a chalcone species not only shows wavelength dependence &#8211; exhibiting the typical strong red&#8208;shift of the photochemical reactivity compared to the absorbance spectrum of the chromophore &#8211; but also a strong wavelength selectivity with remarkably different product distributions resulting from different irradiation wavelengths.

         <dc:description>
Pillar[5]arene acts like an intelligent robot to efficiently regulate drug loading and release. Nanogold is widely used and shows advantages in oncology treatment; however, it cannot encapsulate drugs directly and effectively like other nanovesicles or nanocages. The modified pillar[5]arenecan endowed nanogold with excellent drug&#8208;loading ability through a simple host&#8211;guest interaction, and successfully achieved the combination of DOX and GOX for cancer therapy.

         <title>Kinetic Resolution of Secondary Alcohols Catalyzed at the Exterior of Chiral Coordinated Capsules</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The kinetic resolution of racemic secondary alcohols has been realized in an acylation reaction catalyzed by a supramolecular catalyst consisting of an enantiomerically enriched Cu&#8208;coordinated capsule and an achiral guest possessing a catalytic center. The enantioselective acylation proceeds at the exterior of a supramolecular catalyst. The cover picture represents the catalytic center of the supramolecular catalyst that accelerates the acylation of either enantiomer, resulting in the successful kinetic resolution of racemic secondary alcohols. More information can be found in the Research Article by T. Haino and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202304244).

         <title>Oxidation of Alcohols in Continuous Flow with a Solid Phase Hypervalent Iodine Catalyst</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>One of the most useful transformations in the synthetic chemist arsenal is the oxidation of alcohols to their corresponding carbonyl congeners. Despite its seemingly straightforward nature, this transformative reaction predominantly relies on the use of metals or hazardous reagents, making these processes highly unsustainable. To address this challenge, we have developed a sustainable metal&#8208;free method for the oxidation of alcohols in continuous flow. Using a solid phase hypervalent iodine catalyst and nBu4HSO5 as a phase transfer catalyst and co&#8208;oxidant, primary and secondary alcohols were selectively oxidized to the corresponding carbonyl motifs. This operationally simple continuous&#8208;flow set&#8208;up is highly robust (15 cycles run without significant catalyst leaching or loss of reaction efficiency), uses green solvents, such as acetonitrile or acetic acid, and is readily scalable.</dc:description>

Using a solid phase hypervalent iodine catalyst and nBu4HSO5 as a phase transfer catalyst and co-oxidant, primary and secondary alcohols were selectively oxidized to the corresponding carbonyl motifs. This operationally simple continuous-flow set-up is highly robust (15 cycles run without significant catalyst leaching or loss of reaction efficiency), uses green solvents, such as acetonitrile or acetic acid, and is readily scalable.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Temperature&#8208;Tolerant Magnesium&#8208;Ion Battery Using Ball Cactus&#8208;like MgV2O4 as High&#8208;Performance Cathode</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We develop a ball cactus&#8208;like MgV2O4 as cathode for rechargable magnesium&#8208;ion batteries, which displays a good electrochemical performance. After cycling 300 times, the capacity and Coulombic efficiency keep stable, which are ascribed to ball cactus&#8208;like morphology buffers the volumetric change during Mg2+ insertion/extraction, and provides sufficient pathways for ion diffusion.







Abstract
Safe and high&#8208;performance secondary batteries using for all&#8208;climate conditions with different temperatures are highly required. Here, we develop a three&#8208;dimensional ball cactus&#8208;like MgV2O4 as cathode material for magnesium&#8208;ion (Mg&#8208;ion) batteries. After cycling 300 times, the capacity maintains 111.7&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1, while Coulombic efficiency stabilizes at about 100&#8201;%. Under temperatures of 45&#8201;&#176;C and &#8722;5&#8201;&#176;C, the capacities remain stable after 200 cycles. After three rounds of rate&#8208;performance tests, the capacity keeps quite stable. It is ascribed to the ball cactus&#8208;like morphology buffers the volumetric change during Mg2+ insertion/extraction, and provides sufficient pathways for ion diffusion, which has been verified by constant&#8208;current intermittent titration technology. It is believed that the good performance enables the Mg&#8208;ion batteries to have a all&#8208;climate capability.

         <title>Straightforward Access to Free &#946;2,3,3&#8208;Amino Acids through One Pot C&#8208;H Activation/C&#8722;C Cleavage</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, one&#8208;pot C&#8722;H activation/C&#8722;C cleavage for the synthesis of novel spirocyclic &#946;2,3,3&#8208;amino acids, is reported. This approach shows wide substrate scope of CF3&#8208;ynones and ketimines. In addition, several natural products and biologically relevant molecules, prepared by this method, can be further functionalized. Novel dipeptide and tripeptide structures can be successfully assembled with this spirocyclic amino acid.







Abstract
The first synthesis of unnatural &#946;2,3,3&#8208;amino acids with a spirocyclic backbone by one&#8208;pot protocol has been presented. This reaction features wide functional group tolerance and feasibility of post&#8208;functionalization of natural products and biologically important molecules. Novel dipeptide and tripeptide structures were assembled using this newly developed &#946;2,3,3&#8208;amino acid in high efficiency. The combination of C&#8722;H activation and C&#8722;C cleavage for the synthesis of &#946;&#8208;amino acids would trigger more promising synthetic routes for this compound.

         <title>Improved Interface Construction on Anode and Cathode for Na&#8208;Ion Batteries Using Ultralow&#8208;Concentration Electrolyte Containing Dual&#8208;Additives</title>

Electrode/electrolyte interface built by the dual additives of NaDFOB and TMSB enables significant improvement on the cycling stability of hard carbon/NaNi1/3Fe1/3Mn1/3O2 cell.







Abstract
Compared with Li+, Na+ with a smaller stokes radius has faster de&#8208;solvation kinetics. An electrolyte with ultralow sodium salt (0.3&#8197;M NaPF6) is used to reduce the cell cost. However, the organic&#8208;dominated interface, mainly derived from decomposed solvents (SSIP solvation structure), is defective for the long cycling performance of sodium ion batteries. In this work, the simple application of dual additives, including sodium difluoro(oxalato)borate (NaDFOB) and tris(trimethylsilyl)borate (TMSB), is demonstrated to improve the cycling performance of the hard carbon/NaNi1/3Fe1/3Mn1/3O2 cell by constructing interface films on the anode and cathode. A significant improvement on cycling stability has been achieved by incorporating dual additives of NaDFOB and TMSB. Particularly, the capacity retention increased from 17&#8201;% (baseline) to 79&#8201;% (w/w, 2.0&#8197;wt&#8201;% NaDFOB) and 83&#8201;% (w/w, 2.0&#8197;wt&#8201;% NaDFOB and 1.0&#8197;wt&#8201;% TMSB) after 200 cycles at room temperature. Insight into the mechanism of improved interfacial properties between electrodes and electrolyte in ultralow concentration electrolyte has been investigated through a combination of theoretical computation and experimental techniques.

         <title>Highly Efficient Blue Fluorescent Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Devices Based on &#955;5Phosphinine Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Although &#955;5&#8208;phosphinine derivatives are known as a promising class of blue fluorescent emitters, those photoluminescent quantum yield (PLQY) values have been reached up to 92%, however, only a few examples have been explored as an emitter for blue organic light&#8208;emitting device (OLED), and the external quantum efficiency (EQE) has been below 2.4% so far. In this study, we newly developed two types of blue &#955;&#8203;5&#8208;phosphinine derivatives namely CN&#8208;COCF3 and CO2Me&#8208;CHO, and investigated the photophysical properties in the solid states. The photophysical analyses in solid state films suggested that the strong electron&#8208;accepting nature of these &#955;&#8203;5&#8208;phosphinine derivatives caused the inferior PLQY values, and the exciplex formation with the host and neighboring materials should be avoided to improve the device efficiency. By choosing suitable host and neighboring materials with deep ionization potentials, we successfully realized efficient blue fluorescent OLEDs with EQE of over 4% and CIE (0.14, 0.18). This is among the best in &#955;&#8203;5&#8208;phosphinine&#8208;based blue OLEDs so far.</dc:description>

         <title>One&#8208;pot Twostep Chemobiocatalytic Synthesis of a Furan Amino Acid from 5&#8208;Hydroxymethylfurfural</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Recently, catalytic valorization of biomass&#8208;derived furans has received growing interest. 5&#8208;Aminomethyl&#8208;2&#8208;furancarboxylic acid (AMFC), a furan amino acid, holds great promise in the aeras of polymer and pharmaceutical, but its synthesis remains limited. In this work, we report a chemobiocatalytic route toward AMFC by combining laccase&#8208;TEMPO system and recombinant Escherichia coli (named E. coli_TAF) harboring &#969;&#8208;transaminase (TA), L&#8208;alanine dehydrogenase (L&#8208;AlaDH) and formate dehydrogenase (FDH), starting from 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF). In the cascade, HMF is oxidized into 5&#8208;formyl&#8208;2&#8208;furancarboxylic acid (FFCA) by laccase&#8208;TEMPO system, and then the resulting intermediate was converted into AMFC by E. coli_TAF via transamination with cheap ammonium formate instead of costly organic amine donors, theoretically generating H2O and CO2 as by&#8208;products. The tandem process was run in a one&#8208;pot twostep manner, affording AMFC with approximately 81% yield, together with 10% 2,5&#8208;furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA) as by&#8208;product. In addition, the scale&#8208;up production of AMFC was demonstrated, with 0.41 g/L h productivity and 8.6 g/L titer. This work may pave the way for green manufacturing of the furan&#8208;containing amino acid.</dc:description>

         <title>Ultrafast Halogen Dance Reactions of Bromoarenes Enabled by Catalytic Potassium Hexamethyldisilazide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lochmann&#8211;Schlosser base, a stoichiometric combination of nBuLi and KOtBu, is commonly used as a superbase for deprotonating a wide range of organic compounds. In the present study, we report that catalytic potassium hexamethyldisilazide (KHMDS) exhibits higher catalytic activity than KOtBu for successive bromine&#8211;metal exchanges. Accordingly, 1&#8211;10 mol% of KHMDS dramatically enhances halogen dance reactions to introduce various electrophiles to bromopyridine, bromoimidazole, bromothiophene, bromofuran, and bromobenzene derivatives with the bromo group translocated from the original position. A dual catalytic cycle is proposed to explain the ultrafast bromine transfer.</dc:description>

         <title>Trifluoromethyl Fluorosulfonate (CF3OSO2F) and Trifluoromethoxy Sulfur Pentafluoride (CF3OSF5) &#8211; Two Gaseous Sulfur(VI) Compounds with Insulating Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this work, we analyzed trifluoromethyl fluorosulfonate (CF3OSO2F) and trifluoromethoxy sulfur pentafluoride (CF3OSF5) regarding their potential use as dielectrics by investigating some of their intrinsic and extrinsic properties. Both compounds show a higher breakdown voltage than SF6 with averaged relative breakdown voltages of 1.3 &#177;0.2 for CF3OSO2F and 1.4 &#177;0.2 for CF3OSF5 compared to SF6 with 1.0. Like the dielectric (CF3)2CFCN, both compounds decompose during the breakdown process. The decomposition products were analyzed by IR spectroscopy and GCIR methods. Furthermore, the molecular structures of both gaseous compounds CF3OSO2F and CF3OSF5 have been determined by in situ crystallization, and their physical properties were determined as well.</dc:description>

         <title>Juggling Optoelectronics and Catalysis: The Dual Talents of Bench Stable 1,4&#8208;Azaborinines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 8, February 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bench stable 1,4&#8208;azaborinine PAHs with an anthracene or ladder&#8208;type pentacene scaffold have been prepared, characterised and proven to be efficient catalysts for hydroboration of carbonyls and imines.







Abstract
Boron&#8208; and nitrogen&#8208;doped polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (B&#8208;PAHs) have established a strong foothold in the realm of organic electronics. However, their catalytic potential remains largely untapped. In this study, we synthesise and characterise two bench stable B,N&#8208;doped PAH derivatives based on a 1,4&#8208;azaborinine motif. Most importantly, the anthracene derived structure is an efficient catalyst in the reduction of various carbonyls and imines. These results underscore the potential of B,N&#8208;PAHs in catalytic transformations, setting the stage for deeper exploration in this chemical space.

         <title>Breaking Radial Dipole Symmetry in Planar Macrocycles Modulates Edge&#8208;to&#8208;Edge Packing and Disrupts Cofacial Stacking</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 8, February 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Changing the direction of one of three triazole dipoles by just 40&#176; modulated all modes of self&#8208;assembly. While changes in the relative stability of 2D polymorphs on graphite surfaces was expected, disruption of face&#8208;to&#8208;face stacking in 1D was not. These findings revealed the role of long&#8208;range dipole repulsions between stacked macrocycles.







Abstract
Dipolar interactions are ever&#8208;present in supramolecular architectures, though their impact is typically revealed by making dipoles stronger. While it is also possible to assess the role of dipoles by altering their orientations by using synthetic design, doing so without altering the molecular shape is not straightforward. We have now done this by flipping one triazole unit in a rigid macrocycle, tricarb. The macrocycle is composed of three carbazoles (2 Debye) and three triazoles (5 Debye) defining an array of dipoles aligned radially but organized alternately in and out. These dipoles are believed to dictate edge&#8208;to&#8208;edge tiling and face&#8208;to&#8208;face stacking. We modified our synthesis to prepare isosteric macrocycles with the orientation of one triazole dipole rotated 40&#176;. The new dipole orientation guides edge&#8208;to&#8208;edge contacts to reorder the stability of two surface&#8208;bound 2D polymorphs. The impact on dipole&#8208;enhanced &#960; stacking, however, was unexpected. Our stacking model identified an unchanged set of short&#8208;range (3.4&#8197;&#197;) anti&#8208;parallel dipole contacts. Despite this situation, the reduction in self&#8208;association was attributed to long&#8208;range (~6.4&#8197;&#197;) dipolar repulsions between &#960;&#8208;stacked macrocycles. This work highlights our ability to control the build&#8208;up and symmetry of macrocyclic skeletons by synthetic design, and the work needed to further our understanding of how dipoles control self&#8208;assembly.

         <title>Investigation of Glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)&#8208;Plasma Membrane Interaction in Live Cells and the Influence of GPI Glycan Structure on the Interaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 8, February 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bifunctional GPI derivative containing the entire conserved core structure of GPIs was proved to be a useful probe to target the cell membrane and tag GPI&#8208;related membrane proteins to facilitate protein isolation and proteomics analysis.







Abstract
Glycosylphosphatidylinositols (GPIs) need to interact with other components in the cell membrane to transduce transmembrane signals. A bifunctional GPI probe was employed for photoaffinity&#8208;based proximity labelling and identification of GPI&#8208;interacting proteins in the cell membrane. This probe contained the entire core structure of GPIs and was functionalized with photoreactive diazirine and clickable alkyne to facilitate its crosslinking with proteins and attachment of an affinity tag. It was disclosed that this probe was more selective than our previously reported probe containing only a part structure of the GPI core for cell membrane incorporation and an improved probe for studying GPI&#8208;cell membrane interaction. Eighty&#8208;eight unique membrane proteins, many of which are related to GPIs/GPI&#8208;anchored proteins, were identified utilizing this probe. The proteomics dataset is a valuable resource for further analyses and data mining to find new GPI&#8208;related proteins and signalling pathways. A comparison of these results with those of our previous probe provided direct evidence for the profound impact of GPI glycan structure on its interaction with the cell membrane.

Small rings: The catalytic asymmetric synthesis of highly functionalized cyclopropanes from &#945;&#8208;substituted allyl derivatives is described. The methodology, using ethyl diazoacetate, catalyzed by a chiral ruthenium complex furnished the corresponding cyclopropanes as a mixture of easily separable diastereoisomers in high yields with excellent enantioselectivities.







Abstract
The catalytic asymmetric synthesis of highly functionalized cyclopropanes from 2&#8208;substituted allylic derivatives is reported. Using ethyl diazo acetate, the reaction, catalyzed by a chiral ruthenium complex (Ru(II)&#8208;Pheox), furnished the corresponding easily separable cis and trans cyclopropanes in moderate to high yields (32&#8208;97&#8201;%) and excellent ee (86&#8208;99&#8201;%). This approach significantly extends the portfolio of accessible enantioenriched cyclopropanes from an underexplored class of olefins. DFT calculations suggest that an outer&#8208;sphere mechanism is operative in this system.

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembly of Discrete Oligomers of Naphthalenediimides in Bulk and on Surfaces</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 8, February 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Discrete oligomers of alkyl&#8208;bridged naphthalenediimides were synthesized and found to assemble into lamellar morphologies in bulk and at the liquid&#8208;solid interface. The results show that both the molecular architecture as well as the crystallization condition play a significant role in the nanoscale ordering and raise the question of the trade&#8208;off between synthetic efforts and novel properties of molecularly perfect materials.







Abstract
Here, we report on the synthesis of discrete oligomers of alkyl&#8208;bridged naphthalenediimides (NDIs) and study their molecular nanostructures both in bulk, in solution, and at the liquid&#8208;solid interface. Via an iterative synthesis method, multiple NDI cores were bridged with short and saturated alkyl&#8208;diamines (C3 and C12) or long and unsaturated alkyl&#8208;diamines (u2C33 to u8C100) at their imide termini. The strong intermolecular interaction between the NDI cores was observed by probing their photophysical properties in solution. In bulk, the discrete NDI oligomers preferentially ordered in lamellar morphologies, irrespective of whether a saturated or unsaturated spacer was employed. Moreover, both the molecular architecture as well as the crystallization conditions play a significant role in the nanoscale ordering. The long unsaturated alkyl chains lead preferably to folded&#8208;chain conformations while their saturated analogues form stretched arrangements. At the solution&#8208;solid interface, well&#8208;defined lamellar regions were observed. These results show that precision in chemical structure alone is not sufficient to reach well&#8208;defined structures of discrete oligomers, but that it must be combined with precision in processing conditions.

         <title>Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura Cross&#8208;Coupling Reaction Using Palladium Catalysts Supported on Phosphine Periodic Mesoporous Organosilica</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 8, February 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pd(0) immobilized a phosphine periodic mesoporous organosilica (P&#8208;PMO) catalyzed Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura cross coupling reactions of various aryl chlorides with phenylboronic acid. The annular dark field scanning TEM (ADF&#8208;STEM) images as well as EDX analysis evidenced that a single Pd atom supported on the P&#8208;PMO surface behaves as a reactive site.







Abstract
Phosphine periodic mesoporous organosilicas (R&#8208;P&#8208;PMO&#8208;TMS: R=Ph, tBu), which possess electron&#8208;donating alkyl substituents on the phosphorus atom, were synthesized using bifunctional compounds with alkoxysilyl&#8208; and phosphino groups, bis[3&#8208;(triethoxysilyl)propyl]phenylphosphine borane (1&#8201;a) and bis[3&#8208;(triethoxysilyl)propyl]&#8208;tert&#8208;butylphosphine borane (1&#8201;b). Immobilization of Pd(0) species was performed to give R&#8208;P&#8208;Pd&#8208;PMO&#8208;TMS: R=Ph (2&#8201;a), tBu (3&#8201;a), respectively. The Pd(0) immobilized 2&#8201;a and 3&#8201;a were applicable as catalysts for Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling reactions of aryl chlorides with phenylboronic acid. It was revealed that 3&#8201;a bearing more electron&#8208;donating tBu groups exhibited higher catalytic activity. Various functional groups including both electron withdrawing and donating substituents were compatible in the system. The recyclability of 3&#8201;a was examined to support its moderate utility for the recycle use.

         <title>Stabilization of Diborynes versus Destabilization of Diborenes by Coordination of Lewis Bases: Unravelling the Dichotomy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 8, February 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The different electronic structure of B2 and B2H2 makes them to react differently to the addition of ligands. Hence, in B2L2, electron&#8208;donating ligands shorten and strengthen the boron&#8208;boron bond whereas, in B2H2L2, they elongate and weaken the boron&#8208;boron bond.







Abstract
We have quantum chemically investigated the boron&#8208;boron bonds in B2, diborynes B2L2, and diborenes B2H2L2 (L=none, OH2, NH3) using dispersion&#8208;corrected relativistic density functional theory at ZORA&#8208;BLYP&#8208;D3(BJ)/TZ2P. B2 has effectively a single B&#8722;B bond provided by two half &#960; bonds, whereas B2H2 has effectively a double B=B bond provided by two half &#960; bonds and one &#963; 2p&#8211;2p bond. This different electronic structure causes B2 and B2H2 to react differently to the addition of ligands. Thus, in B2L2, electron&#8208;donating ligands shorten and strengthen the boron&#8208;boron bond whereas, in B2H2L2, they lengthen and weaken the boron&#8208;boron bond. The aforementioned variations in boron&#8208;boron bond length and strength become more pronounced as the Lewis basicity of the ligands L increases.

Macrocyclic and medium&#8208;sized ring ketones, lactones and lactams can all be made from common acryloyl imide starting materials through divergent, one&#8208;pot cascade ring&#8208;expansion reactions. A second ring expansion can also be performed following a second iteration of imide formation and alkene functionalisation/ring expansion.







Abstract
Macrocyclic and medium&#8208;sized ring ketones, lactones and lactams can all be made from common acryloyl imide starting materials through divergent, one&#8208;pot cascade ring&#8208;expansion reactions. Following either conjugate addition with an amine or nitromethane, or osmium(VIII)&#8208;catalysed dihydoxylation, rearrangement through a four&#8208;atom ring expansion takes place spontaneously to form the ring expanded products. A second ring expansion can also be performed following a second iteration of imide formation and alkene functionalisation/ring expansion. In the dihydroxylation series, three&#8208; or four&#8208;atom ring expansion can be performed selectively, depending on whether the reaction is under kinetic or thermodynamic control.

&lt;p&gt;Macrocyclic and medium-sized ring ketones, lactones and lactams can all be made from common acryloyl imide starting materials through divergent, one-pot cascade ring-expansion reactions. Following either conjugate addition with an amine or nitromethane, or osmium(VIII)-catalysed dihydoxylation, rearrangement through a four-atom ring expansion takes place spontaneously to form the ring expanded products. A second ring expansion can also be performed following a second iteration of imide formation and alkene functionalisation/ring expansion. In the dihydroxylation series, three- or four-atom ring expansion can be performed selectively, depending on whether the reaction is under kinetic or thermodynamic control.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Cyclotriveratrylene Solvent&#8208;Dependent Chiral Switch</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 8, February 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In and out! The control of the cyclotriveratrylene chirality by achiral solvents allow to switch from an open cage in polar aprotic solvents to an imploded one in bulky aromatic solvents. Interestingly, this controlled molecular motion of a cyclotriveratrylene unit is described for the first time.







Abstract
Chiral molecular switches are attracting attention as they could pave the way to chiral molecular machines. Herein, we report on the design and synthesis of a single molecule chiral switch based on a cyclotriveratrylene scaffold, in which the chirality inversion is controlled by the solvent. Hemicryptophanes are built around a C3 cyclotriveratrylene chiral unit, with either M or P handedness, connected to another tripod and usually displaying an &#8220;out&#8221; configuration. Here, we demonstrate that solvents are able to control the &#8220;in&#8221; and &#8220;out&#8221; configurations of the CTV unit, creating a chiral molecular switch from (M/P)&#8221;in&#8221; to (P/M)&#8221;out&#8221; handedness. The full characterization of the &#8220;in&#8221; and &#8220;out&#8221; configurations and of the chirality switch were made possible by combining NMR, HPLC, ECD, DFT and molecular dynamics. Interestingly, bulky aromatic solvents such as 2&#8208;t&#8208;butylphenol favor the &#8220;in&#8221; configuration while polar aprotic solvents such as acetone favor the &#8220;out&#8221; configuration. This chiral switch was found to be fully reversible allowing the system to oscillate between two different M and P configurations several times upon the action of solvents stimuli.

Efficient development of multifunctional photoactuators with enhanced mechanical/photomechanical properties, UV&#8208;NIR dual light&#8208;responsivity, room&#8208;temperature three&#8208;dimensional (3D) shape reprogrammability and reprocessability, and photothermal healability by simply doping polydopamine (PDA) nanoparticles into main&#8208;chain azo semi&#8208;crystalline poly(ester&#8208;amide) (PEA) films is described. They are compatible with aqueous environment and exhibit photothermal deformation below the melting temperature based on a unique photothermally induced hydrogen bond&#8208;disruption mechanism.







Abstract
The development of soft photoactuators with multifunctionality and improved performance is highly important for their broad applications. Herein, we report on a facile and efficient strategy for fabricating such photoactuators with UV&#8208;NIR dual light&#8208;responsivity, room&#8208;temperature 3D shape reprogrammability and reprocessability, and photothermal healability by doping polydopamine (PDA) nanoparticles into a main&#8208;chain azobenzene semi&#8208;crystalline poly(ester&#8208;amide) (PEA). The PEA/PDA nanoparticle composite was readily processed into free&#8208;standing films with enhanced mechanical and photomechanical properties compared with the blank PEA films. Its physically crosslinked uniaxially oriented films showed rapid and highly reversible photochemically induced bending/unbending under the UV/visible light irradiation at room temperature in both the air atmosphere and water. When exposed to the NIR light, they (and their bilayer films formed with a polyimide film) exhibited photothermally induced bending even at a temperature much lower than their crystalline&#8208;to&#8208;isotropic phase transition temperature based on a unique mechanism (involving photothermally induced polymer chain relaxation due to the disruption of their hydrogen bonds). The room&#8208;temperature 3D shape reprogrammability and reprocessability and photothermal healability of the composite polymer films were also demonstrated. Such multifunctional dual light&#8208;responsive photoactuators with well&#8208;balanced mechanical robustness, actuation stability, 3D shape reprogrammability/reprocessability and photothermal healability hold much promise in various photoactuating applications.

         <title>Capturing Sialyl&#8208;glycan on Live Cancer Cells by Tailored Boronopeptide

This investigation demonstrates that the appropriate positioning of a customized boronic acid probe into a sialic acid binding epitope leverages a selective and potent binder of sialyl&#8208;glycan. Such synergistic peptide probe is promising in clinical oncology for diagnosis.







Abstract
Boronic acid&#8208;containing molecules are substantially popularized in chemical biology and medicinal chemistry due to the broad spectrum of covalent conjugations as well as interaction modules offered by the versatile boron atom. Apparently, the WGA peptide (wheat germ agglutinin, 62&#8211;73), which shows a considerably low binding affinity to sialic acid, turned into a selective and &gt;5 folds potent binder with the aid of a suitable boronic acid probe installed chemoselectively. In silico studies prompted us to install BA probes on the cysteine residue, supposedly located in close proximity to the bound sialic acid. In vitro studies revealed that the tailored boronopeptides show enhanced binding ability due to the synergistic recognition governed by selective non&#8208;covalent interactions and cis&#8208;diol boronic acid conjugation. The intense binding is observed even in 10&#8201;% serum, thus enabling profiling of sialyl&#8208;glycan on cancer cells, as compared with the widely used lectin, Sambucus nigra. The synergistic binding mode between the best boronopeptide (P3) binder and sialic acid was analyzed via 1H and 11B&#8197;NMR.

         <title>An In Crystallo Reaction with an Engineered Cytochrome P450 Peroxygenase
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 8, February 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An engineered P450 peroxygenase, T252E&#8208;CYP199A4, requires only H2O2 for O&#8208;demethylation to occur with 4&#8208;methoxybenzoic acid as substrate. Crystals of this peroxygenase with substrate bound were soaked with H2O2 and showed a loss of electron density, which is consistent with in crystallo O&#8208;demethylation.







Abstract
The cytochrome P450 monooxygenases (CYPs) are a class of heme&#8208;thiolate enzymes that insert oxygen into unactivated C&#8722;H bonds. These enzymes can be converted into peroxygenases via protein engineering, which enables their activity to occur using hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) without the requirement for additional nicotinamide co&#8208;factors or partner proteins. Here, we demonstrate that soaking crystals of an engineered P450 peroxygenase with H2O2 enables the enzymatic reaction to occur within the crystal. Crystals of the designed P450 peroxygenase, the T252E mutant of CYP199A4, in complex with 4&#8208;methoxybenzoic acid were soaked with different concentrations of H2O2 for varying times to initiate the in crystallo O&#8208;demethylation reaction. Crystal structures of T252E&#8208;CYP199A4 showed a distinct loss of electron density that was consistent with the O&#8208;demethylated metabolite, 4&#8208;hydroxybenzoic acid. A new X&#8208;ray crystal structure of this enzyme with the 4&#8208;hydroxybenzoic acid product was obtained to enable comparison alongside the existing substrate&#8208;bound structure. The visualisation of enzymatic catalysis in action is challenging in structural biology and the ability to initiate the reactions of P450 enzymes, in crystallo by simply soaking crystals with H2O2 will enable new structural biology methods and techniques to be applied to study their mechanism of action.

The visualisation of enzymatic catalysis in action is challenging in structural biology and the ability to initiate the reactions of P450 enzymes, in crystallo by simply soaking crystals with H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; will enable new structural biology methods and techniques to be applied to study their mechanism of action.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Conformationally Stable &#960;&#8208;Expanded X&#8208;Type Double Helicene Comprising Dihydropyracylene Units with Multistage Redox Behavior</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 8, February 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unprecedented X&#8208;type double helicene with &#960;&#8208;expanded polycyclic framework and exceptional conformational stability was realized and its enantiomers were successfully separated. Comprehensive spectroscopic and electrochemical studies in conjunction with theory identified the compound as a strong chiral fluorophore with 5&#8208;stage amphoteric redox behavior.







Abstract
A &#960;&#8208;expanded X&#8208;type double [5]helicene comprising dihydropyracylene moieties was synthesized from commercially available acenaphthene. X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis revealed the unique highly twisted structure of the compound resulting in the occurrence of two enantiomers which were separated by chiral HPLC, owing to their high conformational stability. The compound shows strongly bathochromically shifted UV/vis absorption and emission bands with small Stokes shift and considerable photoluminescence quantum yield and circular polarized luminescence response. The electrochemical studies revealed five facilitated reversible redox events, including three reductions and two oxidations, thus qualifying the compound as chiral multistage redox amphoter. The experimental findings are in line with the computational studies based on density functional theory pointing towards increased spatial extension of the frontier molecular orbitals over the polycyclic framework and a considerably narrowed HOMO&#8211;LUMO gap.

Diverse N&#8208;heterocyclic olefins (NHOs) were prepared by the direct reaction of NHCs or MICs with N&#8208;aziridinylimines. The prepared NHOs&#8217; activity in ring&#8208;opening polymerizations and their frustrated Lewis pair reactivity were studied.







Abstract
A direct synthesis of N&#8208;heterocyclic olefins (NHOs) and their mesoionic congeners (mNHOs) from N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes and N&#8208;aziridinylimines is reported. The reaction provided diverse functionalized (m)NHOs and &#960;&#8208;extended analogues. The prepared NHOs initiated the ring&#8208;opening polymerization of &#946;&#8208;butyrolactone, and insertion of aldehyde and nitrile into an NHO&#8208;B(C6F5)3 adduct was demonstrated.

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed C&#8722;H (Phenylsulfonyl)difluoromethylation of Acrylamides: Scope, Mechanism, and Critical Role of Additives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 8, February 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report first CuII&#8208;catalyzed Z&#8208;selective difluoromethylation of vinylic&#8208;C(sp2)&#8722;H bond of acrylamides bearing a native functional group with an in&#8208;home designed and stable electrophilic salt. The versatility of the CF2SO2Ph group was shown and mechanistic studies supported by DFT calculations highlight the critical role of additives. The process was achieved under robust reaction conditions in the presence of the readily available Cu(OAc)2.







Abstract
Herein, we report the Cu&#8208;complex catalyzed, native functional group&#8208;assisted, and TFA/NMF additives promoted (phenylsulfonyl)difluoromethylation of vinylic C(sp2)&#8722;H bond of acrylamides. Using our in&#8208;home designed reagent, this reaction enables the construction of the C(sp2)&#8722;CF2SO2Ph bond from simple C&#8722;H bond activation by copper catalysis under mild reaction conditions with total Z&#8208;selectivity. The versatility of utilized fluorinated group was illustrated by its conversion into value&#8208;added CF2 moieties as well as the remarkable =CHF residue. The performed experimental and computational mechanistic studies enabled to identify the true nature of active catalyst and substrate, as well as establish critical roles of TFA and NMF additives. In this reaction, the TFA acts as a promoter of the much&#8208;needed CuII/CuII&#8594;CuIII/CuI disproportionation, while the NMF facilitates the following ligand exchange and C&#8722;C coupling processes. We ruled out the generation of radical intermediates and established the C&#8722;H activation to be irreversible and the rate&#8208;determining step of the entire process.

         <title>trans&#8208;Cyclooctenes as Scavengers of Bromine Involved in Catalytic Bromination</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 8, February 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A trans&#8208;cyclooctene (TCO) bearing a 2&#8208;pyridylethyl group was developed to retard non&#8208;catalyzed reactions in bromination using N&#8208;bromosuccinimide by capturing in&#8197;situ&#8208;generated bromine (Br2), which was revealed to cause background reactions. The TCO is useful as an additive for improving catalyst&#8208;controlled selectivity and as a probe to investigate the involvement of Br2 in catalytic bromination.







Abstract
Scavengers that capture reactive chemical substances are used to prevent the decomposition of materials. However, in the field of catalysis, the development of scavengers that inhibit background pathways has attracted little attention, although the concept will open up an otherwise inaccessible reaction space. In catalytic bromination, fast non&#8208;catalyzed background reactions disturb the catalytic control of the selectivity, even when using N&#8208;bromoamide reagents, which have a milder reactivity than bromine (Br2). Here, we developed a trans&#8208;cyclooctene (TCO) bearing a 2&#8208;pyridylethyl group to efficiently retard background reactions by capturing Br2 in bromocyclization using N&#8208;bromosuccinimide. The use of less than a stoichiometric amount of the TCO was sufficient to inhibit non&#8208;catalyzed reactions, and mechanistic studies using the TCO revealed that in&#8197;situ&#8208;generated Br2 provides non&#8208;catalyzed reaction pathways based on a chain mechanism. The TCO is useful as an additive for improving enantioselectivity and regioselectivity in catalytic reactions. Cooperative systems using the TCO with selective catalysts offer an alternative strategy for optimizing catalyst&#8208;controlled selectivity during bromination. Moreover, it also served as an indicator of Br2 involved in catalytic reaction pathways; thus, the TCO was useful as a probe for mechanistic investigations into the involvement of Br2 in bromination reactions of interest.

         <title>Ethynyl&#8208;B(dan) in [3+2] Cycloaddition and Larock Indole Synthesis: Synthesis of Stable Boron&#8208;Containing Heteroaromatic Compounds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 8, February 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Direct, efficient synthesis of diverse five&#8208;membered heteroaryl&#8208;B(dan) with excellent protodeborylation&#8208;resistant properties has been achieved depending upon [3+2] cycloaddition or Pd&#8208;catalyzed heteroannulation of ethynyl&#8208;B(dan). The resulting heteroaryl&#8208;B(dan) has been demonstrated to undergo direct cross&#8208;coupling, regardless of the highly diminished Lewis acidity.







Abstract
The cycloaddition of nitrile oxides with ethynyl&#8208;B(dan) (dan=naphthalene&#8208;1,8&#8208;diaminato) allowed the facile preparation of diverse isoxazolyl&#8208;B(dan) compounds, all of which displayed excellent protodeborylation&#8208;resistant properties. The dan&#8208;installation on the boron center proves vital to the high stability of the products as well as the perfect regioselectivity arising from hydrogen bond&#8208;directed orientation in the cycloaddition. The diminished boron&#8208;Lewis acidity of ethynyl&#8208;B(dan) also renders it amenable to azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition, Larock indole synthesis and related heteroannulations. The obtained boron&#8208;containing triazole, indoles, benzofuran and indenone exhibit sufficient resistance toward protodeborylation. Despite the commonly accepted transmetalation&#8208;inactive property derived from the diminished Lewis acidity, the synthesized heteroaryl&#8208;B(dan) compound was still found to be convertible to the oligoarene via sequential Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura coupling.

         <title>Halogen Substitution Regulates High Temperature Dielectric Switch in Lead&#8208;Free Chiral Hybrid Perovskites</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 8, February 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This article reports a pair of 1D lead&#8208;free hybrid metal halides: (R&#8208;3FP)2SbCl5 (1; 3FP=3&#8208;fluoropyrrolidinium) and (R&#8208;3FP)2SbBr5 (2) exhibit high temperature triggered structural phase transition and dielectric switching properties. By halogen substitution in the inorganic framework, the dielectric switch temperature of 2 increased about 20&#8197;K, compared with 1.







Abstract
Hybrid metal halides (HMHs) based phase transition materials have received widespread attention due to their excellent performance and potential applications in energy harvesting, optoelectronics, ferroics, and actuators. Nevertheless, effectively regulating the properties of phase transitions is still a thorny problem. In this work, two chiral lead&#8208;free HMHs (R&#8208;3FP)2SbCl5 (1; 3FP=3&#8208;fluoropyrrolidinium) and (R&#8208;3FP)2SbBr5 (2) were synthesized. By replacing the halide ions in the inorganic skeleton, the phase transition temperature of 2 changes with an increase of about 20&#8197;K, compared with 1. Meanwhile, both compounds display reversible dielectric switching properties. Through crystal structure analysis and Hirshfeld surface analysis, their phase transitions are ascribed to the disorder of the cations and deformation of the inorganic chains.

         <title>A Nitronyl Nitroxide&#8208;Substituted Benzotriazinyl Tetraradical
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 8, February 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A tetraradical with a triplet ground state and a nearby excited quintet state, high thermal stability, and reversible redox waves has been prepared by using the palladium&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling reaction of a triiodo&#8208;derivative of benzotriazinyl radical with a gold(I) nitronyl nitroxide&#8208;2&#8208;ide complex in the presence of an efficient catalytic system: Pd2(dba)3/MeCgPPh.







Abstract
High&#8208;spin organic tetraradicals with significant intramolecular exchange interactions have high potential for advanced technological applications and fundamental research, but those synthesized to date possess limited stability and processability. In this work, we have designed a tetraradical based on the Blatter's radical and nitronyl nitroxide radical moieties and successfully synthesized it by using the palladium&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling reaction of a triiodo&#8208;derivative of the 1,2,4&#8208;benzotriazinyl radical with gold(I) nitronyl nitroxide&#8208;2&#8208;ide complex in the presence of a newly developed efficient catalytic system. The molecular and crystal structure of the tetraradical was confirmed by X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis. The tetraradical possesses good thermal stability with decomposition onset at &#8764;150&#8201;&#176;C under an inert atmosphere and exhibits reversible redox waves at &#8722;0.54 and 0.45&#8197;V versus Ag/AgCl. The magnetic properties of the tetraradical were characterized by SQUID magnetometry of polycrystalline powders and EPR spectroscopy in various matrices. The collected data, analyzed by using high&#8208;level quantum chemical calculations, confirmed that the tetraradical has a triplet ground state and a nearby excited quintet state. The unique high stability of the prepared triazinyl&#8208;nitronylnitroxide tetraradical is a new milestone in the field of creating high&#8208;spin systems.

         <title>Reinforcing the Adsorption and Conversion of Polysulfides in Li&#8722;S Battery by Incorporating Molybdenum into MnS/MnO Nanorods</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 8, February 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A molybdenum&#8208;doped MnS/MnO@C porous structure is designed as a multifunctional coating on the polypropylene separator to achieve the synergistic effect mechanism between &#8220;strong adsorption&#8221; and &#8220;rapid conversion&#8221; for lithium polysulfides.







Abstract
The Sabatier principle suggests that an excessive adsorption of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) by metal compounds may hinder their conversion in the absence of a conversion module. Therefore, it is imperative to establish a synergetic effect mechanism between &#8220;strong adsorption&#8221; and &#8220;rapid conversion&#8221; for LiPSs. To achieve this coexistence, a molybdenum&#8208;doped MnS/MnO@C porous structure is designed as a multifunctional coating on the polypropylene (PP) separator. The incorporation of MnS/MnO@C enhances the adsorption capacity towards LiPSs, while molybdenum facilitates subsequent conversion. Benefiting from the synergistic effect of each component and its large specific surface area, the cell with Mo&#8208;doped MnS/MnO@C coating achieves smooth adsorption&#8208;diffusion&#8208;conversion processes and exhibits an appreciable rate performance with outstanding cycling stability. Even when sulfur loading increases to 9.68&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2, the modified battery delivers an excellent initial areal capacity of 11.69&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and maintains 6.97&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2 after 50 cycles at 0.1&#8197;C. This study presents a promising approach to simultaneously accomplish &#8220;strong adsorption&#8221; and &#8220;rapid conversion&#8221; of polysulfides, offering novel perspectives for devising dual&#8208;functional modified separators.

         <title>Enhancing the Potential of Fused Heterocycle&#8208;Based Triarylhydrazone Photoswitches</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 8, February 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new class of triarylhydrazone photoswitches was designed, following an idea to control the strength of a hydrogen bond connecting the photo&#8208;active hydrazone part with a heteroaryl substituent. Introducing a benzothiazole moiety results in high overall thermal stability, absorption above 365&#8197;nm, while maintaining satisfactory photoconversion rates.

Triarylhydrazones represent an attractive class of photochromic compounds offering many interesting features including high molar absorptivity, good addressability, and extraordinary thermal stability. In addition, unlike most other hydrazone&#8208;based photoswitches, they effectively absorb light above 365&#8197;nm. However, previously prepared triaryhydrazones suffer from low quantum yields of the Z&#8594;E photoisomerization. Here, we have designed a new subclass of naphthoyl&#8208;benzothiazole hydrazones that balance the most beneficial features of previously reported naphthoyl&#8208;quinoline and benzoyl&#8208;pyridine triarylhydrazones. These preserve the attractive absorption characteristics, exhibit higher thermal stability of the metastable form than the former and enhance the rate of the Z&#8594;E photoisomerization compared to the later, as a result of the weakening of the intramolecular hydrogen bonding between the hydrazone hydrogen and the benzothiazole moiety. Introducing the benzothiazole motif extends the tunability of the photochromic behaviour of hydrazone&#8208;based switches.

&lt;p&gt;A new class of triarylhydrazone photoswitches was designed, following an idea to control the strength of a hydrogen bond connecting the photo-active hydrazone part with a heteroaryl substituent. Introducing a benzothiazole moiety results in high overall thermal stability, absorption above 365&#8197;nm, while maintaining satisfactory photoconversion rates. High-quality calculations and advanced ultrafast spectroscopy allowed the nature of the electronic transitions to be resolved, and the light was shed on the mechanism of photoisomerization and de-excitation processes.

         <title>Discovery of Unusual Ajmaline&#8208;Macroline Type Bisindole Alkaloids from Alstonia macrophylla by Building Blocks&#8208;Based Molecular Networking</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 8, February 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three unusual ajmaline&#8208;macroline type bisindole alkaloids, alsmaphylines A&#8211;C (1&#8211;3), were rapidly discovered and isolated from the stem barks and leaves of Alstonia macrophylla via a building blocks&#8208;based molecular network (BBMN) strategy.







Abstract
Three unusual ajmaline&#8208;macroline type bisindole alkaloids, alsmaphylines A&#8211;C, together with their postulated biogenetic precursors, were isolated from the stem barks and leaves of Alstonia macrophylla via the building blocks&#8208;based molecular network (BBMN) strategy. Alsmaphyline A represents a rare ajmaline&#8208;macroline type bisindole alkaloid with an S&#8208;shape polycyclic ring system. Alsmaphylines B and C are two novel ajmaline&#8208;macroline type bisindole alkaloids with N&#8208;1&#8722;C&#8208;21&#8242; linkages, and the former possesses an unconventional stacked conformation due to the presence of intramolecular noncovalent interactions. The chemical structures including absolute configurations of alsmaphylines A&#8211;C were established by comprehensive spectroscopic analyses, electronic circular dichroism (ECD) calculations, and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray crystallography. In addition, a plausible biosynthetic pathway of these bisindole alkaloids as well as their ability to promote the protein synthesis on HT22 cells were discussed.

         <title>Immobilizing Bimetallic RuCo Nanoalloys on Few&#8208;Layered MXene as a Robust Bifunctional Electrocatalyst for Overall Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 8, February 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ice and fire: The ruthenium&#8208;cobalt bimetallic nanoalloy&#8208;coupled exfoliated Ti3C2Tx MXene (RuCo&#8722;Ti3C2Tx) has been constructed by ice&#8208;templated and high&#8208;temperature activation approaches, which provide a feasible and efficient strategy for developing MXene&#8208;based catalysts for overall water splitting.







Abstract
Doping Co atoms into Ru lattices can tune the electronic structure of active sites, and the conductive MXene can adjust the electrical conductivity of catalysts, which are both favorable for improving the electrocatalytic activity of the catalyst for water splitting. Here, ruthenium&#8208;cobalt bimetallic nanoalloys coupled with exfoliated Ti3C2Tx MXene (RuCo&#8722;Ti3C2Tx) have been constructed by ice&#8208;templated and thermal activation. Due to the strong interaction between the RuCo nanoalloys and conductive MXene, RuCo&#8722;Ti3C2Tx not only exhibits an excellent hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) performance with a low overpotential and Tafel slope (60&#8197;mV, 34.8&#8197;mV&#8201;dec&#8722;1 in 0.5&#8197;M H2SO4 and 52&#8197;mV, 38.7&#8197;mV&#8201;dec&#8722;1 in 1&#8197;M KOH), but also good oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance in an alkaline electrolyte (266&#8197;mV, 111.1&#8197;mV&#8201;dec&#8722;1 in 1&#8197;M KOH). The assembled RuCo&#8722;Ti3C2Tx||RuCo&#8722;Ti3C2Tx electrolyzer requires a lower potential (1.56&#8197;V) than does the Pt/C||RuO2 electrolyzer at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. A boosted catalytic HER activity from immobilizing the RuCo nanoalloys on MXene was unveiled by density functional theory calculations. This study provides a feasible and efficient strategy for developing MXene&#8208;based catalysts for overall water splitting.

         <title>Enzymatic Synthesis of Diterpenoids from iso&#8208;GGPP&#8197;III: A Geranylgeranyl Diphosphate Analog with a Shifted Double Bond</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 8, February 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The geranylgeranyl diphosphate (GGPP) analog iso&#8208;GGPP&#8197;III with a shifted double bond was synthesized and enzymatically converted with six diterpene synthases. The main products were isolated from the often complex product mixtures and structurally characterized, revealing, in several cases, the formation of compounds with novel skeletons that can be explained by the changed reactivity of the substrate analog.







Abstract
The analog of the diterpene precursor geranylgeranyl diphosphate with a double bond shifted from C14=C15 to C15=C16 (named iso&#8208;GGPP&#8197;III) has been synthesized and enzymatically converted with six bacterial diterpene synthases; this allowed the isolation of nine unnatural diterpenes. For some of the enzyme&#8208;substrate combinations, the different reactivity implemented in the substrate analog iso&#8208;GGPP&#8197;III opened reaction pathways that are not observed with natural GGPP, resulting in the formation of diterpenes with novel skeletons. A stereoselective deuteration strategy was used to assign the absolute configurations of the isolated diterpenes.

Abstract
H&#8208;selenite anions (HSeO3&#8722;) form in the solid unprecedented anionic supramolecular chains wherein single units are assembled via alternating short Se&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O and H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O contacts. Crystallographic analyses and computational studies (the quantum theory of &#8220;atoms&#8208;in&#8208;molecules&#8221;, QTAIM, and the noncovalent interaction plot, NCIPlot) consistently prove the attractive nature of these chalcogen bonds (ChBs) and hydrogen honds (HBs), the Janus&#8208;type character of HSeO3&#8722; anions which act as both donors and acceptors of ChB and HB, and the possible stability of anion dimers in solution. The effectiveness of the ChBs herein described may lead to consider the HSeO3&#8722; moiety as a new entry in the toolbox of crystal engineering based on ChB.

&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;) can act as donor and acceptor of both hydrogen bond and chalcogen bond; the resulting anion&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;anion self-assembly forms uncommon and structurally different infinite chains featuring an unprecedented Janus-type team up between the two interactions.

         <title>Regulating Excited States by Varying Different Acceptors of D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A Emitters for Efficient Non&#8208;Doped Blue Electroluminescence with High Luminance and Low Efficiency Roll&#8208;Off</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 8, February 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A emitters with different acceptors are designed and synthesized, and the excited states could be manipulated from LE&#8208;dominated (mPAN, and mPANPH) to HLCT featured (mPNAPH) transition. The non&#8208;doped OLED based on mPNAPH exhibits pure blue emission at 456&#8197;nm with high Lmax of 35290&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2, EQEmax of 6.13&#8201;% and low efficiency roll&#8208;off.







Abstract
Chromophores with hybridized local and charge&#8208;transfer (HLCT) excited state are promising for the realization of high performance blue organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs). The rational manipulation of HLCT excited state for efficient emitters remains challenging. Herein, we present three donor&#8208;&#960;&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A) molecules (mPAN, mPANPH, and mPNAPH) with phenanthro[9,10&#8208;d]imidazole (PI) and pyridinyl as donor and &#960;&#8208;bridge respectively. Changes in various kinds of polycyclic aromatic derivative acceptors (anthracene, 9&#8208;phenylanthracene, and 1&#8208;phenylnaphthalene) could manipulate the excited states and optoelectronic properties. Theoretical calculations reveal that the S1 state of mPNAPH exhibits HLCT nature while the other two molecules show local excited (LE) state dominated feature. The photophysical properties also demonstrate this characteristic. Therefore, compared with mPAN and mPANPH, mPNAPH has higher photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) whether in solutions or neat films. Ultimately, the non&#8208;doped devices based on these emitters show high luminance larger than 35000&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2, and high maximum external quantum efficiencies (EQEmaxs) larger than 5&#8201;% with low efficiency roll&#8208;off. In particular, the mPNAPH&#8208;based device displays an excellent performance of pure blue emission at 456&#8197;nm with Commission Internationale de L'Eclairage coordinate of (0.15, 0.16) and EQEmax of 6.13&#8201;% that benefited from the HLCT state and high&#8208;lying reverse intersystem crossing process.

         <title>Cu(II) Promoted C(sp3)&#8722;H Activation in Unactivated Cycloalkanes: Oxo&#8208;Alkylation of Styrenes to Synthesize &#946;&#8208;Disubstituted Ketones</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 8, February 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Various &#946;&#8208;disubstituted ketone derivatives are synthesized from styrenes via oxo&#8208;alkylation of unactivated cycloalkanes. Anhydrous CuCl2 acts as a catalyst in presence of TBHP oxidant and 1&#8208;methylimidazole base. A wide range of olefinic arenes as well as broad range of aliphatic C&#8722;H substrates are well tolerated in this protocol.







Abstract
We report the Cu(II) catalyzed synthesis of &#946;&#8208;disubstituted ketones from styrene via oxo&#8208;alkylation with unactivated cycloalkanes as the alkylating agent in presence of tert&#8208;butylhydroperoxide (TBHP) and 1&#8208;methylimidazole as oxidant and base respectively. &#946;&#8208;disubstituted ketones are known to be synthesized by using either expensive Ru/Ir complexes, or low&#8208;cost metal complexes (e.&#8201;g., Fe, Mn) with activated species like aldehyde, acid, alcohol, or phthalimide derivatives as the alkylating agent, however, use of unactivated cycloalkanes directly as the alkylating agent remains challenging. A wide range of aliphatic C&#8722;H substrates as well as various olefinic arenes and heteroarene (35 substrates including 14 new substrates) are well&#8208;tolerated in this method. Hammett analysis shed more light on the substitution effect in the olefinic part on the overall mechanism. Furthermore, the controlled experiments, kinetic isotope effect study, and theoretical calculations (DFT) enable us to gain deeper insight of mechanistic intricacies of this new simple and atom&#8208;economic methodology.

         <title>Facile Access to Cationic Methylstannylenes and Silylenes Stabilized by E&#8722;Pt Bonding and their Methyl Group Transfer Reactivity
</title>

Pt/Sn and Pt/Si heterobimetallic complexes were developed, cationic methyl stannylene was prepared by complete Me group transfer from Pt(II) to Sn under mild conditions, low valent silicon was stabilized with neutral nitrogen donor. Transmetalation from a monomethyl Pt center was triggered by hydride sources.







Abstract
We describe a family of cationic methylstannylene and chloro&#8208; and azidosilylene organoplatinum(II) complexes supported by a neutral, binucleating ligand. Methylstannylenes MeSn:+ are stabilized by coordination to PtII and are formed by facile Me group transfer from dimethyl or monomethyl PtII complexes, in the latter case triggered by concomitant B&#8722;H, Si&#8722;H, and H2 bond activation that involves hydride transfer from Sn to Pt. A cationic chlorosilylene complex was obtained by formal HCl elimination and Cl&#8722; removal from HSiCl3 under ambient conditions. The computational studies show that stabilization of cationic methylstannylenes and cationic silylenes is achieved through weak coordination to a neutral N&#8208;donor ligand binding pocket. The analysis of the electronic potentials, as well as the Laplacian of electron density, also reveals the differences in the character of Pt&#8722;Si vs. Pt&#8722;Sn bonding. We demonstrate the importance of a ligand&#8208;supported binuclear Pt/tetrel core and weak coordination to facilitate access to tetrylium&#8208;ylidene Pt complexes, and a transmetalation approach to the synthesis of MeSnII:+ derivatives.

         <title>Cover Feature: trans&#8208;Cyclooctenes as Scavengers of Bromine Involved in Catalytic Bromination (Chem. Eur. J. 8/2024)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 8, February 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A trans&#8208;cyclooctene (TCO) bearing a 2&#8208;pyridylethyl group has been developed to retard uncatalyzed bromination reactions using N&#8208;bromosuccinimide by capturing bromine generated in situ, which was revealed to cause background reactions. The TCO is useful as an additive for improving catalyst&#8208;controlled selectivity and as a probe to investigate the involvement of Br2 in catalytic bromination. More information can be found in the Research Article by D. Uraguchi, K. Asano and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202303399).

         <title>Front Cover: Enhancing the Potential of Fused Heterocycle&#8208;Based Triarylhydrazone Photoswitches (Chem. Eur. J. 8/2024)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 8, February 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new class of triarylhydrazone photoswitches has been designed, following an idea to control the strength of a hydrogen bond connecting the photo&#8208;active hydrazone part with a heteroaryl substituent. Introducing a benzothiazole moiety results in high thermal stability, absorption above 365&#8197;nm, and satisfactory photoconversion rates. High&#8208;quality calculations and advanced ultrafast spectroscopy allowed the nature of the electronic transitions to be resolved and the photoisomerization mechanism to be elucidated. More information can be found in the Research Article by A.&#8197;M. Grabarz, M. Cig&#225;&#328; and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202303509).

         <title>Supramolecular Organic Ferroelectric Materials from Donor&#8211;Acceptor Systems</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 8, February 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review highlights emerging molecular designs for purely organic ferroelectric materials based on supramolecular assembly of different donor (D)&#8211;acceptor (A) systems including classical D&#8208;A co&#8208;crystals or gels those exhibit inter&#8208;molecular charge&#8208;transfer interactions. Subsequent developments in single component dipolar and more recently ambipolar systems (with intra&#8208;molecular charge&#8208;transfer) are discussed with specific emphasis on the impact of chiral supramolecular polymerization in ferroelectricity and piezoelectricity.







Abstract
Organic ferroelectric (FE) materials, though known for more than a century, are yet to reach close to the benchmark of inorganic or hybrid materials in terms of the magnitude of polarization. Amongst the different classes of organic systems, donor (D)&#8211;acceptor (A) charge&#8208;transfer (CT) complexes are recognized as promising for ferroelectricity owing to their neutral&#8208;to&#8208;ionic phase transition at low temperature. This review presents an overview of different supramolecular D&#8208;A systems that have been explored for FE phase transitions. The discussion begins with a general introduction of ferroelectricity and its different associated parameters. Then it moves on to show early examples of CT cocrystals that have shown FE properties at sub&#8208;ambient temperature. Subsequently, recent developments in the field of room temperature (RT) ferroelectricity, exhibited by H&#8208;bond&#8208;stabilized lock&#8208;arm supramolecular&#8208;ordering (LASO) in D&#8208;A co&#8208;crystals or other FE CT&#8208;crystals devoid of neutral&#8208;ionic phase transition are discussed. Then the discussion moves on to emerging reports on other D&#8208;A soft materials such as gel and foldable polymers; finally it shows very recent developments in ferroelectricity in supramolecular assemblies of single&#8208;component dipolar or ambipolar &#960;&#8208;systems, exhibiting intra&#8208;molecular charge transfer. The effects of structural nuances such as H&#8208;bonding, balanced charge transfer and chirality on the observed ferroelectricity is described with the available examples. Finally, piezoelectricity in recently reported ambipolar ADA&#8208;type systems are discussed to highlight the future potential of these soft materials in micropower energy harvesting.

         <title>Progress in Fabrication and Applications of Cholesteric Liquid Crystal Microcapsules</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 8, February 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A comprehensive overview of recent advances in cholesteric liquid crystal microcapsules, focusing on the preparation methods of cholesteric liquid crystal microcapsules, the shell layer materials used for the preparation of cholesteric liquid crystal microcapsules, as well as the application areas of cholesteric liquid crystal microcapsules. In addition, some insights into their future development are introduced.







Abstract
Liquid crystals (LCs) are well known for inherent responsiveness to external stimuli, such as light, thermal, magnetic, and electric fields. Cholesteric LCs are among the most fascinating, since they possess distinctive optical properties due to the helical molecular orientation. However, the good flow, easy contamination, and poor stability of small&#8208;molecule LCs limit their further applications, and microencapsulation as one of the most effective tools can evade these disadvantages. Microencapsulation can offer shell&#8208;core structure with LCs in the core can strengthen their stability, avoiding interference with the environment while maintaining the stimuli&#8208;responsiveness and optical properties. Here, we report recent progress in the fabrication and applications of cholesteric LC microcapsules (CLCMCs). We summarize general properties and basic principles, fabrication methods including interfacial polymerization, in&#8208;situ polymerization, complex coacervation, solvent evaporation, microfluidic and polymerization of reactive mesogens, and then give a comprehensive overview of their applications in various popular domains, including smart fabrics, smart sensor, smart displays, anti&#8208;counterfeiting, information encryption, biomedicine and actuators. Finally, we discuss the currently facing challenges and the potential development directions in this field.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 8, February 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synthetic methods for the preparation of the carbazole moiety are reviewed. These methods describe the formation of new C&#8722;C and C&#8722;N bonds under mild conditions enabling broad substrate diversity and functional group tolerance. Photochemical, thermal and electrochemical transformations are described as interesting preparative methodologies.







Abstract
Carbazole is a heterocyclic motif that can be found in a diverse array of natural and unnatural products displaying a wide range of biological and physiological properties. Furthermore, this heterocycle is part of electronic materials like photoconducting polymers and organic optoelectronic materials owing to its excellent photophysical characteristics. Consequently, the development of synthetic strategies for carbazole scaffolds holds potential significance in biological and material fields. In this regard, a variety of preparation methods has been developed to exploit their efficient and distinct formation of new C&#8722;C and C&#8208;heteroatom bonds under mild conditions and enabling broad substrate diversity and functional group tolerance. Therefore, this review focuses on the synthesis of a set of carbazole derivatives describing a variety of methodologies that involve direct irradiation, photosensitization, photoredox, electrochemical and thermal cyclization reactions.

         <title>Preparation of Dinitrogen Trioxidefor Organic Synthesis: A Phase Equilibrium Approach</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dinitrogen trioxide (N2O3) is a potent and atom economic nitrosating agent. The preparation of N2O3 is difficult due to its instability and entangled chemical and phase equilibria. This review reexamines the preparative methods of pure N2O3 and its concentrated (&gt;0.1&#8197;M) solutions via a phase equilibrium approach in combination with worked examples in organic synthesis.







Abstract
Dinitrogen trioxide (N2O3) is a potent nitrosating agent featured with high reactivity and appealing atom economy. Because of its instability and the entanglement of chemical and phase equilibria, N2O3 has rarely been utilized in organic synthesis as a stock reagent with well&#8208;defined composition. In this review,the preparations of pure N2O3 and its concentrated solution (&gt;0.1&#8197;M) are discussed from the aspect of phase equilibrium. Understanding the physical and chemical characteristics of N2O3, along with how reaction parameters (temperature, pressure, molar ratio) interact, plays a crucial role in managing the concentration of N2O3 in the liquid phase. This control holds practical significance in achieving quantitative reactions.

         <title>Direct Band Gap Semiconductors with Two&#8208; and Three&#8208;Dimensional Triel&#8208;Phosphide Frameworks (Triel=Al, Ga, In)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
New family of direct band gap semiconductors. The new compound Na3In2P3 is a semiconductor with a direct band gap of 1.27&#8197;eV and exhibits a three&#8208;dimensional polyanionic framework of corner&#8208;sharing InP4 tetrahedra. Additionally, the related phosphidotrielates Li3AlP2, Li3GaP2, Li3InP2 and Na3InP2, which are all built up by triel phosphorus tetrahedra as well, have been proven to be semiconductors as well, with direct band gaps ranging from of 1.37&#8197;eV to 2.45&#8197;eV.







Abstract
Recently, several ternary phosphidotrielates and &#8208;tetrelates have been investigated with respect to their very good ionic conductivity, while less focus was pointed towards their electronic structures. Here, we report on a novel series of compounds, in which several members possess direct band gaps. We investigated the known compounds Li3AlP2, Li3GaP2, Li3InP2, and Na3InP2 and describe the synthesis and the crystal structure of novel Na3In2P3. For all mentioned phosphidotrielates reflectance UV&#8208;Vis measurements reveal direct band gaps in the visible light region with decreasing band gaps in the series: Li3AlP2 (2.45&#8197;eV), Li3GaP2 (2.18&#8197;eV), Li3InP2 (1.99&#8197;eV), Na3InP2 (1.37&#8197;eV), and Na3In2P3 (1.27&#8197;eV). All direct band gaps are confirmed by quantum chemical calculations. The unexpected property occurs despite different structure types. As a common feature all compounds contain EP4 tetrahedra, which share exclusively vertices for E=In and vertices as well as edges for E=Al and Ga. The structure of the novel Na3In2P3 is built up by a polyanionic framework of six&#8208;membered rings of corner&#8208;sharing InP4 tetrahedra. As a result, the newly designed semiconductors with direct band gaps are suitable for optoelectronic applications, and they can provide significant guidance for the design of new functional semiconductors.

         <title>Towards Amplified Probing of Weak Intermolecular Interactions on the External Surfaces of Molecular Capsules</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly sensitive equilibria between homo&#8208; and heterodimeric capsular complexes reveal unexpected variations in the aryl&#8208;aryl interactions of eight benzoyl fragments grouped in four tight pairs on the outer surfaces of the capsules.







Abstract
We report a sensitive method for comparing weak interactions between aryl rings located on the external surfaces of equilibrating homo&#8208; and heterodimeric capsules. Two identical self&#8208;complementary resorcin[4]arene tetrabenzoate molecules and one tetramethylammonium cation form in CDCl3 hydrogen&#8208;bonded homodimeric capsules whose exteriors are decorated with four tight pairs of weakly interacting aryl rings. The pair wise mixing of six different homodimers establishes their equilibria with the corresponding heterodimeric species in which two types of aryl rings exert on each other some gentle forces. This equilibrium is significantly shifted either towards homo&#8208; or heterodimers depending on the nature and location of the substituents in the weakly interacting aryl rings. The thermodynamic favorability or disadvantage of the heterodimerization is determined by stronger or weaker aryl&#8208;aryl attractions in the hetero&#8208; or homodimeric capsules, respectively. The four&#8208;fold amplification of weak aryl&#8208;aryl interactions on the external surfaces of the equilibrating capsules is responsible for high sensitiveness of our approach.

         <title>Signal Transduction Allows Temporal Control of the Potential of a Concentration Cell Driven by the Decarboxylation of an Activated Carboxylic Acid</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Time&#8208;controlled pH variations enabled by the decarboxylation of nitroacetic acid are transduced into time&#8208;controlled voltage variations. Such variations are exploited to govern the operation of simple electric devices.







Abstract
The use of Activated Carboxylic Acids (ACAs) allows the time&#8208;controlled operation of dissipative chemical systems based on the acid&#8208;base reaction by providing both the stimulus that temporarily drives a physicochemical change and, subsequently, the counter&#8208;stimulus with a single reagent addition. However, their application is inherently limited to acid&#8208;sensitive systems. To overcome this limitation, we herein develop a straightforward device for the transduction of the acid&#8208;base stimuli delivered by an ACA into a voltage signal that, in turn, is used to control voltage&#8208;sensitive circuits that are not pH&#8208;responsive by themselves. The signal transductor can be easily assembled from common laboratory equipment and employs aqueous solutions of readily available chemicals. Furthermore, the operator can simply and intuitively tune the amplitude of the voltage signal, as well as its duration and offset by varying the concentration of the chemical species involved in the transduction process.

         <title>Synthesis and Identification of decarbamoyloxySaxitoxins in Toxic Microalgae and their Reactions with the Oxygenase, SxtT, Reveal Saxitoxin Biosynthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
decarbamoyloxySaxitoxins (doSTXs), dd&#8208;doSTX (2), 12&#946;&#8208;deoxy&#8208;doSTX (3), 12&#945;&#8208;deoxy&#8208;doSTX (4) and doSTX (5) were synthesized, and 2, 3, and 5 were identified in the toxin&#8208;producing marine dinoflagellates and a freshwater cyanobacterium. In addition, conversion of 2 to 3, and 4 to 5 by SxtT with VanB was confirmed. These results support that 2 is a biosynthetic precursor of STX (1), and that ring and side&#8208;chain hydroxylation proceed after cyclization in STX biosynthesis.







Abstract
Saxitoxin (STX, 1) is a representative compound of paralytic shellfish toxins (PSTs) that are produced by marine dinoflagellates and freshwater cyanobacteria. Although several pathways have been proposed for the biosynthesis of STX, the order of ring and side chain hydroxylation, and formation of the tricyclic skeleton have not been well established. In this study, 12,12&#8208;dideoxy&#8208;decarbamoyloxySTX (dd&#8208;doSTX, 2), the most reduced STX analogue having the tricyclic skeleton, and its analogues, 12&#946;&#8208;deoxy&#8208;doSTX (12&#946;&#8208;d&#8208;doSTX, 3), 12&#945;&#8208;deoxy&#8208;doSTX (12&#945;&#8208;d&#8208;doSTX, 4), and doSTX (5), were synthesized, and these compounds were screened in the toxic microalgae using high&#8208;resolution LCMSMS. dd&#8208;doSTX (2) and 12&#946;&#8208;d&#8208;doSTX (3) were identified in the PSTs&#8208;producing dinoflagellates (Alexandrium catenella, A. pacificum, and/or Gymnodinium catenatum) and in the cyanobacterium Dolichospermum circinale (TA04). doSTX (5), previously isolated from the dinoflagellate G. catenatum, was also identified in D. circinale (TA04). Furthermore, the conversion of 2 to 3, and 4 to 5, by SxtT with VanB, a reported Rieske oxygenase and its redox partner in STX biosynthesis, was confirmed. These results support that 2 is a possible biosynthetic precursor of STX, and that ring and side&#8208;chain hydroxylations proceed after cyclization.

         <title>Sterically Congested Protecting Group for a Boronyl Group in Iterative Aminations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reaction of &#945;&#8208;hydroxycarboxamide and aryl boronic acid produces aryl&#8208;oxazaborolidinone (Ar&#8208;OxB). In Ar&#8208;OxB, the &#945;&#8208;hydroxycarboxamide&#8208;moiety was found to be a good protecting group for the boronyl group. This Ar&#8208;OxB is effective for Iterative aminations including Chan&#8208;Evans&#8208;Lam couplings.







Abstract
In this study, we found that the sterically bulky &#945;&#8208;hydroxycarboxamide moiety is a suitable framework for protecting the boronyl group of boron reagents during aminations. Condensation of &#945;&#8208;hydroxycarboxamide with ArB(OH)2 produced aryloxazaborolidinone (ArOxB). The reactivity of the C&#8208;B bond in ArOxB is easily controlled by the steric and weak electronic effects of the backbone. H2N&#8208;(or Br&#8722;)ArOxB underwent Chan&#8208;Evans&#8208;Lam (C&#8208;E&#8208;L) or Buchwald&#8208;Hartwig (B&#8208;H) amination with retaining the C&#8722;B bond. On the other hand, direct C&#8208;E&#8208;L amination of ArOxB was also possible in an oxidative atmosphere, in which the C&#8722;B bond was activated by CuII species. Our methodology is effective for the precise synthesis of two or more arylamino group substituted arenes.

         <title>Targeting the Antifungal Activity of Carbon Dots against Candida albicans Biofilm Formation by Tailoring Their Surface Functional Groups</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three classes of Carbon Dots with different composition and charged surfaces were prepared and completely characterised with regards to their morphology and physicochemical properties. We demonstrate the requirement of a positively&#8208;charged surface to exert antibiofilm formation by C. albicans paired with anti&#8208;adhesion and internalization properties, and with a mortality reduction of infected larvae in in&#8197;vivo tests.







Abstract
Carbon dots (CDs) are an emerging class of carbon nanoparticles, which for their characteristics have found applications in many fields such as catalysis, materials and biomedicine. Within this context, the application of CDs as antibacterial agents has received much attention in very recent years, while their use as antifungal nanoparticles has been scarcely investigated. Here we report a systematic investigation of the surface functional groups of CDs to study their influence on these nanoparticles&#8217; against Candida albicans. Three classes of CDs have been synthesised and fully characterized. A thorough in&#8197;vitro and in&#8197;vivo biological screening against C. albicans was performed to test their antifungal, antiadhesion and antibiofilm formation activities. Moreover, the interaction with C. albicans cells was investigated by microscopic analysis. Our results evidence how the presence of a positively polarised surface results crucial for the internalization into COS&#8208;7 cells. Positively charged nanoparticles were also able to inhibit adhesion and biofilm formation, to interact with the cellular membrane of C. albicans, and to increase the survival of G. mellonella infected larvae after the injection with positive nanoparticles. The antifungal activity of CDs and their extremely low toxicity may represent a new strategy to combat infections sustained by C.albicans.

         <title>Computational study into the oxidative ring&#8208;closure mechanism during the biosynthesis of deoxypodophyllotoxin</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The nonheme iron dioxygenase deoxypodophyllotoxin synthase performs an oxidative ring&#8208;closure reaction as part of natural product synthesis in plants. How the enzyme enables the oxidative ring&#8208;closure reaction of (&#8208;)&#8208;yatein and avoids substrate hydroxylation remains unknown. To gain insight into the reaction mechanism and understand the details of the pathways leading to products and byproducts we performed a comprehensive computational study. The work shows that substrate is bound tightly into the substrate binding pocket with the C7&#8217;&#8722;H bond closest to the iron(IV)&#8208;oxo species. The reaction proceeds with hydrogen atom abstraction from the C7&#8217;&#8722;H position followed by ring&#8208;closure and a final hydrogen transfer to form iron(II)&#8208;water and deoxypodophyllotoxin. Alternative mechanisms including substrate hydroxylation and an electron transfer pathway were explored but found to be higher in energy. The mechanism is guided by electrostatic perturbations of charged residues in the second&#8208;coordination sphere that prevent alternative pathways.</dc:description>

         <title>Molecular Dihydrogen Activation by (C5Me5)M/N (M = Rh, Ir) Transition Metal Frustrated Lewis Pairs: Reversible Proton Migration to, and Proton Abstraction from, the C5Me5 Ligand</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The masked transition&#8208;metal frustrated Lewis pairs [Cp*M(&#954;3N,N&#8217;,N&#8217;&#8217;&#8208;L)][SbF6] (Cp* = &#951;5&#8208;C5Me5; M = Ir, 1, Rh, 2; HL = pyridinyl&#8208;amidine ligand) reversibly activate H2 under mild conditions rendering the hydrido derivatives [Cp*MH(&#954;2N,N&#8217;&#8208;HL)][SbF6] observed as a mixture of the E and Z isomers at the amidine C=N bond (M = Ir, 3Z, 3E; M = Rh, 4Z, 4E).

         <title>Highly Ordered Co&#8208;Assembly of Bisurea Functionalized Molecular Switches at the Solid&#8208;Liquid Interface</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report on the design, synthesis, and scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) characterization of physisorbed monolayers of overcrowded alkene photoswitches physisorbed at the solid&#8208;liquid interface.







Abstract
Immobilization of stimulus&#8208;responsive systems on solid surfaces is beneficial for controlled signal transmission and adaptive behavior while allowing the characterization of the functional interface with high sensitivity and high spatial resolution. Positioning of the stimuli&#8208;responsive units with nanometer&#8208;scale precision across the adaptive surface remains one of the bottlenecks in the extraction of cooperative function. Nanoscale organization, cooperativity, and amplification remain key challenges in bridging the molecular and the macroscopic worlds. Here we report on the design, synthesis, and scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) characterization of overcrowded alkene photoswitches merged in self&#8208;assembled networks physisorbed at the solid&#8208;liquid interface. A detailed anchoring strategy that ensures appropriate orientation of the switches with respect to the solid surface through the use of bis&#8208;urea groups is presented. We implement a co&#8208;assembly strategy that enables the merging of the photoswitches within physisorbed monolayers of structurally similar &#8216;spacer&#8217; molecules. The self&#8208;assembly of the individual components and the co&#8208;assemblies was examined in detail using (sub)molecular resolution STM which confirms the robust immobilization and controlled orientation of the photoswitches within the spacer monolayers. The experimental STM data is supported by detailed molecular mechanics (MM) simulations. Different designs of the switches and the spacers were investigated which allowed us to formulate guidelines that enable the precise organization of the photoswitches in crystalline physisorbed self&#8208;assembled molecular networks.

         <title>Photochemical Synthesis of Lactones, Cyclopropanes and ATRA&#450;&#160;Products: Revealing the Role of Sodium Ascorbate</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Light&#8208;mediated processes have received significant attention, since they have re&#8208;surfaced unconventional reactivity platforms, complementary to conventional polar chemistry. &#947;&#8208;Lactones and cyclopropanes are prevalent moieties, found in numerous natural products and pharmaceuticals. Among various methods for their synthesis, light&#8208;mediated protocols are coming to the spotlight, although these are contingent upon the use of photoorgano&#8208; or metal&#8208;based catalysts. Herein, we introduce a novel photochemical activation of iodo&#8208;reagents via the use of cheap sodium ascorbate or ascorbic acid to enable their homolytic scission and addition onto double bonds. The developed protocol was applied successfully to the formal [3+2] cycloaddition for the synthesis of &#947;&#8208;lactones, traditional atom transfer radical addition (ATRA) reactions and the one&#8208;pot two&#8208;step conversion of alkenes to cyclopropanes. In all cases, the desired products were obtained in good to high yields, while the reaction mechanism was thoroughly investigated. Depending on the nature of the iodo&#8208;reagent, a halogen or a hydrogen&#8208;bonded complex is formed, which initiates the process.</dc:description>

         <title>Continuous isomerisation of 2,5&#8208;dimethylfuran to 2,4&#8208;dimethylfuran over Ga&#8208;silicate</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>2,4&#8208;dimethylfuran has a rare disubstitution pattern in the five&#8208;membered heterocyclic furan ring that is highly interesting chemically but challenging to access synthetically. We present a heterogeneously catalysed route to synthesise 2,4&#8208;dimethylfuran from commonly available 2,5&#8208;dimethylfuran using a zeolite packed&#8208;bed flow reactor. As supported by DFT calculations, the reaction occurs inside the zeolite channels, where the acid sites catalyse proton transfer followed by migration of a methyl group. The zeotype Ga&#8208;silicate (MFI type) appears superior to an aluminium&#8208;containing ZSM&#8208;5 by demonstrating higher selectivities and slower catalyst deactivation. This work provides new opportunities&#160;for the continuous valorisation of bio&#8208;feedstock molecules in the perspective of the emerging biorefinery era.</dc:description>

         <title>A Versatile, Functional Group&#8208;Tolerant, and Bench&#8208;Stable Iron Precatalyst for Building Arene and Triazine Rings by [2+2+2] Cycloadditions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report an efficient iron&#8208;catalyzed cycloaddition procedure leading to the construction of (hetero)aromatic rings by alkyne [2+2+2] cycloisomerization. This method relies on the use of an air&#8208;stable (N,N)Fe(II) precursor easily prepared from a commercially available ligand derived from 1,10&#8208;phenanthroline, reduced in situ into a catalytically active non&#8208;innocent (N,N&#9679;&#8211;)2Fe(II) species. This system displays a large scope application, operates under mild conditions and at low catalytic charges (25 cycloadducts formed, up to 1.5 mol% catalyst). Moreover, this method also enables access to 29 cycloadducts by cross&#8208;cycloisomerization between 1,6&#8208; or 1,7&#8208;diynes and alkynes in near&#8208;equimolar conditions. 1,3,5&#8208;Triazines can also be prepared with this procedure starting from the corresponding cyanamides. Scale&#8208;up reactions and post&#8208;functionalization of several cycloadducts also show that this [2+2+2] cycloaddition can be used in multistep sequences.</dc:description>

         <title>Exploring the Theoretical Foundations of Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence (TADF) Emission: A Comprehensive TD&#8208;DFT Study on Phenothiazine Systems</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This study conducts a thorough theoretical investigation of Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence (TADF) in phenothiazine&#8208;based systems, examining ten molecular configurations recognized experimentally as TADF&#8208;active. Employing Time&#8208;Dependent Density Functional Theory (TD&#8208;DFT), our analysis spans the investigation of singlet&#8208;triplet energy gaps ($\Delta E_{ST}$), spin&#8208;orbit coupling, and excitation characteristics using Multiwfn. This approach validates the adherence to El Sayed's rule across these systems but also provides a detailed understanding of charge transfer dynamics, as visualized through heat maps. A significant aspect of our study is the exploration of different oxidation states of sulfur and site substitutions on phenothiazine. This systematic variation aims to identify additional TADF&#8208;active compounds, drawing parallels with properties characterizing other known TADF emitters. Our investigation into Reverse Intersystem Crossing (rISC) rates and the analysis of dihedral angles in relation to $\Delta E_{ST}$ values offer nuanced insights into the TADF behaviours of these molecules.&#160; By integrating rigorous computational analysis, we provide a foundational understanding that enhances the design and optimization of phenothiazine&#8208;based materials for optoelectronic applications. This work not only advances our theoretical understanding of TADF in phenothiazine derivatives but also serves as a guide for experimentalists and industry professionals in the strategic design of new TADF materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Influence Mechanism of Interfacial Oxidation of Li3YCl6 Solid Electrolyte on Reduction Potential</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Halide&#8208;based solid electrolytes are promising candidates for all solid&#8208;state lithium&#8208;ion batteries (ASSLBs) due to their high ionic conductivity, wide electrochemical window, and excellent chemical stability with cathode materials. However, when tested in practice, their intrinsic electrochemical stability windows do not well match the conditions for stable operation of ASSBs. Existing literature reports halide&#8208;based ASSBs that still operate well outside the electrochemical stability window, while ASSBs that do not operate within the window are not well studied or the studies are based on the cathode material interface. In this study, we aim to elucidate the mechanism behind all&#8208;solid&#8208;state battery failure by investigating how the reduction potential of Li3YCl6 solid&#8208;state electrolyte itself changes under overcharging conditions. Our findings demonstrate that in Li&#8208;In|Li3YCl6|Li3YCl6&#8208;C half&#8208;cells during the first state of charge, Cl ions participate in charge compensation, resulting in a depletion of ligands. This phenomenon significantly affects the reduction potential of Y3+, causing it to be reduced to Y2Cl3 and ultimately to Y0 at conditions far exceeding its actual reduction potential. Furthermore, we analyze the interfacial impedance induced by this process and propose a novel perspective on battery failure.</dc:description>

         <title>Near&#8208;IR&#8208;Absorbing Bis&#8208;Donor Functionalized Aza&#8208;BODIPY Derivatives: Synthesis and Photophysical Study by Using Transient Optical Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A series of near&#8208;IR absorbing 2,6&#8208;diarylated BF2&#8208;chelated aza&#8208;boron&#8208;dipyrromethenes (aza&#8208;BDPs) derivatives bearing different electron donors (Benzene, naphthalene, phenanthrene, phenothiazine and carbazole) were designed and synthesized. The effect of different electron donor substitutions on the photophysical properties was studied by steady&#8208;state UV&#8208;vis absorption and fluorescence spectra, electrochemical, time&#8208;resolved nanosecond transient absorption (ns&#8208;TA) spectroscopy and theoretical computations. The UV&#8722;vis absorption spectra of AzaBDP&#8208;PTZ and AzaBDP&#8208;CAR (&#955;abs = 710 nm in toluene) showed a bathochromic absorption profile compared with the reference AzaBDP&#8208;Ph (&#955;abs = 685 nm in toluene), indicating the non&#8208;negligible electronic interaction at the ground state between donor and acceptor moieties. Moreover, the fluorescence is almost completely quenched for AzaBDP&#8208;PTZ/AzaBDP&#8208;CAR (fluorescence quantum yield, &#934;F = 0.2&#8722;0.7% in toluene) as compared with the AzaBDP&#8208;Ph (&#934;F = 27% in toluene). However, the apparent intersystem crossing ability of these compounds is poor, based on the singlet oxygen quantum yield (&#934;&#916; = 0.3&#8722;1.5%). The ns&#8208;TA spectral study showed typical Bodipy localized triplet state transient features, short&#8208;lived excited triplet state for AzaBDP&#8208;Ph (&#964;T = 53.2 &#956;s) versus significantly long&#8208;lived triplet state for AzaBDP&#8208;CAR (&#964;T = 114 &#956;s) was observed under deaerated experimental conditions. &#160;These information are useful for molecular structure design of triplet photosensitizers.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic molecules containing fluorine and sulfur atoms represent a large percentage of approved pharmaceuticals. Those with combination of both S and F atoms in their structure such as Xtandi, approved in 2012 for prostate cancer, indicates the importance of synthetic methods that accommodates both atoms in an organic moiety. In this study, a novel aspect of sulfoxonium ylide reactivity was explored, unveiling a streamlined and mild synthesis method for gem&#8208;difluorinated keto&#8208;sulfoxides. Our protocol offers a direct and practical approach to prepare these compounds in 14&#8208;80% chemical yields, that were represented by 21 examples. NMR studies and Hammett correlations gave strong evidence about the mechanism of this transformation.</dc:description>

         <title>Development of Receptor for Advanced Glycation End Products (RAGE) ligands through target directed dynamic combinatorial chemistry: a novel class of possible antagonists</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>RAGE is a transmembrane receptor of immunoglobulin family that can bind various endogenous and exogenous ligands, initiating the inflammatory downstream signaling pathways, including inflammaging. Therefore, RAGE represents an attractive drug target for age&#8208;related diseases. For the development of small&#8208;molecule RAGE antagonists, we employed protein&#8208;templated dynamic combinatorial chemistry (ptDCC) using RAGE's VC1 domain as a template, the first application of this approach in the context of RAGE. The affinities of DCC hits were validated using microscale thermophoresis. Subsequent screening against AGE2 (glyceraldehyde&#8208;modified AGE)&#8208;sRAGE (solubleRAGE) (AGE2&#8208;BSA/sRAGE) interaction using ELISA tests led to the identification of antagonists with micromolar potency. Our findings not only demonstrate the successful application of ptDCC on RAGE but also highlight its potential to address the pressing need for alternative strategies for the development of small&#8208;molecule RAGE antagonists, an area of research that has experienced a slowdown in recent years.</dc:description>

         <title>Electronic Structure Analysis of the&#160;A10Tt2P6 System (A&#160;=&#160;Li &#8208; Cs; Tt&#160;=&#160;Si, Ge, Sn)&#160;and Synthesis of the Direct Band Gap Semiconductor K10Sn2P6</title>

         <dc:description>Investigating the relationship between atomic and electronic structures is a powerful tool to screen the wide variety of Zintl phases for interesting optoelectronic properties. To get an insight in such relations, the A10Tt2P6 system (A=Li&#8208;Cs; Tt=Si&#8208;Sn) was picked as model system to analyse the influence of structural motives, combination of elements and their properties on type and width of the band gaps. Those compounds comprise two interesting structural motives of their anions, which are either monomeric trigonal planar TtP35&#8208; units which are isostructural to CO32&#8208;&#160;&#160;or [Tt2P6]10&#8208; dimers which correspond to two edge&#8208;sharing TtP4 tetrahedra. The A10Tt2P6 compounds were structurally optimized for both polymorphs and subsequent frequency analysis, band structure as well as density of states calculations were performed. The Gibbs free energies were compared to determine temperature dependent stability, where Na10Si2P6, Na10Ge2P6 and K10Sn2P6 were found to be candidates for a high temperature phase transition between the two polymorphs. Additionally, the unknown, but predicted compound K10Sn2P6 was synthesized and characterized by single crystal and powder x&#8208;ray diffraction. It crystalizes in the monoclinic space group P21/n and incorporates [Sn2P6]10&#8208; edge sharing double tetrahedra. It was determined to be a direct band gap semiconductor with a band gap of 2.57eV.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Linearly fused polycyclic piperidines represent common substructures in natural products and biologically active small molecules. We have devised a Pd&#8208;catalyzed annulation strategy to these compounds that converts readily available 2&#8208;tetralones and indanones into these scaffolds with the potential for control of both enantio&#8208; and diastereoselectivity.

         <title>Mapping the Catalytic&#8208;Space for the Reactivity of Metal&#8208;free Boron Nitride with O2 for H2O&#8208;Mediated Conversion of Methane to HCHO and CO</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The h&#8208;BN surface catalyzes the partial oxidation of methane to formaldehyde and carbon monoxide in presence of dioxygen. The surface catalytic&#8208;space of h&#8208;BN for the methane oxidation is demonstrated with numerous pathways. Distortion/interaction and orbital analysis are utilized to rationalize the activation barriers. Water plays an intriguing role in HCHO and CO formation.







Abstract
Transition&#8208;metal based catalysts have been widely employed to catalyze partial oxidation of light alkanes. Recently, metal&#8208;free hexagonal&#8208;boron nitride (h&#8208;BN) has emerged as a promising catalyst for the oxidation of CH4 to HCHO and CO; however, the intricate catalytic surface of h&#8208;BN at molecular and electronic levels remains inadequately understood. Key questions include how electron&#8208;deficient boron atoms in h&#8208;BN reduce O2, and whether the partial oxidation of methane over h&#8208;BN exhibits similarities to traditional transition&#8208;metal catalysts. In our study, we computationally&#8208;mapped in&#8208;detail the surface catalytic&#8208;space of h&#8208;BN for methane oxidation. We considered different structures of h&#8208;BN and show that these structures contain numerous sites for O2 binding and therefore various routes for methane oxidation are possible. The activation barriers for methane oxidation via various paths varies from ~83 to ~123&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1. To comprehend the differences in activation barriers, we employed geometrical, orbital and distortion/interaction analysis (DIA). Orbital analysis reveals that methane activation over h&#8208;BN in presence of dioxygen follows a standard hydrogen atom transfer mechanism. It is also shown that water plays an intriguing role in reducing the barrier for HCHO and CO formation by acting as a bridge.

         <title>An Efficient C&#8722;Si/C&#8722;H Cross&#8208;Coupling Reaction Enabled by a Radical Pathway</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The aryl radical from sulfonium salts have been generated through copper&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed processes, which enable the successful biaryl transformation through the addition to the aryl(trialkyl)silanes for the first time. Given the fast development in the copper catalysis, this method is expected to present new opportunities for exploring aryl(trialkyl)silanes in biaryl synthesis.







Abstract
The methods for the cross&#8208;coupling of aryl(trialkyl)silanes are long&#8208;standing challenges due to the extreme inertness of C&#8722;Si(R3) bond, though the reaction is environmentally friendly and highly regioselective to synthesize biaryls. Herein, we report a copper&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling of aryl(trialkyl)silanes and aryl via a radical mechanism. The reaction proceeds efficiently with aryl sulfonium salts as limiting reagents, exhibits broad substrate scope, and provides an important synthetic strategy to acquire biaryls, exemplified by unsymmetrical fluorescence probes and late&#8208;stage functionalization of drugs. Of note, the experimental and theoretical mechanistic studies revealed a radical mechanism where the copper catalyst and CsF play critical roles on the radical generation and desilylation process.

         <title>Binding of Acetylated Lysine by Using a Water Soluble Aryl Extended Calix[4]pyrrole</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The selective molecular recognition properties of two different calix[4]pyrrole receptors toward the cis isomer of acetylated lysine (cis&#8208;Kac) are investigated. The formation of a 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 complex is favoured for the aryl&#8208;extended receptor compared to the superaryl&#8208;extended featuring a deeper cavity for which the energetically not favourable desolvation of the aminoacidic group hampers the guest inclusion in the hydrophobic cavity.







Abstract
Post&#8208;translational modifications of lysine in histones, as methylation and acetylation, have well established functions in epigenetics and are emerging as important actors in broader biological regulation. Currently, the detection of acetylated lysine (Kac) in water solution as free amino acid or protein residue remains challenging. Acetylated lysine is a neutral amino acid, and the lack of ion&#8211;dipole interactions causes the decrease in binding affinity displayed by synthetic molecular receptors with respect to the other lysine modifications. Here, we report molecular modeling calculations and 1H&#8197;NMR experiments to investigate the binding properties of two different calix[4]pyrrole receptors towards Kac. Computational analyses reveal that tetra&#8208;aryl&#8208;extended calix[4]pyrrole (1) preferentially binds the cis&#8208;Kac conformer over the trans one due to steric considerations and more favorable interactions. Experimental 1H&#8197;NMR titration experiments confirm the formation of a 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 complex between receptor&#8197;1 and cis&#8208;Kac, with a Ka exceeding 103&#8197;M&#8722;1. Conversely, the super&#8208;aryl&#8208;extended calix[4]pyrrole 2 is less efficient in binding Kac, due to unfavorable solvation/desolvation effects, as proven by 1H&#8197;NMR experiments. Moreover, receptor&#8197;1 showed a higher affinity for Kac over other lysine modifications, such as methylated lysines.

Here, we report molecular modeling calculations and &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H&#8197;NMR experiments to investigate the binding properties of two different calix[4]pyrrole receptors towards &lt;b&gt;Kac&lt;/b&gt;. Computational analyses reveal that tetra-aryl-extended calix[4]pyrrole (&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;) preferentially binds the &lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt;-&lt;b&gt;Kac&lt;/b&gt; conformer over the &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt; one due to steric considerations and more favorable interactions. Experimental &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H&#8197;NMR titration experiments confirm the formation of a 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 complex between receptor&#8197;&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt;-&lt;b&gt;Kac&lt;/b&gt;, with a K&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; exceeding 10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&#8197;M&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. Conversely, the super-aryl-extended calix[4]pyrrole &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt; is less efficient in binding &lt;b&gt;Kac&lt;/b&gt;, due to unfavorable solvation/desolvation effects, as proven by &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H&#8197;NMR experiments. Moreover, receptor&#8197;&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; showed a higher affinity for &lt;b&gt;Kac&lt;/b&gt; over other lysine modifications, such as methylated lysines.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>The Origin of Dual&#8208;Emission in PLICT Compounds &#8211; an Empirical Approach</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dual&#8208;emitting PLICT compounds based on cyano&#8208;1&#8208;aminoindole structures and exploration of their fluorescence behavior are presented. Combination of experimental studies, theoretical calculations, and a unique fluorophore cataloging map allows for the easy determination of the origin of fluorescence bands.







Abstract
Fluorescence spectroscopy proves to be a powerful and versatile tool in scientific research, demanding ongoing advancements of fluorescence probes to cater to a broad range of applications. The particular interest lies in the development of fluorophores with multiplexing capability, emitting from more than one excited state depending on the polarity and viscosity of the surrounding medium. Here, we present a variety of novel dual planarized intramolecular charge transfer (PLICT) emitters based on cyano&#8208;1&#8208;aminoindole structures. We have chosen a combination of experimental studies, theoretical calculations and the creation of a unique fluorophore cataloging map. This map serves as a useful tool for empirically determining the origin of both fluorescence bands.

         <title>Transport Properties with Multiple Functions of Fe@C60&#8208;GNR Single Molecule</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The transport properties of a series of double&#8208;layered Fe@C60&#8208;GNR devices have been designed. It gives deep insight into the experimental discoveries, and provides theoretical guidance for optimizing the transport properties of the Fe@C60&#8208;GNR devices.







Abstract
Encouraged by the successful fabrication of C60&#8208;GNR (GNR=graphene nanoribbon) single&#8208;molecule transistors in experiments, four Fe&#8208;containing derived double&#8208;layered devices of Fe@C60&#8208;GNR are designed by employing different electrode linkages and their transport properties are investigated by using density functional theory (DFT) and nonequilibrium Green's function (NEGF) methods. Regardless of electrode connection, all these devices give rise to a smaller negative differential resistance (NDR) peak at V=0.2 and a higher peak at 1.2&#8197;V, suggesting their stable maneuverability as molecular devices and good candidates for developing on(off)&#8208;off(on)&#8208;on(off) current switches. The macroscopic NDR performance depends on the delocalization character and the crossing mechanism of the frontier orbitals. The peak&#8208;to&#8208;valley current ratios (Rmax) range from 454 to 2737, determined by the electrode linkage. Such a large Rmax&#8208;value is necessary for developing dynamic random&#8208;access memory (DRAM) cells. Encapsulating the Fe atom inside C60 not only improves the conductivity but also introduces the spin&#8208;polarized transport property. The spin&#8208;filtering efficiency (SFE) of almost all devices oscillates up and down in response to the bias voltage, indicating the possibility of designing on(off)&#8208;off(on)&#8208;on(off) spin switches and up&#8208;down spin switches. All these fascinating properties provide an important clue for designing similar molecular devices with multiple functions by trapping magnetic transition metal atoms inside fullerenes.

         <title>A Nanoplatform Based on Pillar[5]arene Nanovalves for Combined Drug Delivery and Enhanced Antitumor Activity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pillar[5]arene&#8208;based nanovalves improved drug loading capacity and endowed the nanoplatforms with dual pH/light responsiveness. The loaded DOX and GOx successfully achieved combined chemo/starvation cancer therapy with better tumor suppression compared to single chemotherapy, providing a new approach for cancer treatment.







Abstract
Modern nanodrug delivery technologies offer new approaches in the fight against cancer. However, due to the heterogeneity of tumors and side effects of anticancer drugs, monotherapies are less effective. Herein, we report a novel pH and light dual&#8208;responsive nanodrug delivery platform. The platform was formed by sulfonate&#8208;modified gold nanoparticles loaded with the anticancer drugs doxorubicin (DOX) and glucose oxidase (GOx) and then covered by water&#8208;soluble pillar[5]arene as a nanovalve. The nanovalve formed by the host&#8208;guest interaction between pillar[5]arene and the sulfonic acid group grafted onto the gold nanoparticle increased the drug loading capacity of the nanoplatform and enabled sustained release of the drug in a simulated weakly acidic tumor environment. The released GOx can consume intracellular glucose, namely, starvation therapy, while the generated hydrogen peroxide can further kill tumor cells, complementing DOX chemotherapy. Gold nanoparticles have good photothermal conversion ability and can enhance the drugs release rate under specific wavelengths of light irradiation. The results of in&#8197;vitro and in&#8197;vivo experiments showed that this novel nanodrug delivery platform has good biocompatibility and better therapeutic efficacy relative to monotherapy. This study successfully developed a combined chemo/starvation therapy strategy with good tumor suppression, providing a new approach for cancer treatment.

         <title>Kinetic Resolution of Secondary Alcohols Catalyzed at the Exterior of Chiral Coordinated Capsules</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The confinement of the chiral space inside a molecular host is an ideal platform for enantioselective reactions. However, this concept significantly limits the scope of reactants because reactants must be trapped inside molecular hosts. Instead, we utilized the exteriors of chiral molecular capsules as chiral sources and realized the kinetic resolution of secondary alcohols.







Abstract
Confined spaces inside molecular hosts can function as reaction vessels. However, this concept significantly limits the scope of reactants. When the exterior of molecular hosts is used instead, we can ease the restriction because reactants are not necessary to be trapped inside molecular hosts, although studies along this line have not been reported. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept of enantioselective reactions at the exterior of chiral molecular hosts, we utilized host&#8208;guest complexes of enantiomerically enriched Cu&#8208;coordinated capsules and guests possessing a catalytic center to realize the kinetic resolution of secondary alcohols. Under suitable reaction conditions, a selectivity factor of 2.6 was realized, demonstrating that the reactions occur at the exterior of the capsules. A series of experiments indicated that the substituents on the 2,2&#8217;&#8208;bipyridyl arms and the alkyl chains on the lower rim contributed to the enantioselectivity of the reactions.

         <title>Convergent Synthesis of the Nonreducing Hexasaccharide Fragment and the Dodecasaccharide Scaffold of Marine Lipopolysaccharide Axinelloside A</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A convergent synthesis of properly protected dodecasaccharide backbone of axinelloside A was accomplished by virtue of an Au(I)&#8208;catalyzed [6+6] glycosylation. The 1,2&#8208;cis configuration of the glycosidic bonds was well controlled by judicious choice of protecting groups as well as promotion conditions.







Abstract
A convergent synthesis of the dodecasaccharide scaffold of axinelloside A was achieved through Au(I)&#8208;catalyzed [6+6] glycosylation. The initially devised [3+1+2] assembly of the nonreducing hexasaccharide fragment was low&#8208;yielding, whereas a convergent [3+3] glycosylation under Au(I) catalysis was proven feasible, allowing for a semi&#8208;gram scale preparation of the wanted hexasaccharide. The requisite 1,2&#8208;cis glycosidic bonds were forged in a highly stereoselective fashion by virtue of remote acetyl group participation, and judicious manipulation of protecting groups. The synthetic dodecasaccharide has been properly protected for the downstream elaboration toward its natural form.

&lt;p&gt;A convergent synthesis of the dodecasaccharide scaffold of axinelloside A was achieved through Au(I)-catalyzed [6+6] glycosylation. The initially devised [3+1+2] assembly of the nonreducing hexasaccharide fragment was low-yielding, whereas a convergent [3+3] glycosylation under Au(I) catalysis was proven feasible, allowing for a semi-gram scale preparation of the wanted hexasaccharide. The requisite 1,2-&lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt; glycosidic bonds were forged in a highly stereoselective fashion by virtue of remote acetyl group participation, and judicious manipulation of protecting groups. The synthetic dodecasaccharide has been properly protected for the downstream elaboration toward its natural form.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Accessing Rare &#945;&#8208;Heterocyclic Aziridines via Br&#248;nsted Acid&#8208;catalyzed Michael Addition/Annulation: Scope, Limitations, and Mechanism</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report an approach to the diastereoselective synthesis of 1,2&#8208;disubstituted heterocyclic aziridines. A Br&#248;nsted acid&#8208;catalyzed conjugate addition of anilines to trisubstituted heterocyclic chloroalkenes provides an intermediate 1,2&#8208;chloroamine. Diastereocontrol was found to vary significantly with solvent selection, with computational modelling confirming selective, spontaneous fragmentation in the presence of trace acids, proceeding through a pseudo&#8208;cyclic, protonated intermediate and transition state. These chloroamines can then be converted to the aziridine by treatment with LiHMDS with high stereochemical fidelity. This solvent&#8208;induced stereochemical enrichment thereby enables an efficient route to rare cis&#8208;aziridines with high dr. The scope, limitations, and mechanistic origins of selectivity are also presented.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrochemical Dearomatizing Methoxylation of Phenols and Naphthols: Synthetic and Computational Studies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The electrochemical oxidative dearomatizing methoxylation of phenols and naphthols was developed. It provides an alternative route for the preparation of methoxycyclohexadienones, important and versatile synthetic intermediates, that eliminates the need for stoichiometric high&#8208;energy chemical oxidants and generates hydrogen as a sole by&#8208;product. The reaction proceeds in a simple constant current mode, in an undivided cell, and it employs standardized instrumentation. A collection of methoxycyclohexadienones derived from various 2,4,6&#8208;tri&#8208;substituted phenols and 1&#8208;substituted&#8208;2&#8208;naphthols was obtained in moderate to excellent yields. These include a complex derivative of estrone, as well as methoxylated dearomatized 1,1&#8242;&#8208;bi&#8208;2&#8208;naphthols (BINOLs). The mechanism of the reaction was subject to profound investigations using density functional theory calculations. In particular, the reactivity of two key intermediates, phenoxyl radical and phenoxenium ion, was carefully examined. The obtained results shed light on the pathway leading to the desired product and rationalize experimentally observed selectivities regarding a side benzylic methoxylation and the preference for the functionalization at the para over the ortho position. They also uncover the structure&#8208;selectivity relationship, inversely correlating the steric bulk of the substrate with its propensity to undergo the side&#8208;reaction. Moreover, the loss of stereochemical information from enantiopure BINOL substrates during the reaction is rationalized by the computations.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>

While the variation of phosphine and NHC moieties led to inferior results than for a parent system, the incorporation of a phenyl substituent into the ligand methylene bridge improved catalytic performance by ca. 3 times providing maximal TON values in the range of 15000&#8208;20000.

         <title>A Simple Manganese(I) Catalyst for the Efficient and Selective Hydrophosphination of Olefins with PH3, Primary, and Secondary Phosphanes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A tridentate ligand L with a P,NH,N donor motif was synthesized in few steps from commercially available precursors. Upon reaction with [MnBr(CO)5], an octahedral 18&#8208;electron complex [Mn(CO)3(L)]Br (1) is obtained in which L adopts a facial arrangement. Deprotonation of the NH group leads under loss of CO to a neutral Mn(I) amide complex [Mn(CO)2(L&#8208;H)] (2), which has a trigonal bipyramidal structure with the P and N donor centers are in trans position. Further deprotonation of 2 gives the deep&#8208;blue anion [Mn(CO)2(L&#8208;2H)]&#8208; (3). DFT calculations and QTAIM analyses show that 2 contains a Mn&#8211;N bond with partial double bond character and 3 an aromatic MnN2C2 ring. The anion [Mn(CO)2(L&#8208;2H)]&#8208; reacts with Ph2PH to give a phosphido complex, which serves as phosphide transfer reagent to activated olefins with low catalytic activity. However, the neutral amide complex 2 is an excellent catalyst and with 0.04 mol%, turn over frequencies of &gt;40&#8217;000 h&#8209;1 can be achieved. Furthermore, secondary and primary alkyl phosphines as well as PH3 can be added in a catalytic hydrophosphination reaction to a wide range of activated olefins such as &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated aldehydes, ketones, esters, and nitriles.

Upon reaction with [MnBr(CO)5], an octahedral 18-electron complex [Mn(CO)3(L)]Br (1) is obtained in which L adopts a facial arrangement. Deprotonation of the NH group leads under loss of CO to a neutral Mn(I) amide complex [Mn(CO)2(L-H)] (2), which has a trigonal bipyramidal structure with the P and N donor centers are in trans position. Further deprotonation of 2 gives the deep-blue anion [Mn(CO)2(L-2H)]- (3). DFT calculations and QTAIM analyses show that 2 contains a Mn&#8211;N bond with partial double bond character and 3 an aromatic MnN2C2 ring. The anion [Mn(CO)2(L-2H)]- reacts with Ph2PH to give a phosphido complex, which serves as phosphide transfer reagent to activated olefins with low catalytic activity. However, the neutral amide complex 2 is an excellent catalyst and with 0.04 mol%, turn over frequencies of &amp;gt;40&#8217;000 h&#8209;1 can be achieved. Furthermore, secondary and primary alkyl phosphines as well as PH3 can be added in a catalytic hydrophosphination reaction to a wide range of activated olefins such as &#945;,&#946;-unsaturated aldehydes, ketones, esters, and nitriles. But also, vinyl pyridine and some styrene derivatives are converted into the corresponding phosphanes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Silver&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Double Desymmetrization via Vinylogous Michael Addition of Prochiral &#945;,&#945;&#8208;Dicyanoalkenes to Cyclopentendiones</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An asymmetric double desymmetrization methodology has been developed for synthesizing densely functionalized chiral cyclopentylcyclohexane scaffolds. We have constructed four chiral centers, including an all&#8208;carbon quaternary stereocenter in a single C&#8208;C bond formation event. The methodology has high functional&#8208;group tolerance and delivers a broad range of enantioenriched products. This vinylogous Michael addition reaction of prochiral &#945;,&#945;&#8208;dicyanocyclohexane to 2,2&#8208;disubstituted cyclopentene&#8208;1,3&#8208;dione is catalyzed by a chiral Ag&#8208;(R)&#8208;DTBM&#8208;SEGPHOS catalyst.</dc:description>

         <title>Dansylated Nitrile N&#8208;Oxide as the Fluorescent Dye Clickable to Unsaturated Bonds without Catalyst</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fluorescent polymeric materials have been exploited in the fields of aesthetical purposes, biomedical engineering, and three&#8208;dimensional printing applications.&#160; While the fluorescent materials are prepared by the polymerization of fluorescent monomer or the blending a fluorescent dye with common polymer, the covalent immobilization of fluorescent dye onto common polymers is not the practical technique.&#160; In this paper, dansylated nitrile N&#8208;oxide (Dansyl&#8208;NO) has been designed and synthesized to be a stable nitrile N&#8208;oxide as the derivative of 2&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;1&#8208;naphthaldehyde.&#160; While Dansyl&#8208;NO shows good reactivity to an alkene and an alkyne to give fluorescent Dansyl&#8208;Ene and Dansyl&#8208;Yne, respectively, it hardly reacts to a nitrile.&#160; The results indicate that Dansyl&#8208;NO serves as a fluorescent dye clickable to alkenes and alkynes.&#160; To know the effects of solvent on the fluorescent properties, the UV&#8208;vis and fluorescence spectra of Dansyl&#8208;Ene are measured in three solvents.&#160; Dansyl&#8208;Ene shows fluorescent solvatochromism, which appears to be red&#8208;shifted along with the increase in solvent polarity.&#160; Poly(styrene&#8208;co&#8208;butadiene) directly reacts with Dansyl&#8208;NO to give fluorescent modified SB.&#160; The emission spectrum of modified SB is blue&#8208;shifted compared with that of Dansyl&#8208;Ene.&#160; The blue&#8208;shift could be possibly attributed to the presence of less polar polymer skeleton around the dansyl moieties of modified SB.</dc:description>

         <title>Molecular Dynamics of Steroidal Rotors Probed by Theoretical, Spectroscopic and Dielectric Methods</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Our study focuses on molecular rotors with fast&#8208;moving rotators and their potential applications in the development of new amphidynamic crystals. Steroidal molecular rotors with a dipolar fluorine&#8208;substituted phenyl group as the rotator were synthesized and characterized. Three different rotors were investigated with varying numbers of fluorine atoms. A comprehensive analysis was performed using vibrational spectroscopy (Raman, FT&#8208;IR), electronic circular dichroism (ECD), and dielectric response to understand the behavior of the investigated model rotors. The results were supported by theoretical calculations using Density Functional Theory (DFT) methods. The angle&#8208;dependent polarized Raman spectra confirmed the crystallinity of the samples. Nearly frequency and temperature&#8208;independent permittivity suggest low&#8208;frequency librational motion of stators. An in&#8208;depth analysis of ECD spectra revealed high conformational flexibility in solution, resulting in low ECD effects, while in the solid&#8208;state with restricted rotation, significant ECD effects were observed. These findings shed light on the conformational behavior and potential applications of the studied steroidal molecular rotors.</dc:description>

         <title>Structural Design of 3D Current Collectors for Lithium Metal Anodes: A Review</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Due to the ultrahigh theoretical specific capacity (3860 mAh g&#8208;1) and low redox potential (&#8208;3.04 V vs. standard hydrogen electrode), Lithium (Li) metal anode (LMA) received increasing attentions. However, notorious dendrite and volume expansion during the cycling process seriously hinder the development of high energy density Li metal batteries. Constructing three&#8208;dimensional (3D) current collectors for Li can fundamentally solve the intrinsic drawback of hostless for Li. Therefore, this review systematically introduces the design and synthesis engineering and the current development status of different 3D collectors in recent years (the current collectors are divided into two major parts: metal&#8208;based current collectors and carbon&#8208;based current collectors). In the end, some perspectives of the future promotion for LMA application are also presented.</dc:description>

         <title>In&#8722;situ  confining selenium within bubble&#8722;like carbon nanoshells for ultra&#8722;stable Li&#8722;Se batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lithium&#8208;selenium (Li&#8208;Se) batteries are promising energy storage devices. However, the long&#8208;term durability and high&#8208;rate performance of the Se cathode have been limited by significant volume expansion and the troublesome shuttle effect of polyselenides during repeated charging/discharging processes. To revolutionize these issues, we applied a top&#8208;down strategy through the in&#8208;situ trapping of amorphous Se within bubble&#8208;like carbon (BLC) frameworks, which can radically minimize the presence of surface&#8208;absorbed Se while enhancing Se loading capacity. This ingenious technique successfully encapsulates all Se species within carbon nanoshells, creating a distinct half&#8208;filled core&#8208;shell structure known as Se@void@BLC. This in&#8208;situ trapping approach ensures the efficient management of Se volume changes during repeated discharge and charge cycles. Moreover, an extraordinary Se loading capacity of up to 65.6wt% is reached. Using the Se@void@BLC as cathode for Li&#8722;Se battery, we achieve a high initial Columbic efficiency of 84.2%, a high reversible capacity of 585 mAh g&#8722;1, and an ultralow capacity decay of only 0.0037 % per cycle during 4000 cycles at 10 A g&#8722;1.</dc:description>

         <title>Azaphosphinate Dyes: A Low Molecular Weight Near&#8208;Infrared Scaffold for Development of Photoacoustic or Fluorescence Imaging Probes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present a new class of NIR dyes termed azaphosphinate NR dyes with desirable properties including low molecular weight, absorption/emission above 750&#8197;nm, and remarkable water solubility. Derivatives of these dyes can be used for photoacoustic or fluorescence imaging, providing a new NIR scaffold for the design of imaging probes.







Abstract
Near&#8208;infrared (NIR) dyes are desirable for biological imaging applications including photoacoustic (PA) and fluorescence imaging. Nonetheless, current NIR dyes are often plagued by relatively large molecular weights, poor water solubility, and limited photostability. Herein, we provide the first examples of azaphosphinate dyes which display desirable properties such as low molecular weight, absorption/emission above 750&#8197;nm, and remarkable water solubility. In PA imaging, an azaphosphinate dye exhibited a 4.1&#8208;fold enhancement in intensity compared to commonly used standards, the ability to multiplex with existing dyes in whole blood, imaging depths of 2.75&#8197;cm in a tissue model, and contrast in mice. An improved derivative for fluorescence imaging displayed a &gt;10&#8208;fold reduction in photobleaching in water compared to the FDA&#8208;approved indocyanine green dye and could be visualized in mice. This new dye class provides a robust scaffold for the development of photoacoustic or NIR fluorescence imaging agents.

         <title>Mn(II) Promoted Divergent&#8208;Convergent Domino Reaction Giving Dinuclear Tetrasubstituted Pyrrole Complex</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new domino reaction sequence has been realized between chelating heteroaryl methanamine and cheap and simple Mn(II) salt, leading to 2,3,4,5&#8208;tetrasubstituted pyrrole coordinated dinuclear Mn(II) complex. The reaction process has been studied and a six&#8208;step domino sequence involving the convergent [3+2] cycloaddition between imine and alkene/alkyne which were formed divergently from starting amine has been proposed.







Abstract
Domino reaction of benzo[d]thiazole&#8208;2&#8208;methylamine (S1) has been developed in the presence of MnCl2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;4H2O, leading to tetrasubstituted pyrrole coordinated dinuclear Mn(II) complex 1 ([MnClP]2, P&#8722;=2,3,4,5&#8208;tetrakis(benzo[d]thiazol&#8208;2&#8208;yl)pyrrol&#8208;1&#8208;ide). The reaction process has been studied by assigning a series of intermediates based on time&#8208;dependent mass spectrometry, control experiments, crystallography, and density functional theory (DFT) theoretical calculation. A plausible mechanism involving an unprecedented divergent&#8208;convergent domino sequence has been proposed. Compound S1 could be activated by MnCl2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;4H2O via coordination, which divergently produces two intermediates imine II (1&#8208;(benzo[d]thiazol&#8208;2&#8208;yl)&#8208;N&#8208;(benzo[d]thiazol&#8208;2&#8208;ylmethyl)methanimine) and alkene C (1,2&#8208;bis(benzo[d]thiazol&#8208;2&#8208;yl)ethene) through oxidative self&#8208;condensation and free radical coupling followed by elimination, respectively. They could then react with each other convergently via formal [3+2] cycloaddition to give deprotonated tetrasubstituted pyrrole coordinated intermediate [MnClP] after aromatization. Dimerization of [MnClP] produces the final product 1. Three C&#8722;C bonds and one C&#8722;N bond are formed through this six&#8208;step domino sequence. The corresponding organic skeleton (HP: 2,2&#8242;,2&#8242;&#8242;,2&#8242;&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;(1H&#8208;pyrrole&#8208;2,3,4,5&#8208;tetrayl)tetrakis(benzo[d]thiazole)) has been obtained from 1 and shows a higher fluorescent quantum yield (52&#8201;%) than the reported 3,4&#8208;diphenyl substituted analogue 2,2&#8242;&#8208;(3,4&#8208;diphenyl&#8208;1H&#8208;pyrrole&#8208;2,5&#8208;diyl)bis(benzo[d]thiazole) (DPB) (42&#8201;%).

         <title>A Three&#8208;Dimensional Non&#8208;Fullerene Acceptor with Contorted Hexabenzocoronene and Perylenediimide for Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>

A conjugated molecular HBC&#8208;4&#8208;PDI with three&#8208;dimensional geometry is synthesized and applied as a non&#8208;fullerene acceptor material in the active layer of organic solar cells.







Abstract
Although fullerene derivatives such as [6,6]&#8208;phenyl&#8208;C61/C71&#8208;butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM/PC71BM) have dominated the the photoactive acceptor materials in bulk heterojunction organic solar cells (OSCs) for decades, they have several drawbacks such as weak absorption, limited structural tunability, prone to aggregation, and high costs of production. Constructing non&#8208;fullerene small molecules with three&#8208;dimensional (3D) molecular geometry is one of the strategies to replace fullerenes in OSCs. In this study, a 3D molecule, contorted hexa&#8208;cata&#8208;hexabenzocoronene tetra perylenediimide (HBC&#8208;4&#8208;PDI), was designed and synthesized. HBC&#8208;4&#8208;PDI shows a wide and strong light absorption in the whole UV&#8208;vis region as well as suitable energy levels as an acceptor for OSCs. More importantly, the 3D construction effectively reduced the self&#8208;aggregation of c&#8208;HBC, leading to an appropriate scale phase separation of the blend film morphology in OSCs. A preliminary power conversion efficiency of 2.70&#8201;% with a champion open&#8208;circuit voltage of 1.06&#8197;V was obtained in OSCs with HBC&#8208;4&#8208;PDI as the acceptor, which was the highest among the previously reported OSCs based on c&#8208;HBC derivatives. The results indicated that HBC&#8208;4&#8208;PDI may serve as a good non&#8208;fullerene acceptor for OSCs.

         <title>Naphthalimide&#8208;based Functional Glycopolymeric Nanoparticles as Fluorescent Probes for Selective Imaging of Tumor Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Naphthalimide&#8208;based glycopolymeric nanoparticles with dual tumor&#8208;targeting ability from glucose&#8208;segment and phenylboronic ester modification were designed and used as pH sensitive and AIEgen fluorescent probes for selective imaging of tumor cells.







Abstract
A series of functional glycopolymer nanoparticles with 1,8&#8208;naphthalimide motif was designed, synthesized and applied for tumor cell imaging. With the pH&#8208;sensitive and aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) effect of the 1,8&#8208;naphthalimide fluorescent probe, the presence of glucose&#8208;based glycopolymers enhanced its water&#8208;solubility and biocompatibility. Owing to the dual tumor&#8208;targeting effects of the dense glucose part and the boronic ester modification, the obtained glycopolymers showed high affinity to tumor cells, with a much faster staining rate than normal cells, indicating a great potential for diagnosis and treatments of cancers.

Owing to the dual tumor-targeting effects of the dense glucose part and the boronic ester modification, the obtained glycopolymers showed high affinity to tumor cells, with a much faster staining rate than normal cells, indicating a great potential for diagnosis and treatments of cancers.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Electrochemical Diselenation of BODIPY Fluorophores for Bioimaging Applications and Sensitization of 1O2</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rapid and efficient approach with a broad scope for the late&#8208;stage electrochemical diselenation of BODIPYs is reported. The selenium&#8208;containing BODIPYs can stain lipid droplets selectively, exhibiting fluorescence in both green and red channels. The Se&#8208;functionalized BODIPYs exhibit larger Stokes shifts than their precursors, and sensitization of 1O2 from triplet states formed by competitive intersystem crossing, which makes them suitable for bioimaging studies and, potentially, and simultaneously, for photodynamic therapy. The electrochemical synthetic method offers an efficient and versatile alternative for the preparation of Se&#8208;functionalized fluorescent compounds with relevant physicochemical and biological profiles. More information can be found in the Research Article by H. Braunschweig, E.&#8197;N. da&#8197;Silva&#8197;J&#250;nior, and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202303883).

         <title>Regioselective Partial Hydrogenation and Deuteration of Tetracyclic (Hetero)aromatic Systems Using a Simple Heterogeneous Catalyst</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The introduction of added &#8216;3&#8208;dimensionality&#8217; through late&#8208;stage functionalisation is a powerful synthetic approach to biologically significant moieties. Herein, a hydrogenative, regioselective dearomatisation of extended (hetero)aromatic systems is described, using a simple Pd catalyst at atmospheric hydrogen pressure. Deuteration is also demonstrated and some initial mechanistic insights are revealed.







Abstract
The introduction of added &#8216;3&#8208;dimensionality&#8217; through late&#8208;stage functionalisation of extended (hetero)aromatic systems is a powerful synthetic approach. The abundance of starting materials and cross&#8208;coupling methodologies to access the precursors allows for highly diverse products. Subsequent selective partial reduction can alter the core structure in a manner of interest to medicinal chemists. Herein, we describe the precise, partial reduction of multicyclic heteroaromatic systems using a simple heterogeneous catalyst. The approach can be extended to introduce deuterium (again at late&#8208;stage). Excellent yields can be obtained using simple reaction conditions.

         <title>Aptamer Clicked Poly(ferrocenylsilanes) at Au Nanoparticles as Platforms with Multiple Function[&#8224;]</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Table of Contents: We present a novel poly(ferrocenylsilane)&#8208;gold nanoparticle (PFS&#8208;AuNP) system for aptamer grafting. A multi&#8208;responsive aptamer&#8208;AuNP platform is described. This platform possesses high colloidal stability in high ionic strength environments and exhibits both a redox response and the specific sensitivity of the aptamer.







Abstract
Aptamers are widely used in biosensing due to their specific sensitivity toward many targets. Thus, gold nanoparticle (AuNP) aptasensors are subject to intense research due to the complementary properties of aptamers as sensing elements and AuNPs as transducers. We present herein a novel method for the functional coupling of thrombin&#8208;specific aptamers to AuNPs via an anionic, redox&#8208;active poly(ferrocenylsilane) (PFS) polyelectroyte. The polymer acts as a co&#8208;reductant and stabilizer for the AuNPs, provides grafting sites for the aptamer, and can be used as a redox sensing element, making the aptamer&#8208;PFS&#8208;AuNP composite (aptamer&#8208;AuNP) a promising model system for future multifunctional sensors. The aptamer&#8208;AuNPs exhibit excellent colloidal stability in high ionic strength environments owing to the combined electrosteric stabilizing effects of the aptamer and the PFS. The synthesis of each assembly element is described, and the colloidal stability and redox responsiveness are studied. As an example to illustrate applications, we present results for thrombin sensitivity and specificity using the specific aptamer.

         <title>Two Birds with One Stone: Polymerized Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Small Molecules</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polymerized TADF small molecules capable of cost&#8208;effective solution processing are believed to bridge the efficiency gap between small molecules and polymers. And their recent progress is highlighted so as to shed light on the development of efficient TADF polymers.







Abstract
Thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) polymers show a great potential in low&#8208;cost, large&#8208;area and flexible full&#8208;color flat&#8208;panel displays. One of the most promising design rules is based on TADF+Linker, where a small molecular TADF unit is bonded to each other by a simple linker. Unlike the expensive vacuum deposition for small molecules, these polymerized TADF small molecules (Poly&#8208;TADF&#8208;SMs) are capable of cost&#8208;effective solution processing. Meanwhile, the good luminescent property of small molecular TADF emitters can be well inherited by Poly&#8208;TADF&#8208;SMs so as to bridge the efficiency gap between small molecules and polymers. Herein, we will highlight the recent progress of Poly&#8208;TADF&#8208;SMs, together with emphasis on their molecular design, photophysical and electroluminescence properties.

         <title>Gallaphosphene L(Cl)GaPGaL: A novel phosphinidene transfer reagent</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Gallaphosphene 1 serves as a phosphinidene transfer reagent in reactions with RNHCs and isonitriles, to give RNHC&#8208;coordinated phosphinidenes 2 and 1,3&#8208;phosphaazaallenes 3, respectively. NHC&#8208;coordinated phosphinidene 2&#8201;b reacted with THF&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;BH3 with selective B&#8722;H bond activation to the unique NHC&#8208;stabilized borane complex 4.







Abstract
Gallaphosphene L(Cl)GaPGaL 1 (L=HC[C(Me)N(Ar)]2; Ar=2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3) reacts with N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes RNHC (RNHC=[CMeN(R)]2C; R=Me, iPr) to RNHC&#8208;coordinated phosphinidenes RNHC&#8594;PGa(Cl)L (R=Me 2&#8201;a, iPr 2&#8201;b) and with isonitriles RNC (R=iPr, Cy) to 1,3&#8208;phosphaazaallenes L(Cl)GaP=C=N&#8722;R (R=iPr 3&#8201;a, Cy 3&#8201;b), respectively. Quantum chemical calculations reveal that 2&#8201;a/2&#8201;b possess two localized lone pair of electrons, whereas 3&#8201;a/3&#8201;b only show one localized lone pair as was reported for gallaphosphene 1. 2&#8201;b reacts with 2.5&#8197;equivalents of a borane (THF&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;BH3) to the NHC&#8208;stabilized phosphinidene&#8208;borane complex [iPrNHC&#8594;P(BH2)]2(BH3)3 4 with concomitant formation of LGa(H)Cl 5. 2&#8211;5 are characterized by heteronuclear (1H, 13C{1H}, 31P{1H}) NMR and IR spectroscopy, elemental analysis, and single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (sc&#8208;XRD).

         <title>Epoxide&#8208;Mediated Trans&#8208;Thioglycosylation and Application to the Synthesis of Oligosaccharides Related to the Capsular Polysaccharides of C.&#8197;jejuni HS:4</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient, atom&#8208;economic synthesis for a family of thio&#8208;oligosaccharides related to C.&#8197;jejuni HS:4 capsular polysaccharide is facilitated by epoxide&#8208;mediated trans&#8208;thioglycosylation. Access to these thio&#8208;linked analogs, known to have enhanced metabolic stability, has the potential to boost immunogenicity, accelerating the development of a synthetic vaccine against C.&#8197;jejuni HS:4, a multi&#8208;drug&#8208;resistant pathogen ranked as a high priority by the WHO.

         <title>Oligo&#8208;Condensation Reactions of Silanediols with Conservation of Solid&#8208;State&#8208;Structural Features.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The thermal (solid&#8208; and liquid state) condensation of monosilanols and silanediols was studied spectroscopically and thermally. Furthermore, the thermally induced cleavage of aryl groups was also investigated. A conservation of the crystal structure of the silanediols in the condensed state could be shown by X&#8208;ray diffractometry in combination with their single crystal structure.







Abstract
Oligo&#8208; and polysiloxanes are usually prepared by condensation reactions in solvents without control of stereochemistry. Here we present a solventless thermal condensation of stable organosilanols. We investigated the condensation reactions of organosilanediols with different organic substituents, having in common at least one aromatic group. The condensation kinetics of the precursors observed by NMR spectroscopy revealed a strong dependence on temperature, time, and substitution pattern at the silicon atom. SEC measurements showed that chain length increases with increasing condensation temperature and time and lower steric demand of the substituents, which also influences the glass transition temperatures (Tg) of the resulting oligo&#8208; or polymers. X&#8208;ray diffraction studies of the crystalline silanediols and their condensation products revealed a structural correlation between the substituent location in the crystalline precursors and the formed macromolecules induced by the hydrogen bonding pattern. In certain cases, it is possible to carry out topotactic polymerization in the solid&#8208;state, which has its origin in the crystal structure.

         <title>Oxidative Decarbonylation of an Azacalixpyridine&#8208;Supported Mo(0)&#8208;Tricarbonyl to a Mo(VI)&#8208;Trioxo Complex with Dioxygen in Solution and on Au(111): Determination of Molecular Mechanism</title>

         <dc:description>The conversion of an azacalixpyridine&#8208;supported Mo(0) tricarbonyl into a Mo(VI) trioxo complex with dioxygen (O2) is investigated in homogeneous solution and in a molecular film adsorbed on Au(111) using a variety of spectroscopic and analytical methods. These studies in particular show that the dome&#8208;shaped carbonyl complex adsorbed on the metal surface has the ability to bind and activate gaseous oxygen, overcoming the so&#8208;called surface trans&#8208;effect. Furthermore, the rate of the conversion dramatically increases by irradiation with light. This observation is explained with the help of complementary DFT calculations and attributed to two different pathways, a thermal and a photochemical one. Based on the experimental and theoretical findings, a molecular mechanism for the conversion of the carbonyl to the oxo complex is derived.</dc:description>

         <title>Insulating 6,6&#8208;Phenyl&#8208;C61&#8208;butyric Acid Methyl Ester on Transition&#8208;Metal Dichalcogenides: Impact of the Hybrid Materials on the Optical and Electrical Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this study we develop a strategy to insulate 6,6 &#8208;Phenyl C61 butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) on the basal plane of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs). Concretely single layers of MoS2, MoSe2, MoTe2, WS2, WSe2 and WTe2 and ultrathin MoO2 and WO2 were grown via chemical vapor deposition (CVD). Then, the thiol group of a PCBM modified with cysteine reacts with the chalcogen vacancies on the basal plane of TMDs, yielding PCBM&#8208;MoS2, PCBM&#8208;MoSe2, PCBM&#8208;WS2, PCBM&#8208;WSe2, PCBM&#8208;WTe2, PCBM&#8208;MoO2 and PCBM&#8208;WO2. Afterwards, all the hybrid materials were characterized using several techniques, including XPS, Raman spectroscopy, TEM, AFM, and cyclic voltammetry. Furthermore, PCBM causes a unique optical and electrical impact in every TMDs. For MoS2 devices, the conductivity and photoluminescence (PL) emission achieve a remarkable enhancement of 1700% and 200% in PCBM&#8208;MoS2 hybrids. Similarly, PCBM&#8208;MoTe2 hybrids exhibit a 2&#8208;fold enhancement in PL emission at 1.1 eV. On the other hand, PCBM&#8208;MoSe2, PCBM&#8208;WSe2 and PCBM&#8208;WS2 hybrids exhibited a new interlayer exciton at 1.29&#8208;1.44, 1.7 and 1.37&#8208;154 eV along with an enhancement of the photo&#8208;response by 2400, 3200 and 600%, respectively. Additionally, PCBM&#8208;WTe2 and PCBM&#8208;WO2 showed a modest photo&#8208;response, in sharp contrast with pristine WTe2 or WO2 which archive pure metallic character.</dc:description>

For MoS2 devices, the conductivity and photoluminescence (PL) emission achieve a remarkable enhancement of 1700% and 200% in PCBM-MoS2 hybrids. Similarly, PCBM-MoTe2 hybrids exhibit a 2-fold enhancement in PL emission at 1.1 eV. On the other hand, PCBM-MoSe2, PCBM-WSe2 and PCBM-WS2 hybrids exhibited a new interlayer exciton at 1.29-1.44, 1.7 and 1.37-154 eV along with an enhancement of the photo-response by 2400, 3200 and 600%, respectively. Additionally, PCBM-WTe2 and PCBM-WO2 showed a modest photo-response, in sharp contrast with pristine WTe2 or WO2 which archive pure metallic character.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Strong Circularly Polarized Luminescence Promoted by AIE&#8208;active Chiral Co&#8208;assemblies in Liquid Crystal Polymer Films</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Recently, extensive works have focused on increasing the dissymmetry factors (glum) of various circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) materials, which is one of the most important factors for future applications of CPL. Herein, we designed a chiral co&#8208;assembled liquid crystal polymer (LCP) PTZ@R/S&#8208;PB2, which was prepared by chiral binary co&#8208;polymer (R/S&#8208;PB2) doped with achiral phenothiazine derivation dye (PTZ). For comparison, ternary co&#8208;polymerized LCP (R/S&#8208;PT) was synthesized by co&#8208;polymerizing with mesogenic monomer, chiral monomer and emissive monomer. Both PTZ@R/S&#8208;PB2 and R/S&#8208;PT showed aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) properties. Interestingly, the CPL signals of both PTZ@R/S&#8208;PB2 and R/S&#8208;PT were reversed and amplified after thermal annealing treatment. The |glum| values of the co&#8208;assembled PTZ@R/S&#8208;PB2 were up to 0.13 at a 32 nm thickness, which was 5.4 times that of R/S&#8208;PT (|glum| = 0.024). This is due to PTZ@R/S&#8208;PB2 could form more orderly chiral co&#8208;assembly structures. Noticeably, increasing the LCP film thickness could further improve the glum value, and the maximum glum&#160;of PTZ@R/S&#8208;PB2 could be enhanced to 0.91&#160;at a 220 nm thickness.</dc:description>

         <title>2D Monolayer Catalysts: Towards Efficient Water Splitting and Green Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A viable alternative to non&#8208;renewable hydrocarbon fuels is hydrogen gas, created using a safe, environmentally friendly process like water splitting. An important role in water&#8208;splitting applications is played by the development of two&#8208;dimensional (2D) layered transition metal chalcogenides (TMDCs), transition metal carbides (MXenes), graphene&#8208;derived 2D layered nanomaterials, phosphorene, and hexagonal boron nitride. Advanced synthesis methods and characterization instruments enabled an effective application for improved electrocatalytic water splitting and sustainable hydrogen production. Enhancing active sites, modifying the phase and electronic structure, adding conductive elements like transition metals, forming heterostructures, altering the defect state, etc., can improve the catalytic activity of 2D stacked hybrid monolayer nanomaterials. The majority of global research and development is focused on finding safer substitutes for petrochemical fuels, and this review summarizes recent advancements in the field of 2D monolayer nanomaterials in water splitting for industrial&#8208;scale green hydrogen production and fuel cell applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Asymmetric Synthesis with Organoselenium Compounds &#8211; The Past Twelve Years</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Examples of asymmetric reactions modulated by selenium compounds include a chiral selenophosphoramide Lewis base that catalyzes electrophilic and oxidative additions to alkenes, an ylide containing a terpene&#8208;based chiral auxiliary for cyclopropanations and a chiral selenide catalyst for photoredox cyclofunctionalizations.







Abstract
The discovery and synthetic applications of novel organoselenium compounds and their reactions proceeded rapidly during the past fifty years and such processes are now carried out routinely in many laboratories. At the same time, the growing demand for new enantioselective processes provided new challenges. The convergence of selenium chemistry and asymmetric synthesis led to key developments in the 1970s, although the majority of early work was based on stoichiometric processes. More recently, greater emphasis has been placed on greener catalytic variations, along with the discovery of novel reactions and a deeper understanding of their mechanisms. The present review covers the literature in this field from 2010 to early 2023 and encompasses asymmetric reactions mediated by chiral selenium&#8208;based reagents, auxiliaries, and especially, catalysts. Protocols based on achiral selenium compounds in conjunction with other species of chiral catalysts, as well as reactions that are controlled by chiral substrates, are also included.

         <title>A Rational Design of Electrochemically and Photophysically Tunable Triarylamine Luminophores by Consecutive (Pseudo&#8208;)Four&#8208;Component Syntheses</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A single palladium catalyst catches two birds with one stone by multicomponent Suzuki and Buchwald&#8208;Hartwig coupling to give a library of redox&#8208;active triarylamine (TAA) luminophores. Redox potentials, absorption and emission energies together with (TD)DFT calculations of the electronic structure set the stage for structure&#8208;property relationships for a rational design of tunable TAAs.







Abstract
The concatenation of Suzuki coupling and two&#8208;fold Buchwald&#8208;Hartwig amination in sequentially palladium&#8208;catalyzed consecutive multicomponent syntheses paves a concise, convergent route to diversely functionalized para&#8208;biaryl&#8208;substituted triarylamines (p&#8208;bTAAs) from simple, readily available starting materials. An extensive library of p&#8208;bTAAs permits comprehensive investigations of their electronic properties by absorption and emission spectroscopy, cyclic voltammetry, and quantum chemical calculations, which contribute to a deep understanding of their electronic structure. The synthesized p&#8208;bTAAs exhibit tunable fluorescence from blue to yellow upon photonic excitation with quantum yields up to 98&#8201;% in solution and 92&#8201;% in the solid state. Furthermore, a pronounced bathochromic shift of the emission maxima by increasing solvent polarity indicates positive emission solvatochromism. Aggregation&#8208;induced enhanced emission (AIEE) in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)/water mixtures causes the formation of intensely blue fluorescent aggregates. Cyclic voltammetry shows reversible first and second oxidations of p&#8208;bTAAs at low potentials, which are tunable by variation of the introduced para substituents. 3D Hammett plots resulting from the correlation of oxidation potentials and emission maxima with electronic substituent parameters emphasize the rational design of tailored p&#8208;bTAAs with predictable electrochemical and photophysical properties.

         <title>Exploring Electrophilic Hydrophosphination via Metal Phosphenium Intermediates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Umpolung in P&#8722;H activation: Metal&#8208;mediated hydrophosphination that relies on electrophilic addition at a phosphenium ligand has been demonstrated for unsaturated substrates including the decidedly unactivated ethylene. This outer&#8208;sphere process demonstrates that metal&#8208;coordinated secondary phosphines can act as hydride donors to reactive carbocations. The results highlight the tunable Lewis acidity of metal phosphenium complexes.







Abstract
Two Mo(0) phosphenium complexes containing ancillary secondary phosphine ligands have been investigated with respect to their ability to participate in electrophilic addition at unsaturated substrates and subsequent P&#8722;H hydride transfer to &#8220;quench&#8221; the resulting carbocations. These studies provide stoichiometric &#8220;proof of concept&#8221; for a proposed new metal&#8208;catalyzed electrophilic hydrophosphination mechanism. The more strongly Lewis acidic phosphenium complex, [Mo(CO)4(PR2H)(PR2)]+ (R=Ph, Tolp), cleanly hydrophosphinates 1,1&#8208;diphenylethylene, benzophenone, and ethylene, while other substrates react rapidly to give products resulting from competing electrophilic processes. A less Lewis acidic complex, [Mo(CO)3(PR2H)2(PR2)]+, generally reacts more slowly but participates in clean hydrophosphination of a wider range of unsaturated substrates, including styrene, indene, 1&#8208;hexene, and cyclohexanone, in addition to 1,1&#8208;diphenylethylene, benzophenone, and ethylene. Mechanistic studies are described, including stoichiometric control reactions and computational and kinetic analyses, which probe whether the observed P&#8722;H addition actually does occur by the proposed electrophilic mechanism, and whether hydridic P&#8722;H transfer in this system is intra&#8208; or intermolecular. Preliminary reactivity studies indicate challenges that must be addressed to exploit these promising results in catalysis.

         <title>Polyoxometalate&#8208;dependent photocatalytic activity of radical&#8208;doped perylenediimide&#8208;based hybrid materials</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Extremely rare radical&#8208;doped PDI&#8208;based hybrid materials exhibit remarkable POM&#8208;dependent photocatalytic activities for the oxidative coupling of amines and the iodoperfluoroalkylation of alkenes, which is attributed to the energy differences between the SOMO&#8208;2 level of Cl4&#8208;PDI&#8901;&#8722;* and the LUMO level of the POMs.







Abstract
Inorganic&#8208;organic hybrid materials are a kind of multiduty materials with high crystallinity and definite structures, built from functional inorganic and organic components with highly tunable photochemical properties. Perylenediimides (PDIs) are a kind of strong visible light&#8208;absorbing organic dyes with &#960;&#8208;electron&#8208;deficient planes and photochemical properties depending on their micro&#8208;environment, which provides a platform for designing tunable and efficient hybrid photocatalytic materials. Herein, four radical&#8208;doped PDI&#8208;based crystalline hybrid materials, Cl4&#8208;PDI&#8901;SiW12O40 (1), Cl4&#8208;PDI&#8901;SiMo12O40 (2), Cl4&#8208;PDI&#8901;PW12O40 (3), and Cl4&#8208;PDI&#8901;PMo12O40 (4), were attained by slow diffusion of polyoxometalates (POMs) into acidified Cl4&#8208;PDI solutions. The obtained PDI&#8208;based crystalline hybrid materials not only exhibited prominent photochromism, but also possessed reactive organic radicals under ambient conditions. Furthermore, all hybrid materials could be easily photoreduced to their radical anions (Cl4&#8208;PDI&#8901;&#8722;), and then underwent a second photoexcitation to form energetic excited state radical anions (Cl4&#8208;PDI&#8901;&#8722;*). However, experiments and theoretical calculations demonstrated that the formed energetic Cl4&#8208;PDI&#8901;&#8722;* showed unusual POM&#8208;dependent photocatalytic efficiencies toward the oxidative coupling of amines and the iodoperfluoroalkylation of alkenes; higher photocatalytic efficiencies were found for hybrid materials 1 (anion: SiW12O404&#8722;) and 2 (anion: SiMo12O404&#8722;) compared to 3 (anion: PW12O403&#8722;) and 4 (anion: PMo12O403&#8722;). The photocatalytic efficiencies of these hybrid materials are mainly controlled by the energy differences between the SOMO&#8208;2 level of Cl4&#8208;PDI&#8901;&#8722;* and the LUMO level of the POMs. The structure&#8208;photocatalytic activity relationships established in present work provide new research directions to both the photocatalysis and hybrid material fields, and will promote the integration of these areas to explore new materials with interesting properties.

A novel class of siloxane&#8208;based porous materials is synthesized through the cross&#8208;linking of organosilylated cage siloxanes with double&#8208;6&#8208;ring (D6R) geometry. This material has higher surface area and chemical stability compared with conventional porous materials prepared using double&#8208;4&#8208;ring cage siloxanes, and also has a potential for unique encapsulation abilities.







Abstract
Utilization of well&#8208;defined siloxane molecules allows for the construction of functional siloxane&#8208;based nanoporous materials based on the molecular design. Herein, a novel class of siloxane&#8208;based porous materials is synthesized via cross&#8208;linking of dimethylsilyl&#8208; and dimethylvinylsilyl&#8208;functionalized cage siloxanes with double&#8208;6&#8208;ring (D6R) geometry. Compared with the conventional double&#8208;4&#8208;ring cage siloxane, this study highlights the characteristics of D6R siloxanes as building blocks, demonstrating their high surface area and chemical stability. Furthermore, density functional theory calculations show their unique cation encapsulation ability.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fast&#8208;charging technology is set to revolutionize the field of lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs), driving the creation of next&#8208;generation devices with the ability to get charged within a short span of time. From the anode perspective, it is of paramount importance to design materials that can withstand continuous Li+ insertion/deinsertion at high charging rates and still remain unaffected by factors such as mechanical fractures, electrolyte side reactions, polarisation, lithium plating and heat generation. Herein, the recent advancements in the design of amorphous materials as anodes for fast&#8208;charging LIBs have been discussed. While the development of this particular class of materials for application in high&#8208;rate anodes has been paid limited attention in recent literature, it holds immense promise for improving the fast&#8208;charging capabilities. This concept summarizes the recent strides made in this emerging field, outlining the strategies employed in the design of amorphous anodes and emphasizing the crucial role played by its amorphous nature in achieving fast&#8208;charging performance. Further, the successive initiatives than can be undertaken to drive the progress of amorphous materials for fast charging LIBs have also been detailed, which could potentially improve their commercial viability.</dc:description>

         <title>Controlling Cyclic Dienamine Reactivity in Radical tert&#8208;Alkylation for Molecular Diversity to Synthesize Multicyclic Compounds possessing a Quaternary Carbon</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Selective formation of the desired dienamines from &#946;&#8208;methylcyclohexenone and their reaction with tertiary alkyl radicals generated from &#945;&#8208;bromoesters led to the synthesis of &#947;&#8208;oxoalkyl substituted cyclohexenone derivatives (OAC) with a quaternary carbon have been successfully synthesized. This OAC can be used as a common synthetic intermediate for fused [5,6] rings and spirocycles.







Abstract
Synthesis of diverse sterically congested molecules from a single important intermediate is one of the ideal synthetic strategies in organic synthesis. In this paper, we found that &#947;&#8208;oxoalkyl substituted cyclohexenone derivatives (OAC) possessing a quaternary carbon are a useful key intermediate to derive both congested fused [5,6] rings and spirocycles. For this purpose, we have established an efficient synthetic method to obtain OAC by tertiary alkylation of &#946;&#8208;methylcyclohexenone derivatives using &#945;&#8208;bromocarbonyl compounds as a tertiary alkyl source. The key to the success of this reaction is controlling the reactivity of the dienamine intermediate. While there have been many reports on enamine reactions, dienamine reactions have not been well studied. Herein, we report controlling reactivity of dienamines and molecular diversification from OAC.

         <title>Analysis of the Unusual Chemical Bonds and Dipole Moments of AeF&#8722; (Ae=Be&#8722;Ba): A Lesson in Covalent Bonding</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A careful bonding analysis of the anions AeF&#8208; shows that the fluorine anion F&#8722; is a very strong donor via charge&#8208;induced covalent interactions with alkaline earth atoms Ae, exhibiting triple bonds for Ae=Be, Mg and even quadruple bonds for the heavier atoms Ae=Ca, Sr, Ba due to their empty (n&#8208;1)d valence orbitals. The unusual dipole moments with the negative end at the Ae atom are decomposed into pairwise electron contributions that reveal the special role of the HOMO.







Abstract
Quantum chemical calculations of the anions AeF&#8722; (Ae=Be&#8722;Ba) have been carried out using ab initio methods at the CCSD(T)/def2&#8208;TZVPP level and density functional theory employing BP86 with various basis sets. The detailed bonding analyses using different charge&#8208; and energy partitioning methods show that the molecules possess three distinctively different dative bonds in the lighter species with Ae=Be, Mg and four dative bonds when Ae=Ca, Sr, Ba. The occupied 2p atomic orbitals (AOs) and to a lesser degree the occupied 2s AO of F&#8722; donate electronic charge into the vacant spx(&#963;) and p(&#960;) orbitals of Be and Mg which leads to a triple bond Ae
F&#8722;. The heavier Ae atoms Ca, Sr, Ba use their vacant (n&#8208;1)d AOs as acceptor orbitals which enables them to form a second &#963; donor bond with F&#8722; that leads to quadruply bonded Ae
F&#8722; (Ae=Ca&#8722;Ba). The presentation of molecular orbitals or charge distribution using only one isodensity value may give misleading information about the overall nature of the orbital or charge distribution. Better insights are given by contour line diagrams.

     alt="Analysis of the Unusual Chemical Bonds and Dipole Moments of AeF&#8722; (Ae=Be&#8722;Ba): A Lesson in Covalent Bonding"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A careful bonding analysis of the anions AeF- shows that the fluorine anion F&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; is a very strong donor via charge-induced covalent interactions with alkaline earth atoms Ae, exhibiting triple bonds for Ae=Be, Mg and even quadruple bonds for the heavier atoms Ae=Ca, Sr, Ba due to their empty (n-1)d valence orbitals. The unusual dipole moments with the negative end at the Ae atom are decomposed into pairwise electron contributions that reveal the special role of the HOMO.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quantum chemical calculations of the anions AeF&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; (Ae=Be&#8722;Ba) have been carried out using ab initio methods at the CCSD(T)/def2-TZVPP level and density functional theory employing BP86 with various basis sets. The detailed bonding analyses using different charge- and energy partitioning methods show that the molecules possess three distinctively different dative bonds in the lighter species with Ae=Be, Mg and four dative bonds when Ae=Ca, Sr, Ba. The occupied 2p atomic orbitals (AOs) and to a lesser degree the occupied 2s AO of F&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; donate electronic charge into the vacant sp&lt;sup&gt;x&lt;/sup&gt;(&#963;) and p(&#960;) orbitals of Be and Mg which leads to a triple bond Ae
F&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;. The heavier Ae atoms Ca, Sr, Ba use their vacant (n-1)d AOs as acceptor orbitals which enables them to form a second &#963; donor bond with F&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; that leads to quadruply bonded Ae
F&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; (Ae=Ca&#8722;Ba). The presentation of molecular orbitals or charge distribution using only one isodensity value may give misleading information about the overall nature of the orbital or charge distribution. Better insights are given by contour line diagrams. The ELF calculations provide monosynaptic and disynaptic basins of AeF&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; which nicely agree with the analysis of the occupied molecular orbitals and with the charge density difference maps. A particular feature of the covalent bonds in AeF&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; concerns the inductive interaction of F&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; with the soft valence electrons in the (n)s valence orbitals of Ae. The polarization of the (n)s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; electrons induces a (n)sp&lt;sup&gt;x&lt;/sup&gt; hybridized lone-pair orbital at atom Ae, which yields a large dipole moment with the negative end at Ae. The concomitant formation of a vacant (n)sp&lt;sup&gt;x&lt;/sup&gt; AO of atom Ae, which overlaps with the occupied 2p(&#963;) AO of F&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;, leads to a strong covalent &#963; bond.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

An unprecedented access to monosubstituted cationic tricyclic heteroaromatic compounds (cPHACs), possessing tunable photo&#8208;physical/electrochemical properties and having structural resemblance with drug molecules, via Ru(II)&#8208;catalyzed tandem annulation cum aromatization following a non&#8208;AAIPEX protocol is reported. This methodology executes a range of intermediate steps e.&#8201;g. double C&#8722;H activation, nucleophilic addition, annulation, and dehydration cum aromatization in one&#8208;pot manner under the generation of water as the sole by&#8208;product.







Abstract
An unprecedented non&#8208;AAIPEX protocol has been developed to access diverse monosubstituted cationic polycyclic heteroaromatic compounds (cPHACs) from the readily available azolium salts and phenacyl bromides via Ru(II)&#8208;catalyzed tandem annulation cum aromatization. This atom&#8208;economic protocol executes a range of intermediate steps e.&#8201;g. double C&#8722;H activation, nucleophilic addition, annulation, and dehydration cum aromatization in one&#8208;pot manner under the generation of H2O as the sole byproduct. Moreover, the systematic tunability of photo&#8208;physical and electrochemical properties of these new class of cPHACs can be authenticated from the DFT calculated frontier molecular orbital energies that might be beneficial for their potential applications in optoelectronics and DNA intercalation.

         <title>Synthesis and Isolation of a Homochiral Nanohoop Composed of a Tr&#246;ger's Base and Hexaparaphenylene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tethering of a stereogenic Tr&#246;ger's base to a curved hexaparaphenylene has led to the synthesis of the homochiral nanohoop TB[6]CPP. This nanohoop possesses a C2 symmetrical structure, which gives rise to pale blue emission with a high quantum yield of ca.&#8197;0.69 and shows chiroptical properties, especially circular polarized luminescence with a moderate dissymmetry factor (|glum|) of 2.1&#215;10&#8722;3.







Abstract
The synthesis of a new nanohoop containing a stereogenic Tr&#246;ger's base skeleton tethered to a curved hexaparaphenylene ([6]CPP) is reported. The TB[6]CPP nanohoop possesses a stable C2 symmetrical structure, which promotes the allowed transition that gives rise to pale blue emission with a quantum yield of ~0.69, surpassing the value of the more symmetrical [8]CPP. Moreover, TB[6]CPP shows chiroptical properties including circular dichroism and circularly polarized luminescence with a moderate dissymmetry factor (|glum|) of ~2.1&#215;10&#8722;3

         <title>Pyrrole &#946;C&#8722;B&#8722;N Fused Porphyrins: Molecular Structures and Opto&#8208;Electrochemical Studies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
B&#8722;N fusion induced extended conjugation and tetracoordinated boron caused twisted structure in &#946;C&#8722;B&#8722;N fused Ni(II) porphyrins (1&#8208;trans, 1&#8208;cis, 2&#8208;trans, and 2&#8208;cis) exhibit red shifted absorption than non&#8208;fused compounds. The fused porphyrins are easier to reduce and easier to oxidize compared to compounds without B&#8722;N fusion.







Abstract
Herein, we report the design, synthesis, structure, and electrochemical study of doubly &#946;C&#8722;B&#8722;N fused Ni(II) porphyrins (1&#8208;trans, 1&#8208;cis, 2&#8208;trans, and 2&#8208;cis). These compounds have been synthesized from A2B2 type dipyridyl Ni(II) porphyrins (Ar=Ph for 1&#8201;a; Ar=C6F5 for 2&#8201;a) via Lewis base&#8208;directed electrophilic aromatic borylation reactions. The solution state structures of these compounds have been established using 1H NMR, 11B NMR, 1H&#8208;1H COSY, 1H&#8208;13C HSQC, and 19F&#8208;13C HSQC NMR techniques. Single crystal X&#8208;ray analysis have revealed that 1&#8208;trans, 1&#8208;cis, and 2&#8208;trans adopt ruffled conformations, with alternate meso&#8208;carbons on the opposite sides of the mean porphyrin plane. The Soret bands in the absorption spectra of the B&#8722;N fused molecules are ~40&#8197;nm redshifted compared to unfused Ni(II) porphyrin precursors. The B&#8722;N fusion have diminished the redox potential of fused porphyrins. Although 1&#8208;trans and 1&#8208;cis, show four oxidation processes, 2&#8208;trans and 2&#8208;cis show only three oxidation processes. DFT studies have revealed that the tetrahedral geometry of the boron has induced a twist in the &#960;&#8208;conjugation, which destabilizes the HOMO and stabilizes the LUMO in 1&#8208;trans, 1&#8208;cis, 2&#8208;trans, and 2&#8208;cis.

         <title>Continuous Direct Mechanocatalytic Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura Coupling via Twin&#8208;Screw Extrusion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study delves into the mechanocatalytic Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura reaction within an extruder, elucidating the influence of parameters like temperature, catalyst position and contact time. Notably, multiple passes through the extruder yielded substantially improved reaction conversions. The research underscores the pivotal role of optimizing the interplay between catalyst contact time and energy input, offering crucial insights for industrial&#8208;scale applications of mechanochemical reactions.







Abstract
This work establishes the first direct mechanocatalytic reaction protocol within an extruder, focusing on the Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura reaction. Through the coating of either the extruder screws or barrel with Pd, we executed the cross&#8208;coupling reaction without the reliance on molecular catalyst compounds or powders, and solvents continuously. We identified the influence and interplay of crucial reaction parameters such as temperature, mechanical energy input, residence time, rheology, and catalyst contact time and finally obtained 36&#8201;% and 75&#8201;% of the reaction product after one and four reactor passes respectively.

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This work establishes the first direct mechanocatalytic reaction protocol within an extruder, focusing on the Suzuki-Miyaura reaction. Through the coating of either the extruder screws or barrel with Pd, we executed the cross-coupling reaction without the reliance on molecular catalyst compounds or powders, and solvents continuously. We identified the influence and interplay of crucial reaction parameters such as temperature, mechanical energy input, residence time, rheology, and catalyst contact time and finally obtained 36&#8201;% and 75&#8201;% of the reaction product after one and four reactor passes respectively.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Recent Advances of Flexible MXene and its Composites for Supercapacitors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>MXenes have unique properties such as high electrical conductivity, excellent mechanical properties, rich surface chemistry, and convenient processability. These characteristics make them ideal for producing flexible materials with tunable microstructures. This paper reviews the laboratory research progress of flexible MXene and its composite materials for supercapacitors. And introduces the general synthesis method of MXene, as well as the preparation and properties of flexible MXene. By analyzing the current research status, the electrochemical reaction mechanism of MXene was explained from the perspectives of electrolyte and surface terminating groups. This review particularly emphasizes the composite methods of freestanding flexible MXene composite materials. The review points out that the biggest problem with flexible MXene electrodes is severe self&#8208;stacking, which reduces the number of chemically active sites, weakens ion accessibility, and ultimately lowers electrochemical performance. Therefore, it is necessary to composite MXene with other electrode materials and design a good microstructure. This review affirms the enormous potential of flexible MXene and its composite materials in the field of supercapacitors. In addition, the challenges and possible improvements faced by MXene based materials in practical applications were also discussed.</dc:description>

         <title>Metal Organic Frameworks Synthesis: The Versatility of Triethylamine</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal Organic Frameworks (MOFs) are organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid materials with exceptionally customizable composition and properties. MOFs intrinsically possess open metal sites, tunable pore size/shape and an ultra&#8208;large specific surface area, and have obtained significant attention over the past 30 years. Furthermore, through the integration of functional moieties such as, molecules, functional groups, noble metal clusters and nanocrystals or nanoparticles into MOFs, the resulting composites have greatly enriched the physical and chemical properties of pure MOFs, enabling their application in a wider range of fields. Triethylamine (TEA) as an organic base has consistently played a fundamental role in the development of MOFs. In this Concept, the versatility of triethylamine when involved in the synthesis of MOFs is discussed. Four sections are used to elaborate on the role of TEA including: (1) Single crystal synthesis; (2) Size and morphology control; (3) Building block of MOFs; (4) MOFs composites synthesis. In the last part, we highlight the potential of TEA for further developments.</dc:description>

         <title>From the Iron Pentacarbonyl Cation to Heteroleptic &#951;6&#8208;arene Carbonyls and bis&#8208;&#951;6&#8208;arene Cations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Partial ligand substitution at the iron pentacarbonyl radical cation generates novel half&#8208;sandwich complexes of the type [Fe(&#951;6&#8208;arene)(CO)2]&#8226;+ (arene = 1,3,5&#8208;tri&#8208;tert&#8208;butylbenzene, 1,3,5&#8208;trimethylbenzene, benzene and fluorobenzene). Of those, the bulkier 1,3,5&#8208;tri&#8208;tert&#8208;butylbenzene (mes*) derivative [Fe(mes*)(CO)2]&#8226;+ was fully characterized by XRD analysis, IR, NMR, cw&#8208;EPR, M&#246;ssbauer spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry as the [Al(ORF)4]&#8722; (RF = C(CF3)3) salt. Chemical electronation, i.e., the single electron reduction, with decamethylferrocene generates neutral [Fe(mes*)(CO)2], whereas further deelectronation under CO&#8208;pressure leads to a dicationic three&#8208;legged [Fe(mes*)(CO)3]2+ salt with [Al(ORF)4]&#8211; counterion. The full substitution of the carbonyl ligands in [Fe(CO)5]&#8226;+[Al(ORF)4]&#8722; mainly resulted in disproportionation reactions, giving solid Fe(0) and the dicationic bis&#8208;arene salts [Fe(&#951;6&#8208;arene)2]2+([Al(ORF)4]&#8211;)2 (arene = 1,3,5&#8208;trimethylbenzene, benzene and fluorobenzene). Only by employing the very large fluoride bridged anion [F&#8208;{Al(ORF)3}2]&#8722;, it was possible to isolate an open shell bis&#8208;arene cation salt [Fe(C6H6)2]&#8226;+[F&#8208;{Al(ORF)3}2]&#8722;. The highly reactive cation was characterized by XRD analysis, cw&#8208;EPR, M&#246;ssbauer spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry. The disproportionation of [Fe(C6H6)2]&#8226;+ salts to give solid Fe(0) and [Fe(C6H6)2]2+ salts was analyzed by a suitable cycle, revealing that the thermodynamic driving force for the disproportionation is a function of the size of the anion used and the polarity of the solvent.</dc:description>

         <title>Aurones: Unexplored Visible&#8208;Light Photoswitches for Aqueous Medium</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of synthetically accessible photoswitches showing an efficient performance in aqueous medium has recently become an urgent task due to the rapid progress of photopharmacology and novel biomedical applications. In response to this challenge, in this work, aurone derivatives are introduced as a novel class of efficient visible&#8208;light photoswitches for aqueous medium. In general, aurones exhibit superior performance in water, including significantly higher quantum yields, compared with other indigoid photoswitches (hemithioindigo and hemiindigo). Especially remarkable are the half&#8208;lives of the photoinduced E&#8208;isomers of aurones in water, reaching up to 7 years. Further modification of the aurone scaffold with substituents that increase water solubility does not affect most of the photoswitching characteristics and even improves some them. The highly advantageous property profile of the aurone photoswitches make them a perfect novel platform for the design of light&#8208;controllable systems in the areas requiring photoswitching in aqueous medium.</dc:description>

         <title>Versatile Polymerization&#8208;Induced Emission Polymers from Barbier Polymerization of Cinnamic Esters with Tunable Emission</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cinnamic ester is a common and abundant chemical substance, which can be extracted from natural plants. Compared with traditional esters, cinnamic ester contains a,b &#8208;unsaturated carbonyl structure with multiple reactive sites, resulting in more abundant reactivities and chemical structures. Here, a versatile polymerization&#8208;induced emission (PIE) is successfully demonstrated through Barbier polymerization of cinnamic ester. Attributed to its abundant reactivities of a,b &#8208;unsaturated carbonyl structure, Barbier polymerization of cinnamic esters with different organodihalides gives polyalcohol and polyketone via 1,2&#8208;addition and 1,4&#8208;addition, respectively, which is also confirmed by small molecular model reactions. Meanwhile, these organodihalides dependant polyalcohol and polyketone exhibit different non&#8208;traditional intrinsic luminescence (NTIL) from aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) type to aggregation&#8208;caused quenching (ACQ) type, where novel PIE luminogens (PIEgens) are revealed. Further potential applications in explosive detection are carried out, where it achieves TNT detection sensitivity at ppm level in solution and ng level on the test paper. This work therefore expands the structure and functionality libraries of monomer, polymer and NTIL, which might cause inspirations to different fields including polymer chemistry, NTIL, AIE and PIE.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Cinnamic ester is a common and abundant chemical substance, which can be extracted from natural plants. Compared with traditional esters, cinnamic ester contains a,b -unsaturated carbonyl structure with multiple reactive sites, resulting in more abundant reactivities and chemical structures.

         <title>Photoswitching in a Liquid Crystalline Pt(II) Coordination Complex</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photoswitching of photoluminescence has sparked tremendous research interests for super&#8208;resolution imaging, high&#8208;security&#8208;level anti&#8208;counterfeiting, and other high&#8208;tech applications. However, the excitation of photoluminescence is usually ready to trigger the photoswitching process, making the photoluminescence readout unreliable. Herein, we report a new photoswitch by the marriage of spiropyran with platinum(II) coordination complex. Viable photoluminescence can be achieved upon excitation by 480 nm visible light while the photoswitching can be easily triggered by 365 nm UV light. The feasible photoswitching may be benefited from the formed liquid crystalline phase of the designed photoswitch as a crystalline spiropyran is normally unable to implement photoswitching. Compared to the counterparts, this LC photoswitch can show distinct and reliable apparent colors and emission colors before and after photoswitching, which may promise the utility in high&#8208;security&#8208;level anti&#8208;counterfeiting and other advanced information technologies.</dc:description>

         <title>Supramolecular Polymer Network based on Electrophilic Substitution (ES) Adduct of Furan&#8208;Triazolinedione</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A tailor&#8208;made homopolymer, poly(furfuryl methacrylate) (PFMA) was synthesized and engineered to a self&#8208;healable supramolecular thermoset via electrophilic substitution (ES) with a commercially available 1,2,4&#8208;triazoline&#8208;3,5&#8208;dione (TAD) derivative, 4&#8208;phenyl&#8208;TAD (PTAD).







Abstract
Polymers with furan functionality have been the subject of extensive research on developing sustainable materials applying a limited number of dynamic covalent approaches. Herein, we introduce a facile, dynamic non&#8208;covalent approach to make a furan polymer readily accessible for self&#8208;healing applications based on its electrophilic substitution (ES) with a commercially available 1,2,4&#8208;triazoline&#8208;3,5&#8208;dione (TAD) derivative, 4&#8208;phenyl&#8208;TAD (PTAD). A tailor&#8208;made furan polymer, poly(furfuryl methacrylate) (PFMA), considering it an initial illustrative example, was rapidly ES modified with PTAD to produce furfuryl&#8208;tagged triazolidine that subsequently associated via inter&#8208;molecular hydrogen (H&#8722;) bonding to produce a thermally reversible supramolecular polymer network under ambient conditions. The H&#8208;bonded network was experimentally quantified via ATR&#8208;IR analysis and theoretically rationalized via the density functional theory (DFT) study using smaller organic model compounds analogous to the macromolecular system. Thermoreversible feature of the H&#8208;bonded triazolidine&#8208;derived supramolecular polymer network enabled the solution reprocessing and self&#8208;healing of the polymer material.

         <title>Type&#8208;I photodynamic therapy induced by Pt&#8208;coordination of type&#8208;II photosensitizers into supramolecular complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Platinum coordination with type&#8208;II photosensitizer Cz&#8722;BTZ&#8722;Py enables type&#8208;I photodynamic therapy through exciton coupling between photosensitizer's ligands and enhanced spin&#8208;orbital coupling (SOC).







Abstract
Platinum supramolecular complexes based on photosensitizers have garnered great interest in photodynamic therapy (PDT) due to Pt (II) centers as chemotherapeutic agents to eliminate tumor cells completely, which greatly improve the antitumor efficacy of PDT. However, in comparison to precursor photosensitizer ligand, the formed platinum supramolecular complexes typically exhibit inferior outcomes in terms of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. How to boost ROS generation in the formed platinum supramolecular complexes for enhanced PDT is an enticing yet highly challenging task. Here we report a Pt&#8208;coordination&#8208;based dimeric photosensitizer complex (Cz&#8722;BTZ&#8722;Py)2Pt(OTf)2. It is found that comparing with photosensitizer ligand Cz&#8722;BTZ&#8722;Py, the formed supramolecular complex exhibit redshifts of absorption wavelength as well as enhanced ROS generation efficiency. Moreover, type&#8208;I ROS generation (O2&#8901;&#8722;) is produced in the formed platinum supramolecular complexes mainly due to a reduced energy gap &#916;EST resulting from exciton coupling between two photosensitizer ligands. And type&#8208;I ROS (O2&#8901;&#8722;) generation significantly amplifies the photodynamic therapy (PDT) outcomes. In&#8197;vitro evaluation shows excellent photochemotherapy performance of (Cz&#8722;BTZ&#8722;Py)2Pt(OTf)2 nanoparticles. We anticipate this work would provide a novel approach to design type&#8208;I photosensitizers for efficient PDT.

         <title>[2,2]Paracyclophane Bridged, Thiophene Based Macrocycles: Synthesis and Electronic Properties in Different Redox States</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
[2,2]paracyclophane (pCp) bridged, thiophene&#8208;based macrocycles were sythesisized, and their electronic properties at diffferent oxidation states were investigated. The dications are open&#8208;shell diradical dications, while the tetracations have closed&#8208;shell ground state. There is almost no through&#8208;space electronic coupling through the pCp units, and thus no global aromaticity.







Abstract
The study of through&#8208;space electronic coupling in &#960;&#8208;conjugated systems remains an underexplored area. In this work, we present the facile synthesis of two isomeric macrocycles (1 and 2) bridged by [2,2]paracyclophane (pCp) and based on thiophene. The structures of these macrocycles have been confirmed through X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis. Our investigation centers on their electronic properties across various redox states, with a specific focus on potential through&#8208;space electronic coupling and global aromaticity. Experimental measurements, including UV&#8208;vis&#8208;NIR electronic absorption, NMR, ESR spectra, and X&#8208;ray diffraction, combined with theoretical calculations, reveal that both the neutral compounds and their tetracations exhibit a closed&#8208;shell ground state. However, their dications manifest as diradical dications with a subtle magnetic exchange interaction. Consequently, the through&#8208;space electronic coupling facilitated by the pCp unit in their respective ground states appears to be weak.

&lt;p&gt;[2,2]paracyclophane (pCp) bridged, thiophene-based macrocycles were sythesisized, and their electronic properties at diffferent oxidation states were investigated. The dications are open-shell diradical dications, while the tetracations have closed-shell ground state. There is almost no through-space electronic coupling through the pCp units, and thus no global aromaticity.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study of through-space electronic coupling in &#960;-conjugated systems remains an underexplored area. In this work, we present the facile synthesis of two isomeric macrocycles (&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;) bridged by [2,2]paracyclophane (pCp) and based on thiophene. The structures of these macrocycles have been confirmed through X-ray crystallographic analysis. Our investigation centers on their electronic properties across various redox states, with a specific focus on potential through-space electronic coupling and global aromaticity. Experimental measurements, including UV-vis-NIR electronic absorption, NMR, ESR spectra, and X-ray diffraction, combined with theoretical calculations, reveal that both the neutral compounds and their tetracations exhibit a closed-shell ground state. However, their dications manifest as diradical dications with a subtle magnetic exchange interaction. Consequently, the through-space electronic coupling facilitated by the pCp unit in their respective ground states appears to be weak.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>&#948;&#8208;bonding and spin&#8208;orbit coupling make SrAg4Sb2 a topological insulator</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal&#8208;metal &#948; bonding creates a band inversion in the layered phase SrAg4Sb2 which makes a topological crystalline insulator. Spin&#8208;orbit coupling splits a degenerate pair of &#948;* bands which have an avoided crossing with a &#963; band. This is a new insight into the chemical origin of topological materials.







Abstract
Bonding interactions and spin&#8208;orbit coupling in the topological insulator SrAg4Sb2 are investigated using DFT with orbital projection analysis. Ag&#8722;Ag delta bonding is a key ingredient in the topological insulating state because the 
 delta antibonding band forms a band inversion with the 5&#8197;s sigma bonding band. Spin&#8208;orbit coupling is required to lift d orbital degeneracies and lower the antibonding band enough to create the band inversion. These bonding effects are enabled by a longer&#8208;than&#8208;covalent Ag&#8722;Ag distance in the crystal lattice, which might be a structural characteristic of other transition metal based topological insulators. A simplified model of the topological bands is constructed to capture the essence of the topological insulating state in a way that may be engineered in other materials.

         <title>Regio&#8208; and Enantioselective Synthesis of 1,2&#8208;Diamines by Formal Hydroamination of Enamines: Scope, Mechanism, and Asymmetric Synthesis of Orthogonally Protected Bis&#8208;Piperazines as a Privileged Scaffold</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chiral 1,2&#8208;diamines are an important structural motif in organic synthesis, and can be prepared by an efficient Cu&#8722;H catalyzed asymmetric hydroamination of enamines. The applicability of the hydroamination protocol is demonstrated by an asymmetric synthesis of a MC&#8208;4 receptor antagonist. The origin of the excellent enantioselectivity is investigated using DFT calculations.







Abstract
We have previously reported the first formal hydroamination of enamines for the synthesis of chiral 1,2&#8208;diamines. Here, we describe: (i) the discovery, optimization, and substrate expansion of this reaction; (ii) a novel and straightforward protocol for the &#8220;click&#8208;type&#8221; synthesis of enamines in quantitative yield utilizing sodium sulfate in a dual role as an ancillary and dehydrating agent without the need for workup or purification; (iii) the application of this methodology to the first enantioselective synthesis of orthogonally protected 1,1&#8242;&#8208;(1&#8208;(4&#8208;fluorophenyl)ethane&#8208;1,2&#8208;diyl) piperazines, a scaffold for rapid lead optimization in drug discovery; (iv) a computational investigation into the mechanism and rationalization of the enantioselectivities of the reaction.

         <dc:description>Supercapacitor is an important energy storage device widely used in the automobile industry, military production, and communication equipment because of its fast charge&#8208;discharge rate, and high power density. Herein, carbon quantum dots modified and Y3+ doped Ni3(NO3)2(OH)4 (NiY@CQDs) nanospheres are prepared by a solvothermal method and used as an electrode material. The electrochemical properties of NiY@CQDs were measured in a three&#8208;electrode system. An asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) cell was assembled with activated carbon (AC) as the anode and NiY@CQDs as the cathode. The electrochemical properties of the ASC device were measured in a two&#8208;electrode system. Experimental results show the shape of NiY@CQDs is petal&#8208;shaped and the introducing carbon quantum dots and doping Y3+ significantly increases the specific surface area, conductivity, and specific capacitance of Ni3(NO3)2(OH)4. The mass&#8208;specific capacitance of NiY@CQDs reaches up to 2944 F&#183;g&#8208;1 at a current density of 1 A&#183;g&#8208;1. The asymmetric supercapacitor of NiY@CQDs//AC has a high energy density of 138.65 Wh&#183;kg&#8722;1 at a power density of 1500 W&#183;kg&#8722;1, displaying a wide range of application prospects in the energy storage area.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Although the 3d transition&#8208;metal catalyzed C&#8722;H functionalization have been extensively employed to promote the formation of valuable carbon&#8208;carbon bonds, the persistent problems, including the use of sensitive Grignard reagents and the rigorous operations (solvent&#8208;drying, inert gas protection, metal pre&#8208;activation and RMgX addition rate control), still leave great room for further development of sustainable methodologies.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Surface&#8208;enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) spectroscopy, a highly sensitive technique for detecting trace&#8208;level analytes, relies on plasmonic substrates. The choice of substrate, its morphology, and the excitation wavelength are crucial in SERS applications. To address advanced SERS requirements, the design and use of efficient nanocomposite substrates have become increasingly important. Notably, magnetic&#8208;plasmonic (MP) nanocomposites, which combine magnetic and plasmonic properties within a single particle system, stand out as promising nanoarchitectures with versatile applications in nanomedicine and SERS spectroscopy. In this review, we present an overview of MP nanocomposite fabrication methods, explore surface functionalization strategies, and evaluate their use in SERS. Our focus is on how different nanocomposite designs, magnetic and plasmonic properties, and surface modifications can significantly influence their SERS&#8208;related characteristics, thereby affecting their performance in specific applications such as separation, environmental monitoring, and biological applications. Reviewing recent studies highlights the multifaceted nature of these materials, which have great potential to transform SERS applications across a range of fields, from medical diagnostics to environmental monitoring. Finally, we discuss the prospects of MP nanocomposites, anticipating favorable developments that will make substantial contributions to various scientific and technological areas.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Metal&#8208;organic cages (MOCs) are supramolecular coordination complexes that have internal cavities for hosting guest molecules and exhibiting various properties. However, the functions of MOCs are limited by the choice of the building blocks. Post&#8208;synthetic modification (PSM) is a technique that can introduce new functional groups and replace existing ones on the MOCs without changing their geometry. Among many PSM methods, covalent PSM is a promising approach to modify MOCs with tailored structures and functions. Covalent PSM can be applied to either the internal cavity or the external surface of the MOCs, depending on the functionality expected to be customized. However, there are still some challenges and limitations in the field of covalent PSM of MOCs, such as the balance between the stability of MOCs and the harshness of organic reactions involved in covalent PSMs. This concept article introduces the organic reaction types involved in covalent PSM of MOCs, their new applications after modification, and summarizes and provides an outlook of this research field.</dc:description>

         <title>Generalist versus Specialist Self&#8208;Replicators</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Darwinian evolution, including the selection of the fittest species under given environmental conditions, is a major milestone in the development of synthetic living systems. In this regard, generalist or specialist behavior (the ability to replicate in a broader or narrower, more specific food environment) are of importance. Here we demonstrate generalist and specialist behavior in dynamic combinatorial&#160; libraries composed of a peptide&#8208;based and an oligo(ethylene glycol) based building block. Three different sets of macrocyclic replicators could be distinguished based on their supramolecular organization: two prepared from a single building block as well as one prepared from an equimolar mixture of them. Peptide&#8208;containing hexamer replicators were found to be generalists, i.e. they could replicate in a broad range of food niches, whereas the octamer peptide&#8208;based replicator and hexameric ethyleneoxide&#8208;based replicator were proven to be specialists, i.e. they only replicate in very specific food niches that correspond to their composition. However, sequence specificity cannot be demonstrated for either of the generalist replicators. The generalist versus specialist nature of these replicators was linked to their supramolecular organization. Assembly modes that accommodate structurally different building blocks lead to generalist replicators, while assembly modes that are more restrictive yield specialist replicators.</dc:description>

         <title>Stereocontrol via Propeller Chirality in FLP&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Utilization of chiral frustrated Lewis pairs as catalysts in enantioselective hydrogenation of unsaturated molecules represents a promising approach in asymmetric synthesis. In our effort to improve our current understanding of the factors governing the stereoselectivity in these catalytic processes, herein we examined the mechanism of direct hydrogenation of aromatic enamines catalyzed by a binaphthyl&#8208;based chiral amino&#8208;borane. Our computational analysis reveals that only one particular conformer of the key borohydride reaction intermediate can be regarded as a reactive form of this species. This borohydride conformer has a well&#8208;defined chiral propeller shape, which induces facial selectivity in the hydride transfer to pro&#8208;chiral iminium intermediates. The propeller chirality of the reactive borohydride conformer is generated by the axially chiral binaphthyl scaffold of the amino&#8208;borane catalyst through stabilizing&#160;&#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking interactions. This new computational insight can be readily used to interpret the high degree of stereoinduction observed for these reactions. We expect that the concept of chirality relay could be further exploited in catalyst design endeavors.</dc:description>

         <title>Structure and Photophysics of N&#8208;Tolanyl&#8208;phenochalcogenazines and their Radical Cations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The study focuses on the structural and photophysical characteristics of neutral and oxidized forms of N&#8208;tolanyl&#8208;phenochalcogenazines PZX&#8208;tolan with X = O, S, Se, and Te. X&#8208;ray crystal structure analyses show a pseudo&#8208;equatorial (pe) structure of the tolan substituent in the O, S, and Se dyads, while the Te dyad possesses a pseudo&#8208;axial (pa) structure. DFT calculations suggest the pe structure for O and S, and the pa structure for Se and Te as stable forms. Steady&#8208;state and femtosecond&#8208;time resolved optical spectroscopy in toluene solution indicate that the O and S dyads emit from a CT state, whereas the Se and Te dyads emit from a tolan&#8208;localized state. The T1 state is tolan&#8208;localized in all cases, showing phosphorescence at 77 K. The heavy atom effect of chalcogens induces intersystem crossing from S1 to Tx, resulting in a decreasing S1 lifetime from 2.1 ns to 0.42 ps. The T1 states possess potential for singlet oxygen sensitization with a high quantum yield (ca. 40%) for the O, S, and Se dyads. Radical cations exhibit spin density primarily localized at the heterocycle. EPR measurements and quasirelativistic DFT calculations reveal a very strong g&#8208;tensor anisotropy, supporting the pe structure for the S and Se derivatives.</dc:description>

         <title>Divergent Reactivity of a Cyclic Bis&#8208;Hydridostannylene: A Masked Sn(I) Diradicaloid</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, reactivity studies of a cyclic bis&#8208;hydridostannylene [(ADC)SnH]2 (1&#8208;H2) (ADC = PhC{(NDipp)C}2; Dipp = 2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3) with various unsaturated organic substrates are reported. Reactions of terminal alkynes (RC&#8801;CH) with 1&#8208;H2 afford mixed acetylide&#8208;vinyl&#8208;functionalized bis&#8208;stannylenes via dehydrogenation and hydro&#173;stannylation. Treatment of 1&#8208;H2 with PhC&#8801;CCH3 gives a unique distannabarrelene via dehydrogenative C(sp3)&#8211;H stannylation and hydrostannylation of the C&#8801;CCH3 moiety. 1&#8208;H2 undergoes dehydro&#173;genative [2+2]&#8208;cycloaddition reactions with diphenylacetylene, azobenzene, acetone, benzophenone, and benzaldehyde to form the 1,4&#8208;distannabarrelene derivatives. The elimination of H2 in these reactions suggests the masked&#8208;diradical property of 1&#8208;H2. In fact, these [2+2]&#8208;cycloaddition products are also accessible on treatments of the Sn(I) diradicaloid [(ADC)Sn]2 (1) with appropriate reagents. All compounds have been characterized by multinuclear NMR spectroscopy and single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. Moreover, the catalytic activity of 1&#8208;H2 has been shown for the hydroboration of unsaturated substrates.</dc:description>
