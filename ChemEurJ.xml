         <title>J&#8208;Aggregate&#8208;Triggering BODIPYs: an Ultrasensitive Chromogenic and Fluorogenic Sensing Platform for Perfluorooctanesulfonate</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Contamination of water supplies by polyfluoroalkyl substances, notably perfluorooctanesulfonate (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), has serious health and environmental consequences. Therefore, the development of straightforward and effective means of monitoring and removing PFASs is urgently required. In this study, we report a rapid and sensitive method for the detection of PFOS and PFOA in water that rely on the J&#8208;aggregate formation of meso&#8208;ester&#8208;BODIPY dyes. The dye C10&#8208;mim, which contains a hydrophilic methylimidazolium group and a hydrophobic alkylated BODIPY, self&#8208;assembles in water into weakly green&#8208;emissive micellar assemblies. Upon binding to PFOS or PFOA, a spontaneous disassembly and reorganization forms orange&#8208;emissive J&#8208;aggregates. The rapid formation (&#8804;&#160;5 s) of J&#8208;aggregates and the accompanying spectral shifts provide a superior sensing performance, with excellent sensitivity (limit of detection = 0.18 ppb for PFOS) and distinct chromogenic and fluorogenic &#8220;turn&#8208;on&#8221; responses.</dc:description>

         <title>Enrichment Strategies for Efficient CO2 Electroreduction in Acidic Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enriching CO2 and key intermediates around the catalyst surface can promote the reaction rate and selectivity, providing a promising way to boost the performance of CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR). In this review, the key technique challenges of acidic CO2RR are first introduced. Then, the critical progress of the enrichment strategy for promoting the acidic CO2RR is summarized with three aspects: catalyst design, electrolyte regulation, and electrolyzer optimization. Finally, some insights and perspectives for further development of enrichment strategy in acidic CO2RR are expounded.







Abstract
Electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) has been recognized as an appealing route to remarkably accelerate the carbon&#8208;neutral cycle and reduce carbon emissions. Notwithstanding great catalytic activity that has been acquired in neutral and alkaline conditions, the carbonates generated from the inevitable reaction of the input CO2 with the hydroxide severely lower carbon utilization and energy efficiency. By contrast, CO2RR in an acidic condition can effectively circumvent the carbonate issues; however, the activity and selectivity of CO2RR in acidic electrolytes will be decreased significantly due to the competing hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Enriching the CO2 and the key intermediates around the catalyst surface can promote the reaction rate and enhance the product selectivity, providing a promising way to boost the performance of CO2RR. In this review, the catalytic mechanism and key technique challenges of CO2RR are first introduced. Then, the critical progress of enrichment strategies for promoting the CO2RR in the acidic electrolyte is summarized with three aspects: catalyst design, electrolyte regulation, and electrolyzer optimization. Finally, some insights and perspectives for further development of enrichment strategies in acidic CO2RR are expounded.

         <title>A General Strategy for Increasing the Air Stability of Phosphines Including Primary Phosphines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Singling out the singlet: A general approach for increasing the air&#8208;stability of various primary phosphines in the absence of kinetic stabilization is presented based on the quenching of singlet oxygen. It proves singlet oxygen to be the key initiator in the oxidation of phosphines.







Abstract
A general approach for increasing the air&#8208;stability of various primary phosphines in the absence of kinetic stabilization is presented that contrasts with previous interpretations, which were limited to specific phosphines. This contribution shows the synthesis of a series of air&#8208;stable primary phosphines Fc(CH2)nPH2, where n=0,1,2,3; and Fc=ferrocenyl, and their corresponding isolable primary phosphine oxides. It was demonstrated that the ferrocene moiety exerts an antioxidant effect on the primary phosphine group, which is intermolecular, solvent dependent and increases with the electron density on the ferrocene moiety. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the presence of ferrocene in solution also inhibits the oxidation of other secondary and tertiary phosphines in air. Together our findings suggest that quenching of singlet oxygen is the actual reason for the antioxidant effect; this was experimentally confirmed by using other established singlet oxygen quenchers, thus demonstrating a key role of singlet oxygen in the aerobic oxidation of phosphines.

         <title>Synthesis and Anticancer Activity of Phosphinoylated and Phosphonoylated N&#8208;Heterocycles Obtained by the Microwave&#8208;Assisted Palladium Acetate&#8208;Catalyzed Hirao Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The bromo derivatives of 9&#8208;phenyl&#8208;9H&#8208;carbazoles and an indoline were converted to the corresponding phosphonoyl and phosphinoyl derivatives by the microwave&#8208;assisted &#8220;P&#8208;ligand&#8208;free&#8221; Hirao P&#8722;C coupling. A part of the fifteen phosphorylated N&#8208;heterocycles showed significant cytotoxic effect on A549 human non&#8208;small&#8208;cell lung carcinoma and MonoMac&#8208;6 acute monocytic leukemia cell cultures.







Abstract
A literature survey showed that different derivatives with the 9&#8208;phenyl&#8208;9H&#8208;carbazole or the dihydroindoline scaffold may be of biological activity including cytotoxic effect. Driven by this experience, P&#8208;functionalized derivatives of these N&#8208;heterocycles were synthesized. Three N&#8208;heterocycles, 9&#8208;(4&#8208;bromophenyl)&#8208;9H&#8208;carbazole, 3&#8208;bromo&#8208;9&#8208;phenyl&#8208;9H&#8208;carbazole and 1&#8208;(5&#8208;bromoindolin&#8208;1&#8208;yl)ethan&#8208;1&#8208;one, were coupled with dialkyl phosphites and diarylphosphine oxides using Pd(OAc)2 (10&#8201;%) as the catalyst precursor and triethylamine as the base in ethanol under microwave irradiation. The excess of the Y2P(O)H reagent (Y=alkoxy, aryl) (30&#8201;%) served as the P&#8208;ligand in its trivalent tautomeric form (Y2POH), hence there was no need for the usual P&#8208;ligands meaning cost and environmental burden. Hence, the presented method is a &#8220;green&#8221; approach that proved to be more efficient than the preparation by the traditional method. The products, dialkyl phosphonates and tertiary phosphine oxides obtained in 58&#8211;84&#8201;% yields were characterized, one of them also by single crystal X&#8208;ray analysis, and were subjected to in&#8197;vitro biological activity evaluation. A (carbazol)yl&#8208;phenylphosphonate, an N&#8208;phenyl&#8208;(carbazol)yl&#8208;phosphonate, a (carbazol)yl&#8208;phenylphosphine oxide and an N&#8208;phenyl&#8208;(carbazol)ylphosphine oxide revealed a significant cytotoxic activity on A549 human non&#8208;small&#8208;cell lung carcinoma and MonoMac&#8208;6 acute monocytic leukemia cancer cells. The cytotoxic effect was significant as compared to that of the reference compounds.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Direct spectroscopic detection of the chirality&#8208;induced spin selectivity (CISS) effect can shed light on the complex relationship between chirality and electron spin. This work deals with the photophysical investigation of novel D&#8208;&#967;&#8208;A dyads, comprising pyrene (D) and fullerene (A) connected by chiral saturated peptide bridges (&#967;) of different length and electric dipole moment.







Abstract
Over the past two decades, the chirality&#8208;induced spin selectivity (CISS) effect was reported in several experiments disclosing a unique connection between chirality and electron spin. Recent theoretical works highlighted time&#8208;resolved Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (trEPR) as a powerful tool to directly detect the spin polarization resulting from CISS. Here, we report a first attempt to detect CISS at the molecular level by linking the pyrene electron donor to the fullerene acceptor with chiral peptide bridges of different length and electric dipole moment. The dyads are investigated by an array of techniques, including cyclic voltammetry, steady&#8208;state and transient optical spectroscopies, and trEPR. Despite the promising energy alignment of the electronic levels, our multi&#8208;technique analysis reveals no evidence of electron transfer (ET), highlighting the challenges of spectroscopic detection of CISS. However, the analysis allows the formulation of guidelines for the design of chiral organic model systems suitable to directly probe CISS&#8208;polarized ET.

         <title>Surface Modification Functionalized Carbon Dots</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Carbon dot materials are widely used in optoelectronic parts, biomedicine and detection fields because of their excellent optical properties. However, the performance of unmodified CDs materials in various fields of application is unsatisfactory. Therefore, there is an urgent need to review the construction methods of surface modification strategies for functional CDs materials in order to promote the continuous development of this field.







Abstract
Carbon dots (CDs) smaller than 10&#8197;nm constitute a new type of fluorescent carbon&#8208;based nanomaterial. They have attracted much attention owing to their unique structures and excellent photoelectric properties. Primitive CDs usually comprise carbon and oxygen and are synthesized in one step from various natural products or synthetic organic compounds, usually via microwave or hydrothermal methods. However, the uniformity of surface functional groups often make CDs lack the diversity of active sites required for specific applications. Therefore, the functionalization of CDs by specific groups is a powerful strategy for improving their photophysical and photochemical properties. This paper reviews surface modification strategies to overcome these shortcomings. Functionalizing CDs using covalent or non&#8208;covalent modification can give them unique properties and broaden their applicability.

         <title>The Calculation of Both Electrostatic and Van der Waals Effects to Probe the Efficiency of Solvent Extraction of Heterocyclic Aromatics from Heavy Oil</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
To resolve the contradiction between denitrification efficiency and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) loss due to complex interactions, a combined model is proposed to evaluate the extraction performance in experiments. It is essential for the preparation of low nitrogen feedstock for a wide range of carbon materials.







Abstract
Due to the complex composition and similar structure, the extraction denitrification of aromatic rich oil is faced with the contradiction problem of denitrification efficiency and aromatic loss which cannot be efficiently solved by experiments. However, the complex interactions involved can be analyzed from the perspective of calculation, and the prediction criteria and methods are proposed. Based on rigorous density functional theory calculation data, Simple models based on electrostatic potential (ESP) and Van der Waals potential (VdWP)&#8208;based calculations were established and validated. The twofold model provided the best prediction for interactions between extractants and nitrogen compounds and between extractants and aromatics, which determines denitrification efficiency and aromatic loss, respectively, due to the most complete description of both electrostatic and VdW force. This provides a powerful tool for evaluating the non&#8208;covalent interactions and thence tuning the efficiency of the separation process. Thus, high denitrification efficiency (43.2~66.3&#8201;%) and moderate aromatic loss (1.7~4.4&#8201;%) were obtained using screened deep eutectic solvents (DESs). This ideal observation provided the potential for mild hydrodesulfurization and manufacture of high&#8208;grade carbon materials.

         <title>Synthesis and Characterization of Quinone Compounds Derived from Doubly and Triply Linked Diporphyrins and Tuning of Their Absorption Properties
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel quinones derived from two types of diporphyrins (diporphyrinquinones D and T) have been synthesized and characterized. D exhibits broad panchromatic absorption properties with significant red&#8208;shifts to 1300&#8197;nm upon metalation, whereas T exhibits intense and sharp absorption bands, along with a small absorption peak at longer wavelengths.







Abstract
Porphyrins are attracting increasing attention in materials science and photochemistry owing to their unique properties and diverse applications. This study focuses on modifying and tuning the absorption properties of porphyrins, specifically those of quinoidal porphyrins, to extend their spectral range into the near&#8208;infrared (NIR) region. We report the synthesis and structural and physical properties of quinone compounds derived from doubly and triply linked diporphyrins and their metal complexes. Doubly linked diporphyrinquinone exhibits broad panchromatic absorption properties in solution owing to its low symmetry. Metal complexation markedly extends its absorption range into the near&#8208;infrared region. In contrast, the metal complexes of the triply linked diporphyrinquinones exhibit sharp and strong absorption bands in the visible to near&#8208;infrared region owing to their higher symmetry. The longest absorption wavelength of the triply linked diporphyrinquinones was approximately 1500&#8197;nm, which was significantly more red&#8208;shifted than that of the doubly linked ones.

         <title>Iron(II) Complexes of P3&#8208;Chain Ligands: Structural Diversity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Iron(II) complexes containing a R2P&#8722;P&#8722;PR2 unit were synthetized. The binding modes of the triphosphane ligands can be changed by the size of the substituents. The products were characterized by NMR spectroscopy and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction.







Abstract
Iron(II) complexes containing ligands with a R2P&#8722;P&#8722;PR2 unit were synthesized by metathesis reactions. With R=tBu, a mixture of two isomers is formed; in one of them, the terminal phosphorus binds to the Fe center (ylidic structure), while in the other one, the central P atom is linked to Fe. Starting from differently functionalized parent triphosphanes and corresponding functionalized Fe complexes, the ratio of isomers does not change. The outcome of the reaction and therefore the binding modes of the triphosphane ligands in the resulting compounds can be influenced by the size of the substituents. In the case of R=iPr a chelate complex is formed (both terminal P atoms are linked to the Fe center). Applying the mixed&#8208;substituted triphosphane, the ylidic structure of the resulting complex is preferred. The new compounds were characterized by NMR spectroscopy in solution and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction in solid&#8208;state. The synthetic work was supported by DFT calculations.

         <title>Graphene Oxide Nanosheets Hamper Glutamate Mediated Excitotoxicity and Protect Neuronal Survival In An In vitro Stroke Model</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In vitro models of ischemic stroke based on the cell damage of dissociated central nervous system cultures due to glucose and oxygen deprivation (OGD) or to the exposure to a high concentration of glutamate (Glut) were used to establish that s&#8208;GO, applied during the glutamate mediated excitotoxic cascade, by modulating synaptic over&#8208;activity, exerts a protective effect, thus promoting neuronal survival and integrity.







Abstract
Small graphene oxide (s&#8208;GO) nanosheets reversibly downregulate central nervous system (CNS) excitatory synapses, with potential developments as future therapeutic tools to treat neuro&#8208;disorders characterized by altered glutamatergic transmission.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;In vitro models of ischemic stroke&lt;/b&gt; based on the cell damage of dissociated central nervous system cultures due to glucose and oxygen deprivation (OGD) or to the exposure to a high concentration of glutamate (Glut) were used to establish that s-GO, applied during the glutamate mediated excitotoxic cascade, by modulating synaptic over-activity, exerts a protective effect, thus promoting neuronal survival and integrity.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Small graphene oxide (s-GO) nanosheets reversibly downregulate central nervous system (CNS) excitatory synapses, with potential developments as future therapeutic tools to treat neuro-disorders characterized by altered glutamatergic transmission. Excitotoxicity, namely cell death triggered by exceeding ambient glutamate fueling over-activation of excitatory synapses, is a pathogenic mechanism shared by several neural diseases, from ischemic stroke to neurodegenerative disorders. In this work, CNS cultures were exposed to oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) to mimic ischemic stroke &lt;i&gt;in&#8197;vitro&lt;/i&gt;, and it is show that the delivery of s-GO following OGD, during the endogenous build-up of secondary damage and excitotoxicity, improved neuronal survival. In a different paradigm, excitotoxicity cell damage was reproduced through exogenous glutamate application, and s-GO co-treatment protected neuronal integrity, potentially by directly downregulating the synaptic over-activation brought about by exogenous glutamate. This proof-of-concept study suggests that s-GO may find novel applications in therapeutic developments for treating excitotoxicity-driven neural cell death.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <dc:description>
Amides can be converted into gem&#8208;difluoroalkenes. The reaction involves interaction of &#945;&#8208;chloroiminium salts with difluorinated phosphorus ylide formed from difluorocarbene and triphenylphosphine.







Abstract
A metal&#8208;free one&#8208;pot process for the gem&#8208;difluoroolefination of amides is described. The reaction is based on interaction of generated in&#8197;situ &#945;&#8208;chloroiminium salts with difluorinated phosphorus ylide formed from difluorocarbene and triphenylphosphine. The olefination involves nucleophile&#8208;assisted dephosphorylation and proceeds within one hour at low temperature. The gem&#8208;difluoroenamines were used in further transformations leading to a variety of fluoroalkylated amines.

         <title>Synergistic Activation of Inert Iron Oxide Basal Planes through Heterostructure Formation and Doping for Efficient Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Ni&#8722;Fe2O3/CeO2 HSs catalyst was synthesized via a facile solvothermal reaction and subsequent annealing process. The catalyst demonstrated exceptional stability and hydrogen evolution activity, which can be attributed to the synergistic activation of the basal planes of iron oxide through heterostructure engineering and nickel doping. Furthermore, the incorporation of nickel into the catalyst conferred low&#8208;temperature resistance, with high HER activity even at 0&#8201;&#176;C.







Abstract
Iron oxides have emerged as a very promising and cost&#8208;effective alternative to precious metal catalysts for hydrogen production. However, the inert basal plane of iron oxides needs to be activated to enhance their catalytic efficiency. In this study, we employed heterostructure engineering and doped nickel to cooperatively activate the basal planes of iron oxide (Ni&#8722;Fe2O3/CeO2 HSs) to achieve high hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity. The Ni&#8722;Fe2O3/CeO2 HSs electrocatalyst demonstrates excellent basic HER activity and stability, such as an extremely low overpotential of 43&#8197;mV at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 current density and corresponding Tafel slope of 58.6&#8197;mV&#8201;dec&#8722;1. The increase in electrocatalyst activity and acceleration of hydrogen precipitation kinetics arises from the dual modulation of Ni doping and heterostructure, which not only modulates the electrocatalyst&#8216;s electronic structure, but also increases the number and exposure of active sites. Remarkably, the generation of heterogeneous structure makes the catalyst se. The Ni&#8208;doped catalyst has not only increased HER activity but also low&#8208;temperature resistance. These results suggest that the synergistic activation of inert iron oxide basal planes through heterostructure formation and doping is a feasible strategy. Furthermore, for efficient electrocatalytic water splitting, this technique can be extended to other non&#8208;noble metal oxides.

         <title>Photoinduced &#945;&#8208;Aminoalkylation of Sulfonylarenes with Alkylamines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
&#945;&#8208;Aminoalkylation of sulfonylarenes with alkylamines was found to proceed successfully in the presence of a base in MeOH under photoirradiation, giving a wide variety of &#945;&#8208;arylalkylamines. The reaction is initiated by photolysis of the S&#8722;Ar bond of sulfonylarenes leading to generation of &#945;&#8208;aminoalkyl radicals, which get into a radical chain to give &#945;&#8208;arylalkylamines.







Abstract
&#945;&#8208;Aminoalkylation of sulfonylarenes with alkylamines was found to be induced by photoirradiation. Here various types of alkylamines, such as trialkylamines, dialkylamines, N,N&#8208;dialkylanilines and N&#8208;alkylanilines as well as sulfonylarenes containing an azole, azine, heterole or benzene ring are available. The reaction proceeds through a homolytic aromatic substitution (HAS) process consisting of addition of an &#945;&#8208;aminoalkyl radical to a sulfonylarene and elimination of the sulfonyl radical to give the &#945;&#8208;arylalkylamine, where photoirradiation is considered to induce homolysis of sulfonylarenes leading to the generation of &#945;&#8208;aminoalkyl radicals that make a radical chain operative.

         <title>Mechanism of CO2 Reduction to Methanol with H2 on an Iron(II)&#8208;scorpionate Catalyst</title>

CO2 to methanol: Density functional theory calculations on the mechanism of the reduction of CO2 by H2 on an iron(II) center show the reaction to proceed through heterolytic cleavage of H2, whereby the ligand holds the proton during the reaction.







Abstract
CO2 utilization is an important process in the chemical industry with great environmental power. In this work we show how CO2 and H2 can be reacted to form methanol on an iron(II) center and highlight the bottlenecks for the reaction and what structural features of the catalyst are essential for efficient turnover. The calculations predict the reactions to proceed through three successive reaction cycles that start with heterolytic cleavage of H2 followed by sequential hydride and proton transfer processes. The H2 splitting process is an endergonic process and hence high pressures will be needed to overcome this step and trigger the hydrogenation reaction. Moreover, H2 cleavage into a hydride and proton requires a metal to bind hydride and a nearby source to bind the proton, such as an amide or pyrazolyl group, which the scorpionate ligand used here facilitates. As such the computations highlight the non&#8208;innocence of the ligand scaffold through proton shuttle from H2 to substrate as an important step in the reaction mechanism.

         <title>Fate of Oxidation States at Actinide Centers in Redox&#8208;Active Ligand Systems Governed by Energy Levels of 5&#8201;f Orbitals</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The direct reduction of NpVIO22+ to NpIV is facilitated by the interaction of NpVIO22+ with the redox&#8208;active ligand H2(tBu&#8208;pdiop), while the complexation of UVIO22+ with H2(tBu&#8208;pdiop) did not induce the reduction of UVIO22+. The different reactivity can be explained by the decrease of the energy of the 5&#8201;f orbitals in Np compared to those in U.







Abstract
We report the formation of a NpIV complex from the complexation of NpVIO22+ with the redox&#8208;active ligand tBu&#8208;pdiop2&#8722;=2,6&#8208;bis[N&#8208;(3,5&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;2&#8208;hydroxyphenyl)iminomethyl]pyridine. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first example of the direct complexation&#8208;induced chemical reduction of NpVIO22+ to NpIV. In contrast, the complexation of UVIO22+ with tBu&#8208;pdiop2&#8722; did not induce the reduction of UVIO22+, not even after the two&#8208;electron electrochemical reduction of [UVIO2(tBu&#8208;pdiop)]. This contrast between the Np and U systems may be ascribed to the decrease of the energy of the 5&#8201;f orbitals in Np compared to those in U. The present findings indicate that the redox chemistry between UVIO22+ and NpVIO22+ should be clearly differentiated in redox&#8208;active ligand systems.

         <title>The First Planar, Not Twisted, Distannene &#8722; A Structural Alkene Analog. Synthesis, Isolation and X&#8208;ray Crystallography Characterization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of the first planar non&#8208;twisted distannene 6 is reported. The X&#8208;ray molecular structure of 6 reveals a planar geometry of both Sn atoms (&#931;&#8737;Sn=359.87&#176;), a non&#8208;twisted Sn=Sn bond, and the shortest Sn=Sn bond of 2.599&#8197;&#197; among all known acyclic distannenes. Thus, 6 is the first distannene having a structure closely analogous to a classic alkene.







Abstract
The tetrasilyl&#8208;substituted distannene, (tBu2HSi)2Sn=Sn(SiHtBu2)2 6, was synthesized by mild thermolysis (70&#8201;&#176;C in hexane) of tris(di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;hydridosilyl)stannane 4. The X&#8208;ray crystallography structure of 6 reveals the following unusual structural properties: a planar geometry around both Sn atoms (&#931;&#8737;Sn=359.87&#176;), a non&#8208;twisted Sn=Sn double bond, and the shortest Sn=Sn double bond of 2.599&#8197;&#197; among all acyclic distannenes. Thus, compound 6 is the first reported distannene having a structure closely analogous to a classic alkene. Reactions of 6 with CCl4 or with 2,3&#8208;dimethylbuta&#8208;1,3&#8208;diene to produce 1,2&#8208;dichlorodistannane 9 and the [2+4] cycloadduct 10, respectively, are characteristic for a Sn=Sn double bond.

         <dc:description>
A cycloaddition&#8211;retro&#8208;electrocyclization (CA&#8208;RE) click reaction using nitrogen end&#8208;capped oligoynes is demonstrated. The reaction with tetracyanoetylene (TCNE) is fully regioselective and leads to TCBD (tetracyanobuta&#8208;1,3&#8208;diene&#8208;2,3&#8208;diyl) end&#8208;capped molecules. The optical and electronic properties of adducts were investigated and rationalized using DFT calculations.







Abstract
This study shows the first example of cycloaddition&#8211;retro&#8208;electrocyclization (CA&#8208;RE) click reaction involving nitrogen end&#8208;capped push&#8208;pull oligoynes. The reported CA&#8208;RE reaction with TCNE (tetracyanoethylene) is fully regioselective and leads exclusively to the unprecedented TCBD (tetracyanobuta&#8208;1,3&#8208;diene&#8208;2,3&#8208;diyl) end&#8208;capped carbon rods. The molecular structure of the products was unambiguously confirmed using X&#8208;ray single crystal diffraction and their optical and electronic properties were investigated experimentally and rationalized using DFT (density functional theory) calculations.

         <title>Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Properties on a Bisbenzofuropyrazine Core: Mechanochromism and Concentration&#8208;Controlled Vapochromism</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel &#960;&#8208;core system: bent&#8208;shaped bisbenzofuropyrazines were easily synthesized by the palladium&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular double cyclization reaction. The unsubstituted derivative shows good solubility in spite of its rigid planar structure and provides three polymorphs with different mechanochromic luminescent properties. A ground sample of the sec&#8208;butylated derivative exhibits concentration&#8208;dependent unique vapochromic luminescent behavior.







Abstract
Stimulus&#8208;responsive organic materials with luminescence switching properties have attracted considerable attention for their practical applications in sensing, security, and display devices. In this paper, bent&#8208;type bisbenzofuropyrazine derivatives, Bent&#8208;H and Bent&#8208;sBu, with good solubilities were synthesized, and their physical and optical properties were investigated in detail. Bent&#8208;H gave three crystalline polymorphs, and they showed different luminescence properties depending on their crystal packing structures. In addition, Bent&#8208;H exhibited mechanochromic luminescence in spite of its rigid skeleton. Bent&#8208;sBu exhibited unique concentration&#8208;dependent vapochromic luminescence. Ground Bent&#8208;sBu was converted to blue&#8208;emissive, green&#8208;emissive, and green&#8208;emissive high&#8208;viscosity solution states at low, moderate, and high concentrations of CHCl3 vapor, respectively. This finding represents a concentration&#8208;dependent multi&#8208;phase transition with an organic solvent, which is of potent interest for application in sensing systems.

         <title>Highly Flexible and Self&#8208;Healing Supercapacitor Enabled by Physically Crosslinking Polymer Hydrogel Electrolyte</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hydrogel with outstanding mechanical properties and self&#8208;healing ability based on poly N&#8208;hydroxyethyl acrylamide (PHEAA) is fabricated as electrolyte for supercapacitors. The supercapacitor is obtained with flexibility and self&#8208;healing ability, retaining 80&#8201;% specific capacitance after five cutting&#8208;healing cycles. Three supercapacitors in series could drive a parallel circuit of LED and clock.







Abstract
Preparation of flexible supercapacitors with excellent mechanical properties and self&#8208;healing properties is of great significance but still remains a challenge. A self&#8208;healable conductive hydrogel based on poly N&#8208;hydroxyethyl acrylamide (PHEAA) is fabricated as electrolyte for supercapacitors. The design of the physically cross&#8208;linked dual network, and rich hydrogen bonds endow the hydrogel with robust mechanical properties and strong self&#8208;healing ability. The hydrogel exhibited an excellent stretchability (723&#8201;%) and a high ionic conductivity (21.8&#8197;mS/cm). Specially, by in&#8197;situ growth of electrode film, a non&#8208;laminated supercapacitor is obtained with flexibility and self&#8208;healing ability. Due to the non&#8208;laminated structure, the supercapacitor can work stably under bending and punching. The supercapacitor possessed an areal capacitance of 253.1&#8197;mF/cm2 and the capacitance retention was 80&#8201;% after five cutting&#8208;healing cycles. The pseudo&#8208;capacitance contribution of the supercapacitor after self&#8208;healing was discussed. It is noteworthy that the supercapacitor maintains the ability to power a clock after self&#8208;healing.

The supercapacitor is obtained with flexibility and self-healing ability, retaining 80&#8201;% specific capacitance after five cutting-healing cycles. Three supercapacitors in series could drive a parallel circuit of LED and clock.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Preparation of flexible supercapacitors with excellent mechanical properties and self-healing properties is of great significance but still remains a challenge. A self-healable conductive hydrogel based on poly N-hydroxyethyl acrylamide (PHEAA) is fabricated as electrolyte for supercapacitors. The design of the physically cross-linked dual network, and rich hydrogen bonds endow the hydrogel with robust mechanical properties and strong self-healing ability. The hydrogel exhibited an excellent stretchability (723&#8201;%) and a high ionic conductivity (21.8&#8197;mS/cm). Specially, by in&#8197;situ growth of electrode film, a non-laminated supercapacitor is obtained with flexibility and self-healing ability. Due to the non-laminated structure, the supercapacitor can work stably under bending and punching. The supercapacitor possessed an areal capacitance of 253.1&#8197;mF/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and the capacitance retention was 80&#8201;% after five cutting-healing cycles. The pseudo-capacitance contribution of the supercapacitor after self-healing was discussed. It is noteworthy that the supercapacitor maintains the ability to power a clock after self-healing.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Chiral TPE Foldamers in Macrocycles: Aggregation Enhanced Emission and Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chiral TPE foldamers were first constructed through macrocycle architectonics and the chiroptical properties were investigated. Aggregation enhanced emission and unusual circularly polarized luminescence can be discovered due to the folded conformation.







Abstract
Chiral macrocycles with circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) have attracted increasing attention due to the rigid structure, symmetrical chiral geometry and large luminescence dissymmetry factors (glum). However, most chiral macrocycles are more emissive in solutions but have weakened fluorescence quantum yields (&#934;F) in aggregates, limiting their further application. In this paper, chiral macrocycle R/S&#8208;PhTPE was synthesized by combining chiral macrocycle architectonics with Z&#8208;o&#8208;phenyltetraphenylethylene (PhTPE) foldamer. Enhanced solution state emission and characteristic aggregation enhanced emission (AEE) effect can be observed for R/S&#8208;PhTPE due to the folded PhTPE conformation. Macrocycle immobilization and folded conformation endow PhTPE moiety with stable helical conformation. Most importantly, R/S&#8208;PhTPE exhibits opposite CPL signals compared with common chiral TPEs, demonstrating the evident impact of folded conformation. This work reports the first and deep insights into the chiroptical properties of chiral PhTPE foldamers, and will provide a new strategy to tune &#934;F and CPL signals of AIE active chiral macrocycles.

         <title>Polymorphism and Light&#8208;Driven Forward Movement of TPE Derivative Micro&#8208;Crystal due to ArH&#8208;pi Interactions Difference</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
New TPE derivatives bearing p&#8208;AP groups: Among 5 kinds of crystals of TPE derivative, it is found for the first time that strong intermolecular ArH&#8208;pi interactions cause ACQ effect while weak ArH&#8208;pi interactions induce AIE phenomenon. The interactions also arouse photochromism, photodeformation and even the first forward rolling movement of crystal by UV light irradiation, providing promising materials in multimode anti&#8208;counterfeiting, photo&#8208;actuator and light&#8208;driven micro&#8208;vehicle.







Abstract
Aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) and aggregation&#8208;caused quenching (ACQ) are two classes of opposite luminescence phenomena. It is almost impossible to show both AIE and ACQ effect simultaneously by the same molecule. However, here we report that a simple TPE derivative TAP&#8208;TPE grows into both AIE crystals and ACQ ones. It is found that equatorial, contact distance&#8208;longer and weak ArH&#8208;&#960; interactions exist in AIE crystals while vertical, contact distance&#8208;shorter and strong ArH&#8208;&#960; interactions appear in ACQ crystals. Theoretical calculation of electron density on the interaction atoms unveils that ACQ crystals have much larger change in electron density than AIE ones, suggesting that the intermolecular electron transfer aroused by the strong ArH&#8208;&#960; hydrogen bonds leads to ACQ phenomenon. This result provides a new insight into the emission mechanism in aggregation state. Interestingly, due to the ArH&#8208;pi interactions difference, only one of five kinds of crystals shows rapid photochromism, and can act as multimode anti&#8208;counterfeiting materials. Very exceptionally, for the first time we find that the photochromic micrometric rod&#8208;like crystal even makes forward rolling movement as it repeatedly bends and straightens by responding to on and off of the ultraviolet light irradiation, displaying potential for photo&#8208;actuator and light&#8208;driven micro&#8208;vehicle.

         <title>Palladium Complexes of N&#8208;Methylcorroles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Opening the corrole door to divalent cations: Inner&#8208;core N&#8208;methylation of corrole makes this contracted macrocycle a dianionic ligand, facilitating the coordination of divalent cations, otherwise difficult for the charge mismatch with pristine corroles. Pd complexes are obtained in good yields, showing interesting optical features for their practical applications.







Abstract
Alkylation of one of the inner&#8208;core nitrogen atoms is one possible approach to obtain dianionic corrole ligands, suitable for the coordination of divalent metal ions, such as PdII. Inner&#8208;core N&#8208;methylation can be obtained by treating the corrole with CH3I, but the reaction conditions should be optimized to limit the formation of the dimethylated derivative. Two regioisomers, the N&#8208;21 and the N&#8208;22 methyl derivatives are obtained from the reaction, with the first product achieved in a higher amount. Structural characterization of the reaction products evidenced the distortion induced by the introduction of the methyl groups; the N&#8208;methylcorroles are chiral compounds, and the enantiomers were separated by chromatography, with their absolute configuration assigned by ECD computation. Palladium insertion was achieved in the case of monosubstituted corroles, but not with the dimethylated macrocycle; X&#8208;ray characterization of the complexes showed the distortion of the macrocycles. The Pd complexes do not show luminescence emission, but are able to produce singlet oxygen upon irradiation. The PdII complexes were also inserted in human serum albumin (HSA) and dispersed in water; in this case, the protein protects the corroles from photobleaching, and a switch from the type II to the type I mechanism in reactive oxygen species (ROS) production is observed.

Engaging strong electron acceptors in supramolecular donor&#8208;acceptor assembly to probe excited electron transfer. Metal&#8208;ligand axial coordination approach has been established to assemble zinc tetrapyrroles with TCBD/DCNQ to witness efficient electron transfer.







Abstract
Using the popular metal&#8208;ligand axial coordination self&#8208;assembly approach, donor&#8208;acceptor conjugates have been constructed using zinc tetrapyrroles (porphyrin (ZnP), phthalocyanine (ZnPc), and naphthalocyanine (ZnNc)) as electron donors and imidazole functionalized tetracyanobutadiene (Im&#8208;TCBD) and cyclohexa&#8208;2,5&#8208;diene&#8208;1,4&#8208;diylidene&#8208;expanded&#8208;tetracyanobutadiene (Im&#8208;DCNQ) as electron acceptors. The newly formed donor&#8208;acceptor conjugates were fully characterized by a suite of physicochemical methods, including absorption and emission, electrochemistry, and computational methods. The measured binding constants for the 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 complexes were in the order of 104&#8211;105&#8197;M&#8722;1 in o&#8208;dichlorobenzene. Free&#8208;energy calculations and the energy level diagrams revealed the high exergonicity for the excited state electron transfer reactions. However, in the case of the ZnNc:Im&#8208;DCNQ complex, owing to the facile oxidation of ZnNc and facile reduction of Im&#8208;DCNQ, slow electron transfer was witnessed in the dark without the aid of light. Systematic transient pump&#8208;probe studies were performed to secure evidence of excited state charge separation and gather their kinetic parameters. The rate of charge separation was as high as 1011&#8197;s&#8722;1 suggesting efficient processes. These findings show that the present self&#8208;assembly approach could be utilized to build donor&#8208;acceptor constructs with powerful electron acceptors, TCBD and DCNQ, to witness ground and excited state charge transfer, fundamental events required in energy harvesting, and building optoelectronic devices. In summary, the powerful electron acceptors, TCBD and DCNQ, were functionalized to have a nitrogenous ligand, imidazole, for axial coordination of metal tetrapyrroles. Three zinc tetrapyrroles, viz., ZnP, ZnPc, and ZnNc varying in their redox potentials and spectral coverage were engaged as electron donors. Optical absorption studies provided evidence of axial coordination that was supported by computational studies. The measured bindings constants were in the range of 104&#8211;105&#8197;M&#8722;1 suggesting stable complexation. The facile reduction of DCNQ and facile oxidation of ZnNc led to slow ground&#8208;state electron transfer in the coordinated complex. However, such a charge separation process was rapidly facilitated upon photoexcitation in all the assembled systems as determined by their kCS values. The measured kCS values followed the expected free&#8208;energy trends while the magnitude of their kCR suggested the process to belong to the normal region of Marcus parabola. Further studies along this line are in progress in our laboratories.

These findings show that the present self-assembly approach could be utilized to build donor-acceptor constructs with powerful electron acceptors, TCBD and DCNQ, to witness ground and excited state charge transfer, fundamental events required in energy harvesting, and building optoelectronic devices. In summary, the powerful electron acceptors, TCBD and DCNQ, were functionalized to have a nitrogenous ligand, imidazole, for axial coordination of metal tetrapyrroles. Three zinc tetrapyrroles, viz., &lt;b&gt;ZnP&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;ZnPc&lt;/b&gt;, and &lt;b&gt;ZnNc&lt;/b&gt; varying in their redox potentials and spectral coverage were engaged as electron donors. Optical absorption studies provided evidence of axial coordination that was supported by computational studies. The measured bindings constants were in the range of 10&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;&#8211;10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;&#8197;M&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; suggesting stable complexation. The facile reduction of DCNQ and facile oxidation of ZnNc led to slow ground-state electron transfer in the coordinated complex. However, such a charge separation process was rapidly facilitated upon photoexcitation in all the assembled systems as determined by their &lt;i&gt;k&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;CS&lt;/sub&gt; values. The measured &lt;i&gt;k&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;CS&lt;/sub&gt; values followed the expected free-energy trends while the magnitude of their &lt;i&gt;k&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;CR&lt;/sub&gt; suggested the process to belong to the normal region of Marcus parabola. Further studies along this line are in progress in our laboratories.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Isolated Dimers Versus Solid&#8208;State Dimers of N&#8208;Heteropolycycles: Matrix&#8208;Isolation Spectroscopy in Concert with Quantum Chemistry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this work, matrix isolation spectroscopy and quantum&#8208;chemical calculations are used together to analyse the structure and properties of weakly bound dimers of the two isomers benzo[a]acridine and benzo[c]acridine. Our measured experimental electronic absorbance spectra agree with simulated spectra calculated for the equilibrium structures of the dimers in gas&#8208;phase, but in contrast, disagree with the simulated spectra calculated for the structures obtained by optimising the experimental solid&#8208;state structures. This highlights the sensitivity of the electronic excitations with respect to the dimer structures. The comparison between the solid&#8208;state and gas&#8208;phase dimers shows how far the intermolecular interactions could change the geometric and electronic structure in a disordered bulk material or at device interfaces, imposing consequences for exciton and charge mobility and other material properties.</dc:description>

         <title>Metal&#8208;Metal Charge Transfer Properties of a Series of Trinuclear Fe2Ru and Corresponding Pentanuclear Fe2Ru2Ag Cyanido&#8208;Bridged Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 58, October 18, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
As the number of methyl groups on the cyclopentadiene of the terminal iron increases, the neighbouring RuII&#8594;FeIII MM&#8242;CT energy increases in both the trinuclear N4+ (FeIII&#8208;NC&#8208;RuII&#8208;CN&#8208;FeIII) and the pentanuclear M5+ (FeIII&#8208;NC&#8208;RuII&#8208;NC&#8208;AgI&#8208;CN&#8208;RuII&#8208;CN&#8208;FeIII) complexes, but the redox potential of the ruthenium in the pentanuclear system shows an opposite trend of change with respect to the corresponding trinuclear complexes.







Abstract
A series of trimetallic cyanidometal&#8208;bridged compounds [MenCp(dppe)FeII&#8208;(&#956;&#8208;NC)&#8208;RuII(MeOpy)4&#8208;(&#956;&#8208;CN)&#8208;FeII(dppe)CpMen] &#8208; [PF6]2 (N[PF6]2, n=0, N =1; n=1, N=2; n=3, N=3; Cp=cyclopentadiene, dppe=1,2&#8208;bis(diphenylphosphino)ethane, MeOpy=4&#8208;methoxypyridine) and their one&#8208; and two&#8208;electron oxidized compounds N3+ and N4+ were synthesized and characterized. Meanwhile, a series of corresponding linear cyanido&#8208;bridged pentanuclear compounds [MenCp(dppe)FeIII&#8208;(&#956;&#8208;NC)&#8208;RuII(MeOpy)4&#8208;(&#956;&#8208;NC)&#8208;AgI&#8208;(&#956;&#8208;CN)&#8208;RuII(MeOpy)4&#8208;(&#956;&#8208;CN)&#8208;FeIII(dppe)CpMen][BF4]5 (M[BF4]5, n=0, M=4; n=1, M=5; n=3, M=6) were also obtained and well characterized. The investigations suggest that in the trinuclear system there exists remote interaction between the two Fe centers, but no significant interactions exist across the central silver unit between the metals on the two sides of the silver center in the pentanuclear system. In both the trinuclear N4+ and the pentanuclear M5+ complexes, there exists the neighboring RuII&#8594;FeIII MM&#8242;CT transitions, and the MM'CT energy in the corresponding trinuclear system is higher than those in the pentanuclear system in which no remote metal&#8208;metal interaction occurs. Meanwhile, as the substituted methyl groups on the cyclopentadiene increases, the redox potential of the ruthenium in the trinuclear N4+ series increases, but that in the pentanuclear M5+ complexes decreases.

         <title>CO2 Activation with Manganese Tricarbonyl Complexes through an H&#8208;Atom Responsive Benzimidazole Ligand</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 58, October 18, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An alternative route for electrochemical carbon dioxide activation was discovered for a manganese tricarbonyl complex. This complex first undergoes an H&#8208;atom transfer through a non&#8208;innocent ancillary ligand before subsequent reductions towards CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion.







Abstract
Herein, we report the synthesis and characterization of two manganese tricarbonyl complexes, MnI(HL)(CO)3Br (1&#8201;a&#8208;Br) and MnI(MeL)(CO)3Br (1&#8201;b&#8208;Br) (where HL=2&#8208;(2&#8217;&#8208;pyridyl)benzimidazole; MeL=1&#8208;methyl&#8208;2&#8208;(2&#8217;&#8208;pyridy)benzimidazole) and assayed their electrocatalytic properties for CO2 reduction. A redox&#8208;active pyridine benzimidazole ancillary ligand in complex 1&#8201;a&#8208;Br displayed unique hydrogen atom transfer ability to facilitate electrocatalytic CO2 conversion at a markedly lower reduction potential than that observed for 1&#8201;b&#8208;Br. Notably, a one&#8208;electron reduction of 1&#8201;a&#8208;Br yields a structurally characterized H&#8208;bonded binuclear Mn(I) adduct (2&#8201;a&#8217;) rather than the typically observed Mn(0)&#8208;Mn(0) dimer, suggesting a novel method for CO2 activation. Combining advanced electrochemical, spectroscopic, and single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction techniques, we demonstrate the use of an H&#8208;atom responsive ligand may reveal an alternative, low&#8208;energy pathway for CO2 activation by an earth&#8208;abundant metal complex catalyst.

         <title>Preparation of Trimetallic&#8208;Organic Framework Film Electrodes via Secondary Growth for Efficient Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>

Via a secondary growth strategy, FeCoNi&#8208;btz/NF electrodes, integrating cationic MOF frameworks, trimetallic coupling effects together with continuous and dense morphology, are successfully fabricated for enhanced OER performance.







Abstract
Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) are promising electrocatalysts for clean energy conversion systems. However, developing MOF&#8208;based electrodes with high performance toward oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is still challenging. In this work, a series of MOF film electrodes derived from Ni&#8208;btz were prepared by employing the secondary growth strategy under solvothermal conditions. Fe and Co ions were also incorporated into the Ni&#8208;btz framework to produce a trimetallic coupling effect to obtain enhanced OER activity. The as&#8208;prepared FeCoNi&#8208;btz/NF exhibited not only good stability but also excellent OER performance under alkaline conditions. Furthermore, the possible intermediates including metal oxides and metal oxyhydroxides were confirmed by X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM).

         <title>Highly Functionalized SWCNTs with a Dopamine Derivative as a Support for Pd Nanoparticles: A Recyclable Catalyst for the Reduction of Nitro Compounds and the Heck Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 58, October 18, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The [3+2] cycloaddition reaction of dopamine azide on SWCNTs in o&#8208;DCB at 160&#8201;&#176;C gave a material with high degree of functionalization still maintaining &#960;&#8208;network of SWCNTs. The presence of the catechol units was exploited to immobilize palladium nanoparticles. The hybrid material was used as a recyclable catalyst for the reduction of nitro compounds and the Heck reaction.







Abstract
Single&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) were functionalized with a dopamine derivative in which the amine group was converted to azide (dopamine azide). The direct reaction of SWCNTs and dopamine azide in o&#8208;dichlorobenzene at high temperature (160&#8201;&#176;C) led to very highly functionalized CNTs (&#8776;60&#8197;wt.%). Surprisingly, despite this high degree of functionalization, Raman spectroscopy detected a low disruption of the &#960;&#8208;network of the carbonaceous support. This finding was justified by the rehybridization from sp3 to sp2 of the sidewall carbon atoms of CNTs involved in the functionalization process. Further characterization by means of different techniques such as X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) allowed to shed some light on the chemical composition and morphology of the obtained material. Moreover, the estimation of the total content of phenolic units and their reducing potential after CNTs functionalization was also assessed using Folin and Ciocalteu and 2,2&#8208;diphenyl&#8208;1&#8208;picryl hydrazide (DPPH) assays. The functionalization of CNTs was exploited to immobilize palladium(II) species that were subsequently reduced with NaBH4 leading to the formation of Pd nanoparticles (NPs). The so obtained hybrid material was used as a recyclable heterogeneous catalyst for the reduction of nitro compounds and the Heck reaction.

         <title>Transition Metal Ions Influence the Performance of Photodetector of Two&#8208;Dimensional CdS Nanoplatelets</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 58, October 18, 2023. </description>

The insertion of copper ions inside the two&#8208;dimensional CdS NPLs exhibits bright red photoluminescence and higher performance of photodetectors.







Abstract
Transition metal&#8208;doped two&#8208;dimensional (2D) semiconductor nanoplatelets (NPLs) with atomically precise thickness have attracted much research interest due to their inherent photo&#8208;physical properties. In this work, we have synthesized 2D Cu&#8208;doped CdS NPLs, investigated the charge transfer dynamics using ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy, and fabricated an efficient photodetector device. A large Stoke's shifted emission at ~685&#8197;nm with an average lifetime of about ~1.45&#8197;&#956;s is observed in Cu&#8208;doped CdS NPLs. Slower bleach recovery kinetics leads to large charge carrier separation in Cu&#8208;doped NPLs which is beneficial for photodetector applications. Cu&#8208;doped NPLs&#8208;based photodetectors exhibit high photocurrent, fast response (~120&#8197;ms), ~600&#8197;times higher photoresponsivity, and ~300&#8197;times higher detectivity (~4.1&#215;1013 Jones) than undoped CdS NPLs. These excellent properties of Cu&#8208;doped CdS NPLs make this material an efficient alternative for next&#8208;generation optoelectronic devices.

         <title>Modeling Reactivity of Nitrite and Nitrous Acid at a Phenolate Bridged Dizinc(II) Site: Insights into NO Signaling at Zinc</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 58, October 18, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nitric oxide from (in)organic nitrite at zinc(II): Reactions of a dizinc(II) coordination site with organonitrite or nitrous acid (RONO, R=tBu/amyl/H) result in the formation of a dark green colored arene&#8208;NO+ charge&#8208;transfer complex. One electron reductive transformation of the NO+ charge&#8208;transfer moiety and zinc(II)&#8208;nitrite complex towards NO, in the presence of exogenous reductants, have been illustrated.







Abstract
Although nitrite&#8208;to&#8208;NO transformation at various transition metals including Fe and Cu are relatively well explored, examples of such a reaction at the redox&#8208;inactive zinc(II) site are limited. The present report aims to gain insights into the reactivity of nitrite anions, nitrous acid (HONO), and organonitrite (RONO) at a dizinc(II) site. A phenolate&#8208;bridged dizinc(II)&#8208;aqua complex [LHZnII(OH2)]2(ClO4)2 (1H&#8208;Aq, where LH=tridentate N,N,O&#8208;donor monoanionic ligand) is illustrated to react with tBuONO to provide a metastable arene&#8208;nitrosonium charge&#8208;transfer complex 2H. UV&#8208;vis, FTIR, multinuclear NMR, and elemental analyses suggests the presence of a 2&#8201;:&#8201;1 arene&#8208;nitrosonium moiety. Furthermore, the reactivity of a structurally characterized zinc(II)&#8208;nitrite complex [LHZnII(ONO)]2 (1H&#8208;ONO) with a proton&#8208;source demonstrates HONO reactivity at the dizinc(II) site. Reactivity of both RONO (R=alkyl/H) at the phenolate&#8208;bridged dizinc(II) site provides NO+ charge&#8208;transfer complex 2H. Subsequently, the reactions of 2H with exogenous reductants (such as ferrocene, thiol, phenol, and catechol) have been illustrated to generate NO. In addition, NO yielding reactivity of [LHZnII(ONO)]2 (1H&#8208;ONO) in the presence of the above&#8208;mentioned reductants have been compared with the reactions of complex 2H. Thus, this report sheds light on the transformations of NO2&#8722;/RONO (R=alkyl/H) to NO/NO+ at the redox&#8208;inactive zinc(II) coordination motif.

         <title>Mechanical Interlocking to Unlock the Reinforcing Potential of Carbon Nanotubes</title>

Mechanically interlocked derivatives of single&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes (MINTs) improve the interaction between SWNT fillers and polymer matrix in nanocomposites. As a result, MINTs show improvements of more than 100&#8201;% on Youngs Modulus and tensile strength for polymers of different chemical nature. Classic supramolecular chemistry concepts can be used to understand the polymer&#8208;nanofiller interactions, opening the way to further optimization.







Abstract
Single&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) present extraordinary mechanical properties, with Youngs&#8217; modulus&gt;1&#8197;TPa and tensile strength&gt;50&#8197;GPa; this makes them ideal candidates as fillers for the reinforcement of polymers. However, the performance of SWNTs in this field has fallen behind expectations. This is due to a combination of imperfect individualization of the SWNTs and poor load transfer from the polymer to the SWNTs. Here, we study the reinforcement of polymers of different chemical nature using mechanically interlocked derivatives of single&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes (MINTs). We compare the mechanical properties of fibers made of poly (methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) and polysulfone (PSU) and their composites made with pristine SWNTs, MINTs, and the corresponding supramolecular models. With very low loading of MINTs (0.01&#8201;% w/w), improvements of more than 100&#8201;% on Youngs Modulus and the tensile strength are observed for both the nonpolar aliphatic PMMA and the very polar aromatic PSU polymers, while pristine carbon nanotubes and the supramolecular nanofillers showed smaller reinforcement. These data, together with our previous report on the reinforcement of polystyrene (nonpolar and aromatic), indicate that derivatization of SWNTs as MINTs is a valid general strategy to optimize the interaction between SWNT fillers and the polymer matrix.

         <title>Cyclotrimerization Approach to Symmetric [9]Helical Indenofluorenes: Diverting Cyclization Pathways</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 58, October 18, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Catalytic cyclotrimerization (Rh, Co, and Ni catalysts) of triyne 1 gives rise preferentially to [9]helical indenofluorene, whereas it thermal cyclization gives rise to polyaromatic hydrocarbon 3. The former reaction proceeds via classical alkyne cyclotrimerization, the latter via dehydro&#8208;Diels&#8211;Alder reaction accompanied by unusual C&#8722;C cleavage. DFT calculations shed light on the course of the reaction.







Abstract
Catalytic cyclotrimerization routes to symmetrical [9]helical indenofluorene were explored by using different transition&#8211;metal complexes and thermal conditions. Depending on the reaction conditions, the cyclotrimerizations were accompanied by dehydro&#8208;Diels&#8211;Alder reaction giving rise to another type of aromatic compounds. Structures of both symmetrical [9]helical cyclotrimerization product as well as the dehydro&#8208;Diels&#8211;Alder product were confirmed by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analyses. Limits of enantioselective cyclotrimerization were assessed as well. DFT calculations shed light on the reaction course and the origin of diminished enantioselectivity.

         <title>A 2,2&#8208;Difluoroimidazolidine Derivative for Deoxyfluorination Reactions: Mechanistic Insights by Experimental and Computational Studies</title>

Fluorination: The deoxyfluorinating agent SIMesF2 converts carboxylic acids into acyl fluorides and is capable of difluorinating aldehydes. Experimental and computational studies show that an imidazolidinium salt bearing an F(HF)2&#8722; anion serves as crucial intermediate.







Abstract
A N&#8208;heterocyclic deoxyfluorinating agent SIMesF2 was synthesized by nucleophilic fluorination of N,N&#8208;1,3&#8208;dimesityl&#8208;2&#8208;chloroimidazolidinium chloride (3) at room temperature. SIMesF2 was applied to deoxyfluorinate carboxylic acids and alcohols and convert benzaldehyde into difluorotoluene. Mechanistic studies by NMR spectroscopy suggest reaction pathways of the carboxylic acid to acyl fluoride via outer&#8208;sphere fluorinations at an imidazolidinium ion by polyfluoride. DFT studies give further insight by exploring mechanistic details which distinguish the fluorination of aldehydes from that of carboxylic acids. Furthermore, a consecutive reaction sequence for the oxidation of an aldehyde followed by in&#8197;situ fluorination of the generated carboxylic acid was developed.

         <title>Geometry&#8208;Independent Ultrafast Energy Transfer in Bioinspired Arrays Containing Electronically Coupled BODIPY Dimers as Energy Donors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 58, October 18, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bioinspired energy&#8208;transfer arrays composed of electronically coupled BODIPY dyads as energy donors and chlorins as energy acceptors feature ultrafast (~10&#8197;ps) energy transfer, which is consistent with the F&#246;rster mechanism. The energy&#8208;transfer rate in the arrays is nearly independent of the position at which energy donor is attached to the chlorin or of the nature of the intervening linker.







Abstract
In photosynthetic light&#8208;harvesting complexes, strong interaction between chromophores enables efficient absorption of solar radiation and has been suggested to enable ultrafast energy funneling to the reaction center. To examine whether similar effects can be realized in synthetic systems, and to determine the mechanisms of energy transfer, we synthesized and characterized a series of bioinspired arrays containing strongly&#8208;coupled BODIPY dimers as energy donors and chlorin derivatives as energy acceptors. The BODIPY dimers feature broad absorption in the range of 500&#8211;600&#8197;nm, complementing the chlorin absorption to provide absorption across the entire visible spectrum. Ultrafast (~10&#8197;ps) energy transfer was observed from photoexcited BODIPY dyads to chlorin subunits. Surprisingly, the energy&#8208;transfer rate is nearly independent of the position where the BODIPY dimer is attached to the chlorin and of the type of connecting linker. In addition, the energy&#8208;transfer rate from BODIPY dimers to chlorin is slower than the corresponding rate in arrays containing BODIPY monomers. The lower rate, corresponding to less efficient through&#8208;bond transfer, is most likely due to weaker electronic coupling between the ground state of the chlorin acceptor and the delocalized electronic state of the BODIPY dimer, compared to the localized state of a BODIPY monomer.

         <title>Alkyl Chains Modulated Magnetization Dynamics of Mononuclear Trigonal Prismatic CoII Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 58, October 18, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Modifying alkyl chains with different lengths at the end of the CoII&#8208;SMM with a rigid D3h coordination geometry influence its magnetization dynamics. Magneto&#8208;structural correlation study reveals that the various deviations of coordination symmetry of CoII ion, diverse crystal packings and possible different vibration modes of substituents caused by modifying alkyl chains are the key factors affecting the magnetization dynamics.







Abstract
Four benzeneboron&#8208;capped mononuclear CoII complexes with different alkyl substitutions on the fourth position of phenylboronic acid were obtained. The CoII ions are all wrapped by the pocket&#8208;like ligands and located in trigonal prismatic coordination geometries. Alternating&#8208;current magnetic susceptibility measurements reveal that they show different magnetization dynamics, such as distinct relaxation rates at the same temperature, the faster QTM rates for the ethyl and propyl substituted complexes, as well as different relaxation processes. Magneto&#8208;structural correlation study reveals that the various deviations of coordination geometry of CoII ion, diverse crystal packings and possible different vibration modes of substituents caused by modifying alkyl chains are the key factors affecting the magnetization dynamics. This work demonstrates that the alkyl chains even locating far away from the metal center can have a large impact on the magnetic behavior of the CoII complex with a very rigid coordination geometry, offering a new perspective towards transition metal based single&#8208;molecule magnets.

&lt;p&gt;Modifying alkyl chains with different lengths at the end of the Co&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt;-SMM with a rigid &lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Four benzeneboron-capped mononuclear Co&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt; complexes with different alkyl substitutions on the fourth position of phenylboronic acid were obtained. The Co&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt; ions are all wrapped by the pocket-like ligands and located in trigonal prismatic coordination geometries. Alternating-current magnetic susceptibility measurements reveal that they show different magnetization dynamics, such as distinct relaxation rates at the same temperature, the faster QTM rates for the ethyl and propyl substituted complexes, as well as different relaxation processes. Magneto-structural correlation study reveals that the various deviations of coordination geometry of Co&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt; ion, diverse crystal packings and possible different vibration modes of substituents caused by modifying alkyl chains are the key factors affecting the magnetization dynamics. This work demonstrates that the alkyl chains even locating far away from the metal center can have a large impact on the magnetic behavior of the Co&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt; complex with a very rigid coordination geometry, offering a new perspective towards transition metal based single-molecule magnets.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Catalytic amounts of bis(&#951;5&#8201;:&#8201;&#951;1&#8208;pentafulvene)titanium in the reaction with Lewis base&#8208;stabilized phosphinoborane monomers provide a convenient new route to polyphosphinoboranes. This method offers access to high molecular mass materials under very mild conditions and short reaction times. The findings represent an unprecedented example of a transition&#8208;metal mediated polymerization of Lewis base&#8208;stabilized alkylphosphinoborane.







Abstract
The reaction of the Lewis base&#8208;stabilized phosphinoborane monomer tBuHPBH2NMe3 (2&#8201;a) with catalytic amounts of bis(&#951;5:&#951;1&#8208;adamantylidenepentafulvene)titanium (1) provides a convenient new route to the polyphosphinoborane [tBuPH&#8208;BH2]n (3&#8201;a). This method offers access to high molar mass materials under mild conditions and with short reaction times (20&#8201;&#176;C, 1&#8197;h in toluene). It represents an unprecedented example of a transition metal&#8208;mediated polymerization of a Lewis base&#8208;stabilized Group 13/15 compound. Preliminary studies of the substrate scope and a potential mechanism are reported.

         <title>Synchronous Proton&#8208;Hydride Transfer by a Pyrazole&#8208;Functionalized Protic Mn(I) Complex in Catalytic Alcohol Dehydrogenative Coupling</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 58, October 18, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A protic Mn(I) complex featuring pyrazole functionality was evaluated for dehydrogenative coupling reactions to access benzimidazole and quinoline derivatives. Kinetic experiments and DFT calculations reveal that the initial alcohol dehydrogenation step proceeds through a concerted proton and hydride transfers to pyrazolato N and Mn, respectively, on the metal&#8208;ligand construct.







Abstract
A series of Mn(I) complexes Mn(L1)(CO)3Br, Mn(L2)(CO)3Br, Mn(L1)(CO)3(OAc) and Mn(L3)(CO)3Br [L1=2&#8208;(5&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;1H&#8208;pyrazol&#8208;3&#8208;yl)&#8208;1,8&#8208;naphthyridine, L2=2&#8208;(5&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;1H&#8208;pyrazol&#8208;3&#8208;yl)pyridine, L3=2&#8208;(5&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;1&#8208;methyl&#8208;1H&#8208;pyrazol&#8208;3&#8208;yl)&#8208;1,8&#8208;naphthyridine] were synthesized and fully characterized. The acid&#8208;base equilibrium between the pyrazole and the pyrazolato forms of Mn(L1)(CO)3Br was studied by 1H NMR and UV&#8208;vis spectra. These complexes are screened as catalysts for acceptorless dehydrogenative coupling (ADC) of primary alcohols and aromatic diamines for the synthesis of benzimidazole and quinoline derivatives with the release of H2 and H2O as byproducts. The protic complex Mn(L1)(CO)3Br shows the highest catalytic activity for the synthesis of 2&#8208;substituted benzimidazole derivatives with broad substrate scope, whereas a related complex [Mn(L3)(CO)3Br], which is devoid of the proton responsive &#946;&#8208;NH unit, shows significantly reduced catalytic efficiency validating the crucial role of the &#946;&#8208;NH functionality for the alcohol dehydrogenation reactions. Control experiments, kinetic and deuterated studies, and density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal a synchronous hydride&#8208;proton transfer by the metal&#8208;ligand construct in the alcohol dehydrogenation step.

         <title>Heterocyclic [9]Helicenes Exhibiting Bright Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>

Easy access to brightly blue fluorescent [9]helicenes! The CPL brightness reaches up to 17&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;1 as measured experimentally and verified computationally, which makes this the highest CPL brightness among heterocyclic helicenes.







Abstract
We describe a concise synthetic strategy for the preparation of heterocyclic [9]helicenes and a simple preparative&#8208;scale protocol for the optical resolution of the resulting M&#8208; and P&#8208;enantiomers. The helicenes were characterized by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction along with a range of spectroscopic and computational techniques. A fluorescence quantum yield of up to 65&#8201;% was observed, and the chiroptical properties of both M&#8208; and P&#8208;helicenes revealed large dissymmetry factors. The circularly polarized luminescence brightness reaches up to 17&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;1, as measured experimentally and verified computationally, which makes this the highest circularly polarized luminescence brightness among heterocyclic helicenes. We describe how chiroptical properties (both circular dichroism and circularly polarized luminescence) can be described and predicted using quantum chemical calculations. The synthetic approach also reveals by&#8208;products that originate from internal oxidation reactions, presumably mediated by the close proximity of the &#960;&#8208;surfaces in the helicene structure.

         <title>Controlling the Morphological Features, Aspect Ratio and Emission Patterns of Supramolecular Copolymers by Restricted Dimensional Growth</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 58, October 18, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The spontaneous 1D polymerization of a PE derivative and the 2D polymerization of a BODIPY derivative is controlled by copolymerizing them in different ratios, leading to unusual spindle&#8208;shaped structures with controlled aspect ratio. The resultant supramolecular copolymers exhibit morphology and aspect ratio dependent emission features.







Abstract
One of the bottlenecks associated with supramolecular polymerization of functional &#960;&#8208;systems is the spontaneous assembly of monomers leading to one&#8208; or two&#8208;dimensional (1D or 2D) polymers without control over chain length and optical properties. In the case of supramolecular copolymerization of monomers that are structurally too diverse, preferential self&#8208;sorting occurs unless they are closely interacting donor&#8208;acceptor pairs. Herein, it is established that the spontaneous 1D polymerization of a phenyleneethynylene (PE) derivative and the 2D polymerization of a Bodipy derivative (BODIPY) can be controlled by copolymerizing them in different ratios, leading to unusual spindle&#8208;shaped structures with controlled aspect ratio, as evident by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) studies. For example, when the content of BODIPY is 50&#8201;% in the BODIPY&#8208;PE mixture, the 1D polymerization of PE is significantly restricted to form elongated spindle&#8208;like structures having an aspect ratio of 4&#8211;6. The addition of 75&#8201;% of BODIPY to PE resulted in circular spindles having an aspect ratio of 1&#8211;2.5, thereby completely restricting the 1D polymerization of PE monomers.

     alt="Controlling the Morphological Features, Aspect Ratio and Emission Patterns of Supramolecular Copolymers by Restricted Dimensional Growth"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The spontaneous 1D polymerization&lt;/b&gt; of a &lt;b&gt;PE&lt;/b&gt; derivative and the 2D polymerization of a &lt;b&gt;BODIPY&lt;/b&gt; derivative is controlled by copolymerizing them in different ratios, leading to unusual spindle-shaped structures with controlled aspect ratio. The resultant supramolecular copolymers exhibit morphology and aspect ratio dependent emission features.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the bottlenecks associated with supramolecular polymerization of functional &#960;-systems is the spontaneous assembly of monomers leading to one- or two-dimensional (1D or 2D) polymers without control over chain length and optical properties. In the case of supramolecular copolymerization of monomers that are structurally too diverse, preferential self-sorting occurs unless they are closely interacting donor-acceptor pairs. Herein, it is established that the spontaneous 1D polymerization of a phenyleneethynylene (&lt;b&gt;PE&lt;/b&gt;) derivative and the 2D polymerization of a Bodipy derivative (&lt;b&gt;BODIPY&lt;/b&gt;) can be controlled by copolymerizing them in different ratios, leading to unusual spindle-shaped structures with controlled aspect ratio, as evident by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) studies. For example, when the content of &lt;b&gt;BODIPY&lt;/b&gt; is 50&#8201;% in the &lt;b&gt;BODIPY&lt;/b&gt;-&lt;b&gt;PE&lt;/b&gt; mixture, the 1D polymerization of &lt;b&gt;PE&lt;/b&gt; is significantly restricted to form elongated spindle-like structures having an aspect ratio of 4&#8211;6. The addition of 75&#8201;% of &lt;b&gt;BODIPY&lt;/b&gt; to &lt;b&gt;PE&lt;/b&gt; resulted in circular spindles having an aspect ratio of 1&#8211;2.5, thereby completely restricting the 1D polymerization of &lt;b&gt;PE&lt;/b&gt; monomers. Moreover, the resultant supramolecular copolymers exhibited morphology and aspect ratio dependent emission features as observed by the time-resolved emission studies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Stretched Central Double Bonds in Dialumene and Disilene by Amino Substituents: A Case of Lone Pair Repulsion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 58, October 18, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The block&#8208;localized wavefunction method at the density functional theory level is employed to study dialumene and disilene bearing two amino substituents. The origin of the significantly stretched central M=M (M=Al or Si) double bonds in these molecules is the repulsion between the lone electron pairs of amino substituents and M=M &#960; bond. Replacing the substituent groups &#8722;NH2 with &#8722;BH2 can enhance the planarity and shorten the central double bonds due to the absence of lone pair electrons in BH2.







Abstract
There have been remarkable advances in the syntheses and applications of groups 13 and 14 homonuclear ethene analogues. However, successes are largely limited to aryl&#8208; and/or silyl&#8208;substituted species. Analogues bearing two or more heteroatoms are still scarce. In this work, the block&#8208;localized wavefunction (BLW) method at the density functional theory (DFT) level was employed to study dialumene and disilene bearing two amino substituents whose optimal geometries exhibit significantly stretched central M=M (M=Al or Si) double bonds compared with aryl&#8208; and/or silyl&#8208;substituted species. Computational analyses showed that the repulsion between the lone electron pairs of amino substituents and M=M &#960; bond plays a critical role in the elongation of the M=M bonds. Evidently, replacing the substituent groups &#8722;NH2 with &#8722;BH2 can enhance the planarity and shorten the central double bonds due to the absence of lone pair electrons in BH2.

         <title>Beta Amyloid Oligomers with Higher Cytotoxicity have Higher Sidechain Dynamics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 58, October 18, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The chemical states of the residues from K16 to K28 are different between the 10&#8208;nm and 23&#8208;nm beta amyloid oligomers. We find that the 10&#8208;nm oligomers are more cytotoxic, and the sidechain molecular motion of the residue K16 is more dynamic. Our data raise an interesting possibility that the cytotoxicity of A&#946;40 oligomers could also be correlated to the motional dynamics of the sidechains.







Abstract
The underlying biophysical principle governing the cytotoxicity of the oligomeric aggregates of &#946;&#8208;amyloid (A&#946;) peptides has long been an enigma. Here we show that the size of A&#946;40 oligomers can be actively controlled by incubating the peptides in reverse micelles. Our approach allowed for the first time a detailed comparison of the structures and dynamics of two A&#946;40 oligomers of different sizes, viz., 10 and 23&#8197;nm, by solid&#8208;state NMR. From the chemical shift data, we infer that the conformation and/or the chemical environments of the residues from K16 to K28 are different between the 10&#8208;nm and 23&#8208;nm oligomers. We find that the 10&#8208;nm oligomers are more cytotoxic, and the molecular motion of the sidechain of its charged residue K16 is more dynamic. Interestingly, the residue A21 exhibits unusually high structural rigidity. Our data raise an interesting possibility that the cytotoxicity of A&#946;40 oligomers could also be correlated to the motional dynamics of the sidechains.

         <title>Diiminium Nucleophile Adducts Are Stable and Convenient Strong Lewis Acids
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 58, October 18, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Diiminium nucleophile adducts, convenient Lewis acids that satisfy some measures for superacidity, have been synthesised by coordination with stabilising pyridine donors. Even in their abstraction of half an equivalent of oxide from a P=O bond, favourable abstraction kinetics were observed. Our preliminary results combined with price and safety considerations suggest that the adducts are excellent acylation reagents.







Abstract
Strong Lewis acids are essential tools for manifold chemical procedures, but their scalable deployment is limited by their costs and safety concerns. We report a scalable, convenient, and inexpensive synthesis of stable diiminium&#8208;based reagents with a Lewis acidic carbon centre. Coordination with pyridine donors stabilises these centres; the 2,2&#8217;&#8208;bipyridine adduct shows a chelation effect at carbon. Due to high fluoride, hydride, and oxide affinities, the diiminium pyridine adducts are promising soft and hard Lewis acids. They effectively produce acylpyridinium salts from carboxylates that can acylate amines to give amides and imides even from electronically intractable coupling partners.

         <title>Alternating Stereospecificity upon Central&#8208;Atom Change: Dynamics of the F&#8722;+PH2Cl SN2 Reaction Compared to its C&#8208; and N&#8208;Centered Analogues</title>

         <dc:description>
Dynamical central&#8208;atom effects in SN2 reactions are investigated, with special regard to stereochemistry, by preforming quasi&#8208;classical trajectory simulations on a novel full&#8208;dimensional ab initio potential energy surface for the F&#8722;+PH2Cl reaction, as well as by comparing its dynamics and mechanisms to the N&#8208; and C&#8208;centered analogues.







Abstract
Central&#8208;atom effects on bimolecular nucleophilic substitution (SN2) reactions are well&#8208;known in chemistry, however, the atomic&#8208;level SN2 dynamics at phosphorous (P) centers has never been studied. We investigate the dynamics of the F&#8722;+PH2Cl reaction with the quasi&#8208;classical trajectory method on a novel full&#8208;dimensional analytical potential energy surface fitted on high&#8208;level ab initio data. Our computations reveal intermediate dynamics compared to the F&#8722;+CH3Cl and the F&#8722;+NH2Cl SN2 reactions: phosphorus as central atom leads to a more indirect SN2 reaction with extensive complex&#8208;formation with respect to the carbon&#8208;centered one, however, the title reaction is more direct than its N&#8208;centered pair. Stereospecificity, characteristic at C&#8208;center, does not appear here either, due to the submerged front&#8208;side&#8208;attack retention path and the repeated entrance&#8208;channel inversional motion, whereas the multi&#8208;inversion mechanism discovered at nitrogen center is also undermined by the deep Walden&#8208;well. At low collision energies, 6&#8201;% of the PH2F products form with retained configuration, mostly through complex&#8208;mediated mechanisms, while this ratio reaches 24&#8201;% at the highest energy due to the increasing dominance of the direct front&#8208;side mechanism and the smaller chance for hitting the deep Walden&#8208;inversion minimum. Our results suggest pronounced central&#8208;atom effects in SN2 reactions, which can fundamentally change their (stereo)dynamics.

Our results suggest pronounced central-atom effects in S&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;2 reactions, which can fundamentally change their (stereo)dynamics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>One Ligand to Bind them All: S~C~S2&#8722; Carbon&#8208; and Sulfur&#8208;Based Gem&#8208;Dianion as Structuring Ligand for Iron Polymetallic Assemblies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 58, October 18, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bis&#8208;(diphenylthiophosphinoyl)methanediide dianion (SCS)2&#8722; is an ideal platform for the building of polymetallic iron assemblies in which the same carbon and sulfur environment is maintained upon redox states changes and nuclearity increase. Such a variety of structures with a same C&#8208;based ligand is unique in the frame or nitrogenase cofactor models.







Abstract
Numerous synthetic models of the FeMo&#8208;co cluster of nitrogenases have been proposed to find the simplest structure with relevant reactivity. Indeed, such structures are able to perform multi&#8208;electrons reduction processes, such as the conversion of N2 to ammonia, and of CO2 into methane and alkenes. The most challenging parameter to imitate is indeed the central carbide ligand, which is believed to maintain the integrity of iron sulfide assembly during the course of catalytic cycles. The study proposes the use of bis(diphenylthiophosphinoyl)methanediide (SCS)2&#8722; as an ideal platform for the synthesis of bi&#8208; and tetra&#8208;metallic iron complexes, in which the iron&#8208;carbon interaction is maintained upon structural diversification and redox state changes.

         <title>Cobalt&#8208;Catalyzed Decarboxylative Allylations: Development and Mechanistic Studies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 58, October 18, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sustainable catalysis: The development of a cobalt&#8208;catalyzed decarboxylative allylation of nitrophenyl alkanes, nitroalkanes, and ketones is accomplished. The protocol offers the regioselective synthesis of various allylated products with broad functional group tolerance. Mechanistic studies revealed an unusual activation of Co(II)&#8208;salts using new organoreductants.







Abstract
In recent years, there has been a concerted drive to develop methods that are greener and more sustainable. Being an earth&#8208;abundant transition metal, cobalt offers an attractive substitute for commonly employed precious metal catalysts, though reactions engaging cobalt are still less developed. Herein, we report a method to achieve the decarboxylative allylation of nitrophenyl alkanes, nitroalkanes, and ketones employing cobalt. The reaction allows for the formation of various substituted allylated products in moderate&#8208;excellent yields with a broad scope. Additionally, the synthetic potential of the methodology is demonstrated by the transformation of products into versatile heterocyclic motifs. Mechanistic studies revealed an in&#8197;situ activation of the Co(II)/dppBz precatalyst by the carboxylate salt to generate a Co(I)&#8208;species, which is presumed to be the active catalyst.

         <title>Activation of the GaI Cation for Bond Activation: from Oxidative Additions into C&#8722;Cl and H&#8722;P Bonds to Reversible Insertion into P4</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 58, October 18, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Umpolung of the GaI cation: A GaI pincer complex allows significantly different reactivity compared to other known cationic GaI complexes. First controlled oxidative additions of the GaI cation into C&#8722;Cl, H&#8722;P, and P&#8722;P bonds are presented, as well as cycloaddition reactions to 1,3&#8208;dienes. Intriguingly, the insertion into the P4 cluster was discovered to be reversible.







Abstract
Although the discovery of the GaI complex salt [Ga(PhF)2&#8208;3][Al(ORF)4] (RF=C(CF3)3, PhF=C6H5F) invoked the preparation of a diverse library of cationic Ga(I) coordination complexes and clusters, studies on small molecule activation with low&#8208;valent GaI cations are scarce. Herein, a first experimental study on the reactivity of a monomeric Ga(I) cation activated with a pyridine&#8211;diimine pincer ligand (in [Ga(PDIdipp)][Al(ORF)4]) towards small&#8208;molecules is reported. First controlled oxidative additions of the GaI cation into C&#8722;Cl, H&#8722;P and P&#8722;P bonds are presented. Moreover, the [4+1]cycloaddition to butadienes was achieved. Intriguingly, the isolated, blue insertion product into the P&#8722;P bond of P4 allows for the quantitative release of the P4 molecule upon reaction with AlEt3 and butadienes. Reversible P4 insertion of main&#8208;group metals has previously been reported for Ge and Sn, respectively. The experimental study is supported by high&#8208;level computational analysis of the in&#8208;part reversible oxidative additions at the DLPNO&#8208;CCSD(T)/def2&#8208;TZVPP//PBEh&#8208;3c/def2&#8208;mSVP level of theory with COSMO&#8208;RS solvation in 1,2&#8208;difluorobenzene.

         <title>A Versatile Route to Acyl (MIDA)Boronates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 58, October 18, 2023. </description>

Exploiting the reactivity of the novel acetyl (MiDA)boronate radical allows access to a broad range of acyl (MIDA)boronates, which in suitable cases can be converted into B(MIDA) substituted furans and pyrroles.







Abstract
A modular approach to highly functional acyl (MIDA)boronates is described. It involves the generation of the hitherto unknown radical derived from acetyl (MIDA)boronate and its capture by various alkenes, including electronically unbiased, unactivated alkenes. In contrast to the anion of acetyl (MIDA)boronate, which has not so far been employed in synthesis, the corresponding radical is well behaved and readily produced from the novel &#945;&#8208;xanthyl acetyl (MIDA)boronate. This shelf&#8208;stable, easily prepared solid is a convenient acyl (MIDA)boronate transfer agent that provides a direct entry to numerous otherwise inaccessible structures, including latent 1,4&#8208;dicarbonyl derivatives that can be transformed into B(MIDA) substituted pyrroles and furans. A competition experiment indicated the acyl (MIDA)boronate substituted radical to be more stable than the all&#8208;carbon acetonyl radical but somewhat less reactive in additions to alkenes.

Dicationic diiminium pyridine adducts distinctively concentrate their positive charges at the diiminium carbon atom, a characteristic vividly portrayed in their molecular electrostatic potential. They are easily handled and synthesized. In their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202302089), F.&#8197;F. Mulks and co&#8208;workers showcase the adducts&#8217; prominence as potent Lewis acids, particularly in facilitating dehydration reactions like amide and imide couplings. Artwork: F.F.M., &#8220;FM009&#8221;, digital and acrylic on paper.

Direction signs show a driver which turn to take to reach the desired destination. In a similar manner, the course of triyne cyclization can be diverted by the appropriate choice of reaction conditions: catalysis promotes the [2+2+2] cyclotrimerization pathway, whereas high temperatures induce a dehydro&#8208;Diels&#8211;Alder reaction. More information can be found in the Research Article by M. Hapke, M. Kotora, and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202301491).

         <title>Hydrofluorination of Alkynes: From (E) to (Z)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 58, October 18, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The hydrofluorination of alkynes provides direct access to synthetically useful monofluoroalkenes and difluoroalkanes. This review showcases the developments on this subject, from early work to recent advances on various substrates.







Abstract
The hydrofluorination of alkynes is an efficient synthetic route to monofluoroalkenes or difluoroalkanes. Both fluorinated motifs have found applications in medicinal chemistry and beyond. This review explores the recent advances in the hydrofluorination of diverse alkynes through various activation methods, from classical coinage metal catalysis to metal&#8208;free conditions. The range of alkynes goes from the simplest unactivated alkynes to activated ones (ynones and derivatives, ynamides, alkynyl sulfides and sulfones as much as haloalkynes). Regio&#8208; and stereoselective methods exists, but there is still room for improvement depending on the type of alkyne.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 58, October 18, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Golden synthons in organometallic synthesis. In this review, key gold&#8208;NHC complexes employed in organometallic synthesis are discussed in detail (NHC=N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene). Besides their synthesis, the uses of these synthons as mechanistic probes are presented, as are their applications as efficient (pre&#8208;)catalysts, antitumor agents and/or photoemissive materials.







Abstract
The prominent role of gold&#8208;N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) complexes in numerous research areas such as homogeneous (photo)catalysis, medicinal chemistry and materials science has prompted organometallic chemists to design gold&#8208;based synthons that permit access to target complexes through simple synthetic steps under mild conditions. In this review, the main gold&#8208;NHC synthons employed in organometallic synthesis are discussed. Mechanistic aspects involved in their synthesis and reactivity as well as applications of gold&#8208;NHC synthons as efficient pre&#8208;catalysts, antitumor agents and/or photo&#8208;emissive materials are presented.

         <title>Localized Crystallization of Calcium Phosphates by Light&#8208;Induced Processes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
4&#8208;Nitrophenylphosphate and calcium chloride were included inside an aqueous gel matrix for light&#8208;induced precipitation processes and the resulting calcium phosphate precisely reproduces the irradiated areas. These findings can contribute to more sophisticated reaction control in localized crystallization processes of calcium phosphate containing biomaterials. Scale bar 1&#8197;mm.







Abstract
Medical treatment options for bones and teeth can be significantly enhanced by taking control over the crystallization of biomaterials like hydroxyapatite in the healing process. Light&#8208;induced techniques are particularly interesting for this approach as they offer tremendous accuracy in spatial resolution. However, in the field of calcium phosphates, light&#8208;induced crystallization has not been investigated so far. Here, proof of principle is established to successfully induce carbonate&#8208;hydroxyapatite precipitation by light irradiation. Phosphoric acid is released by a photolabile molecule exclusively after irradiation, combining with calcium ions to form a calcium phosphate in the crystallization medium. 4&#8208;Nitrophenylphosphate (4NPP) is established as the photolabile molecule and the system is optimized and fully characterized. A calcium phosphate is crystallized exclusively by irradiation in aqueous solution and identified as carbonate apatite. Control over the localization and stabilization of the carbonate apatite is achieved by a pulsed laser, triggering precipitation in calcium and 4NPP&#8208;containing gel matrices. The results of this communication open up a wide range of new opportunities, both in the field of chemistry for more sophisticated reaction control in localized crystallization processes and in the field of medicine for enhanced treatment of calcium phosphate containing biomaterials.

         <title>Frustrated Lewis Pair Chelation in the p&#8208;Block</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Frustrated Lewis pairs (FLPs) have been at the forefront of main group element&#8208;mediated small molecule activation for over 15&#8197;years. The utility of intramolecular FLPs as chelating ligands for the stabilization of low oxidation state p&#8208;block elements has been comparatively less explored. This review highlights recent progress in this emerging field and highlights spaces for further development.







Abstract
Frustrated Lewis pairs (FLPs) have been the subject of considerable study since the field's inception. While much of the research into FLPs has centered around small molecule activation for diverse stoichiometric and catalytic transformations, intramolecular FLPs also show promise as chelating ligands. The cooperative action of Lewis basic and acidic moieties enables intramolecular FLPs to stabilize low oxidation state centers and (consequently) reactive molecular fragments through a donor&#8208;acceptor approach, making them an attractive ligand class in main group element chemistry. This review outlines the state of FLP chelation to date throughout the p&#8208;block, encompassing primarily groups 13&#8211;16.

         <title>Photocatalytic Hydrodecarboxylation of Fatty Acids for Drop&#8208;in Biofuels Production</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Renewable hydrocarbons were obtained through photocatalytic hydrodecarboxylation of fatty acids using a simple and robust method. This process, which employs the synergistic catalysis of acridine and thiophenol under visible light, enabled the production of a C9&#8722;C17 hydrocarbon blend compatible with biojet fuel from a mixture of fatty acids obtained through the hydrolysis of a vegetable oil.







Abstract
A mild, practical, and environmentally friendly method for the hydrodecarboxylation of fatty acids using an acridine&#8208;based photoredox catalyst and thiophenol was developed. Cn&#8208;1 alkanes were synthesized in good to excellent yields (up to 99&#8201;%) from C10&#8722;C18 saturated fatty acids under visible light irradiation (405&#8197;nm). The developed protocol was employed for a mixture of fatty acids obtained from the hydrolysis of Licuri oil, affording a mixture of C9&#8722;C17 hydrocarbons in quantitative yield, which demonstrates the potential application of the method to produce drop&#8208;in biofuels.

         <title>Defluorinative 1,3&#8208;Dienylation of Fluoroalkyl N&#8208;Triftosylhydrazones with Homoallenols</title>

Defluorinative 1,3&#8208;dienylation: A carbene strategy for the defluorinative 1,3&#8208;dienylation of fluoroalkyl N&#8208;triftosylhydrazones is reported. This method allowed for the preparation of &#945;&#8208;fluoro&#8208;&#946;&#8208;vinyl allyl ketones in high yield with excellent functional group tolerance.







Abstract
A silver&#8208;catalyzed regioselective defluorinative 1,3&#8208;dienylation of trifluoromethyl phenyl N&#8208;triftosylhydrazones using homoallenols as 1,3&#8208;dienyl sources provides a variety of &#945;&#8208;(di)fluoro&#8208;&#946;&#8208;vinyl allyl ketones with excellent functional group tolerance in moderate to good yields. The reaction proceeds through a silver carbene&#8208;initiated sequential etherification and Claisen type [3,3]&#8208;sigmatropic rearrangement cascade. The synthetic utility of this protocol was demonstrated through the downstream synthetic elaboration toward diverse synthetically useful building blocks.

         <title>Catalyst&#8208;Free Propargylboration of Ketones with Allenyl&#8208;Bpins: Highly Stereoselective Synthesis of tert&#8208;Homopropargyl Alcohols Bearing Vicinal Stereocenters</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tertiary homopropargyl alcohols bearing vicinal stereocenters can be obtained through catalyst&#8208;free propargylboration of ketones with general allenyl&#8208;Bpins. The key factor for the success is enhancing the reactivity of the Bpin unit in&#8208;situ by sequentially adding 1.25&#8197;equiv. of nBuLi and 2.0&#8197;equiv. of TFAA. Additionally, propargylboration of ketones with chiral trisubstituted allenyl&#8208;Bpins enables the asymmetric synthesis of enantiomerically enriched tert&#8208;homopropargyl alcohols with complete chirality transfer.







Abstract
A practical and efficient propargylboration of ketones is presented using general allenylboronic acid pinacol esters (allenyl&#8208;Bpins) without a catalyst. This reaction is triggered by in&#8208;situ activation of stable allenyl&#8208;Bpins through the sequential addition of 1.25&#8197;equiv. of nBuLi and the prerequisite 2.0&#8197;equiv. of TFAA. Under the optimized reaction conditions, the versatile trisubstituted allenyl&#8208;Bpins react with various ketones smoothly to afford a wide range of tert&#8208;homopropargyl alcohols bearing vicinal stereocenters in high yields with good to excellent diastereoselectivities. Furthermore, propargylboration of ketones with chiral trisubstituted allenyl&#8208;Bpins allows for the asymmetric synthesis of chiral tert&#8208;homopropargyl alcohols with a full chirality transfer.

         <title>Tracking SF5I in the Iodopentafluorosulfanylation of Alkynes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The iodopentafluorosulfanylation of alkynes was made possible through formal manipulation of SF5I. This method requires the combination SF5Cl/KI/18&#8208;crown&#8208;6 in THF at low temperature. Mechanistic investigations by DFT revealed that a ionic pathway is not viable and a radical mechanism is preponderant.







Abstract
In the vibrant field of SF5 chemistry, SF5X reagents (X=F, Cl, Br) are at the heart of current investigations in radical pentafluorosulfanylation reactions. SF5I is the missing link whose existence has not been reported despite its potential as SF5 donor. This study reports the formal addition of the hitherto unknown SF5I reagent to alkynes by means of a combination of SF5Cl/KI/18&#8208;crown&#8208;6 ether. The exclusive regio&#8208; and stereoselective synthesis of unprecedented (E)&#8208;1&#8208;iodo&#8208;2&#8208;(pentafluoro&#8208;&#955;6&#8208;sulfanyl) alkenes was achieved. A consensus was reached through computational and mechanistic studies for the realistic formation of SF5&#8722; anion but not SF5I in solution and the rational involvement of SF5&#8901; and iodine radicals in the iodo pentafluorosulfanylation reaction.

         <title>Oxidative Addition and &#946;&#8208;Hydride Elimination by a Macrocyclic Dinickel Complex: Observing Bimetallic Elementary Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel bimetallic elementary reactions: The oxidative addition of some simple electrophiles to a highly planar dinickel complex with a macrocyclic ligand, NiI2(tBuPONNOPONNO), are described. These reactions form dinickel alkyl complexes of the type NiII2(&#956;&#8208;R). The process of &#946;&#8208;hydride elimination from dinickel ethyl complexes NiII2(&#956;&#8208;Et) was then investigated experimentally and computationally and found to proceed by a novel bimetallic mechanism.







Abstract
The dinickel(I) complex Ni2(tBuPONNOPONNO), featuring a planar macrocyclic diphosphoranide ligand tBuPONNOPONNO, offers a unique architectural platform for observing bimetallic elementary reactions. Oxidative addition reactions of alkyl halides produce dinickel(II) complexes of the type Ni2(&#956;&#8208;R)(&#956;&#8208;X)(tBuPONNOPONNO). However, when R=Et &#946;&#8208;hydride elimination is observed to form a dinickel monohydride, with the rate dependent on the nature of X. DFT studies suggest a new mechanism for bimetallic &#946;&#8208;hydride elimination, where the rate dependence arises from the steric pressure imposed by the X group on the opposing trans face of the dinickel macrocycle. This work enhances understanding of bimetallic elementary reactions, particularly &#946;&#8208;hydride elimination, which have not been well&#8208;explored for dinuclear systems.

         <title>Fluorination Influences the Bioisostery of Myo&#8208;Inositol Pyrophosphate Analogs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
How do pyrophosphate analogs compare? The synthesis of a fluorinated analog of an inositol pyrophosphate messenger is reported. Comparison of the physicochemical and biochemical properties of a range of closely related analogs showcases that subtle modifications can distinctly influence the behavior of molecules.







Abstract
Inositol pyrophosphates (PP&#8722;IPs) are densely phosphorylated messenger molecules involved in numerous biological processes. PP&#8722;IPs contain one or two pyrophosphate group(s) attached to a phosphorylated myo&#8208;inositol ring. 5PP&#8722;IP5 is the most abundant PP&#8722;IP in human cells. To investigate the function and regulation by PP&#8722;IPs in biological contexts, metabolically stable analogs have been developed. Here, we report the synthesis of a new fluorinated phosphoramidite reagent and its application for the synthesis of a difluoromethylene bisphosphonate analog of 5PP&#8722;IP5. Subsequently, the properties of all currently reported analogs were benchmarked using a number of biophysical and biochemical methods, including co&#8208;crystallization, ITC, kinase activity assays and chromatography. Together, the results showcase how small structural alterations of the analogs can have notable effects on their properties in a biochemical setting and will guide in the choice of the most suitable analog(s) for future investigations.

         <title>Confining Ionic Liquids in Developing Quasi&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Electrolytes for Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The concept of confining ionic liquids (ILs) in developing quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state electrolytes (QSSEs) has been proposed, where ILs are dispersed in polymer networks/backbones and/or filler/host pores, forming the so&#8208;called confinement, and great research progress and promising research results have been achieved. In this review, the progress and achievement in developing QSSEs using IL&#8208;confinement for lithium metal batteries (LMBs), together with advanced characterizations and simulations, were surveyed, summarized, and analyzed, where the&#160;influence of specific parameters, such as IL (type, content, etc.), substrate (type, structure, surface properties, etc.), confinement methods, and so on, was discussed. The confinement concept was further compared with the conventional one in other research areas. It indicates that the IL&#8208;confinement in QSSEs improves the performance of electrolytes, for example, increasing the ionic conductivity, widening the electrochemical window, and enhancing the cycle performance of the assembled cells, and being different from those in other areas, i.e., the IL&#8208;confinement concept in the battery area is in a broad extent. Finally, insights into developing QSSEs in LMBs with the confinement strategy were provided to promote the development and application of QSSE LMBs.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly Stable Perovskite Solar Cells based on the Efficient Interaction between Pb2+ and Cyano Groups of 4&#8208;Aminophthalonitrile</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Defects present on the top surface of perovskite films have a pronounced detrimental impact on the photovoltaic performance and stability of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Consequently, the development of effective defect passivation strategies has become key in enhancing both the power conversion efficiency (PCE) and stability of PSCs. In this study, a small molecule material, 4&#8208;Aminophthalonitrile (4&#8208;APN), was introduced as a means to mitigate surface defects within perovskite films. Obviously, 4&#8208;APN effectively passivates the defects at grain boundaries by combining cyano groups (&#8722;C&#8801;N) with Pb2+, significantly reducing the density of defect states, inhibiting non&#8208;radiative recombination at the interface, and promoting the charge transfer efficiency from the perovskite layer to the hole transport layer. The 4&#8208;APN modification led to a significant upswing in the PCE, while concurrently bolstering the overall device stability. Importantly, the devices on 4&#8208;APN as passivation additive exhibited negligible performance degradation aging for 1200 h.</dc:description>

         <title>Generation of Bioactivity&#8208;tailored FK506/FK520 Analogs by CRISPR Editing in Streptomyces tsukubaensis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>For a potential application of FK506 in the treatment of acute kidney failure only the FKBP12 binding capability of the compound is required while the immunosuppressive activity via calcineurin binding is considered as a likely risk to the patients. The methoxy&#8208;groups at C13 and C15 are thought to have significant influence on the immunosuppressive activity of the molecule. Consequently, FK506 analogs with different functionalities at C13 and C15 were generated by targeted CRISPR editing of the AT domains in module 7 and 8 of the biosynthetic assembly line in Streptomyces tsukubaensis. In addition, the corresponding FK520 (C21 ethyl derivative of FK506) analogs could be obtained by media adjustments. The compounds were tested for their bioactivity in regards to FKBP12 binding, BMP potentiation and calcineurin sparing. 15&#8208;desmethoxy FK506 was superior to the other tested analogs as it did not inhibit calcineurin but retained high potency towards FKBP12 binding and BMP potentiation.</dc:description>

         <title>Diversification of Simple Arenes into Complex (Amino)cyclitols</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Highly oxygenated cyclohexanes, including (amino)cyclitols, are featured in natural products possessing a notable range of biological activities. As such, these building blocks are valuable tools for medicinal chemistry. While de novo synthetic strategies have provided access to select compounds, challenges including stereochemical density and complexity have hindered the development of a general approach to (amino)cyclitol structures. Herein, we report the use of arenophile chemistry to access dearomatized intermediates which are amenable to diverse downstream transformations. Practical guidelines were developed for the synthesis of natural and non&#8208;natural (amino)cyclitols from simple arenes through a series of strategic functionalization events.</dc:description>

         <title>Regular Arrays of Rod&#8208;Shaped Molecular Photoswitches: Synthesis, Preparation, Characterization, and Selective Photoswitching within Mono&#8208; and Bilayer Systems</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We assembled photoresponsive mono&#8208; and bilayer systems with well&#8208;defined properties from rod&#8208;shaped molecules equipped with different photoswitches. Using properly chosen chromophores (diarylethene&#8208;based switch and unidirectional light&#8208;driven molecular motor), we then selectively targeted layers made of the same types of photoswitches using appropriate monochromatic light. UV&#8211;vis analysis confirmed smooth and unrestricted photoisomerization. To achieve this, we synthesized a new class of triptycene&#8208;based molecular pedestals adept at forming sturdy Langmuir&#8211;Blodgett films on a water&#8211;air interface. The films were smoothly transferred to gold and quartz surfaces. Repeated deposition afforded bilayer systems: one layer containing diarylethene&#8208;based photoswitches and the other a unidirectional light&#8208;driven molecular motor. Structural analysis of both mono&#8208; and bilayer systems revealed the molecules to be tilted with carboxylic functions pointing to the surface. At least two different polymorphs differing in monolayer thickness and tilt angle (&#8275;40&#176; and &#8275;60&#176;) were identified on the gold surface.</dc:description>

         <title>Single Atom Stabilization of Phosphinate Ester&#8208;Containing Rhodamines Yields Cell Permeable Probes for Turn&#8208;On Photoacoustic Imaging</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photoacoustic imaging (PAI) is an emerging imaging technique that uses pulsed laser excitation with near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light to elicit local temperature increases through non&#8208;radiative relaxation events, ultimately leading to the production of ultrasound waves. The classical xanthene dye scaffold has found numerous applications in fluorescence imaging, however, xanthenes are rarely utilized for PAI since they do not typically display NIR absorbance. Herein, we report the ability of Nebraska Red (NR) dyes to produce photoacoustic (PA) signal and provide a rational design approach to reduce the hydrolysis rate of ester containing dyes, affording cell permeable probes. To demonstrate the utility of this approach, we construct the first cell permeable rhodamine&#8208;based, turn&#8208;on PAI imaging probe for hypochlorous acid (HOCl) with maximal absorbance within the range of commercial PA instrumentation. This probe, termed SNR700&#8208;HOCl, is capable of detecting exogenous HOCl in mice. This work provides a new set of rhodamine&#8208;based PAI agents as well as a rational design approach to stabilize esterified versions of NR dyes with desirable properties for PAI. In the long term, the reagents described herein could be utilized to enable non&#8208;invasive imaging of HOCl in disease&#8208;relevant model systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Resolution of Expanded Porphyrinoids: A Path to Persistent Chirality and Appealing Chiroptical Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chirality is a fundamental characteristic of nature. Expanded porphyrinoids and their analogues offer an attractive platform for delving into the intricacies of chirality. Expanded porphyrioids comprise pyrrolic macrocycles and related heterocyclic systems. As a class, expanded porphyrioids are widely recognized for their flexible structural features, nontrivial coordination capabilities, and intriguing optical and electronic properties. With limited exceptions, their inherent conformational flexibility coupled with a low racemization barrier allows for the facile interchange between enantiomers. As a result, achieving the effective chiral resolution of individual enantiomers and the subsequent exploration of their chiroptical properties represents a significant challenge. This review summarizes strategies used to realize the chiral resolution of expanded porphyrinoids and the understanding of intrinsic chiroptical properties that has emerged from these separation efforts. It is our hope that this review will serve not only to codify our current understanding of chiral expanded porphyrinoids, but also inspire advances in the generalized area of chiral functional materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Rational Design, Multistep Synthesis and in Vitro Evaluation of Poly(glycerol) Functionalized Nanodiamond Conjugated with Boron&#8208;10 Cluster and Active Targeting Moiety for Boron Neutron Capture Therapy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Good anticancer activity is realized upon neutron irradiation by boron neutron capture therapy using 10B cluster&#8208;based nanodrugs. They consist of nanodiamonds and poly(glycerol&#8208;co&#8208;glyceric acid) conjugated by a 10B source (sodium borocaptate) and active targeting moiety (phenyl boronic acid or RGD peptide) through a multi&#8208;step organic transformation. Their cellular uptake might be facilitated by the negative charge of the boron cluster. More information can be found in the Research Article by M. Nishikawa, N. Komatsu, and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202302073).

         <title>Highly Enantioselective Synthesis of Pharmaceuticals at Chiral&#8208;Encoded Metal Surfaces</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanostructured mesoporous Pt&#8208;Ir alloys, illustrated by the tunnel entrances, have been successfully developed as heterogeneous catalysts for the asymmetric synthesis of pharmaceutical compounds. These findings, reported by C. Wattanakit, A. Kuhn, and co&#8208;workers in the Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202302054), illustrate that these designer materials allow the enantioselective hydrogenation of adrenalone to produce the desired epinephrine stereoisomer with up to 95&#8201;% enantiomeric excess.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Nanostructured mesoporous Pt-Ir alloys,&lt;/b&gt; illustrated by the tunnel entrances, have been successfully developed as heterogeneous catalysts for the asymmetric synthesis of pharmaceutical compounds. These findings, reported by C. Wattanakit, A. Kuhn, and co-workers in the Research Article (DOI: &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/chem.202302054"&gt;10.1002/chem.202302054&lt;/a&gt;), illustrate that these designer materials allow the enantioselective hydrogenation of adrenalone to produce the desired epinephrine stereoisomer with up to 95&#8201;% enantiomeric excess.

Checkmate! Metastable connections of AgII and sulfate dianions have so far been limited to a quasi&#8208;binary one&#8208;dimensional antiferromagnet, AgSO4. Preparation of Cu[Ag(SO4)2], the first member of the MII[Ag(SO4)2] series, paves the way towards strongly coupled two&#8208;dimensional antiferromagnets with a chessboard&#8208;like spin arrangement within [Ag(SO4)2]2&#8211; sublattice.

         <title>Herringbone Helical Foldamers from Aromatic Ether Derived &#1013;&#8208;Amino Acid Peptides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new type of herringbone helical foldamer based on a non&#8208;natural codon, i.&#8201;e., aromatic ether derived &#1013;&#8208;amino acid, was designed, synthesized and characterized. Attaching a single stereogenic carbon at the C&#8208;termini of the peptides induced single&#8208;handed screw sense, which was amplified through chain propagation.







Abstract
Oligomers based on an aromatic ether derived &#1013;&#8208;amino acid peptides folded into herringbone helical structures, induced by successive NH&#8722;O&#8722;NH &amp; O&#8722;NH&#8722;O bifurcated hydrogen bonding interactions and reinforced by &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking between aryls from adjacent layers. The diaryl ether bonds &#8722;O&#8722; worked both as structural units to provide turn motifs for changing the amplitude of the slope along the axis of helix for herringbone formation, and also as acceptors for hydrogen bonding. Attachment of a single chiral carbon to the C&#8208;termini of the peptides induced excess of single&#8208;handed screw sense and amplification through the chain propagation as exemplified by chain length dependent circular dichroism (CD) investigations.

         <title>2D Covalent Organic Frameworks with Kagome Lattice: Synthesis and Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Representative synthetic approaches and applications of 2D kgm COFs are summarized in this Review. The specific pore structure of kgm topology exhibits unique superiority in selective adsorption, mass diffusion, and exciton migration, which will facilitate the development and provide more opportunities for 2D COFs.







Abstract
2D covalent organic frameworks with Kagome (kgm) topology are a promising class of crystalline frameworks that possess both triangular and hexagonal pores. These dual&#8208;pore structures enable kgm COFs to exhibit unique advantages in selective separation, mass transfer, and targeted drug release. However, the synthesis of 2D kgm COFs has been hindered by the reliance on empirical methods. This review systematically summarizes the conventional macrocycle&#8208;to&#8208;framework strategy, typical [4+2] co&#8208;polymerization synthetic strategy, and bifunctional molecules self&#8208;condensation approach for constructing 2D kgm COFs. Factors influencing the formation of kgm lattice are surveyed, such as monomer type, solvent polarity, substrate concentration, etc., and highlight the representative examples on targeted synthesis. Additionally, applications of 2D kgm COFs and relationships between structure and performances are summarized. Finally, key fundamental perspectives are proposed to accelerate the further development of this intriguing material.

         <title>Quantitative Assessment of Crystallinity and Stability in &#946;&#8208;Ketoenamine&#8208;Based Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel quantitative method has been established to quantitatively assess the stability of COFs by utilizing two crystallinity&#8208;dependent parameters, I4.6rel and A4.6rel, from the analysis of PXRD profiles. By employing this method, the stabilities of KEA&#8208;COFs have been thoroughly investigated, offering valuable information that goes beyond qualitative descriptions.







Abstract
The design and synthesis of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with high chemical stability pose significant challenges for practical applications. Although a growing number of robust COFs have been developed and employed for a broad scope of applications, the assessment of COF stability has primarily relied on qualitative descriptions, lacking a rational and quantitative assessment. Herein, a novel assessment method is presented that enables visual and quantitative depiction of COF stability. By analyzing the PXRD patterns of chemically stable &#946;&#8208;ketoenamine&#8208;based COFs (KEA&#8208;COFs), two crystallinity&#8208;dependent parameters are identified, the relative intensity (I2&#952;rel) and the relative area (A2&#952;rel) of the main peak (2&#952;), which are expected to establish a standardized criterion for assessing COF crystallinity. Based on these parameters, the crystalline changes after stability tests can be visually presented, which provides a rational and quantitative assessment of their stability. This study not only demonstrates the remarkable chemical stability of KEA&#8208;COFs, but also provides valuable insights into the quantitative evaluation of COFs&#8217; crystallinity and stability.

         <title>Is Enol Always the Culprit? The Curious Case of High Enantioselectivity in a Chiral Rh(II) Complex Catalyzed Carbene Insertion Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Acquitting enol of all charges: The reaction mechanism and stereoselectivity of a Rh(II) catalyzed indole alkylation reaction with in&#8197;situ generated carbenes are investigated. The reaction proceeds via a novel metal&#8208;associated enol pathway and not via a previously reported metal&#8208;free/oxocarbenium route.







Abstract
The mechanism of Rh2(S&#8208;NTTL)4 catalyzed carbene insertion into C(3)&#8722;H of indole is investigated using DFT methods. Since the commonly accepted enol mechanism cannot account for enantioinduction, a concerted oxocarbenium pathway was proposed in an earlier work using a model catalyst. However, after considering the full catalytic system, this study finds that akin to other reactions, here, too, the enol pathway is of lower energy, which now naturally raises a conundrum regarding the mode of chiral induction. Herein, a new water promoted mechanistic pathway involving a metal&#8208;associated enol intermediate hydrogen bonding and stereochemical model are proposed to solve this puzzle. It is shown how the catalyst bowl&#8208;shaped structure along with substrate&#8208;catalyst binding is crucial for achieving high levels of enantioselectivity. A stereodetermining water&#8208;assisted proton transfer is proposed and confirmed through deuterium&#8208;labeling experiments. The water molecules are held together by H&#8208;bonding interactions with the carboxylate ligands that is reminiscent of enzyme catalysis. Although several previous studies have aimed at understanding the mechanism of metal catalyzed carbene insertion reactions, the origin of high stereoinduction especially with chiral metal complexes remains unclear, and till date there is no transition state model that can explain the high enantioselectivity with such chiral Rh complexes. The metal&#8208;associated enol pathway is currently underrepresented in catalytic cycles and may play a crucial role in catalyst design. Since the enol pathway is commonly adopted in other metal&#8208;catalyzed X&#8722;H insertion reactions involving a diazoester, the presented results are not specific to the current reaction. Therefore, this study could provide the direction for achieving high levels of enantioselectivity which is otherwise difficult to achieve with a single metal catalyst.

A stereodetermining water-assisted proton transfer is proposed and confirmed through deuterium-labeling experiments. The water molecules are held together by H-bonding interactions with the carboxylate ligands that is reminiscent of enzyme catalysis. Although several previous studies have aimed at understanding the mechanism of metal catalyzed carbene insertion reactions, the origin of high stereoinduction especially with chiral metal complexes remains unclear, and till date there is no transition state model that can explain the high enantioselectivity with such chiral Rh complexes. The metal-associated enol pathway is currently underrepresented in catalytic cycles and may play a crucial role in catalyst design. Since the enol pathway is commonly adopted in other metal-catalyzed X&#8722;H insertion reactions involving a diazoester, the presented results are not specific to the current reaction. Therefore, this study could provide the direction for achieving high levels of enantioselectivity which is otherwise difficult to achieve with a single metal catalyst.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Planar Hexacoordinate Beryllium: Covalent Bonding Between s&#8211;block Metals</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Clusters with covalent bonds: To investigate the potential for planar hypercoordination in s&#8208;block metals, we report a planar hexacoordinate beryllium center in the neutral binary Be&#169;Be6Cl6 cluster. This global minimum is dynamic stabilized and displays the 6&#963;/2&#960; double aromaticity. Interestingly, chemical bonding analysis further highlights a substantial covalent interaction between the ligand beryllium atoms and the central metal beryllium atoms.







Abstract
Achieving a planar hypercoordinate arrangement of s&#8208;block metals through covalent bonding with ligands is challenging due to the strong ionicity involved. Herein, we report the first case of a neutral binary global minimum containing a planar hexacoordinate beryllium atom. The central Be atom is coordinated by six active Be atoms, the latter in turn are enclosed by an equal number of more electronegative chlorine atoms in the periphery, forming a star&#8208;like phBe cluster (Be&#169;Be6Cl6). Importantly, the cluster exhibits dynamically stabilized stemming geometrically from the appropriate matching of metal&#8208;ligand size and electronically from adherence to the octet rule as well as possessing a 6&#963;/2&#960; double aromaticity. Remarkably, energy decomposition analysis&#8208;natural orbitals for chemical valence (EDA&#8208;NOCV) analysis reveals a significant covalent interaction between the ligand and the central metal beryllium atoms, a fact further supported by a large Wiberg bond index. This cluster is a promising synthetic as its excellent electronic, dynamic and thermodynamic stability.

         <title>Catalytic Asymmetric Synthesis of N&#8208;N Biaryl Atropisomers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Atropisomers featuring a restricted rotational axis have emerged as important structural scaffolds in natural products, drug design, and asymmetric synthesis. Recently, N&#8208;N biaryl atropisomers have drawn increasing interest due to their unique structure and relatively stable axes. However, its asymmetric synthesis remains scarce compared to its well&#8208;developed C&#8208;C biaryl analogs. In this concept, we summarize the asymmetric synthesis of N&#8208;N biaryl atropisomers including N&#8208;N pyrrole&#8208;pyrrole, N&#8208;N pyrroleindole, N&#8208;N indole&#8208;indole, and N&#8208;N indole&#8208;carbazole, during which a series synthetic strategies are highlighted. Also, a synthetic evolution is briefly reviewed and an outlook of N&#8208;N biaryl atropisomers synthesis is offered.</dc:description>

         <title>Nucleophilicity of 4&#8208;(Alkylthio)&#8208;3&#8208;imidazoline Derived Enamines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Imidazolidine&#8208;4&#8208;thiones (ITOs) are cyclic, secondary amines that were considered as potential prebiotic organocatalysts for light&#8208;driven &#945;&#8208;alkylations of aldehydes by bromoacetonitrile (BAN). Recent studies showed that the initially supplied ITOs represent the pre&#8208;catalyst because they undergo S&#8208;alkylation with BAN to give 4&#8208;(alkylthio)&#8208;3&#8208;imidazolines (TIMs). Given that the same reagent mix that undergoes light&#8208;driven &#945;&#8208;alkylations is also effective in the dark, we synthesized ten ITO&#8208; or TIM&#8208;derived enamines of aldehydes and characterized their nucleophilic reactivities by kinetic studies in acetonitrile. The experimental second&#8208;order rate constants k2 for reactions of enamines with benzhydrylium ions (reference electrophiles) were evaluated by the Mayr&#8208;Patz equation, lg k2(20&#176;C) = sN(N+E). The determined nucleophilicities N (and sN) reveal the reactivity profiles of these enamines under prebiotically relevant conditions as well as their potential for use in organocatalytic synthesis.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of higher&#8208;order cycloadditions has mainly been restricted by the requisite usage of highly conjugated and reactive &#960;&#8208;systems. Recent years have witnessed organocatalysis as a potent mediator for several of the challenges associated herein, rendering higher&#8208;order cycloadditions a legitimate option for achieving the selective construction of specific molecular scaffolds. These developments reinvigorate the efforts to try to understand the underlying principles for cycloadditions involving a higher numbers of &#960;&#8208;electrons than the &#8220;classical&#8221; cycloadditions; how do we properly address the impact which the addition of further &#960;&#8208;electrons have on the reactivity of a system? Herein, computational investigations of two model higher&#8208;order cycloaddition systems have been performed to try to provide insights on changes in energetic barriers induced by the presence of benzofusions in a position which is unobstructive to the reactivity. With experimental substantiation as support, these studies might open up for a discussion on whether the &#960;&#8208;electrons of benzofused systems simply act as spectator electrons, or play a tangible role on the observed reactivity to an extent, where a distinct nomenclature is meritable.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly Selective Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Isomerization&#8208;Hydroboration of Alkenes Affords Terminal Functionalization at Remote C&#8722;H Position</title>

         <dc:description>
Nickel catalyst: Nickel complexes supported by tridentate and bidentate phosphino(silyl) ligands are effective precatalysts for the hydroboration of terminal and internal alkenes using pinacolborane (HBPin). Isomerization to afford exclusively the terminal hydroboration product was obtained across a range of internal alkenes, including tri&#8208; and tetra&#8208;substituted examples.







Abstract
We report herein the synthesis and characterization of nickel complexes supported by tridentate and bidentate phosphino(silyl) ancillary ligands, along with the successful application of these complexes as precatalysts for the hydroboration of terminal and internal alkenes using pinacolborane (HBPin). These reactions proceeded with low nickel loadings of 2.5&#8208;5&#8197;mol&#8201;% in the absence of co&#8208;solvent, and in some cases at room temperature. Isomerization to afford exclusively the terminal hydroboration product was obtained across a range of internal alkenes, including tri&#8208; and tetra&#8208;substituted examples. This reactivity is unprecedented for nickel and offers a powerful means of achieving functionalization at a C&#8722;H position remote from the C=C double bond. Nickel&#8208;catalyzed deuteroboration experiments using DBPin support a mechanism involving 1,2&#8208;insertion of the alkene and subsequent chain&#8208;walking, which results in isotopic scrambling.

         <title>Cation Adaptive Structures Based on Manganese Cyanide Prussian Blue Analogues: Application of Powder Diffraction Data to Solve Complex, Unprecedented Stoichiometries and New Structure Types</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
New extended structure types and unprecedented stoichiometries form from ionic MnII and ionic cyanides as a consequence of the shape of the cyanide cation that have applications as molecule&#8208;based magnets and batteries.







Abstract
A Mn(II) salt and A+CN&#8722; under anaerobic conditions react to form 2&#8208;D and 3&#8208;D extended structured compounds of AmMnIIn(CN)m+2n stoichiometry. Here, the creation and characterization of this large family of compounds, for example AMnII3(CN)7, A2MnII3(CN)8, A2MnII5(CN)12, A3MnII5(CN)13, and A2MnII[MnII(CN)6], where A represents alkali and tetraalkylammonium cations, is reviewed. Cs2MnII[MnII(CN)6] has the typical Prussian blue face centered cubic unit cell. However, the other alkali salts are monoclinic or rhombohedral. This is in accord with smaller alkali cation radii creating void space that is minimized by increasing the van der Waals stabilization energy by reducing &#8736;Mn&#8722;N&#8801;C, which, strengthens the magnetic coupling and increases the magnetic ordering temperatures. This is attributed to the non&#8208;rigidity of the framework structure due the significant ionic character associated with the high&#8208;spin MnII sites. For larger tetraalkylammonium cations, the high&#8208;spin Mn sites lack sufficient electrostatic A+&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;NC stabilization and form unexpected 4&#8208; and 5&#8208;coordinated Mn sites within a flexible, extended framework around the cation; hence, the size, shape, and charge of the cation dictate the unprecedented stoichio&#8208;metry and unpredictable cation adaptive structures. Antiferromagnetic coupling between adjacent MnII sites leads to ferrimagnetic ordering, but in some cases antiferromagnetic coupling of ferrimagnetic layers are compensated and synthetic antiferromagnets are observed. The magnetic ordering temperatures for ferrimagnetic A2MnII[MnII(CN)6] with both octahedral high&#8208; and low&#8208;spin MnII sites increase with decreasing &#8736;Mn&#8722;N&#8801;C. The crystal structures for all of the extended structured materials were obtained by powder diffraction.

         <title>A Freestanding 3D Skeleton with Gradationally Distributed Lithiophilic Sites for Realizing Stable Lithium Anodes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Towards stable Li metal anode: Lithiophilic ZnO with a gradient distribution was embedded onto a 3D carbon nanotube@carbon felt (CNT@CF) substrate, which served as a scaffold for constructing a stable Li metal anode, to prepare a ZnO/CNT@CF&#8722;Li electrode with an inverted structure via electrodeposition. Owing to the synergistic effect of Li metal and the lithiophilic LiZn alloy, the composite electrode with an inverted structure drove Li+ deposition toward the interior of the skeleton. Moreover, the composite electrode moderately prevented Li+ accumulation on the skeleton surface, thereby improving battery safety. Consequently, the ZnO/CNT@CF&#8722;Li anode performed well in both symmetric and full&#8208;cell setups.







Abstract
Lithium (Li) metal anodes are drawing considerable attention owing to their ultrahigh theoretical capacities and low electrochemical reduction potentials. However, their commercialization has been hampered by safety hazards induced by continuous dendrite growth. These issues can be alleviated using the ZnO&#8208;modified 3D carbon&#8208;based host containing carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and carbon felt (CF) fabricated by electroplating in the present study (denoted as ZnO/CNT@CF). The constructed skeleton has lithiophilic ZnO that is gradationally distributed along its thickness. The utilization of an inverted ZnO/CNT@CF&#8722;Li anode obtained by flipping over the carbon skeleton after Li electrodeposition is also reported herein. The synergistic effect of the Li metal and lithiophilic sites reduces the nucleation overpotential, thus inducing Li+ to preferentially deposit inside the porous carbon&#8208;based scaffold. The composite electrode compels Li to grow away from the separator, thereby significantly improving battery safety. A symmetric cell with the inverted ZnO/CNT@CF&#8722;Li electrode operates steadily for 700&#8197;cycles at 1&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and 1&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Moreover, the ZnO/CNT@CF&#8722;Li|S cell exhibits an initial areal capacity of 10.9&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at a S loading of 10.4&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and maintains a capacity of 3.0&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2 after 320&#8197;cycles.

         <title>Isolation of (Aryl)&#8208;(Imino) Phosphide and (Aryl)&#8208;(Phosphaalkene) Amide Complexes of Alkali Metals from Carbene&#8208;Phosphinidenes under Reductive&#8208;Thermal Rearrangements</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Carbene&#8208;anchored chloro&#8208;phosphinidenes have undergone unprecedented rearrangements under reductive&#8208;thermal conditions in the presence of alkali metals to afford the corresponding (aryl)&#8208;(imino)phosphide and (phosphaalkene)amide complexes. The former proved to be an excellent precursor for a novel chelating ligand with dual PN&#8208;donor sites, which provided direct synthetic routes for CuI4, AgI8 clusters, and cyclic alkyl(aminoboryl) phoshaalkenes.







Abstract
Two&#8208;electron reduction of cyclic alkyl(amino) carbene (cAAC)&#8208;supported chloro&#8208;phosphinidene cAAC=P&#8722;Cl (1) followed by unprecedented thermal rearrangements afforded the alkali metal complexes of (aryl)&#8208;(cyclic alkyl(imino)) phosphides 3&#8201;a&#8211;3&#8201;c, 4&#8201;a&#8211;4&#8201;b through migration of the 2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl (dipp) group from N to the P centre, and the (aryl)&#8208;(cyclic alkyl(phosphaalkene)) amide 5 through cleavage of the CMe2&#8722;N bond followed by energetically favoured 5&#8208;exo&#8208;tet ring&#8208;closure in the presence of the alkali metals Cs (3&#8201;a&#8211;3&#8201;c), K (4&#8201;a, 4&#8201;b), and Li (5).

&lt;p&gt;Carbene-anchored chloro-phosphinidenes have undergone unprecedented rearrangements under reductive-thermal conditions in the presence of alkali metals to afford the corresponding (aryl)-(imino)phosphide and (phosphaalkene)amide complexes. The former proved to be an excellent precursor for a novel chelating ligand with dual PN-donor sites, which provided direct synthetic routes for Cu&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt;

         <title>Atroposelective NiII&#8208;Catalyzed Cross&#8208;Coupling Reactions Enable a Deeper Understanding of Negishi Couplings: Isolation and Application of Solid Aryl Higher&#8208;Order Zincates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Initial experimental findings during optimization of a NiII&#8208;catalyzed atroposelective Negishi cross&#8208;coupling reaction revealed the importance of higher&#8208;order zincates as the transmetallating active species. An easy synthesis procedure for such zincates was developed and applied to a variety of potentially useful solid monoaryl higher&#8208;order zincates. Finally, the advantages of these reagents in different cross&#8208;coupling reactions were exemplified.







Abstract
The Negishi cross&#8208;coupling reactions involves the application of organozinc reagents and is a highly versatile reaction in synthetic organic chemistry. The transmetallation step plays a pivotal role in the mechanism of these types of cross&#8208;coupling reactions. In this study, mechanistic investigations are presented indicating that higher&#8208;order zincates are the transmetallating active species in Pd&#8208; and Ni&#8208;catalyzed Negishi cross&#8208;coupling reactions. These findings are supported by halide salt addition experiments and by obtaining a single X&#8208;ray crystal structure of the solid monoaryl higher&#8208;order zincate [1&#8208;NaphthylZnX3]2&#8722;Mg(THF)22+. The procedure developed in this work was further applied to the synthesis of various monoaryl higher&#8208;order zincates, after which their synthetic usefulness in terms of high reactivity towards transmetallation in Negishi cross&#8208;couplings, as well as stability, was exemplified in several reactions.

         <title>The Challenging World of Simple Inorganic Rings: Revisiting Roesky's Ketone and Roesky's Sulfoxide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Performing Molecular Orbital calculations on unsaturated sulfur&#8208;nitrogen rings remains a challenging task. One particular unresolved issue was the large difference between the experimental solid&#8208;state geometries and the gas&#8208;phase geometries of two five&#8208;membered ring systems, calculated by a variety of methods including DFT, MP4(SDQ) and CCSD(T). New solid&#8208;state and Valence Bond calculations present a partial explanation, even though a full final answer fails to emerge.







Abstract
The surprising differences between the experimental solid&#8208;state and calculated gas&#8208;phase structures of 5&#8208;oxo&#8208;1,3,2,4&#8208;dithiadiazole (Roesky's ketone, 1) and 1&#8208;oxo&#8208;1,2,4,3,5&#8208;trithiadiazole (Roesky's sulfoxide, 2), identified and studied in a series of papers published between 2004 and 2010 but then never satisfactorily explained, have been revisited, making use of the more advanced computational possibilities currently available. The previous calculations&#8217; considerable overestimations of the C&#8722;S and S&#8722;S bond lengths in 1 and 2, respectively, have been partly explained based on the results of periodic calculations and the application of Valence Bond (VB) Theory. In the case of 1, the crystal environment appears to stabilize a structure with a highly polarized C=O bond, which features a C&#8722;S bond with considerable double&#8208;bond character &#8211; an effect which does not exist for the isolated molecule &#8211; explaining the much shorter bond in the solid state. For 2, a similar conclusion can be drawn for the S&#8722;S distance. For both compounds, though, packing effects are not the sole source of the differences: the inability of Density Functional Theory (DFT) to properly deal with the electronic structures of these apparently simple main&#8208;group systems remains a contributing factor.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Stimuli&#8208;Activatable Hybrid Prodrug for the Self&#8208;Immolative Delivery of an Anticancer Agent and Hydrogen Sulfide with Turn&#8208;On Fluorescence</title>

         <dc:description>
Adjuvant drug delivery: Dual&#8208;stimuli&#8208;responsive thiocarbamate&#8208;based turn&#8208;on fluorogenic prodrug AM&#8208;TCB was developed for the adjuvant delivery of the naphthalimide amine&#8208;based anticancer agent amonafide and the gasotransmitter hydrogen sulfide (H2S). The adjuvant release of H2S helps in ameliorating the anticancer drug&#8208;induced side&#8208;effects.







Abstract
Stimuli&#8208;responsive fluorogenic prodrugs are advantageous for the targeted drug delivery enabling real&#8208;time non&#8208;invasive monitoring with turn&#8208;on fluorescence. We report herein the dual&#8208;stimuli (ROS and CA)&#8208;responsive thiocarbamate&#8208;based prodrug (AM&#8208;TCB) for the turn&#8208;on fluorogenic delivery of the naphthalimide&#8208;based anticancer agent amonafide along with the gasotransmitter hydrogen sulfide (H2S). A carbamate&#8208;based prodrug AM&#8208;CB was also designed, capable of releasing the anticancer agent amonafide without any H2S. The prodrugs were synthesized using multi&#8208;step organic synthesis. UV&#8208;Vis and fluorescence spectroscopic studies revealed selective reactivity of the boronate ester group of prodrugs towards ROS (primarily H2O2) with the release of amonafide and COS/CO2 via self&#8208;immolative processes. Hydrolysis of the generated COS by carbonic anhydrase (CA) produces H2S. While the prodrug AM&#8208;TCB retained the anticancer activity of free amonafide in cancer cells (MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;231 and HeLa), unlike amonafide, it enhanced the cellular viability of the non&#8208;malignant cells (HEK&#8208;293). Fluorescence imaging in HeLa cells revealed the simultaneous delivery of the anticancer agent and H2S from AM&#8208;TCB with turn&#8208;on fluorescence. Western blot studies further revealed the cytoprotective effects of the released H2S from AM&#8208;TCB. The present adjuvant strategy therefore would be helpful in future for ameliorating the anticancer drug&#8208;induced side&#8208;effects.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Artificial compartments with uniform diameters were constructed by using DNA origami as the internal skeleton of a liposome. The interior of the liposome was completely isolated from the external environment. Furthermore, the incorporation of an active membrane protein into the compartment enabled the selective transport of small molecules below 600&#8197;Da.







Abstract
The cellular compartment plays an essential role in organizing the complex and diverse biochemical reactions within the cell. By mimicking the function of such cellular compartments, the challenge of constructing artificial compartments has been taken up to develop new biochemical tools for efficient material production and diagnostics. The important features required for the artificial compartment are that it isolates the interior from the external environment and is further functionalized to control the transport of target chemicals to regulate the interior concentration of both substrate and reaction products. In this study, an artificial compartment with size&#8208;selective molecular transport function was constructed by using a DNA origami&#8208;guided liposome prepared by modifying the method reported by Perrault et&#8197;al. This completely isolates the liposome interior, including the DNA origami skeleton, from the external environment and allows the assembly of a defined number of molecules of interest inside and/or outside the compartment. By incorporating a bacterial membrane protein, OmpF, into the liposome, the resulting artificial compartment was shown to transport only the molecule of interest with a molecular weight below 600&#8197;Da from the external environment into the interior of the compartment.

         <title>Enhancing Gating Performance in Organic Molecular Field&#8208;Effect Transistors by Introducing Polar Azulene Components</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Organic molecular field&#8208;effect transistors based on naphthalene are redesigned by introducing azulene. Theoretical simulations reveal that such modification effectively increases the ON&#8208;state current, while significantly supressing the OFF&#8208;state current. As a result, gate controllability is improved with the ON&#8208;OFF current ratio being enlarged by nearly one order of magnitude.







Abstract
Organic molecular field&#8208;effect transistors (FETs) are promising building components for future electronic circuits. Efficient control of charge transport properties is one key issue in the design of organic molecular FETs. In this study, we propose a redesign of a naphthalene&#8208;based FET by introducing two azulene components in opposite dipole moment directions. Using density functional theory combined with non&#8208;equilibrium Green's function, the simulated electronic transport characteristics reveal that the introduction of polar azulene components effectively narrows the frontier molecular orbitals gap, leading to an increase in the ON&#8208;state current. Meanwhile, the OFF&#8208;state current is significantly suppressed by highly localizing the dominant electronic transport channel. As a result, improved gate controllability is achieved with a higher ON&#8208;OFF current ratio, which is nearly seven times higher than that of the naphthalene&#8208;based FET device. These findings provide theoretical directions for future design of organic molecular FET devices with enhanced gating regulation efficiency.

         <title>Transition&#8208;Metal&#8208;Catalyzed Addition of Organosulfur Compounds to Alkynes and Alkenes: Catalysis and Catalyst Poisons</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed addition of organosulfur compounds to carbon&#8208;carbon unsaturated bonds has been considered as one of the challenging reactions due to the catalyst poisons. Recently, novel systems have been investigated to suppress the catalyst poisons. This article highlights the pioneering studies on the catalytic addition of organosulfur compounds to alkynes and alkenes and describes their catalysis and catalyst poisons.







Abstract
The addition of heteroatom compounds to alkynes and alkenes is an atom&#8208;efficient method of carbon&#8208;heteroatom bond formation and is widely used as a fundamental synthetic method for the construction of functional molecules. Nevertheless, examples of transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed addition reactions of group&#8197;16 heteroatom compounds to carbon&#8208;carbon unsaturated bonds have been limited due to the widespread belief that organic sulfur and selenium compounds are representative catalyst poisons. In recent decades, however, several seminal catalytic reactions of sulfur compounds have been developed, providing important insights into catalysis and poisons. Therefore, this paper focuses on the transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed addition of organosulfur compounds to alkynes and alkenes, gains comprehensive insights into the catalysis and catalyst poisons, and proposes concepts for the development of transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed reactions of group&#8197;16 heteroatom compounds.

         <title>Synthesis and Additive Manufacturing of Hydrazone&#8208;Linked Covalent Organic Framework Aerogels</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fast gelation and crystallization of hydrazone linked COFs enable processing into hierarchically porous aerogels with tunable solvent adsorption properties. Additionally, the fast reaction kinetics facilitate a reactive 3D printing technique with a sacrificial polymer binder to produce 3D printed structures of COF aerogel material.







Abstract
Covalent Organic Frameworks (COFs) are crystalline, porous organic materials. Recent studies have demonstrated novel processing strategies for COFs to form adaptable architectures, but these have focused primarily on imine&#8208;linked COFs. This work presents a new synthesis and processing route to produce crystalline hydrazone&#8208;linked COF gels and aerogels with hierarchical porosity. The method was implemented to produce a series of hydrazone&#8208;linked COFs with different alkyl side&#8208;chain substituents, achieving control of the hydrophilicity of the final aerogel. Variation in the length of the alkyl substituents yielded materials with controllable form factors that can preferentially adsorb water or nonpolar organic solvents. Additionally, a method for additive manufacturing of hydrazone&#8208;linked COFs using hydroxymethylcellulose as a sacrificial additive is presented. This work demonstrates an effective and simple approach to the fabrication of hydrazone COF aerogels and additive manufacturing to produce hydrazone COFs of desired shape.

         <title>Nickel Phosphonate MOF Derived N&#8208;Doped Carbon&#8208;Coated Phosphorus&#8208;Vacancies&#8208;Rich Ni2P Particles as Efficient Bifunctional Oxygen Electrocatalyst</title>

         <dc:description>
Bifunctional OER catalyst: N&#8208;doped carbon&#8208;coated phosphorus&#8208;rich vacancies Ni2P particles (Vp&#8208;Ni2P@NC) was proposed via simple carbonization and following Ar plasma treatment from a single nickel phosphonate metal&#8211;organic framework. The resultant Vp&#8208;Ni2P@NC catalyst showed excellent bifunctional oxygen electrocatalytic activity, more advantageous &#916;E value (Ej=10&#8722;E1/2) and good long&#8208;term stability based on synergistic effect of introducing P vacancies into Ni2P and N&#8208;doped carbon.







Abstract
The design of non&#8208;noble metal bifunctional electrocatalysts with outstanding performance and remarkable stability for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is one of the most essential issues to the realization of rechargeable zinc&#8208;air battery, and transition metal phosphides (TMPs) have emerged as robust candidates for oxygen electrocatalysts. Herein, N&#8208;doped carbon&#8208;coated phosphorus&#8208;vacancies&#8208;rich Ni2P particles (Vp&#8208;Ni2P@NC) is proposed via simple carbonization and following Ar plasma treatment from a single nickel phosphonate metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) without extra phosphine and nitrogen sources. The facile and rapid plasma treatment can achieve phosphorus vacancies which could modulate the electronic structure to enhance the inherent active and electrical conductivity. Meanwhile, the pyridine&#8208;N and graphitized&#8208;N produced during calcination also could provide more active sites and increase the electrical conductivity. The resultant Vp&#8208;Ni2P@NC catalyst shows excellent bifunctional electrocatalytic activity (OER/ORR) based on synergistic effect of introducing P vacancies into Ni2P and N&#8208;doped carbon. Vp&#8208;Ni2P@NC catalyst shows more advantageous &#916;E value (0.70&#8197;V) compared to Pt/C+RuO2 (0.73&#8197;V) and most reported catalysts. Additionally, the zinc&#8208;air bbatterie (ZAB) employing Vp&#8208;Ni2P@NC as air cathode shows excellent performance. The maximum power density of 203.48&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2, the cycling stability of more than 150&#8197;h at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2.

         <title>Biasing the Formation of Solution&#8208;Unstable Intermediates in Coordination Self&#8208;Assembly by Mechanochemistry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A solvent&#8208;free ball&#8208;mill approach is developed to modulate coordination self&#8208;assembly energy landscapes, allowing access to self&#8208;assembly intermediates in the solid state that are too short&#8208;lived to be observed in traditional solution&#8208;based approaches.







Abstract
Due to the reversible nature of coordination bonds and solvation effect, coordination self&#8208;assembly pathways are often difficult to elucidate experimentally in solution, as intermediates and products are in constant equilibration. The present study shows that some of these transient and high&#8208;energy self&#8208;assembly intermediates can be accessed by means of ball&#8208;milling approaches. Among them, highly aqueous&#8208;unstable Pd3L11 and Pd6L14 open&#8208;cage intermediates of the framed Fujita Pd6L14 cage and Pd2L22, Pd3L21 and Pd4L22 intermediates of Mukherjee Pd6L24 capsule are successfully trapped in solid&#8208;state, where Pd=tmedaPd2+, L1=2,4,6&#8208;tris(4&#8208;pyridyl)&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triazine and L2=1,3,5&#8208;tris(1&#8208;imidazolyl)benzene). Their structures are assigned by a combination of solution&#8208;based characterization tools such as standard NMR spectroscopy, DOSY&#8197;NMR, ESI&#8208;MS and X&#8208;ray diffraction. Collectively, these results highlight the opportunity of using mechanochemistry to access unique chemical space with vastly different reactivity compared to conventional solution&#8208;based supramolecular self&#8208;assembly reactions.

         <title>NIR Light&#8208;Activated and RGD&#8208;Conjugated Ultrasmall Fe/PPy Nanopolymers for Enhanced Tumor Photothermal Ferrotherapy and MR Imaging</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile approach has been developed for preparation of the RGD&#8208;conjugated ultrasmall Fe/PPy nanopolymers for enhanced tumor photothermal ferrotherapy and MR imaging. Under irradiation with NIR light, the heat generated by Fe/PPy&#8208;RGD not only induced a therapeutic photothermal effect but also enhanced the Fenton reaction by inducing ferroptosis. This synergetic photothermal ferrotherapeutic effect greatly improved the efficiency of tumor treatment.







Abstract
Iron&#8208;based nanomaterials have shown great promise for tumor ferrotherapy in recent years. However, nanoparticle&#8208;induced ferroptosis has low therapeutic efficacy owing to unsatisfactory Fenton reaction activity in a typical tumor microenvironment. In this study, NIR light&#8208;activated Fe/PPy&#8208;RGD nanopolymers were developed to combine photothermal therapy and ferrotherapy and achieve enhanced antitumor activity. Importantly, Fe/PPy&#8208;RGD exhibited excellent therapeutic performance under NIR light activation both in&#8197;vitro and in&#8197;vivo. Under irradiation with NIR light, the heat generated by Fe/PPy&#8208;RGD not only induced a therapeutic photothermal effect but also enhanced the release of iron ions and the Fenton reaction by inducing ferroptosis. Additionally, by virtue of RGD conjugation and its ultrasmall size, Fe/PPy&#8208;RGD could effectively accumulate at tumor sites in living mice after systemic administration and could be monitored via MR imaging. Hence, this study provides a promising approach for integrating ferrotherapy with photothermal therapy to achieve enhanced tumor treatment.

         <title>The Facile Hydrolysis of Imidazolinium Chlorides (N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene Precursors) Under Basic Aqueous Conditions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The hydrolysis of imidazolinium chlorides takes place readily in a basic water/dichloromethane biphasic mixture at room temperature. Experimental conditions were optimized to afford full conversions and high yields of &#947;&#8208;aminoformamides starting from symmetrical or unsymmetrical substrates. Structural parameters that affect the resilience of these important NHC precursors in the presence of moisture were investigated. In particular, the critical influence of the counteranion was highlighted.







Abstract
The hydrolysis of imidazolinium chlorides takes place readily in a basic water/dichloromethane biphasic mixture at room temperature. Experimental parameters were optimized to afford full conversions and high yields of &#947;&#8208;aminoformamides starting from twelve symmetrical substrates with alkyl or aryl substituents on their nitrogen atoms, and five unsymmetrical 1&#8208;alkyl&#8208;3&#8208;arylimidazolinium chlorides. NMR and XRD analyses showed that the cleavage of unsymmetrical salts led to &#947;&#8208;alkylamino&#8208;N&#8208;arylformamides with a high regioselectivity and that bulky alkyl or aryl groups on the formamide moiety led to the isolation of the (E)&#8208;isomer in high stereoisomeric purity (&gt;95&#8201;%), whereas smaller and more flexible alkyl substituents afforded mixtures of (E)&#8208; and (Z)&#8208;rotamers. Control experiments showed that the hydrolysis of 1,3&#8208;dimesitylimidazolinium chloride (SIMes&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;HCl) did not occur readily in pure or acidic water and that the presence of bulky aromatic substituents on the nitrogen atoms of 1,3&#8208;bis(2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl)imidazolinium chloride (SIDip&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;HCl) efficiently slowed down its hydrolysis under basic aqueous conditions. Most strikingly, this work highlighted the critical influence of the counteranion on the reactivity of imidazolinium cations. Indeed, the chloride salts underwent a facile hydrolysis in the presence of water and Na2CO3, whereas various other NHC&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;HX derivatives reacted much slower or remained essentially inert under these conditions.

         <title>NHC&#8208;Stabilized Dialanes(4) of Al2Mes4</title>

NHC&#8208;stabilized dialanes(4). Synthesis and reactivity of mono&#8208; or bis&#8208;NHC&#8208;stabilized dialanes(4) (NHC)&#8901;Al2Mes4 and (NHC)2&#8901;Al2Mes4 are reported. These compounds reveal relatively long Al&#8722;Al bonds according to their XRD structures, which was verified by DFT calculations. QTAIM analysis on (IMeMe)2&#8901;Al2Mes4 7 revealed non&#8208;nuclear attractors (NNA) along the aluminum aluminum vector. First reactivity studies on (IMeMe)2&#8901;Al2Mes4 7 demonstrate that NHC&#8208;ligated dialanes are thermally robust and storable synthons for the dialane(4) Al2Mes4. The synthesis of (IMeMe)&#8901;AlClMes2 10, {(IMeMe)&#8901;AlMes2}2&#8208;E (E=O 11, S 12), and the dimetallaacetylide {(IMeMe)&#8901;AlMes2}2&#8208;&#956;&#8208;(C&#8801;C) 13 is reported starting from 7.







Abstract
The synthesis and characterization of novel N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) stabilized dialanes Al2Mes4 as well as first investigations concerning the reactivity of these compounds are reported. The synthesis of these compounds proceeds via the mesityl&#8208;substituted alanes (NHC)&#8901;AlHMes2 (NHC=IMeMe{=1,3,4,5&#8208;tetramethyl&#8208;imidazolin&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene}, IiPrMe {=1,3&#8208;di&#8208;iso&#8208;propyl&#8208;4,5&#8208;dimethylimidazolin&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene}) and iodo&#8208;alanes (NHC)&#8901;AlIMes2 (NHC=IMeMe, IiPrMe). Metallic reduction of (NHC)&#8901;AlIMes2 afforded the new NHC&#8208;stabilized dialanes (NHC)2&#8901;Al2Mes4 (NHC=IMeMe, IiPrMe). The NHC&#8208;ligated dialanes are thermally robust and storable synthons for the dialane Al2Mes4. First reactivity studies on (IMeMe)2&#8901;Al2Mes4 towards small molecules confirm this, as this compound shows controlled and selective reactions with several substrates. Reaction with CuCl leads to oxidation of the dialane and formation of (IMeMe)&#8901;AlClMes2, reactions with pyridine N&#8208;oxide and tBu&#8722;N=C=S, respectively, gave the chalcogenide&#8208;bridged dimers {(IMeMe)&#8901;AlMes2}2&#8208;&#956;&#8208;E (E=O, S), and reaction with acetylene afforded the dimetallaacetylide {(IMeMe)&#8901;AlMes2}2&#8208;&#956;&#8208;(C&#8801;C).

&lt;p&gt;The synthesis and characterization of novel &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-heterocyclic carbene (NHC) stabilized dialanes Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Mes&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; as well as first investigations concerning the reactivity of these compounds are reported. The synthesis of these compounds proceeds via the mesityl-substituted alanes (NHC)&#8901;AlHMes&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (NHC=IMe&lt;sup&gt;Me&lt;/sup&gt;{=1,3,4,5-tetramethyl-imidazolin-2-ylidene}, I&lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;Pr&lt;sup&gt;Me&lt;/sup&gt; {=1,3-di-&lt;i&gt;iso&lt;/i&gt;-propyl-4,5-dimethylimidazolin-2-ylidene}) and iodo-alanes (NHC)&#8901;AlIMes&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (NHC=IMe&lt;sup&gt;Me&lt;/sup&gt;, I&lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;Pr&lt;sup&gt;Me&lt;/sup&gt;). Metallic reduction of (NHC)&#8901;AlIMes&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; afforded the new NHC-stabilized dialanes (NHC)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8901;Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Mes&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; (NHC=IMe&lt;sup&gt;Me&lt;/sup&gt;, I&lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;Pr&lt;sup&gt;Me&lt;/sup&gt;). The NHC-ligated dialanes are thermally robust and storable synthons for the dialane Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Mes&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;. First reactivity studies on (IMe&lt;sup&gt;Me&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8901;Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Mes&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; towards small molecules confirm this, as this compound shows controlled and selective reactions with several substrates. Reaction with CuCl leads to oxidation of the dialane and formation of (IMe&lt;sup&gt;Me&lt;/sup&gt;)&#8901;AlClMes&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, reactions with pyridine &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-oxide and &lt;sup&gt;t&lt;/sup&gt;Bu&#8722;N=C=S, respectively, gave the chalcogenide-bridged dimers {(IMe&lt;sup&gt;Me&lt;/sup&gt;)&#8901;AlMes&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-&lt;i&gt;&#956;&lt;/i&gt;-E (E=O, S), and reaction with acetylene afforded the dimetallaacetylide {(IMe&lt;sup&gt;Me&lt;/sup&gt;)&#8901;AlMes&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-&lt;i&gt;&#956;&lt;/i&gt;-(C&#8801;C).&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Synthesis of Hypervalent Iodine Diazo Compounds and Their Application in Organic Synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hypervalent iodine diazo reagents with electron&#8208;withdrawing groups (EWG) connected to diazo methyl center were a type of donor&#8208;acceptor diazo compounds with potential reaction abilities similar to ordinary diazo compounds. Although several hypervalent iodine diazo reagents were synthesized and used in the nucleophilic substitution reactions as early as 1994, the synthesis and application of new iodine(III) diazo reagents have only been reported to a certain extent in recent years. In the presence of rhodium catalyst, photocatalyst, or nucleophiles, hypervalent iodine diazo reagents can be converted into rhodium&#8208;carbenes, diazomethyl radicals, ester radicals or nucleophilic intermediates, which can be used as key intermediates for the formation of chemical bonds. The aim of this review is to give an overview of hypervalent iodine diazo compounds in organic synthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>Concentration and Solvent&#8208;Induced Chiral Tuning by Manipulating Non&#8209;Proteinogenic Amino Acids in Glycoconjugate Supra&#8208;Scaffolds: Interaction with Protein, and Streptomycin Delivery</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We showed solvent&#8208; and concentration&#8208;triggered chiral tuning of the fibrous assemblies of two novel glycoconjugates Z&#8208;P(Gly)&#8208;Glu and Z&#8208;F(4&#8208;N)&#8208;Glu made by chemical attachment of Cbz&#8208;protected [short as Z)] non&#8208;proteinogenic amino acids L&#8208;phenylglycine [short as P(Gly)] and 4&#8208;Nitro&#8208;L&#8208;phenylalanine [short as F(4&#8208;N)] with D&#8208;glucosamine [short as Glu]. Both biomimetic gelators can form self&#8208;healing and shape&#8208;persistent gels with a very low critical gelator concentration in water as well as in various organic solvents, indicating they are ambidextrous supergelators. Detailed spectroscopic studies suggested &#946;&#8208;sheet secondary structure formation during anisotropic self&#8208;aggregation of the gelators which resulted in the formation of hierarchical left&#8208;handed helical fibers in acetone with an interlayer spacing of 2.4 nm.&#160; After the physical characterization of the gels, serum protein interaction with the gelators was assessed, indicating they may be ideal for biomedical applications. Further, both gelators are benign, non&#8208;immunogenic, non&#8208;allergenic, and non&#8208;toxic in nature, which was confirmed by performing the blood parameters and liver function tests on Wister rats. Streptomycin&#8208;loaded hydrogels showed efficacious antibacterial activity in vitro and in vivo as well. Finally, cell attachment and biocompatibility of the hydrogels were demonstrated which opens a newer avenue for promising biomedical and therapeutic applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Late&#8208;stage C&#8722;H Activation of Drug (Derivative) Molecules with Pd(ll) Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This review comprehensively analyses representative examples of Pd(II)&#8208;catalyzed late&#8208;stage C&#8722;H activation reactions and demonstrates their efficacy in converting C&#8722;H bonds at multiple positions within drug (derivative) molecules into diverse functional groups. These transformative reactions hold immense potential in medicinal chemistry, enabling the efficient and selective functionalization of specific sites within drug molecules, thereby enhancing their pharmacological activity and expanding the scope of potential drug candidates. Although notable articles have focused on late&#8208;stage C&#8722;H functionalization reactions of drug&#8208;like molecules using transition&#8208;metal catalysts, reviews specifically focusing on late&#8208;stage C&#8722;H functionalization reactions of drug (derivative) molecules using Pd(II) catalysts are required owing to their prominence as the most widely utilized metal catalysts for C&#8722;H activation and their ability to introduce a myriad of functional groups at specific C&#8722;H bonds. The utilization of Pd&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H activation methodologies demonstrates impressive success in introducing various functional groups, such as cyano (CN), fluorine (F), chlorine (Cl), aromatic rings, olefin, alkyl, alkyne, and hydroxyl groups, to drug (derivative) molecules with high regioselectivity and functional&#8208;group tolerance. These breakthroughs in late&#8208;stage C&#8722;H activation reactions serve as invaluable tools for drug discovery and development, thereby offering strategic options to optimize drug candidates and drive the exploration of innovative therapeutic solutions.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The fluorobasic character of the strong oxidative fluorinator, XeF6, and the oxidative resistance of the [XeF5]+ and [Xe2F11]+ cations have been exploited for the syntheses of several novel Cr(VI) dianions. The reactions of XeF6 and CrO2F2 in anhydrous HF and in melts by direct fusion of the reactants yielded the first dinuclear Cr(VI) oxyfluoro&#8208;dianion salts, [XeF5]2[Cr2O4F6], [XeF5]2[Cr2O4F6]&#8729;4HF, [XeF5]2[Cr2O4F6]&#8729;2XeOF4, and mononuclear Cr(VI) oxyfluoro&#8208;dianion salt, [XeF5][Xe2F11][CrO2F4]. The salts were structurally characterized by low&#8208;temperature (LT) single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (SCXRD) and LT Raman spectroscopy. The [CrO2F4]2&#8722; and [Cr2O4F6]2&#8722; dianions have distorted octahedral cis&#8208;dioxo Cr(VI) coordination spheres in which two F&#8208;atoms are trans to one another and two F&#8208;atoms are trans to O&#8208;atoms. The [Cr2O4F6]2&#8722; dianion is the fluorine&#8208;bridged dimer of the [CrO2F3]&#8722; anion. Quantum&#8208;chemical (QC) calculations were used to obtain the energy&#8208;minimized, gas&#8208;phase geometries, and the calculated vibrational spectra of the gas&#8208;phase dianions and their ion&#8208;pairs which were used to aid in the vibrational frequency assignments of the crystalline salts. NBO and MEPS analyses and SCXRD show these salts are intimate ion&#8208;pairs in which their cations and anions interact through primarily electrostatic Xe&#8208;&#8208;&#8208;F &#963;&#8208;hole bonds.</dc:description>

         <title>Carbodiimide and Isocyanate Hydroboration by a Cyclic Carbodiphosphorane Catalyst</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report hydroboration of carbodiimide and isocyanate substrates catalyzed by a cyclic carbodiphosphorane catalyst. The cyclic carbodiphosphorane outperformed the other Lewis basic carbon species tested, including other zerovalent carbon compounds, phosphorus ylides, an N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene, and an N&#8208;heterocyclic olefin. Hydroborations of seven carbodiimides and nine isocyanates were performed at room temperature to form N&#8208;boryl formamidine and N&#8208;boryl formamide products. Intermolecular competition experiments demonstrated the selective hydroboration of alkyl isocyanates over carbodiimide and ketone substrates. DFT calculations support a proposed mechanism involving activation of pinacolborane by the carbodiphosphorane catalyst, followed by hydride transfer and B&#8211;N bond formation.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis and Evaluation of Glycosyl Luciferins</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Measuring glycosidase activity is important to monitor any aberrations in carbohydrate hydrolase activity, but also for the screening of potential glycosidase inhibitors. To this end, synthetic substrates are needed which provide an enzyme&#8208;dependent read&#8208;out upon hydrolysis by the glycosidase. Herein, we present two new routes for the synthesis of caged luminescent carbohydrates, which can be used for determining glycosidase activity with a luminescent reporter molecule. The substrates were validated with glycosidase and revealed a clear linear range and enzyme&#8208;dependent signal upon in situ generation of the luciferin moiety from the corresponding nitrile precursors. Besides, we showed that these compounds could directly be synthesized from unprotected glycosyl&#8208;&#945;&#8208;fluorides in a two&#8208;step procedure with yields up to 75%. The intermediate methyl imidate appeared a key intermediate which also reacted with d&#8208;cysteine to give the corresponding d&#8208;luciferin substrate rendering this a highly attractive method for synthesizing glycosyl luciferins in good yields.</dc:description>

         <title>Bioinspired Non&#8208;Heme Mn Catalysts for Regio&#8208; and Stereoselective Oxyfunctionalizations with H2O2</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mn catalyzed C&#8208;H activation: In recent years, Mn based catalysts have been at the forefront of direct oxidative functionalization of organic compounds with hydrogen peroxide. This contribution surveys the progress in this emerging area, achieved in the past five years, with focus on the possibilities for tuning the chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208;, and stereoselectivity of these catalyst systems.







Abstract
In recent years, metalloenzymes&#8208;mediated highly selective oxidations of organic substrates under mild conditions have been inspiration for developing synthetic bioinspired catalyst systems, capable of conducting such processes in the laboratory (and, in the future, in industry), relying on easy&#8208;to&#8208;handle and environmentally benign oxidants such as H2O2. To date, non&#8208;heme manganese complexes with chiral bis&#8208;amino&#8208;bis&#8208;pyridylmethyl and structurally related ligands are considered as possessing the highest synthetic potential, having demonstrated the ability to mediate a variety of chemo&#8208; and stereoselective oxidative transformations, such as epoxidations, C(sp3)&#8208;H hydroxylations and ketonizations, oxidative desymmetrizations, kinetic resolutions, etc. Furthermore, in the past few years non&#8208;heme Mn based catalysts have become the major platform for studies focused on getting insight into the molecular mechanisms of oxidant activation and (stereo)selective oxygen transfer, testing non&#8208;traditional hydroperoxide oxidants, engineering catalytic sites with enzyme&#8208;like substrate recognition&#8208;based selectivity, exploration of catalytic regioselectivity trends in the oxidation of biologically active substrates of natural origin. This contribution summarizes the progress in manganese catalyzed C&#8208;H oxygenative transformations of organic substrates, achieved essentially in the past 5&#8197;years (late 2018&#8211;2023).

         <title>Cage&#8208;Shaped Phosphites Having C3&#8208;Symmetric Chiral Environment: Steric Control of Lewis Basicity and Application as Chiral Ligands in Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed Conjugate Additions</title>

         <dc:description>
C3&#8208;symmetric chiral cage&#8208;shaped phosphites were developed as a new type of chiral ligand. Their Lewis basicity and chiral environment are precisely controlled by the tethered group. The cage&#8208;shaped phosphites successfully worked as chiral ligands in Rh&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric conjugate additions, realizing acceptable yields with excellent enantioselectivity, and were used to synthesize a pharmacologically important molecule.







Abstract
Designing chiral ligands with an axial symmetry higher than C2&#8208;rotational symmetry is one of the most crucial approaches to improving enantioselectivity in asymmetric synthesis. Herein, C3&#8208;symmetric chiral cage&#8208;shaped phosphites are reported. Their Lewis basicity and chiral environment are precisely controlled by the tethered group. The cage&#8208;shaped phosphites successfully worked as chiral ligands in Rh&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric conjugate additions, realizing acceptable yields with excellent enantioselectivity, and were used to synthesize a pharmacologically important molecule.

         <title>&#8220;Click&#8221; Chemistry for the Functionalization of Graphene Oxide with Phosphorus Dendrons: Synthesis, Characterization and Preliminary Biological Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Several dendrons were functionalized on their surface by different types of pyridine&#8208;imine functions, and at their core by either azide or alkyne. These dendrons were grafted to graphene oxide (GO) via &#8220;click&#8221; reactions between azide or alkyne at their core, and alkynes or azides on the surface of GO, respectively. The biological properties of these new materials were tested.







Abstract
Two families of phosphorhydrazone dendrons having either an azide or an alkyne linked to the core and diverse types of pyridine derivatives as terminal functions have been synthesized and characterized. These dendrons were grafted via click reaction to graphene oxide (GO) functionalized with either alkyne or azide functions, respectively. The resulting modified&#8208;GO and GO&#8208;dendrons materials have been characterized by Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR), Raman spectroscopy (RS), and Magic Angle Spinning Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (MAS&#8197;NMR) analyses. In addition, the free dendrons and the dendrons grafted to GO were tested toward cancerous (HCT116) and non&#8208;cancerous (RPE1) cell lines.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aroyl&#8208;S,N&#8208;ketene acetals have experienced a renaissance from a synthetic heterocyclic peculiarity as a short dipole with strong push&#8208;pull characteristics to a promising class of dyes with pronounced controllable and tunable solid&#8208;state and aggregation&#8208;induced emission properties, thus allowing for a methodical and synthetical extension of the system.







Abstract
Aroyl&#8208;S,N&#8208;ketene acetals represent a peculiar class of heterocyclic merocyanines, compounds bearing pronounced and rather short dipoles with great push&#8208;pull characteristics that define their rich properties. They are accessible via a wide array of synthetic concepts and procedures, ranging from addition&#8208;elimination and condensation procedures up to rearrangement and metal&#8208;mediated reactions. With our work from 2020, aroyl&#8208;S,N&#8208;ketene acetals have been identified as powerful and promising dyes with pronounced and vastly tunable solid&#8208;state emission and aggregation&#8208;induced emission properties. One characteristic trademark of this class of dye molecules is the level of control that could be exerted, and which was thoroughly explored. Based on these results, the field was opened to extend the system to bi&#8208; and multichromophoric systems by the full toolkit of synthetic organic chemistry thus giving access to even more exciting properties and manifolded substance libraries capitalizing on the AIE properties. This review aims at outlining the reaction&#8208;based principles that allow for a swift and facile access to aroyl&#8208;S,N&#8208;ketene acetals, their methodical and structural evolution and the plethora of fluorescence and aggregation properties.

         <title>&#960;&#8208;Extended Hexapyrrolylbenzenes: Exploring Charge&#8208;Transfer Phenomena in Donor&#8208;Acceptor Propellers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hexapyrrolylbenzenes bearing electron&#8208;rich and electron&#8208;poor pyrrole units undergo charge transfer upon irradiation. It is most efficient between ortho&#8208;positioned donors and acceptors, for which it can occur even in non&#8208;polar solvents, but it will also take place between para&#8208;substituents in more polar media.







Abstract
A family of propeller&#8208;shaped donor&#8208;acceptor hexapyrrolylbenzenes (HPBs) were designed and synthesized by sequential nucleophilic substitution of hexafluorobenzene with &#960;&#8208;extended pyrroles. In particular, four hybrids were obtained, containing various combinations of electron&#8208;rich and electron&#8208;poor acenaphthylene&#8208;fused pyrroles. Additionally, to probe the efficiency of ortho transfer interactions, a system was designed containing unique donor and acceptor subunits spatially separated with four unfunctionalized pyrroles. DFT calculations showed propeller&#8208;shaped geometries of all HPB molecules and separation of frontier molecular orbitals between donor and acceptor subunits. Steady&#8208;state and time&#8208;resolved photophysical measurements revealed charge&#8208;transfer (CT) character of the emission with strong positive dependence on solvent polarity. The principal CT pathway involves ortho&#8208;positioned pairs of donors and acceptors and requires bending of the acceptor in the excited state.

         <title>Pillar[5]arene&#8208;Based Fluorescent Supramolecular Polymers Without Conventional Chromophores</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fluorescent supramolecular polymers have garnered significant attention due to their successful integration of supramolecular polymers and fluorescence, offering vast potential for applications in sensing, imaging, optoelectronics, and photonics. In this study, we present a novel supramolecular polymer based on P5&#8208;OH, derived from mono&#8208;substituted pillararene macrocycles. Notably, these formed supramolecular polymeric aggregates exhibit a prominent blue emission, representing a rare instance of fluorescent polymers devoid of conventional chromophores. Furthermore, through the modification of alkyl chain ending groups attached to pillar[5]arenes, slight shifts in the emission peak could be observed. This research expands the scope of functional supramolecular polymeric systems utilizing pillararenes, providing valuable insights for the design of innovative luminescent materials and optical devices.</dc:description>

         <title>A discrete, boron&#8208;containing triangular triradical</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A neutral boron&#8208;containing triangular triradical based on a triptycene derivative has been designed and synthesized. Its structure, bonding and physical property have been studied by EPR spectroscopy, SQUID magnetometry and single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, as well as theoretical calculations. The triradical has a series of isosceles triangle conformations in the solution due to the Jahn&#8208;Teller distortion, leading to the splitting of the two low&#8208;lying doublet states. This factor together with negligible spin&#8208;orbit coupling (SOC) of composing light atoms quenches the spin frustration. The work represents a rare example of a&#160; neutral through&#8208;space triangular triradical.</dc:description>

         <title>Sheet&#8208;Isolated MoS2 Used for Dispersing Pt Nanoparticles and its Application in Methanol Fuel Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>It is highly challenging to activate the basal plane and minimize the &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking of MoS2 sheets, thus enhancing its catalytic performance. Here, we display an approach for making well&#8208;dispersed MoS2. By using the N&#8208;doped multi&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes (NMWCNTs) as an isolation unit, the aggregation of MoS2 sheets was effectively reduced, favoring the dispersion of Pt nanoparticles (noted as Pt/NMWCNTs&#8208;isolated&#8208;MoS2). Excellent bifunctional catalytic performance for the methanol oxidation and oxygen reduction reaction (MOR/ORR) was demonstrated by the produced Pt/NMWCNTs&#8208;isolated&#8208;MoS2. In comparison to Pt nanoparticles supported on MoS2 (Pt/MoS2), the MOR activity (2314.14 mA mg&#8211;1Pt) and stability (317.69 mA mg&#8211;1 Pt after 2 h of operation) on Pt/NMWCNTs&#8208;isolatedMoS2 were 24 and 232 times higher, respectively. As for ORR, Pt/NMWCNTs&#8208;isolated&#8208;MoS2 holds large half&#8208;wave potential (0.88 V) and high stability (92.71% after 22 h of operation). This work presents a tactic for activating the basal planes and reducing the &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking of 2D materials to satisfy their applications in electrocatalysis. In addition, the proposed sheet&#8208;isolation method can be used for fabricating other 2D materials to promote the dispersion of nanoparticles to apply in other fields of energy as well as the environment.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of bridged tetrazoles with promising properties and potential applications by a one&#8208;step Finkelstein reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Numerous nitramine bridged compounds which show promising combinations of properties have already been identified in the area of energetic materials. In this work, four new nitrazapropane bridged tetrazoles, as well as four new trinitrazaheptane tetrazoles and three oxapropane bridged tetrazoles were synthesized and fully characterized. These new compounds can all be synthesized by a simple, one&#8208;step synthesis using Finkelstein conditions. All of these new energetic materials were characterized using NMR spectroscopy, single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, vibrational analysis and elemental analysis. The thermal behaviour of these compounds was studied by differential thermal analysis (DTA) and partly by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). The BAM standard method was used to determine the sensitivities towards impact (IS) and friction (FS). The enthalpies of formation were calculated at the CBS&#8208;4M level, and the energetic performances were calculated using the EXPLO5 (V6.06.01) computer code. The properties of the new compounds were compared to each other as well as to the known energetic material RDX. Moreover, the iron(II) and copper(II) perchlorate complexes with 1,3&#8208;bis&#8208;1,1&#8208;tetrazolylnitrazapropane as ligand were prepared and investigated.</dc:description>

         <title>Deamination of Polyols from the Glycolysis of Polyurethane</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Methylenedianiline (MDA) is a secondary, undesired, product of the glycolysis process of polyurethane (PU) scraps due to hydrolysis and pyrolysis side reactions. As an aromatic and carcinogen amine, MDA poses different problems in handling, transporting, and labelling recycled polyols derived from glycolysis, hindering the closure of PU recycling loop.Aiming to provide a solution to this issue, in this work different deaminating agents (DAs) where investigated with the purpose of analyzing their reactivity with MDA. A first part of the study was devoted to the analysis of MDA formation as a function of reaction time and catalyst concentration (potassium acetate) during glycolysis. It was observed that the amount of MDA increases almost linearly with the extent of PU depolymerization and catalyst content. Among the DAs analyzed 2&#8208;ethylhexyl glycidyl ether (2&#8208;EHGE), and acetic anhydride (Ac2O) showed interesting performance, allowing to diminish MDA content below the limit for labelling prescription in 30 minutes. PU rigid foams were therefore synthesized from the corresponding recycled products and characterized in terms of thermal and mechanical performance. Ac2O&#8208;deaminated polyols led to structurally unstable foams with poor compressive strength, while 2&#8208;EHGE&#8208;deaminated products allowed the production of foams with improved mechanical performance and unaltered thermal conductivity.</dc:description>

         <title>From One&#8208;dimensional Disordered Racemate to Ordered Racemic Conglomerates through Metal Coordination Driven Self&#8208;Assembly at the Liquid&#8208;Solid Interface</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In recent years, there has been significant focus on investigating and controlling chiral self&#8208;assembly, specifically in the context of enantiomeric separation. This study explores the self&#8208;assembly behavior of 4&#8208;dodecyl&#8208;3,6&#8208;di(2&#8208;pyridyl)pyridazine (DPP&#8208;C12) at the interface between heptanoic acid (HA) and highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG) using a combination of scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and multiscale molecular modeling. The self&#8208;assembled monolayer structure formed by DPP&#8208;C12 is periodic in one direction, but aperiodic in the direction orthogonal to it. These structures resemble 1D disordered racemic compounds. Upon introducing palladium [Pd(II)] ions, complexing with DPP&#8208;C12, these 1D disordered racemic compounds spontaneously transform into 2D racemic conglomerates, which is rationalized with the assistance of force&#8208;field simulations. Our findings provide insights into the regulation of two&#8208;dimensional chirality.</dc:description>

         <title>Cd/Cd(OH)2 Nanosheets Enhancing the Electrocatalytic Activity of CO2 Reduction to CO</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electric&#8208;driven conversion of carbon dioxide (CO2) to carbon monoxide (CO) under mild reaction conditions offers a promising approach to mitigate the greenhouse effect and the energy crisis. The surface engineering is believed to be one of the prospective methods for enhancing the electrocatalytic activity&#160;of CO2 reduction. Herein, the hydroxyl (OH) groups were successfully introduced to cadmium nanosheets to form cadmium and cadmium hydroxide nanocomposites (i.e. Cd/Cd(OH)2 nanosheets) via a facile two&#8208;step method. The as&#8208;prepared Cd/Cd(OH)2/CP (CP indicates carbon paper) electrode displays excellent electrocatalytic activity for CO2 reduction to produce CO. The Faradaic efficiency of CO reaches 98.3% and the current density achieves 23.8 mA cm&#8208;2 at &#8208;2.0 V vs. Ag/Ag+ in a CO2&#8208;saturated 30 wt% 1&#8208;butyl&#8208;3&#8208;methylimidazole hexafluorophosphate ([Bmim]PF6)&#8208;65 wt% acetonitrile (CH3CN)&#8208;5 wt% water (H2O) electrolyte. And the CO partial current density can reach up to 71.6 mA cm&#8208;2 with the CO Faradaic efficiency of more than 85% at &#8208;2.3 V vs. Ag/Ag+, which stands out against Cd/CP, Cd(OH)2/CP, and Cd/CdO/CP electrodes. The excellent electrocatalytic performance of the Cd/Cd(OH)2/CP electrode can be attributed to its unique structural properties, suitable OH groups, perfect interaction with electrolyte, abundant active sites and fast electron transfer rate.</dc:description>

         <title>Probing Radical Addition to 1&#8208;Phosphabutadienes by Employing Muonium as a &#8220;Light Isotope&#8221; of Hydrogen</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Understanding free radical addition to multiple bonds is important to elucidating the mechanistic details of addition polymerization reactions, albeit the fleeting radical intermediates are very difficult to detect by conventional methodologies. Muon spin spectroscopy (&#181;SR) is a highly sensitive method that can detect radical species at 106 spins (cf. EPR: 1012 spins, NMR: 1018 spins). Herein, we employ &#181;SR to detect the radical&#8208;addition products from three 1&#8208;phosphabutadiene monomers, P&#8208;analogues of isoprene. We show that muonium (Mu), a &#8220;light&#8221; H&#8208;atom surrogate, adds predominantly at the C4 position of the P1=C2&#8211;C3=C4 moiety to give unprecedented 1&#8208;phosphaallyl radicals as the major products. Our structural assignments are supported by assignment of muon, phosphorus and proton hyperfine coupling constants using DFT&#8208;calculations. A minor radical product is also detected that is tentatively assigned to an PC3&#8208;heterocyclic free radical. On the basis of DFT&#8208;predictions, we speculate that its formation may involve initial addition of Mu+ at the C3 position followed by electron capture. These studies provide rare insights into the prospective radical (or cationic) polymerization of 1&#8208;phosphabutadienes, which have previously been polymerized using anionic initiation.</dc:description>

         <title>Engineering a Cl&#8208;&#8208;Modulated Light&#8208;Driven Na+ Pump</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Microbial Na+&#8208;pumping rhodopsin (NaR) is a promising optogenetic tool due to its unique ability to transport Na+. Like most rhodopsin&#8208;based tools, NaR is limited to light&#8208;based control. In this study, our objective was to develop a novel mode of modulation for NaR beyond light control. By introducing a potential Cl&#8208; binding site near the putative Na+ release cavity, we engineered Nonlabens dokdonensis rhodopsin 2 (NdR2) to be modulated by Cl&#8208;, an essential chemical in organisms. The engineered NdR2 demonstrated an approximately two&#8208;fold increase in Na+ pump activity in the presence of 100 mM Cl&#8208; compared to Cl&#8208;&#8208;free solution. Increasing Cl&#8208; concentration decreased the lifetimes of the M and O intermediates accordingly. The analysis of competitive ion uptake suggested the bound Cl&#8208; may increase the Na+ affinity and selectivity. This chemical modulation allows for more diverse and precise control over cellular processes, advancing the development of next&#8208;generation optogenetic tools. Notably, our Cl&#8208;&#8208;modulated NdR2 establishes an innovative mechanism for linking Cl&#8208; to Na+&#8208;related processes, with potential applications in optogenetic therapies for related diseases.</dc:description>

         <title>Niobium&#8208;Based Oxide for Anode Materials for Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Recently, it has become imperative to develop high energy density as well as high safety lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBS) to meet the growing energy demand. Among the anode materials used in LIBs, the currently used commercial graphite has low capacity and is a safety hazard due to the formation of lithium dendrites during the reaction. Among the transition metal oxide (TMO) anode materials, TMO based on the intercalation reaction mechanism has a more stable structure and is less prone to volume expansion than TMO based on the conversion reaction mechanism, especially the niobium&#8208;based oxide in it has attracted much attention. Niobium&#8208;based oxides have a high operating potential to inhibit the formation of lithium dendrites and lithium deposits to ensure safety, and have stable and fast lithium ion transport channels with excellent multiplicative performance. This review summarizes the recent developments of niobium&#8208;based oxides as anode materials for lithium&#8208;ion batteries, discusses the special structure and electrochemical reaction mechanism of the materials, the synthesis methods and morphology of nanostructures, deficiencies and improvement strategies, and looks into the future developments and challenges of niobium&#8208;based oxide anode materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Facile Synthesis of Multifunctional Ni(OH)2&#8208;supported Core&#8208;shell Ni@Pd Nanocomposites for the Electro&#8208;oxidation of Small Organic Molecules</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In the domain of proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs), the development of efficient and durable catalysts for the electro&#8208;oxidation of  small  organic molecules, especially of alcohols (methanol, ethanol, ethylene glycol, et al.) has always been a hot topic. A large number of related electrocatalysts with splendid performance have been designed and synthesized till now, while the preparation processes of most of them are demanding on experimental operations and conditions. Herein, we put forward a facile and handy method for the preparation of multifunctional Ni(OH)2&#8208;supported core&#8208;shell Ni@Pd nanocomposites (Ni(OH)2/Ni@Pd NCs) with the assistance of galvanic replacement reaction (GRR) at room temperature and ambient pressure. As expected, the Ni(OH)2 substrate can prevent the aggregation of core&#8208;shell (CS) Ni@Pd nanoparticles (NPs) and inhibit the formation of COads and further prevent Pd from being poisoned. The synergistic effect between CS Ni@Pd NPs and Ni(OH)2 substrate and the electronic effect between Pd shell and Ni core contribute to the outstanding electrocatalytic performance for methanol, ethanol, and ethylene glycol oxidation in alkaline condition. This study provides a succinct method for the design and preparation of efficient Pd&#8208;based electrocatalysts for alcohol electro&#8208;oxidation.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The fully functionalized A&#8211;F fragment of the Pacific ciguatoxin CTX3C has been synthesized from a derivative of D&#8208;glucal, which serves as the B&#8208;ring. Rings A and C were introduced to either side of ring B by ring&#8208;closing diene and enyne metathesis (RCM). The seven&#8208;membered D&#8208;ring and eight&#8208;membered E&#8208;ring were assembled by iterative use of a six&#8208;step reaction sequence in which RCM was used for ring construction and Tsuji&#8208;Trost allylation was employed for subsequent stereoselective functionalization. The nine&#8208;membered F&#8208;ring was formed by use of an RCM reaction and bears the functionality required for attachment of the I&#8211;M fragment and subsequent closure of rings G and H.</dc:description>

         <title>Dioxygen Activation and Reduction by a Soluble Iron Phthalocyanine</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Iron ions in a square&#8208;planar coordination can bind molecules at the vacant axial positions and are able to transform them in stoichiometric and catalytic reactions. Nature takes advantage of these properties by incorporating iron into porphyrin systems, which play a key role not only in the binding and transport of oxygen, but also in catalytic oxidation and reduction reactions involving cytochrome P450. Although these systems have been studied extensively, there are still unresolved questions regarding the interplay between the iron ions and the surrounding ligands. Phthalocyanines (Pc) create a similar environment for metal atoms and FePc is known for a long time. However, without axial ligands FePc aggregates leading to solids of low solubility. In this work we used a known six&#8208;coordinate iron phthalocyanine derivative with bulky substituents and removed the stabilizing axial ligands. The resulting paramagnetic, four&#8208;coordinate compound does not aggregate and dissolves well so that NMR spectroscopy can be employed for studying the molecular structure and the reactivity. Solvent molecules bind weakly to the iron centers and oxygen is reduced in the presence of H&#8208;atom donors. The stoichiometric and catalytic reactivity with oxygen was studied in more detail.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Functional Isosorbide&#8208;Based Polyesters and Polyamides by Passerini Three&#8208;Component Polymerization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A new family of functional isosorbide&#8208;based polyesters and polyamides with high glass transition temperature are prepared via Passerini&#8208;three component polymerization (P&#8208;3CP). To optimize the P&#8208;3CP conditions, the influence of the polymerization solvent, temperature, feed ratio on the molar mass of final polymers are investigated. The higher molar mass (up to 10100 g/mol) and yield (&gt;70%) are achieved under mild conditions (30 &#176;C, standard atmosphere). Functional side groups, such as alkenyl, alkynyl and methyl ester, were introduced into polymer structure via P&#8208;3CP by using functional isocyanides. The obtained polyesters and polyamides are characterized by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and infrared (IR) spectroscopies, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA). All polymers are thermal stable and amorphous with variable glass transition temperatures (Tg). The obtained polyester has Tg up to 87.5 &#176;C, while the Tg of polyamides (ISPA&#8208;2) is detected to be 97.5 &#176;C depending on the amide bonds in the polymer backbone and the benzene ring side groups. The cytotoxicity is investigated by the CCK&#8208;8 assay against mBMSC cells to confirm the biological safety. Overall, this novel strategy provides an efficient approach to produce functional isosorbide&#8208;based polyesters and polyamides, which are promising prospect for being applied to biodegradable materials.</dc:description>

         <title>New protocol for the synthesis of S&#8208;thioesters from benzylic, allylic and tertiary alcohols with thioacetic acid</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A new one&#8208;pot solvent&#8208;less reaction to convert benzylic, allylic, ferrocenyl or tertiary alcohols into S&#8208;thioesters, bench&#8208;stable and less odorous precursors of the corresponding thiols, which is based on reactions in neat thioacetic acid in the presence of tetrafluoroboric acid, is presented. Reaction monitoring by NMR and GC of the benzyl alcohol conversion indicated the intermediate formation of benzyl acetate and benzyl thionoacetate (PhCH2OC(S)CH3) prior to the slower conversion to the final S&#8208;benzyl thioacetate product. Increasing the HBF4 concentration enhanced the reaction rate, giving good to excellent yield (up to 99%) for a large scope of alcohols. Control experiments, with support of DFT calculations, have revealed a thermodynamically favorable, though requiring HBF4&#8208;activation, disproportionation of CH3C(O)SH to CH3C(O)OH and CH3C(S)SH, the latter immediately decomposing to H2S and (MeC)4S6 but also generating the hitherto unreported [MeC(O)C(Me)S]2(&#181;&#8208;S)2. Kinetic investigations demonstrated that the rate of benzyl alcohol conversion is second&#8208;order in [PhCH2OH] and second order in [HBF4], while the rate of conversion of the benzyl acetate intermediate to S&#8208;benzyl thioacetate is second order in [PhCOOMe] and fourth order in [HBF4].

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Amphiphobic fluoroalkyl chains are exploited for creating robust and diverse self&#8208;assembled biomimetic catalysts in aqueous solution. Long terminal perfluoroalkyl chains (CnF2n+1 with n = 6, 8, and 10) yoked with a short perhydroalkyl chains (CmH2m with m = 2 and 3) were used to synthesize several 1,4,7&#8208;triazacyclononane (TACN) derivatives, CnF2n+1&#8208;CmH2m&#8208;TACN. In the presence of an equimolar amount of Zn2+ ions that coordinate the TACN moiety and drive the self&#8208;assembly into micelle&#8208;like aggregates, the critical aggregation concentration of polyfluorinated CnF2n+1&#8208;CmH2mTACN&#183;Zn2+ was lowered by ~1 order of magnitude compared to the traditional perhyroalkyl counterpart with identical carbon number of alkyl chain. When 2&#8217;&#8208;hydroxypropyl&#8208;4&#8208;nitrophenyl phosphate was used as the model phosphate substrate, polyfluorinated CnF2n+1CmH2m&#8208;TACN&#183;Zn2+ assemblies showed higher affinity and catalytic activity, compared to its perhyroalkyl chain&#8208;based counterpart. Coarse&#8208;grained molecular dynamic simulations have been introduced to explore the supramolecular assembly of polyfluoroalkyl chains in the presence of Zn2+ ions and to better understand their enhanced catalytic activity.</dc:description>

         <title>Metal&#8208;free Covalent organic frameworks for Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is the key reaction in metal air and fuel cells. Among the catalysts towards ORR, carbon&#8208;based metal&#8208;free catalysts are getting more attention because of their maximum atom utilization, effective active sites and satisfactory catalytic activity and stability. However, the pyrolysis synthesis of these carbons resulted in disordered porosities and uncontrolled catalytic sites, which hindered us to achieve the catalysts&#8217; properties previously, and build the structure&#8211;property relationship at molecular level. Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) constructed with designable building blocks have been employed as metal free electrocatalysts towards oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) due to their controlled skeletons, tailored pores size and environments, and well&#8208;defined location and kinds of catalytic sites. In this concept article, the development of metal&#8208;free COFs for ORR is summarized, and different strategies including skeletons regulation, linkages engineering and edge&#8208;sites modulation to improve the catalytic selectivity and activity are discussed. Furthermore, this Concept provides prospective for design and construction high electrocatalysts based on the catalytic COFs.</dc:description>

         <title>Optimization of 3D synthetic scaffolds for neuronal tissue engineering applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The increasing prevalence of neurodegenerative diseases has spurred researchers to develop advanced 3D models that accurately mimic neural tissues. Hydrogels stand out as ideal candidates as their properties closely resemble those of the extracellular matrix. A critical challenge in this regard is to comprehend the influence of the scaffold's mechanical properties on cell growth and differentiation, thus enabling targeted modifications. In light of this, a synthesis and comprehensive analysis of acrylamide&#8208;based hydrogels incorporating a peptide has been conducted. Adequate cell adhesion and development is achieved due to their bioactive nature and specific interactions with cellular receptors. The integration of a precisely controlled physicochemical hydrogel matrix and inclusion of the arginine&#8208;glycine&#8208;aspartic acid peptide sequence has endowed this system with an optimal structure, thus providing a unique ability to interact effectively with biomolecules. The analysis fully examined essential properties governing cell behavior, including pore size, mechanical characteristics, and swelling ability. Cell&#8208;viability experiments were performed to assess the hydrogel&#8217;s biocompatibility, while the incorporation of grow factors aimed to promote the differentiation of neuroblastoma cells. The results underscore the hydrogel&#8217;s ability to stimulate cell viability and differentiation in the presence of the peptide within the matrix.</dc:description>

         <title>Reticular Synthesis of Flexible Rare&#8208;Earth Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks: Control of Structural Dynamics and Sorption Properties Through Ligand Functionalization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An exciting direction in metal&#8208;organic frameworks involves the design and synthesis of flexible structures which can reversibly adapt their structure when triggered by external stimuli. Controlling the extent and nature of response in such solids is critical in order to develop custom dynamic materials for advanced applications. Towards this, it is highly important to expand the diversity of existing flexible MOFs, generating novel materials and gain an in&#8208;depth understanding of the associated dynamic phenomena, eventually unlocking key structure&#8208;property relationships. In the present work, we successfully utilized reticular chemistry for the construction of two novel series of highly crystalline, flexible rare&#8208;earth MOFs, RE&#8208;thc&#8208;MOF&#8208;2 and RE&#8208;teb&#8208;MOF&#8208;1. Extensive single&#8208;crystal to single&#8208;crystal structural analyses coupled with detailed gas and vapor sorption studies, shed light onto the unique responsive behavior. The development of these series is related to the reported RE&#8208;thc&#8208;MOF&#8208;1 solids which were found to display a unique continuous breathing and gas&#8208;trapping property. The synthesis of RE&#8208;thc&#8208;MOF&#8208;2 and RE&#8208;teb&#8208;MOF&#8208;1 materials represents an important milestone as they provide important insights into the key factors that control the responsive properties of this fascinating family of flexible materials and demonstrates that it is possible to control their dynamic behavior and the associated gas and vapor sorption properties.</dc:description>

         <title>High Mannose Oligosaccharide Hemimimetics that Recapitulate the Conformation and Binding Mode to Concanavalin A, DC&#8208;SIGN and Langerin</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The "carbohydrate chemical mimicry" exhibited by sp2&#8208;iminosugars has been utilized to develop practical syntheses for analogs of the branched high&#8208;mannose&#8208;type oligosaccharides (HMOs) Man3 and Man5. In these compounds, the terminal nonreducing Man residues have been substituted with 5,6&#8208;oxomethylydenemannonojirimycin (OMJ) motifs. The resulting oligomannoside hemimimetic accurately reproduce the structure, configuration, and conformational behavior of the original mannoligosaccharides, as confirmed by NMR and computational techniques. Binding studies with mannose binding lectins, including concanavalin A, DC&#8208;SIGN, and langerin, by enzyme&#8208;linked lectin assay and surface plasmon resonance revealed significant variations in their ability to accommodate the OMJ unit in the mannose binding site. Intriguingly, OMJMan segments demonstrated "in line" heteromultivalent effects during binding to the three lectins. Similar to the mannobiose (Man2) branches in HMOs, the binding modes involving the external or internal monosaccharide unit at the carbohydrate binding domain exist in equilibrium, facilitating sliding and recapture processes. This equilibrium, which influences the multivalent binding of HMOs, can be finely modulated upon incorporation of the OMJ sp2&#8208;iminosugar caps. As a proof of concept, the affinity and selectivity towards DC&#8208;SIGN and langerin were adjustable by presenting the OMJMan epitope in platforms with diverse architectures and valencies.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Homocubane, a highly strained cage hydrocarbon, contains two very different positions for the introduction of a nitrogen atom into the skeleton, e.g., a position 1 exchange results in a tertiary amine whereas position 9 yields a secondary amine.

Not only is 9&#8208;azahomocubane readily synthesized, and found to be stable as predicted, the basicity of the secondary amine was observed to be significantly lower than the structurally related azabicyclo[2.2.1]heptane, although similar to 1&#8208;azahomocubane.</dc:description>

         <title>Mechanochemical Oxidative Coupling of Amine to Azo&#8208;based Polymers by Hypervalent Iodine Oxidant</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Among porous organic polymers (POPs), azo&#8208;linked POPs represent a crucial class of materials, making them the focus of numerous catalytic systems proposed for their synthesis. However, the synthetic process is limited to metal&#8208;catalyzed, high&#8208;temperature, and liquid&#8208;phase reactions. In this study, we employ mechanochemical oxidative metal&#8208;free systems to encompass various syntheses of azo&#8208;based polymers. Drawing inspiration from the "rule of six" principle (six or more carbons on azide group render the organic compound relatively safe), an azo compound featuring significant steric hindrance is obtained using the hypervalent iodine oxidation strategy. Furthermore, during the polymerization process, steric hindrance is enhanced in monomers to effectively prevent explosions resulting from direct contact between hypervalent iodine oxidants and primary amines. Indeed, this approach provides a facile and innovative solid&#8208;phase synthesis method for synthesizing azo&#8208;based materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Review: Direct Lithium Extraction Using Intercalation Materials</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Worldwide lithium (Li) demand has surged in recent years due to increased production of Li&#8208;ion batteries for electric vehicles and stationary storage. Li supply and production will need to increase such that the transition towards increased electrification in the energy sector does not become cost prohibitive. Many countries have taken policy steps such as listing Li as a critical mineral. Current commercial Li mining is mostly from dedicated mine sources, including ores, clays, and brines. The conventional ways to extract Li+&#160;from those resources are through chemical processing. The environmental and economic sustainability of conventional Li processing has recently received increased scrutiny. Routes such as direct Li+&#160;extraction may provide advantages relative to conventional Li+&#160;extraction technologies, and one possible route to direct Li+&#160;extraction includes leveraging of intercalation materials. Intercalation material processing has recently demonstrated high selectivity towards Li+&#160;as opposed to other cations. Reviews and reports of direct Li+extraction with intercalation materials are limited, even as this technology has started to show promise in smaller scale demonstrations. This paper will review selective Li+&#160;extraction via intercalation materials, including both electrochemical and chemical methods to drive Li+&#160;in and out and efforts to characterize the Li+&#160;insertion/deinsertion processes.</dc:description>

This paper will review selective Li+&#160;extraction via intercalation materials, including both electrochemical and chemical methods to drive Li+&#160;in and out and efforts to characterize the Li+&#160;insertion/deinsertion processes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Benzylic C(sp3)&#8208;H bond oxidation with ketone selectivity by a cobalt(IV)&#8208;oxo embedded in a &#946;&#8208;barrel protein</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Artificial metalloenzymes have emerged as biohybrid catalysts that allow to combine the reactivity of a metal catalyst with the flexibility of protein scaffolds. Here, we report the artificial metalloenzymes based on the &#946;&#8208;barrel protein nitrobindin NB4, in which a cofactor [CoIIX(Me3TACD&#8208;Mal)]+X&#8208; (X = Cl, Br; Me3TACD = N,N&#180;,N&#180;&#180;&#8208;trimethyl&#8208;1,4,7,10&#8208;tetraazacyclododecane, Mal = CH2CH2CH2NC4H2O2) was covalently anchored via a Michael addition reaction. These biohybrid catalysts showed higher efficiency than the free cobalt complexes for the oxidation of benzylic C(sp3)&#8208;H bonds in aqueous media. Using commercially available oxone (2KHSO5&#183;KHSO4&#183;K2SO4) as oxidant, a total turnover number of up to 220 and 97% ketone selectivity were achieved for tetralin. As catalytically active intermediate, a mononuclear terminal cobalt(IV)&#8208;oxo species [Co(IV)=O]2+ was generated by reacting the cobalt(II) cofactor with oxone in aqueous solution and characterized by ESI&#8208;TOF MS.</dc:description>

(6&#8208;Dipp)CuB(OMe)2 was characterised by NMR spectroscopy and X&#8208;ray crystallography and shown to be a monomeric acyclic boryl of copper. (6&#8208;Dipp)CuB(OMe)2 reacted with ethylene and diphenylacetylene to provide insertion compounds into the Cu&#8208;B bond which were characterised by NMR spectroscopy in both cases and X&#8208;ray crystallography in the latter. It was also competent in the rapid catalytic deoxygenation of CO2 in the presence of excess B2(OMe)4. Alongside &#960;&#8208;insertion, (6&#8208;Dipp)CuB(OMe)2 reacted with LiNMe2 to provide a salt metathesis reaction at boron, giving (6&#8208;Dipp)CuB(OMe)NMe2, a second monomeric acyclic boryl, which also cuproborated diphenylacetylene. Computational interrogation validated these acyclic boryl species to be electronically similar to (6&#8208;Dipp)CuBpin.</dc:description>

         <title>Stereoselective Synthesis of Allylic Alcohols via Substrate Control on Asymmetric Lithiation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Allylic alcohols are a privileged motif in natural product synthesis and new methods that access them in a stereoselective fashion are highly sought after. Toward this goal, we found that chiral acetonide&#8208;protected polyketide fragments performing the Hoppe&#8211;Matteson&#8211;Aggarwal rearrangement in the absence of sparteine with high yields and diastereoselectivities rendering this protocol a highly valuable alternative to the Nozaki&#8211;Hiyama&#8211;Takai&#8211;Kishi reaction. Various stereodyads and &#8208;triads were investigated to determine their substrate induction. The mostly strong inherent stereoinduction was attributed to a combination of steric and electronic effects.</dc:description>

         <title>Conjugated Olefin Enabled Rollover Cyclometallation of Distant C&#8208;H Bonds: Regioselective Annulation of o&#8208;Alkenyl Phenols with Alkynes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Although challenging, the distant C&#8208;H functionalization with precision is quite rewarding and has long been intriguing. Tailoring an appropriate template accomplishes the job but the prerequisite sets the limitation. We herein unveil our discovery of annulation of alkynes on to two distant (from directing group) C&#8208;H bonds through rollover cyclometallation assisted by conjugated C=C bond. The annulation follows a concomitant cyclization rewarding a rare triple C&#8208;H functionalization. The annulation is totally regioselective with an array of unsymmetrical alkynes, taking the leverage of an extended conjugation or a tertiary hydroxyl co&#8208;ordination. The mechanism is supported by control experiments, KIE &amp; labelling studies and Mass spectrometry.</dc:description>

         <title>Living Self&#8208;Assembly of Metastable and Stable Two&#8208;Dimensional Platelets from a Single Small Molecule</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This study reports the design of a donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;A) molecule with two fluorene units on each side of a benzothiadiazole moiety, which allows multiple intermolecular interactions to compete with one another so as to induce the evolution of the metastable 2D platelets to the stable 2D platelets during the self&#8208;assembly of the D&#8208;A molecule. Importantly, the living seeded self&#8208;assembly of metastable and stable 2D structures with precisely controlled sizes can be conveniently achieved using an appropriate supersaturated solution of the D&#8208;A molecule as the seeded growth medium that can temporarily hold the almost&#8208;proceeding spontaneous nucleation from competing with the seeded growth. The stable 2D platelets with smaller area sizes exhibit higher sensitivity to gaseous dimethyl sulfide, illustrating that the novel living self&#8208;assembly method provides more available functional structures with controlled sizes for practical applications. The key finding of this study is that the new living methodology is separated into two independent processes: the elaborate molecular design for various crystalline structures as seeds and the application of an appropriate supersaturated solution as the growth medium to grow the uniform structures with controlled sizes; this would make convenient and possible the living seeded self&#8208;assembly of rich 1D, 2D, and 3D architectures.</dc:description>

The spike protein of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 has gained significant attention due to its crucial role in viral entry into host cells and its potential as both a prophylactic and a target for therapeutic interventions. Herein, we report the first successful total synthesis of the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD), highlighting the key challenges and the strategies employed to overcome them. Appropriate utilization of advanced solid phase peptide synthesis and cutting&#8208;edge native chemical ligation methods have facilitated the synthesis of the protein molecule. We discuss problems encountered during the chemical synthesis and approaches taken to optimize the yield and the purity of the synthetic protein molecule. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the chemically synthesized spike RBD efficiently binds to the known mini&#8208;protein binder LCB1. The successful chemical synthesis of the spike RBD presented here can be utilized to gain valuable insights into SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 spike RBD biology, advancing our understanding and aiding the development of intervention strategies to combat future coronavirus outbreaks. The modular synthetic approach described in this study can be effectively implemented in the synthesis of other mutated variants or enantiomer of spike RBD for mirror&#8208;image drug discovery.</dc:description>

         <title>Dense NiCo2O4 Nanoneedles Grown on Carbon Foam Showing Excellent Electrochemical and Microwave Absorption Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electromagnetic pollution could harm sensitive electronic equipment due to the rising use of electronic devices and communication infrastructure. The supercapacitor's electrochemical performance should be enhanced, and electromagnetic damage should be prevented. This study proposes NiCo2O4/CF composites for supercapacitors and microwave absorption. They are made by combining hydrothermal and annealing processes. Dense NiCo2O4 nanoneedles were uniformly grown on the outer layer of carbon foam (CF) as a growth skeleton, preventing the agglomeration of NiCo2O4. The composite had a specific capacitance of 537.5 F/g at 1 A/g. When the current density was set to 1 A/g, the supercapacitor that used NiCo2O4/CF as the cathode had a specific capacitance of 70.7 F/g, and when the current density was increased to 10 A/g, the original specific capacitance of 87.2% could still be maintained after 5000 charge&#8208;discharge cycles. At a power density of 3695.5 W/kg, an energy density of 22.1 Wh/kg could be maintained. Furthermore, we performed a microwave absorption test and determined its reflection loss curve for various sample thicknesses. Recombination enhanced the composite material's microwave absorption capability by greatly reducing the dielectric loss and the magnetic loss.</dc:description>

         <title>Catalyst&#8208;Free Transfer Hydrogenation from Amine&#8208;Borane Small Oligomers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Amine&#8208;borane dimers and oligomers with varied steric and electronic profiles were prepared via capping agent&#8208;controlled AA/BB polycondensations. They were used for transfer hydrogenations to aldehydes, ketones, imines as well as electron&#8208;poor alkene/alkyne moieties. The amine&#8208;borane Lewis&#8208;paired oligomers and the congested bis(amine&#8208;borane)s provided the highest yields. This was likely helped by facilitated dissociation (oligomers) or H&#8208;bond assistance. In the case of the oligomers, the second equivalent of H2 present was also engaged in the reaction. Solid&#8208;state NMR characterization provides evidence that the Boron&#8208;containing materials obtained after transfer dehydrogenation are highly similar to those obtained from thermal dehydrogenation. The oligomers bridge the gap between simple amine&#8208;borane molecular reductants and the poly&#8208;amine&#8208;boranes and provide a full picture of the reactivity changes at the different scales.</dc:description>

         <title>Bimetallic Manganese Catalysts: A Route to Controlled and Switchable Polymerization of Lactones</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The sustainable solution to the environmental problem of polymeric materials calls for efficient and well&#8208;controlled ring&#8208;opening polymerization catalytic systems. Inspired by the highly reactive and stereospecific bimetallic catalysts, three kinds of bimetallic Salen&#8208;Mn catalysts supported by biaryl linking moieties are synthesized and applied to polymerization catalysis of lactide (LA) and &#949;&#8208;caprolactone (&#949;&#8208;CL) in this work. The polymerization is initiated in situ by the ring&#8208;opening of epoxide compounds, in which the ionic cocatalyst could accelerate the reaction process. The Mn&#8208;Mn coordination effect contributes to the higher activity and iso&#8208;selectivity towards LA compared to the mononuclear Salen&#8208;Mn catalyst. The reactivity and stereoselectivity are determined by the conformation of catalysts, specifically the Mn&#8208;Mn separation and dihedral angle. Finally, the CO2&#8208;controlled switchable polymerizations are carried out with LA and &#949;&#8208;CL. The reversibility of the on&#8208;off switching operation is influenced by the combination between CO2 molecules and active species. The success in binuclear Salen&#8208;Mn catalysts not only expands the range of bimetallic catalyst analogues but also claims the promising potential of Mn&#8208;based catalysts in practical and theoretical research.</dc:description>

         <title>Molecular Accessibility and Diffusion of Resorufin in Zeolite Crystals</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We use confocal laser scanning microscopy on the small, fluorescent resorufin dye molecule to visualize molecular accessibility and diffusion in the hierarchical, anisotropic pore structure of large (~10 &#181;m&#8208;sized) zeolite&#8208;&#946; crystals. The resorufin dye is widely used in life and materials science, but only in its deprotonated form because the protonated molecule is barely fluorescent in aqueous solution. In this work, we show that protonated resorufin is in fact strongly fluorescent when confined within the zeolite micropores enabling fluorescence microimaging experiments. We find that J&#8208;aggregation guest&#8211;guest interactions lead to a decrease in the measured fluorescence intensity, but is prevented by using non&#8208;fluorescent spacer molecules. By introducing resorufin from the outside solution and following its diffusion into zeolite&#8208;&#946; crystals, we characterize the pore space. The eventual homogeneous distribution of resorufin molecules throughout the zeolite indicates a fully accessible pore network. This enables the quantification of its diffusion coefficient in the straight pores of zeolite&#8208;&#946; without the need for complex analysis, and we find a value of 3 &#215; 10&#8722;15 m2 s&#8722;1. Furthermore, we visualize that diffusion through the straight pores of zeolite&#8208;&#946; is impeded when crossing the boundaries between zeolite sub&#8208;units.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Temperature&#8208;modulated colloidal phase of plasmonic nanoparticles is a convenient playground for resettable soft&#8208;actuators or colorimetric sensors.&#160;To render reversible clustering under temperature change, bulky ligands are required, especially if anisotropic morphologies are of interest.&#160;Here, we showcase thermoresponsive gold nanorods by employing small surface ligands, bis (p&#8208;sulfonatophenyl) phenyl&#8208;phosphine dihydrate dipotassium salt (BSPP) and native cationic surfactant.&#160;Temperature&#8208;dependent analysis in real&#8208;time allowed us to describe the structural features (interparticle distance and cluster size) as well as thermal parameters, melting and freezing temperatures. Our findings suggest that neither covalent Au&#8208;S bonds nor bulky ligands are required to obtain a robust thermoresponsive system based on anisotropic gold nanoparticles, paving the way to stimuli&#8208;responsive nanoparticles with a wide range of sizes and geometries.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Efficient hydrogenations of terminal alkenes with molecular hydrogen catalyzed by well&#8208;defined bench stable Mn(I) complexes containing an N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene&#8208;based PCP pincer ligand are described. These reactions are environmentally benign and atom economic, implementing an inexpensive, earth abundant non&#8208;precious metal catalyst. A range of aromatic and aliphatic alkenes were efficiently converted into alkanes in good to excellent yields. The hydrogenation proceeds at 100 oC with catalyst loadings of 0.25&#8208;0.5 mol %, 2.5 &#8208; 5 mol % base (KOtBu) and a hydrogen pressure of 20 bar. Mechanistic insight into the catalytic reaction is provided by means of DFT calculations.</dc:description>

The hydrogenation proceeds at 100 oC with catalyst loadings of 0.25-0.5 mol %, 2.5 - 5 mol % base (KOtBu) and a hydrogen pressure of 20 bar. Mechanistic insight into the catalytic reaction is provided by means of DFT calculations.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Cobalt&#8208;Catalyzed bis&#8208;Borylation of Quinolines: The Importance of the Cobalt Triplet State</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report herein a mild stereo&#8208; and regioselective dearomatization of quinolines using the simple low valent HCo(N2)(PPh3)3 complex that exhibits labile ligands. Conditions to form selectively, at room temperature, high&#8208;valued 1,4&#8208;bis&#8208;borylated tetrahydroquinolines from simple starting heteroaromatic compounds have been developed. The efficient and selective functionalization of a large scope of quinolines bearing various electron&#8208;donating or electron&#8208;withdrawing substituents is presented, as well as the post&#8208;modification of the resulting C&#8211;B bond. NMR and labelling studies are consistent with a cascade mechanism pathway, starting from an in situ generated paramagnetic bis&#8208;quinoline cobalt(I) hydride complex. A first quinoline dearomatization followed by a cobalt(I)&#8208;catalyzed Markovnikov hydroboration of the remaining double bond allows the introduction of the boronic ester group only at C4 position. DFT calculations particularly highlight the importance of the cobalt triplet state throughout the reaction pathway, and bring some rationalization for the observed C4 selective borylation.</dc:description>
