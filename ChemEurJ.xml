      <dc:description>Herein, we present the synthesis of two pyrene&#8208;functionalized clusters, [(R  pyr  Sn)  4  S  6  ]&#183;2CH  2  Cl  2  (  4  ) and [(R  pyr  Sn)  4  Sn  2  S  10  ]&#183;nCH  2  Cl  2  (n&#160;=&#160;4,  5a  ; n&#160;=&#160;2,  5b  ; R  pyr&#160;  = CMe  2  CH  2  C(Me)N&#8208;NC(H)C  16  H  9  ), both of which form in reactions of the organotin sulfide cluster [(R  N  Sn)  4  S  6  ] (  C  ; R  N  = CMe  2  CH  2  C(Me)N&#8208;NH  2  ) with the well&#8208;known fluorescent dye 1&#8208;pyrenecarboxaldehyde (  B  ). In contrast, reactions using an organotin sulfide cluster with another core structure, [(R  N  Sn)  3  S  4  Cl] (  A  ), leads to formation of small molecular fragments, [(R  pyr  Cl  2  Sn)  2  S] (  1  ), (pyren&#8208;1&#8208;ylmethylene)hydrazine (  2  ), and 1,2&#8208;bis(pyren&#8208;1&#8208;ylmethylene)hydrazine (  3  ). Besides synthesis and structures of the new compounds, we report the influence of the inorganic core on the optical properties of the dye, which was analyzed exemplarily for compound  5a  via absorption and fluorescence spectroscopy. This cluster was also used for exploring the potential of such non&#8208;volatile clusters for deposition on a metal surface under vacuum conditions.</dc:description>

      <title>Frontispiece: Matrix Effects in a Fluid Catalytic Cracking Catalyst Particle: Influence on Structure, Acidity, and Accessibility</title>
      <dc:description>
Hydrocarbon cracking is an important process to make fuels and chemicals. Fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) catalysts are capable of doing this and are complex materials. They consist of a matrix (alumina, silica and clay) and an active component, a zeolite. Efficient cracking requires not only that there are a sufficient number of active sites, but also that these sites are accessible for the hydrocarbons. In this work, Velthoen and co&#8208;workers explore different cooking recipes to assess the influence of Br&#248;nsted and Lewis acidity, as well as their accessibility and structure on FCC performance. For more information, see the Full Paper on page&#8197;11995&#8197;ff.

      <title>Persistent Radical Pairs between N&#8208;Substituted Naphthalimide and Carbanion Exhibit pKa&#8208;Dependent UV/Vis Absorption
</title>
      <dc:description>
Fast screening of pKa: The UV/Vis absorption spectrum of carbanion radical pairs can serve as a tool to screen pKa values of various carbon acids.







Abstract
A new strategy was devised for estimating and screening pKa values among different carbon acids under ambient conditions by using the UV/Vis absorption spectrum of persistent radical pairs (PRPs), which are generated from an N&#8208;substituted naphthalimide (NNI) derivative in the presence of various carbanions in organic solutions. The electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy was used to examine the presence of radicals. Unexpectedly, it was discovered that the UV/Vis spectrum of PRPs reveals a distinct linear relationship between the PRP absorption and the pKa value of a corresponding carbon acid, which is likely due to the energy difference among different RPRs. The finding may offer organic chemists an alternative reference to conduct carbanion&#8208;mediated reactions in various organic solutions.

&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; value of a corresponding carbon acid, which is likely due to the energy difference among different RPRs. The finding may offer organic chemists an alternative reference to conduct carbanion&#8208;mediated reactions in various organic solutions.&lt;/p&gt;

Intramolecular electron transfer in deprotonated N&#8208;substituted naphthalimides and intermolecular electron transfer from carbanions to 6&#8208;bromo&#8208;N&#8208;phenyl&#8208;naphthalimide have been claimed to produce persistent, &#8220;EPR&#8208;active&#8221; triplet&#8208;state diradical anions and (anion) radical pairs. In this Correspondence, arguments against this claim are presented and supported.







Abstract
EPR spectroscopic evidence for intramolecular electron transfer in anionic N&#8208;substituted naphthalimides to yield persistent diradical anions and intermolecular electron transfer from a variety of carbanions to 6&#8208;bromo&#8208;N&#8208;phenyl&#8208;naphthalimide to yield persistent radical&#8211;radical anion pairs was recently claimed in two papers by Zhang et&#8197;al. In this comment, it is shown that the EPR spectra published in both papers do not agree with the proposed triplet&#8208;state species. Rather, the spectra are due to various doublet&#8208;state radicals, deriving from minor side reactions. The misinterpretations invalidate the general conclusions of the papers.

      <title>Asymmetric Acceptor&#8208;Donor&#8208;Acceptor Polymers with Fast Charge Carrier Transfer for Solar Hydrogen Production</title>
      <dc:description>Construction of local donor&#8208;acceptor architecture is one of the valid means for facilitating the intramolecular charge transfer in organic semiconductors. To further accelerate the interface charge transfer, a ternary acceptor&#8208;donor&#8208;acceptor (A1&#8208;D&#8208;A2) molecular junction is established via gradient nitrogen doping into the polymer skeleton. Accordingly, the exciton splitting and interface charge transfer could be promptly liberated because of the strong attracting ability of the two different electron acceptors. Both DFT calculations and photoluminescence spectra elucidate the swift charge transfer at the donor&#8208;acceptor interface. Consequently, the optimum polymer, N3&#8208;CP, undergoes a remarkable photocatalytic property in terms of hydrogen production with AQY405 nm = 26.6% by the rational design of asymmetric molecular junctions on organic semiconductors.</dc:description>

Furthermore, a two&#8208;step emission and aggregation process is controllable by varying the methanol&#8208;to&#8208;water ratio. At 2:3 MeOH:H  2  O, crystallization&#8208;induced emission enhancement (CIEE) occurs via formation of an emissive crystal phase, whereas, at 1:9 MeOH:H  2  O, aggregation&#8208;induced emission enhancement (AIEE) occurs, induced by emissive supramolecular nanoparticles (NPs). For  BNA&#8208;Ph  , the emission quantum yield was 25 times higher in aqueous methanol than that in pure methanol. Despite the high hydrophilicity of  BNA&#8208;X  (  C  log  P  = 6.1&#8722;8.0), the spherical NPs were monodisperse (polydispersity indices &lt; 0.2). Moreover, the emissive NPs exhibited fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) with pyrene; however, for  BNA&#8208;X  bearing the TEMPO radical (  BNA&#8208;BuTEMPO  ), no FRET was observed because of quenching. In particular, the  BNA&#8208;BuTEMPO  NPs have a slow rotational correlation time (1.3 ns), suggesting applications as magnetic resonance imaging contrast agents with large relaxivity.</dc:description>

      <title>Completely Amine&#8208;free Open Atmospheric Synthesis of High Quality Cesium Lead Bromide (CsPbBr3) Perovskite Nanocrystals</title>
      <dc:description>Cesium Lead Halide perovskite nanocrystals (NCs) &#160;have been prominent materials for light emitting diodes (LEDs) and other significant applications in photovoltaic and optoelectronics. The oleylamine which play an important role for surface passivation may also be responsible for poor colloidal stability as a result of facile proton exchange leading to the formation of labile oleylammonium ion halide which pulls out halide ion from NCs surface. In this work, we demonstrated a facile and efficient completely amine&#8208; free synthesis of cesium lead bromide perovskite nanocrystals using hydrobromic acid as halide source and n&#8208;trioctylphosphine (TOP) as ligand in open atmospheric conditions. The hydrobromic acid (HBr) served as labile source of bromide ion thus this three&#8208;precursor (separate precursors for Cs&#8208;Pb&#8208;Br) approach gives more control over conventional single source precursor for Pb and Br (PbBr  2  ). The use of HBr paved the way to eliminate oleylamine, thus we can completely exclude the formation of labile oleylammonium ion halide. We extensively studied the various Cs&#8208;Pb&#8208;Br molar ratio and found an optimum condition which able to make very stable with high PLQY CsPbBr  3  NCs. These completely amine free CsPbBr  3  perovskite NCs synthesized using bromine&#8208;rich condition exhibit good stability and durability for more than three months in the form of colloidal solutions and films respectively. More importantly, this work presents an open atmospheric stable CsPbBr  3  NCs films exhibiting high photoluminescence (PL) which can be further used for&#160;device applications.</dc:description>

      <title>Intermolecular C&#8211;H Activation at the Allylic/Benzylic and Homoallylic/Homobenzylic Positions of Cyclic Hydrocarbons by a Stable Divalent Silicon Species</title>
      <dc:description>Direct activation of inert C(sp  3  )&#8211;H bonds by main&#8208;group&#8208;element species is yet a formidable challenge. Herein, we report the dehydrogenation of cyclohexene and 1,2,3,4&#8208;tetrahydronaphthalene through the allylic/benzylic and homoallylic/homobenzylic C&#8211;H bond activation by cyclic (alkyl)(amino)silylene  1  in neat condition to yield the corresponding aromatic compounds. As for the reaction of cyclohexene, allylsilane  3  and 7&#8208;silanorbornene  4  were also observed, which could be interpreted as a direct dehydrogenative silylation reaction of monoalkenes at the allylic positions. Experimental and computational studies suggested that the dehydrogenation of cyclohexene at the homoallylic position was accomplished by a combination of silylene  1  and radical intermediates such as hydrosilyl radical  INT1  or cyclohexenyl radical  H  which are generated in the initial step of the reaction.</dc:description>

      <title>Increasing the complexity in the MIL&#8208;53 structure: The combination of the mixed&#8208;metal and the mixed&#8208;linker concepts</title>
      <dc:description>The isoreticular mixed&#8208;component concept is a promising approach to tailor material properties of metal&#8208;organic frameworks. While isoreticular mixed&#8208;metal or mixed&#8208;linker materials are commonly synthesized, the combination of both concepts for the development of isoreticular materials featuring both two metals and two linkers has rarely been investigated. Herein, we present the development of mixed&#8208;metal/mixed&#8208;linker MIL&#8208;53 materials, which contain different metal combinations (Al/Sc, Al/V, Al/Cr, Al/Fe) and different linker ratios (terephthalate/2&#8208;aminoterephthalate). The possibility to change the metal combination and the linker ratio independently from each other enables a large variety of modification possibilities. A thorough characterization (PXRD, ATR&#8208;IR, TGA,  1  H&#8208;NMR, ICP&#8208;OES) confirmed that all components were incorporated with a statistical distribution in the framework structure. Nitrogen physisorption measurements showed that the breathing behavior can be tailored by adjusting the linker ratio for all metal combinations. All materials were successfully used for post&#8208;synthetic modification with maleic anhydride.</dc:description>

      <title>Molybdenum&#8208;Catalyzed Deoxygenation Coupling of Lignin&#8208;Derived Alcohols for Functionalized Bibenzyl Chemicals</title>
      <dc:description>With the growing demand for sustainability and reducing CO  2&#160;  footprint, lignocellulosic biomass has attracted much attention as a renewable, carbon&#8208;neutral and low&#8208;cost feedstock for the production of chemicals and fuels. To realize efficient utilization of biomass resource, it is essential to selectively alter the high degree of oxygen functionality of biomass&#8208;derivates. Herein, we introduced a novel procedure to transform renewable lignin&#8208;derived alcohols to various functionalized bibenzyl chemicals. This strategy relied on a concise deoxygenation coupling pathway with economical molybdenum catalyst. A well&#8208;designed H&#8208;donor experiment was performed to investigate the mechanism of this Mo&#8208;catalyzed process. It was proved that benzyl carbon&#8208;radical was the most possible intermediate to form the bibenzyl products. It was also discovered that the para methoxy and phenolic hydroxyl groups could stabilize the corresponding radical intermediates and then facilitate to selectively obtain bibenzyl products. Our research provides a promising application to produce functionalized aromatics from biomass&#8208;derived materials.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>A Diels&#8211;Alder reaction&#8208;based strategy for the synthesis of indoles and related heterocycles is reported. An intramolecular cycloaddition of alkyne&#8208;tethered 3&#8208;aminopyrones gives 4&#8208;substituted indolines in good yield and with complete regioselectivity. Additional substitution is readily tolerated in the transformation, allowing synthesis of complex and non&#8208;canonical substitution patterns. Oxidative conditions give the corresponding indoles. The strategy also allows the synthesis of carbazoles. The method was showcased in a formal synthesis of lysergic acid.</dc:description>

      <title>Asymmetric Ring Opening in Tetrazine&#8208;based Ligand Affording a Tetranuclear Opto&#8208;Magnetic Ytterbium Complex</title>
      <dc:description>We report the formation of a tetranuclear lanthanide cluster, [Yb  4  (bpzch)  2  (fod)  10  ] (  1  ), which occurs from a serendipitous ring opening of the functionalized tetrazine bridging ligand, bpztz (3,6&#8208;dipyrazin&#8208;2&#8208;yl&#8208;1,2,4,5&#8208;tetrazine) upon reacting with Yb(fod)  3  (fod  &#8208;  = 6,6,7,7,8,8,8&#8208;heptafluoro&#8208;2,2&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;3,5&#8208;octandionate).

Computational studies validate the observed  M  J  energy levels attained by spectroscopy and provides a clearer picture of the slow relaxation of the magnetisation dynamics and relaxation pathways.

      <title>Directing Group&#8208;Promoted Inert C&#8211;O Bond Activation Using Versatile Boronic Acid as Coupling Agent</title>
      <dc:description>A simple Ni(cod) 2 and carbene mediated strategy facilitates the efficient catalytic cross&#8208;coupling of methoxyarenes with a variety of organoboron reagents. Directing groups facilitate the activation of inert C&#8211;O bonds in vastly under&#8208;utilized aryl methyl ethers enabling their adaptation for C&#8211;C cross&#8208;coupling reactions as less toxic surrogates to the ubiquitous haloarenes.

      <title>&#173;Rearrangements of Aromatic Nitrile Oxides and Nitrile Ylides. Potential Ring Expansion to Cycloheptatetraene Derivatives Mimicking Arylcarbenes</title>
      <dc:description>Nitrile imines, nitrile oxides and nitrile ylides are widely used in 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloaddition reactions. They also undergo thermal and photochemical rearrangements to carbodiimides, isocyanates, and ketenimines, respectively. Calculations at DFT and CASPT2 levels of theory reveal novel, potential rearrangements, in which the aromatic 1,3&#8208;dipoles mimic phenylcarbene and undergo ring expansion to cycloheptatetraene derivatives. These rearrangements can potentially take place in both the singlet ground states and the triplet excited states, and they are accelerated by m,m&#8217;&#8208;bis(dimethylamino) substitution on the phenyl moieties. The new rearrangement becomes the energetically preferred path for m,m&#8217;&#8208;bis(dimethylamino)benzonitrile oxide in the triplet state. In the m,m&#8217;&#8208;bis(dimethylamino)benzo nitrile ylide, the cyclization to the 2&#8208;phenyl&#8208;1&#8208;azirine is favoured over the ring expansion to a cycloheptatetraene by ca. 5 kcal/mol in the singlet state. In the bent triplet states, 1,3&#8208;hydrogen shifts interconverting nitrile ylides are potentially possible.</dc:description>

Surprisingly, 1 represents the first twisted wheel&#8208;shaped cluster with a record high&#8208;nuclear molybdenum(V) cobalto&#8208;phosphate. The delocalized electron effects of the cluster are enhanced with the help of coordinated py ligands, which endows 1 with an excellent third&#8208;order nonlinear optical (NLO) response.

      <title>Dinitrogen Fixation: Rationalizing Strategies Utilizing Molecular Complexes.</title>
      <dc:description>Dinitrogen (N  2  ) is the most abundant gas in the Earth&#8217;s atmosphere, but its inertness hinders its use as a nitrogen source in the biosphere and in industry. Efficient catalysts are hence required to overcome the high kinetic barriers associated to N  2  transformation.

      <title>Switching the Switch: Ligand Induced Disulfide Formation in HDAC8</title>
      <dc:description>
Regulated by a redox switch: PD&#8208;404,182 has been evaluated as an isoenzyme selective covalent inhibitor of HDAC8. HDAC8 belongs to the enzyme family of zinc&#8208;dependent histone deacetylases and is known to be regulated by a redox switch. The enzyme plays an important role in several cancer diseases and particularly childhood neuroblastoma. This study provides deep insight in how HDAC8 enzyme activity is regulated by disulfide bonds induced by PD&#8208;404,182.







Abstract
Human histone deacetylase 8 is a well&#8208;recognized target for T&#8208;cell lymphoma and particularly childhood neuroblastoma. PD&#8208;404,182 was shown to be a selective covalent inhibitor of HDAC8 that forms mixed disulfides with several cysteine residues and is also able to transform thiol groups to thiocyanates. Moreover, HDAC8 was shown to be regulated by a redox switch based on the reversible formation of a disulfide bond between cysteines Cys102 and Cys153. This study on the distinct effects of PD&#8208;404,182 on HDAC8 reveals that this compound induces the dose&#8208;dependent formation of intramolecular disulfide bridges. Therefore, the inhibition mechanism of HDAC8 by PD&#8208;404,182 involves both, covalent modification of thiols as well as ligand mediated disulfide formation. Moreover, this study provides a deep molecular insight into the regulation mechanism of HDAC8 involving several cysteines with graduated capability to form reversible disulfide bridges.

      <title>A Dendron&#8208;Based Fluorescence Turn&#8208;On Probe for Tumor Detection</title>
      <dc:description>
Reductive response: A dendron&#8208;based fluorescence turn&#8208;on probe mediated by the F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) mechanism is synthesized by conjugating one Cy5.5 molecule to the focal of a G3 dendron and eight Black Hole Quencher 3 (BHQ&#8208;3) molecules to its periphery through a reductively cleavable disulfide linkage. The fluorescence of the probe can be activated effectively and rapidly in the reductive environment of tumors.







Abstract
Specifically amplifying the emission signals of optical probes in tumors is an effective way to improve the tumor&#8208;imaging sensitivity and contrast. In this paper, the first case of dendron&#8208;based fluorescence turn&#8208;on probes mediated by a F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) mechanism is reported. Dendrons up to the fourth generation with a hydrophilic oligo(ethylene glycol) scaffold are synthesized by a solid&#8208;phase synthesis strategy, and show precise and defect&#8208;free chemical structures. To construct the fluorescence turn&#8208;on probe, one Cy5.5 molecule is conjugated to the focal of a G3 dendron through a robust linkage and eight Black Hole Quencher 3 (BHQ&#8208;3) molecules are conjugated to its periphery through a PEG chain bearing a reductively cleavable disulfide linkage. By in vitro and in vivo experiments, it is demonstrated that the fluorescence of the dendron&#8208;based probe can be activated effectively and rapidly in the reductive environments of tumor cells and tissues, and the probe thus exhibits amplified tumor signals and weak normal tissue signals. Compared with the reported nanoscale turn&#8208;on probes, the dendron&#8208;based probe has several significant advantages, such as well&#8208;defined chemical structure, precisely controllable fluorophore/quencher conjugation sites and ratio, desirable chemical stability, and reproducible pharmacokinetic and pharmacological profiles, and is very promising in tumor detection.

&lt;p&gt;Specifically amplifying the emission signals of optical probes in tumors is an effective way to improve the tumor&#8208;imaging sensitivity and contrast. In this paper, the first case of dendron&#8208;based fluorescence turn&#8208;on probes mediated by a F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) mechanism is reported. Dendrons up to the fourth generation with a hydrophilic oligo(ethylene glycol) scaffold are synthesized by a solid&#8208;phase synthesis strategy, and show precise and defect&#8208;free chemical structures. To construct the fluorescence turn&#8208;on probe, one Cy5.5 molecule is conjugated to the focal of a G3 dendron through a robust linkage and eight Black Hole Quencher 3 (BHQ&#8208;3) molecules are conjugated to its periphery through a PEG chain bearing a reductively cleavable disulfide linkage. By in vitro and in vivo experiments, it is demonstrated that the fluorescence of the dendron&#8208;based probe can be activated effectively and rapidly in the reductive environments of tumor cells and tissues, and the probe thus exhibits amplified tumor signals and weak normal tissue signals. Compared with the reported nanoscale turn&#8208;on probes, the dendron&#8208;based probe has several significant advantages, such as well&#8208;defined chemical structure, precisely controllable fluorophore/quencher conjugation sites and ratio, desirable chemical stability, and reproducible pharmacokinetic and pharmacological profiles, and is very promising in tumor detection.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Synthesis of Highly Enantioenriched Sulfonimidoyl Fluorides and Sulfonimidamides by Stereospecific Sulfur&#8211;Fluorine Exchange (SuFEx) Reaction
</title>
      <dc:description>
S&#8211;F exchange: Stereocontrolled synthesis provides highly enantioenriched sulfonimidoyl fluorides for SuFEx chemistry. Enantiospecific S&#8722;N bond formation is achieved with inversion by preventing fluoride promoted racemisation. A diverse array of sulfonimidamides is synthesised by using primary and secondary amines including complex amine&#8208;containing drugs.







Abstract
Sulfonimidamides present exciting opportunities as chiral isosteres of sulfonamides, with potential for additional directional interactions. Here, we present the first modular enantioselective synthesis of sulfonimidamides, including the first stereoselective synthesis of enantioenriched sulfonimidoyl fluorides, and studies on their reactivity. A new route to sulfonimidoyl fluorides is presented from solid bench&#8208;stable, N&#8208;Boc&#8208;sulfinamide (Boc=tert&#8208;butyloxycarbonyl) salt building blocks. Enantioenriched arylsulfonimidoyl fluorides are shown to be readily racemised by fluoride ions. Conditions are developed, which trap fluoride and enable the stereospecific reaction of sulfonimidoyl fluorides with primary and secondary amines (100&#8201;%&#8197;es, es=enantiospecificity) generating sulfonimidamides with up to 99&#8201;%&#8197;ee. Aryl and alkyl sulfonimidoyl fluoride reagents are suitable for mild late stage functionalisation reactions, exemplified by coupling with a selection of complex amines in marketed drugs.

      <dc:description>
It's radical: Reactions of Cp*SbX2 with LM (M=Ga, In) either selectively yielded Sb&#8208;centered radicals [L(X)Ga]2Sb. or Sb hydrides [L(X)In]2SbH. The unexpected formation of Sb hydrides is the result of different steric congestion from the [L(X)M] ligands as was proven by computational calculations.







Abstract
Oxidative addition of Cp*SbX2 (X=Cl, Br, I; Cp*=C5Me5) to group 13 diyls LM (M=Al, Ga, In; L=HC[C(Me)N (Dip)]2, Dip=2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3) yields elemental antimony (M=Al) or the corresponding stibanylgallanes [L(X)Ga]Sb(X)Cp* (X=Br 1, I 2) and &#8208;indanes [L(X)In]Sb(X)Cp* (X=Cl 5, Br 6, I 7). 1 and 2 react with a second equivalent of LGa to eliminate decamethyl&#8208;1,1&#8217;&#8208;dihydrofulvalene (Cp*2) and form stibanyl radicals [L(X)Ga]2Sb. (X=Br 3, I 4), whereas analogous reactions of 5 and 6 with LIn selectively yield stibanes [L(X)In]2SbH (X=Cl 8, Br 9) by elimination of 1,2,3,4&#8208;tetramethylfulvene. The reactions are proposed to proceed via formation of [L(X)M]2SbCp* as reaction intermediate, which is supported by the isolation of [L(Cl)Ga]2SbCp (11, Cp=C5H5). The reaction mechanism was further studied by computational calculations using two different models. The energy values for the Ga&#8208; and the In&#8208;substituted model systems showing methyl groups instead of the very bulky Dip units are very similar, and in both cases the same products are expected. Homolytic Sb&#8722;C bond cleavage yields van der Waals complexes from the as&#8208;formed radicals ([L(Cl)M]2Sb. and Cp*.), which can be stabilized by hydrogen atom abstraction to give the corresponding hydrides, whereas the direct formation of Sb hydrides starting from [L(Cl)M]2SbCp* via concerted &#946;&#8208;H elimination is unlikely. The consideration of the bulky Dip units reveals that the amount of the steric overload in the intermediate I determines the product formation (radical vs. hydride).

      <title>Ba3(BO3)(CO3)F: The First Borate Carbonate Fluoride Synthesized by the High&#8208;temperature Solution Method</title>
      <dc:description>In contrast to the well&#8208;investigated halogen&#8208;containing borates and carbonates, very few halogen&#8208;containing borate carbonate compounds have been reported. Specifically, no example of borate carbonate fluoride has been synthesized successfully until now. Herein, the planar &#960;&#8208;conjugated units [BO  3  ]  3&#8722;  and [CO  3  ]  2&#8722;  and the F  &#8210;  ions are introduced simultaneously into one crystal structure resulting in a first borate carbonate fluoride, Ba  3  (BO  3  )(CO  3  )F, by the high&#8208;temperature solution method in the atmosphere. Its structure features a hexagonal channel formed by the [BO  3  ]  3&#8722;  and [CO  3  ]  2&#8722;  units with the [F  3  Ba  8  ]  13+  trimers filled in the channel. Various characterizations including single crystal&#8208; and powder&#8208;XRD, EDX, IR, UV&#8208;vis&#8208;NIR, and TG&#8208;DSC, together with the first principles calculation have been carried out to verify the structure and understand the structure&#8208;properties relationship deeply.</dc:description>

      <title>Synchronous electrocatalytic design of architectural and electronic structure based on bifunctional LDH&#8208;Co3O4/NF towards water splitting</title>
      <dc:description>Rational design of highly efficient bifunctional electrocatalysts for water splitting is extremely urgent for sustainable energy conversion process to alleviate energy crisis and environment pollution. In this work, by simply depositing layered double hydroxides (LDH) on Co  3  O  4  /NF (NF = Nickel foam) nanosheets arrays, the hierarchical Co  3+  &#8208;riched materials based on LDH&#8208;Co  3  O  4  /NF were designed as highly active and stable electrocatalysts for water splitting. The NiFe&#8208;LDH&#8208;Co  3  O  4  /NF demonstrated excellent electrochemical activity with an overpotential of 214 mV for OER and an overpotential of 162 mV for HER at 10 mA cm  &#8208;2  . Such performance was due to the optimized electronic states with high concentration of Co  3+  which improved the intrinsic activity and the sheet&#8208;on&#8208;sheet hierarchical structure which increased the number of active sites. The unique synchronous design of both architectural and electronic structure of nanomaterials could accelerate the reaction kinetics and provide a more convenient charge transfer path simultaneously. Therefore, the strategy reported herein may open a new pathway for the design of excellent electrocatalysts for water splitting.</dc:description>

      <title>Cucurbit[n]urils for supramolecular catalysis</title>
      <dc:description>The control over chemical reactivity and selectivity are always pursued. Using non&#8208;covalent interactions to achieve efficient and selective catalysis is an essential goal of supramolecular catalysis. Supramolecular catalysis based on cucurbit[n]urils (CB[n]s) possesses distinct characteristics for the unique structure of CB[n]s. CB[n]s are a family of pumpkin&#8208;shaped host molecules with various molecular sizes, rigid structures, electronegative portals and wealthy host&#8208;guest chemistry. Herein, we summarize the three major mechanisms of CB[n]s based supramolecular catalysis. Owing to the structural properties of CB[n]s, CB[n]s can serve as nanoreactors and steric hindrance to modulate the reactivity of substrates. They can also catalyze the reactions by modulating the reactivity of ionized intermediates. Recent progresses on the CB[n]s based supramolecular catalysis are introduced in this mini&#8208;review and the future development in this field is discussed. It is anticipated that this review provides insights into the mechanism of CB[n]s based supramolecular catalysis and may help scientists find new opportunities in this field.</dc:description>

      <title>Pitch&#8208;based laminated carbon formed by pressure driving in low temperature as high&#8208;capacity anodes for lithium energy storage system</title>
      <dc:description>Pitch has been used to prepare electrodes by high&#8208;temperature heat&#8208;treatment for supercapacitors, lithium ion batteries, on account of its rich aromatic ring structure. Here, toluene soluble component of pitch is used to prepare a kind of laminated carbon. It was realized by a template&#8208;free synthesis in the low temperature with the addition of pressure. Toluene soluble component has a small molecular weight, it makes the thermal deformation ability stronger and then enhances the orientation of carbon layer with the help of pressure. The prepared anode exhibits a splendid electrochemical performance compared to the traditional graphite anode. A high stable capacity of ca. 550 mAh g  &#8208;1  at 50 mA g  &#8208;1  which is higher much than graphite (372 mAh g  &#8208;1  ) is obtained. And when the current density is up to 2 A g  &#8208;1  , the capacity is about 150 mAh g  &#8208;1  . Surprisingly, it also delivers a superior cycling performance. And when used as anode/cathode electrode for lithium ion capacitor, a high energy density can be obtained. The present work offers an opportunity to utilize the pitch source in lithium energy storage with promising cycle life, high energy/power density and low cost.</dc:description>

      <title>Tuning Photoelectrochemical Performance of RuII&#8208;Sensitized Two&#8208;Dimensional MoS2</title>
      <dc:description>Covalently tethering photosensitizers to catalytically active 1T&#8208;MoS  2  surfaces holds great promise for the solar&#8208;driven hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Herein we report the preparation of two new Ru  II  complex functionalized MoS  2  hybrids [Ru  II  (bpy)  2  (phen)]&#8208;MoS  2  and [Ru  II  (bpy)  2  (py)Cl]&#8208;MoS  2  . The influence of covalent functionalization of chemically exfoliated 1T&#8208;MoS  2  with coordinating ligands and Ru  II  complexes on the HER activity and photoelectrochemical performance of this dye&#8208;sensitized system was studied systematically. We find that the photoelectrochemical performance of this Ru  II  complex sensitized MoS  2  system is highly dependent on the surface extent of photosensitizers and the catalytic activity of functionalized MoS  2  . The latter was strongly affected by the number and the kind of functional groups.

      <title>Unusual Nitrene Oxidation Product Formation by Metathesis Involving the Dioxygen O&#8722;O and Borylnitrene B&#8722;N Bonds</title>
      <dc:description>
Overcoming barriers: The reaction of dioxygen with nitrenes can have significant energy barriers. The reaction mechanism of borylnitrene 1 is investigated through matrix&#8208;isolation infrared spectroscopy and high&#8208;level computational quantum chemistry. Borylnitrene 1 reacts with dioxygen to form nitritoborane 3&#8201;a via nitroso&#8208;O&#8208;oxide isomer 2&#8201;c. Nitroso&#8208;O&#8208;oxide isomer 2&#8201;a is stable towards thermal reaction to 3&#8201;a, but dyotropic rearrangement can be achieved photochemically.







Abstract
The reaction of dioxygen with nitrenes can have significant energy barriers, although both reactants are triplet diradicals and the formation of nitroso&#8208;O&#8208;oxides is spin&#8208;allowed. By means of matrix&#8208;isolation infrared spectroscopy in solid argon, nitrogen, and neon, and through high&#8208;level computational quantum chemistry, it is shown herein that a 3&#8208;nitreno&#8208;1,3,2&#8208;benzodioxaborole CatBN (Cat=catecholato) reacts with dioxygen under cryogenic conditions thermally at temperatures as low as 7&#8197;K to produce two distinct products, an anti&#8208;nitroso&#8208;O&#8208;oxide and a nitritoborane CatBONO. The computed barriers for the formation of nitroso&#8208;O&#8208;oxide isomers are very low. Whereas anti&#8208;nitroso&#8208;O&#8208;oxide is kinetically trapped, its bisected isomer has a very low barrier for metathesis, yielding the CatBO+NO radicals in a strongly exothermic reaction; these radicals can combine under matrix&#8208;isolation conditions to give nitritoborane CatBONO. The trapped isomer, anti&#8208;nitroso&#8208;O&#8208;oxide, can form the nitritoborane CatBONO only after photoexcitation, possibly involving isomerization to the bisected isomer of anti&#8208;nitroso&#8208;O&#8208;oxide.

      <title>The role of fluorine in glycomimetic drug design</title>
      <dc:description>Glycans are well&#8208;established to play important roles at various stages of infection and disease, and ways to modulate these interactions have been sought as novel therapies. The use of native glycan structures has been met with limited success, which can be attributed to their characteristic high polarity (e.g. low binding affinities) and inherently poor pharmacokinetic properties (e.g. short drug&#8208;target residence times, rapid renal excretion), leading to the development of &#8216;glycomimetics.&#8217; Fluorinated drugs have become increasingly common over recent decades, with fluorinated glycomimetics offering some unique advantages. Deoxyfluorination maintains certain electrostatic interactions, while concomitantly reducing net polarity through &#8216;polar hydrophobicity&#8217;, improving drug residence times and binding affinities. Fluorination destabilizes the oxocarbenium transition state associated with metabolic degradation, and can restore  exo  &#8208; and  endo  &#8208;anomeric effects in C&#8208;glycosides and carbasugars. Lastly, it has shown great utility in radiotracer development and enhancement of antigenicity in glycan&#8208;based vaccines. Owing to synthetic challenges, fluorinated glycomimetics have been somewhat underutilized to date, but methodological improvements will advance their use in glycomimetic drugs.</dc:description>

      <title>High&#8208;Resolution Electronic Excitation and Emission Spectra of Pentacene and 6,13&#8208;Diazapentacene Monomers and Weakly Bound Dimers by Matrix&#8208;Isolation Spectroscopy</title>
      <dc:description>N&#8208;Heteropolycycles are among the most promising candidates for applications in organic devices. For this purpose, a profound understanding of the low&#8208;energy electronic absorbance and emission characteristics is of crucial importance. Herein, we report high&#8208;resolution absorbance and fluorescence spectra of pentacene (  PEN  ) and 6,13&#8208;diazapentacene (  DAP  ) in solid neon obtained using the matrix&#8208;isolation technique.

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;N&#8208;Heteropolycycles are among the most promising candidates for applications in organic devices. For this purpose, a profound understanding of the low&#8208;energy electronic absorbance and emission characteristics is of crucial importance. Herein, we report high&#8208;resolution absorbance and fluorescence spectra of pentacene (  PEN  ) and 6,13&#8208;diazapentacene (  DAP  ) in solid neon obtained using the matrix&#8208;isolation technique. Accompanying DFT calculations allow the assignment of specific vibrationally&#8208;resolved signals to corresponding modes. Furthermore, we present for the first time evidence for the formation of van der Waals dimers of both substances. These dimers exhibit significantly different optical characteristics resulting from the change of electronic properties evoked by the incorporation of sp  2  nitrogen into the molecular backbone.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Redox&#8208;Mediated Alcohol Oxidation Coupled to Hydrogen Gas Formation in a Dye&#8208;Sensitized Photosynthesis Cell</title>
      <dc:description>We report a dye&#8208;sensitized photoelectrochemical cell (DSPEC) that couples redox&#8208;mediated light&#8208;driven oxidative organic transformations to reductive hydrogen (H2) formation. The DSPEC photoanode consists of a mesoporous anatase TiO2 film on FTO (fluorine&#8208;doped tin oxide), sensitized with the thienopyrroledione&#8208;based dye AP11, while H2 was formed at a FTO&#8211;Pt cathode. Irradiation of the dye&#8208;sensitized photoanode transforms 2,2,6,6&#8208;tetramethylpiperidine 1&#8208;oxyl (TEMPO) to the oxidized TEMPO (TEMPO+), which acts as a chemical oxidant for the conversion of benzyl alcohol. The TEMPO0/+ couple, previously used as redox mediator in DSSC, mediates efficient electron transfer from the organic substrate to the photo&#8208;oxidized dye. A DSPEC photoreactor was designed that allows in situ monitoring the reaction progress by infrared spectroscopy and gas chromatography. Sustained light&#8208;driven oxidation of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde within the DSPEC photoreactor, using of TEMPO as mediator, demonstrated the efficiency of the device, with a photocurrent of 0.4 mA cm&#8208;2, approaching quantitative Faradaic efficiency and exhibiting excellent device stability.</dc:description>

      <title>High Efficiency FRET Processes in BODIPY Functionalized Quantum Dot Architectures</title>
      <dc:description>Efficient FRET systems are developed combining colloidal CdSe quantum dots (QDs) donors and BODIPY acceptors. To promote effective energy transfer in FRET architectures, the distance between the organic fluorophore and the QDs needs to be optimized by a careful system engineering. In this context, BODIPY dyes bearing amino&#8208;terminated functionalities are used in virtue of the high affinity of amine groups in coordinating the QD surface. A preliminary QD surface treatment with a short amine ligand is performed to favour the interaction with the organic fluorophores in solution. The successful coordination of the dye to the QD surface, accomplishing a short donor&#8208;acceptor distance, provides effective energy transfer already in solution, with efficiency of 76%. The efficiency further increases in solid state where the QDs and the dye are deposited as single coordinated units from solution, with a distance between the fluorophores down to 2.2 nm, demonstrating the effectiveness of the coupling strategy.</dc:description>

      <title>Merging Natural Products: Muraymycin&#8208;Sansanmycin Hybrid Structures as Novel Scaffold for Potential Antibacterial Agents</title>
      <dc:description>In order to overcome bacterial resistances, the need for novel antimicrobial agents is urgent. The class of so&#8208;called nucleoside antibiotics furnishes promising candidates for the development of new antibiotics, as these compounds block a clinically unexploited bacterial target: the integral membrane protein MraY, a key enzyme in cell wall (peptidoglycan) biosynthesis. Nucleoside antibiotics exhibit remarkable structural diversity beside their uridine&#8208;derived core motifs. Some sub&#8208;classes also show specfic selectivities towards different Gram&#8208;positive and Gram&#8208;negative bacteria, which are poorly understood so far. Herein, we report the synthesis of a novel hybrid structure, derived from the 5'&#8208;defunctionalised uridine core moiety of muraymycins and the peptide chain of sansanmycin B, as a new scaffold for the development of antimicrobial agents. The reported muraymycin&#8208;sansanmycin hybrid scaffold showed nanomolar activity against the bacterial target enzyme MraY, but displayed no significant antibacterial activity against S. aureus, E. coli and P. aeruginosa.</dc:description>

      <title>Structure&#8208;Property Relationships in Bithiophenes with Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Substituents</title>
      <dc:description>The use of crystal engineering to control the supramolecular arrangement of &#960;&#8208;conjugated molecules in the solid&#8208;state is of considerable interest for the development of novel organic electronic materials. In the present study, we investigated the effect of combining of two types of supramolecular interactions with different geometric requirements, amide hydrogen bonding and &#960;&#8208;interactions, on the &#960;&#8208;overlap between calamitic &#960;&#8208;conjugated cores. To this end, we prepared two series of bithiophene diesters and diamides with methylene, ethylene, or propylene spacers between the bithiophene core and the functional groups in their terminal substituents. The hydrogen&#8208;bonded bithiophene diamides showed significantly denser packing of the bithiophene cores than the diesters and other known &#945;,&#969;&#8208;disubstituted bithiophenes. The bithiophene packing density reach a maximum in the bithiophene diamide with an ethylene spacer, which featured the smallest longitudinal bithiophene displacement and infinite 1D arrays of electronically conjugated, parallel, and almost linear N&#8211;H&#183;&#183;&#183;O=C hydrogen bonds. The synergistic hydrogen bonding and &#960;&#8208;interactions were attributed to the favorable conformational mechanics of the ethylene spacer and resulted in H&#8208;type spectroscopic aggregates in solid&#8208;state absorption spectroscopy. These results demonstrate that the optoelectronic properties of &#960;&#8208;conjugated materials in the solid&#8208;state may be tailored systematically via side chain engineering, and hence that this approach has significant potential for the design of organic and polymer semiconductors.</dc:description>

      <title>New promises and opportunities in 3D printable inks based on coordination compounds for the creation of objects with multiple applications</title>
      <dc:description>This review focuses on the usefulness of coordination bonds to create 3D printable inks and shows how the union of chemistry and 3D technology contributes to new scientific advances, by allowing amorphous or polycrystalline solids to be transformed into objects with the desired shape for successful applications. The review clearly shows how there has been a considerable increase in the manufacture of objects based on the combination of organic matrices and coordination compounds. These coordination compounds are usually homogeneously dispersed within the matrix, anchored onto proper support, or coating the printed object, without destroying their unique properties. Advances are so fast that today it has already been possible to 3D print objects made exclusively from coordination compounds without additives. The new printable inks are made mainly with nano&#8208; non&#8208;porous coordination polymers, metal&#8208;organic gels, or metal&#8208;organic frameworks. The highly dynamic coordination bond allows the creation of objects with responses to stimuli that can act as sensors and drug delivery. In addition, the join of metal&#8208;organic frameworks with 3D print allows increasing the adsorption or selective capacity of the object concerning the original compound, being useful in energy storage, in gas separation, or water pollutant elimination. Furthermore, the metal ion's presence can give them new properties such as luminescence finding usefulness in sensors, or anti&#8208;counterfeiting. Technological advances, the combination of various printing techniques, the properties of the coordination bonds, anything goes to create surprising new printable inks and objects with highly complex shapes, that will shorten the gap between the academy and the industry of the coordination compounds.</dc:description>

The new printable inks are made mainly with nano&#8208; non&#8208;porous coordination polymers, metal&#8208;organic gels, or metal&#8208;organic frameworks. The highly dynamic coordination bond allows the creation of objects with responses to stimuli that can act as sensors and drug delivery. In addition, the join of metal&#8208;organic frameworks with 3D print allows increasing the adsorption or selective capacity of the object concerning the original compound, being useful in energy storage, in gas separation, or water pollutant elimination. Furthermore, the metal ion's presence can give them new properties such as luminescence finding usefulness in sensors, or anti&#8208;counterfeiting. Technological advances, the combination of various printing techniques, the properties of the coordination bonds, anything goes to create surprising new printable inks and objects with highly complex shapes, that will shorten the gap between the academy and the industry of the coordination compounds.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Clar Goblet and Aromaticity Driven Multiradical Nanographenes</title>
      <dc:description>The Clar Goblet, the first radical bowtie nanographene proposed by Erich Clar nearly 50 years ago, was recently synthesized. Bowtie nanographenes present quasi&#8208;degenerate magnetic ground states which make them so elusive as unique. We present a thorough analysis of the spin states energetics of Clar Goblet and bowtie nanographenes by a battery of existing and novel ab initio procedures ranging from density functional theory to complete active space Hamiltonians. With this, we prove that &#960; radicals of bowtie nanographenes sit on BP (Benzo[cd]Pyrene) moieties driven by their local aromaticity, a purely chemical concept, which confers global stability to the whole structure. Besides, we present a novel Pauli energy densities analysis providing a visual intuitive explanation for this preference. These findings allow envisioning that analogous bowtie nanographenes with arbitrary polyradical character are not only feasible at the molecular scale but that will share Clar Goblet&#8217;s peculiar properties.</dc:description>

      <title>Stepwise physisorption of alkoxy&#8208;pyrene derivatives onto a lamellar, non&#8208;porous naphthalenediimide&#8208;template on HOPG</title>
      <dc:description>The development of new strategies for the preparation of multicomponent supramolecular assemblies is a major challenge on the road to complex functional molecular systems. Here we present the use of a non&#8208;porous self&#8208;assembled monolayer from uC33&#8208;NDI&#8208;uC33, a naphthalenediimide symmetrically functionalized with unsaturated 33 carbon&#8208;atom&#8208;chains, to prepare bicomponent supramolecular surface systems with a series of alkoxy&#8208;pyrene (PyrOR) derivatives at the liquid/HOPG interface. While previous attempts at directly depositing many of these PyrOR units at the liquid/HOPG interface failed, the multicomponent approach through the uC33&#8208;NDI&#8208;uC33 template enabled control over molecular interactions and facilitated physisorption. The PyrOR deposition restructured the initial uC33&#8208;NDI&#8208;uC33 monolayer, causing an expansion in two dimensions to accommodate the guests. As far as we know, this represent the first example of a non&#8208;porous or non&#8208;metal complex&#8208;bearing monolayer that allows the stepwise formation of multicomponent supramolecular architectures on surfaces.</dc:description>

      <title>Breslow Intermediates (Aminoenols) and their Keto Tautomers: First Gas&#8208;Phase Characterization by IR Ion Spectroscopy</title>
      <dc:description>Breslow intermediates (BIs) are the crucial nucleophilic amino enol intermediates formed from electrophilic aldehydes in the course of N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) catalyzed Umpolung reactions. Both in organocatalytic and enzymatic Umpolung, the question whether the Breslow intermediate exists as the nucleophilic enol, or in the form of its electrophilic keto&#8208;tautomer, is of utmost importance for its reactivity and function. We herein report the preparation of charge&#8208;tagged Breslow intermediates/keto tautomers derived from three different types of NHCs (imidazolidin&#8208;2&#8208;ylidenes, 1,2,4&#8208;triazolin&#8208;5&#8208;ylidenes, thiazolin&#8208;2&#8208;ylidenes) and aldehydes. An ammonium charge&#8208;tag is introduced by either the aldehyde unit or the NHC. ESI&#8208;MS IR&#8208;Ion spectroscopy allowed for the unambiguous conclusion that in the gas&#8208;phase, the imidazolidin&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene derived BI indeed exists as a diamino enol, while both 1,2,4&#8208;triazolin&#8208;5&#8208;ylidenes and thiazolin&#8208;2&#8208;ylidenes give the keto&#8208;tautomer. This result coincides with the tautomeric states observed for the BIs in solution (NMR) and in the crystalline state (XRD), and is in line with our earlier calculations on the energetics of BI keto&#8208;enol equilibria.</dc:description>

      <title>Tuning Optical Properties by Controlled Aggregation: Electroluminescence Assisted by Thermally&#8208;Activated Delayed Fluorescence from Thin Films of Crystalline Chromophores</title>
      <dc:description>Several photophysical properties of chromophores depend crucially on intermolecular interactions. Thermally&#8208;activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) is often influenced by close packing of the chromophore assembly. In this context, the metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) approach has several advantages: it can be used to steer aggregation such that the orientation within aggregated structures can be predicted using rational approaches. We demonstrate this design concept for a DPA&#8208;TPE (diphenylamine&#8208;tetraphenylethylene) chromophore, which is non&#8208;emissive in its solvated state due to vibrational quenching. Turning this DPA&#8208;TPE into a ditopic linker allows to grow oriented MOF thin films exhibiting pronounced green electroluminescence with low onset voltages. Measurements at different temperatures clearly demonstrate the presence of TADF.

      <dc:description>Wavelength&#8208;selective photo&#8208;regulation by multiple chromophores responding to different wavelength can expand the variation of photo&#8208;manipulating system. Herein, we report orthogonal photo&#8208;regulation of duplex formation between serinol nucleic acid (SNA) and RNA using light&#8208;induced crosslinking reactions mediated by a new photo&#8208;reactive nucleobase 8&#8208;naphthylvinyladenine (  NV  A) and previously described 8&#8208;pyrenylvinyladenine (  PV  A). An intrastrand crosslink was induced in an SNA strand containing two adjacent&#160;  NV  A residues by irradiation with 340&#8208;405 nm light; the crosslink was reversed by irradiation with &#8804; 300 nm light. In an SNA strand with adjacent&#160;  NV  A and&#160;  PV  A residues, an intrastrand crosslink resulted from irradiation with 405&#8208;465 nm light that was reversed by irradiation with &#8804; 340 nm light. Intrastrand photo&#8208;crosslinking caused severe destabilization of an SNA/RNA duplex, resulting in dissociation to single strands. Cycloreversion resulted in duplex formation. With these&#160;  NV  A/  NV  A and&#160;  NV  A/  PV  A photo&#8208;switches, four hybridization states of two SNA/RNA duplexes could be orthogonally photo&#8208;controlled by irradiation with a suitable wavelength of light.</dc:description>
