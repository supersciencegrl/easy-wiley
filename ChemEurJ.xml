         <title>MoSe2&#8208;Sensitized Water Splitting Assisted by C60&#8208;Dendrons on the Basal Surface</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We propose a new class of H2 evolution photocatalyst&#160;containing TMD not as a co&#8208;catalyst, but as a photosensitizer: MoSe2/C60&#8208;dendron nanohybrids, assisted by 1&#8208;benzyl&#8208;1,4&#8208;dihydronicotinamide (BNAH) as a sacrificial donor and Pt nanoparticles as co&#8208;catalysts. The 2D/0D mixed&#8208;dimensional heterojunction formed by MoSe2 and C60 is highly effective in generating mobile carriers under visible and NIR light irradiation. &#160;This process involves electron extraction from the exciton in MoSe2 to C60, followed by electron transfer to Pt nanoparticles via MV2+, leading to H2 production from water. &#160;Even NIR light, such as 800 nm light corresponding to the A&#8208;exciton absorption of MoSe2, can facilitate water splitting. &#160;The EQY of the H2 evolution reaction was estimated to be 0.0027%.</dc:description>

         <title>Two&#8208;positron&#8208;bonded dihalides: Ps2XY (X,Y=F,Cl,Br)</title>

We combine electronic coupled cluster (CCSD(T)) calculations with positronic multicomponent renormalized partial&#160;third&#8208;order propagator (MC&#8208;REN&#8208;PP3) calculations to effectively recover correlation energies. Analysis of potential energy curves confirms the energetic stability of these positronic&#160;molecules, with optimized structures identified as global minima. Further investigation of electron and positron densities&#160;reveals stabilization owing to the formation of two&#8208;positron bonds. The global stability of the Ps2XY complexes contrasts&#160;with the metastable two&#8208;positron&#8208;bonded (PsH)2, which energetically favors the emission of Ps2. Comparative analysis of one&#8208; and two&#8208;positron dihalides indicates that adding&#160;a positron to PsXY&#8211; generally results in shorter bond distances, higher force constants, and lower dissociation energies, with exceptions due to differences in positron affinities of&#160;PsXY&#8211; and Y&#8211;. We explore the analogy between two&#8208;positron&#8208;bonded dihalide systems Ps2XY and two&#8208;electron&#8208;bonded dialkali molecules AB, (A,B=Na,K,Rb). The bonding properties in positron dihalides and their electronic dialkali analogs display&#160;identical periodic trends. However,&#160;compared to their isoelectronic AB counterparts, the positron bonds in Ps2XY&#160;have shorter bond lengths, higher force constants, and higher bond energies.</dc:description>

         <title>Spectroscopic Properties and Reactivity of a MnIII&#8208;hydroperoxo Complex that is Stable at Room Temperature</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Manganese catalysts that activate hydrogen peroxide have seen increased use in organic transformations, such as olefin epoxidation and alkane C&#8722;H bond oxidation. Proposed mechanisms for these catalysts involve the formation and activation of MnIII&#8208;hydroperoxo intermediates. Examples of well&#8208;defined MnIII&#8208;hydroperoxo complexes are rare, and the properties of these species are often inferred from MnIIIalkylperoxo analogues. In this study, we show that the reaction of the MnIII&#8208;hydroxo complex [MnIII(OH)(6Medpaq)]+ (1) with hydrogen peroxide and acid results in the formation of a dark&#8208;green MnIII&#8208;hydroperoxo species [MnIII(OOH)(6Medpaq)]+ (2). The formulation of 2 is based on electronic absorption, 1H NMR, IR, and ESI&#8208;MS data. The thermal decay of 2 follows a first order process, and variable&#8208;temperature kinetic studies of the decay of 2 yielded activation parameters that could be compared with those of a MnIII&#8208;alkylperoxo analogue. Complex 2 reacts with the hydrogen&#8208;atom donor TEMPOH two&#8208;fold faster than the MnIII&#8208;hydroxo complex 1. Complex 2 also oxidizes PPh3, and this MnIII&#8208;hydroperoxo species is 600&#8208;fold more reactive with this substrate than its MnIII&#8208;alkylperoxo analogue [MnIII(OOtBu)(6Medpaq)]+. DFT and time&#8208;dependent (TD) DFT computations are used to compare the electronic structure of 2 with similar MnIII&#8208;hydroperoxo and MnIII&#8208;alkylperoxo complexes.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis and Spectroscopic Study of a Homogenous Bimetallic Os(II) Complex as a New Gastric Cancer Photosensitizer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A homogenous dinuclear Os(II) complex bisOs was synthesized and fully characterized. The electrochemical cyclic voltammetry study, and density functional theory (DFT) and time&#8208;dependent DFT (TD&#8208;DFT) calculations were performed to investigate the electronic property. bisOs showed an obvious interaction with lipase and BSA, and can generate singlet oxygen under blue and red LED light irradiation, with a singlet oxygen quantum yield (&#1060;&#916;) of 0.36 in comparison to that of [Ru(bpy)3]Cl2 in acetonitrile. bisOs exhibited moderate to great photocytotoxicity against HGC&#8208;27 human gastric cancer cells under blue LED light irradiation, giving the IC50 value as low as 1.83 &#181;M (PI value is 9.7), while was almost non&#8208;cytotoxic in the dark. The cellular singlet oxygen detection in HGC&#8208;27 cancer cells exhibited a concentration&#8208;dependent manner, and cell uptake of bisOs in A549 cells was as high as 120 ng/106 cells, subcellular colocalization study indicated that bisOs was not accumulated in nucleus, and less likely to target mitochondria. This work provides a new example of dinuclear osmium complex as potential photosensitizer candidate for gastric treatment.</dc:description>

         <title>A Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Responsive Fluorescent Diarylethene Having a Betaine Structure</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>As a new molecular scaffold of photoswitchable fluorophore, we developed a photochromic diarylethene containing a betaine structure based on pyridinium N&#8208;enolate. A facile reaction of a pyridyl&#8208;substituted dithienylperfluorocyclopentene derivative with octafluorocyclopentene constructed the betaine structure. The introduction of the betaine moiety provided the diarylethene molecule with bathochromically shifted optical absorption and fluorescing ability, thus enabling the molecule to function as a visible&#8208;light&#8208;sensitive turn&#8208;off mode photoswitchable fluorophore. The molecule in the open&#8208;ring form emitted bright blueish green fluorescence. Upon irradiation with 405 nm light, the molecule underwent cyclization isomerization to form the closed&#8208;ring isomer and the fluorescence intensity significantly decreased. The turn&#8208;off mode fluorescence photoswitching was observed not only in solution but also in polymer films.</dc:description>

The introduction of the betaine moiety provided the diarylethene molecule with bathochromically shifted optical absorption and fluorescing ability, thus enabling the molecule to function as a visible-light-sensitive turn-off mode photoswitchable fluorophore. The molecule in the open-ring form emitted bright blueish green fluorescence. Upon irradiation with 405 nm light, the molecule underwent cyclization isomerization to form the closed-ring isomer and the fluorescence intensity significantly decreased. The turn-off mode fluorescence photoswitching was observed not only in solution but also in polymer films.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Impact of Weak Organic Acids as Coagulants on Tailoring the Properties of Cellulose Aerogel Beads</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 51, September 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We demonstrate that the physical and microstructural properties of cellulose aerogel beads can be tailored by using weak organic acids such as acetic acid (HAc), lactic acid (HLac) or citric acid (HCit) as coagulants. In comparison to strong hydrochloric acid (HCl), organic acids in the regeneration bath produced densely packed nanofibrillar network and large volume of mesoporous structure.







Abstract
Tailoring the properties of cellulose aerogel beads was investigated in the present study by using weak organic acids as coagulants. Three different weak acids were specifically chosen, acetic acid, lactic acid and citric acid. For comparative studies, a strong acid, hydrochloric acid was examined. The production of aerogel beads by conventional dropping technique was controlled and optimized for weak acids. Aerogels were characterized by density analyses, scanning electron microscopy, nitrogen adsorption&#8211;desorption analysis, X&#8208;ray powder diffractometry and IR spectroscopy. In common, all the aerogel beads showed interconnected nanofibrillar network, high specific surface area, high pore volume, high porosity and meso&#8208; and macroporous structure. In particular, when the weakest acid (acetic acid) was used as coagulant in the regeneration bath, the lowest shrinkage was observed. As a result, the cellulose aerogel beads produced from acetic acid showed the highest values of specific surface area (423&#8197;m2&#8201;g&#8722;1) and pore volume (3.6&#8197;cm3&#8201;g&#8722;1). The porous structure can be tuned by the choice of regeneration bath, which has either strong acid or a high concentration of weak acid. The aerogel beads were pure and showed cellulose II crystallinity. Hence this study paves an alternative path way to tailor the properties of cellulose aerogel beads.

         <title>The Hybridization of Polymers with Metal Oxide Clusters for the Design of Non&#8208;Fluorinated Proton Exchange Membranes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 51, September 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cost&#8208;effective composite non&#8208;fluorinated proton exchange membranes (PEMs) with excellent overall performance are essential to realize the economical and efficient fabrication of fuel cells. Herein, we briefly discuss on design strategy, research progress, and application prospects of PEMs based on the polymer composites of nanoscale metal oxide clusters.







Abstract
As the key component of various energy storage and conversion devices, proton exchange membranes (PEMs) have been attracting significant interest. However, their further development is limited by the high cost of perfluorosulfonic acid polymers and the poor stability of acid&#8208;dopped non&#8208;fluorinated polymers. Recently, a new group of PEMs has been developed by hybridizing polyoxometalates (POMs), a group of super acidic sub&#8208;nanoscale metal oxide clusters, with polymers. POMs can serve simultaneously as both proton sponges and stabilizing agents, and their complexation with polymers can further improve polymers&#8217; mechanical performance and processability. Enormous efforts have been focused on studying supramolecular complexation or covalent grafting of POMs with various polymers to optimize PEMs in terms of cost, mechanical properties and stabilities. This concept summarizes recent advances in this emerging field and outlines the design strategies and application perspectives employed for using POM&#8208;polymer hybrid materials as PEMs.

         <title>Anions as Lewis Acids in Noncovalent Bonds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 51, September 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The &#963; or &#960;&#8208;hole within a Lewis acid usually signals a positive electrostatic potential that can attract the negative region of an approaching nucleophile. Because of their overall negative charge, any such hole on an anion will typically indicate a negative potential. Nonetheless, it is shown here that a wide range of anions are able to act as Lewis acid in a noncovalent bond, despite a negatively charged &#963; or &#960;&#8208;hole. These bonds are constituted in large part by an attractive electrostatic interaction, even though negative regions of the two subunits face one another.







Abstract
The ability of an anion to serve as electron&#8208;accepting Lewis acid in a noncovalent bond is assessed via DFT calculations. NH3 is taken as the common base, and is paired with a host of ACln&#8722; anions, with central atom A=Ca, Sr, Mg, Te, Sb, Hg, Zn, Ag, Ga, Ti, Sn, I, and B. Each anion reacts through its &#963; or &#960;&#8208;hole although the electrostatic potential of this hole is quite negative in most cases. Despite the contact between this negative hole and the negative region of the approaching nucleophile, the electrostatic component of the interaction energy of each bond is highly favorable, and accounts for more than half of the total attractive energy. The double negative charge of dianions precludes a stable complex with NH3.

         <title>Real&#8208;Time Metabolic Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy of Pancreatic and Colon Cancer Tumor&#8208;Xenografts with Parahydrogen Hyperpolarized 1&#8208;13C Pyruvate&#8208;d3</title>

1&#8208;13C&#8208;pyruvate&#8208;d3 hyperpolarized via parahydrogen can be used to study altered metabolism with MRI in pancreatic as well as colon cancer human tumor&#8208;xenografts.







Abstract
Parahydrogen&#8208;induced polarization (PHIP) is an emerging technique to enhance the signal of stable isotope metabolic contrast agents for Magnetic Resonance (MR). The objective of this study is to continue establishing 1&#8208;13C&#8208;pyruvate&#8208;d3, signal&#8208;enhanced via PHIP, as a hyperpolarized contrast agent, obtained in seconds, to monitor metabolism in human cancer. Our focus was on human pancreatic and colon tumor xenografts. 1&#8208;13C&#8208;vinylpyruvate&#8208;d6 was hydrogenated using parahydrogen. Thereafter, the polarization of the protons was transferred to 13C. Following a workup procedure, the free hyperpolarized 1&#8208;13C&#8208;pyruvate&#8208;d3 was obtained in clean aqueous solution. After injection into animals bearing either pancreatic or colon cancer xenografts, slice&#8208;selective MR spectra were acquired and analyzed to determine rate constants of metabolic conversion into lactate and alanine. 1&#8208;13C&#8208;pyruvate&#8208;d3 proved to follow the increased metabolic rate to lactate and alanine in the tumor xenografts.

         <title>&#8220;The Sulfur Dance&#8221; Around Arenes and Heteroarenes &#8208; the Reversible Nature of Nucleophilic Aromatic Substitutions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 51, September 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The features of a category of reversible nucleophilic aromatic substitution reactions in view of their significance and wide scope in aromatic and heteroaromatic chemistry are presented. Exchange of sulfur components surrounding arenes and heteroarenes may occur at 25&#8201;&#176;C, in a process that one may call a &#8220;sulfur dance&#8221;. A dynamic covalent system involving four components illustrates the thermodynamically&#8208;driven formation of a thiacalix[2]arene[2]pyrimidine. This work stimulates the implementation of reversible SNAr reactions in organic, materials and covalent dynamic chemistry.







Abstract
We disclose the features of a category of reversible nucleophilic aromatic substitutions in view of their significance and generality in dynamic aromatic chemistry. Exchange of sulfur components surrounding arenes and heteroarenes may occur at 25&#8201;&#176;C, in a process that one may call a &#8220;sulfur dance&#8221;. These SNAr systems present their own features, apart from common reversible reactions utilized in dynamic covalent chemistry (DCC). By varying conditions, covalent dynamics may operate to provide libraries of thiaarenes with some selectivity, or conversion of a hexa(thio)benzene asterisk into another one. The reversible nature of SNAr is confirmed by three methods: a convergence of the products distribution in reversible SNAr systems, a related product redistribution between two per(thio)benzenes by using a thiolate promoter, and from kinetic/thermodynamic data. A four&#8208;component dynamic covalent system further illustrates the thermodynamically&#8208;driven formation of a thiacalix[2]arene[2]pyrimidine by sulfur component exchanges. This work stimulates the implementation of reversible SNAr in aromatic chemistry and in DCC.

&lt;p&gt;The features of a category of reversible nucleophilic aromatic substitution reactions in view of their significance and wide scope in aromatic and heteroaromatic chemistry are presented. Exchange of sulfur components surrounding arenes and heteroarenes may occur at 25&#8201;&#176;C, in a process that one may call a &#8220;sulfur dance&#8221;. A dynamic covalent system involving four components illustrates the thermodynamically-driven formation of a thiacalix[2]arene[2]pyrimidine. This work stimulates the implementation of reversible S&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;Ar reactions in organic, materials and covalent dynamic chemistry.

         <title>Mechanochemical Synthesis of Silylcyclopentenes via Ball Milling</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 51, September 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel and environmentally friendly method for synthesizing silylcyclopentenes has been developed using Ar2SiH2, Li metal, and butadiene with the ball milling technique. Additionally, DFT calculations suggest that this transformation involves a nucleophilic addition of mechanochemically generated Si&#8722;Li intermediates with butadiene to form corresponding carbon anion species, which then completes the [4+1] cycloaddition process through nucleophilic substitution with Si&#8722;H.







Abstract
The development of innovative methods for synthesizing silylcyclopentene compounds is particularly important for enriching and improving the synthetical toolbox of organosilicon compounds. Herein, a facile approach has been developed for the synthesis of silylcyclopentenes promoted by mechanochemically generated organolithium species as silicon nucleophiles under ball milling conditions, avoiding the requirement of large amounts of bulk solvent. This operationally simple method demonstrates good functional group compatibility, which provides a great opportunity for further exploration of the synthetic applications of silylcyclopentenes. Density functional theory calculations indicated that the transient lithiosilole intermediates undergo a stepwise nucleophilic addition process, which governs this mechanic&#8208;force&#8208;promoted [4+1] cycloaddition reaction.

         <title>Magnon Sensing of NO, NO2 and NH3 Gas Capture on CrSBr Monolayer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 51, September 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Br vacancies in the surface of CrSBr allow the capture of NO, NO2, and NH3. The adsorption of these harmful gas species induces a frequency shift in the magnon spectra, which makes the 2D van der Waals ferromagnet CrSBr a candidate material for molecular sensors based on magnon sensing as an alternative to conventional electronic gas sensors.







Abstract
Air pollution and greenhouse emissions are significant problems across various sectors, urging the need for advanced technologies to detect and capture harmful gases. In recent years, two&#8208;dimensional (2D) materials have attracted increasing attention due to their large surface&#8208;to&#8208;volume ratio and reactivity. Herein, we investigate the potential of single&#8208;layer CrSBr for gas sensing and capturing by means of first&#8208;principles calculations. We explore the adsorption behaviour of different pollutant gases (H2S, NH3, NO, NO2, CO and CO2) on this 2D ferromagnet and the impact of intrinsic defects on its magnetic properties. Interestingly, we find that Br vacancies enhance the adsorption of NH3, NO and NO2 and induce a selective frequency shift on the magnon dispersion. This work motivates the creation of novel magnonic gas sensing devices based on 2D van der Waals magnetic materials.

How to select a few cells from a culture and modify them with a probe? Triphenylamine&#8208;sensitized 8&#8208;DMAQ (TAQ) probes showed internalization in HeLa cells that could be consecutively activated either by using UV light source (357&#8197;nm) or, under two&#8208;photon irradiation conditions (760&#8197;nm). Activation allowed to efficient release of the reporter into cells in light&#8208;exposed regions.







Abstract
Triphenylamine&#8208;sensitized 8&#8208;dimethylaminoquinoline (TAQ) probes showed fair two&#8208;photon absorption and fragmentation cross sections in releasing kainate and GABA ligands. The water&#8208;soluble PEG and TEG&#8208;analogs allowed cell internalization and efficient light&#8208;gated liberation of the rhodamine reporter under UV and two&#8208;photon (NIR) irradiation conditions.

         <title>Enhanced Photocatalytic Ozonation Using Modified TiO2 With Designed Nucleophilic and Electrophilic Sites</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 51, September 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The surface hydroxyl groups greatly promote O3 adsorption due to the presence of nucleophilic O&#8208;sites and electrophilic H&#8208;sites. At the same time, the surface hydroxyl groups lead to the internal polarization of the surface&#8208;adsorbed O3 and enhanced separation of photogenerated charge carriers, both of which are beneficial to promote O3 activation and ROS formation. Therefore, TiO2&#8722;OH displays efficiently photocatalytic ozonation. Notably, TiO2&#8722;OH mineralization efficiency in pharmaceutical plant wastewater is as high as 97.6&#8201;% within 7&#8197;hours.







Abstract
Photocatalytic ozonation is considered to be a promising approach for the treatment of refractory organic pollutants, but the design of efficient catalyst remains a challenge. Surface modification provides a potential strategy to improve the activity of photocatalytic ozonation. In this work, density functional theory (DFT) calculations were first performed to check the interaction between O3 and TiO2&#8722;OH (surface hydroxylated TiO2) or TiO2&#8722;F (surface fluorinated TiO2), and the results suggest that TiO2&#8722;OH displays better O3 adsorption and activation than does TiO2&#8722;F, which is confirmed by experimental results. The surface hydroxyl groups greatly promote the O3 activation, which is beneficial for the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Importantly, TiO2&#8722;OH displays better performance towards pollutants (such as berberine hydrochloride) removal than does TiO2&#8722;F and most reported ozonation photocatalysts. The total organic carbon (TOC) removal efficiency reaches 84.4&#8201;% within two hours. This work highlights the effect of surface hydroxylation on photocatalytic ozonation and provides ideas for the design of efficient photocatalytic ozonation catalysts.

         <title>High Rotational Barrier Atropisomers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 51, September 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unprecedented class of atropisomers based on Ugi reaction that exhibit exceptional rotational barrier is reported. The versatility of our approach enables the synthesis of atropisomers &#8220;by design&#8221; and allow the conceptualization of this work in atroposelective synthesis and high&#8208;sensitivity modular balances. Single&#8208;crystal structures, combined by DFT calculations and dynamic NMR allow us to examine a plethora of &#960;&#8208;interactions.







Abstract
Atropisomers have attracted a great deal of attention lately due to their numerous applications in organic synthesis and to their employment in drug discovery. However, the synthetic arsenal at our disposal with which to access them remains limited. The research described herein is two&#8208;pronged; we both demonstrate the use of MCR chemistry as a synthetic strategy for the de novo synthesis of a class of atropisomers having high barriers to rotation with the simultaneous insertion of multiple chiral elements and we study these unprecedented molecular systems by employing a combination of crystallography, NMR and DFT calculations. By fully exploiting the synthetic capabilities of our chemistry, we have been able to monitor a range of different types of interaction, i.&#8201;e. &#960;&#8208;&#960;, CH&#8211;&#960;, heteroatom&#8208;&#960; and CD&#8211;&#960;, in order to conduct structure&#8208;property studies. The results could be applied both to atroposelective synthesis and in drug discovery.

         <title>Selective Oxidation of Vitamin D3 Enhanced by Long&#8208;Range Effects of a Substrate Channel Mutation in Cytochrome P450BM3 (CYP102A1)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 51, September 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Long&#8208;range effects from mutation of a substrate access tunnel residue selected by docking&#8208;guided design of cytochrome P450BM3 (CYP102A1) to loosen the interaction between two secondary structure elements reshaped the substrate binding pocket and increased the activity for the oxidation vitamin D3 to 25&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;vitamin D3, an important human and animal health supplement.







Abstract
Vitamin D deficiency affects nearly half the population, with many requiring or opting for supplements with vitamin D3 (VD3), the precursor of vitamin D (1&#945;,25&#8208;dihydroxyVD3). 25&#8208;HydroxyVD3, the circulating form of vitamin D, is a more effective supplement than VD3 but its synthesis is complex. We report here the engineering of cytochrome P450BM3 (CYP102A1) for the selective oxidation of VD3 to 25&#8208;hydroxyVD3. Long&#8208;range effects of the substrate&#8208;channel mutation Glu435Ile promoted binding of the VD3 side chain close to the heme, enhancing VD3 oxidation activity that reached 6.62&#8197;g of 25&#8208;hydroxyVD3 isolated from a 1&#8208;litre scale reaction (69.1&#8201;% yield; space&#8208;time&#8208;yield 331&#8197;mg/L/h).

         <title>Photochemical Initiation and Reactions of Thiyl Radicals Studied with SH2&#8217; Radical Traps</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 51, September 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
SH2&#8217;&#8208;based radical traps were used to probe the mechanisms of photochemical spirocyclisation of indole&#8208;ynones with thiols and a relate thiol&#8208;ene reaction. The observation of trapped initiator radicals by electrospray ionisation mass spectrometry (ESI&#8208;MS) was consistent with the proposed formation of an intramolecular electron donor&#8208;acceptor indole&#8208;ynone complex. Trends in MS intensity of trapped intermediate radicals were rationalised in terms of radical reactivity.







Abstract
A radical trapping method based on an SH2&#8217; homolytic substitution reaction was applied to study the mechanism of a photochemical spirocyclisation of indole&#8208;ynones in the presence of thiols. Starting material, products and a range of trapped radical intermediates were simultaneously detected in reaction mixtures by mass spectrometry (MS). The trapped intermediates included both initiating and main chain propagating radicals. These data made it possible to propose a self&#8208;initiation mechanism consistent with the originally postulated photoexcitation of an intramolecular electron donor&#8208;acceptor complex of the substrate. The effect of thiol structure on the MS peak intensity of the reaction components was rationalised in terms of the relative stability of the radical intermediates. The results were compared to a simpler related reaction, a photochemical thiol&#8208;ene addition where reagents, products and trapped intermediate radicals were also detected by MS. Relative MS peak intensities were again explained by a combination of electronic and steric effects on the stability of intermediate radicals. Overall, SH2&#8217; radical trapping was demonstrated to be a powerful experimental technique for providing mechanistic evidence on photochemical and other organic radical reactions.

         <title>Active Site Environment and Reactivity of Copper&#8208;A&#946; in Membrane Mimetic SDS Micellar Environment</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 51, September 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Copper interacts with A&#946; peptides in membrane&#8208;mimicking SDS micellar environments, forming Cu&#8208;A&#946; complexes that induce higher hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) production. Moreover, we observe an increased oxidation rate of neurotransmitter such as dopamine in the presence of H2O2 by Cu&#8208;A&#946; complexes.







Abstract
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by the abnormal aggregation of amyloid &#946; (A&#946;) peptide in extracellular deposits generated upon proteolysis of Amyloid Precursor Protein (APP). While copper (Cu(II)) binds to A&#946; in soluble oligomeric and aggregated forms, its interaction with membrane&#8208;bound A&#946; remains elusive. Investigating these interactions is crucial for understanding AD pathogenesis. Here, utilizing SDS micelles as a simplified membrane mimic, we focus on elucidating the interplay between membrane&#8208;anchored A&#946; and copper, given their pivotal roles in AD. We employed spectroscopic techniques including UV, CD, and EPR to characterize the active site of Cu&#8208;A&#946; complexes. Our findings demonstrate that copper interacts with A&#946; peptides in membrane&#8208;mimicking micellar environments similarly to aqueous buffer solutions. Cu&#8208;A&#946; complexes in this medium also induce higher hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) production, potentially contributing to AD&#8208;related oxidative stress. Moreover, we observe an increased oxidation rate of neurotransmitter such as dopamine by Cu&#8208;A&#946; complexes. These results enhance our understanding of Cu&#8208;A&#946; interactions in AD pathology and offer insights into potential therapeutic interventions targeting this interaction.

&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by the abnormal aggregation of amyloid &#946; (A&#946;) peptide in extracellular deposits generated upon proteolysis of Amyloid Precursor Protein (APP). While copper (Cu(II)) binds to A&#946; in soluble oligomeric and aggregated forms, its interaction with membrane-bound A&#946; remains elusive. Investigating these interactions is crucial for understanding AD pathogenesis. Here, utilizing SDS micelles as a simplified membrane mimic, we focus on elucidating the interplay between membrane-anchored A&#946; and copper, given their pivotal roles in AD. We employed spectroscopic techniques including UV, CD, and EPR to characterize the active site of Cu-A&#946; complexes. Our findings demonstrate that copper interacts with A&#946; peptides in membrane-mimicking micellar environments similarly to aqueous buffer solutions. Cu-A&#946; complexes in this medium also induce higher hydrogen peroxide (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) production, potentially contributing to AD-related oxidative stress. Moreover, we observe an increased oxidation rate of neurotransmitter such as dopamine by Cu-A&#946; complexes. These results enhance our understanding of Cu-A&#946; interactions in AD pathology and offer insights into potential therapeutic interventions targeting this interaction.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Three isomeric copper iodide cluster hybrid materials 1&#8211;3 were achieved by adjusting the reaction conditions. The crystal color transit from green, yellow to orange with high QYs at 57&#8201;%~88&#8201;%. All three complexes have good thermal stability, good solution processability, and high quantum yield. This study can provide development of cuprous iodide cluster luminescent materials.







Abstract
Copper iodide organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid materials have been favored by many researchers in the field of solid&#8208;state lighting (SSL) due to their structural diversity and optical adjustability. In this paper, three isomeric copper iodide cluster hybrid materials, Cu4I6(L)2(1), Cu5I4.5Cl2.5(L)2(2) and Cu5I7(L)2) (3) (L=1&#8208;(4&#8208;methylpyrimidin&#8208;2&#8208;yl)&#8208;1,4&#8208;diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octan&#8208;1&#8208;ium), were achieved by adjusting the reaction conditions. The crystal color transit from green, yellow to orange and the internal quantum yield (IQY) increase from 57&#8201;%&#8211;88&#8201;%. All three complexes have good thermal stability, good solution processability, and high quantum yield. And origin and mechanism of luminescence of complexes were further studied. This study can provide ideas and theoretical basis for the regulation of cuprous iodide cluster luminescent materials.

         <title>A Broadened Class of Donor&#8208;Acceptor Stacked Macrometallacyclic Adducts of Different Coinage Metals</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 51, September 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A theory&#8208;guided synthetic design of a family of dissimilar cyclic trinuclear complexes (CTC@CTC&#8217;) with tunable bonding/optoelectronic properties is reported herein, attaining record&#8208;short intermolecular distances for d10 complexes (2.868(2) &#197;) and rather&#8208;high solution binding constants (4.67&#215;105&#8197;L/mol). Photo&#8208;/electro&#8208;luminescence properties suggest metal&#8208;centered phosphorescent emissions with properties suitable for future smart materials/devices.







Abstract
A yet&#8208;outstanding supramolecular chemistry challenge is isolation of novel varieties of stacked complexes with finely&#8208;tuned donor&#8208;acceptor bonding and optoelectronic properties, as herein reported for binary adducts comprising two different cyclic trinuclear complexes (CTC@CTC&#8217;). Most previous attempts focused only on 1&#8211;2 factors among metal/ligand/substituent combinations, resulting in heterobimetallic complexes. Instead, here we show that, when all 3 factors are carefully considered, a broadened variety of CTC@CTC&#8217; stacked pairs with intuitively&#8208;enhanced intertrimer coordinate&#8208;covalent bonding strength and ligand&#8208;ligand/metal&#8208;ligand dispersion are attained (dM&#8211;M&#8217; 2.868(2) &#197;; &#916;E&gt;50&#8197;kcal/mol, an order of magnitude higher than aurophilic/metallophilic interactions). Significantly, CTC@CTC&#8217; pairs remain intact/strongly&#8208;bound even in solution (Keq 4.67&#215;105&#8197;L/mol via NMR/UV&#8208;vis titrations), and the gas phase (mass spectrometry revealing molecular peaks for the entire CTC@CTC&#8217; units in sublimed samples), rather than simple co&#8208;crystal formation. Photo&#8208;/electro&#8208;luminescence studies unravel metal&#8208;centered phosphorescence useful for novel all metal&#8208;organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (MOLEDs) optoelectronic device concepts. This work manifests systematic design of supramolecular bonding and multi&#8208;faceted spectral properties of pure metal&#8208;organic macrometallacyclic donor/acceptor (inorganic/inorganic) stacks with remarkably&#8208;rich optoelectronic properties akin to well&#8208;established organic/organic and organic/inorganic analogues.

         <title>Lead Bromide Complex in Tri&#8208;n&#8208;Octylphosphine Oxide Matrix with Bright Photoluminance and Exceptional Thermoplasticity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 51, September 11, 2024. </description>

Metal halide materials, known for their opto&#8208;electronic properties and structural diversity, face challenges due to rigidity, making them brittle and difficult to shape. We introduce a thermoplastic hybrid lead halide solid, formed by integrating lead bromide complex into a TOPO matrix. This enables near&#8208;room&#8208;temperature melt&#8208;processing, offering potential for self&#8208;healing fluorescent inks.







Abstract
Metal halide materials have recently drawn increasing research interest for their excellent opto&#8208;electronic properties and structural diversity, but their resulting rigid structures render them brittle and poor formability during manufacturing. Here we demonstrate a thermoplastic luminant hybrid lead halide solid by integrating lead bromide complex into tri&#8208;n&#8208;octylphosphine oxide (TOPO) matrix. The construction of the hybrid materials can be achieved by a simple dissolution process, in which TOPO molecules act as the solvents and ligands to yield the monodispersed clusters. The combination of these functional units enables the near&#8208;room&#8208;temperature melt&#8208;processing of the materials into targeted geometry by simple molding or printing techniques, which offer possibilities for fluorescent writing inks with outstanding self&#8208;healing capacity to physical damage. The intermarriage between metal halide clusters with functional molecules expands the range of practical applications for hybrid metal halide materials.

&lt;p&gt;Metal halide materials have recently drawn increasing research interest for their excellent opto-electronic properties and structural diversity, but their resulting rigid structures render them brittle and poor formability during manufacturing. Here we demonstrate a thermoplastic luminant hybrid lead halide solid by integrating lead bromide complex into tri-n-octylphosphine oxide (TOPO) matrix. The construction of the hybrid materials can be achieved by a simple dissolution process, in which TOPO molecules act as the solvents and ligands to yield the monodispersed clusters. The combination of these functional units enables the near-room-temperature melt-processing of the materials into targeted geometry by simple molding or printing techniques, which offer possibilities for fluorescent writing inks with outstanding self-healing capacity to physical damage. The intermarriage between metal halide clusters with functional molecules expands the range of practical applications for hybrid metal halide materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

A facile steam&#8208;assisted conversion is developed to fabricate superlong 1D Cu metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) nanowire through recrystallization mechanism. As&#8208;prepared 1D Cu MOF nanowire possesses identical crystal structure of MOF&#8208;74 and multiscale porous structure, which can effectively remove cationic dyes and is an ideal template to form Cu nanoparticle&#8208;doped carbon nanofiber with excellent electrocatalytic activity for glucose detection.







Abstract
1D nanomaterials have attracted great attention due to their outstanding anisotropic and linear structures. A facile method is developed to fabricate 1D copper metal&#8211;organic framework nanowires (Cu&#8208;MOF&#8208;NW) through steam&#8208;assisted conversion from Cu&#8208;MOF precursors. During the steam&#8208;assisted conversion, Cu&#8208;MOF precursor gradually dissolves in methanol steam, and then recrystallized into Cu&#8208;MOF&#8208;NW, which shows high aspect ratio of about 600 and identical crystal structure of MOF&#8208;74. As&#8208;prepared Cu&#8208;MOF&#8208;NW with multiscale porous structure can effectively remove cationic dyes even in dye mixture. Moreover, Cu&#8208;MOF&#8208;NW, as an ideal template, is calcined to form Cu nanoparticle&#8208;doped carbon nanofiber with maintaining its 1D morphology, which shows excellent electrocatalytic activity for the non&#8208;enzymatic sensing of glucose.

         <title>Pre&#8208;Coordination Induced Further Deamination to Create Inter&#8208;Chain Cross&#8208;Linking in Carbon Nitride for Enhanced Photocatalytic H2O2 Production</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 51, September 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A KCl&#8208;guided, pre&#8208;coordination&#8208;induced further deamination strategy has been developed to create cross&#8208;linking between different chains of polymeric carbon nitride (PCN). This sufficient pre&#8208;coordination endows the resulting CNK&#8208;2 with a relatively high degree of cross&#8208;linking, which promotes efficient inter&#8208;chain charge transport. Consequently, the obtained CNK&#8208;2 exhibits significantly enhanced photocatalytic H&#8322;O&#8322; production.







Abstract
Creating cross&#8208;linking to establish efficient inter&#8208;chain charge&#8208;transfer channels in carbon nitride represents a promising strategy for enhancing its photocatalytic capabilities. Molten salt&#8208;assisted calcining has emerged as a method for preparing cross&#8208;linked carbon nitrides. However, the precise influence of molten salts on the molecular structure of carbon nitride remains to be fully elucidated. Herein, we develop a KCl guided cross&#8208;linking reaction to preliminarily reveal the formation mechanism of cross&#8208;linking. The cross&#8208;linking reaction is initiated by the pre&#8208;coordination of amino groups with K+. Subsequent heating at high temperature converts the amino groups into chlorines. Then, dechlorination leads to the formation of cross&#8208;linking. Thus, this cross&#8208;linking reaction can be accurately described as a pre&#8208;coordination&#8208;induced, two&#8208;step deamination reaction. The pre&#8208;coordination step plays a pivotal role in the cross&#8208;linking process. Sufficient pre&#8208;coordination results in a relatively high cross&#8208;linking degree of the as&#8208;prepared CNK&#8208;2. Consequently, CNK&#8208;2 demonstrates a significantly enhanced photocatalytic H2O2 production, with a generation rate of 682&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;L&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1, about 59 times that of traditional carbon nitride.

         <title>Novel Benzothiadiazole&#8208;based Donor&#8208;Acceptor Systems: Synthesis, Ultrafast Charge Transfer and Separation Dynamics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 51, September 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new series of benzothiadiazole&#8208;based donor&#8208;acceptor chromophores with multiple donor/acceptor entities of variable electronic strengths has been designed, synthesized, and unveiled their explicit photo&#8208;electro&#8208;chemical responses for the first time. Facile intramolecular charge transfer, subsequent charge separation, and broad absorption expand their horizons in advanced optical and photonic applications.







Abstract
Near&#8208;infrared (NIR) absorbing electron donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8722;A) chromophores have been at the forefront of current energy research owing to their facile charge transfer (CT) characteristics, which are primitive for photovoltaic applications. Herein, we have designed and developed a new set of benzothiadiazole (BTD)&#8208;based tetracyanobutadiene (TCBD)/dicyanoquinodimethane (DCNQ)&#8208;embedded multimodular D&#8722;A systems (BTD1&#8208;BTD6) and investigated their inherent photo&#8208;electro&#8208;chemical responses for the first time having identical and mixed terminal donors of variable donicity. Apart from poor luminescence, the appearance of broad low&#8208;lying optical transitions extendable even in the NIR region (&gt;1000&#8197;nm), particularly in the presence of the auxiliary acceptors, are indicative of underlying nonradiative excited state processes leading to robust intramolecular CT and subsequent charge separation (CS) processes in these D&#8722;A constructs. While electrochemical studies identify the moieties involved in these photo&#8208;events, orbital delocalization and consequent evidence for the low&#8208;energy CT transitions have been achieved from theoretical calculations. Finally, the spectral and temporal responses of different photoproducts are obtained from femtosecond transient absorption studies, which, coupled with spectroelectrochemical data, identify broad NIR signals as CS states of the compounds. All the systems are found to be susceptible to ultrafast (~ps) CT and CS before carrier recombination to the ground state, which is, however, significantly facilitated after incorporation of the secondary TCBD/DCNQ acceptors, leading to faster and thus efficient CT processes, particularly in polar solvents. These findings, including facile CT/CS and broad and intense panchromatic absorption over a wide window of the electromagnetic spectrum, are likely to expand the horizons of BTD&#8208;based multimodular CT systems to revolutionize the realm of solar energy conversion and associated photonic applications.

Different with the charging method of conventional batteries, charging is achieved by a Zn sheet contacting with a WO3 film moistened with water, resulting in a rapid discoloration of WO3, and the open&#8208;circuit voltage of the device is 0.7&#8197;V, which can be used to drive various electronics by series&#8208;parallel connection.







Abstract
Charging power supplies with both fast and visualization functions have a wide range of applications in the information and new energy industries. In this paper, the visualized and contact&#8208;type fast charging power supply based on WO3 film and Zn sheet is presented, and the prototype devices are fabricated. Different with the charging method of conventional batteries, charging is achieved by a Zn sheet contacting with a WO3 film moistened with water, resulting in a rapid discoloration of WO3. Theoretical investigation indicates that the interaction between Zn sheet and water molecules is the primary cause of the color change in the WO3 film. The WO3 film completes the colouring state within 10&#8197;s in the presence of Zn sheet and water, and the open&#8208;circuit voltage of the device is 0.7&#8197;V, which can be used to drive various electronics by series&#8208;parallel connection. This research introduces a novel method to induce colouring of WO3 films and proposes a fast charging mode different from traditional power sources. It provides valuable insights for the future development of fast charging in the field of electrical energy.

         <title>Elucidating Mechanism and Selectivity in Pyridine Functionalization Through Silylium Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 51, September 11, 2024. </description>

Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that a semi&#8208;enclosed &#8242;rigid&#8217; electronegative cavity in PADI&#8208;type anions creates a well&#8208;defined recognition site, facilitating interaction with positively charged silylium pyridine species. Due to the high electrophilicity and minimal steric demand at the C4&#8208;position of the pyridine substrate, the reaction predominantly produces a C4&#8208;regioselective product.







Abstract
The functionalization of aromatic N&#8208;heterocycles through silylium activation demonstrates exceptional selectivity and efficiency. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations unveil the detailed silylium catalysis mechanism and elucidate the origins of selectivity in this reaction. The phosphoramidimidate sulfonamide (PADI) precatalyst orchestrates of the catalytic cycle via three elementary steps. The Br&#248;nsted acidity of precatalyst significantly influences both the formation of silylium&#8208;based Lewis acid active species and the silylium activation of pyridine. Unlike disulfonimide (DSI)&#8208;type precatalysts, both Tf2NH and PADI precatalysts with strong acidities can easily promote the generation of activated silylium pyridine species. A semi&#8208;enclosed &#8242;rigid&#8217; electronegative cavity in PADI&#8208;type anions constructs a well&#8208;defined recognition site, facilitating engagement with the positively charged silylium pyridine species. Due to the high electrophilicity and less steric demand at the C4&#8208;position of the pyridine substrate, the product with C4&#8208;regioselectivity was predominantly generated.

         <title>Single&#8208;Molecule Cross&#8208;Plane Conductance of Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbon Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 51, September 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The cross&#8208;plane break junction (XPBJ) measurement results of pyrene derivatives confirm that hydrogenation reduces conductance, while conductance of pyrene derivatives increased after substitution by both electron&#8208;donating and electron&#8208;withdrawing groups. It is found that only the trend of decreasing conductance for hydro&#8208;pyrene was consistent with the change in aromaticity.







Abstract
In the cross&#8208;plane single&#8208;molecule junctions, the correlation between molecular aromaticity and conductance remained puzzling. Cross&#8208;plane break junction (XPBJ) provides new insight into understanding the role of aromaticity and conjugation to molecules on charge transport through the planar molecules. In this work, we investigated the modulation of cross&#8208;plane charge transport in pyrene derivatives by hydrogenation and substituents based on the XPBJ method that differs from those used in&#8208;plane transport. We measured the electrical conductance of the hydrogenated derivatives of the pyrenes and found that hydrogenation reduces conductance, and the fully hydrogenated molecule has the lowest conductance. Conductance of pyrene derivatives increased after substitution by both electron&#8208;donating and electron&#8208;withdrawing groups. By calculating, the trend in decreased conductance of hydrogenated pyrene was found to be consistent with the change in aromaticity. Electron&#8208;withdrawing substituents reduce the aromaticity of the molecule and narrow the HOMO&#8208;LUMO gap, while electron&#8208;donating groups increase the aromaticity but also narrow the gap. Our work reveals the potential of fine&#8208;tuning the structure of the pyrene molecule to control the cross&#8208;plane charge transport through the single&#8208;molecule junctions.

         <title>Mesoionic Janus&#8208;Type Dicarbene: Complexes, Adducts, and Catalytic Studies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 51, September 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Transition metal and main group adducts of the first mesoionic Janus&#8208;type N&#8208;heterocyclic dicarbene (diNHC) are thoroughly described in terms of their preparations, characterizations, and electronic properties. In addition, a preliminary catalytic study of its dipalladium complex in the sequential C2&#8208; and C5&#8208;arylation of 1&#8208;methylpyrrole affording non&#8208;symmetrical 2,5&#8208;diarylpyrroles is included.







Abstract
The preparations of homo&#8208; and hetero&#8208;bimetallic complexes as well as thiourea and selenourea derivatives of a mesoionic Janus&#8208;type N&#8208;heterocyclic dicarbene (diNHC) are reported. Analogues of its monocationic intermediate NHC have also been obtained for comparison. Using the main group adducts, the &#960;&#8208;acceptor properties of both NHCs were determined using low temperature 77Se NMR spectroscopy completing their stereoelectronic profiling. Moreover, catalytic investigations reveal that the mesoionic dipalladium Janus&#8208;diNHC complex can be used in the sequential C2&#8208; and C5&#8208;arylation of 1&#8208;methylpyrrole for the preparation of non&#8208;symmetrical 2,5&#8208;diarylpyrroles.

         <title>Dynamic Structural Fluxionality in a Planar Tetracoordinate Carbon Cluster Stabilized by Boron Ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 51, September 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We reported a molecular compasses CB2H5+ with a planar tetracoordinate carbon (ptC) atom, two ligand hydrogen atoms attached to the carbon rotate alternately. This is the first global minimum for boron&#8208;coordinated ptC clusters with dynamic fluxionality.







Abstract
The design of boron&#8208;based molecular rotors stems from boron&#8208;carbon binary clusters containing multiple planar hypercoordinate carbons (phCs, such as C2B8). However, the design of boron&#8208;coordinated phCs is challenging due to boron's tendency to occupy hypercoordinate centers more than carbon. Although this challenge has been addressed, the designed clusters of interest have not exhibited dynamic fluxionality similar to that of the initial C2B8. To address this issue, we report a &#963;/&#960; doubly aromatic CB2H5+ cluster, the first global minimum containing a boron&#8208;coordinated planar tetracoordinate carbon atom with dynamic fluxionality. Dynamics simulations show that two ligand H atoms exhibit alternate rotation, resulting in an intriguing dynamic fluxionality in this cluster. Electronic structure analysis reveals the flexible bonding positions of the ligand H atoms because they do not participate in &#960; delocalized bonding nor bond to any other non&#8208;carbon atom, highlighting this rotational fluxionality. Unprecedentedly, the fluxional process involves not only the usual conversion of the number of bonding atoms, but also the type of bonding (3c &#960; bonds &#8596;4c &#963; bonds), which is an uncommon fluxional mechanism. The cluster represents an effort to apply phC species to molecular machines.

         <title>Design of an Acidic pH&#8208;Activated NIR Fluorescent Convertible Rhodamine&#8722;Hemicyanine Probe&#8208;Peptide Conjugate for Living Cancer Cell Active Targeted Selective Tracking of Lysosomes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 51, September 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A closed and an open state switchable rhodamine&#8208;hemicyanine probe&#8208;peptide conjugate is presented. Acidic pH&#8208;activated NIR fluorescent convertible probe&#8208;peptide conjugate can be used for live cancer cell active targeted selective tracking and ratiometric imaging of lysosomes.







Abstract
We have synthesized an acidic pH&#8208;activatable dual targeting ratiometric fluorescent probe&#8208;peptide conjugate using the SPPS protocol on Rink amide AM resin. Living carcinoma cell specific active targeting, successive cell penetration, and selective staining of lysosomes are accomplished. Real&#8208;time monitoring of lysosomes, 3D, and multicolor cancer cell imaging are also attained.

&lt;p&gt;A closed and an open state switchable rhodamine-hemicyanine probe-peptide conjugate is presented. Acidic pH-activated NIR fluorescent convertible probe-peptide conjugate can be used for live cancer cell active targeted selective tracking and ratiometric imaging of lysosomes.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have synthesized an acidic pH-activatable dual targeting ratiometric fluorescent probe-peptide conjugate using the SPPS protocol on Rink amide AM resin. Living carcinoma cell specific active targeting, successive cell penetration, and selective staining of lysosomes are accomplished. Real-time monitoring of lysosomes, 3D, and multicolor cancer cell imaging are also attained. The de novo design consists of the integration of multifunctionality into a single molecular scaffold, e.&#8201;g., RGDS peptide residue to target cancer cell surface overexpressed receptor &lt;i&gt;&#945;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;i&gt;&#946;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; integrin, live-cell penetrating organic unsymmetrical rhodamine-hemicyanine chromophore comprising a lysosome targeting morpholine group, and an acidic pH openable spiro-lactam ring for a visible-to-NIR switchable ratiometric response. Water-soluble fluorescent probe-peptide conjugate exhibits intramolecular spirolactamization at basic pH through Arg amide N. The visible spirolactam state predominantly exists at physiological and basic pH and can be switched to the highly conjugated NIR open amide state (&lt;i&gt;&#955;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;em&lt;/sub&gt;=735&#8197;nm) through spiro-lactam ring opening triggered by acidic pH with a huge bathochromic shift (&#916;&lt;i&gt;&#955;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;abs&lt;/sub&gt;=336&#8197;nm, &#916;&lt;i&gt;&#955;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;FL&lt;/sub&gt;=265&#8197;nm). Moreover, pH-sensitive ratiometric optical switching is achieved. This &lt;i&gt;in&#8197;situ&lt;/i&gt; acidic cancer cell lysosome activatable multifunctional fluorophore-peptide conjugate shows augmented molar absorptivity, enhanced quantum yield, and improved fluorescence lifetime at acidic lysosomal pH; negligible cytotoxicity; and dual targeted ratiometric imaging capability of living cancer cell selective lysosomes with a p&lt;i&gt;K&lt;/i&gt;

         <title>CoCorrole&#8208;Functionalized PCN&#8208;222 for Carbon Monoxide Selective Adsorption</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 51, September 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have combined the carbon monoxide chemisorption properties of cobalt corroles with the high porosity and stability of the PCN&#8208;222 MOFs. High performance materials for the selective and reversible adsorption of CO vs O2, N2 and CO2 at low pressure have been obtained.







Abstract
The high risk of CO poisoning justifies the need for indoor air quality control and warning systems based on the detection of low concentrations (ppm&#8208;ppb) of CO. Cobalt corrole complexes selectively bind CO vs. O2, CO2, N2, opening new fields of applications. By combining the CO chemisorption properties of cobalt corroles with the known sorption capacity of MOFs, we hope to obtain high performance sensing materials for CO detection. In addition, the exposed metal sites of MOFs lead to CO2 physisorption, allowing the co&#8208;detection of CO and CO2. In this work, PCN&#8208;222, a stable Zr&#8208;based MOF made from Ni(TCPP) with natural vacancies, has been used as a porous matrix for the grafting of electron&#8208;poor metallocorroles. The materials were characterized by powder XRD, SEM and optical microscopy, BET analyses and gas adsorption measurements at 298&#8197;K. No degradation of the crystalline structure of PCN&#8208;222 was observed. At 1&#8197;atm, the adsorbed CO(g) volumes measured for the best materials were 12.15&#8197;cm3&#8201;g&#8722;1 and 14.01&#8197;cm3&#8201;g&#8722;1 for CoCorr2@PCN&#8208;222 and CoCorr3@PCN&#8208;222 respectively, and both materials exhibited high CO chemisorption and selectivity against O2, N2, and CO2 at low pressure due to the highest energy of the chemisorption process vs physisorption.

         <title>Electrostatic Surface Potentials and Chalcogen&#8208;Bonding Motifs of Substituted 2,1,3&#8208;Benzoselenadiazoles Probed via 77Se Solid&#8208;State NMR Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 51, September 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The influence of substituents on the self&#8208;complementary chalcogen bonding of 2,1,3&#8208;benzoselenadiazoles is investigated through solid&#8208;state and computational methods. 77Se solid&#8208;state NMR is found to be a sensitive probe of molecular surface potentials and chalcogen bond motifs.







Abstract
Chalcogen bonds (ChB) are moderately strong, directional, and specific non&#8208;covalent interactions that have garnered substantial interest over the last decades. Specifically, the presence of two &#963;&#8208;holes offers great potential for crystal engineering, catalysis, biochemistry, and molecular sensing. However, ChB applications are currently hampered by a lack of methods to characterize and control chalcogen bonds. Here, we report on the influence of various substituents (halogens, cyano, and methyl groups) on the observed self&#8208;complementary ChB networks of 2,1,3&#8208;benzoselenadiazoles. From molecular electrostatic potential calculations, we show that the electrostatic surface potentials (ESP) of the &#963;&#8208;holes on selenium are largely influenced by the electron&#8208;withdrawing character of these substituents. Structural analyses via X&#8208;ray diffraction reveal a variety of ChB geometries and binding modes that are rationalized via the computed ESP maps, although the structure of 5,6&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;2,1,3&#8208;benzoselenadiazole also demonstrates the influence of steric interactions. 77Se solid&#8208;state magic&#8208;angle spinning NMR spectroscopy, in particular the analysis of the selenium chemical shift tensors, is found to be an effective probe able to characterize both structural and electrostatic features of these self&#8208;complementary ChB systems. We find a positive correlation between the value of the ESP maxima at the &#963;&#8208;holes and the experimentally measured 77Se isotropic chemical shift, while the skew of the chemical shift tensor is established as a metric which is reflective of the ChB binding motif.

We have developed radical C&#8208;glycosylation using photoexcitable unprotected glycosyl borate. The direct excitation of glycosyl borate under visible light irradiation enabled the generation of anomeric radical without any photoredox catalysts. The in&#8197;situ generated anomeric radical was applicable to the radical addition such as Giese&#8208;type addition and Minisci&#8208;type reaction to introduce alkyl and heteroaryl groups at the anomeric position. In addition, the radical&#8211;radical coupling between the glycosyl borate and acyl imidazolide provided unprotected acyl C&#8208;glycoside.

         <title>Elevating Oxygen Evolution using Iron Phthalocyanine Infused Vanillic acid Electrocatalyst</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 51, September 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The designing of transition metal based organic catalyst plays an important role in water oxidation to produce oxygen. The present work involves the fabrication of iron based phthalocyanine catalyst on Ni foam which exhibited higher oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity with lower overpotential compared to standard IrO2&#8901; It emphasizes the role of bimetallic Fe and Ni catalyst in the enhancement of OER activity.







Abstract
Oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is the bottle neck step in water splitting reaction towards the realization of hydrogen based clean energy production and storage.

&lt;p&gt;The designing of transition metal based organic catalyst plays an important role in water oxidation to produce oxygen. The present work involves the fabrication of iron based phthalocyanine catalyst on Ni foam which exhibited higher oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity with lower overpotential compared to standard IrO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8901; It emphasizes the role of bimetallic Fe and Ni catalyst in the enhancement of OER activity.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is the bottle neck step in water splitting reaction towards the realization of hydrogen based clean energy production and storage. Metal air batteries and polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells (PEMFC) are the alternative green energy systems that utilise O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in the production of continuous and high energy output without the utilization of carbon based fuels which are the major sources of pollution. Transition metal based N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; organics are explored extensively as oxygen electrocatalysts i.&#8201;e., OER and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalysts because of their ease of synthesis, tuneable properties, low cost and high performance with long term stability. Here, vanillic acid functionalized iron phthalocyanine (FeVAPc) was synthesised and characterised by various spectroscopic techniques. The novel FeVAPc exhibited good thermal stability and was coated on Ni foam for OER studies. The scanning electron microscopy images showed net-work like surface morphology and the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy indicated the presence of Fe in +3 oxidation state. The Ni/FeVAPc demonstrated excellent electrocatalytic activity for OER with overpotential of 312&#8197;mV at 10&#8197;mA.cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; current density in 1.0&#8197;M KOH electrolyte. The designed organic based catalyst exhibited lesser Tafel slope value which is nearer to the benchmark catalyst, IrO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. The proposed catalyst exhibited good stability as phthalocyanines are highly stable and do not undergo decomposition even in strong acidic and basic corrosive media. Integration of FeVAPc onto the Ni foam resulted in higher mass activity, lower charge transfer resistance, high active surface area leading to enhanced conductivity and activity. The fabricated Ni/FeVAPc is an appropriate cost-effective, efficient and stable catalyst for OER towards industrial applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

The Front Cover shows a circle dance with musical notes around a sulfurated benzene ring. By analogy, it represents exchanges of sulfur components surrounding arenes and heteroarenes that can occur in a process that one might call a &#8220;sulfur dance&#8221;. It shows the reversible nature of some nucleophilic aromatic substitutions in view of their significance and generality in dynamic aromatic chemistry. This is a collaborative efforts between three groups (Ceroni's, Lehn's and Gingras&#8217;). More information can be found in the Research Article by J.&#8208;L. Schmitt, J.&#8208;M. Lehn, M.

The Cover Feature represents a gas&#8208;sensing device in which a single layer of the 2D van der Waals ferromagnet CrSBr is embedded. The 2D material has Br vacancies that are highlighted by bright ellipsoids. From the right side, a collection of pollutant gas species appears (NO, NO2, NH3, CO, CO2 and H2S). Those containing nitrogen (blue atoms) are attracted by the vacancies, and a molecule of NO2 is attached to the material. On the left side, the background shows a wave pattern to illustrate the concept of magnon sensing that diffuses into a smoke cloud on the right, representing air pollution.

As coagulants, various weak organic acids have a more significant impact on tailoring the physical properties of cellulose aerogel beads than does strong hydrochloric acid. The pKa value and the high hydrogen bond donor&#8211;acceptor property of acids play vital roles in determining shrinkage behavior, specific surface area, pore volume and microstructure. More information can be found in the Research Article by K. Ganesan and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202401794).

         <dc:description>
Judicious selection of metals, ligands and substituents results in a hitherto unprecedented broadened variety of binary adducts comprising two different cyclic trinuclear complexes (CTC@CTC&#8217;). The stacked pairs exhibit enhanced intertrimer coordinate&#8208;covalent bonding strength, an order of magnitude higher than metallophilic interactions. CTC@CTC&#8217; pairs remain intact/strongly bound even in solution or the gas phase. Remarkable RGB luminescence results from electromagnetic irradiation or electric drive voltage.

         <title>Gas Delivery Relevant to Human Health using Porous Materials</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 51, September 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Gases are essential for various applications relevant to human health and medicine. This Perspective aims to review the use of porous materials for the delivery of medicinally relevant gases including hydrogen sulfide, xenon, oxygen, and various gases for organic synthesis and to highlight the advantages of these solid&#8208;state systems over traditional methods of gas storage and delivery.







Abstract
Gases are essential for various applications relevant to human health, including in medicine, biomedical imaging, and pharmaceutical synthesis. However, gases are significantly more challenging to safely handle than liquids and solids. Herein, we review the use of porous materials, such as metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs), zeolites, and silicas, to adsorb medicinally relevant gases and facilitate their handling as solids. Specific topics include the use of MOFs and zeolites to deliver H2S for therapeutic applications, 129Xe for magnetic resonance imaging, O2 for the treatment of cancer and hypoxia, and various gases for use in organic synthesis.

&lt;p&gt;Gases are essential for various applications relevant to human health and medicine. This Perspective aims to review the use of porous materials for the delivery of medicinally relevant gases including hydrogen sulfide, xenon, oxygen, and various gases for organic synthesis and to highlight the advantages of these solid-state systems over traditional methods of gas storage and delivery.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gases are essential for various applications relevant to human health, including in medicine, biomedical imaging, and pharmaceutical synthesis. However, gases are significantly more challenging to safely handle than liquids and solids. Herein, we review the use of porous materials, such as metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), zeolites, and silicas, to adsorb medicinally relevant gases and facilitate their handling as solids. Specific topics include the use of MOFs and zeolites to deliver H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S for therapeutic applications, &lt;sup&gt;129&lt;/sup&gt;Xe for magnetic resonance imaging, O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; for the treatment of cancer and hypoxia, and various gases for use in organic synthesis. This Perspective aims to bring together the organic, inorganic, medicinal, and materials chemistry communities to inspire the design of next-generation porous materials for the storage and delivery of medicinally relevant gases.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Platinum Elimination From Bis(triethylsilylpolyynyl) Complexes and Macrocycles Comprised of Four L2Pt Corners and Four C&#926;CC&#926;CC&#926;C Linkers; An Approach to Cyclo[24]carbon</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The overarching goal of this study is to effect the elimination of platinum from adducts with cis &#8208;C&#926;C&#8208;Pt&#8208;C&#926;C&#8208; linkages, thereby generating novel conjugated polyynes. Thus, the bis(hexatriynyl) complex trans&#8208;(p&#8208;tol3P)2Pt((C&#926;C)3H)2&#160;is treated with 1,3&#8208;diphosphines R2C(C&#173;H2PPh2)2&#160;to generate (R2C(CH2PPh2)2)2Pt((C&#926;C)3H)2&#160;(14; R = c, n&#8208;Bu; e, p&#8208;tolCH2). These con&#173;dense with the diiodide complexes R2C(CH2PPh2)2PtI2&#160;(9a,c) in the presence of CuI (cat.) and excess HNEt2&#160;to give the title macrocycles [(R2C(CH2PPh2)2)Pt(C&#926;C)3]4&#160;(16c,e) as adducts of the byproduct [H2NEt2]+&#160;I&#8211;&#160;(30&#8208;66%). DOSY NMR experiments establish that this association is maintained in solution, but NaOAc removes the ammonium salt. The bis(triethylsilylpolyynyl) complexes (n&#8208;Bu2C(CH2PPh2)2)Pt((C&#926;C)nSiEt3)2&#160;(n = 2, 3) are synthesized analogously to 14c. They react with I2&#160;at rt to give mainly the diiodide complex 9c and the coupling product Et3Si(C&#926;CC&#926;C)nSiEt3. The possibility of competing reactions giving IC&#926;C species is investigated. Analogous reactions of the Pt4C24&#160;macrocycle 16c also give 9c, but no sp 13C NMR signals or mass spectrometric Cxz+&#160;ions (x = 24&#8208;100) could be detected. It is proposed that some cyclo[24]car&#173;bon is generated, but then rapidly converts to other forms of elemental carbon. No cyclotetracosane (C24H48) is detected when this sequence is carried out in the presence of PtO2&#160;and H2.</dc:description>

         <title>Insights into the Synergistic Catalytic Effect of TiO2 Supported V&#8208;W Oxides for Selective C&#8211;H Bond Oxidation of Cyclohexane to KA Oil</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>It is urgent to develop an efficient and stable non&#8208;noble metal catalyst for selective C&#8211;H bond oxidation of cyclohexane. Herein, a series of V&#8208;W oxides supported on TiO2&#160;catalysts (V&#8208;W/TiO2) were fabricated. The V&#8208;W/TiO2&#160;catalysts exhibited much higher catalytic activity for the selective oxidation of cyclohexane to KA oil, compared to that of V/TiO2&#160;and W/TiO2&#160;catalysts. The good distribution of active metals and the synergistic effect were responsible for the enhanced catalytic activity. H2&#8208;TPR results disclosed that the presence of V in&#160;V&#8208;W/TiO2 affected the reducibility of W6+&#160;species, and XPS verified that an electronic interaction was formed between them. Such results led to good catalytic reusability of V&#8208;W/TiO2&#160;catalyst during the reactions, and no obvious activity loss was found after six runs. The reaction mechanism was investigated, and the results verified that hydroxyl radicals generated from H2O2&#160;homolysis were the main active oxidative species. Theoretical study revealed that V dopant could regulate electronic structure of adjacent O atom, facilitating the adsorption of cyclohexane, and lower energy was needed for the rate&#8208;limiting step over V&#8208;W/TiO2&#160;during the whole oxidation reaction. This work developed an efficient V&#8208;W/TiO2&#160;catalyst for the selective oxidation of cyclohexane via a synergistic effect.</dc:description>

         <title>Intramolecular Pericyclic Re&#8208;hydroboration via Six&#8208;membered Transition State: Synthesis of Fused Borolo[3,2&#8208;b]siloles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We experimentally demonstrate a new type of the intramolecular reaction between non&#8208;activated alkyne units and the dialkylboryl group (9&#8208;BBN), which was previously only hypothesized and studied on a calculational level. The reaction described here can formally be classified as a 1,2&#8208;hydroboration reaction, but, in contrast to the classical mechanism via a cyclic four&#8208;membered transition state, the reaction proceeds by a pericyclic mechanism involving a six&#8208;membered transition state. In practice, the reaction allows the synthesis of a new class of the borolenes fused with silole or dihydrosilole units. Thus, the heating (125&#176;C) of 2,3&#8208;dihydrosiloles or 2,3&#8208;dihydrosilolo[2,3&#8208;b]silole bearing 9&#8208;BBN and propargyl or dimethylpropargyl groups in positions 4 and 5, respectively, affords, in high to moderate yields, di&#8208; and tricyclic compounds containing a borolo[3,2&#8208;b]silole unit. In all cases, the reactions are accompanied by an unprecedented dehydroboration of the 9&#8208;BBN fragment, leading, in the final products, to a cyclooct&#8208;4&#8208;enyl group on the boron atom. The effects of the substituents on the rate and the selectivity of the reaction are discussed. The structures of all the new compounds have been determined from HRMS together with multinuclear 1D and 2D NMR spectroscopy, the results of which are in excellent agreement with DFT calculated chemical shifts.</dc:description>

         <title>Transition State Stabilizing Effects of Oxygen and Sulfur Chalcogen Bond Interactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The transition stabilizing effects of chalcogen bonding interactions of oxygen and sulfur were studied using molecular rotors. The transition stabilizing effects of sulfur and oxygen chalcogen bonds were quantitatively measured and compared. Their strengths strongly correlated with the calculated electrostatic potential (ESP) on the surface of the chalcogen atoms in contact with the chalcogen bond donor.







Abstract
Non&#8208;covalent chalcogen bond (ChB) interactions have found utility in many fields, including catalysis, organic semiconductors, and crystal engineering. In this study, the transition stabilizing effects of ChB interactions of oxygen and sulfur were experimentally measured using a series of molecular rotors. The rotors were designed to form ChB interactions in their bond rotation transition states. This enabled the kinetic influences to be assessed by monitoring changes in the rotational barriers. Despite forming weaker ChB interactions, the smaller chalcogens were able to stabilize transition states and had measurable kinetic effects on the rotational barriers. Sulfur stabilized the bond rotation transition state by as much as &#8722;7.2&#8197;kcal/mol without electron&#8208;withdrawing groups. The key was to design a system where the sulfur 

&#963;

 ${\sigma }$



&#8208;hole was aligned with the lone pairs of the chalcogen bond acceptor. Oxygen rotors also could form transition state stabilizing ChB interactions but required electron&#8208;withdrawing groups. For both oxygen and sulfur ChB interactions, a strong correlation was observed between transition state stabilizing abilities and electrostatic potential (ESP) of the chalcogen, providing a useful predictive parameter for the rational design of future ChB systems.

         <dc:description>
Merging of N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene catalysis with transition metal catalysis has attracted increasing attention as they offer new catalytic processes to achieve unprecedented transformations with broad substrate scope and excellent stereoselectivity, which are unfeasible with individual catalyst. This review summarizes the recent achievements of NHC/transition metal dual catalysis, including the reaction design, mechanistic studies and practical applications.







Abstract
N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene catalysis has been developed as a versatile method for the enantioselective synthesis of complex organic molecules in organic chemistry. Merging of N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene catalysis with transition metal catalysis holds the potential to achieve unprecedented transformations with broad substrate scope and excellent stereoselectivity, which are unfeasible with individual catalyst. Thus, this dual catalysis has attracted increasing attention, and numerous elegant dual catalytic systems have been established.

&lt;p&gt;Merging of N-heterocyclic carbene catalysis with transition metal catalysis has attracted increasing attention as they offer new catalytic processes to achieve unprecedented transformations with broad substrate scope and excellent stereoselectivity, which are unfeasible with individual catalyst. This review summarizes the recent achievements of NHC/transition metal dual catalysis, including the reaction design, mechanistic studies and practical applications.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;N-heterocyclic carbene catalysis has been developed as a versatile method for the enantioselective synthesis of complex organic molecules in organic chemistry. Merging of N-heterocyclic carbene catalysis with transition metal catalysis holds the potential to achieve unprecedented transformations with broad substrate scope and excellent stereoselectivity, which are unfeasible with individual catalyst. Thus, this dual catalysis has attracted increasing attention, and numerous elegant dual catalytic systems have been established. In this review, we summarize the recent achievements of dual NHC/transition metal catalysis, including the reaction design, mechanistic studies and practical applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>The Quest for Stable Borozene Core in Main&#8208;Group Capped Inverse Sandwich Complexes, [(HE)2B6H6]2&#8722; (E=B, Al, Ga, In, and Tl)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Orbital Engineering helps to design ideal caps to stabilize {B6H6} core in inverse sandwiches using group 13 elements as caps. Optimal ring&#8208;cap overlap makes AlH and GaH as nearly ideal caps for B6H6 ring. Estimates of aromaticity of HEB6H6EH using NICS is comparable to that of benzene, justifying the borozene nomenclature.







Abstract
The ubiquitous chemistry of benzene led us to explore ways to stabilise analogous borozene, by capping them with appropriate groups. The mismatch in overlap of ring&#8208;cap fragment molecular orbitals in [(HB)2B6H6]2&#8722; is overcome by replacing the two BH caps with higher congeners of boron. We calculated the relative energies of all the polyhedral structural candidates for [(HE)2B6H6]2&#8722; (E=Al&#8722;Tl) and found hexagonal bipyramid (HBP) to be more stable with Al&#8722;H caps. A global minimum search also gives HBP as the most stable structure for [Al2B6H8]2&#8722;. The capped B6H6 ring in [(HAl)2B6H6]2&#8722; has aromaticity comparable to that of benzene.

         <title>Syntheses of Diarylmethanes Via an Oxidative Benzylic Functionalization of P&#8208;Alkyl Phenol Derivatives Under Quaternary Ammonium Hypoiodite Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two oxidative quaternary ammonium hypoiodite&#8208;catalyzed strategies for the syntheses of diarylmethanes starting from simple p&#8208;alkyl phenol derivatives have been successfully implemented.







Abstract
We herein report two strategies for the quaternary ammonium hypoiodite&#8208;mediated oxidative benzylic functionalization of p&#8208;alkyl phenol derivatives. By using either dibenzoylperoxide or H2O2 in hexafluoroisopropanol in the presence of tetrabutyl ammonium iodide gives access to activated intermediates which can then be coupled with electron&#8208;rich aromatic compounds. Overall, this sequential two&#8208;step one&#8208;pot procedure gives access to diversely decorated diarylmethane derivatives straightforwardly. Furthermore, the suitability of these products to undergo further oxidation reactions was successfully demonstrated.

We designed seven dithienobenzothiazole (DBT) derivatives by considering previous machine&#8208;learning study indicating that the number of hydrogen&#8208;bonding acceptor (NHBA) is important index for the hole mobility of organic semiconductors. The solution&#8208;processed top&#8208;gate bottom&#8208;contact devices of DBTs exhibit hole mobilities of up to 0.16&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1.







Abstract
Inspired by the previous machine&#8208;learning study that the number of hydrogen&#8208;bonding acceptor (NHBA) is important index for the hole mobility of organic semiconductors, seven dithienobenzothiazole (DBT) derivatives 1&#8201;a&#8211;g (NHBA=5) were designed and synthesized by one&#8208;step functionalization from a common precursor. X&#8208;ray single&#8208;crystal structural analyses confirmed that the molecular arrangements of 1b (the diethyl and ethylthienyl derivative) and 1c (the di(n&#8208;propyl) and n&#8208;propylthienyl derivative) in the crystal are classified into brickwork structures with multidirectional intermolecular charge&#8208;transfer integrals, as a result of incorporation of multiple hydrogen&#8208;bond acceptors. The solution&#8208;processed top&#8208;gate bottom&#8208;contact devices of 1b and 1c had hole mobilities of 0.16 and 0.029&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1s&#8722;1, respectively.

         <title>Redox&#8208;Triggered Reversible Switching between Dynamic and Quasi&#8208;static &#945;&#8208;Helical Peptides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A significant change in the interconversion rate between the right&#8208; and left&#8208;handed &#945;&#8208;helices, composed mainly of achiral units, has been successfully achieved through the redox&#8208;triggered reversible transformations of a doubly stapled &#945;&#8208;helical peptide with a rigid staple and a dynamic disulfide staple into a singly stapled one with a dithiol.







Abstract
We report the reversible transformation between a singly stapled dynamic &#945;&#8208;helical peptide and a doubly stapled quasi&#8208;static one through redox&#8208;triggered dithiol/disulfide conversions of a stapling moiety. This process allows the rate of interconversion between the right&#8208;handed (P) and left&#8208;handed (M) &#945;&#8208;helices to be altered by a factor of approximately 103 before and after the transformation. An as&#8208;obtained doubly stapled &#945;&#8208;helical peptide, which is composed of an achiral peptide having an l&#8208;valine carboxylic acid residue at the C&#8208;terminus, a disulfide&#8208;based reversible staple, and a biphenyl&#8208;based fixed staple, adopts an (M)&#8208;rich form as a kinetically trapped state. The (M)&#8208;rich helix was subsequently transformed into the thermodynamically stable (P)&#8208;rich form in 1,1,2,2&#8208;tetrachloroethane with the half&#8208;life time (t1/2) of approximately 44&#8197;days at 25&#8201;&#176;C. Reduction of the doubly stapled peptide with tri&#8208;n&#8208;butylphosphine in tetrahydrofuran/water (10/1, v/v) produced the corresponding singly stapled dynamic &#945;&#8208;helical peptide bearing two thiol groups at the side chains, which underwent solvent&#8208;induced reversible helicity inversion. The resulting dithiol of the singly stapled peptide could be reoxidized to form the original doubly stapled form using 4,4&#8217;&#8208;dithiodipyridine. Furthermore, the P/M interconversion of a doubly stapled peptide with two flexible hydrocarbon&#8208;based staples is considerably more rapid than that with more rigid staples.

         <title>Substituent Effects in Scholl&#8208;type Reactions of 1,2&#8208;Terphenyls to Triphenylenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A series of 3,3&#8221;&#8208; and 4,4&#8221;&#8208;dimethoxy terphenyls with different second substituents on their ortho&#8208;positions have been synthesized and investigated upon the possibility to be oxidatively cyclodehydrogenated to the corresponding triphenylenes under Scholl&#8208;type conditions. The experimentally obtained selectivities were supported and explained by quantum chemical calculations and conclusions on the involved mechanisms (acid catalyzed arenium&#8208;ion mechanism (AIM) vs radical cation mechanism) were drawn.</dc:description>

         <title>Superactivity of Bimetallic CuFeO2&#160;&#160;Submicron Particles towards Selective Proteolysis, Depending on Their Surface Hydroxyls</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nano bimetallic oxides as nanoproteases have the great advantages in the heterogeneous hydrolysis of proteins. Here, we report that bimetallic delafossite CuFeO2 submicron particles (CuFeO2 SMPs) display a high protease activity towards selective cleavage of peptide bond involving hydrophobic residue at 25 centidegree. CuFeO2 SMPs have excellent regeneration performance with high structural stability. The strong Lewis acidity of Fe(III)&#160;and the strong nucleophilicity of Cu(I)&#160;bound hydroxyl groups are both necessary for the high protease activity of CuFeO2 SMPs. Low&#8208;valent metal ion has a great advantage in that low&#8208;valent Cu(I)&#160;bound hydroxyl has strong nucleophilicity, resulting in promotion of protein hydrolysis via high&#8208;efficient bimetallic catalysis. This study provides evidence that the protease activity of CuFeO2 SMPs depends on metal ion&#8208;bound hydroxyls on their surface. Our findings highlight that the valence of metal ions in artificial protease and their surface hydroxyls are two important factors that determine their catalytic efficiency.</dc:description>

         <title>Ionomeric Binders for High Temperature Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>High&#8208;temperature proton exchange membrane fuel cell (HT&#8208;PEMFC) based on phosphoric acid doped polybenzimidazole membrane (PBI/PA) operating at 120&#8208;200 &#176;C can provide insensitivity to carbon monoxide (CO) and simplified managements of water and heat and thus attract significant global attention. However, one signi&#64257;cant drawback is its low utilization of precious metal catalysts resulted from the PA poisoning and inefficient three&#8208;phase boundary. Studies of binder materials in catalyst layers for HT&#8208;PEMFC are gradually emerging and there are few literature reviews on this important topic. The purpose of this review is to describe the various types of binders based on their molecular structure and electrochemical properties, with particular emphasis on catalyst layer for fuel cells. Importantly, this review provides a better understanding of relationship between fuel cell performance and the gas permeability and conductivity of different binders. Then, future directions of research and development in binder materials of HT&#8208;PEMFC are pointed out.</dc:description>

         <title>Recovery of Berry Natural Products using Pyrene&#8208;based MOF Solid Phase Extraction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This work introduces a novel method of recovering bioactive berry natural products (BNPs) using solid phase extraction with metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOF&#8208;SPE). Two pyrene&#8208;based MOFs with different structural topologies, Al&#8208;PyrMOF and Zr&#8208;NU&#8208;1000, were evaluated for their ability to capture and desorb BNPs, including ellagic acid, quercetin, gallic acid, and p&#8208;coumaric acid. Time&#8208;dependent BNP uptake via dispersive SPE revealed that NU&#8208;1000 outperformed Al&#8208;PyrMOF in capturing all BNPs. Our findings show NU&#8208;1000 demonstrated a higher and more consistent BNP capture profile, achieving over 90% capture of all BNPs within 36 hours, with only a 9% variation between the most and least effectively captured BNPs. In contrast, Al&#8208;PyrMOF, displayed a staggered uptake profile, with a significant 53% difference in capture efficiency between the most and least effectively captured BNP. However, when a BNP mixture was used at a loading concentration of 50 &#181;g/mL, Al&#8208;PyrMOF outperformed NU&#8208;1000, capturing over 70% of all BNPs. Al&#8208;PyrMOF also exhibited improved BNP recovery, with a minimum of two&#8208;fold greater amount recovered for all BNPs. Further testing with a BNP mixture at a concentration of 15 &#181;g/mL demonstrated that Al&#8208;PyrMOF efficiently concentrated all BNPs, achieving a maximum extraction factor of 2.71 observed for quercetin.</dc:description>

         <title>Conformational Switching of A Nano&#8208;Size Urea&#8208;bridged Zn(II)Porphyrin Dimer by External Stimuli</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>For the first time, explicit stabilization of all the three conformers, viz. (cis,cis), (cis,trans) and (trans,trans), of a &#8216;nano&#8208;sized&#8217; highly&#8208;flexible urea&#8208;bridged Zn(II)porphyrin dimer have been achieved via careful manipulations of external stimuli such as solvent dielectrics, temperature, anionic interactions, axial ligation and surface&#8208;induced stabilization. The conformers differ widely in their structures, chemical and photophysical properties and thus have vast potential applicability. X&#8208;ray structural characterizations have been reported for the (cis,cis) and (cis,trans)&#8208;conformers. While (cis,cis) conformer stabilized exclusively in dichloromethane, more polar solvents resulted in the stabilization of (cis,trans) and (trans,trans)&#8208;conformers. Low temperature promotes the stabilization of (cis,trans)&#8208;conformer while rise in temperature facilitates flipping to the (cis,cis) one. Significantly, exclusive stabilization of the (trans,trans)&#8208;isomer has been illustrated using acetate anion which facilitates H&#8208;bonding with the two amide linkages of the urea spacer. Remarkably, HOPG surface facilitates stabilization of the energetically challenging (trans,trans)&#8208;conformer via CH&#183;&#183;&#183;p and p&#183;&#183;&#183;p interactions with the solid surface to the porphyrinic cores. DFT calculations demonstrate that the relative stability of the conformers can be modulated upon slight external perturbations as also observed in the experiment. Several factors contributing towards the conformational landscape for the highly flexible urea&#8208;bridged porphyrin dimers have been mapped.</dc:description>

         <title>Building 3D Crosslinked Graphene&#8208;MXene Nanoarchitectures Decorated with MoS2 Quantum Dots Enables Efficient Electrocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A robust co&#8208;assembly method is developed to the bottom&#8208;up construction of 3D crosslinked graphene&#8208;MXene nanoarchitectures decorated with MoS2 quantum dots, which possess superior electrocatalytic properties towards the hydrogen evolution reaction.







Abstract
Although MoS2 quantum dots with abundant edge sites have been regarded as promising eletrode materials for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), their electrocatalytic capacity still requires improvements in actual applications. Herein. we demonstrate a controllable and robust bottom&#8208;up approach to build 3D crosslinked graphene&#8208;Ti3C2Tx MXene frameworks decorated with MoS2 quantum dots (MQD/RGO&#8208;MX) via a convenient co&#8208;assembly process. The novel structural design gives the MQD/RGO&#8208;MX nanoarchitectures a series of superior textural attributes, including 3D interconnected networks, continuous meso&#8208; and macropores, well&#8208;dispersed quantum dots, ameliorative electronic configuration, and excellent electrical conductivity. Accordingly, the resulting hybrid nanoarchitectures express superior electrocatalytic properties in terms of a low onset potential of only 45&#8197;mV, a small Tafel slope of 61&#8197;mV&#8201;dec&#8722;1 as well as a long service life towards the HER, which make it quite competitive against bare MoS2 quantum dots, MXene as well as binary MQD/RGO and MQD/MXene electrocatalysts.

&lt;p&gt;A robust co-assembly method is developed to the bottom-up construction of 3D crosslinked graphene-MXene nanoarchitectures decorated with MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; quantum dots, which possess superior electrocatalytic properties towards the hydrogen evolution reaction.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; quantum dots with abundant edge sites have been regarded as promising eletrode materials for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), their electrocatalytic capacity still requires improvements in actual applications. Herein. we demonstrate a controllable and robust bottom-up approach to build 3D crosslinked graphene-Ti&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;T&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; MXene frameworks decorated with MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; quantum dots (MQD/RGO-MX) &lt;i&gt;via&lt;/i&gt; a convenient co-assembly process. The novel structural design gives the MQD/RGO-MX nanoarchitectures a series of superior textural attributes, including 3D interconnected networks, continuous meso- and macropores, well-dispersed quantum dots, ameliorative electronic configuration, and excellent electrical conductivity. Accordingly, the resulting hybrid nanoarchitectures express superior electrocatalytic properties in terms of a low onset potential of only 45&#8197;mV, a small Tafel slope of 61&#8197;mV&#8201;dec&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; as well as a long service life towards the HER, which make it quite competitive against bare MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; quantum dots, MXene as well as binary MQD/RGO and MQD/MXene electrocatalysts.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed Pyridylation of Alkynamides with Pyridylboronic Acids: A Route to Functionalized Enamides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pyridylation of alkynamides with pyridylboronic acids under rhodium catalysis has been developed, providing a practical approach to the stereoselective synthesis of valuable alkenylpyridines with amide group using readily available reagents and a commercial catalyst. Further applications of pyridylation product from Weinreb amide to construct &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated ketone and aldehyde were demonstrated, offering a practical route to synthesizing diverse functionalized alkenylpyridines.







Abstract
The catalytic direct hydroarylation of alkynamides is a highly efficient approach for accessing functionalized trisubstituted arylalkenes with amide groups. Herein, we report a rhodium&#8208;catalyzed pyridylation of alkynamides with pyridylboronic acids, producing a variety of primary, secondary, and tertiary enamides with high yields (up to 94&#8201;%). This reaction demonstrates broad tolerance towards various alkyl and aryl functional groups, providing convenient access to a diverse array of alkenylpyridine derivatives. To demonstrate potential applications in late&#8208;stage hydropyridylation, we synthesized &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated ketones, aldehydes, and esters with high yields from the pyridylation product of Weinreb amides. This indirect expansion of the substrate scope enhances the practicality of this strategy. Additionally, the &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated ketone obtained can be further reduced to yield a chiral alcohol with a 99&#8201;% ee, further demonstrating the versatility and potential utility of this approach.

         <title>Concentration Controlling of Carboxylic Ester&#8208;Based Electrolyte for Low Temperature Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The introduction of moderate concentrations of LiDFOB and FEC has established a solid electrolyte interface rich in LiF. This effectively suppresses side reactions between the electrolyte and lithium metal and promotes the desolvation process of Li+. Li/LCO batteries using this electrolyte exhibit excellent long&#8208;term cycling performance even at &#8722;40&#8201;&#176;C.







Abstract
Low temperature has been a major challenge for lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) to maintain satisfied electrochemical performance, and the main reason is the deactivation of electrolyte with the decreasing temperature. To address this point, in present work, we develop a low&#8208;temperature resistant electrolyte which includes ethyl acetate (EA) and fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC) as solvent and lithium difluoro(oxalato)borate (LiDFOB) as the primary lithium salt. Due to the preferential decomposition of LiDFOB and FEC, a solid electrolyte interface rich in LiF is formed on the lithium metal anodes (LMAs) and lithium cobalt oxide (LCO) cathodes, contributing to higher stability and rapid desolvation of Li+ ions. The batteries with the optimized electrolyte can undergo cycling tests at &#8722;40&#8201;&#176;C, with a capacity retention of 83.9&#8201;% after 200 cycles. Furthermore, the optimized electrolyte exhibits excellent compatibility with both LCO cathodes and graphite (Gr) anodes, enabling a Gr/LCO battery to maintain a capacity retention of 90.3&#8201;% after multiple cycles at &#8722;25&#8201;&#176;C. This work proposes a cost&#8208;effective electrolyte that can activate potential LIBs in practical scenarios, especially in low&#8208;temperature environments.

         <title>Carbon Dots in Photodynamic Therapy: The Role of Dopant and Solvent on Optical and Photo&#8208;Responsive Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Owing to outstanding optical properties and biocompatibility, carbon dots (CDs) have been extensively gaining attention as a photo&#8208;responsive inducer for cancer photodynamic therapy. This review summarizes the synthesis and modification techniques of CDs that offer red&#8208;shift properties toward stronger fluorescence emission and deeper penetration of light&#8208;responsive reactive radical species generated at the laser&#8208;directing site that cause specific cell damage. The strategies summarized in this review could contribute to addressing the challenges in targeted cancer therapy.







Abstract
Carbon dots (CDs) are novel carbon&#8208;based luminescent materials with wide&#8208;ranging applications in biosensing, bioimaging, drug transportation, optical devices, and beyond. Their advantageous attributes, including biocompatibility, biodegradability, antioxidant activity, photostability, small particle size (&lt;10&#8197;nm), and strong light absorption and excitation across a broad range of wavelengths, making them promising candidates in the field of photodynamic therapy (PDT) as photosensitizers (PSs). Further enhancements in functionality are imperative to enhance the effectiveness of CDs in PDT applications, notwithstanding their inherent benefits. Recently, doping agents and solvents have been demonstrated to improve CDs&#8217; optical properties, solubility, cytotoxicity, and organelle targeting efficiency. These improvements result from modifications to the CDs&#8217; carbon skeleton matrices, functional groups on the surface state, and chemical structures. This review discusses the modification of CDs with heteroatom dopants, dye dopants, and solvents to improve their physicochemical and optical properties for PDT applications. The correlations between the surface chemistry, functional groups, the structure of the CDs, and their optical characteristics toward quantum yield, redshift feature, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, have also been discussed. Finally, the progressive trends for the use of CDs in PDT applications are also addressed in this review.

         <title>A Data&#8208;Driven Approach for Enhanced CO2 Capture with Ruthenium Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel Ru catalysts in the hydrogenation of CO2 are not easily obtained through simple ligand modification. However, adopting an active descriptor that is obtained from the simplified mechanism&#8208;based approach with data&#8208;driven practice (SMADP) is demonstrated as an efficient strategy to understand the catalytic activity.







Abstract
To attain carbon neutrality, significant efforts have been made to capture and utilize CO2. The homogeneous hydrogenation of CO2 catalyzed by transition metal complexes, particularly the ruthenium complexes, has demonstrated significant advantages and is regarded as a viable approach for practical application. Insertion of CO2 into the Ru&#8722;H bond, producing the Ru&#8208;formate product, is the key step in the hydrogenation of CO2. In order to parameterize the catalytic activities in the CO2 insertion into the Ru&#8722;H bond, the concept of simplified mechanism&#8208;based approach with data&#8208;driven practice (SMADP) has been introduced in this paper. The results showed that the hydricity of the Ru&#8722;H complex (&#916;GH&#8208;) might serve as a single active descriptor in the process of CO2 insertion, and that a novel ruthenium complex in CO2 catalysis may not be easily obtained by mere modification of the auxiliary ligand at the ruthenium metal site.

Using charge fluctuation descriptors, the intrinsic reaction coordinate is partitioned into three regions which are called Pre&#8208;TS, TS and Post&#8208;TS respectively. For 37 organic and inorganic reactions, linear correlations are found within the three regions between the total energy difference and the steric or charge transfer descriptors. The use of charge fluctuation instead of global reactivity descriptors gives clearer separation of the reaction path which is further justified via energy decomposition analysis.







Abstract
Appreciating reactivity in terms of physicochemical effects for chemical processes is one of the most important undertakings in chemistry. While transition state (TS) theory provides the framework enabling the reliable calculation of the barrier height for a given elementary step, analytical tools are necessary to gain insight into key factors governing the different processes during chemical reactions. In this contribution, we partition the potential energy surface of an elementary step along the intrinsic coordinate into three segments, the so&#8208;called Pre&#8208;TS, TS, and Post&#8208;TS regions, and then determine the most important factors dictating each segment. This analysis is based on the use of both reactivity descriptors from conceptual density functional theory and concepts from the information&#8208;theoretic approach in density functional theory. We found that in both Pre&#8208;TS and Post&#8208;TS regions, steric effects are the dominant factors, whereas in the TS region, it is the intrinsic electrophilic and nucleophilic propensity of the transition state structure that governs the reactivity. The wide applicability of our approach is shown by a validation for a total of 37 organic and inorganic reactions. Different partition approaches from density functional theory, energy decomposition analysis and wavefunction&#8208;based resonance theory are employed to support our main conclusions.

         <title>Symmetric Aromatic Amidoalkylations of Triphenylenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient amidoalkylation method of triphenylene derivatives is reported leading to tris&#8208;alkylated C3&#8208;symmetric compounds in good yields. The reaction takes place in the hindered bay regions of the compound for which very few functionalization methods are known in the literature.







Abstract
Triphenylene derivatives are highly investigated for their electronic, supramolecular and photophysical properties, but the direct modification of the central aromatic core is particularly challenging especially in the internal positions 1, 4, 5, 8, 9, and 12. Herein we present an efficient alkylation method of 2,3,6,7,10,11&#8208;hexasubstituted triphenylene derivatives leading to tris&#8208;alkylated C3&#8208;symmetric derivatives in good yields using N&#8208;(hydroxymethyl)carboxamide or N&#8208;(alkoxylmethyl)carboxamide alkylating agents.

         <title>Unlocking Selective Anticancer Mechanisms: Dinuclear Manganese Superoxide Dismutase Mimetics Combined with Pt(II) Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dinuclear manganese complexes (Mn2), known for their SOD and CAT mimetic properties, enhance healthy breast cell viability by up to 50&#8201;% and reduce breast cancer cell viability by up to 50&#8201;% when combined with Pt(II) complexes. These Mn2&#8208;containing formulations primarily target mitochondrial processes, affecting cancerous and healthy cells differently. This suggests their potential use for combined SOD&#8208;active and cytostatic treatments.







Abstract
We conducted an in&#8208;depth exploration of the in&#8197;vitro activities of the dinuclear Mn2L2Ac and Mn2L2 complexes (where HL=2&#8208;{[di(2&#8208;pyridyl)methylamino]&#8208;methyl}phenol), possessing dual superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) activity.
We investigated these complexes both individually and in conjunction with various Pt(II)&#8208;complexes, either as mixtures or as the Mn2&#8208;Pt adducts. Our findings revealed a notable up to 50&#8201;% enhancement in the viability of healthy human breast cells, contrasted with a viability decrease as low as 50&#8201;% in breast cancer cells upon combined treatments with Mn2 SOD mimics and Pt(II) complexes. Specifically, we synthesized and characterized the self&#8208;assembled Mn2&#8208;Pt adducts (isolated Mn2L2Pt and in&#8197;situ Mn2L2Pt&#8217;), linking Mn2L2&#8208;core with the carboxylate group of PtDAPCl2 (dichloro(2,3&#8208;diaminopropionic acid) platinum(II)). The SOD activity of the isolated Mn2L2Pt adduct (kSOD=1.7&#215;107&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1) remained intact. Through in vitro cell viability assessments, ROS levels, cellular Mn uptake and proteomics measurements, we elucidated key mechanisms underlying the observed biological effects. We demonstrated that Mn2&#8208;containing formulations predominantly target mitochondrial processes, differently affecting the proteome of cancerous and healthy cells. They induced downregulation of H2S signaling and expression of mitochondrial complex I and III, as well as increased oxidative phosphorylation pathways and upregulation of EGFR in cancer cells. In contrast, healthy cells showed a decrease in EGFR expression and a moderate enrichment in oxidative phosphorylation pathways.

         <title>Helix&#8208;to&#8208;Disc Conversion of Thia[6]helicenes into Coronenes Facilitated by Sulfur Oxidation and Fluorination</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sulfur oxidation and terminal tetrafluorination successfully transforms helical thia[6]helicene into disc&#8208;like 1,2&#8208;difluorocoronene, whose unique columnar stacking structure was confirmed by X&#8208;ray crystallography. This skeletal transformation, initiated by an intramolecular Diels&#8211;Alder reaction, demonstrates how strategic chemical modifications can reconfigure the molecular architectures of polycyclic aromatics.







Abstract
Helicenes, with their unique helical structures, have long captured the interest of synthetic chemists, not only as end products, but also as versatile platforms for further chemical transformations. However, transforming [6]helicene into planar coronene typically requires harsh conditions and poses significant challenges. Herein, we demonstrate that replacing the terminal benzene ring of [6]helicene with a thiophene ring enables its photochemical transformation into coronene. Sulfur oxidation of the thiophene ring enables the corresponding thermal transformation, and the terminal tetrafluorination of the opposite benzene ring further accelerates this process, yielding 1,2&#8208;difluorocoronene, as confirmed by X&#8208;ray crystallography. The transformation begins with an intramolecular Diels&#8211;Alder reaction, whose activation energy is significantly lowered by these structural changes. Our findings underscore the utility of strategic modifications such as sulfur oxidation and fluorination in promoting this &#8220;helix&#8208;to&#8208;disc&#8221; conversion and opening new avenues for synthesizing functional polycyclic aromatics.

         <title>N&#8208;Glycosylation&#8208;Induced Pathologic Protein Conformations as a Tool to Guide the Selection of Biologically Active Small Molecules</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An atomistic model for the prediction of ligand residence times in protein targets, taking explicitly into account normal vs. pathologic conformations of chaperone Grp94, is developed and tested. Analysis of binding site and ligand stereoelectronic properties unveils relationships between chemical, conformational properties, and biological activities of ligands. These findings facilitate the design of ligands targeting pathologic Grp94 conformations.







Abstract
Post&#8208;translational modifications such as protein N&#8208;glycosylation, significantly influence cellular processes. Dysregulated N&#8208;glycosylation, exemplified in Grp94, a member of the Hsp90 family, leads to structural changes and the formation of epichaperomes, contributing to pathologies. Targeting N&#8208;glycosylation&#8208;induced conformations offers opportunities for developing selective chemical tools and drugs for these pathologic forms of chaperones. We here demonstrate how a specific Grp94 conformation induced by N&#8208;glycosylation, identified previously via molecular dynamics simulations, rationalizes the distinct behavior of similar ligands. Integrating dynamic ligand unbinding information with SAR development, we differentiate ligands productively engaging the pathologic Grp94 conformers from those that are not. Additionally, analyzing binding site stereoelectronic properties and QSAR models using cytotoxicity data unveils relationships between chemical, conformational properties, and biological activities. These findings facilitate the design of ligands targeting specific Grp94 conformations induced by abnormal glycosylation, selectively disrupting pathogenic protein networks while sparing normal mechanisms.

         <title>Dimethylene&#8208;Cyclopropanide Units as Building Blocks for Fluorescence Dyes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The dimethylene&#8208;cyclopropanide moiety is used as key scaffold for the design of fluorescent dyes which emit light in solution and in solids. In particular, malonic ester groups induce a remarkable twist angle of about 20&#176; between a pyridinium substituent and the cyclopropanide plane, resulting in enhanced light emission in solids.







Abstract
Many organic dyes are fluorescent in solution. In the solid state, however, quenching processes often dominate, hampering material science applications such as light filters, light&#8208;emitting devices, or coding tags. We show that the dimethylene&#8208;cyclopropanide scaffold can be used to form two structurally different types of chromophores, which feature fluorescence quantum yields up to 0.66 in dimethyl sulfoxide and 0.53 in solids. The increased fluorescence in the solid state for compounds bearing malonate substituents instead of dicyanomethide ones is rationalized by the induced twist between the planes of the cyclopropanide core and a pyridine ligand.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Terpenoid dimers of the [4+2] type, which are naturally occurring compounds biosynthetically derived from the [4+2] cycloaddition of two synthons, have garnered considerable attention due to their complex molecular structures, diverse biological activities, and intriguing biosynthetic pathways. We have previously summarized the advancements in three types of [4+2] terpenoid dimers. In this review, we will focus on the lesser&#8208;explored class of [4+2] terpenoid dimers which assembled from two electron&#8208;deficient synthons via the unmatched&#8208;electron&#8208;demand Diels&#8208;Alder reaction&#160; (UMEDDA). We will summarize their sources, biological activities, proposed biosynthesis, and chemical syntheses.

         <title>Acid&#8208;catalyzed Transformation of Nitrite to Nitric Oxide on Copper(II)&#8722;Cobalt(II) Centers in a Bimetallic Complex</title>

Acid&#8208;induced reduction of &#951;2&#8208;bound NO2&#8722; to NO(g) on CoII&#8722;CoII centers in a hetero&#8208;bimetallic CuII&#8208;nitrito&#8208;CoII complex, [(LN8H)CuII&#8722;NO2&#8722;&#8722;CoII]3+ (CuII&#8722;NO2&#8722;&#8722;CoII) bearing an octadentate N8&#8208;cryptand ligand (LN8H) via a proposed nitrous acid [(LN8H)CuII&#8722;ONOH&#8722;CoII]4+ ([Cu(ONOH)Co]+4) intermediate species.







Abstract
Nitrite (NO2&#8722;) serves as a pool of nitric oxide (NO) in biological systems under hypoxic conditions, and it is transformed to NO by nitrite reductase (NiR) enzyme in the presence of acid (H+ ions). However, NO synthases (NOSs) generate NO via L&#8208;arginine oxidation in normoxic conditions. Previously, acid&#8208;induced NO2&#8722; reduction chemistry was modeled on mono&#8208;metallic 3d&#8208;metals, generating metal&#8208;nitrosyls or NO(g) with H2O or H2O2 products. Herein, to understand the relative potency of a bimetallic system, we report the acid&#8208;induced reductive conversion of &#951;2&#8208;bound NO2&#8722; to NO on CuII&#8722;CoII centers of a hetero&#8208;bimetallic CuII&#8208;nitrito&#8208;CoII complex, [(LN8H)CuII&#8722;NO2&#8722;&#8722;CoII]3+ (CuII&#8722;NO2&#8722;&#8722;CoII, 2) bearing an octadentate N8&#8208;cryptand ligand (LN8H). The CuII&#8722;NO2&#8722;&#8722;CoII generates [CuII(LN8H)CoII]4+ (1) upon reaction with one equiv. acid (HClO4, H+ ions source) with NO(g) via a presumed transient nitrousacid (ONOH) intermediate species. Likewise, this NO2&#8722; reduction was found to form H2O, which is believed to be from the decomposition of H2O2, an intermediate species. In addition, complex 2, in the presence of more than one equiv. H+ ions also showed the formation of NO(g) with H2O. Mechanistic investigations, using 15N&#8208;labeled&#8208;15NO2&#8722;, 18O&#8208;labeled&#8208;18O14N16O&#8722; and 2H&#8208;labeled&#8208;DClO4 (D+ source), revealed that the N&#8208;atom and O&#8208;atom in the 14/15NO and 14N18O gases are derived from NO2&#8722; ligand and H&#8208;atom in H2O derived from H+&#8208;source, respectively.

         <title>A Review of Electrospun Carbon&#8208;Based Nanofibers Materials used in Lithium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrospun carbon&#8208;based nanofibers materials have characteristics such as high electronic conductivity, large specific surface area, and good flexibility. This article reviews representative research results of different types of CNF (with various pore structures, heteroatoms, metallic compounds, and other substances) as sulfur hosts and interlayer materials to improve the performance of lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries.







Abstract
Commercial lithium&#8208;ion batteries are gradually approaching their theoretical specific energy, which cannot meet the fast&#8208;growing energy storage demands. Lithium&#8208;sulfur (Li&#8722;S) batteries are anticipated to supersede lithium&#8208;ion batteries as the next&#8208;generation energy storage system owing to their high atheoretical specific capacity (1675&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1) and energy density (2600&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1). Nonetheless, Li&#8722;S batteries encounter several challenges, including the inadequate conductivity of sulfur and lithium sulfide, sulfur's volume expansion, and the shuttle effect of lithium polysulfides, all of which significantly impact the practical utilization of Li&#8722;S batteries. Electrospun carbon&#8208;based nanofibers can simultaneously resolve these issues with their economical preparation, distinctive nanostructure, and exceptional flexibility. This review presents the most recent research findings on electrospun carbon&#8208;based nanofibers materials serving as sulfur hosts and interlayer components in Li&#8722;S batteries. We analyzed the impact of the material's structural design on the performance of Li&#8722;S batteries and the relative underlying mechanism. Finally, the current challenges and issues faced by carbon&#8208;based nanofibers composites in the application of Li&#8722;S batteries are summarized, and the future development trajectory are outlined.

         <title>Halogen and Chalcogen Activation by Nucleophilic Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Catalytic halogen activation has seen substantial transformation in the last several years. The ability to selectively and efficiently activate halogen functionalities through nucleophilic catalysis holds promise for enhancing reaction specificity, selectivity, and sustainability. This review will outline important nucleophilic activators that have been employed for halogen activation and describes their mode of action.







Abstract
The high utility of halogenated organic compounds has prompted the development of numerous transformations that install the carbon&#8208;halogen motif. Halogen functionalities, deemed as &#8220;functional and functionalizable&#8221; molecules due to their capacity to modulate diverse internal properties, constitute a pivotal strategy in drug discovery and development. Traditional routes to these building blocks have commonly involved multiple steps, harsh reaction conditions, and the use of stoichiometric and/or toxic reagents. With the emergence of solid halogen carriers such as N&#8208;halosuccinimides, and halohydantoins as popular sources of halonium ions, the past decade has witnessed enormous growth in the development of new catalytic strategies for halofunctionalization. This review aims to provide a nuanced perspective on nucleophilic activators and their roles in halogen activation. It will highlight critical discoveries in effecting racemic and asymmetric variants of these reactions, driven by the development of new catalysts, activation modes, and improved understanding of chemical reactivity and reaction kinetics.

         <title>Binary Catalytic Hydrogen/Deuterium Exchange of Free &#945;&#8208;Amino Acids and Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
&#945;&#8208;Deuterated products with up to 91&#8201;% yield and up to 100&#8201;% D incorp. were obtained in H/D exchange reaction of free amino acids and derivatives (esters or amides) in the presence of inexpensive D2O using a binary catalysis system containing benzaldehyde and Cs2CO3 or phenylalanine Cs&#8208;salt.







Abstract
The increasing demand for deuterium&#8208;labeled amino acids and derivatives has heightened interest in direct hydrogen/deuterium exchange reactions of free amino acids. Existing methods, including biocatalysis and metal catalysis, typically require expensive deuterium sources or excessive use of deuterium reagents and often struggle with site selectivity. In contrast, this binary catalysis system, employing benzaldehyde and Cs2CO3 in the presence of inexpensive D2O with minimal stoichiometric quantities, facilitates efficient hydrogen/deuterium exchange at the &#945;&#8208;position of amino acids without the need for protecting groups in the polar aprotic solvent DMSO. The process is highly compatible with most natural and non&#8208;natural &#945;&#8208;amino acids and derivatives, even those with potentially reactive functionalities. This advancement not only addresses the cost and efficiency concerns of existing methods but also significantly broadens the applicability and precision of deuterium labeling in biochemical research.

         <title>Investigating the Catalytic Site of Human 15&#8208;Lipoxygenase&#8208;1&#8201;via Marine Natural Products</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>

Human 15&#8208;lipoxygenase&#8208;1 is an enzyme with a key role in various diseases. We developed a library of chiral smart molecules to explore, navigate and inhibit this enzyme, integrating specific structural elements from marine&#8208;derived natural product phosphoeleganin (PE) and synthetic fragment derivatives. These PE&#8208;based inhibitors exhibit time&#8208;dependent inhibition and varying potency based on stereochemistry and warhead positioning.







Abstract
Human 15&#8208;lipoxygenase&#8208;1 (15&#8208;LOX&#8208;1) is a key enzyme that possesses an important role in (neuro)inflammatory diseases. The pocket of the enzyme plays the role of a chiral catalyst, and therefore chirality could be an important component for the design of effective enzyme inhibitors. To advance our knowledge on this concept, we developed a library of the identified chiral 15&#8208;LOX&#8208;1 inhibitors and applied cheminformatic tools. Our analysis highlighted specific structural elements, which we integrated them in small molecules, and employed them as &#8220;smart&#8221; tools to effectively navigate the chemical space of previously unexplored regions. To this purpose, we utilized the marine derived natural product phosphoeleganin (PE) among with a small library of synthetic fragment derivatives, including a certain degree of stereochemical diversity. Enzyme inhibition/kinetic and molecular modelling studies has been performed in order to characterize structurally novel PE&#8208;based inhibitors, which proved to present a different type of inhibition with low micromolar potency, according to their structural features. We demonstrate that different warheads work as anchor, and either guide specific stereochemistry, or causing a time&#8208;depended inhibition. Finally, we prove that the positioning of the chiral substituents or/and the favorable stereochemistry can be crucial, as it can lead from active to completely inactive compounds.

         <title>Gold Trifluoromethyl Complexes as Efficient Regioselective Catalysts in Alkyne Hydration</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Easy&#8208;access gold (III) complexes containing three trifluoromethyl and a labile ligand (MeCN or THT) are efficient catalysts in hydration of terminal and internal alkynes. The gold fragment &#8220;(CF3)3Au&#8221; induces moderate to notable regioselectivities in hydration of internal asymmetric alkynes.







Abstract
Gold(III) complexes containing trifluoromethyl ligands are efficient catalysts in the hydration of alkynes, operating at low catalyst loadings, without additives, using environmentally friendly solvents and at mild conditions (60&#8201;&#176;C). Hydration of terminal and internal alkynes provides the corresponding ketones in quantitative yields without special precautions as dry solvents or inert atmospheres. Remarkably, hydration of asymmetric internal alkynes proceeds with moderate to notable regioselectivities, providing mixtures of the two possible isomers with ratios up to 90&#8201;:&#8201;10.

         <title>Synthesis and Reactivity of Masked Organic Sulfates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Although nature presents unique sulfated endobiotics (e.&#8201;g., sulfated glycosaminoglycans, sulfated tyrosine peptides, sulfated steroids/bile acids/catecholamines, etc.) that are antithrombotic, antimicrobial, and/or anticancer in action, major hurdles exist in their synthesis. This review focuses on synthetic masking/unmasking strategies that can help realize highly sulfated molecules as drugs.







Abstract
Nature offers a variety of structurally unique, sulfated endobiotics including sulfated glycosaminoglycans, sulfated tyrosine peptides, sulfated steroids/bile acids/catecholamines. Sulfated molecules display a large number of biological activities including antithrombotic, antimicrobial, anticancer, anti&#8208;inflammatory, and others, which arise from modulation of intracellular signaling and enhanced in&#8197;vivo retention of certain hormones. These characteristics position sulfated molecules very favorably as drug&#8208;like agents. However, few have reached the clinic. Major hurdles exist in realizing sulfated molecules as drugs. This state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art has been transformed through recent works on the development of sulfate masking technologies for both alkyl (sulfated carbohydrates, sulfated steroids) and aryl (sTyr&#8208;bearing peptides/proteins, sulfated flavonoids) sulfates. This review compiles the literature on different strategies implemented for different types of sulfate groups. Starting from early efforts in protection of sulfate groups to the design of newer SuFEx, trichloroethyl, and gem&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;based protection technologies, this review presents the evolution and application of concepts in realizing highly diverse, sulfated molecules as candidate drugs and/or prodrugs. Overall, the newer strategies for sulfate masking and demasking are likely to greatly enhance the design and development of sulfated molecules as non&#8208;toxic drugs of the future.

A Leishmania promastigote has immunologically important lipophosphoglycans (LPGs) on its surface and LPGs contain characteristic [&#8594;6)&#8208;&#946;&#8208;D&#8208;Gal&#8208;(1&#8594;4)&#8208;&#945;&#8208;D&#8208;Man&#8208;(1&#8208;PO3H] repeating units. In this study, the repeating structure was synthesized up to a triacontasaccharide derivative for the first&#8208;time using disaccharide &#945;&#8208;1&#8208;phosphoramidite derivative as a building block. The length of the product is comparable to that of a Leishmania promastigote LPGs.







Abstract
Lipophosphoglycans (LPGs) are found on the surface of Leishmania, a protozoan parasite, and are immunologically important. Herein, disaccharide 1&#8208;phosphate repeating units of LPGs were successfully synthesized on a solid support with high anomeric purity using a disaccharide &#945;&#8208;1&#8208;phosphoramidite building block. To enhance solubility in the reaction solvent, hydroxy&#8208;protecting groups in the form of para&#8208;t&#8208;butylbenzoyl were introduced to the building block. The saccharide chain was elongated via stable glycosyl boranophosphate linkages, followed by the conversion of inter&#8208;sugar linkages to phosphodiester counterparts using an oxaziridine derivative. The addition of a silylating reagent post&#8208;reaction with the oxaziridine derivative efficiently facilitated the conversion of boranophosohodiesters to phosphodiesters. This method enabled the &#945;&#8208;selective synthesis of up to 15 repeating units, marking the longest homogeneous repeating units of LPGs synthesized chemically. Given the chain length equivalence to native LPGs, the method developed herein holds promise for advancing anti&#8208;Leishmanial pharmaceuticals and vaccines.

         <title>Highly Selective Boron&#8208;Wittig Reaction: A Practical Method to Synthesize Trans&#8208;Aryl Alkenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly selective Boron&#8208;Wittig reaction for trans&#8208;alkenes has been developed, offering a practical pathway to access diverse trans&#8208;alkenes from readily available carbonyl compounds.







Abstract
Olefins play an essential role in synthetic chemistry, serving not only as important synthons but also as key functional groups in numerous bio&#8208;active molecules. Consequently, there has been considerable interest in the development of more powerful methods for olefins. While the Wittig reaction stands as a prominent choice for olefin synthesis due to its simplicity and the ready availability of raw materials, its limitation lies in the challenge of controlling cis&#8208;trans selectivity, hampering its broader application. In this study, a novel Boron&#8208;Wittig reaction has been developed utilizing gem&#8208;bis(boryl)alkanes and aldehydes as starting materials. This method enables creating favourable intermediates, which possess less steric hindrance, and leading to trans&#8208;olefins via intramolecular O&#8722;B bonds elimination. Notably, synthesis studies have validated its good efficacy in modifying bioactive molecules and synthesizing drug molecules with great trans&#8208;selectivity. Furthermore, the reaction mechanism was elucidated based on intermediate trapping experiments, isotope labelling studies, and kinetic analyses.

         <title>A New Structural Motif in Aggregation of Methylalumoxanes: Non&#8208;Hydrolytic Route by the Alkylation of Dicarboxylic Acids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, we report the first systematic studies on the alkylation of dicarboxylic acids by AlMe3 that, passing through the double methylation of each carboxylic group, allowed for the isolation and structural characterisation of a family of methylalumoxanes incorporating neutral Me10Al6O4 scaffold flanked by methylaluminium diolate units.







Abstract
Alumoxanes are typically produced via controlled hydrolysis of short&#8208;chain alkyl aluminium compounds which leads to oligomeric species that are usually difficult to obtain in crystalline form. Simultaneously, various alternative non&#8208;hydrolytic approaches to alumoxanes have also been used. In this work, we report on a new methylalumoxane scaffold derived from the alkylation of a series of dicarboxylic acids: itaconic acid (HO2CCH2C(=CH2)CO2H), succinic acid (HO2CCH2CH2CO2H) and homophthalic acid (HO2CCH2C6H4CO2H). The reactions of AlMe3 with a selected dicarboxylic acid in the molar ratio 4&#8201;:&#8201;1 conducted at elevated temperature occur with double methylation of each carboxylic group and provide to the formation of a new methylalumoxane aggregate, Me10Al6O4, flanked by methylaluminium diolate units. We also aimed to obtain dialkylaluminium derivatives of dicarboxylic acids by the controlled reaction of the appropriate acid with AlMe3 in the 1&#8201;:&#8201;2 stoichiometry. While the synthesis of organoaluminium derivatives of flexible aliphatic dicarboxylic acids (itaconic and succinic acids) is challenging due to their insolubility, the related homophtalate compound readily forms a molecular tetranuclear cluster, [([(O2CCH2C6H4CO2)(&#956;&#8208;AlMe2)2]2. The molecular and crystal structures of the resulting compounds were determined via NMR spectroscopic analysis and single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction crystallography.

         <title>Transition Metal Complexes with Appended Benzimidazole Groups for Sensing Dihydrogenphosphate</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The anion recognition behaviour of several emissive metal complexes, with appended benzimidazole groups, is discussed. These show a selective response to both acetate and dihydrogen phosphate: with acetate these complexes appear to adopt a simple one to one adduct, but with dihydrogenphosphate several binding modes are evident dependant on the steric influence of the complex, and the solvent environment.







Abstract
Four new complexes [Ru(bpy)2(bbib)](PF6)2, [Ru(phen)2(bbib)](PF6)2, [Re(CO)3(bbib)(py)](PF6) and [Ir(ppy)2(bbib)](PF6) [where bbib=4,4&#8242;&#8208;bis(benzimidazol&#8208;2&#8208;yl)&#8208;2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine] have been prepared and their photophysical properties determined. Their behaviour has been studied with a variety of anions in acetonitrile, DMSO and 10&#8201;% aquated DMSO. Acetate and dihydrogenphosphate demonstrate a redshift in the bbib ligand associated absorptions suggesting that the ligand is strongly interacting with these anions. The 3MLCT emissive state is sensitive to the introduction of small quantities of anion (sub&#8208;stoichiometric quantities) and significant quenching is typically observed with acetate, although this is less pronounced in the presence of water. The emissive behaviour with dihydrogenphosphate is variable, showing systematic changes as anion concentration increases with several distinct interactions evident. 1H&#8208; and 31P&#8208;NMR titrations in a 10&#8201;% D2O&#8722;DMSO&#8208;D6 mixture suggest that with dihydrogenphosphate, the imidazole group is able to act as both a proton acceptor and donor. It appears that all four complexes can form a {[complex]2&#8208;H2PO4} &#8220;dimer&#8221;, a one&#8208;to&#8208;one species (which the X&#8208;ray crystallography study suggests is dimeric in the solid&#8208;state), and a complex with a combined bis(dihydrogenphosphate) complex anion. The speciation relies on complex equilibria dependent on several factors including the complex charge, the hydrophobicity of the associated ligands, and the solvent.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
CaLi2PN3 was synthesized under MP conditions and analyzed by SCXRD, EDX and MAS NMR. Beside an established bottom&#8208;up approach, we present a novel double salt approach, starting from pre&#8208;synthesized nitridophosphate&#8208;precursors. DFT calculations provide insights into the band structure and the relative stability to the used precursors. This new approach represents a promising addition to the synthesis strategies in nitridophosphate chemistry.

Nitridophosphates are in the focus of current research interest due to their structural versatility and properties, such as ion conductivity, ultra&#8208;incompressibility and luminescent properties when doped with suitable activator ions. Multinary representatives often require thorough investigation due to the competition with the thermodynamically more stable binary and ternary compounds. Another point of concern is the synthetic control of structural details, which is usually limited by conventional bottom&#8208;up syntheses. In this study, we report on the synthesis and characterization of the quaternary nitridophosphate CaLi2PN3. Various synthesis protocols were used for the preparation of CaLi2PN3, including the novel nitridophosphate double salt approach. The crystal structure was solved and refined from single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction data and confirmed by Rietveld refinement, solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy, EDX measurements and low&#8208;cost crystallographic calculations. The experimental results were corroborated by DFT calculations, which revealed the electronic band structure. Formation energy calculations allowed conclusions to be drawn about the stability in comparison to the initial ternary nitridophosphates. The synthesis of CaLi2PN3 exemplifies the enormous potential of medium&#8208;pressure syntheses in the field of nitridophosphate research. Furthermore, the presented new synthesis route allows a certain degree of structural control, which is a promising addition to previous synthesis strategies in nitridophosphate chemistry.

&lt;p&gt;CaLi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;PN&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; was synthesized under MP conditions and analyzed by SCXRD, EDX and MAS NMR. Beside an established bottom-up approach, we present a novel double salt approach, starting from pre-synthesized nitridophosphate-precursors. DFT calculations provide insights into the band structure and the relative stability to the used precursors.

         <title>DNA Molecular Glue Assisted Bacterial Conjugative Transfer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bacterial conjugation, a widely used method to transfer DNA from the donor to the recipient strains, shows a very low efficiency with the current method. A new technique that employed DNA molecule &#8220;glue&#8221; to connect the donor and recipient bacteria to address this issue has been realized for the first time here, mechanistically different from the reported method of using nanomaterials, exploring a new field for the applications of DNA nanotechnology.







Abstract
Bacterial conjugation, a commonly used method to horizontally transfer functional genes from donor to recipient strains, plays an important role in the genetic manipulation of bacteria for basic research and industrial production. Successful conjugation depends on the donor&#8208;recipient cell recognition and a tight mating junction formation. However, the efficiency of conjugative transfer is usually very low. In this work, we developed a new technique that employed DNA molecule &#8220;glue&#8221; to increase the match frequency and the interaction stability between the donor and recipient cells. We used two E. coli strains, ETZ and BL21, as a model system, and modified them with the complementary ssDNA oligonucleotides by click chemistry. The conjugation efficiency of the modified bacteria was improved more than 4 times from 10&#8201;%&#8211;46&#8201;%. This technique is simple and generalizable as it only relies on the active amino groups on the bacterial surface. It is expected to have broad applications in constructing engineered bacteria.

         <title>Aliphatic Ketone Claisen Rearrangement: Troubleshooting the Transetherification Step by Identifying a Stable Acid Catalyst</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple catalyst for the ketone Claisen rearrangement. By optimizing the benzoic acid catalysts for the Claisen rearrangement sequence that starts with allylic alcohols and enol ethers or ketone acetals, 4&#8208;chlorobenzoic acid catalyst emerged as a catalyst that retains its activity in the process. This catalyst enables ketone Claisen reactions with even acid&#8208; and heat&#8208;sensitive protecting groups, such as tert&#8208;butoxycarbonylamines (BocNH), or tert&#8208;butyldimethylsilyl (TBDMS) ethers.







Abstract
After optimization for retention of catalytic activity, 4&#8208;chlorobenzoic acid emerged as the optimal catalyst for the aliphatic ketone Claisen rearrangement. The optimal catalyst enables a one&#8208;pot, metal&#8208;free, catalytic protocol from allylic alcohols to &#947;,&#948;&#8208;unsaturated ketones. The optimized process tolerates a range of substrates, including substituents with acid&#8208;labile protecting groups. Reaction monitoring and DFT studies of the aliphatic ketone Claisen process agree that the ultimate rearrangement step typically has the highest activation barrier.

         <title>Hydrazone&#8208;Linked Donor&#8208;Acceptor Covalent Organic Polymer as a Heterogeneous Photocatalyst for C&#8722;S Bond Formation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present a novel hydrazone&#8208;linked donor&#8208;acceptor covalent organic polymer ETBC&#8208;PyHz, as an efficient photocatalyst for an oxidative cross&#8208;coupling reaction involving C&#8722;S bond formation. This environment&#8208;friendly method does not require a metal&#8208;based catalyst and does not generate side products.







Abstract
In the realm of solar energy utilization, there is a growing focus on designing and implementing effective photocatalytic systems, for the conversion of solar energy into valuable chemical fuels. The potential of Covalent Organic Polymers (COPs) as photocatalysts for visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven organic transformation has been widely investigated, positioning them as promising candidates in this field. In the design of COPs, introducing a donor&#8208;acceptor arrangement facilitates the transfer of electrons from the donor to the acceptor, creating a charge transfer complex and leading to enhanced conductivity and improved charge separation. Here we present a novel hydrazone&#8208;linked covalent organic polymer ETBC&#8208;PyHz containing TPE donor and pyridine acceptor. Utilizing this, an efficient method has been developed for an oxidative cross&#8208;coupling reaction involving C&#8722;S bond formation. This process involves arylhydrazines and arenethiols, and results in the production of unsymmetrical diaryl sulfides via the formation of aryl and thioarene radicals. This conversion holds significant importance because the byproducts produced during the process are nitrogen and water, making it environmentally benign.

         <title>Amorphous Strategy and Doping Copper on Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Surface for Enhanced Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction to C2H4</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Amorphous MOF was prepared by using the regulator, which significantly improved the carrier separation efficiency and the selectivity of multi&#8208;electron products. The addition of surfactants effectively alleviates the agglomeration of MOF, further improve the carrier separation efficiency and promote the formation of ethylene products. Finally, copper doping and amorphous MOF cooperate to improve the yield of ethylene products.







Abstract
Amorphous photocatalysts are characterized by numerous grain boundaries and abundant unsaturated sites, which enhance reaction efficiency from both kinetic and thermodynamic perspectives. However, amorphization strategies have rarely been used for photocatalytic CO2 reduction. Doping copper onto a metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) surface can regulate the electronic structure of photocatalysts, promote electron transfer from the MOF to Cu, and improve the separation efficiency of electron&#8208;hole pairs. In this study, an amorphous photocatalyst MOFw&#8208;p/Cu containing highly dispersed Cu (0, I, II) sites was designed and synthesized by introducing a regulator and in&#8197;situ copper species during the nucleation process of MOF (UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2). Various characterizations confirmed that the Cu species were anchored to the organometallic skeleton of the surface amorphization MOF structure. The synergistic effect of Cu doping and surface amorphization in MOFw&#8208;p/Cu can significantly enhance the CO and CH4 yields while promoting the formation of the multicarbon product C2H4. The approach holds promise for developing novel, highly efficient MOFs as photocatalysts for CO2 photoreduction, enabling the production of high&#8208;value&#8208;added C2 products.

Lanthanide MOFs ([Eu0.1Tb0.9(hfa)3(dpa)]n) are composed of lanthanide luminophores (Eu(III) and/or Tb(III) ions), fluorinated antenna ligands (hfa: hexafluoroacetylacetonate), and polyamide&#8208;type linker ligands (dpa: 4&#8208;(diphenylphosphoryl)&#8208;N&#8208;(4&#8208;(diphenylphosphoryl)phenyl)benzamide). The cylindrical structure was characterized by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray analysis, thermogravimetric analysis, and gas adsorption measurements. The inner surfaces of the cylindrical channels were covered with the fluorine atoms of the hfa ligands. The emission intensity ratio (IEu / ITb) in [Eu0.1Tb0.9(hfa)3(dpa)]n is affected by the CO2 gas adsorption behavior. The change in IEu / ITb value was caused by the intermolecular interactions between the CO2 gas molecules and the fluorinated ligands, resulting in an electronic structural change of the lowest triplet excited state in the photosensitized hfa ligands.</dc:description>

         <title>Controlling the Helical Pitch of Foldamers Through Terminal Functionality: A Solid State Study</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing new methods to control the size and shape of the helical structures adopted by foldamers is highly important as the secondary structure displayed by these supramolecular scaffolds often dictates their activity and function. Herein, we report on a systematic study demonstrating that the helical pitch of ortho&#8208;azobenzene/2,6&#8208;pyridyldicarboamide foldamers can be readily controlled through the nature of the terminal functionality. Remarkably, simply through varying the end group of the foldamer, and without modifying any other structural features of the scaffold, the helical pitch can be over doubled in magnitude (from 3.4 &#197; to 7.3 &#197;). Additionally, crystallographic analysis of a library ten foldamers has identified general trends in the influence of a range of terminal functionalities, including carboxylbenzyl (Cbz), diphenylcarbamyl (N(Ph)2), ferrocene (Fc) and tert&#8208;butyloxycarbonyl (Boc), in controlling the folding behaviour of these supramolecular scaffolds. These studies could prove useful in the future development of functional foldamers which adopt specific sizes and shapes.</dc:description>

         <title>Redox Activity of Co Species in the Active Sites of CoN x /CoO x &#160;Facilitates Oxygen Electrocatalysis for Zn&#8208;Air Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing efficient bifunctional&#160;oxygen electrocatalysts is crucial for enhancing the performance of rechargeable Zn&#8208;air batteries (ZABs). In this study, cobalt/cobalt oxides embedded in N&#8208;doped carbon nanofibers (Co/CoOx/NCNFs) were synthesized through&#160;a combination of electrospinning and annealing processes. The resulting Co/CoOx/NCNFs catalysts feature abundant CoNx&#160;and CoOx&#160;active species, leveraging the large specific surface area&#160;of nanofibers to facilitate oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction&#160;(OER). The optimized&#160;Co/CoOx/NCNFs&#8208;0.1 achieved&#160;a half&#8208;wave potential (vs. RHE) of 0.82 V and required only 429 mV to reach 10 mA cm&#8315;&#178; in a typical three&#8208;electrode system with 0.1 M KOH using an electrochemical workstation equipped with a pine instruments rotator, outperforming the Pt/C+RuO2. The assembled ZABs&#160;exhibited high specific capacity (771 mAh gZn&#8722;1), substantial power density (981.6 mWh gZn&#8722;1), and long&#8208;term stability (&gt;325 h). In situ Raman spectroscopy confirmed that the electrocatalytic processes involve&#160;the redox activity&#160;of Co (II and III) species derived from abundant CoNx&#160;and CoOx, elaborating&#160;the origin&#160;of the catalysts' exceptional oxygen electrocatalysis performance. This work&#160;not only presents a straightforward and effective approach for producing bifunctional oxygen electrocatalysts in ZABs but also sheds light on the catalytic mechanisms underlying ORR and OER&#160;for CoNx/CoOx&#8208;based oxygen electrocatalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Surface Chemistry of a Halogenated Borazine: From Supramolecular Assemblies to a Random Covalent BN&#8208;Substituted Carbon Network</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The on&#8208;surface synthesis strategy has emerged as a promising route for fabricating well&#8208;defined two&#8208;dimensional (2D) BN&#8208;substituted carbon nanomaterials with tunable electronic properties. This approach relies on specially designed precursors and requires a thorough understanding of the on&#8208;surface reaction pathways. It promises precise structural control at the atomic scale, thus complementing chemical vapor deposition (CVD). In this study, we investigated a novel heteroatomic precursor, tetrabromoborazine, which incorporates a BN core and an OH group, on Ag(111) using low temperature scanning tunnelling microscopy/spectroscopy (LT&#8208;STM/STS) and X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Through sequential temperature&#8208;induced reactions involving dehalogenation and dehydrogenation, distinct tetrabromoborazine derivatives were produced as reaction intermediates, leading to the formation of specific self&#8208;assemblies. Notably, the resulting intricate supramolecular structures include a chiral kagom&#233; lattice composed of molecular dimers exhibiting a unique electronic signature. The final product obtained was a random covalent carbon network with BN&#8208;substitution and embedded oxygen heteroatoms. Our study offers valuable insights into the significance of the structure and functionalization of BN precursors in temperature&#8208;induced on&#8208;surface reactions, which can help future rational precursor design. Additionally, it introduces complex surface architectures that offer a high areal density of borazine cores.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly Twisted Fenestrindane&#8208;Based Porous Nanographenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two fenestrindane&#8208;based porous nanographenes containing four polyaromatic macrocycles in a highly twisted, basically S4&#8208;symmetric conformation were synthesized and characterized by NMR spectroscopy and mass spectrometry. Stepwise &#960;&#8208;extension at the periphery of the fenestrindane core by a sequence of eightfold Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling, fourfold Scholl cyclodehydrogenation and another eightfold Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura reaction affords the porous nanographene precursors in good yields. In the last step, fourfold intramolecular Yamamoto coupling generates the porous nanographenes in 17&#8722;18% yield. Their optical and electronic properties were studied by UV/Vis and fluorescence spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry. DFT calculations revealed structural details of the macrocycles. The surprisingly weak binding of these porous structures with chloride ions (K &#8776; 10 M&#8722;1) is attributed to their highly twisted conformation. The title compounds represent the first porous nanographenes based on the [5.5.5.5]fenestrane motif and, at the same time, they consist of a fenestrane&#8208;like polyarylene network.</dc:description>

         <title>Anchoring Pt Single&#8208;Atom Sites on Vacancies of MgO(Al) Nanosheets as Bifunctional Catalysts to Accelerate Hydrogenation&#8208;Cyclization Cascade Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The direct hydrogenation of 2&#8208;nitroacylbenzene to 2,1&#8208;benzisoxazole presents a significant challenge in the pharmaceutical and fine chemicals industries. In this study, a defect engineering strategy is employed to create bifunctional single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) by anchoring Pt single atoms onto metal vacancies within MgO(Al) nanosheets. The resultant Pt1/MgO(Al) SAC displays an exceptional catalytic activity and selectivity in the hydrogenation&#8208;cyclization of 2&#8208;nitroacylbenzene, achieving a 97.5% yield at complete conversion and a record&#8208;breaking turnover frequency of 458.8 h&#8211;1 under the mild conditions. The synergistic catalysis between the fully exposed single&#8208;atom Pt sites within a unique Pt&#8208;O&#8208;Mg/Al moiety and the abundant basic sites of the MgO(Al) support is responsible for this outstanding catalytic performance. The current work, therefore, paves the way for developing bifunctional or multifunctional SACs that can enhance efficient organocatalytic conversions.</dc:description>

         <title>Solvent Effect on Dative and Ionic Bond Strengths: A Unified Theory from Potential Analysis and Valence&#8208;Bond Computations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Potential energy surface (PES) analysis is conducted to interpret the solvent&#8208;induced variations in the strengths of dative (Me3NBH3) and ionic (LiCl) bonds, which possess both ionic and covalent (neutral) characteristics, along the bond distances. The different responses of Me3NBH3 (blue&#8208;shifting) and LiCl (red&#8208;shifting) to solvation are subsequently examined with valence bond (VB) theory.







Abstract
Solvent molecules interact with a solute through various intermolecular forces. Here we employed a potential energy surface (PES) analysis to interpret the solvent&#8208;induced variations in the strengths of dative (Me3NBH3) and ionic (LiCl) bonds, which possess both ionic and covalent (neutral) characteristics. The change of a bond is driven by the gradient (force) of the solvent&#8208;solute interaction energy with respect to the focused bond length. Positive force shortens the bond length and increases the bond force constant, leading to a blue&#8208;shift of the bond stretching vibrational frequency upon solvation. Conversely, negative force elongates the bond, resulting in a reduced bond force constant and red&#8208;shift of the stretching vibrational frequency. The different responses of Me3NBH3 and LiCl to solvation are studied with valence bond (VB) theory, as Me3NBH3 and LiCl are dominated by the neutral covalent VB structure and the ionic VB structure, respectively. The dipole moment of an ionic VB structure increases along the increasing bond distance, while the dipole moment of a neutral covalent VB structure increases with the decreasing bond distance. The roles of the dominating VB structures are further examined by the geometry optimizations and frequency calculations with the block&#8208;localized wavefunction (BLW) method.

         <title>Unveiling the Twisted Aromatic Donor Effect on the Nonlinear Response of D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A Type Malononitrile&#8208;Derived Chromophores</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The molecular structure modification by incorporating twisted aromatic donors into malononitrile&#8208;derived D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A chromophores results in diminished charge separation and intramolecular charge transfer, as demonstrated by the reduced nonlinear response compared to their planar counterparts.







Abstract
This study presents the design, synthesis, and comprehensive characterization of a novel series of D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A type malononitrile&#8208;derived chromophores, BTC&#8208;1&#8211;BTC&#8208;4. Combining various spectroscopic techniques, nonlinear Z&#8208;scan measurements, and quantum chemical calculations, we revealed the intricate relationship between nonlinear optical properties and the interplay of molecular structure, intramolecular charge transfer (ICT), and dipole moments (&#956;). Our experimental and computational findings corroborate that the polarization degree in the ground state, the charge separation in the excited state and twisted intramolecular charge transfer (TICT) collectively dictate the nonlinear optical properties of the compounds. Notably, BTC&#8208;1 exhibits an exceptional nonlinear absorption coefficient &#946; value (2&#215;10&#8722;8&#8197;m&#8201;W&#8722;1), attributed to its optimized charge transfer efficiency and pronounced degree of charge separation. Our findings provide actionable insights for the rational design of high&#8208;performance organic Nonlinear optics (NLO) materials with potential applications in advanced photonic devices.

         <title>Intramolecular Cyclization and a Retro&#8208;Ene Reaction Enable the Rapid Fragmentation of a Vitamin B1&#8208;Derived Breslow Intermediate</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new mechanism has been proposed to explain the rapid fragmentation of a thiamin&#8208;derived Breslow intermediate. Extensive DFT analyses demonstrate that the cyclization, thiazolium expulsion, and retro&#8208;ene reactions that comprise this mechanism provide a lower energy pathway to fragmentation than the currently accepted mechanism. This improved mechanistic understanding sheds light on how thiamin&#8208;dependent enzymes avoid cofactor fragmentation.







Abstract
In solution, analogues of the Breslow intermediate formed during catalysis by benzoylformate decarboxylase (BFDC) undergo rapid, irreversible fragmentation. The ability of BFDC to prevent this reaction and preserve its cofactor is a striking example of an enzyme &#8216;steering&#8217; a reactive intermediate towards a productive pathway. To understand how BFDC suppresses the off&#8208;pathway reactivity of this Breslow intermediate, a clear mechanistic understanding of the fragmentation reaction is required. Here, DFT calculations reveal an unexpected mechanism for the solution&#8208;phase fragmentation that involves an intramolecular cyclization and a subsequent retro&#8208;ene reaction to release the final products. Free energy profiles demonstrate that this pathway is significantly more facile than the previously proposed mechanism that invoked Breslow intermediate enolates as intermediates. Additional computations have been performed to understand why related Breslow intermediates do not undergo analogous fragmentation reactions. Calculations performed with two closely related Breslow intermediates suggest that subtle differences in the relative values of &#916;G&#8800; for protonation and fragmentation dictate whether a given intermediate will fragment or not. These differences and the fragmentation mechanism unveiled in this work may have ramifications for the mechanism of BFDC and other thiamin&#8208;dependent enzymes and could provide general lessons related to the control of reactive intermediates by enzymes.

         <title>Radical&#8208;Chain Hydrosilylation of Alkenes Enabled by Triplet Energy Transfer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A visible light&#8208;triggered organophotocatalytic hydrosilylation of alkenes and alkynes, which proceeds via a triplet energy transfer (EnT)&#8208;enabled radical chain pathway, has been developed.







Abstract
Development of mild, robust and metal&#8208;free catalytic approach for the hydrosilylation of alkenes is critical to the advancement of modern organosilicon chemistry given their powerful capacity in the construction of various C&#8722;Si bonds. Herein, we wish to disclose a visible light&#8208;triggered organophotocatalytic strategy, which proceeds via a triplet energy transfer (EnT)&#8208;enabled radical chain pathway. Notably, this redox&#8208;neutral protocol is capable of accommodating a broad spectrum of electron&#8208;deficient and &#8208;rich alkenes with excellent functional group compatibility. Electron&#8208;deficient alkenes are more reactive and the reaction could be finished within a couple of minutes even in PBS solution with extremely low concentration, which suggests its click&#8208;like potential in organic synthesis. The preparative power of the transformations has been further highlighted in a number of complex settings, including the late&#8208;stage functionalization and scale&#8208;up experiments. Furthermore, although only highly reactive (TMS)3SiH is suitable hydrosilane substrate, our studies revealed the great reactivity and versatility of (TMS)3Si&#8722; group in diverse C&#8722;Si and Si&#8722;Si bond cleavage&#8208;based transformations, enabling the rapid introduction of diverse functional groups and the facile construction of valuable quaternary silicon architectures.

Photosynthesis is a complex multi&#8208;step process in which light collection is the initial step of photosynthesis and plays an important role in the efficiency of solar energy utilization. Here,we modified &#946;&#8208;CD with the donor molecule naphthalimide and adamantane with the tetraphenylethylene molecule which has aggregation&#8208;induced emission effects (AIE). By using fluorescent molecules with AIE, the self&#8208;quenching effect caused by aggregation in aqueous solution can be effectively avoided. This study provides a new strategy for constructing artificial light&#8208;harvesting system, and shows broad application prospects.







Abstract
Photosynthesis is a complex multi&#8208;step process in which light collection is the initial step of photosynthesis and plays an important role in the utilization of solar energy. In order to improve the utilization of sunlight, researchers have developed a variety of artificial light&#8208;harvesting systems to simulate photosynthesis in nature. Here, we report a supramolecular artificial light&#8208;harvesting system in aqueous solution. Since &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin (&#946;&#8208;CD) has a hydrophobic cavity and a hydrophilic outer surface, we adopt &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin (&#946;&#8208;CD) as the host molecule and use adamantane as the guest molecule. At the same time, we modified &#946;&#8208;CD with the donor molecule naphthalimide and adamantane with the tetraphenylethylene molecule which has aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) effects. By using fluorescent molecules with AIE, the self&#8208;quenching effect caused by aggregation in aqueous solution can be effectively avoided. Due to the host&#8208;guest interaction of &#946;&#8208;CD and adamantane, nanoparticles with stable structure and uniform size can be spontaneously assembled in water. Because of the close distance and strong spectral overlap between naphthalimide and tetraphenylethylene, F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) was realized, and artificial light&#8208;harvesting system was successfully constructed in aqueous solution. Therefore, this study provides a new strategy for constructing artificial light&#8208;harvesting system, and the artificial light&#8208;harvesting system shows broad application prospects in aqueous solutions.

         <title>Waste Valorization in a Sustainable Bio&#8208;Based Economy: The Road to Carbon Neutrality</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Important developments, over the last five decades, towards realization of sustainable chemicals manufacture, are discussed. They include the use of waste biomass and CO2 as a raw material, renewable electricity as the energy source and chemo&#8208; and biocatalysis, with whole cells or cell&#8208;free enzymes, including the use of electro(bio)catalysis and photo(bio)catalysis, as the facilitators.







Abstract
The development of sustainable chemistry underlying the quest to minimize and/or valorize waste in the carbon&#8208;neutral manufacture of chemicals is followed over the last four to five decades. Both chemo&#8208; and biocatalysis have played an indispensable role in this odyssey. in particular developments in protein engineering, metagenomics and bioinformatics over the preceding three decades have played a crucial supporting role in facilitating the widespread application of both whole cell and cell&#8208;free biocatalysis. The pressing need, driven by climate change mitigation, for a drastic reduction in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, has precipitated an energy transition based on decarbonization of energy and defossilization of organic chemicals production. The latter involves waste biomass and/or waste CO2 as the feedstock and green electricity generated using solar, wind, hydroelectric or nuclear energy. The use of waste polysaccharides as feedstocks will underpin a renaissance in carbohydrate chemistry with pentoses and hexoses as base chemicals and bio&#8208;based solvents and polymers as environmentally friendly downstream products. The widespread availability of inexpensive electricity and solar energy has led to increasing attention for electro(bio)catalysis and photo(bio)catalysis which in turn is leading to myriad innovations in these fields.

         <title>Cascade C&#8722;H Activation and Two C&#8722;C Bond Forming in Reaction of Azalutetacyclopentadiene with 2&#8208;Methylbenzonitriles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reaction of azalutetacyclopentadiene toward 2&#8208;methylbenzonitriles provides a series of fused 7&#8211;5&#8208;6&#8208;membered azalutetacycle products. Mechanistic studies reveal that the reaction proceeds through three steps: the activation of the benzylic C&#8722;H bond, followed by the first intramolecular nucleophilic attack to form the first new C&#8722;C bond, and then the intramolecular nucleophilic attack of uncoordinated carbanion toward C=N triple bond. Two new C&#8722;C bonds are formed in the highly selective three&#8208;step cascade transformation.







Abstract
Azametallacyclopentadienes are an important class of metallacycles as the key intermediates in metal&#8208;promoted or catalyzed carbon&#8208;carbon coupling reaction of nitriles and alkynes. Rare&#8208;earth azametallacyclopentadienes have shown various reactivity toward nitriles, depending on the substituents of nitriles. The reaction of azalutetacyclopentadienes toward 2&#8208;methylbenzonitriles has been investigated in this work, which selectively affords the fused 7&#8208;5&#8208;6&#8208;membered azalutetacycles as products. Computational studies reveal that the reaction of azalutetacyclopentadienes toward 2&#8208;methylbenzonitriles selectively initiates with the remote activation of the benzylic C&#8722;H bond by the Lu&#8722;N bond, followed by the intramolecular nucleophilic attack from the deprotonated benzylic carbon to form a C&#8722;C bond. Subsequently, the high ring strain promoted the generation of the uncoordinated carbanion dissociated from the lutetium center, which then undergoes intramolecular nucleophilic attack toward C=N triple bond to give the final product containing fused 7&#8208;5&#8208;6&#8208;membered azalutetacycle. This work not only achieves highly selective three&#8208;step cascade reaction to form a unique class of rare&#8208;earth metallacycle, but also provides a new idea for the transformation of unsaturated substrates with C&#8722;H bonds that can be activated.

         <title>A BODIPY&#8208;Ferrocene Conjugate for the Combined Photodynamic Therapy and Chemodynamic Therapy with Improved Antitumor Efficiency</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A BODIPY&#8208;ferrocene conjugate with balanced 1O2 and &#8901;OH generation ability has been designed and synthesized. The as&#8208;prepared conjugate can significantly improve the intracellular ROS level of tumor cells by combining PDT and CDT at low drug doses, thus realizing the efficient tumor cells killing with a synergistic strategy.







Abstract
Photodynamic therapy (PDT) can destroy tumor cells by generating singlet oxygen (1O2) under light irradiation, which is limited by the hypoxia of the neoplastic tissue. Chemodynamic therapy (CDT) can produce toxic hydroxyl radical (&#8901;OH) to eradicate tumor cells by catalytic decomposition of endogenous hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), the therapeutic effect of which is highly dependent on the concentration of H2O2. Herein, we propose a BODIPY&#8208;ferrocene conjugate with a balanced 1O2 and &#8901;OH generation capacity, which can serve as a high&#8208;efficiency antitumor agent by combining PDT and CDT. The ferrocene moieties endow the as&#8208;prepared conjugates with the ability of chemodynamic killing of tumor cells. Moreover, combined PDT/CDT therapy with improved antitumor efficiency can be realized after exposure to light irradiation. Compared with the monotherapy by PDT or CDT, the BODIPY&#8208;ferrocene conjugates can significantly increase the intracellular ROS levels of the tumor cells after light irradiation, thereby inducing the tumor cell apoptosis at low drug doses. In this way, a synergistic antitumor treatment is achieved by the combination of PDT and CDT.

         <title>Hierarchical Self&#8208;Assembly of Hyperbranched Polymer&#8208;Based Topological Supramolecular Amphiphiles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hyperbranched polymer (HBP)&#8208;based supramolecular polymers (SPs) perfectly integrated the dynamic nature of SPs and the 3D topological features and multifunctionality of HBP polymers. The HBP&#8208;based SPs with fascinating topologies have aroused tremendous attention due to their structural novelty and attractive applications. This concept overviews the current progress on the construction and self&#8208;assembly of HBP&#8208;based SPs.







Abstract
Supramolecular polymers (SPs) are constructed through non&#8208;covalent interactions. The dynamic or reversible nature of SPs endows them unique physical and chemical properties, such as self&#8208;adaptive and stimuli&#8208;response abilities. The topological structures of SPs play an important role in determining the physicochemical properties and functionality. Hyperbranched polymers (HBPs) are highly branched 3D macromolecules with linear, dendritic, and terminal units, which makes them versatile candidates for the construction of SPs with fascinating architectures. The resultant HBP&#8208;based SPs perfectly integrated the dynamic/reversible nature of SPs and the 3D topological features and multifunctionality of HBP polymers. To date, various types of HBP&#8208;based SPs and their assemblies have been constructed, and their potential applications have been explored as well. This article overviews the current progress on self&#8208;assembly of HBP&#8208;based SPs. The strategies for construction of HBP&#8208;based SPs and their assemblies are discussed. Typical potential applications of the assemblies of HBP&#8208;based SPs are also introduced.

This article overviews the current progress on self-assembly of HBP-based SPs. The strategies for construction of HBP-based SPs and their assemblies are discussed. Typical potential applications of the assemblies of HBP-based SPs are also introduced.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>The Non&#8208;centrosymmetric Borate Hydride Sr4Ba3(BO3)3.83H2.5</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sr4Ba3(BO3)3.83H2.5, as the second compound to combine borate and hydride ions, has been synthesized by a mechanochemical synthesis route. The structure has been elucidated by synchrotron X&#8208;ray and neutron diffraction and determined to crystallize in the non&#8208;centrosymmetric space group P63mc (186) with the cell parameters a = 10.87762(15) &#197; and c = 6.98061(11) &#197;. A detailed investigation of the compound by vibrational spectroscopy in combination with Density Functional Theory calculations reveals the disordered nature of the structure and proves the presence of both borate and hydride ions. Electronic band structure calculations predict a large band gap of 7.1 eV. Hydride states are predicted at the topmost valence band, which agrees well with earlier reported heteroanionic hydrides. We hereby were able to successfully apply previously synthetic and analytical schemes to introduce another member of the rare compounds that contain complex oxoanions simultaneously with hydride ions.</dc:description>

         <title>Asymmetric Kinetic Resolution Polymerization of Racemic Lactide Mediated by Axial&#8208;Chiral Thiourea/Phosphazene Binary Organocatalyst</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The simple and effective binary organocatalytic pairs, associating axial&#8208;chiral thiourea organocatalysts and phosphazene bases, allow for both high polymerization activity and moderate enantioselectivity (kD/kL=18.1) for the AKRP of rac&#8208;LA at room temperature, yielding semi&#8208;crystalline and metal&#8208;free stereoblock PLA with a melting temperature as high as 186&#8201;&#176;C.







Abstract
Asymmetric kinetic resolution polymerization (AKRP) provides an ideal way to obtain highly isotactic polylactide (PLA) with superior thermal&#8208;mechanical properties from racemic lactide (rac&#8208;LA). However, the development of a new catalytic system with concurrent high activity and selectivity at ambient temperature remains a great callenge. Here, a series of simple and effective binary organocatalytic pairs containing axial&#8208;chiral thioureas and commercially available phosphazene bases were designed. These chiral binary organocatalytic pairs allow for both high polymerization activity and moderate enantioselectivity for AKRP of rac&#8208;LA at room temperature, yielding semi&#8208;crystalline and metal&#8208;free stereoblock PLA with a melting temperature as high as 186&#8201;&#176;C. The highest kinetic resolution coefficient (krel) of 8.5 at 47&#8201;% conversion was obtained, and D&#8208;LA was preferentially polymerized via kinetic resolution with a maximum selectivity factor (kD/kL) of 18.1, indicating that an enantiomorphic site control mechanism (ESC) was involved.

         <title>The Hydronaphthalide Monoanion: Isolation of the &#8220;red transient&#8221; Birch Intermediate from liquid Ammonia</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present the isolation and full characterisation of a reactive intermediate from the Birch reduction which was first observed in 1939.The historically as transient described compound was isolated as an organic salt from the reaction of naphthalene, sodium, and tetramethylammonium chloride in liquid ammonia. The trapped intermediate demonstrates a tamed reduction potential enabling higher reaction control compared to stronger reducing agents.







Abstract
Birch reactions employing alkali metals in ammonia have been a well&#8208;established method for the reduction and functionalisation of aromatic compounds for nearly 100&#8197;years. Speculations regarding intermediates in the reaction pathway have been discussed since the beginning. We hereby report the isolation of NMe4(HNaph) (1), a kinetically trapped intermediate of the Birch reaction of naphthalene and sodium in liquid ammonia. 1 has been fully characterised and has been shown to continue to react to 1,2/1,4&#8208;dihydronaphthalene &#8211; the Birch product of the reduction of naphthalene. The reactivity of 1 was investigated towards activity as an electron and hydride transfer agent with both, elements and small organic molecules. 1 demonstrates a tamed reduction potential which allows for controlled reactions such as the selective formation of hexasulphide and hexaselenide anions.

         <title>Chalcogen Bonding in Selective Recognition and Liquid&#8208;Liquid Extraction of Perrhenate</title>

Potent tetrapodal Se&#8208;based ChB receptors selectively extract ReO4&#8722; from 100&#8201;% water medium, employing both precipitation and LLE method.







Abstract
Efficient recognition and extraction of hazardous anionic pollutants from water medium is of great significance for environmental concerns, representing a challenging area of research in supramolecular chemistry. In this study, we present, for the first time, a comprehensive demonstration of the ability of chalcogen bonding (ChB) to recognize and remove the ReO4&#8722; from 100&#8201;% water medium. The anion recognition ability is well elucidated through solution phase NMR and ITC studies, which clearly reveal the selective binding of ReO4&#8722; over other oxo&#8208;anions. Moreover, the selenoimidazolium scaffold effectively engages in Se&#8226;&#8226;&#8226;O ChB interaction with ReO4&#8722; as confirmed by X&#8208;ray crystal structure and XPS analysis. More importantly, the binding of ReO4&#8722; with different prolongations of the &#963;&#8211;holes, along with Se&#8226;&#8226;&#8226;Se chalcogen bonding interactions, lead to the formation of a 1D supramolecular assembly. Eventually, ChB receptor Se4Me&#8722;Br exhibits ~62&#8201;% ReO4&#8722; extraction efficiency through precipitation as the extraction method. Furthermore, in efforts to enhance efficiency, a hydrophobic ChB receptor Se4Do&#8208;PF6 has been prepared, achieving an efficiency of up to ~93&#8201;% at a very low concentration (~5&#8197;ppm) by liquid&#8208;liquid extraction.

         <title>Tuning Energetics of 2&#8201;e&#8722;/2H+ PCET Properties with Model Ru&#8208;bisamido Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>

Fine&#8208;tuning of electronic structures allows control over energetic parameters in a family of complexes that undergo multi&#8208;redox 2e&#8722;/2H+ processes. The orbital overlap gives structural energy stabilization for potential inversion.







Abstract
Most redox processes that break/form bonds involve net 2e&#8722; changes, and many are coupled to protons. Yet most proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET) studies focus on 1e&#8722;/1H+ reactions. Reported here is a family of molecular models that undergo tunable 2e&#8722;/2H+ redox changes. Complexes [(X2bpy)RuII(en*)2](PF6)2 and [(X2bpy)RuIV(en*&#8208;H)2](PF6)2 have been synthesized with bpy=2,2&#8217;&#8208;bipyridine with 4,4&#8217;&#8208;subtitutions X=&#8722;NMe2, &#8722;OMe, &#8722;Me, &#8722;H, &#8722;CF3; and en*=2,3&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;2,3&#8208;butanediamine. They have been characterized by IR, UV&#8208;vis, and NMR spectroscopies, XRD, electrochemistry, mass spectrometry, DFT and (TD)DFT computations. The introduction of electron&#8208;withdrawing and donating groups at the 4,4&#8217;&#8208;position of the bpy ligand affects the complexes&#8217; redox potentials, pKa&#8217;s, and Bond Dissociation Free Energies (BDFEs) of the N&#8722;H bonds in the en* ligands. The average BDFEs for the overall 2e&#8722;/2H+ PCET span over 5&#8197;kcal/mol. Notably, these complexes all show marked potential inversion over an extended range, &#916;pKa&gt;25&#8197;units and &#916;E0&gt;1.4&#8197;V. Potential inversion remains despite the electronic influence of bpy's substitutions which regulate N&#8722;H properties several bonds apart by trans&#8208;effect over d&#960;&#8208;molecular orbitals at the Ru center. The experimental and computational results presented in this work support the presence of strong coupling between electrons and protons, for modelling insights of 2e&#8722;/2H+ transfer reactivity.

&lt;p&gt;Fine-tuning of electronic structures allows control over energetic parameters in a family of complexes that undergo multi-redox 2e&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;/2H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; processes. The orbital overlap gives structural energy stabilization for potential inversion.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most redox processes that break/form bonds involve net 2e&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; changes, and many are coupled to protons. Yet most proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) studies focus on 1e&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;/1H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; reactions. Reported here is a family of molecular models that undergo tunable 2e&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;/2H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; redox changes. Complexes &lt;b&gt;[(X&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;bpy)Ru&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt;(en*)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;](PF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;[(X&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;bpy)Ru&lt;sup&gt;IV&lt;/sup&gt;(en*-H)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;](PF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; have been synthesized with bpy=2,2&#8217;-bipyridine with 4,4&#8217;-subtitutions X=&#8722;NMe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, &#8722;OMe, &#8722;Me, &#8722;H, &#8722;CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;; and en*=2,3-dimethyl-2,3-butanediamine. They have been characterized by IR, UV-vis, and NMR spectroscopies, XRD, electrochemistry, mass spectrometry, DFT and (TD)DFT computations. The introduction of electron-withdrawing and donating groups at the 4,4&#8217;-position of the bpy ligand affects the complexes&#8217; redox potentials, p&lt;i&gt;K&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;&#8217;s, and Bond Dissociation Free Energies (BDFEs) of the N&#8722;H bonds in the en* ligands. The average BDFEs for the overall 2e&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;/2H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; PCET span over 5&#8197;kcal/mol. Notably, these complexes all show marked potential inversion over an extended range, &#916;p&lt;i&gt;K&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;gt;25&#8197;units and &#916;&lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;gt;1.4&#8197;V. Potential inversion remains despite the electronic influence of bpy's substitutions which regulate N&#8722;H properties several bonds apart by trans-effect over d&#960;-molecular orbitals at the Ru center. The experimental and computational results presented in this work support the presence of strong coupling between electrons and protons, for modelling insights of 2e&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;/2H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; transfer reactivity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Energy&#8208;Transfer Enabled Divergent Synthesis of Polycyclic &#947;&#8208;Sultines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photoinduced energy transfer enabled procedure for the construction of otherwise challenging&#8208;to&#8208;access polycyclic sultine derivatives has been discovered. The reaction demonstrates good functional group compatibility, mild reaction conditions, excellent diastereoselectivity, and scalable.







Abstract
A visible&#8208;light&#8208;initiated energy&#8208;transfer enabled radical cyclization for the divergent synthesis of polycyclic &#947;&#8208;sultine derivatives has been developed. The reaction provides an alternative and expeditious access to benzofused &#947;&#8208;sultine frameworks, the analogues of &#947;&#8208;lactones and &#947;&#8208;sultones, and features good functional group compatibility, mild reaction conditions and excellent diastereoselectivity. The robustness and application potential of this method have also been successfully displayed by two gram&#8208;scale reactions and the synthesis of polycyclic sultones. Mechanistic studies indicated the transformations through a possible energy&#8208;transfer enabled intramolecular radical homolytic substitution or hydrogen atom transfer process mainly.

         <title>The Strategies Towards Electrochemical Generation of Aryl Radicals</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electrochemical generation of aryl radicals from various precursors has attracted significant attention due to their high reactivity in forming multiple chemical bonds. This review summarizes recent advancements by categorizing the aryl radical precursors into five key types: (1) aryl diazonium salts, (2) aryl halides, (3) aryl (sulfonyl)hydrazines, (4) aryl quaternary arylammonium salts, and (5) other aryl radical precursors.







Abstract
The advancement in electrochemical techniques has unlocked a new path for achieving unprecedented oxidations and reductions of aryl radical precursors in a controlled and selective manner. This approach facilitates the construction of aromatic carbon&#8722;carbon and carbon&#8722;heteroatom bonds. In light of the green merits and the growing importance of this technique in aryl radical chemistry, this review aims to provide an overview of the recent advance in the electrochemical generation of aryl radicals organized by the aryl radical precursor type, with a focus on the substrate scope, limitation, and underlying mechanism, thereby inspiring future work on electrochemical aryl radical generation.

         <title>Stimuli&#8208;Induced Fluorescence Switching in Azine&#8208;Containing Fluorophores Displaying Resonance&#8208;Stabilized ESIPT Emission</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis, structural and photophysical characterization of azaheterocycles&#8208;functionalized 2&#8208;(2&#8217;&#8208;hydroxyphenyl)benzazole derivatives showing dual&#8208;state emission properties are described. Their stimuli&#8208;sensitive (acid, cations) response is also scrutinized with the support of ab initio calculations.







Abstract
This article reports the synthesis, along with structural and photophysical characterization of 2&#8208;(2&#8217;&#8208;hydroxyphenyl)benzazole derivatives functionalized with various azaheterocycles (pyridine, pyrimidine, terpyridine). These compounds show dual&#8208;state emission properties, that is intense fluorescence both in solution and in the solid&#8208;state with a range of fluorescent color going from blue to orange. Moreover, the nature of their excited state can be tuned by the presence of external stimuli such as protons or metal cations. In the absence of stimuli, these dyes show emission stemming from anionic species obtained after deprotonation (D* transition), whereas upon protonation or metal chelation, ESIPT process occurs leading to a stabilized and highly emissive K* transition. With the help of extensive ab initio calculations, we confirm that external stimuli can switch the nature of the transitions, making this series of dyes attractive candidates for the development of stimuli&#8208;responsive fluorescent ratiometric probes.

         <title>Stable Antiaromatic [16]Triphyrin(2.1.1) with Core Modification: Synthesis Using a 16&#960; Electrocyclic Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Antiaromatic porphyrinoids have attracted significant attention owing to their unique electronic properties and potential applications. However, synthesis of antiaromatic contracted porphyrinoids is challenging owing to the inherent instability associated with smaller ring sizes. In this study, we report the synthesis and characterization of the first stable trioxa[16]triphyrin(2.1.1), a novel 16&#960; antiaromatic contracted porphyrinoid. We utilized a core modification approach to stabilize the [16]triphyrin(2.1.1). X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis revealed a nearly planar structure. Electrochemical studies demonstrated reversible oxidation behavior and a small HOMO&#8211;LUMO gap, which was consistent with its antiaromatic nature. Chemical oxidation yielded an aromatic [14]triphyrin(2.1.1) dication, highlighting the antiaromaticity&#8211;aromaticity switching capability of this system. This synthesis involved the discovery of a key intermediate, dihydrotrioxatriphyrin(2.1.1), which underwent oxidative dehydrogenation to yield the target compound. Theoretical calculations suggested that dihydrotrioxatriphyrin(2.1.1) formed via a rare 16&#960; electrocyclic reaction. The successful synthesis and characterization of this stable trioxa[16]triphyrin(2.1.1) underscores the potential of the core modification strategies for the rational design of novel antiaromatic systems with tunable properties. Moreover, the discovery of the rare 16&#960; electrocyclic reaction advances the understanding of high&#8208;order pericyclic processes and may inspire new synthetic strategies for complex macrocyclic compounds.</dc:description>

         <title>Recognition&#8208;Encoded Molecules: a Minimal Self&#8208;Replicator</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nucleic acids, with their unique duplex structure, which is key for information replication, have sparked interest in self&#8208;replication's role in life's origins. Early template&#8208;based replicators, initially built on short oligonucleotides, expanded to include peptides and synthetic molecules. We explore here the potential of a class of synthetic duplex&#8208;forming oligoanilines, as self&#8208;replicators. We have recently developed oligoanilines equipped with 2&#8208;trifluoromethylphenol&#8211;phosphine oxide H&#8208;bond base pairs and we investigate whether the imine formed between aniline and aldehyde complementary monomers can self&#8208;replicate. Despite lacking a clear sigmoidal kinetic profile, control experiments with a methylated donor and a competitive inhibitor support self&#8208;replication. Further investigations with the reduced aniline dimer demonstrate templated synthesis, revealing a characteristic parabolic growth. After showing sequence selective duplex formation, templated synthesis and the emergence of catalytic function, the self&#8208;replication behaviour further suggests that the unique properties of nucleic acids can be paralleled by synthetic recognition&#8208;encoded molecules.</dc:description>

         <title>Chirality at Metal in a Linear [Ag(NHC)2]+ Complex: Stereogenic C&#8211;Ag&#8211;C Axis, Atropisomerism and Role of &#960;&#8208;&#960; Interactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chirality at the metal center is a well&#8208;established concept, exemplified by numerous four&#8208; and six&#8208;coordinated complexes. Here, a pioneering example of linear chirality&#8208;at&#8208;metal is described: L&#8208;2&#8208;[Ag(NHC)2]+ (NHC = N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene). In solution, stabilizing &#960;&#8208;&#960; interactions preserve the chiral information of the solid state. Consequently, a novel class of atropisomers is identified, whose stereogenicity arises from hindered rotation about a C&#8211;Ag&#8211;C axis, instead of a typical C&#8211;C bond.</dc:description>

         <title>Organic two&#8208;photon&#8208;absorbing photosensitizers can overcome competing light absorption in organic photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Conventional organic photocatalysis typically relies on ultraviolet and short&#8208;wavelength visible photons as the energy source. However, this approach often suffers from competing light absorption by reactants, products, intermediates, and co&#8208;catalysts, leading to reduced quantum efficiency and side reactions. To address this issue, we developed novel organic two&#8208;photon&#8208;absorbing (TPA) photosensitizers capable of functioning under deep red and near&#8208;infrared light irradiation. Three model reactions including cyclization, Sonogashira Csp2&#8208;Csp cross&#8208;coupling, and Csp2&#8208;N cross&#8208;coupling reactions were selected to compare the performance of the new photosensitizers under both blue (427 nm) and deep red (660 nm) light irradiation. The obtained results unambiguously prove that for reactions involving blue light&#8208;absorbing reactants, products, and/or co&#8208;catalysts, deep red light source resulted in better performance than blue light when utilizing our TPA photosensitizers. This work highlights the potential of our metal&#8208;free TPA photosensitizers as a sustainable and effective solution to mitigate the competing light absorption issue in photocatalysis, not only expanding the scope of organic photocatalysts but also reducing reliance on expensive Ru/Ir/Os&#8208;based photosensitizers.</dc:description>

         <title>Azobenzene&#8208;attached (NHC)Gold(I) and (NHC)Copper(I) Complexes as Photoswitchable Catalysts</title>

         <dc:description>Photoswitchable (pre)catalysts, N,N'&#8208;bis&#8208;azobenzene&#8208;based (NHC)gold(I) and N,N'&#8208;bis&#8208;azobenzene&#8208;derived (NHC)copper(I) complexes are reported. Trans to cis isomerization of the attached photoswitchable moieties in the Au(I) complex enables four&#8208;fold decrement in the rate of oxazoline formation reaction. Whereas the progress of the copper(I) catalyzed, azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition reaction gets reduced by at least threefold. Alternate exposure to UV and blue light could easily toggle the rate of reactions remotely. The catalytic activity of thermodynamically stable trans&#8208;trans isomers is found to be similar to the common N&#8208;aryl substituted NHC&#8208;Au/Cu(I) complexes. NHC&#8208;Au(I) and &#8208;Cu(I) compounds bearing (trans)azobenzene moieties were characterized by X&#8208;ray diffraction. Photoswitching, recyclability studies, and the metastable isomer's thermal half&#8208;life in both complexes were studied via UV&#8208;visible spectroscopy. Whereas the extent of photoswitching and concomitant formation of geometrical isomers were investigated by using&#160;1H&#8208;NMR&#160;spectroscopic study. Calculated percentage buried volumes of the three geometrical isomers show the trend trans&#8208;trans &lt; trans&#8208;cis &lt; cis&#8208;cis.</dc:description>

         <title>Functionalized &#945;&#8208;Cyanostilbene Derivatives for Detection of Hypoxia or Proteostasis Imbalance in Live Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>&#945;&#8208;Cyanostilbene represents one of the easily functionalized aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) scaffolds. It has been widely adopted for the construction of fluorescent materials for broad applications. Here, we further expanded the utilization of &#945;&#8208;cyanostilbene derivatives for the detection of hypoxia or proteostasis imbalance in live cells. Four different amine containing donors were introduced to construct &#945;&#8208;cyanostilbene derivatives (R&#8208;ASC) with donor&#8208;acceptor scaffolds. Equipped with the cysteine (Cys) reactive group, maleimide (MI), R&#8208;ASC&#8208;MI shows fluorescence turn&#8208;on property upon binding with unfolded proteins in vitro and in live cells under proteostatic stress. By virtue of R&#8208;ASC&#8208;MI, the level of unfolded protein loads in cells can be quantified by flow cytometry, or visualized under microscope. Furthermore, we also characterized the performance of R&#8208;ASC&#8208;NO2, synthetic precursors of R&#8208;ASC&#8208;MI, in cellular hypoxia. R&#8208;ASC&#8208;NO2 revealed upregulated activities of nitroreductase, as well as increased hydrophobicity in live cells, under either chemical (NaN3) induced or atmospheric (1% O2) hypoxia. Together, the advantages of easy modification and high signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio of new &#945;&#8208;cyanostilbene derivatives reported in this work highlight the great potential of &#945;&#8208;cyanostilbene in constructing functional biosensors and many other domains.</dc:description>

         <title>Structure&#8208;Activity Relationships in Supramolecular Hosts Targeting Bacterial Phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) Lipids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The World Health Organization has described the antimicrobial resistance crisis as one of the top ten global public health threats. New antimicrobial agents that can fight infections caused by antimicrobial resistant pathogens are therefore needed. A potential strategy is the development of small molecules that can selectively interact with bacterial membranes (or membranes of other microbial pathogens), and thereby rapidly kill the bacteria. Here, we report the structure&#8208;activity relationship within a group of 22 compounds that were designed to bind the bacterial lipid phosphatidylethanolamine (PE). Liposome&#8208;based studies reveal that the lipophilicity of the compounds has the strongest effect on both the affinity and selectivity for PE. The best results were obtained for compounds with logP &#8776; 3.75, which showed a 5x to 7x selectivity for bacterial PE lipids over human PC (phosphatidylcholine) lipids. Furthermore, these compounds also showed potent antibacterial activity against the Gram&#8208;positive bacterium B. cereus, with minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) below 10 &#181;M, a concentration where they showed minimal hemolytic activity against human red blood cells. These results not only show the possibility of PE&#8208;binding small molecules to function as antibiotics, but also provide guidelines for the development of compounds targeting other types of biologically relevant membrane lipids.</dc:description>

Liposome-based studies reveal that the lipophilicity of the compounds has the strongest effect on both the affinity and selectivity for PE. The best results were obtained for compounds with logP &#8776; 3.75, which showed a 5x to 7x selectivity for bacterial PE lipids over human PC (phosphatidylcholine) lipids. Furthermore, these compounds also showed potent antibacterial activity against the Gram-positive bacterium B. cereus, with minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) below 10 &#181;M, a concentration where they showed minimal hemolytic activity against human red blood cells. These results not only show the possibility of PE-binding small molecules to function as antibiotics, but also provide guidelines for the development of compounds targeting other types of biologically relevant membrane lipids.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Counterion Exchange Enhances the Brightness and Photostability of a Fluorous Cyanine Dye</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fluorofluorophores are a unique class of fluorophores that can be solubilized in perfluorocarbons (PFCs) and used to study biological systems. However, because of the low dielectric constant and high oxygen solubility in the fluorous phase, the brightness and photostability of the fluorofluorophores are significantly diminished. Here, we leveraged the tight ion pairing in the fluorous phase to improve the photophysical properties of a fluorous soluble pentamethine dye (FCy5) via counterion exchange. We found that larger, softer, fluorinated, aryl borate counterions promote the ideal polymethine state where charge delocalization across the polymethine chain increases the brightness (6&#8208;fold) and photostability (55&#8208;fold) of FCy5.</dc:description>

         <title>Novel Methods for the Formation of Free Carbyne Radicals in Solution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Carbyne free radicals RC&#8942; (RC) are usually associated with high&#8208;energy processes, thus research on their preparation, chemical reactivity, and prevalence under mild conditions is scarce. Recently, it was reported that metallo&#8208;complexes containing CR ligands may undergo spontaneous degradation in aqueous solutions to produce free RC radicals. These highly reactive species may react with each other to form the corresponding alkyne and other products. The reaction of 1,1,1 halo&#8208;carbo&#8208;hydrates with Cr(II) ions also forms RC radicals under mild conditions. Herein, we report two additional synthetic routes that produce free RC radicals under mild conditions. First, the reaction between metallic zinc and acetic anhydride produces 2&#8208;butyne and several other C2, C3, and C4 compounds. Isotopic&#8208;labeling experiments indicate that the formation of 2&#8208;butyne results from an inter&#8208;molecular reaction in which two RC moieties from two acetic anhydride molecules combine in solution. In addition, the degradation of the tri&#8208;molybdenum complex [Mo3(H3CC&#8801;CCH3)(OAc)(H2O)2Br7], in which a 2&#8208;butyne ligand is coordinated to the Mo3 framework in a &#956;3&#8208;&#951;2 (&#8869;) binding mode in aqueous solution produces several C2, C3, C4 and C5 molecules. This indicates the formation of free CH3C radicals by a homolytic cleavage of the carbon&#8208;carbon triple bond.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The first examples of bis&#8208;squaramide axle containing [2]rotaxanes linked via rigid aryl and flexible alkyl spacers synthesised using copper(I) catalysed active metal template methodology are reported. The halide and oxoanion binding properties of the [2]rotaxanes in aqueous&#8208;organic solvent media are examined through extensive 1H&#8208;NMR titration experiments to investigate the impact of integrating multiple squaramide motifs on the anion binding capabilities of the interlocked receptors. These studies reveal that the bis&#8208;squaramide rotaxane host systems exhibit enhanced halide anion binding capabilities relative to a mono&#8208;squaramide axle functionalised rotaxane, demonstrating a rare anti&#8208;Hofmeister bias halide anion selectivity trend in aqueous&#8208;organic mixtures and highlighting the efficacy of the potent solvent shielded hydrophobic interlocked binding pocket created upon mechanical bond formation. Notably, employing a rigid aryl linker between the two squaramide motifs in the axle component enables the rotaxane host to exhibit strong and selective binding of tetrahedral oxoanions. Conversely, a flexible alkyl spacer facilitates trigonal oxoanion selective recognition by the bis&#8208;squaramide [2]rotaxane.</dc:description>

         <title>N&#8208;Vacancy Enriched Porous BN Fibers for Enhanced Polysulfides Adsorption and Conversion in High&#8208;Performance Lithium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presented herein centers on the fabrication of one&#8208;dimensional (1D) BN fibers with abundant pores and sufficient N&#8208;vacancy defects, achieved through a unique strategy of thermal crystallization following a pre&#8208;condensation step. After incorporating these fibers with highly interweaved bacterial cellulose (BC) followed by carbonization, the resulting Nv&#8208;BN@CBC exhibited higher specific capacity, superior rate capability, and more stable cycling performance.







Abstract
Severe shuttle effect of soluble polysulfides and sluggish redox kinetics have been thought of as the critical issues hindering the extensive applications of lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries (LSBs). Herein, one&#8208;dimensional boron nitride (1D BN) fibers with abundant pores and sufficient N&#8208;vacancy defects were synthesized using a thermal crystallization following a pre&#8208;condensation step. The 1D structure of BN facilitates unblocked ions diffusion pathways during charge/discharge cycles. The embedded pores within the polar BN strengthen the immobilization of polysulfides via both physical confinement and chemical interaction. Moreover, the highly exposed active surface area and intentionally created N&#8208;vacancy sites substantially promote reaction kinetics by lowering the energy barriers of the rate&#8208;limiting steps. After incorporating with conductive carbon networks and elemental S, the as&#8208;prepared S/Nv&#8208;BN@CBC cathode of LSBs deliver an initial discharge capacity of up to 1347&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 200&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1, while maintaining a low decay rate of 0.03&#8201;% per cycle over 1000&#8197;cycles at 1600&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1. This work offers an effective strategy to mitigate the shuttle effect and highlights the significant potential of defect&#8208;engineered BN in accelerating the reaction kinetics of LSBs.

         <title>A Peptide Strategy for Inhibiting Different Protein Aggregation Pathways</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
General peptide inhibitors of protein aggregation were developed by discovering the molecular determinants of inherent anti&#8208;aggregation activity. Substitutions maximizing &#960;&#8208;stacking, H&#8208;bonding and flexibility further enhanced the potency of natural inhibitors. So&#8208;designed peptides potently inhibited unrelated proteins aggregating via different mechanisms ranging from amorphous aggregation to Tau and Huntingtin amyloid aggregation.







Abstract
Protein aggregation correlates with many human diseases. Protein aggregates differ in structure and shape. Strategies to develop effective aggregation inhibitors that reach the clinic failed so far. Here, we developed a family of peptides targeting early aggregation stages for both amorphous and fibrillar aggregates of proteins unrelated in sequence and structure. They act on dynamic precursors before mechanistic differentiation takes place. Using peptide arrays, we first identified peptides inhibiting the amorphous aggregation of a molten globular, aggregation&#8208;prone mutant of the Axin tumor suppressor. Optimization revealed that the peptides activity did not depend on their sequences but rather on their molecular determinants: a composition of 20&#8211;30&#8201;% flexible, 30&#8211;40&#8201;% aliphatic and 20&#8211;30&#8201;% aromatic residues, a hydrophobicity/hydrophilicity ratio close to 1, and an even distribution of residues of different nature throughout the sequence. The peptides also suppressed fibrillation of Tau, a disordered protein that forms amyloids in Alzheimer's disease, and slowed down that of Huntingtin Exon1, an amyloidogenic protein in Huntington's disease, both entirely unrelated to Axin. Our compounds thus target early stages of different aggregation mechanisms, inhibiting both amorphous and amyloid aggregation.

     alt="A Peptide Strategy for Inhibiting Different Protein Aggregation Pathways"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;General peptide inhibitors of protein aggregation were developed by discovering the molecular determinants of inherent anti-aggregation activity. Substitutions maximizing &#960;-stacking, H-bonding and flexibility further enhanced the potency of natural inhibitors. So-designed peptides potently inhibited unrelated proteins aggregating via different mechanisms ranging from amorphous aggregation to Tau and Huntingtin amyloid aggregation.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Protein aggregation correlates with many human diseases. Protein aggregates differ in structure and shape. Strategies to develop effective aggregation inhibitors that reach the clinic failed so far. Here, we developed a family of peptides targeting early aggregation stages for both amorphous and fibrillar aggregates of proteins unrelated in sequence and structure. They act on dynamic precursors before mechanistic differentiation takes place. Using peptide arrays, we first identified peptides inhibiting the amorphous aggregation of a molten globular, aggregation-prone mutant of the Axin tumor suppressor. Optimization revealed that the peptides activity did not depend on their sequences but rather on their molecular determinants: a composition of 20&#8211;30&#8201;% flexible, 30&#8211;40&#8201;% aliphatic and 20&#8211;30&#8201;% aromatic residues, a hydrophobicity/hydrophilicity ratio close to 1, and an even distribution of residues of different nature throughout the sequence. The peptides also suppressed fibrillation of Tau, a disordered protein that forms amyloids in Alzheimer's disease, and slowed down that of Huntingtin Exon1, an amyloidogenic protein in Huntington's disease, both entirely unrelated to Axin. Our compounds thus target early stages of different aggregation mechanisms, inhibiting both amorphous and amyloid aggregation. Such cross-mechanistic, multi-targeting aggregation inhibitors may be lead compounds for developing drug candidates against various protein aggregation diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Water&#8208;Stable, Eight&#8208;electron Acceptor Drives Anion&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Water Assisted Tunable Ionic Self&#8208;Assembly and Proton Conduction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly electron&#8208;deficient, water&#8208;stable, eight&#8208;electron acceptor scaffold has been used as a platform to realize proton conduction through ionic self&#8208;assembly. In this unique self&#8208;assembled material, 1D water tapes are revealed, that undergo hydrogen&#8208;bonding with halide anions, thereby generating a pathway for anion&#8208;assisted, tunable proton conduction.







Abstract
Organic &#960;&#8208;scaffolds are being envisaged for new&#8208;age electron&#8208; and ion&#8208;responsive materials that can accumulate electrons as well as transport proton. However, such systems are extremely rare as electron&#8208;deficient scaffolds are unstable in aqueous solution. Here we detail the synthesis of a water&#8208;stable core&#8208;naphthalenediimide&#8208;nitrobenzyl&#8208;viologen based tetra&#8208;cation, which accumulates up to eight&#8208;electrons within an exceptionally narrow potential window of +0.05&#8197;V and &#8722;1.12&#8197;V. The supramolecular interactions and the ensuing ionic framework are tunable based on the three anions, e.&#8201;g., Cl&#8722;, Br&#8722; and PF6&#8722;, that are investigated in this work. The ionic framework is formed and supported by a range of H&#8208;bonds, in which, the nitro benzyl groups act as pillars connecting the 1D water&#8208;tapes and the halide anions. The water molecules are hydrogen&#8208;bonded with the halide anions and bestow a facile pathway for the proton conduction, with proton conductivity up to 3.19&#215;10&#8722;3&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1. In contrast, the ionic assembly formed by the lipophilic PF6&#8722; anions do not host the water tapes and consequently the proton conductivity is found to be four orders of magnitude lower. This is a unique example, whereby proton conductivity is realized and is tunable within a highly electron&#8208;deficient, eight&#8208;electron acceptor, water&#8208;stable ionic supramolecular system.

         <title>Modular Synthesis of Azines Bearing a Guanidine Core from N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene (NHC)&#8208;Derived Selenoureas and Diazo Reagents</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The present study introduces a novel transformation between N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene&#8208;derived selenoureas and diazo compounds in the presence of triphenylphosphine. Products incorporating both an azine and a guanidine moiety are obtained, with potential applications in pharmaceuticals, materials chemistry, and organic synthesis.







Abstract
N&#8208;Heterocyclic carbene (NHC)&#8208;derived selenoureas comprise a fundamentally important class of NHC derivatives, with key applications in coordination chemistry and the determination of NHC electronic properties. Considering the broad reactivity of chalcogen&#8208;containing compounds, it is surprising to note that the use of NHC&#8208;derived selenoureas as organic synthons remains essentially unexplored. The present contribution introduces a novel, straightforward transformation leading to azines bearing a guanidine moiety, through the reaction of a wide range of NHC&#8208;derived selenoureas with commercially available diazo compounds, in the presence of triphenylphosphine. This transformation offers a new approach to such products, having biological, materials chemistry, and organic synthesis applications. The guanidine&#8208;bearing azines are obtained in excellent yields, with all manipulations taking place in air. A reaction mechanism is proposed, based on both experimental mechanistic findings and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. A one&#8208;pot, multicomponent transesterification reaction between selenoureas, &#945;&#8208;diazoesters, alcohols, and triphenylphosphine was also developed, providing highly functionalized azines.

         <title>Self&#8208;Replication Without Hydrogen&#8208;Bonds: An Exobiotic Design</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Exobiotic self&#8208;replication: When sulfur is positioned between the two nitrogens of benzothiadiazole, it can engage in edge&#8208;on molecular recognition events. We present a new potential self&#8208;replicating system based on this interaction, and evidence for autocatalysis. The designs have implications for exobiology, due to their cosmic similarities and potential for genetic capacity.







Abstract
Life on Earth uses DNA as the central template for self&#8208;replication, genetic encoding, and information transfer. However, there are no physical laws precluding life's existence elsewhere in space, and alternative life forms may not need DNA. In the search for exobiology, knowing what to look for as a biosignature remains a challenge &#8211; especially if it is not from the obvious list of biologic building blocks. Clues from chemicals recently discovered on Mars and in the Taurus Molecular Cloud 1 (TMC&#8208;1), show that intriguing organic compounds exist beyond Earth, which could provide a starting point for unconventional exobiotic designs. Here we present a new potential self&#8208;replicating system with structural similarities to recently discovered compounds on Mars and TMC&#8208;1. Rather than using DNA's hydrogen&#8208;bonding motif for reliable base&#8208;paring, our design employs sulfur&#8208;nitrogen interactions to selectively template unique benzothiadiazole units in sequence. We synthesized and studied two versions of this system, one reversible and the other irreversible, and found experimental evidence of self&#8208;replication in d&#8208;chloroform solvent. These results are part of a larger pursuit in our lab for developing a basis for a potential exobiological system using starting blocks closely related to these cosmic compounds.

         <title>Synthesis, Characterization and Interconversion of p&#8211;Tolylsulfone&#8208;Functionalized Norbornadiene/Quadricyclane Couples</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A family of new push&#8211;pull functionalized norbornadiene/quadricyclane (NBD/QC) couples was generated and investigated. For the first time the para&#8208;tolylsulfone moiety was chosen as electron&#8208;withdrawing group. The library was comprehensively examined regarding their interconversion capability and photophysical properties.







Abstract
We report the synthesis and characterization of library of new 2,3&#8211;disubstituted norbornadiene/quadricyclane couples. For the first time, the para&#8211;tolylsulfone moiety was employed as electron&#8211;withdrawing substituent in combination with a variety of different electron donors as counterparts. Comprehensive characterization was conducted for every interconversion couple. By comparison with structurally related molecules published before we established the tosyl moiety as suitable alternative to previously investigated ester functionalities by providing similar photophysical properties. The photo&#8211;induced interconversion behavior was investigated via UV/Vis&#8208; and NMR&#8211;spectroscopy. The UV/Vis experiments were carried out exclusively in acetonitrile, whereas several solvents were investigated in the NMR studies. A detailed description and comparison of the isomerization behavior is provided, while examining relevant optical properties like &#955;max and &#955;onset. Thereby, an enhanced red&#8208;shift up to &#955;max=394&#8197;nm combined with an &#955;onset value of 469&#8197;nm could be generated which is necessary for potential applications.

         <title>Redox Transformations of the OX063 Radical in Biological Media: Oxidative Decay of Initial Trityl with Further Formation of Structurally&#8208;Modified TAM</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We studied in details redox reactions of OX063 radical in biological media. These reactions can introduce distortions into EPR oximetry data derived for objects under hypoxia, and they may possibly pose obstacles to the successful application of TAMs to spin&#8208;labeling of biopolymers for experiments in&#8197;vivo or in the cell. The use of 13C labeling to track these reactions is described.







Abstract
Being a low&#8208;toxic and hydrophilic representative of TAM, OX063 has shown its suitability for in&#8208;vivo and in&#8208;cell EPR experiments and design of spin labels. Using 13C labeling, we investigated the course of oxidative degradation of OX063 into quinone&#8208;methide (QM) under the influence of superoxide as well as further thiol&#8208;promoted reduction of QM into TAM radical, which formally corresponds to substitution of a carboxyl function by a hydroxyl group. We found these transformations being quantitative in model reactions mimicking specific features of biological media and confirmed the presence of these reactions in the blood and liver homogenate of mice in&#8197;vitro. The emergence of the trityl with the hydroxyl group can be masked by an initial TAM in EPR spectra and may introduce distortions into EPR&#8208;derived oximetry data if they have been obtained for objects under hypoxia. 13C labeling allows one to detect its presence, considering its different hyperfine splitting constant on 13C1 (2.04&#8197;mT) as compared to OX063 (2.30&#8197;mT). The potential involvement of these reactions should be considered when using TAM in spin&#8208;labeling of biopolymers intended for subsequent EPR experiments, as well as in the successful application of TAM in experiments in&#8197;vivo and in cell.

         <title>Quantitative Characterization of RCA&#8208;Based DNA Hydrogels &#8211; Towards Rational Materials Design</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The impact of template sequences and reaction conditions on the synthesis of DNA hydrogels via Rolling Circle Amplification (RCA) was systematically investigated. The employed methodology is high&#8208;throughput capable and facilitates the development of sequence&#8208;property relationships by correlating reaction process parameters with synthesis efficiency and mechanical material properties.







Abstract
DNA hydrogels hold significant promise for biomedical applications and can be synthesized through enzymatic Rolling Circle Amplification (RCA). Due to the exploratory nature of this emerging field, standardized RCA protocols specifying the impact of reaction parameters are currently lacking. This study varied template sequences and reagent concentrations, evaluating RCA synthesis efficiency and hydrogel mechanical properties through quantitative PCR (qPCR) and indentation measurements, respectively. Primer concentration and stabilizing additives showed minimal impact on RCA efficiency, while changes in polymerase and nucleotide concentrations had a stronger effect. Concentration of the circular template exerted the greatest influence on RCA productivity. An exponential correlation between hydrogel viscosity and DNA amplicon concentration was observed, with nucleobase sequence significantly affecting both amplification efficiency and material properties, particularly through secondary structures. This study suggests that combining high&#8208;throughput experimental methods with structural folding prediction offers a viable approach for systematically establishing structure&#8208;property relationships, aiding the rational design of DNA hydrogel material systems.

         <title>Adsorption of Prochiral Solvent Molecules by Surface&#8208;Confined Chiral Supramolecular Assemblies: How Solvent Impacts on&#8208;Surface Chirality</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Adsorption of a prochiral solvent molecule in porous SAMNs formed by a chiral dehydrobenzo[12]annulene derivative leads to the reversal of supramolecular chirality of the SAMN through the prochirality recognition of a solvent molecule.







Abstract
The understanding of supramolecular chirality in self&#8208;assembled molecular networks (SAMNs) on surfaces generates a lot of interest because of its relation to the production of chiral sensors, reactors, and catalysts. We herein report the adsorption of a prochiral solvent molecule in porous SAMNs formed by a chiral dehydrobenzo[12]annulene (cDBA) derivative. Through the prochirality recognition of a solvent molecule, the supramolecular chirality of the SAMN is switched: the cDBA exclusively forms a counter&#8208;clockwise pore through co&#8208;adsorption of the solvent molecule in prochiral 1,2,4&#8208;trichlorobenzene, while in 1&#8208;phenyloctane it produces the opposite chiral, clockwise pore. The prochirality recognition of the solvent molecule in the chiral SAMN pores is attributed to the adaptable conformational changes of the chiral chains of the cDBA molecule.

         <title>Oxidative N&#8722;N Bond Formation Versus the Curtius Rearrangement</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present herein some experimental results, including NMR and x&#8208;ray, which have led to the recent retraction of a Nature Communications article claiming to feature a metal&#8208;free cross&#8208;dehydrogenative N&#8722;N coupling of primary amides with amines under the action of a hypervalent iodine oxidant. These findings should help the chemical research community to avoid such pitfalls in the future.







Abstract
The oxidative formation of N&#8722;N bonds from primary amides has been recently reported and then retracted in the journal Nature Communications by Kathiravan, Nicholls, and co&#8208;authors, utilizing a hypervalent iodane reagent. Unfortunately, the authors failed to recognize the Curtius reaction taking place under the described reaction conditions. Thus, the claimed N&#8722;N coupling products were not formed. Instead, the Curtius rearrangement urea coupling products were obtained. We demonstrate this herein by means of NMR and x&#8208;ray analysis, as well as with the support of an alternative synthetic route.

         <title>Decarboxylative Alkylation of Carboxylic Acids with Easily Oxidizable Functional Groups Catalyzed by an Imidazole&#8208;Coordinated Fe3 Cluster under Visible Light Irradiation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Decarboxylative alkylation of carboxylic acids with easily oxidizable functional groups such as phenol and indole functionalities was achieved using a catalytic amount of basic iron(III) acetate, Fe(OAc)2(OH), in the presence of benzimidazole under 427 nm LED irradiation. Kinetic analyses of this catalytic reaction revealed that the reaction rate is first&#8208;order in alkenes and is linearly correlated with the light intensity; the faster reaction rate for the benzimidazole&#8208;ligated species was consistent with the increased absorbance in the visible light region. Wide functional group tolerance for the easily oxidizable groups is ascribed to the weak oxidation ability of the in situ&#8208;generated oxo&#8208;bridged iron clusters compared with other iron(III) species.</dc:description>

         <title>Harnessing Gene Editing Technology for Tumor Microenvironment Modulation: An Emerging Anticancer Strategy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cancer is a multifaceted disease influenced by both intrinsic cellular traits and extrinsic factors, with the tumor microenvironment (TME) being crucial in its progression. To satisfy their high proliferation and aggressiveness, cancer cell always plunders large amounts of nutrition and releases various signals to the surrounding, forming a dynamic TME with special metabolic, immune, microbial and physical characteristics. Due to the neglect of interactions between tumor cell and TME, traditional cancer therapies often struggle with challenges such as drug resistance, low efficacy, and recurrence. Importantly, with the development of gene editing technologies, particularly the CRISPR&#8208;Cas system, offers promising new strategies for cancer treatment. Combined with nanomaterials strategies, CRISPR&#8208;Cas technology exhibits precision, affordability, and user&#8208;friendliness with reduced side effects, which holds great promise for profoundly altering the TME at a genetic level, potentially leading to lasting anticancer outcomes. This review will delve into how CRISPR&#8208;Cas can be leveraged to manipulate the TME, examining its potential as a transformative anticancer therapy.</dc:description>

         <title>Formation to Transportation: En&#8208;Route Fission&#8208;Facilitated Formation of Spheres in a Phosphorus&#8208;Based Porous Organic Polymer for Transportation of Iodine</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Despite its potential as a clean power source to meet rising electricity demands, nuclear energy generates radioactive waste, including isotopes of iodine, that pose significant environmental and health risks. There is a growing demand to capture radioactive iodine and repurpose it effectively. However, achieving this dual functionality with a single material remains a significant challenge. This study explores phosphorus&#8208;based porous organic polymers (P&#8208;POPs) as probes for these dual functionalities. By employing 4&#8208;formyl(triphenyl)phosphine (BB1) and phenyl&#8208;1,4&#8208;diacetonitrile (BB2) under the Knoevenagel polycondensation method, P&#8208;POPs (PKPOPs) have been synthesized that exhibit a smooth spherical morphology, which efficiently captures and release iodine under ambient conditions, facilitating efficient transportation of molecular iodine. This novel approach aims to potentially transform nuclear waste into valuable organic feedstock via an iodination reaction. The innovative application of PKPOP has also been demonstrated for iodination reactions using ball mills and under continuous flow conditions, showcasing its potential for safer waste management and utilization.</dc:description>

         <title>Dynamic Phase Behavior of Surface&#8208;Active Fluorinated Ionic Liquid Epoxidation Catalysts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report on the synthesis of amphiphobic fluorinated surface&#8208;active ionic liquid (FSAIL) epoxidation catalysts, which show reversible temperature&#8208;controlled solubility in water. The solubility of FSAILs containing the catalytically active perrhenate&#8208; and tungstate anions was studied in both the aqueous and the substrate phase, showing a significant solubility decrease in both media compared to their non&#8208;fluorinated congeners. It was shown that both the epoxide product and the catalyst additive phenylphosphonic acid (PPA) are efficient in transferring the FSAIL catalyst into the organic phase, rendering the reaction homogeneous. The FSAILs were used as catalysts for the epoxidation of olefins using aqueous H2O2 as oxidant, showing an exceptionally high catalytic activity at mild conditions. Catalyst recycling was demonstrated over ten consecutive runs by phase separation and subsequent product distillation.</dc:description>

         <title>A Strongly Ambiphilic Ferrocene&#8208;Based Cyclic (Alkyl)(amino)carbene &#8211; Specific Decomposition to an Enamine by a 1,2&#8208;Phenyl Shift</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The recently described crystalline cyclic (alkyl)(amino)carbene with a 1,1&#8217;&#8208;ferrocenylene (fc) backbone fc(CPh2&#8211;C&#8211;NMes) (A, Mes = mesityl) is highly reactive due to its particularly pronounced ambiphilicity and is thermally not stable in solution due to an intramolecular insertion of the divalent carbon atom into a methyl C&#8211;H bond of the Mes substituent. The closely related congener fc(CPh2&#8211;C&#8211;N&#8208;p&#8208;C6H4&#8208;tBu) (1) cannot undergo such an insertion reaction. Nevertheless, 1 is too short&#8208;lived for isolation due to a rapid 1,2&#8208;shift of a phenyl group, furnishing the isomeric cyclic enamine fc[C(Ph)=C(Ph)&#8211;N&#8208;p&#8208;C6H4&#8208;tBu] (1&#8217;) in a specific decomposition process unprecedented for CAACs. Trapping of 1 was possible with carbon monoxide, elemental selenium and with [CuBr(SMe2)], respectively affording the aminoketene 1=C=O, the selenoamide 1=Se and the homoleptic CuI complex [Cu(1)2][CuBr2]. 1 is an even stronger ambiphile than A according to NMR spectroscopic data. Similar to A, 1 does not react with H2, because the experimentally observed intramolecular process is kinetically more favourable according to DFT results.</dc:description>

         <title>Manipulating the Substituent Sphere of a Bicyclic Silicon(I) Ring Compound Results in Anionic Cubane&#8208;Type Clusters and a Tetrahedral Silanide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The reaction of the bicyclic silicon(I) ring compound Si4{N(SiMe3)Mes}4 1 with strong zwitterionic character and moderate sterical demand of the amido substituents with two equivalents of KC8 was investigated. This resulted in the unexpected abstraction of two amido substituents from 1 and additionally in dimerization to a dianionic Si8 cluster compound 2 with four unsubstituted silicon atoms and two [K([18]crown&#8208;6)]+ counter cations. Performing this reaction in the absence of [18]crown&#8208;6 results in release of only one amido substituent from 1 and dimerization to a dianionic Si8 cluster compound 3 with only two unsubstituted silicon atoms. This reaction with KC8 was repeated and trapping agents such as SiMe3Cl and tBuCl were added in&#8208;situ whereupon the second isolated homocyclic silylene 4 and a monoanionic hydride and tBu substituted Si8 cluster 5 with one unsubstituted silicon atom were isolated. Furthermore, 1 was reacted with KOtBu which resulted in the selective abstraction of one SiMe3 group and formation of the tetrahedral silanide 6 with one imido substituent bridging an edge of the tetrahedron.</dc:description>

         <title>Secondary Sphere Lewis Acid Activated Heme Superoxo Adducts Mimic Crucial Non&#8208;Covalent Interactions in IDO/TDO Heme Dioxygenases</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Heme enzymes play a central role in a medley of reactivities within a wide variety of crucial biological systems. Their active sites are highly decorated with pivotal evolutionarily optimized non&#8208;covalent interactions that precisely choreograph their biological functionalities with specific regio&#8208;, stereo&#8208;, and chemo&#8208;selectivities. Gaining a clear comprehension of how such weak interactions within the active sites control reactivity offers powerful information to be implemented into the design of future therapeutic agents that target these heme enzymes. To shed light on such critical details pertaining to tryptophan dioxygenating heme enzymes, this study investigates the indole dioxygenation reactivities of Lewis acid&#8208;activated heme superoxo model systems, wherein an unprecedented kinetic behavior is revealed. In that, the activated heme superoxo adduct is observed to undergo indole dioxygenation with the intermediacy of a non&#8208;covalently organized precursor complex, which forms prior to the rate&#8208;limiting step of the overall reaction landscape. Spectroscopic and theoretical characterization of this precursor complex draws close parallels to the ternary complex of heme dioxygenases, which has been postulated to be of crucial importance for successful 2,3&#8208;dioxygenative cleavage of indole moieties.</dc:description>

         <title>Sterically&#8208;Hindered Derivatives of Pentacene and Octafluoropentacene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>6,13&#8208;Diethynylpentacene derivatives with sterically bulky substituents (Tr*, tris(3,5&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butylphenyl)methyl groups) appended to the ethynyl moieties at the 6&#8208; and 13&#8208;positions have been synthesized, as well as derivatives with electron withdrawing fluorine groups on the eight pro&#8208;cata positions. These molecules are designed to investigate relationships between steric and electronic effects on the stability of pentacene toward endoperoxide formation via reaction with photosensitized oxygen in solution under conditions of ambient light (i.e., &#8216;laboratory&#8217; conditions). It is evident from the study that stabilization through changes to the electronic characteristics of pentacene are more effective than the incorporation of sterically bulky groups at the acetylenic termini. Selected pentacene derivatives have been made into binary, amorphous films with the fullerene derivative PCBM to investigate the stability imparted by substituents against cycloaddition reactions. Overall, the introduction of steric protection through incorporation of Tr* groups is not an efficient strategy for enhancing persistence of pentacenes. Stabilization through fluorination proves successful for extending the lifetime of the pentacene derivatives by an order of magnitude in solution. Notably, the persistence of pentacene derivatives in solution can also be enhanced through the use ethereal solvents stabilized with butylated hydroxy toluene (BHT) and/or an increased number of trialkylsilyl groups as substituents.</dc:description>

         <title>Design of an Electrochemical Cell for Continuous Wave EPR Measurements of Radical Ions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The combination of continuous wave electron paramagnetic resonance (cw&#8208;EPR) with electrochemistry is highly attractive as it allows a clean in&#8208;situ generation and the subsequent spectroscopic characterisation of radical ions, which are important intermediates in many photocatalytic cycles as well as light&#8208;induced processes occurring in biological systems or optoelectronic devices. Although commercial setups for spectroelectrochemical EPR are available, they are often expensive and tailored to a particular spectroscopic setup.&#160;
Here we present a design for a low&#8208;cost electrochemical EPR cell that can be used in combination with any commercial cw&#8208;EPR instrumentation. The cell design is compared to existing setups and the performance of the cell is evaluated by comparison of EPR spectra obtained by chemical and electrochemical oxidation of a graphene fragment.</dc:description>

         <title>Investigation of Neighboring Group Participation in 3,4&#8208;Diacetylated Glycosyl Donors in the Gas Phase</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A key challenge in oligosaccharide synthesis is the stereoselective installation of glycosidic bonds. Each glycosidic linkage has one of two possible stereo&#8208;chemical geometries, &#945;/&#946; or 1,2&#8208;cis/trans. An established approach to install 1,2&#8208;trans glycosidic bonds is neighboring group participation (NGP), mediated by a 2&#8208;O&#8208;acyl group. Extension of this intramolecular stabilization to nucleophilic groups located at more remote positions has also been suggested, but remains poorly understood. Previously, we employed infrared ion spectroscopy to characterize the molecular ions of monoacetylated sugar donors and showed how the strength of the stabilizing effect depends on the position of the participating ester group on the glycosyl donor ring as well as on its relative stereochemistry. In this work, we investigated glycosyl donors carrying two acyl groups. Using isotope labelling and isomer population analysis we were able to resolving spectra of isomeric mixtures and establish the relative contribution of individual species. We conclude that 3,4&#8208;diacetyl mannosyl donors exclusively form a dioxanium ion as a result of C&#8208;3 acyl stabilization. In contrast, the glucosyl and galactosyl cations form mixtures of C&#8208;3 and C&#8208;4 acyl participation products. Hence, the combination of isotope labeling and population analysis allows for the study of increasingly complex glycosyl cations.</dc:description>

         <title>Adjusting the Number of Functional Groups in Vicinal Bis(trichlorosilylated) Benzenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organo(chloro)silanes are essential chemicals, but the synthesis of compounds of the formula RnSiCl4&#8210;n with defined values of n is usually laborious. Herein, we first disclose that a [4+2]&#8208;cycloaddition between readily available Cl3SiC&#8801;CSiCl3 and selected dienes provides facile access to vicinal bis(trichlorosilylated) benzenes and bicyclo[2.2.2]octa&#8208;2,5&#8208;dienes. Second, we show how the number of six Si&#8210;Cl bonds in 1,2&#8208;(Cl3Si)2C6H2Me2 (1) can be selectively reduced to four or two by reaction with pinacol (H2pin) or catechol (H2cat), which act as Si&#183;&#183;&#183;Si&#8217;&#8208;bridging and/or Si&#8208;chelating ligands. Third, we demonstrate that the thermolysis of compound 6, which contains a benzannulated eight&#8208;membered C2(SiCl2)2(&#956;&#8208;pin) ring with Si&#183;&#183;&#183;Si&#8217;&#8208;bridging pin moiety, furnishes 13 with a benzannulated five&#8208;membered C2(SiCl2)2O ring via the release of pinacolone. Such cyclic disiloxanes are valuable building blocks for specialty silicones; an alternative assembly of the Si&#8210;O&#8210;Si unit by controlled hydrolysis of 1 is not feasible if the four valuable Si&#8210;Cl functionalities are to be retained for further derivatization. Substitution of one Cl atom per Si site of 13 gives the rac&#8208;1,3&#8208;disila&#8208;2&#8208;oxaindane rac&#8208;15 with high selectivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Differential Sensing Approach as a Pattern&#8208;based Discrimination for Biological Samples</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The differential sensing approach uses fingerprint patterning to distinguish uncharacterized biological samples. Inspired by natural sensory systems, an array of cross&#8208;reactive sensors generates unique response fingerprint depending on the samples. Until today, this array system has been developed using various materials, including the library of surface&#8208;charged nanoparticles and chemosensors. Many differential array systems have demonstrated accurate identification of bacterial species, viral subtypes, and cancer cells, as well as distinguishing disease states in blood or urine. This capability is particularly important for distinguishing between normal and abnormal states when specific marker molecules have not yet been identified, providing a powerful diagnostic tool. In this concept, we summarized representative outcomes of differential sensing applications for biological sample discrimination.</dc:description>

         <title>Deciphering the cell surface sugar&#8208;coating via Biochemical Pathways</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cell surface components, specifically glycans, play a significant role in several biological functions like cell structure, crosstalk between cells, and eventual target recognition of the cells for therapeutics. The dense layer of glycans, i.e., glycocalyx, could differ in taxon, species, and cell type. Glycans are coupled with lipids and proteins to form glycolipids, glycoproteins, proteoglycans, and glycosylphosphatidylinositol&#8208;anchored proteins, making their study challenging. However, understanding glycosylation at the cellular level is vital for fundamental research and the advancement of glycan&#8208;targeted therapy. Among different pathways, metabolic glycan labelling uses the natural metabolic processes of the cell to introduce abiotic functionality into glycan residues. The Bertozzi group pioneered metabolic oligosaccharide engineering using glycan salvage pathways to convert monosaccharides with unnatural modifications. This eventually results in the probe becoming part of the complex cellular glycan structures via click chemistry using copper. On the other hand, the boronic acid&#8208;based probe can recognise carbohydrates in a single step without any chemical modification of the surface. This review discusses the significance of glycans as biomarkers for different diseases and the necessity to evaluate them in situ within the physiological environment. The review also discusses the prospect of this field and its potential applications.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this study, we disclose for the first time that formate salt can be used as a bifunctional reagent for the synthesis of phenol derivatives and as a CO source for carbonylative cross&#8208;coupling processes using the COware gas reactor under activation free conditions. Key to this success is the in&#8208;situ synthesis of aryl formate via an unprecedented nickel/organophotocatalyst system under blue LED irradiation. This developed system demonstrated high applicability to various aryl iodide substrates for synthesizing phenol derivatives. Moreover, the generated CO could be utilized in a range of carbonylative C&#8208;heteroatom and C&#8208;C processes. Notably, commercially available H13COONa salt can serve as a bifunctional reagent for both synthesizing phenols and generating 13CO.</dc:description>

         <title>Conformation Regulation of Trisresorcinarene Directed by Cavity Solvation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This compound is a synthetic macrocycle comprising three pivaloyl&#8208;protected resorcinarene units connected by six pentylene chains. We conducted a conformational study using 1H&#8208;NMR, X&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD), and computational analyses. The macrocycle adopts two conformers, one open, the other closed. The ratio of the open to closed forms depended on the solvent used. Only the open form existed in [D8]toluene, both forms coexisted in [D6]benzene, and the closed form was the major conformer in [D1]chloroform. The benzene&#8208;solvated open form observed in the solid state suggests that cavity solvation by solvent molecules directs the open form. The open form was the major or only conformer in [D10]o&#8208; and [D10]m&#8208;xylene and [D12]mesitylene, whereas the closed form was the major conformer in [D6]acetone. The open and closed forms were equally populated in [D10]p&#8208;xylene, suggesting that the size, shape, and dimensions of the solvent molecules most likely influenced the conformation of the protected trisresocinarene.</dc:description>

The benzene-solvated open form observed in the solid state suggests that cavity solvation by solvent molecules directs the open form. The open form was the major or only conformer in [D10]o- and [D10]m-xylene and [D12]mesitylene, whereas the closed form was the major conformer in [D6]acetone. The open and closed forms were equally populated in [D10]p-xylene, suggesting that the size, shape, and dimensions of the solvent molecules most likely influenced the conformation of the protected trisresocinarene.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Catalytic Generation of Benzyl Anions from Aryl Ketones Utilizing [1,2]&#8208;Phospha&#8208;Brook Rearrangement and Their Application to Synthesis of Tertiary Benzylic Alcohols</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A synthetic method of tertiary alcohols was developed based on the formal umpolung addition of aryl ketones with electrophiles utilizing the [1,2]&#8208;phospha&#8208;Brook rearrangement under Br&#248;nsted base catalysis. The addition reaction of &#945;&#8208;hydroxyphosphonates, derived from alkyl aryl&#8208; and diaryl ketones, with electrophiles such as phenyl vinyl sulfone, afforded phosphates having a tertiary alkyl group, which were readily convertible to the corresponding tertiary benzylic alcohols. This operationally simple protocol provides efficient complementary access to tertiary alcohols that are difficult to synthesize by conventional methods.</dc:description>

         <title>Access to diverse carbonyl compounds by catalyst&#8208;free and photoinduced aerobic cleavage of C=N bonds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Functional group interconversion is of great significance in organic synthesis. However, aerobic cleavage of C=N bonds to access carbonyl compounds still suffered from some limitations such as harsh reaction conditions, stoichiometric oxidants, poor substrate scope and use of toxic reagents. Herein, we report a catalyst&#8208;free and photo&#8208;induced aerobic cleavage of C=N bonds to afford diverse carbonyl compounds using oxygen from air as green oxidant. This mild methodology permits N&#8208;tosylhydrazones converted into the corresponding carbonyl compounds including ketones, amides, aldehydes and carboxylic acids, showing broad functional group tolerance and compatibility. Moreover, the gram&#8208;scale reaction and post&#8208;modification of complicated molecules proved the applicability and efficiency of this strategy. Finally, a plausible mechanism was proposed based on spectroscopic investigations and detailed mechanistic studies.</dc:description>

         <title>Ferrocenyl Dithiophosphonate Ag(I) Complexes: Synthesis, Structures, Luminescence, and Electrocatalytic Water Splitting Tuned by Nuclearity and Ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The heterometallic [Ag(I)/Fe(II)] molecular electrocatalysts for hydrogen production were introduced here to recognize the mutual role of metallic nuclearity and ligand engineering. A series of ferrocenyl dithiophosphonate stabilized mononuclear [Ag(PPh3)2{S2PFc(OR)}] {where R = Me (1), Et (2), nPr (3), iPr (4), iAmyl (5); Fc = Fe (&#627;5&#8208;C5H4)(&#627;5&#8208;C5H5) } and dinuclear [Ag(PPh3){S2PFc(OR}]2 {where R = Et (2a), and nPr (3a)} complexes were synthesized and characterized by SCXRD, NMR (31P and 1H), ESI&#8208;MS, UV&#8208;Vis, and FT&#8208;IR spectroscopy. The comparative electrocatalytic HER behavior of 1&#8722;5 and 2a&#8722;3a showed effective current density of 1 mA/cm2 with overpotentials ranging from 772 to 991 mV, demonstrating the influence of extended and branched carbon chains in dithiophosphonates and metallic (mono&#8208;/di&#8208;) nuclearity, which correlates with documented tetra&#8208;nuclear [Ag4(S2PFc(OnPr)4], 6. DFT study suggests the coordinated (&#956;1&#8208;S) site of ligands is the reactivity center and the adsorption energy of intermediate [H*&#8208;SM] varies with the engineering of ligand and nuclearity. A catalytic mechanism using mononuclear (1) and di&#8208;nuclear (2a) was proposed with the assistance of DFT. Each complex, being the first example of Ag(I) dithiophosphonates, exhibits intense photoluminescence with high quantum yields ranging from 33% to 67%. These results link the lower nuclearity structures to their physical and catalytic properties.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>&#960;&#8208;Electronic molecules with a BN&#8208;heterocyclic and carbon&#8208;based aromatic hybrid ring system (h&#8208;CBN) are interesting in that they potentially exhibit synergistic properties arising from the two different &#960;&#8208;systems. Here we report the synthesis and properties of a h&#8208;CBN&#8208;type molecule (1) having a bicyclic B4N4&#8208;heteropentalene core fused with extended aromatic rings. This molecule exhibits excellent chemical stability despite the absence of bulky substituents for kinetic protection, which in turn provides effective stacking of the &#960;&#8208;system upon crystallization. Depending on the crystallization solvent, 1 forms two polymorphs, i.e., the &#945;&#8208; and &#946;&#8208;phases. While both phases have one&#8208;dimensional columnar structures, the &#960;&#8208;stacking geometries associated with the transfer integrals of the frontier orbitals are different, resulting in a twofold difference in the electrical conducting properties. We also found that upon thermal vacuum deposition, 1 gives an amorphous film, which serves as a host material for a red phosphorescent OLED device (maximum external quantum efficiency: 15.5 and 13.3% at 0.1 and 2.5 mA, respectively).</dc:description>

         <title>Complexes of a Frustrated Lewis Pair&#8208;Supported P(&#8211;1) Ligand</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Several complexes of the intramolecular frustrated Lewis pair (FLP)&#8208;supported P(&#8211;1) ligand [iPr2P(C6H4)BCy2{P}]&#8211; are presented (Cy = cyclohexyl). Chief among these is the first example of a monomeric zinc bis(phosphido) complex, which was synthesized as a potential precursor for the solution&#8208;phase deposition of Zn3P2. While this goal was ultimately unsuccessful, the Zn(II) complex acts as a convenient springboard to other metal phosphide species via transmetallation: namely, a tellurium bis(phosphido) and a formal adduct of the phosphorus subhalide PPCl2. Trapping experiments show that the PPCl2 adduct can also be prepared directly through the in situ reduction of PCl3 in the presence of an intramolecular FLP ligand. Lastly, we report a formal &#951;2&#8208;phosphaborene complex of cobalt(&#8208;1) which is isoelectronic to olefin complexes, and explore its bonding via density functional theory (DFT) computations.</dc:description>

         <title>Research Progress on Ni&#8208;based Electrocatalysts for Electrochemical Reduction of Nitrogen to Ammonia</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The electrochemical NRR&#160;to synthesize ammonia&#160;is considered as a promising method due to its approvable advantages of zero&#8208;pollution emission, feasible reaction proceedings, good safety and easy management. The multiple efforts have been devoted to the exploration of earth&#8208;abundant&#8208;element&#8208;based nanomaterials as high&#8208;efficiency electrocatalysts for realizing their industrial applications. Among these, the Ni&#8208;based nanomaterials is prioritized as an attractive non&#8208;noble&#8208;metal electrocatalysts for catalyzing NRR because they are earth&#8208;abundance and exceedingly easy to synthesize as well as also delivers the potential of high electrocatalytic activity and durability. In this review, after briefly elucidating the underlying mechanisms of NRR during the electrochemical process, we systematically sum up the recent research progress in representative Ni&#8208;based electrocatalysts, including monometallic Ni&#8208;based nanomaterials, bimetallic Ni&#8208;based nanomaterials, polymetallic Ni&#8208;based nanomaterials, etc. In particular, we discuss the effects of physicochemical properties, such as phases, crystallinity, morphology, composition, defects, heteroatom doping, and strain engineering, on the comprehensive performance of the abovementioned electrocatalysts, with the aim of establishing the nanostructure&#8208;function relationships of the electrocatalysts. In addition, the promising directions of Ni&#8208;based electrocatalysts for NRR are also pointed out and highlighted. The generic approach in this review may expand the frontiers of NRR and provides the inspiration for developing high&#8208;efficiently Ni&#8208;based electrocatalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>&#945;&#8208;Bi2Mo3O12: A Dual&#8208;Functional material for electrocatalytic water splitting and supercapacitor applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This study explores the functionality of &#945;&#8208;Bi2Mo3O12 (BMO) as an electrocatalyst for water splitting and its suitability for supercapacitor applications. BMO was synthesized by the solvothermal method and characterized in pre&#8208;calcination [BMO (BC)], post&#8208;calcination [BMO (AC)], and base&#8208;etched forms [BMO (BE)]. Structural analysis confirmed the formation of &#945;&#8208;Bi2Mo3O12 with well&#8208;defined crystallographic planes. Electrochemical analysis revealed that BMO (AC) exhibited the lowest overpotential for hydrogen evolution reactions (HER) and BMO (BC) exhibited the lowest overpotential for oxygen evolution reactions (OER), indicating its superior electrocatalytic activity. The Tafel slope and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy results confirmed the superior kinetics and charge transfer properties of BMO material. Furthermore, BMO samples demonstrated excellent stability during prolonged chronoamperometry (CA) testing for 12 h. For supercapacitor performances, the BMO (BE) exhibits a superior specific capacitance value of 398 F/g at 2.0 A/g. Thus, the BMO material delivers prominent electrocatalytic activity as well as supercapacitor performance. Overall, this study demonstrates the potentiality of &#945;&#8208;Bi2Mo3O12 in different forms as a dual&#8208;functional material for efficient energy storage and conversion.</dc:description>

         <title>Room&#8208;Temperature Quantum Coherence of Reversible Photo&#8208;generated Radical and Its Film</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electron spin qubits are becoming an important research direction in the field of quantum computing and information storage. However, the quantum decoherence has seriously hindered the development of this field. So far, few qubits exhibit long phase memory time (Tm), and even fewer qubits that can reach room temperature. Some reports show that the coherence times of radicals are generally long, so radicals may be the preferred spin carriers for qubits. Here, we demonstrate the qubit properties of a photogenerated radical (1a) based on 2,4,6&#8208;Tri(4&#8208;pyridyl)&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triazine (tpt, 1). More importantly, the photogenerated radical is a spin self&#8208;diluting complex, which the dilution is generally used in the investigation of qubits to reduce the interference of environment on qubits in order to overcome the decoherence of qubits. It is surprised that radical tpt has a stable Tm = 1.1 &#956;s above 20 K, even keep it to room temperature. In addition, the tpt&#8208;film prepared by the vacuum evaporation is significantly increase the T1 and Tm at low temperature.</dc:description>
