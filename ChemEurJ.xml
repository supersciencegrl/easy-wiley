         <title>Enhancing G&#8208;Quadruplex Binding: Rational Design and Biophysical Evaluation of Dimeric Ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fluorescence thermal shift assays, electrospray ionization&#8208;mass spectrometry, CD spectroscopy, molecular modeling and cytotoxicity assays were enrolled to study the binding of a rationally designed anthraquinone&#8208;based G&#8208;quadruplex binder interacting with the nucleic acid as a molecular tweezer.








ABSTRACT
G&#8208;quadruplexes (G4s) are non&#8208;canonical nucleic acid structures formed by guanine&#8208;rich sequences. Within the human genome, beyond telomeres, G4 motifs have also been found in promoters, implying a potential role in gene regulation that could be achieved through interactions with small&#8208;molecule ligands. In this field, anthraquinone represented a privileged scaffold for the design of G4&#8208;targeting molecules. Additionally, emerging evidence proved that compounds bearing two aromatic cores can offer enhanced affinity and selectivity toward G4s due to cooperative binding in a tweezer&#8208;like fashion. This study reports the rational design and synthesis of anthraquinone&#8208;based building blocks conceived to generate a dimeric ligand connected through a flexible polyethylene glycol (PEG) linker to potentially recognize G4 as molecular tweezers. The interaction of the synthesized compounds with G4 structures has been investigated by biophysical techniques, including fluorescence thermal shift assays, electrospray ionization&#8208;mass spectrometry and circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy, supported by molecular modeling studies. Finally, cytotoxicity assays were performed to evaluate the antiproliferative effects of the new ligands.

         <title>Biocatalytic Strategies for the Synthesis of Atropisomers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Atropisomeric scaffolds are important building blocks in natural products, organocatalysts, metal ligands, and functional materials. This review introduces current developments for synthesizing atropisomers employing biocatalytic kinetic resolution, dynamic kinetic resolution, and desymmetrization strategies.








ABSTRACT
The asymmetric synthesis of atropisomers has garnered extensive attention in recent years. Atropisomers constitute a key structural motif in natural products, chiral ligands, organocatalysts, and functional materials. Despite progress driven by transition&#8208;metal and organocatalysis, inherent limitations in enantioselectivity and sustainability have hampered further development in this field. Alternatively, biocatalysis offers a promising solution employing strategies including (dynamic) kinetic resolution, desymmetrization, and other strategies. These biocatalytic processes operate under mild, environmentally friendly conditions, achieving high stereoselectivity that is often difficult to attain with traditional methods. This review highlights recent advances in the biocatalytic synthesis of atropisomers and offer insights in the development of the relevant field.

         <title>Delivery Routes of Topical Eyedrops Reaching the Posterior Segment of the Eye&#8208;Recent Advances</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review summarizs recent advances in topical eyedrop therapies for ocular fundus diseases, with a focus on their delivery routes and mechanisms by which they reach the posterior segment of eye.The formulations based on the corneal route include emulsomes and dual&#8208;transmembrane peptides, those based on the conjunctival route include PepT&#8208;1 ligands and cell&#8208;penetrating peptides, and those based on dual routes include chitosan, polymer micelles and supramolecular peptides.








ABSTRACT
Current topical eyedrop treatments for posterior segment diseases face significant challenges, including rapid tear clearance and ocular barrier limitations, which hinder effective drug delivery to target tissues in the posterior segment. To date, no eyedrop formulation has been clinically approved for the treatment of ocular fundus diseases. Eyedrops reach the posterior segment via two primary routes: the corneal route and the conjunctival routes, the latter comprising the conjunctival&#8211;vasculature route and the conjunctival&#8211;scleral route. This review summarizes recent advances in topical eyedrop therapies for ocular fundus diseases, with a focus on their delivery routes and the mechanisms by which they reach the posterior segment of eye. The cell&#8208;penetrating homing peptides and lipid nanoparticle&#8208;encapsulated eyedrops primarily reach the posterior segment via the corneal route; cell&#8208;penetrating peptides and PepT&#8208;1&#8208;targeting ligands mainly utilize the conjunctival route; whereas chitosan nanoparticles, polymeric micelles, and supramolecular peptide&#8208;based eyedrops can access the posterior segment via both routes. By systematically clarifying the pathways and mechanisms by which eyedrops formulations traverse ocular barriers, this review aims to provide a rational foundation for future research and development in posterior segment drug delivery.

         <title>Structural Control of RNA Demethylation: G&#8208;Quadruplex Proximity Suppresses ALKBH5 Activity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
RNA G&#8208;quadruplex structures significantly affected the m6A demethylation activity of the RNA demethylase, ALKBH5. The suppression was apparent when m6A was near G&#8208;tetrad cores, and not within the flexible loops. The G&#8208;quadruplex ligand induced G&#8208;quadruplex structure to RNA and suppressed ALKBH5 demethylation activity to nearby m6A. These results suggest that G&#8208;quadruplex RNA serves as a regulatory element in epitranscriptome regulation.








ABSTRACT
RNA modifications and higher&#8208;order structures function as regulatory layers of RNA metabolism beyond sequence context. However, their interplay remains largely unexplored. Among RNA modifications, N6&#8208;methyladenosine (m6A) is the most abundant internal modification in mRNAs, regulated by writer, reader, and eraser proteins; the AlkB family dioxygenases, AlkB homolog 5 (ALKBH5), and fat mass&#8208; and obesity&#8208;associated protein (FTO). In addition, G&#8208;quadruplex RNA is a representative structure involved in key biological processes. This study investigated how G&#8208;quadruplex structures influence the demethylation efficiency of m6A erasers. Using RNAs with m6A positioned adjacent to the G&#8208;tetrad core or within a flexible loop of G&#8208;quadruplex structures, we showed that G&#8208;quadruplex formation markedly suppressed ALKBH5 activity compared with FTO, particularly when m6A was near the G&#8208;tetrad core, such as the HIV&#8208;1 U3&#8208;region G&#8208;quadruplex&#8208;forming sequence. Conversely, m6A within a long, flexible loop, remained accessible to ALKBH5. The G&#8208;quadruplex&#8208;specific ligand BRACO19, which stabilizes G&#8208;quadruplex structures, further confirmed the structural sensitivity of ALKBH5. To our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate a direct link between G&#8208;quadruplex structures and m6A eraser protein activity. These findings highlight the importance of the RNA structural context in regulating m6A erasers and suggest that G&#8208;quadruplexes may serve as regulatory elements in epitranscriptomic control.

         <title>Site&#8208;Specific OaAEP1 Mediated Functional Proteins Immobilization on Magnetic Nanoparticles and the Recyclings</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
ABSTRACT
Precise and stable immobilization of proteins on nanoparticle surfaces is essential for advancing applications in biocatalysis, biosensing, and synthetic biology. However, conventional immobilization strategies often suffer from nonspecific binding, random orientation, and loss of biological activity. Here, a chemically defined, site&#8208;specific protein conjugation strategy is developed using the peptide ligase OaAEP1 to catalyze ligation between N&#8208;terminal Gly&#8208;Leu (GL) and C&#8208;terminal Asn&#8208;Gly&#8208;Leu (NGL) motifs. This approach enables controlled&#8208;orientation and high&#8208;efficiency immobilization of functional proteins and enzymes on Fe3O4 and Fe3O4@SiO2 magnetic nanoparticles. Fluorescent proteins and catalytically active enzymes, including TEV (Tobacco Etch Virus) protease and Taq polymerase, retain activity and recyclability following conjugation. Sequential ligation permits programmable multimeric assembly. This enzymatic platform provides a robust, reusable, and modular route to construct functional protein&#8208;nanoparticle interfaces with broad implications for nanobiotechnology and protein engineering.

         <title>Porous Organic Polymer Constructed From Thiazolo&#8208;Thiazole and Cyclophosphazene as a Heterogeneous Photocatalyst for Visible Light&#8208;Mediated Synthesis of Isatins, Thiocyanoindoles, and Thiocyanoanilines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A porous organic polymer (POP), constructed based on hexaaryloxycyclophosphazene and thiazolo[5,4&#8208;d]thiazole building blocks, is demonstrated as a visible light&#8211;driven, metal&#8208;free heterogeneous photocatalyst for oxidation of indoles to isatins and thiocyanation of indoles and anilines under mild conditions.








Abstract
A porous organic polymer (POP) based on hexakis(4&#8208;formylphenoxy)cyclophosphazene (HFCP), that is, HFCPTzPOP, was synthesized by condensation reaction with dithiooxamide. The polymer is shown to exhibit excellent visible light absorption, enabling its application as a heterogeneous photocatalyst for the conversion of indoles to isatins and 3&#8208;thiocyanoindoles, and selective thiocyanation of anilines at the para position. The photocatalytic reactions occur under mild conditions in oxygen atmosphere without the addition of any toxic metal or oxidizing agent. HFCPTzPOP acts as a photoredox catalyst in oxidative transformations, converting molecular oxygen into singlet oxygen (1O2) and superoxide radical anion (O2&#8226;&#8211;) through energy transfer and electron transfer processes, respectively. It is shown that the photocatalyst can be easily recycled up to 10 cycles without any loss of catalytic activity.

         <title>Diastereoselective Access to 3&#8208;Aminoindanones Through Domino Approach</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
ABSTRACT
A unique intermolecular approach for stereoselective synthesis of 3&#8208;aminoindanones bearing a &#946;&#8208;quaternary carbon from 2&#8208;alkynylacetophenones and anilines has been reported. The catalytic system comprised of silver salt and phosphoric acid effectively transformed a range of 2&#8208;alkynylacetophenones and anilines to corresponding 3&#8208;aminoindanones in moderate to good yields with excellent diastereoselectivity and broad functional group tolerance. Furthermore, scale up and synthetic transformations were carried out to demonstrate the synthetic utility of the developed protocol.

         <title>Convergent Synthesis of Template&#8208;Assembled Synthetic G&#8208;Quartets (TASQs) Used as Biomimetic and Multivalent G&#8208;Quadruplex (G4) Ligands</title>

         <dc:description>
The family of template&#8208;assembled synthetic G&#8208;quartets, or TASQs, comprises different molecular tools that have been successfully used to decipher G&#8208;quadruplex (G4) biology (via optical imaging and/or affinity precipitation). The synthetic access to the different TASQs has been thoroughly revisited herein to make it simpler and more efficient thanks to a convergent strategy that relies on an unprecedented key common intermediate.








ABSTRACT
Precise insights into the biology of DNA and RNA G&#8208;quadruplexes (G4s) were obtained thanks to the use of ever more versatile G4&#8208;interacting molecules (or G4 ligands), which bear additional moieties making them functionalizable in situ (i.e., while in interaction with cellular G4s) thanks to bioorthogonal chemistry. We recently reported on a series of biomimetic G4 ligands known as TASQs (for template&#8208;assembled synthetic G&#8208;quartets) whose multifunctionality was exploited to visualize (pre&#8208;targeted and in situ click imaging) and identify cellular G4s (G4omics and Chem&#8208;CLIP). We report herein on a novel synthetic strategy that makes multivalent TASQs readily accessible and opens brand new perspectives for the design of ever smarter molecular tools to unravel the quite complex G4 biology in a more accurate, straightforward, and simpler manner.

         <title>New Phosphoranylideneketenes and Phosphoranylidenethioketenes&#8208;Synthesis, Structure, Spectroscopy, and Lewis Base Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of structurally and electronically diverse phosphoranylideneketenes (R3PCCO) and phosphoranylidenethioketenes (R3PCCS) were synthesized and comprehensively characterized by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray&#8208;crystallography, 13C NMR, and IR spectroscopy. Despite acting as relatively weak ambidentate Lewis donors, these compounds readily form stable adducts with strong Lewis acids.








Abstract
Posphoranylideneketene Ph3PCCO and its sulfur analogue, Ph3PCCS, are cumulated ylides that exhibit diverse reactivity and distinct structural features. Herein, we present the first systematic study of substituent effects on the structures and bonding of a series of aryl&#8208; and alkyl&#8208;substituted phosphoranylideneketenes, R3PCCO [R = Et, cyclohexyl, NMe2, 4&#8208;Me2N&#8208;C6H4, 4&#8208;MeO&#8208;C6H4, 4&#8208;CF3&#8208;C6H4, 3,5&#8208;(CF3)2&#8208;C6H3], prepared from the corresponding phosphonium salts, [R3PCH2COOEt]X (X = Br, I) and two equivalents of Na[N(SiMe3)2]. Multinuclear NMR and IR spectroscopy, supported by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, revealed that the bond strength within the central P&#9552;C&#9552;C&#9552;O fragment increases with the electron&#8208;deficiency of the aryl substituents at phosphorus. The corresponding phosphoranylidenethioketenes, R3PCCS (R = Et, cyclohexyl, NMe2, 4&#8208;Me2N&#8208;C6H4, 4&#8208;MeO&#8208;C6H4, 4&#8208;CF3&#8208;C6H4), were obtained by reactions of R3PCCO with CS2. The rate of conversion of R3PCCO into R3PCCS decreases with increasing electron deficiency at phosphorus. Both R3PCCO and R3PCCS act as relatively weak ambidentate Lewis donors, yet they form stable acid&#8208;base adducts with strong Lewis acids such as B(C6F5)3 and Al(C6F5)3.

         <title>Facile Synthesis of the Tricyclic Core of Daphniphyllum Alkaloid Daphnilongeranin B via Oxidative Nazarov Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Employing the oxidative Nazarov reaction, the [7,5,5]&#8208;tricyclic core of the&#160;Daphniphyllum&#160;alkaloid daphnilongeranin B was facilely synthesized from cycloheptenone in seven steps.








ABSTRACT
Daphniphyllum alkaloid daphnilongeranin B presents synthetic challenges due to its congested hexacyclic skeleton, seven stereogenic centers, and two vicinal quaternary centers. Recently, we discovered a series of TEMPO+BF4&#8722;&#8208;promoted Nazarov reactions and demonstrated their value in the synthesis of five&#8208;membered ring&#8208;containing small molecules and structurally complex natural products. Herein, we report a concise synthesis of its [7&#8208;5&#8208;5] tricyclic core via a 7&#8208;step approach, using commercially available, inexpensive cycloheptenone as the starting material. Key transformations include a Babler&#8208;Dauben rearrangement, an intramolecular aldol condensation, and a pivotal TEMPO&#8314;BF4&#8722;&#8208;mediated oxidative Nazarov reaction via an easily synthesized, unfunctionalized tertiary divinyl carbinol (TDC).

     alt="Facile Synthesis of the Tricyclic Core of Daphniphyllum Alkaloid Daphnilongeranin B via Oxidative Nazarov Reaction"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Employing the oxidative Nazarov reaction, the [7,5,5]-tricyclic core of the&#160;&lt;i&gt;Daphniphyllum&lt;/i&gt;&#160;alkaloid daphnilongeranin B was facilely synthesized from cycloheptenone in seven steps.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Daphniphyllum&lt;/i&gt; alkaloid daphnilongeranin B presents synthetic challenges due to its congested hexacyclic skeleton, seven stereogenic centers, and two vicinal quaternary centers. Recently, we discovered a series of TEMPO&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;BF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;-promoted Nazarov reactions and demonstrated their value in the synthesis of five-membered ring-containing small molecules and structurally complex natural products. Herein, we report a concise synthesis of its [7-5-5] tricyclic core via a 7-step approach, using commercially available, inexpensive cycloheptenone as the starting material. Key transformations include a Babler-Dauben rearrangement, an intramolecular aldol condensation, and a pivotal TEMPO&#8314;BF4&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;-mediated oxidative Nazarov reaction via an easily synthesized, unfunctionalized tertiary divinyl carbinol (TDC). These results showcase the utility of our mild Nazarov methodology and lay the foundation for the total synthesis of daphnilongeranin B.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Red and Orange&#8208;Light&#8208;Accelerated Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed Oxidative Olefination of Arenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Long&#8208;wavelength visible&#8208;light&#8208;accelerated Rh(III)&#8208;catalyzed olefination of arenes bearing anilides is reported. The method operates without an external photosensitizer or short&#8208;wavelength blue light. Rh(III) hydride intermediate is oxidized with oxygen in the excited state by absorbing long&#8208;wavelength visible light, improving catalytic efficiency.








ABSTRACT
Transition metal (TM)&#8208;catalyzed photoreactions have emerged as powerful tools for synthesizing products that are challenging to obtain under conventional thermal conditions. However, most protocols rely on short&#8208;wavelength visible light, such as purple or blue light (&lt;500&#160;nm). Although long&#8208;wavelength light (&gt;500&#160;nm) allows for milder conditions, higher chemical selectivity, and deep light penetration, its application in single TM&#8208;catalyzed photocatalytic systems is rare. Herein, we present the long&#8208;wavelength visible&#8208;light&#8208;accelerated Rh(III)&#8208;catalyzed olefination of arenes bearing an anilide moiety as a directing group. This methodology circumvents the use of external photosensitizers and short&#8208;wavelength blue light, owing to the use of a cationic Rh(III) complex. Experimental and computational analyses suggest that the Rh(III) complex initially acts as a C&#9472;H activation catalyst, and oxidation of the generated Rh(III) hydride intermediate by oxygen is accelerated by absorption of long&#8208;wavelength visible light (&gt; 500&#160;nm).

         <title>Effective Strategies on Fabricating Photoelectrode Materials for Enhancing Photoelectrochemical Sensing</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Designing and constructing highly active photoelectrodes is key to improving the performance of PEC sensor. A variety of signal enhancement strategies have been employed on fabricating effective photoelectrode materials, including constructing heterojunctions, modifying cocatalysts, doping elements, and surface sensitization to achieve excellent sensing performance of PEC analysis platforms.








Abstract
Photoelectrochemical (PEC) sensors, as a rapidly developing and highly promising method for detection and analysis, show the advantages of low background noise and high sensitivity by virtue of the separate &#8220;photoexcitation&#8208;electrical detection signal&#8221; mode. It is attracting increasing attention in fields such as environmental monitoring and pharmaceutical analysis. The working mechanism of PEC sensor is recording the change of electrical signals caused by the recognition reaction between the measured substance and the photoelectrode. The photoresponsive materials on electrodes play a central role in the conversion of light into electrical signal, and it can directly affect the sensitivity of the sensor element. Designing and constructing highly active photoelectrode is key to improve the performance of PEC sensor, but it also presents significant challenges. Based on the above, this paper reviews a variety of electrical signal enhancement strategies through fabricating effective photoelectrode materials, such as constructing heterojunctions, modifying cocatalysts, doping elements, and sensitization of quantum dots, etc., aiming to provide valuable solutions to achieving excellent sensing performance of PEC analysis platforms. Finally, some future opportunities and challenges of PEC sensors are also discussed.

         <title>Synthesis and Electrolyte Study of Lithium Bis(perfluorinated pinacolato)Borate for Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work showcases the synthesis of lithium bis(perfluorinated pinacolato)borate and investigates its application as an electrolyte salt for lithium&#8208;ion batteries. The synthesized salts give improved air and thermal stability compared to conventionally used lithium hexafluorophosphate. Long&#8208;term battery cycling followed by an electrolyte degradation study has been performed.








Abstract
Lithium&#8208;ion batteries are the leading rechargeable battery technology. 1 M lithium hexafluorophosphate (LiPF6) dissolved in carbonate solvents is commonly used as the electrolyte; however, LiPF6 is hygroscopic and forms toxic HF in the presence of water. This work presents the synthesis of lithium bis(perfluorinated pinacolato)borate salts Li[B(pp)2]&#183;xDME (x&#160;=&#160;0 or 1, pp&#160;=&#160;perfluorinated pinacolato, O2C2(CF3)4), which exhibit superior air tolerance and have higher thermal stability than LiPF6. Lithium&#8208;ion cycling using 1 M Li[B(pp)2]&#183;DME and 0.2 M Li[B(pp)2] electrolyte salts was performed, where 0.2 M Li[B(pp)2] cycled with higher capacity than 1 M Li[B(pp)2]&#183;DME. X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy on the post&#8208;cycled NMC cathode found a thicker cathode electrolyte interphase with less LiF when using Li[B(pp)2]&#183;DME than for LiPF6 based electrolyte.

         <title>Deazaalloxazines &#8211; Flavin Derivatives That Provide Reductive Photoredox Catalysis with Inert Substrates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
7,8&#8208;Dimethoxy&#8208;5&#8208;aryl&#8208;5&#8208;deazaalloxazines (dAll) are new class of photostable, visible&#8208;light&#8208;absorbing flavin derivatives which are strongly reducible upon excitation with 400&#160;nm light. It was demonstrated on difficult&#8208;to&#8208;reduce aryl halides like bromo&#8208;, chloro&#8208; and fluoroanisoles which were transformed to phosphonates by reductive cross&#8208;coupling with trimethyl phosphite or on desulfonylation of sulfonamides to free amines by S&#9472;N bond cleavage.








Abstract
Reductive transformations of substances that are difficult to reduce continue to pose challenges for photoredox catalysis. Promising photoreduction catalysts include flavin and deazaflavin derivatives; however, even their reductive abilities are limited for the range of substrates considered &#8220;inert&#8221;. In this work, we present 5&#8208;deazaalloxazines, a new group of deazaflavin analogues that are predisposed to catalyze reductions due to their low reduction potential (down to &#8722;1.65&#160;V vs. SCE) even in the ground state. We studied three series of 5&#8208;deazaalloxazines ([i] 5&#8208;unsubstituted, [ii] 5&#8208;aryldeazaalloxazines, and [iii] 5&#8208;trifluoromethyl&#8208;5&#8208;deazaalloxazines) to determine their photophysical and electrochemical properties and their ability to participate in model photoreduction reactions. From 31 compounds, we selected 1,3&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;7,8&#8208;dimethoxy&#8208;5&#8208;(o&#8208;tolyl)&#8208;5&#8208;deazaalloxazine [3a(o&#8208;MePh)], as it showed, among other things, the highest efficiency in photodehalogenation of p&#8208;fluoroanisole and was photostable and absorbed in the visible light region, thereby allowing photoreactions using a 400&#160;nm LED. Practical applicability was demonstrated in the C&#9472;P coupling reaction of electron&#8208;rich aryl halides (including chloroanisoles and p&#8208;fluoroanisole) with trimethyl phosphite, providing an arylation reaction to form dimethyl arylphosphonates, and in the release/deprotection of amines from the corresponding tosyl and triflylamides.

         <title>Intertwined Processes in the Pummerer&#8208;Type Rearrangement Affording &#945;&#8208;Trifluoromethoxylated Thioethers and the Corresponding Highly Enantioenriched Sulfoxides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly stereoenriched &#945;&#8208;trifluoromethoxylated sulfoxides were accessed from racemic aryl methyl sulfoxides, by means of a trifluoromethoxylative Pummerer rearrangement and a highly enantioselective sulfoxidation. The 2&#8208;step procedure could be performed in one pot. The mechanism of the rearrangement and the properties of the desired sulfoxides were studied, paving the way for an alternative access to controlled trifluoromethoxylated stereocenters.








Abstract
A method to access racemic or highly stereoenriched &#945;&#8208;trifluoromethoxylated sulfoxides through the Pummerer rearrangement of aryl methyl sulfoxides followed by the oxidation of the resulting trifluoromethoxylated sulfides is described. Among the three reagents selected as both rearrangement activators and F3CO&#8211; anion sources, 2,4&#8208;dinitro&#8208;1&#8208;(trifluoromethoxy)benzene (DNTFB) was found to be the most effective. In each case, the OCF3&#8208;source was shown to play diverse key roles in the rearrangement. Enantioenriched trifluoromethoxy&#8208;sulfoxides (up to 95% enantiomeric excess) were obtained using an oxaziridinium salt derived from cholesterol.&#160;The configurational stability of these sulfoxides was investigated by thermal enantiomerization followed by enantioselective chromatography. Finally, the acidity of the protons in &#945;&#8208;position of the sulfinyl group was determined in DMSO (pKa value 20.3) suggesting the potency of this new scaffold for preparing trifluoromethoxylated trisubstituted C&#8208;sp3 centers via a deprotonation/alkylation sequence.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An environmentally benign and general protocol for intermolecular benzylic C(sp3)&#9472;H amination under mild, catalyst&#8208;free, and cost&#8208;effective conditions is reported, eliminating the long&#8208;standing reliance on transition metals, photoelectrochemical systems, and stoichiometric oxidants.








Abstract
We present an environmentally benign and efficient strategy for the direct amination of benzylic C(sp3)&#9472;H bonds. This method operates under metal&#8208;free, photocatalyst&#8208;free, and oxidant&#8208;free conditions. Notably, the protocol demonstrates exceptional functional group tolerance and scalability, enabling gram&#8208;scale synthesis and late&#8208;stage functionalization of complex drug&#8208;like molecules.

         <title>Nanocatalysis for Green Synthesis of Functionalized Benzofurans</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanocatalysis has been emerged as a sustainable green synthetic approach for the synthesis of organic compounds. The present manuscript demonstrates the development of functionalized benzofuran by using various NPs. Moreover, the mechanistic part of nanocatalysis also have been discussed.








Abstract
Due to vivid challenges for the synthesis of heterocyclic compounds such as maximizing efficiency, high yield, controlled&#8208; stereochemistry, high purity, and ecofriendly synthetic methods, nanomaterials, and nanocatalysis have gained much attention as highly efficient alternatives to conventional materials. Herein, the development of functionalized benzofuran by using sustainable green synthetic approaches, for instance, nanomaterial&#8208;based catalysis in presence of novel metal nanoparticles (NPs), bimetallic NPs, graphene&#8208;supported metals, metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs), and porous organic polymers (POPs) have been demonstrated. Moreover, the role of nanomaterials, mechanistic approaches during the catalysis and advantages of nanocatalysis over conventional methods have also been discussed.

         <title>Cyclic Tetraindoles With a Cyclooctatetraene Core: Controlling Planarity and Antiaromatic Character via N&#8208;Alkylation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report cyclic tetraindole derivatives incorporating a central cyclooctatetraene (COT) ring, where molecular distortion is tuned by N&#8208;alkylation. Increasing planarity through ethylene linkers enhances &#960;&#8208;conjugation and antiaromaticity, accompanied by red&#8208;shifted absorption, lower oxidation potentials, and a reduced HOMO&#8211;LUMO gap, providing insights into structure&#8208;property relationships in antiaromatic &#960;&#8208;systems.








Abstract
Cyclooctatetraene (COT), a representative 4n &#960;&#8208;electronic system, typically exhibits nonaromatic character in highly twisted structures, but planarization significantly alters its electronic properties, increasing antiaromaticity. Therefore, investigations on the structure&#8208;property relationships of COT derivatives are essential for the development of future functional materials. In this study, we have developed a series of cyclic tetraindoles possessing a central COT ring. The degree of molecular distortion can be controlled by N&#8208;alkylation. Specifically, substitution of the N&#8208;butyl groups increased the distortion, while the structural fixation by ethylene linkers enhanced its planarity. As planarity increased, a noticeable red&#8208;shift in the absorption wavelength, a decrease in oxidation potential, and a reduction in the HOMO&#8208;LUMO gap were observed. These results can be attributed to the more effective conjugation of the COT ring with increased planarity, which led to an enhancement of the antiaromaticity.

         <title>Enhanced i&#8208;Motif Stability through Consecutive 2&#8242;,2&#8242;&#8208;Difluorocytidine Incorporation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Gemcitabine (dFdC) is a unique nucleoside containing two fluorine atoms at the 2&#8242;&#8208;position. Using circular dichroism (CD) and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, we discovered that consecutive dFdC confer remarkable thermal and pH i&#8208;motif stability. In particular, the molecular surface of the fully modified human vertebrate i&#8208;motif structure shows the confluence of the fluorine atoms in green, which contributes to the overall stabilisation.








Abstract
Chemical modifications of nucleic acids are widely used to tune stability and functionality in therapeutic and nanotechnological applications. Among these, fluorinated cytidine derivatives such as 2&#8242;&#8208;fluoro&#8208;arabinocytidine (2&#8242;F&#8208;araC) and 2&#8242;&#8208;fluoro&#8208;ribocytidine (2&#8242;F&#8208;riboC) have been shown to influence i&#8208;motif structures differently, with 2&#8242;F&#8208;araC strongly stabilizing and 2&#8242;F&#8208;riboC exerting a mildly deleterious effect. In this study, we investigate the impact of gemcitabine (2&#8242;&#8208;deoxy&#8208;2&#8242;,2&#8242;&#8208;difluorocytidine, dFdC) on i&#8208;motif stability. dFdC exhibits small effects in single or double substituted sequences, but a pronounced stabilization when multiple consecutive residues are incorporated. Thermal and pH&#8208;dependent analyses demonstrate that sequences containing fully substituted dFdC maintain i&#8208;motif folding at neutral pH and show enhanced thermal stability. Structural insights suggest that this stabilization arises from a combination of factors, such as hyperconjugative interactions, hydrogen bonding, and dipole alignment, while the adaptable sugar conformation mitigates destabilizing minor groove contacts observed in other more rigid modifications, such as 2&#8242;&#8208;F&#8208;riboC. Cooperative interactions among adjacent dFdC residues and potential changes in hydration may play a key factor in reinforcing stability. These results highlight the unique capacity of dFdC to enhance i&#8208;motif robustness and suggest that strategically placed difluoro substitutions can be exploited to design i&#8208;motifs with improved stability, expanding their potential in biotechnology and therapeutic applications.

         <title>To What Extent a Synthetic Strategy Can Influence the Structure, Molecular Dynamics, and Biological Properties of Cyclic Tryptophan Cage Miniproteins</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>

Cyclic peptides are a powerful class of compounds with significant applications in both bio&#8208;logical research and medical therapy. Most of the known cyclic peptides of therapeutic importance are isolated from natural sources. In this paper, we show how the first&#8208;order structure of a precursor containing exactly the same amino acids sequence, but organized in the opposite order after macrocyclization, can alter the physicochemical properties.








Abstract
This paper presents structural and biological studies of two cyclic oligopeptides obtained as a result of macrocyclization of linear precursors containing the same amino acid composition, but arranged in reverse order. The first of them with an amino acid sequence (G1D2A3Y4A5Q6W7L8A9D10G11G12P13S14S15G16R17P18P19P20S21G22&#8208;) belongs to a group of oligopeptides known in the literature as Tryptophan Cage (Trp_C), often used as models to test and understand the mechanism of protein folding. The knowledge about second precursor (&#8208;G1S2P3P4P5R6G7S8S9P10G11G12D13A14L15W16Q17A18 Y19A20D21G22&#8208;) is not so extensive. The cyclic forms of both compounds labeled as cTrp_C and Inv&#8208;cTrp_C were studied by mass spectrometry (ESI MS and ESI MS/MS), electronic circular dichroism (ECD) and 1D and 2D NMR spectroscopy. ECD and NMR measurements were performed in a different solvents and a wide temperature range. The experimental data clearly demonstrated differences in thermal stability and conformational changes for the two samples. The nature and mechanism of these changes were investigated by means of Molecular Dynamics calculations. Theoretical studies have shown that for cTrp_C and Inv&#8208;cTrp_C the length and structure of the &#945;$\alpha$&#8208;helix, which is the core stabilizing the geometry of cyclic oligopeptides, are different. In the case of Inv&#8208;cTrp_C, two edge models with a indole ring of tryptophan (W16) inside the cage (Inv&#8208;cTrp_C1) and outside the cage (Inv&#8208;cTrp_C2) are postulated. Based on theoretical calculations, it is speculated that the formation of these two structures is due to the large&#8208;amplitude reorientation of the unstructured chain around the &#945;$\alpha$&#8208;helix.

         <title>Sc(III) Complexes of Pyclen Derivative Ligands as Probes for Hypoxia: Synthesis, Chemical Characterization, 44Sc&#8208;Radiolabeling, and Preclinical Assessment</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>

Hypoxia&#8208;sensitive nitroimidazole&#8208;functionalized pyclen derivatives were successfully synthesized and radiolabeled with 44Sc(III), affording stable and inert scandium complexes. Remarkable Sc(III)&#8208;binding capabilities of the PC2A&#8208;mono(amide) platform enabled excellent radiolabeling performance, with &#8805;92&#8211;99% yields and &#8805;99% radiochemical purity. MicroPET studies confirmed efficient tumor accumulation, with the PC2A&#8208;Ph&#8208;NI derivative exhibiting superior biodistribution and tumor&#8208;to&#8208;background ratios, highlighting its potential as a diagnostic radiopharmaceutical.








Abstract
Rigid pyclen derivative ligands bearing hypoxia&#8208;sensitive nitroimidazole (NI) pendants, PC2A&#8208;Ph&#8208;NI (hexadentate) and PC2AM&#8208;NI (heptadentate), were synthesized, radiolabeled with 44Sc(III), and evaluated under preclinical circumstances. Physicochemical characterization was carried out using the structurally related model ligand, PC2AMnBu, by multinuclear NMR, UV&#8208;Vis spectroscopy, and pH&#8208;potentiometry. Sc(III) ion was found to form a stable complex with PC2AMnBu (log KScL&#160;=&#160;19.53(4); pSc&#160;=&#160;19.32), in a reasonably fast reaction, with outstanding inertness (t1/2 = 529&#160;hours in 1&#160;M HClO4). The [Sc(PC2AMnBu)]+ complex can coordinate fluoride (log KScLF&#160;=&#160;2.5(2)), and the ternary complex is remarkably inert against fluoride exchange. Based on these results, the PC2A&#8208;mono(amide) platform seems to be a promising Sc(III)&#8208;binder, paving the way for the labeling of NI&#8208;containing ligands with 44Sc(III). Followed by successful radiolabeling with the positron&#8208;emitting 44Sc isotope, labeling yields of 92% and over 99% were evidenced for [44Sc][Sc(PC2AM&#8208;NI)]+ and [44Sc][Sc(PC2A&#8208;Ph&#8208;NI)]+; respectively, at 95 &#176;C and 15&#160;minutes; moreover, after purification, the radiochemical purity exceeded 99%. Both radiocomplexes remained stable in rat blood serum for at least 4 hours and exhibited high resistance toward transmetalation and transchelation processes. MicroPET imaging with preclinical models of B16&#8208;F10 mouse melanoma was conducted to assess the tumor targeting capability and the in vivo biodistribution pattern of [44Sc][Sc(PC2AM&#8208;NI)] and [44Sc][Sc(PC2A&#8208;Ph&#8208;NI)]+ radiopharmaceuticals. Given the higher tumor uptakes of [44Sc][Sc(PC2A&#8208;Ph&#8208;NI)]+ with decreasing off&#8208;target activity and related better tumor/noise ratios, we may conclude that the diagnostic potential of the PC2A&#8208;Ph&#8208;NI derivative outperforms that of the [44Sc][Sc(PC2AM&#8208;NI)]+.

Photoswitchable azobenzene&#8208;embedded glycomacrolactones have been synthesized and successfully employed as chiral dopants in nematic liquid crystal hosts to induce a cholesteric phase, with an amplification of helix upon E&#8208;to&#8208;Z photoisomerization and enforcement of helical twisting power at Z&#8208;rich state, as well as photoinduced helix inversion&#8212;marking the first such example for this class of compounds.

         <title>Oxidant&#8208;Triggered Bioconjugation Chemistry: Expanding the Landscape of Ligandable Lysine Residues in the Proteome</title>

Abstract
The development of covalent drugs targeting lysine residues represents a transformative frontier in chemical biology and drug discovery. Despite the abundance of lysine (5.6% of proteomic residues) and its functional versatility, exploration has been hindered by the lack of robust methods to profile its reactivity and ligandability. This work introduces a new oxidant&#8208;triggered bioconjugation platform that enables global mapping of lysine residues, and reveals over 7,000 covalently modifiable sites. By leveraging hydroxamic acid probes activated by soluble and low&#8208;toxicity sodium periodate (NaIO4), this strategy overcomes the limitations of traditional electrophiles and provides insights into the role of lysines in protein function and disease. The platform can be applied to kinase profiling, cancer target discovery, and covalent inhibitor development, offering a potential strategy for addressing &#8220;undruggable&#8221; proteins.

         <title>Expanding Chemistry of Expanded Helicenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 64, November 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review presents recent advances in the chemistry of expanded helicenes, defined as helicenes containing linearly fused benzene rings, as novel aromatic compounds. This review begins with a summary of their structural classification, followed by the synthesis, structures, properties, and chiroptical performance of expanded helicenes of various shapes, such as hexagons, triangles, and rhombuses.








Abstract
Expanded helicenes are interesting compounds created by modifying the original helicene structure through the incorporation of linearly fused benzene rings, enlarging the helical diameter. Motivated by Tilley et&#160;al.&#8217;s report of a key expanded helicene structure in 2017, several research groups have synthesized such nonplanar aromatic compounds, aiming to explore their impressive structures, properties, and chiroptical performance. This review highlights recent advances in the expanded helicene chemistry through experimental and theoretical studies. The shape and length of helical structures depend on the number and combination of angularly and linearly fused benzene rings. Helical structures are classified using notations, and specific compounds corresponding to each structural form, namely, hexagonal, triangular, rhombic, or others, are introduced herein. As an extension of the molecular design, examples of nonhexagonal and heteroaromatic ring&#8208;embedded expanded helicenes are presented. Specifically, this review focuses on how the diameters, lengths, and turn numbers of helical structures depend on dynamic processes involving helical inversion and chiroptical properties (circular dichroism (CD) and circularly polarized luminescence (CPL)). The characteristics and perspectives of this molecular design are also discussed.

Structural transformation in hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) via bond cleavage and reformation is highlighted. Sql&#8208;type HOFs composed of tetracarboxylic acids bearing 4,4&#8242;&#8208;dicarboxy&#8208;o&#8208;terphenyl moieties are shown to be particularly prone to H&#8208;bond reformations. Analysis of molecular conformation and crystal packing provides design insights for controlling H&#8208;bond reformation, guiding the development of dynamic porous materials.








Abstract
The weak and reversible nature of hydrogen bonds endows porous materials with structural flexibility. In this article, we highlight structural transformations involving the cleavage and reformation of hydrogen bonds&#8212;termed H&#8208;bond reformation. To enable control over H&#8208;bond reformation through molecular design, we examine and discuss key structural features. Particular attention is given to tetracarboxylic acids bearing 4,4&#8242;&#8208;dicarboxy&#8208;o&#8208;terphenyl moieties as scaffolds for inducing H&#8208;bond reformation. These insights are expected to guide the rational design of dynamic porous materials with tunable properties and stimuli&#8208;responsive behavior.

Macrocyclic glycoazobenzenes: Four new azobenzene&#8208;functionalized glycomacrolactones bearing different substituents on the glucopyranoside ring have been synthesized. These photoswitchable chiral macrocycles behave as chiral dopants of NLCs, with an amplification of helix upon E to Z photoisomerization and enforcement of HTP at Z&#8208;rich state. Critical influence of sugar ring functionalization in governing chirality transfer and photoswitching behavior has been demonstrated. Two of the synthesized glycomacrocycles uniquely achieved photoinduced helix inversion&#8212;marking the first such example for this class of compounds.








Abstract
Novel azobenzene&#8208;embedded glycomacrolactones bearing different substituents on the glucopyranoside ring have been synthesized and characterized by NMR spectroscopy, UV/vis spectroscopy, and circular dichroism (CD), then applied for cholesteric liquid crystal photomodulation. All the macrocycles displayed good photochromic properties, fatigue resistance, thermal bistability, and chiroptical activity. As chiral dopants for nematic liquid crystal (NLC), an amplification of helix upon E to Z photoisomerization and enforcement of helical twisting power (HTP) at Z&#8208;rich state have been observed. We also demonstrated the critical influence of sugar&#8208;ring functionalization in governing chirality transfer and photoswitching behavior in cholesteric liquid crystals (CLCs). Two of the synthesized glycomacrocycles uniquely achieved photoinduced helix inversion&#8212;marking the first such example for this class of compounds.

         <title>Synthesis of a Functionalized Bicyclo[3.2.1]Octane: A Common Subunit to Kauranes, Grayananes, and Gibberellanes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 64, November 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A detailed account on the synthesis of a bicyclo[3.2.1]octane scaffold, common to the kaurane, grayanane, and gibberellane diterpenoid families, is reported. Our original strategy relying on a 1,4&#8208;sila&#8208;Prins cyclization proved unsuccessful. Learning from that, we designed an alternative strategy relying on ring&#8208;closing metathesis (RCM), which ultimately led to the desired compound in 8 steps.








Abstract
Kauranes, grayananes, and gibberellanes are three important diterpenoid families. These natural products all share a bicyclo[3.2.1]octane skeleton, with oxidation at very specific positions. In this manuscript, we describe the synthesis of a bicyclo[3.2.1]octane building block, which could serve as a potential intermediate for the synthesis of natural products from these three families. A first approach relying on a 1,4&#8208;sila&#8208;Prins cyclization was first explored, which required the selective functionalization of dihydrocarvone (via C&#9472;H activation and selective oxidation). This strategy resulted in a dead end when a 1,2&#8208;cyclization product was obtained. An alternative strategy relying on ring&#8208;closing metathesis (RCM) allowed to successfully achieve the synthesis of the desired scaffold in 8 steps from cyclohexenone.

         <title>Ester&#8208;Aroyl&#8208;S,N&#8208;Ketene Acetals with Solid&#8208;State Luminescence: AIEgens from Sequential Three&#8208;Component Desymmetrization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 64, November 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The difference in nucleophilicity of alcohols and S,N&#8208;ketene acetals sets the stage for the desymmetrizing acylation of diaroyl chlorides in a consecutive one&#8208;pot fashion in good yields. The ester&#8208;functionalized aroyl&#8208;S,N&#8208;ketene acetals are solid&#8208;state emitters that emit in solution only upon aggregation. Upon encapsulation in polystyrene nanoparticles, the fluorescence quantum yield enhances significantly.








Abstract
Di(hetero)aroyl dichlorides are desymmetrized upon sequential reaction with alcohols and 2&#8208;methyl N&#8208;benzyl thiazolium salts within the course of a one&#8208;pot three&#8208;component reaction yielding ester&#8208;substituted aroyl&#8208;S,N&#8208;ketene acetals under mild conditions in good yields. A prerequisite for the concise one&#8208;pot process is the different nucleophilicity of the alcohols and in situ generated S,N&#8208;ketene acetals. The resulting compounds are merocyanines with dominant charge&#8208;transfer absorption bands which are fluorescent in the solid state, but not in solution. In water/ethanol solvent mixtures of increasing water content, the water&#8208;insoluble dyes display typical aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) characteristics. The water fraction inducing AIE as well as the emission color, and fluorescence quantum yield (&#934;f) of the aggregated dyes can be controlled by the alcohol part of the ester moiety. Encapsulation into polystyrene nanoparticles can lead to a considerable increase of the fluorescence quantum yield &#934;f to 30% as shown for a representatively chosen dye revealing the highest &#934;f of 11% within the dye series in the water/ethanol mixtures and enabling the usage of these dyes as fluorescent reporters in aqueous environments.

&lt;p&gt;The difference in nucleophilicity of alcohols and &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-ketene acetals sets the stage for the desymmetrizing acylation of diaroyl chlorides in a consecutive one-pot fashion in good yields. The ester-functionalized aroyl-&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-ketene acetals are solid-state emitters that emit in solution only upon aggregation. Upon encapsulation in polystyrene nanoparticles, the fluorescence quantum yield enhances significantly.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Di(hetero)aroyl dichlorides are desymmetrized upon sequential reaction with alcohols and 2-methyl &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-benzyl thiazolium salts within the course of a one-pot three-component reaction yielding ester-substituted aroyl-&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-ketene acetals under mild conditions in good yields. A prerequisite for the concise one-pot process is the different nucleophilicity of the alcohols and in situ generated &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-ketene acetals. The resulting compounds are merocyanines with dominant charge-transfer absorption bands which are fluorescent in the solid state, but not in solution. In water/ethanol solvent mixtures of increasing water content, the water-insoluble dyes display typical aggregation-induced emission (AIE) characteristics. The water fraction inducing AIE as well as the emission color, and fluorescence quantum yield (&lt;i&gt;&#934;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;) of the aggregated dyes can be controlled by the alcohol part of the ester moiety. Encapsulation into polystyrene nanoparticles can lead to a considerable increase of the fluorescence quantum yield &lt;i&gt;&#934;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt; to 30% as shown for a representatively chosen dye revealing the highest &lt;i&gt;&#934;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt; of 11% within the dye series in the water/ethanol mixtures and enabling the usage of these dyes as fluorescent reporters in aqueous environments.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Reduction of Nitrite at a Copper(II) Trans&#8208;&#954;1&#8208;ONO Complex via Proton&#8208;Coupled Electron Transfer and Oxygen Atom Transfer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 64, November 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, we describe the synthesis of a copper(II) nitrite complex which possesses unusual trans&#8208;&#954;1&#8208;O binding mode in trigonal bipyramidal geometry, and characterization through various physicochemical methods. The reduction of NO2&#8722; to release NO&#8226; was examined through PCET and OAT by using ferrocene and PPh3, respectively. DFT calculations revealed that the isomerization of trans&#8208;&#954;1&#8208;O to &#954;1&#8208;N binding mode is the key step for the OAT. The superiority of &#954;1&#8208;N binding mode in the OAT was further rationalized by molecular orbital analysis.








Abstract
Reduction of nitrite (NO2&#8722;) to nitric oxide (NO) serves important roles in NO&#8208;dependent signaling as well as in the broad nitrogen biogeochemical cycle. In biological system, copper&#8208;containing nitrite reductases (CuNiRs) are well known to bind a nitrite anion to mediate the nitrite reduction to release NO, of which the mechanism still requires further understanding. Herein, synthetic copper(II) nitrite complex with a rare binding mode, [CuII(iPr3&#8208;tren)(trans&#8208;&#954;1&#8208;ONO)]+ (2), is characterized physicochemically and examined in proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET) and oxygen atom transfer (OAT) to release NO. For the first time to gain mechanistic insights into the trans&#8208;&#954;1&#8208;O binding copper(II) nitrite complex, detailed kinetic studies in company with theoretical calculations have been performed for oxidation of triphenylphosphine (PPh3), which shows that isomerization of trans&#8208;&#954;1&#8208;O to &#954;1&#8208;N binding mode is necessary to exert electrophilic OAT. The better reactivity of &#954;1&#8208;N binding mode is attributed to a fine orbital mixing of Cu&#8208;dz2 with highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of NO2&#8722;, thereby imposing much larger electron density on NO2&#8722; moiety. Thus, it is suggested that the reactivity of the copper(II) nitrite complex is conjunctly related to the binding mode of nitrite.

         <title>Rational Design of Cationic Silyl Lewis Acids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 64, November 17, 2025. </description>

The synthesis of a family of selanyl&#8208;stabilized silyl cations is reported. Variations of the scaffold, the substituents at the silicon and the selenium atoms allow to adjust their Lewis acidity over a wide range. The Lewis acidity is quantified by the FBN method.








Abstract
The synthesis of a series of selanyl&#8208;stabilized cationic silyl Lewis acids with naphthalene or acenaphthalene scaffolds is described. The influence of scaffold modifications, substitution variations at the selanyl donor and at the silicon atom on the strengths of the silyl Lewis acid is evaluated using the p&#8208;fluorobenzonitrile (FBN) method. These simple variations of the principal structure allow to adjust the Lewis acidity of the cationic silyl Lewis acids from weak ones to examples that are significantly stronger than tris(pentafluorophenyl)borane (BCF). The solid&#8208;state structure of the cationic FBN complex [11(FBN)]+ with an acenaphthene backbone and a pentafluorophenylselanyl donor provides evidence for the penta&#8208;coordination of the silicon atom in this complex, in agreement with the results of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) studies in solution. Finally, this study suggests that the FBN method is well suited to assess even very subtle differences in the strength of Lewis acids.

First syntheses of pyrrolidine&#8208;, piperidine&#8208;, and azepane tricyclic &#946;&#8208;lactams based on a saturated scaffold are achieved through an Fe&#8208;pyrimidinediimine&#8208;catalysed [2&#160;+&#160;2] cycloaddition of allylamines analogues followed by photo&#8208;induced intramolecular C&#9472;H insertion. The cage&#8208;like &#946;&#8208;lactam scaffolds enable strain&#8208;release access to methylphenidate analogues and expand the three&#8208;dimensional chemical space.








Abstract
Highly saturated, three&#8208;dimensional &#946;&#8208;lactams are valuable motifs in medicinal chemistry, yet general routes to cyclobutane&#8208;fused analogues remain scarce. Here we disclose a concise strategy that delivers pyrrolidine&#8208;, piperidine&#8208;, and azepane&#8208;based tricyclic &#946;&#8208;lactams. A pyrimidinediimine&#8208;iron catalyst first constructs the cyclobutane ring and the N&#8208;heterocycle in one step through an intermolecular [2&#160;+&#160;2]&#8208;cycloaddition of allyl amines; a subsequent photochemical intramolecular C&#9472;H insertion then forges the &#946;&#8208;lactam. The major products adopt rigid, cage&#8208;like conformations confirmed for the pyrrolidine series by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. Comprehensive conformer sampling (using CREST), DFT&#8208;calculated NMR shifts, and DP4 statistical analysis establish the stereochemistry across the library. Strain&#8208;release opening of the &#946;&#8208;lactam ring furnishes methylphenidate analogues in a single step, underscoring the scaffolds&#8217; synthetic versatility. Comparative studies on the corresponding bicyclic systems highlight the unique three&#8208;dimensionality imparted by the additional cyclobutane ring, further expanding the toolbox for lead&#8208;oriented synthesis.

         <title>Coordination&#8208;Driven Orthogonal Ligand Pairings through Dual Hydrogen&#8208;Bonding/&#960;&#8208;&#960; Interaction Complementarity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 64, November 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of bidentate ligands for square&#8208;planar Pd(II) complexes were developed, each with hydrogen&#8208;bonding and &#960;&#8208;&#960;&#8208;stacking domains that are complementary to only one other ligand. The bis&#8208;bidentate complexes form orthogonally to one another with high fidelity, but only when both interaction types are exploited in tandem.








Abstract
Multi&#8208;layered and orthogonal recognition is an excellent route to controlled molecular complexity. Here we report a series of heteroleptic complexes where two ligands pair together at a palladium(II) metal centre in complementary fashion and with orthogonality to others pairs. This complementarity is driven in part through hydrogen&#8208;bonding acceptor or donor sites proximal to the coordination domain (either DD:AA or AD:DA). These interactions alone are insufficient to control ligand pairing identity and/or orientation&#8212;secondary &#960;&#8208;&#960; interactions between electron&#8208;rich and electron&#8208;poor aromatic groups in the recognition domain combine with the hydrogen bonding to give high levels of complementarity. Importantly, the different heteroleptic complexes can be combined without significant scrambling or mismatching.

&lt;p&gt;A series of bidentate ligands for square-planar Pd(II) complexes were developed, each with hydrogen-bonding and &#960;-&#960;-stacking domains that are complementary to only one other ligand. The bis-bidentate complexes form orthogonally to one another with high fidelity, but only when both interaction types are exploited in tandem.

&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Selective Recognition of Physiological Phosphates by Luminescent Europium(III) Probes via Analyte&#8208;Specific Energy&#8208;Transfer Pathways</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synopsis: Time&#8208;resolved luminescent Eu(III) probes, [Eu.L1] and [Eu.L2], can discriminate Pi and NPPs in H2O based on their differential binding interaction triggered by analyte&#8208;specific energy&#8208;transfer pathways.








Abstract
The physiological phosphates (PPs) are crucial in various biochemical pathways and bioenergetics. Their dysregulation is associated with multiple cellular dysfunctions and life&#8208;threatening diseases. Designing sensitive and selective bioresponsive probes capable of differentiating Pi/NPPs levels is crucial for diagnostics and therapy. Developing probes for selective discrimination of phosphates faces intrinsic challenges due to their high hydration energy (&#916;Ghyd) barrier and structural similarity. The hard Ln(III) ions can overcome the high &#916;Ghyd barrier and are ideal for the detection and discrimination of PPs due to their longer lifetimes, using time&#8208;resolved luminescence (TRL) assays. Herein, two water&#8208;soluble luminescent Eu(III) probes, [Eu.L1] and [Eu.L2], can discriminate physiological inorganic (Pi) and nucleoside polyphosphates (NPPs) in H2O based on their differential binding interaction with the respective probe, triggering analyte&#8208;specific energy&#8208;transfer pathways. We established the involvement of coordinative unsaturation and &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking interaction between the [Eu.L] probes and PPs, which modulates the nonradiative vibrational energy transfer (VET) and photo&#8208;induced electron transfer (PeT) pathways, responsible for their specific luminescence response and selectivity. The interaction of phosphates with the Eu(III) probes were monitored by TRL spectroscopy, lifetime (&#964;) and hydration state (q) measurements, and 31P NMR spectroscopy. These results connect the intricate molecular interactions of the [Eu.L] probes with PPs with concomitant TRL&#8208;responses.

         <title>One&#8208;pot Modular Synthesis of Hydroquinolines, Hydrofluorenones, and Aryl Fluorenones</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fundamentally unique method for building the fluorenone skeleton via a one&#8208;pot, stereo&#8208; and regio&#8208;selective multi&#8208;bond&#8208;forming reaction of abundant starting materials is reported. Up to 8 new (C&#8208;C, and C&#8208;N) bonds, 3 cycles, and up to 4 stereocenters were built in a single operation with exclusive stereo and regioselectivity. The resulting aryl fluorenone was transformed to spirobifluorenes, which exhibit high potential as host materials for PhOLEDs.








Abstract
Many natural products and bioactive molecules are built on hydroquinolines, hydrofluorenones, and fluorenones. In addition, aryl fluorenones and their derivatives, such as spirobifluorene, are widely used as a key molecular framework for the development of organic electronic materials. The synthesis of aryl fluorenones relies on multiple steps involving at least two transition metal&#8208;catalyzed C(sp2)&#8208;C(sp2) coupling reactions to build the fluorenone ring, which impede the easy accessibility of these materials for academic research and follow&#8208;up practical applications. Herein, we report a fundamentally unique method to build the fluorenone skeleton via a one&#8208;pot reaction under metal&#8208;free conditions. The method relies on the formation of hydroquinolines and hydrofluorenones via a diastereo&#8208; and regio&#8208;selective multi&#8208;bond forming reaction of feedstock chemicals. Up to 8 new (C&#8208;C, C&#8208;N, and C&#8208;O) bonds, 3 cycles, and up to 4 stereocenters were built in a single operation with exclusive diastereo and regioselectivity. DFT studies provided insights into the diastereo&#8208; and regioselectivity of this reaction. The aryl groups of aryl fluorenones, which are generally installed via transition metal&#8208;catalyzed coupling reaction of pre&#8208;functionalized arene moiety, are incorporated from readily available aryl aldehyde under metal&#8208;free conditions. The spirobifluorenes derived from these arylated fluorenones showed to have appropriate triplet energy, HOMO/LUMO levels, and thermal stability which indicate their potential as a host material for PhOLED.

         <title>A Redox&#8208;Tunable Carborane Crown: Toward Highly Selective Electrochemical Lithium Capture</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrochemical reduction transforms a new carborane&#8211;crown into a potent 2e&#8722; reduced nido anion with a redox&#8208;tunable cavity that captures Li&#8314; selectively over Na&#8314; and K&#8314;. The coupling of electronic control and size&#8208;matched binding offers a blueprint for selective, rapid lithium recovery for next&#8208;generation direct lithium extraction.








Abstract
Lithium is a critical element with a projected exponential rise in demand due to its widespread use in battery energy storage. New methods to extract Li+, such as through membrane adsorption&#8208;based direct Li+ extraction (DLE) technologies, are at various stages of development and aim to separate Li+ from brine and even seawater. In this report, we present a fundamentally new class of highly selective Li+&#8208;capture agent, the carborane&#8208;crown compound, 1,2&#8208;((6,6,7,7&#8208;Me4)14&#8208;crown&#8208;4)&#8208;ortho&#8208;carborane (14C4Cb), which is electrochemically activated for strong, selective Li+ binding over Na+ and K+. This newly synthesized extractant features a redox&#8208;tunable cavity size, giving rise to tunable binding constants for Li+ capture, favorable coulombic interactions between the reduced anionic capture agent and the Li+ cations, and boasts the benefit of rapid, electrochemically driven capture kinetics. Weak, negligible binding to Li+ was observed in the neutral &#8220;closo&#8221; carborane state (14C4Cb), whereas strong binding was observed in the cage&#8208;opened reduced nido state (14C4Cb2&#8722;). Equilibrium (K) binding constants were measured through experimental and simulated voltammetry, yielding the following log Kmetal (experimental; simulation) values: log KLi (6.8&#160;&#177;&#160;0.6; 8.0), log KNa (3.7&#160;&#177;&#160;0.2; 4.9), log KK (1.7&#160;&#177;&#160;0.2; 2.2). Rapid mass transport of Li+ to the electrode surface resulted in the simulated value (log KLi&#160;=&#160;8.0) representing a lower&#8208;limit value for log KLi as described herein. The observed strong binding to Li+ over Na+ and K+ is attributed to both the favorable redox&#8208;tunable crown cavity size of the 14C4Cb/14C4Cb2&#8722; couple, combined with strong coulombic interactions in the reduced nido state. This platform offers a potential new, rapid, and highly selective technique for Li+ capture in next&#8208;generation electrochemical DLE technologies.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enantioselective sensing of minimally functionalized chiral VOCs with common recognition layers remains challenging. A chemoresistive sensor based on semiconducting single&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes modified with multichiral and multifunctional substituted monosaccharides displays intriguing chiral preference toward (&#8211;)&#8208;limonene and (&#8211;)&#8208;carvone enantiomers. A novel class of tunable substituted monosaccharide&#8208;based eNoses is envisioned.








Abstract
Semiconducting single&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes (sc&#8208;SWCNTs) are of great potential for vapor sensing. However, sc&#8208;SWCNTs lack recognition features for discriminating between sparsely functionalized moieties, molecules with similar structural features, and enantiomer pairs. This becomes a major setback in discriminating between volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Here, we used two galactosides decorated with aromatic groups as a recognition layer in chemoresistive sc&#8208;SWCNT sensors to produce chiral preference toward six terpenoid enantiomers. The multichirality and multifunctionality of a monosaccharide scaffold were exploited to maximize the limited interacting features associated with VOCs. The developed system establishes a robust and tunable platform for enantioselective gas sensing.

         <title>In Situ Observation of Polyoxometalate Formation by Vibrational Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In&#8208;situ IR and Raman spectroscopy were employed to observe the formation of polyoxometalates (POMs) in aqueous solution. Thereby key intermediates were identified, and better understanding of POM formation enabled the development of an improved method for the synthesis of vanadium&#8208;substituted phosphomolybdates, which are important catalysts for sustainable applications. The findings streamline POM synthesis procedures by reducing energy input and shortening reaction times.








Abstract
Polyoxometalates (POMs) are multinuclear clusters of transition metals and oxo&#8208;ligands. They have a long history and are still gaining an increased relevance for diverse applications, such as sustainable catalysis. Although the first examples were discovered over a century ago, little is known about the process of their formation. We have now employed modern in situ IR and Raman techniques to gain insights into the processes of the formation of different POM structures in aqueous solution. Thereby, we were able to identify intermediates and optimize reaction conditions. We found that POM formation proceeds very rapidly even at low temperatures, making it unnecessary to reflux the synthesis solutions for multiple hours. With this knowledge, we developed an improved synthetic method for vanadium&#8208;substituted phosphomolybdates, which are of high relevance for sustainable catalysis.

         <title>Bio&#8208;Based Amphiphilic Farnesyl Glycidyl Ether Block Copolymers: Aqueous Self&#8208;Assembly and Solubilization Boosting</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bio&#8208;derived amphiphilic poly(ethylene glycol)&#8208;b&#8208;poly(terpenyl glycidyl ether) diblock copolymers (mPEG114&#8208;b&#8208;PTGEm) were synthesized via AROP from farnesyl glycidyl ether (FarGE) and its hexahydrogenated derivative (HHFarGE). Block copolymer amphiphilicity is easily tunable via the TGE block size m and systematically affects the critical micelle concentration. Adding even small amounts of mPEG114&#8208;b&#8208;PTGEm to microemulsions leads to a significant increase of the solubilization efficiency.








Abstract
Sustainability has become essential in addressing the substitution of depleting fossil&#8208;based resources with bio&#8208;renewable alternatives, including products active at interfaces, such as surfactants. Enhancing their efficiency reduces both ecological and economic impact. Here, we present amphiphilic poly(ethylene glycol)&#8208;b&#8208;poly(terpenyl glycidyl ether) diblock copolymers synthesized via anionic ring&#8208;opening polymerization from two terpenyl glycidyl ethers (TGE) based on the naturally occurring terpenoid farnesol, farnesyl glycidyl ether (FarGE), and its hydrogenated derivative hexahydrofarnesyl glycidyl ether (HHFarGE). Using poly(ethylene glycol) monomethyl ether (mPEG114) as a macroinitiator resulted in controlled molecular weights (5600 &#8211; 8400 g&#183;mol&#8722;1) with low dispersities&#160;&#272; (1.04&#8211;1.07). Fluorescence spectroscopy and light scattering revealed low critical micelle concentrations with a systematic decrease with increasing TGE block size due to the hydrophobic effect. The addition of small amounts of mPEG114&#8208;b&#8208;PTGEm to microemulsions leads to a significant increase of the solubilization efficiency not limited to conventional H2O/NaCl &#8211; n&#8208;decane &#8211; tetraethylene glycol monodecyl ether microemulsions, but also in sustainable H2O &#8211; isopropyl myristate &#8211; n&#8208;octyl &#946;&#8208;D&#8208;glucopyranoside &#8211; farnesol formulations, serving as model systems for cosmetic applications. Using SANS, we observed that adsorption of the copolymer at the amphiphilic film leads to an increased structural order of bicontinuous microemulsions due to a higher film bending rigidity.

         <title>Synthesis and Characterization of [MF5(terpy)]+ (M&#160;=&#160;Mo, W) Salts: Autoionization of MF6 Induced by a Tridentate Ligand</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The hexafluorides MoF6 and WF6 autoionize in the presence of the tridentate terpyridine ligand, yielding [MF5(terpy)]+[MF7]&#8211; (M&#160;=&#160;Mo, W). The octacoordinated [MF5(terpy)]+ cations adopt bicapped trigonal prismatic geometries. The [WF7]&#8211; can be substituted for [SbF6]&#8211; using SbF5SO2, whereas the reaction was unsuccessful for displacing the [MoF7]&#8211; anion. The M&#9472;N bond has substantial covalent character, with the Wiberg bond indices (WBIs) being more than half of those of the M&#9472;F bonds.








Abstract
The reactions of the hexafluorides MoF6 and WF6 with the tridentate ligand terpyridine (terpy) result in autoionization forming [MF5(terpy)][MF7] (M&#160;=&#160;Mo, W) salts. Displacement of [WF7]&#8211; utilizing SbF5, yielded [WF5(terpy)][SbF6]. The octacoordinate [MF5(terpy)]+ cations adopt a bicapped trigonal prismatic geometry based on X&#8208;ray crystallography and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, which is different than the geometry of previously reported fluorido WVI cations. The [MoF5(terpy)]+ cation represents the first fluorido MoVI cation.

         <title>High&#8208;Affinity Peptide&#8208;Drug Conjugate Ligands for the TRIM24 PHD and Bromodomain</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a series of bivalent peptide&#8208;drug conjugate (PDC) ligands for tripartite motif&#8208;containing protein 24 (TRIM24). These ligands simultaneously engage the PHD and BRD of TRIM24 through an intramolecular (in cis) binding mode, resulting in high affinity binding. By incorporating a trimethyllysine (KMe3) mimic and a BRD ligand, these PDCs can disrupt the multivalent chromatin interactions of TRIM24, resulting in complete inhibition of its epigenetic reader function.








Abstract
TRIM24 is an epigenetic transcriptional coregulator that &#8220;reads&#8221; KMe3 and KAc histone modifications via its tandem plant homeodomain (PHD) and bromodomain (BRD), respectively. The PHD and BRD are potential therapeutic targets due to the roles of TRIM24 in breast cancer progression. However, there are currently no small&#8208;molecule ligands for the PHD, and existing TRIM24 BRD inhibitors lack selectivity over the main off&#8208;target, BRPF1. Here, we report the development of the first bivalent tool molecules capable of simultaneously engaging both the TRIM24 PHD and BRD. Key to this strategy was the identification of effective KMe3 bioisosteres that enhance H3 peptide binding to the TRIM24 PHD. The most promising of these was incorporated into a nine amino acid H3&#8208;mimicking peptide, and linked to a TRIM24 BRD ligand. The resulting peptide&#8208;drug conjugates (PDCs) bind to TRIM24 with picomolar affinity and a slow dissociation rate (koff), which is driven by an in cis bivalent binding mode. Although the PDCs showed limited effects on breast cancer cell proliferation in vitro, this work underscores their potential as tools for studying previously unliganded reader domains and consequently advancing our understanding of multivalent epigenetic regulation in disease.

&lt;p&gt;TRIM24 is an epigenetic transcriptional coregulator that &#8220;reads&#8221; KMe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and KAc histone modifications via its tandem plant homeodomain (PHD) and bromodomain (BRD), respectively. The PHD and BRD are potential therapeutic targets due to the roles of TRIM24 in breast cancer progression. However, there are currently no small-molecule ligands for the PHD, and existing TRIM24 BRD inhibitors lack selectivity over the main off-target, BRPF1. Here, we report the development of the first bivalent tool molecules capable of simultaneously engaging both the TRIM24 PHD and BRD. Key to this strategy was the identification of effective KMe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; bioisosteres that enhance H3 peptide binding to the TRIM24 PHD. The most promising of these was incorporated into a nine amino acid H3-mimicking peptide, and linked to a TRIM24 BRD ligand. The resulting peptide-drug conjugates (PDCs) bind to TRIM24 with picomolar affinity and a slow dissociation rate (&lt;i&gt;k&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;off&lt;/sub&gt;), which is driven by an &lt;i&gt;in cis&lt;/i&gt; bivalent binding mode. Although the PDCs showed limited effects on breast cancer cell proliferation in vitro, this work underscores their potential as tools for studying previously unliganded reader domains and consequently advancing our understanding of multivalent epigenetic regulation in disease.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Systematic Determination of Structure&#8208;Activity&#8208;Selectivity Correlations for the Catalytic Oxidation of Glucose to Acetic Acid Depending on the Structure Type of the Used Polyoxometalate Catalyst</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>

Herein, we investigate in detail the influence of different polyoxometalate structure types on the reaction pathways and kinetics for the selective catalytic oxidation of glucose to acetic acid.








Abstract
The BioValCat (Enhanced Biomass Valorization by Engineering of Polyoxometalate Catalysts) project aims for developing homogeneously catalyzed, selective biomass transformation techniques toward an industrially viable biomass valorization process. The present study sets out the foundations for a scalable, safe, and economic procedure for the oxidation of biomass to valuable products. The extension of the product scope to higher carboxylic acids is of great interest. Herein, we investigate in detail the influence of different polyoxometalate (POM) structure types on the reaction pathways and kinetics for the selective catalytic oxidation of glucose to acetic acid (AA). The results have shown severe structure&#8208;selectivity relationships depending on the used POM structure type. Whereas Lindqvist and Anderson&#8208;Evans structures promote the [C3&#160;+&#160;C3] pathway leading to high AA yields above 20%, Keggin and Wells&#8208;Dawson structures are more inclined to follow the [C1&#160;+&#160;C5] pathway, resulting mainly in levulinic acid formation. With respect to kinetics, the Anderson&#8208;type Na9TeV3W3O24 catalyst showed the highest reaction rate amongst all POMs with 32.62&#160;mmol L&#8722;1 min&#8722;1, followed by the Lindqvist&#8208;type Na5V3W3O19 with 27.26&#160;mmol L&#8722;1 min&#8722;1, the Keggin&#8208;type Na6PV3W9O40 with 21.50&#160;mmol L&#8722;1 min&#8722;1 and the Wells&#8208;Dawson&#8208;type Na9P2V3W15O62 with a reaction rate of only 14.50&#160;mmol L&#8722;1 min&#8722;1. Overall, the results demonstrate that the reaction pathways and efficiencies in the catalytic oxidation of glucose vary significantly among POMs with different structure types. These findings provide a basis for optimizing the application of POMs in biomass valorization reactions and suggest potential directions for developing more efficient catalysts in the near future.

         <title>Nb&#8208;Promoted Pt/MoOx/TiO2 Catalysts for Low&#8208;Temperature CO2 Hydrogenation to Methanol</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nb&#8208;promoted Pt/MoOx/TiO2 catalysts displayed enhanced methanol formation from CO2 hydrogenation at low temperature (STYMeOH&#160;=&#160;3.8&#160;mmol gcat&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 at 150&#160;&#176;C). Mechanistic study revealed that all components are essential for methanol production.








Abstract
The catalytic hydrogenation of carbon dioxide (CO2) to methanol under mild conditions presents a sustainable route for carbon recycling and chemical energy storage. However, the inert nature of CO2 and high activation energy barrier for methanol formation remain major challenges. In this study, we developed a series of Nb&#8208;promoted Pt/MoOx/TiO2 catalysts for efficient CO2 hydrogenation at temperatures below 200&#160;&#176;C. Among these, Pt(5)/Mo(10)&#8208;Nb(1)/TiO2 exhibited superior performance, achieving a high methanol productivity of 3.8&#160;mmol gcat&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 at 150&#160;&#176;C, outperforming the commercial Cu&#8208;ZnO/Al2O3 catalyst under comparable conditions. The catalyst showed stable performance during a 400&#160;h long&#8208;term reaction. Detailed in situ and operando spectroscopic studies revealed that Pt sites were primarily responsible for H2 activation, while partially reduced MoOx species facilitated the formation of oxygenated intermediates. The incorporation of highly dispersed Nb species promoted methanol desorption and inhibited its decomposition, thereby contributing to the overall catalytic efficiency. This study outlines a rational design approach for constructing robust low&#8208;temperature catalysts and provides mechanistic insights into the synergistic roles of the metal and oxide components in CO2&#8208;to&#8208;methanol conversion.

         <title>Size&#8208;Controlled Cobalt Nanoplates and Their Impact on Oxygen Evolution Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cobalt nanoplate nanoparticles with controlled diameter size are presented to enhance catalytic activity for the oxygen evolution reaction. This improvement is attributed to a high proportion of {101&#175;$\bar 1$1} surface facets and the presence of defects such as step&#8208;edges and stacking faults.








Abstract
Controlling the size of nanoparticles is important in catalytic reactions, not only for tuning the surface area but also for modifying the electronic structure. However, achieving precise size control in 2D structures remains challenging. In this work, we demonstrate precise size control of cobalt nanoplates, ranging from 19&#160;nm to 80&#160;nm, which is achieved by tuning the ratio of two surfactants used in the synthesis. The 19&#160;nm of Co nanoplates exhibit higher oxygen evolution reaction activity due to a higher proportion of {101&#175;$\bar 1$1} to {0001} facets. This size control allows systematic investigation into how nanoplate dimensions influence catalytic performance in the oxygen evolution reaction, offering new insights into structure&#8208;activity relationships of cobalt nanocatalysts.

Abstract
The sulfenylative N&#8208;glycosylation of glycals, which exhibits high &#946;&#8208;stereoselectivity, has been successfully developed for the first time under the facilitating effect of hexafluoroisopropanol (HFIP). This method is broadly applicable to four classes of nitrogen nucleophiles, including sulfamides, carbamates, ureas, and azoles. Furthermore, various glycal derivatives, such as D&#8208;galactal, D&#8208;arabinal, L&#8208;fucal, and D&#8208;glucal, can be effectively employed in this reaction system. A range of 2&#8208;phenylthio&#8208;N&#8208;glycosides were obtained in moderate to good yields with consistently high &#946;&#8208;selectivity (&#946;:&#945; &gt; 20:1). Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal the origin of the observed stereoselectivity and highlight the critical role of HFIP in promoting the glycosylation process.

         <title>Unravelling the Mechano&#8208;Responsive Solvent Inclusion Behaviour of a Luminescent Organic Solid</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two crystalline solids, viz. C&#8208;Y and C&#8208;G forms, were obtained from an organic luminogen, 2N&#8208;4OH. The C&#8208;G form, isolated as DMF solvate, respond differently to mechanical grinding and compression producing metastable C&#8208;G(M) and C&#8208;M phases respectively, each of which were isolated and characterised.








Abstract
Organic solids typically adopt close&#8208;packed structures to maximize the weak intermolecular interactions. From this perspective, unraveling the conditions in which a seemingly close&#8208;packed molecular solid undergoes guest&#8208;induced phase transition and shows reversible guest inclusion/desolvation behavior remains a challenge. An organic luminogen, 4&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;benzoic acid (2&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;naphthalen&#8208;1&#8208;ylmethylene)&#8208;hydrazide (2N&#8208;4 OH), produced two types of solids, viz., the yellow emissive C&#8208;Y form and the green emissive C&#8208;G form, of which the latter form was isolated as N.N&#8208;dimethylformamide (DMF) solvate. The green emissive C&#8208;G phase exhibited distinctive responses under conditions of mechanical grinding and compression, which was evident from spectroscopic, thermal, and X&#8208;ray diffraction measurements. Further, when infused with DMF vapor, the C&#8208;Y form transformed into the green emissive metastable C&#8208;M form, which was structurally similar to the metastable phase obtained from the C&#8208;G form upon hydraulic compression. Subsequently, we explain the relation between the C&#8208;Y and C&#8208;G forms, obtained directly upon crystallization, and the metastable C&#8208;M form and the C&#8208;G(M) form obtained after mechanical stimulation.

         <title>Phase Stabilities and Influence on Magnetic and Electrical Properties of the System (MgxMn4&#8208;x)MnVO8</title>

Substitution of divalent manganese by magnesium in Mn5VO8 was found to introduce a change of structure and electrical conductivities.








Abstract
Manganese vanandates have a wide range of interesting material properties, covering magnetic, electrical, and catalytic aspects. Among them, Mn5VO8 is a compound containing manganese in both its trivalent as well as divalent oxidation states with ordering of the different manganese species on different crystallographic sites. In this article, we show that the divalent manganese can be replaced by magnesium fully up to a composition of Mg4MnVO8. For low magnesium content, this results in a change of symmetry from triclinic to monoclinic, whereas for Mg4MnVO8, a trigonal modification can be found in addition to a monoclinic phase. Density Functional Theory based calculations reveal that for magnesium rich compositions, monoclinic and trigonal modifications are energetically similar. Magnetic characterization reveals that the materials are paramagnetic around room temperature. Further, the magnesium substitution results in a strong decrease of electrical conductivity with an increase of the activation energy determined by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy.

         <title>Light&#8208;Driven Generation of Air&#8208;stable Zn(I) Under Ambient Conditions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Light irradiation pumps electrons from carboxylate to bipyridine via the Zn center, generating persistent air&#8208;stable Zn+ species within a 1D polymeric ladder. 








Abstract
Research on the synthesis and stabilization of air&#8208;stable monovalent zinc (Zn+) species under mild conditions remains relatively unexplored. This article reports the synthesis of a new zinc coordination polymer, [Zn2(PA)4(bipy)2]n&#183;nH2O (1) (PA&#160;=&#160;propionate; bipy&#160;=&#160;bipyridine), which generates stable Zn+ species upon photoirradiation under ambient conditions. Compound 1 features a metalloviologen structure built by 1&#8208;D ladder&#8208;like chains. Upon Xe lamp irradiation, it changes from colorless to light brown, which is accompanied by the emergence of new electron absorption bands assigned to bipy radical anions and Zn+ species by UV&#8211;vis and EPR tests. PXRD, Raman, and IR analyses indicate that the crystalline framework remains but distortion happens during photoirradiation. The photoinduced Zn+ species remains stable under ambient conditions for at least 7 days. This work demonstrates that air&#8208;stable Zn+ species can be easily prepared through the coordination assembly of Zn2+ ion, carboxylate and bipyridine and further light stimulation, which will help to understand the chemical bonding nature or find catalytic and other applications of Zn+&#8208;based materials.

         <title>Targeting G&#8208;Rich lncRNA and its Structural Polymorphism with Selective G&#8208;Quadruplex Ligands: An NMR Study</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The REG1CP&#8208;derived RNA oligonucleotide SL15P adopts a parallel G&#8208;quadruplex (rGQ) structure. In this study, we investigate the effect of several well&#8208;characterized ligands, originally developed for DNA GQs, on the RNA counterpart, with the aim of evaluating their binding ability and specific binding modes.








Abstract
Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) play essential regulatory roles, often mediated by complex structural elements such as RNA G&#8208;quadruplexes (rGQs). While ligand interactions with DNA G&#8208;quadruplexes (dGQs) have been extensively studied, for rGQs remain less explored. Here, we studied the SL15P RNA oligonucleotide derived from the REG1CP lncRNA, which adopts a parallel rGQ structure in equilibrium with a hairpin (Hp). A set of 12 small molecules, previously known for their ability to make complex with dGQs, was tested for their ability to bind and stabilize the SL15P rGQ. Using NMR spectroscopy, we analyzed complex formation and assessed whether these ligands could promote rGQ folding under conditions where the Hp structure is favored. Melting experiments with circular dichroism (CD) quantified the thermal stabilization induced by ligand binding. Our results show that ligands known to target dGQs exhibit different behaviors toward rGQs. Among the tested compounds, 360A, PhenDC3, and PDS proved to be the most effective, as they induced well&#8208;defined complex formation and significant stabilization of the SL15P rGQ. PhenDC3 showed evidence of a dual binding interaction. This study emphasizes that the binding of ligands to rGQs can be highly variable and supports the rational design of selective compounds for therapeutic purposes.

         <title>A 2D Chemically Stable Cu&#8208;MOF for Green Synthesis of Bioactive 4H&#8208;Pyran Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly efficient, green Cu&#8208;MOF catalyst,&#160;IITKGP&#8208;54&#160;was strategically designed and developed for the catalytic synthesis of pharmacologically important 2&#8208;amino&#8208;3&#8208;cyano&#8208;4H&#8208;pyran derivatives, thereby expanding the applicability of 2D MOF&#8208;based heterogenous catalysts in one&#8208;pot, sustainable 4H&#8208;pyran synthesis.








Abstract
Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) are widely used as heterogeneous catalysts, offering high densities of tunable active sites for multicomponent organic transformations. However, the development of catalytically efficient and chemically robust 2D MOFs remains a significant challenge, especially under harsh reaction conditions. Herein, we report the green synthesis of a 2D robust mixed&#8208;ligand based Cu(II)&#8208;MOF, IITKGP&#8208;54, demonstrating exceptional chemical stability in water and across a wide range of aqueous pH&#8208;solutions (pH = 2&#8211;10). Owing to the accessible Lewis acidic open metal sites (OMSs), IITKGP&#8208;54 exhibits superior catalytic activities toward rarely explored three&#8208;component condensation reaction to produce pharmacologically important 2&#8208;amino&#8208;3&#8208;cyano&#8208;4H&#8208;pyran derivatives, offering several advantages including low catalyst loading, operation in green solvent, broad substrate compatibility and excellent recyclability without structural degradation, which highlights its superiority as environmentally benign heterogeneous catalyst for this transformation over other homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysts used earlier. IITKGP&#8208;54 expands the utility of 2D MOF catalysts for one&#8208;pot sustainable synthesis of bioactive 4H&#8208;pyran derivatives.

Herein, we report the green synthesis of a 2D robust mixed-ligand based Cu(II)-MOF, &lt;b&gt;IITKGP-54&lt;/b&gt;, demonstrating exceptional chemical stability in water and across a wide range of aqueous pH-solutions (pH = 2&#8211;10). Owing to the accessible Lewis acidic open metal sites (OMSs), &lt;b&gt;IITKGP-54&lt;/b&gt; exhibits superior catalytic activities toward rarely explored three-component condensation reaction to produce pharmacologically important 2-amino-3-cyano-4H-pyran derivatives, offering several advantages including low catalyst loading, operation in green solvent, broad substrate compatibility and excellent recyclability without structural degradation, which highlights its superiority as environmentally benign heterogeneous catalyst for this transformation over other homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysts used earlier. &lt;b&gt;IITKGP-54&lt;/b&gt; expands the utility of 2D MOF catalysts for one-pot sustainable synthesis of bioactive 4H-pyran derivatives.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Tracking Dual&#8208;Pathway Self&#8208;Assembly via Butterfly&#8208;Motion&#8208;Based Molecular Fragment Conformational Transformation in Aqueous Homopolypeptides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Homopolypeptides with terminal VIE fluorophores undergo solvent&#8208;directed self&#8208;assembly into distinct nanostructures. Tetrahydrofuran (THF) induces chiral nanotoroids with strong CPL, while 1,4 &#8208; Dioxane (DOA) forms nonchiral nanorods without CPL. The assembly pathways are monitored in real&#8208;time via ratiometric fluorescence, enabling precise control over chiroptical properties in aqueous media.








Abstract
Despite the inherent chirality of peptides, the development of peptide&#8208;based luminescent nanomaterials has been impeded by weak fluorescence and unclear self&#8208;assembly mechanisms. Herein, we report a straightforward strategy to direct supramolecular assembly by end&#8208;functionalizing homopolypeptides with a vibration&#8208;induced emission (VIE) motif. This system exhibits dual&#8208;pathway self&#8208;assembly, enabling real&#8208;time monitoring of the assembly process via ratiometric fluorescence changes. Depending on the solvent used, the homopolypeptides self&#8208;organize into either nanotoroids or nanorods, which display distinct CPL properties: the nanotoroids exhibit strong CPL activity, whereas the nanorods are CPL&#8208;silent. This work not only establishes a versatile platform for constructing efficient aqueous CPL&#8208;active nanomaterials but also elucidates the correlation between supramolecular morphology and chiroptical output, paving the way for the rational design of biocompatible chiral luminescent systems.

         <title>Hybrid Detergents Facilitate Scalable Charge Reduction and Stabilize Membrane Proteins While Retaining Lipid Interactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hybrid detergents enable the purification and native mass spectrometry analysis of membrane proteins and associated lipids. Chemical tuning of headgroups in hybrid detergents enables control over charge reduction, oligomer stability, and lipid retention, which enables the analysis of intact membrane proteins and their interactions with associated lipids.








Abstract
Membrane protein complexes regulate many biological functions, yet they are incredibly challenging to handle. Detergents are a key enabling technology for purification and analysis as they can provide membrane proteins with controlled solubility, stability, and heterogeneity. However, the design criteria for detergents that enable both the purification and analysis of membrane proteins with their associated lipids remain unclear. Here, we leverage the modular nature of nonionic hybrid detergents to chemically tune molecular parameters that are important for maintaining native oligomeric states of membrane protein complexes and copurifying lipids. Tuning the hydrophilic&#8208;lipophilic balance (HLB), and the relative size of a nonionic head in proximity to a tetraethylene glycol headgroup, led to altered charge reduction, retention of protein oligomers and changed the relative degree of copurifying lipids from purification to analysis in a predictable manner. Our findings represent a significant step forward in the investigation of membrane proteins and interactions with lipids.

         <title>Thienylene&#8208;Based Diradicaloids: Electrochromic Ring&#8208;Closing of Dithienylethene&#8208;Based Bis&#8208;Amidinium Cation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stable crystalline thienylene&#8208;based diradicaloids are reported along with photochromic dithienylethene&#8208;based &#960;&#8208;conjugated spacer. En&#8208;route to this an electrochromic (reductive as well as electron&#8208;mediated) ring&#8208;closing of the dithienylethene&#8208;core is established, an alternative stimulus in place of UV light.








Abstract
Due to the lower aromaticity of thiophene compared to benzene, thiophene&#8208;based diradicaloid compounds prefer larger weightage of their quinoid form (closed&#8208;shell electronic configuration) than their benzoid form (open&#8208;shell electronic configuration). At the same time, the lower aromaticity of thiophene facilitates its participation in electrocyclic reactions and as a result dithienylethene&#8208;derivatives represent a classical example of photochromism. Here a modular approach for the synthesis of crystalline thienylene&#8208;, bithienylene&#8208;, and terthienylene&#8208;based diradicaloids is reported with acyclic diaminocarbene&#8208;scaffold as end&#8208;caps. The influence of the &#960;&#8208;conjugated spacer is reflected in their triplet population at room temperature: thienylene&#8208; and bithienylene&#8208;bridged diradicaloids are EPR inactive whereas the terthienylene&#8208;bridged one exhibits an EPR signal, the intensity of which increases with rising temperature. A dithienylethene&#8208;based photochromic bis&#8208;amidinium cation was also designed and synthesized to obtain a related thienylene&#8208;based diradicaloid. Under two&#8208;electron reduction the crystalline diradicaloid is formed with a concurrent reductive ring&#8208;closing of the dithienylethene&#8208;core. Moreover, a two&#8208;electron oxidation of this dithienylethene&#8208;based diradicaloid leads to the closed&#8208;form of the dithienylethene&#8208;based photochromic bis&#8208;amidinium cation. Overall, this demonstrates the structurally characterized electrochromic (reductive as well as electron&#8208;mediated) ring&#8208;closing of a dithienylethene&#8208;based photochromic &#960;&#8208;non&#8208;conjugated bis&#8208;amidinium cation to the diradicaloid and &#960;&#8208;conjugated bis&#8208;amidinium cation, establishing an alternative stimulus in place of UV light.

         <title>Addressing Sustainability Challenges in Peptide Synthesis with Flow Chemistry and Machine Learning</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A synthetic protocol for polypeptides 6&#8211;58 residue long, using recyclable greener solvent mixture (Anisole/DMSO) was developed and compared to traditional SPPS methods and to state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art synthesizers.








Abstract
The high cost and the large amount of toxic waste generated during peptide production overshadow the current technology, requiring the reduction of excess reagents and the replacement of the solvents used. Advances have been made to replace N,N&#8208;Dimethylformamide with moderate success. By exploring the solvent parameter space, we have selected several mixtures, tested their swelling ability, amino acid solubility, coupling efficiency, and Fmoc&#8208;cleaving capacity, and found the Anisole/DMSO (17:3) mixture to be ideal for coupling. By adjusting the flow parameters, racemization was reduced to&#160;&lt;&#160;2% in the case of His, and&#160;&lt;&#160;1% for Cys. Several mixtures were screened for optimal Fmoc&#8208;cleavage, selected to cover the solvent parameter space uniformly. To test the selected solvent mixtures for aspartimide formation, and Fmoc&#8208;cleavage efficiency, both Scorpion Toxin II (VKDGYI) and JR10&#8208;mer (WFTTLISTIM) challenging sequences were synthesized. Fmoc&#8208;cleavage parameter optimization was performed using a machine learning algorithm (Bayesian Optimization) to reduce aspartimide formation and maximize Fmoc&#8208;deprotection. With the final parameters obtained, the Aib&#8208;ACP (10&#8208;mer), the glucagon like peptide 1 (GLP&#8208;1, 30&#8208;mer) and bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor (BPTI, 58&#8208;mer) polypeptides were synthesized with high efficiency and synthetic speed (12&#160;min/cycle). The method is ideal for high temperature synthetic approaches and outperforms current state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art synthesizers.

         <title>Synthesis of Aza&#8208;indeno&#8208;aza&#8208;fluoranthene and Constitutional Isomers by Ring&#8208;Size Selective C&#8211;H Activation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of constitutional isomers of aza&#8208;indeno&#8208;aza&#8208;fluoranthene with different ring sizes has been synthesized. Their product distribution was controlled by adjusting parameters such as base, temperature, solvent, or additive in the Pd&#8208;catalyzed direct arylation step, thereby providing an overview about the options to control ring&#8208;size selectivity in C&#8211;H activation reactions.








Abstract

&lt;p&gt;A series of constitutional isomers of aza-indeno-aza-fluoranthene with different ring sizes has been synthesized. Their product distribution was controlled by adjusting parameters such as base, temperature, solvent, or additive in the Pd-catalyzed direct arylation step, thereby providing an overview about the options to control ring-size selectivity in C&#8211;H activation reactions.

         <dc:description>
A library of cationic dinuclear Ru(II)&#8208;&#951;&#8310;&#8208;arene analogues was developed to assess how overall charge and Ru&#8211;Ru distance influence DNA binding noncovalent interactions and cytotoxicity. NMR studies showed multiple binding modes with the B&#8208;form DNA oligonucleotide d(5&#900;&#8208;CGCGAATTCGCG&#8208;3&#900;)2, while the complexes displayed micromolar IC50 values against MCF&#8208;7, A2780, and A2780cis&#8208;resistant cell lines.








Abstract
A series of dinuclear &#951;&#8310;&#8208;arene Ru(II) complexes with the general formulae {[(&#951;&#8310;&#8208;p&#8208;cym)Ru(L1)]2(&#956;&#8208;BL&#8208;i)}2+ (1)&#8211;(3) and {[(&#951;&#8310;&#8208;p&#8208;cym)2Ru2(L1)(L2)](&#956;&#8208;BL&#8208;i)}3+ (4)&#8211;(6), [L1&#160;=&#160;benzo[h]quinoline (bq), L2&#160;=&#160;1,10&#8208;phenanthroline (phe) and BL&#8208;i the bridging ligands with i&#160;=&#160;1 &#8208;3, 4,4&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine (BL&#8208;1), 1,2&#8208;bis(4&#8208;pyridyl)ethane (BL&#8208;2) and 1,3&#8208;bis(4&#8208;pyridyl)propane (BL&#8208;3)] were synthesized and fully characterized by high&#8208;resolution mass spectrometry and NMR spectroscopy. The crystal structures of the complexes (1)&#8211;(3) were determined by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. DNA binding interactions of the water&#8208;soluble chloride salts of the complexes (4)&#8211;(6) were investigated by NMR spectroscopy using the B&#8208;type DNA model oligonucleotide duplex d(5&#8242;&#8208;CGCGAATTCGCG&#8208;3&#8242;)2. 1H NMR chemical shift changes revealed that the chelating ligands (phe or bq) partially intercalate and/or bind in the helix minor groove. Among these, complex {[(&#951;&#8310;&#8208;p&#8208;cym)2Ru2(phe)(bq)](&#956;&#8208;BL&#8208;1)}3+, (4), induced the most pronounced perturbations, including partial helix unwinding. Fluorescence quenching experiments yielded the Stern&#8211;Volmer constants (Ksv) and the binding constants (Kb) in the moderate&#8208;to&#8208;high affinity range, consistent with the NMR observations. Preliminary cytotoxicity studies showed that the chloride salts of the complexes (1)&#8211;(6) exhibit low&#8208;micromolar IC50 values against MCF&#8208;7, A2780, and cisplatin&#8208;resistant A2780cis&#8208;resistant cell lines, while showing moderate selectivity for cancer cells over normal fibroblasts.

         <title>Golgi&#8208;Targeted Viscosity Fluorescent Probe for Monitoring Acute Lung Injury</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, we present a novel Golgi&#8208;targeted fluorescent probe, GV, designed for highly sensitive and selective monitoring of viscosity changes during Golgi stress in an acute lung injury (ALI) model. GV was successfully applied to visualize elevated Golgi viscosity in living cells under various stimuli. More importantly, we directly demonstrated a significant increase in Golgi viscosity in ALI mouse models. With its excellent photophysical properties and good biocompatibility, GV also shows great potential for exploring the pathological processes of other viscosity&#8208;related diseases.








Abstract
Acute lung injury (ALI) is a severe respiratory disorder driven by uncontrolled inflammation, where early diagnosis and intervention are critical. Recent evidence implicates Golgi apparatus dysfunction in ALI progression, but its biophysical changes remain unexplored. Here, we report GV, a novel Golgi&#8208;targeted fluorescent probe with high photostability, low cytotoxicity, and excellent specificity, enabling sensitive imaging of viscosity changes under stress. Using both cellular and mouse models of ALI, we demonstrated a significant increase in Golgi viscosity during disease progression. These findings suggest that Golgi viscosity may serve as a potential biomarker for ALI and establish GV as a powerful tool for investigating organelle&#8208;level biophysical alterations in inflammatory diseases.

         <title>Effect of Thionation of the Carbonyl Groups in Naphthalimide&#8208;Phenoxazine Electron Donor&#8211;Acceptor Dyads on the Excited&#8208; State Dynamics: Transient Optical and Electron Paramagnetic Resonance Spectral Studies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thionation: Enhanced SOC and Unusually Large ZFS Parameters: Thionated electron donor&#8211;acceptor dyads based on naphthalimide (NI) and phenoxazine (PXZ) were prepared and the photophysical properties were studied. Fluorescence quenching and efficient intersystem crossing (ISC) were observed for the dyad with the NI unit thionated. Large zero field splitting D value of the triplet state indicates that the enhanced spin&#8208;orbit coupling effect by the thionated carbonyls in the chromophore.








Abstract
We performed thionation of the electron acceptor naphthalimide (NI) moiety in donor&#8211;acceptor (D&#8208;A) dyads in a series of thio&#8208;substituted D&#8208;A dyads. Thionation significantly enhances the electron&#8208;accepting ability of the chromophore, facilitating the formation of low&#8208;lying charge&#8208;separated (CS) states. Femtosecond transient absorption spectra revealed intersystem crossing (ISC) rate constants of S&#8208;NI&#8208;PXZ (kISC&#160;=&#160;3.8&#160;&#215; 1011 s&#8722;1) and DS&#8208;NI&#8208;PXZ (kISC&#160;=&#160;2.4&#160;&#215; 1011 s&#8722;1), which are interestingly independent of the number of sulfur atoms. Generally, fluorescence quenching was observed due to the rapid ISC process. Native NI&#8208;PXZ exhibits thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF). Thionation increased the singlet&#8208;triplet energy gap, making the TADF vanish. In n&#8208;hexane, nanosecond transient absorption spectroscopy detected the triplet lifetimes shortened from 11.6 &#181;s of NI&#8208;PXZ to 0.66 &#181;s for S&#8208;NI&#8208;PXZ and 0.25 &#181;s for DS&#8208;NI&#8208;PXZ. Time&#8208;resolved electron paramagnetic resonance revealed the large zero&#8208;field splitting D value (4200&#8211;9800&#160;MHz) of the triplet state of the thionated derivatives, which is due to the much larger SOC matrix elements of triplet state of DS&#8208;NI&#8208;PXZ (ca. 135 cm&#8722;1) and DS&#8208;NI (ca. 136 cm&#8722;1) than the nonthionated NI (3.1 cm&#8722;1). Thionation of the carbonyl groups in chromophore is a promising method for design of triplet photosensitizers to achieve fast ISC.

         <title>Unexpected Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence/Long Persistent Luminescence Dual Changes Induced by Conformational Freezing in Difluoroboron &#946;&#8208;Diketonate Systems</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents unexpected dual afterglow changes induced by conformational freezing in difluoroboron &#946;&#8208;diketonate systems: cyclized systems exhibit green RTP and weak OLPL, while noncyclized systems show blue TADF&#8208;type afterglow with stronger OLPL. This inversion, stemming from &#916;EST differences and variations in charge separation and exciton harvesting, shows great potential for dynamic anticounterfeiting and multilevel encryption.








Abstract
Room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) and organic long persistent luminescence (OLPL) materials are the current research hotspots in the field of luminescence and have broad application prospects, but afterglow systems with stimulus response or dynamic changes are still rare. Herein, we report unexpected dual afterglow change induced by conformational freezing in difluoroboron &#946;&#8208;diketonate (BF2bdk) systems. The cyclized BF2bdk system (after conformational freezing) exhibits bright green RTP followed by weak OLPL, whereas noncyclized BF2bdk system (before conformational freezing) displays blue thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF)&#8208;type afterglow with subsequent stronger OLPL. In&#8208;depth investigations reveal that the inversion in afterglow intensity and mechanism change arise from the difference in &#916;EST as well as the ability to undergo charge separation and harvest of excitons. Besides, this dual afterglow changing behavior with brightness inversion over time demonstrates significant potential for advanced dynamic anticounterfeiting and multilevel information encryption applications.

         <title>Porous Organic Frameworks Utilizing Halogen&#183;&#183;&#183;Halogen Interactions of X4&#8211;tetra[2,3]Thienylene (X&#160;=&#160;Br, I): Guest Dynamics and Dielectric Response</title>

         <dc:description>
X4&#8208;tetrahalo[2,3]thienylene with four halogen atoms (X&#160;=&#160;Br and I) at the molecular terminals were used to investigate the formation of various guest inclusion crystals through intermolecular halogen&#183;&#183;&#183;halogen (X&#183;&#183;&#183;X) interactions and the dynamics of guest molecules.








Abstract
X4&#8208;tetrabromo[2,3]thienylene (1, Br4&#8208;tetra[2,3]thienylene) and X4&#8208;tetraiodotetra[2,3]thienylene (2, I4&#8208;tetra[2,3]thienylene) were used to investigate the formation of various guest inclusion crystals through intermolecular halogen&#183;&#183;&#183;halogen (X&#183;&#183;&#183;X) interactions and the dynamics of guest molecules. 1 and 2 formed host&#8211;guest crystals with aromatic molecules such as benzene (Bz), toluene (Tol), anisole (An), and chlorobenzene (ClBz). X&#8208;ray crystal structure analysis revealed the formation of a channel structure where 1D chains formed by intermolecular X&#183;&#183;&#183;X interactions were arranged in a grid pattern. Host lattices of 1 and 2 were capable of reversibly adsorbing and desorbing Tol molecules while maintaining crystallinity. Dielectric measurements showed dielectric relaxation due to molecular motion of polar guest molecules (Tol and ClBz) in the host lattice formed by molecule 2. In particular, crystals containing ClBz exhibited rotational dynamics of guest molecules with increasing temperature. These results provide important insights for the design of flexible porous materials using halogen&#183;&#183;&#183;halogen interactions and the creation of dielectric materials based on guest molecule dynamics.

         <title>MnOX&#8208;CeO2 Bimetal Oxides Derived from Ce&#8208;Based MOFs as a Synergistic Catalyst Boost the Aerobic Oxidative Dehydrogenation of N&#8208;Heterocycles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesized bimetallic oxides MnOX&#8208;CeO2 by the pyrolysis of Mn/Ce&#8208;BTC MOFs have been employed as a heterogenous catalyst for the oxidative dehydrogenation of N&#8208;heterocycles to N&#8208;heteroaromatics with oxygen as the solo oxidant.








Abstract
The development of synthetic methods for N&#8208;heterocyclic compounds have garnered considerable attention due to their significance in diverse chemical processes. Among various synthesis methods, the direct oxidative dehydrogenation of saturated substances to N&#8208;heteroaromatics is a simple and efficient method. This study utilized the pyrolysis of Mn/Ce&#8208;BTC MOFs precursor to prepare MnOX&#8208;CeO2 composites as a heterogeneous catalyst for the aerobic oxidative dehydrogenation of N&#8208;heterocycles. The MnOX&#8208;CeO2 composites were analyzed with various characterization techniques including XRD, SEM, TEM, BET, XPS, ICP&#8208;OES and Raman spectroscopy. The detailed findings from experiments indicate that the catalytic activity of the composites has been significantly improved due to the synergistic effect of MnOX&#8208;CeO2 and the abundant oxygen vacancies on the surface of the catalyst. And the related mechanism experiments reveal that reactive oxygen species (ROS) are involved in this catalytic system. Furthermore, MnOX&#8208;CeO2 composites retain excellent catalytic performance even after ten recycles.

         <dc:description>
A systematic co&#8208;crystallization&#8208;study of a tridentate ortho&#8208;carborane&#8208;based halogen&#8208;bond donor with halides was performed. Several association complexes are evaluated to give further insights into the halogen bond&#8208;strength of this moiety. For iodide, rare octahedral coordination via a sandwich&#8208;like complexation was observed in the solid state when using non&#8208;coordinating and &#8220;electron&#8208;rich&#8221; cations. This is to our knowledge the first such coordination by halogen&#8208;bonding multidentate receptors.
 








Abstract
We recently introduced multidentate halogen&#8208;bonding receptors based on C&#8208;iodinated ortho&#8208;Carborane moieties. Following up on our results in solution, which indicated a second binding event for sub&#8208;stochiometric concentrations of halide guests, we herein present a systematic co&#8208;crystallization study with halides to further evaluate the halogen&#8208;bonding capacities of these halogen&#8208;bonding catalysts. The obtained solid&#8208;state structures include two rare examples of octahedral coordination via halogen bonding of a halide ion by a pair of tridentate receptors.

         <title>Transitioning Formamide Solvothermal Syntheses of MOFs to Less Toxic Solvents</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal&#8208;organic Frameworks (MOFs) are commonly synthesized in toxic formamide solvents. This study investigates the synthetic factors required for effective removal of formamides across various classes of MOFs, providing a foundation for designing new sustainable MOF syntheses. Metal and linker solubility, as well as presence of base capable of deprotonating the linker, emerge as critical determinants of MOF phase formation success.








Abstract
Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) are most commonly synthesized in toxic formamide solvents. Though some progress has been made for certain classes, zinc carboxylate MOFs are particularly reliant on formamide solvents. Transitioning away from these solvents is difficult because they serve multifaceted roles in MOF formation chemistry and phase direction. Herein, the synthetic factors required for the effective removal of formamide solvents across various classes of MOFs are investigated. Complete formamide removal is achieved for IRMOF&#8208;5, IRMOF&#8208;3, HKUST&#8208;1, and Zn&#8208;MOF&#8208;74. The function of formamide solvents in MOF synthesis is replicated using a system comprising tetrahydrofuran (THF) and a base additive. When designing MOF syntheses without formamide solvents, the solubility of both the organic linker and metal salt, along with the use of a base possessing sufficient pKa to deprotonate multitopic linkers, emerge as critical determinants of successful MOF formation. These insights provide a foundation for designing new sustainable MOF syntheses.

         <title>The Mystery of Dibenzoterrylene: a Clar&#8208;interlocked Biphenalenyl Biradical</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We discovered a unique conformational switch that transforms a molecule from a closed&#8208;shell to a pronounced biradical state. This geometry&#8208;induced control of electronic ground states offers a design principle for stable, low&#8208;gap open&#8208;shell systems with potential applications in spintronics and responsive organic materials.








Abstract
The first time in&#8208;depth characterization of dibenzoterrylene (DBT) was performed by a combination of various experimental and computational techniques. First structure confirmation and atom assignment were achieved by means of 2D&#8208;NMR and powder X&#8208;ray. DFT methods shed light on the conformational space of DBT and, more importantly, on the complex electronic structure of the molecule. DBT appears to be the first studied molecule, two low&#8208;lying conformers of which have drastically different biradical character. EPR and NMR studies show the effect of solvent on the population of the biradical state. This demonstrates the perspectives of the usage of DBT and its derivatives in spintronics and other quantum technologies.

         <title>Excited&#8208;State Proton Transfer in Push&#8208;Pull N&#8208;Methyl Pyridium Reversible Super&#8208;Photoacids Ruled by Intramolecular Hydrogen&#8208;Bond&#8208;Like Interactions</title>

         <dc:description>
Push&#8208;pull A+&#8208;&#960;&#8208;D N&#8208;methyl pyridinium derivatives were found to act as efficient reversible superphotoacids. Upon excitation, they undergo a fast ESPT but recombine with the released proton when the excitation is turned off. In the ortho isomers, intramolecular hydrogen&#8208;bond&#8208;like interactions between the hydroxyl group and the ethenic hydrogen are strengthened in the excited state, as a consequence of ICT, leading to enhanced photoacidity.








Abstract
Three push&#8208;pull N&#8208;methyl pyridium phenols have been thoroughly investigated for their photoacid behavior through stationary and time&#8208;resolved spectroscopic techniques. Fluorimetric titrations revealed a clear excited&#8208;state proton transfer (ESPT) with negative pKa* values for the two molecules with the phenol attached in ortho relative to the double bond, so as to be regarded as super&#8208;photoacids. Conversely, no proton transfer was observed when the hydroxyl group was in the para position. Quantum&#8208;mechanical calculations confirmed that intramolecular hydrogen&#8208;bond&#8208;like interactions, only attainable in the ortho isomers, are strengthened by the charge transfer process occurring upon excitation, resulting in enhanced acidity. Ultrafast transient absorption and fluorescence up&#8208;conversion (UC) spectroscopies allowed direct observation of the ESPT process on the picosecond time scale, in agreement with the negative pKa*. In addition, nanosecond laser flash photolysis unraveled the recombination of the conjugated base with the proton once returned to the ground state. The time for this recombination was slowed down by one order of magnitude in the presence of a proton scavenger. These findings demonstrated both the reversible nature of these super&#8208;photoacids, thus regulating the pH of the nearby environment through light irradiation, and their ability to give a proton to a second molecule, for potential photocatalytic applications.

         <title>Pre&#8208;sodiation Technology for Interface Engineering in Sodium&#8208;ion Batteries: Progress, Challenges, and Future Directions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review comprehensively analyzes the transformative role of pre&#8208;sodiation in engineering interfacial layers, with focused attention on the solid electrolyte interface (SEI) and cathode electrolyte interface (CEI).








Abstract
Pre&#8208;sodiation technology has emerged as a pivotal strategy for compensating active sodium loss in sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) during both initial charging and long&#8208;term cycling, thereby significantly enhancing their electrochemical performance. While significant progress has been made in developing diverse pre&#8208;sodiation methods, there remains a notable gap in systematic reviews addressing their specific impacts on battery interfacial layers. This review comprehensively analyzes the transformative role of pre&#8208;sodiation in engineering interfacial layers, with focused attention on the solid electrolyte interface (SEI) and cathode electrolyte interface (CEI). Through detailed analysis of recent advances, we delineate the mechanisms through which pre&#8208;sodiation modulates the chemical composition and structural organization of these critical interfaces, while concurrently suppressing detrimental side reactions. Furthermore, future challenges and research directions for pre&#8208;sodiation technology were identified, offering valuable perspectives to accelerate the optimization and commercialization of SIBs.

         <title>Catalytic Template Induces Carbon Material with High Microporosity and Large Pore Volume as Electrode Material for Supercapacitors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel N,O&#8208;doped microporous carbon (HMC) is synthesized from 8&#8208;hydroxyquinoline using a MgO catalytic template. HMC exhibits a high microporosity (59.8%) and large pore volume (1.22 cm3/g). As a supercapacitor electrode, it delivers a high energy density of 75.1 Wh/kg at 2000 W/kg and maintains 67.8 Wh/kg at 40 kW/kg, outperforming commercial YP&#8208;80F.








Abstract
At the molecular level, it is challenging to create highly microporous carbon materials from inexpensive molecules rather than using the more common method of carbonization/activation of biomasses. In this study, we present a novel approach using a catalytic template to induce the formation of microporous carbon doped with N and O functionalities with 8&#8208;hydroxyquinoline (8&#8208;HQ) as a starting material and MgO as a catalyst. The resulting product, referred to as HMC, exhibits a hierarchical structure with a high microporosity of 59.8%, large pore volume of 1.22 cm3/g, along with rich N, O functionalities, and hydrophilic properties. Due to its highly microporous nature, as an electrode for a symmetric supercapacitor, HMC demonstrates superior energy storage capabilities in a 1.0&#160;M TEABF4/AN (tetraethylammonium tetrafluoroborate/acetonitrile) electrolyte, achieving a capacity of 135 F/g@ 1.0 A/g, high energy density of 75.1&#160;Wh/kg at 2000&#160;W/kg. Even at a superhigh power density of 40&#160;kW/kg, the energy density remains as high as 67.8&#160;Wh/kg. Moreover, HMC outperforms a well&#8208;known industrial carbon, YP&#8208;80F (Kuraray), and other recently reported carbon&#8208;based devices in terms of energy storage levels.

         <title>&#956;&#8208;Oxo Dimers of Silicon Porphyrazines and Their Interlayer Interactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
&#956;&#8208;Oxo dimers of octaaryl&#8208;substituted silicon porphyrazines (SiPzs) were synthesized for the first time. The interlayer interactions that govern the rotation dynamics and optical and electrochemical properties were investigated. In addition, intriguing two&#8208;photon absorption properties based on the reverse saturable absorption mechanism mediated by the intramolecular charge transfer interactions were revealed.








Abstract
&#956;&#8208;Oxo dimers of octaaryl&#8208;substituted silicon porphyrazines (SiPzs) were synthesized for the first time. The steric congestion due to the peripheral aryl groups attenuated the rotation of the SiPz units around the Si&#8211;O&#8211;Si axis, resulting in the fixed D4 symmetric conformations with the torsion angle of &#8764;23&#176; at room temperature or lower, which were unambiguously elucidated by the single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis and variable&#8208;temperature NMR studies. The interlayer molecular orbital interactions between the stacked SiPz units perturbed UV/vis absorption spectra and electrochemical properties of the dimers. In addition, the hetero&#8208;type dimer, bearing electron&#8208;donating and electron&#8208;withdrawing aryl&#8208;substituents on each SiPz unit, showed a large two&#8208;photon absorption cross&#8208;section based on the reverse saturable absorption mechanism mediated by the intramolecular charge transfer interactions.

         <title>Mechanochemically Derived Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission (AIE) Active Polyaromatic Amides and Dendritic&#8208;Like Molecules With Structure&#8208;Dependent Photophysical and Receptor Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mechanochemical synthesis of aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) active polyaromatic monoamides and dendritic&#8208;like molecules was designed. The construction of a glass mill consisting of components available in any chemical laboratory, an alternative to the comm ercial ball mills, was demonstrated. Application of the title molecules as molecular receptors of halide anions was established, demonstrating their structure&#8208;property relationships.








Abstract
A mechanochemical synthesis in a ball mill of a series of polyaromatic AIE&#8208;active monoamides and dendritic&#8208;like molecules has been demonstrated. The use of mechanochemistry allowed high yields to be achieved in a short time. Additionally, an in&#8208;house made mill composed of simple components available in any chemical laboratory (termed WUT Glass Mill) was constructed as an alternative to the commercially available ball mill. Despite its simple design, this equipment enabled higher isolated yields to be achieved as compared to the commercial ball mill, together with providing parametrized solid&#8208;state reaction conditions. Photophysical properties of the resultant AIE&#8208;active monoamides and dendritic&#8208;like molecules, as well as their application as receptors for halide anions, as representative analytes, were comprehensively studied. The relationships between the structure and photophysical as well as receptor properties of the designed molecules were highlighted, with identified crucial structural parameters toward providing excellent photophysical properties or selectivity toward detection of soft or hard bases. As the result of described studies, a new class of mechanochemically&#8208;synthesized AIE&#8208;active molecular receptors with tunable photophysical and receptor properties is reported for the first time.

         <title>Mn2+ Complex of a Fluorinated CDTA&#8208;Derivative: Stability, Inertness, and Paramagnetic 1H, 17O, and 19F Relaxation Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The fluorinated CDTA&#8208;bisamide derivative ligand, L2, forms a stable and highly inert complex with Mn2+. MnL2 has one inner sphere water coordinated to the central metal ion, hence good proton relaxivity, and the paramagnetic metal ion induces important acceleration of 19F relaxation, provides good signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratios on 19F phantom UTE MR images, &#160;which altogether provide combined 19F and 1H MRI detection capabilities.








Abstract
L2 is a bisamide derivative of cyclohexyl&#8208;diamine tetraacetate (CDTA) containing one trifluoromethyl&#8208;piperidine&#8208; and one dimethyl&#8208;amide. While the amide functions are stable at pH 7, at pH 4.35 hydrolysis occurs after 1 day, and it is faster for the amide involving the piperidine. pH potentiometry showed lower basicity for L2 than for CDTA, and similar stability for the two complexes (pMn&#160; = &#160;8.28&#160;vs. 8.68 for MnL2 and MnCDTA, respectively). The replacement of carboxylates by amides results in two orders of magnitude higher kinetic inertness for MnL2 (t1/2 = 1134&#160;hours vs. 12&#160;hours; pH 7.4). 17O NMR confirmed one inner sphere water in MnL2 and fast exchange (kex298&#160; = &#160;2.8&#160;&#215;&#160;107 s&#8722;1). Its proton relaxivity is remarkable for a small Mn2+ chelate (r1&#160; = &#160;4.59 mM&#8722;1s&#8722;1, 25 &#176;C, 20&#160;MHz). In the complex, 19F relaxation is strongly accelerated with respect to free L2, with more important effect on longitudinal (130&#8208;fold), than on transverse relaxation (25&#8211;70&#8208;fold). A Mn&#9472;F distance of &#8764;8&#160;&#197; was estimated from the 19F relaxation rates. MnL2 provides good signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratios on 19F phantom UTE MR images. These data show that fluorinated, monohydrated Mn2+ complexes can offer both 1H and 19F MRI detection.

         <title>Synergy of Theory, NMR, and Rotational Spectroscopy to Unravel Structural Details of D&#8208;Altroside Puckering and Side Chain Orientation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We combine electronic structure theory calculations, NMR, and rotational spectroscopy to study ring and side chain conformations of altrosides. The calculations identify low&#8208;energy structures among thousands of conformers. Fitting computed and experimental coupling constants reveals conformer mixtures in solution. Rotational spectroscopy benchmarks the calculations and provides information on side chain orientations.








Abstract
The conformational characteristics of carbohydrates significantly affect their chemical and biological properties; however, the conformational analysis of sugar rings (puckers) is hampered by a methodological deficit. Here, we show that the combination of NMR spectroscopy, electronic structure theory calculations, and rotational spectroscopy can provide a deep insight into the conformational degrees of freedom of sugars. Combining electronic structure theory methods and global conformational search algorithms can efficiently yield an overview and free energy ranking for thousands of possible conformers of a given monosaccharide. Using NMR spectra, a fit of computed and measured spin&#8211;spin coupling constants allows to qualitatively and quantitatively assign the ring puckers in a dynamic mixture. However, a gap between theory and experiment remains, due to the difficulty to accurately describe solvent effects in electronic structure calculations. Here, we overcome this gap by applying rotational spectroscopy, as it yields highly accurate structural data in the gas phase. This not only allows to benchmark computational data and demonstrate the accuracy that can be reached by structure prediction methods, but also yields valuable information about the side chain conformation in saccharides. We provide a detailed investigation of d&#8208;altrose derivatives, which exhibit conformational flexibility regarding both side chains and ring puckers.

         <title>Synergistic Interaction Between Ir&#8208;N&#8208;C and Ru Nanoparticles for Enhanced Activity Toward Alkaline Hydrogen Oxidation Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ir&#8208;N&#8208;C&#8208;supported Ru electrocatalysts were synthesized for promoting their alkaline hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) performance. The electronic interaction between Ru catalytic centers and Ir&#8208;N&#8208;C substrate would modulate the d&#8208;band structure for optimizing their adsorption behavior toward vital hydrogen and hydroxyl species, which accelerates the alkaline HOR kinetics and enhances the CO&#8208;tolerance simultaneously.








Abstract
Boosting the sluggish alkaline hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) kinetics with reduced amounts of noble metals is essential for the commercial applications of anion exchange membrane fuel cells. The employment of single atom embedded N&#8208;doped carbon could remarkably increase both the catalytic efficiency and durability for various electrochemical processes when coupled with metal nanoparticles. Here, an ultrasmall Ru nanoparticle supported on an Ir&#8208;N&#8208;C framework (Ru/Ir&#8208;N&#8208;C) is prepared. Benefitting from the introduction of Ir&#8208;N&#8208;C substrates, the HOR activity and CO&#8208;tolerance of the obtained Ru/Ir&#8208;N&#8208;C electrocatalyst are significantly enhanced. Electrochemical experiments and density functional theory calculations unveil the charge redistribution engenders modulated band structure and orbital overlapping interaction, which could provide suitable adsorption sites with optimal hydrogen binding energy and significantly strengthened hydroxyl binding energy, thereby leading to promoted reaction kinetics and CO desorption process. This work uncovers the decisive role of optimal adsorption behavior and electronic properties induced by the synergistic effect between Ir&#8208;N&#8208;C and Ru active centers, offering new insights into multi&#8208;functionalized noble&#8208;metal&#8208;based catalysts designing.
