         <title>Zero&#8208;Dimensional Lead&#8208;Free Perovskite Single Crystals for the Sensitive Detection of Visible Light and X&#8208;Rays</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Zero&#8208;dimensional lead&#8208;free MA3Bi2I9 single crystals with high anisotropy is developed to fabricate photo&#8208; and X&#8208;ray detectors with a low detection limit. Detectors perpendicular to the {001} crystal plane exhibit better weak light detection capabilities compared to devices parallel to the {001} crystal plane.







Abstract
The excellent performance and facile fabrication process of perovskite semiconductor materials make them highly promising candidates in the field of optoelectronic devices. Whether for visible light or X&#8208;rays, detectors with low detection limits can better identify weak light signals, significantly reducing the intensity of the received light source during device operation. In particular, for X&#8208;ray detectors, reducing X&#8208;ray dosage can greatly enhance the safety of X&#8208;ray imaging technology. This work develops detectors with low detection limit based on zero&#8208;dimensional (0D) MA3Bi2I9 single crystals. The anisotropy of MA3Bi2I9 and its influence on the detector&#8216;s performance were investigated in detail. Detectors perpendicular to the (001) crystal plane have better weak light detection capability and require significantly less light intensity compared to devices parallel to the (001) crystal plane. X&#8208;ray detector with a limit of detection (LoD) of 0.68&#8197;nGyair&#8201;s&#8722;1 and sensitivity of 5072&#8197;&#956;C&#8201;Gyair&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;2 was obtained. The present study offers comprehensive insights into the operational mechanism of layered perovskites, which can provide valuable guidelines for future designs and fabrications of highly sensitive photo and X&#8208;ray detectors.

Fluorinated Heterocycles A comprehensive study on the physicochemical properties of gem&#8208;difluorinated saturated O&#8208;heterocyclic substituents, as well as their non&#8208;fluorinated and carbocyclic counterparts is reported. The potential of the title fragments for bioisosteric replacements in medicinal chemistry is illustrated by the synthesis and evaluation of MAPK inhibitors &#8211; analogs of clinical candidate R&#8208;1487.







Abstract
A comprehensive study on the physicochemical properties of gem&#8208;fluorinated O&#8208;heterocyclic substituents is reported. Systematic additive effects of introducing O&#8208; and gem&#8208;CF2 group introduction on acidic properties (pKa) of the corresponding carboxylic acids/protonated primary amines were demonstrated. The impact of the O/CF2 moieties on lipophilicity (LogP) was found to be complex; significant mutual influence of the corresponding polar moieties governed the compound's overall properties in this case. Biological evaluation of MAPK kinase inhibitors incorporating the title substituents demonstrated their utility as promising fragments for bioisosteric replacements in drug discovery campaigns.

         <title>Unveiling the Long&#8208;Awaited Aldehyde Intermediate in Oxidative Dephosphorylation: A Unique Approach to Access Useful Carboxaldehydes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This is the first report to trap and isolate aldehyde intermediate from oxidative dephosphorylation reactions that typically generate symmetrically substituted alkenes from organophosphonates. Thus, a unique synthetic strategy has been developed to access structurally diverse aldehydes by oxidizing phosphonate carbanions using molecular oxygen.







Abstract
Oxidative dephosphorylation reactions usually generate symmetrically substituted alkenes from organophosphonates. Even the ubiquitous presence of oxygen can produce such alkenes inadvertently as a side product in small amounts from Wittig/Horner&#8208;Wadsworth&#8208;Emmons (HWE) reactions. So far, aldehydes have been expected to be the on&#8208;pathway intermediate since their discovery, but there was no substantial experimental evidence to support this. Herein, aldehyde intermediates are judiciously trapped before forming alkene on dephosphorylation reactions of diverse phosphonates. Consequently, a unique synthetic strategy has been established to access structurally diverse aldehydes by oxidizing phosphonate carbanions using molecular oxygen. This is the first report to trap and isolate aldehydes since the historical discovery of Wittig/HWE reactions. Only ketone/amide was isolated as a support, but no aldehyde. The optimization studies offer 48&#8211;84&#8201;% reaction yields of such aldehydes. The mechanistic studies are validated with reaction mixture 1H and 31P&#8208;NMR studies. Along with other various aldehydes, a unique class of structurally diverse anthracenyl aldehydes exhibiting intense fluorescence has been identified. The extended process to bis&#8208;phosphonates led to bis&#8208;carboxaldehyde forming in 52&#8211;68&#8201;% yield within 30&#8197;min. The scope is further extended to achieve 2,1,3&#8208;benzothiadiazole&#8208;linked phosphonate, functionalized with carboxaldehyde.

         <title>Red Room Temperature Phosphorescence in Non&#8208;Aromatic Carbonized Polymer Dots</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Non&#8208;aromatic red organic room temperature phosphorescence with emission at 605 and 645&#8197;nm is achieved through inducing and confining carboxyl dimer association (CDA), a unique hydrogen&#8208;bonded coupling red phosphorescence unit, in carbonized polymer dots (CPDs) with polyacrylic acid (PAA) and succinic acid (SA) as precursors.







Abstract
Achieving red organic room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) remains a significant challenge, especially in a non&#8208;aromatic system. Herein, red RTP with emission at 605 and 645&#8197;nm is achieved through inducing and confining carboxyl dimer association (CDA), a unique hydrogen&#8208;bonded coupling red phosphorescence unit, in non&#8208;aromatic carbonized polymer dots (CPDs). The CPDs are synthesized via microwave method by using polyacrylic acid (PAA), succinic acid (SA), and traces of phosphoric acid as precursors. Small molecule SA can flexibly enter the polymer cluster of PAA and pair with the isolated carboxyl groups to form CDA. The intrinsic local carbonized structure formed in CPDs can effectively stabilize CDA to achieve red RTP. The red afterglow can last for 1&#8197;s to naked eye, and the corresponding lifetimes for emission at 605 and 645&#8197;nm were 61 and 45&#8197;ms, respectively, after 365&#8197;nm excitation off. This work not only reported the non&#8208;aromatic red organic RTP materials for the first time, but also explored CPDs as an effective platform for achieving such non&#8208;aromatic long&#8208;wavelength RTP.

         <title>New Concept on the Generation and Regulation of Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recently circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) has attracted tremendous attention. But the simultaneously rational control of chirality and luminescence still remains a challenge. This concept overviews the current advances in the diverse matching rules for the convenient generation and regulation of CPL, mainly including fluorescence&#8208;selective absorption, circularly polarized fluorescence energy transfer, and chiral communication.







Abstract
Circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) has attracted tremendous attention because of its significant application prospect across multiple fields of three&#8208;dimensional display, data storage, and information encryption. Chirality and luminescence are two necessary prerequisites for the generation of CPL. However, controlling these two factors simultaneously in a rational manner remains a challenge. Herein, we highlight the recent advances on the rational generation and regulation of CPL through the new concept, named matching rules, mainly including fluorescence&#8208;selective absorption, circularly polarized fluorescence energy transfer, and chiral communication between excited state and ground state. An important commonality among these strategies is that they need a good overlap of the corresponding spectra between the luminescent part (fluorescence, phosphorescence, or CPL) and the chiral part (organic, inorganic, or organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid materials), which can be contactless and separate. Different from most previous studies, no covalent or noncovalent interactions between the two parts are required, which makes them more facile and convenient. Finally, we summarize the main advantages of these strategies and the current challenges. We expect this concept to offer insightful and novel understanding and inspiration on CPL generation and regulation.

&lt;p&gt;Recently circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) has attracted tremendous attention. But the simultaneously rational control of chirality and luminescence still remains a challenge. This concept overviews the current advances in the diverse matching rules for the convenient generation and regulation of CPL, mainly including fluorescence-selective absorption, circularly polarized fluorescence energy transfer, and chiral communication.

         <title>Interfacial Oxygen Vacancy of CuOx&#8208;CeO2 Enhances H2O2 Activation and Pollutant Degradation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By employing the ion exchange reverse loading strategy, the loading of inert CeO2 support onto reactive CuOx nanoparticles generates nanocomposite with abundant surface oxygen vacancies neighboring Cu and Ce as new active sites, resulting in remarkably improved activity for H2O2 activation and pollutant degradation.







Abstract
In the Fenton process, the development of catalysts with a wide pH range and good stability has been a long&#8208;term goal for water treatment purpose. This study proposes a strategy to solve this problem by preparing supported catalysts CuOx@CeO2&#8208;IE using an ion exchange reversed loading method. The generation of a large number of interfacial oxygen vacancies with Cu&#8208;OV&#8208;Ce (OV represents an oxygen vacancy site) structures prolongs the O&#8722;O bond of H2O2, promotes the rupture of the peroxide bond of H2O2, and thereby promotes the activation of H2O2 on the surface of the catalyst. The results show that with a H2O2 concentration of 5&#8197;mM and CuOx@CeO2&#8208;IE at 50&#8197;mg/L, the removal rate of bisphenol A is 94.1&#8201;% in 60&#8197;min, in which &#8226;&#8201;OH dominates the degradation process. Moreover, the system can operate well within a relatively wide pH range (4&#8211;8). This study provides a novel strategy for the design of Fenton catalysts with a wide pH suitability and excellent stability.

         <title>A {Cr4Ln2} Complex with Exchange Coupled {Cr2} Units: Structural Description and Magnetic Study</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a novel {Cr4Ln2}, core with exchange coupled {Cr2} units (Ln = Gd and Dy) where Ln = Dy shows SMM behaviour at zero external field.







Abstract
We have prepared and structurally characterized pivalate based {CrIII4LnIII2} complexes with Ln = Dy and Gd as well as the Y analogue, with the overall formula [CrIII4LnIII2(mdea)2(piv)10(OH)4], Ln = Gd, Dy and Y. We are reporting a detailed experimental magnetic properties study, including magnetization relaxation dynamics and calorimetric data, supported with quantum chemical calculations. The synthesis of the Y derivative, allowed to precisely identify the Cr(III)&#8208;Cr(III) exchange interaction magnitude which proved moderately strong and in agreement with known magneto&#8208;structural correlations. This result agrees with the observed double bridged {Cr2&#8208;&#956;OH&#8208;&#956;OR} units within the {Cr4Ln2} complexes. The Gd(III) complex magnetic properties can be properly described with the already established exchange coupled {Cr2} units, and a unique Gd(III)&#8208;Cr(III) exchange coupling parameter which proved anti&#8208;ferromagnetic in nature. The MCE characterization of this complex based on magnetization and calorimetric data down to 2&#8197;K affords a moderate entropy change value, mainly affected by the strong Cr&#8208;Cr exchange interaction. The complex with Ln = Dy, showed SMM behaviour below 10&#8197;K under 0 DC applied field with negligible field dependence up to 3000&#8197;Oe and 10&#8197;kHz of AC field frequency. Two relaxation processes are clearly distinguished, with thermal barriers for an Orbach mechanism of ca. 20&#8197;cm&#8722;1 and 40&#8197;cm&#8722;1.

         <title>Selective Self&#8208;Assembly of Supramolecular Helices and Macrocycles Directed by Halogen Bonding</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Supramolecular helices controlled by intermolecular I&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#8722;O&#8722;N+ halogen bonds and bimolecular supramolecular planar macrocycles controlled by intermolecular &#8722;C&#8801;C&#8722;I&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;N or &#8722;C&#8801;C&#8722;I&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#8722;O&#8722;N+ halogen bonds were selectively constructed from H&#8208;bonded arylamide foldamers with an equivalent degree of polymerization.







Abstract
In this study, several hydrogen&#8208;bonded arylamide foldamers (compounds 1&#8211;5) with the same degree of polymerization were designed and synthesized. The polyfluoroiodobenzene or iodoethynyl polyfluoroiodobenzene segment was modified as a halogen donor at the end of the monomer, and pyridine or pyridine oxynitride served as the corresponding halogen acceptor segment. The crystal structure of compound 1 indicates that the supramolecular double helices were constructed by stacking a P helix and an M helix in an antiparallel manner in the direction of intermolecular I&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#8722;O&#8722;N+ halogen bonding. The zig&#8208;zag&#8208;shaped linear structures of compounds 2 and 3 were generated under the induction of intermolecular I&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;N and I&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#8722;O&#8722;N+ halogen bonds. [1+1] near&#8208;planar bimolecular supramolecular macrocycles in compounds 4 and 5 were formed by multiple groups of effective intramolecular three&#8208;center hydrogen bonding and strong I&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;N and I&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#8722;O&#8722;N+ halogen bonds. Hirshfeld surface analysis and theoretical modelling of the halogen bonding energy were performed. The noncovalent interactions on the surface of the monomers and the halogen bonding energy were investigated in detail.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review article provides a comprehensive overview of recent developments in the area of hydroxamate&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs). It primarily focuses on their synthesis, structural characteristics, and porosity. Finally, it highlights the potential for future applications, including catalysis, small molecule capture, and semiconductive materials.







Abstract
This mini&#8208;review focuses on recent developments in hydroxamate&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs), which exhibit unique structures and properties distinct from those of carboxylate&#8208;based MOFs. Hydroxamates (RCONHO&#8722;) form MOFs with novel structural motifs and functionalities. In this review, synthetic strategies, structural characteristics, and functional applications of key examples of hydroxamate&#8208;based MOFs are described, providing insights into the influence of the hydroxamate ligand on the MOF properties compared to that of the carboxylate&#8208;based analogues.

In this review, synthetic strategies, structural characteristics, and functional applications of key examples of hydroxamate-based MOFs are described, providing insights into the influence of the hydroxamate ligand on the MOF properties compared to that of the carboxylate-based analogues.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Tuning of a Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Framework by Liquid&#8208;Assisted Mechanosynthesis between Trans&#8208;Aconitic Acid and Isonicotinamide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework (HOF) system was developed using trans&#8208;aconitic acid and isonicotinamide via mechanochemical milling. The crystal structures were determined by SCXRD, microcrystal electron diffraction and synchrotron X&#8208;ray diffraction. PXRD verified the isostructurality, thermogravimetric analysis confirmed their stability and this study also showcase tunable HOF properties.







Abstract
Cocrystallization of trans&#8208;aconitic acid (TACA) and isonicotinamide (INA) using liquid assisted mechanochemical grinding results in a unique supramolecular hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework (HOF) system encapsulating various organic solvents (liquid guest) with the formation of channel inclusion compounds. Dimension and shape of the framework is dependent on the solvent used during liquid assisted grinding (LAG). Although crystal structure of the cocrystal (TACA)&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;(INA)2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;(H2O)@(INA)0.5 has been determined by Single Crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (SCXRD), crystal structures of 3 cocrystal HOFs were determined by microcrystal electron diffraction (MicroED) and synchrotron X&#8208;ray diffraction due to lack of suitable single crystal. PXRD analysis confirms isostructurality of various host&#8208;guest systems; whereas guest incorporation as well as stability of the HOFs were further confirmed using thermogravimetric analysis. This study demonstrates that the framework of HOFs can be tuned by varying solvent molecules used during LAG.

         <title>General Acetal&#8208;Protected Aldehyde Strategy for Facile Synthesis of Covalent Organic Frameworks with Splendid Crystallinity and Uniform Morphology</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We proposed a general acetal&#8208;protected aldehyde protocol for the facile synthesis of imine&#8208;linked COFs, which enables the simultaneous optimization of crystallinity and morphology. This synthetic approach demonstrates broad adaptability across various framework topologies, precursor species, and synthetic solvent systems, simplifying the typically laborious solvent screening process in COF synthesis.







Abstract
Crystallinity and morphology are critical factors that closely related to the properties and applications of covalent organic frameworks (COFs). However, the controlled synthesis of COFs with both high crystallinity and uniform morphology remains a significant challenge due to uncontrollable polymerization and complex reaction conditions. In this work, we present a general acetal&#8208;protected aldehyde protocol for the facile synthesis of imine&#8208;linked COFs, which enables the simultaneous optimization of crystallinity and morphology. Of the acetal&#8208;protected aldehydes explored, ethanediol&#8208;protected terephthalaldehyde (Tp&#8208;E) emerged as the most effective, balancing stability and reactivity to yield highly crystalline Py&#8208;COF&#8208;E with a well&#8208;defined hollow spherical morphology and a significantly enhanced BET surface area compared to its aldehyde&#8208;based counterpart Py&#8208;COF. This synthetic approach demonstrates broad adaptability across various framework topologies, precursor species, and synthetic solvent systems, simplifying the typically laborious solvent screening process in COF synthesis. Furthermore, Py&#8208;DBT&#8208;COF&#8208;E showed superior photocatalytic H2 evolution performance relative to Py&#8208;DBT&#8208;COF, despite their identical chemical compositions, emphasizing the critical role of crystallinity and morphology in determining functional performance. Overall, this study provides a versatile methodology for the controlled synthesis of COFs and offers valuable insights into the interconnected roles of morphology, crystallinity, and material performance.

         <title>Photocatalytic Seawater Splitting by Earth&#8208;Abundant Catalysts: Metal&#8208;Semiconductor Metamaterials Made of Plasmonic Magnesium Diboride and Transitional Metal Dichalcogenides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 71, December 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel photocatalysts for efficient seawater splitting made from metal&#8208;semiconductor hybrid metamaterials are studied in this work. The Earth&#8208;abundant metal MgB2 is employed as main photocatalyst and the TMDs as the co&#8208;catalyst, among which MgB2/WS2 shows the largest enhancement of seawater splitting compared to the separate elements. An efficient mechanical fabrication method is employed to produce MgB2&#8208;TMDCs hybrid photoanodes.







Abstract
Metal&#8208;semiconductor metamaterials hold great promise for photocatalytic water splitting due to their excellent light harvesting in a broad spectral range as well as efficient charge carrier generation and transfer. In the majority of such metamaterials, semiconductors are used to initiate the water splitting reaction, while their metal counterparts are employed to improve light harvesting through plasmonic effects. Here, we describe for the first time an exceptional reversed case of metal&#8208;semiconductor photocatalysts in which metals are used to initiate the water splitting reaction and semiconductors are employed to improve light harvesting through the blackbody effect and serve as co&#8208;catalysts. The studied photoanodes are made of non&#8208;noble plasmonic MgB2 combined with transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs). The plasmonic resonances of the MgB2 component contribute to field confinement, plasmon&#8211;exciton coupling, and hot&#8208;electron transfer providing an enhancement of photoactivity in the entire solar spectrum capable of water splitting. The TMDC component provides impedance matching and enhances light absorption by the metal catalyst. We demonstrate seawater splitting with MgB2&#8208;TMDCs photoanodes attaining current densities of ~3&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at solar radiation. The overall efficiency of hydrogen production in seawater splitting by sunlight with the help of the studied photoanodes is 3&#8201;% at a bias voltage of Vbias=0.3&#8197;V.

         <title>Electrochemical Synthesis of Metal Complexes Using Dissolving Anodes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 71, December 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
General principles and recent advances in the electrochemical generation of metal complexes using dissolving anodes are discussed. The use of electrochemistry enables control of the metal oxidation state, reduces waste streams, and allows the incorporation of base&#8208;sensitive functionality in the products. The electrochemical method provides a means to rapidly produce large libraries of metal complexes for development of catalytic reactions.







Abstract
The use of dissolving metal electrodes for the direct electrochemical synthesis of metal complexes has been used widely in the last decade. A major benefit of the electrochemical approach is the minimal by&#8208;products resulting from the synthesis. As such, metal complexes can be produced on&#8208;demand and used directly in catalysis without the need for purification. Furthermore, the electrochemical method enables the production of metal complexes that cannot be synthesized using other methods, including those with base&#8208;sensitive ligands. General principles of the electrochemical method and recent advances in the field are discussed.

         <dc:description>
The present cell architecture involves a thorough assessment of device physics including electric field distribution, effect of bandgap, effect of absorber thickness, generation and recombination, and band alignment. The model cell boasts a photoconversion efficiency (PCE) exceeding 36&#8201;%, and has the ability to retain an impressive built&#8208;in potential of 0.58&#8197;eV at relatively high temperature (400&#8197;K).







Abstract
Designing a high&#8208;performance solar cell structure requires the understanding of material innovation, device engineering, charge behavior, operation characteristics and efficient photoconversion of light to generate electricity. This study offers a detailed numerical evaluation of the device physics in a highly efficient methylammonium&#8208;based perovskite solar cell (PSC) of the configuration, FTO/WO3/CH&#8323;NH&#8323;SnI&#8323;/GO/Fe. Utilizing the SCAPS&#8208;1D device simulator, an impressive open&#8208;circuit voltage (Voc) of 1.3184&#8197;V, short&#8208;circuit current density (Jsc) of 35.10&#8197;mA/cm2, Fill factor (FF) of 78.38&#8201;%, and power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 36.24&#8201;% were achieved.

&lt;p&gt;The present cell architecture involves a thorough assessment of device physics including electric field distribution, effect of bandgap, effect of absorber thickness, generation and recombination, and band alignment. The model cell boasts a photoconversion efficiency (PCE) exceeding 36&#8201;%, and has the ability to retain an impressive built-in potential of 0.58&#8197;eV at relatively high temperature (400&#8197;K).

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Designing a high-performance solar cell structure requires the understanding of material innovation, device engineering, charge behavior, operation characteristics and efficient photoconversion of light to generate electricity. This study offers a detailed numerical evaluation of the device physics in a highly efficient methylammonium-based perovskite solar cell (PSC) of the configuration, FTO/WO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;/CH&#8323;NH&#8323;SnI&#8323;/GO/Fe. Utilizing the SCAPS-1D device simulator, an impressive open-circuit voltage (V&lt;sub&gt;oc&lt;/sub&gt;) of 1.3184&#8197;V, short-circuit current density (J&lt;sub&gt;sc&lt;/sub&gt;) of 35.10&#8197;mA/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, Fill factor (FF) of 78.38&#8201;%, and power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 36.24&#8201;% were achieved. The model cell exhibits a robust photon capture of 100&#8201;% quantum efficiency between 360 and 750&#8197;nm. The study also presents a temperature-dependent band alignment diagram which posted a built-in potential (V&lt;sub&gt;bi&lt;/sub&gt;) of 0.62&#8197;eV. The V&lt;sub&gt;bi&lt;/sub&gt; at 400&#8197;K was found to be 0.58&#8197;eV indicating that the model cell exhibits a decent temperature tolerance, and can retain approximately 93&#8201;% of its power at 400&#8197;K. Through Mott-Schottky capacitance analysis, deeper insights into the space-charge region are inferred, while recombination-generation investigations emphasize the significance of electronic properties in optimizing device performance.

         <title>Multilevel Dynamic System as Molecular Morning&#8208;After Timer</title>

A minimalistic bilayer dynamic library was prepared using disulfide/dithioacetal/thiol exchanges, and its final steady composition was used to obtain information about the timing, duration, and intensity of a past, apparently traceless event that transitorily altered the molecular network wiring.







Abstract
Systems chemistry aims to develop molecular systems that display emerging properties arising from their network and absent in their individual constituents. Employing reversible chemistry under thermodynamic control represents a valuable tool for generating dynamic combinatorial libraries of interconverting molecules, which may exhibit intriguing collective behaviour. A simple dynamic combinatorial library was prepared using dithioacetal/thiol/disulfide exchanges. Because of the relative reactivities of these reversible reactions, the library constitutes a two&#8208;layer dynamic system with one layer active in an acid medium (thiol/dithioacetal exchange) and one layer active in a basic medium (thiol/disulfide exchange). This property enables the system to respond to momentary changes in acidity of the medium by activating different network regions, channeling some building blocks from one layer to another through shared thiol reagents (nodes). This momentaneous change in wiring affects the final steady state composition of the library, measured the next day, even though the event that caused it vanishes without leaving any residue. Therefore, the final composition of this dynamic system provides information about this transient past perturbation in the environment such as: when it occurred, how long it was, or how intense it was.

         <title>A CH4&#8208;Driven Ion Cloud&#8208;Stretched Approach Enables ICP&#8208;qMS for Multiplex Single&#8208;Cell Analysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 71, December 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inductively coupled plasma quadrupole mass spectrometry (ICP&#8208;qMS) is now able to perform a multiplex single&#8208;cell analysis based on a CH4&#8208;driven CRC&#8208;stretched ion cloud approach. A CH4&#8208;driven collision&#8208;reaction&#8208;cell (CRC)&#8208;stretched ion cloud approach (CH4&#8208;CRC) enables inductively coupled plasma quadrupole mass spectrometry (ICP&#8208;qMS) to perform a multiplex single&#8208;cell analysis. Quantification of single&#8208;cell's multiple phenotype protein markers can thus be achieved on ICP&#8208;(CH4&#8208;CRC)&#8208;qMS, not only revealing the heterogeneity between the single cells but also realizing an unambiguous cell&#8208;classification of their subtypes.







Abstract
In the last 40&#8197;years, inductively coupled plasma quadrupole (q) mass spectrometry (ICP&#8208;qMS) has been recognized as one of the best tools for the quantification of multiple elements/isotopes and even the biomolecules they labeled in a homogeneous solution sample. However, it meets a tough challenge when acquiring multi&#8208;m/z signals from an intact single&#8208;cell dispersed in a cell suspension, since the single&#8208;cell ion cloud generated in ICP presents an intermittently transient event with a duration time of hundreds of microseconds while the dwell time plus settling time of the q is at the similar time scale when peak&#8208;hopping between different m/z. Herein, we report CH4 is able to stretch the single&#8208;cell ion cloud duration time to more than 7,000&#8197;&#956;s in collision&#8208;reaction&#8208;cell (CRC), allowing multi&#8208;m/z signals acquisition by ICP&#8208;qMS. Quantification of single&#8208;cell's multiple phenotype protein markers can thus be achieved on ICP&#8208;(CH4&#8208;CRC)&#8208;qMS, not only revealing the heterogeneity between the single cells but also enabling an unambiguous cell&#8208;classification of their subtypes. CH4&#8208;driven ion cloud&#8208;stretched approach breaks through the long&#8208;standing bottleneck limited single&#8208;cell multiplex analysis on ICP&#8208;qMS, paving a path for more important applications of ICP&#8208;qMS in the fields related to single&#8208;cell analysis.

         <title>Identification of Peptide Binding Motifs for Calcium Sulfate Hemihydrate using Phage Display</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 71, December 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The hydration of bassanite (calcium sulfate hemihydrate) into gypsum (the dihydrate) is a fundamental reaction underlying the working principle of conventional plasters. To achieve selective control over this process, peptide structures showing strong interactions with the mineral surfaces were rationally identified by means of phage display. The results highlight the potential of this biophysical technique in the design of new crystallization additives for sustainable construction solutions.







Abstract
Selective control over crystallization in complex multicomponent systems such as hydrating cements is a key issue in modern material science. In this context, rational selection&#8208;based approaches appear highly promising in the quest for new additive chemistries. Here we have used phage display to identify peptide structures showing high affinity to adsorb on the surfaces of calcium sulfate hemihydrate (also referred to as bassanite), an important hydraulic binder employed in large scales by the construction industry. The results suggest a triplet of amino acids consisting of aspartic acid, serine and leucine, to maintain strong interactions with the surfaces of hemihydrate particles. This notion is confirmed by actual hydration experiments, in which the identified peptide motif provides strictly selective effects during the transformation of bassanite into more stable gypsum. Our work thus contributes to a better understanding of hydraulic binders and their required improvement for a sustainable future.

         <title>Unveiling the Ultrafast Excitation Energy Transfer in Tetraarylpyrrolo[3,2&#8208;b]pyrrole&#8208;BODIPY Dyads</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 71, December 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two dyads comprising of tetraarylpyrrolo[3,2&#8208;b]pyrrole (TAPP) and BODIPY are synthesized. Fast energy transfer from TAPP to BODIPY unit (ETE~99.9&#8201;%) are observed in both the dyads. Ultrafast spectroscopic studies of dyad&#8197;1 show TAPP to BODIPY energy transfer in 125&#8197;fs (kET=8.0&#215;1012&#8201;s&#8722;1) which is one of the fastest energy transfer events in BODIPY based dyad reported so far.







Abstract
We have synthesized two dyads (dyad&#8197;1 and 2) comprising of tetraarylpyrrolo[3,2&#8208;b]pyrrole (TAPP) and BODIPY. In dyad&#8197;1, two BODIPYs are directly connected with TAPP moiety whereas in dyad&#8197;2, BODIPYs are connected through phenylethynyl linkers. TAPP is a blue energy donor which is easy to synthesize and functionalize as compared to other well&#8208;known blue energy donors like pyrene, perylene etc. This is the first report of using TAPP as an energy donor in BODIPY based dyad molecules. Complete quenching of TAPP fluorescence in the dyads suggests fast energy transfer from TAPP to BODIPY unit (ETE~99.9&#8201;%). Ultrafast fluorescence and transient absorption spectroscopic studies of dyad&#8197;1 showed TAPP to BODIPY energy transfer in 125&#8197;fs (kET=8.0&#215;1012&#8201;s&#8722;1) which is one of the fastest energy transfer events in BODIPY based dyad reported so far. Whereas, in dyad&#8197;2, energy transfer is almost four times slower (480&#8197;fs, kET=2.1&#215;1012&#8201;s&#8722;1). These results were rationalized by theoretical F&#246;rster formulations. This study shows that suitably matched optical properties of TAPP and BODIPY dyes along with their easy syntheses will be the key to develop highly efficient energy transfer systems in future for multiple applications.

Ultrafast spectroscopic studies of dyad&#8197;1 show TAPP to BODIPY energy transfer in 125&#8197;fs (&lt;i&gt;k&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;ET&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sup&gt;=8.0&#215;10&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) which is one of the fastest energy transfer events in BODIPY based dyad reported so far.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have synthesized two dyads (dyad&#8197;1 and 2) comprising of tetraarylpyrrolo[3,2-&lt;i&gt;b&lt;/i&gt;]pyrrole (TAPP) and BODIPY. In dyad&#8197;1, two BODIPYs are directly connected with TAPP moiety whereas in dyad&#8197;2, BODIPYs are connected through phenylethynyl linkers. TAPP is a blue energy donor which is easy to synthesize and functionalize as compared to other well-known blue energy donors like pyrene, perylene etc. This is the first report of using TAPP as an energy donor in BODIPY based dyad molecules. Complete quenching of TAPP fluorescence in the dyads suggests fast energy transfer from TAPP to BODIPY unit (ETE~99.9&#8201;%). Ultrafast fluorescence and transient absorption spectroscopic studies of dyad&#8197;1 showed TAPP to BODIPY energy transfer in 125&#8197;fs (&lt;i&gt;k&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;ET&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sup&gt;=8.0&#215;10&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) which is one of the fastest energy transfer events in BODIPY based dyad reported so far. Whereas, in dyad&#8197;2, energy transfer is almost four times slower (480&#8197;fs, &lt;i&gt;k&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;ET&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sup&gt;=2.1&#215;10&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;). These results were rationalized by theoretical F&#246;rster formulations. This study shows that suitably matched optical properties of TAPP and BODIPY dyes along with their easy syntheses will be the key to develop highly efficient energy transfer systems in future for multiple applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Size&#8208;Dependent Copper Nanoparticles Supported on Carbon Nanotubes with Balanced Cu+ and Cu0 Dual Sites for the Selective Hydrogenation of Ethylene Carbonate</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 71, December 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cu nanoparticles supported on surface modified carbon nanotubes with defects and oxygen&#8208;containing functional groups catalysts were prepared via a convenient impregnation method. The 40Cu/CNTs catalysts revealed remarkable methanol and ethylene glycol yields for the vapor&#8208;phase hydrogenation of ethylene carbonate. The synergistic effect of Cu0 and Cu+ dual sites contributed to the satisfactory catalytic performance of ethylene carbonate hydrogenation.







Abstract
Cyclic carbonate hydrogenation offers an alternative for the efficient indirect CO2 utilization. In this study, a series of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) supported xCu/CNTs catalysts with different Cu loadings were fabricated using a convenient impregnation method, and exhibited excellent catalytic activity for the hydrogenation of ethylene carbonate to methanol and ethylene glycol. The structural and physicochemical properties revealed that acid treatment of CNTs resulted in plentiful oxygen&#8208;containing functional groups, providing sufficient anchoring sites for copper species. The calcination process conducted under an inert atmosphere resulted in the formation of ternary CuO, Cu2O, and Cu composites, enhancing the metal&#8208;support interaction and facilitating the formation of balanced Cu0 and Cu+ dual sites as well as high active surface area after reduction. Contributed to the synergetic effect of balanced Cu+ and Cu0 species proved by density functional theory calculation and the electron&#8208;rich CNTs surface, the 40Cu/CNTs catalyst achieved strengthened catalytic performance with methanol yield of 83&#8201;%, ethylene glycol yield of 99&#8201;% at ethylene carbonate conversion of &gt;99&#8201;%, and 150&#8197;h of long&#8208;term running stability. Consequently, CNTs supported Cu serve as efficient non&#8208;silica based catalyst for ester hydrogenation.

         <title>Ammonothermal Synthesis of Luminescent Imidonitridophosphate Ba4P4N8(NH)2:Eu2+</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 71, December 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The imidonitridophosphate Ba4P4N8(NH)2 was synthesized from ammonothermal synthesis. The structure and presence of the imide groups could be determined in a multi&#8208;step characterization process using X&#8208;ray diffraction, infrared and solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopic methods. These investigations allowed to determine a preferred position of the hydrogen atoms among the possible imide positions. Doped samples show an efficient cyan luminescence under ultraviolet light.







Abstract
The structural variability of a compound class is an important criterion for the research into phosphor host lattices for phosphor&#8208;converted light&#8208;emitting diodes (pc&#8208;LEDs). Especially, nitridophosphates and the related class of imidonitridophosphates are promising candidates. Recently, the ammonothermal approach has opened a systematic access to this substance class with larger sample quantities. We present the successful ammonothermal synthesis of the imidonitridophosphate Ba4P4N8(NH)2:Eu2+. Its crystal structure is solved by X&#8208;ray diffraction and it crystallizes in space group Cc (no. 9) with lattice parameters a=12.5250(3), b=12.5566(4), c=7.3882(2) &#197; and &#946;=102.9793(10)&#176;. For the first time, adamantane&#8208;type (imido)nitridophosphate anions [P4N8(NH)2]8&#8722; are observed next to metal ions other than alkali metals in a compound. The presence of imide groups in the structure and the identification of preferred positions for the hydrogen atoms are performed using a combination of quantum chemical calculations, Fourier&#8208;transform infrared, and solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy. Eu2+ doped samples exhibit cyan emission (&#955;max=498&#8197;nm, fwhm=50&#8197;nm/1981&#8197;cm&#8722;1) when excited with ultraviolet light with an impressive internal quantum efficiency (IQE) of 41&#8201;%, which represents the first benchmark for imidonitridophosphates and is promising for potential industrial application of this compound class.

         <title>CO2 Dynamics in a Flexible Metal&#8208;Organic Framework with Gate&#8208;Opening Phenomenon</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 71, December 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy was used to investigate CO2 dynamics in ELM&#8208;11 MOF during the gate&#8208;opening process. At low CO2 loading, it intercalates and adsorbs at a one site, causing slight interlayer opening. At high CO2 loading, the gate fully opens, allowing two types of CO2 to motion between the much expanded interlayers.







Abstract
As a promising porous material for CO2 adsorption and storage, elastic layer&#8208;structured metal&#8208;organic framework&#8208;11 (ELM&#8208;11) has attracted significant attention owing to its distinct gate&#8208;opening phenomenon. There is a sharp increase in CO2 uptake once reaching the gate&#8208;opening threshold pressure. To better understand this gate&#8208;opening mechanism, we investigated its transition process from the perspective of CO2 dynamics and its interaction with the framework via variable&#8208;temperature 13C solid&#8208;state nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Our findings revealed that during the gate&#8208;opening process, CO2 is initially strongly adsorbed at one site when the gate only slightly opens, while two distinct types of CO2 molecules exist when the gate fully opens. 11B, 13C, and 19F magic&#8208;angle spinning NMR, in conjunction with in&#8208;situ XANES experiments, were also conducted to probe the location of adsorption sites.

         <title>N&#8208;doped Porous Carbon Derived from the Pyrolysis of a Polydopamine&#8208;coated Hypercross&#8208;linked Polymer for Enhanced CO2 Adsorption</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 71, December 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of N&#8208;doped porous carbons (PDA@HCP(x:y)&#8208;T) was prepared by coating polydopamine (PDA) on a hypercross&#8208;linked polymer (HCP) while adjusting the mass ratio and carbonisation temperature. The results showed that the CO2 adsorption capacity of PDA@HCP(1&#8201;:&#8201;1)&#8208;850 was 6.46&#8197;mmol/g and 3.05&#8197;mmol/g at 0&#8201;&#176;C, 25&#8201;&#176;C and 101&#8197;kPa, respectively.







Abstract
Porous carbon materials can simultaneously capture and convert carbon dioxide, helping to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and using carbon dioxide as a feedstock for the production of valuable chemicals or fuel. In this work, a series of N&#8208;doped porous carbons (PDA@HCP(x:y)&#8208;T) was prepared; the CO2 adsorption capacity of the prepared PDA@HCP(x:y)&#8208;T was enhanced by coating polydopamine (PDA) on a hypercross&#8208;linked polymer (HCP) and then adjusting the mass ratio of PDA to HCP and the carbonization temperature. The results showed that the prepared PDA@HCP(1&#8201;:&#8201;1)&#8208;850 exhibited a high CO2 adsorption capacity due to abundant micropores (0.6762&#8197;cm3/g), a high specific surface area (1220.8&#8197;m2/g), and moderate surface nitrogen content (2.75&#8201;%). Notably, PDA@HCP(1&#8201;:&#8201;1)&#8208;850 exhibited the highest CO2 uptake of 6.46&#8197;mmol/g at 0&#8201;&#176;C and 101&#8197;kPa. Critically, these N&#8208;doped porous carbons can also be used as catalysts for the reaction of CO2 with epichlorohydrin to form chloropropylene carbonate, with chloropropylene carbonate yielding up to 64&#8201;% and selectivity of the reaction reaching 94&#8201;%. As a result, these N&#8208;doped porous carbons could serve as potential candidates for CO2 capture and conversion due to their high reactivity, excellent CO2 uptake, and good catalytic performance.

         <title>The Changing Phases of Bromopentafluorobenzene</title>

Completely Phased? The study of the solid&#8208;state phase behaviour of a simple molecule such as C6F5Br can be something of a mystery when kinetic factors compete with thermodynamic behaviour, especially when weak non&#8208;covalent interactions dominate the crystal structures. Our experimental studies have solved three phases. Perhaps computational studies can unlock the fourth?







Abstract
As part of a much larger study on non&#8208;covalent interactions in binary adducts, we have explored the solid&#8208;state structures of bromopentafluorobenzene (C6F5Br) using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), variable&#8208;temperature powder X&#8208;ray diffraction (VT&#8208;PXRD), and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (SXD). DSC data initially indicated a single solid&#8208;state phase below the freezing point, but revealed additional weak transitions upon heating. The crystal structures of three solid&#8208;state phases have been solved. The SXD data showed that phases I and IV are centrosymmetric, whilst phase II is polar. However, the structure of phase III remains elusive due to the changing phase behaviour of C6F5Br that is determined as much as by kinetics as thermodynamics. The results underline the need for multiple analytical techniques to study non&#8208;covalent interactions and offer valuable data for refining computational models in crystal structure prediction and machine learning. A comparison with the iodinated counterpart is also made.

         <title>Preparation of Large Perphenylbiaryls: Can Intermolecular Coupling Compete with Intramolecular Cyclization of Precursors?</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 71, December 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Attempts to prepare perphenylbiaryls containing heptaphenylnaphthyl groups via Ullmann coupling or Diels&#8208;Alder reactions led predominantly to unusual intramolecular cyclization products derived from the naphthalene precursors. Ullmann coupling of 1&#8208;bromo&#8208;2,3,4,5,6,7,8&#8208;heptaphenylnaphthalene gave only 1,2,3,4,5,6&#8208;hexaphenylfluoranthene, and Diels&#8208;Alder reaction of 1&#8208;(phenylethynyl)&#8208;2,3,4,5,6,7,8&#8208;heptaphenylnaphthalene and tetracyclone gave the illustrated mixture of inter&#8208; and intramolecular cyclization products.







Abstract
The highly substituted naphthalenes 1,2,3,4,5,6,7&#8208;heptaphenylnaphthalene (13), 2,3,4,5,6,7,8&#8208;heptaphenyl&#8208;1&#8208;naphthol (12), 1&#8208;bromo&#8208;2,3,4,5,6,7,8&#8208;heptaphenylnaphthalene (4), and 1&#8208;(phenylethynyl)&#8208;2,3,4,5,6,7,8&#8208;heptaphenylnaphthalene (5) were prepared by a variety of methods, and all but 5 were crystallographically characterized. The attempted Ullmann coupling of 4 to give tetradecaphenyl&#8208;1,1&#8242;&#8208;binaphthyl (3), at both 270&#8201;&#176;C and 350&#8201;&#176;C, yielded instead 1,2,3,4,5,6&#8208;hexaphenylfluoranthene (17) via an intramolecular cyclization reaction. When the alkyne 5 was heated with tetracyclone (6) at 350&#8201;&#176;C, 1&#8208;(pentaphenylphenyl)&#8208;2,3,4,5,6,7,8&#8208;heptaphenylnaphthalene (7) was formed in 3&#8201;% yield. However, greater amounts of 5,6,7,8,9,14&#8208;hexaphenyldibenzo[a,e]pyrene (20, 11&#8201;%) and 1,2,3,4,5,6,7&#8208;heptaphenylfluoranthene (21, 11&#8201;%) were produced, the former by intramolecular cyclization and dehydrogenation of 5 and the latter by an intramolecular Diels&#8208;Alder reaction of 5 followed by extrusion of acetylene. The X&#8208;ray structure of 7 shows it to be an exceptionally crowded biaryl, and the X&#8208;ray structure of 20 shows it to be a saddle shaped polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon.

         <title>Dehydrogenative Coupling Reactions with Guanidino&#8208;Functionalized Aromatics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 71, December 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
New redox&#8208;active diguanidines are prepared, with the aim to optimize their proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer properties. Then, their oxidized, dicationic redox states are applied in dehydrogenative coupling reactions, with radical cation (electron transfer) or arenium&#8208;ion like (proton transfer) mechanisms. The molecules emerge as valuable (and in some cases superior) alternatives to traditionally applied benzoquinones such as DDQ.







Abstract
Dehydrogenative coupling (DC) reactions are of importance for the construction of new carbon&#8208;element bonds in synthetic organic chemistry. In this work, we report on the synthesis and characterization of several redox&#8208;active guanidino&#8208;functionalized aromatic molecules (GFAs) for use in DC (C&#8722;C and C&#8722;O) reactions. In a systematic approach, we first characterize the new DC reagents in all relevant redox and protonation states, and compare their performance in competitive test proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET) reactions. Then, their use in four different DC reactions with different mechanisms is evaluated.

         <title>Electrochemical Oxidation of UV Filters: A First&#8208;Principles Molecular Dynamics Study</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 71, December 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In an in&#8197;silico study, the reactions of water contaminated with UV filters in an oxidizing environment are simulated. By following the motion of Wannier centers, the movement of the orbitals during the reactions are tracked, thus distinguishing, for instance, redox reactions from acid&#8208;base reactions. The reactivity trends and pathways are highlighted.







Abstract

&lt;p&gt;In an in&#8197;silico study, the reactions of water contaminated with UV filters in an oxidizing environment are simulated. By following the motion of Wannier centers, the movement of the orbitals during the reactions are tracked, thus distinguishing, for instance, redox reactions from acid-base reactions. The reactivity trends and pathways are highlighted.

         <title>Biocompatible Flash Chemiluminescent Assay Enabled by Sterically Hindered Spiro&#8208;Strained&#8208;Oxetanyl&#8208;1,2&#8208;Dioxetane</title>

Spiro&#8208;strain, steric hindrance, and electron&#8208;withdrawing effects yield a chemically stable strained dioxetane with flash&#8208;type chemiluminescence. Probes composed of the tetramethyl&#8208;oxetanyl spiro&#8208;dioxetane show enhanced stability and sensitivity in bacterial and mammalian assays over cyclobutyl&#8208;fused probes.







Abstract
Chemiluminescence is the emission of light that occurs as a result of a chemical reaction. Depending on the rate of chemiexcitation, light emission can occur as a long&#8208;lasting, low&#8208;intensity, glow&#8208;type reaction or a rapid, highly intense flash&#8208;type reaction. Assays using a flash&#8208;type mode of action provide enhanced detection sensitivity compared to those using a glow&#8208;type mode. Recently, our group discovered that applying spiro&#8208;strain to 1,2&#8208;dioxetanes significantly increases their chemiexcitation rate, thereby transforming glow&#8208;type chemiluminescence into flash&#8208;type chemiluminescence. However, further examination of the structure&#8208;activity relationships revealed that the spiro&#8208;strain severely compromises the chemical stability of the 1,2&#8208;dioxetanes. We hypothesized that a combination of spiro&#8208;strain, steric hindrance, and an electron&#8208;withdrawing effect, will result in a chemically stable spiro&#8208;strained dioxetane with an accelerated chemiexcitation rate. Indeed, spiro&#8208;fused tetramethyl&#8208;oxetanyl exhibited a 128&#8208;fold faster chemiexcitation rate compared to adamantyl while maintaining similar chemical stability, with a half&#8208;life of over 400&#8197;hours in PBS 7.4 buffer at room temperature. Turn&#8208;on probes composed of tetramethyl&#8208;oxetanyl spiro&#8208;dioxetane exhibited significantly improved chemical stability in bacterial and mammalian cell media compared to previously developed dioxetane probes fused to a cyclobutyl unit. The superior chemical stability enables a tetramethyl&#8208;oxetanyl dioxetane probe to detect &#946;&#8208;Galactosidase (&#946;&#8208;gal) activity with enhanced sensitivity in Escherichia coli (E. coli) bacterial assays and leucine aminopeptidase activity in tumoral cell lines. Overall, the development of the tetramethyl&#8208;oxetanyl dioxetane luminophore enables us to enhance the detection sensitivity of chemiluminescent probes while maintaining high chemical stability. The results obtained in this study should assist in designing improved chemiluminescent probes and underscore the significance of strain&#8208;release techniques in enhancing the detection sensitivity of chemiluminescence assays.

         <title>Nanoenabled Self&#8208;Assembled Metal&#8208;Organic Algaecides Generated Photosynthetic Inhibition and Oxidative Stress for Sustainable Food Security</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 71, December 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nanoalgaecide was prepared by the self&#8208;assembled natural polyphenols and two functional metal ions for the application of effective algal inhibition in plant factory to promote food sustainability. This innovative approach achieves a synergistic combination of shading effects and cell&#8208;targeted delivery of copper ions derived from the phenolic&#8208;mediated cell interfacial interaction.







Abstract
Achieving food sustainability is one of the biggest challenges in the new millennium. Plant factory cultivation systems provide an alternative for food sustainability, while they often suffer from algal blooms. The overuse of conventional algaecides has caused significant environmental pollution and concerns about food security. Here, we design a nanoenabled metal&#8208;organic algaecide that is self&#8208;assembled from natural polyphenols and two functional metal ions for providing shading effects and delivering active ingredients synergistically to suppress algal blooms. Black wattle tannin (BWT) and Fe3+ ions are utilized to develop self&#8208;assembled FeBWT nanoalgaecides with significant shading effects for decreasing light transmission (up to 97&#8201;%) and effectively inhibiting algal photosynthesis. Further, the FeBWT is functionalized with Cu2+ ions (bimetallic Cu/FeBWT) to target the algal cells and release Cu2+ ions via phenolic&#8208;mediated cell surface interactions, thus enhancing the inhibition efficiency. Importantly, the biosafety of Cu/FeBWT is demonstrated through toxicity tests on zebrafish and NIH3T3 cells. In our real&#8208;world field test, the Cu/FeBWT demonstrates high algal inhibition performance (&gt;95&#8201;%, over 30&#8197;days), and enhances the accumulation of food nutrients in model plant lettuces. Collectively, the supramolecular metal&#8208;organic nanoalgaecide provides a promise for nanoagrochemical application and promotes food sustainability and security.

We synthesized Nb&#8208;doped W18O49 (Nbx&#8208;W18O49) electrocatalysts via a &#8220;one pot&#8221; solvothermal method. In 0.5&#8197;M H2SO4, Nb0.6&#8208;W18O49 achieved a low overpotential of 102&#8197;mV at &#8722;10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and a Tafel slope of 65.1&#8197;mV&#8201;dec&#8722;1. It also showed excellent stability and durability for 20&#8197;h.







Abstract
Hydrogen, known for its high energy density and environmental benefits, serves as a prime substitute for fossil fuels. Nonetheless, the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), essential in electrolysis, encounters challenges with slow kinetics and significant overpotential, which elevate costs and reduce efficiency. Thus, developing efficient electrocatalysts to reduce HER overpotential is vital to enhance hydrogen production efficiency and minimize energy consumption. Adjusting the electronic structure of transition metal oxides via elemental doping is a potent strategy to improve the effectiveness of electrocatalysts for hydrogen evolution. In this work, we synthesized a set of niobium&#8208;doped tungsten oxides (Nbx&#8208;W18O49) under anoxic conditions using a straightforward &#8220;one&#8208;pot&#8221; solvothermal approach. After doping Nb, the oxygen vacancy content inside W18O49 was increased, which induced a synergistic effect with the active sites of tungsten. In acidic environments, the hydrogen evolution activity of the Nb0.6&#8208;W18O49 electrocatalyst is second only by 20&#8197;wt&#8201;% Pt/C. It attains a current density of &#8722;10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at an overpotential of 102&#8197;mV. By comparison with W18O49, Nb0.4&#8208;W18O49 and Nb0.5&#8208;W18O49, Nb0.6&#8208;W18O49 demonstrates a reduced charge transfer resistance, which significantly enhances its conductivity and the speed of electron movement across interfaces. Coupled with this feature are notably faster HER kinetics. Additionally, it exhibits excellent stability, meaning it maintains its performance and structural integrity over prolonged periods and under various operational conditions. This article provides a new perspective for discovering inexpensive and efficient hydrogen evolution electrocatalyst materials.

New phi29 DNA polymerase variants for RCA&#8208;based DNA hydrogel production are developed, featuring modified binding properties and the ability to incorporate non&#8208;natural nucleotides with potential for generating advanced materials. Their synthesis performance and the ability to incorporate various non&#8208;natural nucleotides modified at the nucleobase or sugar moiety for the production of DNA hydrogels are evaluated and comprehensively characterized by qPCR, micromechanical indentation, and HPLC







Abstract
DNA hydrogels, which hold potential for use in medicine, biosensors, and tissue engineering, can be produced through enzymatic rolling circle amplification (RCA) using phi29 DNA polymerase (DNAP). This paper introduces new DNAP variants designed for RCA&#8208;based DNA hydrogel production, featuring enzymes with modified DNA binding, enhanced thermostability, reduced exonuclease activity, and protein tags for fluorescence detection or specific immobilization. We evaluated these enzymes by quantifying DNA output via quantitative PCR (qPCR) and assessing hydrogel mechanical properties through micromechanical indentation. The results showed that most variants generated similar DNA amounts and hydrogels with comparable mechanical properties. Additionally, all variants successfully incorporated non&#8208;natural nucleotides, such as base&#8208;modified dGTP derivatives and 2&#8242;fluoro&#8208;dGTP, during RCA. This study's robust analytical approach offers a strong foundation for selecting new enzymes and producing DNA hydrogels with tailored material properties.

         <title>Temperature&#8208;Dependent Supramolecular Isomeric Co&#8208;CPs for Luminescence Recognition and Catalytic Oxidation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 71, December 18, 2024. </description>

Two supramolecular isomers displayed distinct luminescence of recognition biomarker 2,6&#8208;pyridinedicarboxylic acid (DPA) and homovanillic acid (HVA) and catalysis oxidation sulfides to sulfoxides.







Abstract
Two Co&#8208;based supramolecular isomers were synthesized from a fluorinated carboxylic acid ligand under hydrothermal conditions at varying temperatures. Both exhibited similar one&#8208;dimensional chain structures while different bending connections of the aromatic rings led to different supramolecular structures, namely CoCP&#8208;1 and CoCP&#8208;2, respectively. The structural differences of two isomers resulted in discrepant performance with regards to luminescence sensing and catalysis. CoCP&#8208;1 demonstrated more significant luminescence quenching activity toward biomarkers 2,6&#8208;pyridinedicarboxylic acid (DPA) and homovanillic acid (HVA), which could be distinguished in the presence of Eu3+. The limit of detection (LOD) was found to be as low as 3.4 and 1.3&#8197;&#956;M, respectively. The recovery rate of for HVA and DPA was within the range of 98.5&#8211;110.3&#8201;% and 84.6&#8211;99.3&#8201;% in simulated urine and serum, respectively, indicating potential reliability in monitoring these two analytes in real samples. Notably, CoCP&#8208;2 exhibited catalytic activity for the oxidation of thioethers to sulfoxides. Our finding here suggests that the coordination conformation of the ligands within supramolecular isomers plays a pivotal role in determining the structure and luminescence sensing/catalysis performance.

         <title>Preferential Formation of Three&#8208;layered Host&#8211;Guest Complexes of a Planar Dinuclear Metallohost with Alkali Metal Ions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 71, December 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three&#8208;layered 3&#8201;:&#8201;2 (host/guest) complexes were preferentially formed by the complexation of a dinuclear nickel(II) metallohost with larger alkali metal ions (K+, Rb+, Cs+), whereas 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 and 2&#8201;:&#8201;1 complexes were formed with Na+. The three&#8208;layered complexes have a unique structural feature with three chemically different environments due to the oppositely curved two [Ni(saloph)] moieties of the metallohost.







Abstract
We synthesized a planar macrocyclic dinuclear nickel(II) metallohost from the corresponding macrocyclic imine ligand containing two N2O2 chelate coordination sites and an O6 cation binding site like 18&#8208;crown&#8208;6 as well as peripheral hexyl groups. Due to the lipophilic nature of the hexyl groups, the metallohost was soluble in less polar media where its interaction with alkali metal ions was enhanced. The binding studies by NMR spectroscopy clearly showed its strong tendency to form multi&#8208;layered structures. The metallohost formed 2&#8201;:&#8201;1 and 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 (host/guest) complexes with Na+ with the two&#8208;step binding constants of logK1=6.6 and logK2=3.0. In contrast, its complexation with larger alkali metal ions (K+, Rb+, Cs+) preferentially gave 3&#8201;:&#8201;2 (host/guest) complexes when 2/3 equiv. of the guest was present. The three&#8208;layered structures of these 3&#8201;:&#8201;2 complexes were well characterized by mass spectrometry and 2D COSY/ROESY experiments as well as DFT calculations, elucidating their unique structural feature with three chemically different environments due to the oppositely curved two [Ni(saloph)] moieties of the metallohost. Therefore, the three&#8208;layered structures were preferentially formed when larger alkali metal ions (K+, Rb+, Cs+) were complexed with the metallohost.

         <title>Organic&#8208;Inorganic Hybrid Silica Film with a TGBA* Structure</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 71, December 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Structurally colored organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid silica (OIHS) films with a TGBA* structure are prepared using a thermochromic liquid crystal mixture. The structural color is sensitive to the polymerization temperature and the chiral additive concentration. A colorful OIHS pattern is prepared by the inject printing, which can be applied for decoration and anti&#8208;counterfeiting.







Abstract
Twisted grain boundary (TGB) phases exhibit highly frustrated and complex liquid crystal structures, and have attracted enormous interest because of their unique internal structure, textures and properties. However, among the few real concerns related to these interesting structures, applying them to prepare polymer&#8208;stabilized colored liquid crystal films has been challenging. Herein, the organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid silica (OIHS) films with a TGBA* structure were prepared using two organosilanes and one chiral additive under an acidic condition. The structural color of the films can be adjusted by varying the polycondensation temperature and the concentration of the chiral additive. A structurally colored pattern was prepared by the inject printing, which was suitably applied for decoration and anti&#8208;counterfeiting.

         <title>Enhancing Phototoxicity in BODIPY&#8208;Perylene Charge Transfer Dyads by Combined Iodination and Mesylation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 71, December 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a family of BODIPY&#8208;perylene charge transfer compounds with and without iodination and/or a mesityl group. The BODIPY derivatives reported show high phototoxicity in both 2D cell cultures and multicellular tumour spheroids, where MB2PI (iodinated BODIPY&#8208;perylene with a mesityl group) was the most phototoxic derivative, indicating that combining strategies to enhance phototoxicity can yield positive results.







Abstract
The uptake and phototoxicity of a family of BODIPY&#8208;perylene charge transfer dyads are compared in live cancer and non&#8208;cancer cell lines to evaluate their performance in imaging and photodynamic therapy (PDT). The impact of iodination and mesylation of the meso position of the compounds on their optical properties, cell uptake and toxicity are compared. Notably, across all derivatives the probes were minimally dark toxic up to 50&#8197;&#956;M, (the maximum concentration tested), but exhibited outstanding phototoxicity with nanomolar IC50 values and impressive phototoxic indices (PI, ratio of dark IC50 to light IC50), with best performance for the mesylated iodinated derivative MB2PI, which had a PI of &gt;218 and &gt;8.9 in MCF&#8208;7 cells and tumour spheroids respectively. This is significantly higher than non&#8208;iodinated analogue MB2P in MCF&#8208;7 cells with an observed PI of &gt;109 and slightly higher than MB2PI in spheroids with a PI of &gt;8. This compound also showed interesting emission spectral variation with localisation that responded to stimulation of inflammation. Additional studies confirmed efficient singlet oxygen generation by the BODIPYs, suggesting a Type II mechanism of phototoxicity. Overall, the data indicates that combining charge transfer and iodination is an effective strategy for enhancing phototherapeutic capacity of BODIPY PS.

     alt="Enhancing Phototoxicity in BODIPY-Perylene Charge Transfer Dyads by Combined Iodination and Mesylation"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We report a family of BODIPY-perylene charge transfer compounds with and without iodination and/or a mesityl group. The BODIPY derivatives reported show high phototoxicity in both 2D cell cultures and multicellular tumour spheroids, where MB2PI (iodinated BODIPY-perylene with a mesityl group) was the most phototoxic derivative, indicating that combining strategies to enhance phototoxicity can yield positive results.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The uptake and phototoxicity of a family of BODIPY-perylene charge transfer dyads are compared in live cancer and non-cancer cell lines to evaluate their performance in imaging and photodynamic therapy (PDT). The impact of iodination and mesylation of the meso position of the compounds on their optical properties, cell uptake and toxicity are compared. Notably, across all derivatives the probes were minimally dark toxic up to 50&#8197;&#956;M, (the maximum concentration tested), but exhibited outstanding phototoxicity with nanomolar IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; values and impressive phototoxic indices (PI, ratio of dark IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; to light IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;), with best performance for the mesylated iodinated derivative MB2PI, which had a PI of &amp;gt;218 and &amp;gt;8.9 in MCF-7 cells and tumour spheroids respectively. This is significantly higher than non-iodinated analogue MB2P in MCF-7 cells with an observed PI of &amp;gt;109 and slightly higher than MB2PI in spheroids with a PI of &amp;gt;8. This compound also showed interesting emission spectral variation with localisation that responded to stimulation of inflammation. Additional studies confirmed efficient singlet oxygen generation by the BODIPYs, suggesting a Type II mechanism of phototoxicity. Overall, the data indicates that combining charge transfer and iodination is an effective strategy for enhancing phototherapeutic capacity of BODIPY PS.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

The ternary OSCs showed PCE of 18.05&#8201;%, is attributed to utilization of energy transfer from NFA&#8208;5 to NFA&#8208;4 in the ternary active layer, suppressed charge recombinations and low energy loss.







Abstract
Here in, we have designed two new unfused non&#8208;fullerene small molecules using asymmetric benzo[1,2&#8208;b:3.4&#8208;b&#8242;, 6,5&#8208;b&#8221;]trithiophene (BTT) as the central donor core and different terminal units i.&#8201;e., 2&#8208;(3&#8208;oxo&#8208;2,3&#8208;dihydro&#8208;1H&#8208;inden&#8208;1&#8208;ylidene)malononitrile (NFA&#8208;4) and 1,3&#8208;diethyl&#8208;2&#8208;thioxodi hydropyrimidine&#8208;4,6 (1H,5H)&#8208;dione (NFA&#8208;5) and examined their optical and electrochemical properties. Using a wide band&#8208;gap copolymer D18, organic solar cells (OSCs) based on bulk heterojunction of D18:NFA&#8208;4 and D18:NFA&#8208;5 showed overall power conversion efficiency (PCE) of about 17.07&#8201;% and 11.27&#8201;%, respectively. The increased PCE for the NFA&#8208;4&#8208;based OSC, compared to NFA&#8208;5 counterpart, is due higher value of short circuit current (JSC), open circuit voltage (VOC), and fill factor (FF). Following the addition of small amount of NFA&#8208;5 to the binary bulk heterojunction D18:NFA&#8208;4, the ternary organic solar cells attained a PCE of 18.05&#8201;%, surpassing that of the binary counterparts due to the higher values of which is higher than that for the binary counterparts and attributed to the increased values of JSC, FF, and VOC. The higher value of JSC is linked to the efficient use to excitons transferred from NFA&#8208;5 to NFA&#8208;4 with a greated dipole moment than NFA&#8208;5 and subsequently dissociated into a free charge carrier efficiently.

         <title>A New Mechanism for Formation of Glycine from Glyoxylic Acid: the Aza&#8208;Cannizzaro Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 71, December 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Glyoxylate imine is found to undergo Cannizzaro&#8208;like disproportionation under mild conditions to form glycine. The mechanism by which an iminium&#8208;hemiaminal pair disproportionate into an amide and amine has not been previously reported.







Abstract
Glyoxylic acid and glycine are widely considered to have been important prebiotic building blocks. Several mechanistic routes have been previously examined for conversion of glyoxylic acid to glycine. Here we provide evidence for a new mechanistic path. Glycine is spontaneously formed from glyoxylic acid in ammonium&#8208;rich aqueous solutions at neutral pH; oxamic acid is generated as well. Hydride transfer from the glyoxylate&#8208;derived hemiaminal to the corresponding iminium ion appears to underlie this transformation. This proposed mechanism parallels the well&#8208;known Cannizzaro reaction mechanism, which leads us to suggest the designation &#8220;aza&#8208;Cannizzaro reaction.&#8221; This discovery offers a new perspective on prebiotic nitrogen incorporation because glycine can be a source of nitrogen for more complex molecules, including other &#945;&#8208;amino acids.

         <title>Rational Assembly of Three&#8208;component Coordination Polymers as Heterogeneous Catalysts for CO2 Cycloaddition and Cyanosilylation Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 71, December 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Four new coordination polymers were constructed. The catalytic performance study showed that the CP 1 exhibited good catalytic efficiency and excellent substrate tolerance in the cycloaddition reaction of CO2 and cyanosilylation of aldehydes under mild conditions. Therefore, the CP 1 was considered efficient and stable heterogeneous catalysts for above the two reactions.







Abstract
Four new coordination polymers based on 5&#8208;(((1H&#8208;imidazol&#8208;2&#8208;yl)methyl)amino) isophthalic acid (H3L) and auxiliary ligands (1,10&#8208;phenanthroline, 2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine, and 4,4&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine), namely, {[Zn(HL)(phen)(H2O)]&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2H2O}n (CP 1), {[Ni(HL)(phen)(H2O)]}n (CP 2), {[Ni(HL)(2,2&#8242;&#8208;bpy)(H2O)]&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2H2O}n (CP 3) and {[Cd(HL)(4,4&#8242;&#8208;bpy)0.5(H2O)]&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2H2O}n (CP 4) were rationally assembled. Furthermore, these four CPs were screened as heterogeneous catalysts for CO2 cycloaddition and cyanosilylation reactions under mild conditions. The catalytic experiments showed that CP 1 had the better catalytic performance, excellent substrate tolerance and recyclability for the above two reactions. It is speculated that the excellent activity of CP 1 may be due to the open Lewis base site and the Lewis acidic characteristics of the zinc (II) center. After five cycles, the catalytic activities of CP 1 did not significantly decrease, and the structures remained unchanged. Therefore, the CP 1 was considered efficient and stable heterogeneous catalysts for above the two reactions.

         <title>Supramolecular Spin Chains via Radical&#8208;Radical Contacts Stabilizing Ferromagnetic Interactions Between Heisenberg or Ising&#8208;Like Spins</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 71, December 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Supramolecular one&#8208;dimensional arrays of radical&#8208;metal coordination complexes (Ni &amp; Co) exhibit magnetic properties strongly influenced by the anisotropy of the spin carrier. Close contacts between regions of &#945; and &#946; spin density on the pendant paramagnetic ligands suggest a mechanism for the intra&#8208;chain ferromagnetic coupling via the McConnell I model.

A new paramagnetic ligand, 4&#8208;(2&#8242;&#8208;4&#8208;(2&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;furyl)&#8208;pyrimidyl)&#8208;1,2,3,5&#8208;dithiadiazolyl (furylpymDTDA) and three transition metal coordination complexes, M(hfac)2(furylpymDTDA) M=Mn, Co, Ni; hfac=1,1,1,5,5,5&#8208;hexafluoroacetylacetonato&#8722;), are reported. The solid&#8208;state structures are influenced by the geometry of the coordination sphere of the M(II) centers: trigonal (Mn) vs. octahedral (Co and Ni). While the hs&#8208;Mn(II) complex exhibits pairwise multi&#8208;centre&#8197;2&#8208;electron bonds (i.&#8201;e., pancake bonds) between the planar &#960; radical DTDA moieties, the hs&#8208;Co(II) and Ni(II) complexes crystallize with close contacts between coordinated furylpymDTDA radical ligands that define linear 1D arrays of molecular units. The magnetic data for the hs&#8208;Co(II) and Ni(II) complexes indicate ferromagnetic (FM) interactions between molecular units, apparently mediated by radical&#8208;radical contacts along the supramolecular chains. Computational analysis suggests proximity between regions of large &#945;&#8208; and &#946;&#8208;spin density on neighbouring molecular sites enabling FM exchange, in accordance with the McConnell I mechanism. The magnetic data for the Ni(II) complex are consistent with a Heisenberg spin chain, whereas the hs&#8208;Co(II) complex exhibits Ising&#8208;like spin chain behaviour and a magnetic phase transition to an FM ordered state at 4.6&#8197;K.

&lt;p&gt;Supramolecular one-dimensional arrays of radical-metal coordination complexes (Ni &amp;amp; Co) exhibit magnetic properties strongly influenced by the anisotropy of the spin carrier. Close contacts between regions of &#945; and &lt;i&gt;&#946;&lt;/i&gt; spin density on the pendant paramagnetic ligands suggest a mechanism for the intra-chain ferromagnetic coupling via the McConnell I model.

         <title>Perylene Bisimide&#8208;Functionalized Triphenylmethyl Radicals Showing High Stability and Reversible Electrochemical Redox Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 71, December 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel series of radicals (1PBI&#8208;TTM&#8901;, 2PBI&#8208;TTM&#8901;, and 3PBI&#8208;TTM&#8901;) were synthesized and investigated with electrochemical measurements. The partially conjugated connection between the PBI and TTM&#8901; not only keeps inherent characteristics of building blocks but also facilitates electronic communication that causes distinct and reversible multi&#8208;step redox processes and contributes to obtain extremely high stability under ambient conditions.







Abstract
This study presents a series of triphenylmethyl monoradicals incorporating varying numbers of peripheral perylene bisimide (PBI) substituents (1PBI&#8208;TTM&#8901;, 2PBI&#8208;TTM&#8901; and 3PBI&#8208;TTM&#8901;). The incorporation of electron&#8208;withdrawing PBI substituents significantly enhances the stability of these carbon radicals, enabling them to display exceptional electrochemical redox reversibility. Notably, the electronic interplay between the PBI substituents and the central triphenylmethyl core facilitates unique and reversible multi&#8208;step redox reactions. Among the reported radicals, the tris&#8208;PBI&#8208;functionalized radical (3PBI&#8208;TTM&#8901;) demonstrates the remarkable ability to accommodate up to seven electrons under negative potentials, forming high valence anions. This research promotes the development of highly stable carbon radicals with superior electrochemical oxidation&#8208;reduction processes, presenting promising avenues for the advancement of electric energy storage technologies.

         <dc:description>
Hydride elimination from arylpyridyl&#8208;boranes results in formation of cationic highly Lewis acidic species. Nature of counterion appears to be crucial for its reactivity but also to its photophysical behavior. By taking advantage of accessibility diverse aryl pyridines and also by hydroboration reactivity of product, we prepared highly emissive compounds exhibiting green&#8208;yellow fluorescence with reaching quantum yields up to 93&#8201;% have been reported.







Abstract
Herein, we present the preparation of a series of electronically and/or sterically distinct borenium&#8208;type species based on a simple 2&#8208;arylpyridine scaffold. Corresponding arylpyridine was firstly subjected to electrophilic borylation (BBr3/i&#8208;Pr2NEt) and formed BBr2 chelate was reduced with LiAlH4 to yield arylpyridine boron dihydride. Elimination of one hydride led to Lewis acidic borenium&#8208;like products. Four methods of hydride elimination were evaluated and influence of counterions on reactivity, Lewis acidic and luminescent properties was assessed both experimentally and computationally. Arylpyridine chelates featuring weakly coordinating counterions exhibit fluorescent properties upon UV irradiation. Several general trends were inferred to modulate emission wavelength and fluorescence quantum yield. Based on our observations, we have devised and prepared borenium&#8208;type fluorophores with yellow&#8208;green fluorescence and quantum yields up to 93&#8201;%.

         <title>Mechanistic Insights into the Effect of Sodium Iodide on Copper&#8208;Mediated Iododeboronation</title>

         <dc:description>
The investigation examined differences in the mechanism and side reactions of Chan&#8211;Evans&#8211;Lam (CEL) iodination under conditions relevant to radiosynthesis and typical organic synthesis. The concentrations and ratio of iodide and copper were crucial for successfully performing the reaction and understanding the mechanism. The unique conditions relevant to radiosynthesis enable efficient CEL iodination.







Abstract
The copper&#8208;catalyzed Chan&#8211;Evans&#8211;Lam (CEL) coupling reaction advances carbon&#8211;heteroatom cross&#8208;coupling and has facilitated the development of radiohalogenation methodologies in radiochemistry. This study investigated the mechanisms and side reactions of CEL iodination under conditions relevant to radiosynthesis and typical organic synthesis, focusing on the effects of sodium iodide. The concentrations of copper and iodide, as well as the copper&#8208;to&#8208;iodide ratio, were identified as significant factors for successful copper&#8208;mediated CEL iodination, influencing the reaction mechanisms and side reactions. Excess iodide relative to the copper salt led to the formation of poorly soluble iodinated copper(I) complexes that competed with that of the desired aryl iodide. Additionally, the predominant copper complex involved in the catalytic cycle differed between the early and late stages of the reaction, depending on the copper&#8208;to&#8208;iodide ratio. The results of this study indicate that the specialized radiosynthesis conditions meet the requirements for efficient CEL iodination. In particular, an extremely low concentration of iodide is optimal for CEL iodination. These in&#8208;depth mechanistic insights not only provide a detailed comparison of CEL iodination across radiochemistry and synthetic organic chemistry but can also inspire the development of novel (radio)iodination methods.

         <title>Fluorination or Not in Small Molecule Solar Cells: Achieving a Higher Efficiency with Halogen&#8208;Free End Group</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 71, December 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two readily accessible and scalable end groups for small molecule donors are developed. The resulting fluorine&#8208;free SBz and fluorine&#8208;containing SBz&#8722;F were blended with Y6 for small molecule organic solar cells (SM&#8208;OSCs). Surprisingly, the fluorine&#8208;containing SBz&#8722;F:Y6 OSCs exhibit a lower efficiency than that of the SBz:Y6 OSCs (9.61&#8201;% vs 11.05&#8201;%).







Abstract
Fluorination is an efficient strategy for improving organic solar cells (OSCs) efficiency, particularly by fluorinating the end group of emerging nonfullerene acceptors. Here, the fluorination effect was investigated by using small molecule donors with fluorine&#8208;free (SBz) and fluorinated (SBz&#8208;F) end groups, paired with the emerging nonfullerene acceptor Y6. Interestingly and unexpectedly, fluorination of the end group negatively affects OSCs efficiency, with fluorine&#8208;free SBz:Y6 OSCs achieving a higher power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 11.05&#8201;% compared to the fluorine&#8208;containing SBz&#8208;F:Y6 blends (PCE=9.61&#8201;%). Analysis of space&#8208;charge limited currents reveals lower and unbalanced hole/electron mobility in SBz&#8208;F:Y6 compared to the SBz:Y6 blends. These findings are further supported by charge recombination dynamics and donor&#8208;acceptor miscibility analyses.

Surprisingly, the fluorine-containing &lt;b&gt;SBz&#8722;F:Y6&lt;/b&gt; OSCs exhibit a lower efficiency than that of the &lt;b&gt;SBz:Y6&lt;/b&gt; OSCs (9.61&#8201;% vs 11.05&#8201;%).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fluorination is an efficient strategy for improving organic solar cells (OSCs) efficiency, particularly by fluorinating the end group of emerging nonfullerene acceptors. Here, the fluorination effect was investigated by using small molecule donors with fluorine-free (&lt;b&gt;SBz&lt;/b&gt;) and fluorinated (&lt;b&gt;SBz-F&lt;/b&gt;) end groups, paired with the emerging nonfullerene acceptor Y6. Interestingly and unexpectedly, fluorination of the end group negatively affects OSCs efficiency, with fluorine-free &lt;b&gt;SBz:Y6&lt;/b&gt; OSCs achieving a higher power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 11.05&#8201;% compared to the fluorine-containing &lt;b&gt;SBz-F:Y6&lt;/b&gt; blends (PCE=9.61&#8201;%). Analysis of space-charge limited currents reveals lower and unbalanced hole/electron mobility in &lt;b&gt;SBz-F:Y6&lt;/b&gt; compared to the &lt;b&gt;SBz:Y6&lt;/b&gt; blends. These findings are further supported by charge recombination dynamics and donor-acceptor miscibility analyses.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Streamlining Thionyl Tetrafluoride (SOF4) and Pentafluoro&#8208;Oxosulfate [OSF5]&#8722; Anions Syntheses</title>

SuF&#8208;ficiently. The preparation of 100&#8197;mmol of thionyl tetrafluoride (SOF4) by the direct S&#8722;F bond formation from fluorine (F2) and thionyl fluoride (SOF2) was achieved in a quantitative and convenient manner. The solid&#8208;state structure was elucidated, and the reagent fully characterized. This efficient SuFEx reagent was transformed using a fluoride salt in pentafluorooxosulfate (OSF5) anion that can behave as an SOF4 storage reagent. Tuning the solvent system, the stable OSF5 anion appears as reactive as SOF4 for the formation of sulfurimidoyl fluorides.







Abstract
A one pot room temperature synthesis of thionyl tetrafluoride (SOF4) from elemental fluorine (F2) and thionyl fluoride (SOF2) is reported. The selective decagram scale process (100&#8197;mmol) allows a quantitative preparation of SOF4 with high purity. The solid&#8208;state structure has also been elucidated and compared with the reported gas phase one. The use of this reagent for the formation of the emerging pentafluorooxosulfate [cat][OSF5] anions led to the preparation of multiple ion&#8208;pairs (cat=Ag, NEt3Me, PPN, PPh4) in different organic solvents. The SuFEx reservoir ability of this anion was studied and by tuning the solvent system, the reactivity of pure thionyl tetrafluoride was observed using Ag[OSF5] in THF and acetone.

         <title>Total Synthesis of Tosyl&#8208;Samroiyotmycin A and Its Biological Profiling</title>

3.4&#8201;times more active than the natural product: The tosyl group plays an important role in the synthesis of the enantiopure tosyl&#8208;samroiyotmycin A and its antimalarial activity. The synthetic strategy also gains access to a library of analogues. Antimalarial activity tests reveal promising results and provide insight into structure activity relationships.







Abstract
A total synthesis of the enantiopure syn,syn&#8208;tosyl&#8208;samroiyotmycin A, a C2&#8208;symmetric 20&#8208;membered antimalarial macrodiolide with syn,syn&#8208;configuration of the 8,24&#8208;dihydroxy&#8208;9,25&#8208;dimethyl units and it's enantiopure anti,anti&#8208;derivative is described. The synthesis was accomplished utilizing a linear approach in 7 steps and 3&#8201;% overall yield via a sequence of diastereoselective methylation of SuperQuat oxazolidinone auxiliary, cross metathesis and Yamaguchi macrolactonization of fully functionalized seco&#8208;acids. By a similar approach we gained access to several samroiyotmycin analogues and precursors. Antimalarial activity was tested on multi&#8208;resistant (K1) and sensitive (Nf54) P.&#8197;falciparum strains providing insight into structure activity relationships. Both tosyl&#8208;oxazol unit as well as the syn&#8208;configuration of the two contiguous stereogenic centers turned out to be beneficial for antiplasmodial activity. For instance, syn,syn&#8208;tosyl&#8208;samroiyotmycin A showed 3.4 times higher activities than the &#8220;tosyl&#8208;free&#8221; natural product.

         <title>Targeted Photoactivatable Green&#8208;Emitting BODIPY Based on Directed Photooxidation&#8208;Induced Activation and its Application to Live Dynamic Super&#8208;Resolution Microscopy</title>

PFB is an efficient, green&#8208;emitting, photoactivatable probe based on BODIPY. Upon irradiation with visible light (488&#8197;nm), directed photooxidation oxidizes the furanyl group and eliminates the quenching TICT mechanism, resulting in an impressive fluorescence enhancement at 510&#8197;nm (93&#8208;fold increase). PFB has been targeted to various cellular organelles and successfully used in photoactivation and live dynamic super&#8208;resolution microscopy.







Abstract
Photoactivatable fluorescent probes are valuable tools in bioimaging for tracking cells down to single molecules and for single molecule localization microscopy. For the latter application, green emitting dyes are in demand. We herein developed an efficient green&#8208;emitting photoactivatable furanyl&#8208;BODIPY (PFB) and we established a new mechanism of photoactivation called Directed Photooxidation Induced Activation (DPIA) where the furan is photo&#8208;oxidized in a directed manner by the singlet oxygen produced by the probe. The efficient photoconverter (93&#8208;fold fluorescence enhancement at 510&#8197;nm, 49&#8201;% yield conversion) is functionalizable and allowed targeting of several subcellular structures and organelles, which were photoactivated in live cells. Finally, we demonstrated the potential of PFB in super&#8208;resolution imaging by performing PhotoActivated Localization Microscopy (PALM) in live cells.

         <title>Orthogonal Phase Transfer of Oppositely Charged FeII4L6 Cages</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 71, December 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a rare example of phase transfer of an anionic coordination cage, and investigate the phase transfer behaviour of a mixture of two FeII4L6 cages with the same size and geometry, but with opposite charges. These results represent unprecedented control over the movement of coordination cages between different physical compartments and are anticipated to inform the development of next&#8208;generation supramolecular systems.







Abstract
Coordination cages and their encapsulated cargo can be manoeuvred between immiscible liquid layers in a process referred to as phase transfer. Among the stimuli reported to drive phase transfer, counterion exchange is the most widespread. This method exploits the principle that counterions contribute strongly to the solubility preferences of coordination cages, and involves exchanging hydrophilic and hydrophobic counterions. Nevertheless, phase transfer of anionic cages remains relatively unexplored, as does selective phase transfer of individual cages from mixtures. Here we compare the phase transfer behaviour of two FeII4L6 cages with the same size and geometry, but with opposite charges. As such, this study presents a rare example wherein an anionic cage undergoes phase transfer upon countercation exchange. We then combine these two cages, and demonstrate that their quantitative separation can be achieved by inducing selective phase transfer of either cage. These results represent unprecedented control over the movement of coordination cages between different physical compartments and are anticipated to inform the development of next&#8208;generation supramolecular systems.

         <title>Electrochemical Enantioselective Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Cross&#8208;Coupling of Aldehydes with Aryl Iodides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 71, December 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Ni&#8208;electrocatalytic cross&#8208;coupling procedure between aldehydes and aryl halides is described leading to enantioenriched diarylmethanol derivatives in the presence of a chiral cyano&#8208;bis(oxazoline) ligand. An electroanalytical study was carried out to gain a better understanding of the mechanism, identifying a proposed ECE&#8208;type mechanism with a formal Ni(I) intermediate and highlighting the key role of the iron salts released by the soluble anode.







Abstract
The preparation of enantioenriched diarylmethanol derivatives is described using nickel&#8208;catalyzed electrochemical cross&#8208;couplings between various alkyl/aryl aldehydes and aryl iodides. Performed in an electrochemical cell equipped with an iron anode and a nickel cathode, this electrocatalytic variant led to the scalemic targeted products in the presence of 2,2&#8208;bis((4&#8197;R,5S)&#8208;4,5&#8208;diphenyl&#8208;4,5&#8208;dihydrooxazol&#8208;2&#8208;yl)acetonitrile (L2), as enantiopure cyano&#8208;bis(oxazoline) ligand. X&#8208;ray structure analysis of a pre&#8208;catalyst, for instance the [Ni(II)(L2)2] complex, with L2 as an anionic bisoxazolinate ligand, confirms the chemical formulation of one nickel surrounded by two ligands. The redox behavior of the new Ni complexes generated in&#8197;situ was first assessed by cyclic voltammetry showing a redox wave at ca. &#8722;1.5&#8197;V that can be assigned to the two&#8208;electron reduction of the Ni(II) center to the Ni(0) state. Oxidative addition between the electrogenerated Ni(0) complex and aryl iodide was evidenced. An intense current was observed in presence of a mixture of the two substrates pertaining an electrocatalytic process. Interestingly, we found that the sacrificial iron anode plays a crucial role in the catalytic mechanism.

         <title>Resolving the Structure of a Guanine Quadruplex in TMPRSS2 Messenger RNA by Circular Dichroism and Molecular Modeling</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 71, December 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have determined the structure of a guanine quadruplex motif present in the messenger RNA of the TMPRSS2 protein. By using a combination of molecular dynamics simulations and circular diuchroism spectroscopy we confirm a parallel arrangement involving a rigid tetrad core and flexible loops.







Abstract
The presence of a guanine quadruplex in the opening reading frame of the messenger RNA coding for the transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) may pave the way to original anticancer and host&#8208;oriented antiviral strategy. Indeed, TMPRSS2 in addition to being overexpressed in different cancer types, is also related to the infection of respiratory viruses, including SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2, by promoting the cellular and viral membrane fusion through its proteolytic activity. The design of selective ligands targeting TMPRSS2 messenger RNA requires a detailed knowledge, at atomic level, of its structure. Therefore, we have used an original experimental&#8208;computational protocol to predict the first resolved structure of the parallel guanine quadruplex secondary structure in the RNA of TMPRSS2, which shows a rigid core flanked by a flexible loop. This represents the first atomic scale structure of the guanine quadruplex structure present in TMPRSS2 messenger RNA.

         <title>Investigating the Effect of UV Irradiation and TiO2 Addition on Heavy Metal Adsorption by Inverse Vulcanized Sulfur Polymers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 71, December 18, 2024. </description>

The influence of light exposure on the process of mercury adsorption was explored in this study. Our findings reveal that exposure to UV&#8722;A wavelengths (315&#8197;nm&#8211;400&#8197;nm), in combination with the addition of titanium dioxide (TiO2), enhances the adsorption capacity of a sulfur&#8208;rich polymer. The maximum observed adsorption capacity reached 47&#8197;mg/g under these conditions. Notably, the presence of TiO2 and UV exposure did not significantly impact the adsorption of inorganic mercury and gold.







Abstract
Organomercury contamination in wastewater is a longstanding global concern, prompting the establishment of the Mi&#8208;namata Convention in 2013, following the tragic Minamata Bay incident in Japan. Despite numerous proposed solutions, the development of an affordable and convenient adsorbent remains a challenge. Sulfur, being one of the most abundant elements globally, has shown promise in mercury adsorption in previous research. This study delves into the influence of light exposure on the process of mercury adsorption. Our findings reveal that exposure to UV&#8722;A wavelengths (315&#8197;nm&#8211;400&#8197;nm), in combination with the addition of titanium dioxide (TiO2), enhances the adsorption capacity of a sulfur&#8208;rich polymer.

         <title>Microwave&#8208;Assisted One&#8208;Step Synthesis of Palladium&#8208;Encapsulated Covalent Organic Frameworks for Heterogeneous Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 71, December 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rapid and efficient one&#8208;step synthesis of Pd(II)&#8208;encapsulated covalent organic framework (COF) composites has been developed via a versatile microwave&#8208;assisted in&#8197;situ encapsulation strategy. Unlike the traditional multi&#8208;step synthesis, this approach establishes a succinct, expeditious, generalizable, and scalable route to access various Pd(II)/COFs.







Abstract
Metal&#8208;encapsulated covalent organic frameworks (metal/COFs) represent an emerging paradigm in heterogeneous catalysis. However, the time&#8208;intensive (usually 4 or more days) and tedious multi&#8208;step synthesis of metal/COFs remains a significant stumbling block for their broad application. To address this challenge, we introduce a facile microwave&#8208;assisted in&#8197;situ metal encapsulation strategy to cooperatively combine COF formation and in&#8197;situ palladium(II) encapsulation in one step. With this unprecedented approach, we synthesize a diverse range of palladium(II)&#8208;encapsulated COFs (termed Mw&#8208;Pd/COF) in the air within just an hour. Notably, this strategy is scalable for large&#8208;scale production (~0.5&#8197;g). Leveraging the high crystallinity, porosity, and structural stability, one representative Mw&#8208;Pd/COF exhibits remarkable activity, functional group tolerance, and recyclability for the Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura coupling reaction at room temperature, surpassing most previously reported Pd(II)/COF catalysts with respect to catalytic performance, preparation time, and synthetic ease. This microwave&#8208;assisted in&#8197;situ metal encapsulation strategy opens a facile and rapid avenue to construct metal/COF hybrids, which hold enormous potential in a multitude of applications including heterogeneous catalysis, sensing, and energy storage.

Insights into the molecular mechanism and factors affecting nitrite&#8208;to&#8208;NO transformation at transition metal sites are essential for developing sustainable technologies relevant to NO&#8208;based therapeutics, waste water treatment, and agriculture. A set of copper(II)&#8211;nitrite complexes 1&#8211;4 have been isolated employing tridentate pincer&#8208;type ligands (quL, pyL, ClArOL&#8722;, PhOL&#8722;) featuring systematically varied donors. Although the X&#8208;ray crystal structures of the copper(II)&#8211;nitrite cores in 1&#8211;4 are comparable, electrochemical studies on complexes 1&#8211;4 reveal that redox properties of these complexes differ due to the changes in the &#963;&#8208;donor abilities of the phenolate/N&#8208;heterocycle based donor sites. Reactivity of these nitrite complexes with oxygen&#8208;atom&#8208;transfer (OAT) reagent (e.&#8201;g. triphenyl phosphine Ph3P) and H+/e&#8722; donor reagent (e.&#8201;g. substituted phenols ArOH) show the reduction of nitrite to NO gas. Detailed kinetic investigations including kinetic isotope effect (KIE), Eyring analyses for determining the activation parameters unfold that reduction of nitrite at copper(II) by Ph3P or ArOH are influenced by the CuII/CuI redox potential. Finally, this study allows mechanism driven development of catalytic nitrite reduction by ArOH in the presence of 10&#8197;mol&#8201;% copper complex (1).

         <title>Synergistic Nanoscale Mn3O4&#8208;CoO&#8208;Co Heterojunctions for Boosting the Selectivity in Hydrogenation of Nitrostyrenes and Nitroarenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 71, December 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Disclosed herein the graphene oxide&#8208;supported nanoscale Mn3O4&#8208;CoO&#8722;Co as highly efficient catalysts for low&#8208;pressure hydrogenation (&lt;5&#8197;bar), proficiently converting nitro groups to amines amid reactive functional groups like C=C, O&#8722;C=O, C=O, C&#8801;N, chalcones, and halides. High selectivity and yield arise from the synergistic interaction between CoO and Mn3O4, facilitated by charge relocalization crucial for maintaining selectivity, a feature notably compromised in catalysts containing MnO, CoO, Co3O4, and other Co and Mn oxides.







Abstract
Metal&#8211;metal oxide interface catalysts are in high demand for advanced catalytic applications due to their multi&#8208;component active sites, which facilitate synergistic cooperation where a single component alone cannot effectively promote the desired reaction. Demonstrated herein graphene oxide&#8208;supported nanoscale Mn3O4&#8208;CoO&#8722;Co as highly efficient catalysts for hydrogenation of nitro styrenes/nitro arenes to amino styrenes/arenes under mild reaction conditions (0.5&#8197;MPa and 100&#8201;&#176;C in 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 THF/water). Charge relocalization at the Co&#8208;CoO&#8208;Mn3O4 heterojunction interfaces, primarily driven by Mn3O4, significantly improves reaction selectivity. Replacing Mn3O4 with MnO or using other supported bimetallic CoMnOx catalysts decreases selectivity, leading to the formation of a mixture of products. The catalyst demonstrated remarkable selectivity in converting nitro groups to amines, even in the presence of highly reactive functional groups such as C=C, O&#8722;C=O, C=O, C&#8801;N, chalcones, and halides. It also exhibited high yields, multiple reusability, and a broad substrate scope. This study demonstrates how Mn3O4, in synergy with CoO&#8722;Co, fine&#8208;tunes selectivity, paving the way for the development of advanced metal&#8208;metal oxide interface catalysts to enhance both selectivity and efficiency in organic transformations.

         <title>D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A Type [7]Helicene&#8208;like Imide Derivatives with Tunable Photophysical Properties and Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>

A series of D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A type helical emitters are developed by integrating [7]helicene&#8208;like imide acceptor (A) with five donors (D). These emitters show tunable emission colors from blue to orange and enhanced &#934;FL. Two pairs of enantiomers, (P/M)&#8208;TPA&#8208;NiBTI and (P/M)&#8208;TPE&#8208;NiBTI, exhibit significant CPL activities. This molecular engineering offers a viable strategy for enhancing the &#934;FL of helicene derivatives.







Abstract
Helicenes and their derivatives show great application prospects as circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) materials, but their fluorescence quantum yields (&#934;FLs) need a breakthrough urgently. Herein, we reported a series of D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A type helical luminescent emitters by combining the [7]helicene&#8208;like imide acceptor with five different donors. The obtained five emitters display blue&#8208;to&#8208;orange luminescence and markedly enhanced &#934;FL. Notably, TPA&#8208;NiBTI exhibits the maximum &#934;FL in solution, while TPE&#8208;NiBTI achieves a maximum &#934;FL in the solid state. Their two pairs of enantiomers, (P/M)&#8208;TPA&#8208;NiBTI and (P/M)&#8208;TPE&#8208;NiBTI, exhibit remarkable CPL activities, and their doped PS film both displayed doubled &#934;FLs. Among them, [(P/M)&#8208;TPE&#8208;NiBTI]&#8208;doped PS film exhibits the maximum luminescence dissymmetry factor (|glum|) value of 9.0&#215;10&#8722;4 and the maximum &#934;FL of 22&#8201;%. This molecular design strategy presents a promising approach to improving the &#934;FL of helicene derivatives, thereby facilitating their potential application into chiral optoelectronic devices.

         <title>Front Cover: Preferential Formation of Three&#8208;layered Host&#8211;Guest Complexes of a Planar Dinuclear Metallohost with Alkali Metal Ions (Chem. Eur. J. 71/2024)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 71, December 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three&#8208;layered host&#8211;guest complexes were preferentially formed by complexation of a macrocyclic dinickel metallohost with 2/3&#8197;equiv of larger alkali metal ions (K+, Rb+, Cs+). Spectroscopic and theoretical investigations clearly demonstrated their unique three&#8208;layered structure in which the three metallohost molecules are stacked in a parallel fashion and the two nickel complex moieties in each of the metallohosts are oppositely curved. More information can be found in the Research Article by S. Akine and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202403071).

         <title>Cover Feature: Unveiling the Ultrafast Excitation Energy Transfer in Tetraarylpyrrolo[3,2&#8208;b]pyrrole&#8208;BODIPY Dyads (Chem. Eur. J. 71/2024)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 71, December 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Cover Feature illustrates efficient and fast energy transfer from a tetraarylpyrrolo[3,2&#8208;b]pyrrole (TAPP) unit to a BODIPY moiety in a TAPP&#8211;BODIPY dyad placed in the middle. The central TAPP unit does not fluoresce upon excitation with blue light, rather it transfers its excitation energy to the connected BODIPY moieties. As a result, a high&#8208;intensity greenish&#8208;yellow fluorescence from the BODIPY moieties is observed. Most importantly, energy transfer from the TAPP to BODIPY moieties is lightning fast (femtosecond timescale), as depicted in the graphic. More information can be found in the Research Article by R. Ghosh, S. Mula and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202402669).

Photocatalytic water splitting based on plasmonic metal&#8208;semiconductor composites is demonstrated. In their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202403050), A.&#8197;N. Grigorenko and co&#8208;workers describe an exceptional reversed case of metal&#8208;semiconductor photocatalysts in which metals are used to initiate the water splitting reaction while semiconductors are employed to improve light harvesting through the blackbody effect. The suggested photo&#8208;anodic metamaterials are made of layered MgB2 and transition&#8208;metal dichalcogenides. Importantly, these photo&#8208;anodes split seawater with a high conversion ratio by utilizing most of the solar spectrum.

         <title>Exploring Chemical and Electrochemical Limitations in Sulfide Solid State Electrolytes: A Critical Review on Current Status and Manufacturing Scope</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 71, December 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review provides a comprehensive analysis of solid electrolytes (SEs) as a promising alternative to liquid electrolytes in lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs). It covers SE types, ion transport fundamentals, and manufacturing challenges of all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries (ASSBs). Special focus is given to sulfide SEs, addressing recent advancements, electrochemical challenges, and future directions to enhance battery performance and safety.







Abstract
The escalating demand for sustainable energy storage solutions, driven by the depletion of fossil fuels has stimulated extensive research in advanced battery technologies. Over the past two decades, global primary energy consumption, initially satisfied by non&#8208;renewables, has raised environmental concerns. Despite the availability of renewable sources like solar and wind, storage challenges propel innovation in batteries. Lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) have gained recognition for their high energy density and cost&#8208;effectiveness. However, issues such as safety concerns, dendrite formation, and limited operational temperatures necessitate alternative solutions. A promising approach involves replacing flammable liquid electrolytes with non&#8208;flammable solid electrolytes (SEs). SEs represent a transformative shift in battery technology, offering stability, safety, and expanded temperature ranges. They effectively mitigate dendrite growth, enhancing battery reliability and lifespan. SEs also improve energy density, making them crucial for applications like portable gadgets, electric vehicles, and renewable energy storage. However, challenges such as ionic conductivity, chemical and thermal stability, mechanical strength, and manufacturability must be addressed. This review paper briefly identifies SE types, discusses their advantages and disadvantages, and explores ion transport fundamentals and all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries (ASSBs) production challenges. It comprehensively analyzes sulfide SEs (SSEs), focusing on recent advancements, chemical and electrochemical challenges, and potential future improvements. Electrochemical reactions, electrolyte materials, compositions, and cell designs are critically assessed for their impact on battery performance. The review also addresses challenges in ASSB production. The objective is to provide a comprehensive understanding of SSEs, laying the groundwork for advancing sustainable and efficient energy storage systems.

         <title>Simultaneous Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction and H2O Oxidation Under Non&#8208;Sacrificial Ambient Conditions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 71, December 18, 2024. </description>

Simultaneous photocatalytic CO2 reduction and H2O oxidation under non&#8208;sacrificial ambient conditions is important and challenging. This paper presents a comprehensive review of the two half&#8208;reactions of CO2 reduction and H2O oxidation in photocatalytic CO2 conversion, highlighting the dual&#8208;site photocatalyst design and the key techniques to explore the redox mechanisms at reaction intermediates and excited&#8208;state dynamics.







Abstract
The utilization of CO2, H2O, and solar energy is regarded as a sustainable route for converting CO2 into chemical feedstocks, paving the way for carbon neutrality and reclamation. However, the simultaneous photocatalytic CO2 reduction and H2O oxidation under non&#8208;sacrificial ambient conditions is still a significant challenge. Researchers have carried out extensive exploration and achieved dramatic developments in this area. In this review, we first primarily elucidate the principles of two half&#8208;reactions in the photocatalytic conversion of CO2 with H2O, i.&#8201;e., CO2 reduction by the photo&#8208;generated electrons and protons, and H2O oxidation by the photo&#8208;generated holes without sacrificial agents. Subsequently, the strategies to promote two half&#8208;reactions are summarized, including the vacancy/facet/morphology design, adjacent redox site construction, and Z&#8208;scheme heterojunction development. Finally, we present the advanced in&#8197;situ characterizations and future perspectives in this field. This review aims to provide fresh insights into effectively simultaneous photocatalytic CO2 reduction and H2O oxidation under non&#8208;sacrificial ambient conditions.

         <title>Mechanochemical Transformations of Pharmaceutical Cocrystals: Polymorphs and Coformer Exchange</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 71, December 18, 2024. </description>

The review article presents the current state of knowledge in the field of solid state mechanochemical studies of binary systems, which have found numerous applications in the pharmaceutical industry and materials science.







Abstract
Transformations of solid samples under solvent&#8208;free or minimal solvent conditions set the future trend and define a modern strategy for the production of new materials. Of the various technologies tested in recent years, the mechanochemical approach seems to be the most promising for economic and ecological reasons. The aim of this review article is to present the current state of art in solid state research on binary systems, which have found numerous applications in the pharmaceutical and materials science industries. This article is divided into three sections. In the first part, we describe the new equipment improvements, which include the innovative application of thermo&#8208;mechanochemistry, sono&#8208;mechanochemistry, photo&#8208;mechanochemistry, electro&#8208;mechanochemistry, as well as resonant acoustic mixing (RAM), and transformation under high&#8208;speed sample spinning (&#8220;SpeedMixing&#8221;). A brief description of techniques dedicated to ex&#8208;situ and in&#8208;situ studies of progress and the mechanism of solid matter transformation (PXRD, FTIR, Raman and NMR spectroscopy) is presented. In the second section, we discuss the problem of cocrystal polymorphism highlighting the issue related with correlation between mechanochemical parameters (time, temperature, energy, molar ratio, solvent used as a liquid assistant, surface energy, crystal size, crystal shape) and preference for the formation of requested polymorph. The last part is devoted to the description of the processes of coformer exchange in binary systems forced by mechanical and/or thermal stimuli. The influence of the thermodynamic factor on the selection of the best&#8208;suited partner for the formation of a two&#8208;component stable structure is presented.

         <title>200 Years of The Haloform Reaction: Methods and Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 71, December 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Known for over 200&#8197;years, the haloform reaction is one of the oldest organic reactions, enabling the synthesis of carboxylic acids, esters or amides from methyl ketones via exhaustive halogenation. The reaction has not been extensively reviewed since 1934. Herein, we provide an overview of the history and mechanism of the reaction, methodology developments and a survey of applications, particularly in natural product synthesis.







Abstract
Discovered in 1822, the haloform reaction is one of the oldest synthetic organic reactions. The haloform reaction enables the synthesis of carboxylic acids, esters or amides from methyl ketones. The reaction proceeds via exhaustive &#945;&#8208;halogenation and then substitution by a nucleophile to liberate a haloform. The methyl group therefore behaves as a masked leaving group. The reaction methodology has undergone several important developments in the last 200&#8197;years, transitioning from a diagnostic test of methyl ketones to a synthetically useful tool for accessing complex esters and amides. The success of the general approach has been exhibited through the use of the reaction in the synthesis of many different complex molecules in fields ranging from natural product synthesis, pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, fragrants and flavourings. The reaction has not been extensively reviewed since 1934. Therefore, herein we provide details of the history and mechanism of the haloform reaction, as well as an overview of the developments in the methodology and a survey of examples, particularly in natural product synthesis, in which the haloform reaction has been used.

         <title>Apoptosis&#8208;Inducing Activity of a 2&#8208;Hydroxyphenyl Benzamide&#8208;Based Self&#8208;Assembled Anion Channel</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reports readily prepared 2&#8208;hydroxyphenyl benzamide derivatives that self&#8208;assemble into chloride channels through intermolecular hydrogen bonding and &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking interactions. Interestingly, transmembrane chloride transport mediated by the nanotubes induces apoptosis in a human breast cancer MCF&#8208;7&#8197;cell lines while remaining relatively non&#8208;toxic to non&#8208;cancerous cells.







Abstract
Despite the significant interest in designing artificial ion channels, there is limited availability of channel&#8208;forming molecules to tackle complex issues, especially in biological systems. Moreover, a major challenge is the scarcity of chloride transporters that can selectively induce toxicity in cancer cells while minimizing harm to normal healthy cells. This work reports a series of 2&#8208;hydroxyphenyl benzamide&#8208;based small molecules 1&#8201;a&#8211;1&#8201;c, which self&#8208;assemble to form barrel rosette&#8208;type artificial ion channels that adequately transport chloride ions across membranes. The formation of these ion channels primarily relies on intermolecular hydrogen bonding and &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking interactions, as supported by the analysis of single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Importantly, chloride ion transport by these compounds specifically triggers apoptosis in cancer cells while demonstrating relatively low toxicity toward non&#8208;cancerous cell lines.

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Induced ArC(sp3)&#8722;F Bond Activation in Aqueous Media: From DFT Study to Molecular Design</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The photophysical properties of DTMAs, a stepwise photo&#8208;defluorination mechanism and a photo&#8208;induced intramolecular single electron activation model for ArC(sp3)&#8722;F bond in photo&#8208;DAFEx reaction were revealed by TD(DFT) study. Guided by the theoretical studies, new molecules with long excitation wavelength and good activity in photo&#8208;DAFEx reaction were designed and synthesized experimentally.







Abstract
Trifluoromethylarenes (ArCF3) are crucial bioisosteres in medicinal chemistry, but catalyst&#8208;free and controlled photo&#8208;activation of the ArC(sp3)&#8722;F bond remains a significant challenge. The photo&#8208;induced defluorination acyl fluoride exchange (photo&#8208;DAFEx) of m&#8208;trifluoromethylaniline, induced by ultraviolet light, emerges as a promising novel photo&#8208;click reaction for photoaffinity drug discovery. However, the photophysical properties of NMe2PhF2C(sp3)&#8722;F derivatives and factors affecting ArC(sp3)&#8722;F bond activation in photo&#8208;DAFEx are not yet fully understood, hindering the development of new photo&#8208;defluorination reagents with longer absorption wavelength for the photo&#8208;DAFEx. Herein, the photophysical properties, the related mechanism and their affecting factors of a series of ArCF3 compounds are systematically studied using (TD)DFT methods. The skeleton of aromatic core is found to be intimately related to the absorption wavelength needed for ArC(sp3)&#8722;F bond activation. A photo&#8208;induced intramolecular single&#8208;electron activation model was proposed to rationalize the photo&#8208;activation of the ArC(sp3)&#8722;F bond. The transfer of excited electron to C(sp3)&#8722;F antibonding orbital determined the activation. Based on the above knowledge, three novel ArCF3 reagents with extended excitation wavelength were designed and predicted, and the absorption spectra and photo&#8208;defluorination reactivity of two of them with visible absorption wavelength were validated experimentally, which provided a theoretical guidance for designing next&#8208;generation photo&#8208;DAFEx.

&lt;p&gt;The photophysical properties of DTMAs, a stepwise photo-defluorination mechanism and a photo-induced intramolecular single electron activation model for ArC(sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)&#8722;F bond in photo-DAFEx reaction were revealed by TD(DFT) study. Guided by the theoretical studies, new molecules with long excitation wavelength and good activity in photo-DAFEx reaction were designed and synthesized experimentally.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trifluoromethylarenes (ArCF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) are crucial bioisosteres in medicinal chemistry, but catalyst-free and controlled photo-activation of the ArC(sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)&#8722;F bond remains a significant challenge. The photo-induced defluorination acyl fluoride exchange (photo-DAFEx) of m-trifluoromethylaniline, induced by ultraviolet light, emerges as a promising novel photo-click reaction for photoaffinity drug discovery. However, the photophysical properties of NMe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;PhF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C(sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)&#8722;F derivatives and factors affecting ArC(sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)&#8722;F bond activation in photo-DAFEx are not yet fully understood, hindering the development of new photo-defluorination reagents with longer absorption wavelength for the photo-DAFEx. Herein, the photophysical properties, the related mechanism and their affecting factors of a series of ArCF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; compounds are systematically studied using (TD)DFT methods. The skeleton of aromatic core is found to be intimately related to the absorption wavelength needed for ArC(sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)&#8722;F bond activation. A photo-induced intramolecular single-electron activation model was proposed to rationalize the photo-activation of the ArC(sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)&#8722;F bond. The transfer of excited electron to C(sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)&#8722;F antibonding orbital determined the activation. Based on the above knowledge, three novel ArCF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; reagents with extended excitation wavelength were designed and predicted, and the absorption spectra and photo-defluorination reactivity of two of them with visible absorption wavelength were validated experimentally, which provided a theoretical guidance for designing next-generation photo-DAFEx.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Kagome Lattice of Lanthanide Atoms in a 2D Er&#8208;Directed Metal&#8208;Organic Coordination Network</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The deposition and subsequent annealing of TTDP molecules, bestowing pyridyl moieties to promote metal&#8208;organic bonding, along with Er atoms on a Au(111) surface, enables the creation of a well&#8208;defined kagome lattice of lanthanide elements.







Abstract
Kagome lattices have attracted much attention due the very interesting properties they can exhibit, both from the electronic and the magnetic points of view, although much of the experimental studies have been reported on 3D metals or 2D nanosheets. In the past few years, on&#8208;surface synthesis has allowed the fabrication of strictly monolayer 2D metal&#8208;organic networks, many of them containing transition metals. In this paper we report the fabrication and the study of the electronic and magnetic properties of a monolayer 2D metal&#8208;organic network where the nodes are lanthanide atoms forming a kagome lattice.

         <title>A Stable Carbon&#8208;Centered Radical Showing Six Amphoteric Redox States</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fully conjugated system built by alternate fusion of four benzene and three cyclopentadiene rings is a further rare example of an air&#8208; and moisture&#8208;stable carbon&#8208;centered hydrocarbon radical. It was synthesized by double ortho fusion and was extensively characterized by spectroscopic and computational methods.







Abstract
An air&#8208; and moisture&#8208;stable hydrocarbon radical with four six&#8208; and three five&#8208;membered rings alternately fused to a heptacycle was obtained by ortho fusion in a suitably ortho,ortho&#8217;&#8208;substituted diphenylfluorene and subsequent re&#8208;establishment of the conjugation. The radical was obtained in five consecutive steps from commercially available starting materials with a total yield of 34&#8201;%; key steps are Suzuki couplings and cyclizing SEAr reactions. Mesityl substituents at the five&#8208;membered rings ensure the stability of the radical. This cyclopenta&#8208;fused polyaromatic hydrocarbon (CP&#8208;PAH) was characterized by EPR and UV/Vis spectroscopy and by cyclic voltammetry. Quantum chemical calculation disclosed further properties and led to simulated spectra (spin densities, aromaticity, orbital energies, and UV/Vis/NIR). This radical is best described with the unpaired electron centered in the outer five&#8208;membered rings; these resonance formulas show the largest number of fully intact benzene rings. Its triradical character was computed to be very small and can be neglected. The five&#8208;membered rings show notable antiaromatic character, especially in the central ring. The constitution of the radical could be further substantiated by X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis of its direct precursor.

         <title>Nucleophilic Amination of Aryl Halides with an Azanide Surrogate</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report the conversion of electron&#8208;deficient (hetero)aryl halides into primary N&#8208;aryl amines by using an anionic amidine nucleophile as an azanide (&#8722;NH2) surrogate. The developed surrogate is a safer and more selective alternative to existing anionic N&#8208;nucleophiles, such as alkali metal amides or azide salts.







Abstract
We report the development of an azanide (&#8722;NH2) surrogate which enables the facile conversion of electron&#8208;deficient (hetero)aryl halides into primary N&#8208;aryl amines under transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free conditions. The designed amidine reagent is easy to prepare, bench stable, and undergoes facile N&#8208;arylation under basic conditions at 40&#8201;&#176;C. Intermediate N&#8208;aryl amidines are readily cleaved to form N&#8208;aryl amines in&#8197;situ through hydrolysis or base&#8208;promoted elimination. The developed surrogate is a safer and more selective alternative to existing anionic N&#8208;nucleophiles, such as alkali metal amides or azide salts.

         <title>Defluorinative Diazolation&#8208;Cyclization Relay for Synthesis of Furan&#8208;Bridged Triheterocycles and Colorimetric Sensor Application</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polyaromatics, as the assembly of diverse cyclic &#960;&#8208;systems, exhibit unique physicochemical properties when compared to their individual constituents. In this study, we developed a strategic connection of two azacycles via a furan bridge through a defluorinative diazolation&#8208;cyclization reaction of trifluoromethyl enones and N&#8208;heterocycles. A range of modular 2,4&#8208;furan&#8208;bridged triheterocycles (FBTHs), featuring a C3&#8208;trifluoromethyl group, was synthesized with broad substrate scope and good regioselectivity under transition metal&#8208;free conditions. This three&#8208;component protocol was achieved through successive C(sp3)&#8208;F bond functionalization of one trifluoromethyl group, which is recognized for its stability and durability. Moreover, the synthetically useful functionalities such as bromide and formyl group could be easily installed on the resulting products, and the imidazole&#8208;containing FBTH could serve as a valuable ligand in the preparation of an advanced colorimetric sensor, thereby underscoring their potential applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Fisetin as a Blueprint for Senotherapeutic Agents &#8212; Elucidating Geroprotective and Senolytic Properties with Molecular Modeling</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Targeting senescent cells and the factors that accelerate this pathological state has recently emerged as a novel field in medicinal chemistry. As attention shifts to synthetic substances, studies on natural agents are often overlooked. In this paper, we present a detailed computational modeling study that encompasses quantum mechanics and molecular dynamics to elucidate the senotherapeutic activity of fisetin. The mitochondrial environment, serving as a proxy for senescence, received special attention. Throughout the study, fisetin&#8217;s outstanding geroprotective properties&#8212;exhibiting significant potential against&#160;&#8226;OOH, O2&#8226;&#8211;, and&#160;&#8226;OH radicals, surpassing those of Trolox or ascorbate&#8212;were identified. Furthermore, fisetin demonstrated a high capacity to restore oxidatively damaged biomolecules to their pristine forms, thereby renewing the functionality of proteins and amino acids. The senolytic properties were examined in terms of Bcl&#8211;2 and Bcl&#8211;xL inhibition. The results indicated that fisetin not only binds effectively to these proteins but also, with appropriate modifications, may exhibit specific selectivity toward either target. This study highlights fisetin&#8217;s remarkable activity in these areas and provides a molecular description of the underlying processes, paving the way for future research.</dc:description>

         <title>Towards White Light Emission Through Metal&#8208;to&#8208;Metal Charge Transfer (MMCT) Effect in Bi3+ Activated Ca2YTi2&#8208;mZrmGa3O12 (0 &#8804; m &#8804; 2) Garnets</title>

         <dc:description>Herein, we report the high&#8208;temperature solid&#8208;state synthesis and intriguing optical features of Bi3+/Ln3+ doped Ca2YTi2Ga3O12 (CYT). The optical properties of CYT were fine&#8208;tuned by judiciously substituting Zr4+ ions at Ti4+ sites and Bi3+, Ln3+ ions at Y3+ sites. All these compounds are crystallized in a cubic crystal system with an Ia&#8208;3d (no. 230) space group. The Bi3+ doped systems showed a broad photoluminescence (PL) band in the yellow&#8208;orange region centered at ~552 nm from the metal&#8208;to&#8208;metal charge transfer state (MMCT). The yellow&#8208;orange emissive CYT:Bix was co&#8208;doped with blue emissive Tm3+ to obtain an excitation wavelength&#8208;dependent color tuneable white light phosphor CYT:Tm0.02Bi0.012. Substituting Zr4+ ions in place of Ti4+ ions in CYT gave rise to CYTZ (Ca2YTi2&#8208;mZrmGa3O12), which upon doping with Bi gave Ca2YZr2Ga3O12:Bix (CYZ:Bix) and they exhibit the 3P0,1 &#8594; 1S0 emission in the violet&#8208;indigo region (&#955;em = 395 nm; &#955;ex = 315 nm). On co&#8208;doping CYTZ:Bix with Sm3+ ions produced white light emissive Ca2YTi0.1Zr1.9Ga3O12:Bi3+; Sm3+, (CYTZ:Bi3+; Sm3+). CYT:Bix showed slower (microsecond) PL decay than the CYZ:Bix (nanosecond). The crystal structure, steady state, and time&#8208;resolved optical studies, and semiempirical calculations were employed to rationalize the optical features. The optical features of CYT:Bi0.1, were explored for potential applications in secret writing.</dc:description>

         <title>Helical Supramolecular Polymers Formed via Head&#8208;to&#8208;Tail Host&#8208;Guest Complexation of Chiral Bisporphyrin Monomers with Trinitrofluorenone</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The intermolecular host&#8208;guest complexation of head&#8208;to&#8208;tail monomers consisting of cleft&#8208;shaped bisporphyrin and trinitrofluorenone units connected by a chiral binaphthyl linker was employed to construct helically twisted supramolecular polymers. Results from 1H NMR, diffusion&#8208;ordered NMR spectroscopy, and viscometry experiments revealed that the supramolecular polymerization of these monomers follows a ring&#8208;chain competition mechanism. The introduction of bulky substituents at the linker significantly suppressed the formation of macrocyclic oligomers, whereas smaller alkyl chains facilitated the formation of the cyclic form. The chirally twisted structures of the supramolecular polymers were confirmed using circular dichroism spectroscopy. Atomic force microscopy revealed that the (R)&#8208; and (S)&#8208;configurations of the binaphthyl linkers induced right&#8208; and left&#8208;handed helical structures, respectively, in the supramolecular polymer chains. The absence of cooperativity in the supramolecular copolymerization of (R)&#8208; and (S)&#8208;1a resulted in the formation of stereo&#8208;random supramolecular copolymers.</dc:description>

         <title>Inter&#8208; and intra&#8208;molecular charge redistributions in H&#8208;bonded Cyanuric Acid*Melamine (CA*M) networks: insight from core level spectroscopy and natural bond orbital analysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this work, we elucidate the electronic charge redistributions that occur within the cyanuric acid (CA) and melamine (M) molecules upon formation of the triple H&#8208;bond between the imide group of CA and the diaminopyridine group of M. To achieve this, we investigated 2D H&#8208;bonded assemblies of M, CA and CA*M grown on the Au(111) surface, using X&#8208;ray photoemission (XPS) and near edge X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure (NEXAFS) spectroscopies. Compared to the homomolecular networks, the spectra of the mixed sample reveal core level shifts in opposite directions for CA and M, indicating a nearly complementary charge accumulation on the CA molecule and a charge depletion on the M molecule. These findings were further confirmed by theoretical simulation of the ionization potentials (IPs), which were computed using unsupported models of the H&#8208;bonded networks. A natural bond orbital (NBO) analysis performed on the three systems helped to rationalize the net charge transfer form M to CA. Finally, we observed that intramolecular interactions (electron delocalization effects) contribute progressively to the charge redistributions inside the two molecules when going from the homomolecular to the heteromolecular networks.</dc:description>

         <title>The Impact of Single Amino Acid Insertion on the Supramolecular Assembly Pathway of Aromatic Peptide Amphiphiles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Understanding the mechanism of self&#8208;assembly driven by non&#8208;covalent interactions is crucial for designing supramolecular materials with desired properties. Here we investigate the self&#8208;assembly of aromatic peptide amphiphiles, Fmoc&#8208;L2QG and Fmoc&#8208;L3QG using a combination of spectroscopic, transmission electron and superresolution optical microscopy techniques. Our results show that Fmoc&#8208;L2QG leads to concentration&#8208;dependent assembly, forming fibrous assemblies at low concentrations and supramolecular droplets via liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation (LLPS) at higher concentrations. Mechanical activation using for example ultrasonication triggered the transition from metastable droplets to fibre morphologies of Fmoc&#8208;L2QG. In contrast, Fmoc&#8208;L3QG followed both on&#8208;pathway and off&#8208;pathway routes, resulting in the formation of fibrous morphologies regardless of concentration. Seeding experiments revealed that homo&#8208;seeds of the same peptide sequence accelerated the on&#8208;pathway process, while hetero&#8208;seeds of a mismatched peptide sequences accelerated the off&#8208;pathway process, highlighting the competing nature of the complex assembly profile. These findings demonstrate the significant impact of single amino acid insertion on the supramolecular assembly process of oligopeptide monomers, and highlight the potential for controlling the structure and dynamics of peptide materials. Pathway engineering of oligopeptide building blocks and multidomain supramolecular monomers will open new avenues in tailor&#8208;made and customizable supramolecular biomaterials.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Herein, we report Pd&#8208;catalyzed C(sp2)&#8208;H acylation using aldehyde as acyl source and O2 as the green oxidant at room temperature. A selective association of acyl radical formed in&#8208;situ during aldehyde autoxidation with Pd&#8208;catalysis is the key to the process. The reaction afforded products in good yields (up to 82%) and it is scalable. The proposed PdII/PdIII&#8208;catalytic cycle is supported by a series of control studies and DFT calculations.</dc:description>

         <title>Mechanism&#8208;Guided Development of Bifunctional Cyclooctenes as Active, Practical, and Light&#8208;Gated Bromination Catalysts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Most molecular catalysts have been developed employing polar functional groups as catalytic sites. However, the use of non&#8208;polar functional groups for catalysis has received less attention due to their modest molecular interactions while the bioorthogonal reactivity of non&#8208;polar alkenes as substrates is frequently used in click chemistry. In this study, we conducted mechanistic studies on the catalysis of trans&#8208;cyclooctene (TCO) derivatives with the strained olefin as the catalytic site using kinetic and computational analyses to aid the design of more active olefin catalysts. The analysis reveals the significant role of the benzyl substituents in accelerating the generation of bromonium species through dispersion interaction in the rate&#8208;determining step. Guided by the mechanistic insights, we developed bifunctional TCO catalysts bearing a functionalized benzyl group, taking advantage of the remarkable substituent effects. Experimental studies confirmed the theoretical model and revealed that TCO with a para&#8208;hydroxybenzyl group provided excellent catalytic activity. Furthermore, inclusion of the functionalized benzyl groups allowed more readily available and robust cis&#8208;cyclooctenes to be used as active catalysts, expanding the practical utility of the olefin catalysts. By using a photochemically labile masking group on the para&#8208;hydroxybenzyl substituent, the first light&#8208;gated bromination catalyst was developed, enabling spatiotemporal control of the transformation.</dc:description>

         <title>DiQuinoline&#8208;MonoQuinazoline: A Flat Proton Binder and Its Application as a Polyaromatic Hydrocarbon Scavenger and G4 Ligand</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A new miniaturized framework for graphitic material featuring three neighboring pyridinic nitrogen atoms is disclosed. The quinoline/quinazoline hybridized pseudo trimeric macrocycle, DiQuinoline(Q)&#8208;MonoQuinazolines(Qz), Q2Qz1, was readily synthesized from the key macrocyclic amide precursor in a modular fashion. Its central cavity strongly captures a proton, and the thus&#8208;formed positively charged, highly planar architecture exhibits supramolecular complexation through &#120587;&#8208;interactions. Q2Qz1, with its unique properties, was applied as a scavenger for toxic polyaromatic hydrocarbons and as a G&#8208;quartet ligand for potential therapeutic agent for cancer chemotherapy.</dc:description>

         <title>Cross&#8208;Transition&#8208;Dipole Stacking of Conjugated Organic Molecules: Structure, Exciton Behavior and Optoelectronic Property</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cross&#8208;transition&#8208;dipole stacking enables weak exciton coupling, leads to exciton localization, and induces chirality in organic solids, which emerged as a unique molecular stacking mode for enhanced optoelectronic properties. This mini&#8208;review offers an in&#8208;depth insight and perspective in this packing mode.







Abstract
Organic conjugated molecules have gained widespread application as organic semiconductors due to their unique optoelectronic properties. The rigidity of these large conjugated structures facilitates strong intermolecular interactions, which significantly influence their properties in the solid state through various molecular arrangements. The study of the relationship among molecular arrangement, exciton behavior, and optoelectronic properties is an eternal research topic. Cross&#8208;dipole stacking is a specific molecular arrangement that demonstrates unique characteristics and has received continuous attention over the past decades. This mini&#8208;review will first discuss the unique exciton behaviors in cross&#8208;dipole stacking based on exciton models, including weak exciton coupling and suppression of F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer. These exciton behaviors, determined by molecular stacking arrangements, are fundamental to the optoelectronic properties of cross&#8208;dipole stacking systems. Next, we will introduce well&#8208;defined cross&#8208;dipole systems and summarize their design principles from a molecular structure perspective. Finally, we will present the specific optoelectronic properties of cross&#8208;dipole stacking systems and their outstanding performance, such as high solid&#8208;state luminescence, good charge carrier mobility, and significant CD/CPL. Through this mini&#8208;review, we hope to enhance the understanding of cross&#8208;dipole stacking, contributing to the construction of such systems, the exploration of excited&#8208;state behaviors, and the discovery of high&#8208;performance materials.

         <title>Utilizing Alkyne&#8208;Nitrone Cycloaddition for the Convenient Multi&#8208;Component Assembly of Protein Degraders and Biological Probes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a fast, modular, and convenient multi&#8208;component assembly strategy of multi&#8208;functional molecules via strain&#8208;promoted alkyne&#8211;nitrone cycloaddition (SPANC), facilitating the synthesis of proteolysis&#8208;targeting chimeras (PROTACs) and biological probes. The 2&#8208;component PROTACs were assembled via SPANC in&#8197;vivo. The 3&#8208;component PROTACs were assembled by sequential nitrone formation and SPANC, and photocages can be used to provide extra control of protein degradation.







Abstract
Proteolysis&#8208;targeting chimeras (PROTACs) have become a popular therapeutic strategy, and the development of multi&#8208;functional PROTACs has added complexity to their synthetic process. Although click reactions have been widely applied to prepare highly functionalized biomolecules, most of them are limited to two&#8208;component reactions, restricting the creation of more complex structures. Here, we developed a convenient multi&#8208;component assembly strategy via strain&#8208;promoted alkyne&#8211;nitrone cycloaddition (SPANC), which can be extended to a 3&#8208;component reaction when combined with nitrone formation. Using the 2&#8208;component assembly, we demonstrated the targeted protein degradation with both preassembled and in&#8208;cell assembled PROTACs. This strategy was also applied to facilitate the screening of E3 ligases in PROTACs and the preparation of various biological probes. Moreover, the 3&#8208;component assembly, via sequential nitrone formation and SPANC, enabled the synthesis of trifunctional 3&#8208;component PROTACs. The N&#8208;substituent, serving as an additional functional moiety, was designed as a photocage for sterically controlling PROTAC activity. The 3&#8208;component assembly can be further modified to provide additional control or enhance the cell&#8208;targeting ability of PROTACs. In short, our multi&#8208;component SPANC assembly strategy offers a modular and versatile synthetic platform for creating multi&#8208;functional PROTACs and biological probes.

         <title>Photocatalyzed Dehydration of 1&#8208;Aryl&#8208;1,2&#8208;Ethanediols to Methyl Ketones Driven by Eosin Y Fragmentation Products</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
&#8220;How would you remove water from your molecule with light?&#8221; Herein, we report a mild photocatalytic dehydration protocol for aryl&#8208;1,2&#8208;ethanediols. Our mechanistic studies suggest a hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) and a 1,2&#8208;spin center shift (SCS) as key steps. Eosin Y photodissociation products serve as a highly efficient catalytic mixture.







Abstract
Herein, we report a mild photocatalytic redox&#8208;neutral dehydration of aryl&#8208;1,2&#8208;ethanediols forming the respective methyl ketones. In the proposed mechanistic cycle an initial hydrogen atom abstraction (HAT) is followed by a 1,2&#8208;spin center shift (SCS) as key steps. Interestingly, Eosin Y was found to act as a pre&#8208;catalyst dissociating into a catalytically active mixture under irradiation. To the best of our knowledge, this exemplifies the first synthetic utilization of Eosin Y degradation products. As a result, our reaction can be realized with a single organic photocatalyst and releases water as a sole by&#8208;product.

         <title>Basic&#8208;Functionalized Ionic Porous Organic Polymers: Triple Roles in One for Highly Efficient and Recyclable Carboxylative Cyclization of CO2 under Mild Conditions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Basic&#8208;functionalized ionic porous organic polymers (IPOPs) DCX&#8208;4&#8208;Tetz/Ag2O exhibited highly efficient and recyclable performance for the cycloaddition of CO2 under mild condition due to its triple roles as adsorbent, activator and stabilizer, eliminating the use of extra organic bases.







Abstract
The transformation of carbon dioxide (CO2) into high&#8208;value chemicals is a significant step towards achieving the goal of &#8220;carbon neutrality&#8221;. &#945;&#8208;methylene cyclic carbonate, as an intermediate for the synthesis of many important organic compounds, is widely employed in industrial productions. In this work, a series of ionic porous organic polymers (IPOPs) with different basic&#8208;functionalized anions were successfully synthesized and adjusted to have certain BET surface areas and high contents of ion sites by post&#8208;modification. These basic&#8208;functionalized IPOPs could exhibit excellent catalytic performance for carboxylative cyclization of CO2 at 30&#8201;&#176;C and 1&#8197;bar in presence of silver salts, eliminating the use of the extra organic bases. In the whole catalytic reaction, the basic&#8208;functionalized anions could play triple roles: enriching CO2 for further transformation, activating the hydroxyl groups of substrates to improve the catalytic performance, while coordinating with Ag atom to stabilize and regenerate catalyst. Notably, the catalytic system of DCX&#8208;4&#8208;Tet/Ag2O exhibited excellent recyclability, and the yield of &#945;&#8208;alkylidene cyclic carbonate was well maintained at 99&#8201;% after 5&#8197;cycles. To the best of our knowledge, the catalytic system was the first example of basic&#8208;functionalized IPOPs that played multiple roles for highly efficient CO2 cyclization under mild conditions without any extra organic bases.

         <title>Site&#8208;Selective Ligand Functionalization Reverses Hypsochromic Luminescence Shifts in Platinum(II) Complexes of Benzannulated NCN&#8208;Coordinating Ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>

Reversing the Trend: Phenanthridine (benzo[c]quinoline) donors defy conventional logic that increasing ligand benzannulation leads to bathochromic (red) shifts in the absorption and emission of their coordination complexes. Here, we provide a counterfactual that reverses this trend: substitution at the phenanthridine 6&#8208;position (i.&#8201;e., at the C=N sub&#8208;unit) breaks the phenanthridine's tendency to cause hypsochromic luminescence shifts.







Abstract
Ligands containing phenanthridine (benzo[c]quinoline) have presented notable exceptions to the conventional logic that increasing ligand benzannulation leads to bathochromic (red) shifts in the absorption and emission of their coordination complexes. The counterintuitive blue shifts have been attributed to the peculiar structure of phenanthridines, whose ground states are dominated by imine&#8208;bridged biphenyl resonance contributors. These serve to isolate the C=N unit electronically from the rest of the ligand framework and allow the C=N moiety to act as a &#8216;shock&#8208;absorber&#8217;, buffering against larger molecular distortions in a molecule's excited state, and reducing the observed pseudo&#8208;Stokes&#8217; shift. Here, we provide experimental evidence for this assertion in the form of a counterfactual that reverses this trend: substitution at the phenanthridine 6&#8208;position (i.&#8201;e., at the C=N sub&#8208;unit) breaks the phenanthridine's tendency to cause hypsochromic luminescence shifts. The synthesis, full characterization, and comparison of 2&#8208;quinolinyl and 6&#8208;phenanthridinyl exemplars is provided, supported by a detailed theoretical treatment.

         <title>Peptide Designs for Cell&#8208;Interfacing Assemblies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This concept review underscores the pivotal role of designing cell&#8208;interfacing peptide assemblies, including the precise control of displayed molecules, the regulation of molecular dynamics to modulate cell behaviors, and responsiveness to biological stimuli. Finally, the development of advanced cell&#8208;interfacing biomaterials is summarized and prospected.







Abstract
Constructing synthetic materials to interact with cells offers significant promise for understanding natural cellular processes and manipulating cell behaviors beyond nature's capabilities. Peptide assemblies are particular promising in this regard, as they have demonstrated efficacy in promoting cell differentiation, repair, and regeneration as supportive scaffolds. However, distinct gaps persist between natural and synthetic assembly systems in various aspects. This Concept review explores representative studies focusing on developing chemical strategies to design peptide assemblies with precise control over displayed molecules, adjustable molecular dynamics to modulate cell behaviors, and responsiveness to biological stimuli. This paper would inspire more fundamental studies on molecular assemblies and foster inter&#8208;disciplinary interests in material applications, advancing the interplay between natural cells and synthetic materials.

         <title>Facile Fabrication of Novel S&#8208;scheme Ag3PO4/g&#8208;C3N4/Zeolite Photocatalyst for Boosting Photocatalytic Tetracycline Degradation and Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The novel S&#8208;scheme Ag3PO4/g&#8208;C3N4/zeolite ternary photocatalyst performed dramatically enhanced photocatalytic TC degradation and hydrogen evolution performance. The improved photocatalytic activity was mainly due to the synergistic effect of S&#8208;scheme Ag3PO4/g&#8208;C3N4 heterojunction and zeolite support. This study provides a promising strategy to develop a low&#8208;cost, efficient, and stable photocatalyst for photocatalytic antibiotic wastewater treatment and hydrogen production.







Abstract
This study presents a novel ternary Ag3PO4/g&#8208;C3N4/zeolite composite for photocatalytic H2 production and TC degradation through S&#8208;scheme electron transport. The S&#8208;scheme Ag3PO4/g&#8208;C3N4 heterojunction was successfully constructed on zeolite surface through calcination and precipitation processes. The results indicated that Ag3PO4/g&#8208;C3N4/zeolite&#8208;50&#8201;% presented dramatically enhanced photocatalytic TC degradation performance, and the TC degradation efficiency was up to 92.86&#8201;% in 180&#8197;min under visible light. The corresponding reaction rate constant was 0.01205&#8197;min&#8722;1 which was 2.18 and 7.48 times greater than those of pure Ag3PO4 (0.00554&#8197;min&#8722;1) and g&#8208;C3N4 (0.00161&#8197;min&#8722;1), respectively. Meanwhile, the highest H2 production rate (2748.6&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1) was achieved over Ag3PO4/g&#8208;C3N4/zeolite&#8208;50&#8201;% under simulated solar light which was around 26.5 and 5.6 times higher than that of g&#8208;C3N4 and Ag3PO4, respectively. The enhanced photocatalytic activity of the ternary composite was mainly due to the synergistic effect of S&#8208;scheme Ag3PO4/g&#8208;C3N4 heterojunction and zeolite support which endowed the composite with excellent adsorption activity, enhanced light response ability, and efficient separation of photoinduced carriers. TC degradation mechanism and pathways were proposed based on quenching experiment and HPLC&#8208;MS results. Overall, this study proposes a promising strategy for significantly improving photocatalytic activity and applying in photocatalytic pollutant degradation and hydrogen production.

         <title>Click Coupling of Flavylium Dyes with Plasmodione Analogues: Towards New Redox&#8208;Sensitive Pro&#8208;Fluorophores</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Redox&#8208;sensitive pro&#8208;fluorophores based on azido&#8208;flavyliums clicked to alkynyl analogues of plasmodione oxide have been developed. In their quinone form, the fluorescence is quenched by photoinduced electron process (PeT) and restored after reducing to hydroquinone. PEG chain length modulates the amplitude of fluorogenic response. Due to their properties, these hybrid compounds have the potential to evaluate redox alterations in parasitized erythrocytes.







Abstract
The development of redox&#8208;sensitive molecular fluorescent probes for the detection of redox changes in Plasmodium falciparum&#8208;parasitized red blood cells remains of interest due to the limitations of current genetically encoded biosensors. This study describes the design, screening and synthesis of new pro&#8208;fluorophores based on flavylium azido dyes coupled by CuAAC click chemistry to alkynyl analogues of plasmodione oxide, the key metabolite of the potent redox&#8208;active antimalarial plasmodione. The photophysical and electrochemical properties of these probes were evaluated, focusing on their fluorogenic responses. The influence of both the redox status of the quinone and the length of the PEG chain separating the fluorophore from the electrophore on the photophysical properties was investigated. The fluorescence quenching by photoinduced electron transfer is reversible and of high amplitude for probes in oxidized quinone forms and fluorescence is reinstated for reduced hydroquinone forms. Our results demonstrate that shortening the PEG chain has the effect of enhancing the fluorogenic response, likely due to non&#8208;covalent interactions between the two chromophores. All these systems were evaluated for their antiparasitic activities and fluorescence imaging suggests the efficacy of the fluorescent flavylium dyes in P. falciparum&#8208;parasitized red blood cells, paving the way for future parasite imaging studies to monitor cellular redox processes.

A one&#8208;pot hydrosilylation strategy is developed for the functionalization of porous silicon nanoparticles (PSiNPs) with allyl&#8208;tetra&#8208;O&#8208;acetyl&#8208;&#946;&#8208;D&#8208;glucopyranoside (ATAG), using mild temperatures and ethylaluminium dichloride solution (EtAlCl2) as a catalyst. This efficient method reduces reaction times for passivating and bioengineering PSiNPs, enhancing their stability and potential for biomedical applications.







Abstract
Porous silicon is one of the most explored nanostructured materials in various biomedical applications owing to its remarkable properties. However, its inherent chemical instability mandates a robust surface modification procedure, and proper surface bioengineering is essential to ensure its effectiveness in the biomedical field. In this study, we introduce a one&#8208;pot functionalization strategy that simultaneously stabilizes porous silicon nanoparticles and decorates their surface with carbohydrates through hydrosilylation chemistry, combining mild temperatures and a Lewis acid catalyst. This approach yielded a surface functionalization degree of 300&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1 in just 4&#8197;hours at 60&#8201;&#176;C, significantly reducing both the prolonged reaction times and high temperatures typically associated with conventional hydrosilylation. Furthermore, this advancement opens the way for utilizing thermolabile molecules useful for surface bioengineering.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Pd&#8208;catalyzed alkoxycarbonylation of internal alkynes provides a straightforward access to &#945;,&#946;&#8208;disubstituted acrylic esters. Compared with the well&#8208;established regioselective alkoxycarbonylation of terminal alkynes, the regioselective hydrocarboxylation of non&#8208;functionalized unsymmetric internal alkynes was more challenging owing to the delicate differences of properties between the two substituents. Herein, by using either monophosphine ligand based on 2,3&#8208;dihydrobenzo[d][1,3]oxaphosphole motif or bidentate ligand Ph&#8208;Phox, the regioselective alkoxycarbonylations of aryl&#8208;aryl, aryl&#8208;alkyl and alkyl&#8208;alkyl disubstituted alkynes were achieved, giving a diversity of trisubstituted &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated carboxylic esters with moderate to excellent yields and high regioselectivity. The synthetic utility of obtained &#945;,&#946;&#8208;disubstituted acrylic esters was demonstrated.</dc:description>

         <title>Structural Characteristics of a Partially Planarized Triarylmethyl Cation with Unsymmetrical Push&#8211;Pull Structure</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report the physical properties of a new class of triarylmethyl&#8208;based carbocations containing both an electron&#8208;donating diphenyl ether moiety and an electron&#8208;accepting carbonyl group with a helical plane framework. Their unique packing patterns were clarified by X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis, which depend on the counter anions to influence their photophysical properties in the solid states. Notably, the interactions between &#960;&#8208;cation species and planar anion species lead to a unique panchromatic property, accompanying a near&#8208;infrared absorption with a &#955;onset value of 1030 nm, which can be assigned to intermolecular charge transfer transition. We found that the &#960;&#8208;cation species with planar anion formed cation dimers, being stacked in opposite directions. The two cation molecules are flanked by two anions on both the top and bottom side. Pair interaction energy decomposition analysis (PIEDA) calculations imply that the origins of the unique packing patterns of the &#960;&#8208;cations originate from the electrostatic forces of four neighbouring &#960;&#8208;anion species.</dc:description>

         <title>Heterogeneous Catalytic Oxidations with In Situ&#8208;Generated Hypervalent Iodine&#8208;Based Porous Organic Polymers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Porous organic polymers (POPs) are novel emergent materials for heterogeneous organocatalysis owing to their remarkable physicochemical stabilities. Through a bottom&#8208;up approach entailing diligent design of twisted biaryl building blocks with in&#8208;built o&#8208;iodobenzoic acid (IA) moieties, a series of POP precatalysts, p&#8208;OMeIA&#8208;POP, DiMeIA&#8208;POP, and m&#8208;OMeIA&#8208;POP, were synthesized by employing Friedel&#8208;Crafts alkylation. These IA&#8208;POP precatalysts can undergo in situ oxidation in the presence of Oxone&#174; to generate hypervalent iodine(V) species (&#955;5&#8208;iodanes), in particular, modified o&#8208;iodoxybenzoic acid, popularly termed IBX, which mediates diverse oxidative transformations. The applications of m&#8208;OMeIA&#8208;POP as a heterogeneous precatalyst in the presence of Oxone&#174; are demonstrated for facile oxidation of i) primary and secondary alcohols to carbonyl compounds, ii) cleavage of olefins, vicinal diols, and acyloins into carboxylic acids and iii) oxidation of diols to lactones; the in situ formation of the &#955;5&#8208;iodane species in catalytic amounts precludes potential explosive attributes of IBX. It is shown that the IA&#8208;precatalyst (m&#8208;OMeIA&#8208;POP) can be easily recycled without any loss of catalytic activity. The results constitute the first demonstration of the development of IA&#8208;bearing POP precatalysts for in situ generation of hypervalent iodine(V) species and various heterogeneous oxidations mediated therefrom.</dc:description>

In these reactions, cyclic thioureas served as sulfur and NHC (N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene) sources, and the corresponding silanethione and NHC&#8208;derived products formed via silanethione&#8208;NHC complexes. Reactions of cyclic ureas with the silylene afforded a new NHC and an isolable azomethine ylide. These reactions involved oxygen atom transfer and 1,3&#8208;silyl migrations, which were supported by computational studies.</dc:description>

         <title>Luminescent Mechanochromism of a Platinum Complex with Four Monodentate Ligands Governed by Intramolecular Interactions Between Ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A platinum complex equipped with 3&#8208;methylbenzofuryl groups was prepared and its crystal structure and emission properties were investigated. This platinum complex has two distinctly emissive polymorphs: a blue&#8208;emissive polymorph with low intensity and a brightly green&#8208;emissive polymorph. Upon mechanical stimulation, the blue&#8208;emitting phase is converted to green&#8208;emitting powder through a crystal&#8208;to&#8208;crystal phase transition. Structure analyses indicated that intramolecular interactions between ligands control the phase&#8208;transition behavior and the emission properties.</dc:description>

         <title>Dynamic Combinatorial Chemistry Unveils Nsp10 Inhibitors with Antiviral Potential Against SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of antiviral drugs against the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2) responsible for the recent Covid&#8208;19 pandemic is crucial, as treatment options remain limited and vaccination does not prevent (re)infection. Two relatively underexplored targets of this virus are the 3&#8242;&#8208;5&#8242; exoribonuclease (ExoN) and the 2&#8217;&#8208;O&#8208;methyltransferase (2&#8242;&#8208;O&#8208;Mtase), both essential for the viral viability. The non&#8208;structural protein Nsp14 and Nsp16 exhibit enzymatic activities for ExoN and 2&#8242;&#8208;O&#8208;Mtase, respectively, especially when in complex with their co&#8208;factor protein Nsp10. The study focuses on the use of target&#8208;directed dynamic combinatorial chemistry (tdDCC) to identify binders of Nsp10, aiming to disturb the protein&#8208;protein interactions (PPI) involving Nsp10&#8211;Nsp14, as well as Nsp10&#8211;Nsp16. We synthesised the hits and evaluated them to assess Nsp10 affinity, ExoN and 2&#8242;&#8208;O&#8208;Mtase activities inhibition, and anti&#8208;viral activity in hCoV&#8208;229E and SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 infected whole&#8208;cell setting. This study reports a novel class of ExoN and/or 2&#8242;&#8208;O&#8208;Mtase inhibitors exhibiting anti&#8208;viral activity against coronaviruses.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The development of antiviral drugs against the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) responsible for the recent Covid-19 pandemic is crucial, as treatment options remain limited and vaccination does not prevent (re)infection. Two relatively underexplored targets of this virus are the 3&#8242;-5&#8242; exoribonuclease (ExoN) and the 2&#8217;-O-methyltransferase (2&#8242;-O-Mtase), both essential for the viral viability. The non-structural protein Nsp14 and Nsp16 exhibit enzymatic activities for ExoN and 2&#8242;-O-Mtase, respectively, especially when in complex with their co-factor protein Nsp10. The study focuses on the use of target-directed dynamic combinatorial chemistry (tdDCC) to identify binders of Nsp10, aiming to disturb the protein-protein interactions (PPI) involving Nsp10&#8211;Nsp14, as well as Nsp10&#8211;Nsp16. We synthesised the hits and evaluated them to assess Nsp10 affinity, ExoN and 2&#8242;-O-Mtase activities inhibition, and anti-viral activity in hCoV-229E and SARS-CoV-2 infected whole-cell setting. This study reports a novel class of ExoN and/or 2&#8242;-O-Mtase inhibitors exhibiting anti-viral activity against coronaviruses.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Luminescence and Generation of Reactive Oxygen Species in Solution by Ta6Br12 Clusters</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An intrinsic metal cluster NIR&#8208;II emission of the {Ta6Br12}2+ aqua/hydroxocomplexes was determined in aqueous solutions under inert atmosphere. The photoluminescence (PL) is enhanced in D2O, and the lifetime scale expands from nanoseconds to microseconds. Possible cluster emission transitions have been assigned and analyzed from a computational perspective. In the presence of O2, the cluster compound kept its robustness but showed partial quenching of the PL. Stern&#8208;Volmer and laser&#8208;flash photolysis studies confirmed that quenching is mainly associated with O2 diffusion. Laser&#8208;flash photolysis experiments showed that singlet oxygen (1O2) was not detected under measurement conditions. Generation of peroxide and superoxide radical species after irradiation in D2O was confirmed by using luminol as a probe, whereas no hydroxide radical species were detected as evidenced by the emission of the 3&#8208;coumarin carboxylic acid (3&#8208;CCA) molecular sensor.</dc:description>

         <title>Advances in Chiral Macrocycles: Molecular Design and Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chiral macrocycles have recently emerged as promising materials for enantioselective recognition, asymmetric catalysis, and circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) due to their terminal&#8208;free structure, preorganized chiral cavities, and unique host&#8208;guest and self&#8208;assembly properties. This review summarizes recent advances in the design and synthesis of chiral macrocycles with central, axial, helical, and planar chirality, each imparting distinct structural and chiroptical characteristics. We highlight key strategies for constructing these macrocycles and their applications in optoelectronic and catalytic systems. Emphasis is placed on the balance between rigidity and flexibility in macrocycle design, essential for effective molecular recognition, adaptable catalysis, and CPL. We conclude with perspectives on future opportunities, anticipating ongoing developments in chiral macrocycle research.</dc:description>

         <title>Screening of an Antibacterial and Coagulation Multifunctional Peptide and Its Application in Wound Healing</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>As a new type of drug developed in the era of antibiotics, antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) have great potential in antibacterial, antiviral and antitumor aspects. Different from the principle of action of antibiotics, AMPs have a better effect on resisting drug&#8208;resistant bacteria. We synthesized a peptide library using solid&#8208;phase synthesis and successfully screened the antimicrobial peptide RKGAK. AMPs provide effective defense against both bacteria and fungi. Research has found that the lowest inhibitory concentrations of RKGAK against S. aureus, E. coli, and C. albicans are 75 &#956;g/mL, 100 &#956;g/mL, and 300 &#956;g/mL. Not only that, this antibacterial peptide also has certain antiviral and coagulation effects. It is a multifunctional peptide that has great potential in many biomedical fields. It also has the advantages of being less likely to develop drug resistance, low hemolytic activity and low cytotoxicity. Loading the peptide into hydrogels has achieved good results in applications that promote wound healing.</dc:description>

         <title>Dehydrocoupling of Phosphine&#8208;Borane Adducts Under Ambient Conditions using Aminoboranes as Hydrogen Acceptors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report on the reactivity of aminoboranes (R2N=BH2; R =&#160;iPr, Et, Me) with phosphine&#8208;borane adducts (PhR&#697;PH&#8226;BH3; R&#697; = H, Ph): sufficiently sterically unencumbered aminoboranes can accept hydrogen from phosphine&#8208;borane adducts. The hydrogen transfer results in the formation of amine&#8208;borane adducts (R2NH&#8226;BH3) and transient phosphinoboranes (PhR&#697;P&#8211;BH2)&#160;in situ. These phosphinoboranes undergo subsequent reactivity to yield either polyphosphinoborane, [PhPH&#8211;BH2]n, or the linear dimer, Ph2PH&#8226;BH2&#8211;Ph2P&#8226;BH3. Unlike metal catalyzed phosphine&#8208;borane dehydrocoupling, which occurs at elevated temperatures (2 M, toluene, &#8805; 100 &#176;C, &#8805; 24 h), these dehydrocoupling reactions occur under ambient conditions (2 M, Et2O or C6D6, 20 &#176;C, &#8804; 24 h). We performed a computational mechanistic study in which we identified that this transformation potentially occurs&#160;via&#160;a P&#8208;to&#8208;N and B&#8208;to&#8208;B hydrogen transfer&#160;via&#160;a&#160;6&#8208;membered transition state.</dc:description>

Natural coconut silk is employed to synthesize a CSC with hierarchical pore structure and rich oxygen&#8208;containing functional groups, which is used to compound with Si to obtain CSC/Si composite, and delivers decent electrochemical performances.







Abstract
Silicon (Si) is considered to be one of the most promising anode materials for next&#8208;generation lithium&#8208;ion batteries because of its abundant reserves, low discharge potential, and most importantly, its high theoretical specific capacity. However, the practical application of Si&#8208;based anodes is mainly hindered by the low intrinsic conductivity of Si and the large volume change upon lithiation/de&#8208;lithiation. In order to improve the electrochemical performance of Si&#8208;based anodes, we prepared a composite material consisting of Si nanoparticles (NPs) and coconut silk bio&#8208;carbon (CSC) skeleton. The porous carbon skeleton derived from coconut silk with natural through&#8208;holes and ample micropores on the wall, which was used as the carrier of Si NPs. The continuous through&#8208;holes and well&#8208;distributed oxygen&#8208;containing functional groups of the CSC provided sufficient space and abundant adsorption active sites for Si NPs, what&#8216;s more, the good dispersion of Si NPs in the through&#8208;holes increased their contact with the surrounding carbon materials, which was conducive to electron transport. Meanwhile, the pore structure also provided buffer space for the volume expansion of Si. The rich oxygen&#8208;containing functional groups can form a certain chemical force with silicon particles, and further stabilize the nano silicon particles. Hence, the CSC/Si electrode revealed an excellent capacity retention of 82.8&#8201;% at 1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 100 cycles. This study provides a simple universal high&#8208;throughput method to obtain anode materials with outstanding electrochemical properties and promotes the further development of Si/C composites.

&lt;p&gt;Silicon (Si) is considered to be one of the most promising anode materials for next-generation lithium-ion batteries because of its abundant reserves, low discharge potential, and most importantly, its high theoretical specific capacity. However, the practical application of Si-based anodes is mainly hindered by the low intrinsic conductivity of Si and the large volume change upon lithiation/de-lithiation. In order to improve the electrochemical performance of Si-based anodes, we prepared a composite material consisting of Si nanoparticles (NPs) and coconut silk bio-carbon (CSC) skeleton. The porous carbon skeleton derived from coconut silk with natural through-holes and ample micropores on the wall, which was used as the carrier of Si NPs. The continuous through-holes and well-distributed oxygen-containing functional groups of the CSC provided sufficient space and abundant adsorption active sites for Si NPs, what&#8216;s more, the good dispersion of Si NPs in the through-holes increased their contact with the surrounding carbon materials, which was conducive to electron transport. Meanwhile, the pore structure also provided buffer space for the volume expansion of Si.

Although the synthesis of the magnesium derivative is complicated by THF ring opening, the calcium reagent is a viable source of the triphenylgermanide nucleophile.







Abstract
The dimeric calcium and magnesium hydrides, [(BDI)AeH]2 [BDI=HC{(Me)CNDipp}2, Dipp=2,6&#8208;i&#8208;Pr2C6H3; Ae=Mg or Ca] do not react with Ph3GeH in non&#8208;coordinating solvent. Addition of THF, however, induces deprotonation and access to monomeric Ae&#8208;germanide complexes, [(BDI)Ae{GePh3}(THF)], both of which have been structurally characterized. Although this process is facile when Ae=Ca, the analogous magnesium&#8208;based reaction requires heating to temperatures &gt;100&#8201;&#176;C, under which conditions germanide formation is complicated by THF ring opening and the generation of an alkaline earth germyl&#8208;C&#8208;terminated n&#8208;butoxide, [(BDI)Mg{&#956;2&#8208;O(CH2)4GePh3}]. Reactions of [(BDI)Ca{GePh3}(THF)] with N,N&#8242;&#8208;di&#8208;isopropylcarbodiimide and benzophenone provide the respective germylamidinate and germylalkoxide derivatives, [(BDI)Ca{(i&#8208;PrN)2CGePh3}(THF)] and [(BDI)Ca{OC(GePh3)Ph2}(THF)], demonstrating its potential as a well&#8208;defined and soluble source of the [Ph3Ge]&#8722; anion in nucleophilic addition reactions.

         <title>Design and Synthesis of Thioglycosylated Monolignol Dual Probes for Bioimaging of Lignin Biosynthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present the design, synthesis, and application of thioglycosylated monolignol probes, functionalized for bioorthogonal labeling, to study lignin biosynthesis in plant cell walls. By incorporating stable sulfur&#8208;linked glycosides with clickable tags, we enable precise in&#8197;situ visualization of lignin through confocal fluorescence microscopy. Our results highlight unique insights into the spatial dynamics and roles of monolignol glucosides in lignification.







Abstract
Lignin biosynthesis is a critical process that underpins plant structural integrity and defenses. Central to this pathway are monolignol glucosides (MLGs), whose role as intermediates remains debated. To elucidate MLGs&#8217; involvement, we developed thioglycosylated monolignol probes compatible with click chemistry for in&#8197;situ visualization of lignin biosynthesis. Using a highly selective Buchwald&#8211;Hartwig&#8211;Migita cross&#8208;coupling approach, these probes incorporate glycosyl thiols into MLGs, creating stable thioacetal bonds to enhance both metabolic stability and tracking precision. The unique chemistry of these probes allows for incorporation within the lignification pathway, enabling specific visualization of MLG involvement in lignin formation. The probes are compatible with bioorthogonal chemistry labeling and confocal microscopy, allowing detailed tracking of MLG transport, storage, and incorporation into cell walls. Our findings provide new insights into lignification dynamics, underscoring the metabolic roles of MLGs and demonstrating their potential as metabolic intermediates in lignin polymerization. This approach offers a novel chemical biology toolset to dissect plant cell wall biosynthesis and will help elucidatethe molecular roles of MLGs in the context of plant biochemistry and resilience.

         <title>IPLOT&#8208;VKA: An Integral&#8208;Method Powell&#8208;pLOT&#8208;Enhanced Visual Kinetic Analysis for the Determination of Orders of Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Methods for the determination of partial orders of reaction have been surveyed and expanded. A free online application named IPLOT&#8208;VKA, after Integral&#8208;method Powell&#8208;pLOT&#8208;enhanced&#8208;Visual Kinetic Analysis, has been developed to speed up the determination of partial orders of reaction in chemical kinetics. Applications to classical teaching experiments and current literature in catalysis are reported.







Abstract
Determination of partial orders of reactions in kinetics is a general entry step for any mechanistic investigation; recently, considerable attention has been given to the benefits of using visual methods to help in this task, such as easy utilization and data&#8208;efficiency. In this respect, we here revisit and improve the classic method by Powell and Margerison for kinetic analysis. For the first time, analytical equations for a bimolecular reaction have been worked out for all values of partial orders of reactions, and the solutions have been implemented in a free, open&#8208;access and easy&#8208;to&#8208;use Web&#8208;application, named IPLOT&#8208;VKA, which also allows estimation of the errors on the kinetic constant, and residual standard error on concentrations. Several examples, taken from reference teaching experiences and from recent literature in catalysis show the efficacy and accuracy of our approach, which also has the advantage of requiring less experimental runs than other visual methods currently available.

         <title>Near&#8208;Quantitative Removal of Oxalate and Terephthalate from Water by Precipitation with a Rigid Bis&#8208;Amidinium Compound</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple precipitant removes oxalate and terephthalate from water and shows remarkable selectivity over other anions including halides, other polycarboxylates and sulfate. Once oxalate/terephthalate has been removed from water, the precipitant can be regenerated easily and effectively for subsequent re&#8208;use.







Abstract
A simple, readily&#8208;prepared precipitant (1&#8901;Cl2) precipitates oxalate or terephthalate from water with very high efficacy, removing these anions at sub&#8208;millimolar concentrations using only one equivalent of precipitant. A simple aqueous base/acid cycle can be used to regenerate 1&#8901;Cl2 after use. The resulting precipitates, 1&#8901;oxalate and 1&#8901;terephthalate, are anhydrous and closely&#8208;packed, with each anion receiving eight charge&#8208;assisted hydrogen bonds from amidinium N&#8722;H donors. Precipitation of oxalate and terephthalate occurs at much lower concentrations than other dicarboxylates, and direct competition experiments with the biologically/environmentally relevant divalent anions CO32&#8722;, HPO42&#8722; and SO42&#8722; reveal very high selectivity for oxalate or terephthalate over these competitors.

         <title>Hydridostannylene Derivatives of Magnesium and Calcium</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reactions of [(2,6&#8208;Dipp2C6H3)Sn(&#956;&#8208;H)]2 (Dipp=2,6&#8208;i&#8208;Pr2C6H3) with [(BDI)AeH]2 (BDI=HC{(Me)CNDipp}2; Ae=Mg, Ca) provide heterobimetallic bis&#8208;&#956;2&#8208;hydrido species, [[(BDI)Ae&#8208;&#956;&#8208;(H)2&#8208;Sn(C6H3&#8208;2,6&#8208;Dipp2)]. Although both compounds react with hex&#8208;1&#8208;ene to provide alkaline earth derivatives of tetravalent organostannides, the magnesium reagent promotes twofold addition of the alkene whereas the calcium&#8208;based reaction is arrested after a single hydrostannylation event.







Abstract
Reactions of a m&#8208;terphenylhydridostannylene with &#946;&#8208;diketiminato magnesium and calcium hydrides provide bis&#8208;&#956;2&#8208;hydrido species, the heterobimetallic constitutions of which are maintained after the addition of THF donor solvent. In both cases, reactions with hex&#8208;1&#8208;ene result in the formation of tetravalent organostannyl alkaline earth derivatives. Whereas the magnesium reagent undergoes facile twofold addition, the calcium&#8208;centered process is arrested after a single alkene reduction event. This contrasting behavior is assessed to result from the heavier alkaline earth element's ability to form a persistent polyhapto interaction with an arene substituent of the m&#8208;terphenyl ligand.

&lt;p&gt;Reactions of a &lt;i&gt;m&lt;/i&gt;-terphenylhydridostannylene with &#946;-diketiminato magnesium and calcium hydrides provide bis-&#956;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-hydrido species, the heterobimetallic constitutions of which are maintained after the addition of THF donor solvent. In both cases, reactions with hex-1-ene result in the formation of tetravalent organostannyl alkaline earth derivatives. Whereas the magnesium reagent undergoes facile twofold addition, the calcium-centered process is arrested after a single alkene reduction event. This contrasting behavior is assessed to result from the heavier alkaline earth element's ability to form a persistent polyhapto interaction with an arene substituent of the m-terphenyl ligand.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Photolockable Polyaromatic Capsule Designed via Regiochemical Substitution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new bent amphiphile featuring two 2&#8208;substituted anthracene panels, designed via the regiochemical substitution of a previous bent amphiphile with 9&#8208;substituted panels, quantitatively assembles into a well&#8208;defined polyaromatic capsule in water with improved host ability. Upon short light irradiation, the capsule and its host&#8208;guest composites undergo efficient intermolecular [4+4] photo&#8208;oligomerization in water, without release of the bound guests.







Abstract
Photocontrol over host frameworks is an elegant way to manipulate host&#8208;guest composites, yet the majority of previous systems suffer from long irradiation time and narrow guest scope, and are restricted to intramolecular photoreactions in organic solvents. Herein we present a photolockable polyaromatic capsule with high guest binding abilities in water. The capsule assembles from bent amphiphiles featuring two 2&#8208;subsutituted anthracene panels, which shows high stability against dilution and undergoes intermolecular [4+4] photo&#8208;oligomerization upon short light irradiation (&lt;10&#8197;min). The photolocked capsule provides a roughly spherical framework, with an average, core diameter of ~3&#8197;nm, composed of amphiphilic oligomers (e.&#8201;g., trimer). The new capsule shows improved host ability (up to 10&#8208;fold) in water toward various hydrophobic compounds (e.&#8201;g., organic and metal&#8208;complex dyes), as compared with an analogous, non&#8208;photolockable capsule with 9&#8208;subsutituted anthracene panels. In addition, the resultant dye&#8208;loaded capsules are also successfully photolocked via short irradiation with high retention of the bound dyes.

         <title>One&#8208;Step Hydrothermal Synthesis of Glucose&#8208;Induced Low Crystallinity NiCo&#8208;Based Layered Double Hydroxides for High&#8208;Performance Asymmetric Supercapacitors</title>

Supercapacitor electrodes: Glucose induced NiCo&#8208;based layered double hydroxides (NiCoLDH) to produce excellent electrode structure, thereby improving the electrochemical performance of supercapacitor.







Abstract
In order to improve the electrochemical performance of NiCo&#8208;based layered double hydroxide (NiCoLDH), the synthesis of low&#8208;crystallinity NiCoLDH was induced by the adsorption of glucose and NiCoLDH. The results showed that glucose could not only effectively regulate the pore structure and morphology of NiCoLDH, but also had a regular effect on crystallinity. Pure phase NiCoLDH had higher crystallinity. When the mass of glucose is 0.05&#8197;g, the prepared NiCoLDH&#8208;0.05 is a short&#8208;range ordered structure embedded in the amorphous matrix. The crystallinity of the product decreases further with the further increase of glucose mass. Since the ordered structures have higher electrical conductivity, and amorphous structures have more defects and active sites, the structure of NiCoLDH&#8208;0.05 is conducive to achieving the best electrochemical performance. Electrochemical test results show that NiCoLDH&#8208;0.05 has a high specific capacitance, about 12 times that of the pure phase NiCoLDH, the mass of glucose is higher than or below 0.05&#8197;g, the specific capacitance will be further reduced. NiCoLDH&#8208;0.05 and activated carbon assembled into an asymmetric supercapacitor have a power density of 400&#8197;W&#8201;kg&#8722;1 at an energy density of 32.7&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1. This study provides a new idea for obtaining excellent electrochemical properties by adjusting LDH crystallinity.

         <title>An Ion Pair Receptor for Selective Solid&#8208;Liquid Extraction of LiCl</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ion pair receptor composed of a functionalized calix[4]arene and a calix[4]pyrrole unit extracts lithium chloride with high selectivity from a solid mixture of alkali metal chloride salts and releases it upon contact with water.







Abstract
We have synthesized a new ion pair receptor (2) consisting of a cone&#8208;calix[4]arene bearing a combination of ethyl esters and ethers as a cation binding site and a calix[4]pyrrole subunit acting as an anion binding site. Ion pair receptor 2 complexes LiCl, NaCl, and CsCl among alkali metal chloride salts with distinct complexation modes and affinities in 10&#8201;% methanol&#8208;d4 in chloroform&#8208;d. For instance, relatively small Li+ and Na+ cations are bound to the oxygen atoms of the functionalized calix[4]arene lower rim with Cl&#8722; being hydrogen bonded to the calix[4]pyrrole NHs while the larger Cs+ cation is bound to the cone&#8208;shaped calix[4]pyrrole cavity via a &#960;&#8208;cation interaction. By contrast, in the co&#8208;presence of all MCl salts (M=Li, Na, K, Rb, and Cs), receptor 2 binds LiCl with complete selectivity. Besides, receptor 2 is capable of extracting LiCl selectively into a chloroform or a dichloromethane organic phase from its solid source containing all other MCl salts.

         <title>Enabling High&#8208;Performance Multi&#8208;Resonant TADF Emitters via Intramolecular Hydrogen Bond</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Green OLED based on BN&#8208;2Pm demonstrates EQEmax of 36.5% with CIE coordinates of (0.18, 0.71), while device employing BN&#8208;5Pm as emitting layer exhibits EQEmax of 14.6% with CIE coordinates of (0.12, 0.57). The magic difference in luminescence between the two isomers lies in the presence of intramolecular hydrogen bond.







Abstract
Hydrogen bonds (HBs), prevalent strong interactions in organic compounds, can effectively constrain single bond rotation, leading to rigid planar configurations. This rigidity enhances emission efficiency and narrows the emission spectrum of luminescent materials. Recent advances have leveraged HBs to advance high&#8208;performance donor&#8208;acceptor thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) materials. However, their application in multi&#8208;resonance (MR) TADF emitters remains limited. We herein developed MR&#8208;TADF emitters incorporating intramolecular hydrogen bonds (IHBs) with pyrimidine as the HB acceptor. The rigid planar conformation induced by IHBs significantly improved photoluminescence quantum yield, extended emission wavelength, reduced full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximum, and decreased non&#8208;radiative decay rates for BN&#8208;2Pm compared to BN&#8208;5Pm. Devices based on BN&#8208;2Pm achieved a maximum external quantum efficiency of 36.5&#8201;%, a current efficiency of 102.3&#8197;cd&#8201;A&#8722;1, a power efficiency of 84.6&#8197;lm&#8201;W&#8722;1, and Commission Internationale de l&#8217;&#201;clairage (CIE) coordinates of (0.18, 0.71). In contrast, BN&#8208;5Pm exhibited lower values: 14.6&#8201;%, 36.8&#8197;cd&#8201;A&#8722;1, 27.6&#8197;lm&#8201;W&#8722;1, and (0.12, 0.57), respectively.

Trapping transient Staudinger&#8208;type intermediates. The reaction of five&#8208;membered biradicaloids with azides (e.&#8201;g.&#160;Dipp&#8208;N3) leads to a variety of reaction pathways. Staudinger&#8208;type intermediates can be isolated directly from the reaction mixture (without loss of N2) if specific time or temperature control is applied. SCXRD, low&#8208;temperature NMR studies and calculations help to understand under which conditions addition or Staudinger type reaction takes place.







Abstract
The Staudinger reaction provides chemists with a valuable tool for the reduction of azides, which are notoriously unstable and can decompose explosively. By providing a controlled method for the conversion of azides to amines, the reaction opened up new avenues for the synthesis of various amine&#8208;containing compounds that are widely used in natural products, pharmaceuticals and polymers. The Staudinger reaction begins with the nucleophilic attack of a trivalent phosphine (usually triphenylphosphine), leading to the formation of a triazenide intermediate, a highly reactive species. Here we report how a divalent phosphorus&#8208;centered biradicaloid reacts with covalent azides and show that it is possible to capture and fully characterize the transient intermediate. The experimental data is supported by quantum chemical calculations of the reaction paths and in terms of thermodynamics and chemical bonding.

         <title>Cyclodextrin&#8208;Encapsulated NHCs: Increased Selectivity and Reactivity of CO2 in Amine Formylation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The confinement of a N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene (NHC) in cyclodextrins (CDs) allows the organocatalytic formylation of amines. The presence of a cavity enables substrate&#8208;selectivity, based on the steric bulk around the amine, without any loss of reactivity.







Abstract
Herein, we describe the confinement of a N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene (NHC) organocatalyst in the cavity of cyclodextrins (CDs). These confined organocatalysts allow the formylation of amines through CO2 hydrosilylation. The presence of the cavity of the CDs leads to substrate&#8208;selectivity between amines in competition reactions. The use of the smallest &#945;&#8208;CD induces the best selectivities but also increased reactivity compared to the bigger &#946;&#8208;CD. A careful study conducted by NMR and DFT revealed that in &#945;&#8208;CD, the complexed CO2 interacts with the cavity through hydrogen bonds. These H&#8208;bonds destabilize the NHC&#8211;CO2 adduct and are accountable for the higher reactivity observed using &#945;&#8208;CD.

This study demonstrates how the coordination conformation of a tris&#8208;amine molecule built on a central benzene frame changes when multimetallated by a different set of alkali metals







Abstract
Literature on Group One organoelement chemistry is dominated by lithium, though sodium and potassium also feature prominently, whereas rubidium and caesium are rarely mentioned. With recent breakthroughs hinting that organoelement compounds of these two heavier metals can perform better than their lighter congeners in particular applications, important advantages could be missed unless complete sets of alkali metals are included in studies. Here, we report the synthesis and characterisation of a complete set of multi&#8208;alkali&#8208;metallated molecular compounds of the 1,3,5&#8208;tris[(4,6&#8208;dimethylpyridin&#8208;2&#8208;yl)aminomethyl]&#8208;2,4,6&#8208;triethylbenzene framework. Made by deprotonating the framework N&#8722;H bonds by a suitable base, the set comprises six THF&#8208;solvated compounds, four of which are homometallic, either containing Li in a trinuclear structure or Na, K, and Rb in hexanuclear structures. Since deprotonation was incomplete with Cs, its homometallic compound is tetranuclear containing two un&#8208;metallated N&#8722;H bonds. A heterobimetallic trilithium&#8208;tricaesium hexanuclear compound was also obtained by using a bimetallic Li&#8722;Cs base for deprotonation. Such alkali&#8208;metallated frameworks are often precursors to other multimetallic frameworks with unique properties across different fields of science.

We developed, for the first time, reusable, efficient ligand&#8208;free iron&#8208;copper catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling reaction involving a variety of aryl, heteroaryl halides (including chlorides, bromides, and iodides), and alkyl bromides with diverse aryl and aliphatic primary amides, conducted under solvent&#8208;minimized conditions. This economically competitive protocol offered the corresponding cross&#8208;coupling products, N&#8208;arylamides and N&#8208;alkylamides, in good to excellent yields with broad substrate scope (65 examples) and tolerance to several sensitive functionalities. A series of experiments, XPS, UV, CV, EPR, XRD, and radical clock experiments were performed to investigate the reaction mechanism. Furthermore, the in&#8208;vitro. study of synthesized products 3&#8201;ii, 3&#8201;xii, and 3&#8201;xxxx exhibited promising antibacterial and anticancer activities (MTT and Molecular Docking).

         <title>Morphological Evolution of Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks into Hedrite, Sheaf and Spherulite Superstructures with Localized Different Coloration</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The hyperbranched metal&#8208;organic superstructures reported here exhibit diverse morphologies, including hedrites, sheafs, and spherulites. These structures are formed via non&#8208;crystallographic branching, which represents a distinct growth mechanism typically observed in many materials and is being reported for the first time in metal&#8208;organic frameworks.







Abstract
The branched metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) are the first superstructures of this kind, and the growth mechanism may explain crystal shapes of other materials. The mechanism of the formation of fascinating structures having a hedrite, sheaf or spherulite appearance are detailed. The branching can be controlled, resulting in crystals that either exhibit multiple generations of branching or a single generation. These structures might result from an increasing number of defects on fast&#8208;grown rods. As the basal facets become less reactive, material is added to the prism facets, leading to secondary nucleation and triangular branches. These triangular structures are connected to the rod surface, growing longer than the central rod. Electron diffraction analyses show that the sheafs are polycrystalline structures with their fantails consisting of single&#8208;crystalline nanorods deviating gradually from each other in their orientation. The crystallographic structure consists of channels with opposite handedness. The accessibility of the nanochannels and the porosity of the superstructures are demonstrated by chromophore diffusion into the channels. The confinement and alignment of the chromophores inside the channels resulted in polarized&#8208;light dependent coloration of the crystals; the polycrystallinity generated areas having different optical properties.

         <title>Exploring Benzothieno[3,2&#8208;b]benzothiophene S&#8208;Oxides for Organic Electronics, Fluorescence&#8208;Based Applications, and Asymmetric Synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A series of benzothieno[3,2&#8208;b]benzothiophene&#160;S&#8208;oxides has been efficiently synthesized via one&#8208; or two&#8208;step selective oxidation of benzothieno[3,2&#8208;b]benzothiophene (BTBT). These BTBT&#160;S&#8208;oxides form highly ordered structures that display optical anisotropy, are thermally stable up to temperatures above 210 oC, and do not show phase transitions. They exhibit long excited state lifetimes (0.181&#8211;0.869 ms) and are more resistant to oxidative degradation than their parent unoxidized BTBT. Some of these compounds demonstrate high quantum yields, exceeding 98% in solution and 71% in the solid state. As evidenced by quantum&#8208;chemical calculations, BTBT&#8208;based sulfoxides have sufficiently high pyramidal inversion energy barriers that prevent their stereomutation at room temperature. Additionally, fully S&#8208;oxidized BTBT meets the energy&#8208;splitting criterion required for the singlet fission process, with the T1 energy level that makes it suitable for device application.</dc:description>

         <title>Sn(IV) Complexes of 5,10,15,20&#8208;Tetraaryl&#8208;5,15&#8208;diazaporphyrinoids: A Promising Platform for Evaluating the 20&#960;&#8208;Electron Antiaromaticity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Porphyrinoids in the 20&#960;&#8208;electron state have been extensively studied from the fundamental viewpoint of investigating their structure&#8211;antiaromaticity relationships. However, most of the 20&#960; porphyrinoids are highly distorted and unstable in air, which hinder the comprehensive analysis of paratropic ring&#8208;current effects derived from planar &#960;&#8208;electron systems. Herein, we present the first examples of antiaromatic Sn(IV) complexes of 5,10,15,20&#8208;tetraaryl&#8208;5,15&#8208;diazaporphyrinoids (SnX2TADAPs), prepared by the complexation of the corresponding freebases with Sn(II) chloride under aerobic conditions and subsequent metathesis of the axial ligands, that show paratropic ring&#8208;current effects. Notably, both neutral 20&#960;&#8208;electron derivatives and 19&#960;&#8208;electron radical cations of SnX2TADAP are extremely stable in air owing to the intrinsic electronic effects of the central Sn(IV) unit and meso nitrogen atoms. NMR spectroscopy, cyclic voltammetry, and density functional theory calculations were performed to assess the ring&#8208;current effects and orbital energies of a series of the 20&#960;&#8208;electron SnX2TADAPs, and the results reveal that the paratropic ring&#8208;current effects arising from the planar 20&#960;&#8208;electron DAP ring increases with a decrease in the HOMO&#8211;LUMO energy gap.</dc:description>

         <title>Solution Processable Se&#8208;annulated Swallow Tail Perylene Bisimide Exhibiting

Room Temperature Columnar Phase and Efficient

Ambipolar Charge Carrier Mobility</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This study presents a selenium&#8208;annulated perylene bisimide (PBI&#8208;SeST) stabilizing room temperature columnar hexagonal phase with exceptionally low clearing temperature. The synthesis of this Se&#8208;annulated PBI (PBI&#8208;SeST) was accomplished using the reductive Cadogan cyclization method, with the introduction of swallow tails to reduce the clearing temperature and improve solubility. In addition, the charge carrier mobility of the Se&#8208;bay annulated PBI is assessed by space charge limited current (SCLC) technique and juxtaposed with PBI as well as nitrogen and sulphur&#8208;bay&#8208;annulated PBIs. It is noteworthy that all these PBIs exhibited ambipolar charge carrier mobility, a characteristic that diverges from the prevailing literature where predominantly electron transport behavior was observed for PBIs. This distinguishes them as an exclusive category of solution&#8208;processable, self&#8208;assembling organic semiconductors.</dc:description>

         <title>Systematic Investigations of the Solid Solution Zr(V1&#8208;xAlx)2 Adopting the Laves Phase Structures</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Laves phases are an interesting field of research when it comes to structural chemistry and physical properties. Investigations of the ternary system Zr&#8211;V&#8211;Al showed, in contrast to the system Hf&#8211;V&#8211;Al, that no superstructures can be observed within the solid solution Zr(V1&#8211;xAlx)2. High values of x form aluminum rich phases that adopt the hexagonal MgZn2 type structure while low values of x lead to vanadium rich phases that adopt the cubic MgCu2 type. All samples were investigated by powder X&#8208;ray diffraction experiments. Single crystal studies indicated that no superstructure formation is present in the investigated samples. 27Al MAS NMR investigations confirmed these findings. For ZrAl2, quantum&#8208;chemical calculations helped with the analysis of the 27Al NMR spectrum of the binary endmember of the solid solution. Some of the prepared samples were investigated with respect to their magnetic properties. The investigated compounds show Pauli&#8208;paramagnetism, in Zr(V0.875Al0.125)2 in addition superconductivity with a critical temperature of TC = 4.17(1) K was observed. Investigations of compositions that do not belong to the Laves phase regime clearly indicate that the MgZn2 type structure is still the dominant phase. Regardless of the starting composition chosen, the hexagonal Laves phase was mostly present.</dc:description>

         <title>Sulfonatocalix[4]arene&#8208;Based Scavengers for V&#8208;Type Nerve Agents with Enhanced Detoxification Activity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Synthetic small molecule scavengers that rapidly detoxify nerve agents&#160;in vivo&#160;allow (pre)treatment of nerve agent poisoning. However, scavengers that detoxify persistent V&#8208;type nerve agents at pH 7.4 and 37 &#176;C with sufficient efficiency are still unknown. The most promising compound to date is a monosubstituted sulfonatocalix[4]arene containing a hydroxamic acid group. This compound was used to investigate the effect of structural modifications on detoxification activity. While none of the monosubstituted calixarene derivatives considered in this context possessed higher activity than the parent compound, the disubstituted derivatives were very active, exhibiting half&#8208;lives of detoxification under the conditions of an established&#160;in vitro&#160;assay of &lt;1.5 min. The rate of detoxification decreased with decreasing scavenger concentration, but even at a fourfold molar excess of the scavenger, complete detoxification of 2.5 &#956;M&#160;solutions of some nerve agents could be achieved within one hour. These disubstituted calixarene derivatives thus bring synthetic scavengers for V&#8208;type nerve agents closer to application.</dc:description>

         <title>Guest diffusion versus recrystallization in a single crystal: two growing mechanisms for griseofulvin clathrates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Griseofulvin represents a rare case of a close&#8208;packed organic apohost that can clathrate selected volatile guests in a solid&#8208;gas fashion. Inclusion mechanisms and solvent exchange were investigated by a combination of single crystal and powder X&#8208;ray diffraction, coupled to optical microscopy and thermal analyses. In particular, gas diffusion and dissolution/recrystallization are alternatively observed, depending on the host polymorph, as well as the chemical nature of the guest and its physical state.</dc:description>

         <title>Reductive Aromatization of 5,7,12,14 Pentacenetetrone: Approach Towards Substituted Pentacenes?</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein we report a convenient access to asymmetrically substituted, well soluble pentacene derivatives synthesized from commercially available 5,7,12,14 pentacenetetrone via reductive one step functionalization. Zinc or potassium are used as reducing agents and the reduced intermediates are trapped with electrophiles such as acetyl, triisopropylsilyl or cationic methyl synthons. The reduction allows for an unsymmetric functionalization whilst one dione moiety is maintained due to partial reduction. The resulting dyes are characterized by UV/ Vis and photoluminescence spectroscopy. Their redox potentials are studied by cyclic voltammetry. The experimentally determined molecular frontier orbital energies are rationalized by density functional theory. The spatial molecular packing motive in the solid state is studied as a function of the substituent size by X ray crystallography. Attempts of reducing the second quinone moiety towards a functionalized pentacene led to an over reduced 6,13&#8208;dihydropentacene derivative, which by means of an XRD structural analysis surprisingly displays a planar molecular conformation and unique optoelectronic properties.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An indirect HAT&#8208;mediated photocatalytic protocol is developed, using a cerium salt (CeCl3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;7H2O) and a chlorine source (TBACl) as the catalytic system. A variety of cyclic and linear hydrocarbons are utilized, delivering the corresponding alkenylation or alkynylation products in good to high yields, displaying high regioselectivity under 390 nm irradiation.







Abstract
The reemerging field of photoredox catalysis offers numerous advantages towards the development of novel, sustainable and easy&#8208;to&#8208;execute organic transformations. Herein, we report a light&#8208;triggered application of cerium complexes towards the C&#8722;H alkenylation and alkynylation of alkanes. An indirect HAT&#8208;mediated photocatalytic protocol was developed, using a cerium salt (CeCl3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;7H2O) and a chlorine source (TBACl) as the catalytic system. A variety of cyclic and linear hydrocarbons were utilized, delivering the corresponding alkenylation or alkynylation products in good to high yields, displaying high regioselectivity. A series of mechanistic experiments were conducted.

         <title>Economically Scalable Cu&#8208;based MOFs: Vital Role of Structural Integrity towards Selectivity on Azeotropic Ethanol Dehydration</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A scalable production of Cu&#8208;triazole MOF through a facile and economical route is demonstrated. Providing hydrophilic pores with open&#8208;metal Cu&#8208;sites, the framework is highly selective to water adsorption from an azeotropic mixture of water&#8208;ethanol. Furthermore, the enhanced framework's crystallinity is a key to success in the improved performance of liquid&#8208;phase ethanol dehydration.







Abstract
A facile, green, and economical method for the scalable synthesis of hydrophilic copper&#8208;triazole metal&#8208;organic frameworks (Cu&#8208;trz) is demonstrated. Numerous open metal sites within the highly crystalline porous structure of Cu&#8208;trz are generated through mild thermal activation, enabling its application in liquid&#8208;phase ethanol dehydration under ambient conditions. The frameworks with distinct crystallinity and particle sizes were achieved by modifying the synthesis process. The high crystallinity of the framework plays an exclusive role in enhancing water adsorption capacity. With selective water adsorption comparable to commercial zeolite 3&#8197;A, Cu&#8208;trz MOF emerges as a promising candidate for cost&#8208;effective water&#8208;ethanol separation.

         <title>Pd/Cu Catalyzed Asymmetric Allylation for Stereodivergent Synthesis of Glutamic Acid Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A synergistic Pd/Cu catalyst system has been developed for stereodivergent transformation of Morita&#8208;Baylis&#8208;Hillman (MBH) carbonates and Schiff bases derived from simple amino acids to afford a series of optically active &#946;&#8208;branched &#947;&#8208;methyleneglutamic acid derivatives with adjacent tertiary/tertiary and quaternary/tertiary stereocenters in high yields (up to 96%) with excellent diastereo&#8208; and enantioselectivities (&gt;20/1 dr and &gt;99% ee in most cases) under mild conditions. The use of SKP ligand is disclosed to be crucial for the success of the transformation, and in particular allowing the reaction to proceed at low catalyst loading (0.02 mol% for Pd and 0.08 mol% for Cu). The high efficiency of the catalysis was attributed to the formation of intimate ion pair complex A1, composed of Pd&#8208;phosphonium cation and a t&#8208;butoxide anion, which would facilitate the subsequent deprotonation and C&#8208;C coupling events. All four stereoisomers of the &#946;&#8208;branched glutamic acid derivatives were readily prepared by permutation of the catalyst enantiomers. Synthetic utility of the methodology was exemplified by efficient synthesis of a fused pyrrolooxazolidinone with three contiguous chiral centers, highlighting the power of synergistic Pd/Cu catalysis for asymmetric allylic alkylation with MBH carbonates.</dc:description>

Herein, this paper systematically discusses the basic theories of solid&#8208;state sodium&#8208;ion batteries, including working principles and characteristics, electrode materials and components, and solid electrolytes. Then, focusing on solid electrolytes, the key scientific challenges faced by solid&#8208;state sodium&#8208;ion batteries were systematically discussed, and the application of interface modification in enhancing solid&#8208;state electrolytes was reviewed.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we report a copper&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective formal (3+3) and (3+2) cycloaddition reaction of isatin&#8208;derived tertiary propargylic esters with N,N&#8208;dimethylbarbituric acid and 4&#8208;hydroxycoumarins, respectively. In this process, the tertiary propargylic ester serves as both C3&#8208; and C2&#8208;synthons, facilitating the synthesis of optically&#160;active spirooxindole&#8208;pyran and furan scaffolds featuring an all&#8208;carbon quaternary stereocenter. The reaction delivers these spirocyclic frameworks in good yields with high enantioselectivities. Additionally, the scalability of both the reactions and the transformation of chiral intermediates into valuable structures emphasize the synthetic and practical importance of this strategy.</dc:description>

         <title>Bioinspired Synthesis of (&#8211;)&#8208;Hunterine A: Deciphering the Key Step in the Biogenetic Pathway</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A concise, bioinspired, and enantioselective synthesis of (&#8211;)&#8208;hunterine A, an odd 6/7/6/6/5 pentacyclic natural product, is described. The key step in the synthesis of this complex structure is an interim&#8208;template directed 6&#8208;exo selective epoxide ring&#8208;opening reaction, which is interwoven with a hydrolysis step of the indolenine hemiaminal template to create the unusual 7&#8208;membered azepine bridge motif. Our work not only refines the previously proposed biogenetic pathway, but also reveals the possible stereochemical prerequisite of the unique skeletal rearrangement, which provides a vantage point for understanding how (&#8211;)&#8208;hunterine A is likely to be generated in nature.</dc:description>

         <title>Active Site Engineering of a Glycerol Dehydrogenase Improves its Oxidative Activity and Scope Toward Glycerol Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Regioselective oxidation of glyceryl alkyl ethers is of utmost importance for the fabrication of substituted hydroxy ketones and enantiopure 1,2&#8208;diols as green solvents and pharmaceutical building blocks, respectively. An engineered glycerol dehydrogenase from Bacillus stearothermophilus was described to perform the regioselective oxidation of alkyl glycerol ethers, identifying position 252 as key for accepting larger substrates than glycerol. In this work, we further engineer that position through partial saturation mutagenesis to broaden the substrate scope toward other glycerol derivatives, improving enzyme kinetics and minimizing product inhibition. In particular, the BsGlyDH&#8208;L252S variant becomes the most efficient biocatalyst for the deracemization of alkyl glyceryl ethers in a two&#8208;step, one&#8208;pot system. The discovery and use of these alternative mutants of GlyDH opens the road to more applications and increases the enzymatic toolbox for the modifications of glyceryl ethers.</dc:description>

         <title>A Water Channel&#8208;like Structure Self&#8208;Assembled by Nucleosides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
1D water channels are valued for their selectivity and transport efficiency, but developing such channels from small molecules is challenging due to dipolar water tuning difficulty. This study explored C8 modifications of 2&#8208;amino&#8208;2&#8217;&#8208;fluoro&#8208;2&#8217;&#8208;deoxyadenosine (2FA), leading to a derivative that forms an S&#8208;shaped tetramer channel with water&#8208;wire arrays, providing insights into creating novel nucleoside&#8208;based water channels







Abstract
As artificial water channels have received widespread attention, various types of artificial water channels have been reported. However, apart from I&#8208;quartet channels, the development of 1D water channels with water wires constructed from small molecules has rarely been reported, because of the difficulty in precisely tuning the dipolar water molecules. Inspired by G&#8208;quartet functionalization strategies, this study explored C8 modifications of our previously reported molecule, 2&#8208;amino&#8208;2&#8217;&#8208;fluoro&#8208;2&#8217;&#8208;deoxyadenosine (2FA), known for its strong hydration properties and self&#8208;assembly capabilities, and investigated its potential for constructing nucleoside&#8208;based water channel&#8208;like structures. Among all derivatives, 2&#8208;amino&#8208;8&#8208;(4&#8208;aminophenyl)&#8208;2&#8217;&#8208;deoxy&#8208;2&#8217;&#8208;fluoro&#8208;D&#8208;adenosine can form an S&#8208;shaped channel as a tetramer, incorporating water wire arrays in the solid state. Such water channel&#8208;like structures in nucleoside self&#8208;assemblies provide new insights into the development of novel nucleoside&#8208;based supramolecular water channel materials.

         <title>Mushroom&#8208;Mediated Redox Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mushroom is a rich source of enzymes and therefore is a promising biocatalyst for organic synthesis. This review highlights key advances in mushroom&#8208;mediated redox reactions using whole cells, purified enzymes or recombinant enzymes, including the reduction of carbonyl compounds and carboxylic acids, oxidation of C&#8722;H bonds, epoxidation of olefins and oxidative cleavage of alkenes.







Abstract
The application of biocatalysts in organic synthesis has grown significantly in recent years, and both academia and industry are continuously searching for novel biocatalysts capable of performing challenging chemical reactions. Mushrooms are a rich source of ligninolytic and secondary metabolite biosynthetic enzymes, and therefore were considered promising biocatalysts for organic synthesis. This review focuses on the broad utilization potential of mushroom&#8208;based biocatalysts and highlights key advances in mushroom&#8208;mediated redox reactions. It mainly includes the reduction of ketones and carboxylic acids, hydroxylation of aromatic and aliphatic compounds, epoxidation of olefins, oxidative cleavage of alkenes, and other uncommon reactions catalyzed by the whole cells or purified enzymes of mushroom origin. Overall, a comprehensive overview of the applications of mushrooms as biocatalysts in organic synthesis is provided, which puts this versatile microorganism in the spotlight of further research.

         <title>Emission&#8208;Tunable B&#8592;N Lewis Pair&#8208;Functionalized Naphthalenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three structurally distinct double B&#8592;N Lewis pair&#8208;functionalized naphthalenes were synthesized via a one&#8208;pot method that involved sequential electrophilic borylation and in situ functionalization. The borylation position and substituents on the boron atoms significantly affect the structure and optoelectronic properties, enabling tunable fluorescence from cyan to red (509&#8211;620&#8197;nm) and reducing the LUMO energy level to &#8722;3.12&#8197;eV.







Abstract
Herein, we simultaneously synthesized three different double B&#8592;N Lewis pair&#8208;functionalized naphthalenes including the asymmetric BNNY and BNNO and the mirror&#8208;symmetric BNNR, via a one&#8208;pot method. The annulation modes of the B&#8592;N Lewis pairs and the substituents on the boron atoms efficiently tune the molecular frontier orbitals and emission colors. &#945;&#8208;Position fusion leads to a significant enhancement of the HOMO energy level and a decrease in the HOMO&#8208;LUMO gap, while the electron&#8208;withdrawing groups attached to the boron atom make the LUMO energy level more stable. In particular, the LUMO energy level of BNNO is as low as &#8722;3.12&#8197;eV. BNNY, BNNO, and BNNR emit cyan, green, and red fluorescence at 509, 534, and 620&#8197;nm, respectively, with fluorescence quantum yields of 24&#8201;%, 49&#8201;%, and 30&#8201;%, respectively.

         <title>Catalytic Activity of Cellulose&#8208;Supported Platinum and Palladium Nanoparticles for Allylbenzene Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Platinum or palladium nanoparticles were immobilized on cellulose using a colloidal deposition method and their catalytic performance for the hydrogenation of allylbenzene was investigated. Compared to the commercial catalyst, the activities are higher, while the stability of the catalysts immobilized on cellulose was better for the platinum nanoparticles.







Abstract
Platinum and palladium nanoparticles were successfully deposited on tunicate cellulose via the photodeposition or microemulsion deposition method. Evenly distributed, small and narrow&#8208;sized particles in the range of 2&#8211;3&#8197;nm were obtained for microemulsion&#8208;prepared cellulose catalysts. The photodeposition method led to larger particle sizes, broader size distribution, and occasional agglomerations. The catalysts were tested in the allylbenzene hydrogenation reaction at room temperature and the results were compared to commercially available catalysts. Because of smaller particles, both microemulsion&#8208;prepared catalysts and photodeposited ones show better activity than commercial catalysts. Even platinum and palladium nanoparticles were active for the hydrogenation, only cellulose&#8208;supported platinum nanoparticles showed good stability. For palladium nanoparticles, stronger leaching from the surface of cellulose was observed. Cellulose&#8208;supported catalysts were recycled, and reusability is comparable to commercial catalysts. Therefore, cellulose could be used as an alternative catalyst support.

Therefore, cellulose could be used as an alternative catalyst support.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Deciphering Co(III)&#8208;Catalyzed Oxidative C&#8722;H/C&#8722;H Annulation Towards Maleimide&#8208;Fused Imidazopyridine AEEgens</title>

A sustainable Co(III)&#8208;catalyzed dual C(sp2)&#8722;H/C(sp2)&#8722;H annulation of 2&#8208;aryl imidazopyridines with N&#8208;substituted maleimides has established. The synthesized molecule displayed AEE and solvatochromic behavior and can also be utilized as a cellular imaging and picric acid sensing probe.







Abstract
A cobalt(III)&#8208;catalyzed dual C(sp2)&#8722;H/C(sp2)&#8722;H activation of 2&#8208;arylimidazopyridines and its annulation with N&#8208;substituted maleimides leads to polycyclic aromatic heterocycles. This sustainable oxidative annulation uses earth&#8208;abundant, less toxic, and cost&#8208;effective cobalt(III) catalyst that complement expensive 2nd and 3rd&#8208;row metals. This oxidative annulation features a broad substrate scope with very good functional group tolerance. These maleimide&#8208;fused imidazopyridines display strong fluorescence in the region of 527&#8722; 536&#8197;nm with a Stokes shift of 83&#8722;87&#8197;nm and possess an excited state lifetime of 14.6&#8722;16.1 ns. Interestingly, such luminescent compounds show aggregation&#8208;enhanced emission (AEE) behavior in the iPr&#8208;OH/hexane mixed solvent system. Furthermore, field emission scanning microscopy (FESEM) reveals their spherical nano&#8208;aggregates with an average diameter of ~216.8&#8197;nm. They can also be used as cellular&#8208;imaging and picric acid&#8208;sensing probes.

         <title>Tandem Electroreduction of CO2 to C2+ Products Based on M&#8208;SACs/Cu Catalysts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The tandem strategy demonstrates efficient electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 to produce C2+ products. M&#8208;SACs/Cu&#8208;based tandem electrocatalysts have garnered significant interest owing to the high activity and selectivity of single atoms, along with their high conversion rates of CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO. In this paper, we present a comprehensive review focusing on the structure&#8208;activity relationship and design principle of M&#8208;SACs/Cu&#8208;based tandem catalysts in ECO2RR.







Abstract
Electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (ECO2RR) is considered a highly promising method to produce high&#8208;value chemicals and fuels, contributing significantly the artificial carbon balance. Plenty catalysts can facilitate the conversion of CO2 into mono&#8208;carbon (C1) products. Among these catalysts, Cu species exhibit a distinct role in the formation of multi&#8208;carbon (C2+) products characterized by enhanced energy density. However, the limited selectivity of C2+ products, along with the inferior stability, and high overpotential demonstrated by single&#8208;component Cu catalysts, hinders their applicability in industrial&#8208;scale production. The implementation of a tandem strategy, which involves coupling the CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO pathway using Ag, Au, metal single&#8208;atom catalysts (M&#8208;SACs), etc., with the CO&#8208;to&#8208;C2+ conversion on Cu, represents a novel approach for the efficient generation of C2+ products. Given the high cost and restricted availability of noble metals, M&#8208;SACs have attracted substantial interest in tandem systems due to their cost&#8208;effectiveness and efficient atom utilization. The systematic analysis of the design principles and structure&#8208;activity relationship is essential for the advancement of M&#8208;SACs/Cu&#8208;based tandem catalysts. Here we first introduce various prevalent design strategies of M&#8208;SACs/Cu&#8208;based tandem catalysts for ECO2RR and then systematically summarize the latest advancements of M&#8208;SACs/Cu&#8208;based tandem system, encompassing metal&#8208;organic frameworks/Cu (MOFs/Cu), covalent organic frameworks/Cu (COFs/Cu), and nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon support transition metal single atomic materials/Cu (M&#8722;N&#8722;C/Cu). Lastly, we discuss the challenges and opportunities with the design and construction of M&#8208;SACs/Cu&#8208;based tandem catalysis for ECO2RR.

         <title>Ordered Assembly of Natural Phenolic Building Blocks for Supramolecular Crystalline Materials</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Concept article provides a concise overview of recent advancements in crystalline materials constructed from natural phenolic building blocks. The discussion covers typical ordered assemblies such as frameworks and mesocrystals, highlighting their respective chemical mechanisms. Finally, the Concept outlines persistent challenges in this field and suggests potential directions for future development.







Abstract
Biomacromolecules such as DNA, proteins, and lipids in nature are constructed by &#8216;bottom&#8208;up&#8217; assembly with diverse functions and structural ordered characteristics. Supramolecular assemblies have been employed to mimic the natural complexity by manipulating the subtle variations of functional groups. Nevertheless, the intricate design of the driving forces or sophisticated synthesis of molecular skeletons poses challenges in fabricating highly ordered assemblies. Natural phenolic molecules with anisotropic functional groups exhibit potential as versatile building blocks for a wide range of supramolecular crystalline materials with tailored assembly and controlled functionalities. The inherent and anisotropic phenolic groups engage in ordered assembly with various materials via directional covalent bonds (e.&#8201;g., condensation and coordination) as well as multiple molecular interactions (e.&#8201;g., hydrogen bonding and &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions), leading to the formation of supramolecular crystalline materials with diverse functionalities. This Concept presents the assembly mechanisms of crystalline phenolic materials and their applications, showcasing the effective utilization of ordered assembly by natural phenolic building blocks.

         <title>Synthesis of Thiazolidinedione&#8208; and Triazole&#8208;Linked Organoselenocyanates and Evaluation of Anticancer Activities Against Breast Cancer with Mechanistic Investigations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The thiazolidinedione&#8208; and triazole&#8208;linked organoselenocyanates were rationally designed and synthesized as potential anticancer agents for the treatment of triple&#8208;negative breast cancer. The preliminary studies identified the unsubstituted benzylic analogue of thiazolidinedione&#8208;based organoselenocyanate 15&#8201;a as the lead compound. The compound exhibited the anticancer activity by arresting cells in G1&#8208;phase of the cell cycle with the downregulation of CDK4 and Cyclin D1 and via ERK/Akt signaling pathway.







Abstract
Organoselenocyanates are important classes of organoselenium compounds having potential pharmaceutical applications in cancer biology. In the present study, two different series of organoselenocyanates (15&#8201;a&#8211;15&#8201;c and 16&#8201;a&#8211;16&#8201;c) incorporating crucial heterocyclic pharmacophores such as 2,4&#8208;thiazolidine&#8208;1,3&#8208;dione and 1,2,3&#8208;triazole were rationally designed. The organoselenocyanates were synthesized using multi&#8208;step organic synthesis and investigated for their anticancer activities against triple&#8208;negative breast cancer cells. Based on the preliminary anti&#8208;proliferative activities and the selectivity index towards cancer cells over the normal cells, 2,4&#8208;thiazolidine&#8208;1,3&#8208;dione&#8208;based selenocyanate 15&#8201;a was identified as the lead analogue for detailed investigations. In addition to the anti&#8208;migratory activity, compound 15&#8201;a induced G1&#8208;phase arrest of the cell cycle and led to early apoptosis. Further studies on the redox balance of MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;231 cells indicated the antioxidant nature of 15&#8201;a with the quenching of ROS level and upregulation of TrxR1 expression. Detailed mechanistic investigations with the expression levels of key&#8208;cancer marker proteins revealed that the selenocyanate 15&#8201;a induced the activation of ERK pathway by upregulating p&#8208;ERK expression with the subsequent downregulation of p&#8208;Akt and c&#8208;Myc levels leading to the inhibition of cellular proliferation. Therefore, the primary outcomes of the study would be valuable in the development of chemotherapeutic agents towards the treatment of triple&#8208;negative breast cancer.

         <title>Enantiopure Macrocycles Based on Tr&#246;ger&#8216;s Base and Diphenyl Maleimide Exhibiting Strong Chiral Emission and Host&#8208;Guest Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two pairs of enantiomeric macrocycles are synthesized via Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura [2+2] cyclization, using Tr&#246;ger&#8242;s base and diphenyl maleimide as building blocks. These macrocycles display strong fluorescence with near&#8208;unity quantum yields. The chiral Tr&#246;ger&#8242;s base units confer excellent circularly polarized luminescence and well&#8208;defined cavities for efficient guest encapsulation..







Abstract
While a plenty of macrocyclic hosts have been developed in supramolecular chemistry, those that combine chiral luminescent properties and host&#8208;guest recognition abilities are still uncommon. Herein, two pairs of enantiomeric macrocycles were synthesized via Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura [2+2] cyclization reactions using Tr&#246;ger's base and diphenyl maleimide as the building blocks. The diphenyl maleimide units impart these macrocycles with highly strong fluorescence, achieving quantum yields up to 100&#8201;% in apolar solvents. Furthermore, the chiral, V&#8208;shaped Tr&#246;ger's base units provide the macrocycles with circularly polarized luminescence (|glum|=1.68&#215;10&#8722;3) and well&#8208;define cavity for hosting electron&#8208;deficient or positively charged guests with Ka up to 1.7&#215;106&#8197;M&#8722;1.

         <title>Development of a Synthetic Platform for Ent&#8208;Pimaranes Reveals their Potential as Novel Non&#8208;redox Active Ferroptosis Inhibitors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We present a comprehensive account on the evolution of a synthetic platform for a subfamily of ent&#8208;pimaranes. For the most complex member, norflickinflimiod C, five distinct strategies relying on either cationic or radical polyene cyclizations to construct the requisite tricyclic carbon scaffold were explored. Insights from early and late stage oxidative and reductive dearomatization studies ultimately led to a mild, rhodium&#8208;catalyzed arene hydrogenation for the final synthetic route. A Sharpless asymmetric dihydroxylation was found to be suitable to render the platform enantioselective and diversification of a late&#8208;stage key intermediate culminated in the total synthesis of eight ent&#8208;pimaranes in 11&#8211;16 steps.&#160; These compounds were found to inhibit the formation of pro&#8208;inflammatory leukotrienes and other 5&#8208;lipoxygenase products. Notably, three ent&#8208;pimaranes exhibited low micromolar, non&#8208;redox active ferroptosis inhibition with remarkable structural specificity.</dc:description>

         <title>Structures, Chiroptical Properties, and Unexpectedly Facile Helical Inversion of Highly Elongated Anthracene&#8208;Fused Expanded Helicenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Helical fused anthracenes were elongated by fusing additional aromatic units at both ends to yield novel expanded helicenes. Compounds [5]HA2N and [7]HA consisting of 19 and 21 benzene rings, respectively, were synthesized by fourfold cycloisomerization of the corresponding terminal alkyne precursors. The helical structures were confirmed by X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis, where the aromatic frameworks stacked effectively with the helical turn numbers exceeding two. The enantiomers of the two compounds were resolved by chiral HPLC. Whereas [5]HA2N readily underwent enantiomerization at room temperature at the barrier to enantiomerization of 91 kJ mol&#8211;1, the barrier was enhanced to 99 kJ mol&#8211;1 for the long analog [7]HA. The enantiomers of [7]HA exhibited strong responses in the circular dichroism (CD) and circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) spectra, as scaled by dissymmetry factors |gabs| = 0.034 and |glum| = 0.012. Theoretical calculations by the r2SCAN&#8208;3c method suggested stepwise mechanisms for the enantiomerization via helical inversion with acceptable barrier heights. The unexpectedly flexible nature of the aromatic frameworks of [5]HA2N and [7]HA was discussed on the basis of the proposed mechanism.</dc:description>

         <title>The Chemical Recovery of PMMA into Monomer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA), commonly known as plexiglass, is widely used in the areas of aircraft, automobile, construction and transplants, due to its high mechanical strength, good corrosion resistance, and excellent compatibility with human tissue. With the increase in production and usage of PMMA, the vast accumulation of PMMA waste has posed a challenge to the recycling of PMMA waste. However, at present, only less than 10% of PMMA is recycled each year. The cost&#8208;effective chemical recovery of PMMA into monomer with high efficiency has attracted wide attention and has become one of the hot research subjects. The chemical recovery of PMMA into monomer are realized mainly via two approaches, including the pyrolysis of common PMMA at high temperature and the depolymerization of end&#8208;functionalized PMMA under mild conditions. The second approach has emerged and achieved significant progresses in the past several years. Herein, we provide a review about the researches of chemical recovery of PMMA into monomer. Firstly, the pyrolysis of general PMMA at high temperature is illustrated by typical research works. Subsequently, the depolymerization of end&#8208;functionalized PMMA under mild conditions is highlighted and discussed, as this approach is more in line with the green and sustainable development of polymer chemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>Experimental and Theoretical Insights on Gas Trapping of Noble Gases in MFU&#8208;4&#8208;Type Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks</title>

Isostructural metal&#8211;organic frameworks, MFU&#8208;4 and MFU&#8208;4&#8208;Br, with anionic side ligands (Cl&#8722; and Br&#8722;), were synthesized for noble gas storage. Selecting the side ligand type fine&#8208;tuned the pore aperture size, effectively controlling gas entry and release. Experiments with krypton and xenon were complemented by computational modeling.







Abstract
Isostructural metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs), namely MFU&#8208;4 and MFU&#8208;4&#8208;Br, in which the pore apertures are defined by anionic side ligands (Cl&#8722; and Br&#8722;, respectively), were synthesized and loaded with noble gases. By selecting the type of side ligand, one can fine&#8208;tune the pore aperture size, allowing for precise regulation of the entry and release of gas guests. In this study, we conducted experiments to examine gas loading and release using krypton and xenon as model gases, and we complemented our findings with computational modeling. Remarkably, the loaded gas guests remained trapped inside the pores even after being exposed to air under ambient conditions for extended periods, in some cases for up to several weeks. Therefore, we focused on determining the energy barrier preventing gas release using both theoretical and experimental methods. The results were compared in relation to the types of hosts and guests, providing valuable insights into the gas trapping process in MOFs, as well as programmed gas release in air under ambient conditions. Furthermore, the crystal structure of MFU&#8208;4&#8208;Br was elucidated using the three&#8208;dimensional electron diffraction (3DED) technique, and the bulk purity of the sample was subsequently verified through Rietveld refinement.

         <title>Double Strain&#8208;Release (3+3)&#8208;Cycloaddition: Lewis Acid Catalyzed Reaction of Bicyclobutane Carboxylates and Aziridines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a Sc(OTf)3&#8208;catalyzed cycloaddition of highly strained bicyclo[1.1.0]butane carboxylates with protected aziridines. In this transformation, highly functionalized 2&#8208;azabiyclo[3.1.1]heptanes are accessed in single step under mild conditions. This is an example of strain&#8208;release driven transformation, where two highly strained rings combine to form bicyclic moieties which can serve as potential bioisosteres.







Abstract
A (3+3)&#8208;cycloaddition to afford 2&#8208;azabiyclo[3.1.1]heptanes was realized by reacting highly strained aryl bicyclo[1.1.0]butane (BCBs) carboxylates with tosylated aziridines. Under Sc(OTf)3 catalysis the transformation proceeded smoothly under mild conditions to the corresponding bicyclic products bearing at the bridgeheads of the embedded four&#8208;membered ring aryl and ester moieties, respectively. This reaction is a rare example of a cycloaddition of two highly strained ring systems under Lewis acid catalysis. Mechanistic experiments provided insights into the reaction mechanism.

         <title>Scalable Production of Metal Oxide Nanoparticles for Optoelectronics Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The scaling&#8208;up process of a continuous injection protocol used to produce tin&#8208;doped indium oxide nanocrystal dispersions is described. Synthesis and processing were controlled with special attention to increasing synthesis yield and controlling product quality.







Abstract
This work describes the scalability process of a continuous&#8208;injection protocol employed to produce tin&#8208;doped indium oxide nanocrystal dispersions. Different levels of manipulation starting from the synthesis and processing also related to the tuning of the optical response (considering the peculiar combination of UV and NIR absorption with visible transparency) make these materials incredibly versatile. But one of the most attractive features concern the modulation of their charge carrier density through chemical or post&#8208;synthetic doping, as for the case of core&#8208;shell materials, expanding the properties of the core composition. In addition, the colloidal nature of such materials allows for easy solution processing which enables an extensive use in different applications within current thin films base technologies. It is therefore important to push forward the lab&#8208;scale synthesis to properly address the commercial fabrication requirements without any loss in quality. Uniformity is crucial for industrial applications, ensuring predictable performance and facilitating the integration of these nanoparticles into optoelectronic devices. The method here developed allowed a transition from mg&#8208;scale to gram&#8208;scale product mass outputs, while retaining stability in terms of particle size distribution, morphology, crystallinity, and optical properties. This research establishes a robust framework for the scalable production of metal oxide nanoparticles with consistent properties, enhancing their viability for widespread use in optoelectronic applications.

         <title>Unraveling the Mechanism of Stereospecific Self&#8208;Promoted N&#8208;Glycosylations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We take a look into the mechanism of glycosylation by an in&#8208;depth analysis of the mechanism of self&#8208;promoted N&#8208;glycosylation. Despite these glycosylation taking place without any additives, a complex mechanistic pathway is revealed through both kinetic experiments, computational studies, and competition experiments.







Abstract
In this study, the mechanism of self&#8208;promoted N&#8208;glycosylations is extensively investigated through kinetic experiments, computational studies, and nucleophilic competition experiments. Based on the findings, the mechanism is proposed to be initiated by proton transfer from the acidic sulfonyl carbamate to the trichloroacetimidate, upon formation of an associated contact ion pair. This ion pair then collapses in an SN1&#8208;like fashion, with formation of an oxocarbeniumion&#8208;like intermediate. According to the proposed mechanism, stereospecificity arises from the associated nature of all intermediates formed throughout the reaction. During the mechanistic study, it was also found that the sulfonyl carbamates have catalytic properties if a competing nucleophile is present.

         <title>Exploring Glycan&#8208;Lectin Interactions in Natural&#8208;Like Environments: A View Using NMR Experiments Inside Cell and on Cell Surface</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
NMR methods are applied to uncover molecular recognition events between synthetic glycan molecules and lectin receptors within the cell and on the cell surface. The interaction between 15&#8197;N&#8208;labelled human galectin&#8208;7 with thioglycoside is monitored within living Danio rerio oocytes using HMQC experiments, while the binding epitope of a sialoside ligand to human Siglec&#8208;10, at the surface of HEK293F cells, is unraveled by STD&#8208;NMR.







Abstract
Glycan&#8208;mediated molecular recognition events are essential for life. NMR is widely used to monitor glycan binding to lectins in solution using isolated glycans and lectins. In this context, we herein explore diverse NMR methodologies, from both the receptor and ligand perspectives, to monitor glycan&#8208;lectin interactions under experimental conditions mimicking the native milieu inside cells and on cell surface. For the NMR experiments inside cells, galectin&#8208;7 is employed as model, since most galectins are soluble and carry out their functions in the cellular micro&#8208;environment. Using Danio Rerio oocytes, the 1H&#8208;15N HMQC NMR spectrum of a folded galectin has been observed inside cell for the first time, using a glycomimetic ligand (TDG) to overcoming the natural tendency of galectins to bind to numerous galactose&#8208;containing receptors within cells. Alternatively, most lectins, other than galectins, are displayed on the cell surface, providing a multivalent presentation to bind their glycan partners in cis (at the same cell) or in trans (on other cells). In this case, ligand&#8208;based STD&#8208;NMR experiments have been successfully applied to account for the interactions of natural glycans and glycomimetics with Siglec&#8208;10. These methodologies provide the proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept to open the door to the NMR analysis of the recognition of glycans in native&#8208;like settings.

         <title>Role of Secondary Structure and Time&#8208;Dependent Binding on Disruption of Phthalocyanine Aggregates by Guanine&#8208;Rich Nucleic Acids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The binding of guanine&#8208;rich nucleic acids to a water&#8208;soluble cationic, regiopure zinc phthalocyanine (1) is reported. In contrast to double&#8208;stranded DNA, guanine systems GpG, (GpG)10, poly(G) and quadruplex DNA effectively disrupt phthalocyanine aggregates to disperse the monomeric state. Time&#8208;dependent binding is observed for all systems, especially poly(G). Such biomacromolecule interactions are expected to be important when rationalizing the photoactivity of phthalocyanines in&#8208;vivo.







Abstract
Phthalocyanines are versatile photodynamic therapy agents whose biological activity depends on their aggregation state, which is expected to be influenced by binding to biomolecules. Here, guanine&#8208;rich nucleic acid binding of a water&#8208;soluble cationic, regiopure C4h zinc phthalocyanine bearing four triethylene glycol methyl ether and four N&#8208;methyl&#8208;4&#8208;pyridinium substituents (1) is reported. In contrast to double&#8208;stranded DNA, guanine systems GpG, (GG)10, poly(G) and quadruplex DNA are shown to effectively disrupt phthalocyanine aggregates in buffered solution. This process is accompanied by evolution of the Q&#8208;band absorbance and enhanced emission. Increasing the sequence length from GpG to (GG)10 increases the binding and confirms the importance of multiple binding interactions. Enhanced binding in the presence of KCl suggests the importance of nucleobase hydrogen&#8208;bonded mosaics in phthalocyanine binding. Notably, the (GT)10 sequence is even more effective than quadruplex and pure guanine systems at disrupting the aggregates of 1. Significant time&#8208;dependent binding of 1 with poly(G) reveals biexponential binding over minutes and hours, which is linked to local conformations of poly(G) that accommodate monomers of 1 over time. The study highlights the ability of biomacromolecules to disrupt phthalocyanines aggregates over time, which is an important consideration when rationalizing photoactivity of photosensitizers in&#8208;vivo.

Significant time-dependent binding of &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; with &lt;b&gt;poly(G)&lt;/b&gt; reveals biexponential binding over minutes and hours, which is linked to local conformations of &lt;b&gt;poly(G)&lt;/b&gt; that accommodate monomers of &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; over time. The study highlights the ability of biomacromolecules to disrupt phthalocyanines aggregates over time, which is an important consideration when rationalizing photoactivity of photosensitizers in-vivo.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Synthesis of an Unsymmetrical Dialumane and Kinetic Analysis of its Alkene Insertion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unsymmetrical dialumane was synthesized by the reaction of a nucleophilic alumanyl anion with a bromoalumane and structurally characterized to show the existence of the Et2O&#8208;coordination to the Al atom. Its reactivity toward ethylene and styrene into the Al&#8722;Al bond was examined, and the resulting insertion products underwent subsequent reactions. The reaction of the dialumane with styrene was decelerated by the presence of additional Et2O, suggesting that an Et2O dissociation occurred before the alkene insertion, which can be distinguished from an associative mechanism involving a five&#8208;coordinated Al intermediate.

         <title>Aqueous Dispersion of Xenes by Liquid Phase Exfoliation of Monoelemental Crystals in Melamine Solution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bismouth, silicon, tellurium and tin powders are effectively exfoliated in water solution of melamine affording 2D nanostructures. These characteristic 2D Xenes are dispersed in water forming stable colloidal solutions.







Abstract
&#913;fter the impressive evolution of graphene and its derivatives, a large number of two dimensional (2D) materials with important optical and electrical properties have been successfully fabricated. Liquid phase exfoliation (LPE) of layered and non&#8208;layered materials has become a widely applied method for the preparation of 2D nanostructures with an extensive variety of applications. However, in most cases organic solvents are used as liquid phase which are often toxic and environmentally unfriendly and lead to low yields. In this work, we present water as a suitable liquid phase and dispersion medium for the exfoliation of layered and non&#8208;layered monoelemental solids from IVA, VA and VIA groups of the periodic table, such as silicon, tin, bismuth and tellurium. The 2D nanostructures, silicene, stanene, bismuthene and tellurene are therefore prepared by a completely sustainable and environmentally friendly method. The prepared Xenes, as they are called, are fully characterized by microscopic and spectroscopic techniques.

         <title>The Designs and Applications of Tetraphenylethylene Macrocycles and Cages</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Macrocycles and cages are very attractive for the development of functional materials due to their unique inner cavities. Building blocks with interesting functions and synthetic conveniences are especially attractive. Tetraphenylethylene (TPE) is such an entity with C2 symmetry and tetrakis&#8208;functional groups easily modifiable. As a typical aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) active compound, TPE perfectly unites the functions of fluorescence and structural building blocks together. The unique marriage of the two roles into one component makes TPE an ideal platform for the development of functional molecular systems including macrocycles and cages. The TPE macrocycles and cages are not merely a simple combination of those two but also generate added values unseen in either component alone. The fluorescence properties of TPE in macrocycles/cages are greatly improved or modulated, which makes them more suitable for various applications compared to their linear counterparts. In this review, the chemistry and design principles of TPE macrocycles/cages are surveyed first. The unique properties of those compounds are also discussed to provide general guidance for their functionalization. A brief discussion of their applications focusing on the utilization of their unique fluorescence is also presented. In the last, outlooks and future perspectives of TPE macrocycles/cages are provided for further developments.</dc:description>

         <title>Site&#8208;Specific Incorporation of Fluorinated Prolines into Proteins and their Impact on Neighbouring Residues</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The incorporation of fluorinated amino acids into proteins provides new opportunities to study biomolecular structure&#8208;function relationships in an elegant manner. The available strategies to incorporate the majority of fluorinated amino acids are not site&#8208;specific or imply important structural modifications. Here, we present a chemical biology approach for the site&#8208;specific incorporation of three commercially available C&#947;&#8208;modified fluoroprolines that has been validated using a non&#8208;pathogenic version of huntingtin exon&#8208;1 (HttExon&#8208;1). 19F, 1H and 15N NMR chemical shifts measured for multiple variants of HttExon&#8208;1 indicated that the trans/cis ratio was strongly dependent on the fluoroproline variant and the sequence context. By isotopically labelling the rest of the protein, we have shown that the extent of spectroscopic perturbations to the neighbouring residues depends on the number of fluorine atoms and the stereochemistry at C&#947;, as well as the isomeric form of the fluoroproline. We have rationalized these observations by means of extensive molecular dynamics simulations, indicating that the observed atomic chemical shift perturbations correlate with the distance to fluorine atoms and that the effect remains very local. These results validate the site&#8208;specific incorporation of fluoroprolines as an excellent strategy to monitor intra&#8208; and intermolecular interactions in disordered proline&#8208;rich proteins.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>In our effort to establish a direct synthetic approach for bis(dihydridoborate) complexes of first&#8208;row transition metals, we have investigated the reactivity of [Cp*Fe(dppe)Cl] (dppe = 1,2&#8208;bis(diphenylphosphino)ethane) with Na[BH3L] (L = 2&#8208;mercaptopyridine (mp) and 2&#8208;mercaptobenzothiazole (mbz)) that led to the formation of iron(II) dihydridoborate complexes, [Cp*Fe{&#954;3&#8208;S,H,H&#8208;(H2BH(L))}] 1a&#8208;b (L = mp (1a) and L = mbz (1b)). Further, in an attempt to isolate the bis(dihydridoborate) complex of iron by the insertion of borane into the &#954;2&#8208;N,S&#8208;chelated iron complex, [(dppe)Fe{&#954;2&#8208;N,S&#8208;(mp)}2] (2), we have isolated and structurally characterized a rare example of dimeric iron bis(dihydridoborate) complex, [Fe{&#954;3&#8208;S,H,H&#8208;(H2BH(mp))}2]2, &#923;&#916;/&#916;&#923;&#8208;3 as pair of enantiomers. Interestingly, these enantiomers &#923;&#916;/&#916;&#923;&#8208;3 have two trans&#8208;[Fe{&#954;3&#8208;S,H,H&#8208;(H2BH(mp))}2] moieties bridged through sulfur atoms of 2&#8208;mercaptopyridinyl ligands, where the iron centres are hepta&#8208;coordinated. The natural bond&#8208;orbital (NBO) analyses of &#923;&#916;&#8208;3 and &#916;&#923;&#8208;3 show considerable electron donation from the filled &#963;B&#8208;H bonding orbital to vacant&#160;dz2&#160;orbital of iron with a substantial contribution from the hydrogen atoms.

         <title>Silicon&#8208;based Linkers for Tunable Acid&#8208;Sensitive Drug Release from Polymeric Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (APIs) may benefit from a carrier to improve their pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties. Core&#8208;crosslinked polymeric micelles (CCPMs) are carriers for hydrophobic small molecule APIs. In CCPMs, APIs are generally covalently coupled to the core of the micelles by use of a linker, which can be tailored to adjust the release rate of the API. Acid triggered release is promising because of local acidic environment in the tissue of interest, and expected uptake via endocytosis. In the present study, silyl&#8208;based linkers were synthesized, and attached to gemcitabine as model API to investigate the tunability of release by introduction of different substituents. Attachment was achieved via an Si ether bond, with the linker coupled to the primary alcohol functionality on gemcitabine. By varying the substituents on the silyl atom, we could vary the release half&#8208;life (t1/2) of native gemcitabine from &lt;1 hour to &gt;96 hours at pH 5.0 at 37&#176;C, compared to a t1/2 of 24 to &gt;240 hours at pH 7.4 at 37&#176;C, respectively. The steric hinderance caused by substituents contributed to an increase of t1/2 at pH 5.0, as the largest substituents resulted in the slowest release. Extension to other APIs and other carriers is clearly possible.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Novel fused phenazines were synthesized through a combination of gold&#8208;catalyzed hydroamination and cascade cyclization reactions towards azaacenes. In total, 30 new compounds were synthesized and investigated with respect to their structural and optoelectronic properties. In solution, these targets exhibit strong green to red emission, with quantum yields of up to 60%. The emission wavelength can be finely adjusted by the choice of solvent due to their solvatochromic behavior, as demonstrated with a representative example.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Lewis acid&#8208;base adducts between potassium dihydrogenpnictogenides and group 13 Lewis acids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lewis acid&#8208;base adducts between potassium dihydrogenpnictogenides [K(18c6)PnH2] (Pn = P, As) and Trialkylgallanes (GaMe3, GaEt3, GatBu3) as well as BH3 were synthesized. In the course of these investigations, we were able to fully characterize a row of compounds of the type [K(18c6)(thf)0&#8209;2][PnH2(ER3)2] (E = B: R = H; E = Ga: R = Me, Et, tBu). Based on the successful syntheses of these species, we also synthesized several compounds of the composition [K(18c6)(thf)0&#8209;2][Pn(SiMe3)2(ER3)n] (n = 1, 2) starting from [KPn(SiMe3)2] (Pn = P and As) and ER3 (E = B, Al, In: R = Me; E = Ga: R= Me, Et, tBu). All isolated compounds, were examined by NMR spectroscopy, infra&#8208;red spectroscopy and elemental analysis. A selection of the compounds presented were also examined by means of X&#8208;ray structure analysis on the single crystal. The obtained adducts of negatively charged [PnH2]&#8722; and [Pn(SiMe3)2]&#8722; fragments with Lewis acids are a class of compounds that has scarcely been investigated to date.</dc:description>

         <title>Constructing AgO/Ag2O Electrocatalysts with Highly Exposed and Tightly Contacted Active Facets for Efficient Oxygen Evolution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of efficient electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and the elucidation of their underlying mechanisms are crucial for overcoming the low efficiency of hydrogen production through the electrolysis of water. Utilizing the electrochemical anodic oxidation method, a series of silver&#8208;based electrocatalysts (Ag&#8208;x, where x signifies the applied direct current (DC) voltage, x = 0, 5, 10, 15) were prepared employing metallic silver wire as the anode under DC voltages. The resulting silver&#8208;based electrodes have been oxidized and reconstructed, yielding AgO/Ag2O composite on the surface. Notably, the Ag&#8208;10 electrode exhibited the lowest overpotential (399 mV at 50 mA cm&#8722;2 and 456 mV at 100 mA cm&#8722;2), along with good stability. The superior OER performance of Ag&#8208;10 is not only attributed to the high exposure and tight interface of the AgO (&#8722;111) and Ag2O (111) crystal phases, as well as the higher prevalence of Ag&#8722;O&#8722;O&#8722;Ag species on its surface, but also its larger electrochemical active surface area (ECSA). This work provides insight for the synthesis of metal oxide&#8208;based electrocatalysts and understanding the electrocatalytic mechanism.</dc:description>

         <title>An Energy&#8208;Tunable Dual Emission Mechanism of the Hybridized Local and Charge Transfer (HLCT) and the Excited State Conjugation Enhancement (ESCE)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Molecular design of dual&#8208;fluorescent probes requires precise adjustment of the energy levels of two excited states and the energy barrier between them. While the hybridized local and charge&#8208;transfer (HLCT) state has been recently focused as an important excited state for high emission efficiency with a tunable energy level, a dual emission involving the HLCT state has been only achieved with the excited&#8208;state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT) system. Here, a series of dual&#8208;fluorescent molecules involving an HLCT excited state with the excited&#8208;state conjugation enhancement (ESCE) motif is presented as the first case. The energy level of the HLCT state has been adjusted by changing substituents and solvents, separately from the ESCE energy level. The HLCT&#8208;ESCE molecular design with tunable fluorescence properties proposes a new strategy for the development of advanced fluorescent probes.</dc:description>

         <title>Cucurbit[8]uril&#8208;stabilized charge transfer: An efficient supramolecular approach toward a heterogeneous organic photocatalyst for aerobic oxidation reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Host&#8208;stabilized charge transfer (HSCT) has been widely utilized in macrocycle&#8208;derived supramolecular assemblies and architectures. However, there has been less research attention focused on the direct fabrication of pure organic photocatalysts using HSCT. Herein, four viologen derivatives (m&#8208;PV2+, m&#8208;BPV2+, d&#8208;PV2+, and d&#8208;BPV2+) with different electron donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;A) structures were synthesized. Their host&#8208;guest complexes with cucurbit[8]uril (Q[8]) in an aqueous solution could be switched using the substituted electron donor moieties, in which the host&#8208;guest complexes of m&#8208;BPV2+@Q[8] andd&#8208;BPV2+@Q[8] exhibited HSCT interactions. Control experiments revealed that the d&#8208;BPV2+@Q[8] complex had the strongest ability to sensitize singlet oxygen (1O2). This was ascribed to the increased &#960;&#8208;conjugation of d&#8208;BPV2+@Q[8], which led to more effective HSCT upon encapsulation by the Q[8] host. Consequently, the d&#8208;BPV2+@Q[8] complex could be easily employed as a heterogeneous photocatalyst for the photooxidation reaction of thioether com&#8208;pounds with high selectivity. In particular, d&#8208;BPV2+@Q[8] was successfully applied to the synthesis of sulfoxide drugs, such as the con&#8208;version of inexpensive Iberverin ($7.0 per gram) to the expensive bioactive inhibitor Iberin ($19500.0 per gram) in high yield (94%).</dc:description>

         <title>Biotin Conjugated Fe(III)&#8208;Triscatecholate Complex as Tumour Targeting T1 MRI Contrast Agent via Second Sphere Water Relaxation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The biotin&#8208;conjugated Fe(III) catecholate complex [Fe(BioL)3]3&#8208;, Fe(BioL)3 (BioLH2 = N&#8208;(3,4&#8208;dihydroxyphenethyl)&#8208;5&#8208;((3aS,4S,6aR)&#8208;2&#8208;oxohexahydro&#8208;1H&#8208;thieno[3,4&#8208;d]imidazol&#8208;4&#8208;yl)pentanamide) is reported as targeted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) contrast agents (CAs) to increase the payload for early&#8208;stage imaging of tumours. The high spin state and octahedral coordination of the Fe(III) complex are confirmed by EPR spectra and DFT optimized structure, respectively. The formation constant (&#8208;log K) of Fe(BioL)3 is determined as 45, which is higher than the known, more stable complex [Fe(EDTA)]. The complex Fe(BioL)3 exhibited r1 relaxivity of 3.09 &#177; 0.10 and 1.95 &#177; 0.09 mM&#8208;1 s&#8208;1 at 25 &#176;C and 37 &#176;C, respectively, at 1.41T and pH 7.35 via second&#8208;sphere water interactions as due to the absence of inner water coordination. The interaction of Fe(BioL)3 with bovine serum albumin (BSA) and human serum albumin (HSA) displayed enhanced relaxivity of 5.16 &#177; 0.15 and 10.0 &#177; 0.19 mM&#8208;1s&#8208;1, respectively, at 25 &#176;C and pH 7.3 possibly via lengthening of rotational correlational time. The complex Fe(BioL)3 uptake studies with the avidin, a biotin&#8208;binding protein pocket, showed 46 and 37% enhancements of r1 and r2 relaxivities. Complex Fe(BioL)3 showed 80% cell viability of the human gastric adenocarcinoma (AGS) cells, and 89% of iron has been uptaken into cells.</dc:description>

         <title>Directly Fused Porphyrin&#8208;Tetracyanopentacenequinone Conjugates: Role of the Cross&#8208;Conjugated, Powerful Electron Acceptor in Promoting Highly Efficient Charge Separation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Tetracyanopentacenequinone, a powerful electron acceptor, is fused directly to the porphyrin &#960;&#8208;system to create a new class of donor&#8208;acceptor conjugates.&#160; Owing to the direct fusion and electron&#8208;deficient property of tetracyanopentacenequinone, strong intramolecular charge transfer both in the ground and excited states was witnessed.&#160; As a control, porphyrin fused with pentacenequinone was also investigated.&#160; Upon complete spectral and electrochemical characterization, the excited state properties were initially probed by time&#8208;dependent DFT studies, and the occurrence of electron transfer from different excited states was established.&#160; Free&#8208;energy calculations revealed higher exothermic electron transfer (&gt; 600 mV) than the control pentacenequinone&#8208;porphyrin systems.&#160; Pump&#8208;probe studies covering broad spatial and temporal regions revealed efficient excited state charge separation.&#160; This was unlike the control pentacenequinone&#8208;porphyrin system, where slow charge separation was witnessed only in the case of the zinc derivatives but not the free&#8208;base ones. &#160;The lifetimes of the charge&#8208;separated states ranged between 30&#8208;500 ps depending on the solvent and metal ion in the porphyrin cavity.&#160; The significance of cross&#8208;conjugated tetracyanopentacenequinone fused directly to the porphyrin &#960; system in promoting highly exothermic and efficient charge separation, irrespective of its cross conjugation, is borne out from this study.</dc:description>

         <title>Reusable Ni&#8208;immobilized MOF Catalyst for Dehydrogenation of N&#8208;heterocycles Under Milder Conditions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we have demonstrated the design and synthesis of a novel Ni&#8208;immobilized MOF as heterogeneous catalyst for the dehydrogenation of N&#8208;heterocycles. A series of five and six&#8208;member N&#8208;heteroarenes bearing one or more heteroatoms were synthesized in up to 98% yield (&gt; 33 examples). Late stage functionalization to the synthesis of b&#8208;glucuronides inhibitor, antimalarial drug quinine, and the nonsteroidal anti&#8208;inflammatory drug (NSAID) indomethacin were obtained under milder reactions conditions. A series of mechanistic studies revealed the detection of H2 and H2O2 during the progress of the reactions and suggested the involvement of enamine&#8208;imine intermediate species for sequential dehydrogenation. Detailed characterization of the fresh catalyst and reused catalyst were performed using SEM, TEM, BET, PXRD, and EDX elemental mappings. The catalyst could be recycled up to four&#8208;times without much loss in catalytic activities. In&#8208;situ formed defects, pore size enlargement and additional Lewis acid sites within catalyst nanocrystals assisted in attaining high activity and selectivity to N&#8208;heteroarenes.</dc:description>

         <title>Combination of phenylsilsesquioxane and acetate ligands as an approach to a record high nuclear Cu13Na2&#8208;cage. Synthesis, unique structure, and catalytic activity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Self&#8208;assembly synthesis of mixed&#8208;ligand (silsesquioxane/acetate) complex allows to isolate record high nuclear copper(II) Cu13&#8208;cage (1). In the presence of two additional sodium ions, a unique molecular architecture, with triple combination of ligands (cyclic and acyclic silsesquioxanes as well as acetates), has been formed. The structure was established by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction based on the use of synchrotron radiation. Complex 1 was evaluated as precatalyst in the Baeyer&#8208;Villiger oxidation of cyclohexanone towards &#949;&#8208;caprolactone, employing hydrogen peroxide, tert&#8208;butyl hydroperoxide (TBHP) or m&#8208;chloroperoxybenzoic acid (mCPBA) as oxidants, in an aqueous acidic acetonitrile medium. The direct formation of the lactone from cyclohexane via a tandem peroxidative oxidation/Baeyer&#8208;Villiger oxidation was also studied. For both substrates, the best results (&#949;&#8208;caprolactone yields up to 100% or 26%, from cyclohexanone or cyclohexane, respectively) were achieved with mCPBA under considerably mild conditions, i.e., conventional heating at 50 &#176;C for 4 h or microwave (MW) irradiation at 80 &#176;C for only 30 minutes.</dc:description>

         <title>Dehydrocoupling of Ammonia/Amine Boranes and Related Transformations Catalysed by Group 4 Metal Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ammonia boranes and amine boranes are main group analogues of alkanes, which are characterised by their large gravimetric hydrogen content. This hydrogen can be released in dehydrocoupling and dehydropolymerisation reactions to obtain B&#8208;N oligomers and polymers that are of importance as precursors for functional B&#8208;N materials. Furthermore, amine boranes are potent reagents for application in transfer hydrogenation reactions, representing a versatile, easy&#8208;to&#8208;handle alternative to the use of gaseous hydrogen for the reduction of organic compounds. Compared to late transition metals,&#160;complexes of readily available and comparatively inexpensive electropositive group 4 metals have been used to a much lesser extent. This review summarises the developments in the field of dehydrocoupling of amine boranes and transfer hydrogenation with these reagents, catalysed by complexes of group 4 metals. We analyse the background for these developments using examples and reaction mechanisms and provide an outlook for future developments in this field of research.</dc:description>

         <title>Higher Assemblies of Coordination Cage&#8208;Catenanes Linked by Copper(II) Chloride Clusters: Networks and Transformations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cage&#8208;catenanes are chemical constructs where two or more cage&#8208;like molecules or assemblies are mechanically interlocked together. We report a new class of cage&#8208;catenanes where dimeric metal&#8208;organic cage&#8208;catenanes are linked into larger assemblies through additional bridging metal chloride links. These crystalline materials are obtained from the reaction of tris(nicotinoyl)cyclotriguaiacylene (L1) with Cu(II) salts, and all feature a tetramer of cages where two {Cu3(L1)2(X)6} cages (X = anion) are mechanically interlocked, and link to each other and to another {Cu3(L1)2(X)6}2 cage&#8208;catenane through a planar, linear tetranuclear {Cu4(&#956;&#8722;Cl)6Cl2} cluster. The complex of discrete tetrameric {Cu3(L1)2(X)6}4 assemblies (dimers of cage&#8208;catenanes) transforms through solvent&#8208;exchange processes to 1D coordination chain structures through additional {Cu2(&#956;&#8722;Cl)2} bridges between the tetrameric {Cu3(L1)2(X)6}4 assemblies. Complex [Cu6(L1)4Cl12(H2O)3]&#183;(H2O)&#183;15(DMF) C2 features a 2D coordination network of 63 topology linked through three different Cu(II) clusters, namely {Cu4(&#956;&#8722;Cl)6}, {Cu2(&#956;&#8722;Cl)2} and a rare linear {Cu2(&#956;&#8208;Cl)} linkage. Break&#8208;down of C2 in water likely proceeds through hydrolysis of this unusual linear Cu&#8208;Cl&#8208;Cl bond.</dc:description>

The complex of discrete tetrameric {Cu3(L1)2(X)6}4 assemblies (dimers of cage-catenanes) transforms through solvent-exchange processes to 1D coordination chain structures through additional {Cu2(&#956;&#8722;Cl)2} bridges between the tetrameric {Cu3(L1)2(X)6}4 assemblies. Complex [Cu6(L1)4Cl12(H2O)3]&#183;(H2O)&#183;15(DMF) C2 features a 2D coordination network of 63 topology linked through three different Cu(II) clusters, namely {Cu4(&#956;&#8722;Cl)6}, {Cu2(&#956;&#8722;Cl)2} and a rare linear {Cu2(&#956;-Cl)} linkage. Break-down of C2 in water likely proceeds through hydrolysis of this unusual linear Cu-Cl-Cl bond.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Self&#8208;assembly of supramolecular double helix from a tetrapeptide and direct visualization by Scanning Tunneling Microscopy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This work reports single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD), Scanning Tunneling Microscopy (STM), and quantum mechanics calculations of the 310&#8208;helical peptide Z&#8208;(Aib)2&#8208;L&#8208;Dap(Boc)&#8208;Aib&#8208;NHiPr (Aib, &#945;&#8208;aminoisobutyric acid; Dap, 2,3&#8208;diaminopropionic acid; Z, benzyloxycarbonyl; Boc, t&#8208;butoxycarbonyl). The peptide forms a double&#8208;helical superstructure, studied by XRD and STM. Such architecture is rare in short peptides. Here, we show, by combining XRD, STM that this intriguing conformational feature is not driven by crystal packing; rather, it is an intrinsic property of this peptide. Indeed, the double helix is clearly detected also by STM, where crystal packing cannot be invoked. XRD reveals that intermolecular H&#8208;bonds stabilize two left&#8208;handed supra&#8208;helices (tertiary structure) that develop around a 6&#8208;fold screw axis. Then, two supra&#8208;helices are intertwined in a quaternary structure as a left&#8208;handed, double supra&#8208;helix, where C&#8211;H&#8943;&#960; interactions play a crucial role. STM images show the formation of long, isolated &#8220;necklaces&#8221; (&gt; 110 nm). They are of left and right helical handedness. Their size agrees with the XRD finding. DFT calculations allowed us to weigh the contribution of the different intermolecular interactions in the two single supra&#8208;helices and the supramolecular double&#8208;helix. Interestingly, we were able to conclude that the contribution of the C&#8208;H&#8943;&#960; interactions to the binding energies is close to 50%.</dc:description>

         <title>Nickel/Photoredox Catalyzed Aryl&#8208;Alkyl Cross&#8208;Coupling with Alkyl Boronic Esters as Radical Precursors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nickel/photoredox dual catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling of aryl halides with alkylboron compounds is one of the effective methodologies for the construction of C(sp2)&#8208;C(sp3) bonds. Although elegant results have been achieved by using alkyl trifluoroborates as alkyl radical precursors, the generation of alkyl radicals from readily available alkyl boronic esters is still limited due to their high oxidation potential. We disclosed here that activation of alkyl boronic esters by MeOLi is highly efficient for the generation of alkyl radicals under photocatalysis conditions. The reaction featured with a wide substrate scope, high functional group tolerance, and late&#8208;stage modification of bioactive substances. In addition, the method was also successfully extended to alkyl boronic acids. Experimental and computational mechanistic studies indicated that the cross&#8208;coupling likely proceeds via a Ni(I)&#8208;catalyzed pathway.</dc:description>

         <title>B(C6F5)3 Catalyzed Regiodivergent Thioetherifications of Alkenes via Thiiranium Intermediates: Experimental and Computational Insights</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Precise control of selective alkene functionalization is a continuing challenge in the chemical community. In this study, we develop a substitution&#8208;controlled regiodivergent thioetherification of di&#8208; or trisubstituted alkenes using 10 mol% tris(pentafluorophenyl)borane [B(C6F5)3] as a catalyst and N&#8211;thiosuccinimide as a sulfenylating reagent. This metal&#8208;free borane catalyzed C&#8211;S bond forming method is utilized for a Csp2&#8211;H sulfenylation reaction to synthesize an array of diphenylvinylsulfide derivatives with good to excellent yields (25 examples, up to 91% yield). Some of the products exhibit aggregation&#8208;induced emission luminogen properties used in organic light&#8211;emitting diodes (OLEDs), chemical sensors, and biological imaging units. Depending upon the starting alkene, Csp3&#8211;S sulfenylation products could also be generated regioselectively. A variety of allylic thioethers from &#945;&#8208;alkyl substituted styrenes were isolable in good yields and selectivities (14 examples, up to 67% yield). The DFT&#8208;supported mechanistic study confirms that the reaction proceeds via a thiiranium ion intermediate, where the regioselectivity and product formation are determined by the alkene substituents which influences the activation barriers and energy profiles. Diphenylvinylsulfide derivatives can also be efficiently transformed into a range of synthetically valuable compounds, including vinyl sulfoxides, vinyl sulfones, and vinyl sulfoximines.</dc:description>

         <title>Regioselective Dimerization of Methylcyclopentadiene inside Cucurbit[7]uril</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The molecular confinement within rigid macrocyclic receptors can trigger catalytic activity and steer the selectivity of organic reactions. In this work, the dimerization of methylcyclopentadiene (MCPD) isomers in the presence of cucurbit[7]uril (CB7) was found to display, besides a large rate acceleration, a striking regioselectivity in aqueous solution at pH 3, different from the thermodynamic products predominating in the absence of the supramolecular catalyst. Among the different possible regioisomers and diastereomers, the endo&#8208;3,7&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;3a,4,7,7a&#8208;tetrahydro&#8208;1H&#8208;4,7&#8208;methanoindene adduct was selectively formed, which is otherwise found only as a minor product in the dimerization of neat MCPD or in commercial dimeric mixtures. This product originates from the reaction of the heteroternary complex of 1&#8208;MCPD and 2&#8208;MCPD within CB7, in which the methyl groups are positioned in an "anti&#8208;diaxial" arrangement and point towards the open portals of the macrocycle, resulting in a preferred packing of the reacting cyclopentadiene rings. The selectivity of the dimerization of MCPD in the absence and presence of CB7 is supported by quantum&#8208;chemical calculations. Insert abstract text here.</dc:description>

         <title>Fine&#8208;tune the structural components of porous frameworks for photocatalytic hydrogen production</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>With the depletion of fossil fuels and increasing pollution problems, green and sustainable energy supply attracts worldwide attention. Hydrogen is a green and high&#8208;density energy substance, and photocatalytic hydrogen generation is an effective and sustainable method.&#160;Therefore, developing high&#8208;performance photocatalysts plays a crucial role in practical application. Porous frameworks with large surface areas and diversified structures are considered promising candidates for photocatalysts. This review summarizes the recent progress on porous frameworks and their derivatives through fine&#8208;tuning structural components in terms of building monomers, functional groups, and metal hybridization for photocatalytic production of hydrogen. A&#160;detailed correlation is conducted between the structural features of porous frameworks and photocatalysis capability. In addition, we summarized the advantages of porous materials for photocatalytic hydrogen production and future development.</dc:description>

         <title>Supramolecular Gels Derived from Primary Ammonium salts of Naproxen and its Amino Acid Derivatives: Design, Synthesis, Structures and its Application as Anti&#8208;cancer Agent Against Melanoma Cell B16&#8208;F10</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Supramolecular synthon approach was employed to develop a self&#8208;drug&#8208;delivery system based on organic salt based supramolecular gelators. One such key gelator NAP&#8208;PHE&#8729;PEA derived from naproxen&#8208;phenylalanine conjugate and phenethylamine showed ability to gel both water and organic solvents. Supramolecular interactions such as &#960;&#8208;&#960; and C&#8208;H&#8230;&#960; were probed by variable&#8208;temperature 1H&#8208;NMR spectroscopy in the hydrogelation process of NAP&#8208;PHE&#8729;PEA. Single crystal structures of nine out of twelve salts were determined and the supramolecular synthon present therein was carefully analyzed. Intriguing insights of the gel&#8208;network structure was also investigated by structure&#8208;property correlation based on single&#8208;crystal and powder X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis of gelator/nongelator salts. The gelator salt NAP&#8208;PHE&#8729;PEA displayed significant anti&#8208;cancer property against cancer cells (B16&#8208;F10. HeLa and A375); it was found non&#8208;cytotoxic against normal cell lines (E.derm and HEK&#8208;293) at comparable concentrations as revealed by MTT assays.

The methyl salicylate gel of NAP&#8208;PHE&#8729;PEA displayed shape&#8208;sustaining, load&#8208;bearing, self&#8208;healing properties along with rheoreversibility, which are considered important for topical applications.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Supramolecular synthon approach was employed to develop a self-drug-delivery system based on organic salt based supramolecular gelators. One such key gelator NAP-PHE&#8729;PEA derived from naproxen-phenylalanine conjugate and phenethylamine showed ability to gel both water and organic solvents. Supramolecular interactions such as &#960;-&#960; and C-H&#8230;&#960; were probed by variable-temperature 1H-NMR spectroscopy in the hydrogelation process of NAP-PHE&#8729;PEA. Single crystal structures of nine out of twelve salts were determined and the supramolecular synthon present therein was carefully analyzed. Intriguing insights of the gel-network structure was also investigated by structure-property correlation based on single-crystal and powder X-ray diffraction analysis of gelator/nongelator salts. The gelator salt NAP-PHE&#8729;PEA displayed significant anti-cancer property against cancer cells (B16-F10. HeLa and A375); it was found non-cytotoxic against normal cell lines (E.derm and HEK-293) at comparable concentrations as revealed by MTT assays. The gelator salt NAP-PHE&#8729;PEA also displayed significant anti-cancer behaviour against B16-F10 (scratch assay) and HeLa (multi-cellular tumour spheroid). The methyl salicylate gel of NAP-PHE&#8729;PEA displayed shape-sustaining, load-bearing, self-healing properties along with rheoreversibility, which are considered important for topical applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Base&#8208;free Synthesis of S&#8208;Alkyl Isothioureas Through Ring&#8208;opening Reaction of Sulfonium Salts with Isothiocyanates and Amines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A&#160;convenient and base&#8208;free&#160;three&#8208;component reaction has been developed for the synthesis of S&#8208;alkyl substituted&#160;isothioureas&#160;from cyclic sulfonium salts, isothiocyanates, and amines.

         <title>Highly selective cytokine induction of nitrated lipid&#8208;modified &#945;&#8208;GalCer derivatives demonstrating high binding affinity to the lipid antigen presenting molecule CD1d</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Glycolipid antigens are presented by CD1d on antigen&#8208;presenting cells to T cell receptors (TCRs) of natural killar (NK)T cells, leading to immune responses via cytokine induction. Although various lipid antigens have been found, there are only limited numbers of glycolipid antigens having selective cytokine induction. In this study, we identified the glycolipids (&#945;&#8208;GalCer nitro&#8208;type) that exhibits highly selective induction of Th2 and Th17 type cytokine, with very high binding affinity to CD1d, by introducing natural nitro&#8208;modified fatty acyl groups. The natural nitroalkene moiety of fatty acyl groups in the glycolipids effectively enhance the affinity to CD1d with presumed hydrogen&#8208;bonding and cation&#8211;&#960;&#160;interaction, leading to the distinctive function in cytokine induction and selectivity.</dc:description>

         <title>pH Controlled transient cyclization of peptides for increased stability towards oral delivery</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Peptides are highly efficient for treatment of many diseases, especially in oncology and diabetes. Oral delivery of peptides is desirable, but is challenged by low bioavailability and new chemical methods to enable oral delivery are needed. Here, we developed pH responsive linearization as a strategy for transient protection of peptides to extend their half&#8208;life in model systems. Peptides were cyclized to increase their stability at the low pH in the stomach, while they linearize at neutral pH to form the active peptide. We developed ester based responsive linkers with a protonable amine for O&#8208;to&#8208;N acyl shift, which allowed linearization strategies based on pyroglutamoyl (pGlu) or diketopiperazine (DKP) formation. After coupling of the linker, peptides were cyclized by CuAAC. We studied the stability against simulated gastric fluid (SGF) at different pH and the ability of cyclic peptides to linearize. This led to PYY3&#8208;36 analogues with pH responsive linearization for increased stability.</dc:description>

         <title>PCET&#8208;driven Reactivity of Neptunyl(VI) Yields Oxo&#8208;bridged Np(V) and Np(IV) Species</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two unconventional polynuclear complexes of neptunium(Np) featuring mono&#8208;&#956;2&#8208;oxo motifs have been accessed by proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET) reactivity involving the dissolution of neptunyl(VI) diacetate dihydrate (NpO2(OAc)2 (H2O)2&#8226;HOAc) in methanol followed by addition of a pentadentate Schiff&#8208;base ligand. One complex is a mixed&#8208;valent [NpV,NpIV,NpV] trimer with two bridging &#956;2&#8208;oxos and the other is a [NpV,NpV] dimer featuring a single &#956;2&#8208;oxo. In both complexes the outer Np centers are capped with terminal oxo ligands. Spectroscopic and spectrokinetic studies aimed at elucidating mechanistic details of complex formation in this system show that intermediate multinuclear [NpV O2(OAc)]n species form prior to metal chelation by the ligand; electrolysis experiments demonstrate that production of Np(V) gives rise to asynchronous proton transfer that does not occur otherwise (in the Np(VI) state) as well as condensation with loss of H2O and formation of the polynuclear complexes. We attribute the oxo&#8208;deficient nature of these products, with respect to conventional actinyl ([AnO2]m+) species, to the reduction/condensation reaction sequence of PCET.</dc:description>

         <title>Photogeneration and Direct Observation of a 2H&#8208;Phosphirene and a Closed&#8208;Shell Singlet Arylphosphenium Ion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Phosphenium ions are highly reactive species with the formula of RR`P+. Although phosphenium ions were proposed as the invaluable intermediates of various important chemical processes, the methods to generate and characterize them were very limited. In this study, a novel photoprecursor to give rise to the arylphosphenium ions, 1&#8208;(naphthalen&#8208;2&#8208;yl)phosphirane, was synthesized and investigated by femtosecond to nanosecond transient absorption spectroscopies, photoproduct analysis, and density functional theory calculations. Subsequent to photoexcitation, the S1&#160;state of the photoprecursor of interest is populated from the higher excited states, accompanied by the generation of an unexpected 2H&#8208;phosphirene, 7bH&#8208;naphtho[1,2&#8208;b]phosphirene. After that, the resulted 2H&#8208;phosphirene is protonated by H2O in the solvent to generate the naphthalen&#8208;2&#8208;yl(hydryl)phosphenium ion, which can be attacked by H2O and oxidized by O2&#160;to give naphthalen&#8208;2&#8208;ylphosphinic acid as the major final product. The presence of these transient species is confirmed by density functional theory calculation and control experiments with different solvents. This study provides an understanding of the reactivity of arylphosphenium ions as well as 2H&#8208;phosphirenes, and provides a novel method to generate and characterize these reactive species, which may help to further reveal their reactivity and explore their chemistry and use in a range of applications.</dc:description>
