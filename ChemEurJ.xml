         <title>Cage Match: Comparing the Anion Binding Ability of Isostructural Versus Isofunctional Pairs of Metal&#8208;Organic Nanocages</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three Pt&#8208;linked porphyrin nanocages were used to examine how the structure and functionality of hosts influence their anion binding ability. Two isostructural M6L312+ cages exhibit similar high affinities (&gt;107&#8197;M&#8722;1) for aryl carboxylates and sulfonates despite the hosts differing greatly in hydrogen&#8208;bonding ability. Proton&#8208;responsive behavior was used to toggle between binding the benzoate guests and a weaker binding perfluorooctanoate anion.







Abstract
Affinities of six anions (mesylate, acetate, trifluoroacetate, p&#8208;toluenecarboxylate, p&#8208;toluenesulfonate, and perfluorooctanoate) for three related Pt2+&#8208;linked porphyrin nanocages were measured to probe the influence of different noncovalent recognition motifs (e.&#8201;g., hydrogen bonding, electrostatics, &#960; bonding) on anion binding. Two new hosts of M6L312+ (1b) and M4L28+ (2) composition (M=(en)Pt2+, L=(3&#8208;py)4porphyrin) were prepared in a one&#8208;pot synthesis and allowed comparison of hosts that differ in structure while maintaining similar N&#8722;H hydrogen&#8208;bond donor ability. Comparisons of isostructural hosts that differ in hydrogen&#8208;bonding ability were made between 1b and a related M6L312+ nanoprism (1a, M=(tmeda)Pt2+) that lacks N&#8722;H groups. Considerable variation in association constants (K1=1.6&#215;103&#8197;M&#8722;1 to 1.3&#215;108&#8197;M&#8722;1) and binding mode (exo vs. endo) were found for different host&#8211;guest combinations. Strongest binding was seen between p&#8208;toluenecarboxylate and 1b, but surprisingly, association of this guest with 1a was only slightly weaker despite the absence of NH&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O interactions. The high affinity between p&#8208;toluenecarboxylate and 1a could be turned off by protonation, and this behavior was used to toggle between the binding of this guest and the environmental pollutant perfluorooctanoate, which otherwise has a lower affinity for the host.

         <title>Chemistry and Biology of Podophyllotoxins: An Update</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Podophyllotoxin is a natural product with interesting medicinal and agricultural values. Herein, new podophyllotoxin analogues with new skeletons isolated from plants are listed, as well as the total synthesis, structural modifications, biological activity and structure&#8211;activity relationships of podophyllotoxin and its derivatives. Hopefully, this review will serve as a reference for further research on podophyllotoxin and its derivatives.







Abstract
Podophyllotoxin is an aryltetralin lignan lactone derived from different plants of Podophyllum. It consists of five rings with four chiral centers, one trans&#8208;lactone and one aryl tetrahydronaphthalene skeleton with multiple modification sites. Moreover, podophyllotoxin and its derivatives showed lots of bioactivities, including anticancer, anti&#8208;inflammatory, antiviral, and insecticidal properties. The demand for podophyllotoxin and its derivatives is rising as a result of their high efficacy. As a continuation of our previous review (Chem. Eur. J., 2017, 23, 4467&#8211;4526), herein, total synthesis, biotransformation, structural modifications, bioactivities, and structure&#8211;activity relationships of podophyllotoxin and its derivatives from 2017 to 2022 are summarized. Meanwhile, a piece of update information on the origin of new podophyllotoxin analogues from plants from 2014 to 2022 was compiled. We hope that this review will provide a reference for future high value&#8211;added applications of podophyllotoxin and its analogues in the pharmaceutical and agricultural fields.

         <title>Prediction of Strong Solvatochromism in a Molecular Photocatalyst
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Solvatochromism denotes the dependence of the colour of a solution on the solvent. Based on quantum chemical calculations, we predict strong solvatochromism in a light&#8208;driven molecular photocatalyst for hydrogen evolution. Moreover, we find a solvent&#8208;dependent relocation of the highest occupied molecular orbital opening the way to deliberately modify the properties of photoactive complexes.







Abstract
Based on quantum chemical calculations, we predict strong solvatochromism in a light&#8208;driven molecular photocatalyst for hydrogen generation, that is we show that the electronic and optical properties of the photocatalyst strongly depend on the solvent it is dissolved in. Our calculations in particular indicate a solvent&#8208;dependent relocation of the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO). Ground&#8208;state density functional theory and linear response time&#8208;dependent density functional theory calculations were applied in order to investigate the influence of implicit solvents on the structural, electronic and optical properties of a molecular photocatalyst. Only at high dielectric constants of the solvent, is the HOMO located at the metal center of the photosensitizer, whereas at low dielectric constants the HOMO is centered at the metal atom of the catalytically active complex. We elucidate the electronic origins of this strong solvatochromic effect and sketch the consequences of these insights for the use of photocatalysts in different environments.

         <title>CoFe Alloys Dispersed on Se, N Co&#8208;Doped Graphitic Carbon as Efficient Bifunctional Catalysts for Zn&#8208;Air Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
CoFe/Se@CN with abundant porous structure was obtained through a self&#8208;sacrificing template method. The large specific surface area and the mesopores of CoFe/Se@CN provide rich active sites and facilitate the transport and transfer of protons and electrons. The abundant defects formed by doping Se enhance the oxygen adsorption/activation of carbon surfaces and increase active sites. Under the synergistic effect of CoFe alloys and Se, N co&#8208;doped graphitic carbon, CoFe/Se@CN exhibits excellent ORR and OER properties with an ultralow potential gap of 0.625&#8197;V.







Abstract
The development of a stable and efficient non&#8208;noble metal catalyst with both oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is paramount to achieving the widespread application of Zn&#8208;air batteries (ZABs) but remains a great challenge. Herein, a novel Co3Fe7 alloy nanoparticle dispersed on Se, N co&#8208;doped graphitic carbon (denoted as CoFe/Se@CN) was prepared through a facile hydrothermal and pyrolysis process. The synthesized CoFe/Se@CN exhibits outstanding ORR and OER properties with an ultralow potential gap of 0.625&#8197;V, which is mainly attributed to the abundant porous structure, the rich structural defects formed by doping Se atoms, and the strong synergistic effects between the CoFe alloys and graphitic carbon nanosheet. Furthermore, the ZAB fabricated by CoFe/Se@CN shows a high peak power density of 160&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and a large specific capacity of 802&#8197;mA&#8201;h&#8201;g&#8722;1 with favorable cycling stability, outperforming that of Pt/C+RuO2. Our study offers a plausible strategy to explore bifunctional carbon&#8208;based materials with efficient electrocatalytic properties for rechargeable ZABs.

&lt;p&gt;CoFe/Se@CN with abundant porous structure was obtained through a self-sacrificing template method. The large specific surface area and the mesopores of CoFe/Se@CN provide rich active sites and facilitate the transport and transfer of protons and electrons. The abundant defects formed by doping Se enhance the oxygen adsorption/activation of carbon surfaces and increase active sites. Under the synergistic effect of CoFe alloys and Se, N co-doped graphitic carbon, CoFe/Se@CN exhibits excellent ORR and OER properties with an ultralow potential gap of 0.625&#8197;V.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The development of a stable and efficient non-noble metal catalyst with both oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is paramount to achieving the widespread application of Zn-air batteries (ZABs) but remains a great challenge. Herein, a novel Co&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Fe&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt; alloy nanoparticle dispersed on Se, N co-doped graphitic carbon (denoted as CoFe/Se@CN) was prepared through a facile hydrothermal and pyrolysis process. The synthesized CoFe/Se@CN exhibits outstanding ORR and OER properties with an ultralow potential gap of 0.625&#8197;V, which is mainly attributed to the abundant porous structure, the rich structural defects formed by doping Se atoms, and the strong synergistic effects between the CoFe alloys and graphitic carbon nanosheet. Furthermore, the ZAB fabricated by CoFe/Se@CN shows a high peak power density of 160&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; and a large specific capacity of 802&#8197;mA&#8201;h&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; with favorable cycling stability, outperforming that of Pt/C+RuO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Our study offers a plausible strategy to explore bifunctional carbon-based materials with efficient electrocatalytic properties for rechargeable ZABs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>High&#8208;Mannose Oligosaccharide Hemimimetics that Recapitulate the Conformation and Binding Mode to Concanavalin A, DC&#8208;SIGN and Langerin</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The &#8220;carbohydrate chemical mimicry&#8221; of sp2&#8208;iminosugars enables the synthesis of high&#8208;mannose&#8208;type oligosaccharide analogs whose solution and lectin bound conformations match those of the natural partners. Upon multivalent presentation, enhanced affinities towards ConA, DC&#8208;SIGN and langerin are achieved, with distinct selectivity profiles.







Abstract
The &#8220;carbohydrate chemical mimicry&#8221; exhibited by sp2&#8208;iminosugars has been utilized to develop practical syntheses for analogs of the branched high&#8208;mannose&#8208;type oligosaccharides (HMOs) Man3 and Man5. In these compounds, the terminal nonreducing Man residues have been substituted with 5,6&#8208;oxomethylidenemannonojirimycin (OMJ) motifs. The resulting oligomannoside hemimimetic accurately reproduce the structure, configuration, and conformational behavior of the original mannooligosaccharides, as confirmed by NMR and computational techniques. Binding studies with mannose binding lectins, including concanavalin A, DC&#8208;SIGN, and langerin, by enzyme&#8208;linked lectin assay and surface plasmon resonance revealed significant variations in their ability to accommodate the OMJ unit in the mannose binding site. Intriguingly, OMJMan segments demonstrated &#8220;in line&#8221; heteromultivalent effects during binding to the three lectins. Similar to the mannobiose (Man2) branches in HMOs, the binding modes involving the external or internal monosaccharide unit at the carbohydrate binding&#8208;domain exist in equilibrium, facilitating sliding and recapture processes. This equilibrium, which influences the multivalent binding of HMOs, can be finely modulated upon incorporation of the OMJ sp2&#8208;iminosugar caps. As a proof of concept, the affinity and selectivity towards DC&#8208;SIGN and langerin were adjustable by presenting the OMJMan epitope in platforms with diverse architectures and valencies.

         <title>Temperature&#8208;Modulated Reversible Clustering of Gold Nanorods Driven by Small Surface Ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In thermoresponsive plasmonics, size does matter: This study presents a strategy for preparing thermosensitive gold nanorods clustering reversibly over a broad temperature range and reaching interparticle gaps as small as 1&#8197;nm in the clustered state. This enables the possibility to exploit the full promise of plasmonic coupling and the generation of dynamic hotspots.







Abstract
Temperature&#8208;modulated colloidal phase of plasmonic nanoparticles is a convenient playground for resettable soft&#8208;actuators or colorimetric sensors. To render reversible clustering under temperature change, bulky ligands are required, especially if anisotropic morphologies are of interest. This study showcases thermoresponsive gold nanorods by employing small surface ligands, bis (p&#8208;sulfonatophenyl) phenyl&#8208;phosphine dihydrate dipotassium salt (BSPP) and native cationic surfactant. Temperature&#8208;dependent analysis in real&#8208;time allowed to describe the structural features (interparticle distance and cluster size) as well as thermal parameters, melting and freezing temperatures. These findings suggest that neither covalent Au&#8722;S bonds nor bulky ligands are required to obtain a robust thermoresponsive system based on anisotropic gold nanoparticles, paving the way to stimuli&#8208;responsive nanoparticles with a wide range of sizes and geometries.

         <title>Field&#8208;Assisted Regulation Induced by Cobalt&#8208;Doped ZnO for Dendrite&#8208;Free Lithium Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The incorporation of Co doping induces a local electric field and built&#8208;in magnetic field, thereby facilitating electron transfer and modulating the dynamic trajectory of Li+ ions, ultimately resulting in homogeneous Li deposition.







Abstract
Lithium metal batteries are deemed as an optimal candidate for the next generation of durable energy storage devices. However, the growth of lithium dendrite and significant volume expansion pose as obstacles that impede the application of lithium metal batteries. In this work, a functional copper current collector was designed by coating it with Co&#8208;doped ZnO (Co/ZnO) to enhance the lithiophilicity through local electric fields and built&#8208;in magnetic fields induced by the ferromagnetic material. The incorporation of Co not only induces a local electric field and thus accelerating electron transfer, but also imparts the ferromagnetic behavior to ZnO, resulting in an internal magnetic field to regulate the dynamic trajectory. Profiting from the above advantages, the symmetric cells have excellent cycle stability in 1&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and 1&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2, maintaining ultra&#8208;low voltage for over 2000&#8197;h. This study provides a realizable pathway for next&#8208;generation current collector of copper modification.

         <title>Underwater Adhesives from Redox&#8208;Responsive Polyplexes of Thiolated Polyamide Polyelectrolytes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Redox&#8208;responsive underwater adhesives exhibiting high optical transparency, biodegradability and strong adhesion of biological substrates were prepared from polyplexes of oppositely charged partially&#8208;thiolated polyamide polyelectrolytes (TPEs).







Abstract
We report the fabrication of optically clear underwater adhesives using polyplexes of oppositely charged partially&#8208;thiolated polyamide polyelectrolytes (TPEs). The thiol content of the constituent PEs was varied to assess its influence on the adhesive properties of the resulting glues. These catechol&#8208;free, redox&#8208;responsive TPE&#8208;adhesives were formulated in aquo and exhibited high optical transparency and strong adhesion even on submerged or moist surfaces of diverse polar substrates such as glass, aluminium, wood, and bone pieces. The adhesives could be cured under water through oxidative disulphide crosslinking of the constituent TPEs. The polyamide backbone provided multi&#8208;site H&#8208;bonding interactions with the substrates while the disulphide crosslinking provided the cohesive strength to the glue. Strong adhesion of mammalian bones (load bearing capacity upto 7&#8197;kg/cm2) was achieved using the adhesive containing 30&#8197;mol&#8201;% thiol residues. Higher pH and use of oxidants such as povidone&#8208;iodine solution enhanced the curing rate of the adhesives, and so did the use of Tris buffer instead of Phosphate buffer. The porous architecture of the adhesive and its progressive degradation in aqueous medium over the course of three weeks bode well for diverse biomedical applications where temporary adhesion of tissues is required.

NiFe materials are the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art electrocatalysts for water oxidation, therefore, fine tuning their properties is the cornerstone to achieving more active and efficient catalysts. In this concept, we will review the recently emerged strategies to engineer them molecularly and atomically by introducing different vacancies, incorporating single atoms or by ligand functionalization.







Abstract
FeNi oxides/hydroxides are the best performing catalysts for oxidizing water at basic pH. Consequently, their improvement is the cornerstone to develop more efficient artificial photosynthetic systems. During the last 5&#8197;years different reports have demonstrated an enhancement of their activity by engineering their structures via: (1)&#8197;modulation of the number of oxygen, iron and nickel vacancies; (2)&#8197;single atoms (SAs) doping with metals such as Au, Ir, Ru and Pt; and (3)&#8197;modification of their surface using organic ligands. All these strategies have led to more active and stable electrocatalysts for oxygen evolution rection (OER). In this Concept, we critically analyze these strategies using the most relevant examples.

         <title>Engineering a Cl&#8722;&#8208;Modulated Light&#8208;Driven Na+ Pump</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Microbial Na+&#8208;pumping rhodopsin (NaR) is a promising optogenetic tool due to its unique ability to transport Na+. We have developed a novel chemical modulation mode for NaR that goes beyond light control by introducing a potential Cl&#8722; binding site (Gln160). The increase in [Cl&#8722;] accelerates the uptake of Na+ and enhances Na+ transport activity. This Cl&#8722;&#8208;modulated NaR shows promise for potential applications in optogenetic therapies for related neurological diseases. More information can be found in the Research Article by D. Chen and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202302543).

         <title>An Iron Macrocyclic Complex Containing Four &#8220;Hybrid&#8221; Pyridinium Amidate/Amidate N&#8208;Donors as a Catalyst for Oxidations with Hydrogen Peroxide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The depicted macrocyclic iron complex is a highly active, biomimetic oxidation catalyst in water at pH&#8197;7. The iron centre is coordinated by four unique, hybrid, pyridinium amidate/amidate nitrogen donors. Upon activation by the green oxidant hydrogen peroxide, the iron complex is converted to an aggressive intermediate (represented by the piranha) that very rapidly oxidises the surrogate pollutant orange&#8197;II to colourless products, with the iron returning to its FeIII resting state. More information can be found in the Research Article by L.&#8197;J. Wright and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202301548).

         <title>Poly(arylene iminoborane)s, Analogues of Poly(arylene vinylene) with a BN&#8208;Doped Backbone: A Comprehensive Study</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inorganic&#8211;organic hybrid polymers with a BN&#8208;doped backbone have been developed using a modular synthetic approach. By combining various building blocks (i.e., the puzzle pieces), p&#8208;conjugated polymers and monodisperse oligomers with modulated properties, including solid&#8208;state and aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) at tailored wavelengths, can be accessed. This is illustrated by the polymer sequence and the background color, depending on the incorporated building blocks that were put together. More information can be found in the Research Article by H. Helten et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202302767).

         <dc:description>Separation and reuse of the catalytically active metal complexes are persistent issues in homogeneous catalysis. Supported Ionic Liquid Phase (SILP) catalysts, where the catalytic center is dissolved in a thin film of a stable ionic liquid, deposited on a solid support, present a promising alternative. However, the dissolution of the metal center in the film leaves little control over its position and its activity. We present here four novel, task&#8208;specific ionic liquids [FPhnImHR]I (n&#8201;=&#8201;1, 2; R&#8201;=&#8201;PEG2, C12H25), designed to self&#8208;assemble on a silica surface without any covalent bonding and offering a metal binding site in a controlled distance to the support. Advanced multinuclear solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopic techniques under Magic Angle Spinning, complemented by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, allow us to determine their molecular conformation when deposited inside SBA&#8208;15 as a model silica support. We provide here conceptual proof for a rational design of Ionic Liquids self&#8208;assembling into thin films, opening an avenue for a second, improved generation of SILP catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Advances in Inorganic Solid&#8208;State Electrolyte/Li Interface</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The demand for high&#8208;energy&#8208;density and high&#8208;safety energy storage devices has inspired increased interest in all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries (ASSLMBs). An outstanding inorganic solid&#8208;state electrolyte (ISE) is a fundamental requirement for ASSLMBs, and a well&#8208;performing ISE/Li interface is a key factor in achieving high&#8208;performance ASSLMBs. In this concept, we first summarize the dilemmas ISE/Li interfaces face and outline four strategies commonly used for ISE/Li interfacial modification. Then, we discuss the advantages and disadvantages of the coatings being used as ISE/Li interfacial phases, as well as the commonly used thermal bonding and the new cold bonding methods used for in situ interface preparation. Finally, future directions for functionalizing ISE interfaces and achieving high&#8208;performance ASSLMBs are highlighted.</dc:description>

In this concept, we first summarize the dilemmas ISE/Li interfaces face and outline four strategies commonly used for ISE/Li interfacial modification. Then, we discuss the advantages and disadvantages of the coatings being used as ISE/Li interfacial phases, as well as the commonly used thermal bonding and the new cold bonding methods used for in situ interface preparation. Finally, future directions for functionalizing ISE interfaces and achieving high-performance ASSLMBs are highlighted.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <dc:description>
In this Concept, we present an overview of the most recent growth in photo&#8208; and electrochemical synthesis of P1 organo&#8208;compounds from P4 with special emphasis on sustainable features.

Abstract
Elemental white phosphorous (P4) is a crucial feedstock for the entire phosphorus&#8208;derived chemical industry, serving as a common precursor for the ultimate preparation of high&#8208;grade monophosphorus (P1) fine chemicals. However, the corresponding manufacturing processes generally suffer from a deep reliance on hazardous reagents, inputs of immense energy, emissions of toxic pollutants, and the generation of substantial waste, which have negative impacts on the environment. In this context, sustainability and safety concerns provide a consistent impetus for the urgent overall improvement of phosphorus cycles. In this Concept, we present an overview of the most recent growth in photo&#8208; and electrochemical synthesis of P1 organo&#8208;compounds from P4, with special emphasis on sustainable features. The key aspects of innovations regarding activation mode and mechanism have been comprehensively analyzed. A preliminary look at the possible future direction of development is also provided.

         <title>Blatter Diradicals with a Spin Coupler at the N(1) Position</title>

Diradicals: Simple, modular and convergent access to diradicals with controllable S&#8722;T gap demonstrated with two examples.







Abstract
Reactions of a benzo[e][1,2,4]triazine with dilithiobenzenes lead to di&#8208;Blatter diradicals connected at the N(1) positions via a spin coupling unit, 1,4&#8208;phenylene or 1,3&#8208;phenylene. Electrochemical analysis in MeCN revealed four one&#8208;electron redox processes separated by 0.1&#8211;0.3&#8197;V in both diradicals. Variable temperature EPR measurements in polystyrene (PS) solid solutions gave the singlet&#8208;triplet energy gaps &#916;ES&#8208;T=2&#8197;J of &#8722;3.02(11) and &#8722;0.16(1)&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1 for 1,4&#8208;phenylene and 1,3&#8208;phenylene derivatives, respectively. The latter negative value was attributed to conformational properties of the diradical in the PS solid solution. Results suggest a simple and efficient access to a family of stable Blatter diradicals with a controllable S&#8722;T gap through a judicious choice of the arylene coupling unit. DFT calculations indicate that the triplet state is stabilized by (het)arylenes with low LUMO.

         <title>Hydrogenation of CO2 by a Bifunctional PC(sp3)P Iridium(III) Pincer Complex Equipped with Tertiary Amine as a Functional Group</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 63, November 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydrogenation of CO2 under molecular hydrogen by a fully characterized Ir(III) pincer complex is described. The unique biomimetic second coordination sphere functionality is investigated both empirically and computationally shows the hydrogen activation step to proceed in room temperature.







Abstract
Reversible hydrogen storage in the form of stable and mostly harmless chemical substances such as formic acid (FA) is a cornerstone of a fossil fuels&#8208;free economy. In the past, we have reported a primary amine&#8208;functionalized bifunctional iridium(III)&#8208;PC(sp3)P pincer complex as a mild and chemoselective catalyst for the additive&#8208;free decomposition of neat formic acid. In this manuscript, we report on the successful application of a redesigned complex bearing tertiary amine functionality as a catalyst for mild hydrogenation of CO2 to formic acid. The catalyst demonstrates TON up to 6&#215;104 and TOF up to 1.7&#215;104&#8197;h&#8722;1. In addition to the practical value of the catalyst, experimental and computational mechanistic studies provide the rationale for the design of improved next&#8208;generation catalysts.

         <title>Post&#8208;Synthetic Nucleobase Modification of Oligodeoxynucleotides by Sonogashira Coupling and Influence of Alkynyl Modifications on the Duplex&#8208;Forming Ability</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 63, November 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A post&#8208;synthetic nucleobase modification method for oligonucleotides via Sonogashira coupling is developed. This method enables efficient synthesis of various types of alkynyl&#8208;modified oligonucleotides and evaluation of the stability of the duplex formed by the synthesized alkynyl&#8208;modified oligonucleotides. Interestingly, alkynyl&#8208;modification on pyrimidine is less tolerated than on purine in duplex stability.







Abstract
Recently, it was reported that the alkynyl modification of nucleobases mitigates the toxicity of antisense oligonucleotides (ASO) while maintaining the efficacy. However, the general effect of alkynyl modifications on the duplex&#8208;forming ability of oligonucleotides (ONs) is unclear. In this study, post&#8208;synthetic nucleobase modification by Sonogashira coupling in aqueous medium was carried out to efficiently evaluate the physiological properties of various ONs with alkynyl&#8208;modified nucleobases. Although several undesired reactions, including nucleobase cyclization, were observed, various types of alkynyl&#8208;modified ONs were successfully obtained via Sonogashira coupling of ONs containing iodinated nucleobases. Evaluation of the stability of the duplex formed by the synthesized alkynyl&#8208;modified ONs showed that the alkynyl modification of pyrimidine was less tolerated than that of purine, although both the modifications occurred in the major groove of the duplex. These results can be attributed to the bond angle of the alkyne on the pyrimidine and the close proximity of the alkynyl substituents to the phosphodiester backbone. The synthetic method developed in this study may contribute to the screening of the optimal chemical modification of ASO because various alkynyl&#8208;modified ONs that are effective in reducing the toxicity of ASO can be easily synthesized by this method.

         <title>Acetylene Semi&#8208;Hydrogenation at Room Temperature over Pd&#8722;Zn Nanocatalyst</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 63, November 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hexadecylamine capped Pd&#8208;Zn nanoparticles were realized by a combination of solvated metal atom dispersion and co&#8208;digestive approaches. Acetylene semi&#8208;hydrogenation was achieved using Pd&#8722;Zn nanoparticles at room temperature and atmospheric pressure with high selectivity towards ethylene.







Abstract
A reaction of fundamental and commercial importance is acetylene semi&#8208;hydrogenation. Acetylene impurity in the ethylene feedstock used in the polyethylene industry poisons the Ziegler&#8208;Natta catalyst which adversely affects the polymer quality.

     alt="Acetylene Semi-Hydrogenation at Room Temperature over Pd&#8722;Zn Nanocatalyst"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hexadecylamine capped Pd-Zn nanoparticles&lt;/b&gt; were realized by a combination of solvated metal atom dispersion and co-digestive approaches. Acetylene semi-hydrogenation was achieved using Pd&#8722;Zn nanoparticles at room temperature and atmospheric pressure with high selectivity towards ethylene.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reaction of fundamental and commercial importance is acetylene semi-hydrogenation. Acetylene impurity in the ethylene feedstock used in the polyethylene industry poisons the Ziegler-Natta catalyst which adversely affects the polymer quality. Pd based catalysts are most often employed for converting acetylene into the main reactant, ethylene, however, it often involves a tradeoff between the conversion and the selectivity and generally requires high temperatures. In this work, bimetallic Pd&#8722;Zn nanoparticles capped by hexadecylamine (HDA) have been synthesized by co-digestive ripening of Pd and Zn nanoparticles and studied for semi-hydrogenation of acetylene. The catalyst showed a high selectivity of ~85&#8201;% towards ethylene with a high ethylene productivity to the tune of ~4341&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;min&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, at room temperature and atmospheric pressure. It also exhibited excellent stability with ethylene selectivity remaining greater than 85&#8201;% even after 70&#8197;h on stream. To the best of the authors&#8217; knowledge, this is the first report of room temperature acetylene semi-hydrogenation, with the catalyst effecting high amount of acetylene conversion to ethylene retaining excellent selectivity and stability among all the reported catalysts thus far. DFT calculations show that the disordered Pd&#8722;Zn nanocatalyst prepared by a low temperature route exhibits a change in the d-band center of Pd and Zn which in turn enhances the selectivity towards ethylene. TPD, XPS and a range of catalysis experiments provided in-depth insights into the reaction mechanism, indicating the key role of particle size, surface area, Pd&#8722;Zn interactions, and the capping agent.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Two mixed&#8208;valence diiron complexes with carbon bridges are reported. The mixed&#8208;valence [2Fe&#8722;2C] complex 4 possesses a low&#8208;spin ground state yet displays strong valence delocalization as evident by M&#246;ssbauer spectroscopy. In contrast, the reduced [2Fe&#8722;C] complex 5 displays a class&#8208;III valence&#8208;delocalized ground state that is supported by magnetometry, vis&#8208;NIR and M&#246;ssbauer spectroscopy, as well as DFT calculations.







Abstract
The carbide ligand in the iron&#8211;molybdenum cofactor (FeMoco) in nitrogenase bridges iron atoms in different oxidation states, yet it is difficult to discern its ability to mediate magnetic exchange interactions due to the structural complexity of the cofactor. Here, we describe two mixed&#8208;valent diiron complexes with C&#8208;based ketenylidene bridging ligands, and compare the carbon bridges with the more familiar sulfur bridges. The ground state of the [Fe2(&#956;&#8208;CCO)2]+ complex with two carbon bridges (4) is S=
, and it is valence delocalized on the M&#246;ssbauer timescale with a small thermal barrier for electron hopping that stems from the low Fe&#8722;C force constant. In contrast, one&#8208;electron reduction of the [Fe2(&#956;&#8208;CCO)] complex with one carbon bridge (2) affords a mixed&#8208;valence species with a high&#8208;spin ground state (S=
), and the Fe&#8722;Fe distance contracts by 1&#8197;&#197;. Spectroscopic, magnetic, and computational studies of the latter reveal an Fe&#8722;Fe bonding interaction that leads to complete valence delocalization. Analysis of near&#8208;IR intervalence charge transfer transitions in 5 indicates a very large double exchange constant (B) in the range of 780&#8211;965&#8197;cm&#8722;1. These results show that carbon bridges are extremely effective at stabilizing valence delocalized ground states in mixed&#8208;valent iron dimers.

&#8226; 1st Ge atom side&#8208;on coordination to C=N, &#8226; Novel mode of aromatic C&#8722;C bond activation by NHC, &#8226; Germanium atom transfer







Abstract
The germylone dimNHCGe (dimNHC=diimino N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene) reacts with azides N3R (R=SiMe3 or p&#8208;tolyl) to furnish the first examples of germanium &#960;&#8208;complexes, i.&#8201;e. guanidine&#8208;ligated compounds (dimNHI&#8722;SiMe3)Ge (NHI=N&#8208;heterocyclic imine, R=SiMe3) and (dimNHI&#8722;Tol)Ge (R=p&#8208;tolyl). DFT calculations suggest that these species are formed by a Staudinger type replacement of dinitrogen in the azide by a nucleophilic germylone, leading to a transient carbene adduct of iminogermylidene. Heating a solution of compound (dimNHI&#8722;SiMe3)Ge to 70&#8201;&#176;C results in extrusion of the iminogermylidene that further aggregates to produce the known [Me3SiNGe]4 tetramer, whereas the imidazolylidene fragment transforms into an unusual heptatriene species that can be considered as a product of carbene insertion into the C&#8722;C bond of a pendant Ar substituent at the imidazolylidene nitrogen of the dimNHC. Reaction of (dimNHI&#8722;SiMe3)Ge with tetrachloro&#8208;o&#8208;benzoquinone results in the net transfer of a germanium atom and formation of the free diimino&#8208;guanidine ligand. This ligand also forms when (dimNHI&#8722;SiMe3)Ge is treated with azide N3(p&#8722;Tol), with the germanium product being [(p&#8722;Tol)NGe]n

Geometry of the first excited S1 state has been obtained for the bimetallic end&#8208;on &#956;2&#8208;&#951;1:&#951;1&#8208;N2 bridging dinitrogen complexes that possess characteristic N&#8722;N &#960;* based LUMO (&#960;*&#8208;&#960;*&#8208;&#960;*) centered on their M&#8722;N&#8722;N&#8722;M core. The elongated N&#8722;N bond in the S1 state and thermodynamically feasible N&#8722;N protonation free energies hold great promise for N2 &#960;&#8208;photoactivation and protonation.







Abstract
Bimetallic end&#8208;on &#956;2&#8208;&#951;1:&#951;1&#8208;N2 bridging dinitrogen complexes have served as the platform for photochemical N2 activation, mainly for the N&#8722;N cleavage. However, the alternate N&#8722;N &#960;&#8208;photoactivation route has remained largely unexplored. This study strengthens the notion of weakening the N&#8722;N bond through the population of &#960;* orbital upon electronic excitation from the ground to the first excited state using four prototypical complexes based on Fe (1), Mo (2), and Ru (3,4). The complexes 1&#8211;4 possess characteristic N&#8722;N &#960;* based LUMO (&#960;*&#8208;&#960;*&#8208;&#960;*) centered on their M&#8722;N&#8722;N&#8722;M core, which was earlier postulated to play a central role in the N2 photoactivation. Vertical electronic excitation of the highest oscillator strength involves transitions to the N&#8722;N &#960;*&#8208;based acceptor orbital (&#960;*&#8208;&#960;*&#8208;&#960;*) in complexes 1&#8211;4. This induces geometry relaxation of the first excited metal&#8208;to&#8208;nitrogen (&#960;*) charge transfer (1MNCT) state leading to a &#8220;zigzag&#8221; M&#8722;N&#8722;N&#8722;M core in the equilibrium structure. Obtaining the equilibrium geometry in the first excited state with the full&#8208;sized complexes widens the scope of N&#8722;N &#960;&#8208;photoactivation with &#956;2&#8208;&#951;1:&#951;1&#8208;N2 bridging dinitrogen complexes. Promisingly, the elongated N&#8722;N bond and bent &#8736;MNN angle in the photoexcited S1 state of 1&#8211;4 resemble their radical&#8208; and di&#8208;anion forms, which lead toward thermodynamically feasible N&#8722;N protonation in the S1 excited state.

Vertical electronic excitation of the highest oscillator strength involves transitions to the N&#8722;N &#960;*-based acceptor orbital (&#960;*-&#960;*-&#960;*) in complexes &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;&#8211;&lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt;. This induces geometry relaxation of the first excited metal-to-nitrogen (&#960;*) charge transfer (&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;MNCT) state leading to a &#8220;zigzag&#8221; M&#8722;N&#8722;N&#8722;M core in the equilibrium structure. Obtaining the equilibrium geometry in the first excited state with the full-sized complexes widens the scope of N&#8722;N &#960;-photoactivation with &#956;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-&#951;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;:&#951;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;-N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; bridging dinitrogen complexes. Promisingly, the elongated N&#8722;N bond and bent &#8736;MNN angle in the photoexcited S&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; state of &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;&#8211;&lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt; resemble their radical- and di-anion forms, which lead toward thermodynamically feasible N&#8722;N protonation in the S&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; excited state.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Rational Design, Multistep Synthesis and in Vitro Evaluation of Poly(glycerol) Functionalized Nanodiamond Conjugated with Boron&#8208;10 Cluster and Active Targeting Moiety for Boron Neutron Capture Therapy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 63, November 13, 2023. </description>

Poly(glycerol) functionalized detonation nanodiamonds conjugated with boron&#8208;10 cluster and active targeting moiety were designed and synthesized. The nanodrugs were taken up by tumor cells and exhibited boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT) efficacy upon thermal neutron irradiation.







Abstract
Boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT), advanced cancer treatment utilizing nuclear fission of 10B atom in cancer cells, is attracting increasing attention. As 10B delivery agent, sodium borocaptate (10BSH, 10B12H11SH&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2Na), has been used in clinical studies along with L&#8208;boronophenylalanine. Recently, this boron cluster has been conjugated with lipids, polymers or nanoparticles to increase selectivity to and retentivity in tumor. In this work, anticancer nanoformulations for BNCT are designed, consisting of poly(glycerol) functionalized detonation nanodiamonds (DND&#8722;PG) as a hydrophilic nanocarrier, the boron cluster moiety (10B12H112&#8722;) as a dense boron&#8208;10 source, and phenylboronic acid or RGD peptide as an active targeting moiety. Some hydroxy groups in PG were oxidized to carboxy groups (DND&#8722;PG&#8722;COOH) to conjugate the active targeting moiety. Some hydroxy groups in DND&#8722;PG&#8722;COOH were then transformed to azide to conjugate 10B12H112&#8722; through click chemistry. The nanodrugs were evaluated in&#8197;vitro using B16 murine melanoma cells in terms of cell viability, BNCT efficacy and cellular uptake. As a result, the 10B12H112&#8722; moiety is found to facilitate cellular uptake probably due to its negative charge. Upon thermal neutron irradiation, the nanodrugs with 10B12H112&#8722; moiety exhibited good anticancer efficacies with slight differences with and without targeting moiety.

         <title>Trichlates, an Unattended Class of Compounds: Characterization of Cl3CSO2Cl, and (H5O2)[Cl3CSO3]</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 63, November 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The so&#8208;called &#8220;trichlates&#8221; are the heavier but scarcely investigated homologues of the well&#8208;known triflates. Access to the acid (H5O2)[Cl3CSO3] is the key step for the synthesis of trichlates. The acid can be prepared by chlorination of CS2, yielding Cl3CSCl, and subsequent oxidation by H2O2 giving Cl3CSO2Cl, the chloride of the acid.







Abstract
Chlorination of CS2 leads to trichloromethanesulfenyl chloride, Cl3CSCl, in moderate yields. The oxidation of Cl3CSCl with H2O2 gives Cl3CSO2Cl, the chloride of trichloromethanesulfonic acid. Cl3CSO2Cl is the crucial product for the preparation of trichloromethanesulfonates (&#8220;trichlates&#8221;) and has been characterized by IR spectroscopy, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and X&#8208;ray diffraction measurements (P&#8208;1, a=609.99(5) pm, b=727.45(6) pm, c=782.49(7) pm, &#945;=80.644(3)&#176;, &#946;=85.175(3)&#176;, &#947;=88.311(3)&#176;. The acid Cl3CSO3H can be gained in form of the hydrate (H5O2)[Cl3CSO3] in two different modifications (I: monoclinic, P21/n, Z=8, a=1292.47(7) pm, b=605.89(2) pm, c=2661.1(1) pm, &#946;=98.708(4)&#176;, V=1672.8(1) &#197;3; II: monoclinic, Cc, Z=4, a=699.80(5) pm, b=1054.72(8) pm, c=1139.88(8) pm, &#946;=95.303(3)&#176;, V=837.7(1) &#197;3. Both modifications have been investigated by IR spectroscopy, thermal analyses and theoretical calculations.

         <title>Photoreduction of Anthracenes Catalyzed by peri&#8208;Xanthenoxanthene: a Scalable and Sustainable Birch&#8208;Type Alternative</title>

Recyclability with efficiency: Photocatalyzed &#8220;Birch&#8208;type&#8221; reduction of acenes by using peri&#8208;xanthenoxanthene (PXX). We present a novel method for reducing various full&#8208;carbon acenes using visible blue light and PXX as a photocatalyst. By attaching PXX to PDMS beads, we achieve catalyst recyclability without compromising efficiency. We also demonstrate continuous&#8208;flow reduction in a microreactor, which enhances the sustainability and scalability of this heterogenous phase strategy.







Abstract
The typical Birch reduction transforms arenes into cyclohexa&#8208;1,4&#8208;dienes by using alkali metals, an alcohol as a proton source, and an amine as solvent. Capitalizing on the strong photoreductive properties of peri&#8208;xanthenoxanthene (PXX), herein we report the photocatalyzed &#8220;Birch&#8208;type&#8221; reduction of acenes by employing visible blue light irradiation at room temperature in the presence of air. Upon excitation at 405 or 460&#8197;nm in the presence of a mixture of N,N&#8208;diisopropylethylamine (DIPEA) and trifluoromethanesulfonimide (HNTf2) in DMSO, PXX photocatalyzes the selective reduction of full&#8208;carbon acene derivatives (24&#8211;75&#8201;%). Immobilization of PXX onto polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) beads (PXX&#8208;PDMS) allowed the use of the catalyst in heterogeneous batch reactions, giving 9&#8208;phenyl&#8208;9,10&#8208;dihydroanthracene in high yield (68&#8201;%). The catalyst could easily be recovered and reused, with no notable drop in performance observed after five reaction cycles. Integration of the PXX&#8208;PDMS beads into a microreactor enabled the reduction of acenes under continuous&#8208;flow conditions, thereby validating the sustainability and scalability of this heterogeneous&#8208;phase approach.

         <title>Double&#8208;Walled Covalent Organic Frameworks with High Stability</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 63, November 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two covalent organic frameworks with double&#8208;walled linkages were successfully synthesized and exhibited excellent stability when treated with boiling water and basic solutions. Moreover, these double&#8208;walled COFs exhibited remarkable IAST selectivity for favored adsorption of CO2 over N2.







Abstract
Double&#8208;walled covalent organic frameworks, consisting of two same building blocks parallel to each other forming ladder&#8208;shape linkers, could enhance the stability of the frameworks and increase the density of functional sites, thus making them suitable for various applications. In this study, two double&#8208;walled covalent organic frameworks, namely DW&#8208;COF&#8208;1 and DW&#8208;COF&#8208;2, were successfully synthesized via imine condensation. The resulting DW&#8208;COFs exhibited a honeycomb topology, high crystallinity and stability. Particularly, DW&#8208;COF&#8208;2 showed excellent resistance toward boiling water, strong acid, and strong base, due to its double&#8208;walled structure, which limits the exposure of labile imine bonds to external chemical environments. The DW&#8208;COFs showed high porosity near 900&#8197;m2/g, making them suitable for gas storage/separation. The selective gas adsorption experiments showed that at 273&#8197;K and 1&#8197;atm pressure, DW&#8208;COF&#8208;1 and DW&#8208;COF&#8208;2 exhibited a good IAST selectivity towards CO2/N2 (15/85) adsorption, with selectivity values of 121.3 and 56.4 for CO2 over N2, respectively.

         <title>Selective and Stepwise Functionalization of the Pyridazine Scaffold by Using Thio&#8208;Substituted Pyridazine Building Blocks</title>

We described a regioselective tri&#8208; and tetra&#8208;functionalization of the pyridazine scaffold using two readily available building blocks: 3&#8208;(butylthio)&#8208;6&#8208;chloropyridazine and 3,4&#8208;bis(methylthio)&#8208;6&#8208;chloropyridazine by performing selective metalations with TMPMgCl&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;LiCl and catalyst&#8208;tuned cross&#8208;coupling reactions with arylzinc halides. Several of the resulting pyridazines were converted into more elaborated N&#8208;heterocycles such as thieno[2,3&#8208;c]pyridazines and 1H&#8208;pyrazolo[3,4&#8208;c]pyridazines.

         <title>Continuous&#8208;Flow Synthesis of Cycloparaphenylene Building Blocks on a Large Scale</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 63, November 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cycloparaphenylenes ([n]CPPs) and similar nanohoops are accessible by combining building blocks. Herein, we report a continuous&#8208;flow synthesis of key CPP building blocks by using self&#8208;built reactors on up&#8208;to kilogram scale. This fast and large&#8208;scale access opens new possibilities for further research in the field of curved aromatic compounds.







Abstract
The synthesis of [n]cycloparaphenylenes ([n]CPPs) and similar nanohoops is usually based on combining building blocks to a macrocyclic precursor, which is then aromatized in the final step. Access to those building blocks in large amounts will simplify the synthesis and studies of CPPs as novel functional materials for applications. Herein, we report a continuous&#8208;flow synthesis of key CPP building blocks by using versatile synthesis techniques such as electrochemical oxidation, lithiations and Suzuki cross&#8208;couplings in self&#8208;built reactors on up&#8208;to kilogram scale.

         <title>Behavior of a Dynamic Covalent Library Driven by Combined Pd(II) and Biphasic Effectors for Metal Transport between Phases</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 63, November 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pd(II) acts as a chemical effector on an acylhydrazone&#8208;based dynamic covalent library (DCL) in a biphasic system. The introduction of Pd(II) leads to a significant increase in the constituent that is best suited for a transfer of Pd(II) into the organic phase. This study introduces a novel approach for liquid/liquid extraction and metal recovery by utilizing extractant species generated in&#8197;situ by the DCL.







Abstract
This work reports the effect of Pd(II) as chemical effector on an acylhydrazone&#8208;based dynamic covalent library (DCL) in biphasic systems (water/chloroform). The constituents of the DCL are self&#8208;built and distributed in the two phases, two of them are lipophilic enough to play the role of a carrier agent that may transfer Pd(II) from the aqueous phase to the organic phase. Upon addition of Pd(II), the DCL of components exhibits a strong amplification of the constituent that is the most adapted to stabilize Pd(II) in chloroform as well as its agonist in water. This evolution is driven by the combination of the interaction of the DCL with Pd(II) and the presence of the two phases. This study paves the way to a novel approach for liquid/liquid extraction and metal recovery by means of adaptive extractant species generated in&#8197;situ by a DCL.

         <title>Multi&#8208;responsive Electropolymer Surface Coatings Based on Azo Molecular Switches and Carbazoles: Light, pH, and Electrochemical Control of Z&#8594;E Isomerization in Thin Films</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 63, November 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Oxidative electropolymerization of bis&#8208;carbazole containing azo monomers is a facile approach for preparing light&#8208;responsive azo&#8208;based surface coatings. The formed stable films retain the photochemical properties and pH sensitivity of the azo molecular switches and demonstrate electrocatalytic control over Z&#8594;E azo bond isomerization.







Abstract
Light&#8208;responsive surfaces are attracting increasing interest, not least because their physicochemical properties can be selectively and temporally controlled by a non&#8208;invasive stimulus. Most existing immobilization strategies involve the chemical attachment of light&#8208;responsive moieties to the surface, although this approach often suffers from a low surface concentration of active species or a high inhomogeneity of applied coatings. Herein, electropolymerization of carbazoles as a facile and rapid approach for preparing light&#8208;responsive azo&#8208;based surface coatings is presented. The electrochemical oxidative polymerization of bis&#8208;carbazole containing azo&#8208;monomers yields stable films, in which the photochemical properties and specific pH sensitivity of azo molecular switches are retained. Moreover, the molecular design enables electrocatalytic control over Z&#8594;E azo double bond isomerization facilitated by the conductive polycarbazole backbone. Ultimately, the high degree of control over macromolecular properties yields conductive surface coatings responsive to a range of stimuli, showing great promise as a strategy for versatile application in organic electronics.

&lt;p&gt;Light-responsive surfaces are attracting increasing interest, not least because their physicochemical properties can be selectively and temporally controlled by a non-invasive stimulus. Most existing immobilization strategies involve the chemical attachment of light-responsive moieties to the surface, although this approach often suffers from a low surface concentration of active species or a high inhomogeneity of applied coatings. Herein, electropolymerization of carbazoles as a facile and rapid approach for preparing light-responsive azo-based surface coatings is presented. The electrochemical oxidative polymerization of bis-carbazole containing azo-monomers yields stable films, in which the photochemical properties and specific pH sensitivity of azo molecular switches are retained. Moreover, the molecular design enables electrocatalytic control over &lt;i&gt;Z&#8594;E&lt;/i&gt; azo double bond isomerization facilitated by the conductive polycarbazole backbone. Ultimately, the high degree of control over macromolecular properties yields conductive surface coatings responsive to a range of stimuli, showing great promise as a strategy for versatile application in organic electronics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Weakly Self&#8208;Assembled [6]Helicenes: Circularly Polarized Light and Spin Filtering Properties</title>

Carbo[6]helicenes decorated with 3,4,5&#8208;tris(dodecyloxy)&#8208;N&#8208;(4&#8208;ethynylphenyl)benzamide moieties at their periphery give access to weak self&#8208;assemblies with circularly polarized luminescence and spin selectivity.







Abstract
Self&#8208;assembling features, chiroptical activity, and spin filtering properties are reported for 2,15&#8208; and 4,13&#8208;disubstituted [6]helicenes decorated in their periphery with 3,4,5&#8208;tris(dodecyloxy)&#8208;N&#8208;(4&#8208;ethynylphenyl)benzamide moieties. The weak non&#8208;covalent interaction between these units conditions the corresponding circularly polarized luminescence and spin polarization. The self&#8208;assembly is overall weak for these [6]helicene derivatives that, despite the formation of H&#8208;bonding interactions between the amide groups present in the peripheral moieties, shows very similar chiroptical properties both in the monomeric or aggregated states. This effect could be explained by considering the steric effect that these groups could generate in the growing of the corresponding aggregate formed. Importantly, the self&#8208;assembling features also condition chiral induced spin selectivity (CISS effect), with experimental spin polarization (SP) values found between 35&#8211;40&#8201;% for both systems, as measured by magnetic&#8208;conducting atomic force microscopy (AFM) technique.

         <title>Effects of the Magnetic Orientation of M13 Bacteriophage on Phage Display Selection</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 63, November 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
In phage display selection using M13 bacteriophage, the M13 main body, which is a huge filament&gt;103&#8197;time larger than the displayed peptide, has been considered to interfere with the result of affinity selection. This interference can be attenuated by magnetically orienting the M13 main body vertical to the target surface, which results in the suppression of nonspecific adhesion and the change in the population of selected M13 clones.







Abstract
Although phage display selection using a library of M13 bacteriophage has become a powerful tool for finding peptides that bind to target materials on demand, a remaining concern of this method is the interference by the M13 main body, which is a huge filament &gt;103&#8197;times larger than the displayed peptide, and therefore would nonspecifically adhere to the target or sterically inhibit the binding of the displayed peptide. Meanwhile, filamentous phages are known to be orientable by an external magnetic field. If M13 filaments are magnetically oriented during the library selection, their angular arrangement relative to the target surface would be changed, being expected to control the interference by the M13 main body. This study reports that the magnetic orientation of M13 filaments vertical to the target surface significantly affects the selection. When the target surface was affinitive to the M13 main body, this orientation notably suppressed the nonspecific adhesion. Furthermore, when the target surface was less affinitive to the M13 main body and intrinsically free from the nonspecific adhesion, this orientation drastically changed the population of M13 clones obtained through library selection. The method of using no chemicals but only a physical stimulus is simple, clean, and expected to expand the scope of phage display selection.

         <title>Redox Activity of IrIII Complexes with Multidentate Ligands Based on Dipyrido&#8208;Annulated N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbenes: Access to High Valent and High Spin State with Carbon Donors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 63, November 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A tetradentate carbon&#8208;based ligand allowed isolation and characterization of a formally +V tricationic iridium complex with a triplet ground state. Being both &#963; and &#960; donating, the figure &#8220;8&#8221; bis(dpaAr2&#8208;NHC) ligand are redox active, stabilizing the triplet state through one &#960;&#8208;conjugated framework. The similar electronegativities between Ir and C atoms allows a highly effective metal&#8208;ligand conjugation.







Abstract
Synthetic strategies to access high&#8208;valent iridium complexes usually require use of &#960; donating ligands bearing electronegative atoms (e.&#8201;g. amide or oxide) or &#963; donating electropositive atoms (e.&#8201;g. boryl or hydride). Besides the &#951;5&#8208;(methyl)cyclopentadienyl derivatives, high&#8208;valent &#951;1 carbon&#8208;ligated iridium complexes are challenging to synthesize. To meet this challenge, this work reports the oxidation behavior of an all&#8208;carbon&#8208;ligated anionic bis(CCC&#8208;pincer) IrIII complex. Being both &#963; and &#960; donating, the diaryl dipyrido&#8208;annulated N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (dpa&#8208;NHC) IrIII complex allowed a stepwise 4e&#8722; oxidation sequence. The first 2e&#8722; oxidation led to an oxidative coupling of two adjacent aryl groups, resulting in formation of a cationic chiral IrIII complex bearing a CCCC&#8208;tetradentate ligand. A further 2e&#8722; oxidation allowed isolation of a high&#8208;valent tricationic complex with a triplet ground state. These results close a synthetic gap for carbon&#8208;ligated iridium complexes and demonstrate the electronic tuning potential of organic &#960; ligands for unusual electronic properties.

         <title>Enhancing the Cycle Performance of Lithium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries by Coating the Separator with a Cation&#8208;Selective Polymer Layer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 63, November 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A delicately designed cation&#8208;selective polymer is synthesized and then coated on one side of the polypropylene separator in a lithium&#8208;sulfur battery, which can effectively obstruct the shuttling of negatively charged soluble polysulfides by the electrostatic repulsion of fixed anions on the backbone of the polymer with no influence on the passage of lithium&#8208;ion, thus remarkably elevating the battery's cycle performance.







Abstract
Lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries are believed to possess the feasibility to power electric vehicles in the future ascribed to the competitive energy density. However, soluble polysulfides continuously shuttle between the sulfur electrode and lithium anode across the separator, which dramatically impairs the battery's capacity. Herein, the surface of a polypropylene separator (PP film) is successfully modified with a delicately designed cation&#8208;selective polymer layer to suppress the transport of polysulfides. In principle, since bis&#8208;sulfonimide anions groups on the backbone of the polymer are immobilized, only cations can pass through the polymer layer. Furthermore, plenty of ethoxy chains in the polymer can facilitate lithium&#8208;ion mobility. Consequently, in addition to obstructing the movement of negatively charged polysulfides by the electrostatic repulsive force of fixed anions, the coated multi&#8208;functional layer on the PP film also guarantees the smooth conduction of lithium ions. The investigations demonstrate that the battery with the pristine PP film only delivers 228.5&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 300&#8197;cycles at 2&#8197;C with a high capacity fading rate of 60.9&#8201;%. By contrast, the polymer&#8208;coated sample can release 409.4&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 under the identical test condition and the capacity fading rate sharply declines to 43.2&#8201;%, illustrating superior cycle performance.

         <title>Thermally Activated Geometrical Regioselective E&#8594;Z Isomerization&#8208;Enabled Cascade Sequences of Conjugated Dienals: Experimental and DFT Studies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 63, November 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thermal isomerization&#8208;enabled cascade: Conjugated dienals undergo regioselective 2E,4E&#8594;2Z,4E alkene isomerization in a mixture of toluene&#8208;alcohol (2&#8201;:&#8201;1) or only with alcohol at 60&#8211;70&#8201;&#176;C, which enables subsequent cascade sequences to furnish &#947;&#8208;alkoxybutenolides. Density functional theory (DFT) studies have been employed to shed light on the feasibility of geometrical alkene isomerization and alcohol&#8208;assisted relay proton transfer mechanism for forming a hemiacetal intermediate prior to lactonization.







Abstract
The geometrical regioselective E&#8594;Z isomerization of a conjugated alkene under thermal activation pose a challenge due to microscopic reversibility. Herein we report that such reversibility issues can be circumvented by integrating E&#8594;Z isomerization with subsequent cyclization cascade, particularly in the absence of commonly employed light, acids, or metal&#8208;catalysts. Thus, linearly conjugated dienals in a mixture of toluene&#8208;alcohol (2&#8201;:&#8201;1) solvents or only with alcohol at 60&#8211;70&#8201;&#176;C can be converted to &#947;&#8208;alkoxybutenolides in moderate to good yields. The intermediary 2Z,4E&#8208;isomer can be isolated, which includes the first example of isolating the regioselective isomerization product under thermal conditions. Density functional theory (DFT) studies have been employed to shed light on the feasibility of geometrical alkene isomerization and ensuing cascade sequences. It has been observed that the regioselective 2E,4E&#8594;2Z,4E isomerization of dienal is a thermodynamically facile (&#916;G &lt;0) process. Structural elucidation further reveals that the presence of a certain charge transfer and a non&#8208;covalent interaction may be the primary reasons for the enhanced stability of the 2Z,4E&#8208;isomer. The thermodynamic plausibility of the subsequent cascade reaction from the Z&#8208;isomer to the anticipated product in the presence of a polar protic solvent (here MeOH) is also explicated. Out of the two probable pathways, the &#8220;hemiacetal pathway&#8221; involving a relay proton transfer is kinetically more feasible due to the diminished activation barrier than the &#8220;conjugate addition pathway&#8221;.

Precise modifications of cyclic titanium&#8208;oxo cluster: We report an efficient thiol&#8208;Michael addition approach for the precise modifications of cyclic titanium&#8208;oxo cluster (CTOC). This approach can afford high yields of fully functionalized CTOCs, which provides a powerful platform for achieving versatile functionalization of precise transition metal clusters and further applications.







Abstract
In expanding our research activities of superlattice engineering, designing new giant molecules is the necessary first step. One attempt is to use inorganic transition metal clusters as building blocks. Efficient functionalization of chemically precise transition metal clusters, however, remains a great challenge to material scientists. Herein, we report an efficient thiol&#8208;Michael addition approach for the modifications of cyclic titanium&#8208;oxo cluster (CTOC). Several advantages, including high efficiency, mild reaction condition, capability of complete addition, high atom economy, as well as high functional group tolerance were demonstrated. This approach can afford high yields of fully functionalized CTOCs, which provides a powerful platform for achieving versatile functionalization of precise transition metal clusters and further applications.

         <title>Catalytic Inhibition of Base&#8208;Mediated Reactivity by a Self&#8208;Assembled Metal&#8208;Ligand Host</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 63, November 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cationic Fe4L6 tetrahedral cages with suitably sized cavities can bind the conjugate acids of basic catalysts, favoring their protonation by exogenous water in the system. This allows the catalytic inhibition of base&#8208;mediated reactions in the presence of as little as 5&#8201;% added cage, such as conjugate addition and Knoevenagel reactions.







Abstract
Spacious M4L6 tetrahedra can act as catalytic inhibitors for base&#8208;mediated reactions. Upon adding only 5&#8201;% of a self&#8208;assembled Fe4L6 cage complex, the conversion of the conjugate addition between ethylcyanoacetate and &#946;&#8208;nitrostyrene catalyzed by proton sponge can be reduced from 83&#8201;% after 75 mins at ambient temperature to &lt;1&#8201;% under identical conditions. The mechanism of the catalytic inhibition is unusual: the octacationic Fe4L6 cage increases the acidity of exogenous water in the acetonitrile reaction solvent by favorably binding the conjugate acid of the basic catalyst. The inhibition only occurs for Fe4L6 hosts with spacious internal cavities: minimal inhibition is seen with smaller tetrahedra or Fe2L3 helicates. The surprising tendency of the cationic cage to preferentially bind protonated, cationic ammonium guests is quantified via the comprehensive modeling of spectrophotometric titration datasets.

Abstract
A mechanochemistry&#8208;driven practical and efficient synthetic protocol for accessing diverse series of biologically relevant poly&#8208;functionalized 5&#8208;(arylselanyl)&#8208;1H&#8208;1,2,3&#8208;triazoles through copper(I)&#8208;catalyzed click reaction between aryl/heteroaryl acetylenes, diaryl diselenides, benzyl bromides, and sodium azide has been accomplished under high&#8208;speed ball&#8208;milling. Advantages of this method include operational simplicity, avoidance of using solvent and external heating, one&#8208;pot synthesis, short reaction time in minutes, good to excellent yields, broad substrate scope, and gram&#8208;scale applications. Furthermore, synthesized organoselenium compounds were synthetically diversified to biologically promising selenones.

CO2 to methanol: Density functional theory calculations on the mechanism of the reduction of CO2 by H2 on an iron(II) center show the reaction to proceed through heterolytic cleavage of H2, whereby the ligand holds the proton during the reaction.







Abstract
CO2 utilization is an important process in the chemical industry with great environmental power. In this work we show how CO2 and H2 can be reacted to form methanol on an iron(II) center and highlight the bottlenecks for the reaction and what structural features of the catalyst are essential for efficient turnover. The calculations predict the reactions to proceed through three successive reaction cycles that start with heterolytic cleavage of H2 followed by sequential hydride and proton transfer processes. The H2 splitting process is an endergonic process and hence high pressures will be needed to overcome this step and trigger the hydrogenation reaction. Moreover, H2 cleavage into a hydride and proton requires a metal to bind hydride and a nearby source to bind the proton, such as an amide or pyrazolyl group, which the scorpionate ligand used here facilitates. As such the computations highlight the non&#8208;innocence of the ligand scaffold through proton shuttle from H2 to substrate as an important step in the reaction mechanism.

         <title>Synthesis and VCD Spectroscopic Characterization of a Series of Azacryptands from a Chiral Valine&#8208;Based Derivative of Tris(2&#8208;aminoethyl)amine (TREN)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 63, November 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We introduce three C3&#8208;symmetric azacryptands with chiral valine&#8208;based TREN headgroups. Their VCD spectroscopic characterization reveals that the computed lowest energy conformers of all three azacryptands are not favored in solution phase and that they prefer a collapsed conformation.







Abstract
Utilizing experimental and computational vibrational circular dichroism (VCD) spectroscopy, we explored the conformational preferences of a series of chiral C3&#8208;symmetric octaazacryptands with tris(2&#8208;aminoethyl)&#8208;amine head groups derived from valine. While the spectra of the smallest azacryptand with p&#8208;phenyl linkers and its elongated derivative with p&#8208;biphenyls linker were found to match well with the computed spectra, the computed conformational preferences of the m&#8208;biphenyl&#8208;based azacryptand did not seem to reflect the conformations dominating in chloroform solution. A detailed analysis revealed that structural changes resulting in a collapsed cage structure gave a notably better match with the experiment. It could subsequently be concluded from the VCD analysis, that the octaazacryptands prefer a collapsed structure, which is not predicted by density functional theory (DFT) calculations as the global minimum structures. These findings are expected to have consequences also for future studies on inclusion complexes of such azacryptands.

The large&#8208;scale synthesis of cycloparaphenylene building blocks is illustrated. It represents the different syntheses in continuous flow and how the building blocks can be assembled. The final robotic arm allows aromatization to the macrocyclic CPP ring; the color change showing that all the phenyl units are now the same.

Good anticancer activity is realized upon neutron irradiation by boron neutron capture therapy using 10B cluster&#8208;based nanodrugs. They consist of nanodiamonds and poly(glycerol&#8208;co&#8208;glyceric acid) conjugated by a 10B source (sodium borocaptate) and active targeting moiety (phenyl boronic acid or RGD peptide) through a multi&#8208;step organic transformation. Their cellular uptake might be facilitated by the negative charge of the boron cluster. More information can be found in the Research Article by M. Nishikawa, N. Komatsu, and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202302073).

         <title>Front Cover: Mechanism of CO2 Reduction to Methanol with H2 on an Iron(II)&#8208;scorpionate Catalyst (Chem. Eur. J. 63/2023)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 63, November 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reaction mechanism of a homogeneous catalyst that binds H2 and CO2 on an iron(II)&#8208;scorpionate complex has been investigated. Calculations show that the iron complex can heterolytically cleave H2 into a hydride and proton that bind on different sites of the complex. CO2 is then reduced through successive hydride and proton transfer steps to ultimately form methanol products. More information can be found in the Research Article by S.&#8197;P. de&#8197;Visser and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202302832).

A green way towards COF: In this review, we highlight the research advances in the preparation of COFs based on facile, less dangerous, and greener methods like performing the reaction at ambient temperature or employing aqueous solvents, ionic liquids, and a mixture of organic solvents/water.







Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs), as a new class of crystalline, well&#8208;ordered, and porous materials with intermittent constructions, are formed via organic structural parts connected through covalent bonds. These materials have been employed in several fields comprising pollutant adsorption and separation, catalysis, electrical conductivity, gas storage, etc. The preparation of COFs is mainly applied in tubes with high temperatures and degassing treatment. Furthermore, the reaction medium is involved in toxic organic solvents like toluene, dioxane, mesitylene, acetonitrile, and so on. Hence, discovering clean medium and green approaches has attracted wide attention. Recently, facile, less dangerous, and greener methods have been developed for COFs synthesis in diverse applications like performing the reaction at ambient temperature or employing aqueous solvents, ionic liquids, and a mixture of organic solvents/water. This review article summarizes the eco&#8208;friendly production approaches of COFs for diverse applications.

         <dc:description>
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with their customizable architectures and tunable pore functionalities present a significant potential to revolutionize membrane&#8208;based ion&#8208;separation processes. The focus of this Review is to offer a succinct, yet comprehensive discussion of how the unique features of COF membranes can be exploited in a range of ion&#8208;separation applications.







Abstract
Insufficient access to clean water and resources has emerged as one of the most pressing issues affecting people globally. Membrane&#8208;based ion separation has become a focal point of research for the generation of fresh water and the extraction of energy elements. This Review encapsulates recent advancements in the selective ion transport of covalent organic framework (COF) membranes, accomplished by strategically pairing diverse monomers to create membranes with various pore sizes and environments for specific purposes. We first discuss the merits of using COF materials as a basis for fabricating membranes for ion separation. We then explore the development of COF membranes in areas such as desalination, acid recovery, and energy element extraction, with a particular emphasis on the fundamental principles of membrane design. Lastly, we address both theoretical and practical challenges, as well as potential opportunities in the targeted design of ion&#8208;selective membranes. The goal of this Review is to stimulate future investigative efforts in this field, which is of significant scientific and strategic importance.

         <title>Customized Synthesis of MOF Nanoplates via Molecular Scalpel Strategy for Efficient Oxygen Reduction in Zn&#8722;Air Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The 2D MOF nanoplates from a layer&#8208;pillared 3D MOF is achieved, via a molecular scalpel strategy, by utilizing pyridine to replace 4,4&#8217;&#8208;bipyridine. The morphology can be modified from hexagonal nanorods to nanoplates with controllable thickness tuned by the amounts of pyridine. The annealed nanoplates display high ORR activity (0.88&#8197;V).







Abstract
The production of metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) nanoplates with well&#8208;defined geometric morphology is remarkable for expanding their applications. Herein, the cobalt&#8208;based MOF nanoplates with hexagonal channels from a layer&#8208;pillared MOF are accomplished, via a molecular scalpel strategy, utilizing monodentate pyridine to replace the bidentate 4,4&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine. The morphology can be modified from nanorods to nanoplates with controllable thickness tuned by the amounts of pyridine. Succeeding carbonization treatment transforms the MOF nanoplates into Co particles homogeneously encapsulated in the nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon layers. The prepared catalyst with a unique platelike morphology displays a high half&#8208;wave potential of 0.88&#8197;V in oxygen reduction reaction. When used in primary Zn&#8722;air batteries, it delivers a high peak power density of 280&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2. This work clarifies the structure&#8208;morphology&#8208;reactivity connection of MOF nanoplates.

         <title>The Field of Main Group Lewis Acids and Lewis Superacids: Important Basics and Recent Developments</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Essential basics of Donor&#8208;Acceptor (DA) interactions are presented to emphasize vital role of the Lewis acidity from weak intermolecular interactions to the strong DA complexes. Recent advances in synthesis and characterization of novel Lewis acids and Lewis superacids of group&#8197;2, 13, 14, and 15 elements are presented and discussed.







Abstract
New developments in the field of Lewis acidity are highlighted, with the focus of novel Lewis acids and Lewis superacids of group&#8197;2, 13, 14, and 15 elements. Several important basics, illustrated by modern examples (classification of Donor&#8208;Acceptor (DA) complexes, amphoteric nature of any compound in terms of DA interactions, reorganization energies of main group Lewis acids and the role of the energies of frontier orbitals) are presented and discussed. It is emphasized that the Lewis acidity phenomena are general and play vital role in different areas of chemistry: from weak &#8220;atomophilic&#8221; interactions to the complexes of Lewis superacids.

         <title>Exploration of the Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Sydnone and Sydnonimine&#8208;Alkyne Cycloaddition Reactions by High&#8208;Throughput Experimentation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;Throughput&#8208;Experimentation has been used to revisit the Cu&#8208;catalyzed Sydnone&#8208;Alkyne Cycloaddition reaction. The reaction has been improved and a new click&#8208;and&#8208;release reaction has been discovered.







Abstract
The reactivity of sydnones and sydnonimines toward terminal alkynes under copper catalysis has been explored using High&#8208;Throughput&#8208;Experimentation. A large panel of ligands and reaction conditions have been tested to optimize the copper&#8208;catalyzed sydnone click reaction discovered by our group ten years ago. This screening approach led to the identification of new ligands, which boosted the catalytic properties of copper and allowed the discovery of a new copper&#8208;catalyzed click&#8208;and&#8208;release reaction involving sydnonimines. This reaction allowed chemoselective ligation of terminal alkynes with sydnonimines and, simultaneously, the release of an isocyanate fragment molecule that can be used for further transformations.

We assembled photoresponsive mono&#8208; and bilayer systems with well&#8208;defined properties from rod&#8208;shaped molecules equipped with different photoswitches. Using properly chosen chromophores, we then selectively targeted layers made of the same types of photoswitches using appropriate monochromatic light.







Abstract
We assembled photoresponsive mono&#8208; and bilayer systems with well&#8208;defined properties from rod&#8208;shaped molecules equipped with different photoswitches. Using properly chosen chromophores (diarylethene&#8208;based switch and unidirectional light&#8208;driven molecular motor), we then selectively targeted layers made of the same types of photoswitches using appropriate monochromatic light. UV&#8208;vis analysis confirmed smooth and unrestricted photoisomerization. To achieve this, we synthesized a new class of triptycene&#8208;based molecular pedestals adept at forming sturdy Langmuir&#8208;Blodgett films on a water&#8208;air interface. The films were smoothly transferred to gold and quartz surfaces. Repeated deposition afforded bilayer systems: one layer containing diarylethene&#8208;based photoswitches and the other a unidirectional light&#8208;driven molecular motor. Structural analysis of both mono&#8208; and bilayer systems revealed the molecules to be tilted with carboxylic functions pointing to the surface. At least two different polymorphs differing in monolayer thickness and tilt angle (~40&#176; and ~60&#176;) were identified on the gold surface.

         <title>Fluorogen&#8208;Functionalized Mesoporous Silica Hybrid Sensing Materials: Applications in Cu2+ Detection</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fluorescent mesoporous silica materials (FMSMs) exhibit a series of significant advantages in sensing. FMSMs&#8208;based Cu2+ sensors have been well developed and widely applied in environmental and biological fields. In this review, the preparation methodologies, sensing mechanisms, and applications in solutions and biospecimens of FMSMs&#8208;based Cu2+ sensors are summarized and discussed in detail.







Abstract
Since Cu2+ ions play a pivotal role in both ecosystems and human health, the development of a rapid and sensitive method for Cu2+ detection holds significant importance. Fluorescent mesoporous silica materials (FMSMs) have garnered considerable attention in the realm of chemical sensing, biosensing, and bioimaging due to their distinctive structure and easily functionalized surfaces. As a result, numerous Cu2+ sensors based on FMSMs have been devised and extensively applied in environmental and biological Cu2+ detection over the past few decades. This review centers on the recent advancements in the methodologies for preparing FMSMs, the mechanisms underlying sensing, and the applications of FMSMs&#8208;based sensors for Cu2+ detection. Lastly, we present and elucidate pertinent perspectives concerning FMSMs&#8208;based Cu2+ sensors.

         <title>Binding Properties of Small Electrophilic Anions [B6X5]&#8722; and [B10X9]&#8722; (X=Cl, Br, I): Activation of Small Molecules Based on &#960;&#8208;Backbonding</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Small electrophilic anions [B6X5]&#8722; and [B10X9]&#8722; (X=Cl, Br, I) can bind and activate N2 and CO by performing &#960;&#8208;backdonation. This bond type is predicted by energy decomposition analysis and experimentally observed by the red shift of the bound N2/CO stretching frequency.







Abstract
Superelectrophilic anions constitute a special class of molecular anions that show strong binding of weak nucleophiles despite their negative charge. In this study, the binding characteristics of smaller gaseous electrophilic anions of the types [B6X5]&#8722; and [B10X9]&#8722; (with X=Cl, Br, I) were computationally and experimentally investigated and compared to those of the larger analogues [B12X11]&#8722;. The positive charge of vacant boron increases from [B6X5]&#8722; via [B10X9]&#8722; to [B12X11]&#8722;, as evidenced by increasing attachment enthalpies towards typical &#963;&#8208;donor molecules (noble gases, H2O). However, this behavior is reversed for &#963;&#8208;donor&#8211;&#960;&#8208;acceptor molecules. [B6Cl5]&#8722; binds most strongly to N2 and CO, even more strongly than to H2O. Energy decomposition analysis confirms that the orbital interaction is responsible for this opposite trend. The extended transition state natural orbitals for chemical valence method shows that the &#960;&#8208;backdonation order is [B6X5]&#8722;&gt;[B10X9]&#8722;&gt;[B12X11]&#8722;. This predicted order explains the experimentally observed red shifts of the CO and N2 stretching fundamentals compared to those of the unbound molecules, as measured by infrared photodissociation spectroscopy. The strongest red shift is observed for [B6Cl5N2]&#8722;: 222&#8197;cm&#8722;1. Therefore, strong activation of unreactive &#963;&#8208;donor&#8211;&#960;&#8208;acceptor molecules (commonly observed for cationic transition metal complexes) is achieved with metal&#8208;free molecular anions.

The artwork shows Kyiv's night in the heart of the city &#8211; Maidan Nezalezhnosti (central square of independence). A set of stellanes, like stars in the sky, can illuminate the way through the darkness of night, similar to science can drive us through the darkness of ignorance. The results reported in the manuscript demonstrate how a deeper understanding of the reaction's nature can help scientific developments shed light on regioselectivity, efficacy and productivity. The authors thank their colleague and very talented photographer, Mr. Andrii Yakymenko, for the original photo. More information can be found in the Research Article by D. M. Volochnyuk and S. V.

         <title>Isomeric Effect of a &#960; Bridge in an IDT&#8208;Based Nonfused Electron Photovoltaic Acceptor</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A pair of isomers, IDT&#8208;BOF containing S&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O/F&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H noncovalently configurational locks and IDT&#8208;BFO containing F&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H/O&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H noncovalently configurational locks, were synthesized and investigated. Although IDT&#8208;BOF exhibits a more red&#8208;shifted and broader absorption spectrum than IDT&#8208;BFO, IDT&#8208;BOF&#8208;based OSCs coupled with PBDB&#8208;T as donor materials exhibited a lower PCE than that of IDT&#8208;BFO.







Abstract
A pair of isomers, IDT&#8208;BOF containing S&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O/F&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H noncovalently configurational locks and IDT&#8208;BFO containing F&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H/O&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H noncovalently configurational locks, with an acceptor&#8208;&#960;&#8208;donor&#8208;&#960;&#8208;acceptor (A&#8208;&#960;&#8208;D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A) structure have been designed and synthesized by choosing 4,9&#8208;dihydro&#8208;s&#8208;indaceno[1,2&#8208;b&#8201;:&#8201;5,6&#8208;b&#8242;]dithiophene (IDT) as the D unit, an F/n&#8208;hexyloxy substituted phenyl ring as &#960; bridge, and 3&#8208;(dicyanomethylidene)indan&#8208;1&#8208;one as the A unit.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A pair of isomers, IDT-BOF containing S&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O/F&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H noncovalently configurational locks and IDT-BFO containing F&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H/O&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H noncovalently configurational locks, with an acceptor-&#960;-donor-&#960;-acceptor (A-&#960;-D-&#960;-A) structure have been designed and synthesized by choosing 4,9-dihydro-&lt;i&gt;s&lt;/i&gt;-indaceno[1,2-b&#8201;:&#8201;5,6-b&#8242;]dithiophene (IDT) as the D unit, an F/&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;-hexyloxy substituted phenyl ring as &#960; bridge, and 3-(dicyanomethylidene)indan-1-one as the A unit. Owing to the S&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O/F&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H or F&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H/O&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H noncovalently configurational locks, both IDT-BOF and IDT-BFO have a completely planar structure. IDT-BOF exhibits a similar LUMO to IDT-BFO, but higher HOMO energy levels, leading to a smaller optical bandgap and red-shifted absorption. However, IDT-BOF-based bulk-heterojunction organic solar cells (BHJ-OSCs) coupled with PBDB-T, and PCE-10 as donor materials both exhibited a lower PCE than that of IDT-BFO (PBDB-T: 5.2 vs. 6.1&#8201;%; PCE-10: 1.7 vs. 3.2&#8201;%). Comprehensively comparing and investigating IDT-BOF&#8201;:&#8201;PBDB-T and IDT-BFO&#8201;:&#8201;PBDB-T OSCs suggested that the large phase separation and serious charge recombination of IDT-BOF-based OSCs contributed to its lower power conversion efficiency. Importantly, ternary solar cells based on PBDB-T&#8201;:&#8201;Y5 as control devices with an additional 10&#8201;% IDT-BFO exhibited a 5&#8201;% enhancement in the PCE compared to the control device (14.3 vs. 13.46&#8201;%).&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Metal&#8208;free and Operationally Simple Radical Trifluoromethylative Borylation of Unactivated Alkenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We herein describe a protocol to synthesize trifluoromethyl boronates from alkenes by the mutual activation of the Togni II reagent and the bis(catecholato)diboron reagent in the absence of any catalyst and additives. This reaction enables synthesizing a series of trifluoromethyl alkyl boronates using unactivated alkenes, including natural products and drug derivatives, in a regioselective manner. Moreover, the synthetic utility of the boronic ester present in the product allows access to a range of trifluoromethyl containing compounds. The radical trapping and gas detection experiments reveal that the more Lewis acidic diboron reagent determines the rapid formation of trifluoromethyl and boron centered radicals.</dc:description>

         <title>Glycerol Oligomerization over Titania&#8208;Based Catalyst Compositions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The possibility of using TiO2&#8208;based compositions: individual and sulfated titania, and their composites with carbon nanotubes as catalysts for glycerol oligomerization has been displayed. The effect of modification of TiO2 with sulfur and carbon nanotubes on acid&#8208;base and catalytic characteristics in the glycerol conversion was investigated. The activation of glycerol on the catalysts has been studied using attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared (ATR&#8208;FTIR) spectroscopy. Only the samples based on sulfated titania are active over glycerol transformation, showing up to 58.7% conversion. This is explained by the presence of strong base sites. Glycerides up to pentaglycerides, both linear and nonlinear structure are formed by glycerol oligomerization over TiO2&#8208;S. The addition of nanotubes to the catalyst`s reduces both the glycerol conversion (up to 10.5%) and the yield of glycerides. However, the spectrum of the resulting products is significantly narrowed, increasing the selectivity for short&#8208;chain glycerides: the portion of diglycerides reaches 72%, and triglycerides 21%. Herewith, glycerides of a linear structure only formed.</dc:description>

         <title>Cooperation between p&#8208;Block Elements and Redox&#8208;Active Ligands: Stoichiometric and Catalytic Transformations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The relevance acquired by redox&#8208;active ligands in modern catalysis stems from their facile delivery and acceptance of electrons, either to the metal they coordinate or directly to an incoming substrate that also binds the central metal. Doing that, they generate coordinated radicals and provide access to more than one spin state during the catalytic cycle. As consequence, the new reaction barriers get reduced when compared to similar processes that are restricted to a single spin surface. The principles that govern this genuine approach to catalyst design are well&#8208;established, and their implementation has allowed the development of synthetically useful catalytic transformations; however, the extension of the concept to species in which p&#8208;block elements take the role of central atoms remains largely underdeveloped. Through the discussion of the key achievements and recent progress, this Concept Article highlights this original approach to design (organo)catalysts, discloses the progress achieved, and also reveals the many shortcomings still existing in the field.</dc:description>

         <title>A new look at the mechanism of cocrystal formation and coformers exchange in processes forced by mechanical and/or thermal stimuli &#8208; ex situ and in situ studies of low&#8208;melting eutectic mixtures.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Three different devices: ball&#8208;mill, hot stage melting, and magic angle spinning (MAS) NMR rotor were used for the preparation of ethenzamide (ET) cocrystals with glutaric acid (GLU), ethylmalonic acid (EMA) and maleic acid (MAL) as coformers. The common features of the solvent&#8208;free methods of cocrystal formation (grinding, melting) are presented on the basis of arguments obtained by solid state NMR spectroscopy. Thermal analysis proved that the eutectic phase arises over a wide range of molar ratios of components for each binary system. Experimental and theoretical methods allowed to provide details about the pathway of the reaction mechanism. It was found that the formation of ET cocrystals is a complex process that requires five steps. Variable temperature 1D and 2D MAS NMR experiments allowed to track physico&#8208;chemical processes taking place in a molten state. Moreover, it was found that in a multicomponent mixture consisting of ET, EMA, GLU, and MAL, ET in the molten phase behaves as a specific selector choosing only one partner to form binary cocrystals according to energy preferences. The stabilization energies (Estab) and molecular electrostatic potential (MEP) maps computed for the cocrystals and their individual components rationalize the selection rules and explain the relationships between individual species.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhancing the Potential of the Fused Heterocycle&#8208;Based Triarylhydrazone Photoswitches</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Triarylhydrazones represent an attractive class of photochromic compounds offering many interesting features including the high molar absorptivity, good addressability, and extraordinary thermal stability. In addition, unlike most of other hydrazone&#8208;based photoswitches they effectively absorb the light above 365&#160;nm. However, previously prepared triaryhydrazones suffer from low quantum yields of the &#119885;&#8594;&#119864; photoisomerization. Herein, we designed a new subclass of naphtoyl&#8208;benzothiazole hydrazones that balance the most beneficial features of previously reported naphthoyl&#8208;quinoline and benzoyl&#8208;pyridine triarylhydrazones. These preserve the attractive absorption characteristics, exhibit higher thermal stability of the metastable form than the former and enhance the rate of the &#119885;&#8594;&#119864; photoisomerization compared to the later, as a result of the weakening of the intramolecular hydrogen bonding between the hydrazone hydrogen and the benzothiazole moiety. The introducing of the benzothiazole motif extends the tunability of photochromic behaviour of hydrazone&#8208;based switches.</dc:description>

         <title>Acyclic Boryl Complexes of Copper(I)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A ring&#8208;expanded NHC, 6&#8208;Dipp ((6&#8208;Dipp=C{NDippCH2}2CH2, Dipp=2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3)), has been shown to support two acyclic boryls. Reaction of (6&#8208;Dipp)CuOtBu with B2(OMe)4 provided access to (6&#8208;Dipp)CuB(OMe)2, the first acyclic boryl of copper, which was shown to react similarly to its cyclic cousins. Remarkably, however, it could also be subjected to salt metathesis to access (6&#8208;Dipp)CuB(OMe)NMe2, the second acyclic boryl of copper.







Abstract
Reaction of (6&#8208;Dipp)CuOtBu (6&#8208;Dipp=C{NDippCH2}2CH2, Dipp=2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3) with B2(OMe)4 provided access to (6&#8208;Dipp)CuB(OMe)2 via &#963;&#8208;bond metathesis. (6&#8208;Dipp)CuB(OMe)2 was characterised by NMR spectroscopy and X&#8208;ray crystallography and shown to be a monomeric acyclic boryl of copper. (6&#8208;Dipp)CuB(OMe)2 reacted with ethylene and diphenylacetylene to provide insertion compounds into the Cu&#8208;B bond which were characterised by NMR spectroscopy in both cases and X&#8208;ray crystallography in the latter. It was also competent in the rapid catalytic deoxygenation of CO2 in the presence of excess B2(OMe)4. Alongside &#960;&#8208;insertion, (6&#8208;Dipp)CuB(OMe)2 reacted with LiNMe2 to provide a salt metathesis reaction at boron, giving (6&#8208;Dipp)CuB(OMe)NMe2, a second monomeric acyclic boryl, which also cuproborated diphenylacetylene. Computational interrogation validated these acyclic boryl species to be electronically similar to (6&#8208;Dipp)CuBpin.

         <title>Halogen Bonding Tripodal Metallo&#8208;Receptors for Phosphate Recognition and Sensing in Aqueous&#8208;Containing Organic Media</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of tris(iodotriazole)&#8208;containing halogen bonding (XB) tripodal ZnII metallo&#8208;receptors, strategically designed for tetrahedral anion guest binding, are demonstrated to selectively recognise inorganic phosphate over more basic, mono&#8208;charged oxoanions and the halides in aqueous solvent media. The XB metallo&#8208;receptors display augmented anion affinities compared to their tris(prototriazole)&#8208;containing hydrogen bonding (HB) counterparts. The attachment of redox&#8208;active ferrocene moieties at the XB and HB tripodal receptor termini facilitated complementary electrochemical anion sensing capability.







Abstract
The anion recognition and electrochemical anion&#8208;sensing properties of halogen&#8208;bonding (XB) tripodal zinc(II) receptors strategically designed and constructed for tetrahedral anion guest binding are described. The XB tris(iodotriazole)&#8208;containing hosts exhibit high affinities and selectivities for inorganic phosphate over other more basic, mono&#8208;charged oxoanions such as acetate and the halides in a competitive CD3CN/D2O (9&#8201;:&#8201;1 v/v) aqueous solvent mixture. 1H&#8197;NMR anion binding and electrochemical voltammetric anion sensing studies with redox&#8208;active ferrocene functionalised metallo&#8208;tripodal receptor analogues, reveal each of the XB tripods as superior anion complexants when compared to their tris(prototriazole)&#8208;containing, hydrogen bonding (HB) counterparts, not only exemplifying the halogen bond as a strong alternative interaction to the traditional hydrogen bond for molecular recognition but also providing rare evidence of the ability of XB receptors to preferentially bind the &#8220;harder&#8221; phosphate oxoanion over the &#8220;softer&#8221; and less hydrated halides in aqueous containing media.

         <title>Extremely Stable Perylene Bisimide&#8208;Bridged Regioisomeric Diradicals and Their Redox Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The partially conjugated connection via C&#8722;C single bonds between a PBI bridge and TTM segments can restrain the formation of closed&#8208;shell quinone resonance structures to obtain pure diradicals. The three building blocks not only keep their inherent characteristics but also exist electronic communication that causes distinct and reversible multistep redox processes and contributes to extremely high stability under ambient conditions.







Abstract
Excellent stability is an essential premise for organic diradicals to be used in organic electronic and spintronic devices. We have attached two tris(2,4,6&#8208;trichlorophenyl)methyl (TTM) radical building blocks to the two sides of perylene bisimide (PBI) bridges and obtained two regioisomeric diradicals (1,6&#8208;TTM&#8208;PBI and 1,7&#8208;TTM&#8208;PBI). Both of the isomers show super stability rather than the monomeric TTM under ambient conditions, due to the increased conjugation and the electron&#8208;withdrawing effects of the PBI bridges. The diradicals show distinct and reversible multistep redox processes, and a spectro&#8208;electrochemistry investigation revealed the generation of organic mixed&#8208;valence (MV) species during reduction processes. The two diradicals have singlet ground states, very small singlet&#8211;triplet energy gaps (&#916;ES&#8208;T) and a pure open&#8208;shell character (with diradical character y0=0.966 for 1,6&#8208;TTM&#8208;PBI and 0.967 for 1,7&#8208;TTM&#8208;PBI). This work opens a window to developing very stable diradicals and offers the opportunity of their further application in optical, electronic and magnetic devices.

         <title>Chiral and Achiral Crystal Structures of Au25(PET)180 Reveal Effects of Ligand Rotational Isomerization on Optoelectronic Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Analysis of all Au25(phenylethanethiol)18 crystal structures, including 2 novel clusters, reveals that ligand rotational angles are interdependent and constrained to a narrow range of values.







Abstract
The crystal structures of 4 ligand&#8208;rotational isomers of Au25(PET)18 are presented. Two new ligand&#8208;rotational isomers are revealed, and two higher&#8208;quality structures (allowing complete solution of the ligand shell) of previously solved Au25(PET)18 clusters are also presented. One of the structures lacks an inversion center, making it the first chiral Au25(SR)18 structure solved. These structures combined with previously published Au25(SR)18 structures enable an analysis of the empirical ligand conformation landscape for Au25(SR)18 clusters. This analysis shows that the dihedral angles within the PET ligand are restricted to certain observable values, and also that the dihedral angle values are interdependent, in a manner reminiscent of biomolecule dihedral angles such as those in proteins and DNA. The influence of ligand conformational isomerism on optical and electronic properties was calculated, revealing that the ligand conformations affect the nanocluster absorption spectrum, which potentially provides a way to distinguish between isomers at low temperature.

         <title>Sheet&#8208;Isolated MoS2 Used for Dispersing Pt Nanoparticles and its Application in Methanol Fuel Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The isolation of NMWCNTs weakens the &#960;&#8722;&#960; stacking, improves the conductivity, and activates basal planes of the MoS2 sheets. Consequently, the prepared Pt/NWMCNTs&#8208;solated&#8208;MoS2 realizes excellent bifunctional catalytic performance for MOR and ORR.







Abstract
It is highly challenging to activate the basal plane and minimize the &#960;&#8722;&#960; stacking of MoS2 sheets, thus enhancing its catalytic performance. Here, we display an approach for making well&#8208;dispersed MoS2. By using the N&#8208;doped multi&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes (NMWCNTs) as an isolation unit, the aggregation of MoS2 sheets was effectively reduced, favoring the dispersion of Pt nanoparticles (noted as Pt/NMWCNTs&#8208;isolated&#8208;MoS2). Excellent bifunctional catalytic performance for methanol oxidation and oxygen reduction reaction (MOR/ORR) were demonstrated by the produced Pt/NMWCNTs&#8208;isolated&#8208;MoS2. In comparison to Pt nanoparticles supported on MoS2 (Pt/MoS2), the MOR activity (2314.14&#8197;mA&#8201;mgpt&#8722;1) and stability (317.69&#8197;mA&#8201;mgpt&#8722;1 after 2&#8197;h of operation) on Pt/NMWCNTs&#8208;isolatedMoS2 were 24 and 232 times higher, respectively. As for ORR, Pt/NMWCNTs&#8208;isolated&#8208;MoS2 holds large half&#8208;wave potential (0.88&#8197;V) and high stability (92.71&#8201;% after 22&#8197;h of operation). This work presents a tactic for activating the basal planes and reducing the &#960;&#8722;&#960; stacking of 2D materials to satisfy their applications in electrocatalysis. In addition, the proposed sheet&#8208;isolation method can be used for fabricating other 2D materials to promote the dispersion of nanoparticles, which assist its application in other fields of energy as well as the environment.

&lt;p&gt;The isolation of NMWCNTs weakens the &#960;&#8722;&#960; stacking, improves the conductivity, and activates basal planes of the MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; sheets. Consequently, the prepared Pt/NWMCNTs-solated-MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; realizes excellent bifunctional catalytic performance for MOR and ORR.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is highly challenging to activate the basal plane and minimize the &#960;&#8722;&#960; stacking of MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; sheets, thus enhancing its catalytic performance. Here, we display an approach for making well-dispersed MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. By using the N-doped multi-walled carbon nanotubes (NMWCNTs) as an isolation unit, the aggregation of MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; sheets was effectively reduced, favoring the dispersion of Pt nanoparticles (noted as Pt/NMWCNTs-isolated-MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;). Excellent bifunctional catalytic performance for methanol oxidation and oxygen reduction reaction (MOR/ORR) were demonstrated by the produced Pt/NMWCNTs-isolated-MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. In comparison to Pt nanoparticles supported on MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (Pt/MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), the MOR activity (2314.14&#8197;mA&#8201;mg&lt;sub&gt;pt&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) and stability (317.69&#8197;mA&#8201;mg&lt;sub&gt;pt&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; after 2&#8197;h of operation) on Pt/NMWCNTs-isolatedMoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; were 24 and 232 times higher, respectively. As for ORR, Pt/NMWCNTs-isolated-MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; holds large half-wave potential (0.88&#8197;V) and high stability (92.71&#8201;% after 22&#8197;h of operation).

         <title>Visible Light Activates Coumarin&#8208;Caged mRNA for Cytoplasmic Cap Methylation in Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A 5&#8242; cap with coumarin at the N7G was prepared in two different ways. It can be used to make mRNAs and to activate the process of cytoplasmic cap methylation in cells by visible light.







Abstract
Protein synthesis is important and regulated by various mechanisms in the cell. Translation initiation in eukaryotes starts at the 5&#8242; cap and is the most complex of the three phases of mRNA translation. It requires methylation of the N7 position of the terminal guanosine (m7G). The canonical capping occurs in the nucleus, however, cytoplasmic recapping has been discovered. It functions in switching mRNAs between translating and non&#8208;translating states, but the individual steps are difficult to dissect. We targeted cytoplasmic cap methylation as the ultimate step of cytoplasmic recapping. We present an N7G photocaged 5&#8242; cap that can be activated for cytoplasmic methylation by visible light. We report chemical and chemo&#8208;enzymatic synthesis of this 5&#8242; cap with 7&#8208;(diethylamino)&#8208;4&#8208;methyl&#8208;coumarin (DEACM) at the N7G and validate that it is not bound by translation initiation factor 4E (eIF4E). We demonstrate incorporation into mRNA, the release of unmethylated cap analog and enzymatic remethylation to functional cap 0 after irradiation at 450&#8197;nm. In cells, irradiation triggers translation of mRNAs with the N7G photocaged 5&#8242; cap via cytoplasmic cap methylation.

         <title>Polyfluoroalkyl Chain&#8208;Based Assemblies for Biomimetic Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polyfluoroalkyl chain&#8208;based TACN derivatives were developed to lower their CAC in the presence of equimolar amount of Zn2+ ions to drive the self&#8208;assembly and afford high catalytic activity towards the hydrolysis reaction of HPNP, demonstrating the robustness of F&#8208;chain assemblies, compared with their perhydroalkyl chain counterparts.







Abstract
Amphiphobic fluoroalkyl chains are exploited for creating robust and diverse self&#8208;assembled biomimetic catalysts. Long terminal perfluoroalkyl chains (CnF2n+1 with n=6, 8, and 10) linked with a short perhydroalkyl chains (CmH2m with m=2 and 3) were used to synthesize several 1,4,7&#8208;triazacyclononane (TACN) derivatives, CnF2n+1&#8208;CmH2m&#8208;TACN. In the presence of an equimolar amount of Zn2+ ions that coordinate the TACN moiety and drive the self&#8208;assembly into micelle&#8208;like aggregates, the critical aggregation concentration of polyfluorinated CnF2n+1&#8208;CmH2m&#8208;TACN&#8901;Zn2+ was lowered by &#8764;1 order of magnitude compared to the traditional perhyroalkyl counterpart with identical carbon number of alkyl chain. When 2&#8217;&#8208;hydroxypropyl&#8208;4&#8208;nitrophenyl phosphate was used as the model phosphate substrate, polyfluorinated CnF2n+1&#8208;CmH2m&#8208;TACN&#8901;Zn2+ assemblies showed higher affinity and catalytic activity, compared to its perhyroalkyl chain&#8208;based counterpart. Coarse&#8208;grained molecular dynamic simulations have been introduced to explore the supramolecular assembly of polyfluoroalkyl chains in the presence of Zn2+ ions and to better understand their enhanced catalytic activity.

         <title>New Protocol for the Synthesis of S&#8208;Thioesters from Benzylic, Allylic and Tertiary Alcohols with Thioacetic Acid</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reaction of activated alcohols with neat thioacetic acid catalyzed by HBF4 provides a convenient entry into thioacetates, protected version of the corresponding thiols; the generation of intermediate acetates and thionoacetates and the mechanism of their further conversion to the final products has been fully rationalized.







Abstract
A new one&#8208;pot solvent&#8208;less reaction to convert benzylic, allylic, ferrocenyl or tertiary alcohols into S&#8208;thioesters, bench&#8208;stable and less odorous precursors of the corresponding thiols, which is based on reactions in neat thioacetic acid in the presence of tetrafluoroboric acid, is presented. Reaction monitoring by NMR and GC of the benzyl alcohol conversion indicated the intermediate formation of benzyl acetate and benzyl thionoacetate (PhCH2OC(S)CH3) prior to the slower conversion to the final S&#8208;benzyl thioacetate product. Increasing the HBF4 concentration enhanced the reaction rate, giving good to excellent yield (up to 99&#8201;%) for a large scope of alcohols. Control experiments, with support of DFT calculations, have revealed a thermodynamically favorable, though requiring HBF4&#8208;activation, disproportionation of CH3C(O)SH to CH3C(O)OH and CH3C(S)SH, the latter immediately decomposing to H2S and (MeC)4S6 but also generating the hitherto unreported [MeC(O)C(Me)S]2(&#956;&#8208;S)2. Kinetic investigations demonstrated that the rate of benzyl alcohol conversion is second&#8208;order in [PhCH2OH] and second order in [HBF4], while the rate of conversion of the benzyl acetate intermediate to S&#8208;benzyl thioacetate is second order in [PhCOOMe] and fourth order in [HBF4]. The DFT calculations rationalize the need to two alcohol molecules and two protons to generate the reactive benzyl cation.

         <title>Fluorinated Benzimidazole&#8208;Linked Highly Conjugated Polymer Enabling Covalent Polysulfide Anchoring for Stable Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Economical sulfur in p&#8208;block is valuable for charge storage, but dissolves in electrolytes, limiting battery use. Fluorine&#8208;substituted benzimidazole polymer, treated with S8 via SNAr, anchors polysulfides for electrochemical redox&#8208;activity. Sulfurized polymer electrodes mitigate polysulfide shuttle in Li&#8722;S batteries and enable eco&#8208;friendly Al&#8722;S batteries. The strategy involves the chemistry of p&#8208;block elements such as C, N, S, Al, F, and Cl.







Abstract
Sulfur is one of the most abundant and economical elements in the p&#8208;block family and highly redox active, potentially utilizable as a charge&#8208;storing electrode with high theoretical capacities. However, its inherent good solubility in many electrolytes inhibits its accessibility as an electrode material in typical metal&#8208;sulfur batteries.

&lt;p&gt;Economical sulfur in p-block is valuable for charge storage, but dissolves in electrolytes, limiting battery use. Fluorine-substituted benzimidazole polymer, treated with S&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; via S&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;Ar, anchors polysulfides for electrochemical redox-activity. Sulfurized polymer electrodes mitigate polysulfide shuttle in Li&#8722;S batteries and enable eco-friendly Al&#8722;S batteries. The strategy involves the chemistry of p-block elements such as C, N, S, Al, F, and Cl.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sulfur is one of the most abundant and economical elements in the p-block family and highly redox active, potentially utilizable as a charge-storing electrode with high theoretical capacities. However, its inherent good solubility in many electrolytes inhibits its accessibility as an electrode material in typical metal-sulfur batteries. In this work, the synthetically designed fluorinated porous polymer, when treated with elemental sulfur through a well-known nucleophilic aromatic substitution mechanism (S&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;Ar), allows for the covalent integration of polysulfides into a highly conjugated benzimidazole polymer by replacing the fluorine atoms. Chemically robust benzimidazole linkages allow such harsh post-synthetic treatment and facilitate the electronic activation of the anchored polysulfides for redox reactions under applied potential. The electrode amalgamated with sulfurized polymer mitigates the so-called polysulfide shuttle effect in the lithium-sulfur (Li&#8722;S) battery and also enables a reversible, more environmentally friendly, and more economical aluminum-sulfur (Al&#8722;S) battery that is configured with mostly p-block elements as cathode, anode, and electrolytes. The improved cycling stabilities and reduction of the overpotential in both cases pave the way for future sustainable energy storage solutions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Direct Lithium Extraction Using Intercalation Materials</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Intercalation materials have shown promise for ion selective recovery of lithium from aqueous resources. These materials have demonstrated high ion selectivity, excellent adsorption capacity, relatively low chemical consumption and waste generation, and scale&#8208;up possibilities. Lithium extraction techniques involving intercalation materials are reviewed, as well as the adsorption kinetics associated with those techniques.







Abstract
Worldwide lithium demand has surged in recent years due to increased production of Li&#8208;ion batteries for electric vehicles and stationary storage. Li supply and production will need to increase such that the transition towards increased electrification in the energy sector does not become cost prohibitive. Many countries have taken policy steps such as listing Li as a critical mineral. Current commercial Li mining is mostly from dedicated mine sources, including ores, clays, and brines. The conventional ways to extract Li+ from those resources are through chemical processing and includes steps of calcination, leaching, precipitation, and purification. The environmental and economic sustainability of conventional Li processing has recently received increased scrutiny. Routes such as direct Li+ extraction may provide advantages relative to conventional Li+ extraction technologies, and one possible route to direct Li+ extraction includes leveraging intercalation materials. Intercalation material processing has recently demonstrated high selectivity towards Li+ as opposed to other cations. Reviews and reports of direct Li+ extraction with intercalation materials are limited, even as this technology has started to show promise in smaller&#8208;scale demonstrations. This paper will review selective Li+ extraction via intercalation materials, including both electrochemical and chemical methods to drive Li+ in and out, and efforts to characterize the Li+ insertion/deinsertion processes.

We describe a facile protocol for constructing all carbon quaternary, tertiary carbon&#8208;centered spiro[4.4]nonanes and spiro[4.5]decanes by treating cheap dimethylacetylenedicarboxylate with 2&#8208;(2&#8242;&#8208;ketoalkyl)&#8208;1,3&#8208;indandiones and 2&#8208;(3&#8242;&#8208;ketoalkyl)&#8208;1,3&#8208;indandiones, respectively. Additionally, spiro[4.4]nonane products were further transformed into highly conjugated pentafulvene&#8208;based dyes simply by treating them with TFA or H2SO4. The reported method provides an excellent yield and ample tunability around the fulvene skeleton under metal&#8208;free conditions.







Abstract
Synthesis of highly functionalized spiro[4.4]nonane and spiro[4.5]decane motifs by the reaction of dimethylacetylenedicarboxylate (DMAD) with 2&#8208;(2&#8242;&#8208;ketoalkyl)&#8208;1,3&#8208;indandiones and 2&#8208;(3&#8242;&#8208;ketoalkyl)&#8208;1,3&#8208;indandiones, respectively, has been developed by utilizing a catalytic amount of DABCO. The tertiary hydroxy&#8208;containing spiro[4.4]nonane products were converted into fully conjugated pentafulvene &#960;&#8208;systems in an acidic medium through dehydration and unprecedented C&#8722;C bond rearrangement.

         <title>Revealing the Origin of Fast Delayed Fluorescence in a Donor Functionalized Bisterpyridine</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two different, extremely short fluorescence lifetimes were found for a new carbazole&#8208;substituted bisbipyridine. Various methods, including tempered TCSPC, DFT and NMR spectroscopy were used to show the presence of two rotamers. These can transition into each other after optical excitation, causing two temporally different fluorescence events.







Abstract
A new carbazole&#8208;substituted bisterpyridine with pronounced delayed fluorescence is presented. While the molecular donor&#8208;acceptor&#8208;donor design suggests the origin of this to be thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF), results from various photophysical characterizations, OLED characteristics, temperature&#8208;dependent NMR spectroscopy, and DFT calculations all point against the involvement of triplet states. The molecule exhibits blue emission at about 440&#8197;nm with two or more fast decay channels in the lower nanosecond range in both solution and thin films. The delayed emission is proposed to be caused by rotational vibrational modes. We suggest that these results are generally applicable, especially for more complex molecules, and should be considered as alternative or competitive emissive relaxation pathways in the field of organic light emitting materials.

Hydrogen bond&#8208;assisted H&#8208;aggregate: Our work focuses on the investigation of two functionalized naphthyridine derivatives, namely ODIN&#8208;EtPh and ODIN&#8208;But, to gain insights into the hydrogen bond&#8208;assisted H&#8208;aggregate formation and its impact on the optical properties of ODIN molecules.

Abstract
The current work focuses on the investigation of two functionalized naphthyridine derivatives, namely ODIN&#8208;EtPh and ODIN&#8208;But, to gain insights into the hydrogen bond&#8208;assisted H&#8208;aggregate formation and its impact on the optical properties of ODIN molecules. By employing a combination of X&#8208;ray and electron crystallography, absorption and emission spectroscopy, time resolved fluorescence and ultrafast pump&#8208;probe spectroscopy (visible and infrared) we unravel the correlation between the structure and light&#8208;matter response, with a particular emphasis on the influence of the polarity of the surrounding environment. Our experimental results and simulations confirm that in polar and good hydrogen&#8208;bond acceptor solvents (DMSO), the formation of dimers for ODIN derivatives is strongly inhibited. The presence of a phenyl group linked to the ureidic unit favors the folding of ODIN derivatives (forming an intramolecular hydrogen bond) leading to the stabilization of a charge&#8208;transfer excited state which almost completely quenches its fluorescence emission. In solvents with a poor aptitude for forming hydrogen bonds, the formation of dimers is favored and gives rise to H aggregates, with a consequent considerable reduction in the fluorescence emission. The urea&#8208;bound phenyl group furtherly stabilizes the dimers in chloroform.

         <title>Bimetallic Manganese Catalysts: A Route to Controlled and Switchable Polymerization of Lactones</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bimetallic Salen&#8208;Mn catalysts with biaryl&#8208;linkers were developed for ring&#8208;opening polymerization of lactide and &#1013;&#8208;caprolactone. Advanced activity and the iso&#8208;selective tendency towards lactide are determined by catalyst conformation and Mn&#8722;Mn separation. Finally, the CO2&#8208;controlled switchable polymerization succeeded in this catalytic system, in which the on&#8208;off reversibility is related to the combination between active species and CO2 molecules.







Abstract
The sustainable solution to the environmental problem of polymeric materials calls for efficient and well&#8208;controlled ring&#8208;opening polymerization catalytic systems. Inspired by the highly reactive and stereospecific bimetallic catalysts, three kinds of bimetallic Salen&#8208;Mn catalysts supported by biaryl linking moieties are synthesized and applied to polymerization catalysis of lactide (LA) and &#1013;&#8208;caprolactone (&#1013;&#8208;CL) in this work. The polymerization is initiated in&#8197;situ by the ring&#8208;opening of epoxide compounds, in which the ionic cocatalyst could accelerate the reaction process. The Mn&#8722;Mn coordination effect contributes to the higher activity and iso&#8208;selectivity towards LA compared to the mononuclear Salen&#8208;Mn catalyst. The reactivity and stereoselectivity are determined by the conformation of catalysts, specifically the Mn&#8722;Mn separation and dihedral angle. Finally, the CO2&#8208;controlled switchable polymerizations are carried out with LA and &#1013;&#8208;CL. The reversibility of the on&#8208;off switching operation is influenced by the combination between CO2 molecules and active species. The success in binuclear Salen&#8208;Mn catalysts not only expands the range of bimetallic catalyst analogues but also claims the promising potential of Mn&#8208;based catalysts in practical and theoretical research.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Bimetallic Salen-Mn catalysts&lt;/b&gt; with biaryl-linkers were developed for ring-opening polymerization of lactide and &#1013;-caprolactone. Advanced activity and the iso-selective tendency towards lactide are determined by catalyst conformation and Mn&#8722;Mn separation. Finally, the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-controlled switchable polymerization succeeded in this catalytic system, in which the on-off reversibility is related to the combination between active species and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; molecules.

Unraveling the mysteries of ring current combinations in polycyclic benzenoid hydrocarbons.







Abstract
Nowadays, an active research topic is the connection between Clar's rule, aromaticity, and magnetic properties of polycyclic benzenoid hydrocarbons. In the present work, we employ a meticulous magnetically induced current density analysis to define the net current flowing through any cyclic circuit, connecting it to aromaticity based on the ring current concept. Our investigation reveals that the analyzed polycyclic systems display a prominent global ring current, contrasting with subdued semi&#8208;local and local ring currents. These patterns align with Clar's aromatic &#960;&#8208;sextets only in cases where migrating &#960;&#8208;sextet structures are invoked. The results of this study will enrich our comprehension of aromaticity and magnetic behavior in such systems, offering significant insights into coexisting ring current circuits in these systems.

Three in one: The interplay of three redox&#8208;active diguanidinobenzene units in hexaguanidino&#8208;triptycene and triphenylene molecules affects the redox&#8208;chemistry of the free and coordinated molecules.







Abstract
Novel redox&#8208;active hexaguanidine molecules with multiple redox states were synthesized by connecting three o&#8208;diguanidinobenzene units. In 2,3,6,7,14,15&#8208;hexaguanidino&#8208;triptycenes, the three redox&#8208;active o&#8208;diguanidinobenzene units are connected through C&#8722;C bonds to the sp3&#8208;hybridized bridgehead C atoms, and in 2,3,6,7,10,11&#8208;hexaguanidino&#8208;triphenylenes they are directly connected. The connectivity difference leads to different electronic coupling between the three redox&#8208;active o&#8208;diguanidinobenzene units, with homoconjugation being present in the triptycene, but not in the triphenylene compounds. Motivated by the appearance of an intense low&#8208;energy electronic transition, we especially analysed the effect of homoconjugation on the electronic structure and charge delocalization in the dicationic redox state of the triptycene derivatives. Then, several trinuclear high&#8208;spin cobalt (and copper) complexes were synthesized with the triphenylene and triptycene ligands, and the magnetic coupling and redox properties analysed. By choice of the coligands (hexafluoroacetylacetonate, trifluoroacetylacetonate and acetylacetonate), oxidation could be switched between metal&#8208; and ligand&#8208;centered redox events, leading to drastic changes in the magnetic or optical properties, especially as a consequence of homoconjugation in the triptycene derivatives.

         <dc:description>We present an in&#8208;depth study of the sterically demanding Cp synthon (8&#8208;H&#8208;GuaH)Li isolated from natural product guaiazulene as a ligand transfer reagent towards late transition metal complex precursors. The synthesis and full characterization of selected, essentially unexplored homo&#8208; and heteroleptic 8&#8208;H&#8208;guaiazulenide complexes of iron, ruthenium, cobalt, rhodium, platinum, copper and zinc are discussed in detail. In order to demonstrate their potential in catalytic applications, [(GuaH)PtMe3] was selected. The latter proved an even higher catalytic activity in light induced olefin hydrosilylation at catalyst loads as low as 5 ppm than classical [CpPtMe3] in a typical test reaction of silicone elastomer fabrication. Our results demonstrate that traditional petrochemical based Cp metal chemistry and catalysis can be replaced, sometimes even outmatched by superior catalysts based on cheap building blocks from renewable feedstock.</dc:description>

         <title>Robust Spin Liquidity in 2D Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Cu3(HHTP)2 with S = &#189; Kagome Lattice</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>On the one hand electron or hole doping of quantum spin liquid (QSL) may unlock high&#8208;temperature superconductivity and on the other hand it can disrupt the spin liquidity giving rise to a magnetically ordered ground state. Recently, a 2D MOF, Cu3(HHTP)2&#160;(HHTP &#8208; 2,3,6,7,10,11&#8208;hexahydroxytriphenylene), containing Cu(II) S = &#189; frustrated spins in the Kagome lattice is emerging as a promising QSL candidate. Herein, we present an elegant in situ redox&#8208;chemistry strategy of anchoring Cu3(HHTP)2&#160;crystallites onto diamagnetic reduced graphene oxide (rGO) sheets, resulting in the formation of electron&#8208;doped Cu3(HHTP)2&#8208;rGO composite which exhibited semiconducting behavior (5 K to 300 K) with high electrical conductivity of 70 S&#8729;m&#8208;1&#160;and a carrier density of ~1.1 &#215; 1018&#160;cm&#8208;3&#160;at 300 K. Remarkably, no magnetic transition in the Cu3(HHTP)2&#8208;rGO composite was observed down to 1.5 K endorsing the robust spin liquidity of the 2D MOF Cu3(HHTP)2. Specific heat capacity measurements led to the estimation of the residual entropy values of 28% and 34% of the theoretically expected value for the pristine Cu3(HHTP)2&#160;and Cu3(HHTP)2&#8208;rGO composite, establishing the presence of strong quantum fluctuations down to 1.5 K (two times smaller than the value of the exchange interaction J).</dc:description>

         <title>Unraveling the Push&#8208;Pull Effect in Acenes, Polyenes and Polyynes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Substituent effects (SEs) are fundamental for predicting molecular reactivity, while polyene, polyyne and acene derivatives are precursors to compounds with diverse applications. Computations were performed for Y&#8208;R&#8208;X systems, where reaction sites Y = NO2 and O&#8722;, substituents X = NO2, CN, Cl, H, OH, NH2, and spacers R = polyene, polyyne (n=1&#8208;5, 10 repeating units) and acene (up to tetracene). The cSAR (charge of the substituent active region) approach allowed to present, for the first time, quantitative relations describing the spacer&#8217;s electron&#8208;donating and withdrawing properties as a function of n and the spacer type. The electronic properties of the X substituents depend on the type of spacer, its length and the Y group, which is an example of the reverse SE. To describe how the SE between Y and X weakens with n, two approaches were compared: cSAR and SESE (SE stabilization energy). The EDDB (electron density of delocalized bonds) characterize changes in electron delocalization in spacers due to the SE. A new approach &#8211; EDDB differential maps &#8211; allow to extract the effect of X substitution on the electron delocalization. The charges at spacer&#8217;s C atoms correlate with cSAR; changes in the slopes confirm the charge transfer by resonance.</dc:description>

The cSAR (charge of the substituent active region) approach allowed to present, for the first time, quantitative relations describing the spacer&#8217;s electron-donating and withdrawing properties as a function of n and the spacer type. The electronic properties of the X substituents depend on the type of spacer, its length and the Y group, which is an example of the reverse SE. To describe how the SE between Y and X weakens with n, two approaches were compared: cSAR and SESE (SE stabilization energy). The EDDB (electron density of delocalized bonds) characterize changes in electron delocalization in spacers due to the SE. A new approach &#8211; EDDB differential maps &#8211; allow to extract the effect of X substitution on the electron delocalization. The charges at spacer&#8217;s C atoms correlate with cSAR; changes in the slopes confirm the charge transfer by resonance.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Cyclotriveratrylene Solvent Dependent Chiral Switch</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chiral molecular switches are attracting attention as they could pave the way to chiral molecular machines. Herein, we report on the design and synthesis of a single molecule chiral switch based on a cyclotriveratrylene scaffold, in which the chirality inversion is controlled by the solvent. Hemicryptophanes are built around a C3 cyclotriveratrylene chiral unit, with either M or P handedness, connected to another tripod and usually displaying an &#8220;out&#8221; configuration. Here, we demonstrate that solvents are able to control the &#8220;in&#8221; and &#8220;out&#8221; configurations of the CTV unit, creating a molecular switch from (M/P)&#8221;in&#8221; to (P/M)&#8221;out&#8221; handedness. The full characterization of the &#8220;in&#8221; and &#8220;out&#8221; configurations and of the chirality switch were made possible by combining NMR, HPLC, ECD, DFT and molecular dynamics. Interestingly, bulky aromatic solvents such as 2&#8208;t&#8208;butylphenol favor the &#8220;in&#8221; configuration while polar aprotic solvents such as acetone favor the &#8220;out&#8221; configuration. This switch was found to be fully reversible allowing the system to oscillate between two different M and P configurations several times upon the action of solvents stimuli.</dc:description>

         <title>Sulfur&#8208; and Amine&#8208; Promoted Multielectron Autoredox Transformation of Nitromethane: Multicomponent Access to Thiourea Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Thiourea derivatives are in&#8208;demand motifs in organic synthesis, medicinal chemistry and material science, yet redox methods for the synthesis that start from safe, simple, inexpensive and readily available feedstocks are scarce. In this article, we disclose the synthesis of these motifs using elemental sulfur and nitromethane as the starting materials. The method harnesses the multi&#8208;electron auto&#8208;redox property of nitromethane in the presence of sulfur and amines, delivering thiourea products without any added oxidant or reductant. Extension of this reaction to cyclizable amines and/or higher homologues of nitromethane led to a wide range of nitrogen heterocycles and thioamides. Operationally simple, the reactions are scalable, tolerate a wide range of functional groups, and can be employed for the direct functionalization of natural products. Mechanistically, the nitro group was found to act as an oxidant leaving group, being reduced to ammonia whereas sulfur, along with the role of a sulfur building block for the thiocarbonyl group, behaved as a complementary reductant, being oxidized to sulfate.</dc:description>

         <title>Reversible Reactions of Nitric Oxide With a Binuclear Iron(III) Nitrophorin Mimic</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Construction of functional synthetic systems that can reversibly bind and transport the most biologically important gaseous molecules, oxygen and nitric oxide (NO), remains a contemporary challenge. Myoglobin and nitrophorin perform these respective tasks employing a protein&#8208;embedded heme center where one axial iron site is occupied by a histidine residue and the other is available for small molecule ligation, structural features that are extremely difficult to mimic in protein&#8208;free environments. Indeed, the hitherto reported designs rely on sophisticated multistep syntheses for limiting access to one of the two axial coordination sites in small molecules. We have shown previously that binuclear Ga(III) and Al(III) corroles have available axial sites, and now report a redox&#8208;active binuclear Fe(III) corrole, (1&#8208;Fe)2, in which each (corrolato)Fe(III) center is 5&#8208;coordinate, with one axial site occupied by an imidazole from the other corrole. The binuclear structure is further stabilized by attractive forces between the corrole &#960; systems. Reaction of NO with (1&#8208;Fe)2 affords mononuclear iron nitrosyls, and of functional relevance, the reaction is reversible: nitric oxide is released upon purging the nitrosyls with inert gases, thereby restoring (1&#8208;Fe)2 in solutions or films.</dc:description>

         <title>Development of novel redox&#8208;active organic materials based on benzimidazole, benzoxazole, and benzothiazole &#8211; a combined theoretical and experimental screening approach</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sustainability is one of the hot topics of todays&#8217; research, in particular when it comes to energy storage systems such as batteries. Redox&#8208;active molecules implemented in organic batteries represent a promising alternative to lithium&#8208;ion batteries, which partially rely on non&#8208;sustainable heavy metal salts. As an alternative, we propose benzothiazole, &#8208;oxazole and &#8208;imidazole derivatives as redox&#8208;active moieties for polymers in organic (radical) batteries. The target mole&#173;cules have been identified by a combination of theoretical and experimental approaches for the investigation of new organic active materials. Herein, we present the synthesis, electrochemical cha&#173;rac&#173;terization and theoretical investigation of the proposed molecules, which can later be introduced into a polymer backbone and utilized in organic polymer batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of &#960;&#8208;Conjugated Chiral Aza/Boracyclophanes with a meta and para Substitution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We herein describe the synthesis of a new class of axially chiral aza/boracyclophanes (BDN1, BXN1, BDB1 and BXB1) using binaphthyls as chiral building blocks and the main&#8208;group (B/N) chemistry with tunable electronic effects. All macrocycles substituted with triarylamine donors or triarylborane acceptors are strongly luminescent. These macrocycles showed two distinct meta and para &#960;&#8208;conjugation pathways, leading to the formation of quasi figure&#8208;of&#8208;eight and square&#8208;shaped conformations. Interestingly, comparison of such structural models revealed that the former type of macrocycles BXN1 and BXB1 gave higher racemization barriers relative to the other ones. The results reported here may provide a new approach to engineer the optical stability of &#960;&#8208;conjugated chiral macrocycles by controlling &#960;&#8208;substitution patterns. The ring constraints induced by macrocyclization were also demonstrated to contribute to the configurational persistence as compared with the open&#8208;chain analoguesp&#8208;BTT and m&#8208;BTT.</dc:description>

         <title>Breaking radial dipole symmetry in planar macrocycles modulates edge&#8208;edge packing and disrupts cofacial stacking</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dipolar interactions are ever&#8208;present in supramolecular architectures though their impact is typically revealed by making dipoles stronger. While it is also possible to assess the role of dipoles by altering their orientations using synthetic design, doing so without altering molecular shape is not straightforward. We do this by flipping one triazole unit in a rigid macrocycle, tricarb. The macrocycle is composed of three carbazoles (2 Debye) and three triazoles (5 Debye) defining an array of dipoles aligned radially but organized alternately in and out. These dipoles are believed to dictate edge&#8208;to&#8208;edge tiling and face&#8208;to&#8208;face stacking. We modified our synthesis to prepare isosteric macrocycles with the orientation of one triazole dipole rotated 40&#176;. The new dipole orientations guide edge&#8208;edge contacts to reorder the stability of two surface&#8208;bound 2D polymorphs. The impact on dipole&#8208;enhanced &#960; stacking, however, was unexpected. Our stacking model identified an unchanged set of short&#8208;range (3.4 &#197;) anti&#8208;parallel dipole contacts. Despite this situation, the reduction in self&#8208;association was attributed to long&#8208;range (~6.4 &#197;) dipolar repulsions between &#960;&#8208;stacked macrocycles. This work highlighted our ability to control the build&#8208;up and symmetry of macrocyclic skeletons by synthetic design, and the work needed to further our understanding of how dipoles control self&#8208;assembly.</dc:description>

Despite this situation, the reduction in self-association was attributed to long-range (~6.4 &#197;) dipolar repulsions between &#960;-stacked macrocycles. This work highlighted our ability to control the build-up and symmetry of macrocyclic skeletons by synthetic design, and the work needed to further our understanding of how dipoles control self-assembly.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Simple Synthesis of 1,2&#8208;Dideoxy&#8208;2&#8208;Vinyl Carbohydrates by Tin&#8208;Free Radical Reactions of Xanthates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Radical and non&#8208;toxic: C&#8208;Branched carbohydrates 3 are easily available from glycals 1 via xanthates 2. Key step is a radical reaction with triethylborane, which proceeds under mild conditions with high regioselectivity. Various side products have been isolated in pure form. They speak for a reversible ring&#8208;opening of the intermediary cyclopropylmethyl radicals, which is interesting for the mechanistic understanding of such reactions.







Abstract
Vinyl&#8208;substituted carbohydrates have been synthesized from glycals derived from hexoses and pentoses. Key step is the radical reaction of xanthates in the presence of triethylborane, a non&#8208;toxic reagent. The mechanism has been investigated by isolation of various side products, which speak for a reversibility of the cyclopropylmethyl radical ring&#8208;opening. Compared to reactions with tributyltin hydride, higher regioselectivities in favor of the 2&#8208;vinyl&#8208;substituted sugars have been obtained. Yields are slightly lower with triethylborane, but all products have been isolated in analytically pure form. The new reaction is applicable to benzyl&#8208; and silyl&#8208;protected carbohydrates, which makes free sugars accessible as well. Overall, more than 15 1,2&#8208;dideoxy&#8208;2&#8208;vinyl carbohydrates have been synthesized from simple precursors in only few steps.

         <title>Catalyst&#8208;Free Transfer Hydrogenation from Amine&#8208;Borane Small Oligomers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Small hydrogen&#8208;rich amine&#8208;borane oligomers were prepared via capping agent&#8208;controlled AA/BB polycondensation. Solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy, Differential Scanning Calorimetry and reactivity in catalyst&#8208;free transfer hydrogenations &#8211; to aldehydes, imines, electron&#8208;poor alkenes and alkynes &#8211; were used to assess how the oligomers bridge the gap between molecular amine&#8208;boranes and poly(amine&#8208;borane)s.







Abstract
Amine&#8208;borane dimers and oligomers with varied steric and electronic profiles were prepared via capping agent&#8208;controlled AA/BB polycondensations. They were used for transfer hydrogenations to aldehydes, ketones, imines as well as electron&#8208;poor alkene/alkyne moieties. The amine&#8208;borane Lewis&#8208;paired oligomers and the congested bis(amine&#8208;borane)s provided the highest yields. This was likely helped by facilitated dissociation (oligomers) or H&#8208;bond assistance. In the case of the oligomers, the second equivalent of H2 present was also engaged in the reaction. Solid&#8208;state NMR characterization provides evidence that the boron&#8208;containing materials obtained after transfer dehydrogenation are highly similar to those obtained from thermal dehydrogenation. The oligomers bridge the gap between simple amine&#8208;borane molecular reductants and the poly&#8208;amine&#8208;boranes and provide a full picture of the reactivity changes at the different scales.

         <title>Single Atom Stabilization of Phosphinate Ester&#8208;Containing Rhodamines Yields Cell Permeable Probes for Turn&#8208;On Photoacoustic Imaging
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We describe an approach to stabilize NIR absorbing rhodamine dyes containing phosphinate esters, affording cell permeable photoacoustic probes with maximal absorbance in the range of commercial instrumentation. A derivative of our optimal dye can used for turn&#8208;on detection of a disease relevant analyte in living cells and mice.







Abstract
Photoacoustic imaging (PAI) is an emerging imaging technique that uses pulsed laser excitation with near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light to elicit local temperature increases through non&#8208;radiative relaxation events, ultimately leading to the production of ultrasound waves. The classical xanthene dye scaffold has found numerous applications in fluorescence imaging, however, xanthenes are rarely utilized for PAI since they do not typically display NIR absorbance. Herein, we report the ability of Nebraska Red (NR) xanthene dyes to produce photoacoustic (PA) signal and provide a rational design approach to reduce the hydrolysis rate of ester containing dyes, affording cell permeable probes. To demonstrate the utility of this approach, we construct the first cell permeable rhodamine&#8208;based, turn&#8208;on PAI imaging probe for hypochlorous acid (HOCl) with maximal absorbance within the range of commercial PA instrumentation. This probe, termed SNR700&#8208;HOCl, is capable of detecting exogenous HOCl in mice. This work provides a new set of rhodamine&#8208;based PAI agents as well as a rational design approach to stabilize esterified versions of NR dyes with desirable properties for PAI. In the long term, the reagents described herein could be utilized to enable non&#8208;invasive imaging of HOCl in disease&#8208;relevant model systems.

         <title>Hydrazine Sulfonic Acid, NH3NH(SO3), the Bigger Sibling of Sulfamic Acid</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydrazine sulfonic acid has been structurally elucidated for the first time. Like its smaller congener, sulfamic acid, the acid crystallizes as a zwitterion in the solid state. The hydrazine sulfonate anion is accessible by deprotonation, as demonstrated for Ba[N2H3(SO3)]2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;H2O.







Abstract
The reaction of hydrazine hydrate, N2H4&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;H2O, and SO3 leads to hydrazine sulfonic acid (Pca21, a=849.59(4)&#8197;pm, b=482.18(2)&#8197;pm, c=832.17(4)&#8197;pm). Structure elucidation reveals the zwitter&#8208;anionic nature of the compound according to NH3NH(SO3). With the barium salt Ba[NH2NH(SO3)]2(H2O), a first salt of hydrazine sulfonic acid has been prepared (P

         <title>Effects of Fluorinated Functionalization of Linker on Quercetin Encapsulation, Release and Hela Cell Cytotoxicity of Cu&#8208;Based MOFs as Smart pH&#8208;Stimuli Nanocarriers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two copper&#8208;based MOFs, Cu2(BDC)2DABCO and Cu2(F4BDC)2DABCO, as smart carriers of Quercetin (QU), with high loading potential and sustained release of Quercetin, were synthesized and investigated for their potential as pH stimulus nanocarriers of QU as an anticancer agent. Their interactions with QU were investigated through Grand Canonical Monte Carlo simulation calculations. Cytotoxicity was evaluated by MTT assays against HEK&#8208;293 and HeLa cell lines. Also, kinetic models of release were evaluated.







Abstract
Controlled delivery of target molecules is required in many medical and chemical applications. For such purposes, metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs), which possess desirable features such as high porosity, large surface area, and adjustable functionalities, hold great potential as drug carriers. Herein, Quercetin (QU), as an anticancer drug, was loaded on Cu2(BDC)2(DABCO) and Cu2(F4BDC)2)DABCO) MOFs (BDC=1,4&#8208;benzenedicarboxylate and DABCO=1,4&#8208;diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane). As these Cu&#8208;MOFs have a high surface area, an appropriate pore size, and biocompatible ingredients, they can be utilized to deliver QU. The loading efficiency of QU in these MOFs was 49.5&#8201;% and 41.3&#8201;%, respectively. The drug&#8208;loaded compounds displayed sustained drug release over 15&#8197;days, remarkably high drug loading capacities and pH&#8208;controlled release behavior. The prepared nanostructures were characterized by different characterization technics including FT&#8208;IR, PXRD, ZP, TEM, FE&#8208;SEM, UV&#8208;vis, and BET. In addition, MTT assays were carried out on the HEK&#8208;293 and HeLa cell lines to investigate cytotoxicity. Cellular apoptosis analysis was performed to investigate the cell death mechanisms. Grand Canonical Monte Carlo simulations were conducted to analyze the interactions between MOFs and QU. Moreover, the stability of MOFs was also investigated during and after the drug release process. Ultimately, kinetic models of drug release were evaluated.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Controlled delivery of target molecules is required in many medical and chemical applications. For such purposes, metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs), which possess desirable features such as high porosity, large surface area, and adjustable functionalities, hold great potential as drug carriers. Herein, Quercetin (QU), as an anticancer drug, was loaded on Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(BDC)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(DABCO) and Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(F&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;BDC)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)DABCO) MOFs (BDC=1,4-benzenedicarboxylate and DABCO=1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane). As these Cu-MOFs have a high surface area, an appropriate pore size, and biocompatible ingredients, they can be utilized to deliver QU. The loading efficiency of QU in these MOFs was 49.5&#8201;% and 41.3&#8201;%, respectively. The drug-loaded compounds displayed sustained drug release over 15&#8197;days, remarkably high drug loading capacities and pH-controlled release behavior. The prepared nanostructures were characterized by different characterization technics including FT-IR, PXRD, ZP, TEM, FE-SEM, UV-vis, and BET. In addition, MTT assays were carried out on the HEK-293 and HeLa cell lines to investigate cytotoxicity. Cellular apoptosis analysis was performed to investigate the cell death mechanisms.

         <title>Photo&#8208;Induced C&#8722;H Methylation Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this review, we present a concise overview of recent breakthroughs in photochemical C&#8722;H methylation. These advancements encompass a variety of methodologies, including transition metal&#8208;based photocatalysis, organophotocatalysis, and various metal&#8208;free approaches, such as electron donor&#8208;acceptor &#8208;enabled processes.







Abstract
Direct C&#8722;H methylation is a highly valuable approach for introducing methyl groups into organic molecules, particularly in pharmaceutical chemistry. Among the various methodologies available, photo&#8208;induced methylation stands out as an exceptional choice due to its mild reaction conditions, energy efficiency, and compatibility with functional groups. This article offers a comprehensive review of photochemical strategies employed for the direct and selective methylation of C(sp3)&#8722;H, C(sp2)&#8722;H, and C(sp)&#8722;H bonds in various organic molecules. The discussed methodologies encompass transition&#8208;metal&#8208;based photocatalysis, organophotocatalysis, as well as other metal&#8208;free approaches, including electron donor&#8208;acceptor (EDA)&#8208;enabled transformations. Importantly, a wide range of easily accessible agents such as tert&#8208;butyl peroxide, methanol, DMSO, methyl tert&#8208;butyl ether, TsOMe, N&#8208;(acetoxy)phthalimide, acetic acid, methyl halides, and even methane can serve as effective methylating reagents for modifying diverse targets. These advancements in photochemical C&#8722;H methylation are anticipated to drive further progress in the fields of organic synthesis, photocatalysis, and pharmaceutical development, opening up exciting avenues for creating novel organic molecules and discovering new drug compounds.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Free Covalent Organic Frameworks for the Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal&#8208;free COFs: Catalytic skeletons, linkages and edges have been employed to construct metal&#8208;free covalent organic frameworks for the oxygen reduction reaction. By tuning the COFs&#8217; electronic states, the corresponding catalytic properties can be precisely modulated, which provides new insight into designing such electrocatalysts at the molecular&#8208;level.







Abstract
The oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is the key reaction in metal air and fuel cells. Among the catalysts that promote ORR, carbon&#8208;based metal&#8208;free catalysts are getting more attention because of their maximum atom utilization, effective active sites and satisfactory catalytic activity and stability. However, the pyrolysis synthesis of these carbons resulted in disordered porosities and uncontrolled catalytic sites, which hindered us in realizing the catalysts&#8217; design, the optimization of catalyst performance and the elucidation of structure&#8211;property relationship at the molecular level. Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) constructed with designable building blocks have been employed as metal&#8208;free electrocatalysts for the ORR due to their controlled skeletons, tailored pores size and environments, as well as well&#8208;defined location and kinds of catalytic sites. In this Concept article, the development of metal&#8208;free COFs for the ORR is summarized, and different strategies including skeletons regulation, linkages engineering and edge&#8208;sites modulation to improve the catalytic selectivity and activity are discussed. Furthermore, this Concept provides prospectives for designing and constructing powerful electrocatalysts based on the catalytic COFs.

         <title>Mechanochemical Oxidative Coupling of Amine to Azo&#8208;based Polymers by Hypervalent Iodine Oxidant</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthetic strategy of azo&#8208;based polymers is tedious and limited to liquid&#8208;phase synthesis. In most cases, the explosion is inevitable when hypervalent iodine in direct contacts with primary amines, which further restricts the solid&#8208;state synthesis. Inspired by the principle of &#8220;rule of six&#8221;, it is feasible to construct azo&#8208;based polymers by hypervalent iodine oxidant in ball milling process.







Abstract
Among porous organic polymers (POPs), azo&#8208;linked POPs represent a crucial class of materials, making them the focus of numerous catalytic systems proposed for their synthesis. However, the synthetic process is limited to metal&#8208;catalyzed, high&#8208;temperature, and liquid&#8208;phase reactions. In this study, we employ mechanochemical oxidative metal&#8208;free systems to encompass various syntheses of azo&#8208;based polymers. Drawing inspiration from the &#8220;rule of six&#8221; principle (six or more carbons on an azide group render the organic compound relatively safe), an azo compound featuring significant steric hindrance is obtained using the hypervalent iodine oxidation strategy. Furthermore, during the polymerization process, steric hindrance is enhanced in monomers to effectively prevent explosions resulting from direct contact between hypervalent iodine oxidants and primary amines. Indeed, this approach provides a facile and innovative solid&#8208;phase synthesis method for synthesizing azo&#8208;based materials.

         <title>Conformational Studies of &#946;&#8208;Azapeptoid Foldamers: A New Class of Peptidomimetics with Confined Dihedrals</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Controlling amide bond geometries and the secondary structures of &#946;&#8208;peptoids is a challenging task as they contain several rotatable single bonds in their backbone. Herein, we describe the synthesis and conformational properties of novel &#8220;&#946;&#8208;azapeptoids&#8221; with confined dihedrals. We discuss how the acylhydrazide sidechains in these molecules enforce trans amide geometries (&#969; ~ 180&#8304;) via steric and stereoelectronic effects. We also show that the &#920;(C&#945;&#8208;C&#946;) and &#936;(OC&#8208;C&#945;) backbone torsions of &#946;&#8208;azapeptoids occupy a narrow range (170&#8208;180&#8304;) that can be rationalized by the staggered conformational preference of the backbone methylene carbons and a novel backbone nO &#8594; &#963;*C&#946;&#8208;N interaction discovered in this study. However, the &#966; (C&#946;&#8208;N) torsion remains freely rotatable and, depending on &#966;, the sidechains can be parallel, perpendicular, and anti&#8208;parallel relative to each other. In fact, we observed parallel and perpendicular relative orientations of sidechains in the crystal geometries of &#946;&#8208;azapeptoid dimers. We show that &#966; of &#946;&#8208;azapeptoids can be controlled by incorporating a bulky substituent at the backbone &#946;&#8208;carbon, which could provide complete control over all the backbone dihedrals. Finally, we show that the &#966; and &#936; dihedrals of &#946;&#8208;azapeptoids resemble that of a PPII helix and they retain&#160;PPII structure when incorporated in Host&#8208;Guest proline peptides.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Solar energy utilization has gained considerable attention due to its abundance and renewability. However, its intermittent nature presents a challenge in harnessing its full potential. The development of energy storing compounds capable of capturing and releasing solar energy on demand has emerged as a potential solution. These compounds undergo a photochemical transformation that results in a high&#8208;energy metastable photoisomer, which stores solar energy in the form of chemical bonds and can release it as heat when required. Such systems are referred to as MOlecular Solar Thermal (MOST)&#8208;systems. Although the photoisomerization of MOST systems has been vastly studied, its back&#8208;conversion, particularly using heterogeneous catalysts, is still underexplored and the development of effective catalysts for releasing stored energy is crucial. Herein we compare the performance of 27 heterogeneous catalysts releasing the stored energy in an efficient Norbornadiene/Quadricyclane (NBD/QC) MOST system. We report the first benchmarking of heterogeneous catalysts for a MOST system using a robust comparison method of the catalysts&#8217; activity and monitoring the conversion using UV&#8208;Visible (UV&#8208;Vis) spectroscopy. Our findings provide insights into the development of effective catalysts for MOST systems. We anticipate that our assay will reveal the necessity of further investigation on heterogeneous catalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Enzymatic Synthesis of Diterpenoids from iso&#8208;GGPP III: A Geranylgeranyl Diphosphate Analog with Shifted Double Bond</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The analog of the diterpene precursor geranylgeranyl diphosphate with a double bond shifted from C14=C15 to C15=C16 (named iso&#8208;GGPP III) was synthesised and enzymatically coverted with six bacterial diterpene synthases, which allowed for the isolation of nine non&#8208;natural diterpenes. For some of the enzyme&#8208;substrate combinations the different reactivity implemented in the substrate analog iso&#8208;GGPP opened reaction pathways that are impossible with natural GGPP, resulting in the formation of diterpenes with novel skeletons. A stereoselective deuteration strategy was used to assign the absolute configurations of the isolated diterpenes.</dc:description>

         <title>Thermochromic Hydrogels with Opaque&#8208;Transparent Gradient Transition for Switchable Window and Temperature Monitor</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydrogels with gradient opaque&#8208;transparent transition thermochromic temperature from 5&#8201;&#176;C to 53&#8201;&#176;C were prepared and the accuracy was controlled at 1&#8201;&#176;C. The thermochromic property was regulated by the aggregation state of sodium dodecyl sulfate micelles by adding potassium tartrate hemihydrate and cations. The thermochromic hydrogel can serve for smart window and temperature detector/monitor.







Abstract
In recent years, the thermochromic hydrogel was acted as suitable sandwiching material to adjust light transmission. However, to accurately control the thermochromic temperature in a wide range still was a significant challenge. Here, a simple method was explored to prepare hydrogels with gradient opaque&#8208;transparent transition thermochromic temperature from 5&#8201;&#176;C to 53&#8201;&#176;C, which was regulated by the aggregation state of sodium dodecyl sulfate micelles by adding potassium tartrate hemihydrate and cations. Using Li+, Na+, and K+ as cations, the accuracy was controlled at 1&#8201;&#176;C. Moreover, the transmittance of the hydrogel was not changed when the thermochromic temperature was adjusted. As a result, an intelligent window was fabricated by utilizing thermochromic hydrogel as a sandwiching layer into the outer glass layers, which could effectively and stably regulate the visible and infrared light. The temperature monitors/detectors were also designed, which showed excellent temperature monitoring/detecting ability. Therefore, this low&#8208;cost, high&#8208;efficient, large&#8208;scale prepared thermochromic hydrogel provided more potential for intelligent temperature devices.

         <title>Optimization of 3D Synthetic Scaffolds for Neuronal Tissue Engineering Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The increasing prevalence of neurodegenerative diseases has prompted researchers to develop advanced three&#8208;dimensional models that accurately mimic neuronal tissues. In this regard, the synthesis of an acrylamide&#8208;based hydrogel incorporating the peptide sequence arginine&#8208;glycine&#8208;aspartic acid has been carried out, examined in depth the matrix properties that govern cell behavior.







Abstract
The increasing prevalence of neurodegenerative diseases has spurred researchers to develop advanced 3D models that accurately mimic neural tissues. Hydrogels stand out as ideal candidates as their properties closely resemble those of the extracellular matrix. A critical challenge in this regard is to comprehend the influence of the scaffold&#8216;s mechanical properties on cell growth and differentiation, thus enabling targeted modifications. In light of this, a synthesis and comprehensive analysis of acrylamide&#8208;based hydrogels incorporating a peptide has been conducted. Adequate cell adhesion and development is achieved due to their bioactive nature and specific interactions with cellular receptors. The integration of a precisely controlled physicochemical hydrogel matrix and inclusion of the arginine&#8208;glycine&#8208;aspartic acid peptide sequence has endowed this system with an optimal structure, thus providing a unique ability to interact effectively with biomolecules. The analysis fully examined essential properties governing cell behavior, including pore size, mechanical characteristics, and swelling ability. Cell&#8208;viability experiments were performed to assess the hydrogel's biocompatibility, while the incorporation of grow factors aimed to promote the differentiation of neuroblastoma cells. The results underscore the hydrogel's ability to stimulate cell viability and differentiation in the presence of the peptide within the matrix.

         <title>Synthesis of Bridged Tetrazoles with Promising Properties and Potential Applications by a One&#8208;Step Finkelstein Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Several new nitramine&#8208; and oxa&#8208;bridged bis&#8208;tetrazolyl energetic materials were synthesized and fully characterized. The thermal behavior of all compounds was studied and their sensitivities towards impact (IS) and friction (FS) determined. Energetic properties, were calculated using the EXPLO5 (V6.06.01) computer code. In particular, 1,3&#8208;bis&#8208;2,2&#8217;&#8208;nitrotetrazolylnitrazapropane and 1,7&#8208;bis&#8208;2,2&#8217;&#8208;tetrazolyltrinitrazaheptane show promising properties for use as RDX replacements.







Abstract
Numerous nitramine bridged compounds which show promising combinations of properties have already been identified in the area of energetic materials. In this work, four new nitrazapropane bridged tetrazoles, as well as four new trinitrazaheptane tetrazoles and three oxapropane bridged tetrazoles were synthesized and fully characterized. These new compounds can all be synthesized by a simple, one&#8208;step synthesis using Finkelstein conditions. All of these new energetic materials were characterized using NMR spectroscopy, single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, vibrational analysis and elemental analysis. The thermal behaviour of these compounds was studied by differential thermal analysis (DTA) and partly by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). The BAM standard method was used to determine the sensitivities towards impact (IS) and friction (FS). The enthalpies of formation were calculated at the CBS&#8208;4M level, and the energetic performances were calculated using the EXPLO5 (V6.06.01) computer code. The properties of the new compounds were compared to each other as well as to the known energetic material RDX. Moreover, the iron(II) and copper(II) perchlorate complexes with 1,3&#8208;bis&#8208;1,1&#8208;tetrazolylnitrazapropane as ligand were prepared and investigated.

         <title>Mechanochemical Scholl Reaction on Phenylated Cyclopentadiene Core: One&#8208;Step Synthesis of Fluoreno[5]helicenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fluoreno[5]helicenes are prepared in the solid state in one synthetic step from commercially available phenylated cyclopentadiene precursors in high isolated yields using a ball milling mechanochemical technique.







Abstract
In this study, we explore feasibility of the mechanochemical approach in the synthesis of tetrabenzofluorenes (fluoreno[5]helicenes). For this, commercially available phenylated cyclopentadiene precursors are subjected to the Scholl reaction in the solid state using FeCl3 as an oxidant and sodium chloride as the solid reaction medium. This ball milling process gave access to the 5&#8208;membered ring containing&#8208;helicenes in one synthetic step in high (95&#8211;96&#8201;%) isolated yields. The solution&#8208;phase reactions, however, were found to be moderate to low yielding in this regard (10&#8211;40&#8201;%).

For this, commercially available phenylated cyclopentadiene precursors are subjected to the Scholl reaction in the solid state using FeCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; as an oxidant and sodium chloride as the solid reaction medium. This ball milling process gave access to the 5-membered ring containing-helicenes in one synthetic step in high (95&#8211;96&#8201;%) isolated yields. The solution-phase reactions, however, were found to be moderate to low yielding in this regard (10&#8211;40&#8201;%).&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Molecular Accessibility and Diffusion of Resorufin in Zeolite Crystals</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Resorufin has been investigated as a fluorescent probe for 3D microimaging in microporous materials. Understanding the processes, such as aggregation, that affect the measured fluorescence intensity enables the probe to be used to measure real&#8208;time diffusion, microporosity, and accessibility in zeolite&#8208;&#946; crystals.







Abstract
We have used confocal laser scanning microscopy on the small, fluorescent resorufin dye molecule to visualize molecular accessibility and diffusion in the hierarchical, anisotropic pore structure of large (~10&#8197;&#956;m&#8208;sized) zeolite&#8208;&#946; crystals. The resorufin dye is widely used in life and materials science, but only in its deprotonated form because the protonated molecule is barely fluorescent in aqueous solution. In this work, we show that protonated resorufin is in fact strongly fluorescent when confined within zeolite micropores, thus enabling fluorescence microimaging experiments. We find that J&#8208;aggregation guest&#8211;guest interactions lead to a decrease in the measured fluorescence intensity that can be prevented by using non&#8208;fluorescent spacer molecules. We characterized the pore space by introducing resorufin from the outside solution and following its diffusion into zeolite&#8208;&#946; crystals. The eventual homogeneous distribution of resorufin molecules throughout the zeolite indicates a fully accessible pore network. This enables the quantification of the diffusion coefficient in the straight pores of zeolite&#8208;&#946; without the need for complex analysis, and we found a value of 3&#215;10&#8722;15&#8197;m2&#8197;s&#8722;1. Furthermore, we saw that diffusion through the straight pores of zeolite&#8208;&#946; is impeded when crossing the boundaries between zeolite subunits.

         <title>Hauser&#8208;Kraus Annulation Initiated Multi&#8208;Cascade Reactions for Facile Access to Functionalized and Fused Oxazepines, Carbazoles and Phenanthridinediones</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The Hauser&#8208;Kraus (H&#8208;K) annulation of N&#8208;unsubstituted 3&#8208;olefinic oxindoles with 3&#8208;nucleophilic phthalides triggers a cascade of ring expansion and ring contraction reactions through several regioselective steps in one pot. While oxazepines were isolated in the presence of stoichiometric amounts of base at room temperature, carbazoles and phenanthridinediones were the products in the presence of excess base and microwave irradiation. Mechanistic studies guided by stepwise reactions and control experiments revealed that the isolable oxazepine intermediate, formed via ring expansion of the H&#8208;K adduct, is the key precursor to carbazole and phenanthridinedione via decarboxylative regioselective cyclizations.</dc:description>

         <title>Coordination Engineering of Heteronuclear Fe&#8208;Mo Dual&#8208;Atom Catalyst for Promoted Electrocatalytic Nitrogen Fixation: A DFT Study</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing efficient nanostructured electrocatalysts for N2 reduction to NH3 under mild conditions remains a major challenge. The Fe&#8208;Mo cofactor serves as the archetypal active site in nitrogenase. Inspired by nitrogenase, we designed a series of heteronuclear dual&#8208;atom catalysts (DACs) labeled as FeMoN6&#8208;aXa (a =1, 2, 3; X = B, C, O, S) anchored on the pore of g&#8208;C3N4 to probe the impact of coordination on FeMo&#8208;catalyzed nitrogen fixation. The stability, reaction paths, activity, and selectivity of 12 different FeMoN6&#8208;aXaDACs have been systematically studied using density functional theory. Of these, four DACs (FeMoN5B1, FeMoN5O1, FeMoN4O2, and FeMoN3C3) displayed promising nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) performance. Notably, FeMoN5O1 stands out with an ultralow limiting potential of &#8722;0.11 V and high selectivity. Analysis of the density of states and charge/spin changes shows FeMoN5O1's high activity arises from optimal N2 binding on Fe initially and synergy of the FeMo dimer enabling protonation in NRR. This work contributes to the advancement of rational design for efficient NRR catalysts by regulating atomic coordination environments.</dc:description>

         <title>Are &#8216;carbon dots&#8217; always carbon dots? Evidence for their supramolecular nature from structural and dynamic studies in solution and in the pure solid</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A model for the morphology (size, shape, and crystallinity) of carbon dots (CDs) in solid state consistent with the observed photoluminescence in solution is herein proposed. Overwhelming evidence has been collected which links the data coming from solid state analysis (high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), atomic force microscopy (AFM), and matrix&#8208;assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) mass spectrometry (MS)) to that of solution (pulsed field gradient (PFG)&#8208;nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, time&#8208;resolved fluorescence anisotropy (TRFA), and steady&#8208;state/time&#8208;resolved fluorescence), allowing the establishment of an overall structural model for CDs. According to this model, the so&#8208;called carbon dots, observed under HRTEM imaging, are in fact supramolecular organized structures dynamically assembled from small to medium size molecular species when removing the solvent to obtain the solid form. In this way, the imaged nanoparticles (TEM/AFM) are not covalently bound entities formed during the synthetic process, but instead supramolecular entities formed by noncovalent interactions. These particles, if at all present in solution, have the form of loose associations of relatively small molecules.

Overwhelming evidence has been collected which links the data coming from solid state analysis (high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), atomic force microscopy (AFM), and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) mass spectrometry (MS)) to that of solution (pulsed field gradient (PFG)-nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, time-resolved fluorescence anisotropy (TRFA), and steady-state/time-resolved fluorescence), allowing the establishment of an overall structural model for CDs. According to this model, the so-called carbon dots, observed under HRTEM imaging, are in fact supramolecular organized structures dynamically assembled from small to medium size molecular species when removing the solvent to obtain the solid form. In this way, the imaged nanoparticles (TEM/AFM) are not covalently bound entities formed during the synthetic process, but instead supramolecular entities formed by noncovalent interactions. These particles, if at all present in solution, have the form of loose associations of relatively small molecules. The present study was conducted on CDs obtained from the hydrothermal carbonization (HTC) of a biomass waste (olive wet pomace).&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Synthesis of Waixenicin A: Exploring Strategies for Nine&#8208;Membered Ring Formation&#8203;</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We present a comprehensive account on our efforts behind the recently published synthesis of waixenicin A. Our approach for constructing the dihydropyran ring relied on an Achmatowicz rearrangement. For the assembly of the nine&#8208;membered ring four distinct strategies were investigated. Our initial attempts using radical&#8208;based addition/fragmentation reactions targeting the C7&#8208;C11 bond proved unsuitable for accessing the 6/9&#8208;bicycle. By employing anionic fragmentation conditions at the furfuryl alcohol stage, we successfully reached a 5/9&#8208;bicycle. However, subsequent ring&#8208;expansion was unsuccessful. Alternative approaches, such as Nozaki&#8211;Hiyama&#8211;Kishi or Heck reactions to connect the C6&#8208;C7 bond, also encountered difficulties, with no nine&#8208;membered ring formation observed. Our first breakthrough came from our attempts to install the C5&#8208;C6 bond via an intramolecular alkylation. Surprisingly, subsequent functional group modifications proved unexpectedly challenging, necessitating a redesign of our synthetic route. Drawing from all our investigations, we concluded that construction of the C9&#8208;C10 bond would enable efficient nine&#8208;membered ring alkylation and would facilitate the installation of the desired substitution pattern along the southern periphery. Exploration of this strategy yielded further surprises but ultimately led to the successful synthesis of waixenicin A and 9&#8208;deacetoxy&#8208;14,15&#8208;deepoxyxeniculin. For the latter compound, a bioinspired one&#8208;step rearrangement to xeniafauranol A was achieved.</dc:description>

         <title>Mechanistic insights into amphoteric reactivity of an iron&#8208;bispidine complex</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The reactivity of FeIII&#8208;alkylperoxido complexes has remained a riddle to inorganic chemists owing to their thermal instability and impotency towards organic substrates. These iron&#8208;oxygen adducts have been known as sluggish oxidants towards oxidative electrophilic and nucleophilic reactions. Herein, we report the synthesis and spectroscopic characterization of a relatively stable mononuclear high&#8208;spin FeIII&#8208;alkylperoxido complex supported by an engineered bispidine framework. Against the notion, this FeIII&#8208;alkylperoxido complex serves as a rare example of versatile reactivity in both electrophilic and nucleophilic reactions. Detailed mechanistic studies and computational calculations reveal a novel reaction mechanism, where a putative superoxido intermediate orchestrates the amphoteric property of the oxidant. The design of the backbone is pivotal to convey stability and reactivity to alkylperoxido and superoxido intermediates. Contrary to the well&#8208;known O&#8208;O bond cleavage that generates an iron(IV)&#8208;oxido species, the iron(III)&#8208;alkylperoxido complex reported here undergoes O&#8208;C bond scission to generate a superoxido moiety that is responsible for the amphiphilic reactivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Calamitic Liquid Crystals for Reversible Light&#8208;modulated Phase Regulation based on Arylazopyrazole Photoswitches</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The design of responsive liquid crystals enables a diversity of technological applications. Especially photochromic liquid crystals gained a lot of interest in recent years due to the excellent spatiotemporal control of their phase transitions. In this work we present calamitic light responsive mesogens based on a library of arylazopyrazole photoswitches. These compounds show liquid&#8208;crystalline behavior as shown by differential scanning calorimetry, grazing incidence X&#8208;ray diffraction and polarized optical microscopy. UV&#8208;vis spectroscopy and NMR analysis confirmed the excellent photophysical properties in solution and thin film. Additionally, polarized optical microscopy studies of the pristine compounds show reversible phase transition upon irradiation with light. Moreover, as a dopant in the commercially available liquid crystal 4&#8208;cyano&#8208;4'&#8208;pentylbiphenyl (5CB), the temperature range was reduced to ambient temperatures while preserving the excellent photophysical properties. Remarkably this co&#8208;assembled system shows reversible liquid&#8208;crystalline to isotropic phase transition upon irradiation with light of different wavelengths. The spatiotemporal control of the phase transition of the liquid crystals offers opportunities in the development of optical devices.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This report describes a one&#8208;pot multi&#8208;step procedure to obtain double azahelicenes via nucleophilic fluorine substitution of 2,2&#8208;di(2&#8208;bromophenyl)&#8208;1,1&#8208;difluoroalkenes and palladium&#8208;catalysed ring closing reaction. The developed synthesis approach allows easy diversification of substituents at all four fragments of the obtained X&#8208;shaped aza[4,6]helicene entity. Optical (UV/Vis, PL) and electrochemical (CV) properties of selected products were studied and experimental results are supported by (TD) DFT, NICS and NICS2BC calculations.</dc:description>

         <title>Supramolecular Organic Ferroelectric Materials from Donor&#8208;Acceptor Systems</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Amongst different class of organic systems, donor(D)&#8208;acceptor(A) charge&#8208;transfer (CT)&#8208; complexes were recognized promising for ferroelectricity owing to their neutral&#8208;to&#8208;ionic phase transition at low temperature. This review presents an overview of different supramolecular D&#8208;A systems, explored for ferroelectric (FE) phase transitions. Discussion begins with a general introduction of ferroelectricity and different associated parameters. Then it moves on to show early examples of CT&#8208;cocrystals that showed FE properties in sub&#8208;ambient temperature. Subsequently, recent development in the field on room temperature (rt) ferroelectricity, exhibited by H&#8208;bond stabilized lock&#8208;arm supramolecular&#8208;ordering (LASO) in D&#8208;A co&#8208;crystals or other FE CT&#8208;crystals devoid of neutral&#8208;ionic phase transition are discussed. Then the discussion moves on to emerging reports on other D&#8208;A soft&#8208;materials such as gel and foldable polymers and finally it shows very recent development on ferroelectricity in supramolecular assemblies of single&#8208;component dipolar or ambipolar &#960;&#8208;systems, exhibiting intra&#8208;molecular charge transfer. Effect of structural nuances such as H&#8208;bonding, balanced charge&#8208;transfer and chirality on the observed ferroelectricity is described with available examples. Finally, piezoelectricity in recently reported ambipolar ADA&#8208; type systems are discussed to highlight the future potential of these soft materials in micropower energy harvesting.</dc:description>

         <title>Optical Cavity Design and Functionality for Molecular Strong Coupling</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Optical cavity/molecule strong coupling offers attractive opportunities to modulate photochemical or photophysical processes. When atoms or molecules are placed in an optical cavity, they can coherently exchange photonic energy with optical cavity vacuum fields, entering the strong coupling interaction regime. Recent work suggests that the thermodynamic and kinetic properties of molecules can be significantly changed by strong coupling, resulting in the emergence of intriguing photochemical and photophysical phenomena. As more and more physico&#8208;chemical systems are studied under strong coupling conditions, optical cavities have also advanced in their sophistication, responsiveness, and (multi)functionality. In this review, we highlight some of these recent developments, particularly focusing on Fabry&#8208;Perot microcavities.</dc:description>

         <title>The Origin of Delayed Polymorphism in Molecular Crystals Under Mechanochemical Conditions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The extended induction period associated with mechanochemical polymorphism arises from the phenomenon of mechanical activation, which preceeds the transformation.







Abstract
We show that mechanochemically driven polymorphic transformations can require extremely long induction periods, which can be tuned from hours to days by changing ball milling energy. The robust design and interpretation of ball milling experiments must account for this unexpected kinetics that arises from energetic phenomena unique to the solid state. Detailed thermal analysis, combined with DFT simulations, indicates that these marked induction periods are associated with processes of mechanical activation. Correspondingly, we show that the pre&#8208;activation of reagents can also lead to marked changes in the length of induction periods. Our findings demonstrate a new dimension for exerting control over polymorphic transformations in organic crystals. We expect mechanical activation to have a much broader implication across organic solid&#8208;state mechanochemistry.

         <title>Initial Quenching Efficiency Determines Light&#8208;Driven H2 Evolution of [Mo3S13]2&#8722; in Lipid Bilayers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Light&#8208;driven H2 evolution at water&#8208;liposomes interfaces with molecular catalyst and photosensitizer is determined by the properties of the lipid bilayer. Initial light&#8208;driven charge transfer at room temperature depends upon the local lipid environment, with the highest efficiency at the transition temperature of the lipid bilayer.







Abstract
Nature uses reactive components embedded in biological membranes to perform light&#8208;driven photosynthesis. Here, a model artificial photosynthetic system for light&#8208;driven hydrogen (H2) evolution is reported. The system is based on liposomes where amphiphilic ruthenium trisbipyridine based photosensitizer (RuC9) and the H2 evolution reaction (HER) catalyst [Mo3S13]2&#8722; are embedded in biomimetic phospholipid membranes. When DMPC was used as the main lipid of these light&#8208;active liposomes, increased catalytic activity (TONCAT ~200) was observed compared to purely aqueous conditions. Although all tested lipid matrixes, including DMPC, DOPG, DPPC and DOPG liposomes provided similar liposomal structures according to TEM analysis, only DMPC yielded high H2 amounts. In situ scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM) measurements using Pd microsensors revealed an induction period of around 26 minutes prior to H2 evolution, indicating an activation mechanism which might be induced by the fluid&#8208;gel phase transition of DMPC at room temperature. Stern&#8208;Volmer&#8208;type quenching studies revealed that electron transfer dynamics from the excited state photosensitizer are most efficient in the DMPC lipid environment giving insight for design of artificial photosynthetic systems using lipid bilayer membranes.

         <title>Mechanistic Avenues in the Chan&#8208;Lam&#8208;Based Etherification Reaction: A Computational Exploration</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have carried out extensive computational investigations to explore the mechanistic avenues in CuII(OAC)2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;H2O&#8208;catalyzed Chan&#8208;Lam&#8208;based etherification reaction. Transmetalation from the methoxide&#8208;bridged CuII intermediate is rate determining. Hammett studies indicate higher catalytic turnovers for electron&#8208;rich boronic ester substituents.







Abstract
Ongoing advances in CuII&#8208;catalyzed aerobic oxidative coupling reactions between arylboronic esters and diverse heteroatom nucleophiles have strengthened the development of the general Chan&#8208;Lam (CL)&#8208;based reaction protocol, including C&#8722;O bond formation methodologies. In&#8208;depth mechanistic understanding of CL etherification with specific emphasis on different reaction routes and their energetics are still lacking, even though the reaction has been experimentally explored. Here, we present a DFT&#8208;guided computational study to unravel the mechanistic pathways of CL&#8208;based etherification. The computational findings provide some interesting insights into the fundamental steps of the catalytic cycle, particularly the rate&#8208;determining transmetalation event. An aryl boronic ester&#8208;coordinated, methoxide&#8208;bridged CuII intermediate that acts as resting state undergoes transmetalation with an activation barrier of 20.4&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1. The energy spans of the remaining fundamental steps leading to the methoxylated product are relatively low. The minor p&#8208;cresol product requires an additional 14.2&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1 energy span to surmount in comparison to the favored route. Hammett studies for the substituted aryl boronic esters reveal higher reaction turnovers for electron&#8208;rich aryl systems. The results agree with previously reported spectroscopic and kinetic observations. For a series of alcohol substrates, it was observed that, except for cyclohexanol, moderate to high etherification turnovers are predicted.

         <title>Exceptionally Stable And Super&#8208;Efficient Electrocatalysts Derived From Semiconducting Metal Phosphonate Frameworks</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two isostructural semiconducting metal phosphonate frameworks, Co2[1,4&#8208;NDPA] and Zn2[1,4&#8208;NDPA] (1,4&#8208;NDPA4&#8722; is 1,4&#8208;naphthalenediphosphonate), are reported which have optical bandgaps within the semiconducting regime (1.7&#8197;eV and 2.5&#8197;eV, respectively),. The electrocatalyst derived from Co2[1,4&#8208;NPDA] as a precatalyst holds potential in the oxygen evolution reaction (OER).







Abstract
Two new isostructural semiconducting metal&#8208;phosphonate frameworks are reported. Co2[1,4&#8208;NDPA] and Zn2[1,4&#8208;NDPA] (1,4&#8208;NDPA4&#8722; is 1,4&#8208;naphthalenediphosphonate) have optical bandgaps of 1.7&#8197;eV and 2.5&#8197;eV, respectively. The electrocatalyst derived from Co2[1,4&#8208;NPDA] as a precatalyst generated a low overpotential of 374&#8197;mV in the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) with a Tafel slope of 43&#8197;mV&#8201;dec&#8722;1 at a current density of 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in alkaline electrolyte (1&#8197;mol&#8201;L&#8722;1 KOH), which is indicative of remarkably superior reaction kinetics. Benchmarking of the OER of Co2[1,4&#8208;NPDA] material as a precatalyst coupled with nickel foam (NF) showed exceptional long&#8208;term stability at a current density of 50&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 for water splitting compared to the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art Pt/C/RuO2@NF after 30&#8197;h in 1&#8197;mol&#8201;L&#8722;1 KOH. In order to further understand the OER mechanism, the transformation of Co2[1,4&#8208;NPDA] into its electrocatalytically active species was investigated.

Dimer contest: A combined matrix&#8208;isolation spectroscopic and theoretical study provides unprecedented insight into isolated dimers of two constitutional benzoacridine isomers and the differences to dimeric structures in the crystalline solid state.







Abstract
In this work, matrix&#8208;isolation spectroscopy and quantum&#8208;chemical calculations are used together to analyse the structure and properties of weakly bound dimers of the two isomers benzo[a]acridine and benzo[c]acridine. Our measured experimental electronic absorbance spectra agree with simulated spectra calculated for the equilibrium structures of the dimers in gas&#8208;phase, but in contrast, disagree with the simulated spectra calculated for the structures obtained by optimising the experimental solid&#8208;state structures. This highlights the sensitivity of the electronic excitations with respect to the dimer structures. The comparison between the solid&#8208;state and gas&#8208;phase dimers shows how far the intermolecular interactions could change the geometric and electronic structure in a disordered bulk material or at device interfaces, imposing consequences for exciton and charge mobility and other material properties.

&lt;p&gt;In this work, matrix-isolation spectroscopy and quantum-chemical calculations are used together to analyse the structure and properties of weakly bound dimers of the two isomers benzo[&lt;i&gt;a&lt;/i&gt;]acridine and benzo[&lt;i&gt;c&lt;/i&gt;]acridine. Our measured experimental electronic absorbance spectra agree with simulated spectra calculated for the equilibrium structures of the dimers in gas-phase, but in contrast, disagree with the simulated spectra calculated for the structures obtained by optimising the experimental solid-state structures. This highlights the sensitivity of the electronic excitations with respect to the dimer structures. The comparison between the solid-state and gas-phase dimers shows how far the intermolecular interactions could change the geometric and electronic structure in a disordered bulk material or at device interfaces, imposing consequences for exciton and charge mobility and other material properties.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Heteroditopic NHC Ligand Supported Manganese(I) Complexes: Synthesis, Characterization, and Activity as Non&#8208;bifunctional Phosphine&#8208;Free Catalyst for the &#945;&#8208;Alkylation of Nitriles</title>

Borrowing hydrogen: The catalytic efficiency of phosphine&#8208;free non&#8208;bifunctional MnI&#8722;NHC complexes of chelating heteroditopic ligands featuring ImNHC connected to a 1,2,3&#8208;triazole&#8208;N or tzNHC donors through a methylene spacer have been explored for coupling of diverse nitriles with alcohols by borrowing hydrogen protocol. The catalyst Mn1 containing ImNHC connected to triazole&#8208;N donor displayed higher activity than Mn2/Mn3 containing an unsymmetrical bis&#8208;carbene donors (ImNHC and tzNHC).







Abstract
In the present work, several manganese(I) complexes of chelating heteroditopic ligands Mn1&#8211;3, featuring ImNHC (imidazol&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene) connected to a 1,2,3&#8208;triazole&#8208;N or tzNHC (1,2,3&#8208;triazol&#8208;5&#8208;ylidene) donors via a methylene spacer, with possible modifications at the triazole backbone have been synthesized and completely characterized. Notably, the CO stretching frequencies, electrochemical analysis, and frontier orbital analysis certainly suggest that the chelating ImNHC&#8208;tzNHC ligands have stronger donation capabilities than the related ImNHC&#8208;Ntz ligand in the synthesized complexes. Moreover, these well&#8208;defined phosphine&#8208;free Mn(I)&#8722;NHC complexes have been found to be effective non&#8208;bifunctional catalysts for the &#945;&#8208;alkylation of nitriles using alcohols and importantly, the catalyst Mn1 containing ImNHC connected to a weaker triazole&#8208;N donor displayed higher activity compared to Mn2/Mn3 containing an unsymmetrical bis&#8208;carbene donors (ImNHC and tzNHC). A wide range of aryl nitriles were coupled with diverse (hetero)aromatic as well as aliphatic alcohols to get the corresponding products in good to excellent yields (32 examples, up to 95&#8201;% yield). The detailed mechanistic studies including deuterium labelling experiments reveal that the reaction follows a Borrowing Hydrogen pathway.

         <title>Chasing Turns and Twists: Unraveling the One&#8208;Step Synthesis, Intricate Pathways, and Structural Revelations of N&#8208;Aryl Aza&#8208;quasi[8]circulenes</title>

COT is caught! This report presents an efficient one&#8208;step, metal&#8208;free synthesis of aza&#8208;quasi[8]circulenes from bis(biaryl)carbazoles. The regioselective &#8242;fold&#8208;in&#8242; synthesis unravels the intricate pathways involved and overcomes the helical strain in the intermediate aza[7]helicene formed. The resulting aza&#8208;quasi[8]circulenes feature a non&#8208;planar central cyclooctatetraene (COT) and exhibit intriguing optical, chiroptical, and redox properties, making them promising candidates for future applications in organic electronics.







Abstract
An efficient one&#8208;step synthesis of N&#8208;Aryl aza&#8208;quasi[8]circulenes is reported starting from bis(biaryl)carbazoles. The intermediacy of N&#8208;aryl aza[7]helicene is investigated, and the Scholl oxidative cyclization route is invoked here to overcome the large strain during the formation of N&#8208;aryl aza&#8208;quasi[8]circulenes from N&#8208;aryl aza[7]helicene. Notably, this transformation occurs without the need for directing groups and proceeds from a more helical to a less helical pathway. Both the N&#8208;aryl aza[7]helicene and N&#8208;aryl aza&#8208;quasi[8]circulene are confirmed by single crystal X&#8208;ray structural analysis. The enantiomers of N&#8208;aryl aza[7]helicene are separated by chiral HPLC and analyzed by circular dichroism spectroscopy to investigate their chiroptical properties. However, N&#8208;aryl aza&#8208;quasi[8]circulene racemizes rapidly. The radical cations generated from aza&#8208;quasi[8]circulene through chemical oxidation exhibit broad absorption in the near&#8208;IR region and air stability up to 24&#8197;h. Optical and electrochemical studies with aza[7]helicene and aza&#8208;quasi[8]circulene derivatives highlight their potential in organic electronic devices.

         <title>Pinacol Cross&#8208;Coupling Promoted by an Aluminyl Anion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The potassium aluminyl K[Al(NON)] (NON=[O(SiMe2NDipp)2]2&#8722;) is a suitable platform for the pinacol coupling of aldehydes and ketones. Isolating an intermediate allows unsymmetrical examples to be accessed via a sequential addition strategy. A rare example of a p&#8208;block ketyl complex was isolated, and DFT was used to confirm a carbon&#8208;based radical. Product release was achieved using an iodosilane, demonstrating the steps required to generate a closed synthetic cycle.







Abstract
A simple sequential addition protocol for the reductive coupling of ketones and aldehydes by a potassium aluminyl grants access to unsymmetrical pinacolate derivatives. Isolation of an aluminium ketyl complex presents evidence for the accessibility of radical species. Product release from the aluminium centre was achieved using an iodosilane, forming the disilylated 1,2&#8208;diol and a neutral aluminium iodide, thereby demonstrating the steps required to generate a closed synthetic cycle for pinacol (cross) coupling at an aluminyl anion.

         <title>Acceptorless or Transfer Dehydrogenation of Glycerol Catalyzed by Base Metal Salt Cobaltous Chloride &#8211; Facile Access to Lactic Acid and Hydrogen or Isopropanol</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Readily available, inexpensive, environmentally benign and earth&#8208;abundant base metal salt cobaltous chloride has been employed to catalyze the reforming of glycerol to lactic acid in high yield and excellent selectivity either in an acceptorless fashion or under transfer dehydrogenation conditions at 160&#8201;&#176;C.







Abstract
The dehydrogenation of glycerol to lactic acid (LA) under both acceptorless and transfer dehydrogenation conditions using readily available, inexpensive, environmentally benign and earth&#8208;abundant base metal salt CoCl2 is reported here. The CoCl2 (0.5&#8197;mol&#8201;%) catalyzed acceptorless dehydrogenation of glycerol at 160&#8201;&#176;C in the presence of 0.75&#8197;equiv. of KOH, gave up to 33&#8201;% yield of LA in 44&#8201;% selectivity apart from hydrogen. Alternatively, with acetone as a sacrificial hydrogen acceptor, the CoCl2 (0.5&#8197;mol&#8201;%) catalyzed dehydrogenation of glycerol at 160&#8201;&#176;C in the presence of 1.1&#8197;equiv. of NaOtBu resulted in up to 93&#8201;% LA with 96&#8201;% selectivity along with another value&#8208;added product isopropanol. Labelling studies revealed a modest secondary KIE of 1.68 which points to the involvement of C&#8722;H bond activation as a part of the catalytic cycle but not as a part of the rate&#8208;determining step. Catalyst poisoning experiments with PPh3 and CS2 are indicative of the homogeneous nature of the reaction mixture involving molecular species that are likely to be in&#8208;situ formed octahedral Co(II) as inferred from EPR, HRMS and Evans magnetic moment studies. The net transfer dehydrogenation activity is attributed to exclusive contribution from the alcoholysis step.

         <title>Support Engineering for the Stabilisation of Heterogeneous Pd3P&#8208;Based Catalysts for Heck Coupling Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The concept of support engineering using phosphorus&#8208;modified silica is used to modulate catalyst&#8208;support interactions and to stabilize catalytically active species on the support. Following this approach, an enhanced catalytic performance and catalyst stability as well as a reduction of metal leaching can be achieved for Pd3P.







Abstract
Herein we report the use of a supported Pd3P catalyst for Heck coupling reactions. For the stabilisation of Pd3P and Pd, as reference system, the silica support material was modified via phosphorus doping (0.5 and 1&#8197;wt&#8201;% P). Through this so&#8208;called support engineering approach, the catalytic activity of Pd3P was clearly enhanced. Whereas an iodobenzene conversion of 79&#8201;% was witnessed for Pd3P@SiO2 in the coupling of styrene and iodobenzene in 1&#8197;h, 90&#8201;% conversion could be achieved using Pd3P@1P&#8208;SiO2. This improved catalytic activity probably stems from an electronic modulation of the support surface via the introduction of phosphorus. Simultaneously, the recyclability was boosted and the Pd3P@1P&#8208;SiO2 catalyst has shown to maintain its catalytic activity over several recovery tests. Hereby, metal leaching could almost be suppressed completely to 3&#8201;% by the use of a P&#8208;modified silica support.

         <title>Zeolite/Polymer Composites Prepared by Photopolymerization: Effect of Compensation Cations on Opacity and Gas Adsorption Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The fabrication of structured zeolite adsorbents through photopolymerization&#8208;based 3D printing which offers a solution to the limitations of conventional shaping techniques has been demonstrated but many parameters still need to be optimized. In this study, we studied the influence of zeolite compensation cations on the photopolymerization and the composite&#8217;s properties. Modified zeolites (LTA 4A and FAU 13X exchanged with K+, Li+, Sr2+, Ca2+ or Mg2+) were incorporated in PEGDA with BDMK as photoinitiator, and the formulation was cured under mild conditions (LED@405 nm, room temperature, under air). Our results indicate that the nature of zeolite compensation cations affects the colorimetric properties of polymer/zeolite composites: a better translucency parameter results in higher depth of cure. After calcination at 650 &#176;C and complete removal of PEGDA, pure zeolitic monoliths were tested for adsorption of gas molecules of interest (carbon dioxide, dichlorobenzene and water). Structured 4A and 13X monoliths obtained by 3D printing exhibit comparable adsorption capacity to commercial beads prepared from the same zeolites. This study enhances our understanding of the photopolymerization process involved in the production of polymer/zeolite composites. These composites are used in the fabrication of zeolitic objects through 3D printing, offering potential solutions to various environmental and dental challenges.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Shapeable and flexible pressure sensors with superior mechanical and electrical properties are of major interest as they can be employed in a wide range of applications. In this regard, elastomer&#8208;based composites incorporating carbon nanomaterials in the insulating matrix embody an appealing solution for designing flexible pressure sensors with specific properties. In this study, PDMS chains of different molecular weight were successfully functionalized with benzoxazine moieties in order to thermally cure them without adding a second component, nor a catalyst or an initiator. These precursors were then blended with 1 weight percent of multi&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes (CNTs) using an ultrasound probe, which induced a transition from a liquid&#8208;like to a gel&#8208;like behavior as CNTs generate an interconnected network within the matrix. After curing, the resulting nanocomposites exhibit mechanical and electrical properties making them highly promising materials for pressure&#8208;sensing applications.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>A highly enantioselective Mannich reaction of biphenyl&#8208;bridged seven&#8208;membered cyclic N&#8208;sulfonylimines with methyl alkyl ketones is disclosed in this study. The reaction was performed under organocatalysis, using a quinine&#8208;derived primary amine as the catalyst in combination with a Br&#248;nsted acid as the co&#8208;catalyst. High yields (up to 89%) and excellent enantioselectivities (up to 97% ee) were observed. For methyl alkyl ketones containing a larger alkyl substituent, specific regioselective addition to the C=N bond is favoured at the methyl group. On the contrary, ketones containing a smaller alkyl substituent or hydroxyacetone substrates gave major syn selective Mannich products at the methylene group.</dc:description>

         <title>Supporting Electrolyte&#8208;Free Electrochemical Oxidative C&#8210;H Sulfonylation and Thiocyanation of Fused Pyrimidin&#8208;4&#8208;ones in an All&#8208;Green Electrolytic System</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An electrooxidative C&#8210;H functionalization is a widely accepted route to obtain sulfur&#8208;containing arenes and heteroarenes. However, this process often involves using non&#8208;recyclable supporting electrolytes, (co)solvents like hexafluoroisopropanol, additives like acid, or catalysts. The use of additional reagents can increase costs and waste, reducing atom efficiency. Moreover, unlike other nitrogen&#8208;containing heterocycles, there have only been sporadic reports of electrochemical C&#8210;H functionalization in fused pyrimidin&#8208;4&#8208;ones, and an electrolyte&#8208;free process has yet to be developed. We demonstrate that such anodic coupling reactions can be performed in an all&#8208;green electrolytic system without using such additional electrolytes or HFIP, maintaining a high atom economy. This C&#8210;H functionalization strategy utilizes inexpensive sodium sulfinates and ammonium thiocyanate as sulfonylating and thiocyanating agents in an undivided cell at a constant current, using a mixture of CH3CN/H2O as solvent at room temperature. Thus, fused pyrimidin&#8208;4&#8208;ones can be selectively converted into C3&#8208;sulfonylated and &#8208;thiocyanated derivatives in moderate to good yields.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;An electrooxidative C&#8210;H functionalization is a widely accepted route to obtain sulfur-containing arenes and heteroarenes. However, this process often involves using non-recyclable supporting electrolytes, (co)solvents like hexafluoroisopropanol, additives like acid, or catalysts. The use of additional reagents can increase costs and waste, reducing atom efficiency. Moreover, unlike other nitrogen-containing heterocycles, there have only been sporadic reports of electrochemical C&#8210;H functionalization in fused pyrimidin-4-ones, and an electrolyte-free process has yet to be developed. We demonstrate that such anodic coupling reactions can be performed in an all-green electrolytic system without using such additional electrolytes or HFIP, maintaining a high atom economy. This C&#8210;H functionalization strategy utilizes inexpensive sodium sulfinates and ammonium thiocyanate as sulfonylating and thiocyanating agents in an undivided cell at a constant current, using a mixture of CH3CN/H2O as solvent at room temperature. Thus, fused pyrimidin-4-ones can be selectively converted into C3-sulfonylated and -thiocyanated derivatives in moderate to good yields.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Well&#8208;defined Mn(II)&#8208;complex Catalyzed Switchable De(hydrogenative) Csp3&#8208;H Functionalization of Methyl Heteroarenes: A Sustainable Approach for Diversification of Heterocyclic Motifs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Catalytic activities of Mn(I) complexes derived from expensive MnBr(CO)5 salt have been explored in various dehydrogenative transformations. However, the reactivity and selectivity of inexpensive high spin Mn(II) complexes are uncommon. Herein, we have synthesized four new Mn(II) complexes and explored switchable alkenylation and alkylation of methyl heteroarenes employing a single Mn(II)catalyst. The developed protocol selectively furnishes a series of functionalized E&#8208;heteroarenes and C&#8208;alkylated heteroarenes with good to excellent yields. Various medicinally and synthetically useful compounds are successfully synthesized using our developed protocol. Various controls and kinetics experiments were executed to shed light on the mechaism,which reveals that &#945;&#8208;C&#8208;H bond breaking of alcohol is the slowest step.</dc:description>

         <title>Ultrathin Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Nanosheets for Selective Photocatalytic C2H2 Semihydrogenation in Aqueous Solution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The selective semihydrogenation of C2H2 to C2H4 in crude C2H4 (with ~1 vol% C2H2 contamination) is a crucial process in the manufacture of polyethylene. Comparing to conventional thermalcatalytic route with Pd as catalytic under high temperature with H2 as hydrogen source, photocatalytic C2H2 reduction reaction with H2O as hydrogen source can achieve high selectivity under milder conditions, but has rarely been reported. Here, we present a kind of ultrathin metal&#8208;organic framework nanosheets (Cu&#8208;Co&#8208;MNSs) that demonstrate excellent catalytic activities in the semihydrogenation of C2H2. Employing Ru(bpy)32+ as the photosensitizer, this catalyst attains a noteworthy turnover number (TON) of 2124 for C2H4, coupled with an impressive selectivity of 99.5% after a 12 h visible light irradiation. This performance is comparable to molecular catalysts and notably surpasses the efficiency of bulk metal&#8208;organic framework materials. Furthermore, Cu&#8208;Co&#8208;MNSs achieve a 99.95% conversion of C2H2 under industrial relevant conditions (1.10% C2H2 in C2H4) with 90.3% selectivity for C2H4 over C2H6, demonstrating a great potential for polymer&#8208;grade C2H4 production.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we report the synthesis of a rare bis&#8208;silylene 1 in which two silylene atoms are bridged by a Si(IV) atom.&#160; Compound 1 contains an unusual Si(II)&#8208;Si(IV)&#8208;Si(II) bonding arrangement with the Si(II)&#8208;Si(IV) bond distances of 2.4212(8) and 2.4157(7) &#197;. Treatment of 1 with Fe(CO)5 afforded a dinuclear Fe(0) complex 2 with two unusually long Si&#8211;Si bonds (2.4515(8) and 2.4488(10) &#197;). We have also carried out a detailed computational study to understand the nature of the Si&#8211;Si bonds in these compounds. The NBO (Natural bond orbital) and EDA&#8208;NOCV (energy decomposition analysis&#8208;Natural orbital for chemical valence) analyses reveal that the Si&#8208;Si bonds in 1&#8208;2 are of electron&#8208;sharing nature.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Magnetic refrigeration technology based on Gd&#8208;based paramagnets is expected to be applied to refrigeration in extremely low temperatures, thereby reducing the consumption of liquid helium. Here, we obtained a compound, Gd3TeBO9 with high Gd3+ concentration through element substitution. The Gd3+ concentration in this compound is as high as 2.4&#215;1024 ions/kg, which is 33% higher than the commercial Gd3Ga5O12 (GGG), and further magnetic tests show that Gd3TeBO9 has a large magnetic entropy change (57.44 J/(kg K) and 408 mJ/(cm3 K) at 2.6 K and 7 T), which is 1.5 times that of GGG, implying the possibility of its further development as an potential magnetocaloric material.</dc:description>

         <title>Classical gold carbonyl complexes in tetrahedral and trigonal&#8208;planar settings</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A unique four&#8208;coordinate, classical gold(I)&#8208;carbonyl complex with substantial backdonation from gold has been isolated using a B&#8208;methylated and fluorinated tris(pyridyl)borate chelator. Its lighter silver(I) and copper(I) analogs enabled a study of coinage metal family group trends. The B&#8208;arylated ligand version also afforded a gold carbon monoxide complex that displays a notably low C&#8208;O stretch value, but with a trigonal planar geometry at gold. A computational analysis shows that the Au(I)&#8208;CO bonds of these tris(pyridyl)borate ligand supported molecules consist of electrostatic attraction, OC&#8594;Au donation, and very significant Au&#8594;CO &#960;&#8208;back&#8208;bonding components. The latter is responsible for the observed C&#8208;O stretching frequencies that are lower than in free CO.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Reaching the formidable C&#8208;H corners has been one of the top priorities of organic chemists in the recent past. This prompted us to disclose herein a vicinal annulation of 2&#8208;iodo benzoates, indoles and carbazoles with N&#8208;embedded 1,6&#8208;enynes through 7&#8208;/8&#8208;membered palladacycles. The relay does not require the assistance of any directing group, leading to multi&#8208;cyclic scaffolds which are readily diversified to an array of adducts (with new functional tethers and/or 3 contiguous stereocenters) where we showcase a rare benzylic mono&#8208;oxygenation.</dc:description>

         <title>Amido Silicon Chalcogenides: New Cage Compounds Derived From The Bicyclic Silicon(I) Ring Compound Si4{N(SiMe3)Mes}4</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The bicyclic silicon(I) ring compound Si4{N(SiMe3)Mes}42 was used as starting material in reactions with chalcogens and chalcogen transfer agents at low temperatures. This results in the selective formation of new cage compounds. With Me3NO a silicon oxide with adamantane&#8208;type cage 3 was isolated that represents the first isolated T4 silsesquioxane. The reactions propylenesulfide and red selenium gave direct access to defect heterocubane&#8208;type cages 4 and 5 with three Si&#8211;Si bonds wherein the silicon atoms adopt different low oxidation states of +I and +III. A reaction with elemental tellurium even occurs below room temperature to provide a ditelluro&#8208;tetrasila&#8208;tricyclohexane 6.</dc:description>

         <title>Brook Rearrangement as Trigger for Dearomatization Reaction: Synthesis of Non&#8208;Aromatic N&#8208;Heterocycles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The [1,2]&#8208;Brook rearrangement stands as a potent technique for constructing complex molecules. In this study, we showcase its power in the dearomatization of aromatic N&#8208;heterocycles. Through a concise four&#8208;step process that integrates lithiation, nucleophilic addition, Brook rearrangement and dearomatization reaction, we demonstrate a versatile strategy for generating diverse non&#8208;aromatic N&#8208;heterocycles which exhibit ambident reactivities. Various acyl silanes, halo&#8208;pyridines, and quinolines have been explored within this context. The synthetic utility of this methodology is demonstrated through the construction of complex architectures.</dc:description>

         <title>Rhodium&#8208;mediated Dehydrogenation of Hydroboranes and Group 14 Compounds: Base&#8208;stabilized Silylene and Germylene Complexes vs. Transmetalation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Monocarbonyl rhodium complex LRh(CO), 1, which is stabilized by a pyrrole&#8208;based bis(phosphinimine) pincer ligand (L = &#8232;&#954;3&#8208;NNN&#8217; = 2,5&#8208;[iPr2P=N(4&#8208;iPrC6H4)]2&#8208;N&#8217;(C4H2)&#8208;), serves as a versatile platform for the dehydrogenation of Group 14 substrates. Reaction with primary and secondary silanes and germanes (MesSiH3, Et2SiH2, Ph2GeH2, tBuGeH3; Mes = mesityl) liberates H2 and yields base&#8208;stabilized tertylene compounds of the form &#954;2&#8208;L(CO)Rh(ER2) (E = Si: R = Mes, H, 2; R = Et, 5; E= Ge: R = Ph, 6; R = tBu, H, 8). The &#8220;:ER2&#8221; fragment in these species bridges between the rhodium center and a phosphinimine donor. Preliminary reactions between pinacol (Pin) and &#954;2&#8208;L(CO)Rh(ER2), E = Si, Ge, indicate that such complexes can serve as silylene and germylene synthons, releasing:ER2 and catalytically generating PinER2. In contrast, combination of complex 1 and MesGeH3 does not yield the anticipated dehydrogenation product, but rather, transmetalation similar to that observed upon reaction between 1 and 3,5&#8208;dimethylphenylborane prevails.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis and Properties of Fluorenone&#8208;containing Cyclo&#8208;paraphenylenes and their Late&#8208;Stage Transformation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cycloparaphenylenes (CPPs) are the smallest possible armchair carbon nanotubes, the properties of which strongly depend on their ring sizes. They can be further tuned by either peripheral functionalizations or by replacing phenylene rings for other aromatic units. Here we show how four novel donor&#8208;acceptor chromophores are obtained by incorporating fluorenone or 2&#8208;(9H&#8208;fluoren&#8208;9&#8208;ylidene)malononitrile into the loops of two differently sized CPPs. Synthetically, we managed to perform late&#8208;stage functionalization of the fluorenone&#8208;based rings by high&#8208;yielding Knoevenagel condensations. The structures were confirmed by X&#8208;ray crystallographic analyses, revealing that replacing a phenylene for a fused&#8208;ring&#8208;system acceptor introduces additional strain. The donor&#8208;acceptor characters of the CPPs were supported by absorption and fluorescence spectroscopic studies, electrochemical studies (displaying the CPPs as multi&#8208;redox systems undergoing reversible or quasi&#8208;reversible redox events), as well as by computations. The oligophenylene parts were found to comprise the electron donor units of the macrocycles and the fluorenone parts the acceptor units.</dc:description>

         <title>Extended Tetrathiafulvalenes with Fluoreno[3,2&#8208;b]fluorene and Diindeno[1,2&#8208;b:1',2'&#8208;i]anthracene Cores</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In one&#8208;dimensional polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) containing five&#8208; and six&#8208;membered rings fused together, one key question is whether the structures possess a quinoidal or aromatic diradical character. Here, we generate such PAHs by reversible oxidation of PAH&#8208;extended tetrathiafulvalenes (TTFs). Extended TTFs were thus prepared and studied for their geometrical properties (crystallography), redox properties, and UV/Vis/NIR/EPR characteristics as a function of charge state. The EPR measurements of radical cations showed unique features for each PAH&#8208;TTF. The dications, formally composed of fluoreno[3,2&#8208;b]fluorene and diindeno[1,2&#8208;b:1',2'&#8208;i]anthracene cores, were experimentally found to exhibit singlet ground states. For the latter, calculations reveal the closed shell, quinoid singlet state to be isoenergetic with the open shell singlet diradical. Each charge state exhibited unique optical properties with radical cations absorbing strongly in the NIR region with signatures from&#160;&#960;&#8208;dimers for the large core.&#160;The experimental results were paralleled and supported by detailed computations, including&#160;spin density distribution calculations, EPR simulations, and&#160;nucleus independent chemical shift (NICS)&#160;xy&#160;scans.</dc:description>

         <title>Rebound or Cage Escape? The Role of the Rebound Barrier for the Reactivity of Non&#8208;heme High&#8208;valent FeIV=O species</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Owing to their high reactivity and selectivity, variations in the spin ground state and a range of possible pathways, high&#8208;valent FeIV=O species are popular models with potential bioinspired applications. An interesting example of a structure&#8211;reactivity pattern is the detailed study with five nonheme amine&#8208;pyridine pentadentate ligand FeIV=O species, including N4py: [(L1)FeIV=O]2+ (1), bntpen: [(L2)FeIV=O]2+ (2), py2tacn: [(L3)FeIV=O]2+ (3), and two isomeric bispidine derivatives: [(L4)FeIV=O]2+ (4) and [(L5)FeIV=O]2+ (5). In this set, the order of increasing reactivity in the hydroxylation of cyclohexane differs from that with cyclohexadiene as substrate. A comprehensive DFT, ab initio CASSCF/NEVPT2 and DLPNO&#8208;CCSD(T) study is presented to untangle the observed patterns. These are well reproduced when both activation barriers for the C&#8208;H abstraction and the OH rebound are taken into account. An MO, NBO and deformation energy analysis reveals the importance of &#960;(pyr) &#224; &#960;*xz(FeIII&#8208;OH) electron donation for weakening the FeIII&#8208;OH bond and thus reducing the rebound barrier. This requires that pyridine rings are oriented perpendicularly to the FeIII&#8211;OH bond, i.e., this is a subtle but crucial point in ligand design for non&#8208;heme iron alkane hydroxylation.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Organophosphorus compounds (OPCs) are widely used in many fields. However, traditional synthetic routes in the industry usually involve multistep and hazardous procedures. Therefore, it&#8217;s of great significance to construct such compounds in an environmental&#8208;friendly and facile way. Herein, a photoredox catalytic method has been developed to construct novel phosphoryltriacetates. Using fac&#8208;Ir(ppy)3 (ppy = 2&#8208;phenylpyridine) as the photocatalyst and blue LEDs (456 nm) as the light source, white phosphorus can react with &#945;&#8208;bromo esters smoothly to generate phosphoryltriacetates in moderate to good yields. This one&#8208;step approach features mild reaction conditions and simple operational process without chlorination.</dc:description>

         <title>Total Synthesis of Cyanobactin Natural Product Balgacyclamide B</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Balgacyclamide A&#8208;C are a family of cyanobactin natural products isolated from freshwater cyanobacteria&#160;Microcystis aeruginosa. These macrocyclic peptides are characterized by their oxazoline&#8208;thiazole core, their 7 or 8 stereocenters, and their antiparasitic activities. Balgacyclamide B is known for its activity towards&#160;Plasmodium falciparum&#160;chloroquine&#8208;resistant strain K1,&#160;Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense,&#160;and&#160;Leishmania donovani. In this report, the first total synthesis of Balgacyclamide B is described in a 17&#8208;steps pathway and a 2% overall yield. The synthetic pathway toward balgacyclamide B can be adapted for the future syntheses of balgacyclamide A and C. In addition, a brief history background of oxazolines syntheses is shown to emphasize the importance of the cyclization conditions used to interconvert or retain configuration of&#160;b&#8208;hydroxy amides via dehydrative cyclization.</dc:description>

         <title>Organophotocatalyzed Alkyl/Arylsulfonylation of Vinylcyclopropanes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Allyl sulfones are an essential pharmacophore in many bioactive compounds. To combat their synthetic barrier, we report a practical, straightforward organophotocatalyzed&#160;methodology for accessing miscellaneously functionalized allyl sulfone derivatives using inexpensive and bench&#8208;stable sodium sulfinate salts under mild conditions. This photo&#8208;catalyzed radical sulfonylation provides access to a variety of allyl sulfones in good to excellent yields with high E:Z selectivity. A wide range of vinyl cyclopropanes, as well as aryl/hetero and alkyl sodium sulfinates, were tolerated and reliable in gram&#8208;scale synthesis. Later on, further functionalization of allyl sulfones was demonstrated. A plausible mechanism is proposed for radical sulfonylation with the control experiments.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>New synthesized bipyrimidine&#8208;based chromophores presenting alkoxystyryl donor groups carrying aliphatic achiral and chiral chains in the 4 position, connected to electron&#8208;accepting 2,2&#8208;bipyrimidine cores have been synthesized. Their linear and nonlinear optical properties were investigated as well as their mesomorphic properties by various techniques (light&#8208;transmission measurements, polarized&#8208;light optical microscopy, differential scanning calorimetry measurements and two&#8208;photon excited fluorescence). &#160;The derivatives with achiral linear carbon chains were found to exhibit liquid&#8208;crystal properties with the formation smectic phases over large temperature ranges which were confirmed by small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering analysis via stacking models. The nonlinear optical properties in the solid state for derivatives with C14 and the citronellol chains have been studied by wide&#8208;field second&#8208;harmonic generation and multi&#8208;photon fluorescence imaging, confirming centrosymmetry for these achiral mesogens and their excellent third&#8208;order nonlinearity whereas the chiral compound exhibits non&#8208;centrosymmetric organization resulting in a strong Second Harmonic Generation at the crystal state.</dc:description>

         <title>Reductive Release from a Hybrid PKS&#8208;NRPS during the Biosynthesis of Pyrichalasin H</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Three central steps during the biosynthesis of cytochalasan precursors, including reductive release, Knoevenagel cyclisation and Diels Alder cyclisation are not yet understood at a detailed molecular level. In this work we investigated the reductive release step catalysed by a hybrid polyketide synthase non&#8208;ribosomal peptide synthetase (PKS&#8208;NRPS) from the pyrichalasin H pathway. Synthetic thiolesters were used as substrate mimics for in vitro studies with the isolated reduction (R) and holo&#8208;thiolation (T) domains of the PKS&#8208;NRPS hybrid PyiS. These assays demonstrate that the PyiS R&#8208;domain mainly catalyses an NADPH&#8208;dependent reductive release of an aldehyde intermediate that quickly undergoes spontaneous Knoevenagel cyclisation. The R&#8208;domain can only process substrates that are covalently bound to the phosphopantetheine thiol of the upstream T&#8208;domain, but it shows little selectivity for the polyketide.</dc:description>

         <title>Colloidal and Thermal Stability of Three&#8208;Component Hybrid Materials containing Clay Mineral, Polysaccharide and Surfactant</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The paper presents the colloidal and thermal stability of the three&#8208;component hybrid materials containing halloysite, polysaccharides (alginic acid, cationic cellulose and hydroxyethyl cellulose) and Tritons. TX&#8208;100, TX&#8208;165 and TX&#8208;405 were used as non&#8208;ionic surfactants. Stability and other properties of the hybrid materials were tested by the following methods: UV&#8208;Vis, TGA (thermogravimetric analysis) and DSC (differential scanning calorimetry), CHN (elemental analysis), SEM&#8208;EDX (scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive X&#8208;Ray spectroscopy) and tensiometry. According to the results with the increasing polymer concentration the colloidal stability of the tested systems also increases. Moreover, the addition of the surfactants causes the increase of polysaccharide adsorption but the colloidal stability of the tested systems decreases due to large weights of formed aggregates. As follows from the thermal analysis, the comparison of the TG/DTG&#8208;DSC curves obtained for the investigated polymers confirms that their thermal decomposition courses have some common features. The obtained results have the application potential in the formation of the materials for the pollutants removal from water and sewages.</dc:description>

         <title>Tunable Metal&#8208;free Imidazole&#8208;Benzimidazole Electrocatalysts for Oxygen Reduction in Aqueous Solutions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A series of metal&#8208;free imidazole&#8208;benzimidazole catalysts (ImBenz&#8208;H, ImBenz&#8208;NO2, ImBenz&#8208;OCH3) for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) were prepared. We demonstrate that the electrocatalytic O2 reduction by ImBenz&#8208;NO2 with the electron&#8208;withdrawing group showed high selectivity toward H2O with the number of electrons transferred (n = 3.7) in a neutral aqueous solution. The highest ORR selectivity toward H2O2 was achieved using ImBenz&#8208;H (n = 2.4) in an alkaline solution. Electrochemical studies of reaction kinetics disclosed that the highest turnover frequencies were obtained from ImBenz&#8208;H in both neutral and alkaline aqueous solutions. The results prove that the ORR selectivity is tunable by modulating the substituent of the ImBenz catalysts. Furthermore, DFT calculations suggested that the ORR mechanism of ImBenz&#8208;H involves the electron transfer from imidazole&#8208;benzimidazole to O2 resulting in the formation of H2O2 which supports the redox active properties of the catalysts ImBenz.</dc:description>

         <title>A Metal&#8208;Free Molecular Ferroelectric [4&#8208;Me&#8208;cyclohexylamine]ClO4 Introduced by Boat and Chair Conformations of Cyclohexylamine</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic ferroelectrics have received a great deal of interest due to their exclusive&#160;properties. However, organic ferroelectrics have not been fully explored, which hinders their practical application. Here, we presented a novel metal&#8208;free organic molecular ferroelectric [4&#8208;MCHA][ClO4] (1) (4&#8208;MCHA = trans&#8208;4&#8208;methylcyclohexylamine), which exhibits an above&#8208;room&#8208;temperature of 328 K. Strikingly, the crystal structure analysis of 1 shows that the driving force of phase transition is related to the interesting chair&#8208;boat conformation change of 4&#8208;MCHA cation, in addition to&#160; the order&#8208;disorder transition. Using piezoelectric response force microscopy (PFM), the presence of domains and the implemented polarization switching was clearly observed, which explicitly determined the presence of room&#8208;temperature ferroelectricity of 1. As far as we know, the ferroelectric phase transition mechanism attributed to the conformational change in a trans isomeric cation is very rare. This research enriched the path of designing ferroelectric materials and smart materials.</dc:description>

Here, we presented a novel metal-free organic molecular ferroelectric [4-MCHA][ClO4] (1) (4-MCHA = trans-4-methylcyclohexylamine), which exhibits an above-room-temperature of 328 K.

         <title>Simulating non&#8208;adiabatic dynamics of photoexcited phenyl azide: Investigating electronic and structural relaxation en route to the formation of phenyl nitrene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Excited state molecular dynamics simulations of the photoexcited phenyl azide have been performed. The semi&#8208;classical surface hopping approximation has enabled an unconstrained analysis of the electronic and nuclear degrees of freedom which contribute to the molecular dissociation of phenyl azide into phenyl nitrene and molecular nitrogen. The significance of the second singlet excited state in leading the photodissociation has been established through electronic structure calculations, based on multiconfigurational schemes, and state population dynamics. The investigations on the structural dynamics have revealed the N &#8722; N bond separation to be accompanied by synchronous changes in the azide N &#8722; N &#8722; N bond angle. The 100 fs simulation results in a nitrene fragment that is electronically excited in the singlet manifold.</dc:description>

         <title>Understanding the Electronic Structure of Magnetic Trinuclear Complexes Based on the Tris&#8208;dioxolene Triphenylene Non&#8208;innocent Bridging Ligand, a Theoretical Study</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A complete theoretical analysis using first the simple H&#252;ckel model followed by more sophisticated multi&#8208;reference calculations on a trinuclear Ni(II) complex (Tp#Ni3HHTP), bearing the non&#8208;innocent bridging ligand HHTP3&#8208;, is carried out. The three semiquinone moieties of HHTP3&#8208;&#160;couple antiferromagnetically and lead to a single unpaired electron localized on one of the moieties. The calculated exchange coupling integrals together with the zero&#8208;field parameters allow, when varied within a certain range, reproducing the experimental data. These results are generalized for two similar other trinuclear complexes containing Ni(II) and Cu(II). The electronic structure of HHTP3&#8208;&#160;turns out to be independent of both the chemical nature and the geometry of the metal ions. We also establish a direct correlation between the geometrical and the electronic structures of the non&#8208;innocent ligand that is consistent with the results of calculations. It allows experimentalists to get insight into the magnetic behavior of this type of complexes by an analysis of their X&#8208;ray structure.</dc:description>
