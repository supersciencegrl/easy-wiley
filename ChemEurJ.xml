         <title>Origin of the Rate Acceleration in the C&#8722;C Reductive Elimination from Pt(IV)&#8208;complex in a [Ga4L6]12&#8722; Supramolecular Metallocage</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The influence of microsolvation and encapsulation on the acceleration of the C&#8722;C reductive elimination from a Pt(IV) complex inside the [Ga4L6]12&#8722; metallocage is evaluated. The comparison with a related encapsulated Au(III) reaction shows that whereas the Gibbs energy barrier reduction is similar their contribution it is not.







Abstract
The reductive elimination on [(Me3P)2Pt(MeOH)(CH3)3]+, 2P, complex performed in MeOH solution and inside a [Ga4L6]12&#8722; metallocage are computationally analysed by mean of QM and MD simulations and compared with the mechanism of gold parent systems previously reported [Et3PAu(MeOH)(CH3)2]+, 2Au. The comparative analysis between the encapsulated Au(III) and Pt(IV)&#8208;counterparts shows that there are no additional solvent MeOH molecules inside the cavity of the metallocage for both systems. The Gibbs energy barriers for the 2P reductive elimination calculated at DFT level are in good agreement with the experimental values for both environments. The effect of microsolvation and encapsulation on the rate acceleration are evaluated and shows that the latter is far more relevant, conversely to 2Au. Energy decomposition analysis indicates that the encapsulation is the main responsible for most of the energy barrier reduction. Microsolvation and encapsulation effects are not equally contributing for both metal systems and consequently, the reasons of the rate acceleration are not the same for both metallic systems despite the similarity between them.

         <title>Diphenylalanine Motif Drives Self&#8208;Assembling in Hybrid PNA&#8208;Peptide Conjugates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 57, Page 14307-14316, October 13, 2021. </description>

Forces triggering self&#8208;assembly. Conjugates of the PNA gc to the dipeptide FF assemble in water, producing fluorescent materials. Watson&#8208;Crick hydrogen bonds between complementary nucleobases and aromatic interactions between amino acids could stabilize the aggregate. The latter mainly drive the aggregation process.







Abstract
Peptides and nucleic acids can self&#8208;assemble to give supramolecular structures that find application in different fields, ranging from the delivery of drugs to the obtainment of materials endowed with optical properties. Forces that stabilize the &#8220;suprastructures&#8221; typically are hydrogen bonds or aromatic interactions; in case of nucleic acids, Watson&#8208;Crick pairing drives self&#8208;assembly while, in case of peptides, backbone hydrogen bonds and interactions between aromatic side chains trigger the formation of structures, such as nanotubes or ribbons. Molecules containing both aromatic peptides and nucleic acids could in principle exploit different forces to self&#8208;assemble. In this work we meant to investigate the self&#8208;assembly of mixed systems, with the aim to understand which forces play a major role and determine formation/structure of aggregates. We therefore synthesized conjugates of the peptide FF to the peptide nucleic acid dimer &#8220;gc&#8221; and characterized their aggregates by different spectroscopic techniques, including NMR, CD and fluorescence.

K(nockout) response: K12+6xFe6Te4&#8722;xO27 was synthesized under hydroflux conditions. The acentric cubic crystal structure comprises two non&#8208;interpenetrating chiral oxometalate networks formed by edge&#8208; or corner&#8208;sharing [TeVIO6] and [FeIIIO5] polyhedra. The potassium ions are mobile in the labyrinth between the networks. The magnetic moments of the iron cations are pairwise antiparallel, and the compound exhibits a strong piezoelectric response.







Abstract
Orange&#8208;colored crystals of the oxoferrate tellurate K12+6xFe6Te4&#8722;xO27 [x=0.222(4)] were synthesized in a potassium hydroxide hydroflux with a molar water&#8211;base ratio n(H2O)/n(KOH) of 1.5 starting from Fe(NO3)3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;9H2O, TeO2 and H2O2 at about 200&#8201;&#176;C. By using (NH4)2TeO4 instead of TeO2, a fine powder consisting of microcrystalline spheres of K12+6xFe6Te4&#8722;xO27 was obtained. K12+6xFe6Te4&#8722;xO27 crystallizes in the acentric cubic space group I
3d. [FeIIIO5] pyramids share their apical atoms in [Fe2O9] groups and two of their edges with [TeVIO6] octahedra to form an open framework that consists of two loosely connected, but not interpenetrating, chiral networks. The flexibility of the hinged oxometalate network manifests in a piezoelectric response similar to that of LiNbO3.The potassium cations are mobile in channels that run along the &lt;111&gt; directions and cross in cavities acting as nodes. The ion conductivity of cold&#8208;pressed pellets of ball&#8208;milled K12+6xFe6Te4&#8722;xO27 is 2.3&#215;10&#8722;4 S&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at room temperature. Magnetization measurements and neutron diffraction indicate antiferromagnetic coupling in the [Fe2O9] groups.

         <title>Unveiling the Role of Hydrogen Bonds in Luminescent N&#8208;Annulated Perylene Liquid Crystals</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 57, Page 14282-14286, October 13, 2021. </description>

Getting into position: The position of hydrogen&#8208;bonding amide groups affects the properties of a series of luminescent N&#8208;annulated perylenes that self&#8208;assemble into nanostructured liquid&#8208;crystalline columnar phases. The liquid crystals with the amide linkers close to the central perylene core exhibit liquid&#8208;crystalline phases with a wider temperature range. In contrast, perylenes with ester groups, instead of amides, close to the central core exhibit vapochromism upon exposure to organic solvents.







Abstract
We report the liquid&#8208;crystalline (LC) and luminescent properties of a series of N&#8208;annulated perylenes (1&#8211;4) in whose molecular structures amide and ester groups alternate. We found that the LC properties of these compounds not only depend on the number of hydrogen&#8208;bonding units, but also on the relative position of the amide linkers in the molecule. The absence of amide groups in compound 1 leads to no LC properties, whereas four amide groups induce the formation of a wide temperature range columnar hexagonal phase in compound 4. Remarkably, compound 3, with two amide groups in the inner part of the structure, stabilizes the columnar LC phases better than its structural isomer 2, with the amide groups in the outer part of the molecule. Similarly, we found that only compounds 1 and 2, which have no hydrogen bonding units in the inner part of the molecule, exhibit luminescence vapochromism upon exposure to organic solvent vapors.

     alt="Unveiling the Role of Hydrogen Bonds in Luminescent N-Annulated Perylene Liquid Crystals"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Getting into position&lt;/b&gt;: The position of hydrogen-bonding amide groups affects the properties of a series of luminescent N-annulated perylenes that self-assemble into nanostructured liquid-crystalline columnar phases. The liquid crystals with the amide linkers close to the central perylene core exhibit liquid-crystalline phases with a wider temperature range. In contrast, perylenes with ester groups, instead of amides, close to the central core exhibit vapochromism upon exposure to organic solvents.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We report the liquid-crystalline (LC) and luminescent properties of a series of N-annulated perylenes (&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;&#8211;&lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt;) in whose molecular structures amide and ester groups alternate. We found that the LC properties of these compounds not only depend on the number of hydrogen-bonding units, but also on the relative position of the amide linkers in the molecule. The absence of amide groups in compound &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; leads to no LC properties, whereas four amide groups induce the formation of a wide temperature range columnar hexagonal phase in compound &lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt;. Remarkably, compound &lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt;, with two amide groups in the inner part of the structure, stabilizes the columnar LC phases better than its structural isomer &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;, with the amide groups in the outer part of the molecule. Similarly, we found that only compounds &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;, which have no hydrogen bonding units in the inner part of the molecule, exhibit luminescence vapochromism upon exposure to organic solvent vapors.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Aminotroponiminates: Impact of the NO2 Functional Group on Coordination, Isomerisation, and Backbone Substitution</title>

Unforeseen aspects of ATI chemistry: The impact of a nitro substituent in the backbone of the aminotroponiminate (ATI) ligand on the coordination chemistry and reactivity of alkali metal (Li&#8722;K) complexes has been investigated. This includes the first examples of i) an isolable free ATI anion, ii) E/Z imine isomerisations of ATI species and iii) N,N&#8208;coordinated silver ATIs.







Abstract
Aminotroponiminate (ATI) ligands are a versatile class of redox&#8208;active and potentially cooperative ligands with a rich coordination chemistry that have consequently found a wide range of applications in synthesis and catalysis. While backbone substitution of these ligands has been investigated in some detail, the impact of electron&#8208;withdrawing groups on the coordination chemistry and reactivity of ATIs has been little investigated. We report here Li, Na, and K salts of an ATI ligand with a nitro&#8208;substituent in the backbone. It is demonstrated that the NO2 group actively contributes to the coordination chemistry of these complexes, effectively competing with the N,N&#8208;binding pocket as a coordination site. This results in an unprecedented E/Z isomerisation of an ATI imino group and culminates in the isolation of the first &#8220;naked&#8221; (i.&#8201;e., without directional bonding to a metal atom) ATI anion. Reactions of sodium ATIs with silver(I) and tritylium salts gave the first N,N&#8208;coordinated silver ATI complexes and unprecedented backbone substitution reactions. Analytical techniques applied in this work include multinuclear (VT&#8208;)NMR spectroscopy, single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis, and DFT calculations.

         <title>C&#8722;C Cross&#8208;Couplings from a Cyclometalated Au(III) C
N Complex: Mechanistic Insights and Synthetic Developments</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 57, Page 14322-14334, October 13, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The mechanism of C(sp2)&#8722;C(sp) coupling templated by the Au(III) cyclometalated complex [Au(CCH2N)Cl2] has been investigated. By tuning the reaction conditions and monitoring its progress by NMR, a number of intermediate species involved in the reductive elimination process could be isolated and characterised by different spectroscopic and analytical methods, including XRD, as well as by DFT studies.







Abstract
In recent years, the reactivity of gold complexes was shown to extend well beyond &#960;&#8208;activation and to hold promises to achieve selective cross&#8208;couplings in several C&#8722;C and C&#8722;E (E=heteroatom) bond forming reactions. Here, with the aim of exploiting new organometallic species for cross&#8208;coupling reactions, we report on the Au(III)&#8208;mediated C(sp2)&#8722;C(sp) occurring upon reaction of the cyclometalated complex [Au(CCH2N)Cl2] (1, CCH2N=2&#8208;benzylpyridine) with AgPhCC. The reaction progress has been monitored by NMR spectroscopy, demonstrating the involvement of a number of key intermediates, whose structures have been unambiguously ascertained through 1D and 2D NMR analyses (1H, 13C, 1H&#8208;1H COSY, 1H&#8208;13C HSQC and 1H&#8208;13C HMBC) as well as by HR&#8208;ESI&#8208;MS and X&#8208;ray diffraction studies. Furthermore, crystallographic studies have serendipitously resulted in the authentication of zwitterionic Au(I) complexes as side&#8208;products arising from cyclization of the coupling product in the coordination sphere of gold. The experimental work has been paralleled and complemented by DFT calculations of the reaction profiles, providing valuable insight into the structure and energetics of the key intermediates and transition states, as well as on the coordination sphere of gold along the whole process. Of note, the broader scope of the cross&#8208;coupling at the Au(III) CCH2N centre has also been demonstrated studying the reaction of 1 with C(sp2)&#8208;based nucleophiles, namely vinyl and heteroaryl tin and zinc reagents. These reactions stand as rare examples of C(sp2)&#8722;C(sp2) cross&#8208;couplings at Au(III).

Charge Transfer and Separation. Occurrence of charge transfer and separation processes in newly synthesized porphyrin&#8208;TCBD&#8208;Donor multi&#8208;modular donor&#8208;acceptor systems is reported. The significance of the nature of porphyrins and second electron donor in governing the charge transfer events in these closely positioned conjugates is borne out from the present study.







Abstract
Using a combination of cycloaddition&#8208;retroelectrocyclization reaction, free&#8208;base and zinc porphyrins (H2P and ZnP) are decorated at their &#946;&#8208;pyrrole positions with strong charge transfer complexes, viz., tetracyanobuta&#8208;1,3&#8208;diene (TCBD)&#8208;phenothiazine (3 and 4) or TCBD&#8208;aniline (7 and 8), novel class of push&#8208;pull systems. The physico&#8208;chemical properties of these compounds (MP&#8208;Donor and MP&#8208;TCBD&#8208;Donor) have been investigated using a range of electrochemical, spectroelectrochemical, DFT as well as steady&#8208;state and time&#8208;resolved spectroscopic techniques. Ground&#8208;state charge transfer interactions between the porphyrin and the electron&#8208;withdrawing TCBD directly attached to the porphyrin &#960;&#8208;system extended the absorption features well into the near&#8208;infrared region. To visualize the photo&#8208;events, energy level diagrams with the help of free&#8208;energy calculations have been established. Switching the role of porphyrin from the initial electron acceptor to electron donor was possible to envision. Occurrence of photoinduced charge separation has been established by complementary transient absorption spectral studies followed by global and target data analyses. Better charge stabilization in H2P derived over ZnP derived conjugates, and in phenothiazine derived over aniline derived conjugates has been possible to establish. These findings highlight the importance of the nature of porphyrins and second electron donor in governing the ground and excited state charge transfer events in closely positioned donor&#8208;acceptor conjugates.

         <title>Oxidatively Induced Selective Carbon&#8208;Carbon Bond Formation From Isolated Rhodium(III) Complexes</title>

         <dc:description>
In the oxidation&#8208;induced reaction based on octahedral RhIII complexes synthesized from Rh2(TFA)4 with 2&#8208;arylpyridines, different regioselective C&#8722;C bond formations were achieved by changing the steric and electronic properties of the aryl ligands. This study provides feasible selective activation of C&#8722;H bonds by the oxidation induction of RhIII complexes, which may be useful for the design of new rhodium metal catalysts and development of efficient and highly selective reactions.

This work focuses on oxidatively induced regioselective intramolecular C&#8722;C bond formations based on the RhIII complexes synthesized from dirhodium(II) trifluoroacetate with 2&#8208;arylpyridines. With the selection of electron&#8208;donating groups on the arene rings of 2&#8208;arylpyridines, the unusual meta&#8208;ortho C&#8722;C bond&#8208;forming was favored, which led to the formation of meta&#8208;substituted 2&#8208;arylpyridine homocoupling dimers. On the contrary, the electron&#8208;withdrawing groups have tendency to occur conventional ortho&#8208;ortho bond&#8208;forming, resulting in the formation of new RhIII complexes possessing the intriguing RhIII(TFA)3 fragment. Preliminary mechanistic experiments suggest that the sequential oxidation of RhIII occurred in the reaction.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;In the oxidation-induced&lt;/b&gt; reaction based on octahedral Rh&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt; complexes synthesized from Rh&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(TFA)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; with 2-arylpyridines, different regioselective C&#8722;C bond formations were achieved by changing the steric and electronic properties of the aryl ligands.

Controlled thermolysis of HKUST&#8208;1 produces the partial removal of ligands, the generation of structural defects and additional porosity in a controlled way. The resulting defective materials denoted according to the literature as quasi&#8208;MOFs, were subsequently employed as catalyst for one pot imine synthesis by cross coupling of alcohols with amines.







Abstract
Copper&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic framework (Cu3(BTC)2(H2O)3]n&#8901;nH2OMeOH (HKUST&#8208;1) has been subjected to thermolysis under air atmosphere at different temperatures ranging from 100 to 300&#8201;&#176;C. This treatment produces the partial removal of ligands, the generation of structural defects and additional porosity in a controlled way. The resulting defective materials denoted according to the literature as quasi&#8208;MOFs, were subsequently employed as heterogeneous catalysts in the one pot synthesis of N&#8208;benzylideneaniline from aniline and benzyl alcohol in open air as terminal oxidant at 70&#8201;&#176;C under base&#8208; and dehydrating agent&#8208;free conditions. The Q&#8208;HKUST catalysts calcined at 240&#8201;&#176;C (QH&#8208;240) was the most efficient in the series, promoting imine synthesis. Data from Knoevenagel condensation of malononitrile shows that in QH&#8208;240 the distances of Cu ions in HKUST&#8208;1 cavities are preserved, increasing the Knoevenagel activity, but a strong rearrangement takes place at 300&#8201;&#176;C or above. The unsaturated copper active sites with simultaneous presence of micro&#8208; and mesopores in QH&#8208;240 are responsible for this excellent catalytic performance. The effective parameters on catalytic activity of QH&#8208;240 including deligandation temperature, the amount of catalyst, the ratio of reactants, and reaction temperature as well as the stability and recyclability of the catalyst were also investigated. The possible mechanism used by QH&#8208;240 follows alcohol aerobic oxidation and subsequent anaerobic condensation of aldehyde intermediate with aniline.

         <title>Titanium Vacancies in TiO2 Nanofibers Enable Highly Efficient Photodriven Seawater Splitting</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 57, Page 14202-14208, October 13, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Erosion of corrosion: TiO2 nanofibers with rich Ti vacancies have been designed by a facile controllable calcination approach. They exhibit efficient charge transfer and resistance to corrosion by seawater owing to a unidirectional electron trap and superior H+ adsorption; which contribute to excellent activity and long&#8208;time stability in photodriven seawater splitting. This study could provide a promising strategy for the design of efficient semiconductors in marine applications.







Abstract
Photodriven seawater splitting is considered to be one of the most promising techniques for sustainable hydrogen production. However, the high salinity of seawater would deactivate catalysts and consume the photogenerated carriers. Metal vacancies in metal oxide semiconductors are critical to directed electron transfer and high salinity resistance; they are thus desirable but remain a challenge. We demonstrate a facile controllable calcination approach to synthesize TiO2 nanofibers with rich Ti vacancies with excellent photo/electro performances and long&#8208;time stability in photodriven seawater splitting, including photocatalysis and photo&#8208;electrocatalysis. Experimental measurements and theoretical calculations reveal the formation of titanium vacancies, as well as unidirectional electron trap and superior H+ adsorption ability for efficient charge transfer and resistance to corrosion by seawater. Therefore, atomic&#8208;/nanoscale characteristics and mechanism have been proposed to clarify the generation of titanium vacancies and the corresponding interfacial electron transfer.

         <title>Effectiveness of the Oxygenation over Classical Protonolysis Reactions: A Case of Alkylzinc Complexes Incorporating an Aminoalcoholate Ligand</title>

         <dc:description>
The stepwise controlled oxygenation of a tert&#8208;butylzinc complex incorporating a pridinolum (prinol) ligand affords a dinuclear adduct of a (prinol)ZnOOR moiety with the parent tBuZn(prinol) complex and a novel dimer [tBuOOZn(prinol)]2 with terminal alkylperoxide groups. Strikingly, these seemingly simple zinc alkylperoxides and related zinc alkoxides are not accessible via the classical protonolysis route.







Abstract
Alkylzinc aminoalcoholates have emerged as powerful catalysts in organic synthesis and polymerization processes. Despite extensive research, difficulties in the rational design of these catalytic systems and in&#8208;depth understanding of their modes of action have hitherto been encountered. Most of the major obstacles stem largely from the relatively limited knowledge of the structure&#8208;activity relationship of zinc catalysts. In fact, the key active species are often generated in&#8197;situ via the protonolysis of the alkylzinc precursors, which precludes their isolation and detailed characterization. Herein, the effectiveness of the oxygenation over the classical protonolysis in the synthesis of zinc alkylperoxides stabilized by an aminoalcoholate ligand is demonstrated. The controlled oxygenation of a tert&#8208;butylzinc complex incorporating a pridinolum (prinol) ligand leads to well&#8208;defined a dinuclear adduct of a (prinol)ZnOOtBu moiety with the parent tBuZn(prinol) complex and a novel dimer [tBuOOZn(prinol)]2 with terminal alkylperoxide groups. The observed reaction outcomes strongly depend on the reaction conditions. Although sparse examples of heteroleptic adducts of the [RZn(L)]x[ROOZn(L)]y&#8208;type are known, the herein reported homoleptic [ROOZn(L)]x aggregate is unprecedented. Strikingly, comparative studies involving reactions between tBuZn(prinol) and tert&#8208;butylhydroperoxide or ethanol revealed that the respective seemingly simple zinc alkylperoxides, or zinc alkoxides, respectively, are not accessible via the classical alcoholysis. We believe that these game&#8208;changing results concerning multifaceted chemistry of organozinc aminoalcoholates should pave the way for more rational development of various Zn&#8208;based catalytic systems.

Fluorine on Skatole's scent. Tetramethylammoniumfluoride permits the twofold cyclometallation of 3&#8208;methyl&#8208;2&#8208;indolylphosphine ligands at platinum(ii) complexes. Hydrogen fluoride opens the cyclometallation yielding a unique Pt(ii) complex which exhibits hydrogen&#8208;bonding to the fluorido ligand in its outer coordination sphere. The fluorido complex reacts with an ynamide to give an exceptional metal bound oxazole derivative.







Abstract
The reaction of [PtCl2(COD)] (COD=1,5&#8208;cyclooctadiene) with diisopropyl&#8208;2&#8208;(3&#8208;methyl)indolylphosphine (iPr2P(C9H8N)) led to the formation of the platinum(ii) chlorido complexes, cis&#8208;[PtCl2{iPr2P(C9H8N)}2] (1) and trans&#8208;[PtCl2{iPr2P(C9H8N)}2] (2). The cis&#8208;complex 1 reacted with NEt3 yielding the complex cis&#8208;[PtCl{&#954;2&#8208;(P,N)&#8208;iPr2P(C9H7N)}{iPr2P(C9H8N)}] (3) bearing a cyclometalated &#954;2&#8208;(P,N)&#8208;phosphine ligand, while the isomer 2 with a trans&#8208;configuration did not show any reactivity towards NEt3. Treatment of 1 or 3 with (CH3)4NF (TMAF) resulted in the formation of the twofold cyclometalated complex cis&#8208;[Pt{&#954;2&#8208;(P,N)&#8208;iPr2P(C9H7N)}2] (4). The molecular structures of the complexes 1&#8211;4 were determined by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. The fluorido complex cis&#8208;[PtF{&#954;2&#8208;(P,N)&#8208;iPr2P(C9H7N)}{iPr2P(C9H8N)}]&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;(HF)4 (5&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;(HF)4) was formed when complex 4 was treated with different hydrogen fluoride sources. The Pt(ii) fluorido complex 5&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;(HF)4 exhibits intramolecular hydrogen bonding in its outer coordination sphere between the fluorido ligand and the NH group of the 3&#8208;methylindolyl moiety. In contrast to its chlorido analogue 3, complex 5&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;(HF)4 reacted with CO or the ynamide 1&#8208;(2&#8208;phenylethynyl)&#8208;2&#8208;pyrrolidinone to yield the complexes trans&#8208;[Pt(CO){&#954;2&#8208;(P,C)&#8208;iPr2P(C9H7NCO)}{iPr2P(C9H8N)}][F(HF)4] (7) and a complex, which we suggest to be cis&#8208;[Pt{C=C(Ph)OCN(C3H6)}{&#954;2&#8208;(P,N)&#8208;iPr2P(C9H7N)}{iPr2P(C9H8N)}][F(HF)4] (9), respectively. The structure of 9 was assigned on the basis of DFT calculations as well as NMR and IR data. Hydrogen bonding of HF and NH to fluoride was proven to be crucial for the existence of 7 and 9.

         <title>Contorted Heteroannulated Tetraareno[a,d,j,m]coronenes</title>

Tuning tetraarenocoronenes: Cata&#8208;condensed heteroannulated tetraarenocoronenes with C2h symmetry have been obtained from three doubly brominated diarenoperylenes. X&#8208;ray diffraction showed that the coronenes mostly adopt S&#8208;shaped contorted &#960;&#8208;planes. The large variety of fused rings in the coronenes&#8242; core allows good control of their photophysical properties and thus their potential use in organic electronics applications.







Abstract
Fused polycyclic aromatic compounds are interesting materials for organic electronics applications. To fine&#8208;tune photophysical or electrochemical properties, either various substituents can be attached or heteroatoms (such as N or S) can be incorporated into the fused aromatic backbone. Coronenes and heterocoronenes are promising compounds in this respect. Up until now, the possibilities for varying the attached fused heteroaromatics at the coronene core were quite limited, and realizing both electron&#8208;withdrawing and &#8208;donating rings at the same time was very difficult. Here, a series of pyridine, anisole and thiophene annulated tetraareno[a,d,j,m]coronenes has been synthesized by a facile two&#8208;step route that is a combination of Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling and a following cyclization step, starting from three different diarenoperylene dibromides. The contorted molecular &#960;&#8208;planes of the obtained cata&#8208;condensed tetraarenocoronenes were analyzed by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray crystallography, and the photophysical and electrochemical properties were systematically investigated by UV/Vis spectroscopy and cyclovoltammetry.

Maybe diamonds aren&#8242;t forever: Cubic diamond (Fd
m) silicon has been the material driver for electronics from the onset. In that structure, however, it absorbs and emits light inefficiently and offers no compositional tunability of properties. Both issues have been addressed by creating bulk GeSi solid solutions under pressure that are recovered in a different cubic structure (la
). This structure now transforms to a tunable hexagonal one that may not suffer from silicon's deficiencies.







Abstract
Multi&#8208;anvil and laser&#8208;heated diamond anvil methods have been used to subject Ge and Si mixtures to pressures and temperatures of between 12 and 17&#8197;GPa and 1500&#8211;1800&#8197;K, respectively. Synchrotron angle dispersive X&#8208;ray diffraction, precession electron diffraction and chemical analysis using electron microscopy, reveal recovery at ambient pressure of hexagonal Ge&#8722;Si solid solutions (P63/mmc). Taken together, the multi&#8208;anvil and diamond anvil results reveal that hexagonal solid solutions can be prepared for all Ge&#8722;Si compositions. This hexagonal class of solid solutions constitutes a significant expansion of the bulk Ge&#8722;Si solid solution family, and is of interest for optoelectronic applications.

Repair and reuse: The recovery of waste LiCoO2 material is realized by the combination of industrial machinery process and small&#8208;scale equipment repair technology. The results showed that the crystal structure of the material was repaired with the excellent electrochemical performance.







Abstract
A large number of lithium batteries have been retiring from the market of energy storage. Thus, recycling of the used electrode materials is becoming urgent. In this study, an industrial machinery processing was used to recover the crystal structure of the waste LiCoO2 materials with the combination of small&#8208;scale equipment repair technology. The results show that the crystal parameters of the repaired LiCoO2 material become small, the unit cell volume is reduced, and the crystal structure tends to be stable. The Co&#8722;O bond length of 1.9134&#8197;nm, O&#8722;Co&#8722;O bond angle of 94.72&#176;, the (003) interplanar spacing of 0.467&#8197;nm indicate the excellent recovery level of the repaired LiCoO2. In addition, the electrochemical performance of the repaired LiCoO2 material is greatly improved, compared with the waste material. The capacity of the repaired electrode material can be maintained at 120&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 100 cycles at the current density of 0.2C. The promising rate performance of the repaired electrode material demonstrates the stable structure. This research work provides a large&#8208;scale method for the direct recovery of LiCoO2 with the reduction of unnecessary energy and reagent consumption, which will be beneficial to the environmental protection.

         <title>A Small&#8208;Molecule Diketopyrrolopyrrole&#8208;Based Dye for in&#8197;vivo NIR&#8208;IIa Fluorescence Bioimaging</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 57, Page 14240-14249, October 13, 2021. </description>

Based on the small&#8208;molecule DPP&#8208;based fluorophore T25 with NIR&#8208;II and NIR&#8208;IIa emission, T25@F127 were selected for fluorescence angiography and cerebral vascular microscopic imaging of mice with nearly 800&#8197;&#956;m penetrating depth and excellent signal&#8208;background ratio of 4.07 and 2.26 (at 250 and 400&#8197;&#956;m), respectively. Furthermore, T25@cRGD with tumor targeting ability could image tiny metastatic tumor on intestine with a small size of 0.3&#8197;mm&#215;1.0&#8197;mm.







Abstract
Organic small&#8208;molecule fluorophores with near&#8208;infrared IIa (NIR&#8208;IIa) emission have great potential in pre&#8208;clinical detection and inoperative imaging due to the high&#8208;spatial resolution and deep penetration. However, developments of the NIR&#8208;IIa fluorophores are still facing considerable challenges. In this work, a series of diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP)&#8208;based fluorophores were designed and synthesized. Subsequently, nanomaterial T25@F127 with significant NIR&#8208;IIa emission properties was rationally prepared by encapsulating DPP&#8208;based fluorophore T25, and was selected for fluorescence angiography and cerebral vascular microscopic imaging with nearly 800&#8197;&#956;m penetrating depth and excellent signal&#8208;background ratio of 4.07 and 2.26 (at 250 and 400&#8197;&#956;m), respectively. Furthermore, the nanomaterial T25@cRGD with tumor targeting ability can image tiny metastatic tumor on intestine with a small size of 0.3&#8197;mm&#215;1.0&#8197;mm and high&#8208;spatial resolution (SBR=3.84). This study demonstrates that the nanomaterials which encapsulated T25 behave as excellent NIR&#8208;IIa fluorescence imaging agents and have a great potential for in&#8197;vivo biological application.

         <title>Synthesis of Oligonucleotides Containing Trans Mitomycin C DNA Adducts at N6 of Adenine and N2 of Guanine</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 57, Page 14263-14272, October 13, 2021. </description>

A route to access modified oligonucleotides containing trans dA monoadducts produced from the reaction between mitomycin C and DNA is presented. Parent oligonucleotides containing a trans dG monoadduct and a trans dG&#8208;MC&#8208;dG ICL were also produced. The stability and spectral properties of all substrates were compared and virtual models were created to explore the conformational space and structural features of these MC&#8208;DNA complexes.







Abstract
Mitomycin C, (MC), an antitumor drug, is a DNA alkylating agent currently used in the clinics. Inert in its native form, MC is reduced to reactive mitosenes, which undergo nucleophilic attack by guanine or adenine bases in DNA to form monoadducts as well as interstrand crosslinks (ICLs). Although ICLs are considered the most cytotoxic lesions, the role of each individual adduct in the drug's cytotoxicity is still not fully understood. Synthetic routes have been developed to access modified oligonucleotides containing dG MC&#8208;monoadducts and dG&#8208;MC&#8208;dG ICL at a single position of their base sequences to investigate the biological effects of these adducts. However, until now, oligonucleotides containing monoadducts formed by MC at the adenine base had not been available, thus preventing the examination of the role played by these lesions in the toxicity of MC. Here, we present a route to access these substrates. Structural proof of the adducted oligonucleotides were provided by enzymatic digestion to nucleosides and high&#8208;resolution mass spectral analysis. Additionally, parent oligonucleotides containing a dG monoadduct and a dG&#8208;MC&#8208;dG ICL were also produced. The stability and physical properties of all substrates were compared via CD spectroscopy and UV melting temperature studies. Finally, virtual models were created to explore the conformational space and structural features of these MC&#8208;DNA complexes.

Hidden crystals: With a modified synthesis approach and micro&#8208;fabrication technique, it was possible to isolate micrometer&#8208;sized single crystals of AlCr2 from a largely polycrystalline sample. Chemical bond analysis shows close relation to elements, in contrast to a quite localized bonding pattern in the prototype, MoSi2.







Abstract
In a joint effort utilizing modified sample preparation, microscopy, X&#8208;ray diffraction and micro&#8208;fabrication, it became possible to prepare single crystals of the &#8220;hidden&#8221; phase AlCr2. High&#8208;resolution X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis is described in detail for two crystals with the similar overall composition, but different degree of disorder, which seems to be the main cause for the differing unit cell parameters. Chemical bonding analysis of AlCr2 in comparison to prototypical MoSi2 shows pronounced differences reflecting the interchange of main group element vs. transition metal as majority component.

         <title>Frontispiece: Liquid&#8208;Crystalline Polymer Particles Prepared by Classical Polymerization Techniques</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 57, October 13, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polymerization techniques such as suspension, mini&#8208;emulsion, dispersion, and precipitation polymerization produce LC polymer particles of various sizes, LC phases, and molecular alignments, and hence should be used in accordance with the targeted properties. The particles have found applications as rotors, absorbents, cell scaffolds, reflectors, actuators, and drug carriers. Although usually &#8220;homogeneous&#8221;, LC polymer particles with distinctive chemical domains or complex physical structures could bring more functionality. For more details on the techniques, results, and possible improvements, see the Minireview by J.&#8197;P.&#8197;A. Heuts, A.&#8197;P.&#8197;H.&#8197;J. Schenning et al. on page 14168&#8197;ff.

There is a pressing engineering need to produce hexagonal SiGe, that is untemplated, to be able to develop optoelectronic devices with hex&#8208;SiGe and Si integrated on the same chip. We have contributed the timely, broad&#8208;interest advance of producing a bulk hexagonal SiGe landscape and explain how and under what conditions each Si&#8211;Ge composition becomes hexagonal. Moreover, the ability to synthesize different hexagonal polytypes affords further tailoring of optoelectronic properties. More information can be found in the Full Paper by G. Serghiou et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202102595).

The quite &#8216;hidden&#8217; compound AlCr2 was isolated for the first time as micro&#8208;fabricated single crystals. Crystal structure and chemical bonding analyses reveal largely different interactions as a consequence of the inverted coloring pattern with respect to prototypical MoSi2.

Rich Ti vacancies in TiO2 nanofibers are presented in the Full Paper by X.&#8208;Y. Yang and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202101817). The unidirectional electron trap and directional H+ adsorption ability of Ti vacancies enable efficient charge transfer and resistance to the corrosion of seawater. They thus contribute excellent activity and long&#8208;time stability to photodriven seawater splitting, opening a door to marine applications of semiconductors.

Getting things in order: Liquid crystal (LC) polymer particles have a unique anisotropic supramolecular order that distinguishes them from conventional polymer particles. This review focuses on the preparation of LC polymer particles by classical polymerization techniques, including suspension, mini&#8208;emulsion, dispersion and precipitation polymerization. The particle size, LC phases, alignment, properties and applications are also presented.







Abstract
Liquid&#8208;crystalline polymer particles prepared by classical polymerization techniques are receiving increased attention as promising candidates for use in a variety of applications including micro&#8208;actuators, structurally colored objects, and absorbents. These particles have anisotropic molecular order and liquid&#8208;crystalline phases that distinguish them from conventional polymer particles. In this minireview, the preparation of liquid&#8208;crystalline polymer particles from classical suspension, (mini&#8208;)emulsion, dispersion, and precipitation polymerization reactions are discussed. The particle sizes, molecular orientations, and liquid&#8208;crystalline phases produced by each technique are summarized and compared. We conclude with a discussion of the challenges and prospects of the preparation of liquid&#8208;crystalline polymer particles by classical polymerization techniques.

         <title>Application of Multinuclear MAS NMR for the in&#8197;situ Monitoring of Hydrothermal Synthesis of Zeolites</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 57, Page 14143-14167, October 13, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The potential of in&#8197;situ multinuclear MAS NMR spectroscopy for monitoring hydrothermal synthesis of zeolites is demonstrated in the Review. The technique enables the detection of intermediate species stable only under hydrothermal conditions, provides information on the kinetics of synthesis and gives insight into the mechanism of gel formation, gel aging, crystal nucleation and growth.







Abstract
In situ MAS NMR studies on the monitoring of hydrothermal synthesis of zeolites are reviewed. The first part of the review contains information on the experimental techniques used for the in&#8197;situ NMR studies in static and MAS conditions. In the second part, the main capabilities of the in&#8197;situ 1H, 11B, 13C, 14N, 19F, 23Na, 27Al, 29Si and 31P MAS NMR for the elucidation of the mechanism of hydrothermal synthesis of zeolites are examined and the data on NMR lines identification are summarized. In the last part the main application areas of the techniques are considered and illustrated with examples taken from the mechanistic studies of zeolites A, X, MFI and BEA synthesis. A cross&#8208;reference index between the materials studied, the experimental approaches used, the mechanistic information obtained, and the corresponding literature sources is established.

         <title>Hydrogenation of Secondary Amides using Phosphane Oxide and Frustrated Lewis Pair Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 57, Page 14179-14183, October 13, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The hydrogenation of secondary carboxylic acid amides by combined phosphane oxide and frustrated Lewis pair catalysis is described. The reaction proceeds under mild conditions and displays excellent functional group tolerance. Kinetic and quantum&#8208;chemical experiments support the autoinduced catalytic cycle with chloride as active Lewis base for the hydrogen activation.







Abstract
The metal&#8208;free catalytic hydrogenation of secondary carboxylic acid amides is developed. The reduction is realized by two new catalytic reactions. First, the amide is converted into the imidoyl chloride by triphosgene (CO(OCCl3)2) using novel phosphorus(V) catalysts. Second, the in&#8197;situ generated imidoyl chlorides are hydrogenated in high yields by an FLP&#8208;catalyst. Mechanistic and quantum mechanical calculations support an autoinduced catalytic cycle for the hydrogenation with chloride acting as unusual Lewis base for FLP&#8208;mediated H2&#8208;activation.

         <title>A Self&#8208;immolative Molecular Beacon for Amplified Nucleic Acid Detection**
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 57, Page 14189-14194, October 13, 2021. </description>

The target as catalyst: A new category of nucleic acid&#8208;templated reaction is introduced. Binding of a self&#8208;immolative molecular beacon (iMB) to a DNA/RNA target can trigger a photocatalyzed cleavage reaction. The products have lower target affinity than the iMB before the reaction. This enables the target to act as a catalyst providing chemical amplification of signals. The unimolecular iMB probe allowed detection of 5&#8197;pm RNA within 100&#8197;min.







Abstract
Fluorogenic hybridization probes allow the detection of RNA and DNA sequences in homogeneous solution. Typically, one target molecule activates the fluorescence of a single probe molecule. This limits the sensitivity of nucleic acid detection. Herein, we report a self&#8208;immolative molecular beacon (iMB) that escapes the one&#8208;target/one&#8208;probe paradigm. The iMB probe includes a photoreductively cleavable N&#8208;alkyl&#8208;picolinium (NAP) linkage within the loop region. A fluorophore at the 5&#8217;&#8208;end serves, on the one hand, as a reporter group and, on the other hand, as a photosensitizer of a NAP&#8208;linker cleavage reaction. In the absence of target, the iMB adopts a hairpin shape. Quencher groups prevent photo&#8208;induced cleavage. The iMB opens upon hybridization with a target, and both fluorescent emission as well as photo&#8208;reductive cleavage of the NAP linker can occur. In contrast to previous chemical amplification reactions, iMBs are unimolecular probes that undergo cleavage leading to products that have lower target affinity than the probes before reaction. Aided by catalysis, the method allowed the detection of 5&#8197;pm RNA target within 100&#8197;min.

         <title>High&#8208;Pressure Synthesis of Sc5P12N23O3 and Ti5P12N24O2 by Activation of the Binary Nitrides ScN and TiN with NH4F</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 57, Page 14184-14188, October 13, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The oxonitridophosphates Sc5P12N23O3 and Ti5P12N24O2 have been prepared by high&#8208;pressure high&#8208;temperature reactions from the refractory nitrides ScN and TiN, respectively. These reactions were enabled by the addition of NH4F as a mineralizing agent. The crystal structures were elucidated by a combination of SCXRD, BVS calculations and magnetic measurements for Ti5P12N24O2 revealing two distinct crystallographic sites occupied by either Ti3+ or Ti4+, respectively.







Abstract
Multinary transition metal nitrides and oxonitrides are a versatile and intriguing class of compounds. However, they have been investigated far less than pure oxides. The compounds Sc5P12N23O3 and Ti5P12N24O2 have now been synthesized from the binary nitrides ScN and TiN, respectively, by following a high&#8208;pressure high&#8208;temperature approach at 8&#8197;GPa and 1400&#8201;&#176;C. NH4F acts as a mineralizing agent that supports product formation and crystallization. The starting materials ScN and TiN are seemingly an uncommon choice because of their chemical inertness but, nevertheless, react under these conditions. Sc5P12N23O3 and Ti5P12N24O2 crystallize isotypically with Ti5B12O26, consisting of solely vertex&#8208;sharing P(O/N)4 tetrahedra forming two independent interpenetrating diamond&#8208;like nets that host TM(O/N)6 (TM=Sc, Ti) octahedra. Ti5P12N24O2 is a mixed&#8208;valence compound and shows ordering of Ti3+ and Ti4+ ions.

         <dc:description>
A visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven and room temperature photo&#8208;Wolff&#8211;Kischner reaction of sulfur ylides and N&#8208;tosylhydrazones has been developed for the first time to provide modular access to alkene synthesis. The high functional group tolerance and broad substrate scope were demonstrated by more than 60 examples. Both E&#8208; and Z&#8208;olefinic stereochemistry in the products could be controlled with excellent stereoselectivity. A series of mechanistic studies support that the reaction should proceed through a radical&#8208;carbanion crossover pathway. PC=photoredox catalysis. SET=single&#8208;electron transfer.

         <title>How to Look for Compounds: Predictive Screening and in&#8197;situ Studies in Na&#8722;Zn&#8722;Bi System</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A structure prediction algorithm was used to assess the stability of the ternary compounds in the Na&#8722;Zn&#8722;Bi system followed by rapid experimental screening via the hydride synthesis route and in&#8197;situ synchrotron X&#8208;ray diffraction studies. Such a synergistic approach has yielded four new compounds in the previously &#8220;empty&#8221; Na&#8722;Zn&#8722;Bi system. The advanced electronic structure calculation for the synthesized compounds were performed to rationalize the experimentally observed non&#8208;stoichiometry, while in&#8197;situ powder X&#8208;ray diffraction revealed the high&#8208;temperature polymorphism.







Abstract
Here, the combination of theoretical computations followed by rapid experimental screening and in&#8197;situ diffraction studies is demonstrated as a powerful strategy for novel compounds discovery. When applied for the previously &#8220;empty&#8221; Na&#8722;Zn&#8722;Bi system, such an approach led to four novel phases. The compositional space of this system was rapidly screened via the hydride route method and the theoretically predicted NaZnBi (PbClF type, P4/nmm) and Na11Zn2Bi5 (Na11Cd2Sb5 type, P
) phases were successfully synthesized, while other computationally generated compounds on the list were rejected. In addition, single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction studies of NaZnBi indicate minor deviations from the stoichiometric 1&#8201;:&#8201;1&#8201;:&#8201;1 molar ratio. As a result, two isostructural (PbClF type, P4/nmm) Zn&#8208;deficient phases with similar compositions, but distinctly different unit cell parameters were discovered. The vacancies on Zn sites and unit cell expansion were rationalized from bonding analysis using electronic structure calculations on stoichiometric &#8220;NaZnBi&#8221;. In&#8208;situ synchrotron powder X&#8208;ray diffraction studies shed light on complex equilibria in the Na&#8722;Zn&#8722;Bi system at elevated temperatures. In particular, the high&#8208;temperature polymorph HT&#8208;Na3Bi (BiF3 type, Fm
m) was obtained as a product of Na11Zn2Bi5 decomposition above 611&#8197;K. HT&#8208;Na3Bi cannot be stabilized at room temperature by quenching, and this type of structure was earlier observed in the high&#8208;pressure polymorph HP&#8208;Na3Bi above 0.5&#8197;GPa. The aforementioned approach of predictive synthesis can be extended to other multinary systems.

&lt;i&gt;m&lt;/i&gt;) was obtained as a product of Na&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt;Zn&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Bi&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; decomposition above 611&#8197;K. &lt;i&gt;HT&lt;/i&gt;-Na&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Bi cannot be stabilized at room temperature by quenching, and this type of structure was earlier observed in the high-pressure polymorph &lt;i&gt;HP&lt;/i&gt;-Na&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Bi above 0.5&#8197;GPa. The aforementioned approach of predictive synthesis can be extended to other multinary systems.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Lewis Acid&#8208;Promoted Oxidative Addition at a [Ni0(diphosphine)2] Complex: The Critical Role of a Secondary Coordination Sphere</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The elementary steps of metal&#8208;mediated catalysis e.&#8201;g., oxidative addition, transmetalation, and reductive elimination are pertinent to the design of superior routes into specialty chemicals, pharmaceuticals, and agrochemicals. For over 50&#8197;years, pioneering work has shown that 18&#8208;electron alkyl/aryl&#8208;substituted diphosphine complexes of Group 10 [M(diphosphine)2] do not oxidatively add haloarenes. Herein, we report a compound that is contrary to this &#8216;rule&#8217;, advancing our understanding of oxidative addition at coordinatively saturated organometallic complexes and providing new opportunities for bond activation.







Abstract
Oxidative addition represents a critical elementary step in myriad catalytic transformations. Here, the importance of thoughtful ligand design cannot be overstated. In this work, we report the intermolecular activation of iodobenzene (PhI) at a coordinatively saturated 18&#8208;electron [Ni0(diphosphine)2] complex bearing a Lewis acidic secondary coordination sphere. Whereas alkyl&#8208;substituted diphosphine complexes of Group 10 are known to be unreactive in such reactions, we show that [Ni0(P2BCy4)2] (P2BCy4=1,2&#8208;bis(di(3&#8208;dicyclohexylboraneyl)&#8208;propylphosphino)ethane) is competent for room&#8208;temperature PhI cleavage to give [NiII(P2BCy4)(Ph)(I)]. This difference in oxidative addition reactivity has been scrutinized computationally &#8211; an outcome that is borne out in ring&#8208;opening to provide the reactive precursor &#8211; for [Ni0(P2BCy4)2], a &#8220;boron&#8208;trapped&#8221; 16&#8208;electron &#954;1&#8208;diphosphine Ni(0) complex. Moreover, formation of [NiII(P2BCy4)(Ph)(I)] is inherent to the P2BCy4 secondary coordination sphere: treatment of the Lewis adduct, [Ni0(P2BCy4)2(DMAP)8] with PhI provides [NiII(P2BCy4)2(DMAP)8(I)]I via iodine&#8208;atom abstraction and not a [NiII(Ph)(I)(diphosphine)] compound &#8211; an unusual secondary sphere effect. Finally, the reactivity of [Ni0(P2BCy4)2] with 4&#8208;iodopyridine was surveyed, which resulted in a pyridyl&#8208;borane linked oligomer. The implications of these outcomes are discussed in the context of designing strongly donating, and yet labile diphosphine ligands for use in a critical bond activation step relevant to catalysis.

         <title>Full&#8208;Atom Model of the Agonist LPS&#8208;Bound Toll&#8208;like Receptor 4 Dimer in a Membrane Environment</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pushing against the limits of all&#8208;atom molecular dynamics simulations&#8242; capability, the agonist lipopolysaccharide&#8208;bound full&#8208;length Toll&#8208;like receptor 4 dimer complex, embedded into a realistic plasma membrane, is addressed. Atomic/molecular and thermodynamic insights are provided for TLR4&#8242;s assembly and biological activity.







Abstract
The Toll&#8208;like receptor 4 (TLR4)/myeloid differentiation factor 2 (MD&#8208;2) innate immunity system is a membrane receptor of paramount importance as therapeutic target. Its assembly, upon binding of Gram&#8208;negative bacteria lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and also dependent on the membrane composition, finally triggers the immune response cascade. We have combined ab&#8208;initio calculations, molecular docking, all&#8208;atom molecular dynamics simulations, and thermodynamics calculations to provide the most realistic and complete 3D models of the active full TLR4 complex embedded into a realistic membrane to date. Our studies give functional and structural insights into the transmembrane domain behavior in different membrane environments, the ectodomain bouncing movement, and the dimerization patterns of the intracellular Toll/Interleukin&#8208;1 receptor domain. Our work provides TLR4 models as reasonable 3D structures for the (TLR4/MD&#8208;2/LPS)2 architecture accounting for the active (agonist) state of the TLR4, and pointing to a signal transduction mechanism across cell membrane. These observations unveil relevant molecular aspects involved in the TLR4 innate immune pathways and will promote the discovery of new TLR4 modulators.

Tetracyanobuta&#8208;1,3&#8208;diene (TCBD) is a powerful and versatile electron&#8208;acceptor moiety widely used for the preparation of electroactive conjugates.

Abstract
Tetracyanobuta&#8208;1,3&#8208;diene (TCBD) is a powerful and versatile electron&#8208;acceptor moiety widely used for the preparation of electroactive conjugates. While many reports addressing its electron&#8208;accepting capability have appeared in the literature, significantly scarcer are those dealing with its chemical modification, a relevant topic which allows to broaden the chemical space of this interesting functional unit. Here, we report on the first example of a high&#8208;yielding cyano&#8208;Diels&#8208;Alder (CDA) reaction between TCBD, that is, where a nitrile group acts as a dienophile, and an anthryl moiety, that is, acting as a diene. The resulting anthryl&#8208;fused&#8208;TCBD derivative, which structure was unambiguously identified by X&#8208;ray diffraction, shows high thermal stability, remarkable electron&#8208;accepting capability, and interesting electronic ground&#8208; and excited&#8208;state features, as characterized by a thorough theoretical, electrochemical, and photophysical investigation. Moreover, a detailed kinetic analysis of the intramolecular CDA reaction transforming the anthryl&#8208;TCBD&#8208;based reactant into the anthryl&#8208;fused&#8208;TCBD product was carried out at different temperatures.

         <title>Thermal Expansion Properties and Mechanochemical Synthesis of Stoichiometric Cocrystals Containing Tetrabromobenzene as a Hydrogen&#8208; and Halogen&#8208;Bond Donor</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thermal expansion defines by composition: Cocrystals containing different stoichiometric ratios of the components 1,2,4,5&#8208;tetrabromobenzene (TBrB) and 4,4&#8242;&#8208;azobipyridine (Azo) exhibit dramatically different thermal expansion (TE) behaviors. The components in the stoichiometric cocrystals interact through hydrogen or hydrogen/halogen bonds and differ in &#960;&#8208;stacking arrangements. The structural differences results in the unique TE behaviors for each solid. The cocrystals form concomitantly, and mechanochemical synthesis demonstrates that mixtures or pure phases can be synthesized by varying the feed ratios of the components.







Abstract
The solution and mechanochemical synthesis of two cocrystals that differ in the stoichiometric ratio of the components (stoichiometric cocrystals) is reported. The components in the stoichiometric cocrystals interact through hydrogen or hydrogen/halogen bonds and differ in &#960;&#8208;stacking arrangements. The difference in structure and noncovalent interactions affords dramatically different thermal expansion behaviors in the two cocrystals. At certain molar ratios, the cocrystals are obtained concomitantly; however, by varying the ratios, a single stoichiometric cocrystal is achieved using mechanochemistry.

     alt="Thermal Expansion Properties and Mechanochemical Synthesis of Stoichiometric Cocrystals Containing Tetrabromobenzene as a Hydrogen- and Halogen-Bond Donor"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Thermal expansion defines by composition&lt;/b&gt;: Cocrystals containing different stoichiometric ratios of the components 1,2,4,5-tetrabromobenzene (TBrB) and 4,4&#8242;-azobipyridine (Azo) exhibit dramatically different thermal expansion (TE) behaviors. The components in the stoichiometric cocrystals interact through hydrogen or hydrogen/halogen bonds and differ in &#960;-stacking arrangements. The structural differences results in the unique TE behaviors for each solid. The cocrystals form concomitantly, and mechanochemical synthesis demonstrates that mixtures or pure phases can be synthesized by varying the feed ratios of the components.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The solution and mechanochemical synthesis of two cocrystals that differ in the stoichiometric ratio of the components (stoichiometric cocrystals) is reported. The components in the stoichiometric cocrystals interact through hydrogen or hydrogen/halogen bonds and differ in &#960;-stacking arrangements. The difference in structure and noncovalent interactions affords dramatically different thermal expansion behaviors in the two cocrystals. At certain molar ratios, the cocrystals are obtained concomitantly; however, by varying the ratios, a single stoichiometric cocrystal is achieved using mechanochemistry.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Turning the Light on Phenols: New Opportunities in Organic Synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Phenols in the spotlight: Phenol and its derivatives are key moieties in organic chemistry. Conventionally, they are prepared through thermal functionalization strategies that present several drawbacks. Recently, alternative photochemical approaches have been implemented that involves phenols both as light&#8208;harvesting substrates or as photo&#8208;redox catalysts. This Minireview summarizes the most relevant examples within this field, highlighting the great versatility of simple phenolic frameworks in organic synthesis.







Abstract
Phenols (I) are extremely relevant chemical functionalities in natural, synthetic and industrial chemistry. Their corresponding electron&#8208;rich anions, namely phenolates (I), are characterized by interesting physicochemical properties that can be drastically altered upon light excitation. Specifically, phenolates (I) become strong reducing agents in the excited state and are able to generate reactive radicals from suitable precursors via single&#8208;electron transfer processes. Thus, these species can photochemically trigger strategic bond&#8208;forming reactions, including their direct aromatic C&#8722;H functionalization. Moreover, substituted phenolate anions can act as photocatalysts to enable synthetically useful organic transformations. An alternative mechanistic manifold is represented by the ability of phenolate derivatives I to form ground state electron donor&#8208;acceptor (EDA) complexes with electron&#8208;poor radical sources. These complementary scenarios have paved the way for the development of a wide range of relevant organic reactions. In this Minireview, we present the main examples of this research field, and give insight on emerging trends in phenols photocatalysis towards richer organic synthesis.

         <title>Elastic Organic Crystals Based on Barbituric Derivative: Multi&#8208;faceted Bending and Flexible Optical Waveguide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A molecule (DBDT) was synthesized by a simple one&#8208;step reaction, and the centimeter&#8208;scale needle&#8208;like crystals were prepared by slow volatilization in DCM/CH3OH (v/v=2/8). Upon applying or removing the mechanical force, both the (100) and (040) faces of the needle&#8208;like crystal showed reversible bending behaviour, showing the nature of multi&#8208;faceted bending. Fortunately, the elastic crystals also exhibited optical waveguide characteristics in straight or bent state.







Abstract
Elastic organic single crystals with light&#8208;emitting and multi&#8208;faceted bending properties are extremely rare. They have potential application in optical materials and have attracted the extensive attention of researchers. In this paper, we reported a structurally simple barbituric derivative DBDT, which was easily crystallized and gained long needle&#8208;like crystals (centimeter&#8208;scale) in DCM/CH3OH (v/v=2/8). Upon applying or removing the mechanical force, both the (100) and (040) faces of the needle&#8208;like crystal showed reversible bending behaviour, showing the nature of multi&#8208;faceted bending. The average hardness (H) and elastic modulus (E) were 0.28&#177;0.01&#8197;GPa and 4.56&#177;0.03&#8197;GPa for the (040) plane, respectively. Through the analysis of the single crystal data, it could be seen that the van der waals (C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; and C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;C), H&#8208;bond (C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O) and &#960;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; interactions between molecules were responsible for the generation of the crystal elasticity. Interestingly, elastic crystals exhibited optical waveguide characteristics in straight or bent state. The optical loss coefficients measured at 627&#8197;nm were 0.7&#8197;dBmm&#8722;1 (straight state) and 0.9&#8197;dBmm&#8722;1 (bent state), while the optical loss coefficient (&#945;) were 1.5&#8197;dBmm&#8722;1 (straight state) and 1.8&#8197;dBmm&#8722;1 (bent state) at 567&#8197;nm. Notably, the elastic organic molecular crystal based on barbituric derivative could be used as the candidate for flexible optical devices.

         <title>Kinetic Stabilization of Blue&#8208;Emissive Anthracenes: Phenylene Bridging Works Best</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In attempts at kinetically stabilizing blue&#8208;emissive anthracenes a series of 9,10&#8208;biarylated derivatives were investigated. Bis&#8208;meta&#8208;terphenylyl substitution highly increased photochemical and photooxidative stability. Ring closure to [6]cyclo&#8208;meta&#8208;hexaphenylene bridged anthracene increased protection even further resulting in an additional stabilization.







Abstract
In attempts at kinetically stabilizing blue&#8208;emissive anthracenes, a series of 9,10&#8208;diaryl substituted derivatives were tested for their photochemical and photooxidative persistence. A major breakthrough in light fastness comes from a new bis&#8208;meta&#8208;terphenylyl substituted anthracene which is much superior to industrially relevant 9,10&#8208;biarylated anthracenes. The key issue is the steric shielding of the anthracene core. Further, intramolecular ring closure via Yamamoto coupling furnished a doubly bridged anthracene as a &#8220;self&#8208;encapsulated&#8221; sky&#8208;blue emitter which is most resistant to photodegradation. The improved stabilization was corroborated by time&#8208;resolved irradiation experiments and rationalized by X&#8208;ray crystallography.

         <title>A Molecular Photosensitizer in a Porous Block Copolymer Matrix&#8208;Implications for the Design of Photocatalytically Active Membranes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Ru photosensitizer covalently bound to a porous block copolymer membrane to be used in photocatalytic systems exhibits an additional charge transfer process unobserved in aprotic solvents due to protonation from water molecules absorbed in the polymer. The inhomogeneity due to different orientations of the bound photosensitizer together with its rigidity in the polymer could serve as important set screws for controlling the overall photocatalytic efficiency.







Abstract
Recently, porous photocatalytically active block copolymer membranes were introduced, based on heterogenized molecular catalysts. Here, we report the integration of the photosensitizer, i.&#8201;e., the light absorbing unit in an intermolecular photocatalytic system into block copolymer membranes in a covalent manner. We study the resulting structure and evaluate the orientational mobility of the photosensitizer as integral part of the photocatalytic system in such membranes. To this end we utilize transient absorption anisotropy, highlighting the temporal reorientation of the transition dipole moment probed in a femtosecond pump&#8208;probe experiment. Our findings indicate that the photosensitizer is rigidly bound to the polymer membrane and shows a large heterogeneity of absolute anisotropy values as a function of location probed within the matrix. This reflects the sample inhomogeneity arising from different protonation states of the photosensitizer and different intermolecular interactions of the photosensitizers within the block copolymer membrane scaffold.

         <title>Explaining the Advantageous Impact of Tertiary versus Secondary Nitrogen Centre on the Activity of PNP&#8208;Pincer Co(I)&#8208;Complexes for Catalytic Hydrogenation of CO2</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Pincer ligated coordination complexes of base metals have shown remarkable catalytic activity for hydrogenation/dehydrogenation of CO  2  .&#160;The recently reported MeN[CH  2  CH  2  i  Pr  2  )]  2  Co(I)PNP&#8208;pincer complex was shown to exhibit substantially higher catalytic activity in comparison to the corresponding catalyst,&#160; HN[CH  2  CH  2  i  Pr  2  )]  2  Co(I)PNP, bearing a secondary nitrogen center on the pincer ligand. Here, we computationally investigate the mechanisms for hydrogenation of CO  2  to formate catalyzed by these two Co&#8208;PNP complexes to explain how such a small structural difference could have a sizable impact on their catalytic activity. Plausible hydrogenation routes were examined in details and our findings provide solid support for the experimental observations. Our results reveal that such trends in catalytic activity could be explained from the lower activation barrier for the hydride transfer step upon changing the pincer nitrogen center from secondary to tertiary.</dc:description>

         <title>Photochemical Hydrogen Evolution at Metal Centers Probed with Hydrated Aluminum Cations, Al+(H2O)n, n = 1&#8211;10</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hydrated aluminum cations are investigated as a photochemical model system with up to 10 water molecules by UV action spectroscopy in a Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance (FT&#8208;ICR) mass spectrometer. Intense photodissociation has been observed starting at 4.5 eV ranging from two to eight water molecules by loss of atomic hydrogen, molecular hydrogen and water molecules. Quantum chemical calculations for  n  = 2 reveal that solvation shifts the intense 3s&#8208;3p excitations of Al+  into the investigated photon energy range below 5.5 eV. During the photochemical relaxation, internal conversion from S1  to T2  takes place, and photochemical hydrogen formation starts on the T2  surface, which passes through a conical intersection, changing to T1  . On this triplet surface, the electron that was excited to the Al 3p orbital is transferred to a coordinated water molecule, which dissociates into a hydroxide ion and a hydrogen atom. If the system remains in the triplet state, this hydrogen radical is lost directly. If the system returns to singlet multiplicity, the reaction may be reversed, with recombination with the hydroxide moiety and electron transfer back to aluminum, resulting in water evaporation. Alternatively, the hydrogen radical can attack the intact water molecule, forming molecular hydrogen and aluminum dihydroxide. Photodissociation is observed up to  n  = 8. Clusters with  n  = 9,10 occur exclusively as HAlOH+(H2O)n  &#8211;1  and are transparent in the investigated energy range. For  n  = 4&#8211;8, a mixture of Al+(H2O)n  and HAlOH+(H2O)n  &#8211;1  is present in the experiment.</dc:description>

         <title>Diastereoselective [2+2+1] Hydrative Annulation of Phenol&#8208;Linked 1,6&#8208;Enynes With Acetylenes Through Rhodium Catalysis: A Rapid Access to Cyclopenta[b]benzofuranols**</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An unprecedented [2+2+1] hydrative annulation of 1,6&#8208;enynes with terminal alkynes is achieved using catalytic cationic Rh(I). Thus, a modular assembly of cyclopenta[b]benzofuranols with two consecutive quarternary stereocenters is achieved from readily available alkynes. The reaction is proposed to go through a sequence of 5&#8208;membered rhoda&#8208;cycle formation, regioselective acetylene insertion, 1,5 H&#8208;shift, substrate controlled stereoselective addition of water molecule followed by 1,2&#8208;rhodium migration gave contracted rhoda&#8208;cycle D and reductive elimination. Necessary control/labelling experiments were conducted to gain insight in to the mechanism.</dc:description>

         <title>Reactivity of the Bicyclic Amido&#8208;Substituted Silicon(I) Ring Compound Si4{N(SiMe3)Mes}4 with FLP&#8208;type Character</title>

         <dc:description>The bicyclic amido&#8208;substituted silicon(I) ring compound Si  4  {N(SiMe  3  )Mes}  4  2  (Mes = Mesityl = 2,4,6&#8208;Me  3  C  6  H  2  ) features enhanced zwitterionic character and different reactivity compared to the analogous compound Si  4  {N(SiMe  3  )Dipp}  4  1  (Dipp = 2,6&#8208;  i  Pr  2  C  6  H  3  ) due to the smaller mesityl substituents. In a reaction with the  N  heterocyclic carbene (1,3,4,5&#8208;tetramethyl&#8208;imidazol&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene = NHC  Me4  ) we observe adduct formation to Si  4  {N(SiMe  3  )Mes}  4  &#8729;NHC  Me4  (  3  ). This adduct reacts further with the Lewis acid BH  3  to yield the Lewis acid base complex Si  4  {N(SiMe  3  )Mes}  4  &#8729;NHC  Me4  &#8729;BH  3  (  4  ). Coordination of AlBr  3  to  2  leads to the adduct  5  . Calculated proton affinities and fluoride ion affinities reveal highly Lewis basic and very weak Lewis acidic character of the low&#8208;valent silicon atoms in  1  and  2  . This is confirmed by protonation of  1  and  2  with Brookharts acid yielding  6  and  7  . Reactions with diphenylacetylene only occur at 111 &#176;C with  2  in toluene and are accompanied by a fragmentation of  2  to afford the silacyclopropene  8  and the trisilanorbornadiene species  9  .</dc:description>

         <dc:description>This paper reports the first example of C&#8211;H arylation of benzene under mild conditions, using H  2  as an electron source {turnover numbers (TONs) = 0.7&#8211;2.0 for 24 h}. The reaction depends on a Rh&#8208;based electron storage catalyst, and proceeds at room temperature and in aqueous solution. Furthermore, the H  2  is inactive during the radical transfer step, greatly reducing unwanted side reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Cobalt&#8208;Catalyzed Dehydrogenative C&#8211;H Silylation of Alkynylsilanes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we report that a cobalt catalyst permits the general synthesis of substituted alkynylsilanes via dehydrogenative coupling of alkylnylsilanes and hydrosilanes. Several silylated alkynes were prepared in a one&#8208;step procedure, including di&#8208; and trisubstituted ones. 36 compounds were synthesized for the first time applying our catalyst system. The alkynylsilanes bearing hydrosilyl moieties provide an opportunity for further functionalizations (e.g., hydrosilylation). &#160;The use of primary silanes as substrates and pre&#8208;catalyst activators permits the utilization of inexpensive and easily accessible 3d metal pre&#8208;catalysts and avoids the presence of additional activators.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The electron&#8208;rich Pt complex [Pt(IMes)  2  ] (IMes: [1,3bis(2,4,6&#8208;trimethylphenyl)&#8208;2&#8208;imidazolinylidine]) can be used as precursor for the syntheses of a variety of fluorido ligand containing compounds. The sulfur fluoride SF  4  undergoes a rapid oxidative addition at Pt  0  to yield  trans  &#8208;[Pt(F)(SF  3  )(IMes)  2  ]. A photolytic reaction of SF  6  at [Pt(IMes)  2  ] in the presence of IMes gave the fluorido complexes  trans  &#8208;[Pt(F)  2  (IMes)  2  ] and  trans  &#8208;[Pt(F)(SF  3  )(IMes)  2  ] along with  trans  &#8208;[Pt(F)(SOF)(IMes)  2  ] and  trans  &#8208;[Pt(F)(IMes&#8217;)(IMes)] (IMes&#8217;: cyclometalated IMes ligand), the latter being products produced by reaction with adventitious water.  trans  &#8208;[Pt(F)(SOF)(IMes)  2  ] and  trans  [Pt(F)  2  (IMes)  2  ] were synthesized independently by treatment of [Pt(IMes)  2  ] with SOF  2  or XeF  2  .

         <title>Tunable linear and nonlinear optical properties from room temperature phosphorescent cyclic triimidazole&#8208;pyrene bio&#8208;probe</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic materials with multiple emissions tunable by external stimuli represent a great challenge. TTPyr, crystallizing in different polymorphs, shows a very rich photophyisics comprising excitation&#8208;dependent fluorescence and phosphorescence at ambient conditions, and mechanochromic and thermochromic behavior. Transformation among the different species has been followed by thermal and X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis and the emissive features interpreted through structural results and DFT/TDDFT calculations. Particularly intriguing is the polymorph obtained at high temperature, TTPyr(HT), whose non&#8208;centrosymmetric structure guarantees an SHG efficiency 10 times higher than that of standard urea. Its crystal packing, where only the TT units are strongly rigidified by &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking interactions while the Pyr moieties possess partial conformational freedom, is responsible for the observed dual fluorescence. The potentialities of TTPyr for bioimaging have been successfully established.</dc:description>

         <title>Size&#8208;controlled synthesis of &#946;(1&#8594;4)&#8208;GlcNAc oligosaccharides using an endo&#8208;glycosynthase</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chitin and peptidoglycan fragments are well recognized as pathogen associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). Long&#8208;chain oligosaccharides of &#946;(1&#8594;4)&#8208;linked  N  &#8208;acetyl&#8208;D&#8208;glucosamine (GlcNAc) units indeed activate plants and mammals innate immune system. However, the mechanisms underlying PAMPs perception by lysine motif (LysM) domain receptors remain largely unknown because of insufficient availability of high&#8208;affinity molecular probes. Here, we report a two&#8208;enzyme cascade to synthesize long&#8208;chain &#946;(1&#8594;4)&#8208;linked GlcNAc oligomers. Expression of the D52S mutant of hen egg&#8208;white lysozyme (HEWL) in  Pichia pastoris  at 52 mg.L  &#8208;1  provided a new glycosynthase catalyzing efficient polymerization of &#945;&#8208;chitintriosyl fluoride. Selective  N  &#8208;deacetylation at the non&#8208;reducing unit of the glycosyl fluoride donor by  Sinorhizobium meliloti  NodB chitin&#8208;  N  &#8208;deacetylase abolished its ability to be polymerized by the glycosynthase but not to be transferred onto an acceptor. Using NodB and D52S HEWL in a one&#8208;pot cascade reaction allowed the synthesis of chitin hexa&#8208;, hepta&#8208; and octasaccharides with yields up to 65% and a perfect control over their size.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>
Enantiodivergent one&#8208;pot synthesis of axially chiral biaryls was developed using a catalytic amount of a chiral source. A domino organocatalyst&#8208;mediated enantioselective Michael/aldol condensation and enantiodivergent central&#8208;to&#8208;axial chirality conversion afforded chiral biaryls with excellent enantioselectivity in a single reaction vessel. A plausible reaction mechanism for the enantiodivergence was proposed.







Abstract
Enantiodivergent one&#8208;pot synthesis of biaryls was developed using a catalytic amount of a single chiral source. A domino organocatalyst&#8208;mediated enantioselective Michael reaction and aldol condensation provided centrally chiral dihydronaphthalenes with excellent enantioselectivity, from which an enantiodivergent chirality conversion from central&#8208;to&#8208;axial chirality was achieved. Both enantiomers of biaryls were obtained with excellent enantioselectivity. All transformations can be conducted in a single reaction vessel. A plausible reaction mechanism for the enantiodivergence is proposed.

         <title>Controlled Synthesis of Oligomers Containing Main&#8208;Chain B(sp2)&#8208;B(sp2) Bonds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel alkynyl&#8208;functionalized diarylbis(dimethylamino)diboranes(4) were prepared and reacted with mono&#8208; and dihydroboranes, leading to hydroboration of the alkyne groups. The products are discrete boryl&#8208;appended diborane(4) species and oligomeric species, and are the first known examples of well&#8208;characterized macromolecular species with boron&#8208;boron bonds.

A number of novel alkynyl&#8208;functionalized diarylbis(dimethylamino)diboranes(4) are prepared by salt metathesis, and the appended alkynyl groups are subjected to hydroboration. Their reactions with monohydroboranes lead to discrete boryl&#8208;appended diborane(4) species, while dihydroboranes induce their catenation to oligomeric species, the first known examples of well&#8208;characterized macromolecular species with B&#8722;B bonds. The oligomeric species were found to comprise up to ten repeat units and are soluble in common organic solvents. Some of the oligomeric species have good air stability and all were characterized by NMR and vibrational spectroscopy and size&#8208;exclusion chromatography techniques.

         <title>Recent Advances in the Syntheses and Catalytic Applications of Homonuclear Ru&#8208;, Rh&#8208;, and Ir&#8208;Complexes of CNHC^C Cyclometalated Ligands</title>

         <dc:description>
Cyclometalation is one of the modest ways to access vibrant metallacycles via C&#8722;H activation. The simple modifications in NHC based ligands and synthesis procedure may generate a library of cyclometalated complexes with varying stereoelectronic properties. This Minireview is the collection of recently (2015&#8211;May 2021) reported examples of Ru&#8208;, Rh&#8208;, and Ir&#8208;based CNHC^C cyclometalated complexes (synthesis and reactivity) and their applications in homogeneous catalysis.







Abstract
In the past few decades, chemistry of cyclometalated species has gained momentum with increased applications in several areas of scientific developments. Cyclometalation reactions result in the formation of stable metallacycles through the generation of metal&#8208;carbon covalent bonds by activating the unreactive Csp2&#8208;H or Csp3&#8208;H bonds. The extra stability gained by the formation of metallacycles enhances their applicability scopes especially in the area of homogeneous catalysis. In the recent research development in this area, NHC ligands (strong &#963;&#8208;donor and generally, weak &#960;&#8208;acceptor) have been found to be one of the most suitable candidates for the intramolecular C&#8722;H activation process which leads to the cyclometalated species. The growth in the area of cyclometalation chemistry that started in the late 20th century is still continuing and in the past few decades, various examples of NHC derived transition metal&#8208;based cyclometalated complexes came into the picture. As covering all the reported literatures in this area (includes mainly late transition metals) will exceed the limits of minireview, we restricted ourselves to the recent (2015 &#8211; May 2021) examples of the most common Ru&#8208;, Rh&#8208;, and Ir&#8208;based CNHC^C cyclometalated complexes and their applications in various homogeneous catalytic conversions such as transfer hydrogenation, amidation, oxidation of alcohols, annulations, and so forth.

         <title>Diphosphino&#8208;Functionalized 1,8&#8208;Naphthyridines: a Multifaceted Ligand Platform for Boranes and Diboranes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Five diphosphino&#8208;functionalized 1,8&#8208;naphthyridine (NDP)&#8208;based boron compounds were synthesized via two different methods: direct coordination and salt elimination. In these NDP&#8208;based boron compounds, NDP behaves as a flexible, multifaceted ligand. For example, it functions as a tridentate ligand toward B2Br4 and as a bidentate ligand for BBr3. Furthermore, NDP binds through only one nitrogen to a diaminodiborane to furnish tri&#8208; and tetraamino diboranes.







Abstract
A 1,8&#8208;naphthyridine diphosphine (NDP) reacts with boron&#8208;containing Lewis acids to generate complexes featuring a number of different naphthyridine bonding modes. When exposed to diborane B2Br4, NDP underwent self&#8208;deprotonation to afford [NDP&#8208;B2Br3]Br, an unsymmetrical diborane comprised of four fused rings. The reaction of two equivalents of monoborane BBr3 and NDP in a non&#8208;polar solvent provided the simple phosphine&#8208;borane adduct [NDP(BBr3)2], which then underwent intramolecular halide abstraction to furnish the salt [NDP&#8208;BBr2][BBr4], featuring a different coordination mode from that of [NDP&#8208;B2Br3]Br. Direct deprotonation of NDP by KHMDS or PhCH2K generates mono&#8208; and dipotassium reagents, respectively. The monopotassium reagent reacts with one or half an equivalent of B2(NMe2)2Cl2 to afford NDP&#8208;based diboranes with three or four amino substituents.

         <title>Highly Efficient Simulated Solar Light&#8208;Driven Photocatalytic Degradation of 4&#8208;Nitrophenol over CdS/Carbon/MoSx Hybrids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel photocatalytic system is readily synthesized through a microwave&#8208;assisted hydrothermal process. The CdS/MoSx heterojunction using ascorbic acid&#8208;derived carbon as cocatalyst degrades 4&#8208;nitrophenol about 9 times faster than neat CdS. The enhancement of photocatalytic activity towards the degradation of an organic pollutant originates from efficient charge separation in the formed heterojunctions.







Abstract
Among the various organic pollutants and industrial chemicals, 4&#8208;nitrophenol has been one of the most monitored substances in aqueous environments, due to its enhanced solubility in such systems. This research reports for the first time the microwave&#8208;assisted synthesis of CdS/carbon/MoSx hybrids and the subsequent utilization of such systems as photocatalysts for 4&#8208;nitrophenol degradation. The hybrids demonstrated a variable photocatalytic activity, by using a variety of organic substances as precursors for the solvothermal carbonization step. By using ascorbic acid as precursor, the corresponding ternary composite exhibited excellent photocatalytic activity, with the 4&#8208;nitrophenol concentration been almost quantitatively decayed within 45&#8197;min of irradiation. This could be ascribed due to the generation of a high population of heterojunctions as well as the chemical speciation of Mo&#8208;based nanostructures. Such ternary hybrids may be utilized as potential photocatalytic systems in processes, where removal of toxic water&#8208;soluble substances is the key issue.

Glipizide and glibenclamide remain some of the widely prescribed antidiabetic sulfonylurea drugs for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Semi&#8208;telescoped continuous flow synthesis of both glipizide and glibenclamide are demonstrated herein which is accompanied by an overall yield of 80&#8211;85&#8201;% within 10&#8197;min total residence time.







Abstract
Glipizide and glibenclamide remain some of the widely prescribed antidiabetic sulfonylurea drugs for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Herein the authors report on an isocyanate&#8208;free synthetic procedure towards the preparation of these on demand drugs at multigram scale using continuous flow technology. The safety concern over the use of isocyanates in most of the existing synthetic routes was dealt with in this present work by using N&#8208;carbamates synthesised in&#8197;situ from activation of amines with chloroformates as safer alternatives. An overall yield of 80&#8211;85&#8201;% was obtained for the semi&#8208;telescoped steps within 10&#8197;min total residence time.

         <title>Donor&#8208;Stabilised [SbF4]+: SbF5 as a Fluoride&#8208;Ion Donor</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ability of the strong Lewis acid SbF5 to act as a fluoride&#8208;ion donor has been demonstrated for the first time through the synthesis of donor&#8208;stabilised [SbF4]+ cations. In the presence of bidentate N&#8208;donor ligands, SbF5 undergoes ligand&#8208;induced autoionisation to yield robust [SbF4(L&#8722;L)]+ (L&#8722;L=2,2&#8217;bipyridine or 1,10&#8208;phenanthroline) salts. DFT calculations and NBO analyses show strong Sb&#8722;N interactions that are necessary to stabilise the [SbF4]+ cation.







Abstract
Antimony pentafluoride is a strong Lewis acid and fluoride&#8208;ion acceptor that has not previously demonstrated any discreet fluoride&#8208;ion donor properties. The first donor&#8208;stabilised [SbF4]+ cations were prepared from the autoionisation of SbF5 in the presence of bidentate N&#8208;donor ligands 2,2&#8217;&#8208;bipyridine (bipy) and 1,10&#8208;phenanthroline (phen) as their [SbF6]&#8722; salts. The [SbF4(N&#8722;N)][Sb2F11] (N&#8722;N=bipy, phen) salts were synthesised by the addition of one equivalent of SbF5&#8901;SO2 to [SbF4(N&#8722;N)][SbF6] in liquid SO2. The salts show remarkable stability and were characterised by Raman spectroscopy and multinuclear NMR spectroscopy. The crystal structures of [SbF4(phen)][SbF6]&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;3CH3CN and [SbF4(phen)][SbF6]&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2SO2 were determined, showing distorted octahedral cations. DFT calculations and NBO analyses reveal that significant degree of electron&#8208;pair donation from N to Sb stabilizes [SbF4]+ with the Sb&#8722;N bond strength being approximately two thirds of that of the Sb&#8722;F bonds in these cations and the cationic charge being primarily ligand&#8208;centred.

         <title>Advancing inorganic coordination chemistry by spectroscopy of isolated molecules: methods and applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A unique feature of the work carried out in the Collaborative Research Center 3MET continues to be its emphasis on innovative, advanced experimental methods which hyphenate mass&#8208;selection with further analytical tools such as laser spectroscopy for the study of  isolated  molecular ions. This allows to probe the intrinsic properties of the species of interest free of perturbing solvent or matrix effects. This review explains these methods and uses examples from past and ongoing 3MET studies of specific classes of multicenter metal complexes to illustrate how coordination chemistry can be advanced by applying them. As a corollary, we will show how the challenges involved in providing well&#8208;defined, e.g. monoisomeric, samples of the molecular ions have helped to further improve the methods themselves thus also making them applicable to many other areas of chemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>THF&#8208;solvated Heavy Alkali Metal Benzyl Compounds (Na, Rb, Cs): Defined Deprotonation Reagents for Alkali Metal Mediation Chemistry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The incorporation of heavy alkali metals into substrates is both challenging and essential for many reactions. Here, we report the formation of thf&#8208;solvated alkali metal benzyl compounds [PhCH  2  M(thf)  n  ] ( M = Na, Rb, Cs). The synthesis was carried out by deprotonation of toluene with the bimetallic mixture n&#8208;butyllithium/alkali metal&#160;tert&#8208;butoxide&#160;and selective crystallization from thf of the defined benzyl compounds. Insights into the molecular structure in the solid as well as in solution state are gained by single crystal X&#8208;ray experiments and NMR spectroscopic studies. The compounds could be successfully used as alkali metal mediating reagents. The example of caesium showed the convenient use by deprotonating acidic C&#8211;H as well as N&#8211;H compounds to gain insight into the aminometalation using these reagents.</dc:description>

         <title>The Effect of Water on the 2&#8208;Propanol Oxidation Activity of Co&#8208;Substituted LaFe1&#8208;xCoxO3 Perovskites</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Perovskites are interesting oxidation catalysts due to their chemical flexibility enabling the tuning of several properties. In this work, we synthesized LaFe  1&#8208;x  Co  x  O  3  catalysts by co&#8208;precipitation and thermal decomposition, characterized them thoroughly and studied their 2&#8208;propanol oxidation activity under dry and wet conditions to bridge the knowledge gap between gas and liquid phase reactions. Transient tests showed a highly active, unstable low&#8208;temperature (LT) reaction channel in conversion profiles and a stable, less&#8208;active high&#8208;temperature (HT) channel. Cobalt incorporation had a positive effect on the activity. The effect of water was negative on the LT channel, whereas the HT channel activity was boosted for x&gt;0.15. The boost maybe originated from a slower deactivation rate of the Co  3+  sites under wet conditions and a higher amount of hydroxide species on the surface comparing wet and dry feeds. Water addition resulted in a slower deactivation for Co&#8208;rich catalysts and higher activity in the HT channel state.</dc:description>

         <title>Position Matters: Fluorescent Positional Isomers for Reversible Multichannel Encryption Devices</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fluorescence signals have been widely used in information encryption for a few decades, but still suffer from limited reliability. Here, reversible multichannel fluorescent devices with encrypted information were constructed, based on two fluorescent positional isomers of a diphenylquinoxaline derivative. Possessing the same core fluorescent group and acid&#8208;/pH&#8208;responsive mechanism, the two isomers showed different fluorescence color in an acidic environment, which allowed us to realize stepwise encryption of information in orthogonal fluorescence channels. Since the protonation was reversible, the revealed information could be re&#8208;encrypted, simply by heating. This approach highlights the value of positional isomers to build multichannel encryption devices, improving their reliability on the molecular level.</dc:description>

         <title>Fast and efficient postsynthetic DNA labeling in cells by means of strain&#8208;promoted sydnone&#8208;alkyne cycloadditions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sydnones are highly stable mesoionic 1,3&#8208;dipoles that react with cyclooctynes via strain&#8208;promoted sydnone&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition (SPSAC). While they have been shown to be valuable bioorthogonal chemical reporters for the labeling of proteins and complex glycans, nucleic acids, however, have not yet been tagged via SPSAC. Evaluation of the SPSAC kinetics with model substrates showed fast reactions with cyclooctyne probes (up to k=0.191 M&#8722;1 s&#8722;1) and two different sydnones were effectively incorporated into both 2&#8217;&#8208;deoxyuridines at position 5, and 7&#8208;deaza&#8208;2&#8217;&#8208;deoxyadenosines at position 7. These modified nucleosides were synthetically incorporated into single&#8208;stranded DNA, which were successfully postsynthetically labeled with cyclooctyne probes both in vitro and in cells.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Sydnones are highly stable mesoionic 1,3-dipoles that react with cyclooctynes via strain-promoted sydnone-alkyne cycloaddition (SPSAC). While they have been shown to be valuable bioorthogonal chemical reporters for the labeling of proteins and complex glycans, nucleic acids, however, have not yet been tagged via SPSAC. Evaluation of the SPSAC kinetics with model substrates showed fast reactions with cyclooctyne probes (up to k=0.191 M&#8722;1 s&#8722;1) and two different sydnones were effectively incorporated into both 2&#8217;-deoxyuridines at position 5, and 7-deaza-2&#8217;-deoxyadenosines at position 7. These modified nucleosides were synthetically incorporated into single-stranded DNA, which were successfully postsynthetically labeled with cyclooctyne probes both in vitro and in cells. These results show that sydnones are versatile bioorthogonal tags and have the premise to become essential tools for tracking DNA and potentially RNA in living cells.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Light&#8208; and pH&#8208;regulated Water&#8208;soluble Pseudorotaxanes Comprising a Cucurbit[7]uril and a Flavylium&#8208;based Axle</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A linear double pyridinium&#8208;terminated thread comprising a central chalcone moiety is shown to provide two independent binding sites with similar affinity for cucurbit[7]uril (CB7) macrocycles in water as judged from NMR, UV&#8208;Visible and fluorescence spectroscopies. Association results in [2] and [3]pseudorotaxanes, which are both pH and photosensitive. Switching from the neutral chalcone to the cationic flavylium form upon irradiation at 365 nm under acidic conditions provided an enhanced CB7 association (  K  1:1  &#160;increases from&#160;1.2&#160;x&#160;10  5  &#160;M  &#8722;1  &#160;to 1.5&#160;x&#160;10  8  &#160;M  &#8722;1  ), limiting spontaneous on&#8208;thread cucurbituril shuttling. This co&#8208;conformational change in the [2]pseudorotaxane is reversible in the dark with&#160;  k  obs  &#160;= 4.1&#160;x&#160;10  &#8208;4  &#160;s  &#8208;1  . Threading the flavylium moiety into CB7 leads to a 3&#8208;fold increase in the fluorescence quantum yield, from 0.29 in the free axle to 0.97 in the [2]pseudorotaxane and 1.0 in the [3]pseudorotaxane.</dc:description>

         <title>Controllable Macroscopic Chirality of Coordination Polymers through pH and Anion&#8208;Mediated Weak Interactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Helical architectures with controllable helical sense bias have recently attracted considerable interest for mimicking biological helices and developing novel chiral materials. Coordination polymers (CPs), composed of metal ion nodes and organic linkers, are intriguing systems showing tunable structures and functions. However, CPs with helical morphologies have rarely been explored so far. Particularly, chirality inversion through external stimulus has not been achieved in helical CPs. In this work, we carried out an in&#8208;depth investigation on the self&#8208;assembly of 1D gadolinium(III) phosphonate CPs using GdX  3  (X = Cl, Br, I) and Gd(RSO  3  ) (R = CH  3  , C  6  H  5  , CF  3  ) as metal sources and  R  &#8208;(1&#8208;phenylethylamino)methyl phosphonic acid (  R  &#8208;pempH  2  ) as ligand. Superhelices were formed by precise control of the interchain interactions through different intercalated anions. Furthermore, the twisting direction of superhelices could be controlled by the synergistic effect of anions and pH. This study may provide a new route to fabricate helical nanostructures of CPs with a desirable chiral sense and help understand the inner mechanism of the self&#8208;assembly process of macroscopic helical structures of molecular systems.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Native electrospray ionization (ESI) and nanoelectrospray ionization (nESI) allow researchers to analyze intact biomolecules and their complexes by mass spectrometry (MS). The data acquired using these soft ionization techniques provide a snapshot of a given biomolecules structure in solution. Over the last thirty years, several nESI and ESI sources capable of controlling spray solution temperature have been developed. These sources can be used to elucidate the thermodynamics of a given analyte, as well as provide structural information that cannot be readily obtained by other, more commonly used techniques. This review highlights how the field of temperature&#8208;controlled mass spectrometry has developed.</dc:description>

         <title>On the hydrogen oxalate binding motifs onto dinuclear coinage metal phosphine complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report the binding geometries of the isomers that are formed when the hydrogen oxalate ((CO  2  )  2  H = HOx) anion attaches to dinuclear coinage metal phosphine complexes of the form M  1  M  2  dcpm  2  (HOx) with M=Cu, Ag and dcpm = bis(dicyclohexylphosphino)methane, abbreviated [MM]  +  . These structures are established by comparison of isomer&#8208;selective experimental vibrational band patterns displayed by the cryogenically cooled and N  2  &#8208;tagged cations with DFT calculations of the predicted spectra for various local minima. Two isomeric classes are identified that feature either attachment of the carboxylate oxygen atoms to the two metal centers (end&#8208;on docking) or attachment of oxygen atoms on different carbon atoms asymmetrically to the metal ions (side&#8208;on docking). Within each class, there are additional isomeric variations according to the orientation of the OH group. This behavior indicates that HOx undergoes strong and directional coordination to [CuCu]  +  but adopts a more flexible coordination to [AgAg]  +  . Infrared spectra of the bare ions, fragmentation thresholds and ion mobility measurements are reported to explore the behaviors of the complexes at ambient temperature.</dc:description>

         <title>Indandione&#8208;terminated quinoidal compounds for low&#8208;bandgap small molecules with strong near&#8208;infrared absorption: effect of conjugation length on the properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Low&#8208;bandgap organic semiconductors have attracted much attention for their multiple applications in optoelectronics. However, the realization of narrow bandgap is challenging particularly for small molecules. Herein, we have synthesized four quinoidal compounds, i.e.,  QSN3  ,  QSN4  ,  QSN5  and  QSN6  , with electron rich S,N&#8208;heteroacene as the quinoidal core and indandione as the end&#8208;groups. The optical bandgap of the quinoidal compounds is systematically decreased with the extension of quinoidal skeleton, while maintaining stable closed&#8208;shell ground state.  QSN6  absorbs an intense absorption in the first and second near&#8208;infrared region in the solid state, and has extremely low optical bandgap of 0.74 eV. Cyclic voltammetry analyses reveal that the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels of the four quinoidal compounds all lie below &#8722;4.1 eV, resulting in good electron&#8208;transporting characteristics in organic thin&#8208;film transistors. These results demonstrated that the combination of &#960;&#8208;extended quinoidal core and end&#8208;groups in quinoidal compounds is an effective strategy for the synthesis of low&#8208;bandgap small molecules with good stability.</dc:description>

         <title>Metal Free Access to Polysubstituted Pyrimidines via Nitrile Activation and [2+2+2] Cycloaddition</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Tf  2  O mediated intermolecular / intramolecular [2+2+2] cycloaddition between alkynes and nitriles has been developed for efficient construction of polysubstituted pyrimidine and bicyclopyrimidines. In presence of Tf  2  O, aza&#8208;allene species in situ generated through nitrile activation and subsequently participated in the [2+2+2] cycloaddition, which was fully supported by deuteration experiments.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Tf  2  O mediated intermolecular / intramolecular [2+2+2] cycloaddition between alkynes and nitriles has been developed for efficient construction of polysubstituted pyrimidine and bicyclopyrimidines. In presence of Tf  2  O, aza-allene species in situ generated through nitrile activation and subsequently participated in the [2+2+2] cycloaddition, which was fully supported by deuteration experiments. The reaction had good substrate extensibility with moderate to excellent yield including trimethylsilylalkynes. The utilization as a useful synthetic tool in preparation of the luminescent metal complex was also demonstrated.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>NMR crystallography reveals carbonate induced Al&#8208;ordering in ZnAl layered double hydroxide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Layered double hydroxides (LDHs) serve a score of applications in catalysis, drug delivery, and environmental remediation. Smarter crystallography, combining X&#8208;ray diffraction and NMR spectroscopy revealed how interplay between carbonate and pH determines the LDH structure and Al ordering in ZnAl LDH. Carbonate intercalated ZnAl LDHs were synthesized at different pH (pH 8.5, pH 10.0, pH 12.5) with a Zn/Al ratio of 2, without subsequent hydrothermal treatment to avoid extensive recrystallisation. In ideal configuration, all Al cations should be part of the LDH and be coordinated with 6 Zn atoms, but NMR revealed two different Al local environments were present in all samples in a ratio dependent on synthesis pH. NMR&#8208;crystallography, integrating NMR spectroscopy and X&#8208;ray diffraction, succeeded to identify them as Al residing in the highly ordered crystalline phase, next to Al in disordered material. With increasing synthesis pH, crystallinity increased and the side&#8208;phase fraction decreased. Using  1  H&#8208;  13  C,&#160;  13  C&#8208;  27  Al HETCOR NMR in combination with  27  Al MQMAS,  27  Al&#8208;DQ&#8208;SQ measurements and Rietveld refinement on high&#8208;resolution PXRD data, the extreme anion exchange selectivity of these LDHs for CO  3  2&#8208;  over HCO  3  &#8208;  was linked to strict Al and CO  3  2&#8208;  ordering in the crystalline LDH. Even upon equilibration of the LDH in pure NaHCO  3  solutions, only CO  3  2&#8208;  was adsorbed by the LDH. This reveals the structure directing role of bivalent cations such as CO  3  2&#8208;  during crystallization of [M  2+4  M3+2  (OH)2  ]2+  [A  2&#8211;  ]  1  &#8729;yH  2  O LDH phases.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>DNA three&#8208;way junction (3WJ) structures are essential building blocks for the construction of DNA nanoarchitectures. We have synthesized a bipyridine (bpy)&#8208;modified DNA 3WJ using a newly designed bpy&#8208;modified nucleoside,  U  bpy  &#8208;3  , in which a bpy ligand is tethered via a stable amide&#8208;linker. The thermal stability of the bpy&#8208;modified 3WJ was greatly enhanced by the formation of an interstrand Ni  II  (bpy)  3  complex at the junction core (&#916;  T  m  = +17.7 &#176;C). Although the stereochemistry of the modification site differs from that of the previously reported bpy&#8208;modified nucleoside  U  bpy  &#8208;2  , the degree of the Ni  II  &#8208;mediated stabilization observed with  U  bpy  &#8208;3  was comparable to that of  U  bpy  &#8208;2  . The structure induction of the 3WJs and the duplexes was carried out by the addition or removal of Ni  II  ions. Furthermore, Ni  II  &#8208;mediated self&#8208;sorting of 3WJs was performed using the bpy&#8208;modified strands and their unmodified counterparts. Both transformations were driven by the formation of Ni  II  (bpy)  3  complex. The structural induction and self&#8208;sorting of bpy&#8208;modified 3WJs are expected to have many potential applications in the development of metal&#8208;responsive DNA materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Molecular Recognition of Natural and Non&#8208;Natural Substrates by Cellodextrin Phosphorylase from Ruminiclostridium Thermocellum Investigated by NMR Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Understanding the molecular basis of the broad specificity of cellodextrin phosphorylase (CDP) from Ruminiclostridium thermocellum, can facilitate the generation of highly diverse CDP&#8208;catalysed cellulose&#8208;based structures. Here, NMR spectroscopy and molecular modelling allowed to understand how CDP is able to bind non&#8208;natural chemically modified donors and acceptors with different binding epitopes, revealing the structural requirements for CDP ligands, which will enable exploitation of CDP to produce novel materials of high biotechnological interest.







Abstract
&#946;&#8208;1&#8594;4&#8208;Glucan polysaccharides like cellulose, derivatives and analogues, are attracting attention due to their unique physicochemical properties, as ideal candidates for many different applications in biotechnology. Access to these polysaccharides with a high level of purity at scale is still challenging, and eco&#8208;friendly alternatives by using enzymes in&#8197;vitro are highly desirable. One prominent candidate enzyme is cellodextrin phosphorylase (CDP) from Ruminiclostridium thermocellum, which is able to yield cellulose oligomers from short cellodextrins and &#945;&#8208;d&#8208;glucose 1&#8208;phosphate (Glc&#8208;1&#8208;P) as substrates. Remarkably, its broad specificity towards donors and acceptors allows the generation of highly diverse cellulose&#8208;based structures to produce novel materials. However, to fully exploit this CDP broad specificity, a detailed understanding of the molecular recognition of substrates by this enzyme in solution is needed. Herein, we provide a detailed investigation of the molecular recognition of ligands by CDP in solution by saturation transfer difference (STD) NMR spectroscopy, tr&#8208;NOESY and protein&#8208;ligand docking. Our results, discussed in the context of previous reaction kinetics data in the literature, allow a better understanding of the structural basis of the broad binding specificity of this biotechnologically relevant enzyme.

         <title>Asymmetric Synthesis of Indoline from Achiral Phthalimide Involving Crystallization&#8208;Induced Deracemization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Asymmetric synthesis was performed by combining a photochemical reaction of an achiral substrate followed by crystallization&#8208;induced deracemization. A fused indoline produced by the photochemical intramolecular &#948;&#8208;hydrogen abstraction and cyclization reaction of N&#8208;(5&#8208;chloro&#8208;2&#8208;methylphenyl)phthalimide crystallized as a racemic conglomerate, and crystallization&#8208;induced deracemization by Viedma ripening was performed with an excellent enantioselectivity of 99&#8201;% ee. This is the first example of asymmetric expression and amplification by a photochemical hydrogen abstraction reaction and crystallization&#8208;induced deracemization.







Abstract
Asymmetric synthesis was performed by combining the photochemical reaction of an achiral substrate followed by crystallization&#8208;induced deracemization. The results indicated that a fused indoline produced by photochemical intramolecular &#948;&#8208;hydrogen abstraction and cyclization of N&#8208;(5&#8208;chloro&#8208;2&#8208;methylphenyl)phthalimide crystallized as a racemic conglomerate. Since this substrate has an aminal skeleton, racemization involving a ring&#8208;opening and ring&#8208;closing equilibrium process occurred under suitable conditions. Efficient racemization was observed in acetone containing a catalytic base, 1,8&#8208;diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec&#8208;7&#8208;ene (DBU). Crystallization&#8208;induced dynamic deracemization by Viedma ripening from racemic indoline was performed with an excellent enantioselectivity of 99&#8201;% ee. Furthermore, one&#8208;pot asymmetric synthesis of the indoline was achieved by the photochemical reaction of achiral phthalimide followed by continuous attrition&#8208;enhanced deracemization converging to 99&#8201;% ee of enantiomeric crystals. This is the first example of asymmetric expression and amplification by photochemical hydrogen abstraction and crystallization&#8208;induced dynamic deracemization.

A chemoselectivity switchable microflow reaction was developed to generate reactive and unstable intermediates. The switchable chemoselectivity of this reaction enables a selection for one of two different intermediates, an aryllithium or a benzyl lithium, at will from the same starting material. Starting from bromo&#8208;substituted styrenes, the aryllithium intermediates were converted to the substituted styrenes, whereas the benzyl lithium intermediates were engaged in an anionic polymerization. These chemoselectivity&#8208;switchable reactions can be integrated to produce polymers that cannot be formed during typical polymerization reactions.

         <title>Polycationic Redox&#8208;Active Cyclophanes with Integrated Electron&#8208;Rich Diboron Units</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cyclophanes and macrocyclic cages are of interest for a variety of applications. In this work, it is shown that the integration of electron rich diboron units into polycationic cyclophanes and macrocyclic cages with bi&#8208; and trispyridine electron&#8208;acceptor units leads to novel donor&#8208;acceptor compounds with intriguing optical and redox properties.







Abstract
Cationic cyclophanes are widely used in a variety of applications in supramolecular chemistry and materials science. In this work the authors systematically study the integration of electron&#8208;rich diboron units with BII atoms into polycationic cyclophanes with viologen&#8208;like electron&#8208;acceptor units. They also report a first hexacationic cage&#8208;compound in which three diboron units connect two tris(4&#8208;pyridyl)triazine acceptor units. Moreover, di&#8208; and tetracationic open&#8208;structure compounds, in which one diboron unit connects two bispyridyl groups, were synthesized and the properties compared to those of the corresponding closed structures (cyclophanes). The combination of diboron electron&#8208;donor units and bi&#8208; or oligopyridyl electron&#8208;acceptor units leads to intriguing optical and redox properties.

         <title>GPhos Ligand Enables Production of Chiral N&#8208;Arylamines in a Telescoped Transaminase&#8208;Buchwald&#8208;Hartwig Amination Cascade in the Presence of Excess Amine Donor</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chiral N&#8208;arylamines were accessed by combining transaminases with the Buchwald&#8208;Hartwig amination (BHA), combining the high enantioselectivity of the former with the efficient arylation ability of palladium. The ligand GPhos was key for the successful arylation of &#945;&#8208;secondary amines in a biphasic water&#8208;toluene system in the presence of excess alanine, achieving overall conversions of up to 89&#8201;% with &gt;99.5&#8201;% ee. No coupling to alanine was observed.







Abstract
The combination of biocatalysis and chemocatalysis can be more powerful than either technique alone. However, combining the two is challenging due to typically very different reaction conditions. Herein, chiral N&#8208;aryl amines, key features of many active pharmaceutical ingredients, are accessed in excellent enantioselectivity (typically&gt;99.5&#8201;% ee) by combining transaminases with the Buchwald&#8208;Hartwig amination. By employing a bi&#8208;phasic buffer&#8208;toluene system as well as the ligand GPhos, the telescoped cascade proceeded with up to 89&#8201;% overall conversion in the presence of excess alanine. No coupling to alanine was observed.

         <title>Computational Study of Bridge Splitting, Aryl Halide Oxidative Addition to PtII, and Reductive Elimination from PtIV: Route to Pincer&#8208;PtII Reagents with Chemical and Biological Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The precise path to pincers: Density functional theory studies of the bridge splitting of [PtIIR2(SEt2)]2 (R=Me, 4&#8208;tolyl) by bromoarenes containing nitrogen donor groups, and subsequent intramolecular coordination&#8208;assisted oxidative addition, elucidate for R=4&#8208;tolyl the mechanism for formation of mer&#8208;PtII(N,C,N)Br pincers via platinum(IV) intermediates. The pincers are known for their applications in fundamental and applied chemistry.







Abstract
Density functional theory computation indicates that bridge splitting of [PtIIR2(&#956;&#8208;SEt2)]2 proceeds by partial dissociation to form R2Pta(&#956;&#8208;SEt2)PtbR2(SEt2), followed by coordination of N&#8208;donor bromoarenes (L&#8208;Br) at Pta leading to release of PtbR2(SEt2), which reacts with a second molecule of L&#8208;Br, providing two molecules of PtR2(SEt2)(L&#8208;Br&#8208;N). For R=4&#8208;tolyl (Tol), L&#8208;Br=2,6&#8208;(pzCH2)2C6H3Br (pz=pyrazol&#8208;1&#8208;yl) and 2,6&#8208;(Me2NCH2)2C6H3Br, subsequent oxidative addition assisted by intramolecular N&#8208;donor coordination via PtIITol2(L&#8208;N,Br) and reductive elimination from PtIV intermediates gives mer&#8208;PtII(L&#8208;N,C,N)Br and Tol2. The strong &#963;&#8208;donor influence of Tol groups results in subtle differences in oxidative addition mechanisms when compared with related aryl halide oxidative addition to palladium(II) centres. For R=Me and L&#8208;Br=2,6&#8208;(pzCH2)2C6H3Br, a stable PtIV product, fac&#8208;PtIVMe2{2,6&#8208;(pzCH2)2C6H3&#8208;N,C,N)Br is predicted, as reported experimentally, acting as a model for undetected and unstable PtIVTol2{L&#8208;N,C,N}Br undergoing facile Tol2 reductive elimination. The mechanisms reported herein enable the synthesis of PtII pincer reagents with applications in materials and bio&#8208;organometallic chemistry.

         <title>Remote Radical Desaturation of Unactivated C&#8722;H Bonds in Amides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A copper&#8208;catalyzed/silver&#8208;promoted desaturation method is described which allows the regioselective conversion of various unactivated N&#8208;alkylamides at remote sites to the corresponding N&#8208;alkenylamides via N&#8208;centred radical mediated 1,5 hydrogen atom transfer, metal&#8208;mediated oxidation and deprotonation. The transformation shows good functional group tolerance and can be used for late&#8208;stage desaturation of drug derivatives and biologically more relevant compounds.







Abstract
Desaturation of inert aliphatic C&#8722;H bonds in alkanes to form the corresponding alkenes is challenging. In this communication, a new and practical strategy for remote site&#8208;selective desaturation of amides via radical chemistry is reported. The readily installed N&#8208;allylsulfonylamide moiety serves as an N radical precursor. Intramolecular 1,5&#8208;hydrogen atom transfer from an inert C&#8722;H bond to the N&#8208;radical generates a translocated C&#8208;radical which is subsequently oxidized and deprotonated to give the corresponding alkene. The commercially available methanesulfonyl chloride is used as reagent and a Cu/Ag&#8208;couple as oxidant. The remote desaturation is realized on different types of unactivated sp3&#8208;C&#8722;H bonds. The potential synthetic utility of this method is further demonstrated by the dehydrogenation of natural product derivatives and drugs.

&lt;p&gt;Desaturation of inert aliphatic C&#8722;H bonds in alkanes to form the corresponding alkenes is challenging. In this communication, a new and practical strategy for remote site-selective desaturation of amides via radical chemistry is reported. The readily installed N-allylsulfonylamide moiety serves as an N radical precursor. Intramolecular 1,5-hydrogen atom transfer from an inert C&#8722;H bond to the N-radical generates a translocated C-radical which is subsequently oxidized and deprotonated to give the corresponding alkene. The commercially available methanesulfonyl chloride is used as reagent and a Cu/Ag-couple as oxidant. The remote desaturation is realized on different types of unactivated sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;-C&#8722;H bonds. The potential synthetic utility of this method is further demonstrated by the dehydrogenation of natural product derivatives and drugs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Cross&#8208;Coupling through Ag(I)/Ag(III) Redox Manifold</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Teaching silver to do the trick. Most crucial steps towards oxidative trifluoromethylation via AgI/AgIII redox shuttles are herein deciphered. This innovative cross&#8208;coupling, analogous to the CEL coupling popularized by copper, involves: i) easy AgI/AgIII 2e&#8722; oxidation; ii) phen ligation to AgIII; iii) boron&#8208;to&#8208;AgIII aryl transfer; and iv) benzotrifluoride production from aryl&#8208;AgIII intermediates. Now, AgIIICF3 chemistry is safe and reachable from AgF, KF, CF3TMS and air.







Abstract
In ample variety of transformations, the presence of silver as an additive or co&#8208;catalyst is believed to be innocuous for the efficiency of the operating metal catalyst. Even though Ag additives are required often as coupling partners, oxidants or halide scavengers, its role as a catalytically competent species is widely neglected in cross&#8208;coupling reactions. Most likely, this is due to the erroneously assumed incapacity of Ag to undergo 2e&#8722; redox steps. Definite proof is herein provided for the required elementary steps to accomplish the oxidative trifluoromethylation of arenes through AgI/AgIII redox catalysis (i.&#8201;e. CEL coupling), namely: i) easy AgI/AgIII 2e&#8722; oxidation mediated by air; ii) bpy/phen ligation to AgIII; iii) boron&#8208;to&#8208;AgIII aryl transfer; and iv) ulterior reductive elimination of benzotrifluorides from an [aryl&#8208;AgIII&#8208;CF3] fragment. More precisely, an ultimate entry and full characterization of organosilver(III) compounds [K]+[AgIII(CF3)4]&#8722; (K&#8208;1), [(bpy)AgIII(CF3)3] (2) and [(phen)AgIII(CF3)3] (3), is described. The utility of 3 in cross&#8208;coupling has been showcased unambiguously, and a large variety of arylboron compounds was trifluoromethylated via [AgIII(aryl)(CF3)3]&#8722; intermediates. This work breaks with old stereotypes and misconceptions regarding the inability of Ag to undergo cross&#8208;coupling by itself.

         <title>Regulating Lithium Plating and Stripping by Using Vertically Aligned Graphene/CNT Channels Decorated with ZnO Particles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Li host material that features vertically aligned channels composed of graphene, carbon nanotubes (CNTs), and decorated ZnO particles (designated ZnO@G&#8208;CNT&#8208;C) has been prepared by using an ice&#8208;template method through oriented freezing. The Li host material not only suppresses the formation of Li dendrites but also reduces the overpotential of Li nucleation. The usability of ZnO@G&#8208;CNT&#8208;C as Li host was confirmed in full cells with a LiFePO4 cathode.







Abstract
Lithium (Li) metal is regarded as the ultimate anode material for use in Li batteries due to its high theoretical capacity (3860&#8197;mA&#8201;h&#8201;g&#8722;1). However, the Li dendrites that are generated during iterative Li plating/stripping cycles cause poor cycling stability and even present safety risks, and thus severely handicap the commercial utility of Li metal anodes. Herein, we describe a graphene and carbon nanotube (CNT)&#8208;based Li host material that features vertically aligned channels with attached ZnO particles (designated ZnO@G&#8208;CNT&#8208;C) and show that the material effectively regulates Li plating and stripping. ZnO@G&#8208;CNT&#8208;C is prepared from an aqueous suspension of Zn(OAc)2, CNTs, and graphene oxide by using ice to template channel growth. ZnO@G&#8208;CNT&#8208;C was found to be mechanically robust and capable of guiding Li deposition on the inner walls of the channels without the formation of Li dendrites. When used as an electrode, the material exhibits relatively low polarization for Li plating, fast Li&#8208;ion diffusion, and high Coulombic efficiency, even over hundreds of Li plating/stripping cycles. Moreover, full cells prepared with ZnO@G&#8208;CNT&#8208;C as Li host and LiFePO4 as cathode exhibit outstanding performance in terms of specific capacity (155.9&#8197;mA&#8201;h&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.5&#8197;C), rate performance (91.8&#8197;mA&#8201;h&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 4&#8197;C), cycling stability (109.4&#8197;mA&#8201;h&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.5&#8197;C after 800 cycles). The methodology described can be readily adapted to enable the use of carbon&#8208;based electrodes with well&#8208;defined channels in a wide range of contemporary applications that pertain to energy storage and delivery.

Stop gap: Donor&#8208;acceptor&#8208;donor organic semiconductors consisting of a highly electron&#8208;deficient naphtho[1,2&#8208;b:5,6&#8208;b&#8242;]dithiophene&#8208;2,7&#8208;dione quinoidal acceptor and oligothiophene donors show very small optical energy gaps of down to 0.72&#8197;eV in the solid state, due to an efficient intramolecular interaction between the quinoidal acceptor and the aromatic donors that significantly enhances the backbone resonance and reduces the bond length alternation.







Abstract
Organic semiconductors with very small optical energy gaps have attracted a lot of attention for near&#8208;infrared&#8208;active optoelectronic applications. Herein, we present a series of donor&#8208;acceptor&#8208;donor (D&#8722;A&#8722;D) organic semiconductors consisting of a highly electron&#8208;deficient naphtho[1,2&#8208;b:5,6&#8208;b&#8242;]dithiophene&#8208;2,7&#8208;dione quinoidal acceptor and oligothiophene donors that show very small optical energy gaps of down to 0.72&#8197;eV in the solid state. Investigation of the physicochemical properties of the D&#8722;A&#8722;D molecules as well as theoretical calculations of their electronic structures revealed an efficient intramolecular interaction between the quinoidal acceptor and the aromatic oligothiophene donors in the D&#8722;A&#8722;D molecules; this significantly enhances the backbone resonance and thus reduces the bond length alternation along the &#960;&#8208;conjugated backbones. Despite the very small optical energy gaps, the D&#8722;A&#8722;D molecules have low&#8208;lying frontier orbital energy levels that give rise to air&#8208;stable ambipolar carrier transport properties with hole and electron mobilities of up to 0.026 and 0.043&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1, respectively, in field&#8208;effect transistors.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Intramolecular Scholl reaction of carbazole derivatives afforded highly strained azahelicenes and azahepta[8]circulene, which was transformed into dibenzodiaza[8]circulenes. The diaza[8]circulene structure was characterized for the first time by X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis, which revealed the saddle&#8208;shaped &#960;&#8208;conjugated polyaromatics.







Abstract
Carbazole&#8208;based aza[7]helicenes and hetero[9]helicenes were successfully obtained via the intramolecular Scholl reaction of 3,6&#8208;bis(biphenyl&#8208;2&#8208;yl)carbazole congeners, while the reaction of 3,6&#8208;bis(naphthylphenyl)&#8208;appended carbazole gave a triple helicene via an unexpected simultaneous double aryl rearrangement. DFT calculations suggested that the rearrangement proceeded via an arenium cation intermediate. In addition, the reaction of methoxy&#8208;appended substrate gave an azahepta[8]circulene via the concurrent C&#8722;C bond formation. These helical dyes showed circularly polarized luminescence. The azahepta[8]circulene was further transformed into deeply saddle&#8208;distorted dibenzodiaza[8]circulenes as the first example of its solution&#8208;based synthesis and unambiguous structural determination.

&lt;p&gt;Carbazole-based aza[7]helicenes and hetero[9]helicenes were successfully obtained via the intramolecular Scholl reaction of 3,6-bis(biphenyl-2-yl)carbazole congeners, while the reaction of 3,6-bis(naphthylphenyl)-appended carbazole gave a triple helicene via an unexpected simultaneous double aryl rearrangement. DFT calculations suggested that the rearrangement proceeded via an arenium cation intermediate. In addition, the reaction of methoxy-appended substrate gave an azahepta[8]circulene via the concurrent C&#8722;C bond formation. These helical dyes showed circularly polarized luminescence.

         <title>A Benzodiphosphaborolediide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The 1,3&#8208;diphosphaborolediide ligand motif, a hitherto missing member of the &#8220;hetero&#8208;Cp&#8220; family, is obtained within an indenyl scaffold as its dilithium salt, as both thf and TMEDA solvates. This dianionic ligand exhibits aromaticity commensurate with its hybrid phospholide&#8208;borolediide nature, as is determined by NICS calculations and observed experimentally for both lithium salts. Additionally, coordination to zero&#8208;valent molybdenum is achieved, demonstrating a capacity to to coordinate readily as a &#960;&#8208; and bridging &#960;&#8208;,&#963;&#8208;type ligand.







Abstract
The first example of a diphosphaborolediide, the benzo&#8208;fused [C6H4P2BPh]2&#8722; (12&#8722;), is prepared from ortho&#8208;bis(phosphino)benzene (C6H4{PH2}) and dichlorophenylborane, via a sequential lithiation approach. The dilithio&#8208;salt can be obtained as an oligomeric THF solvate or discrete TMEDA adduct, both of which are fully characterized, including by X&#8208;ray diffraction. Alongside NICS calculations, data strongly suggest some aromaticity within 12&#8722;, which is further supported by preliminary coordination studies that demonstrate &#951;5&#8208;coordination to a zerovalent molybdenum center, as observed crystallographically for the oligomeric [{Mo(CO)3(&#951;5&#8208;1)}{&#956;&#8208;&#951;1&#8208;Mo(CO)3(TMEDA)}2]&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;[&#956;&#8208;Li(THF)][&#956;&#8208;Li(TMEDA)].

         <title>Accessing Extended Fused Isoindolinones Via Sequential Anionic Intramolecular Cyclizations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Modelling was used to predict how stereoelectronic effects could be used for regio&#8208;control of 6&#8208;exo versus 7&#8208;endo nucleophilic cyclizations. This stereoelectronic effect was then used synthetically to provide access to fully conjugated and &#960;&#8208;extended isoindolinones.







Abstract
Sequential anionic intramolecular cyclizations and modelling were used for the first time to access unusual fused heterocyclic frameworks in excellent yields. 5&#8208;Exo&#8208;dig cyclizations yielded isoindolinone motifs and a subsequent 6&#8208;exo&#8208; and 7&#8208;endo&#8208;dig cyclization was directed to provide either fused isoquinoline or azepine frameworks. Regioselectivities were controlled by exploiting stereoelectronic effects via nC&#8722;&#8594;&#960;*(Ph) interactions, and modelling studies provided reaction scope.

         <title>Synthesis of Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons Decorated by Fluorinated Carbon Acids/Carbanions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reaction of biphenyl&#8208;alkynes with in&#8197;situ generated Tf2C=CH2 followed by neutralization gave polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) decorated by a highly stabilized carbanionic functionality. Thus obtained PAHs showed improved solubility in both aqueous and organic solvents.







Abstract
The carboarylation reaction of biphenyl&#8208;alkynes was successfully triggered by electrophilic attack of 1,1&#8208;bis(triflyl)ethylene on the alkyne moiety to give polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) decorated by superacidic carbon acid functionality. Neutralisation of thus obtained acids with NaHCO3 yielded the corresponding sodium salts, which showed improved solubility in both aqueous and organic solvents.

         <dc:description>
Winning combo: Porphyrins and polyoxometalates can be combined into useful architectures for energy conversion, this minireview highlights the most successful strategies developed to date.







Abstract
Polyoxometalates (POMs) can act as unique reservoirs for multiple electron transfers. As POMs display only weak absorption in the visible spectrum, they can be associated with chromophores such as porphyrins and porphyrin antennae. In this Minireview, the research dedicated to the combination of porphyrins and polyoxometalates is put in context and the state of the art identifying the challenges addressed in the optimization of hybrid materials for applications is detailed.

         <title>Reversible pH&#8208;Controlled Catenation of a Benzobisimidazole&#8208;Based Tetranuclear Rectangle</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A pH&#8208;sensitive metalla&#8208;rectangle constructed from the benzobisimidazole (BBI) framework dimerizes in solution to form a catenane. It can be dissociated thanks to three different pathways: dilution, addition of pyrene to form a 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 host&#8208;guest complex and selective protonation of the bisimidazole rings. The latter process is reversible through addition of a base and occurs without any sign of disassembling.







Abstract
The development of methodologies to control on demand and reversibly supramolecular transformations from self&#8208;assembled metalla&#8208;structures requires the rational design of architectures able to answer to an applied stimulus. While solvent or concentration changes, light exposure or addition of a chemical have been largely explored to provide these transformations, the case of pH sensitive materials is less described. Herein, we report the first example of a pH&#8208;triggered dissociation of a coordination&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembled interlocked molecular link. It incorporates a pH sensitive benzobisimidazole&#8208;based ligand that can be selectively protonated on its bisimidazole moieties. This generates intermolecular electrostatic repulsions that reduces drastically the stability of the interlocked structure, leading to its dissociation without any sign of protonation of the pyridine moieties involved in the coordination bonds. Importantly, the dissociation process is reversible through addition of a base.

     alt="Reversible pH-Controlled Catenation of a Benzobisimidazole-Based Tetranuclear Rectangle"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A pH-sensitive&lt;/b&gt; metalla-rectangle constructed from the benzobisimidazole (BBI) framework dimerizes in solution to form a catenane. It can be dissociated thanks to three different pathways: dilution, addition of pyrene to form a 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 host-guest complex and selective protonation of the bisimidazole rings. The latter process is reversible through addition of a base and occurs without any sign of disassembling.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The development of methodologies to control on demand and reversibly supramolecular transformations from self-assembled metalla-structures requires the rational design of architectures able to answer to an applied stimulus. While solvent or concentration changes, light exposure or addition of a chemical have been largely explored to provide these transformations, the case of pH sensitive materials is less described. Herein, we report the first example of a pH-triggered dissociation of a coordination-driven self-assembled interlocked molecular link. It incorporates a pH sensitive benzobisimidazole-based ligand that can be selectively protonated on its bisimidazole moieties. This generates intermolecular electrostatic repulsions that reduces drastically the stability of the interlocked structure, leading to its dissociation without any sign of protonation of the pyridine moieties involved in the coordination bonds. Importantly, the dissociation process is reversible through addition of a base.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>High Fidelity Enzyme&#8208;Free Primer Extension with an Ethynylpyridone Thymidine Analog</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Strongly binding analog: When thymidine is replaced with ethynylmethylpyridone, enzyme&#8208;free genetic copying occurs faster and with higher fidelity.







Abstract
High fidelity base pairing is important for the transmission of genetic information. Weak base pairs can lower fidelity, complicating sequencing, amplification and replication of DNA. Thymidine 5&#8242;&#8208;monophosphate (TMP) is the most weakly pairing nucleotide among the canonical deoxynucleotides, causing high errors rates in enzyme&#8208;free primer extension. Here we report the synthesis of an ethynylpyridone C&#8208;nucleoside analog of 3&#8242;&#8208;amino&#8208;2&#8242;,3&#8242;&#8208;dideoxythymidine monophosphate and its incorporation in a growing strand by enzyme&#8208;free primer extension. The ethynylpyridone C&#8208;nucleotide accelerates extension more than five&#8208;fold, reduces misincorporation and readily displaces TMP in competition experiments. The results bode well for the use of the C&#8208;nucleoside as replacements for thymidine in practical applications.

         <title>Monocyclometalated (C^N) Gold(III) Metallacycles: Tunable Emission and Singlet Oxygen (1O2) Generation Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new class of monocyclometalated gold(III) diacetylide metallacycles has been synthesized and characterized. Photophysical investigations of these complexes revealed strong phosphorescence with very long excited&#8208;state lifetimes. We demonstrate the efficient singlet&#8208;oxygen&#8208;generation properties of these metallacycles through their ability to sensitize singlet oxygen. The complexes&#8242; varying ability to generate singlet oxygen opens avenues for their potential use in catalysis and biomedical applications. More information can be found in the Full Paper by K.&#8197;Venkatesan et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202102331).

         <title>Bilayer rGO&#8208;based Photothermal Evaporator for Efficient Solar&#8208;Driven Water Purification</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Interfacial evaporation has emerged as a promising approach to produce freshwater. However, an urgent concern is that, due to the illegal discharge of industrial wastewater, most water bodies are polluted by trace volatile organic compounds (VOCs), which are easily volatilized and enriched in the collected water during the interfacial evaporation process. Herein, a bilayer photothermal evaporator was reasonably designed for contaminated water purification. The bottom hydrophilic rGO&#8208;sodium alginate (SA) sheets purposefully disintegrate water transport channels, thus quickly removing VOCs through physical adsorption. The rGO&#8208;SA&#8208;TiO2 upper layer sufficiently absorbs incident light and therefore persistently generates reactive oxidizing species to degrade upward VOCs. Notably, the oriented microchannels inside the evaporator allow sustained light reflections to improve the utilization of solar energy. The evaporation rate can reach 1.63 kg m&#8208;2 h&#8208;1 with a considerably high VOC removal efficiency of up to 96%. Such an integrated bilayer evaporator provides an effective strategy to obtain clean water via solar distillation.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A pH&#8208;responsive drug delivery system based on mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSN) has been prepared for the delivery of three drugs with different modes of action (phthalocyanine (Pc) camptothecin (CPT) and doxorubicin (DOX)). The pores of the MSN were loaded with a photoactive conjugate formed from Pc and CPT joined by a glutathione&#8208;sensitive linker. DOX was covalently bound to the outer surface of the MSN through a dihydrazone poly(ethylene glycol) linker. Uptake studies demonstrated proper endocytosis of the system and subsequent delivery of the three drugs into the cytoplasm and nucleus. The synergistic effect of the drugs and Pc upon light irradiation was also assessed in vitro. More information can be found in the Full Paper by T. Torres, D.&#8197;K.&#8197;P. Ng, D. S&#225;nchez&#8208;Garc&#237;a et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202101842).

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
From the drawing board to the product, crystalline protein assemblies with alternating compact and porous layers were obtained. Trimeric protein RSL, with pseudo&#8208;C6 symmetry, forms honeycomb assemblies in the presence of cucurbit[7]uril. A coiled&#8208;coil fused to the N&#8197;terminus of RSL re&#8208;forms the honeycomb assembly but with poorly packed spacer layers. Such bio&#8208;supramolecular tectonics could serve the development of biomaterials. More information can be found in the Full Paper by P.&#8197;B. Crowley et&#8197;al.

         <title>Lewis Superacidic Tellurenyl Cation&#8208;Induced Electrophilic Activation of an Inert Carborane</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In a metastable N&#8208;coordinated Lewis superacidic tellurenyl cation&#8211;carborane ion pair, the Te atom is trying to steal the H atom with help of a N atom. However, although at first glance the N atom is helping, he is actually planning to steal the asset for himself. The Town Musicians came to scare off the robbers, but they arrived too late, and thus nothing can stop nitrogen's plan. The broken window opens full insight into the electrophilic activation mechanism of the carborane moiety, which has been poorly understood so far. Elemental Te is watching the whole show and wondering how this is even possible; but was it the Te atom that broke the window? More information can be found in the Communication by M. Hejda, S. Ketkov, S. Mebs, J. Beckmann, et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202103181).

         <title>A Pyrene&#8208;Modified Serinol Nucleic Acid Nanostructure Converts the Chirality of Threoninol Nucleic Acids into Circularly Polarized Luminescence Signals</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Creating chiroptical signals: A circularly polarized luminescent (CPL) probe composed of serinol nucleic acids forms a one&#8208;dimensional nanostructure and expresses no CPL signals. However, helicity is induced when a chiral nucleic acid is added. As a result, the probe can switch CPL signals depending on the chirality of added nucleic acids. These findings will provide a new platform to convert the chiral information of biomolecules into chiroptical signals. More information can be found in the Communication by H. Kashida, H. Asanuma et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202102333).

         <title>Failure&#8208;experiment&#8208;supported optimization of poorly reproducible synthetic conditions for novel lanthanide metal&#8208;organic frameworks with two&#8208;dimensional secondary building units</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Novel metal&#8211;organic frameworks containing lanthanide double&#8208;layer&#8208;based secondary building units (KGF&#8208;3) were synthesized using machine learning (ML). Isolating pure KGF&#8208;3 was challenging, and the synthesis was not reproducible because impurity phases were frequently obtained under the same synthetic conditions. Thus, dominant factors for the synthesis of KGF&#8208;3 were identified, and its synthetic conditions were optimized using two ML techniques. Cluster analysis was used to classify the obtained powder X&#8208;ray diffractometry patterns of the products and thus automatically determine whether the experiments were successful. Decision tree analysis was used to visualize the experimental results, after extracting factors that mainly affected the synthetic reproducibility. Water adsorption isotherms revealed that KGF&#8208;3 possesses unique hydrophilic pores. Impedance measurements demonstrated good proton conductivities (  &#963;  = 5.2 &#215; 10  &#8722;4  S cm  &#8722;1  for KGF&#8208;3(Y)) at a high temperature (363 K) and relative humidity of 95% RH.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ordered molecular self&#8208;assembly of glycoamphiphiles has been regarded as an attractive, practical and bottom&#8208;up approach to obtain stable, structurally well&#8208;defined, and functional mimics of natural polysaccharides. This study describes a versatile and rational design of carbohydrate&#8208;based hydrogelators through  N  ,  N&#8217;  &#8208;substituted barbituric acid&#8208;mediated Knoevenagel condensation onto unprotected carbohydrates in water. Amphiphilic  N  &#8208;substituted &#946;&#8208;  C  &#8208;maltosylbarbiturates self&#8208;assembled into pH&#8208; and calcium&#8208;triggered alginate&#8208;like supramolecular hydrogel fibers with a multistimuli responsiveness to temperature, pH and competitive metal chelating agent. In addition, amphiphilic  N  ,  N&#8217;  &#8208;disubstituted &#946;&#8208;  C  &#8208;maltosylbarbiturates formed vesicle gels in pure water that were scarcely observed for glyco&#8208;hydrogelators. Finally, barbituric acid worked as a multitasking group allowing chemoselective ligation onto reducing&#8208;end carbohydrates, structural diversity, stimuli&#8208;sensitiveness, and supramolecular interactions by hydrogen bonding.</dc:description>

         <title>Pincer&#8208;supported gallium complexes for the catalytic hydroboration of aldehydes, ketones and carbon dioxide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Gallium hydrides stabilised by primary and secondary amines are scarce due to their propensity to eliminate dihydrogen. Consequently, their reactivity has received limited attention. We describe on the synthesis of two novel gallium hydride complexes HGa(THF)[ON(H)O] and H2Ga[&#956;2&#8208;ON(H)O]Ga[ON(H)O] ([ON(H)O]2&#8722; = N,N&#8208;bis(3,5&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;2&#8208;phenoxy)amine) and explore their reactivity towards aldehydes and ketones. These reactions afford alkoxide&#8208;bridged dimers through 1,2&#8208;hydrogallation reactions. The gallium hydrides can be regenerated through Ga&#8722;O/B&#8722;H metathesis from the reaction of such dimers with pinacol borane (HBpin) or 9&#8208;borabicyclo[3.3.1]nonane (9&#8208;BBN) dimer. These observations allowed us to target the catalytic reduction of carbonyl substrates (aldehydes, ketones and carbon dioxide) with low catalyst loadings at room temperature.</dc:description>

         <title>Bioengineered Protein&#8208;based Adhesives for Biomedical Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Protein&#8208;based adhesives with their robust adhesion performance and excellent biocompatibility have been extensively explored over years. In particular, the unique adhesion behaviors of mussel and sandcastle worm inspired the development of synthetic adhesives. However, the chemical synthesized adhesives often demonstrate weak underwater adhesion performance and poor biocompatibility/biodegradability, limiting their further biomedical applications. In sharp contrast, genetically engineering endows the protein&#8208;based adhesives the ability to maintain underwater adhesion property as well as biocompatibility/biodegradability. Herein, we outline recent advances in the design and development of protein&#8208;based adhesives by genetic engineering. We summarize the fabrication and adhesion performance of elastin&#8208;like polypeptide&#8208;based adhesives, followed by mussel foot protein (mfp) based adhesives and other sources protein&#8208;based adhesives, such as, spider silk spidroin and suckerin. In addition, the biomedical applications of these bioengineered protein&#8208;based adhesives are presented. Finally, we give a brief summary and perspective on the future development of bioengineered protein&#8208;based adhesives.</dc:description>

         <title>Supramolecular Assembly with Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission Property for Sensing and Detection</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The fabrication of new supramolecular materials for real&#8208;time detection of analytes including ions, organic pollutants, gases, biomolecules, and drugs is of pivotal importance in industrial manufacture, clinical treatment, and environmental remediation. Incorporating fluorescent molecules with distinct aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) effects into supramolecular assemblies has received much attention over the past two decades, owing to the remarkable performance of the AIE&#8208;active supramolecular materials in sensing and detection. In this minireview, we summarize the recent progress of superior detection systems on the basis of supramolecular assemblies accompanied with AIE features. We envision that this minireview will be helpful and timely for relevant researchers to stimulate new thinking for constructing new AIE&#8208;based supramolecular materials with advanced architectures for effective sensing and detection.</dc:description>

         <title>Investigation of the Organocatalytic Chlorination of 2&#8208;Phenylpropanal</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Results of an examination of the organocatalytic enantioselective &#945;&#8208;chlorination of 2&#8208;phenylpropanal are described. Synthetic investigation including the screening of primary and secondary aminocatalysts, many different reaction conditions, and other &#945;&#8208;branched aldehydes show that especially primary aminocatalysts can catalyze the formation of the &#945;&#8208;chloro branched aldehydes in good yields, but only with moderate enantioselectivities. In order to try to understand the challenge in obtaining high enantioselectivity for the aminocatalytic &#945;&#8208;chlorination of &#945;&#8208;branched aldehydes a series of experimental investigations were performed employing 2&#8208;phenylpropanal as a model system. These investigations have been coupled with computational investigations, which provided important insight into the moderate enantioselectivity of this chlorination reaction. Analysis of the reaction showed, that the lack of control over the selectivity of formation of the (E)&#8208; and (Z)&#8208;enamine intermediate, and the clustering of reaction barriers of possible reaction pathways help to rationalize difficulties in producing high enantioselectivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Metal Centers as Nucleophiles: Oxymoron of Halogen Bond&#8208;Involving Crystal Engineering</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This review highlights recent studies discovering unconventional halogen bonding (HaB) that involves positively charged metal centers. These centers provide their filled d&#8208;orbitals for HaB, and thus behave as nucleophilic components toward the noncovalent interaction. This role of some electron&#8208;rich transition metal centers can be considered an oxymoron in the sense that the metal is, in most cases, formally cationic; consequently, its electron donor function is unexpected. The importance of Ha&#8729;&#8729;&#8729;d&#8208;[M] (Ha = halogen; M is Group 9 (Rh, Ir), 10 (Ni, Pd, Pt), or 11 (Cu, Au)) interactions in crystal engineering is emphasized by showing remarkable examples (reported and uncovered by our processing of the Cambridge Structural Database), where this Ha&#8729;&#8729;&#8729;d&#8208;[M] directional interaction guides the formation of solid supramolecular assemblies of different dimensionalities.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Silylated Cyclobutanone and Cyclobutene Derivatives Involving 1,4&#8208;Addition of Zinc&#8208;Based Silicon Nucleophiles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of highly substituted cyclobutenones undergoes 1,4&#8208;addition with zinc&#8208;based nucleophiles with and, for non&#8208;hindered acceptors, without the aid of a copper catalyst. The intermediate metal enolate can be trapped as an enol phosphate and further reacted with Grignard reagents in Kumada cross&#8208;coupling reactions. By this, a range of silylated cyclobutanone and cyclobutene derivatives becomes accessible.







Abstract
A copper&#8208;catalyzed conjugate silylation of various cyclobutenone derivatives with Me2PhSiZnCl&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2LiCl or (Me2PhSi)2Zn&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;xLiCl (x&#8804;4) to generate &#946;&#8208;silylated cyclobutanones is reported. Trapping the intermediate enolate with ClP(O)(OPh)2 affords silylated enol phosphates that can be further engaged in Kumada cross&#8208;coupling reactions to yield silylated cyclobutene derivatives.

         <title>Investigation on Optical and Biological Properties of 2&#8208;(4&#8208;Dimethylaminophenyl)benzothiazole Based Cycloplatinated Complexes</title>

Biocompatible photosensitizers: Mono&#8208; and dinuclear cycloplatinated complexes featuring the donor&#8211;acceptor 2&#8208;(4&#8208;dimethylaminophenyl)benzothiazolyl ligand (Me2N&#8208;pbt) and biologically active phosphines show dual emission and photoinduced phosphorescence generating 1O2, with potential applications in theranostics and photodynamic therapy.







Abstract
The optical and biological properties of 2&#8208;(4&#8208;dimethylaminophenyl)benzothiazole cycloplatinated complexes featuring bioactive ligands ([{Pt(Me2N&#8208;pbt)(C6F5)}L] [L=Me2N&#8208;pbtH 1, p&#8208;dpbH (4&#8208;(diphenylphosphino)benzoic acid) 2, o&#8208;dpbH (2&#8208;(diphenylphosphino)benzoic acid) 3), [Pt(Me2N&#8208;pbt)(o&#8208;dpb)] 4, [{Pt(Me2N&#8208;pbt)(C6F5)}2(&#956;&#8208;PRnP)] [PR4P=O(CH2CH2OC(O)C6H4PPh2)2 5, PR12P=O{(CH2CH2O)3C(O)C6H4PPh2}2 6] are presented. Complexes 1&#8211;6 display 1ILCT and metal&#8208;perturbed 3ILCT dual emissions. The ratio between both bands is excitation dependent, accomplishing warm&#8208;white emissions for 2, 5 and 6. The phosphorescent emission is lost in aerated solutions owing to photoinduced electron transfer to 3O2 and the formation of 1O2, as confirmed in complexes 2 and 4. They also exhibit photoinduced phosphorescence enhancement in non&#8208;degassed DMSO due to local oxidation of DMSO by sensitized 1O2, which causes a local degassing. Me2N&#8208;pbtH and the complexes specifically accumulate in the Golgi apparatus, although only 2, 3 and 6 were active against A549 and HeLa cancer cell lines, 6 being highly selective in respect to nontumoral cells. The potential photodynamic property of these complexes was demonstrated with complex 4.

         <title>Mirror Symmetry Breaking and Network Formation in Achiral Polycatenars with Thioether Tail</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Spontaneous mirror&#8208;symmetry breaking. Achiral multichain &#960;&#8208;conjugated rod&#8208;like molecules form a series of chiral and achiral liquid crystalline networks as well as mirror symmetry broken liquids. The effect of thioalkyl chains on helical self&#8208;assembly and network formation is discussed.







Abstract
Mirror symmetry breaking in systems composed of achiral molecules is of importance for the design of functional materials for technological applications as well as for the understanding of the mechanisms of spontaneous emergence of chirality. Herein, we report the design and molecular self&#8208;assembly of two series of rod&#8208;like achiral polycatenar molecules derived from a &#960;&#8208;conjugated 5,5&#8217;&#8208;diphenyl&#8208;2,2&#8217;&#8208;bithiophene core with a fork&#8208;like triple alkoxylated end and a variable single alkylthio chain at the other end. In both series of liquid crystalline materials, differing in the chain length at the trialkoxylated end, helical self&#8208;assembly of the &#960;&#8208;conjugated rods in networks occurs, leading to wide temperature ranges (&gt;200&#8197;K) of bicontinuous cubic network phases, in some cases being stable even around ambient temperatures. The achiral bicontinuous cubic Ia
d phase (gyroid) is replaced upon alkylthio chain elongation by a spontaneous mirror symmetry broken bicontinuous cubic phase (I23) and a chiral isotropic liquid phase (Iso1[*]). Further chain elongation results in removing the I23 phase and the re&#8208;appearance of the Ia
d phase with different pitch lengths. In the second series an additional tetragonal phase separates the two cubic phase types.

         <title>Abrupt Spin&#8208;State Switching in Mn(III) Complexes with BPh4&#160;Anion: Effect of Halide Substituents on Crystal Structure and Magnetic Properties.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Three tetraphenylborates of mononuclear Mn(III) cation complexes with hexadentate ligands, the products of the reaction between a N,N&#162;&#8208;bis(3&#8208;aminopropyl)ethylenediamine and salicylaldehydes with the different haloid substitutions at the 5 or 3,5 positions, have been synthesized: [Mn(5&#8208;F&#8208;sal&#8208;N&#8208;1,5,8,12)]BPh  4  (  1  ), [Mn(3,5&#8208;diCl&#8208;sal&#8208;N&#8208;1,5,8,12)]BPh  4  (  2  ) and [Mn(3,5&#8208;Br,Cl&#8208;sal&#8208;N&#8208;1,5,8,12)]BPh  4  (  3  ). Their crystal structure, dielectric constant (e) and magnetic properties have been studied. Ligand substituents have a dramatic effect on the structure and magnetic properties of the complexes. With decreasing temperature, the complex (  1  ) shows a gradual spin crossover from the high&#8208;spin state (HS) to the HS:LS intermediate phase, followed by an abrupt transition to the low&#8208;spin state (LS) without changing the crystal symmetry. The complexes  2  and  3  are isostructural, but have fundamentally different properties. Complex  2  demonstrates two structural phase transitions related to sharp spin crossovers from the HS to the HS:LS intermediate phase&#160;at 137 K and from the intermediate phase&#160;to the LS at 87 K, while complex  3  exhibits only one spin transition from the HS to the&#160;HS:LS intermediate phase at 83 K.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed multicomponent carbonylation is one of the most efficient strategies to construct carbonyl&#8208;containing compounds. Herein, we developed a palladium&#8208;catalyzed four&#8208;component  per  fluoroalkylation/aminocarbonylation of unactivated alkenes with  perfluoroalkyl halides  , and amines. A wide range of substrates, including anilines, alkylamines, sulfonamides, and hydrazines are all suitable reaction partners for this catalyst system, which resulting various  &#946;  &#8208;perfluoroalkyl amides  with good functional&#8208;group tolerance and excellent chemoselectivity. Furthermore, not only alkyl olefins, but also aliphatic alkynes, and even alkyl allenes can all be employed. Notably, several medical and bio&#8208;active related molecules are compatible here as well.</dc:description>

         <title>Structure and Biosynthesis of Myxofacyclines: Unique Myxobacterial Polyketides Featuring Varying and Rare Heterocycles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A metabolome&#8208;guided screening approach in the novel myxobacterium  Corallococcus  sp. MCy9072 resulted in the isolation of the unprecedented natural product myxofacycline A featuring a rare isoxazole substructure. Identification and genomic investigation of additional producers alongside targeted gene inactivation experiments and heterologous expression of the corresponding biosynthetic gene cluster in the host  Myxococcus xanthus  DK1622 confirmed a noncanonical megaenzyme complex as the biosynthetic origin of myxofacycline A. Induced expression of the respective genes led to significantly increased production titers enabling the identification of six further members of the myxofacycline natural product family. Whereas myxofacycline A&#8211;D display an isoxazole substructure, myxofacycline E and F intriguingly were found to contain 4&#8208;pyrimidinole, a heterocycle unprecedented in natural products. Lastly, myxofacycline G features another rare 1,2&#8208;dihydropyrol&#8208;3&#8208;one moiety. In addition to the full structure elucidation, we report the underlying biosynthetic machinery and present a rationale for the formation of all myxofacyclines. Unexpectedly, an extraordinary polyketide synthase&#8208;nonribosomal peptide synthetase hybrid was found to produce all three types of heterocycles in these natural products.</dc:description>

         <title>Breaking Symmetry Relaxes Structural and Magnetic Restraints, Suppressing QTM in Enantiopure Butterfly Fe2Dy2 SMMs.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The {Fe  2  Dy  2  } butterfly systems can show Single Molecule Magnet (SMM) behaviour, the nature of which depends on details of the electronic structure, as previously demonstrated for the  [Fe  2  Dy  2  (&#956;  3  &#8208;OH)  2  (Me&#8208;teaH)  2  (O  2  CPh)  6  ]  compound, where the [N,N&#8208;bis&#8208;(2&#8208;hydroxyethyl)&#8208;amino]&#8208;2&#8208;propanol (Me&#8208;teaH  3  ) ligand is usually used in its racemic form. Here we describe the consequences for the SMM properties by using enantiopure versions of this ligand and present here the first homochiral 3d/4f SMM, which could only be obtained for the S enantiomer of the ligand for  [Fe  2  Dy  2  (&#956;  3  &#8208;OH)  2  (Me&#8208;teaH)  2  (O  2  CPh)  6  ]  since the R&#8208;enantiomer underwent significant racemisation. To investigate this further, we prepared the  [Fe  2  Dy  2  (&#956;  3  &#8208;OH)  2  (Me&#8208;teaH)  2  (O  2  CPh)  4  (NO  3  )  2  ]  version, which could be obtained as the  RS  &#8208;,  R  &#8208; and  S  &#8208;compounds. Remarkably, the enantiopure versions show enhanced slow relaxation of magnetisation. The use of the enantiomerically pure ligand suppresses QTM, leading to the conclusion that use of enantiopure ligands is a &#8220;gamechanger&#8221; by breaking the cluster symmetry and altering the intimate details of the coordination cluster&#8217;s molecular structure.</dc:description>

Chemical bonding analyses indicate that carbon is covalently bonded to chalcogens and ionically connected to alkali metals.</dc:description>

         <title>Contrasting the Mechanism of H2 Activation by Monomeric and Potassium&#8208;Stabilized Dimeric Al(I) Complexes: Do Potassium Atoms Exert any Cooperative Effect?</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aluminyl anions are low valent, anionic and carbenoid aluminum species. Various research groups have detected that the potassium atoms play a stabilization role via electrostatic and cation  &#8230;  &#960; interactions with nearby (aromatic)&#8208;carbocyclic rings. In this work, the activation of H  2  utilizing a NON&#8208;xanthene&#8208;Al dimer (  D  ) and monomeric (  M  ) catalysts are studied to reveal the potential role of K  +&#160;  atoms during the activation of this gas.&#160; We aim to reveal whether if  D  is more reactive than  M  (or vice versa), or if complicity between the two monomer units exits within the  D  catalyst . The results suggest that activation energies using the dimeric and monomeric catalysts were found to be very close (around 33 kcal mol  &#8208;1  ). However, a partition of activation energies unveiled that the natures of the energy barriers are inherently different, the former being dominated by a more substantial distortion of the reactants. Interestingly, during the oxidative addition, the distortion of the Al complex is minimal, while H  2  distorts the most, usually over 0.77&#916;E  dist  . Overall, it is found here that electrostatic and induction energies are the main stabilizing components of the interaction energy. The results suggest that the K  +  atoms act as stabilizers of the dimeric structure, and their catalytic role on the reaction mechanism may be negligible, acting as mere spectators in the activation of H  2  . Cooperation between the two monomers in  D  is lacking, and therefore the subsequent activation of H  2  is wholly disengaged.</dc:description>

         <title>Construction of CoS2/Zn0.5Cd0.5S S&#8208;Scheme Heterojunction for Enhancing H2 Evolution Activity Under Visible Light</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Zn0.5Cd0.5S and CoS2 formed an S&#8208;type heterojunction. The mixed interface structure between them provided a new hydrogen&#8208;producing active center for each. In addition, the S&#8208;type heterojunction electron transfer mechanism not only promoted the separation of electrons (e&#8722;) and holes (h+) between Zn0.5Cd0.5S and CoS2, but also retained electrons with strong reducibility, thereby promoting the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction.







Abstract
In the field of photocatalysis, building a heterojunction is an effective way to promote electron transfer and enhance the reducibility of electrons. Herein, the S&#8208;scheme heterojunction photocatalyst (CoS2/Zn0.5Cd0.5S) of CoS2 nanospheres modified Zn0.5Cd0.5S solid solution was synthesized and studied. The H2 evolution rate of the composite catalyst reached 25.15&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1, which was 3.26&#8197;times that of single Zn0.5Cd0.5S, whereas pure CoS2 showed almost no hydrogen production activity. Moreover, CoS2/Zn0.5Cd0.5S had excellent stability and the hydrogen production rate after six cycles of experiments only dropped by 6.19&#8201;%. In addition, photoluminescence spectroscopy and photoelectrochemical experiments had effectively proved that the photogenerated carrier transfer rate of CoS2/Zn0.5Cd0.5S was better than CoS2 or Zn0.5Cd0.5S single catalyst. In this study, the synthesized CoS2 and Zn0.5Cd0.5S were both n&#8208;type semiconductors. After close contact, they followed an S&#8208;scheme heterojunction electron transfer mechanism, which not only promoted the separation of their respective holes and electrons, but also retained a stronger reduction potential, thus promoting the reduction of H+ protons in photocatalytic experiments. In short, this work provided a new basis for the construction of S&#8208;scheme heterojunction in addition to being used for photocatalytic hydrogen production.

         <title>Steering Scholl Oxidative Heterocoupling by Tuning Topology and Electronics for Building Thiananographenes and Their Functional N&#8722;/C&#8722;Congeners</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Intramolecular thiophene&#8208;arene C&#8722;C heterocoupling is successfully achieved in a set of topologically and electronically engineered bis(biaryl)thiophenes (BATs) under Scholl oxidative conditions to provide symmetric and unsymmetric diphenanthrothiophenes (DPTs), simple thiananographenes. The thia&#8208;edge of diphenanthrothiophenes are conveniently transformed into blue&#8208;emissive and electrochemically stable N&#8722;/C&#8722;edged congeners.







Abstract
While intramolecular Scholl oxidative coupling between two arenes is common, successful C&#8722;C heterocoupling between thiophene and arene is scarce. The latter is due to the notorious reactivity of thiophene towards polymerization under oxidative conditions. This report systematically demonstrates how topological variation of electronics and reactivity in thiophene substrates can lead to efficient oxidative heterocoupling. Bis(biaryl)thiophenes having reactive &#945;&#8208; and &#946;&#8208;positions open are the choice of substrates. The cyclizing arene partners are so electronically tuned for thiophene's reactivity (at &#945;&#8208; and &#946;&#8208;) as to establish C&#8722;C bond oxidatively generating symmetrical as well as unsymmetrical diphenanthrothiophenes which are basic thiananographenes. Depending on the cyclizing&#8208;couple's electronics, either arene&#8208; or thiophene&#8208;centered oxidation initiates C&#8722;C heterocoupling. The potential utility of these simple thiananographenes is further unfurled by converting them to functional N&#8722;/C&#8208;graphene segments that are aza&#8208;corannulene precursor and tetrabenzospirobifluorene. Their bright emission and extended electrochemical stability are remarkable that may be potentially important and applicable.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Intramolecular thiophene-arene&lt;/b&gt; C&#8722;C heterocoupling is successfully achieved in a set of topologically and electronically engineered bis(biaryl)thiophenes (BATs) under Scholl oxidative conditions to provide symmetric and unsymmetric diphenanthrothiophenes (DPTs), simple thiananographenes. The thia-edge of diphenanthrothiophenes are conveniently transformed into blue-emissive and electrochemically stable N&#8722;/C&#8722;edged congeners.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While intramolecular Scholl oxidative coupling between two arenes is common, successful C&#8722;C heterocoupling between thiophene and arene is scarce. The latter is due to the notorious reactivity of thiophene towards polymerization under oxidative conditions. This report systematically demonstrates how topological variation of electronics and reactivity in thiophene substrates can lead to efficient oxidative heterocoupling. Bis(biaryl)thiophenes having reactive &#945;- and &#946;-positions open are the choice of substrates. The cyclizing arene partners are so electronically tuned for thiophene's reactivity (at &#945;- and &#946;-) as to establish C&#8722;C bond oxidatively generating symmetrical as well as unsymmetrical diphenanthrothiophenes which are basic thiananographenes. Depending on the cyclizing-couple's electronics, either arene- or thiophene-centered oxidation initiates C&#8722;C heterocoupling. The potential utility of these simple thiananographenes is further unfurled by converting them to functional N&#8722;/C-graphene segments that are aza-corannulene precursor and tetrabenzospirobifluorene. Their bright emission and extended electrochemical stability are remarkable that may be potentially important and applicable.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Host&#8208;Guest Complexation Between Cyclodextrins and Hybrid Hexavanadates: What are the Driving Forces?</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydrophobic or chaotropic effect? Hybrid Lindqvist&#8208;type polyoxovanadates self&#8208;assemble with cyclodextrins (&#945;&#8208;, &#946;&#8208;, and &#947;&#8208;) in water to form a wide variety of host&#8208;guest complexes. Such a supramolecular process originates from the ability of the CD host to desolvate the hybrid guests, but the nature of this solvent effect depends on the cyclodextrins, inducing direct consequences on redox properties of the guest.







Abstract
Host&#8208;guest complexes between native cyclodextrins (&#945;&#8208;, &#946;&#8208; and &#947;&#8208;CD) and hybrid Lindqvist&#8208;type polyoxovanadates (POVs) [V6O13((OCH2)3C&#8722;R)2]2&#8211; with R = CH2CH3, NO2, CH2OH and NH(BOC) (BOC = N&#8208;tert&#8208;butoxycarbonyl) were studied in aqueous solution. Six crystal structures determined by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis revealed the nature of the functional R group strongly influences the host&#8211;guest conformation and also the crystal packing. In all systems isolated in the solid&#8208;state, the organic groups R are embedded within the cyclodextrin cavities, involving only a few weak supramolecular contacts. The interaction between hybrid POVs and the macrocyclic organic hosts have been deeply studied in solution using ITC, cyclic voltammetry and NMR methods (1D 1H NMR, and 2D DOSY, and ROESY). This set of complementary techniques provides clear insights about the strength of interactions and the binding host&#8208;guest modes occurring in aqueous solution, highlighting a dramatic influence of the functional group R on the supramolecular properties of the hexavanadate polyoxoanions (association constant K1:1 vary from 0 to 2 000&#8197;M&#8722;1) while isolated functional organic groups exhibit only very weak intrinsic affinity with CDs. Electrochemical and calorimetric investigations suggest that the driving force of the host&#8208;guest association involving larger CDs (&#946;&#8208; and &#947;&#8208;CD) is mainly related to the chaotropic effect. In contrast, the hydrophobic effect supported by weak attractive forces appears as the main contributor for the formation of &#945;&#8208;CD&#8208;containing host&#8208;guest complexes. In any cases, the origin of driving forces is clearly related to the ability of the macrocyclic host to desolvate the exposed moieties of the hybrid POVs.

         <title>Helical Oligophenylene Linked with [2.2]Paracyclophane: Stereogenic &#960;&#8208;Conjugated Dye for Highly Emissive Chiroptical Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Helical oligophenylene: Chiral cyclic homologues with unique structures such as double helices and twisted triangles, have been synthesized as highly emissive chiroptical dyes. The twisted quaterphenyl units exhibited CPL with a high quantum yield (0.73&#8211;0.80), leading to relatively high CPL brightness.







Abstract
A stereogenic &#960;&#8208;system based on dimer (2) and trimer (3) of [2.2]paracyclophane (PC) and biphenyl was prepared and its structural, photophysical, and chiroptical properties were investigated. X&#8208;ray analysis revealed that the quaterphenyl moieties in 2 adopt a double helical structure anchoring [2.2]PC from both sides. Furthermore, 3 forms a isosceles triangle structure with a large chiral cavity. A homodesmotic reaction using DFT calculations revealed that 2 has a larger strain energy than 3 owing to its highly twisted phenylene linkers. Electronic and circular dichroic (CD) spectra were recorded in CH2Cl2 solution. The spectra of both 2 and 3 are similar, and their longest absorption band accompanying a remarkable Cotton effect is attributed to the transition from HOMO to LUMO, which is delocalized to the quaterphenyl moiety. These compounds exhibit fairly high fluorescence quantum yields (&#981;=0.70&#8211;0.83) and moderate dissymmetry factor (|gCPL|=1.6&#215;10&#8722;3) in circularly polarized luminescence (CPL).

         <title>Constructing Highly Efficient Blue OLEDs with External Quantum Efficiencies up to 7.5&#8201;% Based on Anthracene Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Better Constructions: By inserting anthracene core in the deep&#8208;blue building block, two D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A fluorescent blue emitters, ICz&#8208;An&#8208;PPI and IP&#8208;An&#8208;PPI were designed and synthesized. Impressively, the doped deep&#8208;blue OLED based on IP&#8208;An&#8208;PPI exhibited excellent performances with an unexpectedly high EQE of 7.5&#8201;% with the CIE coordinate of (0.150, 0.118), which is one of the best among the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art deep&#8208;blue OLEDs with the CIEy &lt;0.12.







Abstract
Acquiring desirable device performance with deep&#8208;blue color purity that fulfills practical application requirements is still a challenge. Bipolar fluorescent emitters with hybrid local and charge transfer (HLCT) state may serve to address this issue. Herein, by inserting anthracene core in the deep&#8208;blue building blocks, the authors successfully developed two highly twisted D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A fluorescent emitters, ICz&#8208;An&#8208;PPI and IP&#8208;An&#8208;PPI, featuring different acceptor groups. Both exhibited superb thermal stabilities, high photo luminescent quantum yields and excellent bipolar transport capabilities. The non&#8208;doped OLEDs using ICz&#8208;An&#8208;PPI and IP&#8208;An&#8208;PPI as the emitting layers showed efficient blue emission with an external quantum efficiency (EQEmax) of 4.32&#8201;% and 5.41&#8201;%, and the CIE coordinates of (0.147, 0.180) and (0.149, 0.150), respectively. In addition, the deep blue doped device based on ICz&#8208;An&#8208;PPI was achieved with an excellent CEmax of 5.83 cd A&#8722;1, EQEmax of 4.6&#8201;% and the CIE coordinate of (0.148, 0.078), which is extremely close to the National Television Standards Committee (NTSC) standard. Particularly, IP&#8208;An&#8208;PPI&#8208;based doped device had better performance, with an EQEmax of 7.51&#8201;% and the CIE coordinate of (0.150, 0.118), which was very impressive among the recently reported deep&#8208;blue OLEDs with the CIEy &lt;0.12. Such high performance may be attributed to the hot exciton HLCT mechanism via T7 to S2. Our work may provide a new approach for designing high&#8208;efficiency deep&#8208;blue materials.

Janus all&#8208;cis 2,3,4,5,6&#8208;pentafluorocyclohexyl building blocks have been incorporated into medicinal chemistry type products. These cyclohexanes have polarized faces and represent a unique motif for medicinal chemistry. The paper introduces a range of new accessible building blocks which can be elaborated into a diversity of drug type structures demonstrating their wider utility for exploration in bioactives discovery chemistry.







Abstract
Monoalkylated derivatives of the unusually polar all&#8208;cis 2,3,4,5,6&#8208; pentafluorocyclohexyl (Janus face) motif are prepared starting from an aryl hydrogenation of 2,3,4,5,6&#8208; pentafluorophenylacetate methyl ester 15. The method used Zeng's Rh(CAAC) carbene catalyst 4 in the hydrogenation following the protocol developed by Glorius. The resultant Janus pentafluorocyclohexylacetate methyl ester 16 was converted to the corresponding alcohol 18, aldehyde 13, bromide 29 and azide 14 through functional group manipulations, and some of these building blocks were used in Ugi&#8208;multicomponent and Cu&#8208;catalysed click reactions. NBoc protected pentafluoroarylphenylalanine methyl ester 35 was also subject to an aryl hydrogenation, and then deprotection to generate the Janus face &#946;&#8208;pentafluorocyclohexyl&#8208;alanine amino acid 15, which was incorporated into representative members of an emerging class of candidate antiviral compounds. Log&#8197;P measurements demonstrate that the all&#8208;cis 2,3,4,5,6&#8208;pentafluorocyclohexyl ring system is more polar than a phenyl ring. In overview the paper introduces new building blocks containing this Janus ring and demonstrates their progression to molecules typically used in bioactives discovery programmes.

         <title>Stereoselective Direct N&#8208;Trifluoropropenylation of Heterocycles with a Hypervalent Iodonium Reagent</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
E&#8208;selective trifluoropropenylation of versatile N&#8208;heterocycles was developed with the utilization of trifluoropropenyliodonium salts. The procedure enables the straightforward direct introduction of the trifluoroalkenyl moiety into heterocyclic scaffolds under simple and mild reaction conditions.







Abstract
The availability and synthesis of fluorinated enamine derivatives such as N&#8208;(3,3,3&#8208;trifluoropropenyl)heterocycles are challenging, especially through direct functionalization of the heterocyclic scaffold. Herein, a stereoselective N&#8208;trifluoropropenylation method based on the use of a bench&#8208;stable trifluoropropenyl iodonium salt is described. This reagent enables the straightforward trifluoropropenylation of various N&#8208;heterocycles under mild reaction conditions, providing trifluoromethyl enamine type moieties with high stereoselectivity and efficiency.

         <title>Computational Analysis of Photophysical Properties and Reactivity of a New Phototherapeutic Cyclometalated Au(III)&#8208;Hydride Complex</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reactivity exploration by DFT and TD&#8208;DFT of a cyclometalated Au(III)&#8208;hydride complex, as the first member of a new series of Au(III) complexes, has confirmed the low hydricity in dark and the high propensity to undergo substitution reactions leading to H2 release when irradiated. Computational photophysical characterization has allowed the identification of the excited singlet and triplet states involved in substitution reactions. Two&#8208;photon excitation feasibility has been also tested.







Abstract
Gold(III) complexes have recently emerged as new versatile and efficacious metal containing anticancer agents. In an attempt to reconcile the specific affinity of such complexes for target sulfur containing biomolecules with their capability to strongly bind thiol&#8208;containing compounds widely distributed in non&#8208;tumoral cells, a new series of cyclometalated Au(III)&#8208;hydride complexes has been proposed as photoactivatable anticancer prodrugs. Here, the computational exploration of the photophysical properties and reactivity in dark and under light irradiation of the first member of the series, named 1&#8201;a, is reported. Complex 1&#8201;a low hydricity in dark together with facile hydride substitution leading to H2 elimination under excitation by visible light have been examined by means of DFT and TD&#8208;DFT computations. Both singlet and triplet excited states have been characterized, allowing the identification of the active species involved in photoactivation pathways leading to the controlled detachment of the hydride ligand. Also the viable two&#8208;photon activation at the ideal phototherapeutic window has been investigated.

         <title>Hollow Carbon Sphere&#8211;Modified Graphitic Carbon Nitride for Efficient Photocatalytic H2 Production</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hollow carbon sphere&#8211;implanted graphitic carbon nitride nanosheet photocatalysts were prepared by a bottom&#8208;up method. The photocatalysts promote photoelectron transfer and suppress charge recombination through special interface coupling and hollow carbon spheres as an electron acceptor, leading to remarkably improved photocatalytic efficiency. This work thus provides an efficient pathway for the design of efficient and low&#8208;cost cocatalysts for photocatalysis.

         <title>Perylene Bisimide&#8208;Cored Supramolecular Coordination Complexes: Interplay between Ensembles, Excited State Processes, and Aggregation Behaviors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Coordination&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly was employed to manipulate inter&#8208;/intra&#8208;molecular interaction of PBI&#8208;based complexes (trigonal prism and dicycle). Two complexes exhibit distinct different properties on excited state process and aggregation behaviour due to their geometrical arrangements. Trigonal prism to dicycle transformation could be tracked by fluorescence change. (Note: ISC and SB&#8208;CS in graphic are intersystem crossing and symmetry&#8208;breaking charge separation, respectively.)







Abstract
Manipulating the optical properties of fluorescent species is challenging owing to complicated and tedious synthetic works. Herein, the photophysical properties of perylene bisimide (PBI) were effectively tuned by varying the geometrical arrangement of PBI moieties within supramolecular coordination complexes (SCCs), where a PBI&#8208;based dicycle (2) and a trigonal prism (3) were generated via using a typical 90&#176; Pt(II) reagent, cis&#8208;(PEt3)2Pt(OTf)2&#8208;based coordination&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly approach. The ligand, an ortho&#8208;tetrapyridiyl&#8208;PBI (1), exhibits a moderate fluorescence quantum yield (&#8764;13&#8201;%) and efficient inter&#8208;system crossing (ISC). 2, however, is much more emissive with a fluorescence quantum yield of &#8764;41&#8201;%, and the relevant ISC process is significantly hindered. The fluorescence quantum yield of 3 is merely &#8764;6&#8201;% due to the observed symmetry&#8208;breaking charge separation (SB&#8208;CS), which turns to triplet state upon charge recombination. Interestingly, 3 could be fully transformed into 2 by simply adding a suitable amount of a 90&#176; Pt(II)&#8208;based neutral triangle. Moreover, 2 tends to form discrete dimers both in crystal and solution states, but 3 does not show the property. Therefore, controlling geometrical arrangement of fluorophores through coordination&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly could be taken as another effective way to tune their excited state relaxation pathways and construct high&#8208;performance optical molecular materials, which generally have to be prepared via organic synthesis.

         <title>Halogen Bonding Propensity in Solution: Direct Observation and Computational Prediction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Strongly activated halogen bond donors give rise to observable bound and unbound states in Raman spectroscopy when paired with good halogen bond acceptors. The two strongest halogen bond donors examined have almost identical electrostatic potentials, but differ vastly in theoretical binding affinity and experimental halogen bonding strength. The energy terms giving rise to this behavior are elucidated by energy decomposition analysis.







Abstract
Halogen&#8208;bonded complexes are often designed by consideration of electrostatic potential (ESP) predictions. ESP predictions do not capture the myriad variables associated with halogen bond (XB) donors and acceptors; thus, binding interaction cannot be quantitatively predicted. Here, a discrepancy between predictions based on ESP energy difference (&#916;Vs) and computed gas phase binding energy (&#916;Ebind) motivated the experimental determination of the relative strength of halogen bonding interactions in solution by Raman spectroscopic observation of complexes formed from interacting five iodobenzene&#8208;derived XB donors and four pyridine XB acceptors. Evaluation of &#916;Ebind coupled with absolutely&#8208;localized molecular orbital energy decomposition analysis (ALMO&#8208;EDA) deconvolutes halogen bonding energy contributions and reveals a prominent role for charge transfer (CT) interactions. Raman spectra reveal &#916;Ebind accurately predicts stronger interactions within iodopentafluorobenzene (IPFB) complexes than with 1&#8208;iodo&#8208;3,5&#8208;dinitrobenzene (IDNB) complexes even though IPFB has similar electrostatics to IDNB and contains a smaller &#963;&#8208;hole.

         <title>Facile Conversion of Molecularly Complex (Hetero)aryl Carboxylic Acids into Alkynes for Accelerated SAR Exploration</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bringing molecularly complex (hetero)aryl carboxylic acids into the bioisostere world: A functional&#8208;group&#8208;tolerant and operationally simple decarbonylative alkynylation is reported that allows the synthesis of aryl alkynes from highly functionalized aryl and heteroaryl carboxylic acids. The reaction shows an unmatched substrate scope mainly thanks to its remarkably mild reaction conditions using a homogenous Pd/Cu bimetallic system. The utility of this protocol was showcased by the preparation of a triazolo analog of the commercial drug moclobemide.







Abstract
1,2,3&#8208;Triazoles are well&#8208;established bioisosteres for amides, often installed as a result of structure&#8722;activity&#8208;relationship (SAR) exploration. A straightforward approach to assess the effect of the replacement of an amide by a triazole would start from the carboxylic acid and the amine used for the formation of a given amide and convert them into the corresponding alkyne and azide for cyclization by copper&#8208;catalyzed alkyne&#8722;azide cycloaddition (CuAAC). Herein, we report a functional&#8208;group&#8208;tolerant and operationally simple decarbonylative alkynylation that allows the conversion of complex (hetero)aryl carboxylic acids into alkynes. Furthermore, the utility of this method was demonstrated in the preparation of a triazolo analog of the commercial drug moclobemide. Lastly, mechanistic investigations using labeled carboxylic acid derivatives clearly show the decarbonylative nature of this transformation.

         <title>Impact of Surface Defects on LaNiO3 Perovskite Electrocatalysts for the Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The impact of defect generation by thermal reduction on the structure and electrocatalytic performance of LaNiO3 has been examined in a combined experimental and theoretical approach. Surface defects, predominantly surface oxygen vacancies, promote oxygen evolution over LaNiO3 resulting in a significantly lower overpotential (380&#8197;mV) for a current density of 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, faster kinetics (70.8&#8197;mV&#8201;dec&#8722;1 Tafel slope) and superior stability in alkaline electrolytes to conventionally prepared LaNiO3.

         <title>Formation and Structure of Hydrolytic Methylaluminoxane Activators</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Modelling of kinetics using density functional theory, combined with numerical simulation, reveals that methylaluminoxane activators are sheets formed by assembly of linear oligomers, wherein the statistics and mechanism of aggregation favor formation of even&#8208;numbered sheets.







Abstract
Methylaluminoxane (MAO) activators have sheet structures which form ion&#8208;pairs on reaction of neutral donors such as octamethyltrisiloxane (OMTS). The ion&#8208;pairs can be detected by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI&#8208;MS) in polar media. The growth of these reactive precursors during hydrolysis of Me3Al can be monitored using ESI&#8208;MS. Density functional theory, combined with numerical simulation of growth, indicates that this process involves rapid formation of low MW oligomers, followed by assembly of these species into low MW sheets. These can grow through further addition of low MW oligomers or by fusion into larger sheets. The mechanism of these growth processes leads to the prediction that even&#8208;numbered sheets should be favored, and this surprising result is confirmed by ESI&#8208;MS monitoring experiments of both activator growth and MAO aging.

The synthesis of mixed&#8208;ligand chromium(III) complexes, [CrIII2L(O2CR)]3+, where L represents a macrocyclic binucleating hexaamine&#8208;dithiophenolato ligand and R=Me or Ph, has been achieved.

Abstract
The synthesis, structure, magnetic, and photophysical properties of two dinuclear, luminescent, mixed&#8208;ligand [CrIII2L(O2CR)]3+ complexes (R=CH3 (1), Ph (2)) of a 24&#8208;membered binucleating hexa&#8208;aza&#8208;dithiophenolate macrocycle (L)2&#8722; are presented. X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis reveals an edge&#8208;sharing bioctahedral N3Cr(&#956;&#8208;SR)2(&#956;1,3&#8208;O2CR)CrN3 core structure with &#956;1,3&#8208;bridging carboxylate groups. A ferromagnetic superexchange interaction between the electron spins of the Cr3+ ions leads to a high&#8208;spin (S=3) ground state. The coupling constants (J=+24.2(1)&#8197;cm&#8722;1 (1), +34.8(4)&#8197;cm&#8722;1 (2), H=&#8722;2JS1S2) are significantly larger than in related bis&#8208;&#956;&#8208;alkoxido&#8208;&#956;&#8208;carboxylato structures. DFT calculations performed on both complexes reproduce both the sign and strength of the exchange interactions found experimentally. Frozen methanol&#8208;dichloromethane 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 solutions of 1 and 2 luminesce at 750&#8197;nm when excited into the 4LMCT state on the 4A2 &#8594; 2T1 (&#957;2) bands (&#955;exc=405&#8197;nm). The absolute quantum yields (&#934;L) for 1 and 2 were found to be strongly temperature dependent. At 77&#8197;K in frozen MeOH/CH2Cl2 glasses, &#934;L=0.44&#177;0.02&#8201; (for 1), &#934;L=0.45&#177;0.02&#8201; (for 2).

         <title>Variable Luminescence and Chromaticity of Homoleptic Frameworks of the Lanthanides together with Pyridylpyrazolates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Homoleptic, 3D&#8208;coordination polymers of the formula  3  &#8734;  [Ln(3&#8208;PyPz)  3  ] and  3  &#8734;  [Ln(4&#8208;PyPz)  3  ], (3&#8208;PyPz)&#175;= 3&#8208;(3&#8208;pyridyl)pyrazolate anion, (4&#8208;PyPz)&#175;= 3&#8208;(4&#8208;pyridyl)pyrazolate anion, both C  8  H  6  N  3  &#8208;  , Ln = Sm, Eu, Gd, Tb, Dy, were obtained as highly luminescent frameworks by reactions of the lanthanide metals (Ln) with the aromatic heterocyclic amine ligands; 3&#8208;PyPzH and 4&#8208;PyPzH. The compounds form two isotypic series of 3D&#8208;coordination polymers and exhibit fair thermal stability up to 360 &#176;C. The luminescence properties of all ten compounds were determined in the solid&#8208;state, with an antenna effect through ligand&#8211;metal energy transfer leading to high efficiency of the luminescence displayed by good quantum yields up to 74%. The emission is mainly based on ion specific lanthanide&#8208;dependent intra 4f&#8211;4f&#8208;transitions for Tb  3+  : green, Dy  3+  : yellow, Sm  3+  : orange&#8208;red, Eu  3+  : red. For the Gd  3+  containing compounds, yellow emission of ligand triplet&#8208;based phosphorescence is observed at room temperature and 77 K. Co&#8208;doping of the Gd&#8208;containing frameworks with Eu  3+  and Tb  3+  allow further shifting of the chromaticity towards white light emission.</dc:description>

         <title>Dehydrogenative Double C&#8212;H Bond Activation in a Germylene&#8208;Rhodium Complex</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Transition metal tetrylene complexes offer great opportunities for molecular cooperation due to the ambiphilic character of the group 14 element. Here we focus on the coordination of germylene [(Ar Mes2 ) 2 Ge:] (Ar Mes = C 6 H 3 &#8208;2,6&#8208;(C 6 H 2 &#8208;2,4,6&#8208;Me 3 ) 2 ) to [RhCl(COD)] 2 (COD = 1,5&#8208;cyclooctadiene), which yields a neutral germyl complex in which the rhodium center exhibits both &#951; 6 &#8208; and &#951; 2 &#8208;coordination to two mesityl rings in an unusual pincer&#8208;type structure. Chloride abstraction from this species triggers a singular dehydrogenative double C&#8212;H bond activation across the Ge/Rh motif. We have isolated and fully characterized three rhodium&#8208;germyl species associated to three C&#8212;H cleavage events along this process. The reaction mechanism has been further investigated by computational means, supporting the key cooperative action of rhodium and germanium centers.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Herein, we present a novel intermolecular radical addition/cyclization and Se&#8208;group transfer reaction of terminal alkynes and unsaturated alkyl selenide. The present strategy offers a straightforward, and facile approach for the synthesis of valuable Se&#8208;containing cyclopentenes. The remarkable features of this strategy include easily accessible starting materials, metal&#8208;free and peroxide&#8208;free conditions, high atom economy, simple operation and broad substrate scope. More importantly, the reaction is easy to scale&#8208;up and can be extended to the construction of six&#8208;membered carbon ring.</dc:description>

         <title>Crystal Structure Dependent Dissolution of Non&#8208;Cubic Au Crystallites in Aqua Regia</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aqua regia readily dissolves the fcc tips of the Au bipyramidal crystallites and the core consisting of tetragonal and orthorhombic lattices, undergoes transformation to produce increased proportions of tetragonal lattices, before eventually giving up in dissolution. The study not only showcases the reactivity patterns associated with different Au lattices but also provides an insight into the lattice distribution within the crystallite.







Abstract
Properties of metal crystallites are governed by their morphologies and inherent crystal structures. In this work, bipyramidal Au microcrystallites hosting non&#8208;cubic lattices, body&#8208;centered orthorhombic and tetragonal (together termed as bc(o,t)), are investigated for their stability in aqua regia. Specifically, microcrystallites comprising 92&#8201;% of bc(o,t) have been subjected to aqua regia of different concentrations and the changes in morphology and lattice phases have been monitored using scanning electron microscopy and X&#8208;ray diffraction techniques. The dissolution process was found to be crystal structure dependent and begin at the bipyramidal tips enriched with fcc lattice while retaining the bc(o,t) rich body. Interestingly, with increasing the reaction times, the remaining core was found to be highly reluctant to dissolution and instead, transformed to tetragonal lattices which with increasing treatment, exhibited lattice parameters closer to that of fcc. The study reveals the presence of a bc(o,t)&#8208;fcc core&#8208;shell structure with the tips enriched with fcc.

         <title>Photo&#8208;Induced Ruthenium&#8208;Catalyzed C&#8722;H Benzylations and Allylations at Room Temperature</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photo&#8208;induced C&#8722;H benzylation under ruthernium catalysis enabled exceedingly mild syntheses of diarylmethane compounds. The robustness of this approach was demonstrated by an ample scope, including photo C&#8722;H allylations and reactions on water.







Abstract
The ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed synthesis of diarylmethane compounds was realized under exceedingly mild photoredox conditions without the use of exogenous photocatalysts. The versatility and robustness of the ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H benzylation was reflected by an ample scope, including multifold C&#8722;H functionalizations, as well as transformable pyrazoles, imidates and sensitive nucleosides. Mechanistic studies were indicative of a photoactive cyclometalated ruthenium complex, which also enabled versatile C&#8722;H allylations.

         <title>Plasmon Coupling Enhanced Micro&#8208;spectroscopy and Imaging for Sensitive Discrimination of Membrane Domains of a Single Cell</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Different cell&#160;membrane domains play different roles&#160;in many&#160;cell processes, and the discrimination of these domains is of considerable&#160;importance for the elucidation of cellular functions.&#160;However, the strategies&#160;available for distinguishing these cell membrane&#160;domains&#160;are limited.&#160;We propose a novel technique called plasmon coupling enhanced micro&#8208;spectroscopy and imaging&#160;to discriminate basal and lateral membrane domains of a single cell.&#160;This technology combines&#160;the application of an&#160;additional plasmonic silver film for&#160;surface plasmon&#160;(SP) excitation to selectively excite and enhance&#160;the basal membranes in the near&#8208;field with directional enhanced microscopic imaging and spectroscopy. The SP and critical evanescent fields are induced upon excitation&#160;through a&#160;silver&#8208;coated semitransparent coverslip at the SPR and critical&#160;angles, respectively. The basal and lateral membrane domains&#160;located within the SP and critical evanescent fields can be selectively excited and distinguished&#160;by adjusting the incident angle of laser&#160;irradiation. Moreover, the brighter images and more intense&#160;spectra of membrane&#8208;targeting fluorescence&#8208;Raman probes under directional excitation than in conventional EPI mode&#160;allow clear identification of the membrane domains.</dc:description>

         <title>Emerging Yttrium Phosphides with Tetrahedron Phosphorus and Superconductivity under High Pressures</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal phosphides have triggered growing interest for their exotic structures and striking properties. Hence, within advanced structure search and first&#8208;principle calculations, we identify several unprecedented Y&#8208;P compounds (e.g., Y  3  P, Y  2  P, Y  3  P  2  , Y  2  P  3  , YP  2  , and YP  3  ) under compression. Interestingly, as phosphorus content increases, P atoms exhibit diverse behaviors corresponding to standalone anion, dumbbell, zigzag chain, planar sheet, crossing chain&#8208;like network, buckled layer, three&#8208;dimensional framework, and wrinkled layer. Particularly,  Fd  &#8208;3  m  YP  2  can be viewed as assemblage of diamond&#8208;like Y structure and rare vertex&#8208;sharing tetrahedral P4 units. Impressively, electron&#8208;phonon coupling (EPC) calculations elucidate that  Pm  &#8208;3  m  Y  3  P possesses the highest superconducting critical temperature  T  c  of 10.2 K among binary transition metal phosphides. Remarkably, the EPC of  Pm  &#8208;3  m  Y  3  P mainly arises from the contribution of low&#8208;frequency soft phonon modes, whereas mid&#8208;frequency phonon modes of  Fd  &#8208;3  m  YP  2  dominate.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Metal phosphides have triggered growing interest for their exotic structures and striking properties. Hence, within advanced structure search and first-principle calculations, we identify several unprecedented Y-P compounds (e.g., Y  3  P, Y  2  P, Y  3  P  2  , Y  2  P  3  , YP  2  , and YP  3  ) under compression. Interestingly, as phosphorus content increases, P atoms exhibit diverse behaviors corresponding to standalone anion, dumbbell, zigzag chain, planar sheet, crossing chain-like network, buckled layer, three-dimensional framework, and wrinkled layer. Particularly,  Fd  -3  m  YP  2  can be viewed as assemblage of diamond-like Y structure and rare vertex-sharing tetrahedral P4 units. Impressively, electron-phonon coupling (EPC) calculations elucidate that  Pm  -3  m  Y  3  P possesses the highest superconducting critical temperature  T  c  of 10.2 K among binary transition metal phosphides. Remarkably, the EPC of  Pm  -3  m  Y  3  P mainly arises from the contribution of low-frequency soft phonon modes, whereas mid-frequency phonon modes of  Fd  -3  m  YP  2  dominate. These results strengthen knowledge of metal phosphides and pave a way for seeking superconductive transition metal phosphides.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Insertion Chemistry of Lutetacyclopropene toward Unsaturated C&#8722;O/C&#8722;N Bonds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Although the reaction chemistry of transition metallacyclopropenes has been well&#8208;established in the last decades, the reactivity of rare&#8208;earth metallacyclopropenes remains elusive. Herein, we report the reaction of lutetacyclopropene  1  toward a series of unsaturated molecules. The reaction of  1  with one equiv of PhCOMe, Ar  1  CHO (Ar  1  = 2,6&#8208;Me  2  C  6  H  3  ), W(CO)  6  , and PhCH=NPh provided oxalutetacyclopentenes, metallacyclic lutetoxycarbene,  and azalutetacyclopentene  via 1,2&#8208;insertion of C=O, C&#8801;O, or C=N bonds into Lu&#8722;C  sp2  bond, respectively. However, the reaction between  1  and Ar  2  N=C=NAr  2  (Ar  2  = 4&#8208;MeC  6  H  4  ) gave an acyclic lutetium complex with a  diamidinate  ligand by the coupling of one molecule of  1  with two carbodiimides, irrespective of the amount of carbodiimide employed. More interestingly, when  1  was treated with two equiv of Ar  1  CHO, the reductive coupling of two C=O bonds was discovered to give a  lutetium pinacolate complex along with the release of tolan.&#160;  Remarkably, the reactivity of  1  is significantly different from that of scandacyclopropenes; these metallacycles derived from  1  all represent the first cases in rare&#8208;earth organometallic chemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>Fast detection of entacapone by a lanthanide&#8208;organic framework with rhombic channels</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Entacapone (ENT) is a powerful catechol&#8208;  O  &#8208;methyl transferase inhibitor that is used for the diagnosis and treatment of Parkinson&#8217;s syndrome, but the amount used must be well controlled to avoid overtreatment and side effect. Fast and selective detection of ENT needs well&#8208;matched energy levels and well&#8208;designed sensor&#8208;ENT interaction which is highly challenging. In this work, a water stable europium&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic framework (  Eu&#8208;TDA  ) was synthesized to detect ENT by luminescence with excellent reusability and selectivity in the presence of main coexisting and interference species of plasma with a limit of detection of 5.01 &#956;M. The experimental results showed that the luminescence of  Eu&#8208;TDA  can be effectively quenched by ENT via well&#8208;designed photoinduced electron transfer mechanism and internal filtration effect mechanism in the system.</dc:description>

         <title>Competing Reaction Pathways in Heterogeneously Catalysed Hydrogenation of Allyl Cyanide: The Chemical Nature of Surface Species</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We present a mechanistic study on the formation of an active ligand layer over Pd(111), turning the catalytic surface highly active and selective in partial hydrogenation of an &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated aldehyde acrolein. Specifically, we investigate the chemical composition of a ligand layer consisting of allyl cyanide deposited on Pd(111) and its dynamic changes under the hydrogenation conditions. On pristine surface, allyl cyanide largely retains its chemical structure and forms a layer of molecular species with the CN bond oriented nearly parallel to the underlying metal. In the presence of hydrogen, the chemical composition of allyl cyanide strongly changes. At 100 K, allyl cyanide transfers to unsaturated imine species, containing the C=C and C=N double bonds. At increasing temperatures, these species undergo two competing reaction pathways. First, the C=C bond become hydrogenated and the stable N&#8208;butylimine species are produced. In the competing pathway, the unsaturated imine reacts with hydrogen to fully hydrogenate the imine group and produce butylamine. The latter species are unstable under the hydrogenation reaction conditions and desorb from the surface, while the N&#8208;butylimine adsorbates formed in the first reaction pathway remain adsorbed and act as an active ligand layer in selective hydrogenation of acrolein.</dc:description>

         <title>The Chemical Bond: When Atom Size Instead of Electronegativity Difference Determines Trend in Bond Strength</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We have quantum chemically analyzed element&#8211;element bonds of archetypal HnX&#8211;YHn&#160;molecules (X, Y = C, N, O, F, Si, P, S, Cl, Br, I), using density functional theory. One purpose is to obtain a set of consistent homolytic bond dissociation energies (BDE) for establishing accurate trends across the periodic table. The main objective is to elucidate the underlying physical factors behind these chemical bonding trends. On one hand, we confirm that, along a period (e.g., from C&#8211;C to C&#8211;F), bonds strengthen because the electronegativity difference across the bond increases. But, down a period, our findings constitute a paradigm shift. From C&#8211;F to C&#8211;I, for example, bonds do become weaker, however, not because of the decreasing electro&#173;negativity difference.&#160;Instead, we show that the effective atom size is the causal factor behind bond weakening in this series, and behind the weakening in orbital interactions at the equilibrium distance.&#160;We discuss the actual bonding mechanism and the importance of analyzing this mechanism as a function of the bond distance.</dc:description>

         <title>NMR Crystallography Enhanced by Quantum Chemical Calculations and Liquid State NMR for the Investigation of Se NHC Adducts.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>N

heterocyclic carbene ligands (NHC) are widely utilized in catalysis and material science. They are characterized by their steric and electronic properties. Steric properties are usually quantified on the basis of their static structure, which can be determined by X&#8208;ray diffraction. The electronic properties are estimated in the liquid state; for example, via the 77Se liquid state NMR of Se&#8208;NHC adducts. We demonstrate that 77Se NMR crystallography can contribute to the characterization of the structural and electronic properties of NHC in solid and liquid states. Selected Se&#8208;NHC adducts are investigated via 77Se solid state NMR and X&#8208;ray crystallography, supported by quantum chemical calculations. This investigation reveals a correlation between the molecular structure of adducts and NMR parameters, including not only isotropic chemical shifts but also the other chemical shift tensor components. Afterwards, the liquid state 77Se NMR data is presented and interpreted in terms of the quantum chemistry modelling. The discrepancy between the structural and electronic properties, and in particular the &#960;&#8208;accepting abilities of adducts in the solid and liquid states is discussed. Finally, the 13C isotropic chemical shift from the liquid state NMR and the 13C tensor components are also discussed, and compared with their 77Se counterparts. 77Se NMR crystallography can deliver valuable information about NHC ligands, and together with liquid state 77Se NMR can provide an in&#8208;depth outlook on the properties of NHC ligands.</dc:description>

         <title>Thiophene&#8208;fused 1,4&#8208;Diazapentalene: A Stable C=N&#8208;Containing &#960;&#8208;Conjugated System with Restored Antiaromaticity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A thiophene&#8208;fused 1,4&#8208;diazapentalene (TAP) was rationally designed and synthesized as a C=N&#8208;containing 4n&#960;&#8208;electron systems that exhibits restored antiaromaticity impaired by the doping with C=N bonds. X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis and quantum chemical calculations revealed that the annulation of thiophene rings with the 1,4&#8208;diazapentalene moiety resulted in the much higher antiaromaticity than the pristine 1,4&#8208;diazapentalene. These effects can be ascribed to the reduced bond alternation of the 8&#8208;membered&#8208;ring&#8208;periphery caused by the stabilization of the less&#8208;stable bond&#8208;shifted resonance structure upon increasing the degree of substitution of imine moieties. Consequently, TAP underwent facile hydrogenation even under mild conditions because of its pronounced antiaromaticity and high aromaticity of the corresponding hydrogenated product H  2  &#8208;TAP. In addition, the electrophilic C=N moieties in TAP led to the formation of a dense &#960;&#8208;stacked structure. These results highlight the effect of partial replacement of C=C bonds with C=N bonds in antiaromatic &#960;&#8208;electron systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Iodine(I) and Silver(I) Complexes of Benzoimidazole and Pyridylcarbazole Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthesis of iodine(I) complexes with either benzoimidazole or carbazole&#8208;derived  sp  2  N  &#8208;containing Lewis bases is described, as well as their corresponding silver(I) complexes. The addition of elemental iodine to the linear two&#8208;coordinate Ag(I) complexes produces iodine(I) complexes with a three&#8208;center four&#8208;electron (3c&#8208;4e) [N &#8212; I &#8212; N]  +  bond. The  1  H and  1  H&#8208;  15  N HMBC NMR studies unambiguously confirm the formation of the complexes in all cases via the [N &#8212; Ag &#8212; N]  +  &#8594; [N &#8212; I &#8212; N]  +  cation exchange, with the  15  N NMR chemical shift change between 94 to 111 ppm when compared to the free ligand. The single crystal X&#8208;ray crystallographic studies on four I  +  complexes revealed highly symmetrical [N &#8212; I &#8212; N]  +  bonds with I &#8212; N bond distances of 2.21 &#8208; 2.26 &#197; and N &#8212; I &#8212; N angles of 177 &#8208; 180 &#176; , whilst some of the corresponding Ag  +  complexes showed a clear deviation from linearity with N &#8212; Ag &#8212; N angles of ca. 150 &#176; and Ag &#8212; N bond distances of 2.09 &#8208; 2.18 &#197;.</dc:description>

         <title>Push&#8210;Pull Stiff&#8208;Stilbene: Proton&#8208;Gated Visible&#8208;Light Photoswitching and Acid&#8208;Catalyzed Isomerization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Donor&#8208;acceptor substituted stiff&#8208;stilbene is shown to undergo isomerization induced by visible light avoiding the need for harmful UV light. This visible&#8208;light photoswitching is inhibited by protonation of the dimethylamino&#8208;donor unit, disrupting the push&#8208;pull character and thus, gating of the photochromic properties is allowed by acid/base addition. Remarkably, the addition of a mild acid also triggers fast thermal back isomerization, which is unprecedented for stiff&#8208;stilbene photoswitches usually having a very high energy barrier for this process. These combined features offer unique orthogonal control over switching behavior by light and protonation, which is investigated in detail by  1  H NMR and UV/Vis spectroscopy. In addition, TD&#8208;DFT calculations are used to gain further insight into the absorption properties. Our results will help elevating the level of control over dynamic behavior in stiff&#8208;stilbene applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Luminescence Chiral Exciplexes with Sky&#8208;Blue and Green Circularly Polarized &#8208;Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorecence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Luminescent exciplexes based on a chiral electron donor molecule and achiral acceptor ones are reported as a new approach to design circularly polarized (CP) and thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters.&#160; This innovative strategy results in rather high CP luminescence values with g lum up to 7 &#180; 10 &#8208;3 , almost one order of magnitude higher in comparison to the CPL signal recorded for the chiral donor alone ( g lum ~ 8 &#180; 10 &#8208;4 ). This increase occurs concomitantly to a CPL sign inversion, as a result of the strong charge&#8208;transfer emission character, as experimentally and theoretically rationalized using a covalent chiral Donor&#8208;Acceptor model. Interestingly, blue, green&#8208;yellow and red chiral luminescent exciplexes can be obtained by playing with the electron accepting character of the achiral unit while keeping the same chiral donor unit. These results bring new (inter)molecular guidelines to obtain simply and efficiently multi&#8208;color CP&#8208;TADF emitters.</dc:description>

         <title>Metal&#8722;organic frameworks with novel catenane&#8208;like interlocking: metal&#8208;determined photoresponse and uranyl sensing</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The assembly of two tripyridinium&#8208;tricarboxylate ligands and different metal ions leads to seven isostructural MOFs, which show novel 2D&#174;2D supramolecular entanglement featuring catenane&#8208;like interlocking of tricyclic cages. The MOFs show tripyridinium&#8208;afforded and metal&#8208;modulated photoresponsive properties. The MOFs with d  10  metal centers (  1&#8208;Cd, 1&#8208;Zn, 2&#8208;Cd, 2&#8208;Zn)  show fast and reversible photochromism and concomitant fluorescence quenching,  1&#8208;Ni  displays slower photochromism but does not fluoresce, and  1&#8208;Co  and  2&#8208;Co  are neither photochromic nor fluorescent. We show that the network entanglement dictates donor&#8208;acceptor close contacts, which enable fluorescence originated from interligand charge transfer. The contacts also allow photoinduced electron transfer, which underlies photochromism and concomitant fluorescence response. The metal dependence in fluorescence and photochromism can be related to energy transfer through metal&#8208;centered  d&#8208;d  transitions. In addition,  1&#8208;Cd  is demonstrated to be a potential fluorescence sensor for sensitive and selective detection of UO  2  2+  in water</dc:description>
