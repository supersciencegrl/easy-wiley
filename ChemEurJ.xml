         <title>Carbonylative Self&#8208;Coupling of Aryl Boronic Acids Using a Confined Pd Catalyst within Melamine Dendron and Fibrous Nano&#8208;Silica: A CO Surrogate Approach</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Development of heterogeneous catalysts with tunable activity and selectivity has posed a persistent challenge. In this study, we addressed this challenge by fabricating a hybrid environment is fabricated by combining mesoporous silica and N&#8208;rich melamine dendron by covalent grafting for controllable growth and encapsulation of Pd NPs. This catalyst presented an excellent catalytic activity for the oxidative carbonylative self&#8208;coupling of aryl boronic acids to afford symmetric biaryl ketones using N&#8208;formyl saccharin as a sustainable solid CO source and Cu as a co&#8208;catalyst.</dc:description>

         <title>Impact of Catalyst Deuteration on the Reactivity of Chiral Phase&#8208;Transfer Organocatalysts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Site&#8208;specifically deuterated organocatalysts were prepared and found to show improved reactivity over the non&#8208;deuterated analogs. Two privileged C2&#8208;symmetric chiral binaphthyl&#8208;modified tetraalkylammonium salts were selected for this study. The stability of these phase&#8208;transfer catalysts was generally improved by site&#8208;specific deuteration, though the degree of improvement was structure&#8208;dependent. In particular, a large secondary kinetic isotope effect was observed for the tetradeuterated phase&#8208;transfer catalyst. The performance of these deuterated catalysts in the asymmetric catalytic alkylation of amino acid derivatives was better than that of non&#8208;deuterated analogs at low catalyst loadings. The results suggest that catalyst&#8208;deuteration is a promising strategy for enhancing the stability and performance of organocatalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>In&#8208;Situ Formation of CoP/Co3O4 Heterojunction for Efficient Overall Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrochemical water splitting is an environmentally friendly and effective energy storage method. However, it is still a huge challenge for preparing no&#8208;noble metal based&#8208;electrocatalysts which possess high activity and long&#8208;term durability to realize efficient water splitting. Here, we put forward a novel method of low&#8208;temperature phosphating to prepare CoP/Co3O4 heterojunction nanowires catalyst on titanium mesh (TM) substrate for oxygen evolution reaction (OER), hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), and overall water splitting. CoP/Co3O4@TM heterojunction showed an excellent catalytic performance and long&#8208;term durability in 1.0 M KOH electrolyte. The overpotential of CoP/Co3O4@TM heterojunction was only 257 mV at 20 mA cm&#8208;2 during the OER process, and it could work stably more than 40 h at 1.52 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (vs. RHE). During the HER process, the overpotential of CoP/Co3O4@TM heterojunction was only 107 mV at &#8208;10 mA cm&#8208;2. &#160;More importantly, when CoP/Co3O4@TM heterojunction were used as anodic and cathodic electrocatalysts, respectively, they displayed 10 mA cm&#8722;2 at 1.59 V. The Faradaic efficiencies of OER and HER were 98.4% and 99.4%, respectively. It was more excellent than the Ru/Ir&#8208;based noble metal electrocatalysts and other non&#8208;noble metal electrocatalysts which have been reported for overall water splitting.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>We report the study of a fluorescent indolin&#8208;3&#8208;one derivative that, as opposed to its previously described congeners, selectively undergoes photoactivated ring&#8208;opening in apolar solvents. The excited state involved in this photoisomerization was partially deactivated by the formation of singlet oxygen.&#160;Cell studies revealed lipid droplet accumulation and efficient light&#8208;induced cytotoxicity.</dc:description>

         <title>Design, Synthesis and Evaluation of Biological Activity of Ferrocene&#8208;Ispinesib Hybrids &#8208; Impact of a Ferrocenyl Group on the Antiproliferative and KSP Inhibitory Activity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>With the aim to combine more than one biologically&#8208;active component in a single molecule, derivatives of ispinesib and its (S) analogue were prepared that featured ferrocenyl moieties or bulky organic substituents. Inspired by the strong kinesin spindle protein (KSP) inhibitory activity of ispinesib, the compounds were investigated for their antiproliferative activity. Among these compounds, several derivatives demonstrated significantly higher antiproliferative activity than ispinesib with nanomolar IC50&#160;values against cell lines. Further evaluation indicated that the antiproliferative activity is not directly correlated with their KSP inhibitory activity while docking suggested that several of the derivatives may bind in a manner similar to ispinesib. In order to investigate the mode of action further, cell cycle analysis and reactive oxygen species formation were investigated. The improved antiproliferative activity of the most active compounds may be assigned to synergic effect of various factors such as KPS inhibitory activity due to ispinesibe&#8208;core and ability to generate ROS and induce mitotic arrest.</dc:description>

         <title>Modified Peptide Molecules As Potential Modulators of Shelterin Protein Functions; TRF1</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this work, we present studies on relatively new and still not well&#8208;explored potential anticancer targets which are shelterin proteins, in particular the TRF1 protein can be blocked by in silico designed "peptidomimetic" molecules. TRF1 interacts directly with the TIN2 protein, and this protein&#8208;protein interaction is crucial for the proper functioning of telomere, which could be blocked by our novel modified peptide molecules. Our chemotherapeutic approach is based on assumption that modulation of TRF1&#8208;TIN2 interaction may be more harmful for cancer cells as cancer telomeres are more fragile than in normal cells. We have shown in vitro within SPR experiments that our modified peptide PEP1 molecule interacts with TRF1, presumably at the site originally occupied by the TIN2 protein. Disturbance of the shelterin complex by studied molecule may not in short term lead to cytotoxic effects, however blocking TRF1&#8208;TIN2 resulted in cellular senescence in cellular breast cancer lines used as a cancer model. Thus, our compounds appeared useful as starting model compounds for precise blockage of TRF proteins.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The present work reports a DFT&#8208;based mechanistic investigation of aryl C&#8208;O bond activation in anisole catalysed by a Rh&#8208;Al pincer&#8208;type complex at room temperature. The study is extended to analogues Rh&#8208;E complexes based on group 13 elements (E=B/Ga). Our results show a preference for the heterolytic cleavage pathway over oxidative addition in the C&#8208;O bond activation. The calculated barriers range from 16 to 36 kcal/mol, following the order: E=Al &lt; E=Ga &lt; E=B. We observed a strong correlation between the activation barriers and the local electric field (LEF) at the Rh metal centre for the studied Rh&#8208;E complexes. Additionally, we examined the ability of Oriented External Electric Fields (OEEF) to lower the reaction barrier by applying the OEEF along the direction of electron reorganization, i.e., &#8220;the reaction axis&#8221;. Our results demonstrate the significant effect of applied OEEF on the aryl C&#8208;O bond activation in Rh&#8208;E systems. Furthermore, we showcase the effect of OEEF on the C&#8208;O bond activation using modified Rh&#8208;E (E=B, Al, or Ga) complexes, where electronic structure modifications enable a more efficient barrier control by the OEEF. Notably, applying a moderate field strength reduces the high reaction barrier for the Rh&#8208;B system by ~13 kcal/mol.</dc:description>

         <title>A Doubly Dissipative System Driven by Chemical and Radiative Stimuli</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The operation of a dissipative network composed of two or three different crown&#8208;ether receptors and an alkali metal cation can be temporally driven by the use (combined or not) of two orthogonal stimuli of different nature. More specifically, irradiation with light at a proper wavelength and/or addition of an activated carboxylic acid, are used to modulate the binding capability of the above crown&#8208;ethers towards the metal ion, allowing to control over time the occupancy of the metal cation in the crown&#8208;ether moiety of a given ligand. Thus, application of either or both of the stimuli to an initially equilibrated system, where the metal cation is distributed among the crown&#8208;ether receptors depending on the different affinities, causes a programmable change in the receptor occupancies. Consequently, the system is induced to evolve to one or more out&#8208;of&#8208;equilibrium states with different distributions of the metal cation among the different receptors. When the fuel is exhausted or/and the irradiation interrupted, the system reversibly and autonomously goes back to the initial equilibrium state. Such results may contribute to the achievement of new dissipative systems that, taking advantage of multiple and orthogonal stimuli, are featured with more sophisticated operating mechanisms and time programmability.</dc:description>

         <title>Cu2P7&#8208;CoP Heterostructure Nanosheets Enable High&#8208;Performance of 5&#8208;Hydroxymethylfurfural Electrooxidation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cu2P7&#8208;CoP heterostructure nanosheets were designed as the electrocatalyst for conversion of 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural into 2, 5&#8208;furanedioic acid, achieving superior electrooxidation performance.







Abstract
Electrooxidation of 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfural (HMF) into 2,5&#8208;furandicarboxylicacid (FDCA) has been regarded as a promising sustainable approach to achieve value&#8208;added chemicals. However, it is still impeded by the unsatisfactory performance of electrocatalysts. Here, Cu2P7&#8208;CoP heterostructure nanosheets were reported to enable powerful HMF electrooxidation. The Cu2P7&#8208;CoP heterostructure nanosheets were fabricated by microwave&#8208;assisted deep eutectic solvent (DES) approach, along with subsequent phosphiding. The Cu2P7&#8208;CoP heterostructure nanosheets enabled a superb 100&#8201;% HMF conversion at 1.43&#8197;V (vs. RHE) with 98.8&#8201;% FDCA yield and 98&#8201;% Faradaic efficiency (FE), demonstrating its promising application in HMF electrooxidation. X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis, open&#8208;circuit potential (OCP) approach and density functional theory (DFT) calculation uncovered that the electron transfer and redistribution between Cu2P7 and CoP improved the adsorption capacity of HMF and modulated the catalytic performance. This study not only offered a powerful electrocatalyst for HMF electrooxidation, but also provided a conceptually new strategy for the heterostructure catalyst design.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Free Electrocatalysts for the Selective 2&#8201;e&#8722; Oxygen Reduction Reaction: A Never&#8208;Ending Story?</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The exohedral functionalization of carbon nanomaterials with tailored O&#8208;containing groups appears as the long&#8208;sought solution for putting an end to a highly controversial matter within the scientific community: shedding light on the puzzling structure/reactivity relationship in metal&#8208;free electrocatalysts for the challenging 2e&#8722; oxygen reduction reaction.







Abstract
Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) electrosynthesis via the 2e&#8722; Oxygen Reduction Reaction (ORR) represents a highly challenging, environmentally friendly and cost&#8208;effective alternative to the current anthraquinone&#8208;based technology. Various lightweight element hetero&#8208;doped carbon nanostructures are promising and cheap metal&#8208;free electrocatalysts for H2O2 synthesis, particularly those containing O&#8208;functionalities. The exact role of O&#8208;containing functional groups as electroactive sites for the process remains debated if not highly controversial. Herein, we have reported on the covalent exohedral functionalization of the outer surface of extra&#8208;pure multi&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) with discrete O&#8208;functional groups as a unique approach to prepare selective electrocatalysts for the process. This kind of decoration has added fundamental tiles to the puzzling structure/reactivity relationship of O&#8208;containing carbon&#8208;based catalysts for ORR, clearing doubts on the controversial role of hydroxyl/phenol groups as key functionalities for the design of more performing 2e&#8722; ORR electrocatalysts.

         <title>Dipole&#8208;Transmissive 1,3&#8208;Dipolar Cycloadditions for the Rapid Construction of Polycyclic N&#8208;Heterocycles: Synthetic and Mechanistic Investigations</title>

         <dc:description>
Investigation into and formalisation of dipole&#8208;transmissive dipolar cycloaddition (DTDC) methodology is reported. By designing substrates bearing complementary azide and diazoalkane 1,3&#8208;dipoles, we were able to employ integrated experimental and theoretical studies to construct a series of polycyclic N&#8208;heterocycles and rationalise the mechanistic basis of the divergent reactivity observed.







Abstract
The investigation of distinctive dipole&#8208;transmissive dipolar cycloaddition (DTDC) methodology and the formalisation of this concept is reported. A DTDC procedure was able to be developed by taking advantage of the structural complementarity of azide and diazoalkane 1,3&#8208;dipoles. Intramolecular azide&#8208;alkene 1,3&#8208;DCs followed by spontaneous dipole transmission upon work&#8208;up furnished intermediate &#945;&#8208;diazoisoindole and &#945;&#8208;diazoisoquinoline substrates bearing the key secondary diazoalkane 1,3&#8208;dipole. N&#8208;Derivatisation of the intermediate &#945;&#8208;diazoisoindole and &#945;&#8208;diazoisoquinolines with a tethered secondary dipolarophile followed by a subsequent 1,3&#8208;DC allowed for rapid construction of a range of functionalised polycyclic N&#8208;heterocycles. Integrated experimental and theoretical studies established requirements for product formation and revealed the likely mechanistic basis of divergent reactivity observed.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Structural isomers of thienoindolizines have been synthesized in a one&#8208;pot, two&#8208;step procedure starting from easily accessible gem&#8208;difluoroalkene functionalized bromothiophenes. The synthesis strategy consists of base mediated nucleophilic substitution followed by Pd catalyzed intramolecular cyclization. Structural effects on the optical and electrochemical properties have been evaluated in selected product examples.

The developed method gives easy access to a range of thienoindolizine products containing thieno[3,2&#8208;g]&#8208;, thieno[3,4&#8208;g]&#8208; and thieno[2,3&#8208;g]indolizine core structures. The described synthesis strategy consists of a base mediated, transition metal free nucleophilic substitution of fluorine atoms by nitrogen containing heterocycles followed by a Pd catalyzed intramolecular cyclization. A series of 22 final product examples has been obtained with yields ranging from 29&#8201;% to 95&#8201;%. UV/Vis absorption, fluorescence spectroscopy, fluorescence lifetime measurements and cyclic voltammetry were carried out with selected final products to evaluate structural effects on photophysical and electrochemical properties. (TD)DFT and NICS calculations were performed to provide insight into the electronic properties of the four core molecular structures.

         <title>In Situ Generation of Magnesium&#8208; and Calcium&#8208;Based Grignard Reagents for Amide Synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Amides of magnesium are widely used reagents whereas the calcium congeners remained unappreciated for diverse reasons such as inertness of the metal and side reactions during Grignard&#8208;type applications. Intermediately prepared aryl&#8208; and alkylcalcium reagents, which are immediately consumed via metalation of amines (iGMM) or addition across imines (iGAM) circumvent many difficulties related to organocalcium chemistry.







Abstract
The alkaline&#8208;earth metals Mg and Ca are too inert for the direct metalation of primary and secondary amines. Consequently, activation prior to use is required. Alternatively, the Grignard reagents RMgX (R=alkyl, aryl, X=halide) can be applied in metalation of amines. However, such a straightforward procedure for the synthesis of alkylcalcium reagents is disadvantageous due to diverse side reactions, including Wurtz&#8208;type C&#8722;C coupling and ether degradation reactions. Therefore, suspensions of magnesium or calcium with amine can be treated in a smooth reaction with ethyl bromide in an ethereal solvent at room temperature. Intermediately formed RAeX (Ae=alkaline&#8208;earth metal, i.&#8201;e., Mg, Ca) either metalates amines yielding the corresponding amides in an in&#8197;situ Grignard metalation method (iGMM) or adds across C=N bonds of imines in an in&#8197;situ Grignard addition method (iGAM). The amides R&#8217;2N&#8208;AeX (Ae=Mg: Hauser bases) undergo Schlenk&#8208;type ligand exchange reactions yielding homoleptic Ae(NR&#8217;2)2 and potentially sparingly soluble AeX2.

         <title>Shape&#8208;Morphing Liquid&#8208;Crystal polymers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Shaping up: Liquid&#8208;crystal polymers are considered one of the most promising candidates for intelligent shape&#8208;morphing materials. In this review, we discuss recent developments in energy conversion, design strategies and the applications of shape&#8208;morphing liquid&#8208;crystal polymers.







Abstract
Liquid&#8208;crystal polymers are a type of representative material combining the order&#8208;disorder transition of liquid crystals and the superior properties of polymers. The phase transition from the liquid&#8208;crystal phase to the isotropic state of mesogens causes large, controllable, and reversible deformation of polymers; thus, liquid&#8208;crystal polymers have emerged as one of the most valuable candidates for shape&#8208;morphing materials. Therefore, this review will focus on the recent development of shape&#8208;morphing liquid&#8208;crystal polymers, including the modes of energy conversions, material design strategies and further applications. In the main, novel material design methods and a wide range of application of shape&#8208;morphing liquid&#8208;crystal polymers are discussed.

         <title>Synthesis of a Benzotrisazulene via Trioxobenzotrisazulene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A benzotrisazulene was synthesized on the basis of a truxene precursor by a series of Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura reactions via the intermediate trisoxo compound. The latter occurs in two forms (syn and anti), and the syn forms porous crystals.







Abstract
Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) containing odd&#8208;membered rings (such as pentagons or heptagons) are fascinating synthetic targets. A special case is the introduction of five&#8208; and seven&#8208;membered rings in form of an azulene unit. Azulene itself is an aromatic compounds known for its deep blue color, which is a result of its internal dipole moment. When azulene is embedded into PAHs it can change the optoelectronic properties of the PAH significantly. Herein, the synthesis and characterization of a PAH containing three azulene units is reported via reduction and elimination of its trioxo derivative.

         <title>Generation and Characterization of a Tetraradical Embedded in a Curved Cyclic Paraphenylene Unit</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A tetraradical embedded in a curved cycloparaphenylene skeleton was generated and characterized to examine the reactivity and magnetic interaction of the two diradical units in the bent molecular structure. Ferromagnetic interactions within the diradical unit and antiferromagnetic interaction between the diradical units lead to an open&#8208;shell singlet ground state for the tetraradical.







Abstract
Unique spin&#8211;spin (magnetic) interactions, ring&#8208;size effects on ground&#8208;state spin multiplicity, and in&#8208;plane aromaticity has been found in localized 1,3&#8208;diradicals embedded in curved benzene structures such as cycloparaphenylene (CPP). In this study, we characterized the magnetic interactions in a tetraradical consisting of two localized 1,3&#8208;diradical units connected by p&#8208;quaterphenyl within a curved CPP skeleton by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy and quantum chemical calculations. Persistent triplet species with zero&#8208;field splitting parameters similar to those of a triplet 1,3&#8208;diphenylcyclopentane&#8208;1,3&#8208;diyl diradical were observed by continuous wave (CW) or pulsed X&#8208;band EPR measurements. The quintet state derived from the ferromagnetic interaction between the two triplet diradical moieties was not detected at 20&#8197;K under glassy matrix conditions. At the B3LYP/6&#8208;31G(d) level of theory, the singlet state was lower in energy than the triplet and quintet states. These findings will aid in the development of open&#8208;shell species for material science application.

         <title>Micelle&#8208;Mediated Sonogashira Coupling for DNA&#8208;Encoded Library Synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A micelle&#8208;mediated Sonogashira reaction between on&#8208;DNA (hetero)aryl iodides or bromides and (hetero)aryl or aliphatic terminal alkynes. The methodology shows broad substrate scope in terms of both coupling partners and we demonstrate that the methodology is fully compatible with library synthesis protocols and DNA encoded and decoding. This methodology will enable the synthesis of alkynyl(hetero)biaryls or it could be used for subsequent derivatization to alternative products, such as the corresponding alkane or heterocycles.







Abstract
DNA&#8208;Encoded Libraries (DELs) are becoming widely established as a hit identification strategy for drug discovery campaigns. Their successful application relies on the availability and efficiency of the reactions that can be carried out on DNA. These reactions should proceed with high conversion to the desired product and have a broad substrate scope to synthesise chemically diverse and drug&#8208;like DELs. The Sonogashira coupling provides a unique means of coupling an sp&#8208;hybridized carbon centre to an aryl halide and methods to achieve this reaction on DNA are highly desirable. We report the application of our micellar technology for on&#8208;DNA chemistry to the Sonogashira reaction. This method gives highly efficient conversions for the coupling of (hetero)aromatic and aliphatic alkynes to (hetero)aryl iodides and bromides allowing the preparation of highly diverse DELs.

This methodology will enable the synthesis of alkynyl(hetero)biaryls or it could be used for subsequent derivatization to alternative products, such as the corresponding alkane or heterocycles.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DNA-Encoded Libraries (DELs) are becoming widely established as a hit identification strategy for drug discovery campaigns. Their successful application relies on the availability and efficiency of the reactions that can be carried out on DNA. These reactions should proceed with high conversion to the desired product and have a broad substrate scope to synthesise chemically diverse and drug-like DELs. The Sonogashira coupling provides a unique means of coupling an sp-hybridized carbon centre to an aryl halide and methods to achieve this reaction on DNA are highly desirable. We report the application of our micellar technology for on-DNA chemistry to the Sonogashira reaction. This method gives highly efficient conversions for the coupling of (hetero)aromatic and aliphatic alkynes to (hetero)aryl iodides and bromides allowing the preparation of highly diverse DELs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Highly Chemoselective Zn+2&#8208;Catalyzed Hydrosilylation of Alkynes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new dicationic Zn&#8208;based complex was synthesized and found to be a highly selective catalyst for the hydrosilylation of alkynes. Remarkably, this complex could selectively catalyze the hydrosilylation of alkynes even in the presence of alkenes.







Abstract
Hydrosilylation of C=C double and C&#8801;C triple bonds is one of the most widely used processes in organosilicon chemistry, mostly catalyzed by Pt&#8208;based complexes. Herein, the synthesis of a dicationic Zn+2&#8208;based complex with a tripodal tris(2&#8208;pyridylmethyl)amine (TPA) ligand is reported which was found to be a highly chemoselective catalyst for hydrosilylation reactions of alkynes. Mechanistic studies revealed that unlike typical Zn&#8208;catalyzed hydrosilylation reactions where the key step is the activation of the Si&#8722;H bond, this system catalyzes the hydrosilylation reaction through the activation of C&#8801;C triple bonds, which presumably is the reason for its high chemoselectivity. Remarkably, the hydrosilylation of alkynes could be performed in the presence of alkenes and other functional groups that remained intact in this reaction.

         <title>Synthesis and Conformational Analysis of Fullerene Torsion Balances for Assessing the Contribution of Dispersion and Anionic Character in Non&#8208;Covalent Arene&#8211;Fullerene Interactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By employing torsion balance molecules, we effectively measured the magnitude of the dispersion forces involved in the non&#8208;covalent interactions between substituted arene and fullerene. In addition, our findings indicate that solvation is of paramount importance in the anionic arene&#8211;fullerene interaction between thiophenolate and fullerene.







Abstract
We employ a molecular torsion balance displaying bifurcated conformational isomerism to quantitatively evaluate the non&#8208;covalent interactions between the fullerene surface and substituted arene moieties containing elements with high atomic numbers, as well as the thermodynamic processes involved in the folding equilibrium using nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The interaction between fullerene and haloaryl groups was stronger in cases where the introduced halogen had a higher atomic number, indicating that dispersion forces play a significant role in the interaction between fullerenes and 4&#8208;haloaryl groups. The dispersion term also significantly contributed to the interaction between fullerene and the 4&#8208;mercaptophenyl group. Moreover, the addition of an appropriate base to the 4&#8208;mercaptophenyl&#8208;appended torsion balance formed the corresponding thiophenolate anion, resulting in a large negative change in the folding free energy in CDCl3. Detailed analysis suggested that the observed attractive anionic arene&#8211;fullerene interactions predominantly originated from solvation effects.

         <title>Molecular Editing Enhances Oxidation Resistance of Mena&#8208;quinone&#8208;Targeting Antibiotics Lysocin E and WAP&#8208;8294A2</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lysocin E (1a) and WAP&#8208;8294A2 (2a) are peptidic natural products with 37&#8208; and 40&#8208;membered macrocycles, respectively. Compounds 1a and 2a have potent antibacterial activities against Gram&#8208;positive bacteria and share a unique mode of action. The electron&#8208;rich indole ring of d&#8208;Trp&#8208;10 of 1a and 2a interacts with the electron&#8208;deficient benzoquinone ring of menaquinone, which is a co&#8208;enzyme in the bacterial respiratory chain. Formation of the electron&#8208;donor&#8208;acceptor complex causes membrane disruption, leading to cell death. Despite the promising activities of 1a and 2a, the susceptibility of Trp&#8208;10 to oxidative degradation potentially deters the development of these compounds as antibacterial drugs. To address this issue, we replaced the indole ring with more oxidation&#8208;resistant aromatics having a similar shape and electron&#8208;rich character. Specifically, analogues with benzofuran (1b/2b), benzothiophene (1c/2c), and 1&#8208;naphthalene (1d/2d) rings were designed, and chemically prepared by full solid&#8208;phase total syntheses. Antibacterial assays of the six analogues revealed similar activities of 1d/2d and markedly reduced activities of 1b/2b and 1c/2c compared with 1a/2a. Equipotent 1d and 2d both showed high resistance to oxidation by peroxyl radicals. Hence, the present study demonstrates a new molecular editing strategy for conferring oxidation stability on natural products with pharmacologically useful functions.</dc:description>

         <title>Organophosphorus Extractants: A Critical Choice for Actinides/Lanthanides Separation in Nuclear Fuel Cycle</title>

Actinides/lanthanides separation: This concept mainly outlines the organophosphorus extractants that have been used in actinides/lanthanides separation and provides some new strategies to design the highly efficient extractants for building advanced separation processes for actinides.







Abstract
The separation of actinides from lanthanides in spent nuclear fuel reprocessing is a vital step of nuclear fuel cycle process. As one class of mature industrial extractants, the organophosphorus extractants have been widely used for the extraction and separation of actinides and lanthanides in spent fuel reprocessing due to their strong extraction ability and low&#8208;cost acquisition. In this concept, the application scope of tributyl phosphate (TBP), bis(2&#8208;ethylhexyl) phosphate (HDEHP), octyl(phenyl)&#8208;N,N&#8208;diisobutylcarbamoylmethylphosphine oxide (CMPO), trialkyl phosphine oxide (TRPO), and purified Cyanex 301 (bis(2,4,4&#8208;trimethylpentyl) dithiophosphinic acid, HA301) are introduced, and their extraction mechanism, as well as structure&#8208;function relationships for separation of actinides over lanthanides are also discussed. Furthermore, the design criteria, extraction properties and mechanism of several typical newly developed organophosphorus extractants (CMPO&#8208;modified calixarene/pillarene, phenanthroline&#8208;derived organophosphorus extractants, and phosphate&#8208;modified carborane) based on pre&#8208;organized skeletons are briefly reviewed. Finally, the important role played by those organophosphorus extractants is emphasized and potential applications in separation of actinides over lanthanides in future advanced nuclear fuel cycle are identified.

         <title>Oxymethylene Ether (OME) Fuel Catalyst Screening Using In Situ NMR Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 33, June 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An online NMR monitoring setup was implemented. The new setup was utilized for the monitoring and kinetic investigation of the OME fuel synthesis based on dimethoxymethane and trioxane. As catalysts a solid, Amberlyst15, and a liquid, trifluoromethanesulfonic acid, catalyst were used and compared based on activation energy and order in catalyst.







Abstract
Online NMR measurements are introduced in the current study as a new analytical setup for investigation of the oxymethylene dimethyl ether (OME) synthesis. For the validation of the setup, the newly established method is compared with state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art gas chromatographic analysis. Afterwards, the influence of different parameters, such as temperature, catalyst concentration and catalyst type on the OME fuel formation based on trioxane and dimethoxymethane is investigated. As catalysts, AmberlystTM 15 (A15) and trifluoromethanesulfonic acid (TfOH) are utilized. A kinetic model is applied to describe the reaction in more detail. Based on these results, the activation energy (A15: 48.0&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1 and TfOH: 72.3&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1) and the order in catalyst (A15: 1.1 and TfOH: 1.3) are calculated and discussed.

         <title>Photocatalytic Ketyl Radical Initiated Cketyl&#8722;Csp2/Csp3 Coupling on ZnIn2S4</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 33, June 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ketyl radical initiated intramolecular cyclization and intermolecular cross&#8208;coupling reactions can be achieved on a ZnIn2S4 photocatalyst. In this way industrially important chemicals like chromanes and tertiary alcohols can be produced.







Abstract
Visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven C&#8722;C bond formation utilizing ketyl radical (Cketyl) species has attracted increasing attention recently, as it provides a direct route for the synthesis of complex molecules. However, the most&#8208;developed homogeneous photocatalytic systems for the generation and utilization of ketyl radicals usually entail noble metal&#8208;based (e.&#8201;g., Ru and Ir) photosensitizers, which suffer from not only high cost but also potential degradation and hence pose challenges in product separation and purification. In contrast, readily accessible, inexpensive, and recyclable semiconductors represent a class of attractive and alternative photocatalysts but remain much less explored for photocatalytic ketyl radical initiated C&#8722;C bond formation. This work demonstrates that a wide range of industrially important chemicals, including substituted chromanes and tertiary alcohols, can be produced on ZnIn2S4 under visible light irradiation through intramolecular cyclization (Cketyl&#8722;Csp2) and intermolecular cross&#8208;coupling (Cketyl&#8722;Csp3) reactions, respectively, using ketyl radicals. A suite of experimental studies aided by computational investigation were carried out to shed light on the mechanistic insights of these two types of ketyl radical initiated C&#8722;C coupling reactions on ZnIn2S4.

         <title>Polarity and Dielectric Property Control Triggered by a Coordinated Solvent Molecule Exchange in Luminescent Mononuclear Aluminium(III) Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 33, June 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A first example of solvent vapour&#8208;induced polarity and dielectric property switching, including the formation of ferroelectric domains, has been demonstrated in luminescent mononuclear aluminium(III) complexes, which exhibit strong green emission in the solid state. In this system, the coordinated solvent substitution is the &#8220;trigger&#8221; for the corresponding structural rearrangements.







Abstract
The development of molecule&#8208;based multifunctional switchable materials that exhibit a switch of polarity and dielectric property are extremely limited. We have demonstrated solvent&#8208;vapour&#8208;induced reversible molecular rearrangements between nonpolar crystals [Al(sap)(acac)(sol)] (H2sap=2&#8208;salicylideneaminophenol, acac=acetylacetonate, sol=MeOH (1), EtOH (2)) and polar crystal [Al(sap)(acac)(DMSO)] (3). This crystal&#8208;to&#8208;crystal structural transformation was accompanied by a switch of second harmonic generation (SHG) and dielectric properties, including the formation of ferroelectric domains, thus reflecting the SHG&#8208;active polar Cc space group of 3. This is the first reported example of dielectric properties and polarity switching in luminescent mononuclear aluminium(III) complexes, which exhibit strong green emission in the solid state.

Supramolecular nanotubes in aqueous solutions show longitudinal interlock between the tubes and 3D crystalline order at concentrations as low as 6&#8197;wt%, across 10&#8197;nm thick layers of water.







Abstract
3D crystalline order with 1&#8197;nm resolution is observed in aqueous solutions of supramolecular nanotubes containing 94&#8201;% water, at concentrations as low as 6&#8197;wt%. 50 of star&#8208;like organic ions arrange into supramolecular rings which, in turn, stack on top of each other to form long hollow tubes with 15&#8197;nm outer diameter. Cryo&#8208;TEM and X&#8208;ray diffraction show that the parallel nanotubes arrange on a perfect hexagonal lattice. Unexpectedly, fiber diffraction on sheared solutions revealed numerous hkl Bragg reflections on several layer lines indicating longitudinal interlock between the tubes and 3D crystalline order with molecular&#8208;scale details transferred across 10&#8197;nm thick layers of water. The observed high 3D order is attributed to long&#8208;range attraction between like&#8208;charged tubes and amplified charge modulation by the extremely high intra&#8208;tube correlation length.

         <title>Minimizing Product Inhibition in DNA Self&#8208;Replication: Insights for Prebiotic Replication from the Role of the Enzyme in Lesion&#8208;Induced DNA Amplification
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 33, June 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ligase chain reaction lesion&#8208;induced DNA amplification exhibits rapid self&#8208;replication avoiding the product inhibition problem of most nucleic acid systems. We find the abasic lesion destabilizes the product duplex more than the intermediate complex narrowing their stability gap. The selective stabilization of the intermediate complex by the enzyme also contributes to gap reduction, providing a new framework for overcoming product inhibition.







Abstract
Self&#8208;replication of nucleic acids in the absence of enzymes represents an important and poorly understood step in the origin of life as such reported systems are strongly hindered by product inhibition. Studying one of the few successful examples of enzymatic DNA self&#8208;replication based on a simple ligation chain reaction, lesion&#8208;induced DNA amplification (LIDA), can shed light on how this fundamental process may have originally evolved. To identify the unknown factors that lead LIDA to overcome product inhibition we have employed isothermal titration calorimetry and global fitting of time&#8208;dependent ligation data to characterize the individual steps of the amplification process. We find that incorporating the abasic lesion into one of the four primers substantially decreases the stability difference between the product and intermediate complexes compared with complexes without the abasic group. In the presence of T4 DNA ligase this stability gap is further reduced by two orders of magnitude revealing that the ligase also helps overcome product inhibition. Kinetic simulations reveal that the intermediate complex stability and the magnitude of the ligation rate constant significantly impact the rate of self&#8208;replication, suggesting that catalysts that both facilitate ligation and stabilize the intermediate complex might be a route to efficient nonenzymatic replication.

Kinetic simulations reveal that the intermediate complex stability and the magnitude of the ligation rate constant significantly impact the rate of self-replication, suggesting that catalysts that both facilitate ligation and stabilize the intermediate complex might be a route to efficient nonenzymatic replication.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Synthesis of a Hybrid Composed of Anisotropic Niobate Layers Modified with MoC Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 33, June 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Layer cake: The in&#8197;situ deposition of MoC in liquid phase in the presence of the double&#8208;layered nanosheets led to the formation of the new hybrid composed of MoC nanoparticles on the nanosheets, which can be regarded as a stacking of the two layers with anisotropically modified nanoparticles.







Abstract
The hybrid composed of anisotropic niobate layers modified with MoC nanoparticles is synthesized by multistep reactions. The stepwise interlayer reactions for layered hexaniobate induce selective surface modification at the alternate interlayers, and the following ultrasonication leads to the formation of double&#8208;layered nanosheets. The further liquid phase MoC deposition with the double&#8208;layered nanosheets leads to the decoration of MoC nanoparticles on the surfaces of the double&#8208;layered nanosheets. The new hybrid can be regarded as a stacking of the two layers with anisotropically modified nanoparticles. The relatively high temperature in the MoC synthesis causes partial leaching of the grafted phosphonate groups. The exposed surface of the niobate nanosheets due to the partial leaching may interact with MoC to succeed in the hybridization. The hybrid after heating exhibits photocatalytic activity, indicating that this hybridization method can be useful for hybrid synthesis of semiconductor nanosheets and co&#8208;catalyst nanoparticles toward photocatalytic application.

         <title>Triboelectric Nanogenerators Assembled by Cobalt(II) Coordination Polymer Incorporated Composite Films and their Application for Self&#8208;Powered Anticorrosion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 33, June 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cobalt(II) coordination complex was synthesized and incorporated into organic polymers to form composite films, which were used as friction materials to improve the output performance of triboelectric nanogenerators for self&#8208;powered electrochemical cathodic protection.







Abstract
A friction layer with stability and durability is important to promote the practical application of triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs). In this work, a two&#8208;dimensional cobalt coordination polymer (Co&#8208;CP) was successfully synthesized using cobalt nitrate, 4,4&#8242;,4&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;tricarboxyltriphenylamine and 2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine. To clearly clarify the effect of the doping proportions of Co&#8208;CP and the types of composite polymers on the output performance of the TENG, Co&#8208;CP was combined with two organic polymers having different polarities (polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) and ethyl cellulose (EC)) to form a series of composite films, which were used as the friction electrode materials to fabricate TENGs. Electrical characterizations indicated that a high output current and voltage were obtained from the TENG based on 15&#8197;wt.% Co&#8208;CP incorporated in PVDF (Co&#8208;CP@PVDF), which could be further improved by the Co&#8208;CP@EC composite film at the same doping ratio. Furthermore, the optimally fabricated TENG was demonstrated to prevent electrochemical corrosion of carbon steel.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Stabilized Thiyl Radicals Design Inspired by Elemental Periodic Extension Notion for Ligand&#8208;Based Alkene Addition</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 33, June 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Theoretical studies predict that osmium and technetium&#8208;stabilized thiyl radicals, [OsL3]+ and [TcL3]+/2+ (L = diphenylphosphinobenzenethiolate), having significant radical characters show ligand&#8208;centered reactivity toward alkene like their respective valence isoelectronic [RuL3]+ and [ReL3]+/2+, while neutral [TcL3], featuring little thiyl radical character, displays no reactivity like its valence isoelectronic [ReL3].







Abstract
Inspired by alkene addition to the Ru and Re tris(thiolate) complexes via carbon&#8208;sulfur bond formation/cleavage reactions along with a periodic extension catalysis notion, a comparative study of the electronic structures, mechanisms, and reactivities for ethylene addition to the Os and Tc tris(thiolate) complexes was performed by DFT and high&#8208;level ab initio quantum calculations. The oxidized Os and Tc complexes were revealed to exhibit sufficient radical characters on the ligands to support their reaction with ethylene, whereas neutral Tc tris(thiolate) complex featuring little thiyl radical character renders no reactivity toward ethylene. Differential reactivities of these tris(thiolate) complexes was deemed to derive from the synergy of the thiyl radical character, the electronegativity, the row, and the charge. Extending from Ru and Re tris(thiolate) complexes to their Os and Tc counterparts can help us to get insightful rationales that would promote further research on alkene addition to metal&#8208;stabilized thiyl radicals.

         <title>X&#8208;ray Study of Cembranoids with Flexible Rings from Boswellia papyrifera Resins Allowing Structural Revision of Misleading Structures from the Past 70 Years</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 33, June 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Over the past seven decades several cembranoids have been reported, but uncertainty still exists about their structures. In this study, we isolated 38 macrocyclic cembranoids from B.&#8197;papyrifera. Our 25 single&#8208;crystal analysis uncovered misleading factors in the previously determined stereochemistries, and this led to six structures being revised. In addition, we propose a biosynthetic pathway and briefly discuss SARs.







Abstract
Thirty new, highly oxygenated and stereogenic 14&#8208;membered macrocyclic diterpenoids, papyrifuranols A&#8208;Z (1&#8211;26) and AA&#8208;AD (27&#8211;30), and eight known analogs have been isolated from Boswellia papyrifera resins. All the structures were characterized by detailed spectral analyses, quantum calculations, X&#8208;ray diffraction, and modified Mosher's methods. Notably, six previously reported structures were revised. Our study points out misleading factors of macrocyclic cembranoid (CB) representation in the past seven decades by analyzing of 25 X&#8208;ray structures, lending a hand for the innately challenging structure identification of such flexible macrocyclic CBs and avoiding following the tracks of an overturned cart during future structure characterization and total synthesis. Biosynthetic conversions of all the isolates are proposed, and wound healing bioassays reveal that papyrifuranols N&#8722;P could significantly stimulate the proliferation and differentiation of umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells.

         <title>Understanding the Reactivity of Diazaborinines towards the Activation of &#963;&#8208;Bonds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 33, June 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reactivity trends: The factors controlling the activation of the E&#8722;H &#963;&#8208;bonds promoted by diazaborinines have been computationally explored in detail. The crucial roles of aromaticity and the main orbital interactions on the reactivity of these main&#8208;group species are quantitatively revealed.







Abstract

         <title>Structural Complexity in the Apparently Simple Crystal Structure of Be2Ru</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 33, June 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The investigation of the crystal structure of Be2Ru through single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy, yields a picture which is more complex than the ideal Be2Ru structure (Fe2P&#8208;type structure). Indeed, minor inclusions of orthorhombic fragments into the extended hexagonal Fe2P&#8208;type matrix are observed. Charge transfer contributes strongly to the stabilization of such atomic arrangement.







Abstract
The structural features of the hexagonal layered crystal structure of Be2Ru (a=5.7508(3)&#8197;&#197;, c=3.0044(2)&#8197;&#197;, space group P
2m) were investigated by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The residual electron density and high&#8208;resolution TEM images show that the real structure can be described as an intergrowth of the main hexagonal matrix of the Fe2P type with minor orthorhombic inclusions of its stacking variants. Such atomic arrangement is stabilized by the charge transfer from Be to Ru and by a system of polar three&#8208; and four&#8208;atomic bonds involving both components. The calculated electronic density of states (DOS) of Be2Ru revealed, contrarily to typical intermetallic compounds, a pseudo gap (dip) in the vicinity of the Fermi level. The temperature dependence of the electrical resistivity of Be2Ru shows metal behaviour in agreement with the non&#8208;zero DOS at the Fermi level.

         <title>Structural and Synthetic Insights on Oxidative Homocouplings of Alkynes Mediated by Alkali&#8208;Metal Manganates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 33, June 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Alkali&#8208;metal manganates can efficiently promote homocoupling of terminal alkynes affording 1,3&#8208;diynes using dry air as terminal oxidant. Reactivity studies including the trapping of key organometallic intermediates have revealed that Na/Mn(II) is the most efficient bimetallic partnership to promote these reactions under stoichiometric regimes.







Abstract
Exploiting bimetallic cooperation alkali&#8208;metal manganate (II) complexes can efficiently promote oxidative homocoupling of terminal alkynes furnishing an array of conjugated 1,3&#8208;diynes. The influence of the alkali&#8208;metal on these C&#8722;C bond forming processes has been studied by preparing and structurally characterizing the alkali&#8208;metal tetra(alkyl) manganates [(TMEDA)2Na2Mn(CH2SiMe3)4] and [(PMDETA)2K2Mn(CH2SiMe3)4]. Reactivity studies using phenylacetylene as a model substrate have revealed that for the homocoupling to take place initial metalation of the alkyne is required. In this regard, the lack of basicity of neutral Mn(CH2SiMe3)2 precludes the formation of the diyne. Contrastingly, the tetra(alkyl) alkali&#8208;metal manganates behave as polybasic reagents, being able to easily deprotonate phenylacetylene yielding [{(THF)4Na2Mn(C&#8801;CPh)4}&#8734;] and [(THF)4Li2Mn(C&#8801;CPh)4]. Controlled exposure of [{(THF)4Na2Mn(C&#8801;CPh)4}&#8734;] and [(THF)4Li2Mn(C&#8801;CPh)4] to dry air confirmed their intermediary in formation of 1,4&#8208;diphenyl&#8208;1,3&#8208;butadiyne in excellent yields. While the Na/Mn(II) partnership proved to be the most efficient in stoichiometric transformations, under catalytic regimes, the combination of MC&#8801;CAr (M= Li, Na) and MnCl2 (6&#8197;mol&#8201;%) only works for lithium, most likely due to the degradation of alkynylsodiums under the aerobic reaction conditions.

         <title>Dynamic Metalloporphyrin&#8208;Based [2]Rotaxane Molecular Shuttles Stimulated by Neutral Lewis Base and Anion Coordination</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 33, June 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of dynamic Zn(II), Ni(II) and free base porphyrin&#8208;containing rotaxanes are reported. Co&#8208;ordination to the Zn(II) axle porphyrin centre by a macrocycle&#8208;contained pyridyl Lewis base affords significant co&#8208;conformational bias. Displacement of the macrocycle by a competing neutral Lewis base or anion elucidates an optical response in the porphyrin absorption spectra, enabling a novel optical signal transduction mechanism for dynamic mechanical bond shuttling and anion detection.







Abstract
A series of dynamic metalloporphyrin [2]rotaxane molecular shuttles comprising of bis&#8208;functionalised Zn(II) porphyrin axle and pyridyl functionalised macrocycle components are prepared in high yield via active metal template synthetic methodology. Extensive variable temperature 1H&#8197;NMR and quantitative UV&#8208;Vis spectroscopic titration studies demonstrate dynamic macrocycle translocation is governed by an inter&#8208;component co&#8208;ordination interaction between the macrocycle pyridyl and axle Zn(II) metalloporphyrin, which serves to bias a &#8216;resting state&#8217; co&#8208;conformation. The dynamic shuttling behaviour of the interlocked structures is dramatically inhibited by the addition of a neutral Lewis base such as pyridine, but can also be tuned via post&#8208;synthetic rotaxane demetallation of the porphyrin axle core to give free&#8208;base, or upon subsequent metallation, Ni(II) [2]rotaxane analogues. Importantly, the Lewis acidic Zn(II) porphyrin axle component is also capable of coordinating anions which induces mechanical bond shuttling behaviour resulting in a novel optical sensing response.

         <title>Can NbO Keep nbo Topology under Electrons? &#8211;Unveiling Novel Aspects of Niobium Monoxide at the Atomic Scale</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 33, June 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
NbO was observed suffering a structural transition induced by e&#8208;beam irradiation. The structures of pristine, during transition and fully transformed NbO were studied by X&#8208;ray diffraction, electron microscopy and density functional theory approaches. The results revealed a transition process from pristine Pm&#8208;3&#8197;m, through a structure of various occupancy formed by atoms migration, to a final stage, a Fm&#8208;3&#8197;m NaCl&#8208;type structure with 75&#8201;% occupancy.







Abstract
A precise investigation of NbO has been carried out by advanced electron microscopy combined with powder and single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD). The structure of pristine NbO has been determined as Pm&#8208;3&#8197;m space group (SG) with a = 4.211&#8197;&#197; and the positions of Nb and O at the 3c and 3d Wyckoff positions, respectively, which is consistent with previous report based on powder XRD data. Electron beams induced a structural transition, which was investigated and explained by combining electron diffraction and atomic&#8208;resolution imaging. The results revealed that the electron beam stimulated both Nb and O atom&#8208;migrations within each fcc sublattice, and that the final structure was SG Fm&#8208;3&#8197;m with a = 4.29&#8197;&#197;, Nb and O at the 4a and 4b with 75&#8201;% occupancy and same chemical composition. Antiphase planar defects were discovered in the pristine NbO and related to the structural transformation.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;NbO was observed&lt;/b&gt; suffering a structural transition induced by e-beam irradiation. The structures of pristine, during transition and fully transformed NbO were studied by X-ray diffraction, electron microscopy and density functional theory approaches. The results revealed a transition process from pristine &lt;i&gt;Pm&lt;/i&gt;-3&#8197;&lt;i&gt;m&lt;/i&gt;, through a structure of various occupancy formed by atoms migration, to a final stage, a &lt;i&gt;Fm&lt;/i&gt;-3&#8197;&lt;i&gt;m&lt;/i&gt; NaCl-type structure with 75&#8201;% occupancy.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A precise investigation of NbO has been carried out by advanced electron microscopy combined with powder and single crystal X-ray diffraction (XRD). The structure of pristine NbO has been determined as &lt;i&gt;Pm&lt;/i&gt;-3&#8197;&lt;i&gt;m&lt;/i&gt; space group (SG) with &lt;i&gt;a&lt;/i&gt; = 4.211&#8197;&#197; and the positions of Nb and O at the 3&lt;i&gt;c&lt;/i&gt; and 3&lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt; Wyckoff positions, respectively, which is consistent with previous report based on powder XRD data. Electron beams induced a structural transition, which was investigated and explained by combining electron diffraction and atomic-resolution imaging. The results revealed that the electron beam stimulated both Nb and O atom-migrations within each fcc sublattice, and that the final structure was SG &lt;i&gt;Fm&lt;/i&gt;-3&#8197;&lt;i&gt;m&lt;/i&gt; with &lt;i&gt;a&lt;/i&gt; = 4.29&#8197;&#197;, Nb and O at the 4&lt;i&gt;a&lt;/i&gt; and 4&lt;i&gt;b&lt;/i&gt; with 75&#8201;% occupancy and same chemical composition. Antiphase planar defects were discovered in the pristine NbO and related to the structural transformation. Theoretical calculations performed by density functional theory (DFT) supported the experimental conclusions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A pH&#8208; and Metal&#8208;Actuated Molecular Shuttle in Water</title>

The grafting of small hydrophobic groups on a rigid, linear and pH&#8208;responsive guest molecule for CB[7] resulted in significant changes of binding modes. Modulation of pH or addition of Ag+ cations enabled (i) ring translocation, (ii) ring shuttling and (iii) control over host:guest stoichiometry.







Abstract
The structure of the Viologen&#8208;Phenylene&#8208;Imidazole (VPI) guest, previously shown to be bound by cucurbit[7]uril (CB[7]) with binding modes depending on pH and silver ions, has been extended by adding hydrophobic groups on the two extremities of VPI before investigations of CB[7] binding by NMR, ITC, X&#8208;ray diffraction, UV&#8208;vis and fluorescence spectroscopies. With an imidazole station extended by a naphthalene group (VPI&#8208;N), binding modes of CB[7] are similar to those previously observed. However, with the viologen extended by a tolyl group (T&#8208;VPI), CB[7] preferentially sits on station T, shuttling between the T and P stations at acid pH or after Ag+ addition. The CB[7]&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;T&#8208;VPI complex thus behaves as a metal&#8208;actuated thermodynamic stop&#8208;and&#8208;go molecular shuttle featured by fast and autonomous ring translocation between two stations and a continuum for fractional station occupancy solely and easily controlled by Ag+ concentration.

         <title>Chemical Synthesis of Alpha&#8208;Synuclein Proteins via Solid&#8208;Phase Peptide Synthesis and Native Chemical Ligation</title>

         <dc:description>
The aggregation of alpha&#8208;Synuclein, a protein associated with several neurodegenerative diseases, can be altered by mutations and by posttranslational modifications, but the precise effects of these alterations are still elusive. Here, we devised a strategy for the chemical synthesis of the protein combining solid&#8208;phase peptide synthesis and native chemical ligation. This enables the synthesis of custom&#8208;made protein variants to determine their aggregation behavior.







Abstract
Alpha&#8208;Synuclein (&#945;&#8208;Synuclein) is a 140 amino acid protein implicated in neurodegenerative disorders known as synucleinopathies, where it accumulates in proteinaceous inclusions in the brain. The normal physiological function of &#945;&#8208;Synuclein remains obscure, as it exists in several non&#8208;neuronal cells in which its function has not been studied. Given the tremendous interest in studying &#945;&#8208;Synuclein, and the existing limitations in the production of modified forms of the protein, we developed a method for the chemical synthesis of &#945;&#8208;Synuclein by combining peptide fragment synthesis via automated microwave&#8208;assisted solid&#8208;phase peptide synthesis and ligation strategies. Our synthetic pathway enables the synthesis of protein variants of interest, carrying either mutations or posttranslational modifications, for further investigations of the effects on the structure and aggregation behavior of the protein. Ultimately, our study forms the foundation for future syntheses and studies of other custom&#8208;made &#945;&#8208;Synuclein variants with a single or several modifications, as necessary.

Regiopure 1,6/7 perylenediimide (PDI) precursors are prepared at the gram scale for the first time, offering the possibility to systematically study the regioisomerism&#8208;dependant optoelectronic properties of PDI&#8208;based materials.







Abstract
The use of perylenediimide (PDI) building blocks in materials for organic electronic is of considerable interest. This popular n&#8208;type organic semiconductor is tuned by introducing peripheral groups in their ortho and bay positions. Such modifications radically alter their optoelectronic properties. In this article, we describe an efficient method to afford regioisomerically pure 1,6/7&#8208;(NO2)2&#8208; and (NH2)2&#8208;PDIs employing two key steps: the selective crystallization of 1,6&#8208;(NO2)2&#8208;perylene&#8208;3,4,9,10&#8208;tetracarboxy tetrabutylester and the nitration of regiopure 1,7&#8208;Br2&#8208;PDI with silver nitrite. The optoelectronic properties of the resulting regioisomerically pure dinitro, diamino&#8208;PDIs and bisazacoronenediimides (BACDs) are reported and demonstrate the need to separate both regioisomers of such n&#8208;type organic semiconductors for their inclusion in advanced optoelectronic devices. For the first time, the two regioisomers of the same PDI starting material are available on the multigram scale, which will stimulate the exploration of regioisomerism/properties relationship for this family of dyes.

Late&#8208;stage derivatization of a shape&#8208;persistent alkyne&#8208;containing cycloparaphenylene via copper&#8208;free [3+2]azide&#8208;alkyne cycloadditions is studied. Systematic variation of the readily available azides from electron&#8208;rich to &#8208;deficient unveil how peripheral substitution affect the properties of the resulting adducts including molecular shape, the oxidation potential, excited state features, and affinities towards different fullerenes.







Abstract
Deriving diverse compound libraries from a single substrate in high yields remains to be a challenge in cycloparaphenylene chemistry. In here, a strategy for the late&#8208;stage functionalization of shape&#8208;persistent alkyne&#8208;containing cycloparaphenylene has been explored using readily available azides. The copper&#8208;free [3+2]azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition provided high yields (&gt;90&#8201;%) in a single reaction step. Systematic variation of the azides from electron&#8208;rich to &#8208;deficient shines light on how peripheral substitution influences the characteristics of the resulting adducts. We find that among the most affected properties are the molecular shape, the oxidation potential, excited state features, and affinities towards different fullerenes. Joint experimental and theoretical results are presented including calculations with the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art, artificial intelligence&#8208;enhanced quantum mechanical method 1 (AIQM1).

         <title>Computational Screening of Two&#8208;Dimensional Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks as Efficient Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts for Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>

Two&#8208;dimensional M3(HADQ)2 metal&#8208;organic frameworks are identified as potential single&#8208;atom catalysts for ORR, and their catalytic activity can be effectively tuned by varying the central metal.







Abstract
The development of efficient and inexpensive oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalysts is crucial for renewable energy technologies. Herein, using density functional theory (DFT) methods and microkinetic simulations, we systematically investigated the ORR catalytic performance of a series of 2D metal&#8208;organic frameworks M3(HADQ)2 (HADQ=2,3,6,7,10,11&#8208;hexaamine dipyrazino quinoxaline). It shows that all 2D M3(HADQ)2 (M=Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Ru, Rh and Pd) monolayers are metallic, due to &#960;&#8208;conjugated crystal orbitals centered on the central metals and ligand N atoms. The catalytic activity of M3(HADQ)2 depends on the binding strength between ORR intermediates and metal species, and can be tuned via changing the central metals. Among these candidates, Rh3(HADQ)2 and Co3(HADQ)2 show superior ORR performance to Pt (111) with high half&#8208;wave potentials of 0.99 and 0.93&#8197;V, respectively. Moreover, the screened two catalysts have excellent intermediate&#8208;tolerance ability for dynamic coverage of oxygenated species on the active sites. Our work provides a new path towards developing efficient ORR electrocatalysts.

A novel palladacyclic 1,3&#8208;bis(2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl)acenaphthoimidazol&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene (AnIPr) precatalyst possessing a chiral oxazoline was designed. It enables a general protocol towards bulky tri&#8208;ortho&#8208;substituted biaryls, ternaphthalenes and diarylanthracenes via the Pd&#8208;catalyzed Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura reaction (SMR) employing equimolar organoborons and aryl bromides.







Abstract
The Pd&#8208;catalyzed Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura cross&#8208;couplings (SMRs) are utilized as the most practical method to construct C&#8722;C bond, especial for biaryls. However, a major disadvantage of current protocols is the requirement of excess organoboron coupling partner (1.5&#8211;3.0&#8197;equiv.). Herein, a novel palladacyclic 1,3&#8208;bis(2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl)acenaphthoimidazol&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene (AnIPr) precatalyst possessing a chiral oxazoline was designed, which enabled a general protocol towards bulky tri&#8208;ortho&#8208;substituted biaryls, ternaphthalenes and diarylanthracenes via the Pd&#8208;catalyzed SMR employing equimolar organoborons and aryl bromides. A remarkable scope of substrates with various functional groups and heterocycles were well compatible with an adaptability to synthesize useful ligands.

         <title>Oxidized Bridged Carbenoids as Viable Intermediates in a Fe(III) Catalyzed C&#8722;H Insertion Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 33, June 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using DFT calculations, we propose an Fe(III) bridged carbenoid species to be a key intermediate and not a dead&#8208;end in an Fe catalyzed C(sp2)&#8722;H insertion reaction. This study will provide the impetus to develop the underutilized Fe(III) complexes in carbene insertion reactions catalyzed by small molecules and enzymes.







Abstract
Fe catalyzed carbene insertion reactions present an efficient route for direct C&#8722;H functionalization. The use of Fe(III) in place of the widely used Fe(II) presents several benefits. However, the mechanistic understanding of Fe(III) severely lags behind Fe(II) complexes. One of the major unsolved issues relates to the formation of bridged versus terminal metallocarbenes. Even though the oxidized bridged carbenoid complexes have been isolated and found to be thermodynamically more stable, they are generally considered a dead end for the catalytic cycle. In the current report, the formation and the subsequent reactions of the bridged carbenoid complexes for an Fe(TPP)Cl catalyzed C(sp2)&#8722;H insertion are investigated. Using DFT calculations, it is observed that both mono and bis oxidized bridged carbenoid complexes can participate in the catalytic cycle. Importantly, for the first time, a mechanistic pathway showing that these bridged species are not a dead end in Fe catalysis is presented. Their existence in other reactions might be more prevalent than what is currently believed. The current study will have important implications in utilizing Fe(III) complexes for other insertion reactions, especially for heme containing enzymes which necessarily need to be carried out under anaerobic/reducing conditions.

         <title>Access to Benzo&#8208; and Naphtho&#8208;Azaphospholes via C&#8722;H Bond Activation of Aryl&#8208;Substituted Isonitriles</title>

From activation to migration. Activation of a C&#8722;H bond of phenyl&#8208; and naphthyl&#8208;substituted isonitriles with heterocyclopentane&#8208;1,3&#8208;diylene represents a new method that allows the formation of benzo&#8208; and naphtho&#8208;azaphospholes. For this method, the absence of substituents in ortho&#8208;position of phenyl isonitriles is obligatory, but various substituents in other positions are tolerated. This aromatic substitution reaction can be strongly influenced by light and stoichiometry of the isonitrile used.







Abstract
Differently substituted phenyl isonitriles (with C&#8722;H bonds in ortho&#8208;position) and naphthyl isonitriles were reacted with the cyclic biradical [&#8901;P(&#956;&#8208;N&#8208;Ter)2P&#8901;] (1). Insertion of the isonitrile formed a cyclic five&#8208;membered biradical [&#8901;P(NTer)2C(R)P&#8901;] (2R, R=phenyl, naphthyl) in the first step, followed by C&#8722;H activation at the aryl substituent, resulting in novel azaphospholes (5R), which could be isolated and fully characterized. The formation of the azaphospholes can be prevented by the addition of a second equivalent of isonitrile, which causes the blocking of the radical centers in 2R by adduct formation (3R). Quantum mechanical calculations showed that a significant increase in the aromaticity of the benzo&#8208; and naphtho&#8208;azaphospholes is one of the driving forces for the activation process leading to the formation of thermodynamically favored azaphospholes. Targeted activation of C&#8722;H bonds using biradical systems represents a new synthetic approach to generate benzo&#8208; and naphtho&#8208;azaphospholes.

         <title>(3+2)&#8208;Cyclization Reactions of Unsaturated Phosphonites with Aldehydes and Thioketones</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 33, June 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unsaturated phosphonites are excellent substrates in new (3+2)&#8208;cyclization reactions with aldehydes or thioketones. The cyclisation reactions proceed smoothly at room temperature and lead to the fast formation of the previously inaccessible phosphorus heterocycles 1,3&#8208;oxa&#8208; and 1,3&#8208;thiaphosphole&#8208;3&#8208;oxides in good to excellent yields.







Abstract
By exploiting the unique reactivity of ethynyl&#8208;phosphonites we obtain novel P(V)&#8208;containing five&#8208;membered heterocycles via (3+2)&#8208;cyclization reactions with aldehydes or cycloaliphatic thioketones in satisfactory to excellent yields. Whereas reactions with thioketones to yield 1,3&#8208;thiaphospholes&#8208;3&#8208;oxides occur smoothly at room temperature with equimolar amounts of the starting materials in absence of any catalyst, the analogous conversions with aldehydes to generate 3&#8208;oxides of 1,3&#8208;oxaphospholes require addition of triethylamine as a base. We postulate a step&#8208;wise (3+2)&#8208;cyclization mechanism for the formation of the 1,3&#8208;thiaphosphole ring based on DFT quantum chemical calculations. With this study, we introduce new cyclization reactions originating from unsaturated phosphonites as central synthetic building blocks to yield previously inaccessible stable phosphorus&#8208;containing heterocycles with unexplored potential for the molecular sciences.

         <title>Gold&#8208;Catalyzed Cascade Reaction of Diynamides with Allylic Alcohols: A Versatile Platform to Allenamide, 2&#8208;Aminofuran and Bridged [2.2.2]Octadiene Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 33, June 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A gold&#8208;catalyzed cascade reaction of conjugated diynamides with allylic alcohols was described, which features divergent preparation of 2&#8208;aminofurans, allenamides and bridged [2.2.2]octadienes in high efficiency, complete atom economy. Given the fact that multi&#8208;bonds were constructed via single operation, this reaction represents a good example on the synthsis of value&#8208;added molecules by using readily available chemicals as starting materials.







Abstract
Transition metal&#8208;catalyzed divergent synthesis through alternation of the catalyst is appealing, as it provides an operationally simple way to access different valuable products, while using the same reactants as starting materials. Herein, a gold&#8208;catalyzed cascade reaction of conjugated diynamides with allylic alcohols is described. By variation of the catalysts, substituted allenes and furans could be obtained selectively. Mechanistic studies indicate that, after the addition of allylic alcohol to gold&#8208;activated diynamide, a [3,3]&#8208;sigmatropic rearrangement would take place and lead to the formation of a common reactive intermediate, which would further convert to the final products selectively. Further variation of the structure of diynamides has unveiled an additional reaction sequence involving intramolecular Himbert arene/allene Diels&#8208;Alder cycloaddition to afford a series of dearomatized products bearing bicyclo[2,2,2]octadiene core.

         <title>An Intelligent Laser&#8208;Free Photodynamic Therapy Based on Endogenous miRNA&#8208;Amplified CRET Nanoplatform

Tumor biomarker&#8208;responsive theranostic holds great promise for precise medicine. Herein, a miRNA&#8208;amplified chemiluminescence resonance energy transfer (CRET) nanoplatform was constructed for tumor&#8208;specific laser&#8208;free photodynamic therapy. It exhibited prominent on&#8208;demand in&#8197;vivo tumor inhibition effects, indicating an intelligent medicine.







Abstract
Laser&#8208;free photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a promising noninvasive therapeutic modality for deep&#8208;seated tumor, yet is constrained by low efficiency due to the limited stimulation strategies. Herein, a novel miRNA&#8208;responsive laser&#8208;free PDT was developed through metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs)&#8208;mediated chemiluminescence resonance energy transfer (CRET) nanoplatform. The photosensitizer chlorin e6 (Ce6)&#8208;loaded MOFs were functionalized with hairpin nucleic acids for sensitive responsiveness of tumor biomarker miRNA through catalytic hairpin assembly (CHA), which enabled the amplified assembly of horseradish peroxidase (HRP)&#8208;mimicking hemin/G&#8208;quadruplex DNAzyme on MOFs. Simultaneously, the on&#8208;MOF assembled DNAzymes efficiently catalyzed chemiluminescence reaction to stimulate adjacent Ce6 in the presence of luminol and H2O2, thus allowing the CRET&#8208;mediated Ce6 luminescence and reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation for self&#8208;illuminating PDT. The CRET nanoplatform achieved significant malignant cell apoptosis and tumor inhibition effects without external laser irradiation. It is envisioned that the miRNA&#8208;amplified CRET nanoplatform might be a selective and highly efficient antitumor nanomedicine for precise theranostic.

         <title>Polarization&#8208;Sensitive Detector of Two&#8208;Dimensional Multilayer Hybrid Perovskite Crystals Showing High Polarization Ratio to Weak Light</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 33, June 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The compound (FPEA)2(MA)Pb2Br7 synthesized in this work possesses high polarization ratio (Imax/Imin=1.35) under weak light (330&#8197;nW/cm2). This work enriches the prospect of hybrid perovskite materials in weak light polarization sensitive detection.







Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) hybrid perovskite materials have been widely used for polarization&#8208;sensitive photodetection due to their fascinating optical and physical attributes. However, studies on those materials that enable strong polarized&#8208;light activities under a weak&#8208;light condition remain quite scarce. Here, by tailoring aromatic cation into 3D prototype, we have successfully obtained a new 2D hybrid perovskite, (FPEA)2(MA)Pb2Br7 (1, where FPEA is 4&#8208;fluorophenethylammonium and MA is methylammonium). The alternative alignment of inorganic and organic structural components results in significant anisotropy, including optical absorption and electric conductivity. The coupling effect of these anisotropic properties in 1 gives rise to strong dichroic activities toward detecting polarized light. Especially, under weak light intensity (&#8764;330&#8197;nW/cm2), it can still generate a large polarization ratio up to 1.35, which is even higher than those of some typical 2D materials (i.&#8201;e., GeSe &#8764;1.09). Besides, single crystal&#8208;based photodetector of 1 displays fascinating detecting performances, including large photocurrent on/off ratio (&#8764;104), fast response time (&#8764;154/182&#8197;&#956;s) and excellent antifatigued stability. These findings disclose the potentials of 1 as a robust candidate for detecting weak polarized light, which has practical applications in the field of polarized optoelectronics.

         <title>A Template&#8208;Free Pd2L4 Cage with up to Nanomolar Affinity for Chloride in Aqueous Solutions
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 33, June 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Halide catcher: A template&#8208;free, water&#8208;soluble Pd2L4 cage that binds chloride with up to nanomolar affinity in aqueous solutions is reported here. Of the most abundant essential anions present in living organisms, this cage exclusively binds chloride. This unprecedented binding affinity/selectivity was achieved by making the best use of hydrogen bonding and electrostatic interactions.







Abstract
Selective binding of chloride over the other most abundant anions in living organisms is pivotal due to its essential role in physiological functions. Herein, we report a template&#8208;free Pd2L4 cage exhibiting high selectivity for medium&#8208;sized halides (i.&#8201;e., Cl&#8722;, Br&#8722;) in water owing to the size&#8208;discriminatory nature of the cage cavity. In pure water, this cage displays high selectivity and micromolar affinity for chloride. The cage shows no binding towards other biologically more abundant essential anions such as phosphates, carboxylates, or bicarbonate. This cage shows an unprecedented nanomolar affinity with 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 binding stoichiometry for chloride in aqueous&#8208;DMSO media. This high affinity was achieved with the best use of traditional hydrogen bonding and electrostatic interactions, as confirmed by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis. This well&#8208;defined cage sequestrates F&#8722; by cleaving a B&#8722;F bond in BF4&#8722; in a facile manner in a nonpolar solvent or in the presence of excess ligand. This cage also demonstrates capture of the sub&#8208;ppm chloride level that is present in commercial D2O samples.

         <title>Modifications of Acyl Carrier Protein&#8208;Bound Glycosylated Polyketides in Pactamycin Biosynthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 33, June 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of post&#8208;glycosylation modifications is observed on a glycosylated polyketide while it is still attached to the carrier protein. These unprecedented biotransformations represent some of the hallmarks of the highly unusual biosynthetic pathway to the potent antitumor antibiotic pactamycin. The enzymes, which show substrate promiscuity, may be developed as tools for sugar modifications on glycoproteins or other biomolecules.







Abstract
The potent antitumor antibiotic pactamycin is an aminocyclopentitol&#8208;containing natural product produced by the soil bacterium Streptomyces pactum. Recent studies showed that the aminocyclopentitol unit is derived from N&#8208;acetyl&#8208;D&#8208;glucosamine, which is attached to an acyl carrier protein (ACP)&#8208;bound polyketide by a glycosyltransferase enzyme, PtmJ. Here, we report a series of post&#8208;glycosylation modifications of the sugar moiety of the glycosylated polyketide while it is still attached to the carrier protein. In vitro reconstitution of PtmS (an AMP&#8208;ligase), PtmI (an ACP), PtmJ, PtmN (an oxidoreductase), PtmA (an aminotransferase), and PtmB (a putative carbamoyltransferase) showed that the N&#8208;acetyl&#8208;D&#8208;glucosamine moiety of the glycosylated polyketide is first oxidized by PtmN and then transaminated by PtmA to give ACP&#8208;bound 3&#8208;amino&#8208;3&#8208;deoxy&#8208;N&#8208;acetyl&#8208;D&#8208;glucosaminyl polyketide. The amino group is then coupled with carbamoyl phosphate by PtmB to give a urea functionality. We also show that PtmG is a deacetylase that hydrolyses the C&#8208;2&#8197;N&#8208;acetyl group to give a free amine.

Boswellia papyrifera resins have had a long journey from 1500 BC. In 1966, the cembranoid skeleton become a part of the journey towards chemical investigations, and several cembranoids have been reported, but there is still uncertainty about their structure elucidation. In this study, we isolated 38 macrocyclic cembranoids from B. papyrifera resins, including six whose accepted structures needed to be revised. The study describes 25 single&#8208;crystal analyses, during which misleading factors in the stereochemistry determinations over the past 70 years were found. In addition, in their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202300559) Y.&#8208;X. Cheng and co&#8208;workers propose a biosynthetic pathway and briefly discuss SAR studies.

A supramolecular halide catcher catches chloride exclusively from an aqueous solution containing the biologically most abundant essential anions. Multiple noncovalent interactions are involved in the deep enclosure of the designer self&#8208;assembled coordination cage for chloride binding. Impressively, chloride is captured with up to nanomolar affinity in aqueous solutions. More information can be found in the Research Article by D.&#8197;K. Chand and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202300891).

Periodic mesoporous organosilicas (PMOs) are high surface area organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid nanomaterials that have found broad applications in various fields of research such as in (bio)chemistry or material science. By choosing suitable organic groups in the framework of these materials, their surface properties such as polarity, optical/electrical characteristics and adsorption capacity can be tuned. This critical review provides an overview of the current state of the art in the developments and applications of some PMO nanomaterials in diverse fields of research. This is placed in the context of four leading areas of PMO nanomaterials, including chiral PMOs, plugged PMO nanomaterials, Janus PMOs and PMO&#8208;based nanomotors. The review briefly discusses the recent and key findings on these PMO nanomaterials as well as their potential applications for future developments.

         <title>Linkage Chemistry of S(VI) Fluorides</title>

Sulfur(VI)&#8208;fluoride exchange: This review summarizes recent advances in the linkage chemistry of S(VI) fluorides since 2014, emphasizing the formation of S&#8722;O, S&#8722;N, and S&#8722;C bonds. The divergent SuFEx linkage is deployed in the assembly of S(VI)&#8208;containing compounds library.







Abstract
Sulfur(VI)&#8208;fluoride exchange linkage as a next generation of click chemistry was introduced by Sharpless and coworkers in 2014. Distinguished from CuAAC, the SuFEx reaction proceeds under metal&#8208;free conditions, and the reactive linkers are variable, enabling access to a diverse class of linkage compounds. Therein, a series of SuFEx linkers emerged has been widely prevalent in diverse fields. The SVI&#8722;F bond in comparison to SVI&#8722;Cl bond features excellent stability and chemoselectivity. The linkage chemistry primarily involves the formation of S&#8722;O and S&#8722;N bonds via commercially available phenols and amines, yet less study on C&#8208;SuFEx linkage. This review will focus on three types of linkage for SuFEx linkers comprising S&#8722;O, S&#8722;N, and S&#8722;C bonds, and we hope to provide a practical guidance for SuFEx linkage chemistry.

         <title>Shape Transformation via Etching and Regrowth: A Systematic Study of Pd Nanocrystals with Different Shapes and Twin Structures</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This article describes a systematic study of the oxidative etching and regrowth behaviors of Pd nanocrystals, including single&#8208;crystal cubes bounded by {100} facets,&#160;single&#8208;crystal&#160;octahedra and tetrahedra enclosed by {111} facets; and multiple&#8208;twinned icosahedra covered by {111} facets. During etching, Pd atoms are preferentially oxidized and removed from the corners regardless of the type of nanocrystal, and the resultant Pd2+ ions are then reduced back to elemental Pd. For cubes and icosahedra, the newly formed Pd atoms are deposited on the {100} facets and twin boundaries, respectively, due to their relatively higher energies. For octahedra and tetrahedra, the Pd atoms self&#8208;nucleate in the solution phase, followed by their growth into small particles. We can control the etching rate relative to regrowth by varying the concentration of HCl in the reaction solution. As the concentration of HCl increases, 18&#8208;nm Pd cubes converted to&#160;octahedra of 23, 18, and 13 nm, respectively, in edge length. Due to the absence of regrowth, however, Pd octahedra are transformed into truncated octahedra, cuboctahedra, and spheres with decreasing sizes whereas Pd tetrahedra evolved into truncated tetrahedra and spheres. In contrast, Pd icosahedra with twin boundaries on the surface converted to asymmetric icosahedra, flower&#8208;like icosahedra, and spheres.</dc:description>

         <title>Synergistic Visible Light Photocatalysis with Organocatalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The strategy of merging visible light photocatalysis and organocatalysis has been utilized and applied in a wide range of reactions. This review summarized the latest advances in the field of cooperative catalysis by the combination of organocatalysis and photocatalysis in recent organic synthesis.







Abstract
In recent years, the strategy of merging visible light photocatalysis and organocatalysis has been utilized and applied in a wide range of reactions. Taking advantage of synergistic visible light photocatalysis with organocatalysis, remarkable progress has recently been achieved in modern chemical synthesis. In these dual catalytic systems, photocatalysts or photosensitizers absorb visible light to induce their photo&#8208;excited states which can activate unreactive substrates via electron or energy transfer mechanisms, and organocatalysts are usually employed to control the chemical reactivities of the other substrates. This review mainly focuses on the recent development of cooperative catalysis by the combination of organocatalysis and photocatalysis in recent organic synthesis.

         <title>Mono&#8208; and Difluorinated Saturated Heterocyclic Amines for Drug Discovery: Systematic Study of Their Physicochemical Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A comprehensive study of physicochemical properties (pKa, LogP, and intrinsic microsomal clearance) within the series of mono&#8208; and difluorinated azetidine, pyrrolidine, and piperidine derivatives was performed. While the number of fluorine atoms and their distance to the protonation center were the major factors defining the compound&#8217;s basicity, both pKa and LogP values were affected considerably by the conformational preferences of the corresponding derivatives. For example, features of &#8220;Janus face&#8221; (facially polarized) cyclic compounds (i.e., unusually high hydrophilicity) were identified for cis&#8208;3,5&#8208;difluoropiperidine, prefering a diaxial conformation. Intrinsic microsomal clearance measurements demonstrated high metabolic stability of the compounds studied (with a single exception of the 3,3&#8208;difluoroazetidine derivative). According to pKa &#8211; LogP plots, the title compounds provide a valuable extension of the fluorine&#8208;containing (e.g., fluoroalkyl&#8208;substituted) saturated heterocyclic amine series as building blocks for rational optimization studies in early drug discovery.</dc:description>

         <title>Enantioselective Synthesis of Tropane Scaffolds by an Organocatalyzed 1,3&#8208;Dipolar Cycloaddition of 3&#8208;Oxidopyridinium Betaines and Dienamines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Tropane alkaloids constitute a compound&#8208;class which are structurally defined by a central 8&#8209;azabicyclo[3.2.1]octane core. A diverse bioactivity profile combined with an unusual aza&#8208;bridged bicyclic framework has made tropanes molecules&#8208;of&#8208;interest within organic chemistry. Enantioselective examples of (5 + 2) cycloadditions between 3&#8208;oxidopyridinium betaines and olefins remain unexplored, despite 3&#8208;oxidopyridinium betaines being useful reagents in organic synthesis. We report the first asymmetric (5 + 2) cycloaddition of 3&#8208;oxidopyridinium betaines, affording tropane derivatives in up to quantitative yield and with excellent control of peri&#8208;, regio&#8208;, diastereo&#8208;, and enantioselectivity. The reactivity is enabled by dienamine&#8208;activation of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated aldehydes combined with in&#8208;situ formation of the pyridinium reaction&#8208;partner. A simple N&#8208;deprotection protocol allows for liberation of the tropane alkaloid motif, and synthetic elaborations of the cycloadducts demonstrate their synthetic utility to achieve highly diastereoselective modification around the bicyclic framework. DFT computations suggest a stepwise mechanism where regio&#8208; and stereoselectivity are defined during the first bond&#8208;forming step in which the pyridinium dipole exerts critical conformational control over its dienamine partner. In the second bond&#8208;forming step, a kinetic preference toward an initial (5 + 4) cycloadduct was identified; however, lack of catalyst turn&#8208;over, reversibility, and thermodynamic bias favoring a (5 + 2) cycloadduct render the reaction fully periselective.</dc:description>

         <title>The Coordination Behavior of the Tellurium Incorporated Mercuraazametallamacrocycle and Investigation of d10&#8729;&#8729;&#8729;d10&#160;Interactions between Closed Shell (Ag+&#160;Hg2+) Metal Ions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Here, a new tellurium and mercury containing mercuraazametallamacrocycle has been prepared via (2+2) condensation of bis(o&#8208;aminophenyl)telluride and bis(o&#8208;formylphenyl)mercury(II). The isolated bright yellow solid of mercuraazametallamacrocycle has adopted unsymmetrical figure&#8208;of&#8208;eight conformation in the crystal structure. To study the metallophilic interactions between closed shell metal ions, the macrocyclic ligand has been treated with two equiv of AgOTf (OTf = trifluoromethansulfonate) and AgBF4, which afforded greenish&#8208;yellow bimetallic silver complexes. The isolated silver complexes displayed intramolecular Hg&#183;&#183;&#183;Ag, Te&#183;&#183;&#183;Ag interactions as well as intermolecular Hg&#183;&#183;&#183;Hg interactions and formed an extended 1D molecular chain by directing six atoms to interact as TeII&#183;&#183;&#183;AgI&#183;&#183;&#183;HgII&#183;&#183;&#183;HgII&#183;&#183;&#183;AgI&#183;&#183;&#183;TeII in a non linear fashion. The Hg&#183;&#183;&#183;Ag, Te&#183;&#183;&#183;Ag interactions have also been studied in solution by 199Hg, 125Te NMR spectroscopy, absorption, and emission spectroscopy. In DFT calculations, the Atom in Molecule (AIM) analysis, non&#8208;covalent interactions (NCI), natural bonding orbital (NBO) analysis strongly supported for experimental evidences and revealed that the intermolecular Hg&#183;&#183;&#183;Hg interaction is stronger than the intramolecular Hg&#183;&#183;&#183;Ag interactions.</dc:description>

N&#8208;aryl amide bonds for peptide conformation: In the universe of peptides,theN&#8208;aryl amide bond, with its large steric and electronic effects and ability to restrain amide bond rotation, is represented as a new star. By employing N&#8208;arylation as a backbone amide modification strategy in peptides, we could unravel the different worlds of distinct and predominantly homogeneous conformations in cyclic hexa&#8208; and cyclic pentapeptides containing one or two N&#8208;aryl amide bonds.

         <title>Polymer&#8208;Stabilized Liquid Crystal Films Containing Dithienyldicyanoethene&#8208;Based Chiral Photoswitch: Multi&#8208;Modulation for Environment&#8208;Adaptative Smart Windows</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An environment&#8208;adaptative smart window with multi&#8208;modulations is constructed by a dithienyldicyanoethene&#8208;based chiral photoswitch. The smart window can be automatically transformed from initial transparent state to light scattering state with the changes of external ambient conditions, and can be manually switched between the opaque state and transparent state through a low electric field, which greatly satisfies the diverse requirements for daily life.







Abstract
A polymer&#8208;stabilized liquid crystal (PSLC)&#8208;based environment&#8208;adaptative smart window with multi&#8208;modulations is demonstrated. This PSLC system contains a right&#8208;handed dithienyldicyanoethene&#8208;based chiral photoswitch and a chiral dopant, S811, with opposite handedness, of which the reversible cis&#8208;trans photoisomerization of the switch can drive self&#8208;shading of the smart window under UV light stimulus because of the transition from nematic phase to cholesteric one. With the assistance of solar heat, the opacity of the smart window can be deepened because the heat promotes the isomerization conversion rate of the switch. This switch has no thermal relaxation at room temperature, therefore, the smart window exhibits dual stabilization: transparent state (cis&#8208;isomer) and opaque state (trans&#8208;isomer). Moreover, the incident intensity of sunlight can be regulated by an electric field, which allows the smart window to adapt to some specific situations. Such an energy&#8208;saving device can be used in buildings and vehicles to control indoor temperature and adapt to the required ambiance.

         <title>Sulfonyl Diazaborine &#8216;Click&#8217; Chemistry Enables Rapid and Efficient Bioorthogonal Labeling
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here we have systematically developed and deliberated an efficient bioorthogonal reaction via the rapid formation of sulfonyl&#8208;diazaborine. The conjugation is robust to demonstrate suitable application in cancer cell imaging and treatment.







Abstract
Finding an ideal bioorthogonal reaction that responds to a wide range of biological queries and applications is of great interest in biomedical applications. Rapid diazaborine (DAB) formation in water by the reactions of ortho&#8208;carbonyl phenylboronic acid with &#945;&#8208;nucleophiles is an attractive conjugation module. Nevertheless, these conjugation reactions demand to satisfy stringent criteria for bioorthogonal applications. Here we show that widely used sulfonyl hydrazide (SHz) offers a stable DAB conjugate by combining with ortho&#8208;carbonyl phenylboronic acid at physiological pH, competent for an optimal biorthogonal reaction. Remarkably, the reaction conversion is quantitative and rapid (k2&gt;103&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1) at low micromolar concentrations, and it preserves comparable efficacy in a complex biological milieu. DFT calculations support that SHz facilitates DAB formation via the most stable hydrazone intermediate and the lowest energy transition state compared to other biocompatible &#945;&#8208;nucleophiles. This conjugation is extremely efficient on living cell surfaces, enabling compelling pretargeted imaging and peptide delivery. We anticipate this work will permit addressing a wide range of cell biology queries and drug discovery platforms exploiting commercially available sulfonyl hydrazide fluorophores and derivatives.

&lt;p&gt;Here we have systematically developed and deliberated an efficient bioorthogonal reaction via the rapid formation of sulfonyl-diazaborine. The conjugation is robust to demonstrate suitable application in cancer cell imaging and treatment.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finding an ideal bioorthogonal reaction that responds to a wide range of biological queries and applications is of great interest in biomedical applications. Rapid diazaborine (DAB) formation in water by the reactions of ortho-carbonyl phenylboronic acid with &#945;-nucleophiles is an attractive conjugation module. Nevertheless, these conjugation reactions demand to satisfy stringent criteria for bioorthogonal applications. Here we show that widely used sulfonyl hydrazide (SHz) offers a stable DAB conjugate by combining with ortho-carbonyl phenylboronic acid at physiological pH, competent for an optimal biorthogonal reaction. Remarkably, the reaction conversion is quantitative and rapid (&lt;i&gt;k&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;gt;10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&#8197;M&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) at low micromolar concentrations, and it preserves comparable efficacy in a complex biological milieu. DFT calculations support that SHz facilitates DAB formation via the most stable hydrazone intermediate and the lowest energy transition state compared to other biocompatible &#945;-nucleophiles. This conjugation is extremely efficient on living cell surfaces, enabling compelling pretargeted imaging and peptide delivery. We anticipate this work will permit addressing a wide range of cell biology queries and drug discovery platforms exploiting commercially available sulfonyl hydrazide fluorophores and derivatives.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Blueprint for Transforming Indigos to Photoresponsive Molecular Tools</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The blue dye indigo has historically been isolated from the plant family Indigofera and widely applied in the denim industry for producing blue jeans. The advantageous photochemical properties of indigo and its derivatives have now attracted the attention of the scientific community for their use as molecular photoswitches. In their review Review (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202300981), C.&#8208;Y. Huang and S. Hecht detail the synthetic approaches to preparing indigos and discuss indigos&#8217; applications as photoresponsive molecular tools.

         <title>Electronic and Charge Transport Properties in Bridged versus Unbridged Nanohoops: Role of the Nanohoop Size</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The impact of the hoop size on the electronic and charge transport properties of [5]&#8208; and [4]&#8208;cyclo&#8208;N&#8208;butyl&#8208;2,7&#8208;carbazoles is reported. In these examples, a small nanohoop is beneficial for good organization of the molecules into thin films, whereas a large one increases the density of structural defects.

         <title>Structural Interconversion Based on Intramolecular Boroxine Formation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel structural interconversion unit based on intramolecular boroxine formation has been developed. The interconversion of a macrocyclic triboronic acid (blue Japanese umbrella) and a tricyclic boroxine (green pinwheel) can be triggered by water or temperature. These unique interconversions are attributed to the entropic advantage of intramolecular boroxine formation. More information can be found in the Research Article by K. Ono and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202300995).

         <title>Divergent Synthesis of Stachyurin and Casuarinin Focusing on C&#8208;Glycosidic Bond Reactivity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study developed a method for the divergent synthesis of stachyurin and casuarinin, focusing on the C&#8208;glycosidic bond reactivity. The proposed method applies to the syntheses of stachyurin and casuarinin analogues, thereby facilitating the utilization of their beneficial bioactivities.







Abstract
Stachyurin and casuarinin are ellagitannins, a class of polyphenols that exhibit various biological activities that have an impact on human health. Casuarinin is a stachyurin stereoisomer. These compounds contain the characteristic C&#8208;glycosidic bond between the open&#8208;chain d&#8208;glucose and the phenol aromatic ring. Therefore, chemical elucidation of the C&#8208;glycosidic bond reactivity is required to exploit their multiple bioactivities. This study developed a method for the divergent synthesis of stachyurin and casuarinin via the &#945;&#8208;selective C&#8208;glycosylation as well as the &#946;&#8208;selective introduction of the oxygen functional group, focusing on structural specificity. The proposed method applies to the syntheses of stachyurin and casuarinin analogues, thereby facilitating the utilisation of their beneficial bioactivities.

         <title>Persistent and Predominantly Localized Boron Radical from the Reduction of a Three&#8208;Dimensional Analogue of NHC&#8208;Stabilized Borafluorenium</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A persistent and predominantly localized boron radical has been synthesized by the single&#8208;electron reduction of a 3D analogue of an NHC&#8208;stabilized 9&#8208;borafluorenium cation. The steric and electron&#8208;withdrawing effect of the 1,1&#8217;&#8208;bis(o&#8208;carborane) backbone and the almost perpendicular orientation of the NHC ligand give rise to the distinct boron&#8208;centered radical character, as evidenced by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis, EPR spectroscopy, and DFT calculations. More information can be found in the Research Article by Q. Ye and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202301270).

         <title>Metal&#8208;organic framework derived Cu&#8208;Ag interface for selective carbon monoxide electroreduction to acetate</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrochemical carbon monoxide reduction reaction (CORR) is a potential way to obtain high&#8208;value multi&#8208;carbon (C2+) products. However, achieving high selectivity to acetate is still a challenge. Herein, we develop a two&#8208;dimensional Ag&#8208;modified Cu metal&#8208;organic framework (Ag0.10@CuMOF&#8208;74) that demonstrates Faradaic efficiency (FE) for C2+ products up to 90.4% at 200 mA cm&#8208;2 and an acetate FE of 61.1% with a partial current density of 122.2 mA cm&#8208;2. Detailed investigations show that the introduction of Ag on CuMOF&#8208;74 favors the generation of abundant Cu&#8208;Ag interface sites. In&#8208;situ attenuated total reflection surface enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy confirms that these Cu&#8208;Ag interface sites improve the coverage of *CO and *CHO and the coupling between each other and stabilize key intermediates *OCCHO and *OCCH2, thus significantly promoting to the acetate selectivity on Ag0.10@CuMOF&#8208;74. This work provides a high&#8208;efficiency pathway for CORR to C2+ products.</dc:description>

         <title>Design and Synthesis of BODIPY&#8208;Hetero[5]Helicenes as Heavy&#8208;Atom&#8208;Free&#160;Triplet Photosensitizers for Photodynamic Therapy of Cancer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Design of heavy&#8208;atom&#8208;free triplet photosensitizers (PSs) is a challenge for efficient photodynamic therapy (PDT) of cancer. Helicenes are twisted polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) having efficient ISC which is proportional to their twisting angle. But difficult syntheses and weak absorption profile restrict their use as heavy&#8208;atom&#8208;free triplet PSs for PDT applications. Boron containing PAHs, BODIPYs are highly recognized for outstanding optical properties. But planar BODIPY dyes have&#160;low ISC and thus they are also not very effective as PDT agents. Herein, we designed BODIPY and hetero[5]helicene fused dyes, BODIPY&#8208;hetero[5]helicene&#160;with red shifted absorbances. All dyes have helical structures and their twisting angles are increased by substitutions at boron&#8208;center. The new dyes showed superior optical properties and high ISC with respect to [5]helicene. Interestingly their ISC efficiencies increase proportionally with their twisting angles. Theoretical calculations showed that energy gap of the S1 and T1 states decreases in BODIPY&#8208;hetero[5]helicene as compared to planar BODIPY. This enhances their ISC rate which is responsible for high singlet oxygen generation. Finally, their potential applications as PDT agents were investigated and one of the dyes showed efficient cancer cell killing on photo&#8208;exposure. This new design strategy will be very useful for future development of heavy&#8208;atom&#8208;free PDT agents.</dc:description>

         <title>DNA Windmill Probe for Multiplexed mRNA Detection and Cell Type Discrimination</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Accurate cancer diagnosis especially early diagnosis is of great importance for prompt therapy and elevated survival rate. mRNAs are widely used as biomarkers for cancer identification and treatment. mRNA expression levels are highly associated with cancer stage and malignant progression. Nevertheless, single type mRNA detection is insufficient and unreliable. Herein, we developed a DNA nano&#8208;windmill probe for in situ multiplexed mRNAs detection and imaging in this paper. The probe is designed to simultaneously target four types of mRNA through wind blades. Importantly, recognition of targets is independent from each other, which further facilitate cell type discrimination. The probe can specifically distinguish cancer cell lines from normal cells. In addition, it can identify changes in mRNA expression levels in living cells. The current strategy enriches the toolbox for improving the accuracy of cancer diagnosis and therapeutic solutions.</dc:description>

         <title>The Factor Beyond Schmidt's Criteria That Impact the Photo&#8208;Induced [2+2] Cycloaddition Reactivity and Photoactuation of Molecular Crystals Based on Cyclic Chalcone Analogues</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The cyclic chalcone analogues of (E)&#8208;2&#8208;(2,4&#8208;dichlorobenzylidene)&#8208;2,3&#8208;dihydro&#8208;1H&#8208;inden&#8208;1&#8208;one (BIO), (E)&#8208;2&#8208;(naphthalen&#8208;2&#8208;ylmethylene)&#8208;2,3&#8208;dihydro&#8208;1H&#8208;inden&#8208;1&#8208;one (NIO), (Z)&#8208;2&#8208;(2,4&#8208;dichlorobenzylidene)benzofuran&#8208;3(2H)&#8208;one (BFO), and (Z)&#8208;2&#8208;(2,4&#8208;dichlorobenzylidene)benzo[b]thiophen&#8208;3(2H)&#8208;one (BTO) have been synthesized. While the geometrical parameters for the molecular packing of the above four compounds did not exceed Schmidt's criteria, [2+2] cycloaddition did not occur in&#160;&#160;BIO and BTO. Single crystal structures and Hirshfeld surfaces analyses revealed that there were interactions of C=O&#8729;&#8729;&#8729;H (CH2) existed between adjacent molecules in BIO. Therefore, the carbonyl and methylene groups linked with one carbon atom in carbon&#8208;carbon double bond were tightly confined in the lattice, acting as a tweezer to inhibit free movement of the double bond and suppressing [2+2] cycloaddition. In BTO, similar interactions of Cl&#8729;&#8729;&#8729;S and C=O&#8729;&#8729;&#8729;H (C6H4) prevented free movement of the double bond. In contrast, the intermolecular interaction of C=O&#8729;&#8729;&#8729;H only exists around the carbonyl group in BFO and NIO, leaving the C=C double bonds to move freely and allowing the occurrence of [2+2] cycloaddition. Driven by photodimerization, the needle&#8208;like crystals of BFO and NIO displayed evident photo&#8208;induced bending behavior. This work demonstrates that the intermolecular interactions around carbon&#8208;carbon double bond would affect the [2+2] cycloaddition reactivity except for Schmidt&#8217;s criteria. These findings provide valuable insights into the design of photomechanical molecular crystalline materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Phosphorus Dendrimers for Metal&#8208;Free Ligation: Design of Multivalent Pharmacological Chaperones against Gaucher Disease</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The first phosphorus dendrimers built on a cyclotriphosphazene core and decorated with six or twelve monofluorocyclooctyne units were prepared. A simple stirring allowed the grafting of N&#8208;hexyl deoxynojirimycin inhitopes onto their surface by copper&#8211;free strain promoted alkyne&#8208;azide cycloaddition click reaction. The synthesized iminosugars clusters were tested as multivalent inhibitors of the biologically relevant enzymes &#946;&#8208;glucocerebrosidase and acid &#945;&#8208;glucosidase, involved in Gaucher and Pompe lysosomal storage diseases, respectively. For both enzymes, all the multivalent compounds were more potent than the reference N&#8208;hexyl deoxynojirimycin. Remarkably, final dodecavalent compound proved to be one of the best &#946;&#8208;glucocerebrosidase inhibitors described to date. These cyclotriphosphazene&#8208;based deoxynojirimycin dendrimers were then evaluated as pharmacological chaperones against Gaucher disease. Not only did these multivalent constructs cross the cell membranes but they were also able to increase &#946;&#8208;glucocerebrosidase activity in Gaucher cells. Notably, dodecavalent compound allowed a 1.4&#8208;fold enzyme activity enhancement at a concentration as low as 100 nM. These new monofluorocyclooctyne&#8208;presenting dendrimers may further find numerous applications in the synthesis of multivalent objects for biological and pharmacological purposes.</dc:description>

         <title>Next Generation of Fluorometric Protease Assays: 7&#8208;Nitrobenz&#8208;2&#8208;oxa&#8208;1,3&#8208;diazol&#8208;4&#8208;yl&#8208;amides (NBD&#8208;Amides) as Class&#8208;Spanning Protease Substrates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fluorometric assays are one of the most frequently used methods in medicinal chemistry. Over the last 50 years, the reporter molecules for the detection of protease activity have evolved from first&#8208;generation colorimetric p&#8208;nitroanilides, through FRET substrates, and 7&#8208;amino&#8208;4&#8208;methyl coumarin (AMC)&#8208;based substrates. The aim of further substrate development is to increase sensitivity and reduce vulnerability to assay interferences. Here, we describe a new generation of substrates for protease assays based on 7&#8208;nitrobenz&#8208;2&#8208;oxa&#8208;1,3&#8208;diazol&#8208;4&#8208;yl&#8208;amides (NBD&#8208;amides). In this study, we synthesized and tested substrates for 10 different proteases from the serine&#8208;, cysteine&#8208;, and metalloprotease classes. Enzyme&#8208; and substrate&#8208;specific parameters as well as the inhibitory activity of literature&#8208;known inhibitors confirmed their suitability for application in fluorometric assays. Hence, we were able to present NBD&#8208;based alternatives for common protease substrates. In conclusion, these NBD substrates are not only less susceptible to common assay interference, but they are also able to replace FRET&#8208;based substrates with the requirement of a prime site amino acid residue.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Fluorometric assays are one of the most frequently used methods in medicinal chemistry. Over the last 50 years, the reporter molecules for the detection of protease activity have evolved from first-generation colorimetric p-nitroanilides, through FRET substrates, and 7-amino-4-methyl coumarin (AMC)-based substrates. The aim of further substrate development is to increase sensitivity and reduce vulnerability to assay interferences. Here, we describe a new generation of substrates for protease assays based on 7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl-amides (NBD-amides). In this study, we synthesized and tested substrates for 10 different proteases from the serine-, cysteine-, and metalloprotease classes. Enzyme- and substrate-specific parameters as well as the inhibitory activity of literature-known inhibitors confirmed their suitability for application in fluorometric assays. Hence, we were able to present NBD-based alternatives for common protease substrates. In conclusion, these NBD substrates are not only less susceptible to common assay interference, but they are also able to replace FRET-based substrates with the requirement of a prime site amino acid residue.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Double Dynamic Structural Change Enabling Tricolor Chromism by the Realization of Apparent Two&#8208;electron Transfer to Skip the Open&#8208;shell State</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Most redox systems generally cannot avoid the involvement of open&#8208;shell species upon generating multiply charged species, which often reduces reversibility in multi&#8208;color electrochromic systems. In this study, we newly synthesized octakis(aminophenyl)substituted pentacenebisquinodimethane (BQD) derivatives and their hybrids with alkoxyphenyl analogues. Thanks to apparent twoelectron transfer accompanied by double dramatic changes in the structure of the arylated quinodimethane skeleton, the dicationic and tetracationic states were generated and isolated quantitatively because of the negligible steady&#8208;state concentration of intermediary open&#8208;shell species such as monocation or trication radicals. When two electrophores with different donating abilities are attached to the BQD skeleton, a dicationic state with a different color can be isolated in addition to the neutral and tetracationic states. For the latter of these, an interchromophore interaction induces a red&#8208;shift of the NIR absorptions, thus realizing tricolor UV/Vis/NIR electrochromic behavior involving only closed&#8208;shell states.</dc:description>

         <title>Superionic Conductivity in Sodium Zirconium Chloride&#8208;Based Compounds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>All&#8208;solid&#8208;state sodium batteries are attracting intensive attention. Chloride&#8208;based solid electrolytes are promising candidates for use in all&#8208;solid&#8208;state sodium batteries because of their high chemical stability and low Young's modulus. Here, we report new superionic conductors based on polyanion&#8208;added chloride&#8208;based materials. Na0.67Zr(SO4)0.33Cl4 showed a high ionic conductivity of 1.6 mS cm&#8722;1 at room temperature. X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis indicated that the highly conducting materials are mainly a mixture of an amorphous phase and Na2ZrCl6. The conductivity might be dominated by the electronegativity of the central atom of the polyanion. Electrochemical measurements reveal that Na0.67Zr(SO4)0.33Cl4 is a sodium ionic conductor and is suitable for use as a solid electrolyte in all&#8208;solid&#8208;state sodium batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Optimising Electrical Interfacing between the Trimeric Copper Nitrite Reductase and Carbon Nanotubes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report the immobilization of copper&#8208;containing NiR from Alcaligenes faecalis on functionalised MWCNT electrodes. We demonstrate that this immobilization is mainly driven by hydrophobic interactions, promoted by the modification of MWCNTs with adamantyl groups. Direct electrochemistry shows high bioelectrochemical reduction of nitrite at the redox potential of NiR with high current density of 1.41 mA cm&#8208;2. Furthermore, the desymmetrization of the trimer upon immobilization induces an independent electrocatalytic behavior for each of the three enzyme subunits, corroborated by an electron&#8208;tunneling distance dependence.</dc:description>

         <title>Intrinsically Switchable Electroactive Fluorophores Based on &#955;5&#8208;Biphosphinines
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of &#955;5&#8208;biphosphinines is reported. &#955;5&#8208;Biphosphinines directly connected through a C&#8722;C bond in 4,4&#8208;position display two reversible oxidations highlighting their multi&#8208;stage redox character. In situ formed radicals are studied. Electrofluorochromism experiments revealed the potential of these intrinsically switchable electroactive fluorophores for applications as switchable materials.







Abstract
The synthesis and full characterization of a family of stable &#955;5&#8208;biphosphinines connected in 4,4&#8208;position through a variety of &#960;&#8208;conjugated bridges is reported. The impact of the &#960;&#8208;bridge on the optical (absorption/emission) and redox properties was investigated using a joint experimental/theoretical approach. In contrast to the &#960;&#8208;extended ones, the &#955;5&#8208;biphosphinines directly connected through a C&#8722;C bond in 4,4&#8208;position display two easily accessible and reversible oxidations highlighting their multi&#8208;stage redox character. The in&#8197;situ formed radical cations are studied by spectro&#8208;electrochemistry and electron paramagnetic resonance. Finally, electrochemical modulation of fluorescence (electrofluorochromism) was performed and revealed the potential of these intrinsically switchable electroactive fluorophores for further applications as switchable materials.

         <title>A Novel Nitridoborate Hydride Sr13[BN2]6H8 Elucidated from X&#8208;ray and Neutron Diffraction Data</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel strontium nitridoborate hydride was prepared in a solid&#8208;state synthesis at 950&#8201;&#176;C and extends the little&#8208;known family of nitridoborate hydrides. The crystal structure was elucidated from single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray and neutron powder diffraction data. MAS&#8197;NMR, FTIR and Raman spectroscopy support the structure model and the presence of anionic hydrogen. Quantum chemical calculations provide insight into the electronic structure.







Abstract
Metal hydrides are an uprising compound class bringing up various functional materials. Due to the low X&#8208;ray scattering power of hydrogen, neutron diffraction is often crucial to fully disclose the structural characteristics thereof. We herein present the second strontium nitridoborate hydride known so far, Sr13[BN2]6H8, formed in a solid&#8208;state reaction of the binary nitrides and strontium hydride at 950&#8201;&#176;C. The crystal structure was elucidated based on single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray and neutron powder diffraction in the hexagonal space group P63/m (no.&#8197;176), exhibiting a novel three&#8208;dimensional network of [BN2]3&#8722; units and hydride anions connected by strontium cations. Further analyses with magic angle spinning (MAS) NMR and vibrational spectroscopy corroborate the presence of anionic hydrogen within the structure. Quantum chemical calculations reveal the electronic properties and support the experimental outcome. Sr13[BN2]6H8 expands the emerging family of nitridoborate hydrides, broadening the access to an open field of new, intriguing materials.

         <title>Bora&#172;alkene s: Metal Coordination and Reactions with BH&#8208;boranes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The neutral N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene stabilized, &#8722;N=C=S substituted bora&#172;alkene was used as a &#960; ligand in transition metal complexes. Due to the C&#8208;nucleophilic nature of the bora&#172;alkene, it underwent regioselective hydroboration reactions with the boranes (C6F5)2BH or C6F5BH2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;SMe2. The latter reaction showed a subsequent hydride vs. isothiocyanate substituent exchange.







Abstract
The neutral N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene stabilized bora&#172;alkene 1, conveniently prepared by a BH borenium/hydroboration route, forms stable copper, gold or palladium &#960;&#8208;complexes. The polar bora&#172;alkene B=C system undergoes regioselective hydroboration reactions with the (C6F5)2BH or C6F5BH2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;SMe2 boranes. The latter reaction involves a subsequent rearrangement that leads to internal hydride vs. isothiocyanate substituent exchange at the borane pair.

Stapled peptides: The development of an i, i+7 diyne&#8208;girder stapling strategy that produces &#945;&#8208;helical, protease stable, cell permeable and Raman active stapled peptides.







Abstract
Stapled peptides are a unique class of cyclic &#945;&#8208;helical peptides that are conformationally constrained via their amino acid side&#8208;chains. They have been transformative to the field of chemical biology and peptide drug discovery through addressing many of the physicochemical limitations of linear peptides. However, there are several issues with current chemical strategies to produce stapled peptides. For example, two distinct unnatural amino acids are required to synthesize i, i+7 alkene stapled peptides, leading to high production costs. Furthermore, low purified yields are obtained due to cis/trans isomers produced during ring&#8208;closing metathesis macrocyclisation. Here we report the development of a new i, i+7 diyne&#8208;girder stapling strategy that addresses these issues. The asymmetric synthesis of nine unnatural Fmoc&#8208;protected alkyne&#8208;amino acids facilitated a systematic study to determine the optimal (S,S)&#8208;stereochemistry and 14&#8208;carbon diyne&#8208;girder bridge length. Diyne&#8208;girder stapled T&#8208;STAR peptide 29 was demonstrated to have excellent helicity, cell permeability and stability to protease degradation. Finally, we demonstrate that the diyne&#8208;girder constraint is a Raman chromophore with potential use in Raman cell microscopy. Development of this highly effective, bifunctional diyne&#8208;girder stapling strategy leads us to believe that it can be used to produce other stapled peptide probes and therapeutics.

         <title>Selective Nsp2&#8208; and Csp2&#8208; Photografting of Au&#8208;Surface by Aryldiazonium Salts and Arylazo Sulfonates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photografting of azosulfates Ar&#8722;N=NSO3Na on gold, leads to bonded organic films. Au&#8722;R or Au&#8722;N=N&#8722;R bonding results from a stepwise or concerted reaction respectively. Azosulfonates are shelf stable compounds which are much easier to handle with respect to the commonaryldiazonium salt.







Abstract
Arylazo sulfonates (Ar&#8722;N=N&#8722;SO3Na) have been found to undergo photografting on gold surface through both Au&#8722;Nsp2&#8722; and Au&#8722;Csp2&#8722; bond formation. The functionalized materials have been fully characterized by infrared reflection absorption spectroscopy (IRRAS), Raman, XPS, DFT calculations and UV&#8208;Vis absorption spectroscopy. These methods permit to evidence aromatic substituents (IRRAS), the Au&#8722;N=N signature (Raman and XPS spectroscopy), and the bond dissociation energy values of the two linkages (DFT calculation). The grafting proceeds through two competitive paths, namely a stepwise reaction involving an aryl radical (for the formation of the Au&#8722;Ar bonds) and a concerted reaction on the surface of gold (for Au&#8722;N=N&#8722;Ar bond formation). The occurrence of an aryl radical upon irradiation has been fully evidenced by EPR spectroscopy. Finally, E/Z photoisomerisation of the N=N bonds present on prepared few layer films has been observed by means of UV&#8208;Vis absorption spectroscopy.

         <title>From Framework to Layers Driven by Pressure &#8211; The Monophyllo&#8208;Oxonitridophosphate &#946;&#8208;MgSrP3N5O2 and Comparison to its &#945;&#8208;Polymorph</title>

         <dc:description>
With the discovery of &#946;&#8208;MgSrP3N5O2:Eu2+, an oxonitridophosphate with outstanding luminescence properties is presented. Structural comparison of the &#945;&#8208;phase already known from the literature with other classes of compounds allowed a possible basic structure to be predicted, which was confirmed experimentally. This approach could be applied to other (oxo)nitridophosphates known in the literature, leading to the discovery of additional host lattices for possible luminescent properties.







Abstract
Oxonitridophosphates exhibit the potential for broad structural diversity, making them promising host&#8208;compounds in phosphor&#8208;converted light&#8208;emitting diode applications. The novel monophyllo&#8208;oxonitridophosphate &#946;&#8208;MgSrP3N5O2 was obtained by using the high&#8208;pressure multianvil technique. The crystal structure was solved and refined based on single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction data and confirmed by powder X&#8208;ray diffraction. &#946;&#8208;MgSrP3N5O2 crystallizes in the orthorhombic space group Cmme (no. 67, a=8.8109(6), b=12.8096(6), c=4.9065(3) &#197;, Z=4) and has a structure related to that of Ba2CuSi2O7. DFT calculations were performed to investigate the phase transition from &#945;&#8208; to &#946;&#8208;MgSrP3N5O2 and to confirm the latter as the corresponding high&#8208;pressure polymorph. Furthermore, the luminescence properties of Eu2+ doped samples of both polymorphs were investigated and discussed, showing blue and cyan emission, respectively (&#945;&#8208;MgSrP3N5O2; &#955;max=438&#8197;nm, fwhm=46&#8197;nm/2396&#8197;cm&#8722;1; &#946;&#8208;MgSrP3N5O2; &#955;max=502&#8197;nm, fwhm=42&#8197;nm/1670&#8197;cm&#8722;1).

         <title>Balanced Energy Gaps as a Key Design Rule for Solution&#8208;Phase Organic Room Temperature Phosphorescence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Solution&#8208;phase room temperature phosphorescence is very rare in all&#8208;organic emitters. Here we show how this property can emerge as a function of energy gaps between the phosphorescent state and higher energy charge&#8208;transfer states. An optimal gap of &#8764;0.4&#8197;eV yields efficient phosphorescence, with smaller gaps leading to thermally activated delayed fluorescence and larger gaps allowing triplet&#8208;triplet annihilation to dominate.







Abstract
Metal&#8208;free organic emitters that display solution&#8208;phase room temperature phosphorescence (sRTP) remain exceedingly rare. Here, we investigate the structural and photophysical properties that support sRTP by comparing a recently reported sRTP compound (BTaz&#8722;Th&#8722;PXZ) to two novel analogous materials, replacing the donor group by either acridine or phenothiazine. The emissive triplet excited state remains fixed in all three cases, while the emissive charge&#8208;transfer singlet states (and the calculated paired charge&#8208;transfer T2 state) vary with the donor unit. While all three materials show dominant RTP in film, in solution different singlet&#8208;triplet and triplet&#8208;triplet energy gaps give rise to triplet&#8208;triplet annihilation followed by weak sRTP for the new compounds, compared to dominant sRTP throughout for the original PXZ material. Engineering both the sRTP state and higher charge&#8208;transfer states therefore emerges as a crucial element in designing emitters capable of sRTP.

         <title>Insight into the Structural and Emissive Behavior of a Three&#8208;Dimensional Americium(III) Formate Coordination Polymer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reported is the synthesis and characterization of a novel three&#8208;dimentional americium(III) formate coordination polymer, which features unique C3v site symmetry and atypical emission behavior. Rationalization of inner sphere bonding and unusual optical properties is supported by theoretical QTAIM and NLMO calculations.







Abstract
We report the structural, vibrational, and optical properties of americium formate (Am(CHO2)3) crystals synthesized via the in&#8197;situ hydrolysis of dimethylformamide (DMF). The coordination polymer features Am3+ ions linked by formate ligands into a three&#8208;dimensional network that is isomorphous to several lanthanide analogs, (e.&#8201;g., Eu3+, Nd3+, Tb3+). Structure determination revealed a nine&#8208;coordinate Am3+ metal center that features a unique local C3v symmetry. The metal&#8211;ligand bonding interactions were investigated by vibrational spectroscopy, natural localized molecular orbital calculations, and the quantum theory of atoms in molecules. The results paint a predominantly ionic bond picture and suggest the metal&#8208;oxygen bonds increase in strength from Nd&#8722;O&lt;Eu&#8722;O&lt;Am&#8722;O. The optical properties were probed using diffuse reflectance and photoluminescence spectroscopies. Notably, the rarely reported 5D1&#8242;&#8594;7F0&#8242; emission band is observed and dominates the emission spectrum. This behavior is unusual and is attributed to the C3v coordination environment of the metal center.

         <title>Promoting Amination of Furfural to Furfurylamine by Metal&#8208;support Interactions on Pd/MoO3&#8208;x Catalysts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The reductive amination of carbonyl compounds is one of the most straightforward protocols to construct C&#8208;N bonds, but highly desires active and selective catalysts. Herein, Pd/MoO3&#8208;x catalysts are proposed for furfural amination, in which the interactions between Pd nanoparticles and MoO3&#8208;x supports can be easily ameliorated via varying preparation temperature toward efficient catalytic turnover. Thanks to the synergistic cooperation of MoV&#8208;rich MoO3&#8208;x and highly&#8208;dispersed Pd, the optimal catalysts afford the high yield of furfurylamine (84%) at 80 oC. Thereinto, MoV species not only acts as the acidic promoter to facilitate the activation of carbonyl groups, but also interacts with Pd nanoparticles to promote the subsequent hydrogenolysis of Schiff base N&#8208;furfurylidenefurfurylamine and its germinal diamine. The good efficiency of Pd/MoO3&#8208;x within a broad substrate scope further highlights the key contribution of metal&#8208;support interactions to the refinery of biomass feedstocks.</dc:description>

         <title>Fibrils Emerging from Droplets: Molecular Guiding Principles behind Phase Transitions of a Short Peptide&#8208;Based Condensate Studied by Solid&#8208;State NMR</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Biochemical reactions occurring in highly crowded cellular environments require different means of control to ensure productivity and specificity. Compartmentalization of reagents by liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation is one of these means. However, extremely high local protein concentrations of up to 400 mg/ml can result in pathological aggregation into fibrillar amyloid structures, a phenomenon that has been linked to various neurodegenerative diseases. Despite its relevance, the process of liquid&#8208;to&#8208;solid transition inside condensates is still not well understood at the molecular level. We thus herein use small peptide derivatives that can undergo both liquid&#8208;liquid and subsequent liquid&#8208;to&#8208;solid phase transition as model systems to study both processes. Using solid&#8208;state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM), we compare the structure of condensed states of leucine, tryptophan and phenylalanine containing derivatives, distinguishing between liquid&#8208;like condensates, amorphous aggregates and fibrils, respectively. A structural model for the fibrils formed by the phenylalanine derivative was obtained by an NMR&#8208;based structure calculation. The fibrils are stabilised by hydrogen bonds and side&#8208;chain &#960;&#8208;&#960; interactions, which are likely much less pronounced or absent in the liquid and amorphous state. Such noncovalent interactions are equally important for the liquid&#8208;to&#8208;solid transition of proteins, particularly those related to neurodegenerative diseases.</dc:description>

The fibrils are stabilised by hydrogen bonds and side-chain &#960;-&#960; interactions, which are likely much less pronounced or absent in the liquid and amorphous state. Such noncovalent interactions are equally important for the liquid-to-solid transition of proteins, particularly those related to neurodegenerative diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Electrochemical Preparation of Sm(II) Reagent Facilitated by Weakly Coordinating Anions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Samarium diiodide (SmI2) is widely used as a strong one&#8208;electron reducing agent and is often employed to form C&#8208;&#8208;C bonds in complex systems. Despite their utility, SmI2 and related salts suffer from several drawbacks that render the use of Sm reducing agents in large&#8208;scale synthesis impractical. Here, we report factors influencing the electrochemical reduction of Sm(III) to Sm(II), towards the goal of electrocatalyti Sm(III) reduction. We probe the effect of supporting electrolyte, electrode material, and Sm precursor on Sm(II)/(III) redox and on the reducing power of the Sm species. We find that the coordination strength of the counteranion of the Sm salt affects the reversibility and redox potential of the Sm(II)/(III) couple and establish that the counteranion primarily determines the reducibility of Sm(III). Electrochemically generated SmI2 performs similarly to commercial SmI2 solutions in a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept reaction. The results will provide fundamental insight to facilitate the development of Sm&#8208;electrocatalytic reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Tuning Mechanically Interlocked Molecules to Recognize Anions and Cations: A Computational Study</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Anions and cations develop several roles in nature. Thus, compounds capable to interact with ions show large relevancy. Mechanically interlocked molecules (MIMs) appear as potential candidates to perform efficient ionic recognition. Here, DFT calculations have been realized to elucidate and tune the MIM&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;(anion and/or cation) chemical bonds and compare them with the acyclic/cyclic molecular structures&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;(anion and/or cation) interactions.







Abstract
Ions appear as active components in diverse materials. Here, the bonding energy between mechanically interlocked molecules (MIMs) or their acyclic/cyclic molecular derivatives and i) Cl&#8722; and Br&#8722; ions and/or ii) Na+ and K+ ions, have been investigated. The chemical environment provided by MIMs is less preferably to recognize ionic species compared to unconstrained interactions that are furnished by acyclic molecules. However, MIMs can be more adequate structures for ionic recognition than cyclic compounds if a chemical arrangement of the bond sites that relevantly support more favorable interactions with ions compared to Pauli repulsive ambient is provided. The hydrogen replacement by electron donor (&#8722;NH2) or acceptor (&#8722;NO2) groups in MIMs favors the anion/cation recognition due to decreased Pauli repulsion energy and/or more attractive non&#8208;covalent bonds. This study clarifies the chemical environment provided by MIMs to interact with ions and highlights these molecules as relevant structures to realize ionic sensing.

         <title>Template&#8208;assisted Fabrication of O&#8208;doped CoP Microflowers with Optimal Electronic Modulation for Electrochemical Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, the O&#8208;doped CoP microflowers are synthesized via a self&#8208;sacrificial reactive template&#8208;engaged strategy. Benefiting from the structural and compositional advantages, the obtained sample with optimal electronic structure exhibits the excellent hydrogen evolution performance.







Abstract
Exploring efficient, affordable and stable electrocatalyst toward hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is of great scientific significance for the practical implementation of the water splitting. The heteroatom doping represents a serviceable strategy to further elevate the catalytic performance for a transition metal&#8208;based electrocatalyst because of the electronic regulation effect. Herein, a reliable self&#8208;sacrificial template&#8208;engaged approach is proposed to synthesize O&#8208;doped CoP (denoted as O&#8208;CoP) microflowers, which simultaneously considers the regualtion of electronic configuration via anion doping and sufficient exposure of active sites via nanostructure engineering. The suitable O incorporation content in CoP matrix could tremendously modify the electronic configuration, accelerate the charge transfer, promote the exposure of active sites, strengthen the electrical conductivity, and adjust the adsorption state of H*. Consequently, the optimized O&#8208;CoP microflowers with optimal O concentration display a remarkable HER property with a small overpotential of 125&#8197;mV to afford a current density of 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, a low Tafel slope of 68&#8197;mV&#8201;dec&#8722;1 and long&#8208;term durability for 32&#8197;h under alkaline electrolyte, manifesting a considerable potential application for hydrogen production at large scale. The integration of anion incorporation and architecture engineering in this work will bring in a depth insight for the design of low&#8208;cost and effective electrocatalysts in energy conversion and storage systems.

         <title>Piezochromism and Conductivity Modulations under High Pressure by Manipulating the Viologen Radical Concentration</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Manipulating the  radical concentration to modulate the properties in solid multifunctional materials is an attractive topic in various frontier fields. Viologens have the unique redox capability to generate radical states through reversible electron transfer (ET) under external stimuli. Herein, taking the viologens as the model, two kinds of crystalline compounds with different molecule&#8208;conjugated systems were designed and synthesized. By subjecting the specific model viologens to pressure, the cross&#8208;conjugated 2&#8208;X all exhibit much higher radical concentrations, along with more sensitive piezochromic behaviors, compared to the linear&#8208;conjugated 1&#8208;X. Unexpectedly, we find that the electrical resistance (R) of 1&#8208;NO3 decreased by three orders of magnitude with the increasing pressure, while that in high&#8208;radical&#8208;concentration 2&#8208;NO3remained almost unchanged. To date, such unusual invariant conductivity has not been documented in molecular&#8208;based materials under high pressure, breaking the conventional wisdom that the generations of radicals are beneficial to improve conductivity. We highlight that adjusting the molecular conjugation modes can be used as an effective way to regulate the radical concentrations and thus modulate properties rationally.</dc:description>

         <title>Polymers of Intrinsic Microporosity based on Dibenzodioxin Linkage: Design, Synthesis, Properties and Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Development of polymers of intrinsic microporosity (PIMs) over the last two decades have established them as a distinct class of microporous materials, which combine the attributes of microporous solid materials and soluble nature of glassy polymers. Because of their solubility in common organic solvents, PIMs are easily processable materials that can potentially find applications in membrane&#8208;based separation, catalysis, ion separation in electrochemical energy storage devices, sensing, etc. Dibenzodioxin linkage, Tr&#246;ger&#8242;s base and imide bond&#8208;forming reactions have widely been utilized for synthesis of a large number of PIMs. Among these linkages, however, majority of the studies have been based on dibenzodioxin&#8208;based PIMs. Therefore, this review focuses precisely on dibenzodioxin linkage chemistry. Herein, we discuss the design principles of different rigid and contorted monomer scaffolds, synthetic strategies of the polymers through dibenzodioxin&#8208;forming reactions including copolymerization and postsynthetic modifications, their characteristic properties and potential applications studied so far. Towards the end, we discuss the prospects of these materials with respect to their utility in industrial purposes. Further, we analyze the structure&#8208;property correlation of dibenzodioxin PIMs, which is essential for tailored synthesis and tunable properties of these PIMs and their molecular level engineering for enhanced performances making these materials suitable for commercial usage.</dc:description>

Outstanding thermal long term stabilities main&#173;&#173;taining 96% of the initial performance after 1 month of continuous illumination and ope&#173;ra&#173;&#173;tion were mea&#173;sured. In the series of do&#173;&#173;nor&#8208;acceptor dyads, D1&#8208;D4, the so far best perfor&#173;ming dyad D4 is built up in a &#8220;T&#8208;shaped&#8221; fashion, whereby the &#960;&#8208;con&#173;juga&#173;ted dithie&#173;no&#173;pyrrole&#8208;cored oligo&#173;thio&#173;phene do&#173;nor is covalently connected to a C70&#8208;ful&#173;le&#173;rene acceptor by a flexible alkyl ester linker comprising 8 atoms.

         <title>Cyclotrimerization Approach to Symmetric [9]&#8208;Helical Indenofluorenes: Diverting Cyclization Pathways</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Catalytic cyclotrimerization routes to symmetrical [9]helical indenofluorene were explored by using different transition metal complexes and thermal conditions. Depending on reaction conditions, the cyclotrimerizations were accompanied by dehydro&#8208;Diels&#8208;Alder reaction giving rise to another type of aromatic compounds. Structures of both symmetrical [9]helical cyclotrimerization product as well as the dehydro&#8208;Diels&#8208;Alder product were confirmed by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analyses. Limits of enantioselective cyclotrimerization were assessed as well. DFT calculations shed light on the reaction course and the origin of diminished enantioselectivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Rapid Access to Encapsulated Molecular Rotors via Coordination&#8208;Driven Macrocycle Formation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Macrocycle formation that relies upon trans metal coordination of appropriately placed pyridine ligands within an arylene ethynylene construct provides rapid and reliable access to molecular rotors encapsulated within the macrocyclic framework. Showing no significant close contacts to the central rotors, X&#8208;ray crystallography of Ag(I)&#8208;coordinated macrocycles provides plausibility for free rotation or wobbling of rotors within the central cavity. Solid&#8208;state 13C NMR of Pd(II)&#8208;coordinated macrocycles supports the notion of unobstructed movement of simple arenes in the crystal lattice. Solution 1H NMR studies indicate complete and immediate macrocycle formation upon introduction of Pd(II) to the pyridyl&#8208;based ligand at room temperature. Moreover, the formed macrocycle is stable in solution; a lack of significant changes in the 1H NMR spectrum upon cooling to &#8208;50 &#176;C is consistent with the absence of dynamic behavior. The synthetic route to these macrocycles is expedient and modular, providing access to rather complex constructs in four simple steps involving Sonogashira coupling and deprotection reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Smart Wearable Patches Using Light&#8208;Controlled Activation and Delivery of Photoswitchable Antimicrobial Peptides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A novel strategy to treat Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) skin infections is presented, where UV light is used to facilitate concomitant light&#8208;controlled activation and delivery of an antimicrobial therapeutic agent. Specifically, a new photoswitchable gramicidin S analogue was immobilized onto a polymeric wearable patch via a photocleavable linker that undergoes photolysis at the same wavelength of light required for activation of the peptide. Unlike toxic gramicidin S, the liberated active photoswitchable peptide exhibits antimicrobial activity against S. aureus while being ostensibly non&#8208;haemolytic to red blood cells. Moreover, irradiation with visible light switches off the antimicrobial properties of the peptide within seconds, presenting an ideal strategy to regulate antibiotic activity for localized bacterial infections with the potential to mitigate resistance.</dc:description>

         <title>Photocatalyzed (3+2) Cycloaddition for the Dearomatization of Electron&#8208;poor Arenes under Flow Conditions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The photocatalyzed dearomative reaction between various electron&#8208;deficient aromatic compounds and a non&#8208;stabilized azomethine ylide is successfully performed in a flow system. Whereas the use of supported eosin as organic photocatalyst exhibits limited efficiency, turning to the soluble Rose Bengal allows to transform a broad range of substrates from hetarenes (indole, benzofuran, quinoline, pyridine) to naphthalenes and benzenes. This photocatalyzed (3+2) dearomative cycloaddition under green light irradiation provides a simple and efficient access to tridimensional pyrrolidino scaffolds with a tetrasubstituted carbon center at ring junction and can be performed in the friendly ethyl acetate. Computational studies support the mechanism involving azomethine ylide as reactive species toward the electron&#8208;poor arene.</dc:description>

         <title>Harnessing Pillar[5]arene Host&#8208;Guest Complexation to Improve pH Stability and Affect Enzymatic Degradation of the Anticancer Prodrug Capecitabine: A 19F&#8208;NMR Study</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Abstract: Cancer is a global health problem and supramolecular chemotherapy is emerging as a novel strategy to battle the disease. Here we first evaluated the thermodynamic and the kinetic stability of the complexes formed between several water&#8208;soluble per&#8208;substituted pillar[5]arene derivatives and capecitabine (1), a widely used oral chemotherapeutic prodrug. The exchange rate was studied, for the first time in pillararene chemistry, by the 19F guest exchange saturation transfer (GEST) NMR technique. Importantly, when we evaluated the effect of complexation on the characteristics of 1, we found that the complexation of 1 with such pillar[5]arene hosts increased capecitabine stability at acidic pH very significantly and slowed its enzymatic degradation by the carboxylesterase enzyme in a manner that depended on the host. These interesting findings may have implications on clinical use of this heavily used prodrug and may affect the management of cancer patients.</dc:description>

         <title>Intramolecular Palladium Catalyst Transfer on Benzoheterodiazoles as Acceptor Monomers and Discovery of Catalyst Transfer Inhibitors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Intramolecular catalyst transfer on benzoheterodiazoles was investigated in Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura coupling reactions and polymerization reactions with tBu3PPd precatalyst. In the coupling reactions of dibromobenzotriazole, dibromobenzoxazole, and dibromobenzothiadiazole with pinacol phenylboronate, the product ratios of monosubstituted product to disubstituted product were 0/100, 27/73, and 89/11, respectively, indicating that the Pd catalyst undergoes intramolecular catalyst transfer on dibromobenzotriazole, whereas intermolecular transfer occurs in part in the case of dibromobenzoxazole and is predominant for dibromobenzothiadiazole. The polycondensation of 1.3 equivalents of dibromobenzotriazole with 1.0 equivalent of para&#8208; and meta&#8208;phenylenediboronates afforded high&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight polymer and cyclic polymer, respectively. In the case of dibromobenzoxazole, however, para&#8208; and meta&#8208;phenylenediboronates afforded moderate&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight polymer with bromine at both ends and cyclic polymer, respectively. In the case of dibromobenzothiadiazole, they afforded low&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight polymers with bromine at both ends. Addition of benzothiadiazole derivatives interfered with catalyst transfer in the coupling reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Multiply exo&#8208;Methylated Corannulenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The curved &#960;&#8208;conjugated surface of bowl&#8208;shaped corannulene is multiply methylated to form exo&#8208;di&#8208;, tetra&#8208;, and hexamethylated corannulenes. The multimethylations have become possible by in&#8208;situ iterative reduction/methylation sequences that involve the reduction of corannulenes using sodium to form the anionic corannulene species and the subsequent SN2 reaction of the anionic species with reduction&#8208;resistant dimethyl sulfate. X&#8208;ray diffraction analyses, NMR, MS, UV&#8208;Vis measurements, and DFT calculations have revealed the molecular structures of the multi&#8208;methylated corannulenes and the sequence of the multi&#8208;methylation. This work has the potential to contribute to the controlled synthesis and characterizations of multi&#8208;functionalized fullerenes.</dc:description>

         <title>Squaramide&#8208;based Heteroditopic [2]Rotaxanes for Sodium Halide Ion&#8208;pair Recognition</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A series of squaramide&#8208;based heteroditopic [2]rotaxanes consisting of isophthalamide macrocycle and squaramide axle components are synthesised using an alkali metal cation template&#8208;directed stoppering methodology. This work highlights the unprecedented sodium cation template coordination of the Lewis basic squaramide carbonyls for interlocked structure synthesis. Extensive quantitative 1H&#8208;NMR spectroscopic anion and ion&#8208;pair recognition studies reveal the [2]rotaxane hosts are capable of cooperative sodium halide ion&#8208;pair mechanical bond axle&#8208;macrocycle component recognition, eliciting up to 20&#8208;fold enhancements in binding strengths for bromide and iodide, wherein the Lewis basic carbonyls and Lewis acidic NH hydrogen bond donors of the squaramide axle motif operate as cation and anion receptive sites simultaneously in an ambidentate fashion. Notably, varying the length and nature of the polyether cation binding unit of the macrocycle component dramatically influences the ion&#8208;pair binding affinities of the [2]rotaxanes, even overcoming direct contact NaCl ion&#8208;pair binding modes in polar organic solvents. Furthermore, the cooperative ion&#8208;pair binding properties of the squaramide&#8208;based heteroditopic [2]rotaxanes are exploited to successfully extract solid sodium halide salts into organic media.</dc:description>

         <title>External Flash Generation of Carbenoids Enables Monodeuteration of Dihalomethanes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this study, incorporation of one deuterium atom was achieved by H&#8722;D exchange of one of the two identical methylene protons in various dihalomethanes (halogen = Cl, Br, and I) through a rapid&#8208;mixing microflow reaction of lithium diisopropylamide as a strong base and deuterated methanol as a deuteration reagent. Generation of highly unstable carbenoid intermediate and suppression of its decomposition were successfully controlled under high flow&#8208;rate conditions. Monofunctionalization of diiodomethane afforded various building blocks composed of boryl, stannyl, and silyl groups. The monodeuterated diiodomethane, which served as a deuterated C1 source, was subsequently subjected to diverted functionalization methods to afford various products including biologically important molecules bearing isotope labelling at specific positions and homologation products with monodeuteration.</dc:description>

         <title>Surface Engineering in Covalent Organic Polymers for High&#8208;Performance Li&#8208;S Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lithium&#8208;sulfur (Li&#8208;S) batteries are promising energy storage technology due to their tempting high theoretical capacity and energy density. Nevertheless, the wastage of active materials that originates from the shuttling effect of polysulfides still hinders advancement of Li&#8208;S batteries. The effective design of cathode materials is extremely pivotal to solve this thorny problem. Herein, Surface engineering in covalent organic polymers (COPs) has been performed to investigate the influence of pore wall polarity on the performance of COP&#8208;based cathodes used for Li&#8208;S batteries. With the assistance of experimental investigation and theoretical calculations, performance improvement by increasing pore surface polarity and a synergy effect of the polarized functionalities, along with nano&#8208;confinement effect of the COPs, are disclosed, to which the improved performance of Li&#8208;S batteries including outstanding Coulombic efficiency (99.0%) and extremely low capacity decay (0.08% over 425 cycles at 1.0 C) is attributed. This work not only enlightens the designable synthesis and applications of covalent polymers as polar sulfur hosts with high utilization of active materials, but also provides a feasible guide for the design of effective cathode materials for future advanced Li&#8208;S batteries.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>NiFe&#8208;layered double hydroxide (NiFe&#8208;LDH) is the benchmark catalyst for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline medium, however, it is still challenging to improve its activity and stability. Herein, NiFe&#8208;LDH macroporous array electrodes are demonstrated to significantly enhance the activity and stability for oxygen evolution reaction. The electrodes are fabricated by the chemical and electrochemical corrosion process of Ni foam induced by ferric nitrate, hydrochloric acid and oxygen. are prepared by a controllable corrosion strategy for oxygen evolution reaction. By optimizing the amount of iron salt and acid and selecting the appropriate reaction temperature and time, The NiFe&#8208;LDH electrodes only need the overpotential of 180 mV and 248 mV to reach the current density of 10 mA cm&#8208;2 and 500 mA cm&#8208;2, respectively, and remain highly stable for 1000 h at 500 mA cm&#8208;2. The unique macroporous array not only significantly increases the active area of NiFe&#8208;LDH catalyst, but also creates a stable nanostructure that avoids severe reconstruction.</dc:description>

         <title>Light&#8208;Promoted Basic Nitrogen Unmasking in Arene Ruthenium Complexes Derived from Z&#8208;configured 2,2'&#8208;Azobispyridine</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two novel 2,2'&#8208;azobispyridine derivatives bearing N&#8208;dialkylamino substituents at position 4,4' were synthesized and their E&#8208;Z photoswitching behavior was characterized by combination of 1H&#8208; and 13C&#8208;NMR spectroscopy, UV&#8208;vis absorption and DFT calculations. Both isomers act as ligands towards arene&#8208;Ru(II) centers, leading either to E&#8208;configured 5&#8208;membered chelates (involving coordination of nitrogen atoms from N=N bond and pyridine) or to the uncommon Z&#8208;configured 7&#8208;membered chelates (involving coordination of nitrogen atoms from both pyridines). The latter show good stability in the dark, allowing single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction study to be reported here for the first time. All synthesized Z&#8208;configured arene&#8208;Ru(II) complexes undergo irreversible photo&#8208;isomerization to their corresponding E isomers with rearrangement of their coordination pattern; this property was advantageously exploited for the light&#8208;promoted unmasking of a basic nitrogen atom of the ligand.</dc:description>

         <title>Stable and reusable Fe3O4/ZIF&#8208;8 composite for encapsulation of FDH enzyme in mild conditions applicable to CO2 reduction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The enzymatic reduction of carbon dioxide presents limited applicability due to denaturation and the impossibility of biocatalyst recovery; disadvantages that can be minimized by its immobilization. Here, a recyclable bio&#8208;composed system was constructed by in situ encapsulation in mild conditions of formate dehydrogenase enzyme in the ZIF&#8208;8 metalorganic framework (MOF) in the presence of magnetite. The partial dissolution of ZIF&#8208;8 in the enzyme&#8217;s operation media can be relatively inhibited if the concentration of magnetic support used exceeds 10 mg mL&#8208;1. The bio&#8208;friendly environment for immobilization does not harm the integrity of the biocatalyst while the production of formic acid is improved 3.4&#8208;fold compared to the free enzyme because the MOFs act as a concentrator of the enzymatic cofactor. Furthermore, the bio&#8208;composed system retains 86 % of its activity after a long&#8208;time of 5 cycles, indicating an excellent magnetic recovery capacity and a good reusability.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The enzymatic reduction of carbon dioxide presents limited applicability due to denaturation and the impossibility of biocatalyst recovery; disadvantages that can be minimized by its immobilization. Here, a recyclable bio-composed system was constructed by in situ encapsulation in mild conditions of formate dehydrogenase enzyme in the ZIF-8 metalorganic framework (MOF) in the presence of magnetite. The partial dissolution of ZIF-8 in the enzyme&#8217;s operation media can be relatively inhibited if the concentration of magnetic support used exceeds 10 mg mL-1. The bio-friendly environment for immobilization does not harm the integrity of the biocatalyst while the production of formic acid is improved 3.4-fold compared to the free enzyme because the MOFs act as a concentrator of the enzymatic cofactor. Furthermore, the bio-composed system retains 86 % of its activity after a long-time of 5 cycles, indicating an excellent magnetic recovery capacity and a good reusability.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Steric Control over the Threading of Pyrophosphonates with One or Two Cyanostar Macrocycles during Pseudorotaxane Formation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Control over the binding stoichiometry and the threading kinetics is achieved in pseudorotaxanes comprising the anion&#8208;binding cyanostar macrocycle and organic pyrophosphonates with fine&#8208;tuned steric bulk. The approach allowed the selective assembly of [3]pseudorotaxanes and [2]pseudorotaxanes, and it provided insights that are valuable for future work on anion recognition and the design of molecular machines.







Abstract
The supramolecular recognition of anions is increasingly harnessed to achieve the self&#8208;assembly of supramolecular architectures, ranging from cages and polymers to (pseudo)rotaxanes. The cyanostar (CS) macrocycle has previously been shown to form 2&#8201;:&#8201;1 complexes with organophosphate anions that can be turned into [3]rotaxanes by stoppering. Here we achieved steric control over the assembly of pseudorotaxanes comprising the cyanostar macrocycle and a thread that is based, for the first time, on organo&#8208;pyrophosphonates. Subtle differences in steric bulk on the threads allowed formation of either [3]pseudorotaxanes or [2]pseudorotaxanes. We demonstrate that the threading kinetics are governed by the steric demand of the organo&#8208;pyrophosphonates and in one case, slows down to the timescale of minutes. Calculations show that the dianions are sterically offset inside the macrocycles. Our findings broaden the scope of cyanostar&#8208;anion assemblies and may have relevance for the design of molecular machines whose directionality is a result of relatively slow slipping.

         <title>Radical&#8208;Based Convergent Paired Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Radical&#8208;based convergent paired electrolysis, which is driven by inexpensive electricity, is a green and unique approach to otherwise challenging redox&#8208;neutral reactions. The difficulty associated with the technique is imposed by the fleeting nature of radicals and the gap between electrodes. This concept article introduces recent state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art advances in this field and discusses how to overcome the obstacles.







Abstract
Electrochemistry offers a sustainable platform for discovering reactions involving single&#8208;electron transfer (SET) that generates highly reactive and synthetically versatile radical species. Compared with photochemistry similarly specializing in SET which requires expensive photocatalysts, electrochemistry employs low&#8208;cost electricity to drive the electron flow. Paired electrolysis makes use of both half&#8208;reactions, thus obviating the need for sacrificial reactions and maximizing the atom and energy economy. In convergent paired electrolysis, anodic oxidation and cathodic reduction occur simultaneously to generate two intermediates, which are then coupled to furnish the product. It represents a distinctive approach to challenging redox&#8208;neutral reactions. However, the gap between the two electrodes makes it hard for a reactive intermediate to come across the other coupling partner. This concept article summarizes recent state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art advances on radical&#8208;based convergent paired electrolysis, which adopted different strategies to overcome the difficulty.

         <title>Highly Electrophilic Mononuclear Cationic Aluminum Alkoxide Complexes: Syntheses, Reactivity and Catalytic Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we report on the synthesis of &#946;&#8208;diketiminate supported aluminum complexes bearing terminal alkoxide and mono&#8208;thiol functional groups: LAlOMe(Et) (2), LAlOtBu(Et) (3), and LAlSH(Et) (4), (L= [HC{C(Me)N&#8208;(2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3)}2]). Complexes 2 and 3 are further utilized as synthons to generate some fascinating cationic aluminum alkoxide complexes, [LAlOMe(&#181;&#8208;OMe)&#8208;Al(Et)L][EtB(C6F5)3] (5), [LAlOMe(OEt2)][EtB(C6F5)3] (6), and [LAlOtBu(OEt2)][EtB(C6F5)3] (8). These electrophilic cationic species are well characterized by spectroscopic and crystallographic techniques. The assessment of Lewis acidity by the Gutmann&#8208;Beckett method revealed superior Lewis acidity of the cations substituted with electron demanding alkoxy groups in comparison to the known methyl analogue [LAlMe][B(C6F5)4]. This has been further endorsed by computational calculations to determine the NBO charges and hydride ion affinity for complexes 6 and 8. These complexes are also capable of activating triethylsilane in stoichiometric reactions. The applicability of these complexes has been realized in the hydrosilylation of ethers, carbonyls, and olefines. Additionally, the solid state structure of a new THF stabilized aluminum halide cation [LAlCl(THF)][B(C6F5)4] (11) has also been reported.</dc:description>

         <title>Rapid Chemical Synthesis of Serine Protease Inhibitor Kazal&#8208;type 13 (SPINK13) Glycoform by a Combined Method with Glycan Insertion Strategy and Fast&#8208;Flow Fmoc SPPS

Glycosylated asparagine thioacid was designed to chemoselectively be inserted between two peptide segments at the sterically bulky amino acids sequence Pro&#8208;Asn(N&#8208;glycan)&#8208;Val junction by two coupling reactions which consist of diacyl disulfide coupling (DDC) and thioacid capture ligation (TCL). The both N and C terminus peptides were prepared by a fast&#8208;flow Fmoc SPPS method. A combined method with DDC, TCL and a fast&#8208;flow Fmoc SPPS method successfully shortened the route of glycoprotein synthesis.







Abstract
Serine protease inhibitor Kazal type 13 (SPINK13) is a secreted protein that has been recently studied as a therapeutic drug and an interesting biomarker for cancer cells. Although SPINK13 has a consensus sequence (Pro&#8208;Asn&#8208;Val&#8208;Thr) for N&#8208;glycosylation, the existence of N&#8208;glycosylation and its functions are still unclear. In addition to this, the preparation of glycosylated SPINK 13 has not been examined by both the cell expression method and chemical synthesis. Herein we report the chemical synthesis of the scarce N&#8208;glycosylated form of SPINK13 by a rapid synthetic method combined with the chemical glycan insertion strategy and a fast&#8208;flow SPPS method. Glycosylated asparagine thioacid was designed to chemoselectively be inserted between two peptide segments where is the sterically bulky Pro&#8208;Asn(N&#8208;glycan)&#8208;Val junction by two coupling reactions which consist of diacyl disulfide coupling (DDC) and thioacid capture ligation (TCL). This insertion strategy successfully afforded the full&#8208;length polypeptide of SPINK13 within two steps from glycosylated asparagine thioacid. Because the two peptides used for this synthesis were prepared by a fast&#8208;flow SPPS, the total synthetic time of glycoprotein was considerably shortened. This synthetic concept enables us to repetitively synthesize a target glycoprotein easily. Folding experiments afforded well&#8208;folded structure confirmed by CD and disulfide bond map. Invasion assays of glycosylated SPINK13 and non&#8208;glycosylated SPINK13 with pancreatic cancer cells showed that non&#8208;glycosylated SPINK&#8208;13 was more potent than that of glycosylated SPINK13.

         <title>Highly Soluble Cyclic Organoalanes Based on Anionic Dicarbenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cyclic organoalane compounds [(ADCAr)AlH2]2 (ADCAr = ArC{(DippN)C}2; Dipp = 2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3; Ar = Ph or 4&#8208;PhC6H4 (Bp)) based on anionic dicarbene (ADC) frameworks have been reported as crystalline solids. Treatments of Li(ADCAr) with LiAlH4 at room temperature afford [(ADCAr)AlH2]2 with the concomitant release of LiH. Compounds [(ADCAr)AlH2]2 are stable crystalline solids and are freely soluble in common organic solvents. They are annulated tricyclic compounds with an almost planar central C4Al2&#8208;core embedded between two peripheral 1,3&#8208;imidazole (C3N2) rings. At room temperature, [(ADCPh)AlH2]2 readily reacts with CO2 to form two&#8208; and four&#8208;fold hydroalumination products [(ADCPh)AlH(OCHO)]2 and [(ADCPh)Al(OCHO)2]2, respectively.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Cyclic organoalane compounds [(ADCAr)AlH2]2 (ADCAr = ArC{(DippN)C}2; Dipp = 2,6-iPr2C6H3; Ar = Ph or 4-PhC6H4 (Bp)) based on anionic dicarbene (ADC) frameworks have been reported as crystalline solids. Treatments of Li(ADCAr) with LiAlH4 at room temperature afford [(ADCAr)AlH2]2 with the concomitant release of LiH. Compounds [(ADCAr)AlH2]2 are stable crystalline solids and are freely soluble in common organic solvents. They are annulated tricyclic compounds with an almost planar central C4Al2-core embedded between two peripheral 1,3-imidazole (C3N2) rings. At room temperature, [(ADCPh)AlH2]2 readily reacts with CO2 to form two- and four-fold hydroalumination products [(ADCPh)AlH(OCHO)]2 and [(ADCPh)Al(OCHO)2]2, respectively. Further hydroalumination reactivity of [(ADCAr)AlH2]2 has been shown with isocyanate (RNCO) and isothiocyanate (RNCS) species (R = alkyl or aryl group). All compounds have been characterized by NMR spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, and single crystal X-ray diffraction.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ultrasmall Gold Nanoparticles as Clients of Biomolecular Condensates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation (LLPS) of biopolymers to form condensates is a widespread phenomenon in living cells. Agents that target or alter condensation can help uncover elusive physiological and pathological mechanisms. Owing to their unique material properties and modes of interaction with biomolecules, nanoparticles represent attractive condensate&#8208;targeting agents.
Our work focused on elucidating the interaction between ultrasmall gold nanoparticles (usGNPs) and diverse types of condensates of tau, a representative phase&#8208;separating protein associated with neurodegenerative disorders. usGNPs attract considerable interest in the biomedical community due to unique features, including emergent optical properties and good cell penetration. We explored the interaction of usGNPs with reconstituted self&#8208;condensates of tau, two&#8208;component tau/polyanion and three&#8208;component tau/RNA/alpha&#8208;synuclein coacervates.
The usGNPs were found to concentrate into condensed liquid droplets, consistent with the formation of dynamic client (nanoparticle) &#8211; scaffold (tau) interactions, and were observable thanks to their intrinsic luminescence. Furthermore, usGNPs were capable to promote LLPS of a protein domain which is unable to phase separate on its own.
Our study demonstrates the ability of usGNPs to interact with and illuminate protein condensates. We anticipate that nanoparticles will have broad applicability as nanotracers to interrogate phase separation, and as nanoactuators controlling the formation and dissolution of condensates.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of neuraminidase&#8208;resistant sialyllactose mimetics from Nacyl mannosamines using metabolically engineered Escherichia coli</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we describe the efficient gram&#8208;scale synthesis of &#945;2,3&#8208; and &#945;2,6&#8208;sialyllactose oligosaccharides as well as mimetics from N&#8208;acyl mannosamines and lactose in metabolically engineered bacterial cells grown at high cell density. We designed new E. coli strains coexpressing sialic acid synthase and N&#8208;acylneuraminate cytidylyltransferase from Campylobacter jejuni together with the &#945;2,3&#8208;sialyltransferase from Neisseria meningitidis or the &#945;2,6sialyltransferase from Photobacterium sp. JT&#8208;ISH&#8208;224. Using their mannose transporter, these new strains actively internalized N&#8208;acetylmannosamine (ManNAc) and its N&#8208;propanoyl (N&#8208;Prop), N&#8208;butanoyl (N&#8208;But) and N&#8208;phenylacetyl (N&#8208;PhAc) analogs and converted them into the corresponding sialylated oligosaccharides, with overall yields between 10% and 39% (200&#8208;700 mg.L&#8208;1 of culture). The three &#945;2,6&#8208;sialyllactose analogs showed similar binding affinity for Sambucus nigra SNA&#8208;I lectin as for the natural oligosaccharide. They also proved to be stable competitive inhibitors of Vibrio cholerae neuraminidase. These N&#8208;acyl sialosides therefore hold promise for the development of anti&#8208;adhesion therapy against influenza viral infections.</dc:description>

         <title>Five Novel Silver&#8208;Based Coordination Polymers as Photoluminescent Sensing Platforms for the Detection of Nitrobenzene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nitrobenzene (NB) is a highly toxic chemical and a cause for concern to human health and the environment. Hence, it is worthwhile to design new efficient and robust sensing platform for NB. In this study, we present three newly synthesized luminescent silver cluster&#8208;based coordination polymers, {[Ag10(StBu)6(CF3COO)4(hpbt)] (DMAc)2(CH3CN)2}n (hpbt = N,N,N&#8217;,N&#8217;N&#8221;,N&#8221;&#8208;hexa(pyridine&#8208;4&#8208;yl)benzene&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triamine), [Ag12(StBu)6(CF3COO)6(bpva)3]n (bpva = 9,10&#8208;Bis(2&#8208;(pyridin&#8208;4&#8208;yl)vinyl)anthracene), and {[Ag12(StBu)6(CF3COO)6(bpb)(DMAc)2(H2O)2] (DMAc)2}n (bpb = 1,4&#8208;Bis(4&#8208;pyridyl)benzene) composed of Ag10, Ag12 and Ag12 cluster cores, respectively, connected by multidentate pyridine linkers. Besides, two new luminescent polymorphic silver(I)&#8208;based coordination polymers, [Ag(CF3COO)(dpa)]n (dpa = 9,10&#8208;di(4&#8208;pyridyl)anthracene) referred to as Agdpa (H) and Agdpa (R), where H and R denote the hexagon&#8208;like and rod&#8208;like crystal shapes, respectively, have been prepared. The coordination polymers exhibit highly sensitive luminescence quenching effect to NB, attributed to the &#960;&#8722;&#960; stacking interactions between the polymers and NB as well as the electron&#8208;withdrawing character of NB.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis, Crystal Structures, and Ion Pairing of &#954;6N Complexes with Rare Earth Elements in the Solid State and in Solution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The rare earth element complexes (Ln = Y, La, Sm, Lu, Ce) of several podant &#954;6N&#8208;coordinating ligands have been synthetized and thoroughly characterized. The structural properties of the complexes have been investigated by X&#8208;ray diffraction in the solid state and by advanced NMR methods in solution. To estimate the donor capabilities of the presented ligands, an experimental comparison study has been conducted by cyclic voltammetry as well as absorption experiments using the cerium complexes and by analyzing 89Y NMR chemical shifts of the different yttrium complexes. In order to obtain a complete and detailed picture, all experiments were corroborated by state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art quantum chemical calculations. Finally, coordination competition studies have been carried out by means of 1H and 31P NMR spectroscopy to investigate the correlation with donor properties and selectivity.</dc:description>

IC9O&#8208;COOMe that is reactive in SPAAC and gives fluorescent triazoles regardless of an azide nature was developed. The study of the S1 state deactivation mechanism of the non&#8208;fluorescent isocumarin&#8208;fused cycloalkyne IC9O using multi&#8208;configurational ab initio and DFT methodologies showed that deactivation proceeds through the electrocyclic ring opening of &#945;&#8208;pyrone and is accompanied by a redistribution of electron density in the fused benzene ring. We proposed that the S1 excited state deactivation barrier can be increased by introducing an acceptor group into a position with a decreasing electron density. As a proof of concept, we designed and synthesized isocumarin&#8208;fused cycloalkyne IC9O&#8208;COOMe bearing electron withdrawing group (COOMe) at the C6 position, which actually turned out to be fluorescent and underwent SPAAC to form fluorescent triazole derivatives.</dc:description>

         <title>Iron&#8208;Catalyzed Alkoxylation, Dehydrogenative&#8208;Polymerization and Tandem Hydrosilylative&#8208;Alkoxylation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Alkoxylation, hydrosilylative&#8208;alkoxylation, and dehydrogenative&#8208;polymerization are some of the most widely used transformations in synthetic chemistry. However, these transformations are traditionally catalyzed by precious, and rare late&#8208;transition metals. Presented here is a molecularly defined iron complex that catalyzes alkoxylation, tandem hydrosilylative&#8208;alkoxylation, and dehydrogenative polymerization of silanes under mild conditions. The iron complex [Fe(CO)4(H)(SiPh3)] 1 catalyzes a direct Si&#8208;O coupling reaction between an array of silanes and alcohols to produce desired alkoxysilanes in excellent yield, with H2 as the only byproduct. The iron catalyst tolerates various functional groups and provides access to 20 alkoxysilanes, including essential molecules such as &#946;&#8208;citronellol and cholesterol. Further, complex 1 catalyzes the polymerization of renewable diol and silane monomer to produce a renewable and degradable poly(isosorbide&#8208;silyl ether). Remarkably, complex 1 catalyzes a tandem hydrosilylative&#8208;alkoxylation of alkynes under mild conditions to yield unsaturated silyl ethers. The synthetic utility has been demonstrated by gram&#8208;scale alkoxylation and hydrosilylative&#8208;alkoxylation reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Acidic CO2 electrolysis addressing the "alkalinity issue" and achieving high CO2 utilization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) provides a promising approach for sustainable chemical fuel production of carbon neutrality. Neutral and alkaline electrolytes are predominantly employed in the current electrolysis system, but with striking drawbacks of (bi)carbonate (CO32&#8722;/HCO3&#8722;) formation and crossover due to the rapid and thermodynamically favorable reaction between hydroxide (OH&#8722;) with CO2, resulting in low carbon utilization efficiency and short&#8208;lived catalysis. Very recently, CO2RR in acidic media can effectively address the (bi)carbonate issue; however, the competing hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is more kinetically favorable in acidic electrolytes, which dramatically reduces CO2 conversion efficiency. Thus, it is a big challenge to effectively suppress HER and accelerate acidic CO2RR. In this review, we begin by summarizing the recent progress of acidic CO2 electrolysis, discussing the key factors limiting the application of acidic electrolytes. We then systematically discuss addressing strategies for acidic CO2 electrolysis, including electrolyte microenvironment modulation, alkali cations adjusting, surface/interface functionalization, nanoconfinement structural design, and novel electrolyzer exploitation. Finally, the new challenges and perspectives of acidic CO2 electrolysis are suggested. We believe this timely review can arouse researchers' attention to CO2 crossover, inspire new insights to solve the "alkalinity problem" and enable CO2RR as a more sustainable technology.</dc:description>

         <title>A Pyramidal Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks&#8208;Derived FeP@CoP Aluminium&#8208;Ion Battery Cathode Displaying Low&#8208;Temperature Tolerance and Fast Electron Transfer Kinetics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
FeP@CoP nanorods derived from pyramidal metal organic frameworks were developed as aluminum&#8208;ion battery cathode, which displays excellent electrochemical performance and fast electron transfer kinetics.







Abstract
Anhui Provincial Engineering Laboratory for Engineering appropriate cathode materials is significant for the development of high&#8208;performance aluminum&#8208;ion (Al&#8208;ion) batteries. Here, a pyramidal metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs)&#8208;derived FeP@CoP composite was developed as cathode, which exhibits good stability and high capacity. FeP@CoP cathode maintains a high capacity of 168&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 200 cycles, and displays a stable rate&#8208;performance at both room and low temperatures of &#8722;10&#8201;&#176;C. After three rounds of rate&#8208;performance cycling, the FeP@CoP composite recovers 178.2&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.3&#8197;A g&#8722;1. Moreover, density functional theory (DFT) calculations verify improved electron&#8208;transfer kinetics with narrowed band gap and enhanced density of states. These findings inspire a broad set of studies on MOFs&#8208;derived composites for high&#8208;performance secondary batteries.

         <title>High&#8208;Pressure and High&#8208;Temperature Dion&#8211;Jacobson Layered Perovskite Polymorphs of KWO3F</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The structural relationship between the known normal&#8208;pressure modification of KWO3F and its two new siblings synthesized under high pressure and at high temperature is explored. The three polymorphs exhibit varying degrees of symmetry, but all of them belong to an overarching Dion&#8211;Jacobson layered perovskite structure type. In addition to a thorough examination of the phase transitions of KWO3F specifically, this work provides a closer look at the role of anion site occupation in phase transitions of mixed&#8208;anion compounds.







Abstract
Two new Dion&#8211;Jacobson layered perovskite polymorphs of the known oxyfluoride compound KWO3F are reported. A high&#8208;pressure modification was synthesized using a multianvil setup and subsequently transformed into a high&#8208;temperature phase at &#8764;311&#8201;&#176;C. The crystal structures of both polymorphs were determined by use of single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and are described in detail herein. Differential thermal analyses and thermogravimetric analyses were carried out to further investigate the phase transition characteristics. Bond valence (BV) and charge distribution (CHARDI) calculations confirm the occupancy of mixed O|F anion positions, and Rietveld refinements as well as MAPLE calculations support the structure models.

         <title>A Feasible Strategy for a Highly Efficient Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Emitter Over 900&#8201;nm Based on Phenalenone Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two novel NIR TADF organic emitters, namely OPDC&#8208;DTPA and OPDC&#8208;DBBPA, were first designed and compared in parallel. Neat films of OPDC&#8208;DTPA and OPDC&#8208;DBBPA present real NIR emission with peaks at 962 and 1003&#8197;nm, respectively. Encouragingly, the solution processable doped NIR OLEDs based on OPDC&#8208;DBBPA exhibits a maximum of 0.103&#8201;% with an emission at a peak wavelength of 906&#8197;nm.







Abstract
Near&#8208;infrared (NIR) organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) suffer from the low external electroluminescence (EL) quantum efficiency (EQE), which is a critical obstacle for potential applications. Herein, 1&#8208;oxo&#8208;1&#8208;phenalene&#8208;2,3&#8208;dicarbonitrile (OPDC) is employed as an electron&#8208;withdrawing aromatic ring, and by incorporating with triphenylamine (TPA) and biphenylphenylamine (BBPA) donors, two novel NIR emitters with thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) characteristics, namely OPDC&#8208;DTPA and OPDC&#8208;DBBPA, are first developed and compared in parallel. Intense NIR emission peaks at 962 and 1003&#8197;nm are observed in their pure films, respectively. Contributed by the local excited (LE) characteristics in the triplet (T1) state in synergy with the charge transfer (CT) characteristics for the singlet (S1) state to activate TADF emission, the solution processable doped NIR OLEDs based on OPDC&#8208;DTPA and OPDC&#8208;DBBPA yield EL peaks at 834 and 906&#8197;nm, accompanied with maximum EQEs of 0.457 and 0.103&#8201;%, respectively, representing the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art EL performances in the TADF emitter&#8208;based NIR&#8208;OLEDs in the similar EL emission regions so far. This work manifests a simple and effective strategy for the development of NIR TADF emitters with long wavelength and efficiency synchronously.

Herein, 1-oxo-1-phenalene-2,3-dicarbonitrile (OPDC) is employed as an electron-withdrawing aromatic ring, and by incorporating with triphenylamine (TPA) and biphenylphenylamine (BBPA) donors, two novel NIR emitters with thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) characteristics, namely OPDC-DTPA and OPDC-DBBPA, are first developed and compared in parallel. Intense NIR emission peaks at 962 and 1003&#8197;nm are observed in their pure films, respectively. Contributed by the local excited (LE) characteristics in the triplet (T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) state in synergy with the charge transfer (CT) characteristics for the singlet (S&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) state to activate TADF emission, the solution processable doped NIR OLEDs based on OPDC-DTPA and OPDC-DBBPA yield EL peaks at 834 and 906&#8197;nm, accompanied with maximum EQEs of 0.457 and 0.103&#8201;%, respectively, representing the state-of-the-art EL performances in the TADF emitter-based NIR-OLEDs in the similar EL emission regions so far. This work manifests a simple and effective strategy for the development of NIR TADF emitters with long wavelength and efficiency synchronously.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Nms&#8208;Amides: An Amine Protecting Group with Unique Stability and Selectivity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
p&#8208;Toluenesulfonyl (Tosyl) and nitrobenzenesulfonyl (Nosyl) are two of the most common sulfonyl protecting groups for amines in contemporary organic synthesis. While p&#8208;toluenesulfonamides are known for their high stability and robustness, their use in multistep synthesis is plagued by difficult removal. Nitrobenzenesulfonamides, on the other hand, are easily cleaved but display limited stability to various reaction conditions. In an effort to resolve this conundrum, we herein present Nms&#8208;amides, initially developed through in silico studies, which overcome these previous limitations and leave no room for compromise, enabling a range of transformations that are not possible with traditional sulfonamide protecting groups.

         <title>Isoform&#8208;Selective Fluorescent Labeling of 14&#8208;3&#8208;3&#963; by Acrylamide&#8208;Containing Fusicoccins</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>

14&#8208;3&#8208;3 isoforms and the elucidation of their biological roles: In vitro isoform&#8208;selective fluorescent labeling of 14&#8208;3&#8208;3&#963; was achieved by a fusicoccin derivative containing a fluorophore and a Cys&#8208;directed acrylamide group. The reaction proceeds upon ternary complex formation with mode&#8208;3 phosphopeptide, which possesses i+1 aliphatic residues.







Abstract
The 14&#8208;3&#8208;3 family of proteins is central to the regulation of signaling pathways driven by serine/threonine kinases. In humans, 14&#8208;3&#8208;3 consists of seven highly conserved isoforms, yet the function of each isoform remains to be fully elucidated. Synthetic agents capable of isoform&#8208;specific fluorescent labeling of 14&#8208;3&#8208;3 would provide a useful tool for studying in depth the biological roles of isoforms. In this study, the 14&#8208;3&#8208;3&#963; isoform was evaluated, which possesses a unique Cys38, and a natural product&#8208;based fluorescent labeling agent was designed by introducing an acrylamide group and a fluorescent dye to fusicoccin (FC). In vitro evaluation demonstrated that 12&#8208;hydroxy 1 and 2 exhibit 14&#8208;3&#8208;3&#963; selective labeling activity over 14&#8208;3&#8208;3&#950; in the presence of a mode&#8208;3 phospholigand. Furthermore, 2 was shown to label 14&#8208;3&#8208;3&#963; in cell lysate in the presence of a C&#8208;terminal mode&#8208;3 phosphopeptide derived from ER&#945;, with no apparent nonspecific labeling. These results indicate that 2 is capable of selective fluorescent detection of 14&#8208;3&#8208;3&#963; upon binding to mode&#8208;3 phospholigand under biologically relevant conditions.

         <title>Direct C(3)5&#8722;H Polyfluoroarylation of 2&#8208;Amino/alkoxy Pyridines Enabled by a Transient and Electron&#8208;deficient Palladium Intermediate</title>

         <dc:description>
A transiently formed electrophilic polyfluoroaryl&#8208;Pd species overrides the unproductive N&#8208;coordination enabling a remote selective polyfluoroarylation of 2&#8208;amino/alkoxy&#8208;pyridines. The strategy allowed rapid construction of polyfluorinated heterobiaryls containing bioactive molecules and drug derivatives in good yields.







Abstract
Herein, we present an unprecedented azine&#8208;limited C5&#8722;H polyfluoroarylation of 2&#8208;aminopyridines enabled by a transient and electron&#8208;deficient perfluoroaryl&#8208;Pd species via C&#8722;H/C&#8722;H coupling. The protocol further allows C3(5)&#8722;H polyfluoroarylation of 2&#8208;alkoxypyridines guided by sterics and electronics for the first time. The late&#8208;stage C&#8722;H functionalization of drugs, drug derivatives, and natural product derivatives and synthesis of C5&#8208;aryl drug derivatives further demonstrated the method's utility. The preliminary mechanistic studies reveal that the synergistic combination of the bulky yet electrophilic perfluoroaryl&#8208;Pd species and the partial nucleophilicity of the C5&#8208;position of 2&#8208;amino/alkoxy&#8208;pyridines is the origin of reactivity and selectivity. Importantly, the first experimental evidence for the role of diisopropyl sulfide is provided.

         <title>Low&#8208;Pressure Sensitive Piezochromic Fluorescence Switching of Tetraphenylethylene&#8208;Anthraquinone</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>

Highly sensitive piezochromic fluorescent switching under low&#8208;pressure regimes (&#8764;60&#8197;kPa) of tetraphenylethylene&#8208;anthraquinone (TPE&#8208;AQ) is based on the controlled molecular design and polymorphic crystal strategy. The underlying mechanism of the low&#8208;pressure sensitive piezochromic fluorescence switching is demonstrated to be closely related to the loosely packed molecular orientation.







Abstract
Sensing of low&#8208;pressure signals is of great importance for cutting&#8208;edge technologies. Organic piezochromic molecules offer a promising library of pressure sensitive materials which can be tailor&#8208;designed toward specific requirements. However, very few examples of low&#8208;pressure sensitive piezochromic fluorescent molecules have been obtained till date, and the underlying mechanisms are still in its infancy. Herein, we report highly sensitive piezochromic fluorescent switching under low&#8208;pressure regimes (&#8764;60&#8197;kPa) of tetraphenylethylene&#8208;anthraquinone (TPE&#8208;AQ) based on the controlled molecular design and polymorphic phase strategy. The influence of both intramolecular conformation effect and variations of intermolecular stacking modes on the piezochromic property of TPE&#8208;AQ is investigated. The underlying mechanism of the low&#8208;pressure sensitive piezochromic fluorescence switching is demonstrated to be closely related to the loosely packed molecular orientation, as confirmed by X&#8208;ray diffraction measurements combined with simulations. This work provides a way to design highly efficient pressure sensors based on organic molecular systems.

         <title>Enantio&#8208; and Diastereomerically Pure Titanocenes by Dynamic Conformational Locking</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Abstract: The synthesis of enantiomerically pure titanocenes is limited to cases with enantiomerically pure substituents at the cyclopentadienyl ligands and to ansa&#8208;titanocenes. For the latter complexes, the use of achiral ligands requires a resolution of enantiomers and frequently also a separation of the diastereoisomers obtained after metalation. Here, we introduce a new synthetic method that relies on the use of enantiomerically pure camphorsulfonate (CSA) ligands as control elements for the absolute and relative configuration of titanocene complexes. Starting from the conformationally flexible (RC5H4)2TiCl2, the desired conformationally locked and hence enantio&#8208; and diastereomerically pure complexes (RC5H4)2Ti(CSA)2 are obtained in just two steps. According to X&#8208;ray crystallography the (RC5H4)2Ti fragment is essentially C2&#8208;symmetric and nuclear magnetic resonance displays overall C2&#8208;symmetry. We applied density functional theory methods to unravel the dynamics of the complexes and the mechanisms and selectivities of their formation.</dc:description>

         <title>One&#8208;pot Synthesis of Helical Azaheptalene and Chiroptical Switching of an Isolable Radical Cation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A nitrogen&#8208;centered heptalene, azaheptalene, was designed as a representative of a new class of redox&#8208;responsive molecules with a large steric strain that originates from the adjacent seven&#8208;membered rings. The pentabenzo derivative of azaheptalene was efficiently synthesized by a palladium&#8208;catalyzed one&#8208;pot reaction of commercially available reagents. Bromination led to mono&#8208; and dibrominated derivatives, the latter of which is interconvertible with isolable radical cation species exhibiting near&#8208;infrared absorption. Since the azaheptalene skeleton shows configurationally stable helicity with a large torsion angle, enantiomers could be successfully separated. Thus, optically pure azaheptalenes with P&#8208; or M&#8208;helicity showed strong chiroptical properties (|gabs| &#8805; 0.01), which could be changed by an electric potential.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Chemodivergent tandem radical cyclization offers exciting possibilities for the synthesis of structurally diverse cyclic compounds. Herein, we revealed a chemodivergent tandem cyclization of alkene substituted quinazolinones under metal&#8208; and base&#8208;free system, this transformation is initiated by alkyl radicals produced from oxidant&#8208;induced &#945;&#8208;C(sp3)&#8722;H functionalization of alkyl nitriles or esters. The reaction resulted in the selective synthesis of a series of mono&#8208; and di&#8208;alkylated ring&#8208;fused quinazolinones by modulating the loading of oxidant, reaction temperature, and reaction time. Mechanistic investigations show that the mono&#8208;alkylated ring&#8208;fused quinazolinones is constructed by the key process of 1,2&#8208;hydrogen shift, while the di&#8208;alkylated ring&#8208;fused quinazolinones is mainly achieved through crucial steps of spin delocalization and proton transfer.

         <title>Enantioenriched Boron C,N&#8208;Chelates via Chirality Transfer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A chirality transfer strategy was established to access enantioenriched boron C,N&#8208;chelates stereogenic only at the B&#8208;atom. First, a library of chiral boron O,N&#8208;complexes was synthesized in diastereoselective fashion. The generated stereoinformation at boron was then transferred via the ate&#8208;complex into the boron C,N&#8208;chelates.Twitter affiliations: @LaschatGroup, @YStoeckl







Abstract
Molecules stereogenic only at tetrahedral boron atoms show great promise for applications, for example as chiroptical materials, but are scarcely investigated due to their synthetic challenge. Hence, this study reports a two&#8208;step synthesis of enantioenriched boron C,N&#8208;chelates. First, the diastereoselective complexation of alkyl/aryl borinates with chiral aminoalcohols furnished boron stereogenic heterocycles in up to 86&#8201;% yield and d.r. &gt;98&#8201;:&#8201;2. Treatment of these O,N&#8208;complexes with chelate nucleophiles was surmised to transfer the stereoinformation via the ate&#8208;complex into the C,N&#8208;products. This chirality transfer succeeded by substitution of the O,N&#8208;chelates with lithiated phenyl pyridine to give boron stereogenic C,N&#8208;chelates in up to 84&#8201;% yield and e.r. up to 97&#8201;:&#8201;3. The chiral aminoalcohol ligands could be recovered after isolation of the C,N&#8208;chelates. The chirality transfer tolerated alkyl, alkynyl and (hetero&#8208;)aryl moieties at boron and could be further extended by post&#8208;modification: transformations such as catalytic hydrogenations or sequential deprotonation/electrophilic trapping were feasible while maintaining the stereochemical integrity of the C,N&#8208;chelates. Structural aspects of the boron chelates were studied by variable temperature NMR and X&#8208;ray diffraction.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A chirality transfer strategy&lt;/b&gt; was established to access enantioenriched boron &lt;i&gt;C,N&lt;/i&gt;-chelates stereogenic only at the &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;-atom. First, a library of chiral boron &lt;i&gt;O,N&lt;/i&gt;-complexes was synthesized in diastereoselective fashion. The generated stereoinformation at boron was then transferred via the ate-complex into the boron &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-chelates.Twitter affiliations: @LaschatGroup, @YStoeckl

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Molecules stereogenic only at tetrahedral boron atoms show great promise for applications, for example as chiroptical materials, but are scarcely investigated due to their synthetic challenge. Hence, this study reports a two-step synthesis of enantioenriched boron &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-chelates. First, the diastereoselective complexation of alkyl/aryl borinates with chiral aminoalcohols furnished boron stereogenic heterocycles in up to 86&#8201;% yield and d.r. &amp;gt;98&#8201;:&#8201;2. Treatment of these &lt;i&gt;O,N&lt;/i&gt;-complexes with chelate nucleophiles was surmised to transfer the stereoinformation via the ate-complex into the &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-products. This chirality transfer succeeded by substitution of the &lt;i&gt;O,N&lt;/i&gt;-chelates with lithiated phenyl pyridine to give boron stereogenic &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-chelates in up to 84&#8201;% yield and e.r. up to 97&#8201;:&#8201;3. The chiral aminoalcohol ligands could be recovered after isolation of the &lt;i&gt;C,N&lt;/i&gt;-chelates. The chirality transfer tolerated alkyl, alkynyl and (hetero-)aryl moieties at boron and could be further extended by post-modification: transformations such as catalytic hydrogenations or sequential deprotonation/electrophilic trapping were feasible while maintaining the stereochemical integrity of the &lt;i&gt;C,N&lt;/i&gt;-chelates. Structural aspects of the boron chelates were studied by variable temperature NMR and X-ray diffraction.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ionic Liquids and Electrolytes with Flexible Aromatic Anions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Structural analogous ionic liquids (ILs) and electrolytes comprising oligoether&#8208;based flexible aromatic anions offer different physicochemical properties. The designed ILs and the electrolytes are fluorine&#8208;free and have better physicochemical properties than conventional electrolytes and have a great potential to be used as electrolytes in next generation batteries, in particular those operating at elevated temperatures and with limited electrochemical stability window.







Abstract
Five new n&#8208;tetrabutylphosphonium (P4444)+ cation&#8208;based ionic liquids (ILs) with oligoether substituted aromatic carboxylate anions have been synthesized. The nature and position of the oligoether chain affect thermal stability (up to 330&#8201;&#176;C), phase behaviour (Tg&lt;&#8722;55&#8201;&#176;C) and ion transport. Furthermore, with the aim of application in lithium batteries, electrolytes were created for two of the ILs by 10&#8197;mol% doping using the corresponding Li&#8208;salts. This affects the ion diffusion negatively, from being higher and equal for cations and anions to lower for all ions and unequal. This is due to the stronger ionic interactions and formation of aggregates, primarily between the Li+ ions and the carboxylate group of the anions. Electrochemically, the electrolytes have electrochemical stability windows up to 3.5&#8197;V, giving some promise for battery application.

         <title>Extended Light Absorption and Improved Charge Separation by Protonation of the Organic Ligand in a Bismuth&#8208;Based Metal&#8208;Organic Framework</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Protonation of the nitrogen in the thiazole ring, which acts as the organic ligand of Bi&#8208;based MOF (Bi&#8208;MMTAA), results in a pronounced redshift in light absorption. This protonation also accelerates charge separation and transfer and ultimately improves photocatalytic performance.







Abstract
In this work, a new method to extend the light absorption and improve the photocatalytic activity of metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) with nitrogen&#8208;containing ligand is reported, namely, the protonation of nitrogen. Specifically, a protonated Bi&#8208;based MOF synthesized by a hydrothermal method (Bi&#8208;MMTAA&#8208;H, MMTAA=2&#8208;mercapto&#8208;4&#8208;methyl&#8208;5&#8208;thiazoleacetic acid) displays a wider visible light absorption than Bi&#8208;MMTAA&#8208;R with the same single&#8208;crystal structure, but synthesized by a reflux method. The redshifted light absorption was confirmed to be caused by the protonation of nitrogen in the thiazolyl ring in MMTAA. Moreover, this protonation also facilitates the charge separation and transfer and improves the photocatalytic activity of selective oxidation of &#945;&#8208;terpinene to p&#8208;cymene. Our results provide a new idea for nitrogen&#8208;containing Bi&#8208;based MOFs to extend the light absorption and improve the photocatalytic performance.

         <title>Tf2O&#8208;Catalyzed Tandem Cyclization/Trifluoromethylselenolation of Alkynes for Synthesis of CF3Se&#8208;Containing Heterocycles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mild and practical Tf2O&#8208;catalyzed tandem cyclization/trifluoromethylselenolation of alkynes with EtOH as the green solvent was developed. Various CF3Se&#8208;containing heterocyclic compounds, including indoles, benzofurans, benzothiophenes, isoquinolines and chromenes have been synthesized with trifluoromethyl selenoxides as CF3Se source.







Abstract
Herein, the tandem synthesis of various CF3Se&#8208;containing heterocyclic compounds has been developed, using Tf2O as the catalyst and trifluoromethyl selenoxides as the electrophilic trifluoromethylselenolation reagents. This process is characterized by its mild conditions, ease of operation, and good functional group compatibility. A variety of alkynes could be transferred into CF3Se&#8208;containing indoles, benzofurans, benzothiophenes, isoquinolines and chromenes in good yields. A key step involving the formation of the electrophilic CF3Se species was proposed.

Foldamer hairpin&#8208;like motifs have been prepared by connecting oligourea helices with various alkyl and aralkyl linkers, and their structures were determined by X&#8208;ray diffraction. Some specific geometrical parameters like interhelical dihedral angles and helical twists were measured, thus allowing precise comparison between the different supersecondary structures.

         <title>Facile Synthesis of Enantiomerically Pure P&#8208;Chiral 1&#8208;Alkoxy&#8208;2,3&#8208;dihydrophospholes via Nucleophilic P&#8208;N Bond Cleavage of a 1&#8208;Phospha&#8208;2&#8208;azanorbornene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
One cleavage &#8208; many possibilities: A straightforward one&#8208;pot synthesis of enantiopure P&#8208;chiral 1&#8208;alkoxy&#8208;2,3&#8208;dihydrophospholes has been established via a nucleophilic P&#8722;N bond cleavage of 1&#8208;phospha&#8208;2&#8208;azanorbornene (PAN). The procedure can be modified to give &#8220;custom&#8208;made&#8221; ligands by selecting various nucleophiles and PAN derivatives to control the steric and electronic properties. Phosphorus(III) compounds derived from this procedure are expected to be effective ligands in asymmetric homogeneous catalysis.







Abstract
The reactive P&#8722;N bond in a racemic mixture of endo&#8208;1&#8208;phospha&#8208;2&#8208;azanorbornene (PAN) (RP/SP)&#8208;endo&#8208;1 is readily cleaved with enantiomerically pure lithium alkoxides followed by protonation to afford diastereomeric mixtures of P&#8208;chiral 1&#8208;alkoxy&#8208;2,3&#8208;dihydrophosphole derivatives. The isolation of these compounds is rather challenging due to the reversibility of the reaction (elimination of alcohols). However, methylation of the sulfonamide moiety of the intermediate lithium salts and sulfur protection of the phosphorus atom prevent the elimination reaction. The resulting air&#8208;stable P&#8208;chiral diastereomeric 1&#8208;alkoxy&#8208;2,3&#8208;dihydrophosphole sulfide mixtures can be readily isolated and fully characterized. The diastereomers can be separated by crystallization. The 1&#8208;alkoxy&#8208;2,3&#8208;dihydrophosphole sulfides are readily reduced with Raney nickel to afford phosphorus(III) P&#8208;stereogenic 1&#8208;alkoxy&#8208;2,3&#8208;dihydrophospholes with potential use in asymmetric homogeneous transition metal catalysis.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;One cleavage - many possibilities&lt;/b&gt;: A straightforward one-pot synthesis of enantiopure &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;-chiral 1-alkoxy-2,3-dihydrophospholes has been established via a nucleophilic P&#8722;N bond cleavage of 1-phospha-2-azanorbornene (PAN). The procedure can be modified to give &#8220;custom-made&#8221; ligands by selecting various nucleophiles and PAN derivatives to control the steric and electronic properties. Phosphorus(III) compounds derived from this procedure are expected to be effective ligands in asymmetric homogeneous catalysis.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reactive P&#8722;N bond in a racemic mixture of &lt;i&gt;endo&lt;/i&gt;-1-phospha-2-azanorbornene (PAN) (&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;P&lt;/sub&gt;/&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;P&lt;/sub&gt;)-&lt;i&gt;endo&lt;/i&gt;-&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; is readily cleaved with enantiomerically pure lithium alkoxides followed by protonation to afford diastereomeric mixtures of &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;-chiral 1-alkoxy-2,3-dihydrophosphole derivatives. The isolation of these compounds is rather challenging due to the reversibility of the reaction (elimination of alcohols). However, methylation of the sulfonamide moiety of the intermediate lithium salts and sulfur protection of the phosphorus atom prevent the elimination reaction. The resulting air-stable &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;-chiral diastereomeric 1-alkoxy-2,3-dihydrophosphole sulfide mixtures can be readily isolated and fully characterized. The diastereomers can be separated by crystallization. The 1-alkoxy-2,3-dihydrophosphole sulfides are readily reduced with Raney nickel to afford phosphorus(III) &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;-stereogenic 1-alkoxy-2,3-dihydrophospholes with potential use in asymmetric homogeneous transition metal catalysis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Unimolecular Reactivity of [Cu(R)(CF3)3]&#8722; Complexes (R=Organyl): Stepwise versus Concerted Mechanism in Copper&#8208;Mediated Trifluoromethylation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A combination of gas&#8208;phase fragmentation experiments and quantum chemical calculations affords detailed insight into the reactivity of high&#8208;valent trifluoromethylated cuprate complexes. Depending on the nature of the organyl group R, these key intermediates of synthetically valuable trifluoromethylation reactions lose two radicals or undergo concerted reductive eliminations.







Abstract
The cuprate complexes [Cu(R)(CF3)3]&#8722; (R=organyl) offer an efficient synthetic access to valuable trifluoromethylation products RCF3. Here, electrospray&#8208;ionization mass spectrometry is used to analyze the formation of these intermediates in solution and probe their fragmentation pathways in the gas phase. Furthermore, the potential energy surfaces of these systems are explored by quantum chemical calculations. Upon collisional activation, the [Cu(R)(CF3)3]&#8722; complexes (R=Me, Et, Bu, sBu, allyl) afford the product ions [Cu(CF3)3]&#8901;&#8722; and [Cu(CF3)2]&#8722;. The former obviously results from an R&#8901; loss, whereas the latter originates either from the stepwise release of R&#8901; and CF3&#8901; radicals or a concerted reductive elimination of RCF3. The gas&#8208;phase fragmentation experiments as well as the quantum chemical calculations indicate that the preference for the stepwise reaction toward [Cu(CF3)2]&#8722; increases with the stability of the formed organyl radical R&#8901;. This finding suggests that the recombination of R&#8901; and CF3&#8901; radicals may possibly contribute to the formation of RCF3 from [Cu(R)(CF3)3]&#8722; in synthetic applications. In contrast, the [Cu(R)(CF3)3]&#8722; complexes (R=aryl) only yield [Cu(CF3)2]&#8722; when subjected to collision&#8208;induced dissociation. These species exclusively undergo a concerted reductive elimination because the competing stepwise pathway is disfavored by the low stability of aryl radicals.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This concept article provides new opportuinies of employing metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) as solid platforms to activate small molecules like hydrogen due to intrinsic sites in MOFs that behave as frustrated Lewis acid&#8208;base pairs, thus featuring new avenues for heterogeneous catalysis using MOFs as solid catalysts.New Opportunities in Metal&#8211;organic Framework Catalysis: From Bifunctional to Frustrated Lewis Pairs Catalysis (Garcia, Dhakshinamoorthy, and Asiri)







Abstract
This article highlights novel prospects for metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) in heterogeneous catalysis as having frustrated Lewis acid&#8208;base pairs (FLPs) or as bifunctional acid&#8208;base solid catalysts able to activate molecular hydrogen. Starting from the extensive application MOFs as Lewis acid and Lewis base catalysts, this article uses catalytic hydrogenation to briefly summarize the efforts made to heterogenize boron and amine in MOFs to mimic molecular FLP systems. The core of this concept is based on recent findings which demonstrate the ability of two commonly used MOFs, namely UiO&#8208;66 and MIL&#8208;101, to catalyze the selective hydrogenation of polar double X=Y bonds at moderate H2 pressures below 10&#8197;bar. The influence of electron&#8208;donating, the withdrawal of substituents on the linker, and the aniline poisoning effect highlight the significance of Lewis acid sites, while density&#8208;functional theory calculations indicate the heterolytic H&#8722;H bond cleavage at the MOF metal oxo clusters. It is expected that this new perspective on MOFs as solid FLP systems will spur further research to explore and define the potential of dual sites in the catalytic activation of small molecules.

         <title>Stereochemically Active Tin(II)&#8208;Induced Enhancement of Birefringence in SnIISnIV(PO4)2 and SrSn(PO4)PO2(OH)2</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two new tin(II) phosphates SnIISnIV(PO4)2 and SrSn(PO4)PO2(OH)2 exhibit enhanced birefringence by introducing the tin(II) ions with stereochemically active lone pairs. And in particular for SrSn(PO4)PO2(OH)2, the hydrogen groups facilitate more aligned Sn2+&#8208;centered oxygen polyhedra. Moreover, the UV&#8208;Vis&#8208;NIR diffuse reflectance measurement further indicates that their cut off edges are 262 and 263&#8197;nm, which can be used as a new UV birefringent crystal.







Abstract
Two new tin(II) phosphates, SnIISnIV(PO4)2 and SrSn(PO4)PO2(OH)2, were synthesized by the high&#8208;temperature solution method and hydrothermal method, respectively. Theoretical study indicates that by introducing tin(II) with stereochemical activity lone pairs (SCALP) in metal phosphates, the birefringence was enhanced, 0.048@1064&#8197;nm for SnIISnIV(PO4)2 and 0.080@1064&#8197;nm for SrSn(PO4)PO2(OH)2.

         <title>[2+4] Cycloaddition Product of an Amidinate Substituted Dialumene with Toluene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A transient dialumene based on an amidinate scaffold was synthesized. The complex was isolated as a cycloaddition product with toluene. The mechanism of the reaction investigated using the DFT method indicates a free energy barrier of 0.9&#8197;kcal/mol with respect to the monomeric AlI intermediate.







Abstract
Reduction of LAlI2 (L=PhC(NiPr2C6H3)2) with two equivalents of KC8 in toluene affords the [2+4]cycloaddition product of a dialumene with toluene. The mechanism for the formation of product complex was investigated using density functional theory (DFT) methods.

         <title>Allosteric Tuning of Caspase&#8208;7: Establishing the Nexus of Structure and Catalytic Power</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mapping the constellation of structural and dynamic changes concurrent with allosteric inhibitor binding to caspase&#8208;7, also known as allosteric structure&#8211;activity relationships (ASARs), reveals the nexus between the active site and the remote allosteric pocket. These ASARs also elucidate the link between structure and catalytic power for caspase&#8208;7. Our insights from exploration of caspase&#8208;7 allostery offer a new path for navigating allosteric drug discovery. More information can be found in the Research Article by M.&#8197;A. Spies and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202300872).

         <dc:description>Until now, there has been very little experimental evidence for the existence of free arsinidenes and stibinidenes, apart from the hydrides, AsH and SbH. Here we report on photogeneration of triplet ethynylarsinidene, HCCAs, and triplet ethynylstibinidene, HCCSb, from ethynylarsine and ethynylstibine, respectively, in solid argon matrices. The products were identified using infrared spectroscopy and the associated UV absorption spectra are interpreted with the aid of theoretical predictions.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Among the general interest in fluorinated compounds, trifluoromethoxylated molecules play a specific role. However, despite this interest, the development of efficient reagents to perform trilfuoromethoxylation reactions remains a challenge. Here, 2,4dinitro&#8208;trifluoromethoxybenzene (DNTFB) is used as a trifluoromethoxylating reagent to perform nucleophilic substitution under mild metal&#8208;free conditions with different leaving groups, including direct dehydroxytrifluoromethoxylation. A mechanistic study rationalized the reaction and subsequently proposed only three reaction conditions, depending on the reactivity of the starting substrates.</dc:description>

         <title>On the Role of N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene Salts in Alkyl Radical Generation from Alkyl Alcohols: A Computational Study</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The mechanism of carbon centered radical generation from alkyl alcohols mediated by N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene salts has been explored computationally for 7 different NHCs. The influence of the electronic properties for each mechanistic step is rationalized and has been proven to be key for reactivity.







Abstract
Formation of carbon&#8208;carbon bonds through cross&#8208;coupling reactions using readily available substrates, like alcohols, is crucial for modern organic chemistry. Recently, direct alkyl alcohol functionalization has been achieved by the use of N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene (NHC) salts via in&#8197;situ formation of an alcohol&#8208;NHC adduct and its activation by a photoredox catalyst to generate carbon&#8208;centered alkyl radicals. Experimentally, only electron deficient NHC activators work but the reasons of this behavior remain underexplored. Herein, a DFT computational study of the mechanism of alcohol activation using up to seven NHC salts is performed to shed light into the influence of their electronic properties in the alkyl radical formation. This study demonstrates that four reaction steps are involved in the transformation and characterizes how the electronic properties of the NHC salt affect each step. A fine balance of the NHC electron&#8208;richness is proved to be determinant for this transformation.

         <title>Constructing pH&#8208;Responsive and Tunable Azo&#8208;Phenol&#8208;Based o&#8208;Nitrobenzyl Photocages</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
pH&#8208;sensitive phenolic groups can be attached to the o&#8208;nitrobenzyl (oNB) group to form azo&#8208;phenolic NPX photocages with tunable pKa. One of the photocages in this study, NPdiCl, is identified as a promising pH&#8208;responsive photocage for photoreleasing cargo inside acidic tumor cells.







Abstract
Multiple triggered&#8208;release strategies are widely utilized to control the release of caged target molecules. Among them, photocages with conditional triggers provide extra layers of control in photorelease. In this work, a series of pH&#8208;responsive photocages was designed that could be triggered under irradiation and specific intracellular pH values. pH&#8208;sensitive phenolic groups were conjugated with o&#8208;nitrobenzyl (oNB) to form azo&#8208;phenolic NPX photocages with tunable pKa. These azo&#8208;phenol&#8208;based oNB photocages showed differentiable photoreleasing profiles at pH&#8197;5.0, 7.2 and 9.0. By attaching fluorogenic cargos, it was shown that one of the photocages, NPdiCl, could be used to differentiate between acidic pH&#8197;5.0 and neutral pH&#8197;7.2 in cells under artificial pH conditions. Finally, NPdiCl was identified as a promising pH&#8208;responsive photocage for photoreleasing cargo inside acidic tumor cells.

         <title>Comparison of Antiaromatic Properties in a Series of Structurally Isomeric Naphthothiophene&#8208;Fused s&#8208;Indacenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work compares six antiaromatic naphthothiophene&#8208;fused s&#8208;indacene isomers through computational methods (NICS&#8208;XY scans) and experimental techniques (NMR, UV&#8208;vis, CV, and SC&#8208;XRD).







Abstract
Fusion of aromatic subunits to stabilize an antiaromatic core allows the isolation and study of otherwise unstable paratropic systems. A complete study of a series of six naphthothiophene&#8208;fused s&#8208;indacene isomers is herein described. Additionally, the structural modifications resulted in increased &#960;&#8211;&#960; overlap in the solid state, which was further explored through changing the sterically blocking mesityl group to (triisopropylsilyl)ethynyl in three derivatives. The computed antiaromaticity of the six isomers is compared to the observed physical properties, such as NMR chemical shift, UV&#8208;vis, and CV data. We find that the calculations predict the most antiaromatic isomer and give a general estimation of the relative degree of paratropicity for the remaining isomers, when compared to the experimental results.

         <title>Lead&#8208;Free Double Perovskite Semiconductor with Rigid Spacer&#8208;Induced High&#8208;Tc Dielectric Switch Features</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multifunctional material (benzylammonium)4AgBiBr8, which has a step&#8208;like dielectric phase transition at 383&#8197;K/387&#8197;K (cooling/heating) and excellent photoelectric properties, was obtained by using rigid benzylammonium cations as templates.







Abstract
Layered hybrid perovskites possess exceptional semiconductor features and structural versality, making them viable candidates for developing multifunctional dielectric phase&#8208;transition materials (PTMS). However, most PTMs based on layered hybrid perovskites still suffer from Pb toxicity and low operating temperature. The recently developed hybrid double perovskites provide a new routine to designed PTMs with desired working performance and environment&#8208;friendly chemical compositions. Herein, using rigid aromatic cations as templates, we have successfully synthesized a novel double perovskite (benzylammonium)4AgBiBr8 (1), which consists of corner&#8208;sharing AgBr6 and BiBr6 layers and benzylammonium cations. Notably, 1 exhibits a high&#8208;temperature first&#8208;order reversible solid&#8208;state phase transition at 383/387&#8197;K (cooling/heating) and switchable dielectric performance around the temperature. Compared with the soft organic chain version of the compound, the phase transition temperature of 1 shows a large enhancement of 99&#8197;K, validating the correctness of the designing strategy. In addition, 1 also exhibits semiconductor characteristics with a calculated bandgap of 2.34&#8197;eV and an optical bandgap of 2.29&#8197;eV. Remarkably, the single crystal photodetector of 1 shows a low dark current (2.12&#215;10&#8722;13&#8197;A), a high on/off ratio (1.77&#215;103), and a fast response (&#964;rise=125&#8197;&#956;s and &#964;decay=419&#8197;&#956;s). Such a lead&#8208;free phase transition material combined with semiconductor properties provides a new strategy to develop environmentally friendly multifunctional materials.

         <title>Structure&#8208;induced Intelligence of Liquid Crystal Elastomers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Liquid crystal elastomers (LCEs) are active soft matter&#8208;based materials with strong stimulus responsiveness and reversible, large&#8208;shape morphing capabilities. The actuation intelligence and advanced functionality of LCEs depend on the smartness and properties of structures. In this review, we discuss recent advances in structure&#8208;induced intelligence of LCEs, specifically the integration of structural properties with the alignment and processing of LCEs.







Abstract
Liquid crystal elastomers (LCEs) are active soft matter&#8208;based materials with strong stimulus responsiveness and reversible, large&#8208;shape morphing capabilities. LCEs have demonstrated broad and growing applications in soft robotics, wearable devices, artificial muscles, and optical machines. The actuation intelligence and advanced functionality of LCEs depend on the smartness and properties of structures. In this review, we discuss recent advances in structure&#8208;induced intelligence of LCEs, specifically the integration of structural properties with the alignment and processing of LCEs. The structural design principles for three categories consisting of common structures (film, fiber, and tubule), smart structures (origami, kirigami, mechanical metamaterial, topology, and topography), and complex structures (monolithic and integrated) are presented. Various alignment controls of LCEs, including mechanical, surface, field&#8208;assisted, and shear alignment, are capable of inducing structural properties. The coupling and collaboration mechanisms of the LCE structures and the generated functions are discussed. The review concludes with perspectives on current challenges and emerging opportunities.
