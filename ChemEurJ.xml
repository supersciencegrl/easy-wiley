         <dc:description>The newly discovered light&#8208;driven gem&#8208;hydrogenation of alkynes opens an unconventional yet efficient entry into five&#8208;coordinate Grubbs&#8208;type ruthenium carbene complexes with cis&#8208;disposed chloride ligands. Representatives of this class featuring a chelate substructure formed by an iodo&#8208;substituted benzylidene unit react with (substituted) 2&#8208;isopropoxystyrene to give prototypical &#8220;second generation&#8221; Grubbs&#8208;Hoveyda complexes for olefin metathesis. The new approach to this venerable catalyst family is safe and versatile for it uses a triple bond rather than phenyldiazomethane as the ultimate carbene source and does not require any sacrificial phosphines.</dc:description>

         <title>Unraveling the Guest&#8208;induced Switchability in the Metal&#8208;organic Framework DUT&#8208;13(Zn)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The switching mechanism of the flexible framework Zn  4  O(benztb)  1.5  (benztb &#8208; N,N,N&#8217;,N&#8217;&#8208;benzidine tetrabenzoate), also known as DUT&#8208;13, was studied by advanced powder X&#8208;ray diffraction (PXRD) and gas physisorption techniques. In situ synchrotron PXRD experiments upon physisorption of nitrogen (77 K) and n&#8208;butane (273 K) shed light on the hitherto unnoticed guest&#8208;induced breathing in the mesoporous MOF. The mechanism of contraction is based on the conformationally labile benztb ligand and accompanied by the reduction of specific pore volume from 2.03 cm  3  g  &#8208;1  in open pore phase to 0.91 cm  3  g  &#8208;1  in contracted pore phase. The high temperature limit for adsorption&#8208;induced contraction of 170K, determined by systematic temperature variation of methane adsorption isotherms indicate that DUT&#8208;13 framework is softer in comparison with other mesoporous MOFs like DUT&#8208;49 and does not support the formation of overloaded metastable states, required for negative gas adsorption transitions.</dc:description>

         <title>Forever Young: Structural Stability of Telomeric Guanine&#8208;Quadruplexes in Presence of Oxidative DNA Lesions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Human telomeric DNA,in G&#8208;quadruplex (G4) conformation, is characterized by a remarkable structural stability that confers it the capacity to resist to oxidative stress producing one or even clustered 8&#8208;oxoguanine (8oxoG) lesions. We present a combined experimental/computational investigation, by using circular dichroism in aqueous solutions, cellular immunofluorescence assays and molecular dynamics simulations, that identifies the crucial role of the stability of G4s to oxidative lesions, related also to their biological role as inhibitors of telomerase, an enzyme overexpressed in most cancers associated to oxidative stress</dc:description>

         <title>Rapidly Adaptive All&#8208;covalent Nanoparticle Surface Engineering</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Emerging nanotechnologies demand the manipulation of nanoscale components with the same predictability and programmability as is taken for granted in molecular synthetic methodologies. Yet installing appropriately reactive chemical functionality on nanomaterial surfaces has previously entailed compromises in terms of reactivity scope, functionalization density, or both. Here, we introduce an idealized dynamic covalent nanoparticle building block for divergent and adaptive post&#8208;synthesis modification of colloidal nanomaterials. Acetal&#8208;protected monolayer&#8208;stabilized gold nanoparticles are prepared via operationally simple protocols and are stable to long&#8208;term storage. Tuneable surface densities of reactive aldehyde functionalities are revealed on&#8208;demand, leading to a wide range of adaptive surface engineering options from one nanoscale synthon. Analytically tractable with molecular precision, interfacial reaction kinetics and dynamic surface constitutions can be probed in situ at the ensemble level. High functionalization densities combined with rapid equilibration kinetics enable environmentally adaptive surface constitutions and rapid nanoparticle property switching in response to simple chemical effectors.</dc:description>

         <title>Energetics of competing chiral supramolecular polymers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chirality can have unexpected consequences including on properties other than spectroscopic. We show herein that a racemic mixture of bis&#8208;urea&#160; stereoisomers&#160; forms thermodynamically stable supramolecular polymers that result in a more viscous solution than for the pure &#160;stereoisomer. &#160;The origin of this macroscopic property was probed by characterizing the structure and stability of the assemblies. Both &#160; racemic and non&#8208;racemic bis&#8208;urea stereoisomers &#160; form two competing helical supramolecular polymers in solution: a double and a single helical structure at low and high temperature, respectively. The transition temperature between these assemblies, as probed by spectroscopic and calorimetric analyses, is strongly influenced by the composition (by up to 70&#176;C). A simple model that accounts for the thermodynamics of this system, indicates that the stereochemical defects (chiral mismatches and helix reversals) affect much more the stability of single helices. Therefore, the heterochiral double helical structure predominates over the single helical structure (whilst the opposite holds for the homochiral structures), which explains the aforementioned higher viscosity of the racemic bis&#8208;urea solution. This rationale constitutes a new basis to tune the macroscopic properties of the increasing number of supramolecular polymers reported to exhibit competing chiral nanostructures.</dc:description>

         <title>Nematic Triphenyltriazine Triesters and the Induction of the Columnar Mesophase by Fluorine Substitution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Whereas their para homologs are not mesogenic, the disk&#8208;shaped triphenyltriazine meta&#8208;trialkylesters obtained via trimerization of 3&#8208;cyanobenzoic alkylester, which are configurationally more flexible, exhibit a monotropic nematic mesophase. Introduction of fluorine atoms into the alkyl chains or into the phenyl moieties leads to the appearance of an enantiotropic columnar mesophase. If fluorine is introduced both in the chains and in the phenyl moieties, only a monotropic mesophase remains. Fluorination of either the alkyl chains or the aromatic core, but not both, appears thus as a simple means of inducing or stabilizing columnar self&#8208;assembly in disk&#8208;shaped systems. As the homeotropically alignable columnar mesophase can thus be made to persist at room temperature, as energies higher than 3eV of the first excited triplet state are computed in agreement with the value reported for the parent arene, and as they are not fluorescent themselves, these compounds are of promise as aligning host matrices for blue&#8208;emitting TADF devices with improved light outcoupling. Dilution of a columnar with a nonmesogenic homolog induces the nematic state, indicating that the nanoscopic make&#8208;up of both mesophases is closely related.</dc:description>

         <title>Coordination Properties of Hydroxyisophthalic Acids: Topological Correlations, Synthesis, Structural Analysis, and Properties of New Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hydroxyisophthalic acids are valuable polytopic ligands for the design of functional materials based on coordination polymers due to the variety of charges and coordination modes they possess. Here we describe synthesis, thermal stability, non&#8208;linear optical and spectroscopic properties of five novel coordination compounds [K  2  L(H  2  O)  2  ], [MgL(H  2  O)  2  ]&#183;3H  2  O, [CaL(H  2  O)  3  ], [SrL(H  2  O)  3  ]&#183;H  2  O, [BaL(H  2  O)(H  2  O)  5  ] and one salt (NH  4  )  2  L&#183;2H  2  O with 4,5,6&#8208;trihydroxyisophthalic acid (  H  2  L  ), which has not been tested in the assembling crystalline coordination networks before.&#160; Peculiarities of the structural organization of the compounds were analyzed and compared with those for other hydroxyisophthalates. The coordination properties of hydroxyisophthalic acids were studied from the topological point of view. The comparative topological analysis of coordination and H&#8208;bonded networks was performed. Structural correlations revealed in this study can be useful for the design of hydroxyisophthalate&#8208;based coordination networks including porous metal&#8208;organic frameworks, proton conductors, and NLO materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Fischer Carbene Complexes: A Glance at Two Decades of Research on Higher&#8208;order Cycloaddition Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The structure of Fischer carbene complexes (FCCs) is electron deficient. If bearing an &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated system, it can generate a wide variety of compounds by undergoing many different transformations, including higher&#8208;order cycloadditions. The latter are described as pericyclic reactions in which more than six electrons participate. These reactions have been employed in various areas of organic synthesis, resulting in highly selective compounds with a broad range of scaffolds. The first studies on higher&#8208;order cycloadditions involving FCCs frequently yielded competing by&#8208;products. Many groups have attempted to increase selectivity by exploring distinct reaction conditions, reagents and co&#8208;catalysts (e.g., metal&#8208;mediated cycloadditions). The present review is the first to focus exclusively on using higher&#8208;order cycloadditions involving FCCs to synthesize carbocycles and heterocycles. Based on two decades of reports, an analysis is made of the main aspects of the mechanisms proposed for higher&#8208;order cycloadditions and the structural diversity obtained by the substituent effect.</dc:description>

         <title>Single Mn  Atom  Anchored on  Nitrogen&#8208;Doped  Graphene as  Highly  Efficient  Electrocatalyst for  Oxygen  ReductionR eaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Single Mn atom on nitrogen&#8208;doped graphene (MnN4&#8208;G) has exhibited good structural stability and high activity for adsorption and dissociation of O2&#160;molecule, herein becoming a promising SAC candidate for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). However, the catalytic activity of MnN4&#8208;G for the ORR and the optimal reaction pathway remain obscure. In this work, density&#8208;functional theory calculations were employed to comprehensively investigate all possible pathways and intermediate reactions of the ORR on MnN4&#8208;G. The feasible active sites and the most stable adsorption configurations of intermediates and transition states during the ORR were identified. Screened from all the possibilities, three optimal four&#8208;electron O2  &#160;hydrogenation pathways&#160;with the ultralow energy barrier of 0.13 eV&#160;were discovered, which are&#160;energetically more favorable&#160;than O2  &#160;direct dissociation pathways.&#160;The analysis of free energy diagram further verified the&#160;thermodynamical&#160;feasibility&#160;of the three pathways. Therefore, MnN4&#8208;G&#160;possesses&#160;superior ORR activity. This study provides a fundamental understanding about design of highly efficient SACs for the ORR.</dc:description>

         <title>Saccharified uranyl Ions: Self&#8208;assembly of UO22+ into trinuclear anionic complexes via the coordination of glucosamine&#8208;derived Schiff bases</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The reaction of UO 2 (OAc) 2 &#8226;2H 2 O with the biologically inspired ligand 2&#8208;salicylidene glucosamine (H 2 L 1 ) results in the formation of the anionic trinuclear uranyl complex [(UO 2 ) 3 (&#181; 3 &#8208;O)( L 1 ) 3 ] 2&#8210; ( 1 2&#8208; ), which was isolated in good yield as its Cs&#8208;salt, [Cs] 2 1 . Recrystallization of [Cs] 2 1 in the presence of 18&#8208;crown&#8208;6 led to formation of a neutral ion pair of type [M(18&#8208;crown&#8208;6)] 2 1 which was also obtained for the alkali metal ions Rb + and K + (M = Cs, Rb, K). The related ligand, 2&#8208;(2&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;1&#8208;naphthylidene) glucosamine (H 2 L 2 ) in a similar procedure with Cs + yielded the corresponding complex [Cs(18&#8208;crown&#8208;6)] 2 [(UO 2 ) 3 (&#181; 3 &#8208;O)( L 2 ) 3 ([Cs(18&#8208;crown&#8208;6)] 2 2 ). From X&#8208;ray investigations, the [(UO 2 ) 3 O( L n ) 3 ] 2&#8210; anion (n = 1, 2) in each complex is a discrete trinuclear uranyl species, that coordinates to the alkali metal ion via three uranyl oxygen atoms. The coordination behavior of H 2 L 1 and H 2 L 2 towards UO 2 2+ was investigated by NMR&#8208;, UV/Vis&#8208;spectroscopy and mass spectrometry, revealing the in situ formation of the 1 2&#8208; and 2 2&#8208; dianions in solution.</dc:description>

         <title>Solvent Induced Helix Folding of Defined Indolenine Squaraine Oligomers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A protecting group strategy was employed to synthesise a series of indolenine squaraine dye oligomers up to the nonamer. The longer oligomers show a distinct solvent dependence of the absorption spectra, that is, either a strong blue shift or a strong red shift of the lowest energy bands in the near infrared spectral region. This behaviour is explained by exciton coupling theory as being due to H&#8208; or J&#8208;type coupling of transition moments. The H&#8208;type coupling is a consequence of a helix folding in solvents with a small Hansen dispersity index. DOSY NMR, small angle neutron scattering (SANS), quantum chemical and force field calculations agree upon a helix structure with an unusually large pitch and open voids that are filled with solvent molecules, thereby forming a kind of clathrate. The thermodynamic parameters of the folding process were determined by temperature dependent optical absorption spectra.</dc:description>

The longer oligomers show a distinct solvent dependence of the absorption spectra, that is, either a strong blue shift or a strong red shift of the lowest energy bands in the near infrared spectral region. This behaviour is explained by exciton coupling theory as being due to H&#8208; or J&#8208;type coupling of transition moments. The H&#8208;type coupling is a consequence of a helix folding in solvents with a small Hansen dispersity index. DOSY NMR, small angle neutron scattering (SANS), quantum chemical and force field calculations agree upon a helix structure with an unusually large pitch and open voids that are filled with solvent molecules, thereby forming a kind of clathrate. The thermodynamic parameters of the folding process were determined by temperature dependent optical absorption spectra.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembled Multivalent Ag&#8208;SR Coordination Polymers with Phosphatase&#8208;Like Activity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We show herein the phosphatase&#8208;like catalytic activity of coordination polymers obtained after adding Ag + &#8208;ions to thiols bearing hydrophobic alkyl chains terminated with a 1,4,7&#8208;triazacyclononane (TACN) group. The subsequent addition of Zn 2+ &#8208;ions to the self&#8208;assembled polymers resulted in the formation of multivalent metal coordination polymers capable of catalysing the transphosphorylation of an RNA&#8208;model compound (2&#8208;hydroxypropyl&#8208;4&#8208;nitrophenyl phosphate, HPNPP) with high reactivity. Analysis of a series of metal ions showed that the highest catalytic activity was obtained when Ag + &#8208;ions were used as the first metal ions to construct the backbone of the coordination polymer through interaction with the &#8208;SH group followed by Zn 2+ &#8208;ions as the second metal ions complexed by the TACN&#8208;macrocycle. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that the catalytic activity could be modulated by changing the length of the hydrophobic alkyl chain.</dc:description>

         <title>Nucleophilic reactions of osmanaphthalynes with PMe3 and H2O</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Members of a new class of complexes,  2(CF  3  )  ,  2(H)  ,  2(Br)  ,  2(I)  , and  2(OCH  3  )  , have been synthesized by a one&#8208;pot method involving the treatment of osmanaphthalynes bearing corresponding substituents (  1(CF  3  )  ,  1(H)  ,  1(Br)  ,  1(I)  , and  1(OCH  3  )  with trimethylphosphine (PMe  3  ) and water (H  2  O). The main reaction process involves two steps, namely a ligand&#8208;exchange reaction with trimethylphosphine and nucleophilic addition of water to the Os&#8801;C bond of the osmanaphthalyne. The substituents have a significant influence on the rate of the reaction, as befits a nucleophilic addition. Fortunately, the key intermediate  [1(OCH  3  )]&#8242;  could be successfully captured, and the detailed reaction mechanism has been explored with the aid of density functional theory (DFT) calculations, in excellent agreement with the experimental findings. All of the target complexes have been fully characterized by  1  H,  31  P{  1  H}, and  13  C{  1  H} NMR spectroscopies, high&#8208;resolution mass spectrometry, and elemental analysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Sulfur Tetrahydride and Allied Superhydride Clusters: When&#8201;Resonance Takes Precedence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 22, Page 6748-6759, April 16, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
H2S + H2 reactants are (computationally) found to form metastable &#8220;superhydride&#8221; SH4 that in turn forms (SH4&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H2S)n = &#8220;(SH3)2n&#8221; clusters with well&#8208;adapted (x,y,z) geometry for crystallization. Natural resonance theory (NRT) clarifies the uniqueness of the hypervalent bonding in this species.







Abstract
Sulfur offers a variety of bonding surprises compared to the parent oxygen atom of the chalcogen family. In the present work, we employ standard quantum chemistry methods to characterize formation of previously unrecognized sulfur tetrahydride (C4v&#8208;symmetric SH4) from hydrogen sulfide (H2S) and molecular hydrogen (H2) on the ground state potential energy surface. The unusual intramolecular interactions of SH4 defy Lewis&#8208;like bonding conceptions, exhibiting the dominance of resonance&#8208;type donor&#8208;acceptor delocalizations well beyond those of SF4 (C2v sawhorse geometry) and other known tetrahalides. The distressed character of SH4 bonding also leads to exotic intermolecular structural motifs in clusters of pure (SH4)n and mixed (SH4&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H2S)n composition. We evaluate structural, spectroscopic, and electronic properties for various 2D/3D coordination patterns and discuss how (SH4&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H2S)n&#8208;type building blocks may relate to recent experimental studies of superconductivity in high&#8208;pressure materials of &#8220;SH3&#8221; stoichiometry.

         <title>Characterization of the Simplest Thiolimine: The Higher Energy Tautomer of Thioformamide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 22, Page 6732-6739, April 16, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Keep it simple! Thioamides resemble viable prebiotic building blocks for biologically relevant molecules. However, only a handful of experimental reports on parent thioformamide exist. X&#8208;ray diffraction data of thioformamide are reported and its tautomerization induced by UV irradiation under cryogenic conditions is presented. Four conformers of the corresponding thiolimine form, whose (tunneling) reactivity is investigated.







Abstract
As sulfur&#8208;containing organic molecules thioamides and their isomers are conceivable intermediates in prebiotic chemistry, for example, in the formation of amino acids and thiazoles and resemble viable candidates for detection in interstellar media. Here, we report the characterization of parent thioformamide in the solid state via single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and its photochemical interconversion to its hitherto unreported higher energy tautomer thiolimine in inert argon and dinitrogen matrices. Upon photogeneration, four conformers of thiolimine form, whose ratio depends on the employed wavelength. One of these conformers interconverts due to quantum mechanical tunneling with a half&#8208;life of 30&#8211;45&#8197;min in both matrix materials at 3 and 20&#8197;K. A spontaneous reverse reaction from thiolimine to thioformamide is not observed. To support our experimental findings, we explored the potential energy surface of the system at the AE&#8208;CCSD(T)/aug&#8208;cc&#8208;pCVTZ level of theory and computed tunneling half&#8208;lives with the CVT/SCT approach applying DFT methods.

         <title>Circularly Polarized Luminescence of Achiral Metal&#8211;Organic Colloids and Guest Molecules in a Vortex Field</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 22, Page 6760-6766, April 16, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Spinning around: Two metal&#8211;organic colloids based on achiral starting materials show active CD and circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) properties in a vortex field. The optical properties of the colloids can be transferred to achiral Rhodamine derivatives, with glum 10&#8722;2 in magnitude and quantum yields of 40&#8211;83&#8201;%.







Abstract
Recently, scientists have reported a range of chiral fluorescence materials or chiral composites that can emit circularly polarized luminescence. Herein, two achiral metal&#8211;organic colloidal solutions were studied, showing active circularly polarized luminescence, which is observed in vortex stirring. The absolute values for glum are 0.05 and 0.03 and the plus or minus sign of glum depends on the colloidal structure and stirring direction, which make the property easy to manipulate. Further, the host&#8211;guest interaction study suggests both electrostatic interactions and coordination bonding may influence the chiroptical property from the colloidal solution to the guest molecule.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Spinning around&lt;/b&gt;: Two metal&#8211;organic colloids based on achiral starting materials show active CD and circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) properties in a vortex field. The optical properties of the colloids can be transferred to achiral Rhodamine derivatives, with &lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;lum&lt;/sub&gt; 10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; in magnitude and quantum yields of 40&#8211;83&#8201;%.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently, scientists have reported a range of chiral fluorescence materials or chiral composites that can emit circularly polarized luminescence. Herein, two achiral metal&#8211;organic colloidal solutions were studied, showing active circularly polarized luminescence, which is observed in vortex stirring. The absolute values for &lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;lum&lt;/sub&gt; are 0.05 and 0.03 and the plus or minus sign of &lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;lum&lt;/sub&gt; depends on the colloidal structure and stirring direction, which make the property easy to manipulate. Further, the host&#8211;guest interaction study suggests both electrostatic interactions and coordination bonding may influence the chiroptical property from the colloidal solution to the guest molecule. Rhodamine 6G and its carboxylic acid derivative exhibit good quantum yields and acceptable &lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;lum&lt;/sub&gt; values in the colloidal solution.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Fluorogenic Squaraine Dendrimers for Background&#8208;Free Imaging of Integrin Receptors in Cancer Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 22, Page 6795-6803, April 16, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fluorogenic dendrimer probe for imaging membrane receptors has been developed. It combines eight squaraine dyes that undergo polarity&#8208;dependent aggregation&#8211;disaggregation within the dendrimer, resulting in OFF&#8211;ON fluorescence response to a biomolecular target. It enables integrin&#8208;specific imaging of cancer cells with high signal&#8208;to&#8208;background ratio.







Abstract
To overcome the limited brightness of existing fluorogenic molecular probes for biomolecular targets, we introduce a concept of fluorogenic dendrimer probe, which undergoes polarity&#8208;dependent switching due to intramolecular aggregation&#8208;caused quenching of its fluorophores. Based on a rational design of dendrimers with four and eight squaraine dyes, we found that octamer bearing dyes through a sufficiently long PEG(8) linker displays &gt;400&#8208;fold fluorescence enhancement from water to non&#8208;polar dioxane. High extinction coefficient (&#8776;2,300,000&#8201;m&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;1) resulted from eight squaraine dyes and quantum yield (&#8776;25&#8201;%) make this octamer the brightest environment&#8208;sensitive fluorogenic molecule reported to date. Its conjugate with cyclic RGD used at low concentration (3&#8197;nm) enables integrin&#8208;specific fluorescence imaging of cancer cells with high signal&#8208;to&#8208;background ratio. The developed dendrimer probe is a &#8220;golden middle&#8221; between molecular probes and nanoparticles, combining small size, turn&#8208;on response and high brightness, important for bioimaging.

         <title>Uranium versus Thorium: Synthesis and Reactivity of [&#951;5&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;(Me3C)3C5H2]2U[&#951;2&#8208;C2Ph2]</title>

         <dc:description>
The intrinsic reactivity of a stable uranium metallacyclopropene complex, [&#951;5&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;(Me3C)3C5H2]2U(&#951;2&#8208;C2Ph2), was evaluated and compared to that of other uranium and thorium metallacyclopropenes. Although structurally similar, the thorium and uranium metallacyclopropenes exhibit distinctively different reactivity.







Abstract
The synthesis, electronic structure, and reactivity of a uranium metallacyclopropene were comprehensively studied. Addition of diphenylacetylene (PhC&#8801;CPh) to the uranium phosphinidene metallocene [&#951;5&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;(Me3C)3C5H2]2U=P&#8208;2,4,6&#8208;tBu3C6H2 (1) yields the stable uranium metallacyclopropene, [&#951;5&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;(Me3C)3C5H2]2U[&#951;2&#8208;C2Ph2] (2). Based on density functional theory (DFT) results the 5f orbital contributions to the bonding within the metallacyclopropene U&#8208;(&#951;2&#8208;C=C) moiety increases significantly compared to the related ThIV compound [&#951;5&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;(Me3C)3C5H2]2Th[&#951;2&#8208;C2Ph2], which also results in more covalent bonds between the [&#951;5&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;(Me3C)3C5H2]2U2+ and [&#951;2&#8208;C2Ph2]2&#8722; fragments. Although the thorium and uranium complexes are structurally closely related, different reaction patterns are therefore observed. For example, 2 reacts as a masked synthon for the low&#8208;valent uranium(II) metallocene [&#951;5&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;(Me3C)3C5H2]2UII when reacted with Ph2E2 (E=S, Se), alkynes and a variety of hetero&#8208;unsaturated molecules such as imines, ketazine, bipy, nitriles, organic azides, and azo derivatives. In contrast, five&#8208;membered metallaheterocycles are accessible when 2 is treated with isothiocyanate, aldehydes, and ketones.

Shine on me! Photocatalytic Giese&#8208;type reactions with alkylsilicates bearing C,O&#8208;bidentate ligands as alkyl radical precursors are reported. Not only primary, secondary, and tertiary alkyl radicals, but also elusive methyl radicals, can be generated under the present reaction system. This radical generation process is investigated by theoretical calculations.







Abstract
Herein, a photocatalytic Giese&#8208;type reaction with alkylsilicates bearing C,O&#8208;bidentate ligands as stable alkyl radical precursors has been reported. The alkylsilicates were prepared in one step from organometallic reagents. Not only primary, secondary, and tertiary alkyl radicals, but also elusive methyl radicals, could be generated by using the present reaction system. The generated radicals were trapped by electron&#8208;deficient olefins bearing various functional groups to give the desired alkyl adducts. The silicon byproduct can be recovered after the photoreaction. The radical generation process was investigated by theoretical calculations, which provided an insight into the facile generation of methyl radicals from methylsilicate bearing C,O&#8208;bidentate ligands.

         <title>A Robust Mesoporous Al2O3&#8208;Based Nanocomposite Catalyst for Abundant NOx Storage with Rational Design of Pt and Ba Species</title>

Storing NOx: A rational example for the preparation of a nanocomposite catalyst showing improved NOx storage properties and originating from Ba species is demonstrated through the use of a well&#8208;designed mesoporous alumina (Al2O3) support. Impregnation of Ba species can be completed successfully with retention of the mesoporous structure only after full crystallization of the Al2O3 framework to its &#947;&#8208;phase with the formation of Pt nanoparticles inside the Al2O3 particles.







Abstract
The nanostructural design of heterogeneous catalysts has often been demanded for assessing synergetic effects, which should be developed further by using high&#8208;surface&#8208;area porous metal oxide supports. However, such opportunities have been undermined by the poor stability of ordered mesoporous structures. Herein, rational design is demonstrated to obtain nanocomposite catalysts showing improved NOx storage properties owing to the presence of Ba species over a well&#8208;designed mesoporous alumina (Al2O3) support. It is found that Ba species are impregnated successfully only after the stabilization of the mesoporous structure by full crystallization of Al2O3 frameworks to the &#947;&#8208;phase, with the formation of Pt nanoparticles coinciding with complete removal of organic components. All the insights during this synthetic procedure are essential for designing high&#8208;performance catalysts to purify and recover NOx molecules, and are applied for designing a variety of cutting&#8208;edge mesoporous nanocomposite catalysts.

         <title>Tuning the Properties of MOF&#8208;808 via Defect Engineering and Metal Nanoparticle Encapsulation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 22, Page 6804-6814, April 16, 2021. </description>

Defects and metal nanoparticle encapsulations have been shown to have significant impacts on structure, texture, morphology and reactivity of the synthesized MOFs. Control over defects creation and metal nanoparticle encapsulations can become useful avenues to adjust the properties of MOFs.







Abstract
Defect engineering and metal encapsulation are considered as valuable approaches to fine&#8208;tune the reactivity of metal&#8211;organic frameworks. In this work, various MOF&#8208;808 (Zr) samples are synthesized and characterized with the final aim to understand how defects and/or platinum nanoparticle encapsulation act on the intrinsic and reactive properties of these MOFs. The reactivity of the pristine, defective and Pt encapsulated MOF&#8208;808 is quantified with water adsorption and CO2 adsorption calorimetry. The results reveal strong competitive effects between crystal morphology and missing linker defects which in turn affect the crystal morphology, porosity, stability, and reactivity. In spite of leading to a loss in porosity, the introduction of defects (missing linkers or Pt nanoparticles) is beneficial to the stability of the MOF&#8208;808 towards water and could also be advantageously used to tune adsorption properties of this MOF family.

         <title>Unveiling Luminescent IrI and RhI N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene Complexes: Structure, Photophysical Specifics, and Cellular Localization in the Endoplasmic Reticulum</title>

Anticancer NHC complexes: RhI and IrI N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) complexes provide an auspicious class of potential new anticancer agents; however, cellular imaging with luminescent derivatives of these complex types is often hampered by luminescence quenching. Building on an analysis of the parameters for metal&#8208;induced quenching processes, new examples of this complex class are designed with properties suitable for cellular imaging. Their main localization in the endoplasmic reticulum is not only an unprecedented finding but also represents the first ever insight into the cellular localization of Ir(NHC) complexes in the oxidation state +I.







Abstract
Complexes of RhI and IrI of the [M(COD)(NHC)X] type (where M=Rh or Ir, COD=1,5&#8208;cyclooctadiene, NHC=N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene, and X=halide) have recently shown promising cytotoxic activities against several cancer cell lines. Initial mechanism of action studies provided some knowledge about their interaction with DNA and proteins. However, information about their cellular localization remains scarce owing to luminescence quenching within this complex type. Herein, the synthesis of two rare examples of luminescent RhI and IrI [M(COD)(NHC)I] complexes with 1,8&#8208;naphthalimide&#8208;based emitting ligands is reported. All new complexes are comprehensively characterized, including with single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray structures. Steric crowding in one derivative leads to two distinct rotamers in solution, which apparently can be distinguished both by pronounced NMR shifts and by their respective spectral and temporal emission signatures. When the photophysical properties of these new complexes are exploited for cellular imaging in HT&#8208;29 and PT&#8208;45 cancer cell lines, it is demonstrated that the complexes accumulate predominantly in the endoplasmic reticulum, which is an entirely new finding and provides the first insight into the cellular localization of such IrI(NHC) complexes.

         <title>Combined Ex and In Situ Measurements Elucidate the Dynamics of Retained Species in ZSM&#8208;5 and SAPO&#8208;18 Catalysts Used in the Methanol&#8208;to&#8208;Olefins Reaction</title>

The methanol&#8208;to&#8208;olefins (MTO) reaction generates many retained species in the catalyst that evolve from active species for the formation of olefins to deactivating species leaving coke deposits. The active species can be detected by a combination of ex situ temperature&#8208;programmed desorption (TPD) and extraction measurements whereas the deactivating species by ex situ temperature&#8208;programmed oxidation (TPO), and both of them by in situ FTIR spectroscopy, which allows their dynamics to be followed in the MTO reaction performance.







Abstract
The dynamics of the retained species on ZSM&#8208;5 and SAPO&#8208;18 catalysts are studied by using a combination of temperature&#8208;programmed desorption/oxidation, ex situ analysis, and in situ FTIR spectroscopic measurements over the entire conversion range, using fixed&#8208;bed and spectroscopic cell reactors, in continuous and discontinuous mode. The results point to the appropriateness of the combined methodologies to track the interconversion of active into deactivating species. A statistically relevant (supported by linear regression and multivariate analysis) association of the observations is found by using the different complementary methodologies. The kinetics of this interconversion depends on the initial conversion (tuned by acidity and space time) and microporous topology, and involve: (i)&#8197;in the ZSM&#8208;5 catalysts, the diffusion of monocyclic aromatics toward the exterior of the zeolite to form coke, and (ii)&#8197;in the SAPO&#8208;18 catalysts, the obstruction of the cavities by aromatics that grow into tetracyclic aromatic islands.

Minidumbbell (MDB) is a recently identified non&#8208;B DNA structure that has been proposed to associate with genetic instabilities. It also serves as a functional structural motif in DNA nanotechnology. DNA molecular switches constructed using MDBs show instant and complete structural conversions with easy manipulations. The availability of stable MDBs can broaden their applications. In this work, we found that substitutions of cytosine with 5&#8208;methylcytosine could lead to a significant enhancement in the thermal stabilities of MDBs. Consecutive methylations of cytosine in MDBs brought about cumulative stabilization with a drastic increase in the melting temperature by 23&#8201;&#176;C. NMR solution structures of two MDBs containing 5&#8208;methylcytosine residues have been successfully determined and revealed that the enhanced stabilities resulted primarily from favorable hydrophobic contacts, more stable base pairs and enhanced base&#8208;base stackings involving the methyl group of 5&#8208;methylcytosine.

A photocatalytic Giese&#8208;type reaction using alkylsilicates bearing C,O&#8208;bidentate ligands as stable alkyl radical precursors has been reported. Not only primary, secondary, and tertiary alkyl radicals but also elusive methyl radicals could be generated using the present reaction system. The generated radicals were trapped by electron&#8208;deficient olefins bearing various functional groups to give the desired alkyl adducts. Theoretical calculations provide an insight on the facile generation of methyl radicals from methylsilicate bearing C,O&#8208;bidentate ligands. More information can be found in the Full Paper by T. Morofuji, N. Kano et&#8197;al. on page 6713.

Containers of chemical species: The painting illustrates a bottle and a vase containing chemical species. In a bottle, like in the case of SAPO&#8208;18 and similar structures, the species that are larger than the bottleneck cannot exit and remain trapped inside (ship in a bottle). Contrariwise, in a vase with no bottleneck, like in the case of ZSM&#8208;5 and similar structures, these species can exit and few remain trapped.

         <dc:description>
Binding hydrophilic guests: This Review highlights strategies that have been developed in the field of supramolecular chemistry to selectively and non&#8208;covalently bind three classes of biologically relevant molecules: nucleotides, carbohydrates, and amino acids. As several groups have systematically modified receptors for a specific guest, an evolutionary perspective is also provided in some cases. Trends in the most effective binding forces for each class are described, providing insight into selectivity and potential directions for future work. For more details see the Review by M.&#8197;L. Waters on page 6620.

Exsolution is a relatively new research hotspot which can be traced back to 2002. In the Minireview on page 6666, C. Tang, K. Kousi, D. Neagu, and I.&#8197;S. Metcalfe review the, approximately, 70 studies published so far, on bimetallic exsolution and identified research trends in this area. It has been demonstrated that exsolution can endow bimetallic particles with advantages in the terms of high catalytic activity, improved electrochemical properties, prolonged durability and strong resistance to deactivation in a wide range of applications mainly including electrochemistry and catalysis.

         <title>Frontispiece: f&#8208;Block Phospholyl and Arsolyl Chemistry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 22, April 16, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The f&#8208;block chemistry of phospholyl and arsolyl ligands, heavier p&#8208;block analogues of substituted cyclopentadienyls (CpR, C5R5) where one or more CR groups are replaced by P or As atoms, is less developed than for lighter isoelectronic C5R5 rings. In their Review on page 6645, D.&#8197;P. Mills and P. Evans present a review of this field to coincide with the renaissance in f&#8208;block solution chemistry and renewed interest in phospholyl and arsolyl f&#8208;block chemistry in the last two decades. The syntheses of all structurally characterised examples of lanthanide and actinide phospholyl and arsolyl complexes to date are covered, including benzannulated derivatives, and together with group&#8197;3 complexes for completeness.

Discrete oligomer models of doped PEDOT (poly(ethylenedioxythiophene)) are reported in this work. Combination of the atomic&#8208;level structural analyses and physical property measurements of the discrete oligomer systems revealed strong &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions along the stacking direction as the origin of the excellent conductivity of doped PEDOT. We constructed the shortest dimer model, EDOT dimer radical cation, in single&#8208;crystal forms. The analogs showed unique one&#8208;dimensional &#960;&#8208;stacking structures with extensively strong intermolecular orbital interaction, which may be the origin of doped PEDOT's high conductivity. More information can be found in the Communication by T.&#8197;Fujino, H.&#8197;Mori, et&#8197;al. on page 6696.

Exsolved bimetallic nanoparticles have attracted a lot of attention because they combine high stability and potential to control key particle properties (size, composition, structure, morphology, etc.) endowed by the exsolution method with additional unique properties mainly originating from the synergistic effects between the two different metals. These materials have enabled step&#8208;change advances across a wide range of applications including electrochemical energy conversion and heterogenous catalysis. In this review the trends and advances of exsolution of bimetallic systems are presented and future directions of research provided.







Abstract
Supported bimetallic nanoparticles used for various chemical transformations appear to be more appealing than their monometallic counterparts, because of their unique properties mainly originating from the synergistic effects between the two different metals. Exsolution, a relatively new preparation method for supported nanoparticles, has earned increasing attention for bimetallic systems in the past decade, not only due to the high stability of the resulting nanoparticles but also for the potential to control key particle properties (size, composition, structure, morphology, etc.). In this review, we summarize the trends and advances on exsolution of bimetallic systems and provide prospects for future studies in this field.

         <title>f&#8208;Block Phospholyl and Arsolyl Chemistry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 22, Page 6645-6665, April 16, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Rare earth and actinide phospholyl and arsolyl chemistry is reviewed herein, focusing on structurally characterised complexes where the binding mode of the ligand is well&#8208;defined. A range of binding modes is shown for unsubstituted phospholyl rings, where M=rare earth or actinide metal and E=P, As or Sb; arsolyl binding modes are analogous.







Abstract
The f&#8208;block chemistry of phospholyl and arsolyl ligands, heavier p&#8208;block analogues of substituted cyclopentadienyls (CpR, C5R5) where one or more CR groups are replaced by P or As atoms, is less developed than for lighter isoelectronic C5R5 rings. Heterocyclopentadienyl complexes can exhibit properties that complement and contrast with CpR chemistry.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Rare earth and actinide&lt;/b&gt; phospholyl and arsolyl chemistry is reviewed herein, focusing on structurally characterised complexes where the binding mode of the ligand is well&#8208;defined. A range of binding modes is shown for unsubstituted phospholyl rings, where M=rare earth or actinide metal and E=P, As or Sb; arsolyl binding modes are analogous.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The f&#8208;block chemistry of phospholyl and arsolyl ligands, heavier p&#8208;block analogues of substituted cyclopentadienyls (Cp&lt;sup&gt;R&lt;/sup&gt;, C&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;R&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;) where one or more CR groups are replaced by P or As atoms, is less developed than for lighter isoelectronic C&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;R&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; rings. Heterocyclopentadienyl complexes can exhibit properties that complement and contrast with Cp&lt;sup&gt;R&lt;/sup&gt; chemistry. Given that there has been renewed interest in phospholyl and arsolyl f&#8208;block chemistry in the last two decades, coinciding with a renaissance in f&#8208;block solution chemistry, a review of this field is timely.

         <title>Mimicking Biological Recognition: Lessons in Binding Hydrophilic Guests in Water</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 22, Page 6620-6644, April 16, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydrophilic guests are particularly challenging to selectively bind in water, but selective recognition of hydrophilic molecules is vital in biological processes. In this Review, strategies to develop synthetic receptors that address this challenge are highlighted, with application to nucleotides, carbohydrates, and amino acids. This body of work provides general insights as well as future directions for the field.







Abstract
Selective molecular recognition of hydrophilic guests in water plays a fundamental role in a vast number of biological processes, but synthetic mimicry of biomolecular recognition in water still proves challenging both in terms of achieving comparable affinities and selectivities. This Review highlights strategies that have been developed in the field of supramolecular chemistry to selectively and non&#8208;covalently bind three classes of biologically relevant molecules: nucleotides, carbohydrates, and amino acids. As several groups have systematically modified receptors for a specific guest, an evolutionary perspective is also provided in some cases. Trends in the most effective binding forces for each class are described, providing insight into selectivity and potential directions for future work.

         <title>The Simplest Model for Doped Poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT): Single&#8208;crystalline EDOT Dimer Radical Cation Salts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 22, Page 6696-6700, April 16, 2021. </description>

Shortest oligomer models for doped PEDOT: Single&#8208;crystalline dimer models for doped poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) were developed to understand the underlying conduction mechanism of doped PEDOT. The models exhibited one&#8208;dimensional &#960;&#8208;stacking single&#8208;crystal structures possessing half&#8208;filled band structures with exclusively high intracolumnar orbital interactions, implying the origin of the excellent conductivity of doped PEDOT.







Abstract
Although doped poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) is extensively used in electronic devices, their molecular&#8208;weight distributions and inadequately defined structures have hindered the elucidation of their underlying conduction mechanism. In this study, we introduce the simplest discrete oligomer models: EDOT dimer radical cation salts. Single&#8208;crystal structural analyses revealed their one&#8208;dimensional (1D) columnar structures, in which the donors were uniformly stacked. Band calculations identified 1D metallic band structures with a strong intracolumnar orbital interaction (band width W&#8776;1&#8197;eV), implying the origin of the high conductivity of doped PEDOT. Interestingly, the salts exhibited semiconducting behavior reminiscent of genuine Mott states as a result of electron&#8211;electron repulsion (U) dominant over W. This study realized basic models with tunable W and U to understand the conduction mechanism of doped PEDOT through structural modification in oligomers, including the conjugation length.

         <title>Conformational Switching through the One&#8208;Electron Reduction of an Acridinium&#8208;based, &#947;&#8208;Cationic Phosphine Gold Complex</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 22, Page 6701-6705, April 16, 2021. </description>

Switch it: The reduction of the acridinium&#8208;based &#947;&#8208;cationic phosphine gold chloride complex neutralizes the carbenium unit and affords a stable radical. Due to a perturbation of the electrostatic potential profile of the complex and donor&#8211;acceptor bonding interactions, this reduction alters the complex's conformation, with the linear phosphine&#8208;gold&#8208;chloride moiety undergoing a windshield&#8208;wiper&#8208;type motion over the surface of the acridinium ring.







Abstract
Our efforts in the chemistry of gold complexes featuring ambiphilic phosphine&#8208;carbenium L/Z&#8208;type ligand have led us to consider the reduction of the carbenium moiety as a means to modulate the gold&#8211;carbenium interaction present in these complexes. Here, it was shown that the one&#8208;electron reduction of [(o&#8208;Ph2P(C6H4)Acr)AuCl]+ (Acr=9&#8208;N&#8208;methylacridinium) produces a neutral stable radical, the structure of which showed a marked increase in the Au&#8211;Acr distance. Related structural changes were observed for the phosphine oxide analogue [(o&#8208;Ph2P(O)(C6H4)Acr]+, the reduction of which interfered with the P=O&#8594;carbenium interaction. These structural effects, driven by a reduction&#8208;induced change in the electronic and electrostatic characteristics of the compounds, showed that the charge and accepting properties of the carbenium unit can be modulated. These results highlight the redox&#8208;noninnocence of carbenium Z&#8208;type ligand, a feature that can be exploited to induce specific conformational changes.

The interplay between the quantum theory of atoms in molecules and the local potentials that appear in the Euler equation for electron density as well as the corresponding electronic inner&#8208;crystal forces of electrostatic and kinetic origin is explored. Novel physically grounded bonding descriptors derived within the orbital&#8208;free quantum crystallography provide the detailed examination of C=O&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; and &#960;&#8208;stacking interactions and nonclassical hydrogen bonds.







Abstract
A detailed analysis of a complete set of the local potentials that appear in the Euler equation for electron density is carried out for noncovalent interactions in the crystal of a uracil derivative using experimental X&#8208;ray charge density. The interplay between the quantum theory of atoms in molecules and crystals and the local potentials and corresponding inner&#8208;crystal electronic forces of electrostatic and kinetic origin is explored. Partitioning of crystal space into atomic basins and atomic&#8208;like potential basins led us to the definite description of interatomic interaction and charge transfer. Novel physically grounded bonding descriptors derived within the orbital&#8208;free quantum crystallography provided the detailed examination of &#960;&#8208;stacking and intricate C=O&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; interactions and nonclassical hydrogen bonds present in the crystal. The donor&#8208;acceptor character of these interactions is revealed by analysis of Pauli and von Weizs&#228;cker potentials together with well&#8208;known functions, e.&#8201;g., deformation electron density and electron localization function. In this way, our analysis throws light on aspects of these closed&#8208;shell interactions hitherto hidden from the description.

         <title>Urea&#8208;urease reaction in controlling properties of supramolecular hydrogels: Pros and Cons</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Supramolecular hydrogels are useful in many areas such as cell culturing, catalysis, sensing, tissue engineering, drug delivery, environmental remediation and optoelectronics. The gels need specific properties for each application. The properties arise from a fibrous network that forms the matrix. A common method to prepare hydrogels is to use a pH change. Most methods result in a sudden pH jump and often lead to gels that are hard to reproduce and control. The urease&#8208;urea reaction can be used to control hydrogel properties by a uniform and controlled pH increase as well as to set up pH cycles. The reaction involves hydrolysis of urea by urease and production of ammonia which increases the pH. The rate of ammonia production can be controlled which can be used to prepare gels with differing properties. Here we show how the urease&#8208;urea reaction can be used for the construction of next generation functional materials.</dc:description>

         <title>In&#8208;situ Generated Trimetallic Molybdate Nanoflowers on Ni Foam Assisted with  Microwave  for Highly Enhanced Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is considered as a critical half&#8208;cell reaction of water splitting, whose kinetic is sluggish even not favored, thus requiring highly active electrocatalysts to shrink the reaction energy barrier and improve the energy conversion efficiency. In this study, In&#8208;situ generated trimetallic molybdate nanoflowers on Ni foam by a straightforward and time&#8208;saving solvothermal method assisted with microwave, can not only bring synergistic effect into full play between multiple metals, but also construct a well&#8208;defined nanoflower&#8208;like structure accompanied by larger specific area (273.3 m  2  g  &#8208;1  ) and smaller size than the pristine NiMoO  4  . The resulting Ni  0.9  Al  0.1  MoO  4  &#8208;NF requires a relatively low overpotential of 266 mV for OER at 10 mA cm  &#8208;2  , which outperforms commercial RuO  2  catalysts (274 mV). Such excellent performances compare favorably to most previously reported NiMoO  4  &#8208;based electrocatalysts for OER. This work not only supply a facile method to construct a well&#8208;defined nanoflower&#8208;like structure on foam, but also broaden our horizons into the mechanism of OER in alkaline condition.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>A series of new [2,2] fluorenophanes &#160;were synthesized and characterized, among which molecules of crystallographically asymmetric&#160; anti&#8208;[2.2](1,4)(4,1)fluorenophane ( K2C&#8208;2) aggregate to form one&#8208;dimensional&#160; supramolecular &#160;chain structures through effective intermolecular&#160; &#960;&#8211;&#960;&#160; overlapping . This, in combination with the synergistic intramolecular&#160; &#960;&#8211;&#960;&#160; interaction, leads to prominent dual emission&#160; mediated by charge transfer (CT) exciton delocalization.

         <title>Chiral&#8208;at&#8208;Iron Catalyst for Highly Enantioselective and Diastereoselective Hetero&#8208;Diels&#8208;Alder Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This study demonstrates that chiral&#8208;at&#8208;iron complexes, in which all coordinated ligands are achiral and the overall chirality the consequence of a stereogenic iron center, are capable of catalyzing asymmetric transformations with very high enantioselectivities. The catalyst is based on a previously reported design (  J. Am. Chem. Soc.  2017  ,  139  , 4322), in which iron(II) is surrounded by two configurationally inert achiral bidentate N&#8208;(2&#8208;pyridyl)&#8208;substituted N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes in a  C  2  &#8208;symmetric fashion and complemented by two labile acetonitriles. By replacing mesityl with more bulky 2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl substituents at the NHC ligands, the steric hindrance at the catalytic site was increased, thereby providing a markedly improved asymmetric induction. The new chiral&#8208;at&#8208;iron catalyst was applied to the inverse electron demand hetero&#8208;Diels&#8208;Alder reaction between b,g&#8208;unsaturated a&#8208;ketoester and enol ethers provide 3,4&#8208;dihydro&#8208;2  H  &#8208;pyrans in high yields with excellent diastereoselectivities (up to 99:1 dr) and excellent enantioselectivities (up to 98:2 er). Other electron rich dienophiles are also suitable as demonstrated for a reaction with a vinyl azide.</dc:description>

         <title>1,2&#8208;Carbopentafluorophenylation of Alkynes: The Metallomimetic Pull&#8208;Push Reactivity of Tris(pentafluorophenyl)borane</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report the novel single&#8208;step 1,2&#8208;dicarbofunctionalization of an arylacetylene with an allylsilane and tris(pentafluorophenyl)borane[B(C6F5)3], involving C&#8211;C bond formation  with C&#8211;H bond scission at the  &#946;&#8208;position to the silicon atom of an allylsilane and B&#8594;C migration of a C6F5  group. The 1,2&#8208;carbopentafluorophenylation reaction occurs smoothly without the requirement for a catalyst or heating. Mechanistic studies suggest that the metallomimetic &#8220;pull&#8208;push&#8221; reactivity of B(C6F5)3  imparts consecutive electrophilic and nucleophilic characteristics to the benzylic carbon of the arylacetylene. Subsequent photochemical 6&#960;&#8208;electrocyclization affords tetrafluoronaphthalenes, which are important in the pharmaceutical and materials sciences. Owing to the unique reactivity of B(C6F5)3  , the 1,2&#8208;carbopentafluorophenylation using 2&#8208;substituted furan proceeded with ring opening, and the reaction using silyl enolates formed C&#8211;C bond with C&#8211;O bond scission at the silyloxy&#8208;substituted carbon.</dc:description>

         <title>Using small molecules to enhance P450 OleT enzyme activity in situ</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cytochrome P450 OleT is a fatty acid decarboxylase that catalyzes the production of olefins with biofuel and synthetic applications. However, the relatively sluggish catalytic efficiency of the enzyme limits its applications. Here we report the application of a novel class of benzene containing small molecules to improve the OleT activity. The UV&#8208;Vis spectroscopy study and molecular docking results confirmed the high proximity of the small molecules to heme group of OleT. Up to 6&#8208;fold increase of product yield has been achieved in the small molecule&#8208;modulated enzymatic reactions. Our work thus sheds the light to the application of small molecules to increase the OleT catalytic efficiency, which could be potentially used for future olefin&#8208;productions.</dc:description>

         <title>Solvent&#8208;dependent Stabilization of a Charge Transfer State is the Key to Ultrafast Triplet State Formation in an Epigenetic DNA Nucleoside</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>2'&#8208;Deoxy&#8208;5&#8208;formylcytidine (5fdCyd), a naturally occurring nucleoside found in mammalian DNA and mitochondrial RNA, exhibits important epigenetic functionality in biological processes. Because it efficiently generates triplet excited states, it is an endogenous photosensitizer capable of damaging DNA, but the intersystem crossing (ISC) mechanism responsible for ultrafast triplet state generation is poorly understood. In this study, time&#8208;resolved mid&#8208;IR spectroscopy and quantum mechanical calculations reveal the distinct ultrafast ISC mechanisms of 5fdCyd in water vs. acetonitrile. Our experiment indicates that in water, ISC to triplet states occurs within 1 ps after 285 nm excitation. PCM&#8208;TD&#8208;DFT computations suggest that this ultrafast ISC is mediated by a singlet state with significant cytosine&#8208;to&#8208;formyl charge&#8208;transfer (CT) character. In contrast, ISC in acetonitrile proceeds via a dark  1  n&#960;* state with a lifetime of ~3 ps. CT&#8208;induced ISC is not favored in acetonitrile because reaching the minimum of the gateway CT state is hampered by intramolecular hydrogen bonding which enforces planarity between the aldehyde group and the aromatic group. Our study provides a comprehensive picture of the non&#8208;radiative decay of 5fdCyd in solution and new insights into the factors governing ISC in biomolecules. We propose that the intramolecular CT state observed here is a key to the excited&#8208;state dynamics of epigenetic nucleosides with modified exocyclic functional groups, paving the way to study their effects in DNA strands.</dc:description>

         <title>Multifunctional heterometallic IrIII&#8208;AuI probes as promising anticancer and antiangiogenic agents</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A new class of emissive cyclometallated Ir  III  &#8208;Au  I  complexes with a bis(diphenylphosphino) methanide bridging ligand was successfully synthesised from the diphosphino complex [Ir(N^C)  2  (dppm)]  +  (  1  ). The different gold ancillary ligand, a triphenylphosphine (  2  ), a chloride (  3  ) or a thiocytosine (  4  ), did not revealed a significant effect on the photophysical properties, which are mainly due to metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand&#8208;charge&#8208;transfer (  3  MLCT) transitions based on Ir  III  . However, the Au  I  fragment, along with used the ancillary ligand, seemed crucial for the bioactivity performance in A549 lung carcinoma cells  vs  endothelial cells. Both cell types display variable sensitivities to the complexes (IC  50  = 0.6 &#8208; 3.5 &#181;M). Apoptotic pathway is activated in all cases and paraptotic cell death seems to take place at initial stages in A549 cells. Species  2  &#8208;  4  showed at least dual lysosomal and mitochondrial biodistribution in A549 cells, with an initial lysosomal localisation and a possible trafficking process between both organelles with time. The bimetallic Ir  III  &#8208;Au  I  complexes exhibited disruption of the mitochondrial transmembrane potential in A549 cells as well as greater reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and thioredoxin reductase (TrxR) inhibition in comparison with that displayed by the monometallic complex  1  . Angiogenic activity assays performed in endothelial cells revealed the promising antimetastatic potential of  1  ,  2  and  4  .</dc:description>

         <title>Redox Chemistry of Heterobimetallic Polypnictogen Triple&#8208;Decker Complexes &#8211; Rearrangement, Fragmentation and Transfer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The redox chemistry of the heterobimetallic triple&#8208;decker complexes [(Cp*Fe)(Cp&#8217;&#8217;&#8217;Co)(&#956;,&#951;  5  :&#951;  4  &#8208;E  5  )] (E = P (  1  ), As (  2  ), Cp* = 1,2,3,4,5&#8208;pentamethyl&#8208;cyclopentadienyl, Cp&#8217;&#8217;&#8217; = 1,2,4&#8208;tri&#8208;tertbutyl&#8208;cyclopentadienyl) and [(Cp&#8217;&#8217;&#8217;Co)(Cp&#8217;&#8217;&#8217;Ni)(&#956;,&#951;  3  :&#951;  3  &#8208;E  3  )] (E = P (  10  ), As (  11  )) was investigated. 1  and  2  could be oxidized to the monocations  3  and  4  and further to the dications  5  and  6  , while the initially folded cyclo&#8208;E  5  ligand planarizes upon oxidation. The reduction leads to an opposite change in the geometry of the middle deck, which is now folded stronger into the direction of the other metal fragment (formation of monoanions  7  and  8  ). For the arsenic compound  8  , a different behavior is found since a fragmentation into an As  6  (  9  ) and As  3  ligand complex occurs. The Co and Ni triple&#8208;decker complexes  10  and  11  can be oxidized initially to the heterometallic monocations  12  and  13  , which are not stable in solution and convert selectively into the homometallic nickel complexes  14  and  15  and the cobalt complexes  16  and  17  . This behavior was further proven by the oxidation of [(Cp&#8217;&#8217;&#8217;Co)(Cp&#8217;&#8217;Ni)(&#956;,&#951;  3  :&#951;  2  &#8208;P  3  )] (  19  , Cp&#8217;&#8217; = 1,3&#8208;di&#8208;tertbutyl&#8208;cyclopentadienyl) comprising two different Cp ligands. The transfer of {Cp  R  M} fragments can be suppressed when a {W(CO)  5  } unit is coordinated to the P  3  ligand (  20  ) prior to the oxidation and the mixed cobalt and nickel cation  21  can be isolated. The reduction of  10  and  11  yields the heterometallic monoanions  22  and  23 .</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The redox chemistry of the heterobimetallic triple&#8208;decker complexes [(Cp*Fe)(Cp&#8217;&#8217;&#8217;Co)(&#956;,&#951;  5  :&#951;  4  &#8208;E  5  )] (E = P (  1  ), As (  2  ), Cp* = 1,2,3,4,5&#8208;pentamethyl&#8208;cyclopentadienyl, Cp&#8217;&#8217;&#8217; = 1,2,4&#8208;tri&#8208;tertbutyl&#8208;cyclopentadienyl) and [(Cp&#8217;&#8217;&#8217;Co)(Cp&#8217;&#8217;&#8217;Ni)(&#956;,&#951;  3  :&#951;  3  &#8208;E  3  )] (E = P (  10  ), As (  11  )) was investigated. 1  and  2  could be oxidized to the monocations  3  and  4  and further to the dications  5  and  6  , while the initially folded cyclo&#8208;E  5  ligand planarizes upon oxidation. The reduction leads to an opposite change in the geometry of the middle deck, which is now folded stronger into the direction of the other metal fragment (formation of monoanions  7  and  8  ). For the arsenic compound  8  , a different behavior is found since a fragmentation into an As  6  (  9  ) and As  3  ligand complex occurs.

         <title>Conductive Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks: Electronic Structure and Electrochemical Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Smarter and minimization of devices are consistently substantial to shape the energy landscape. Significant amounts of endeavours have come forward as promising steps to surmount this formidable challenge. It is undeniable that material scientists were contemplating smarter material beyond purely inorganic or organic materials. To our delight, metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs), an inorganic&#8208;organic hybrid scaffold with unprecedented tunability and smart functionalities, have recently started their journey as an alternative. In this review, we focus on such propitious potential of MOFs that was untapped over a long time. We cover the synthetic strategies and (or) post&#8208;synthetic modifications towards the formation of conductive MOFs and their underlying concepts of charge transfer with structural aspects. We addressed theoretical calculations with the experimental outcomes and spectroelectrochemistry, which will trigger vigorous impetus about intrinsic electronic behaviour of the conductive frameworks. Finally, we discussed electrocatalysts and energy storage devices stemming from conductive MOFs to meet energy demand in the near future.</dc:description>

         <title>Reactions of C60 with Pyridazine and Phthalazine</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The benzoannulation of pyridazine changes its electronic structure drastically, thus rendering the pericyclic reaction with C60 efficient. Theoretical calculations suggested that the reaction proceeds with normal electron demand in contrast to hitherto considered inverse&#8208;electron&#8208;demand pathway. Therefore, the enhanced reactivity could be explained by the better interaction between the LUMO of C60 and the HOMO of phthalazine.







Abstract
Cage&#8208;opened bisfulleroids are one of suitable building blocks for making a large hole on fullerenes. This work focuses on the Diels&#8208;Alder reaction of C60 with azines, among synthetic methods developed thus far, to provide bisfulleroids. Surprisingly, the computational study predicted that the reaction proceeds with normal electron demand in contrast to hitherto considered inverse&#8208;electron&#8208;demand pathway. The benzoannulation to the pyridazine ring, i.&#8201;e., phthalazine, resulted in the remarkably shortened reaction time due to the better interaction between the HOMO of phthalazine and the LUMO of C60 as well as stronger 2,3&#8208;diaza&#8208;1,3&#8208;butadiene character in the phthalazine as confirmed crystallographically. Contrary to expectations, the benzobisfulleroid was converted into corresponding orifice&#8208;enlarged derivative via the photooxygenation slightly faster than the fulleroid derived from pyridazine.

         <title>High&#8208;pressure Nucleation of Low&#8208;Density Polymorphs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Low&#8208;density polymorphs obtained in a high&#8208;pressure environment are reported in this work. The single crystals were grown by the kinetic crystallization of the seeds precipitated in high&#8208;entropy conditions, owing to the extreme temperature and pressure in the confined space. This simple and inexpensive method opens a colorful palette of polymorphic forms inaccessible with traditional methods. More information can be found in the Full Paper by A.&#8197;Katrusiak et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202005121).

         <title>Probing Multiconfigurational States by Spectroscopy: The Cerium XAS L3&#8208;edge Puzzle</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The puzzling two&#8208;peaked X&#8208;ray absorption structure at the Ce L3 edge provides a wealth of information about the electronic structure of Ce complexes, such as the Ce 4f occupation and oxidation state and the extent of metal&#8208;ligand covalency. Multiconfigurational wavefunction calculations of the Ce L3 edges in CeO2 and Ce(C8H8)2, reveal the identity of the two&#8208;peaked edge structures and connection with the configurational admixture of the spectroscopically probed electronic states.

         <title>Rediscovering Sulfinylamines as Reagents for Organic Synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sulfinylamines (R&#8208;N=S=O), monoaza analogues of sulfur dioxide, have been known for well over a century, and their reactivity as sulfur electrophiles and in Diels&#8208;Alder reactions is well&#8208;established. However, they have only rarely been used in organic synthesis in recent decades despite the increasing prominence of compounds containing N=S=O functionality, such as sulfoximines and sulfonimidamides. This Minireview aims to bring wider visibility to the unique chemistry enabled by this class of compounds. We focus on advances from the last 10 years, including the first examples of their use in the one&#8208;pot syntheses of sulfoximines and sulfonimidamides. Also covered are the reactions of sulfinylamines with carbon&#8208;centred radicals, their use for formation of heterocycles through cycloadditions, and catalytic enantioselective allylic oxidation of alkenes  via  a hetero&#8208;ene reaction. These examples highlight the different reactivity modes of sulfinylamines and their underappreciated potential for forming molecules which contain high&#8208; or low&#8208;valent sulfur, or even no sulfur at all.</dc:description>

         <title>The Most Active Oxidase&#8208;mimicking Mn2O3 Nanozyme for Biosensor Signal Generation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Oxidase&#8208;mimicking nanozymes are more desirable than peroxidase&#8208;mimicking ones since H  2  O  2  can be omitted. However, only a few nanomaterials are known for oxidase&#8208;like activities. In this work, we compared the activity of Mn  2  O  3  , Mn  3  O  4  and MnO  2  and found that Mn  2  O  3  had the highest oxidase activity. Interestingly, the activity of Mn  2  O  3  was even inhibited by H  2  O  2  . The oxidase&#8208;like activity of Mn  2  O  3  was not much affected by the presence of proteins such as bovine serum albumin (BSA), but the physisorption of antibodies to Mn  2  O  3  was not strong enough to withstand the displacement by BSA. We then reacted Mn  2  O  3  with 3&#8208;aminopropyltriethoxysilane to graft an amine group, which was used to conjugate antibodies using glutaraldehyde as a crosslinker. A one&#8208;step indirect competitive ELISA (icELISA) was developed for the detection of isocarbophos, and an IC  50  of 261.7 ng/mL was obtained, comparable with the results of the standard two&#8208;step assay using horseradish peroxidase (HRP)&#8208;labeled antibodies. This assay has the advantage of significant timesaving attractive for rapid detection of large amounts of samples. This work has discovered a highly efficient oxidase&#8208;mimicking nanozyme useful for various nano and analytical applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Exploring the Potential of Metallodrugs as Chemotherapeutics for Triple Negative Breast Cancer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This review focuses on studies of coordination and organometallic compounds as potential chemotherapeutics against triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) which has one of the poorest prognoses and worst survival rates from all breast cancer types. At present, chemotherapy is still the standard of care for TNBC since only one type of targeted therapy has been recently developed. We will list references for metal&#8208;based compounds studied in TNBC cell lines and those of metal&#8208;specific reviews, but we will provide a detailed overview on compounds studied  in vivo  (mostly in mice models) and those compounds for which some preliminary mechanistic data was obtained (in TNBC cell lines and tumors) and/or for which bioactive ligands have been used. The main goal of this review is to highlight the most promising metal&#8208;based compounds with potential as chemotherapeutic agents in TNBC.</dc:description>

         <title>Phenyl Silicates with Substituted Catecholate Ligands: Synthesis, Structural Studies and Reactivity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>While the generation of aryl radicals by photoredox catalysis is well&#8208;documented under reductive conditions, it has remained challenging under an oxidative pathway. Because of the easy photooxidation of alkyl bis&#8208;catecholato silicates, a general study on phenyl silicates bearing substituted catecholate ligands has been achieved. The newly synthesized phenyl silicates have been fully characterized and their reactivity has been explored. It was found that thanks to the substitution of the catecholate moiety and notably with the 4&#8208;cyanocatecholato ligand, the phenyl radical could be generated and trapped. Computational studies provided a rationale for these findings.</dc:description>

         <title>Polysaccharide Chemistry in drug delivery, endocrinology, and vaccines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polysaccharides due to their outstanding properties, have attracted the attention of researchers, working in the biomedical field and especially of those working in drug delivery. Modified/functionalized polysaccharides further increase the importance for various applications with every passing day. Delivery of therapeutics for diverse ailments in different body endocrine glands and hormones in a safe way is focal point of researchers working in the field. Among the routes followed, transdermal route is preferred due to non&#8208;exposure of active moieties to the harsh gastric environment and first pass metabolism. This review starts with the overview of polysaccharides used for the delivery of various therapeutic agents. Advantages of polysaccharides use in transdermal route are dealt in detail. Types of polysaccharides will be elaborated through examples and in this context, special emphasis will be on the polysaccharides being used for synthesis of the membranes/films. Techniques employed for their modification to design novel carriers for therapeutics delivery will also be discussed. The review will end with a brief discussion on recent developments and future perspectives for delivery of therapeutic agents.</dc:description>

         <title>High&#8208;pressure Nucleation of Low&#8208;Density Polymorphs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
&#8220;We found that the high&#8208;pressure high&#8208;temperature conditions can be effectively used for high&#8208;entropy nucleation of kinetic polymorphs! The high&#8208;entropy nucleation can be performed in the confined space of high&#8208;pressure chambers, where strong rota&#8208;vibrations of molecules can be agitated by heating. The molecules in various excited states require an additional space, but increased viscosity hampers the molecular reorientations or conformational changes before the nucleation.&#8221; Read more about the story behind the cover in the Cover Profile and about the research itself on page&#8197;&#9642;&#9642;&#8197;ff.

         <title>Fulvalene&#8208;Based Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbon Ladder&#8208;type Structures &#8211; Synthesis and Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) have found strong interest for their electronic properties and as model systems for graphene. While PAHs have been studied intensively as single units, we have here constructed PAHs in ladder&#8208;type arrangements using cross&#8208;conjugated fulvalene and dithiafulvalene motifs as connecting units and moving forward a convenient synthetic approach for dimerizing (thio)ketones into olefins by the action of Lawesson&#8217;s Reagent. The PAHs can also be regarded as &#8220;super&#8208;extended&#8221; tetrathiafulvalenes (TTFs) with some of the largest cores ever explored, being multi&#8208;redox systems that exhibit both reversible oxidations and reductions. Concomitant absorption redshifts were observed when expanding the ladder&#8208;type structures from one to two to three indenofluorene units, and optical and electrochemical HOMO&#8208;LUMO gaps were found to correlate linearly. Various conformations (and solid&#8208;state packing arrangements) were studied by X&#8208;ray crystallography and computations.</dc:description>

         <title>An Ultrastable Crystalline Acylhydrazone&#8208;Linked Covalent Organic Framework for Efficient Removal of Organic Micropollutants from Water</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>As an important member of crystalline porous polymers, acylhydrazone&#8208;linked covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have gained much attention in recent years. However, the low structural stability imparts a limit towards their practical applications. To tackle this problem, we report here a new and simple strategy to increase the chemical stability of acylhydrazone&#8208;linked COFs by incorporating azobenzene groups in the conjugated framework. Through reinforcing the &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking interactions between the adjacent layers with increased &#960;&#8208;surface, it is surprising to find that the resulting materials exhibit extremely stability in harsh environments, such as strong acid, strong base, aqueous educing agent and boiling water, even exposed to air for one year. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, such framework has been used to remove various organic micropollutants such as antibiotics, plastic components, endocrine disruptors, and carcinogens from water with high capacity, fast speed and excellent reusability over a wide pH range at environmentally relevant concentrations.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;As an important member of crystalline porous polymers, acylhydrazone&#8208;linked covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have gained much attention in recent years. However, the low structural stability imparts a limit towards their practical applications.

         <title>Chiral Chromium Salen@rGO as Multipurpose and Recyclable Heterogeneous Catalyst</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The first immobilization of a pyrene&#8208;tagged chromium salen complex through &#960;&#8208;&#960; non&#8208;covalent interactions on reduced graphene oxide (rGO) is described. A very robust supported catalytic system is obtained to promote asymmetric catalysis in repeated cycles, without loss of activity or enantioselectivity. This specific behavior was demonstrated in two different catalytic reactions (up to ten reuses) promoted by chromium salen complexes, the cyclohexene oxide ring&#8208;opening reaction and the hetero&#8208;Diels&#8208;Alder cycloaddition between various aldehydes and Danishefsky&#8217;s diene. Furthermore, the chiral chromium salen@rGO has been found to be compatible with a multi&#8208;substrate type use, in which the structure of the substrate involved is modified each time the catalyst is reused.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthetic Approaches for 15N&#8208;labeled Hyperpolarized Heterocyclic Molecular Imaging Agents for 15N NMR Signal Amplification By Reversible Exchange in Microtesla Magnetic Fields</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>NMR hyperpolarization techniques enhance nuclear spin polarization by several orders of magnitude resulting in corresponding sensitivity gains. This massive sensitivity gain enables new applications ranging from studies of small molecules using high&#8208;resolution NMR spectroscopy to real&#8208;time metabolic imaging  in vivo  . Several hyperpolarization techniques exist for hyperpolarization of a large repertoire of nuclear spins, although  13  C&#8208; and  15  N&#8208; sites of biocompatible agents are the key targets due to their widespread in biochemical pathways. Moreover, their long T  1  allows retaining hyperpolarized states for up to tens of minutes. Signal Amplification by Reversible Exchange (SABRE) is a low&#8208;cost and ultrafast hyperpolarization technique that has been shown to be versatile for hyperpolarization of  15  N nuclei. While large sensitivity gains are enabled by hyperpolarization,  15  N natural abundance is only ~0.4%, so that isotopic labeling of the to&#8208;be&#8208;hyperpolarized molecules is required in order to take full advantage of the hyperpolarized state. Here, we describe selected advances in the preparation of  15  N&#8208;labeled compounds with the primary emphasis on using these compounds for their SABRE polarization in microtesla magnetic fields via spontaneous polarization transfer from parahydrogen. Also, these principles can certainly be applied for hyperpolarization of these emerging contrast agents using Dynamic Nuclear Polarization and other techniques.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrostatic Interaction to Achieve Hierarchical Interpenetrating Electroconductive Networks of Silicon Anodes for Fast Lithium Storage</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Recently, the frequency of combining MXene with unique properties such as metal&#8208;level conductivity and large specific surface area with silicon to obtain excellent electrochemical performance has greatly increased. Undoubtedly, the introduction of MXene can improve the conductivity of silicon and the cycling stability of electrodes after elaborate structure design. However, most of the exhaustive contacts can only achieve the improvement of electrode conductivity on the plane. Herein, MXene@Si/CNTs (HIEN&#8208;MSC) composite with hierarchical interpenetrating electroconductive networks is synthesized by electrostatic self&#8208;assembly method. In this process, the CNTs are first combined with silicon nanoparticles and then assembled with MXene nanosheets. The insertion of CNTs into silicon nanoparticles can not only reduce the agglomeration of silicon nanoparticles, but also fix them on the three&#8208;dimensional conductive framework composed of CNTs and MXene nanosheets. Therefore, the HIEN&#8208;MSC electrode shows superior rate performance (high reversible capacity of 280 mA h  &#8208;1  even tested at 10 A g  &#8208;1  ), cycling stability (stable reversible capacity of 547 mA h g  &#8208;1  after 200 cycles at 1 A g  &#8208;1  ) and applicability (a high reversible capacity of 101 mA h g  &#8208;1  after 50 cycles when assembled with NCM622 into a full cell). These results may provide new insights for other electrodes with excellent rate performance and long&#8208;cycle stability.</dc:description>

         <title>Selective, pH&#8208;Dependent Colorimetric and Fluorimetric Detection of Quadruplex DNA with 4&#8208;Dimethylamino(phenyl)&#8208;Substituted Berberine Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The 9&#8208; and 12&#8208;dimethylaminophenyl&#8208;substituted berberine derivatives  3a  and  3b  were readily synthesized by Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura reactions and shown to be useful fluorescent probes for the optical detection of quadruplex DNA (G4&#8208;DNA). Their association with the nucleic acids was investigated by spectrometric titrations, CD and LD spectroscopy, and with DNA&#8208;melting analysis. Both ligands bind to duplex DNA by intercalation and to G4&#8208;DNA by terminal &#960; stacking. At neutral conditions, they bind with higher affinity (Kb  = 105&#8211;106  M  &#8211;1) to represen&#173;tative quadruplex forming oligo&#173;nucleotides  22AG  ,  c&#8208;myc  ,  c&#8208;kit,  and  a2,  than to duplex calf thymus (ct) DNA (Kb  =&#160;5&#8211;7x104  M&#8211;1). At pH 5, however, the affinity of  3a  towards G4&#8208;DNA  22AG  is higher (Kb  = 1.2x106  M&#8211;1), whereas the binding constant towards ct DNA is lower (Kb  =&#160;3.9x103  M&#8211;1) than under neutral conditions. Notably, the association of the ligand with DNA results in characteristic changes of the absorption and emission properties under specific conditions, which may be used for optical DNA detection. Other than the parent berberine, the ligands do not show a noticeable increase of their very low intrinsic emission intensity upon association with DNA at neutral conditions. In contrast, a fluorescence light&#8208;up effect was observed upon association to duplex (&#934;fl  =&#160;0.01) and quadruplex DNA (&#934;fl  =&#160;0.04) at pH 5. This fluorimetric response to G4&#8208;DNA association in combination with the distinct red&#8208;shifted absorption under these conditions provides a simple and conclusive optical detection of G4&#8208;DNA at lower pH.</dc:description>

Their association with the nucleic acids was investigated by spectrometric titrations, CD and LD spectroscopy, and with DNA&#8208;melting analysis. Both ligands bind to duplex DNA by intercalation and to G4&#8208;DNA by terminal &#960; stacking. At neutral conditions, they bind with higher affinity (Kb  = 105&#8211;106  M  &#8211;1) to represen&#173;tative quadruplex forming oligo&#173;nucleotides  22AG  ,  c&#8208;myc  ,  c&#8208;kit,  and  a2,  than to duplex calf thymus (ct) DNA (Kb  =&#160;5&#8211;7x104  M&#8211;1). At pH 5, however, the affinity of  3a  towards G4&#8208;DNA  22AG  is higher (Kb  = 1.2x106  M&#8211;1), whereas the binding constant towards ct DNA is lower (Kb  =&#160;3.9x103  M&#8211;1) than under neutral conditions. Notably, the association of the ligand with DNA results in characteristic changes of the absorption and emission properties under specific conditions, which may be used for optical DNA detection. Other than the parent berberine, the ligands do not show a noticeable increase of their very low intrinsic emission intensity upon association with DNA at neutral conditions. In contrast, a fluorescence light&#8208;up effect was observed upon association to duplex (&#934;fl  =&#160;0.01) and quadruplex DNA (&#934;fl  =&#160;0.04) at pH 5. This fluorimetric response to G4&#8208;DNA association in combination with the distinct red&#8208;shifted absorption under these conditions provides a simple and conclusive optical detection of G4&#8208;DNA at lower pH.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Indium&#8208;catalyzed C&#8211;F Bond Transformation through Oxymetalation/&#946;&#8208;fluorine Elimination to Access Fluorinated Isocoumarins</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fluorinated heterocycles have attracted much attention in the pharmaceutical and agrochemical industries. Many strategies have already been developed to achieve the synthesis of fluorinated heterocycles. Formidable challenges remain, however, in the synthesis of fluorinated isocoumarin derivatives that are among the most alluring structural motifs. Herein, we report the indium&#8208;catalyzed C&#8211;F bond transformation of 2&#8208;(2,2&#8208;difluorovinyl) benzoates, which are readily accessible compounds, to give a diverse array of fluorinated isocoumarins. The present reaction proceeds smoothly using inexpensive reagents: catalytic amount of indium salt in the presence of zinc salt. A theoretical calculation of potential energy profiles showed that the reaction consists of oxymetalation with the elimination of alkyl halide and the &#946;&#8208;fluorine elimination.</dc:description>

         <title>Deconvolving Contributions to Decoherence in Molecular Electron&#160;Spin Qubits: A Dynamic Ligand Field Approach</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In the past decade, transition metal complexes have gained momentum as electron spin&#8208;based quantum bit (qubit) candidates due to their synthetic tunability and long achievable coherence times. The decoherence of magnetic quantum states imposes a limit on the use of these qubits for quantum information technologies, such as quantum computing, sensing, and communication. With rapid recent development in the field of molecular quantum information science, a variety of chemical design principles for prolonging coherence in molecular transition metal qubits have been proposed. Here we delineate the spin&#8208;spin, motional, and spin&#8208;phonon regimes of decoherence, outlining design principles for each. We show how dynamic ligand field models can provide insights into the intramolecular vibrational contributions in the spin&#8208;phonon decoherence regime. This minireview aims to inform the development of molecular quantum technologies tailored for different environments and conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Supramolecular Alloys From Fluorinated Hybrid Tri4Di6 Imine Cages</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>To create innovative materials, efficient control and engineering of pore sizes and their characteristics, crystallinity and stability is required. Eight hybrid Tri  4  Di  6  imine cages with a tuneable degree of fluorination and one fully fluorinated Tri  4  Di  6  imine cage are investigated. Although the fluorinated and the non&#8208;fluorinated building blocks used herein differ vastly in reactivity, we are able to gain control over the outcome of the self&#8208;assembly process, by carefully controlling the feed ratio. This represents the first hybrid material based on fluorinated/hydrogenated porous organic cages (POCs). These cages with unlimited miscibility in the solid state were obtained as highly crystalline samples after recrystallization and even showed retention of the crystal lattice, forming alloys. All mixtures and the fully fluorinated Tri  4  Di  6  imine cage were analysed by MALDI&#8208;MS, SCXRD, PXRD and in regards to thermal stability (TGA).</dc:description>

         <title>Elucidating the dual mode of action of dipeptidyl enoates in the inhibition of rhodesain cysteine proteases</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this paper a computational study of the two possible inhibition mechanisms of rhodesain cysteine protease by the dipeptidyl enoate Cbz&#8208;Phe&#8208;Leu&#8208;CH=CH&#8208;CO  2  C  2  H  5&#160;  has been carried out by means of molecular dynamics simulations with hybrid QM/MM potentials. The low free energy barriers confirm that the Cys25 residue can attack both C  &#946;  &#160;and C1 atoms of the inhibitor, confirming a dual mode of action in the inhibition of the rhodesain by enoates. According to the results, the inhibition process through the Cys25 attack on the C  &#946;  &#160;atom of the inhibitor is an exergonic and irreversible process, while the inhibition process when Cys25 attacks on the C1 atom of the inhibitor is and exergonic but reversible process. The interactions between the inhibitor and rhodesain suggest that P2 is the most important fragment to consider in the design of new efficient inhibitors of rhodesain. These results may be useful for the design of new inhibitors of rhodesain and other related cysteine proteases based on dipeptidyl enoates scaffolds.</dc:description>

         <title>Porous organic phenanthroline&#8208;based polymer as an efficient transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free heterogeneous catalyst for direct aromatic C&#8208;H activation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Direct C&#8208;H bond transformation has been regarded as one of the most important areas in organic synthesis in both academic and industry. However, the heterogeneous transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free catalysis of direct C&#8208;H bond transformation has been a contemporary challenge for a long time. To tackle this challenge, in this work we designed and constructed porous phenanthroline&#8208;based polymer (namely POP&#8208;Phen) via a free radical polymerization of vinyl&#8208;functionalized phenanthroline monomers. This POP&#8208;Phen shows excellent catalytic performances in transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free catalyzed C&#8208;H arylation, even better than those of the corresponding homogeneous catalyst, which is mainly attributed to the high density of catalytically active sites in the heterogeneous catalyst. Kinetic isotope experiments and spectral characterizations demonstrate the electron&#8208;transfer between the heterogeneous catalyst and the base (t&#8208;BuOK), a key step for C&#8208;H activation. We believe that this porous organic phenanthroline polymer would open a new door for design of novel heterogeneous transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free catalysts in the direct C&#8208;H activation.</dc:description>

         <title>Bis(pertrifluoromethylcatecholato)silane: Extreme Lewis Acidity Broadens the Catalytic Portfolio of Silicon</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Given its earth abundance, silicon is ideal for constructing Lewis acids of use in catalysis or materials science. Neutral silanes were limited to moderate Lewis acidity, until halogenated catecholato ligands provoked a significant boost. However, catalytic applications of bis(perhalocatecholato)silanes were suffering from very poor solubility and unknown deactivation pathways. Herewith, the novel per(trifluoromethyl)catechol, H2cat  CF3  , and adducts of its silicon complex Si(catCF3  )2  (1) are described. According to the computed fluoride ion affinity, 1 ranks among the strongest neutral Lewis acids currently accessible in the condensed phase. The improved robustness and affinity of 1 enable deoxygenations of aldehydes, ketones, amides, or phosphine oxides, and a carbonyl&#8208;olefin metathesis. All those transformations have never been catalyzed by a neutral silane. Attempts to obtain donor&#8208;free 1 attest to the extreme Lewis acidity by stabilizing adducts with even the weakest donors, such as benzophenone or hexaethyl disiloxane.</dc:description>

         <title>Multivalent Tryptophan&#8208; and Tyrosine&#8208;Containing [60]Fullerene Hexa&#8208;Adducts as Dual HIV and Enterovirus A71 Entry Inhibitors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Unprecedented 3D hexa&#8208;adducts of [60]fullerene peripherally decorated with twelve tryptophan (Trp) or tyrosine (Tyr) residues have been synthesized. Studies on the antiviral activity of these novel compounds against HIV and EV71 reveal that they are much more potent against HIV and equally active against EV71 than the previously described dendrimer prototypes AL&#8208;385 and AL&#8208;463 , which possess the same number of Trp/Tyr residues on the periphery but attached to a smaller and more flexible pentaerythritol core. These results demonstrate the relevance of the globular 3D presentation of the peripheral groups (Trp/Tyr) as well as the length of the spacer connecting them to the central core to interact with the viral envelopes, particularly in the case of HIV, and support the hypothesis that [60]fullerene can be an alternative and attractive biocompatible carbon&#8208;based scaffold for this type of highly symmetrical dendrimers. In addition, the functionalized fullerenes here described, which display twelve peripheral negatively charged indole moieties on their globular surface, define a new and versatile class of compounds with a promising potential in biomedical applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Solid&#8208;State Near&#8208;Infrared Circularly Polarized Luminescence from Chiral YbIII&#8208;Single&#8208;Molecule Magnet</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A redox&#8208;active chiral near&#8208;infrared circularly polarized luminescent field&#8208;induced single&#8208;molecule magnet of YbIII at the solid&#8208;state was designed from the bridging of two Yb(facam)3 units with the bis(1,10&#8208;phenantro[5,6b])tetrathiafulvalene triad.







Abstract
A field&#8208;induced chiral YbIII Single&#8208;Molecule Magnet (SMM) displayed an unprecedented near&#8208;infrared circularly polarized luminescence (NIR&#8208;CPL) in the solid&#8208;state. The bridging bis(1,10&#8208;phenantro[5,6b])tetrathiafulvalene triad (L) allowed an efficient sensitization of the NIR 2F5/2&#8594;2F7/2 emission while the NIR&#8208;CPL is associated to the f&#8208;f transitions of the YbIII ion bearing chiral &#946;&#8208;diketonate derived&#8208;camphorate ancillary ligands.

         <title>Synthesis of Uniform Gold Nanorods with Large Width to Realize Ultralow SERS Detection</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;quality gold nanorods (Au NRs) with width ranging from 6.5&#8197;nm to 175&#8197;nm were successfully synthesized by introducing heptanol molecules during cetyltrimethylammonium bromide&#8208;templated, seeded growth method. The array of vertically aligned Au NRs as SERS substrates can achieve the ultralow limit of detection (LOD) (10&#8722;16&#8197;M for CV probes) with good reliability and reproducibility. Thanks to their LOD, they can be used for rapid detection and identification of residual harmful substances with an ultralow concentration.







Abstract
In this work, we successfully demonstrate high&#8208;yield synthesis of high&#8208;quality gold nanorods (Au NRs) with width ranging from 6.5&#8197;nm to 175&#8197;nm by introducing heptanol molecules as secondary templating agents during cetyltrimethylammonium bromide&#8208;templated, seeded growth method. The results show that an appropriate concentration of heptanol molecules not only alter the micellization behavior of CTAB in water, but also help silver ions impact the symmetry&#8208;breaking efficiency of additional Au&#8722;NP seeds in addition to enhancing the utilization of gold precursors. Moreover, the generality and versatility of the present strategy for synthesis of Au NRs with flexible controlled dimensions are further demonstrated by successful synthesis of Au NRs with the assistance of other fatty alcohols with properly long alkyl chains. Furthermore, when arrays of vertically aligned Au NRs with large width (AVA&#8722;Au120&#215;90 NRs) are used as SERS substrates, they can achieve the ultralow limit of detection for crystal violet (10&#8722;16&#8197;M) with good reliability and reproducibility, and the rapid detection and identification of residual harmful substances.

         <title>G4 Sensing Pyridyl&#8208;thiazole Polyamide Represses c&#8208;KIT Expression in Leukemia Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Specific sensing and functional tuning of nucleic acid secondary structures remain less explored till date. Herein, we report a thiazole polyamide  TPW  that binds specifically to  c&#8208;KIT1  G&#8208;quadruplex (G4) with sub&#8208;micromolar affinity and ~ 1:1 stoichiometry and represses  c&#8208;KIT  proto&#8208;oncogene expression.  TPW  shows up to 10 fold increase in fluorescence upon binding with  c&#8208;KIT1  G4, but shows weak or no quantifiable binding to other G4s and  ds26 DNA  .  TPW  can increase the number of G4&#8208;specific antibody (BG4) foci and mark G4 structures in cancer cells. Cell&#8208;based assays reveal that  TPW  can efficiently repress  c&#8208;KIT  expression in leukemia cells via a G4&#8208;dependent process. Thus, the polyamide can serve as a promising probe for G&#8208;quadruplex recognition with the ability to specifically alter  c&#8208;KIT  oncogene expression.</dc:description>

         <title>Structural Effects of Incorporation of 2'&#8208;Deoxy&#8208;2'2'&#8208;Difluorodeoxycytidine (Gemcitabine) in A&#8208; and B&#8208;Form Duplexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
2'&#8208;Deoxy&#8208;2',2'&#8208;difluorocytidine (gemcitabine) is an adaptable nucleotide derivative that can adopt a North type sugar conformation when inserted in pure DNA (B&#8208;form helix), or a South sugar conformation in the context of DNA&#8201;:&#8201;RNA hybrids (A&#8208;form helix).







Abstract
We report the structural effect of 2'&#8208;deoxy&#8208;2',2'&#8208;difluorocytidine (dFdC) insertions in the DNA strand of a DNA&#8201;:&#8201;RNA hybrid duplex and in a self&#8208;complementary DNA&#8201;:&#8201;DNA duplex. In both cases, the modification slightly destabilizes the duplex and provokes minor local distortions that are more pronounced in the case of the DNA&#8201;:&#8201;RNA hybrid. Analysis of the solution structures determined by NMR methods show that dFdC is an adaptable derivative that adopts North type sugar conformation when inserted in pure DNA, or a South sugar conformation in the context of DNA&#8201;:&#8201;RNA hybrids.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2'&#8208;Deoxy&#8208;2',2'&#8208;difluorocytidine&lt;/b&gt; (gemcitabine) is an adaptable nucleotide derivative that can adopt a North type sugar conformation when inserted in pure DNA (B&#8208;form helix), or a South sugar conformation in the context of DNA&#8201;:&#8201;RNA hybrids (A&#8208;form helix).

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We report the structural effect of 2'&#8208;deoxy&#8208;2',2'&#8208;difluorocytidine (dFdC) insertions in the DNA strand of a DNA&#8201;:&#8201;RNA hybrid duplex and in a self&#8208;complementary DNA&#8201;:&#8201;DNA duplex. In both cases, the modification slightly destabilizes the duplex and provokes minor local distortions that are more pronounced in the case of the DNA&#8201;:&#8201;RNA hybrid. Analysis of the solution structures determined by NMR methods show that dFdC is an adaptable derivative that adopts North type sugar conformation when inserted in pure DNA, or a South sugar conformation in the context of DNA&#8201;:&#8201;RNA hybrids. In this latter context, South sugar pucker favors the formation of a 2'F&#8901;&#8901;H8 attractive interaction with a neighboring purine, which compensates the destabilizing effect of base pair distortions.

         <title>Ni&#8208;Catalyzed Borylation of Aryl Sulfoxides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A nickel/N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) catalytic system has been developed for the borylation of aryl sulfoxides with B2(neop)2 (neop = neopentyl glycolato). A wide range of aryl sulfoxides with different electronic and steric properties were converted into the corresponding arylboronic esters in good yields. The regioselective borylation of unsymmetric diaryl sulfoxides was also feasible leading to borylation of the sterically less encumbered aryl substituent. Competition experiments demonstrated that an electron&#8208;deficient aryl moiety reacts preferentially. The origin of the selectivity in the Ni&#8208;catalyzed borylation of electronically biased unsymmetrical diaryl sulfoxide lies in the oxidative addition step of the catalytic cycle, as oxidative addition of methoxyphenyl 4&#8208;(trifluoromethyl)phenyl sulfoxide to the Ni(0) complex occurs selectively to give the structurally characterized complex trans&#8208;[Ni(ICy)2(4&#8208;CF3&#8208;C6H4){(SO)&#8208;4&#8208;MeO&#8208;C6H4}] 4. For complex 5, the isomer trans&#8208;[Ni(ICy)2(C6H5)(OSC6H5)] 5&#8208;I was structurally characterized in which the phenyl sulfinyl ligand is bound via the oxygen atom to nickel. In solution, the complex trans&#8208;[Ni(ICy)2(C6H5)(OSC6H5)] 5&#8208;I is in equilibrium with the S&#8208;bonded isomer trans&#8208;[Ni(ICy)2(C6H5)(SOC6H5)] 5, as shown by NMR spectroscopy. DFT calculations reveal that these isomers are separated by a mere 0.3 kJ/mol (M06/def2&#8208;TZVP&#8208;level of theory) and connected via a transition state trans&#8208;[Ni(ICy)2(C6H5)(&#951;2&#8208;{SO}&#8208;C6H5)], which lies only 10.8 kcal/mol above 5.</dc:description>

Chemistry of New Ambident Ligands</title>

         <dc:description>We present highly regioselective syntheses of 1,2&#8208;dicarboxylated cyclopentadienide salts [Cat]  2  [C  5  H  3  (CO  2  )  2  H] by reaction of a variety of organic cation methylcarbonate salts [Cat]OCO  2  Me (Cat = NR  4  +  , PR  4  +  , Im  +  ) with cyclopentadiene (CpH) or by simply reacting organic cation cyclopentadienides Cat[Cp] (Cat = NR  4  +  , PR  4  +  , Im  +  ) with CO  2  . One characteristic feature of these dianionic ligands is the acidic proton delocalized in an intramolecular hydrogen bridge (IHB) between the two carboxyl groups, as studied by  1  H&#8208;NMR spectroscopy and XRD analyses. The reaction cannot be stopped after the first carboxylation. Therefore, we propose a Kolbe&#8208;Schmitt phenol&#8208;carboxylation related mechanism where the acidic proton of the monocarboxylic acid intermediate plays an  ortho&#8208;  directing and CO  2  activating role for the second kinetically accelerated CO  2  addition step exclusively in  ortho  position. The same and related thiocarboxylates [Cat]  2  [C  5  H  3  (COS)  2  H] are obtained by reaction of COS with Cat[Cp] (Cat = NR  4  +  , PR  4  +  , Im  +  ). A preliminary study on [Cat]  2  [C  5  H  3  (CO  2  )  2  H] reveals, that its soft and hard coordination sites can selectively be addressed by soft Lewis acids (Mo  0  , Ru  2+  ) and hard Lewis acids (Al  3+  , La  3+  ).</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A copper&#8208;catalyzed regio&#8208; and anti&#8208;selective addition of silylboronates to unsymmetric internal alkynes has been developed for the synthesis of structurally defined tetrasubstituted alkenes. A variety of unactivated alkynes can be employed with high selectivity under simple and mild conditions and the resulting products have been further functionalized by utilizing silyl and boryl groups on the alkene.

         <title>Accelerating H2 Evolution by Anodic Semi&#8208;dehydrogenation of Tetrahydroisoquinolines in Water over Co3O4 Nanoribbon Arrays Decorated Nickel Foam</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Semi&#8208;dehydrogenation conversion based on a cobalt electrocatalyst was employed to accelerate hydrogen evolution in water. The Co3O4 nanoribbon arrays modified nickel foam anode provided rich active sites for the transformation of tetrahydroisoquinolines into various value&#8208;added dihydroisoquinolines. Electro&#8208;activated higher&#8208;valent cobalt and plenty of surface oxygen species were responsible for promoting the electrocatalytic oxidation.







Abstract
Coupling the H2 evolution reaction in water with thermodynamically favorable organic oxidation reactions is highly desirable, because it can enhance the energy conversion efficiency compared with electrocatalytic water splitting, and produce value&#8208;added chemicals instead of O2 in the anodic reaction. Herein, Co3O4 nanoribbon arrays in&#8197;situ grown on nickel foam (Co3O4@NF) was employed as an effective electrocatalyst for the selective oxidation of tetrahydroisoquinolines (THIQs). Various value&#8208;added semi&#8208;dehydrogenation products including dihydroisoquinolines with electro&#8208;deficient or &#8208;rich groups could be obtained with moderate yields and faradaic efficiencies. Benefitting from the rich surface active sites of Co3O4@NF, a two&#8208;electrode (Co3O4@NF||Pt) electrolytic system drove a benchmark current density of 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at a cell voltage as low as 1.446&#8197;V in 1.0&#8197;M KOH aqueous solution containing 0.02&#8197;M THIQ, which was reduced by 174&#8197;mV in comparison with that of overall water splitting.

     alt="Accelerating H2 Evolution by Anodic Semi&#8208;dehydrogenation of Tetrahydroisoquinolines in Water over Co3O4 Nanoribbon Arrays Decorated Nickel Foam"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Semi&#8208;dehydrogenation conversion based on a cobalt electrocatalyst&lt;/b&gt; was employed to accelerate hydrogen evolution in water. The Co&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; nanoribbon arrays modified nickel foam anode provided rich active sites for the transformation of tetrahydroisoquinolines into various value&#8208;added dihydroisoquinolines. Electro&#8208;activated higher&#8208;valent cobalt and plenty of surface oxygen species were responsible for promoting the electrocatalytic oxidation.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coupling the H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; evolution reaction in water with thermodynamically favorable organic oxidation reactions is highly desirable, because it can enhance the energy conversion efficiency compared with electrocatalytic water splitting, and produce value&#8208;added chemicals instead of O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in the anodic reaction. Herein, Co&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; nanoribbon arrays in&#8197;situ grown on nickel foam (Co&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;@NF) was employed as an effective electrocatalyst for the selective oxidation of tetrahydroisoquinolines (THIQs). Various value&#8208;added semi&#8208;dehydrogenation products including dihydroisoquinolines with electro&#8208;deficient or &#8208;rich groups could be obtained with moderate yields and faradaic efficiencies. Benefitting from the rich surface active sites of Co&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;@NF, a two&#8208;electrode (Co&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;@NF||Pt) electrolytic system drove a benchmark current density of 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; at a cell voltage as low as 1.446&#8197;V in 1.0&#8197;M KOH aqueous solution containing 0.02&#8197;M THIQ, which was reduced by 174&#8197;mV in comparison with that of overall water splitting.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Synthesis, Structure, and Chiroptical Properties of Indolo&#8208; and Pyridopyrrolo&#8208;Carbazole&#8208;Based C2&#8208;Symmetric Azahelicenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Azahelicenes bearing an indolocarbazole backbone were prepared by a step&#8208;economic double dehydrogenative cyclization under palladium catalysis. Their optical resolutions were attained by chiral HPLC. The pyridopyrrolo derivative (X=N, R=H) was found to show ca. 6 times larger dissymmetry factors than those of the parent azahelicene (X=CH, R=H) in both CD and CPL measurements. The CPL color could be switched by addition of an acid or introduction of a donor substituent R.







Abstract
Treatment of 11,12&#8208;bis(1,1&#8217;&#8208;biphenyl&#8208;3&#8208;yl or 6&#8208;phenylpyridin&#8208;2&#8208;yl)&#8208;substituted 11,12&#8208;dihydro&#8208;indolo[2,3&#8208;a]carbazole with an oxidizing system of Pd(II)/Ag(I) induced effective double dehydrogenative cyclization to afford the corresponding &#960;&#8208;extended azahelicenes. The optical resolutions were readily achieved by a preparative chiral HPLC. It was found that the pyridopyrrolo&#8208;carbazole&#8208;based azahelicene that contains four nitrogen atoms exhibits ca. 6 times larger dissymmetry factors both in circularly dichroism (CD) and circularly polarized luminescence (CPL), |gCD| and |gCPL| values being 1.1&#215;10&#8722;2 and 4.4&#215;10&#8722;3, respectively, as compared with the parent indolocarbazole&#8208;based azahelicene. Theoretical calculations at the RI&#8208;CC2 level were employed to rationalize the observed enhanced chiroptical responses. The (chir)optical properties of the former helicene was further tuned by a protonation leading to remarkable red&#8208;shift with a considerable enhancement of the |gCPL| value.

         <title>Iridoid Sex Pheromone Biosynthesis in Aphids Mimics Iridoid&#8208;Producing Plants</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Natural product biosynthesis in animals: Chemical synthesis of isotopically&#8208;labelled molecular probes and topical application using female pea aphids, Acyrthosiphon pisum, are deployed along with coupled GC&#8208;mass spectrometry (GC&#8208;MS) to show that biosynthesis of the female&#8208;produced aphid sex pheromone components (1R,4aS,7S,7aR)&#8208;nepetalactol (1) and (4aS,7S,7aR)&#8208;nepetalactone (2) may follow a broadly similar route to that characterized for plants.







Abstract
Biosynthesis of (1R,4aS,7S,7aR)&#8208;nepetalactol (1) and (4aS,7S,7aR)&#8208;nepetalactone (2) in plants involves iridoid synthase (ISY), an atypical reductive cyclase that catalyses the reduction of 8&#8208;oxogeranial into the reactive enol of (S)&#8208;8&#8208;oxocitronellal, and cyclization of this enol intermediate, either non&#8208;enzymatically or by a nepetalactol&#8208;related short chain dehydrogenase enzyme (NEPS) that yields the nepetalactols. In this study, we investigated the biosynthesis in&#8197;vivo of 1 and 2 in the pea aphid, Acyrthosiphon pisum, using a library of isotopically&#8208;labelled monoterpenoids as molecular probes. Topical application of deuterium&#8208;labelled probes synthesized from geraniol and nerol resulted in production of 2H4&#8722;lactol 1 and 2H4&#8722;lactone 2. However, deuterium incorporation was not evident using labelled probes synthesized from (S)&#8208;citronellol. These results suggest that iridoid biosynthesis in animals, specifically aphids, may follow a broadly similar route to that characterised for plants.

         <title>Synthesis of Lignans based on a Borate&#8208;mediated One&#8208;pot Sequential Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura Coupling of Cyclic Boranes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lignans are a group of polyphenolic phytochemicals that possess a large spectrum of chemical structures and biological activities. Here the syntheses of lignans&#8212;anwulignan, burseran, dehydroxycubebin ruburisandrin B, and sesamin are achieved based on a borate&#8208;mediated one&#8208;pot sequential Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura coupling of  cis  &#8208; and  trans  &#8208;fused bicyclic boranes. The  cis  &#8208; and  trans  &#8208;bicyclic boranes were prepared by diastereoselective cyclic hydroboration of exo&#8208;cyclic diene with cyclopentyl&#8208; and thexylboranes, respectively. A one&#8208;pot sequential Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura coupling of each cyclic borate with various aryl bromides initiated by activation of the cyclic borane with the carbon nucleophile provided 2,3&#8208;dibenzylbutane derivatives with varied aromatic substituents. Finally, the syntheses of naturally occurring lignans were accomplished in several steps from the products of Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura coupling.</dc:description>

         <title>Click Chemistry in Ultra&#8208;high Vacuum &#8208; Tetrazine Coupling with Methyl Enol Ether Covalently Linked to Si(001)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The additive&#8208;free tetrazine/enol ether click reaction was performed in ultra&#8208;high vacuum (UHV) with an enol ether group covalently linked to a silicon surface: Dimethyl 1,2,4,5&#8208;tetrazine&#8208;3,6&#8208;dicarboxylate molecules were coupled to the enol ether group of a functionalized cyclooctyne which was adsorbed on the silicon (001) surface via the strained triple bond of cyclooctyne. The reaction was observed at a substrate temperature of 380 K by means of X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). A moderate energy barrier was deduced for this click reaction in vacuum by means of density functional theory based calculations, in good agreement with the experimental results. This UHV&#8208;compatible click reaction thus opens a new, flexible route for synthesizing covalently bound organic architectures.</dc:description>

         <title>Aryne Multicomponent Reactions by Directed C&#8208;H Activation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Arylation via ortho C&#8208;H activation by the aid of directing groups is explored recently by many researchers. Herein, we have developed a palladium&#8208;catalyzed C&#8208;H arylation using 8&#8208;aminoquinoline as a bidentate directing group. We have overserved that the reaction furnishes only C&#8208;H arylation unlike previous methods where cyclization to corresponding isoquinolones is observed. More interestingly, we have observed sequential C&#8208;H functionalization when methylacrylate and acrylonitrile was added which underwent C&#8208;H olefination with the aryl group which was installed from aryne precursor.</dc:description>

         <title>Synergistic Effect of NiLDH@YZ Hybrid and Mechanochemical Agitation on Glaser Homocoupling Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we report the synthesis of nickel&#8208;layered double hydroxide amalgamated to Y&#8208;zeolite (NiLDH@YZ) hybrids and evaluation of the synergistic effect of various NiLDH@YZ catalysts and mechanochemical agitation on Glaser homocoupling reactions. Nitrogen adsorption&#8208;desorption experiments were carried out to estimate the surface area and porosity of NiLDH@YZ hybrids. The basicity and acidity of these hybrids were determined by CO  2  &#8208;TPD and NH  3  &#8208;TPD experiments respectively and this portrayed good acid&#8208;base bifunctional feature of the catalysts. The NiLDH@YZ catalyzed mechanochemical Glaser coupling reaction achieved best yield of 83% for 0.5NiLDH@0.5YZ hybrid after 60 mins of agitation, which revealed the highest acid&#8208;base bifunctional feature compared to all the investigated catalysts. The developed catalyst has proven itself as a robust and effective candidate that can be successfully employed up to four catalytic cycles without significant loss in catalytic activity, under optimized reaction conditions. This work demonstrated a new strategy for C&#8211;C bond formation enabled by the synergy between mechanochemistry and heterogeneous catalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>A Stable Homoleptic Divinyl Tetrelene Series</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthesis of the new bulky vinyllithium reagent&#160;(MeIPr=CH)Li, (MeIPr = [(MeCNDipp)2C]; Dipp = 2,6&#8208;  iPr2C6H3  ) is&#160;reported. This vinyllithium precursor was found to act as a general&#160;source of the anionic 2&#963;, 2&#960;&#8208;electron donor ligand [MeIPr=CH]&#8722;  .&#160;Furthermore a high&#8208;yielding route to the degradation&#8208;resistant SiII  &#160;precursor  MePr&#8226;SiBr2  is presented. The efficacy of (MeIPr=CH)Li in&#160;synthesis was demonstrated by the generation of a complete&#160;inorganic divinyltetrelene series (MeIPrCH)  2  E: (E = Si to Pb).&#160;(MeIPrCH)2Si: represents the first two&#8208;coordinate acyclic silylene not bound by heteroatom donors, with dual electrophilic and nucleophilic&#160;character at the Si  II  center noted.

         <title>Programmed Multiple C&#8211;H Bond Functionalization of the Privileged 4&#8208;hydroxyquinoline Template</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The introduction of substituents on bare heterocyclic scaffolds can selectively be achieved by directed C&#8211;H functionalization. However, such methods have only occasionally been used, in an iterative manner, to decorate various positions of a medicinal scaffold to build chemical libraries. We herein report the multiple, site selective, metal&#8208;catalyzed C&#8211;H functionalization of a "programmed" 4&#8208;hydroxyquinoline. This medicinally privileged template indeed possesses multiple reactive sites for diversity&#8208;oriented functionalization, of which four were targeted. The C&#8208;2 and C&#8208;8 decorations were directed by an  N  &#8208;oxide, before taking benefit of an  O  &#8208;carbamoyl protection at C&#8208;4 to perform a Fries rearrangement and install a carboxamide at C&#8208;3. This also released the carbonyl group of 4&#8208;quinolones, the ultimate directing group to functionalize position 5. Our study highlights the power of multiple C&#8211;H functionalization to generate diversity in a biologically relevant library, after showing its strong antimalarial potential.</dc:description>

         <title>Soluble Congeners of Prior Insoluble Shape&#8208;Persistent Imine Cages</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>One of the most applied reaction types to synthesize shape&#8208;persistent organic cage compounds is the imine condensation reaction and it is assumed that the formed cages are thermodynamically controlled products due to the reversibility of the imine condensation. However, most of the synthesized imine cages reported are formed as precipitate from the reaction mixture and therefore rather may be kinetically controlled products. There are even examples in literature, where resulting cages are not soluble at all in common organic solvents to characterize or study their formation by NMR spectroscopy in solution. Here, a triptycene triamine containing three solubilizing n&#8208;hexyloxy chains has been used to synthesize soluble congeners of prior insoluble cages. This allowed us to study the formation as well the reversibility of cage formation in solution by investigating exchange of building blocks between the cages and deuterated derivatives thereof.</dc:description>

         <title>Natural&#8208;like Spirocyclic &#916;&#945;,&#946;&#8208;Butenolides Obtained from Diazo Homophthalimides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>&#945;&#8208;Diazo homophotalimides were reacted with various propiolic acids on Rh  2  (esp)  2  catalysis. The resulting propiolate esters were transformed into novel, heterocyclic &#916;  &#945;,&#946;  &#8208;spirobutenolides in good to excellent product yields. The approach represents a fundamentally novel entry into natural&#8208;like &#916;  &#945;,&#946;  &#8208;spirobutenolides present in many biologically active natural products as well as fully synthetic compounds endowed with diverse biological activities. The &#916;  &#945;,&#946;  &#8208;spirobutenolides thus obtained were shown to inhibit thioredoxin reductase, a selenocysteine enzyme target for cancer. Moreover, for the best compound in the series (TrxR IC  50  1.49 &#177; 0.08 &#956;M), it was shown, using MALDI&#8208;TOF mass&#8208;spectrometry, that it selectively binds selenocysteine in the presence of a 10&#8208;fold excess of cysteine. This validates the new compound as a promising lead for anticancer therapy development.</dc:description>

         <title>Using the Interaction between Copper and Manganese to Stabilize Copper Single&#8208;atom for CO Oxidation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The interaction between Cu and Mn was utilized to immobilize Cu single&#8208;atom on MnO2  surface by redox&#8208;driven hydrolysis method. Comprehensive structure and properties characterization demonstrate that the existence of Cu&#8208;Mn interaction on the catalyst surface can effectively restrain the aggregation of Cu single atoms and improve CO oxidation activity. The interaction of forming Cu&#8208;O&#8208;Mn entity is beneficial for CO catalytic activity since the migration of reactive oxygen species and the coordination effect of active centers accelerate the reaction.

This work offers a reliable method for synthesizing Cu SACs and deepens the understanding of the interaction effect between transition metal single&#8208;atom and support that can improve the catalytic activity of CO oxidation.</dc:description>

         <title>Reactions on a 1,2&#8208;Dicarbonyl Moiety of a Fullerene Skeleton</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The chemical transformation of a 1,2&#8208;dicarbonyl moiety embedded in a cage&#8208;opened fullerene C60 derivative was examined to produce &#946;&#8208;oxo&#8208;phosphorus ylide, &#945;&#8208;methylene carbonyl, and acid anhydride compounds. The former two showed a significantly supressed encapsulation/escape dynamics of a water molecule as well as electrochemical properties largely different from the last one.







Abstract
A 1,2&#8208;dicarbonyl moiety on a cage&#8208;opened fullerene skeleton is one of suitable building blocks for the further derivatization. Herein, we discuss the chemical transformation of a 1,2&#8208;dicarbonyl compound into &#946;&#8208;oxo&#8208;phosphorus ylide, acid anhydride, and &#945;&#8208;methylene carbonyl derivatives. Despite possessing a sterically small methylene unit in the last one, the release of an encapsulated water molecule was significantly supressed whereas the &#946;&#8208;oxo&#8208;phosphorus ylide bearing three bulky p&#8208;tolyl groups on the P&#8208;atom enabled the faster insertion/release dynamics, implying the flexibility of the phosphonium substituent. The replacement of the carbonyl group with phosphorus ylide and methylene units largely varied electrochemical properties of the fullerene skeleton, likely arising from the anionic charge delocalized over the entire molecule and removal of an electron&#8208;withdrawable carbonyl group, respectively.

         <dc:description>
Multicomponent dynagels for heparin encapsulation: Dynamic covalently cross&#8208;linked dynamers with high mechanical strength, biocompatibility and self&#8208;healing behaviors have been used for biomedical applications.







Abstract
Double cross&#8208;linked dynamic hydrogels, dynagels, have been prepared through reversible imine bonds and supramolecular interactions, which showed good pH responsiveness, injectability, self&#8208;healing property and biocompatibility. With the further encapsulation of heparin, the obtained hydrogels exhibited good anti&#8208;bacterial activity and promotion effects for 3D cell culture.

         <title>On the Structural Assignments Underlying R.&#8197;B. Woodward's Most Personal Data That Led to the Woodward&#8211;Hoffmann Rules: Subramania Ranganathan's Key Role and Related Research by E.&#8197;J. Corey and A.&#8197;G. Hortmann</title>

In 1963 and early 1964, R. B. Woodward and his postdoctoral student Subramania Ranganathan discovered a route&#8208;ending glitch in the isoxazole route to vitamin B12. However, they simultaneously discovered two coupled pairs of stereospecific valence isomerizations that became Woodward's 5th mysterious reaction and led to the Woodward&#8211;Hoffmann rules. This Essay discusses the behind&#8208;the&#8208;scenes story of Ranganathan's research and confirms his structure determinations using quantum chemical calculations of 1H&#8197;NMR parameters.







Abstract
In the early 1960s, as part of R. B. Woodward's isoxazole route to vitamin B12, Subramania Ranganathan uncovered two coupled sets of stereospecific reactions, a thermal set and a photochemical set. These four reactions illustrated the alternating configurations that were the major data points that prompted the solution of the no&#8208;mechanism problem. Though Ranganathan's reactions played a major role, according to Woodward, in the development of the Woodward&#8211;Hoffmann rules, they were published only as part of the documentation of a lecture given by Woodward in 1966. The authors of this paper have uncovered Subramania Ranganathan's 1964 postdoctoral report and have used modern quantum chemical theory to predict the 1H&#8197;NMR spectra for Ranganathan's key compounds, providing support for the structure assignments made by Woodward and Ranganathan. A similar set of alternating, stereospecific reactions was observed by E.&#8197;J. Corey and Alfred Hortmann in their 1963 total synthesis of dihydrocostunolide. We also have applied the computational process used for Ranganathan's compounds to Hortmann's compounds, now also including the calculation of coupling constants, and find computational support for Corey and Hortmann's structure assignments.

The authors of this paper have uncovered Subramania Ranganathan's 1964 postdoctoral report and have used modern quantum chemical theory to predict the &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H&#8197;NMR spectra for Ranganathan's key compounds, providing support for the structure assignments made by Woodward and Ranganathan. A similar set of alternating, stereospecific reactions was observed by E.&#8197;J. Corey and Alfred Hortmann in their 1963 total synthesis of dihydrocostunolide. We also have applied the computational process used for Ranganathan's compounds to Hortmann's compounds, now also including the calculation of coupling constants, and find computational support for Corey and Hortmann's structure assignments.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Synthesis of Desepoxy&#8208;Tedanolide C</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The total synthesis of one isomer of the marine natural product tedanolide C was accomplished and provides evidence about the relative configuration of this member of the tedanolide family. The synthesis takes advantage of a variant of the Kiyooka aldol protocol for the stereoselective synthesis of the tertiary alcohol flanked by three additional oxygenated carbon atoms. The synthesis was particularly sensitive to the appropriate selection of protecting groups, which made constant protecting group switches necessary. The spectroscopic data of the synthesized isomer support a different configuration than the originally proposed one.







Abstract
The synthesis of desepoxy&#8208;tedanolide C was accomplished and provided experimental evidence on the configuration of tedanolide C. The reported chemical shifts and coupling constants point to a configuration different from the published structure and analogous to the structures of the other members of this family of natural products. The key step is a Kiyooka aldol protocol for the stereoselective synthesis of the tertiary alcohol flanked by three additional oxygenated carbon atoms. Furthermore, two additional aldol reactions and a Julia&#8211;Kocienski olefination were used to assemble the carbon framework.

         <title>Rhamnogalacturonan II: Chemical Synthesis of a Substructure Including &#945;&#8208;2,3&#8208;Linked Kdo**
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chemical synthesis of a Kdo&#8208;containing rhamnogalacturonan II pentasaccharide was achieved by a [4+1] post&#8208;glycosylation oxidation approach.







Abstract
The synthesis of a fully deprotected Kdo&#8208;containing rhamnogalacturonan II pentasaccharide is described. The strategy relies on the preparation of a suitably protected homogalacturonan tetrasaccharide backbone, through a post&#8208;glycosylation oxidation approach, and its stereoselective glycosylation with a Kdo fluoride donor.

         <title>Organic Nanoparticles with Persistent Luminescence for In Vivo Afterglow Imaging&#8208;Guided Photodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Afterglow organic nanoparticles (ONPs) with long lifetime and near&#8208;infrared (NIR) emission offered high signal&#8208;to&#8208;background ratio and good tissue penetration for afterglow imaging&#8208;guided photodynamic therapy (PDT) in vivo. Owing to strong afterglow fluorescence and abundant singlet oxygen generation from the ONPs upon NIR laser irradiation, they have shown effective suppression of tumor growth after imaging&#8208;guided PDT in mice with minimal damage to major organs.

New visible&#8208;light&#8208;excitable solvatochromic fluorescent label for light&#8208;up and colour&#8208;change sensing of DNA&#8208;protein interactions.







Abstract
The synthesis of 2&#8242;&#8208;deoxycytidine and its 5&#8242;&#8208;O&#8208;triphosphate bearing solvatochromic acetophenyl&#8208;thienyl&#8208;aniline fluorophore was developed using the Sonogashira cross&#8208;coupling reaction as the key step. The triphosphate was used for polymerase synthesis of labelled DNA. The labelled nucleotide or DNA exerted weak red fluorescence when excited at 405&#8197;nm, but a significant colour change (to yellow or green) and light&#8208;up (up to 20 times) was observed when the DNA probes interacted with proteins or lipids.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A flash chromatography column free and transition metal free cyanation of &#945; C&#8722;H sulfonylamide was developed to access valuable &#945;&#8208;amino cyanation products from a variety of fluorine masked sulfonylamides. Compared with Strecker reaction, this transformation offers a complementary strategy to efficiently construct &#945;&#8208;amino cyanides from direct &#945; C&#8722;H functionalization of sulfonylamindes. The reaction has a broad substrate scope and occurs under mild conditions. More importantly, the new two&#8208;electron allows for excellent &#945; site&#8208;selectivity.







Abstract
This report describes the site&#8208;selective &#945;&#8208;functionalization of sulfonylamide derivatives through the in&#8208;situ generation of imine intermediates. The N&#8722;F sulfonylamides, which could facilitate the elimination to generate imines, are coupled with TBACN to efficiently and mildly afford &#945;&#8208;amino cyanides. Comparing with Strecker reaction, this transformation offers a complementary strategy to efficiently construct &#945;&#8208;amino cyanides from direct &#945; C&#8722;H functionalization of sulfonylamindes. The reaction is also characterized by broad substrate scope and flash chromatography column free workup. More importantly, the new two&#8208;electron pathway to generate imines through manipulation of the leaving group allows us to achieve excellent &#945; site&#8208;selectivity.

         <title>Surprising Homolytic Gas Phase Co&#8722;C Bond Dissociation Energies of Organometallic Aryl&#8208;Cobinamides Reveal Notable Non&#8208;Bonded Intramolecular Interactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The crucial resistance of aryl&#8208;cobalamins, as antivitamins B12, against metabolic conversion into B12 cofactors has been traced to their presumed strong organometallic bond. The strength of the Co&#8722;C bond of aryl&#8208;cobinamides was examined here by ESI&#8208;MS threshold collision&#8208;induced dissociation (CID) experiments. Surprisingly, the Co&#8722;C
 bonds of these aryl&#8208;corrins were less strong than the Co&#8722;C
 bond in their methyl analogue, revealing the relevance of non&#8208;bonded interactions.







Abstract
Aryl&#8208;cobalamins are a new class of organometallic structural mimics of vitamin B12 designed as potential &#8216;antivitamins B12&#8217;. Here, the first cationic aryl&#8208;cobinamides are described, which were synthesized using the newly developed diaryl&#8208;iodonium method. The aryl&#8208;cobinamides were obtained as pairs of organometallic coordination isomers, the stereo&#8208;structure of which was unambiguously assigned based on homo&#8208; and heteronuclear NMR spectra. The availability of isomers with axial attachment of the aryl group, either at the &#8216;beta&#8217; or at the &#8216;alpha&#8217; face of the cobalt&#8208;center allowed for an unprecedented comparison of the organometallic reactivity of such pairs. The homolytic gas&#8208;phase bond dissociation energies (BDEs) of the coordination&#8208;isomeric phenyl&#8208; and 4&#8208;ethylphenyl&#8208;cobinamides were determined by ESI&#8208;MS threshold CID experiments, furnishing (Co&#8722;C
)&#8208;BDEs of 38.4 and 40.6&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1, respectively, for the two &#946;&#8208;isomers, and the larger BDEs of 46.6 and 43.8&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1 for the corresponding &#945;&#8208;isomers. Surprisingly, the observed (Co&#8722;C
)&#8208;BDEs of the Co&#946;&#8208;aryl&#8208;cobinamides were smaller than the (Co&#8722;C
)&#8208;BDE of Co&#946;&#8208;methyl&#8208;cobinamide. DFT studies and the magnitudes of the experimental (Co&#8722;C
)&#8208;BDEs revealed relevant contributions of non&#8208;bonded interactions in aryl&#8208;cobinamides, notably steric strain between the aryl and the cobalt&#8208;corrin moieties and non&#8208;bonded interactions with and among the peripheral sidechains.

         <title>Mononuclear Dysprosium Alkoxide and Aryloxide Single&#8208;Molecule Magnets</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mononuclear lanthanide single&#8208;molecule magnets (SMMs) have progressively evolved in recent years. Lanthanide alkoxide and aryloxide chemistry offers a modular design approach to study the relaxation dynamics of high&#8208;performing SMMs. Alkoxide and aryloxide ligands on a single axis at a DyIII ion enhances the magnetic anisotropy and the barrier to magnetic reversal (Ueff). Leading examples of DyIII alkoxide and aryloxide SMMs are discussed in this review.







Abstract
Recent studies have shown that mononuclear lanthanide (Ln) complexes can be high&#8208;performing single&#8208;molecule magnets (SMMs). Recently, there has been an influx of mononuclear Ln alkoxide and aryloxide SMMs, which have provided the necessary geometrical control to improve SMM properties and to allow the intricate relaxation dynamics of Ln SMMs to be studied in detail. Here non&#8208;aqueous Ln alkoxide and aryloxide chemistry applied to the synthesis of low&#8208;coordinate mononuclear Ln SMMs are reviewed. The focus is on mononuclear DyIII alkoxide and aryloxide SMMs with coordination numbers up to eight, covering synthesis, solid&#8208;state structures and magnetic attributes. Brief overviews are also provided of mononuclear TbIII, HoIII, ErIII and YbIII alkoxide and aryloxide SMMs.

         <title>Synthesis of Glycodendrimers with Antiviral and Antibacterial Activity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sticky scaffolds: The state of the art in the design and synthesis of glycodendrimers for the development of anti&#8208;adhesion therapy against bacterial and viral infections is described.







Abstract
Glycodendrimers are an important class of synthetic macromolecules that can be used to mimic many structural and functional features of cell&#8208;surface glycoconjugates. Their carbohydrate moieties perform key important functions in bacterial and viral infections, often regulated by carbohydrate&#8211;protein interactions. Several studies have shown that the molecular structure, valency and spatial organisation of carbohydrate epitopes in glycoconjugates are key factors in the specificity and avidity of carbohydrate&#8211;protein interactions. Choosing the right glycodendrimers almost always helps to interfere with such interactions and blocks bacterial or viral adhesion and entry into host cells as an effective strategy to inhibit bacterial or viral infections. Herein, the state of the art in the design and synthesis of glycodendrimers employed for the development of anti&#8208;adhesion therapy against bacterial and viral infections is described.

         <title>Tunable Light&#8208;Emission Properties of Solution&#8208;Processable N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene Cyclometalated Gold(III) Complexes for Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>

         <dc:description>
Golden carbene emitter systems: N&#8208;Heterocyclic carbene (NHC) monocyclometalated gold(III) complexes that efficiently emit in the sky&#8208;blue to green part of the electromagnetic spectrum are reported. A first example of a solution&#8208;processable organic light&#8208;emitting device has been realized for this class of gold(III) complexes, revealing unique opportunities presented by these highly efficient gold(III) carbene emitter systems.







Abstract
N&#8208;Heterocyclic carbene (NHC) cyclometalated gold(III) complexes remain very scarce and therefore their photophysical properties remain currently underexplored. Moreover, gold(III) complexes emitting in the blue region of the electromagnetic spectrum are rare. In this work, a series of four phosphorescent gold(III) complexes was investigated bearing four different NHC monocyclometalated (C^C*)&#8208;type ligands and a dianionic (N^N)&#8208;type ancillary ligand ((N^N)=5,5&#8217;&#8208;(propane&#8208;2,2&#8208;diyl)bis(3&#8208;(trifluoromethyl)&#8208;1&#8201;H&#8208;pyrazole) (mepzH2)). The complexes exhibit strong phosphorescence when doped in poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) at room temperature, which were systematically tuned from sky&#8208;blue [&#955;PL=456&#8197;nm, CIE coordinates: (0.20, 034)] to green [&#955;PL=516&#8197;nm, CIE coordinates: (0.31, 0.54)] by varying the monocyclometalated (C^C*) ligand framework. The complexes revealed high quantum efficiencies (&#981;PL) of up to 43&#8201;% and excited&#8208;state lifetimes (&#964;0) between 15&#8211;266&#8197;&#956;s. The radiative rate constant values found for these complexes (kr=103&#8211;104&#8197;s&#8722;1) are the highest found in comparison to previously known best&#8208;performing monocyclometalated gold(III) complexes. Density functional theory (DFT) and time&#8208;dependent DFT (TD&#8208;DFT) calculations of these complexes further lend support to the excited&#8208;state nature of these complexes. The calculations showed a significant contribution of the gold(III) metal center in the lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals (LUMOs) of up to 18&#8201;%, which was found to be unique for this class of cyclometalated gold(III) complexes. Additionally, organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) were fabricated by using a solution process to provide the first insight into the electroluminescent (EL) properties of this new class of gold(III) complexes.

         <title>Co&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Intramolecular [3+2] Cycloaddition of Yne&#8208;Alkylidenecyclopropanes and its Reaction Mechanism</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first Co&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric intramolecular [3+2] reaction of yne&#8208;alkylidenecyclopropanes (yne&#8208;ACPs) using a commercially available ligand has been realized for the synthesis of 5/5 and 6/5 bicycles. This reaction avoids the use of precious Pd and Rh catalysts usually used for these reactions. Mechanistic studies suggest that the reaction takes places via oxidative cyclometallation of the alkyne and the ACP, ring opening of the cyclopropyl group, and reductive elimination.







Abstract
Developing new transition metal&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric cycloadditions for the synthesis of five&#8208;membered carbocycles (FMCs) is a research frontier in reaction development due to the ubiquitous presence of chiral FMCs in various functional molecules. Reported here is our discovery of a highly enantioselective intramolecular [3+2] cycloaddition of yne&#8208;alkylidenecyclopropanes (yne&#8208;ACPs) to bicyclo[3.3.0]octadiene and bicyclo[4.3.0]nonadiene molecules using a cheap Co catalyst and commercially available chiral ligand (S)&#8208;Xyl&#8208;BINAP. This reaction avoids the use of precious Pd and Rh catalysts, which are usually the choices for [3+2] reactions with ACPs. The enantiomeric excess in the present reaction can be up to 92&#8201;%. Cationic cobalt(I) species was suggested by experiments as the catalytic species. DFT calculations showed that this [3+2] reaction starts with oxidative cyclometallation of alkyne and ACP, followed by ring opening of the cyclopropyl (CP) group and reductive elimination to form the cycloadduct. This mechanism is different from previous [3+2] reactions of ACPs, which usually start from CP cleavage, not from oxidative cyclization.

N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) monocyclometalated gold(III) complexes: Highly efficient photoluminescence was achieved in the sky&#8208;blue to green part of the electromagnetic spectrum using strong s&#8208;donating cyclometalated NHC ligands and a dianionic (N&#8201;N)&#8208;type bidentate as the ancillary ligand. Detailed photophysical investigations supported by density functional theory calculations provide insights into the excited&#8208;state properties of this new class of emitter molecules. The realization of the first solution&#8208;processable OLED device based on these strongly luminescent gold(III) carbene emitter systems opens up exciting new opportunities in light emitting applications.

         <title>Temperature Dependence of 1H Paramagnetic Chemical Shifts in Actinide Complexes, Beyond Bleaney's Theory: The AnVIO22+&#8211;Dipicolinic Acid Complexes (An=Np, Pu) as an Example</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
NMR spectroscopy: The temperature dependence of paramagnetic 1H NMR chemical shifts are measured and modelled in the AnVIO22+&#8211;dipicolinic acid complexes. Only the pseudocontact term is non&#8208;zero. The magnetic susceptibility tensor, the energy states and magnetic moments of the paramagnetic center are deduced and compared to the SO&#8208;CASPT2 values.







Abstract
Actinide +VI complexes (
=
, 
 and 
) with dipicolinic acid derivatives were synthesized and characterized by powder XRD, SQUID magnetometry and NMR spectroscopy. In addition, 
 and 
 complexes were described by first principles CAS based and two&#8208;component spin&#8208;restricted DFT methods. The analysis of the 1H paramagnetic NMR chemical shifts for all protons of the ligands according to the X&#8208;rays structures shows that the Fermi contact contribution is negligible in agreement with spin density determined by unrestricted DFT. The magnetic susceptibility tensor is determined by combining SQUID, pNMR shifts and Evans&#8217; method. The SO&#8208;RASPT2 results fit well the experimental magnetic susceptibility and pNMR chemical shifts. The role of the counterions in the solid phase is pointed out; their presence impacts the magnetic properties of the 
 complex. The temperature dependence of the pNMR chemical shifts has a strong 
 contribution, contrarily to Bleaney's theory for lanthanide complexes. The fitting of the temperature dependence of the pNMR chemical shifts and SQUID magnetic susceptibility by a two&#8208;Kramers&#8208;doublet model for the 
 complex and a non&#8208;Kramers&#8208;doublet model for the 
 complex allows for the experimental evaluation of energy gaps and magnetic moments of the paramagnetic center.

 complex and a non&#8208;Kramers&#8208;doublet model for the 
 complex allows for the experimental evaluation of energy gaps and magnetic moments of the paramagnetic center.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Directed Assembly of Multi&#8208;Walled Nanotubes and Nanoribbons of Amino Acid Amphiphiles Using a Layer&#8208;by&#8208;Layer Approach</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multi&#8208;walled nanotubes and nanoribbons of amino acid amphiphiles are fabricated by using a layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer technique, where successive rigid amphiphile layers are glued together by oppositely charged polyelectrolyte. The resulting well&#8208;defined 1D structures are attractive as potential biocompatible delivery systems and building blocks in nanotechnology.







Abstract
Monodisperse unilamellar nanotubes (NTs) and nanoribbons (NRs) were transformed to multilamellar NRs and NTs in a well&#8208;defined fashion. This was done by using a step&#8208;wise approach in which self&#8208;assembled cationic amino acid amphiphile (AAA) formed the initial NTs or NRs, and added polyanion produced an intermediate coating. Successive addition of cationic AAA formed a covering AAA layer, and by repeating this layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer (LBL) procedure, multi&#8208;walled nanotubes (mwNTs) and nanoribbons were formed. This process was structurally investigated by combining small&#8208;angle neutron scattering (SANS) and cryogenic&#8208;transmission electron microscopy (cryo&#8208;TEM), confirming the multilamellar structure and the precise layer spacing. In this way the controlled formation of multi&#8208;walled suprastructures was demonstrated in a simple and reproducible fashion, which allowed to control the charge on the surface of these 1D aggregates. This pathway to 1D colloidal materials is interesting for applications in life science and creating well&#8208;defined building blocks in nanotechnology.

         <title>Additive&#8208;free Aqueous Dispersions of Two&#8208;Dimensional Materials with Glial Cell Compatibility and Enzymatic Degradability</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>

Bioelectronics: Processing of additive&#8208;free aqueous dispersions of 2D materials like transition metal dichalcogenides and hexagonal boron nitride is demonstrated, and biological implications like cell compatibility and enzymatic degradability are investigated.







Abstract
Water&#8208;dispersible two&#8208;dimensional (2D) materials are desirable for diverse applications. Aqueous dispersions make processing safer and greener and enable evaluation of these materials on biological and environmental fronts. To evaluate the effects of 2D materials with biological systems, obtaining dispersions without additives is critical and has been a challenge. Herein, a method was developed for obtaining additive&#8208;free aqueous dispersions of 2D materials like transition metal dichalcogenides and hexagonal boron nitride (h&#8208;BN). The nanosheet dispersions were investigated through spectroscopic and microscopic methods, along with the role of size on stability. The aqueous media enabled investigations on cytocompatibility and enzymatic degradation of molybdenum disulphide (MoS2) and h&#8208;BN. Cytocompatibility with mixed glial cells was observed up to concentrations of 100&#8197;&#956;g&#8201;mL&#8722;1, suggesting their plausible usage in bioelectronics. Besides, biodegradation using human myeloperoxidase (hMPO) mediated catalysis was investigated through Raman spectroscopy and electron microscopy. The findings suggested that additive&#8208;free 2H&#8208;MoS2 and h&#8208;BN were degradable by hMPO, with 2H&#8208;phase exhibiting better resistance to degradation than the 1T&#8208;phase, while h&#8208;BN exhibited slower degradation. The findings pave a path for incorporating 2D materials in the burgeoning field of transient bioelectronics.

         <title>Experimental and Theoretical Investigation of the Structural and Opto&#8208;electronic Properties of Fe&#8208;Doped Lead&#8208;Free Cs2AgBiCl6 Double Perovskite</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Doubling up: The synthesis and first&#8208;principles density functional theory (DFT) calculations of Fe&#8208;doped, lead&#8208;free dipyramidal shape Cs2AgBiCl6 crystals for photodetector applications are presented. The results of systematic investigation of the crystal structure, morphology, optical properties, band structure, and stability of these materials are discussed.







Abstract
Lead&#8208;free double perovskites have emerged as stable and non&#8208;toxic alternatives to Pb&#8208;halide perovskites. Herein, the synthesis of Fe&#8208;doped Cs2AgBiCl6 lead&#8208;free double perovskites are reported that display blue emission using an antisolvent method. The crystal structure, morphology, optical properties, band structure, and stability of the Fe&#8208;doped double perovskites were investigated systematically. Formation of the Fe&#8208;doped Cs2AgBiCl6 double perovskite is confirmed by X&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD) and X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis. XRD and thermo&#8208;gravimetric analysis (TGA) shows that the Cs2AgBiCl6 double perovskite has high structural and thermal stability, respectively. Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE&#8208;SEM) analysis revealed the formation of dipyramidal shape Cs2AgBiCl6 crystals. Furthermore, energy&#8208;dispersive X&#8208;ray spectroscopy (EDS) mapping shows the overlapping of Cs, Bi, Ag, Fe, and Cl elements and homogenous incorporation of Fe in Cs2AgBiCl6 double perovskite. The Fe&#8208;doped Cs2AgBiCl6 double perovskite shows a strong absorption at 380&#8197;nm. It extends up to 700&#8197;nm, suggesting that sub&#8208;band gap states transition may originate from the surface defect of the doped perovskite material. The radiative kinetics of the crystals was studied using the time&#8208;correlated single&#8208;photon counting (TCSPC) technique. Lattice parameters and band gap value of the Fe&#8208;doped Cs2AgBiCl6 double perovskites predicted by the density functional theory (DFT) calculations are confirmed by XRD and UV/Visible spectroscopy analysis. Time&#8208;dependent photo&#8208;response characteristics of the Fe&#8208;doped Cs2AgBiCl6 double perovskite show fast response and recovery time of charge carriers. We believe that the successful incorporation of Fe in lead&#8208;free, environmentally friendly Cs2AgBiCl6 double perovskite can open a new class of doped double perovskites with significant potential optoelectronics devices fabrication and photocatalytic applications.

         <title>One&#8208;Pot Dual C&#8722;C Coupling Reaction via Site Selective Cascade Formation by PdII&#8208;Cryptate of an Amino&#8208;Ether Heteroditopic Macrobicycle</title>

         <dc:description>
PdII catalysed site selective dual C&#8722;C Coupling in the presence of heteroditopic macrobicycle was achieved to synthesize symmetrical and unsymmetrical conjugated 1,3&#8208;diynes.







Abstract
Selectivity of aryl iodo over ethynyl iodo toward the Suzuki cross coupling reaction is explored by utilizing a palladium complex of amino&#8208;ether heteroditopic macrobicycle. Subsequently, unreacted ethynyl iodide undergoes homocoupling reaction in the same catalytic atmosphere, thereby representing a cascade dual C&#8722;C coupling reaction. Furthermore, this approach is extended for novel one&#8208;pot synthesis of unsymmetrical 1,3&#8208;diynes.

         <title>Rational Molecular Design of Multifunctional Blue&#8208;Emitting Materials Based on Phenanthroimidazole Derivatives.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Deeper blue: On the basis of multifunctional phenanthroimidazole&#8208;based material PTPBPTA, which acts both as a deep&#8208;blue fluorescent emitter and as a host material for phosphors, high&#8208;performance deep&#8208;blue fluorescent organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs), yellow and red phosphorescent OLEDs, and a white OLED were fabricated.







Abstract
High&#8208;performance deep&#8208;blue emitters with external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) exceeding 5&#8201;% are still scarce in organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs). In this work, by introducing a [1,2,4]triazolo[1,5&#8208;a] pyridine (TP) unit at the N1 position of phenanthroimidazole (PI), two luminescent materials, PTPTPA and PTPTPA, were obtained. Systematic photophysical analysis showed that the TP block is suitable for constructing hybridized local and charge&#8208;transfer (HLCT) emitters. Its moderate electron&#8208;withdrawing ability and rigid planar structure can enhance the CT component while ensuring color purity. In addition, compared with PTPTPA, the additional phenyl ring of PTPBPTA not only increased the oscillator strength, but also decreased the Stokes shift. TDDFT calculations pointed out facile reverse intersystem crossing processes in PTPTPA from high&#8208;lying triplet states to the singlet excited state. A nondoped device based on PTPTPA as emitter showed impressive performance with EQEmax of 7.11&#8201;% and CIE coordinates of (0.15, 0.09). At the same time, it was also an efficient host for yellow and red phosphorescent OLEDs. By doping yellow (PPYBA) and red (BTPG) phosphorescent dyes into PTPTPA, a white OLED with a high EQE of 23.85&#8201;% was achieved. The successful design of PTPTPA not only provided an optimization choice for OLED emitters, but also demonstrated the empirical rules for the design of multifunctional deep&#8208;blue emitters.

         <title>Synergistic Effect of Boron Nitride and Carbon Domains in Boron Carbide Nitride Nanotube Supported Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts for Efficient Nitrogen Fixation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single metal atoms supported on boron carbide nitride nanotubes are considered as promising electrocatalysts for N2 reduction to NH3 with high activity and selectivity. The outstanding performance is ascribed to the synergistic effect of boron nitride and carbon domains, which tuned the charge polarization of metal&#8208;atom active site and the electronic properties of material.







Abstract
Developing the low&#8208;cost and efficient single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) for nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) is of great importance while remains as a great challenge. The catalytic activity, selectivity and durability are all fundamentally related to the elaborate coordination environment of SACs. Using first&#8208;principles calculations, we investigated the SACs with single transition metal (TM) atom supported on defective boron carbide nitride nanotubes (BCNTs) as NRR electrocatalysts. Our results suggest that boron&#8208;vacancy defects on BCNTs can strongly immobilize TM atoms with large enough binding energy and high thermal/structural stability. Importantly, the synergistic effect of boron nitride (BN) and carbon domains comes up with the modifications of the charge polarization of single&#8208;TM&#8208;atom active site and the electronic properties of material, which has been proven to be the essential key to promote N2 adsorption, activation, and reduction. Specifically, six SACs (namely V, Mn, Fe, Mo, Ru, and W atoms embedded into defective BCNTs) can be used as promising candidates for NRR electrocatalysts as their NRR activity is higher than the state&#8208;of&#8208;the art Ru(0001) catalyst. In particular, single Mo atom supported on defective BCNTs with large tube diameter possesses the highest NRR activity while suppressing the competitive hydrogen evolution reaction, with a low limiting potential of &#8722;0.62&#8197;V via associative distal path. This work suggests new opportunities for driving NH3 production by carbon&#8208;based single&#8208;atom electrocatalysts under ambient conditions.

Fit in the groove: Hybrid DNAs with Watson&#8211;Crick and purine&#8211;purine base pairs decorated with dendritic side chains are prepared. Space&#8208;demanding side chains introduced into the 7&#8208;position of 5&#8208;aza&#8208;7&#8208;deazaguanine&#8211;isoguanine base pairs are well accommodated in the large groove of purine&#8211;purine DNA and have a positive impact on helix stability.







Abstract
The Watson&#8211;Crick coding system depends on the molecular recognition of complementary purine and pyrimidine bases. Now, the construction of hybrid DNAs with Watson&#8211;Crick and purine&#8211;purine base pairs decorated with dendritic side chains was performed. Oligonucleotides with single and multiple incorporations of 5&#8208;aza&#8208;7&#8208;deaza&#8208;2&#8242;&#8208;deoxyguanosine, its tripropargylamine derivative, and 2&#8242;&#8208;deoxyisoguanosine were synthesized. Duplex stability decreased if single modified purine&#8211;purine base pairs were inserted, but increased if pyrene residues were introduced by click chemistry. A growing number of consecutive 5&#8208;aza&#8208;7&#8208;deazaguanine&#8211;isoguanine base pairs led to strong stepwise duplex stabilization, a phenomenon not observed for the guanine&#8211;isoguanine base pair. Spacious residues are well accommodated in the large groove of purine&#8211;purine DNA tracts. Changes to the global helical structure monitored by circular dichroism spectroscopy show the impact of functionalization to the global double&#8208;helix structure. This study explores new areas of molecular recognition realized by purine base pairs that are complementary in hydrogen bonding, but not in size, relative to canonical pairs.

Gold (I)&#8208;catalyzed higher&#8208;order cycloaddition: 8&#8208;Aryl&#8208;8&#8208;azafulvenes undergo a regioselective gold catalyzed [8+2] cycloaddition with electron&#8208;rich allenamines and ynamides to give dihydrocyclohepta[b]pyrrole derivatives. The cyclization takes place after the nucleophilic attack of the heptafulvene to the electrophilic intermediates formed by the coordination of cationic gold to either allene or triple bond moieties of the unsaturated systems.







Abstract
Gold(I)&#8208;catalyzed higher&#8208;order [8+2] cycloadditions of 8&#8208;aryl&#8208;8&#8208;azaheptafulvenes 1 with allenamides 2 and ynamides 3 were studied. 1,8&#8208;Dihydrocycloheptapyrroles 4 were achieved by a regioselective [8+2] cycloaddition of azaheptafulvenes 1 and allenamides 2 in the presence of (2,4&#8208;ditBuC6H3O)3PAuNTf2 as catalyst. Besides, ynamides 3 and 8&#8208;aryl&#8208;8&#8208;azaheptafulvenes 1, undergo a regioselective [8+2] cycloaddition, to give 2&#8208;amido&#8208;1,4&#8208;dihydrocycloheptapyrroles 7 in the presence of JohnPhosAuNTf2 as catalyst. Both reactions take place with good yields and with a variety of substituents. A plausible mechanism hypothesis suggests a nucleophilic attack of the 8&#8208;azaheptafulvene to the gold activated electron rich allene or alkyne moieties of the allenamide and ynamide, respectively.

         <title>Rational Molecular Design of Multifunctional Blue&#8208;Emitting Materials Based on Phenanthroimidazole Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The material PTPBTPA is reported in this work, which is shown in blue in the cover picture. It can act as a high&#8208;efficiency deep blue emitter as well as an efficient host material for yellow (the color of the bull in the image) and red (the festive color, indicating the coming of the Spring Festival) phosphors. Combining the blue fluorescence and yellow or red phosphorescence produced high&#8208;performance WOLED, which emits white light as the color of the external circle. More information can be found in the Full Paper by Y. Liu, Q.&#8208;X. Tong, et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202005214).

         <title>A DNA&#8208;Encoded Chemical Library Based on Peptide Macrocycles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A DNA&#8208;encoded chemical library (DEL) based on canonical and non&#8208;canonical peptide macrocycles (YO&#8208;DEL) was generated. The single&#8208;stranded format allowed for selections by affinity capture, through a novel selection method exploiting the competition with an antibody fragment and the annealing to a photoreactive moiety which allowed for selections by a photocrosslinking approach. The YO&#8208;DEL yielded ligands against proteins of pharmaceutical interest such as CAIX, HSA and NKp46, a protein expressed on the surface of activated NK&#8208;cells.







Abstract
The synthesis and characterization of a novel DNA&#8208;encoded library of macrocyclic peptide derivatives are described; the macrocycles are based on three sets of proteinogenic and non&#8208;proteinogenic amino acid building blocks and featuring the use of copper(I)&#8208;catalyzed alkyne&#8208;azide cycloaddition (CuAAC) reaction for ring closure. The library (termed YO&#8208;DEL) which contains 1&#8201;254&#8201;838 compounds, was encoded with DNA in single&#8208;stranded format and was screened against target proteins of interest using affinity capture procedures and photocrosslinking. YO&#8208;DEL selections yielded specific binders against serum albumins, carbonic anhydrases and NKp46, a marker of activated Natural Killer cells.

         <title>A High&#8208;Performance Asymmetric Supercapacitor Based on Tungsten Oxide Nanoplates and Highly Reduced Graphene Oxide Electrodes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two dimensional nanomaterials: An asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC, HRG//m&#8208;WO3 ASC) fabricated from tungsten oxide (m&#8208;WO3) nanoplates as a negative electrode and highly reduced graphene oxide (HRG) as a positive electrode material attains specific capacitance of 389&#8197;F&#8201;g&#8722;1 at a current density of 0.5&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1, with an associated high energy density of 93&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 at a power density of 500&#8197;W&#8201;kg&#8722;1 in a wide 1.6&#8197;V operating potential window. In addition, the HRG//m&#8208;WO3 ASC displays long&#8208;term cycling&#8208;stability, maintaining around 92&#8201;% of the original specific capacitance after 5000 galvanostatic charge&#8211;discharge cycles.







Abstract
Tungsten oxide/graphene hybrid materials are attractive semiconductors for energy&#8208;related applications. Herein, we report an asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC, HRG//m&#8208;WO3 ASC), fabricated from monoclinic tungsten oxide (m&#8208;WO3) nanoplates as a negative electrode and highly reduced graphene oxide (HRG) as a positive electrode material. The supercapacitor performance of the prepared electrodes was evaluated in an aqueous electrolyte (1&#8201;m H2SO4) using three&#8208; and two&#8208;electrode systems. The HRG//m&#8208;WO3 ASC exhibits a maximum specific capacitance of 389&#8197;F&#8201;g&#8722;1 at a current density of 0.5&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1, with an associated high energy density of 93&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 at a power density of 500&#8197;W&#8201;kg&#8722;1 in a wide 1.6&#8197;V operating potential window. In addition, the HRG//m&#8208;WO3 ASC displays long&#8208;term cycling stability, maintaining 92&#8201;% of the original specific capacitance after 5000 galvanostatic charge&#8211;discharge cycles. The m&#8208;WO3 nanoplates were prepared hydrothermally while HRG was synthesized by a modified Hummers method.

         <title>Probing Multiconfigurational States by Spectroscopy: The Cerium XAS L3&#8208;edge Puzzle</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Ce L3 X&#8208;ray absorption spectra of CeO2 and Ce(C8H8)2 are calculated with relativistic multiconfigurational wavefunction approaches. Calculated spectra are in excellent agreement with experiments. The metal oxidation state in the ground vs. the core&#8208;excited states, and the experimental 4f electron count derived spectroscopically, are fully rationalized.







Abstract
The Ce L3 edge XAS spectra of CeO2 and cerocene [Ce(C8H8)2] were calculated with relativistic ab&#8208;initio multireference wavefunction approaches capable of reproducing the observed spectra accurately. The study aims to resolve the decades&#8208;long puzzle regarding the relationship between the number and relative intensities of the XAS peaks and the 4f electron occupation in the ground state (GS) versus the core&#8208;excited states (ESs). CeO2 and cerocene exemplify the different roles of covalent bonding and wavefunction configurational composition in the observed intensity patterns. Good agreement is found between the calculated GS 4f&#8208;shell occupations and the value derived from XAS measurements using peak areas (nf). The identity of the two&#8208;peaked Ce L3 edge is fully rationalized from the perspective of the relaxed wavefunctions for the GS and core ESs. The states underlying the different peaks differ from each other in a surprisingly simple way that can be associated with 4f1 vs. 4f0 sub&#8208;configurations. Furthermore, part of one of the cerocene spectral peaks is associated with 4f2 sub&#8208;configurations. The pattern therefore reveals excited states that can be interpreted in terms of Ce&#8201;IV and III oxidation numbers, as long assumed, with Ce&#8201;II states additionally appearing in the cerocene spectrum. While this work demonstrates the rough accuracy of the conventional approach to determining nf from Ce L3&#8208;edge XAS, limitations are highlighted in terms of the ultimate accuracy of this approach and the potential of observing new types of excited states. The need to determine the sources of nf by calculations, is stressed.

         <title>Fluorinated Rings: Conformation and Application</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fluorine&#8208;containing compounds are widely used in different applications owing to their unique properties and effects. A particularly interesting feature is the impact of the C&#8722;F bond on the conformational preference when incorporated with organic molecules. In this Review, the conformational behavior of fluorinated aliphatic carbo&#8208; and heterocyclic systems will be discussed through presentation of the most recent applications.







Abstract
The introduction of fluorine atoms into molecules and materials across many fields of academic and industrial research is now commonplace, owing to their unique properties. A particularly interesting feature is the impact of fluorine substitution on the relative orientation of a C&#8722;F bond when incorporated into organic molecules. In this Review, we will be discussing the conformational behavior of fluorinated aliphatic carbo&#8208; and heterocyclic systems. The conformational preference of each system is associated with various interactions introduced by fluorine substitution such as charge&#8208;dipole, dipole&#8208;dipole, and hyperconjugative interactions. The contribution of each interaction on the stabilization of the fluorinated alicyclic system, which manifests itself in low conformations, will be discussed in detail. The novelty of this feature will be demonstrated by presenting the most recent applications.

         <title>Designed Construction of SrTiO3/SrSO4/Pt Heterojunctions with Boosted Photocatalytic H2 Evolution Activity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel photocatalyst is designed with consideration of heterojunction band matching and porous structure. The SrTiO3/SrSO4 heterojunction using Pt as the co&#8208;catalyst reaches 396.82&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1, which is 16&#8197;times higher than that of SrTiO3/Pt. It is proposed that the presence of SrSO4 provides extra channels for electron transportation as well as promoting photocatalytic activity.







Abstract
Efficient separation of photogenerated electron&#8211;hole pairs is a crucial factor for high&#8208;performance photocatalysts. Effective electron&#8211;hole separation and migration could be achieved by heterojunctions with suitable band structures. Herein, a porous SrTiO3/SrSO4 heterojunction is prepared by a sol&#8208;gel method at room temperature followed by an annealing process. XRD characterization suggests high crystallinity of the heterostructure. A well&#8208;defined interface between the two phases is confirmed by high&#8208;resolution (HR)TEM. The photocatalytic H2 evolution productivity of the SrTiO3/SrSO4 heterojunction with Pt as co&#8208;catalyst reaches 396.82&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1, which is 16&#8197;times higher than that of SrTiO3/Pt. The boosted photocatalytic activity of SrTiO3/SrSO4/Pt can be ascribed to the presence of SrSO4, which promotes the transfer and migration of photogenerated carriers by forming the heterojunction and porous structure, which provides a large amount of active sites. This novel porous heterostructure brings new ideas for the development of high&#8208;efficiency photocatalysts for H2 release.

         <title>Organic Nanoparticles with Persistent Luminescence for In Vivo Afterglow Imaging&#8208;Guided Photodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Afterglow organic nanoparticles (ONPs) with long lifetime and near&#8208;infrared (NIR) emission offered high signal&#8208;to&#8208;background ratio and good tissue penetration for afterglow imaging&#8208;guided photodynamic therapy (PDT) in vivo. Owing to strong afterglow luminescence and abundant singlet oxygen generation from the ONPs upon NIR laser irradiation, they have shown effective suppression of tumor growth after imaging&#8208;guided PDT in mice with minimal damage to major organs.







Abstract
Optical imaging&#8208;guided photodynamic therapy (PDT), with precise localization and non&#8208;invasive treatment of tumors, is an emerging technique with great potential for cancer therapy. However, impaired by tissue auto&#8208;fluorescence that causes low signal&#8208;to&#8208;background ratio (SBR), most fluorescence imaging systems show poor sensitivity to tumors in vivo. In this study, we synthesized organic nanoparticles (ONPs) with persistent luminescence and good biocompatibility for afterglow imaging&#8208;guided PDT. The ONPs displayed near&#8208;infrared light emission with half&#8208;life time at minute level, which offered high SBR and good tissue penetration for in vivo afterglow tumor imaging. Taking advantage of their abundant singlet oxygen generation by NIR laser irradiation guided to the tumor sites, the ONPs also enabled imaging&#8208;guided PDT for efficient suppression of tumor growth in mice with minimal damage to major organs.

         <title>Naphthalenediimides with High Fluorescence Quantum Yield: Bright&#8208;Red, Stable, and Responsive Fluorescent Dyes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first example of a bis&#8208;NH2 core&#8208;substituted naphthalenediimide (NDI) with remarkably high 
. A simple synthetic protocol to NH2&#8208;substituted NDIs is described. Dependent on the substituents, fluorescence can be tuned from bright&#8208;green to the red/NIR region and the 
 modulated by two orders of magnitude. These fluorophores show large Stokes&#8208;shift and great responsiveness to solvent polarity.







Abstract
The naphthalenediimide (NDI) scaffold in contrast to its higher congeners possess low&#8208;fluorescence. In spite of elegant synthetic developments, a highly emissive NDI is quite rare to find, as well as, a green&#8208;light&#8208;emitting NDI is yet to be explored. Herein, we report a novel class of symmetric and asymmetric NH2&#8208;substituted core&#8208;NDIs (1&#8211;5) with tunable fluorescence in the visible region and extending to the NIR frontier. Importantly, the bis&#8208;NH2&#8208;substituted NDI 2 revealed quantum yield, 
 of &#8776;81 and &#8776;68&#8201;% in toluene and DMSO, respectively, suggesting versatility of the fluorophore in a wide range of solvent polarity. The dye 1 is shown to be the first NDI&#8208;based green&#8208;light emitter. The donor piperidine group in 5 diminish the 
 by 40&#8208;fold providing a lever to modulate the excited&#8208;state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT) process. Our synthetic protocol applies a Pd catalyst and a benign hydride source simplifying the non&#8208;trivial &#8722;NH2 group integration at the NDI&#8208;core. TD&#8208;DFT calculations predicted strong intramolecular hydrogen bonds in the excited state in the bulk nonpolar medium and responsiveness to solvent polarity. The maximization of the NDI emission outlined here would further boost the burgeoning repertoire of applications of the NDI scaffold.

         <title>Synthetic Approaches to Selenoesters</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Selenoesters are an important class of compounds that have wide possibilities for chemical transformations, being considered excellent building blocks for the synthesis of more complex molecules. In this review, an overview of the available methods for the synthesis of selenoesters will be presented. This overview is hoped to serve as a source of inspiration for the development of new strategies for the synthesis of this type of compound, as well as for their use as building blocks in synthesis.







Abstract
Selenoesters are compounds of great synthetic relevance since they can be used in several types of chemical transformations and mainly due to their great capacity in the formation of acyl radicals. Therefore, the scientific community has been developing several methods for the synthesis of this class of molecules. This review will address the synthesis of these compounds from different starting materials, such as carboxylic acids derivatives (acid chlorides and anhydrides), aldehydes, selenoacetylenes and miscellaneous methods.

         <title>Regioselective Synthesis of 1,2,3,4&#8208;Tetrasubstituted Arenes by Vicinal Functionalization of Arynes Derived from Aryl(Mes)iodonium Salts**
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Densely functionalized 1,2,3,4&#8208;substituted arenes are found in societally important molecules but are challenging to synthesize. This work reports on a method that uses aryl(Mes)iodonium salts as an aryne precursor via regioselective deprotonation. Various arynophiles are used and result in formation of C&#8722;C, C&#8722;N, C&#8722;O, C&#8722;Cl, and C&#8722;Si bonds; mechanistic insights from experiments and DFT calculations are provided.







Abstract
Herein, the synthesis of 1,2,3,4&#8208;tetrasubstituted benzenoid rings, motifs found in pharmaceutical, agrochemical, and natural products, is described.[1] In the past, the regioselective syntheses of such compounds have been a significant challenge. This work reports a method using substituted arynes derived from aryl(Mes)iodonium salts to access a range of densely functionalized 1,2,3,4&#8208;tetrasubstituted benzenoid rings. Significantly, it was found that halide substituents are compatible under these conditions, enabling post&#8208;synthetic elaboration via palladium&#8208;catalyzed coupling. This concise strategy is predicated on two regioselective events: 1)&#8197;ortho&#8208; deprotonation of aryl(Mes)iodonium salts to generate a substituted aryne intermediate, and 2)&#8197;regioselective trapping of said arynes, thereby improving previously reported reaction conditions to generate arynes at room temperature and in shorter reaction times. Density functional theory (DFT) computations and linear free energy relationship (LFER) analysis suggest the regioselectivity of deprotonation is influenced by both proximal and distal ring substituents on the aryne precursor. A competition experiment further reveals the role of arene substituents on relative reactivity of aryl(Mes)iodoniums as aryne precursors.

         <title>Scalable Synthesis of Porous SiFe@C Composite with Excellent Lithium Storage</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Threesome is impressive: A novel and scalable strategy for the fabrication of porous SiFe@C composite with mesoporous structure is reported. The conductive phase of FeSi2 is partially retained; together with a uniform carbon layer excellent lithium storage is achieved.







Abstract
Utilizing cost&#8208;effective raw materials to prepare high&#8208;performance silicon&#8208;based anode materials for lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) is both challenging and attractive. Herein, a porous SiFe@C (pSiFe@C) composite derived from low&#8208;cost ferrosilicon is prepared via a scalable three&#8208;step procedure, including ball milling, partial etching, and carbon layer coating. The pSiFe@C material integrates the advantages of the mesoporous structure, the partially retained FeSi2 conductive phase, and a uniform carbon layer (12&#8211;16&#8197;nm), which can substantially alleviate the huge volume expansion effect in the repeated lithium&#8208;ion insertion/extraction processes, effectively stabilizing the solid&#8211;electrolyte interphase (SEI) film and markedly enhancing the overall electronic conductivity of the material. Benefiting from the rational structure, the obtained pSiFe@C hybrid material delivers a reversible capacity of 1162.1&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 200&#8197;cycles at 500&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1, with a higher initial coulombic efficiency of 82.30&#8201;%. In addition, it shows large discharge capacities of 803.1 and 600.0&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 500&#8197;cycles at 2 and 4&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1, respectively, manifesting an excellent electrochemical lithium storage. This work provides a good prospect for the commercial production of silicon&#8208;based anode materials for LIBs with a high lithium&#8208;storage capacity.

         <title>Chemical Bonding in Homoleptic Carbonyl Cations [M{Fe(CO)5}2]+ (M=Cu, Ag, Au)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Donation of an electron pair from the HOMO of [Fe(CO)5]2 to the 4s LUMO of Cu+ giving the (+,+) component of the Fe&#8208;Cu&#8208;Fe &#963; bond in [Cu{Fe(CO)5}2]+. The associated charge flow with the direction red&#8594;blue is given by the deformation density.







Abstract
Syntheses of the copper and gold complexes [Cu{Fe(CO)5}2][SbF6] and [Au{Fe(CO)5}2][HOB{3,5&#8208;(CF3)2C6H3}3] containing the homoleptic carbonyl cations [M{Fe(CO)5}2]+ (M=Cu, Au) are reported. Structural data of the rare, trimetallic Cu2Fe, Ag2Fe and Au2Fe complexes [Cu{Fe(CO)5}2][SbF6], [Ag{Fe(CO)5}2][SbF6] and [Au{Fe(CO)5}2][HOB{3,5&#8208;(CF3)2C6H3}3] are also given. The silver and gold cations [M{Fe(CO)5}2]+ (M=Ag, Au) possess a nearly linear Fe&#8208;M&#8208;Fe&#8217; moiety but the Fe&#8208;Cu&#8208;Fe&#8217; in [Cu{Fe(CO)5}2][SbF6] exhibits a significant bending angle of 147&#176; due to the strong interaction with the [SbF6]&#8722; anion. The Fe(CO)5 ligands adopt a distorted square&#8208;pyramidal geometry in the cations [M{Fe(CO)5}2]+, with the basal CO groups inclined towards M. The geometry optimization with DFT methods of the cations [M{Fe(CO)5}2]+ (M=Cu, Ag, Au) gives equilibrium structures with linear Fe&#8208;M&#8208;Fe&#8217; fragments and D2 symmetry for the copper and silver cations and D4d symmetry for the gold cation. There is nearly free rotation of the Fe(CO)5 ligands around the Fe&#8208;M&#8208;Fe&#8217; axis. The calculated bond dissociation energies for the loss of both Fe(CO)5 ligands from the cations [M{Fe(CO)5}2]+ show the order M=Au (De=137.2&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1)&gt;Cu (De=109.0&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1)&gt;Ag (De=92.4&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1). The QTAIM analysis shows bond paths and bond critical points for the M&#8722;Fe linkage but not between M and the CO ligands. The EDA&#8208;NOCV calculations suggest that the [Fe(CO)5]&#8594;M+&#8592;[Fe(CO)5] donation is significantly stronger than the [Fe(CO)5]&#8592;M+&#8594;[Fe(CO)5] backdonation. Inspection of the pairwise orbital interactions identifies four contributions for the charge donation of the Fe(CO)5 ligands into the vacant (n)s and (n)p AOs of M+ and five components for the backdonation from the occupied (n&#8208;1)d AOs of M+ into vacant ligand orbitals.

         <title>Specific Ion&#8211;Protein Interactions Influence Bacterial Ice Nucleation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Effects of ions on bacterial ice nucleation: Freezing droplet experiments, sum&#8208;frequency generation spectroscopy, and molecular dynamic simulations were used to demonstrate that ions can profoundly influence the efficiency of bacterial ice nucleators in a manner that follows the Hofmeister series. The different effects are due to specific interactions of the ions with ice&#8208;nucleating proteins on the surface of the bacteria.

Ice nucleation&#8208;active bacteria are the most efficient ice nucleators known, enabling the crystallization of water at temperatures close to 0&#8201;&#176;C, thereby overcoming the kinetically hindered phase transition process at these conditions. Using highly specialized ice&#8208;nucleating proteins (INPs), they can cause frost damage to plants and influence the formation of clouds and precipitation in the atmosphere. In nature, the bacteria are usually found in aqueous environments containing ions. The impact of ions on bacterial ice nucleation efficiency, however, has remained elusive. Here, we demonstrate that ions can profoundly influence the efficiency of bacterial ice nucleators in a manner that follows the Hofmeister series. Weakly hydrated ions inhibit bacterial ice nucleation whereas strongly hydrated ions apparently facilitate ice nucleation. Surface&#8208;specific sum&#8208;frequency generation spectroscopy and molecular dynamics simulations reveal that the different effects are due to specific interactions of the ions with the INPs on the surface of the bacteria. Our results demonstrate that heterogeneous ice nucleation facilitated by bacteria strongly depends upon the nature of the ions, and specific ion&#8211;protein interactions are essential for the complete description of heterogeneous ice nucleation by bacteria.

         <title>Metal Cation Valency Dependence in Morphology Evolution of Cu2&#8722;xS Nanodisk Seeds and Their Pseudomorphic Cation Exchanges</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tin cation valency&#8208;dependent morphology evolution of Cu2&#8722;xS nanodisk seeds was initially developed. Subsequent pseudomorphic full/partial cation exchanges with Zn2+ and Cd2+ to produce traditionally inaccessible nanostructures were reported as well.







Abstract
A crucial parameter in the design of semiconductor nanoparticles (NPs) with controllable optical, magnetic, electronic, and catalytic properties is the morphology. Herein, we demonstrate the potential of additive metal cations with variable valency to direct the morphology evolution of copper&#8208;deficient Cu2&#8722;xS nanoparticles in the process of seed&#8208;mediated growth. In particular, the djurleite Cu1.94S seed could evolve from disk into tetradecahedron in the presence of tin(IV) cations, whereas they merely formed sharp hexagonal nanodisks with tin(II) cations. In addition to djurleite Cu1.94S, the tin(IV) cations could be generalized to direct the growth of roxbyite Cu1.8S and covellite CuS nanodisk seeds into tetradecahedra. We further perform pseudomorphic cation exchanges of Cu1.94S tetradecahedra with Zn2+ and Cd2+ to produce polyhedral zinc sulfide (ZnS) and cadmium sulfide (CdS) NPs. Moreover, we achieve Cu1.8S/ZnS and Cu1.94S/CdS tetradecahedral heterostructures via partial cation exchange, which are otherwise inaccessible by traditional synthetic approaches.

         <title>Overview of N&#8208;Rich Antennae Investigated in Lanthanide&#8208;Based Temperature Sensing</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Noncontact temperature sensors are gaining importance. Lanthanide&#8208;based temperature sensors stand out as they benefit form for example, high photostability. In this Review, an extensive overview on N&#8208;rich antennae used in lanthanide based temperature sensing is provided. The potential of N&#8208;rich small molecules, bi&#8208;and polynuclear complexes, metal organic frameworks, periodic mesoporous organosilicas and porous organic polymers are discussed.







Abstract
The market share of noncontact temperature sensors is expending due to fast technological and medical evolutions. In the wide variety of noncontact sensors, lanthanide&#8208;based temperature sensors stand out. They benefit from high photostability, relatively long decay times and high quantum yields. To circumvent their low molar light absorption, the incorporation of a light&#8208;harvesting antenna is required. This Review provides an overview of the nitrogen&#8208;rich antennae in lanthanide&#8208;based temperature sensors, emitting in the visible light spectrum, and discusses their temperature sensor ability. The N&#8208;rich ligands are incorporated in many different platforms. The investigation of different antennae is required to develop temperature sensors with diverse optical properties and to create a diverse offer for the multiple application fields. Molecular probes, consisting of small molecules, are first discussed. Furthermore, the thermometer properties of ratiometric temperature sensors, based on di&#8208; and polynuclear complexes, metal&#8211;organic frameworks, periodic mesoporous organosilicas and porous organic polymers, are summarized. The antenna mainly determines the application potential of the ratiometric thermometer. It can be observed that molecular probes are operational in the broad physiological range, metal&#8211;organic frameworks are generally very useful in the cryogenic region, periodic mesoporous organosilica show temperature dependency in the physiological range, and porous organic polymers are operative in the cryogenic&#8208;to&#8208;medium temperature range.

         <title>Biological and Medical Applications of Calcium Phosphate Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Calcium phosphate nanoparticles are well suited to transport organic or biological molecules into cells and tissue. They are well tolerated by cells and organisms and have a clearly defined degradation pathway, also due to their almost ubiquitous presence in the body. Promising applications for them are seen in drug and gene delivery and also in immunization, for example, for vaccination. This Review explores the synthesis, characterization, functionalization and biomedical applications of calcium phosphate nanoparticles from the recent literature.







Abstract
Calcium phosphate nanoparticles have a high biocompatibility and biodegradability due to their chemical similarity to human hard tissue, for example, bone and teeth. They can be used as efficient carriers for different kinds of biomolecules such as nucleic acids, proteins, peptides, antibodies, or drugs, which alone are not able to enter cells where their biological effect is required. They can be loaded with cargo molecules by incorporating them, unlike solid nanoparticles, and also by surface functionalization. This offers protection, for example, against nucleases, and the possibility for cell targeting. If such nanoparticles are functionalized with fluorescing dyes, they can be applied for imaging in vitro and in vivo. Synthesis, functionalization and cell uptake mechanisms of calcium phosphate nanoparticles are discussed together with applications in transfection, gene silencing, imaging, immunization, and bone substitution. Biodistribution data of calcium phosphate nanoparticles in vivo are reviewed.

         <title>Catalytic Performance of Zr&#8208;Based Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks Zr&#8208;abtc and MIP&#8208;200 in Selective Oxidations with H2O2</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An eight&#8208;connected metal&#8211;organic framework Zr&#8208;abtc catalyzes a range of H2O2&#8208;based selective oxidations. The significant predominance of 1,2&#8208;epoxide in the epoxidation of carvone and high sulfone selectivity in thioether oxidation point to a nucleophilic oxidation mechanism. With highly reactive alkenes, such as caryophyllene, electrophilic oxidation can also be realized.







Abstract
The catalytic performance of Zr&#8208;abtc and MIP&#8208;200 metal&#8211;organic frameworks consisting of 8&#8208;connected Zr6 clusters and tetratopic linkers was investigated in H2O2&#8208;based selective oxidations and compared with that of 12&#8208;coordinated UiO&#8208;66 and UiO&#8208;67. Zr&#8208;abtc demonstrated advantages in both substrate conversion and product selectivity for epoxidation of electron&#8208;deficient C=C bonds in &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated ketones. The significant predominance of 1,2&#8208;epoxide in carvone epoxidation, coupled with high sulfone selectivity in thioether oxidation, points to a nucleophilic oxidation mechanism over Zr&#8208;abtc. The superior catalytic performance in the epoxidation of unsaturated ketones correlates with a larger amount of weak basic sites in Zr&#8208;abtc. Electrophilic activation of H2O2 can also be realized, as evidenced by the high activity of Zr&#8208;abtc in epoxidation of the electron&#8208;rich C=C bond in caryophyllene. XRD and FTIR studies confirmed the retention of the Zr&#8208;abtc structure after the catalysis. The low activity of MIP&#8208;200 in H2O2&#8208;based oxidations is most likely related to its specific hydrophilicity, which disfavors adsorption of organic substrates and H2O2.

         <title>New Noncentrosymmetric Tetrel Pnictides Composed of Square&#8208;Planar Gold(I) with Peculiar Bonding</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bonding natures: Compared with common types of AuI coordination observed in extended solids, square&#8208;planar coordination is rare. Au(I)relia shows off the three&#8208;centered bonding of Au&#8722;Tt&#8722;Au and Au&#8722;Pn&#8722;Au (on her feathers; Tt=tetrel, Pn=pnictogen), square&#8208;planar cis&#8208;[AuTt2Pn2] units (her body), and linear chains of Au (her legs) that are characteristic of equiatomic AuSiAs, AuGeP, and AuGeAs compounds.







Abstract
Three novel isostructural equiatomic gold tetrel pnictides, AuSiAs, AuGeP, and AuGeAs, were synthesized and characterized. These phases crystallize in the noncentrosymmetric (NCS) monoclinic space group Cc (no. 9), featuring square&#8208;planar Au within cis&#8208;[AuTt2Pn2] units (Tt=tetrel, Si, Ge; Pn=pnictogen, P, As). This is in drastic contrast to the structure of previously reported AuSiP, which exhibits typical linear coordination of Au with Si and P. Chemical bonding analysis through the electron localization function suggests covalent two&#8208;center two&#8208;electron Tt&#8722;Pn bonds, and three&#8208;center Au&#8722;Tt&#8722;Au and Au&#8722;Pn&#8722;Au bonds with 1.6&#8197;e&#8722; per bond. X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy studies support the covalent and nonionic nature of Au&#8722;Pn and Au&#8722;Tt bonds. The title materials were found to be n&#8208;type narrow&#8208;gap semiconductors or semimetals, with nearly temperature&#8208;independent electrical resistivities and low thermal conductivities. A combination of the semimetallic properties with tunable NCS structure provides opportunities for the development of materials based on gold tetrel pnictides.

         <title>Altered Membrane Mechanics Provides a Receptor&#8208;Independent Pathway for Serotonin Action</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
It is known that serotonin binds to lipid membranes with high affinity, but what does it do to it? We find that it makes artificial lipid bilayers softer and easier to indent by an AFM tip (top), and promotes disorder in ordered regions. For cell membranes, this effect facilitates increased endocytosis (bottom). This increase occurs even when the serotonin receptors are blocked, providing a receptor&#8208;independent pathway for serotonin action.







Abstract
Serotonin, an important signaling molecule in humans, has an unexpectedly high lipid membrane affinity. The significance of this finding has evoked considerable speculation. Here we show that membrane binding by serotonin can directly modulate membrane properties and cellular function, providing an activity pathway completely independent of serotonin receptors. Atomic force microscopy shows that serotonin makes artificial lipid bilayers softer, and induces nucleation of liquid disordered domains inside the raft&#8208;like liquid&#8208;ordered domains. Solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy corroborates this data at the atomic level, revealing a homogeneous decrease in the order parameter of the lipid chains in the presence of serotonin. In the RN46A immortalized serotonergic neuronal cell line, extracellular serotonin enhances transferrin receptor endocytosis, even in the presence of broad&#8208;spectrum serotonin receptor and transporter inhibitors. Similarly, it increases the membrane binding and internalization of oligomeric peptides. Our results uncover a mode of serotonin&#8211;membrane interaction that can potentiate key cellular processes in a receptor&#8208;independent fashion.

         <title>Multiply Charged Helium Droplet Anions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Charged droplets: The detection of multiply charged helium droplet anions is reported for the first time. By ionizing droplets of superfluid helium with low energy electrons (up to 25&#8197;eV), it was possible to produce droplets containing up to five negative charges, which remain intact on the timescale of the experiment.







Abstract
The detection of multiply charged helium droplet anions is reported for the first time. By ionizing droplets of superfluid helium with low energy electrons (up to 25&#8197;eV), it was possible to produce droplets containing up to five negative charges, which remain intact on the timescale of the experiment. The appearance sizes for different charge states are determined and are found to be orders of magnitude larger than for the equivalent cationic droplets, starting at 4 million He atoms for dianions. Droplets with He*&#8722; as charge carriers show signs of being metastable, but this effect is quenched by the pickup of water molecules.

         <title>Tunable Anticancer Activity of Furoylthiourea&#8208;Based RuII&#8211;Arene Complexes and Their Mechanism of Action</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multitasking! Fourteen new Ru&#8211;arene (p&#8208;cymene or benzene) complexes bearing different furoylthiourea ligands have been synthesized and characterized. All the complexes were found to be highly toxic towards IMR&#8208;32 cancer cells. The complexes catalytically oxidized glutathione and promoted cell death by apoptosis and cell cycle arrest. They also showed good binding ability with receptors commonly overexpressed in cancer cells.







Abstract
Fourteen new RuII&#8211;arene (p&#8208;cymene/benzene) complexes (C1&#8211;C14) have been synthesized by varying the N&#8208;terminal substituent in the furoylthiourea ligand and satisfactorily characterized by using analytical and spectroscopic techniques. Electrostatic potential maps predicted that the electronic effect of the substituents was mostly localized, with some influence seen on the labile chloride ligands. The structure&#8211;activity relationships of the Ru&#8211;p&#8208;cymene and Ru&#8211;benzene complexes showed opposite trends. All the complexes were found to be highly toxic towards IMR&#8208;32 cancer cells, with C5 (Ru&#8211;p&#8208;cymene complex containing C6H2(CH3)3 as N&#8208;terminal substituent) and C13 (Ru&#8211;benzene complex containing C6H4(CF3) as N&#8208;terminal substituent) showing the highest activity among each set of complexes, and hence they were chosen for further study. These complexes showed different behavior in aqueous solutions, and were also found to catalytically oxidize glutathione. They also promoted cell death by apoptosis and cell cycle arrest. Furthermore, the complexes showed good binding ability with the receptors Pim&#8208;1 kinase and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2, commonly overexpressed in cancer cells.
