         <dc:description>A palladium&#8208;catalyzed [3+2] annulation of substituted benzoic acids with maleimides leading to tricyclic heterocyclic molecules having a free carboxylic group in a high atom and step&#8208;economical manner is reported.

An external ligand (MPAA) is crucial for the success of this annulation protocol. Further, the decarboxylation and esterification of the free carboxylic acid group of annulation products were carried out.</dc:description>

         <title>Effects of cis/trans&#8208;Configuration and Ligand Substitution of the Cyanidometal Bridge on Metal to Metal Charge Transfer Properties in Mixed Valence Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two series of trinuclear cyanidometal&#8208;bridged compounds with cis/trans configuration were synthesized and fully characterized in this work. The experimental results show that the trans&#8208;configuration and the ligand with high electron&#8208;donating ability of the central cyanidometal bridge are more favorable for MMCT in trinuclear cyanidometal&#8208;bridged mixed valence compounds, and these mixed valence compounds all belong to localized compounds, supported by the TDDFT calculations.







Abstract
To investigate the effects of cis/trans&#8208;configuration of the cyanidometal bridge and the electron donating ability of the auxiliary ligand on the cyanidometal bridge on metal to metal charge transfer (MMCT) in cyanidometal&#8208;bridged mixed valence compounds, two groups of trinuclear cyanidometal&#8208;bridged compounds cis/trans&#8208;[Cp(dppe)Fe(&#956;&#8208;NC)Ru(4,4&#8217;&#8208;dmbpy)2(&#956;&#8208;CN)Fe(dppe)Cp][PF6]n (n=2 (cis/trans&#8208;1[PF6]2), 3 (cis/trans&#8208;1[PF6]3), 4 (cis/trans&#8208;1[PF6]4)) and cis/trans&#8208;[Cp(dppe)Fe(&#956;&#8208;NC)Ru(bpy)2(&#956;&#8208;CN)Fe(dppe)Cp][PF6]3 (cis/trans&#8208;2[PF6]3) were synthesized and fully characterized. The experimental results indicate that for these one&#8208; and two&#8208;electron oxidation mixed valence compounds, the trans&#8208;configuration compounds are more beneficial for MMCT than the cis&#8208;configuration compounds, and increasing the electron donating ability of the auxiliary ligand on the cyanidometal bridge is also conductive to MMCT. Moreover, compounds cis/trans&#8208;1[PF6]n (n=3, 4) and cis/trans&#8208;2[PF6]3 belong to localized compounds by analyzing the experimental characterization results, supported by the TDDFT calculations.

&lt;p&gt;Two series of trinuclear cyanidometal-bridged compounds with cis/trans configuration were synthesized and fully characterized in this work. The experimental results show that the trans-configuration and the ligand with high electron-donating ability of the central cyanidometal bridge are more favorable for MMCT in trinuclear cyanidometal-bridged mixed valence compounds, and these mixed valence compounds all belong to localized compounds, supported by the TDDFT calculations.

         <dc:description>The utility of 2&#8208;diphenylphosphoryloxy&#8208;1,3&#8208;dienes for the construction of substituted six&#8208;membered nitrogen heterocycles is presented. These dienes undergo boron trifluoride&#8208;promoted aza&#8208;Diels&#8208;Alder reactions when reacted with imines or related species formed in situ using aldehydes and amine derivatives. The stability of the dienes allows this three&#8208;component reaction to be carried out with no special precautions to eliminate water or air. Thirty&#8208;one examples of this process are presented. The usefulness of the enol phosphate functional group is highlighted in further reactions after the cycloaddition step to generate functionalized piperidenes or pyridines.</dc:description>

         <title>Molecular Bridging Enables Isolated Iron Atoms on Stereoassembled Carbon Framework To Boost Oxygen Reduction for Zinc&#8208;air Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Realizing the synergy between active site regulation and rational structural engineering is essential in the electrocatalysis community but still challenging. Here, we demonstrate a matrix&#8208;confined co&#8208;pyrolysis strategy based on molecular bridging to realize highly dispersed Fe atoms on stereoassembled carbon framework. Both polyacrylonitrile matrix and organic linker from metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) provide sufficient N&#8208;anchoring sites for the generation of Fe&#8208;N  4  moieties. A high Fe loading of 2.9 wt.% is readily achieved based on the scalable approach without post&#8208;treatment. Owing to the presence of highly exposed Fe&#8208;N&#8208;C sites and well&#8208;tuned pore structures, isolated Fe atoms on porous carbon nanofiber framework (Fe&#8208;SA/NCF) exhibits decent oxygen reduction activity and stability in alkaline conditions via a near four&#8208;electron path, demonstrating superior performance as air cathode for zinc&#8208;air batteries (ZABs) to commercial Pt/C catalyst.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This work details the synthesis, characterization, and catalytic activity of reactive low&#8208;coordinate organozinc complexes. The complexes activate hydrogen and they appear to be more active in hydrogenation of ketones and imines than their tridentate pincer analogs. This is thought, in part, to be due to the lack of trailing third phosphorus arm present in previous work. DFT computations reveal a sigma&#8208;bond metathesis mechanism is comparable to an alternative aromatization/dearomatization metal&#8208;ligand cooperative mechanism.</dc:description>

Ullmann coupling of  11  with pentaphenyliodobenzene (  9  ) gave compound  2  in 1.7% yield, and Sonogashira coupling of  11  with phenylacetylene, followed by a double Diels&#8208;Alder reaction of the product diyne  12  with tetracyclone (  6  ), gave  2  in 1.5% overall yield.

         <title>Preparation of a Large Amount of Ultrathin Graphdiyne</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple and feasible synthesis method is developed to achieve the preparation of GDY with high&#8208;quality and large&#8208;scale. By simply mixing the solution of GDY monomer in CHCl3 and catalysts in water and stirring at room temperature, high&#8208;quality GDY films with a thickness of &#8764;4&#8197;nm can be obtained at the interface of the two&#8208;phase.







Abstract
We report a facile strategy to prepare a large amount of ultrathin graphdiyne (GDY) with good crystallinity in the mixture of oil&#8211;water systems. By simply mixing the solution of GDY monomer in CHCl3 and the copper acetate solution as a catalyst in water and stirring at room temperature, ultrathin GDY films with a thickness of &#8764;4&#8197;nm were obtained in a yield of 95&#8201;%. This work provides a feasible path for the substantial preparation of GDY films and may pave the way to the development of substantial preparation of the GDY materials.

         <title>Adaptable optical microwaveguides from mechanically flexible crystalline materials</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Flexible organic crystals (elastic and plastic) are important materials for optical waveguides, tunable optoelectronic devices, and photonic integrated circuits. Here, we present highly elastic organic crystals of a Schiff base, 1&#8208;((E)&#8208;(2,5&#8208;dichlorophenylimino)methyl)naphthalen&#8208;2&#8208;ol (  1  ) and an azine molecule, 2,4&#8208;dibromo&#8208;6&#8208;((E)&#8208;((E)&#8208;(2,6&#8208;dichlorobenzylidene)hydrazono)methyl)phenol (  2  ). These microcrystals are highly flexible under external mechanical force, both in the macroscopic and the microscopic regimes. The mechanical flexibility of these crystals arises as a result of weak and dispersive C&#8211;H&#183;&#183;&#183;Cl, Cl&#183;&#183;&#183;Cl, Br&#183;&#183;&#183;Br, and &#960;&#183;&#183;&#183;&#960; stacking interactions. Singly and doubly&#8208;bent geometries were achieved from their straight shape by a micromechanical approach using the AFM cantilever tip. Crystals of molecules  1  and  2  display a bright&#8208;green and red fluorescence (FL) emission, respectively, and selective reabsorption of a part of their FL band. Crystals  1  and  2  exhibit optical&#8208;path&#8208;dependent low loss emissions at the termini of crystal in their straight and even in extremely bent geometries. Interestingly, the excitation position&#8208;dependent optical modes appear in both linear and bent waveguides of crystals  1  and  2  , confirming their light&#8208;trapping ability.</dc:description>

This concept paper reviews the background, the concept, mechanism, and related imaging application, as well as existing challenges and proposes future developmental directions for the dye&#8208;sensitized afterglow nanoparticles.







Abstract
While concerns about improving recharged afterglow intensity in&#8197;vivo still motivate further exploration, afterglow nanoparticles (AGNP) offer unique optical merit for autofluorescence&#8208;free biological imaging. Apart from efforts enhancing the afterglow emission properties of AGNP, improving afterglow excitation response to visible or near infrared light is important but has lacked success. Dye sensitization has been used to improve the optical response of photovoltaic nanomaterials and to enhance upconversion luminescence efficiency. This concept has recently been expanded and applied to AGNPs. As a new multifunctional nanoprobe, such dye&#8208;sensitized AGNP takes advantage of both high spatial resolution fluorescence imaging and sensitive afterglow imaging. This Concept introduces the background, the concept, mechanism, and related imaging application, as well as reviewing existing challenges and proposing future developmental directions for the dye&#8208;sensitized AGNPs.

         <title>Diradicals Photogeneration from Chloroaryl&#8208;Substituted Carboxylic Acids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 26, May 6, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
New classes of thermally inaccessible diradicals having aggressive or stabilized radical sites have been generated under mild conditions by an Intramolecular Electron Transfer (IET) process occurring in photogenerated triplet phenyl cations.







Abstract
With the aim of generating new, thermally inaccessible diradicals, potentially able to induce a double&#8208;strand DNA cleavage, the photochemistry of a set of chloroaryl&#8208;substituted carboxylic acids in polar media was investigated. The photoheterolytic cleavage of the Ar&#8722;Cl bond occurred in each case to form the corresponding triplet phenyl cations. Under basic conditions, the photorelease of the chloride anion was accompanied by an intramolecular electron&#8208;transfer from the carboxylate group to the aromatic radical cationic site to give a diradical species. This latter intermediate could then undergo CO2 loss in a structure&#8208;dependent fashion, according to the stability of the resulting diradical, or abstract a hydrogen atom from the medium. In aqueous environment at physiological pH (pH=7.3), both a phenyl cation and a diradical chemistry was observed. The mechanistic scenario and the role of the various intermediates (aryl cations and diradicals) involved in the process was supported by computational analysis.

     alt="Diradicals Photogeneration from Chloroaryl-Substituted Carboxylic Acids"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;New classes of thermally&lt;/b&gt; inaccessible diradicals having aggressive or stabilized radical sites have been generated under mild conditions by an Intramolecular Electron Transfer (IET) process occurring in photogenerated triplet phenyl cations.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the aim of generating new, thermally inaccessible diradicals, potentially able to induce a double-strand DNA cleavage, the photochemistry of a set of chloroaryl-substituted carboxylic acids in polar media was investigated. The photoheterolytic cleavage of the Ar&#8722;Cl bond occurred in each case to form the corresponding triplet phenyl cations. Under basic conditions, the photorelease of the chloride anion was accompanied by an intramolecular electron-transfer from the carboxylate group to the aromatic radical cationic site to give a diradical species. This latter intermediate could then undergo CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; loss in a structure-dependent fashion, according to the stability of the resulting diradical, or abstract a hydrogen atom from the medium. In aqueous environment at physiological pH (pH=7.3), both a phenyl cation and a diradical chemistry was observed. The mechanistic scenario and the role of the various intermediates (aryl cations and diradicals) involved in the process was supported by computational analysis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

A new covalent organic framework (COF) has been synthesized from 4,4&#8242;,4&#8242;&#8242;,4&#8242;&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;(pyrene&#8208;1,3,6,8&#8208;tetrayl)tetraaniline and 2,5&#8208;dimethoxyterephthalaldehyde (DMTA) under solvothermal conditions, which is named as Py&#8208;DMTA&#8208;COF. The designed Py&#8208;DMTA&#8208;COF exhibits better photocatalytic activity, broad substrate applicability and excellent recyclability for the preparation of thiophosphinates from phosphine oxides and thiols, which opens a new way to develop metal&#8208;free, base&#8208;free, and economical photocatalysts for organic transformations.







Abstract
Two new covalent organic frameworks (COFs) were synthesized from 4,4&#8242;,4&#8242;&#8242;,4&#8242;&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;(pyrene&#8208;1,3,6,8&#8208;tetrayl)tetraaniline and 2,5&#8208;dimethoxyterephthalaldehyde (Py&#8208;DMTA&#8208;COF) or 2&#8242;,5&#8242;&#8208;dimethoxy&#8208;[1,1&#8242;:4&#8242;,1&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;terphenyl]&#8208;4,4&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;dicarbaldehyde (Py&#8208;DMTPDA&#8208;COF) under solvothermal conditions. These two COFs were further facilely developed as efficient photocatalytic platforms for the synthesis of thiophosphinates. Py&#8208;DMTA&#8208;COF exhibited better photocatalytic activity, broad substrate applicability, and excellent recycling capacity for the preparation of thiophosphinates from P(O)H compounds and thiols compared to Py&#8208;DMTPDA&#8208;COF. This methodology was further extended to the seamless gram&#8208;scale production of target phosphorothioate derivatives. The results demonstrate that COFs can provide a robust platform for developing metal&#8208;free, base&#8208;free, highly efficient, and reusable heterogeneous photocatalysts for organic transformations.

         <title>Mechanistic Insights into the Photoisomerization of N,N&#8242;&#8208;Disubstituted Indigos</title>

         <dc:description>
Indigo photoswitches can undergo photoisomerization triggered by red&#8208;light, which is of immense potential in applications such as biomedical research and material science. In this mechanistic investigation, the influence of chemical environment and N&#8208;substituents is elucidated through photophysical and computational approaches. This study further provides insights into the course of photoisomerization.







Abstract
N,N&#8242;&#8208;disubstituted indigos are photoswitchable molecules that have recently caught the attention due to their addressability by red&#8208;light. When alkyl and aryl groups are utilized as the N&#8208;substituents, the thermal half&#8208;lives of Z isomers can be tuned independently while maintaining the advantageous red&#8208;shifted absorption spectra. To utilize these molecules in real&#8208;world applications, it is of immense importance to understand how their molecular structures as well as the environment influence their switching properties. To this end, we probed their photoisomerization mechanism by carrying out photophysical and computational studies in solvents of different polarities. The fluorescence and transient absorption experiments suggest for more polar excited and transition states, which explains the bathochromic shifts of absorption spectra and shorter thermal half&#8208;lives. On the other hand, the quantum chemical calculations reveal that in contrast to N&#8208;carbonyl groups, N&#8208;alkyl and N&#8208;aryl substituents are not strongly conjugated with the indigo chromophore and can thus serve as a tool for tuning the thermal stability of Z isomers. Both approaches are combined to provide in&#8208;depth understandings of how indigos undergo photoswitching as well as how they are influenced by N&#8208;substituent and the chemical surroundings. These mechanistic insights will serve as guiding principles for designing molecules eyeing broader applications.

         <title>Diarylcuprates for Selective Syntheses of Multifunctionalized Ketones from Thioesters under Mild Conditions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 26, May 6, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A copper&#8208;bottomed synthesis: In situ&#8208;generated diarylcuprates enable the selective synthesis of multifunctionalized ketones from thioesters in excellent yields under mild conditions. This reaction could be applied to preparing synthetic intermediates for canagliflozin and (+)&#8208;biotin. A reaction mechanism for this ketone synthesis was proposed based on control experiments with an isolated diphenylcuprate complex, [Mg2Br3(THF)6][CuPh2], and DFT calculations.







Abstract
Ketones were selectively synthesized from thioesters by using diarylcuprates(I) generated in&#8197;situ from copper(I) salts and aryl Grignard reagents in a 1&#8201;:&#8201;1.3&#8211;1.5&#8197;ratio under ambient temperature. During the ketone synthesis, various functional groups, such as carbonyl (ketones, esters, and amides), O&#8208;protecting groups, halogens, and heteroarenes, were tolerated to afford multifunctionalized ketones in excellent yields. This copper&#8208;mediated ketone synthesis could be applied to the synthesis of not only gluconolactone&#8208;derived ketone 6, a synthetic intermediate in the transformation to the SGLT2 inhibitor canagliflozin, but also thiolactol 8, a valuable synthetic intermediate for (+)&#8208;biotin. Control experiments on an isolated diphenylcuprate(I), [CuPh2]&#8722; (12), and DFT calculations revealed that this ketone synthesis proceeded by oxidative addition of the C&#8722;S bond of thioesters to [CuPh2]&#8722;, while reductive elimination from the CuIII intermediate produced the corresponding ketone and an inactive species [(RS)CuPh]&#8722;, the latter reacted with [CuPh]4 (11) to regenerate the reactive diphenylcuprate(I).

Control experiments on an isolated diphenylcuprate(I), [CuPh&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; (&lt;b&gt;12&lt;/b&gt;), and DFT calculations revealed that this ketone synthesis proceeded by oxidative addition of the C&#8722;S bond of thioesters to [CuPh&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;, while reductive elimination from the Cu&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt; intermediate produced the corresponding ketone and an inactive species [(RS)CuPh]&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;, the latter reacted with [CuPh]&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; (&lt;b&gt;11&lt;/b&gt;) to regenerate the reactive diphenylcuprate(I).&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Electrochemically Driven Swinging of a Nitrobenzyl Pendant Arm in a Nickel Scorpionand Complex</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 26, May 6, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electrochemically driven intra&#8208;molecular motion on cathodic reduction of the NiII macrocyclic complex a, the electron first goes on the nitro group (b), then, following the swinging motion of the nitrobenzyl side chain, it is transferred onto the metal centre, giving rise to an authentic NiI (d9) scorpionate complex (c).







Abstract
A radical anion &#8722;NO2.&#8722; is formed upon an electrochemically reversible one&#8208;electron reduction of the square&#8208;planar NiII complex of N&#8208;nitrobenzylcyclam. The &#8722;NO2.&#8722; group goes to occupy an axial position of the metal ion, thus establishing a significant electronic interaction with the metal center. In particular, the ESR spectrum supports the occurrence of an electron transfer from &#8722;NO2.&#8722; to the metal, which therefore presents a significant NiI character. On re&#8208;oxidation, the nitrobenzyl side chain detaches and the NiII complex is restored, providing an example of a fully reversible redox driven intramolecular motion.

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light Assisted Covalent Surface Functionalization of Reduced Graphene Oxide Nanosheets with Arylazo Sulfones</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 26, May 6, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lightning @ surface: The visible&#8208;light irradiation of unharmful and photolabile arylazo sulfones enabled the efficient covalent decoration (i.&#8201;e. arylation) of reduced&#8208;graphene&#8208;oxide (rGO) surfaces under mild, functional&#8208;group&#8208;tolerant and photosensitizer&#8208;free conditions. Nanomanipulation of the tagged rGO surface via Pd&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling was also documented.







Abstract
We present an environmentally benign methodology for the covalent functionalization (arylation) of reduced graphene oxide (rGO) nanosheets with arylazo sulfones. A variety of tagged aryl units were conveniently accommodated at the rGO surface via visible&#8208;light irradiation of suspensions of carbon nanostructured materials in aqueous media. Mild reaction conditions, absence of photosensitizers, functional group tolerance and high atomic fractions (XPS analysis) represent some of the salient features characterizing the present methodology. Control experiments for the mechanistic elucidation (Raman analysis) and chemical nanomanipulation of the tagged rGO surfaces are also reported.

         <title>Dissipative Dynamic Covalent Chemistry (DDCvC) Based on the Transimination Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 26, May 6, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dissipative dynamic libraries (DDLs) of imines are generated by addition of 2&#8208;cyano&#8208;2&#8208;(4&#8217;&#8208;chloro)phenylpropanoic acid employed as a chemical fuel to equilibrated dynamic libraries (DLs). At the addition of the fuel the initial composition of the library dictated by the thermodynamic equilibrium is perturbed and a transient, temporal controllable, out of equilibrium state is obtained, which reverts to the initial equilibrium when the fuel is exhausted.







Abstract
This work reports that the composition of a dynamic library (DL) of interconverting imines can be controlled over time in a dissipative fashion by the addition of an activated carboxylic acid used as a chemical fuel. When the fuel is added to the DL, which is initially under thermodynamic equilibrium, the composition of the mixture dramatically changes and a new, dissipative (out of equilibrium) state is reached that persists until fuel exhaustion. Thus, a transient dissipative dynamic library (DDL) is generated that, eventually, reverts back to the initial DL when the fuel is consumed, closing a DL&#8594;DDL&#8594;DL cycle. The larger the amount of added fuel, the longer the time spent by the system in the DDL state. The transimination reaction is shown to be an optimal candidate for the realization of a dissipative dynamic covalent chemistry (DDCvC).

         <title>Epigenetic Anti&#8208;Cancer Treatment With a Stabilized Carbocyclic Decitabine Analogue</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 26, May 6, 2022. </description>

The carbocyclic decitabine analogue cAzadC outperforms decitabine (5&#8208;aza&#8208;2&#8217;&#8208;deoxycytidine, AzadC) in an acute myeloid leukemia cell line. AzadC is used in the clinic as an epigenetic drug against AML, but is very sensitive towards hydrolysis, which limits its application. cAzadC is substantially more stable than AzadC, but still inhibits DNA methyltransferases (DNMT) and importantly, it induces significantly more deleterious DNA strand breaks than AzadC, making it a promising next&#8208;generation epigenetic drug.







Abstract
5&#8208;Aza&#8208;2&#8217;&#8208;deoxycytidine (Decitabine, AzadC) is a nucleoside analogue, which is in clinical use to treat patients with myelodysplastic syndrome or acute myeloid leukemia. Its mode of action is unusual because the compound is one of the few drugs that act at the epigenetic level of the genetic code. AzadC is incorporated as an antimetabolite into the genome and creates covalent, inhibitory links to DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) that methylate 2&#8217;&#8208;deoxycytidine (dC) to 5&#8208;methyl&#8208;dC (mdC). Consequently, AzadC treatment leads to a global loss of mdC, which presumably results in a reactivation of silenced genes, among them tumor suppressor and DNA damage response genes. Because AzadC suffers from severe instability, which limits its use in the clinic, a more sophisticated AzadC derivative would be highly valuable. Here, we report that a recently developed carbocyclic AzadC analogue (cAzadC) blocks DNMT1 in the AML cell line MOLM&#8208;13 as efficient as AzadC. Moreover, cAzadC has a surprisingly strong anti&#8208;proliferative effect and leads to a significantly higher number of double strand breaks compared to AzadC, while showing less off&#8208;target toxicity. These results show that cAzadC triggers more deleterious repair and apoptotic pathways in cancer cells than AzadC, which makes cAzadC a promising next generation epigenetic drug.

         <dc:description>
By reacting the novel bispidine ligand L3 with HgCl2, various coordination polymers having three different topologies (zig&#8208;zag, ribbon&#8208;like and poly[n]catenane), but all constituted by linear 1D arrays, can be formed. Their ability to undergo structural transformation via adsorption or solvent exchange has been reported and related to their structural features.







Abstract
One&#8208;dimensional (1D) coordination polymers (CPs) featuring three different topologies, comprising zig&#8208;zag, ribbon&#8208;like and poly&#8208;[n]&#8208;catenane structures, were obtained by reaction of Hg(II) ions with a novel bispidine ligand L3, and structurally characterized by SC&#8208; and P&#8208;XRD methods. The CPs obtained in the form of microcrystalline powders were tested for their ability to undergo solvent adsorption and exchange by P&#8208;XRD and 1H&#8197;NMR spectroscopy. The extent of their dynamic behavior was then correlated to their structural features, highlighting the role of interchain interactions established among their constituting linear arrays. Zig&#8208;zag CPs proved to be resilient to external chemical stimuli, while they differently respond to thermal treatments, depending on the solvent originally included within the CP. In the case of polycatenated structures, we observed transformations where the original topology was maintained upon guest exchange, but also cases where it changed to zig&#8208;zag, even under solid/vapor conditions (i.&#8201;e., no complete dissolution of the CP). Given the presence of linear interconnected 1D channels, 3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;ClBz&#8208;polycatenanePwd is also able to trap volatile guests such as n&#8208;hexane when exposed to its vapors.

         <title>A Photoresponsive Receptor with a 105 Magnitude of Reversible Anion&#8208;Binding Switching</title>

A highly efficient anion receptor with photoswitchable functionality based on a new photoresponsive chromophore is introduced. Upon photoirradiation with UV light, (E,E)&#8208;2&#8208;pyridyl&#8208;diiminoguanidinium displays a switched&#8208;off change in binding strength towards sulfate of more than five orders of magnitude. In DMSO, the open E,E form binds sulfate with extraordinary strength through chelating guanidinium hydrogen bonds. Upon photoisomerization to the Z,Z isomer, the anion&#8208;binding site is shut off by intramolecular hydrogen bonds to the 2&#8208;pyridyl substituents, thereby releasing the bound sulfate.







Abstract
In a leap toward anion separation that uses only energy input for binding and release cycles, we report herein a new class of photoswitchable anion receptors featuring a diiminoguanidinium functionality that displays a change of more than five orders of magnitude in switched&#8208;off binding strength towards sulfate, a representative oxyanion, upon photoirradiation with UV light. The (E,E)&#8208;2&#8208;pyridyl&#8208;diiminoguanidinium cation, synthesized as the triflate salt, binds sulfate with extraordinary strength in [D6]DMSO owing to its bidentate guanidinium hydrogen bonding, which can chelate the O&#8722;S&#8722;O edge of sulfate. Upon photoisomerization to the Z,Z isomer, the anion&#8208;binding site is essentially shut off by intramolecular hydrogen bonds to the 2&#8208;pyridyl substituents, as shown by anion&#8208;binding titrations, theoretical calculations, and X&#8208;ray structural analysis. This approach will allow the development of advanced anion&#8208;separation cycles that use only energy input and generate no chemical waste, and thus address challenging chemical separation problems in a more sustainable way.

         <title>A Self&#8208;Assembled Fmoc&#8208;Diphenylalanine Hydrogel&#8208;Encapsulated Pt Nanozyme as Oxidase&#8208; and Peroxidase&#8208;Like Breaking pH Limitation for Potential Antimicrobial Application</title>

Pt&#8208;Fmoc&#8208;FF hydrogel was found for the first time that it has both significantly enhanced oxidase&#8208;like (OXD&#8208;like) and peroxidase&#8208;like (POD&#8208;like) activities at neutral pH. The strategy of dissociating H+ from Fmoc&#8208;FF at neutral pH break pH limit and has a universal effect on nanomaterials with oxidase&#8208; or peroxidase&#8208;like over a wide pH range, this work accelerates the application of nanozymes in biological system.







Abstract
Nanomaterials with oxidase&#8208; and peroxidase&#8208;like activities have potential in antibacterial therapy. The optimal activity of most nanozymes occurred in acidic pH&#8197;(3.0&#8211;5.0), while the pH in biological systems is mostly near neutral. Herein, a general system using 9&#8208;fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl&#8208;modified diphenylalanine (Fmoc&#8208;FF) hydrogel for enhancing oxidase&#8208; and peroxidase&#8208;like activities of Pt NPs and other typical enzyme&#8208;like nanomaterials at neutral or even alkaline pH is proposed. In this system, Fmoc&#8208;FF hydrogel provides an acidic microenvironment for Pt NPs due to hydrogen protons (H+) produced by the dissociation of F at neutral pH. As a result, Pt NPs exhibits 6&#8208;fold enhanced oxidase&#8208;like and 26&#8208;fold peroxidase&#8208;like activity after being encapsulated into Fmoc&#8208;FF hydrogel at pH&#8197;7.0. Based on outstanding enzymatic activities and the antibacterial activity of Fmoc&#8208;FF hydrogel itself, Pt&#8208;Fmoc&#8208;FF hydrogel realizes excellent antibacterial effect. This design provides a universal strategy to break pH limitation of nanozymes and promotes the biological applications of nanozymes.

         <title>C(spn)&#8722;X (n=1&#8211;3) Bond Activation by Palladium</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 26, May 6, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Less is more! Our quantum chemical analyses reveal that the activity of palladium catalysts towards C&#8722;X bond activation increases along ethane, ethylene, acetylene because the steric repulsion between catalyst and substrate is relieved as the number of substituents around the carbon atom goes down.







Abstract
We have studied the palladium&#8208;mediated activation of C(spn)&#8722;X bonds (n = 1&#8211;3 and X = H, CH3, Cl) in archetypal model substrates H3C&#8722;CH2&#8722;X, H2C=CH&#8722;X and HC&#8801;C&#8722;X by catalysts PdLn with Ln = no ligand, Cl&#8722;, and (PH3)2, using relativistic density functional theory at ZORA&#8208;BLYP/TZ2P. The oxidative addition barrier decreases along this series, even though the strength of the bonds increases going from C(sp3)&#8722;X, to C(sp2)&#8722;X, to C(sp)&#8722;X. Activation strain and matching energy decomposition analyses reveal that the decreased oxidative addition barrier going from sp3, to sp2, to sp, originates from a reduction in the destabilizing steric (Pauli) repulsion between catalyst and substrate. This is the direct consequence of the decreasing coordination number of the carbon atom in C(spn)&#8722;X, which goes from four, to three, to two along this series. The associated net stabilization of the catalyst&#8211;substrate interaction dominates the trend in strain energy which indeed becomes more destabilizing along this same series as the bond becomes stronger from C(sp3)&#8722;X to C(sp)&#8722;X.

         <title>Type S Non&#8208;Ribosomal Peptide Synthetases for the Rapid Generation of Tailormade Peptide Libraries**
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 26, May 6, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Following a previously published proof&#8208;of&#8208;principle study on generating bipartite type S non&#8208;ribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs), the de novo generation of non&#8208;ribosomal peptide libraries with unprecedented simplicity was envisaged. By using synthetic zippers, NRPSs were split in up to three subunits to produce 49 peptides at titres up to 145&#8197;mg&#8201;L&#8722;1.







Abstract
Bacterial natural products in general, and non&#8208;ribosomally synthesized peptides in particular, are structurally diverse and provide us with a broad range of pharmaceutically relevant bioactivities. Yet, traditional natural product research suffers from rediscovering the same scaffolds and has been stigmatized as inefficient, time&#8208;, labour&#8208; and cost&#8208;intensive. Combinatorial chemistry, on the other hand, can produce new molecules in greater numbers, cheaper and in less time than traditional natural product discovery, but also fails to meet current medical needs due to the limited biologically relevant chemical space that can be addressed. Consequently, methods for the high throughput generation of new natural products would offer a new approach to identifying novel bioactive chemical entities for the hit to lead phase of drug discovery programs. As a follow&#8208;up to our previously published proof&#8208;of&#8208;principle study on generating bipartite type S non&#8208;ribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs), we now envisaged the de novo generation of non&#8208;ribosomal peptides (NRPs) on an unreached scale. Using synthetic zippers, we split NRPSs in up to three subunits and rapidly generated different bi&#8208; and tripartite NRPS libraries to produce 49 peptides, peptide derivatives, and de novo peptides at good titres up to 145&#8197;mg&#8201;L&#8722;1. A further advantage of type S NRPSs not only is the possibility to easily expand the created libraries by re&#8208;using previously created type S NRPS, but that functions of individual domains as well as domain&#8208;domain interactions can be studied and assigned rapidly.

         <title>Single Crystals of Mixed&#8208;Cation Copper&#8208;Based Perovskite with Trimodal Bandgap Behavior</title>

Easily exfoliated, two dimensional mixed&#8208;cation Cu&#8208;perovskite single crystals reveal three different diffraction patterns with trimodal bandgap behavior. Cation engineering has the potential to increase photovoltaic performance of Cu&#8208;perovskites.







Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) hybrid perovskites with novel functionalities and structural diversity are a perfect platform for emerging optoelectronic devices such as photodetectors, light&#8208;emitting diodes, and solar cells. Here, we demonstrate that excess concentration of Cesium bromide (CsBr) is key to the formation of easily exfoliated 2D Cs2Cu(Cl/Br)4 perovskite crystal. Furthermore, by employing this trick to 2D perovskite MA2Cu(Cl/Br)4 (MA=methylammonium), we achieve a phase&#8208;pure easily exfoliated 2D mixed&#8208;cation (MA/Cs)2Cu(Cl/Br)4 perovskite crystal, which exhibits reduced bandgap (1.53&#8197;eV) with ferromagnetic behavior and photovoltaic property. The resultant mixed&#8208;cation structured device reveals enhanced efficiency compared to all MA and all Cs counterparts. These findings demonstrate the importance of cation&#8208;engineering in developing innovative materials with novel properties.

         <title>Front Cover: A Photoresponsive Receptor with a 105 Magnitude of Reversible Anion&#8208;Binding Switching (Chem. Eur. J. 26/2022)</title>

A new photoswitchable chromophore, the diiminoguanidinium group can be used as the base for an anion receptor based. Like the yin&#8208;yang (dark&#8211;light) relationship between the Moon and the Sun, the E,E and Z,Z photoisomers of the 2&#8208;pyridyl&#8208;diiminoguanidinium receptor have opposite binding behaviors towards sulfate, a representative oxyanion. The open E,E form binds sulfate with extraordinary strength in the dark, through chelating guanidinium hydrogen bonds. Upon photoisomerization to the Z,Z isomer, the anion&#8208;binding site is shut off, thereby ejecting the bound sulfate anion. More information can be found in the Research Article by B.&#8197;A. Moyer, R. Custelcean and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202200719).

The synthesis of ketone as a synthetic intermediate of canagliflozin from a gluconolactone&#8208;derived thioester and a Grignard reagent with the aid of copper is likened to making Taiyaki, a Japanese fish&#8208;shaped waffle with sweet red bean inside. The thioester (sweet red beans) and the Grignard reagent (waffle batter) are baked on a copper waffle iron to get the desired ketone as Taiyaki.

         <dc:description>
Hedycaryol is a strained 10&#8208;membered monocyclic sesquiterpene alcohol whose chemistry is characterised by its transannular acid&#8208;catalysed and thermal (Cope) reactions. The compound is widespread in Nature and serves as an important biosynthetic intermediate towards many other sesquiterpene alcohols including eudesmols, guaiols and rearranged compounds. This review summarises the known natural products derived through terpene cyclisations from hedycaryol. For each compound, if it has been assigned experimentally, the rationale for its absolute configuration is discussed.

This review discusses the unique chemistry of hedycaryol, its occurrence in Nature and all known compounds derived from it by terpene cyclisations. Structure elucidations including structural revisions and reasoning for the assignment of absolute configurations of the discussed compounds are presented.







Abstract
The known sesquiterpenes that arise biosynthetically from hedycaryol are summarised. Reasonings for the assignments of their absolute configurations are discussed. The analysis provided here suggests that reprotonations at the C1=C10 double bond of hedycaryol are directed toward C1 and generally lead to 6&#8211;6 bicyclic compounds, while reprotonations at the C4=C5 double bond occur at C4 and result in 5&#8211;7 bicyclic compounds. Read more in the Review by H. Xu and J. S. Dickschat (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202200405).

         <title>Mapping Catalyst&#8208;Solvent Interplay in Competing Carboamination/Cyclopropanation Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Group 9 metals, in particular Rh  III  complexes with cyclopentadienyl ligands, are competent C&#8211;H activation catalysts. Recently, a Cp*Rh  III  catalyzed reaction of alkenes with  N  &#8208;enoxyphthalimides showed divergent outcome based on the solvent, with carboamination favored in methanol and cyclopropanation in 2,2,2&#8208;trifluoroethanol (TFE). Here, we create selectivity and activity maps capable of unravelling the catalyst&#8208;solvent interplay on the outcome of these competing reactions by analyzing 42 cyclopentadienyl metal catalysts, Cp  X  M  III  (M = Co, Rh, Ir). These maps not only can be used to rationalize previously reported experimental results, but also capably predict the behavior of untested catalyst/solvent combinations as well as aid in identifying experimental protocols that simultaneously optimize both catalytic activity and selectivity (solutions in the Pareto front). In this regard, we demonstrate how and why the experimentally employed Cp*Rh  III  catalyst represents an ideal choice to invoke a solvent&#8208;induced change in reactivity. Additionally, the maps reveal the degree to which even perceived minor changes in the solvent (  e.g.  , replacing methanol with ethanol) influence the ratio of carboamination and cyclopropanation products. Overall, the selectivity and activity maps presented here provide a generalizable tool to create global pictures of anticipated reaction outcome that can be used to develop new experimental protocols spanning metal, ligand, and solvent space.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Luminescent organic&#8208;inorganic metal halides (OIMHs) are well known as a new materials family in recent years. Novel materials and applications of luminescent OIMHs have been explored by changing either the organic component or the metal halide species. Thereinto, the stimuli&#8208;responsive (SR) phenomena in OIMHs have drawn much attention recently, for not only their attractive application potential but also the helpfulness in understanding the stability of OIMHs to the external environment. Herein, the luminescent OIMHs that are sensitive to external stimuli including contact, pressure, mechanical grinding, light, heat, and gas molecules, are reviewed, with an emphasis on analyses of the structural change during the SR process. The applications of SR luminescent OIMHs in widespread fields, including gas sensing, information encryption, and rewritable luminescent paper are summarized. Finally, the challenges that deserve to be further explored in this research field are discussed, which provides certain guidance for the future study of SR luminescent OIMHs.</dc:description>

         <title>Recent progress of small&#8208;molecule ratiometric fluorescent probes for peroxynitrite in biological systems</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Peroxynitrite (ONOO&#8208;) as a major reactive oxygen species plays important roles in cellular signal transduction and homeostatic regulation. Precise detection of ONOO&#8208; in biological systems is vital for exploring its physiological and pathological function. Among numerous detection methods, fluorescence imaging technology using fluorescent probe offers some advantages, including simple operation, high sensitivity and selectivity, real&#8208;time and non&#8208;destructive detection. In particular, ratiometric fluorescent probes, in which the built&#8208;in calibration of the two emission bands prevents interference from the biological environment, have been extensively employed to monitor the fluctuation of bioactive species. In this review, we will discuss the small&#8208;molecule ratiometric fluorescent probes for ONOO&#8208; in live cells or in vivo, which involves the chemical structures, response mechanism and biological applications. Moreover, the challenges and future prospects of ONOO&#8208; responsive ratiometric fluorescent probe are also proposed.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>As the 21  st  century unfolds with rapid changes, new challenges in research and development emerge. These new challenges prompted us to repurpose our HPLC&#8208;A platform that was previously used in solid phase glycan synthesis to a solution phase batch synthesis described herein. The modular character of HPLC allows for implementing new attachments. To enable sequential synthesis of multiple oligosaccharides with the single press of a button, we supplemented our system with a four&#8208;way split valve and an automated fraction collector. This enabled the operator to load all reagents and all reactants in the autosampler, press the button to start the repetitive automation sequence, leave the lab, and upon return find products of multiple reactions ready for purification, analysis, and subsequent application</dc:description>

         <title>The Unexpected Helical Supramolecular Assembly of a Simple Achiral Acetamide Tecton Generates Selective Water Channels</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Water wire transfer: A simple achiral hydrated acetamide self&#8208;organizes into a chiral channel with highly mobile water molecules. The crystalline architecture displays breathing behavior near room temperature with fully reversible release and re&#8208;uptake of water molecules. The water transport is very efficient compared to that with previously reported artificial water channels and has a very good selectivity against NaCl; it could therefore be an efficient candidate for desalination processes.







Abstract
Achiral 2&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;N&#8208;(diphenylmethyl)acetamide (HNDPA) crystallizes in the P61 chiral space group as a hydrate, building up permeable chiral crystalline helical water channels.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Water wire transfer&lt;/b&gt;: A simple achiral hydrated acetamide self-organizes into a chiral channel with highly mobile water molecules. The crystalline architecture displays breathing behavior near room temperature with fully reversible release and re-uptake of water molecules. The water transport is very efficient compared to that with previously reported artificial water channels and has a very good selectivity against NaCl; it could therefore be an efficient candidate for desalination processes.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Achiral 2-hydroxy-&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-(diphenylmethyl)acetamide (HNDPA) crystallizes in the &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;6&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; chiral space group as a hydrate, building up permeable chiral crystalline helical water channels. The crystallization-driven chiral self-resolution process is highly robust, with the same air-stable crystalline form readily obtained under a variety of conditions. Interestingly, the HNDPA supramolecular helix inner pore is filled by a helical water wire. The whole edifice is mainly stabilized by robust hydrogen bonds involving the HNDPA amide bonds and CH&lt;sup&gt;&#8230;&lt;/sup&gt;&#960; interactions between the HNDPA phenyl groups. The crystalline structure shows breathing behavior, with completely reversible release and re-uptake of water inside the chiral channel under ambient conditions. Importantly, the HNDPA channel is able to transport water very efficiently and selectively under biomimetic conditions. With a permeability per channel of 3.3 million water molecules per second in large unilamellar vesicles (LUV) and total selectivity against NaCl, the HNDPA channel is a very promising functional nanomaterial for future applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Enantioselective Cytotoxicity of Chiral Diphosphine Ruthenium(II) Complexes Against Cancer Cells</title>

         <dc:description>
The chiral cationic diphosphine ruthenium(II) complexes [RuX(CO)(PP)(phen)]Y (X, Y=carboxylates, thioacetate, PP=(R,R)&#8208; or (S,S)&#8208;Skewphos), isolated as single stereoisomers, inhibit cancer cell proliferation and colonization with EC50 values ranging from 2.8 to 0.04&#8197;&#956;M, the (R,R)&#8208;enantiomers being up to 14 times more active than the (S,S) ones. In water, the (S)&#8208;cysteine and GSH adducts are easily formed from the carboxylate derivatives via aquo complexes.







Abstract
The chiral cationic complex [Ru(&#951;1&#8208;OAc)(CO)((R,R)&#8208;Skewphos)(phen)]OAc (2R), isolated from reaction of [Ru(&#951;1&#8208;OAc)(&#951;2&#8208;OAc)(R,R)&#8208;Skewphos)(CO)] (1R) with phen, reacts with NaOPiv and KSAc affording [RuX(CO)((R,R)&#8208;Skewphos)(phen)]Y (X=Y=OPiv 3R; X=SAc, Y=OAc 4R). The corresponding enantiomers 2S&#8208;4S have been obtained from 1S containing (S,S)&#8208;Skewphos. Reaction of 2R and 2S with (S)&#8208;cysteine and NaPF6 at pH=9 gives the diastereoisomers [Ru((S)&#8208;Cys)(CO)(PP)(phen)]PF6 (PP=(R,R)&#8208;Skewphos 2R&#8208;Cys; (S,S)&#8208;Skewphos 2S&#8208;Cys). The DFT energetic profile for 2R with (S)&#8208;cysteine in H2O indicates that aquo and hydroxo species are involved in formation of 2R&#8208;Cys. The stability of the ruthenium complexes in 0.9&#8201;% w/v NaCl solution, PBS and complete DMEM medium, as well as their n&#8208;octanol/water partition coefficient (logP), have been evaluated. The chiral complexes show high cytotoxic activity against SW1736, 8505&#8197;C, HCT&#8208;116 and A549&#8197;cell lines with EC50 values of 2.8&#8211;0.04&#8197;&#956;M. The (R,R)&#8208;Skewphos derivatives show higher cytotoxicity compared to their enantiomers, 4R (EC50=0.04&#8197;&#956;M) being 14 times more cytotoxic than 4S against the anaplastic thyroid cancer 8505&#8197;C cell line.

         <title>Cation&#8208;&#960; Interactions between a Noble Metal and a Polyfunctional Aromatic Ligand: Ag+(benzylamine)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
IR multiple photon dissociation spectroscopy unveils the structure of the Ag+(benzylamine) complex (Ag+(BA)), presenting a N&#8208;Ag+&#8208;&#960; chelate coordination involving both the amino nitrogen and the phenyl &#960;&#8208;system. The gas&#8208;phase reactivity of Ag+(BA) with neutral molecular ligands (L) confirms N&#8208; and &#960;&#8208;binding affinity and indicates an augmented silver coordination in the Ag+(BA)(L) adduct.







Abstract
The structure of an isolated Ag+(benzylamine) complex is investigated by infrared multiple photon dissociation (IRMPD) spectroscopy complemented with quantum chemical calculations of candidate geometries and their vibrational spectra, aiming to ascertain the role of competing cation&#8208;N and cation&#8208;&#960; interactions potentially offered by the polyfunctional ligand. The IRMPD spectrum has been recorded in the 800&#8211;1800&#8197;cm&#8722;1 fingerprint range using the IR free electron laser beamline coupled with an FT&#8208;ICR mass spectrometer at the Centre Laser Infrarouge d'Orsay (CLIO). The resulting IRMPD pattern points toward a chelate coordination (N&#8208;Ag+&#8208;&#960;) involving both the amino nitrogen atom and the aromatic &#960;&#8208;system of the phenyl ring. The gas&#8208;phase reactivity of Ag+(benzylamine) with a neutral molecular ligand (L) possessing either an amino/aza functionality or an aryl group confirms N&#8208; and &#960;&#8208;binding affinity and suggests an augmented silver coordination in the product adduct ion

         <title>Remote Effect from Boron Cluster: Tunable Photophysical Properties of o&#8208;Carborane&#8208;Based Luminogens</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new molecular design strategy that attaches the o&#8208;carborane group to the remote side of luminogens was proposed. The remote effect from the o&#8208;carboranyl unit on the end of luminogens could significantly modulate the photophysical properties in both solution and the solid state. The carborane&#8208;substituted luminogens show lower luminescence efficiency in solution and longer emission wavelength in the solid state in contrast to those of model compounds.







Abstract
We proposed a new molecular design strategy that the o&#8208;carboranyl group is attached as &#8220;an innocent unit&#8221; to the remote side of luminogens to tune photophysical properties. To verify this strategy, two o&#8208;carborane&#8208;based compounds with asymmetric molecular geometry were designed and synthesized. Photophysical properties of o&#8208;carborane&#8208;based luminogens were investigated on the basis of UV&#8208;Vis spectra, photoluminescence spectra, crystal structure analysis and theoretical calculations. The results indicate that the o&#8208;carboranyl group has a slight effect on the energy gap between the ground state (S0) and the first excited state (S1) in the solution state but a significant effect on the energy gap between S0 and S1 in the solid state. Besides, the radiative and non&#8208;radiative transition processes are modulated by the o&#8208;carboranyl unit. This leads to emission quenching in the solution state but an enhanced luminous efficiency in the aggregate state with a typical aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) property.

&lt;p&gt;We proposed a new molecular design strategy that the &lt;i&gt;o&lt;/i&gt;-carboranyl group is attached as &#8220;an innocent unit&#8221; to the remote side of luminogens to tune photophysical properties. To verify this strategy, two &lt;i&gt;o&lt;/i&gt;-carborane-based compounds with asymmetric molecular geometry were designed and synthesized. Photophysical properties of &lt;i&gt;o&lt;/i&gt;-carborane-based luminogens were investigated on the basis of UV-Vis spectra, photoluminescence spectra, crystal structure analysis and theoretical calculations. The results indicate that the &lt;i&gt;o&lt;/i&gt;-carboranyl group has a slight effect on the energy gap between the ground state (S&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;) and the first excited state (S&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) in the solution state but a significant effect on the energy gap between S&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; and S&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; in the solid state. Besides, the radiative and non-radiative transition processes are modulated by the &lt;i&gt;o&lt;/i&gt;-carboranyl unit. This leads to emission quenching in the solution state but an enhanced luminous efficiency in the aggregate state with a typical aggregation-induced emission (AIE) property.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A&#160;porous sulfonated 2D zirconium metal&#8208;organic framework as a robust platform for proton conduction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Using the strategy of pre&#8208;assembly chlorosulfonation applied to a linker precursor, the first&#160;sulfonated zirconium metal&#8208;organic framework (JUK&#8208;14) with two&#8208;dimensional (2D) structure, was synthesized. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction reveals that the material is built of Zr  6  O  4  (OH)  4  (COO)  8  oxoclusters, doubly 4&#8208;connected by angular dicarboxylates, and stacked in layers spaced 1.5 nm apart by the presence of sulfonic groups. JUK&#8208;14 exhibits excellent hydrothermal stability, permanent porosity confirmed by gas adsorption studies, and shows high (&gt;10  &#8208;4  S/cm) and low (&lt;10  &#8208;8  S/cm) proton conductivity under humidified and anhydrous conditions, respectively. Post&#8208;synthesis inclusion of imidazole improves the overall conductivity increasing it to 1.7&#215;10  &#8208;3  S/cm at 60  o  C and 90% relative humidity, and by 3 orders of magnitude at 160  o  C. The combination of 2D porous nature with robustness of zirconium MOFs offers new opportunities for exploration of the material towards energy and environmental applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrochemistry and Reactivity of Chelation&#8208;stabilized Hypervalent Bromine(III) Compounds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hypervalent bromine(III) reagents possess a higher electrophilicity and a stronger oxidizing power compared to their iodine(III) counterparts. Despite the superior reactivity, bromine(III) reagents have a reputation of hard&#8208;to&#8208;control and difficult&#8208;to&#8208;synthesize compounds. This is partly due to their low stability, and partly because their synthesis typically relies on the use of the toxic and highly reactive BrF  3  as a precursor. Recently, we proposed chelation&#8208;stabilized hypervalent bromine(III) compounds as a possible solution to both problems. First, they can be conveniently prepared by electro&#8208;oxidation of the corresponding bromoarenes. Second, the chelation endows bromine(III) species with increased stability while retaining sufficient reactivity, comparable to that of iodine(III) counterparts. Finally, their intrinsic reactivity can be unlocked in the presence of acids. Herein, an in&#8208;depth mechanistic study of both the electrochemical generation and the reactivity of the bromine(III) compounds is disclosed, with implications for known applications and future developments in the field.</dc:description>

         <title>Modulated Synthesis of Self&#8208;Standing Covalent Organic Framework Films</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The weak interaction of covalent organic framework (COF) nanoparticles makes the preparation of self&#8208;standing COF &#64257;lms difficult. Herein, we report a modulated strategy for the facile synthesis of self&#8208;standing COF films with good crystallinity and tunable thickness. As compared with the non&#8208;modulated approach, the modulated strategy changes the COF morphology from nanoparticles to nanofibers, enabling the facile preparation of self&#8208;standing COF films with improved mechanical properties. The Young's modulus of the self&#8208;standing COF film obtained via the modulated strategy could increase by 26 times. Moreover, self&#8208;standing LZU&#8208;8 film can be used as a membrane for efficient removal of 99% mercury ions from aqueous solution. Our results open up a new approach to prepare self&#8208;standing COF thin &#64257;lms for practical applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Driving the active site incorporation in zeolitic materials via the organic structure&#8208;directing agent through development of H&#8208;bonds with hydroxyl groups</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this work we use (1  S  ,2  S  )&#8208;N&#8208;methyl&#8208;pseudoephedrine (MPS) as organic structure&#8208;directing agent (OSDA) for the synthesis of Mg&#8208;doped nanoporous aluminophosphates. This molecule displays a particular conformational behavior, where the presence of H&#8208;bond donor and acceptor groups provide a rigid conformational space with one asymmetric conformation preferentially occurring. MPS drives the crystallization of Mg&#8208;containing AFI materials. Characterization of these materials shows that the OSDA incorporate as protonated species, arranged as head&#8208;to&#8208;tail monomers. Combination of three&#8208;dimensional electron diffraction with high&#8208;resolution synchrotron powder X&#8208;ray diffraction allowed to locate both the Mg and the organic species. Interestingly, results showed that the spatial incorporation of Mg is driven by the hydroxyl groups of the organic cation through the development of H&#8208;bonds with negatively&#8208;charged MgO  4  tetrahedra. Thus, our work demonstrates that H&#8208;bond forming groups can be used to drive the spatial incorporation of low&#8208;valent dopants within zeolitic frameworks, a highly desired aim in order to control their catalytic activity and selectivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Neutron diffraction study of indole solvation in deep eutectic systems of choline chloride, malic acid, and water</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Deep eutectic systems are currently under intense investigation to replace traditional organic solvents in a range of syntheses. Here, indole in choline chloride&#8208;malic acid deep eutectic solvent (DES) was studied as a function of water content, to identify solute interactions with the DES which affect heterocycle reactivity and selectivity, and as a proxy for biomolecule solvation. Empirical Potential Structure Refinement models of neutron diffraction data showed [Cholinium]  +  cations associate strongly with the indole &#960;&#8208;system due to electrostatics, whereas malic acid is only weakly associated. Trace water is sequestered into the DES, and does not interact strongly with indole. When water is added to the DES, it does not interact with the indole &#960;&#8208;system but is exclusively in&#8208;plane with the heterocyclic rings, forming strong H&#8208;bonds with the &#8208;NH group, and also weak H&#8208;bonds and thus prominent hydrophobic hydration of the indole aromatic region, which could direct selectivity in reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Borylation of Acyl Chlorides with an Alkoxy Diboron Reagent: A Facile Route to Acylboron Compounds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report herein the copper&#8208;catalyzed borylation of readily available acyl chlorides with bis(pinacolato)diboron (B2pin2) or bis(neopentane glycolato)diboron (B2neop2) which provides stable potassium acyltrifluoroborates (KATs) in good yields from the acylboronate esters. A variety of functional groups are tolerated under the mild reaction conditions (room temperature) and substrates containing different carbon&#8208;skeletons, such as aryl, heteroaryl and primary, secondary, tertiary alkyl are applicable. Acyl N&#8208;methyliminodiacetic acid (MIDA) boronates can also been accessed by modification of the workup procedures. This process is scalable and also amenable to the late&#8208;stage conversion of carboxylic acid&#8208;containing drugs into their acylboron analogues, which have been challenging to prepare previously. A catalytic mechanism is proposed based on in situ monitoring of the reaction between p&#8208;toluoyl chloride and an NHC&#8208;copper(I) boryl complex as well as the isolation of an unusual lithium acylBpinOBpin compound&#160;as a key intermediate.</dc:description>

A variety of functional groups are tolerated under the mild reaction conditions (room temperature) and substrates containing different carbon-skeletons, such as aryl, heteroaryl and primary, secondary, tertiary alkyl are applicable. Acyl N-methyliminodiacetic acid (MIDA) boronates can also been accessed by modification of the workup procedures. This process is scalable and also amenable to the late-stage conversion of carboxylic acid-containing drugs into their acylboron analogues, which have been challenging to prepare previously. A catalytic mechanism is proposed based on in situ monitoring of the reaction between p-toluoyl chloride and an NHC-copper(I) boryl complex as well as the isolation of an unusual lithium acylBpinOBpin compound&#160;as a key intermediate.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <dc:description>The reactivity of ferrocene&#8208;based N&#8208;heterocyclic tetrylenes [{Fe(&#951;  5  &#8208;C  5  H  4  &#8208;NSi  t  BuMe  2  )  2  }E] (E = Ge, Sn, Pb) towards mesityl azide (MesN  3  ) is compared with that of PPh  2  &#8208;functionalised congeners exhibiting two possible reactions sites, viz. the E  II  and P  III  atom.

         <title>Chlorine substituted N&#8208;heteroacene analogues acting as organic semiconductors for solution&#8208;processed n&#8208;type organic field&#8208;effect transistors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>High performance solution processable n&#8208;type organic semiconductor is an essential element to realize low&#8208;cost, all organic and flexible composite logic circuits. In the design of n&#8208;type semiconducting materials, tuning the LUMO level of compounds is a key point. As a strong electron withdrawing unit, the introduction of chlorine atom into the chemical structure can increase the electron affinity of the material and reduce the LUMO energy level. Here, a series chlorine substituted N&#8208;heteroacene analogues of 6,7,8,9&#8208;tetrachloro&#8208;4,11&#8208;bis(4&#8208;((2&#8208;ethylhexyl)oxy)phenyl)&#8208;[1,2,5]thiadiazolo[3,4&#8208;b]phenazine (O4Cl), 6,7,8,9&#8208;tetrachloro&#8208;4,11&#8208;bis(4&#8208;((2&#8208;ethylhexyl)thio)phenyl)&#8208;[1,2,5]thiadiazolo[3,4&#8208;b]phenazine (S4Cl), 1,2,3,4,8,9,10,11&#8208;octachloro&#8208;6,13&#8208;bis(4&#8208;((2&#8208;ethylhexyl)oxy)phenyl)quinoxalino[2,3&#8208;b]phenazine (8Cl) and 12Cl have been synthesized and characterized. Solution&#8208;processed organic field&#8208;effect transistors (OFETs) based on these four compounds exhibit good electron mobilities of 0.04 cm  2  V  &#8208;1  s  &#8208;1  , 0.01 cm  2  V  &#8208;1  s  &#8208;1  , 2 &#215; 10  &#8208;3  cm  2  V  &#8208;1  s  &#8208;1  and 3 &#215; 10  &#8208;3  cm  2  V  &#8208;1  s  &#8208;1  , respectively, under ambient conditions. The results suggest that these chlorine substituted &#960;&#8208;conjugated N&#8208;heteroacene analogues are promising n&#8208;type semiconductors in OFET applications.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A catalytic enantioselective amination of  &#946;  &#8208;keto esters using (  S  )&#8208;BINOL chiral calcium phosphate has been developed. The reaction produces chiral  &#945;  &#8208;amino&#8208;  &#946;  &#8208;keto ester derivatives in most cases with moderate to excellent enantioselectivities (up to 99%) and good yields (up to 99%). This mild synthetic method highlights a low catalyst loading and high catalytic efficiency. When the substrate backbone was changed to 1&#8208;tetralone&#8208;derived  &#946;  &#8208;keto esters, unexpectedly high yields of selective redox products were obtained. The practicality of the reaction was realized by a scale up without any significant loss in the enantioselectivity and yield. Chiral calcium phosphate was successfully recovered and reused for four runs, indicating its stability and high catalytic activity.</dc:description>

         <title>Enantioselective Organophotocatalytic Telescoped Synthesis of a Chiral Privileged Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient in&#8208;flow catalytic enantioselective organophotoredox alkylation of aldehydes has been successfully developed (up to 98&#8201;% e.e.) and applied to the fully telescoped synthesis of a chiral active pharmaceutical ingredient (API), consisting of four units of operation: in&#8208;flow asymmetric benzylation, inline continuous work&#8208;up, neutralisation and oxidative amidation. By using flow technologies, the productivity was increased by almost 200 times compared to the batch reaction.







Abstract
The continuous flow, enantioselective, organophotoredox catalytic asymmetric alkylation of aldehydes was studied, by using a homemade, custom&#8208;designed photoreactor for reactions under cryogenic conditions. Going from microfluidic conditions up to a 10&#8197;mL mesofluidic reactor, an increase of productivity by almost 18000&#8201;% compared to the batch reaction was demonstrated. Finally, for the first time, a stereoselective photoredox organocatalytic continuous flow reaction in a fully telescoped process for an active pharmaceutical ingredient (API)synthesis was successfully achieved. The final process consists of four units of operation: visible light&#8208;driven asymmetric catalytic benzylation under continuous flow, inline continuous work&#8208;up, neutralisation and a final oxidative amidation step afforded the pharmaceutically active molecule in 95&#8201;% e.e.

         <title>Four&#8208;Component Ugi Reaction for Optical Chirality Sensing and Surface Nanoengineering of Chiral Self&#8208;Assemblies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The four&#8208;component Ugi reaction was successfully utilized in the optical ee% sensing of chiral amines. An intramolecular folded structure was employed to boost the CD signal. Optical sensing of amines was applicable in a general and precise manner to a variety of substrates, from synthetic to natural amines. In aqueous media, conjugation of amine&#8208;bearing dyes enables fluorescent visualization yet without changing the pristine morphology, providing a promising strategy for surface engineering of soft assemblies.







Abstract
Using green chemistry to control chirality at hierarchical levels as well as chiroptical activities endows with new opportunities to the development of multiple functions. Here, the four&#8208;component Ugi reaction is introduced for the general and precise optical chirality sensing of amines as well as the surface nanoengineering of chiral soft self&#8208;assemblies. To overcome the relatively weak Cotton effects, direct synthesis of a folded peptide structure on a rotatable ferrocene core with axial chirality was accomplished from chiral amine, 1,1&#8217;&#8208;ferrocenyl dicarboxylic acid, formaldehyde and isocyanide. Enhanced Cotton effects benefiting from the folded structure allow for the precise and quantitative sensing of natural and synthetic chiral amines covering alkyl, aromatic amines and amino acid derivatives. In addition, aqueous reaction enables the modification of amine&#8208;bearing dye to microfibers self&#8208;assembled from &#960;&#8208;conjugated amino acids. Surface dye&#8208;modification via Ugi reaction barely changes the pristine morphology, showing non&#8208;invasive properties in contrast to dye staining, which is applicable in soft nano/microarchitectures from self&#8208;assembly. This work which combines the four&#8208;component Ugi reaction to enable precise ee% detection and surface nanoengineering of soft chiral assemblies sheds light on the advanced application of green chemistry to chirality science.

         <title>Direct In Situ Vertical Growth of Interlaced Mesoporous NiO Nanosheets on Carbon Felt for Electrocatalytic Ammonia Synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel interlaced mesoporous NiO NSs@CF electrochemical catalyst was prepared using a direct in&#8197;situ vertical growth method, in which NiO formed mesoporous nanosheets with a pore size of 15&#8197;nm and a thickness of &#8764;30&#8197;nm. This binder&#8208;free electrode exhibited a superior NH3 yield of 71.3&#8197;&#956;g&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8197;mg&#8722;1cat. and a FE of 17.9&#8201;% at &#8722;0.5&#8197;V vs. RHE.







Abstract
Metal oxide nanomaterials directly grown on conductive substrates are optimal electrode materials because their structures allow for rapid ion and electron transport and thereby reduce internal resistance in the electrode. The development of such binder&#8208;free, self&#8208;supporting electrodes is of great significance for applications in electrocatalysis. In this work, a simple hydrothermal in&#8197;situ self&#8208;assembly reaction and annealing process was developed to prepare three kinds of nickel oxide @ carbon felt (NiO@CF) nanocomposites with different morphologies. The influence of different precipitators (strong or weak bases) on the morphology of the resulting nano&#8208;sized nickel oxide nanocomposites was investigated. The microstructures of the NiO@CF samples were characterized with field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD), and X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). When ammonia was used as the precipitator, NiO grew vertically on the surface of the carbon felt and formed a mesoporous nanosheet&#8208;like structure (NiO NSs@CF). As an electrocatalytic nitrogen reduction reaction (e&#8208;NRR) electrode, the NiO NSs@CF sample showed an excellent NH3 yield (71.3&#8197;&#956;g&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8197;mg&#8722;1cat.) and Faradaic efficiency (17.9&#8201;% at &#8722;0.5&#8197;V vs. RHE) in 0.1&#8197;M Na2SO4. The good performance was attributed to the vertical interleaved mesoporous sheet&#8208;like structure (with the pore size of 15&#8197;nm and the thickness of &#8764;30&#8197;nm) and the relatively high concentration of oxygen vacancies. First&#8208;principles calculations with strong on&#8208;site Coulomb interactions demonstrated that the presence of oxygen vacancy on NiO sample leads to a significantly stronger N binding over the surface, benefiting for the nitrogen gas adsorption and reduction. The e&#8208;NRR performance of this binder&#8208;free, flexible electrode material is superior to that of other reported nickel&#8208;based nanomaterials. This study highlights the potential of such binder&#8208;free carbon felt electrodes for use in e&#8208;NRR that could meet the needs of industrial production.

         <title>An Orthogonal Dynamic Covalent Chemistry Tool for Ring&#8208;Opening Polymerization of Cyclic Oligochalcogenides on Detachable Helical Peptide Templates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recyclable with orthogonal dynamic covalent semicarbazone chemistry, 310 helical peptide templates are introduced as a general chemistry tool to enable and tame unfavorable ring&#8208;opening polymerizations by dynamic covalent disulfide and diselenide exchange cascades.







Abstract
A model system is introduced as a general tool to elaborate on orthogonal templation of dynamic covalent ring&#8208;opening polymerization (ODC&#8208;TROP). The tool consists of 310 helical peptides as unprecedented templates and semicarbazones as orthogonal dynamic covalent linkers. With difficult&#8208;to&#8208;control 1,2&#8208;dithiolanes, ODC&#8208;TROP on the level of short model oligomers occurs with high templation efficiency, increasing and diminishing upon helix stabilization and denaturation, respectively. Further, an anti&#8208;templated conjugate with mispositioned monomers gave reduced templation upon helix twisting. Even with the &#8220;unpolymerizable&#8221; 1,2&#8208;diselenolanes, initial studies already afford mild templation efficiency. These proof&#8208;of&#8208;principle results promise that the here introduced tool, recyclable and enabling late&#8208;stage side chain modification, will be useful to realize ODC&#8208;TROP of intractable or unknown cyclic dynamic covalent monomers for dynamer materials as well as cellular uptake and signaling applications.

         <title>Development of a Fully Continuous&#8208;Flow Approach Towards Asymmetric Total Synthesis of Tetrahydroprotoberberine Natural Alkaloids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fully continuous flow approach towards asymmetric total synthesis of four natural tetrahydroprotoberberine alkaloids, was developed through a concise linear sequence involving four chemical transformations and three on&#8208;line work&#8208;up processes without any intermediate purification. The overall yields and enantioselectivities obtained in this novel integrated flow platform were up to 50&#8201;% and 92&#8201;%ee, respectively, in a total residence time of 32.5&#8197;min.







Abstract
Continuous flow synthetic technologies had been widely applied in the total synthesis in the past few decades. Fully continuous flow synthesis is still extremely focused on multi&#8208;step synthesis of complex natural pharmaceutical molecules. Thus, the development of fully continuous flow total synthesis of natural products is in demand but challenging. Herein, we demonstrated the first fully continuous flow approach towards asymmetric total synthesis of natural tetrahydroprotoberberine alkaloids, (&#8722;)&#8208;isocanadine, (&#8722;)&#8208;tetrahydropseudocoptisine, (&#8722;)&#8208;stylopine and (&#8722;)&#8208;nandinine. This method features a concise linear sequence involving four chemical transformations and three on&#8208;line work&#8208;up processing in an integrated flow platform, without any intermediate purification. The overall yield and enantioselectivity of this four&#8208;step continuous flow chemistry were up to 50&#8201;% and 92&#8201;%ee, respectively, in a total residence time of 32.5&#8197;min, corresponding to a throughput of 145&#8197;mg/h.

         <dc:description>
S&#8722;F bond activation: Treatment of the xantphos&#8208;type rhodium complex [Rh(Me)(tBuxanPOP)] with SF4 gave the &#955;4&#8208;trifluorosulfanyl complex [Rh(Me)(SF3)(tBuxanPOP)][SF5]. Its molecular structure in the solid state reveals a Rh&#8722;F interaction of the SF3 ligand with the metal center. Further reactions with Lewis acids and chlorine sources have been investigated.







Abstract
S&#8722;F&#8208;bond activation of sulfur tetrafluoride at [Rh(Cl)(tBuxanPOP)] (1; tBuxanPOP=9,9&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;4,5&#8208;bis&#8208;(di&#8208;tert&#8208;butylphosphino)&#8208;xanthene) led to the formation of the cationic complex [Rh(F)(Cl)(SF2)(tBuxanPOP)][SF5] (2&#8201;a) together with trans&#8208;[Rh(Cl)(F)2(tBuxanPOP)] (3) and cis&#8208;[Rh(Cl)2(F)(tBuxanPOP)] (4) which both could also be obtained by the reaction of SF5Cl with 1. In contrast to that, the conversion of SF4 at the methyl complex [Rh(Me)(tBuxanPOP)] (5) gave the isolable and room&#8208;temperature stable cationic &#955;4&#8208;trifluorosulfanyl complex [Rh(Me)(SF3)(tBuxanPOP)][SF5] (6). Treatment of 6 with the Lewis acids BF3 or AsF5 produced the dicationic difluorosulfanyl complex [Rh(Me)(SF2)(tBuxanPOP)][BF4]2 (8&#8201;a) or [Rh(Me)(SF2)(tBuxanPOP)][AsF6]2 (8&#8201;b), respectively. Refluorination of 8&#8201;a was possible with the use of dimethylamine giving [Rh(Me)(SF3)(tBuxanPOP)][BF4] (9). A reaction of 6 with trichloroisocyanuric acid (TClCA) gave the fluorido complex [Rh(F)(Cl)(SF2)(tBuxanPOP)][Cl] (2&#8201;b) together with chloromethane and SF5Cl.

         <title>Genuine Pores in a Stable Zinc Phosphite for High H2 Adsorption and CO2 Capture</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first example of crystalline zinc phosphite incorporating thio&#8208;functionalized O&#8208;donor and tetradentate N&#8208;donor building blocks has been synthesized and characterized by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. Interestingly, this compound possessed not only uncommon structural features but also good capture for H2O, CO2, CO, CH4, N2, and H2 gases. The possible adsorption sites are discussed, and CO2 gas selectivity at 298&#8197;K is reported.







Abstract
An uncommon example of stable mixed&#8208;ligand zinc phosphite with genuine pores has been synthesized by using zinc metal, inorganic phosphite acid, thio&#8208;functionalized O&#8208;donor (2,5&#8208;thiophenedicarboxylate, TPDC), and tetradentate N&#8208;donor [1,2,4,5&#8208;tetrakis(imidazol&#8208;1&#8208;ylmethyl)benzene, TIMB] units assembled into one crystalline structure according to a hydro(solvo)thermal method. This is a very rare case of a metal phosphite incorporating both N&#8208; and O&#8208;donor ligands. The tetradentate TIMB linker bound to zinc atoms of the isolated zincophosphite hexamers to form a 3D open&#8208;framework structure by crosslinking structural components of 1D chains and 2D layers. Here, the TPDC ligand acts as a monodentate binding model to functionalize its porous structure with the uncoordinated S atom and COO&#8722; group. Interestingly, this compound demonstrates the highest H2 storage capacity among organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid metal phosphates (and phosphites), and a good CO2 capture at 298&#8197;K compared with the majority of crystalline materials. The possible adsorption sites and selectivity for CO2 over H2, N2, and CO at 298&#8197;K were calculated by using density functional theory (DFT), the ideal adsorption solution theory (IAST), and fitting experimental pure&#8208;component adsorption data.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A method to rapidly diversify molecules formed in organic crystals is introduced with aryl nitriles serving as a novel dual role as both hydrogen&#8208;bond&#8208;acceptors and modifiable organic groups. The discovery of coexisting supramolecular synthons in the same crystal is also described.&#160; The general concept is demonstrated using a bis(aryl nitrile) alkene that undergoes a hydrogen&#8208;bond&#8208;directed intermolecular [2+2] photodimerization to form a tetra(aryl nitrile)cyclobutane. The product is readily converted by Click reactivity to a tetra(aryl tetrazole) and hydrolysis to a tetra(aryl carboxylic acid). The integration of aryl nitriles into solid&#8208;state reactions opens broad avenues to post&#8208;modify products formed in crystalline solids for rapid diversification.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>C(sp  3  )&#8208;H and O&#8208;H bond breaking steps in the oxidation of 1,4&#8208;cyclohexadiene and phenol by a Au(III)&#8208;OH complex were studied computationally. The analysis reveals that for both types of bonds the initial X&#8208;H cleavage step follows a concerted proton coupled electron transfer step (cPCET), reflecting electron transfer from the substrate directly to the Au(III) center and proton transfer to the Au&#8208;bound oxygen. This mechanistic picture is distinct from the analogous formal Cu(III)&#8208;OH complexes studied by the Tolman group (  J. Am. Chem. Soc.  2019  , 141, 17236&#8722;17244  ), which proceed  via  hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) for C&#8208;H bonds and cPCET for O&#8208;H bonds. Hence, care should be taken when transferring concepts between Cu&#8208;OH and Au&#8208;OH species. Furthermore, the ability of Au&#8208;OH complexes to perform cPCET suggests further possibilities for one&#8208;electron chemistry at the Au center, for which only limited examples exist.</dc:description>

         <title>Controllable Zeolite AST Crystallization: Between Classical and Reversed Crystal Growth</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A truly reversed crystal growth mode in which the crystallization starts at the surface of a spherically amorphous aggregate and then proceeds towards its center is described. The fundamental function of the structure&#8208;directing agent (SDA) controlling the crystallization pathway is uncovered. Thus, the crystallization pathway can be &#8220;switched&#8221; between classical and reversed crystal growth by tuning the concentration of the SDA.







Abstract
Crystal growth mechanisms govern a wide range of properties of crystalline materials. Reversed crystal growth is one of the nonclassical mechanisms observed in many materials. However, the reversed crystallization starting from amorphous aggregates and the key factors driving this growth remain elusive. Here, we describe a characteristic model of reversed crystal growth representing the inner structure and crystallinity development of aggregates studied by microscopy and nano X&#8208;ray computed tomography. By adjusting the synthesis conditions, the fundamental function of the structure&#8208;directing agent, which determines the crystallization pathway, was revealed. As a result, the crystal growth mode can be &#8220;switched&#8221; from the classical route at a low ratio of SDA/framework elements to reversed growth at a high ratio. Our findings provide further insights into crystal growth control, which is crucial for improving synthesis protocols and designing various forms of crystalline materials.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A truly reversed&lt;/b&gt; crystal growth mode in which the crystallization starts at the surface of a spherically amorphous aggregate and then proceeds towards its center is described. The fundamental function of the structure-directing agent (SDA) controlling the crystallization pathway is uncovered. Thus, the crystallization pathway can be &#8220;switched&#8221; between classical and reversed crystal growth by tuning the concentration of the SDA.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crystal growth mechanisms govern a wide range of properties of crystalline materials. Reversed crystal growth is one of the nonclassical mechanisms observed in many materials. However, the reversed crystallization starting from amorphous aggregates and the key factors driving this growth remain elusive. Here, we describe a characteristic model of reversed crystal growth representing the inner structure and crystallinity development of aggregates studied by microscopy and nano X-ray computed tomography. By adjusting the synthesis conditions, the fundamental function of the structure-directing agent, which determines the crystallization pathway, was revealed. As a result, the crystal growth mode can be &#8220;switched&#8221; from the classical route at a low ratio of SDA/framework elements to reversed growth at a high ratio. Our findings provide further insights into crystal growth control, which is crucial for improving synthesis protocols and designing various forms of crystalline materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Structural Phase Transitions and Magnetic Superexchange in MIAgIIF3 Perovskites at High Pressure**
</title>

         <dc:description>
Weaker under pressure: The phase transitions and magnetic properties of MAgF3 perovskites at pressures up to 100&#8197;GPa have been elucidated for the first time by DFT calculations. The emerging post&#8208;perovskite structures feature much weaker antiferromagnetic interactions than the parent perovskites. The magneto&#8208;structural behavior of the AgII compounds differs substantially from that of their CuII siblings due to the pronounced covalence of Ag&#8722;F bonds.







Abstract
Pressure&#8208;induced phase transitions of MIAgIIF3 perovskites (M=K, Rb, Cs) have been predicted theoretically for the first time for pressures up to 100&#8197;GPa. The sequence of phase transitions for M=K and Rb consists of a transition from orthorhombic to monoclinic and back to orthorhombic, associated with progressive bending of infinite chains of corner&#8208;sharing [AgF6]4&#8722; octahedra and their mutual approach through secondary Ag&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;F contacts. In stark contrast, only a single phase transition (tetragonal&#8594;triclinic) is predicted for CsAgF3; this is associated with substantial deformation of the Jahn&#8211;Teller&#8208;distorted first coordination sphere of AgII and association of the infinite [AgF6]4&#8722; chains into a polymeric sublattice. The phase transitions markedly decrease the coupling strength of intra&#8208;chain antiferromagnetic superexchange in MAgF3 hosts lattices.

         <title>Pd&#8208;Catalyzed Difluoromethylations of Aryl Boronic Acids, Halides, and Pseudohalides with ICF2H Generated ex Situ</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ex&#8208;situ process for the generation of stoichiometric difluoroiodomethane and its application to a two&#8208;step catalytic difluoromethylation of aryl (pseudo)halides is identified. The method exhibits good functional&#8208;group tolerance and is adaptable to isotope labeling, as exemplified by the preparation of deuteriodifluoromethyl arenes.







Abstract
An expedient ex&#8208;situ generation of difluoroiodomethane (DFIM) and its immediate use in a Pd&#8208;catalyzed difluoromethylation of aryl boronic acids and ester derivatives in a two&#8208;chamber reactor is reported. Heating a solution of bromodifluoroacetic acid with sodium iodide in sulfolane proved to be effective for the generation of near stoichiometric amounts of DFIM for the ensuing catalytic coupling step. A two&#8208;step difluoromethylation of aryl (pseudo)halides with tetrahydroxydiboron as a low&#8208;cost reducing agent, both promoted by Pd catalysis, proved effective to install this fluorine&#8208;containing C1 group onto several pharmaceutically relevant molecules. Finally, the method proved adaptable to deuterium incorporation by simply adding D2O to the DFIM&#8208;generating chamber.

         <title>Biomimetic Peptide Catalytic Bond&#8208;Forming Utilizing a Mild Br&#248;nsted Acid</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Since the global peptide drug market demand has been predicted to increase, highly efficient and inexpensive mass scale peptides are required. However, the production process raises questions about the cost of energy input, scale&#8208;up production, raw materials, and solvents treatment. This paper introduces 2 methods for the 2&#8208;4 mer oligopeptides bond formation for batch reaction utilizing 50&#8208;100 mol% of a mild Br&#248;nsted acid under the mild condition. One of the methods has been capably adapted to flow synthesis at room temperature using organic solvents with boiling points below 100 . The method applies the tert&#8208;butoxycarbonyl amino methoxy group, forming the desired dipeptide without solvent at mild temperatures. Furthermore, the conversion of the carboxylic acid leaving the group to phenyl ester promotes peptide bond formation, and the reaction were applied to di, tri, and tetrapeptide bond formation in excellent yield without notable racemization at ambient temperature (up to &gt;99% yield and 99:1 dr). And the end, this study proposes this new production method to overcome the limited scale&#8208;up production by reaction device scale: liquid phase biomimetic catalytic peptide flow synthesis utilizing a mild Br&#248;nsted acid.</dc:description>

AzMT is thoroughly analyzed by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction experiments, elemental analysis, IR spectroscopy and multinuclear (  1  H,  13  C,  14  N,  15  N) NMR measurements. Several ECCs of 3d metals (Mn, Fe, Cu, Zn) and silver in combination with anions such as (per)chlorate, mono&#8208; and di&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;trinitrophenolate are prepared, giving insight on the coordination behavior of  AzMT  as ligand. The synthesized ECCs are also analyzed by X&#8208;ray diffraction experiments, elemental analysis, and IR spectroscopy. Differential thermal analysis for all compounds is conducted and the sensitivity towards external stimuli (impact, friction, and ESD) are measured. Due to the high enthalpy of formation of AzMT (+654.5 kJ mol  &#8722;1  ), some of the resulting coordination compounds are extremely sensitive, yet are able to undergo deflagration&#8208;to&#8208;detonation transition (DDT) and initiate pentaerythritol tetranitrate (PETN).

         <title>Methyl Viologens of Bis&#8208;(4'&#8208;pyridylethynyl)arenes &#8208; Structures, Photophysical and Electrochemical Studies, and their Potential Application in Biology</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A series of bis&#8208;(4'&#8208;pyridylethynyl)arenes (arene = benzene, tetrafluorobenzene, &amp; anthracene) were synthesized and their bis&#8208;  N  &#8208;methylpyridinium compounds were investigated as a class of &#960;&#8208;extended methyl viologens. Their structures were determined by X&#8208;ray diffraction, and their photophysical and electrochemical properties as well as their interactions with DNA/RNA were investigated. The dications showed bathochromic shifts in emission compared to the neutral compounds. The neutral compounds showed very small Stokes shifts, which are a little larger for the dications. The compounds showed very short fluorescence lifetimes (&lt; 4 ns). The neutral compound with an anthracene core has a quantum yield of almost unity. With stronger acceptors, the analogous dicationic&#160;compound showed a larger 2&#8208;photon absorption (TPA) cross&#8208;section than its neutral precursor. All of the dicationic compounds interact with DNA/RNA; while the compounds with benzene and tetrafluorobenzene cores bind in the grooves, the one with an anthracene core intercalates as a consequence of its large,&#160;aromatic linker moiety, and it aggregates within the polynucleotide when in excess over DNA/RNA. All cationic compounds showed highly specific CD spectra upon binding to ds&#8208;DNA/RNA, attributed to the rare case of forcing the planar, achiral molecule into a chiral rotamer, and negligible toxicity toward human cell lines at &#8804; 10 &#181;M concentrations. The anthracene&#8208;analogue exhibited intracellular accumulation within lysosomes, preventing its interaction with cellular DNA/RNA. However, cytotoxicity was evident at 1 &#181;M concentration upon exposure to light, due to singlet oxygen generation within cells.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A series of bis-(4'-pyridylethynyl)arenes (arene = benzene, tetrafluorobenzene, &amp; anthracene) were synthesized and their bis-  N  -methylpyridinium compounds were investigated as a class of &#960;-extended methyl viologens. Their structures were determined by X-ray diffraction, and their photophysical and electrochemical properties as well as their interactions with DNA/RNA were investigated. The dications showed bathochromic shifts in emission compared to the neutral compounds. The neutral compounds showed very small Stokes shifts, which are a little larger for the dications. The compounds showed very short fluorescence lifetimes (&amp;lt; 4 ns). The neutral compound with an anthracene core has a quantum yield of almost unity. With stronger acceptors, the analogous dicationic&#160;compound showed a larger 2-photon absorption (TPA) cross-section than its neutral precursor. All of the dicationic compounds interact with DNA/RNA; while the compounds with benzene and tetrafluorobenzene cores bind in the grooves, the one with an anthracene core intercalates as a consequence of its large,&#160;aromatic linker moiety, and it aggregates within the polynucleotide when in excess over DNA/RNA. All cationic compounds showed highly specific CD spectra upon binding to ds-DNA/RNA, attributed to the rare case of forcing the planar, achiral molecule into a chiral rotamer, and negligible toxicity toward human cell lines at &#8804; 10 &#181;M concentrations. The anthracene-analogue exhibited intracellular accumulation within lysosomes, preventing its interaction with cellular DNA/RNA. However, cytotoxicity was evident at 1 &#181;M concentration upon exposure to light, due to singlet oxygen generation within cells. These&#160;features, in combination with its TPA properties, suggest it to be a promising lead compound for development of light-activated theranostic agents.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective Hydrosilylation of gem&#8208;Difluorocyclopropenes Leading to a Stereochemical Study of the Silylated gem&#8208;Difluorocyclopropanes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The copper&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective hydrosilylation of gem&#8208;difluorocyclopropenes providing the chiral gem&#8208;difluorocyclopropanes is presented. The use of copper(I) chloride, chiral ligands including bidentate BINAPs and monodentate phosphoramidites, and silylborane Me2PhSi&#8208;Bpin accompanying NaOtBu in methanol was appropriate for the enantioselective hydrosilylation of the strained C=C double bond. Subsequent activation of the silyl groups in enantio&#8208;enriched gem&#8208;difluorocyclopropanes showed substantial reduction of the enantiopurity, indicating cleavage of the distal C&#8722;C bond.







Abstract
Optically active cyclopropanes have been widely investigated especially from the views of pharmaceutical and agrochemical industries, and substituting one of the methylenes with the difluoromethylene unit should be promising for developing novel biologically relevant compounds and functional materials. In this paper, the copper&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective hydrosilylation of gem&#8208;difluorocyclopropenes to provide the corresponding chiral gem&#8208;difluorocyclopropanes is presented. The use of copper(I) chloride, chiral ligands including bidentate BINAPs and monodentate phosphoramidites, and silylborane Me2PhSi&#8208;Bpin accompanying sodium tert&#8208;butoxide in methanol was appropriate for the enantioselective hydrosilylation of the strained C=C double bond, and the resultant chiral difluorinated three&#8208;membered ring was unambiguously characterized. Subsequent activation of the silyl groups in enantio&#8208;enriched gem&#8208;difluorocyclopropanes showed substantial reduction of the enantiopurity, indicating cleavage of the distal C&#8722;C bond leading to the transient acyclic intermediates.

         <title>Size Effects of the Anions in the Ionothermal Synthesis of Carbon Nitride Materials</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Size effects: Ionothermal condensation of dicyandiamide in alkali halide salt melts leads to the formation of extended 2D, layered frameworks only in the presence of small halides such as chloride, and bromide. With increasing size of the alkali halide intercalate, stabilizing van der Waals interactions between extended, &#960;&#8208;conjugated triazine&#8208;based sheets are lost. The main, crystalline product from an alkali iodide eutectic was identified as melem hydrate, a heptazine (C6N7)&#8208;based, hydrogen&#8208;bonded, monoclinic solid.







Abstract
Semiconducting carbon nitride polymers are used in metal&#8208;free photocatalysts and in opto&#8208;electronic devices. Conventionally, they are obtained using thermal and ionothermal syntheses in inscrutable, closed systems and therefore, their condensation behavior is poorly understood. Here, the synthetic protocols and properties are compared for two types of carbon nitride materials &#8211; 2D layered poly(triazine imide) (PTI) and hydrogen&#8208;bonded melem hydrate &#8211; obtained from three low&#8208;melting salt eutectics taken from the systematic series of the alkali metal halides: LiCl/KCl, LiBr/KBr, and LiI/KI. The size of the anion plays a significant role in the formation process of the condensed carbon nitride polymers, and it suggests a strong templating effect. The smaller anions (chloride and bromide) become incorporated into triazine (C3N3)&#8208;based PTI frameworks. The larger iodide does not stabilize the formation of a triazine&#8208;based polymer, but instead it leads to the formation of the heptazine (C6N7)&#8208;based hydrogen&#8208;bonded melem hydrate as the main crystalline phase. Melem hydrate, obtained as single&#8208;crystalline powders, was compared with PTI in photocatalytic hydrogen evolution from water and in an OLED device. Further, the emergence of each carbon nitride species from its corresponding salt eutectic was rationalized via density functional theory calculations. This study highlights the possibilities to further tailor the properties of eutectic salt melts for ionothermal synthesis of organic functional materials.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hierarchical asymmetric magnetic mesoporous hollow nanorobot was constructed in a sequential interfacial super&#8208;assembly strategy. This nanorobot with magnetic responsiveness, confined catalytic degradation, durable motion and recyclability not only sets a platform for manipulating motion behavior, but also provides a promising tool for future applications.

         <title>Design of Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Phenothiazine Derivatives with Triplet&#8208;Related Dual Emission and High&#8208;Contrast Mechanochromism Guided by Polymorph Prediction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The potential conformations of phenthiazine derivatives have been predicted by Polymorph Prediction. The crystals of those derivatives with the potential to form both quasi&#8208;axial and quasi&#8208;equatorial conformations can undergo conformation transition and show high&#8208;contrast mechanochromism from local emission (LE) to intramolecular or intermolecular charge transfer (CT) emission. All the derivatives also exhibit aggregation&#8208;induced emission and triplet&#8208;related dual emission characters. More information can be found in the Research Article by S. Xiao, T. Yi, and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202200458).

         <title>Nanosheets of Ni&#8208;SAPO&#8208;34 Molecular Sieve for Selective Oxidation of Cyclohexanone to Adipic Acid</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nanosheets of nickel doped SAPO&#8208;34 molecular sieves in thickness of ~10 nm (denoted as NS&#8208;Ni&#8208;SAPO&#8208;34) has been successfully prepared through a morphology&#8208;reserved method of synthesis. A special aluminum phosphate in two&#8208;dimensional layered structure is used as precursor and converts to crystallized SAPO&#8208;34 molecular sieve, in nanosheet morphology reserved from the aluminum phosphate precursor, under hydrothermal conditions with tetraethyl orthosilicate and templates of mixed amines added. It is found that adequate amount of nickel, ~5 wt.%, added to the synthetic system is a key factor for the morphology&#8208;reserved synthesis. By characterization, the nickel is proved to be doped in the framework of the molecular sieve, which more likely helps to balance the high surface energy of nanosheet products. The NS&#8208;Ni&#8208;SAPO&#8208;34 shows excellent catalytic performance for oxidation of cyclohexanone to adipic acid by gaseous oxygen.</dc:description>

         <title>Azobenzene Substituted Triptycenes &#8211; Understanding Exciton Coupling of Molecular Switches in Close Proximity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we report a series of azobenzene substituted tripycenes. In their design, the switching units were placed in close proximity, but electronically separated by a sp  3  center. The azobenzene switches were prepared  via  Baeyer&#8208;Mills coupling as key step. The isomerization behavior was investigated via  1  H NMR, UV/Vis spectroscopy and HPLC. It was shown that all azobenzene moieties are efficiently switchable. Despite the geometric decoupling of the chromophores, computational studies revealed excitonic coupling effects between the individual azobenzene units depending on the connectivity pattern due to different transition dipole moments of &#960;&#8594;&#960;* excitations. In these cases, transition probabilities for those excitations are slightly altered which is also revealed in their absorption spectra. These insights provide new design parameters for combining multiple photoswitches in one molecule, which bear high potential for energy or information storage systems, and among others also in molecular machines and supramolecular chemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>A Stereocontrolled Total Synthesis of Lipoxin B4 and its Biological Activity as a Pro&#8208;Resolving Lipid Mediator of Neuroinflammation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two stereocontrolled, efficient, and modular syntheses of eicosanoid lipoxin B4 (LXB4) are reported. One features a stereoselective reduction followed by an asymmetric epoxidation sequence to set the vicinal diol stereocentres. The dienyne was installed via a one&#8208;pot Wittig olefination and base&#8208;mediated epoxide ring opening cascade. The other approach installed the diol through an asymmetric dihydroxylation reaction followed by a Horner&#8208;Wadsworth&#8208;Emmons olefination to afford the common dienyne intermediate. Finally, a Sonogashira coupling and an alkyne hydrosilylation/proto&#8208;desilylation protocol furnished LXB4  in 25% overall yield in just 10 steps. For the first time, LXB4  has been fully characterized spectroscopically with its structure confirmed as previously reported. We have demonstrated that the synthesized LXB4  showed similar biological activity to commercial sources in a cellular neuroprotection model. This synthetic route can be employed to synthesize large quantities of LXB4  , enable synthesis of new analogs, and chemical probes for receptor and pathway characterization.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrochemically Assisted Cycloaddition of Carbon Dioxide to Styrene Oxide on Copper/carbon Hybrid Electrodes: Active Species and Reaction Mechanism</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A novel electrochemically assisted cycloaddition reaction process was proposed, in which highly efficient coupling of CO 2 with styrene oxide (SO) can be achieved forming styrene carbonate (SC) as high value&#8208;added product. A series of Cu catalysts with different morphologies and chemical states were fabricated on carbon paper using the in&#8208;situ electrodeposition method, and the sample with nano&#8208;dendrimer structure exhibited relatively high activity of 74.8% SC yield with 92.7% SO conversion under gentle reaction conditions, showing its potential for practical applications. The relatively high electrochemical active surface area and charge transfer ability of dendrimer&#8208;like Cu benefited the electrochemical reaction. Especially the Cu 2+ species those were in&#8208;situ formed during the reaction played a vital role in enhancing the activity and selectivity of the proposed copper/carbon paper (Cu/CP) hybrid catalyst. Cu 2+ served as the active sites, that can not only electrochemically activate CO 2 but also facilitate the ring&#8208;opening process of SO. Mechanistic analysis suggested that the reaction followed the electrochemical and liquid phase heterogeneous paths, respectively, which provided a new green and sustainable route for efficient utilization of CO 2 resources for fine chemical electro&#8208;synthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>Teaching an old compound new tricks: reversible transamidation in maleamic acids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dynamic combinatorial chemistry is a method widely used for generating responsive libraries of compounds, with applications ranging from chemical biology to materials science. It relies on dynamic covalent bonds that are able to form in a reversible manner in mild conditions, and therefore requires the discovery of new types of these bonds in order to progress. Amides, due to their high stability, have been scarcely used in this eld

and typically require an external catalyst or harsh conditions for exchange. Compounds able to undergo uncatalysed transamidation at room temperature are still rare exceptions. In this work, we describe reversible amide formation and transamidation in a class of compounds known as maleamic acids. Due to the presence of a carboxylic acid in b&#8208;position, these compounds are in equilibrium with their anhydride and amine precursors in organic solvents at room temperature. First, we show that this equilibrium is responsive to external stimuli: by alternating the additions of a Br&#248;nsted acid and a base, we can switch between amide and anhydride several times without side&#8208;reactions. Next, we prove that this equilibrium provides a pathway for reversible transamidation without any added catalyst, leading to thermodynamic distributions of amides at room temperature. Lastly, we use dierent preparation conditions and concentrations of Br&#248;nsted acid to access dierent library distributions, easily controlling the transition between kinetic and thermodynamic regimes. Our results show that maleamic acids can undergo transamidation in mild conditions in a reversible and tunable way, establishing them as a new addition to the toolbox of dynamic combinatorial chemistry.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Dynamic combinatorial chemistry is a method widely used for generating responsive libraries of compounds, with applications ranging from chemical biology to materials science. It relies on dynamic covalent bonds that are able to form in a reversible manner in mild conditions, and therefore requires the discovery of new types of these bonds in order to progress. Amides, due to their high stability, have been scarcely used in this eld

and typically require an external catalyst or harsh conditions for exchange. Compounds able to undergo uncatalysed transamidation at room temperature are still rare exceptions. In this work, we describe reversible amide formation and transamidation in a class of compounds known as maleamic acids. Due to the presence of a carboxylic acid in b-position, these compounds are in equilibrium with their anhydride and amine precursors in organic solvents at room temperature. First, we show that this equilibrium is responsive to external stimuli: by alternating the additions of a Br&#248;nsted acid and a base, we can switch between amide and anhydride several times without side-reactions. Next, we prove that this equilibrium provides a pathway for reversible transamidation without any added catalyst, leading to thermodynamic distributions of amides at room temperature. Lastly, we use dierent preparation conditions and concentrations of Br&#248;nsted acid to access dierent library distributions, easily controlling the transition between kinetic and thermodynamic regimes. Our results show that maleamic acids can undergo transamidation in mild conditions in a reversible and tunable way, establishing them as a new addition to the toolbox of dynamic combinatorial chemistry.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Multienzyme Biocatalytic Cascade Systems in Porous Organic Frameworks for Biosensing</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
New strategies for spatially organizing multienzyme biocatalytic cascades using porous organic frameworks are discussed in this Concept article, describing how this new bio&#8208;nanosystem that integrates framework and enzyme functions can be designed as a versatile biosensing platform.







Abstract
Multienzyme biocatalytic cascade systems (MBCS) have attracted widespread research in the field of biosensing due to selective substrate transformations and signal amplification function. However, the poor stability of enzymes significantly restricts their effectiveness in practical applications. The spatial organization of MBCS within porous organic frameworks (POFs), such as metal&#8211;organic frameworks, covalent organic frameworks, and hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks, is regarded as a promising strategy to overcome these challenges. This advanced biotechnology sets up a POFs microenvironment for enzymes immobilization, and thus make it possible to shield the enzyme from the external stimulus by POFs&#8208;guided structural confinement. Simultaneously, the tailorable porous structure of POFs shell allows for the selective transport of substrates into interior enzymes, thereby accelerating the sensing process. Herein, we present the concept of this POFs&#8208;confined MBCS, wherein enzymes were completely encapsulated into, rather than adsorption onto, the POFs. We highlight the new strategies for MBCS spatial organization through rational POFs support, and describe how this new bio&#8208;nanosystem that integrates framework and enzymes functions can be designed as a versatile biosensing platform. In addition, the challenges and outlooks are also discussed.

Radical hydrazinium: A highly labile hydrazinium&#8208;yl radical cation, [(Me3Si)2N&#8722;N(H)SiMe3].+, formed by a one&#8208;electron oxidation of tris(trimethylsilyl) hydrazine, (Me3Si)2N&#8722;N(H)SiMe3, with silver salts is presented. The structural and electronic parameters of the hydrazinium&#8208;yl radical cation were elucidated, revealing that the spin density in the isolated radical is mainly localized along the N&#8722;N unit of the hydrazine moiety.







Abstract
The oxidation of silylated hydrazine, (Me3Si)2N&#8722;N(H)SiMe3, with silver salts led to the formation of a highly labile hydrazinium&#8208;yl radical cation, [(Me3Si)2N&#8722;N(H)SiMe3].+, at very low temperatures (decomposition &gt; &#8722;40&#8201;&#176;C). EPR, NMR, DFT and Raman studies revealed the formation of a nitrogen&#8208;centered radical cation along the N&#8722;N unit of the hydrazine. In the presence of the weakly coordinating anion [Al{OCH(CF3)2}4]&#8722;, crystallization and structural characterization in the solid state were achieved. The hydrazinium&#8208;yl radical cation has a significantly shortened N&#8722;N bond and a nearly planar N2Si3 framework, in contrast to the starting material. According to DFT calculations, the shortened N&#8722;N bond has a total bond order of 1.5 with a &#960;&#8208;bond order of 0.5. The &#960; bond can be regarded as a three&#8208;&#960;&#8208;electron, two&#8208;center bond.

         <title>Reactivity of Diphenylberyllium as a Br&#248;nsted Base and Its Synthetic Application</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Br&#248;nsted basic properties of diphenylberyllium have been used to cleanly produce a range of important benchmark compounds. The long&#8208;suspected structure of [Be3(OtBu)6] is finally verified, and shown to be static in solution; the NHC&#8208;stabilised beryllium Grignard is the first of its kind. The stark differences between Be&#8722;N and Be&#8722;P interactions are also evidenced here.







Abstract
Diphenylberyllium [Be3Ph6] is shown here to react cleanly as a Br&#248;nsted base with a vast variety of protic compounds. Through the addition of the simple molecules tBuOH, HNPh2 and HPPh2, as well as the more complex 1,3&#8208;bis&#8208;(2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl)imidazolinium chloride, one or two phenyl groups in diphenylberyllium were protonated. As a result, the long&#8208;postulated structures of [Be3(OtBu)6] and [Be(&#956;&#8208;NPh2)Ph]2 have finally been verified and shown to be static in solution. Additionally [Be(&#956;&#8208;PPh2)(HPPh2)Ph]2 was generated, which is only the second beryllium&#8208;phospanide to be prepared; the stark differences between its behaviour and that of the analogous amide were also examined. The first crystalline example of a beryllium Grignard reagent with a non&#8208;bulky aryl group has also been prepared; it is stabilised with an N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Br&#248;nsted basic&lt;/b&gt; properties of diphenylberyllium have been used to cleanly produce a range of important benchmark compounds. The long-suspected structure of [Be&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(O&lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;Bu)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;] is finally verified, and shown to be static in solution; the NHC-stabilised beryllium Grignard is the first of its kind. The stark differences between Be&#8722;N and Be&#8722;P interactions are also evidenced here.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Diphenylberyllium [Be&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Ph&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;] is shown here to react cleanly as a Br&#248;nsted base with a vast variety of protic compounds. Through the addition of the simple molecules &lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;BuOH, HNPh&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and HPPh&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, as well as the more complex 1,3-bis-(2,6-diisopropylphenyl)imidazolinium chloride, one or two phenyl groups in diphenylberyllium were protonated. As a result, the long-postulated structures of [Be&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(O&lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;Bu)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;] and [Be(&#956;-NPh&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)Ph]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; have finally been verified and shown to be static in solution. Additionally [Be(&#956;-PPh&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)(HPPh&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)Ph]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; was generated, which is only the second beryllium-phospanide to be prepared; the stark differences between its behaviour and that of the analogous amide were also examined. The first crystalline example of a beryllium Grignard reagent with a non-bulky aryl group has also been prepared; it is stabilised with an N-heterocyclic carbene.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Efficient Piezoelectric Energy Harvesting from a Discrete Hybrid Bismuth Bromide Ferroelectric Templated by Phosphonium Cation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Phosphonium perovskitoid harvesters: A hybrid bismuth halide salt, [Me(Ph)3P]3[Bi2Br9], stabilized by phosphonium cations was synthesized and shown to exhibit ferroelectric polarization as determined by P&#8722;E loop and piezoresponse force microscopy measurements. Flexible composite devices of it with polydimethylsiloxane were fabricated and utilized as piezoelectric nanogenerators with high output voltage and power density values. The obtained voltages were further employed for capacitor charging applications.







Abstract
Bismuth containing hybrid molecular ferroelectrics are receiving tremendous attention in recent years owing to their stable and non&#8208;toxic composition. However, these perovskite&#8208;like structures are primarily limited to ammonium cations. Herein, we report a new phosphonium based discrete perovskite&#8208;like hybrid ferroelectric with a formula [Me(Ph)3P]3[Bi2Br9] (MTPBB) and its mechanical energy harvesting capability. The Polarization&#8208;Electric field (P&#8208;E) measurements resulted in a well&#8208;defined ferroelectric hysteresis loop with a remnant polarization value of 2.1&#8197;&#956;C&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Piezoresponse force microscopy experiments enabled visualization of the ferroelectric domain structure and evaluation of the piezoelectric strain coefficient (d33) for an MTPBB single crystal and thin film sample. Furthermore, flexible devices incorporating MTPBB in polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) matrix at various concentrations were fabricated and explored for their mechanical energy harvesting properties. The champion device with 20&#8197;wt&#8201;% of MTPBB in PDMS rendered a maximum peak&#8208;to&#8208;peak open&#8208;circuit voltage of 22.9&#8197;V and a maximum power density of 7&#8197;&#956;W&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at an optimal load of 4&#8197;M&#937;. Moreover, the potential of MTPBB&#8208;based devices in low power electronics was demonstrated by storing the harvested energy in various electrolytic capacitors.

         <title>Revisiting the environment effect on mass transfer for heterogenized Ru6Pd8 metal&#8208;organic cage photocatalyst confined within 3D matrix</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Artificial light&#8208;driven splitting of water into hydrogen involves multiple links to emulate natural photosynthesis, including light absorption, electron or energy transfer, surface catalysis et al., in which, the mass transportation of sacrificial reagent and reactant is always ignored. Metal&#8208;organic cage (MOC) of Pd  6  Ru  8  (MOC&#8208;16), assembling multiple photosensitive Ru and catalytic Pd concomitant with directional electron transfer between them, provides an opportunity to explore the environmental effects from the view point of mass transportation without disturbance of other links. Zr&#8208;MOF of UiO&#8208;66 is used as a matrix to heterogenize MOC&#8208;16 and a series of characterizations are carried out to unravel the composition, structure and optical properties. The intact MOC&#8208;16 is remained with long&#8208;term photo&#8208;stability and the outstanding photocatalytic activity is obtained by virtue of a long&#8208;lived triplet state. Three matrixes of ZIF&#8208;8, ZIF&#8208;8 derived carbonate CZIF, and UiO&#8208;66 are intercompared for mass transfer based on wettability and porous structure. Water molecule directly takes part in the formation of H  2  catalyzed by MOC&#8208;16@UiO&#8208;66, evidenced by a kinetic isotope effect, in addition to the proton delivery thanks to the hydrophilic nature of UiO&#8208;66. The porous structure of UiO&#8208;66 is essential for the permeation of sacrificial reagent to serve as two&#8208;electron donor, in sharp contrast as one&#8208;electron donor in nonporous CZIF matrix. These results highlight the importance of microenviroment surrounding molecular catalysts in view of the heterogenization of molecular catalysts, meanwhile, provide a prominent guidance on how to choose 3D support to bridge the homogenous and heterogenous system.</dc:description>

A variety of alcohols including ones that contained acid&#8208;labile and/or basic&#8208;labile functionalities were rapidly reacted. An over nucleophilic substitution that occurred during reaction of the second alcohol was suppressed via the addition of imidazole. Density functional theory calculation of the sequen&#8208;tial nucleophilic substitutions of alcohols was performed both with and without imidazole, and Berry pseudorotation was suggested as a rate&#8208;limiting step in both cases. Herein we discuss the reasons for the decreased selectivity in the ab&#8208;sence of imidazole as well as those for improved selectivity in the presence of imidazole during the second nucleophilic substitution.</dc:description>

         <title>Influence of the linker chemistry on the photoinduced charge&#8208;transfer dynamics of heterodinuclear photocatalysts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>For optimizing light&#8208;driven catalytic processes, light&#8208;mediated multi&#8208;electron transfer dynamics in molecular dyads need to be studied and correlated with structural changes focusing on the catalytically active metastable intermediates. Here, spectroelectrochemistry has been employed to investigate the structure dependent photoelectron transfer kinetics in catalytically active intermediates of two Ru&#8208;Rh&#8208;catalysts for light&#8208;driven NAD+ reduction. The excited state reactivity of short&#8208;lived intermediates was studied along different photoreaction pathways by resonance Raman and time&#8208;resolved transient absorption spectroelectrochemistry with sub&#8208;ps time resolution under in operando conditions. The results demonstrate for the first time, how the bridging ligand serves as an (multi&#8208;)electron storage structure, mediates the strength of the electronic coupling of catalytic and photocenter and impacts the targeted electron transfer as well as parasitic electron&#8208;transfer kinetics.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>We report the first example of very efficient NIR Circularly Polarized Luminescence (CPL) (around 970 nm) in water, obtained thanks to the combined use of a chiral Yb complex and of poly lactic&#8208;co&#8208;glycolic acid (PLGA) nanoparticles.

PLGA nanoparticles incorporate the complex and protect the metal ion from the intrusion of solvent molecules, while ensuring biocompatibility, water solubility and stability to the complex.

         <title>The effects of ring strain on cyclic tetraaryl[5]cumulenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cyclic tetraaryl[5]cumulenes (  1a&#8211;f  ) have been synthesized and studied as a function of increasing ring strain. The magnitude of ring strain is approximated by the extent of bending of the cumulenic core as assessed by a combination of X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis and DFT calculations. Trends are observed in  13  C NMR, UV&#8208;vis, and Raman spectra associated with ring strain, but the effects are small. In particular, the experimental HOMO&#8211;LUMO gap is not appreciably affected by bending of the [5]cumulene framework from ca. 174&#176; (  &#955;  max  = 504 nm) in  1a  to ca. 178&#176; (  &#955;  max  = 494 nm) in  1f  .</dc:description>

         <title>Molecular Engineering of Star&#8208;Shaped Indoline Hole Transport Materials: The Influence of Planarity on the Hole Extraction and Transport Processes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The planarity of the side chain of star&#8208;shaped hole transport material (HTM) is systematically improved. Along with the improvement, the HOMO level of the HTM is increased, leading to enhanced hole extraction capability. Meanwhile, the hole transport capability can also be improved due to the intensification of molecular stacking during film formation. As a result, the planar HTM achieves a relatively high efficiency of 18.48&#8201;%, providing us with a promising strategy for further optimization of efficient HTMs.







Abstract
As the key properties of perovskite solar cells (PSCs), the hole extraction and transport capabilities of the hole transport material (HTM) affect the photovoltaic performance of PSCs to a considerable extent, while both capabilities can be adjusted by molecular planarity. Therefore, in this work, the molecular planarity of the HTM is systematically optimized to regulate the hole extraction and transport capabilities. Along with the improvement in planarity, the HTM&#8242;s HOMO level is increased, leading to the enhancement of hole extraction capability. Meanwhile, the hole transport capability can also be improved due to the intensification of molecular stacking during the film formation. As a result, the planar HTM achieves a relatively high efficiency of 18.48&#8201;%, which is higher than that of spiro&#8208;OMeTAD. Accordingly, the molecular planarity presents an important impact on the photovoltaic performance of PSCs, providing us with a promising strategy for further optimization of efficient HTMs.

         <dc:description>
A series of folded aromatic oligoamides with absolute control of helical sense has been synthesized. These helices can implement an asymmetric reduction reaction in their cavities, and the diastereoselectivity of the reaction is significantly improved by optimization of the oligoamide sequences.

 Dimers in a Low&#8208;Dimensional Tetrabromocuprate Magnet</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Only one way: (3,4&#8208;lutH)2CuBr4 (3,4&#8208;lut=3,4&#8208;lutidine) is a homometallic spin&#8208;
 tetrabromocuprate that adopts a bilayer structure with strong antiferromagnetic coupling between dimers across the bilayer and weaker intralayer ferromagnetic interactions. First&#8208;principles calculations suggest there is only significant magnetic coupling within one direction of a layer; this is consistent with a spin&#8208;ladder motif with antiferromagnetic rung and weaker ferromagnetic rail couplings.







Abstract
This work describes a homometallic spin&#8208;
 tetrabromocuprate adopting a bilayer structure. Magnetic&#8208;susceptibility measurements show a broad maximum centred near 70&#8197;K, with fits to this data using a Heisenberg model consistent with strong antiferromagnetic coupling between neighbouring copper atoms in different layers of the bilayer. There are further weak intralayer ferromagnetic interactions between copper cations in neighbouring dimers. First&#8208;principles calculations are consistent with this, but suggest there is only significant magnetic coupling within one direction of a layer; this would suggest the presence of a spin ladder within the bilayer with antiferromagnetic rung and weaker ferromagnetic rail couplings.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Only one way&lt;/b&gt;: (3,4-lutH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CuBr&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; (3,4-lut=3,4-lutidine) is a homometallic spin-
 tetrabromocuprate that adopts a bilayer structure with strong antiferromagnetic coupling between dimers across the bilayer and weaker intralayer ferromagnetic interactions. First-principles calculations suggest there is only significant magnetic coupling within one direction of a layer; this is consistent with a spin-ladder motif with antiferromagnetic rung and weaker ferromagnetic rail couplings.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This work describes a homometallic spin-
 tetrabromocuprate adopting a bilayer structure. Magnetic-susceptibility measurements show a broad maximum centred near 70&#8197;K, with fits to this data using a Heisenberg model consistent with strong antiferromagnetic coupling between neighbouring copper atoms in different layers of the bilayer. There are further weak intralayer ferromagnetic interactions between copper cations in neighbouring dimers. First-principles calculations are consistent with this, but suggest there is only significant magnetic coupling within one direction of a layer; this would suggest the presence of a spin ladder within the bilayer with antiferromagnetic rung and weaker ferromagnetic rail couplings.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbenes Carrying Weakly Coordinating Anions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Piggyback: N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes carrying weakly coordinating anions (WCA&#8208;NHCs) are an important and versatile ligand class used in transition metal as well as main group element chemistry. Bearing a negative charge in the backbone of the heterocycle, these carbenes can convert otherwise cationic NHC complexes into their overall neutral congeners. Aspects such as their development, syntheses, reactivity and possible future applications are discussed within this concept article.







Abstract
In this Concept article we provide a brief overview of the design and preparation of N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes carrying weakly coordinating anions (WCA&#8208;NHCs). The anionic charge in these ligand systems is located on an exocyclic group, for example, B(C6F5)3, tethered to the backbone of the imidazole ring, thus resembling a weakly coordinating moiety. With the general guiding principle behind the application of WCA&#8208;NHCs being the conversion of otherwise cationic NHC complexes into their overall neutral congeners, numerous transition metal as well as main group element complexes were isolated during the last decade, which are summarized herein.

         <title>Irreversible Inhibition of IspG, a Target for the Development of New Antimicrobials, by a 2&#8208;Vinyl Analogue of its MEcPP Substrate</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The rational design of a substrate analogue has afforded the first irreversible inhibitor of an IspG enzyme, a target for the development of new drugs to fight antimicrobial resistance. Inspired by the structural features of the natural substrate and by mechanistic aspects, we introduced a vinyl substituent to generate conjugated species during enzyme catalysis. Inhibition might occur through covalent interaction at the catalytic site. More information can be found in the Research Article by J.&#8208;B. Behr, M. Seemann, and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202200241).

         <title>Significant Effect of Flexibility of Bridging Alkyl Chains on&#160;the&#160;Proximity of Stacked Porphyrin and Phthalocyanine Conjugated with Fourfold Rotaxane Linkage</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The spatial distance is an important factor in controlling the functional interactions between molecular units in a conjugate; therefore, the bridging unit was closely examined.&#160; Herein, we examined the effect of the flexibility of bridging alkyl chains &#160;on the proximity of stacked porphyrin and phthalocyanine conjugated with a fourfold rotaxane linkage. We found that closely stacking two&#160; &#960; &#160;systems&#160;requires bridging alkyl chains above&#160;a certain length, and the shorter bridges hinder stacking because of their lower flexibility. The stacking distance between porphyrin and phthalocyanine in the conjugate with decyl (C10) chains was estimated to be 4.03 &#197; and showed&#160;a unique physical character&#160;arising from short&#8208;distance interactions. The&#160;longer alkyl chains minimized steric restriction inside the fourfold rotaxane and allowed efficient communication between the porphyrin and phthalocyanine units. This is due to the flexibility of the side chains.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>This article reports supramolecular polymerization of two naphthalene&#8208;diimide (NDI) building blocks (NDI&#8208;L and NDI&#8208;C) in&#160;n&#8208;heptane (Hep) and methylcyclohexane (MCH). NDI&#8208;L and NDI&#8208;C differ only by the peripheral hydrocarbon wedges, consisting of linear C7 chains or cyclic methylcyclohexane rings, respectively. UV/Vis and FT&#8208;IR spectra&#160;reveal distinct internal&#8208;order and H&#8208;bonding&#160; for NDI&#8208;L and NDI&#8208;C aggregates irrespective of the solvent, indicating a dominant role of the intrinsic packing parameters of the individual building block. However, NDI&#8208;L produces a significantly stronger gel in Hep compared to MCH. In contrast, NDI&#8208;C exhibits a clear preference for MCH, producing gel with moderate strength but in Hep it fails to produce 1D morphology or gel. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation studies corroborate with the experimental results and provide a quantitative estimate regarding the thermodynamics of self&#8208;assembly in these four combinations. Such clear&#8208;cut shape&#8208;matching effect (between the peripheral hydrocarbon wedge and the solvent system) unambiguously support a direct participation of the solvent molecules during supramolecular polymerization and presence of a closely&#8208;adhered solvent shell around the supramolecular polymers, similar to the first layer of water molecules around the protein surface. Solvent induced CD experiments support this hypothesis as induced CD band was observed only from a chiral co&#8208;solvent of matching shape. This is reconfirmed by the higher de&#8208;solvation temperature of the shape&#8208;matching NDI/solvent system combination compared to the shape mis&#8208;match combination in variable temperature UV/Vis experiments, revealing transformation to a different aggregate at higher temperatures rather than disassembly to the monomer for all four combinations.</dc:description>

         <title>Breaking the Aliphatic Wall: Iridium&#8208;Catalyzed Direct Reductive Amination of Ketones and Secondary Amines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Direct reductive amination (DRA) is a ubiquitous reaction in organic chemistry. This transformation between a carbonyl group and an amine is most often achieved using super stoichiometric amount of hazardous hydride reagents, thus being incompatible with many sensitive functional groups. DRA could also be achieved by means of chemo&#8208; or bio&#8208;catalysis, thereby attracting the interest of industry as well as academic laboratories due to their virtually perfect atomeconomy. Although DRA are well&#8208;established for substrate pairs such as aldehydes with either 1 o or 2 o amines as well as ketones with 1 o amines, the current methodologies are limited in the case of ketones with 2 o amines. Herein, we present a general DRA protocol that overcomes this major limitation by means of iridium catalysis. The applicability of the methodology is demonstrated by accessing an unprecedented range of biologically relevant tertiary amines starting from both aliphatic ketones and aliphatic amines. The choice of a disphosphane ligand (Josiphos A or Xantphos) is essential for the success of the transformation.</dc:description>

These complexes were prepared by treatment of the parent RE&#8208;triamides with an N&#8208;heterocyclic olefin (NHO), where an NHO backbone proton undergoes a formal 1,4&#8208;proton migration to the NHO&#8208;methylene group. For all RE(III) metals, as expected, quantum chemical calculations suggest only a&#160; &#963; &#8208; component to the metal&#8208;carbene bonding, in contrast to a previously reported uranium(III) congener where the 5f  3  &#160;metal engages in a weak&#160; &#960; &#8208;back&#8208;bond to the MIC. All complexes were characterized by static variable&#8208;temperature magnetic measurements, and dynamic magnetic measurements reveal that&#160;  3Dy  &#160;and&#160;  3Er  &#160;are field&#8208;induced single&#8208;molecule magnets (SMMs), with&#160; U  eff  &#160;energy barriers of 35 and 128 K, respectively.

         <title>Excited&#8208;state distortions promote the photochemical 4&#960;&#8208;electrocyclizations of fluorobenzenes via machine learning accelerated photodynamics simulations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The photochemistry of benzene is complex and non&#8208;selective because numerous mechanistic pathways are accessible in the ground and excited states. Fluorination is a known strategy to increase the chemoselectivities for Dewar&#8208;benzenes via 4&#960;&#8208;disrotatory electrocyclization. However, the origin of the chemo&#8208; and regioselectivities of fluorobenzenes remains unexplained because of experimental limitations in resolving the excited&#8208;state structures on ultrafast timescales. The computational cost of multiconfigurational nonadiabatic molecular dynamics simulations is also generally prohibitive. We now provide high&#8208;fidelity structural information and reaction outcome predictions with machine&#8208;learning&#8208;accelerated photodynamics simulations of a series of fluorobenzenes, C  6  F  6&#8208;n  H  n  , n=0&#8211;3, to study their S  1  &#8594;S  0  decay in 4 ns. We trained neural networks with XMS&#8208;CASPT2(6,7)/aug&#8208;cc&#8208;pVDZ calculations, which reproduced the S  1  absorption features with mean absolute errors of 0.04 eV (&lt; 2 nm). The predicted nonradiative decay constants for C  6  F  4  H  2  , C  6  F  6  , C  6  F  3  H  3  , and C  6  F  5  H are 116, 60, 28, and 12 ps, respectively, in line with the experiments. Our calculations show that the pseudo Jahn&#8208;Teller distortions create the S  1  minimum region that prolongs the excited&#8208;state lifetime of fluorobenzenes. The pseudo Jahn&#8208;Teller distortions reduce when fluorination decreases. Analysis of the S  1  dynamics suggests that the pseudo&#8208;Jahn&#8208;Teller distortions promote a  cis&#8208;trans  isomerization of a &#120587;  C&#8208;C  &#8208;bond. We characterized the surface hopping points from our NAMD simulations and identified instantaneous nuclear momentum as a factor that promoted &#120590;&#8208;bond formation in the 4&#960;&#8208;electrocyclization.</dc:description>

         <title>Strong Antibiotic Activity of the Myxocoumarin Scaffold in vitro and in vivo</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Myxocoumarin B from Stigmatella aurantiaca MYX&#8208;030 is shown to possess strong antibiotic activity against a range of clinically relevant pathogens. Synthesis of a diverse compound library of structural analogs enabled investigations into initial structure&#8208;activity relationships and revealed the potential of the myxocoumarin scaffold as lead structure for the development of new antibiotics. Myxocoumarin B and analogs show low toxicity in&#8197;vivo in a zebrafish infection model and were superior in clearing bacterial infections when compared to established antibiotics such as vancomycin.







Abstract
The increasing emergence of resistances against established antibiotics is a substantial threat to human health. The discovery of new compounds with potent antibiotic activity is thus of utmost importance. Within this work, we identify strong antibiotic activity of the natural product myxocoumarin B from Stigmatella aurantiaca MYX&#8208;030 against a range of clinically relevant bacterial pathogens, including clinical isolates of MRSA. A focused library of structural analogs was synthesized to explore initial structure&#8208;activity relationships and to identify equipotent myxocoumarin derivatives devoid of the natural nitro substituent to significantly streamline synthetic access. The cytotoxicity of the myxocoumarins as well as their potential to cure bacterial infections in vivo was established using a zebrafish model system. Our results reveal the exceptional antibiotic activity of the myxocoumarin scaffold and hence its potential for the development of novel antibiotics.

Synthesis of a diverse compound library of structural analogs enabled investigations into initial structure-activity relationships and revealed the potential of the myxocoumarin scaffold as lead structure for the development of new antibiotics. Myxocoumarin B and analogs show low toxicity &lt;i&gt;in&#8197;vivo&lt;/i&gt; in a zebrafish infection model and were superior in clearing bacterial infections when compared to established antibiotics such as vancomycin.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The increasing emergence of resistances against established antibiotics is a substantial threat to human health. The discovery of new compounds with potent antibiotic activity is thus of utmost importance. Within this work, we identify strong antibiotic activity of the natural product myxocoumarin B from &lt;i&gt;Stigmatella aurantiaca&lt;/i&gt; MYX-030 against a range of clinically relevant bacterial pathogens, including clinical isolates of MRSA. A focused library of structural analogs was synthesized to explore initial structure-activity relationships and to identify equipotent myxocoumarin derivatives devoid of the natural nitro substituent to significantly streamline synthetic access. The cytotoxicity of the myxocoumarins as well as their potential to cure bacterial infections &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; was established using a zebrafish model system. Our results reveal the exceptional antibiotic activity of the myxocoumarin scaffold and hence its potential for the development of novel antibiotics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Chemo&#8208; and regioselective anionic Fries rearrangement promoted by lithium amides under aerobic conditions in sustainable reaction media</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A straightforward and efficient protocol to promote the metalation/anionic Fries rearrangements of O&#8208;aryl carbamates, using for the first time a lithium amide as metalating agent under aerobic/ambient&#8208;friendly reaction conditions, is reported. This approach enables the sustainable preparation of salicylamide derivatives with high levels of chemoselectivity within ultrafast reaction times, working at room temperature in the presence of air/moisture, and using the environmentally responsive cyclopentyl methyl ether as a solvent. Furthermore, the regioselective manipulation of O&#8208;2&#8208;tolyl carbamates has been accomplished using interchangeably alkyllithiums or lithium amides, with an unexpected beneficial contribution from the employment of biorenewable protic eutectic mixtures as non&#8208;innocent reaction media.</dc:description>

         <title>Cross&#8208;talks between Sulfane Sulfur and Thiol at a Zinc(II) Site</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Transformations of sulfane sulfur compounds (  e.g.  &#160; organic&#160; polysulfides (R &#8211;S  n  &#8211;R, n&gt;2) and elemental sulfur (S  8  ) ) play pivotal roles in the biochemical landscape of sulfur, and thus supports signaling activities of H  2  S. Although a number of previous reports illustrate amine mediated reactions of S  8  &#160;and thiol (RSH) yielding R &#8211;S  n  &#8211;R , this report illustrates that a tripodal [Zn  II  ] complex [(  Bn  3  Tren  )Zn  II  &#8211;OH  2  ](ClO  4  )  2  &#160;(  1  ) facilitates the reactions of sulfane sulfur and thiol (RSH), thereby offering an amine&#8208;free biologically relevant complementary route.&#160;UV&#8208;vis monitoring of the reactions and a set of control experiments underline the definitive role of [Zn  II  ] coordination motif in the reactions of sulfane sulfur (  e.g.  &#160;S  8  &#160;and R&#8211;S  n  &#8211;R) with RSH.&#160; Detailed investigations (UV&#8208;vis, NMR, ESI&#8208;MS, intermediate trapping, and TEMPO radical interference experiments) disclose the key differences in the [Zn  II  ]&#160;  versus  &#160;previously known amine mediated routes. Moreover, the persulfide (RSS  &#8211;  ) trapping experiments using 1&#8208;fluoro&#8208;2,4&#8208;dinitrobenzene (F&#8211;DNB) reveal the intermediacy of RSS  &#8211;  &#160;species in the [Zn  II  ] mediated reactions of sulfane sulfur and thiol, thereby demonstrating [Zn  II  ] assisted persulfidation of thiol in the presence of sulfane sulfur species.

         <title>Boosting Electrocatalytic Oxygen Evolution over Ce&#8722;Co9S8 Core&#8211;Shell Nanoneedle Arrays by Electronic and Architectural Dual Engineering</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Rare&#8208;earth&#8208;based nanomaterials for catalysis: Ce&#8208;doped Co9S8 core&#8211;shell nanoneedle arrays, vertically aligned on carbon cloth (Ce&#8722;Co9S8@CC) were prepared in&#8197;situ by calcining a Ce&#8722;Co(CO3)0.5OH@CC precursor. The Ce&#8208;incorporated Co9S8 active component and core&#8211;shell nanoneedle arrayed architecture give Ce&#8722;Co9S8@CC a refigured electronic configuration, highly exposed active sites and multidimensional mass diffusion channels. Benefitting from these dual electronic and architectural advantages, Ce&#8722;Co9S8@CC exhibits superior electrocatalytic activity, stability and selectivity toward the oxygen evolution reaction.







Abstract
An dual electronic and architectural engineering strategy is a good way to rationally design earth&#8208;abundant and highly efficient electrocatalysts of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) for sustainable hydrogen&#8208;based energy devices. Here, a Ce&#8208;doped Co9S8 core&#8211;shell nanoneedle array (Ce&#8722;Co9S8@CC) supported on a carbon cloth has been designed and developed to accelerate the sluggish kinetics of the OER. Profiting from valance alternative Ce doping, a fine core&#8211;shell structure and vertically aligned nanoneedle arrayed architecture, Ce&#8722;Co9S8@CC integrates modulated electronic structure, highly exposed active sites, and multidimensional mass diffusion channels; together, these afford a favorable catalyzed OER. Ce&#8722;Co9S8@CC exhibits remarkable performance in the OER in an alkaline medium, where the overpotential requires only 242&#8197;mV to deliver a current density of 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 for the OER; this is 70&#8197;mV superior to that of Ce&#8208;free Co9S8 catalyst and other counterparts. Good stability and impressive selectivity (nearly 100&#8201;% Faradic efficiency) are also demonstrated. When integrated into a two&#8208;electrode OER//HER electrolyzer, the as&#8208;prepared Ce&#8722;Co9S8@CC displays a low operation potential of 1.54&#8197;V at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and long&#8208;term stability, thus demonstrating great potential for economical water electrolysis.

         <title>Cobalt Complexes Supported by Phosphinoquinoline Ligands for the Catalyzed Hydrosilylation of Carbonyl Compounds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Phosphinoquinoline cobalt(II) complexes were used for the hydrosilylation of ketones. The diisopropylphosphino containing bisliganded complex was the most efficient allowing the transformation of variously substituted aliphatic or aromatic ketones at low catalyst loading and under mild conditions. The involvement of a Co&#8722;H complex as the active species was experimentally ascertained.







Abstract
P,N phosphinoquinoline based ligands differing by the nature of the phosphorus substituent (iPr, Ph) were employed to synthesize a series of cobalt(II) complexes ([LCoBr2], [L2CoBr](PF6) and [L&#8217;2CoBr](PF6)). The latter were obtained in high yield and characterized among others by X&#8208;ray analysis and elemental analysis. Complex [L2CoBr](PF6) showed a very good catalytic activity for the hydrosilylation of various ketones. The catalysis proceeds at a low catalytic loading (1&#8197;mol&#8201;%) with only 1 equivalent of Ph2SiH2 in mild conditions and was efficient with aliphatic or aromatic ketones giving moderate to excellent yields of the corresponding silylated ether.

         <title>How the Chalcogen Atom Size Dictates the Hydrogen&#8208;Bond Donor Capability of Carboxamides, Thioamides, and Selenoamides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The bigger the better! Thioamides and selenoamides are better hydrogen&#8208;bond donors than carboxamides because their amino groups are more positively charged. Quantum chemical analyses reveal that this counterintuitive phenomenon, which is not explainable by the electronegativity, results from the effective steric size of the chalcogen atoms.







Abstract
The amino groups of thio&#8208; and selenoamides can act as stronger hydrogen&#8208;bond donors than of carboxamides, despite the lower electronegativity of S and Se. This phenomenon has been experimentally explored, particularly in organocatalysis, but a sound electronic explanation is lacking. Our quantum chemical investigations show that the NH2 groups in thio&#8208; and selenoamides are more positively charged than in carboxamides. This originates from the larger electronic density flow from the nitrogen lone pair of the NH2 group towards the lower&#8208;lying &#960;*C=S and &#960;*C=Se orbitals than to the high&#8208;lying &#960;*C=O orbital. The relative energies of the &#960;* orbitals result from the overlap between the chalcogen np and carbon 2p atomic orbitals, which is set by the carbon&#8208;chalcogen equilibrium distance, a consequence of the Pauli repulsion between the two bonded atoms. Thus, neither the electronegativity nor the often&#8208;suggested polarizability but the steric size of the chalcogen atom determines the amide's hydrogen&#8208;bond donor capability.

         <title>First&#8208;Principles Design of Na&#8208;ion Superionic Conductors: Interstitial&#8208;Based Na Diffusion in NaCuZrS3</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Solid&#8208;state electrolytes are usually based on vacancies of diffusing ions to enhance diffusivity. NaCuZrS3 with a post&#8208;perovskite&#8208;like structure exhibits an interstitial&#8208;based Na ion diffusion mechanism. The low diffusion barriers of the order of 0.22&#8197;eV in the two &#8208; dimensional interlayer channels suggest a new class of Na&#8208;ion superionic conductors for further exploration. Doping by trivalent ions (such as La) on Zr sites could help introduce Na interstitials.







Abstract
In recent years all&#8208;solid&#8208;state sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SS&#8208;SIBs) have drawn significant attention due to their potential to be safer and lower cost than lithium&#8208;ion batteries. However, the lack of sodium solid&#8208;state electrolytes with high ionic conductivity has become one of the major challenges. Here, with first&#8208;principles computation we took NaCuZrS3, consisting of earth&#8208;abundant and environmentally benign elements only, as an example to study Na&#8208;ion transport in the post&#8208;perovskite&#8208;like structure and used computation&#8208;guided design to improve its potential as a solid&#8208;state electrolyte. With ab initio molecular dynamics simulation and nudged elastic band calculation, we studied possible diffusion mechanisms in this material and found that Na ion interstitials have a favorable migration barrier of 0.22&#8197;eV, which is among the smallest in the literature reported values. Considering the large formation energy of Frenkel defects, we proposed doping strategy to introduce extra Na interstitials in the material. Our study suggests that the post&#8208;perovskite&#8208;like sulfides are worth of exploration for applications in SS&#8208;SIBs.

         <title>Design of Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Phenothiazine Derivatives with Triplet&#8208;Related Dual Emission and High&#8208;Contrast Mechanochromism Guided by Polymorph Prediction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The potential conformations of phenothiazine derivatives were well predicted by Polymorph Prediction. The crystals of those derivatives with the potential to form both quasi&#8208;axial (ax) and quasi&#8208;equatorial (eq) conformations could undergo conformation transition and showed high&#8208;contrast mechanochromism (MC). All the derivatives exhibited aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) and triplet&#8208;related dual emission (DEM) characters.







Abstract
The development of high&#8208;contrast stimulus&#8208;responsive materials with excited triplet emission is of great significance for anti&#8208;counterfeiting, sensor and memory applications, but remains a challenge. Here, we report a strategy for the rational design of stimulus&#8208;responsive phenothiazine derivatives with triplet&#8208;related dual emissions and high&#8208;contrast mechanochromism guided by Polymorph Prediction. The designed phenothiazine derivatives have the characters of simple structures, a facile synthetic procedure, and a good crystalline nature. We found that the crystals of those derivatives with the potential to form both quasi&#8208;axial (ax) and quasi&#8208;equatorial (eq) conformations could undergo conformation transition and show significant emission difference (&#916;&#955;em&gt;100&#8197;nm) under mechanical force. Meanwhile, all these phenothiazine derivatives exhibit aggregation&#8208;induced emission and emit room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence or thermally activated delayed fluorescence. The significant luminescent change of these materials under different stimuli gives them promise for applications in encryption and anti&#8208;counterfeiting.

         <title>Large Enhancement of the Single&#8208;Molecular Conductance of a Molecular Wire through a Radical Substituent</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The molecular conductance of radical&#8208;substituted molecular wire was evaluated by STM apparent&#8208;height measurement compared with a non&#8208;radical&#8208;substituted wire. Statistical analysis of the STM images revealed that the radical&#8208;substituted wire has a 3.2&#8208;fold larger conductance. Although only 17&#8201;% of the SOMO is calculated to exist on the wire moiety, the effect was significant. This study presents the potential of radical substituents to achieve high conductivity in molecular wires. More information can be found in the Research Article by K. Matsuda and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202104242).

         <title>Acenaphthenoannulation Induced by the Dual Lewis Acidity of Alumina</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The dual Lewis acidity of &#947;&#8208;alumina is reported to enable rapid &#960;&#8208;extension of readily available building blocks through the tandem activation of &#8220;soft&#8221; triple C&#8722;C bonds and hard C&#8722;F bonds. The reaction gives facile access to elusive non&#8208;alternant polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons such as &#960;&#8208;extended helicenes and geodesic carbon nanoribbon fragments.







Abstract
We have discovered a dual (i.&#8201;e., soft and hard) Lewis acidity of alumina that enables rapid one&#8208;pot &#960;&#8208;extension through the activation of terminal alkynes followed by C&#8722;F activation. The tandem reaction introduces an acenaphthene fragment &#8211; an essential moiety of geodesic polyarenes. This reaction provides quick access to elusive non&#8208;alternant polyarenes such as &#960;&#8208;extended buckybowls and helicenes through three&#8208;point annulation of the 1&#8208;(2&#8208;ethynyl&#8208;6&#8208;fluorophenyl)naphthalene moiety. The versatility of the developed method was demonstrated by the synthesis of unprecedented structural fragments of elusive geodesic graphene nanoribbons.

         <title>Anomeric Stereoauxiliary Cleavage of the C&#8722;N Bond of d&#8208;Glucosamine for the Preparation of Imidazo[1,5&#8208;a]pyridines</title>

The G&#228;nseliesel showcases the scientific magic in G&#246;ttingen! Scientific magic on the &#945;&#8208;anomer of d&#8208;glucosamine helps the targeted cleavage of C&#8722;N bonds in d&#8208;glucosamine (&#945;&#8208;2&#176; amine) from biobased resources and the conjunction of nitrogen in the synthesis of imidazo[1,5&#8208;a]pyridines. This new approach expands the scope of readily accessible imidazo[1,5&#8208;a]pyridines relative to existing state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art methods. A key strategic advantage of this approach is that the &#945;&#8208;anomer of d&#8208;glucosamine enables C&#8722;N bond cleavage through a seven&#8208;membered&#8208;ring transition state. More information can be found in the Research Article by K. Zhang and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202200648).

         <title>Chiral fibers formation upon assembly of tetraphenylalanine peptide conjugated to a PNA dimer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Self&#8208;assembly of biomolecules such as peptides, nucleic acids or their analogues affords supramolecular objects, exhibiting structures and physical properties dependent on the amino&#8208;acid or nucleobase composition. Conjugation of the peptide diphenylalanine (FF) to peptide nucleic acids triggers formation of self&#8208;assembled structures, mainly stabilized by interactions between FF. In this work we report formation of homogeneous chiral fibers upon self&#8208;assembly of the hybrid composed of the tetraphenylalanine peptide (4F) conjugated to the PNA dimer adenine&#8208;thymine (at). In this case nucleobases seem to play a key role in determining the morphology and chirality of the fibers. When the PNA &#8220;at&#8221; is replaced by guanine&#8208;cytosine dimer &#8220;gc&#8221;, disordered structures are observed. Spectroscopic characterization of the self&#8208;assembled hybrids, along with AFM and SEM studies is reported. Finally, a structural model consistent with the experimental evidences has also been obtained, showing how the building blocks of 4Fat arrange to give helical fibers.</dc:description>

         <title>New Frame for a Classic System: Exploring the Reactivity of B&#8208;connected Carboranylphosphines in Frustrated Lewis Pair Chemistry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The primary phosphines MesPH  2  and  t  &#8208;BuPH  2  react with 9&#8208;iodo&#8208;  m  &#8208;carborane yielding B9&#8208;connected secondary carboranylphosphines 1,7&#8208;H  2  C  2  B  10  H  9  &#8208;9&#8208;PHR, R = 2,4,6&#8208;Me  3  C  6  H  2  (Mes) (  1a  ),  t&#8208;  Bu (  1b  )). Addition of tris(pentafluorophenyl)borane (BCF) to  1a,b  resulted in the zwitterionic compounds 1,7&#8208;H  2  C  2  B  10  H  9  &#8208;9&#8208;PHR(  p  &#8208;C  6  F  4  )BF(C  6  F  5  )  2  (  2a,b  ) through nucleophilic  para  substitution of a C  6  F  5  ring followed by fluoride transfer to boron. Further reaction with Me  2  SiHCl prompted an H&#8211;F exchange yielding the zwitterionic compounds 1,7&#8208;H  2  C  2  B  10  H  9  &#8208;9&#8208;PHR(  p  &#8208;C  6  F  4  )BH(C  6  F  5  )  2  (  3a,b  ). The reaction of  2a,b  with one equivalent of R&#8217;MgBr (R&#8217; = Me, Ph) gave the extremely water&#8208;sensitive frustrated Lewis pairs 1,7&#8208;H  2  C  2  B  10  H  9  &#8208;9&#8208;PR(  p  &#8208;C  6  F  4  )B(C  6  F  5  )  2  (  4a,b  ). Hydrolysis of the B&#8211;C6F4  bond in  4a,b  gave the first tertiary  B  &#8208;carboranyl phosphines with three distinct substituents, 1,7&#8208;H2C2B10H9  &#8208;9&#8208;PR(p&#8208;C6F4H) (5a,b). Deprotonation of the zwitterionic compounds  2a,b  and  3a,b  resulted in the formation of anionic phosphines [1,7&#8208;H2C2B10H9&#8208;9&#8208;PR(p&#8208;C6F4)BX(C6F5)2]&#8208;  [DMSOH]  +  (R = Mes, X = F (  6a  ), R =  t  &#8208;Bu, X = F (  6b  ); R = Mes, X = H (  7a  ), R  =  t  &#8208;Bu, X = H (  7b  )). Reaction of  2a,b  with an excess of Grignard reagents resulted in addition of R&#8217; at the boron atom yielding the anions [1,7&#8208;H2C2B10H9&#8208;9&#8208;PR(  p  &#8208;C  6  F  4  )BR&#8217;(C  6  F  5  )  2  ]  &#8208;  (R = Mes, R&#8217; = Me (  8a  ), R  =  t  &#8208;Bu, R&#8217; = Me (  8b  ); R = Mes, R&#8217; = Ph (  9a  ), R  =  t  &#8208;Bu, R&#8217; = Ph (  9b  )) with [MgBr(Et  2  O)  n  ]  +  as counterion. The ability of the zwitterionic compounds  3a,b  to hydrogenate imines as well as the Br&#248;nsted acidity of  3a  were investigated.</dc:description>

         <title>Efficient Electrochemical Reduction of CO2 to Formate in Methanol Solutions by Mn Functionalized Electrodes in the Presence of Amines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Carbon cloth electrode modified by covalently attaching a manganese organometallic catalyst is used as cathode for the electrochemical reduction of CO  2  in methanol solutions. Six different industrial amines are employed as co&#8208;catalyst in millimolar concentrations to deliver a series of new reactive system. While such absorbents were so far believed to provide a CO  2  reservoir and act as sacrificial proton source, we herein demonstrate that this role can be played by methanol, and that the adduct formed between CO  2  and the amine can act as an effector or inhibitor toward the catalyst, thereby enhancing or reducing the production of formate. Pentamethyldiethylentriamine (  PMDETA),  identified as the best effector in our series, converts CO  2  in wet methanolic solution into bisammonium bicarbonate. Computational studies revealed that this adduct is responsible for a barrierless transformation of CO  2  to formate by the reduced form of the Mn catalyst covalently bonded to the electrode surface. As a consequence, selectivity can be switched on demand from CO to formate anion, and in the case of (  PMDETA  ) an impressive TON  HCOO&#8211;  of 2.8&#215;10  4  can be reached. This new valuable knowledge on an integrated capture and utilization system paves the way toward more efficient transformation of CO  2  into liquid fuel.</dc:description>

         <title>Identifying the Molecular Origins of Green BN&#8208;TADF Material Degradation and Device Stability via In&#8208;situ Raman Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>There is little investigation into the impact of molecular conformation on device efficiency and degradation of boron&#8208;nitrogen thermally activated delayed fluorescence emitters (BN&#8208;TADF). Herein, three highly&#8208;efficient green BN&#8208;TADF emitters have been designed to unveil the impact of peripheral phenyl groups on device efficiencies and lifetimes. Compared to BN&#8208;PhOH with the lowest EQE max of 19%, BN&#8208;PhOCH 3 and BN&#8208;PhN(CH 3 ) 2 have achieved strongly enhanced EQE max of 25.6% and 24.1%, respectively. Importantly, the device lifetimes (LT 50 ) are dramatically improved from 1.7 h of BN&#8208;PhOH to 4.4 h of BN&#8208;PhOCH 3 and 7.7 h of BN&#8208;PhN(CH 3 ) 2 without encapsulation. According to in&#8208;situ Raman spectroscopy and simulations, BN&#8208;PhN(CH 3 ) 2 of less conformation change after aging exhibits the best photostability. We proposed the torsion angle change between the BN core and the peripheral phenyl group results in BN&#8208;TADF degradation. This knowledge means precisely tuning peripheral groups of BN&#8208;TADF can achieve both higher device efficiencies and longer lifetimes.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;There is little investigation into the impact of molecular conformation on device efficiency and degradation of boron-nitrogen thermally activated delayed fluorescence emitters (BN-TADF). Herein, three highly-efficient green BN-TADF emitters have been designed to unveil the impact of peripheral phenyl groups on device efficiencies and lifetimes. Compared to BN-PhOH with the lowest EQE max of 19%, BN-PhOCH 3 and BN-PhN(CH 3 ) 2 have achieved strongly enhanced EQE max of 25.6% and 24.1%, respectively. Importantly, the device lifetimes (LT 50 ) are dramatically improved from 1.7 h of BN-PhOH to 4.4 h of BN-PhOCH 3 and 7.7 h of BN-PhN(CH 3 ) 2 without encapsulation. According to in-situ Raman spectroscopy and simulations, BN-PhN(CH 3 ) 2 of less conformation change after aging exhibits the best photostability. We proposed the torsion angle change between the BN core and the peripheral phenyl group results in BN-TADF degradation. This knowledge means precisely tuning peripheral groups of BN-TADF can achieve both higher device efficiencies and longer lifetimes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Impact of N&#8208;aryl&#8208; and NHC core&#8208;substituents on the coupling of alkylzinc nucleophiles: Is bigger always better?</title>

         <dc:description>Bulky Pd&#8208;N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) catalysts (e.g., N&#8208;(di&#8208;2,6&#8208;(3&#8208;pentyl)phenyl),&#160;IPent) have been shown to have significantly higher reactivity in a wide variety of cross&#8208;coupling applications (i.e., C&#8208;C, C&#8208;S, C&#8208;N) than less hindered variants (e.g., N&#8208;(di&#8208;2,6&#8208;(isopropyl)phenyl),&#160;IPr). Further, chlorinating the backbone of the NHC ring sees and even greater increase in reactivity. In the cross&#8208;coupling of (hetero)aryl electrophiles to secondary alkyl nucleophiles, making the N&#8208;aryl groups larger reduces the amount of&#160;b&#8208;hydride elimination leading to alkene byproducts and chlorinating the NHC core had an even greater effect, all but eliminating alkene formation. In this study involving the cross&#8208;coupling of&#160;1&#186;alkyl electrophiles and nucleophiles, a sharp and surprising reversal of all of the above trends was observed. Bulkier catalysts had generally slower rate of reaction and&#160;b&#8208;hydride elimination worsened leading to extensive amounts of alkene byproducts.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hybrid organic&#8208;inorganic perovskite (HOIP) have received tremendous scientific attention because of the phase transition and photovoltaic properties. However, achieving the special perovskite structure with both two&#8208;step dielectric response and luminescence characteristics is rarely reported. Herein, we report an organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid perovskite, [(BA)  2  &#11827;PbI  4  ] ( BA = n&#8208;butylamine) by introducing flexible organic cations (HBA  +  ), with direct mid&#8208;band gap as 2.28 eV. Interestingly, this material exhibits two&#8208;step reversible dielectric response at 350 K and 460 K (in heating process), respectively. Besides, the photoluminescence was found: it emits charming green light under 365 nm lamp (Photoluminescence quantum yield is 9.52 %). The outstanding two&#8208;step dielectric response and luminescence characteristics of this compound might pave the way for the application of dielectric and ferroelectric functional materials in temperature sensors and mechanical switches</dc:description>

         <title>Deposition of Vertically Aligned Ag/Ag2S Nanoflakes on EGaIn Particles for Humidity Sensing</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Core&#8211;shell EGaIn/Ag particles were prepared in an ultrasonication assisted galvanic replacement reaction, and were subsequently transformed into EGaIn/Ag/Ag2S by a partial sulfurization. A humidity sensor based on the EGaIn/Ag/Ag2S particles showed superior sensing response to EGaIn and EGaIn/Ag due to the silver sulfide in the composites; two conduction mechanisms take place simultaneously.







Abstract
Liquid metals, which possess both good electrical conductivity and liquid&#8208;like processability, have drawn much attention recently. They are also capable of acting as synthesis templates to guide the deposition of other functional materials. Herein, through an in&#8208;situ galvanic replacement reaction assisted by ultrasonication, core&#8211;shell EGaIn/Ag particles composed of EGaIn cores and vertically aligned Ag nanoflakes as shells were prepared; they were further sulfurized to yield ternary EGaIn/Ag/Ag2S core&#8211;shell composite particles. A humidity sensor based on EGaIn/Ag/Ag2S particles showed much higher sensing response than EGaIn and EGaIn/Ag. Such superior performance could be attributed to the n&#8208;type semiconducting character of Ag2S allowing it to receive electrons from water molecules at low humidity, and its highly hydrophilic surface allowing it to absorb more water molecules at higher humidity so as to enable the formation of ion&#8208;conductive paths.

         <title>pH&#8208;Triggered Removal of Nitrogenous Organic Micropollutants from Water by Using Metal&#8208;Organic Polyhedra</title>

MOPping up micropollutants: A new pH&#8208;triggered pollutant&#8208;removal methodology that uses water&#8208;soluble metal&#8208;organic polyhedra (MOPs) as coordinative capturing agents removes nitrogenous organic micropollutants from water. The exohedral coordination positions in the MOP structure are harnessed to coordinatively sequester the coordinating pollutants, while the exposed surface carboxyl groups are used to control their solubility in water through acid/base reactions. Benzotriazole (BT), benzothiazole (BTZ), 1&#8208;napthylamine (NA) and isoquinoline (IQ) were selected to validate this methodology.







Abstract
Water pollution threatens human and environmental health worldwide. Thus, there is a pressing need for new approaches to water purification. Herein, we report a novel supramolecular strategy based on the use of a metal&#8208;organic polyhedron (MOP) as a capture agent to remove nitrogenous organic micropollutants from water, even at very low concentrations (ppm), based exclusively on coordination chemistry at the external surface of the MOP. Specifically, we exploit the exohedral coordination positions of RhII&#8208;MOP to coordinatively sequester pollutants bearing N&#8208;donor atoms in aqueous solution, and then harness their exposed surface carboxyl groups to control their aqueous solubility through acid/base reactions. We validated this approach for removal of benzotriazole, benzothiazole, isoquinoline, and 1&#8208;napthylamine from water.

A new 3D microarchitecture as a backbone to support the catalyst was prepared by combing with the synergy of high&#8208;strength ceramic fibers and ultrathin TiO2 nanosheets. The honeycomb ceramic exhibits a high volume&#8208;specific surface area of 3.59&#215;104&#8197;cm2/cm3, a compressive strength of 2.01&#8197;MPa. It also delivered a low light&#8208;off temperature of 150&#8201;&#176;C.







Abstract
Novel and stringent automotive exhaust gas emissions standards are urgently needed to counter the problems posed by the worsening global climate and environment. However, the traditional cordierite&#8208;based honeycomb ceramics substrates with ultimate pore density have seriously restricted the establishment of new emission standards. Herein, we introduce a novel robust substrate with tailored volume&#8208;specific surface area and low heat capacity. This substrate employs the synergy of high&#8208;strength ceramic fibers and ultrathin TiO2 nanosheets. The micro&#8208;sized fibers provide support to ensure structural strength during the catalytic reaction, while the nanosheets play the dual role of connecting the fibers and providing a high surface area for catalyst immobilization. The new three&#8208;dimensional (3D) microarchitecture exhibits a high volume&#8208;specific surface area of 3.59&#215;104&#8197;cm2/cm3, a compressive strength of 2.01&#8197;MPa, and remarkable stability after high&#8208;speed air erosion at 800&#8201;&#176;C. The honeycomb&#8208;like structure exhibit low resistance to gas flow. Furthermore, after loading with Pt and Pd nanoparticles, the composite 3D microarchitecture delivered an excellent catalytic performance and prominent structural stability, with a super low light&#8208;off temperature of 150&#8201;&#176;C. The outstanding mechanical and thermal stability and the high surface area and light&#8208;off temperature of the new substrate indicate its potential for use as a highly efficient catalytic carrier to meet the next&#8208;generation auto emissions standards.

         <title>Reversible and stepwise single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal transformation of a platinum(II) complex with vapochromic luminescence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The vapochromic single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal (SCSC) transformation of a highly luminescent Pt(II) complex bearing an N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene [Pt(CN)  2  (  t  Bu&#8208;impy)] (  t  Bu&#8208;impyH  +  = 1&#8208;  t  &#8208;butyl&#8208;3&#8208;(2&#8208;pyridyl)&#8208;1  H  &#8208;imidazolium) was reported. The trihydrate form of the complex, that exhibits blue  3  MMLCT emission owing to weak Pt&#183;&#183;&#183;Pt interactions, changed its luminescence color from blue to yellowish&#8208;green upon the desorption of water molecules keeping the high emission quantum yield more than 0.6. Variable&#8208;temperature and continuous in&#8208;situ tracking of single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction measurements revealed that the SCSC transformation proceeds reversibly by the release and reabsorption of water molecules changing the stacked structure slightly. As a result, the dynamics of vapor&#8208;induced SCSC transformation were elucidated that the anhydrous form returned to the original trihydrate form in a two&#8208;step process under a water vapor atmosphere. In addition, the Pt(II) complex exhibited a similar SCSC response accompanied by a luminescence color change in the presence of methanol vapor, while being inactive toward ethanol vapor.</dc:description>

         <title>A Mesoionic Diselenolene Anion and the Corresponding Radical Dianion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Being mesoionic makes the difference: A diselenolene ligand with fundamentally different electronic properties compared to a normal diselenolene is reported. Two stable redox states are accessible: a paramagnetic radical dianion and a diamagnetic monoanion. The ligand was used for the preparation of novel aluminum bis&#8208; and tris(diselenolene) complexes.







Abstract
Dichalcogenolenes are archetypal redox non&#8208;innocent ligands with numerous applications. Herein, a diselenolene ligand with fundamentally different electronic properties is described. A mesoionic diselenolene was prepared by selenation of a C2&#8208;protected imidazolium salt. This ligand is diamagnetic, which is in contrast to the paramagnetic nature of standard dichalcogenolene monoanions. The new ligand is also redox&#8208;active, as demonstrated by isolation of a stable diselenolene radical dianion. The unique electronic properties of the new ligand give rise to unusual coordination chemistry. Thus, preparation of a hexacoordinate aluminum tris(diselenolene) complex and a Lewis acidic aluminate complex with two ligand&#8208;centered unpaired electrons was achieved.

         <title>Constructing Atomic Fe and N Co&#8208;doped Hollow Carbon Nanospheres with a Polymer Encapsulation Strategy for High&#8208;Performance Lithium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries with Accelerated Polysulfide Conversion</title>

         <dc:description>
A polymer encapsulation strategy is designed to synthesize atomic Fe and N co&#8208;doped hollow carbon nanospheres (Fe&#8722;NHC) with Fe&#8722;Nx sites for modifying commercial PP separator of LSBs to suppress the shuttle effect and promote the sluggish kinetics of intermediate polysulfides. Therefore, the battery with the Fe&#8722;NHC/PP separator delivers outstanding cycling and rate performances. Even at a harsh current density of 4&#8197;C, a high capacity of 824&#8197;mA&#8201;h&#8201;g&#8722;1 is achieved, indicating the superiority of the Fe&#8208;NHC/PP separator in LSBs.







Abstract
As competitive next&#8208;generation rechargeable batteries, lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries (LSBs) suffer from the shuttle effect and the sluggish kinetics of intermediate polysulfides during charge and discharge processes, adversely affecting their electrochemical performances and actual applications. Herein, we demonstrate a polymer encapsulation strategy to synthesize atomic Fe and N co&#8208;doped hollow carbon nanospheres (Fe&#8722;NHC) with Fe&#8722;Nx sites for modifying commercial PP separator of LSBs to suppress the shuttle effect and promote the kinetics of intermediate polysulfides. Benefiting from the excellent structural design, the doped&#8208;N with positive charges could effectively adsorb negatively charged soluble polysulfides, help attract the soluble polysulfides to the Fe atoms and boost the catalytic transformation of the soluble polysulfides. Additionally, such a thin carbon shell could provide a short mass diffusion pathway and hence promote the adsorption and the catalytic conversion. Therefore, the battery with the Fe&#8722;NHC/PP separator delivers outstanding cycling and rate performances. At the large current density of 1&#8197;C, the specific capacity is 1079&#8197;mA&#8201;h&#8201;g&#8722;1 and maintains a low loss of 0.076&#8201;% per cycle within 500&#8197;cycles. Even at a harsh current density of 4&#8197;C, a high capacity of 824&#8197;mA&#8201;h&#8201;g&#8722;1 is still achieved, indicating the advantage of the Fe&#8722;NHC/PP separator in LSBs.

         <title>Halogenation of the Hexaphosphabenzene Complex [(Cp*Mo)2(&#956;,&#951;6:&#951;6&#8208;P6)]: Snapshots on the Reaction Progress</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Snapshots on the halogenation of the hexaphosphabenzene complex [(Cp*Mo)2(&#956;,&#951;6:&#951;6&#8208;P6)] show the plethora of complexes that are formed, resulting from the initial halogenation of the P6 ligand. Among them, with iodine, a compound with six P atoms still present could be obtained, directly at room temperature. With the more aggressive bromine and chlorine, the P6 unit degrades to an allylic P3 unit but phosphorus rich compounds could also be isolated.







Abstract
The oxidation of [(Cp*Mo)2(&#956;,&#951;6:&#951;6&#8208;P6)] (1) with halogens or halogen sources was investigated.

The reaction of 1 with the far stronger oxidizing agent PCl5 was followed via time&#8208; and temperature&#8208;dependent 31P{1H} NMR spectroscopy. One of the first intermediates detected at 193&#8197;K was [(Cp*Mo)2(&#956;,&#951;3:&#951;3&#8208;P3)(&#956;&#8208;PCl2)2][PCl6] (8) which rearranges upon warming to [(Cp*Mo)2(&#956;&#8208;PCl2)2(&#956;&#8208;Cl)2] (9), [(Cp*MoCl)2(&#956;,&#951;3:&#951;3&#8208;P3)(&#956;&#8208;PCl2)] (10) and [(Cp*Mo)2(&#956;,&#951;4:&#951;4&#8208;P4)(&#956;&#8208;PCl2)][Cp*MoCl4] (11), which could be isolated at room temperature. All complexes were characterized by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, NMR spectroscopy and their electronic structures were elucidated by DFT calculations.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Snapshots on the halogenation&lt;/b&gt; of the hexaphosphabenzene complex [(Cp*Mo)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(&#956;,&#951;&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;:&#951;&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;-P&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;)] show the plethora of complexes that are formed, resulting from the initial halogenation of the P&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; ligand. Among them, with iodine, a compound with six P atoms still present could be obtained, directly at room temperature. With the more aggressive bromine and chlorine, the P&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; unit degrades to an allylic P&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; unit but phosphorus rich compounds could also be isolated.

         <dc:description>
Development of efficient plasmonic nanocatalysts with high catalytic performance and efficient light harvesting properties is of vital importance. Herein, the authors rationally designed and synthesized a plasmonic nanocatalyst composed of Au&#8208;framed Pd nanocubes by an Ag(I)&#8208;assisted seed&#8208;mediated growth method. The unique Au&#8208;framed Pd nanocubes can integrate the superior electrocatalytic of Pd and the outstanding plasmonic properties of Au. Thus, these nanostructures were employed as plasmonic nanocatalysts for plasmon&#8208;enhanced electrocatalytic oxidation of ethanol with improved stability.







Abstract
Surface plasmon of coinage metal nanostructures has been employed as a powerful route in boosting the performances in heterogenous catalysis. Development of efficient plasmonic nanocatalysts with high catalytic performance and efficient light harvesting properties is of vital importance. Herein, we rationally designed and synthesized a plasmonic nanocatalyst composed of Au&#8208;framed Pd nanocubes by an Ag(I)&#8208;assisted seed&#8208;mediated growth method. In the synthesis, the incorporation of Ag(I) suppresses the reduction of Au on the {100} surface of cubic Pd seeds and leads to the formation of Au nanoframes on the Pd nanocubes. The unique Au&#8208;framed Pd nanocubes can integrate the superior electrocatalytic of Pd and the outstanding plasmonic properties of Au. Thus, these nanostructures were employed as plasmonic nanocatalysts for plasmon&#8208;enhanced electrocatalytic oxidation of ethanol with improved stability.

         <title>Reactions of a Four&#8208;Membered Borete with Carbon, Silicon, and Gallium Donor Ligands: Fused and Spiro&#8208;Type Boracycles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A four&#8208;membered naphthalene&#8208;supported borete is investigated as a masked 1,4&#8208;dipolar donor&#8208;acceptor cyclobutane. Ring expansion reactions confirm such type of reactivity and afford complex cyclic structures including fused and spiro&#8208;type polycyclics.







Abstract
Donor&#8208;acceptor cyclopropanes or cyclobutanes are dipolar reagents, which are widely used in the synthesis of complex organic (hetero)cycles in ring expansion reactions. Applying this concept to boron containing heterocycles, the four&#8208;membered borete cyclo&#8208;iPr2N&#8208;BC10H6 reacted with the carbon donor ligands 2,6&#8208;xylylisonitrile and the carbene IMes :C(NMesCH)2 with ring expansion and ring fusion, respectively. In particular, the tetracyclic structure formed with IMes displays zwitterionic character and absorption in the visible region. In contrast to the carbene IMes, the heavier carbenoids :Si(NDippCH)2 and :Ga(AmIm) with a two&#8208;coordinate donor atom afford spiro&#8208;type bicyclic compounds, which display four&#8208;coordinate geometry at silicon or gallium. (TD&#8208;)DFT calculations provide deeper insight into the mechanism of formation and the absorption properties of these new compounds.

Topotactic cation exchange on close&#8208;packed structures has recently emerged as a potent synthetic tactic for the preparation of many new functional solids. A synergistic blending of new functionality to an underlying three&#8208;dimensional structure can be achieved that, in many cases, yields a unique pathway to metastable solids with new and/or enhanced properties, such as for visible&#8208;light photocatalysts. For example, shown is the new semiconductor photocatalyst SZT (SnZr1/2Ti1/2O3) as a nano&#8208;shell on BZT (BaZr1/2Ti1/2O3).







Abstract
Recently, many new, complex, functional oxides have been discovered with the surprising use of topotactic ion&#8208;exchange reactions on close&#8208;packed structures, such as found for wurtzite, rutile, perovskite, and other structure types. Despite a lack of apparent cation&#8208;diffusion pathways in these structure types, synthetic low&#8208;temperature transformations are possible with the interdiffusion and exchange of functional cations possessing ns2 stereoactive lone pairs (e.&#8201;g., Sn(II)) or unpaired ndx electrons (e.&#8201;g., Co(II)), targeting new and favorable modulations of their electronic, magnetic, or catalytic properties. This enables a synergistic blending of new functionality to an underlying three&#8208;dimensional connectivity, i.&#8201;e., [&#8208;M&#8722;O&#8208;M&#8208;O&#8208;]n, that is maintained during the transformation. In many cases, this tactic represents the only known pathway to prepare thermodynamically unstable solids that otherwise would commonly decompose by phase segregation, such as that recently applied to the discovery of many new small bandgap semiconductors.

         <title>Direct Synthesis of An Aluminosilicate POS Zeolite with Intersecting 12&#215;11&#215;11&#8208;Member&#8208;Ring Pore Channels by Using a Designed Organic Structure&#8208;Directing Agent</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Large and extra&#8208;large pore zeolites have been widely applied in industrial areas as catalysts, adsorbents, etc. Among them, silica and/or aluminosilicate zeolites have been attracted great attention due to their excellent hydrothermal stability and strong acidity. However, a great deal of zeolite structures are still not available in the form of silica and/or aluminosilicate. Herein, we report the synthesis of pure silica and aluminosilicate large&#8208;pore zeolites, denoted as NUD&#8208;14 and Al&#8208;NUD&#8208;14, respectively, by using a designed cation 1&#8208;ethyl&#8208;4&#8208;phenylpyridinium as an organic structure&#8208;directing agent (OSDA). NUD&#8208;14 has an intersecting 12&#215;11&#215;11&#8208;member ring pore system, which is isostructural to the germanosilicate PUK&#8208;16 zeolite with a POS topology. The OSDAs can be completely removed from the framework by calcination. NUD&#8208;14 and Al&#8208;NUD&#8208;14 possess excellent acid and hydrothermal stabilities, superior to the germanosilicate POS zeolite. The incorporation of Al into the zeolite framework makes the Al&#8208;NUD&#8208;14 zeolite possess medium and strong acidities. The successful synthesis of NUD&#8208;14 consisting of a rare odd&#8208;membered ring pore structure may provide a platform for interesting size&#8208; and shape&#8208;selective catalytic applications.</dc:description>

         <title>1,2&#8208;Carboboration of Arylallenes by In Situ Generated Alkenylboranes for the Synthesis of 1,4&#8208;Dienes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A chemo&#8208; and regioselective 1,2&#8208;carboboration of arylallenes by alkenylboranes, formed in&#8197;situ by hydroboration of alkynes with Piers&#8217; borane (HB(C6F5)2) is reported. This novel 1,2&#8208;carboboration and a subsequent Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura coupling were used for the synthesis of twenty new aryl substituted 1,4&#8208;dienes.







Abstract
We herein report a novel method for the coupling of unactivated alkynes and arylallenes, which relies on an unprecedented and regioselective 1,2&#8208;carboboration of the allene by an alkenylborane. The alkenylborane is conveniently prepared in&#8197;situ by hydroboration of an alkyne with Piers&#8217; borane, i.&#8201;e., HB(C6F5)2. The boryl&#8208;substituted 1,4&#8208;dienes that are formed by this carboboration are well&#8208;suited for a subsequent Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura coupling with aryl iodides. This allowed us to develop a three&#8208;step, one&#8208;pot protocol for the synthesis of aryl&#8208;substituted 1,4&#8208;dienes. The generality of the reaction was demonstrated by the synthesis of twenty dienes with modular variations of all three reaction partners. The mechanism of the new 1,2&#8208;carboboration was investigated using dispersion corrected double&#8208;hybrid DFT computations that allowed us to rationalize the chemo&#8208; and regioselectivity of this key step.

This addition reaction, which represents a new easy approach to asymmetrically substituted  cyclo  &#8208;1,3&#8208;diphospha&#8208;2,4&#8208;diazanes, was investigated mechanistically by different spectroscopic methods (NMR, EPR, IR, Raman) as well as X&#8208;ray diffraction, suggesting a stepwise radical reaction mechanism, as evidenced by the  in&#8208;situ  detection of the phosphorus&#8208;centered monoradical [  &#8226;  P(  &#956;  &#8208;NTer)  2  P&#8208;R]. To provide further evidence for the radical mechanism, [  &#8226;  P(  &#956;  &#8208;NTer)  2  P&#8208;Et] (  3Et  &#8226;  ) was synthesized directly by reduction of the bromoethane addition product [Br&#8208;P(  &#956;  &#8208;NTer)  2  P&#8208;Et] (  2a  ) with magnesium, resulting in the formation of the new persistent phosphorus&#8208;centered monoradical [  &#8226;  P(  &#956;  &#8208;NTer)  2  P&#8208;Et], which could be isolated and fully characterized. Comparison of the EPR spectrum of the radical intermediate in the addition reaction with that of the synthesized new [  &#8226;  P(  &#956;  &#8208;NTer)  2  P&#8208;Et] radical clearly proves the existen&#173;ce of radicals in the course of the reaction of biradical [  &#8226;  P(  &#956;  &#8208;NTer)  2  P  &#8226;  ] (  1  ) with bromoethane.

         <title>Measurements and Utilization of Consistent Gibbs Energies of Transfer of Single Ions: Towards a Unified Redox Potential Scale for All Solvents</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Utilizing the &#8220;ideal&#8221; ionic liquid salt bridge for measurements of Gibbs energies of transfer of silver ions between the solvents water, acetonitrile, propylene carbonate and dimethylformamide results in a consistent data set with a precision of 0.6 kJ mol  &#8722;1  over 87 measurements in 10 half&#8208;cells. This forms the basis for a coherent experimental thermodynamic framework of ion solvation chemistry. In addition, we define the solvent independent pe  abs  H2O  &#8208; and the  E  abs  H2O  &#8208;values that account for the electronating potential of any redox system similar to the pH  abs  H2O  &#8208;value of a medium that accounts for its protonating potential. This  E  abs  H2O  &#8208;scale is thermodynamically well&#8208;defined enabling the straightforward comparability of the redox potentials (reducities) of all media with respect to the aqueous redox potential scale, hence unifying all conventional solvent&#180;s redox potential scales. Thus, using the herein published Gibbs energy of transfer of the silver ion one can convert and unify all hitherto published redox potentials measured for example against ferrocene to the  E  abs  H2O  &#8208;scale.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Utilizing the &#8220;ideal&#8221; ionic liquid salt bridge for measurements of Gibbs energies of transfer of silver ions between the solvents water, acetonitrile, propylene carbonate and dimethylformamide results in a consistent data set with a precision of 0.6 kJ mol  &#8722;1  over 87 measurements in 10 half-cells. This forms the basis for a coherent experimental thermodynamic framework of ion solvation chemistry. In addition, we define the solvent independent pe  abs  H2O  - and the  E  abs  H2O  -values that account for the electronating potential of any redox system similar to the pH  abs  H2O  -value of a medium that accounts for its protonating potential.

         <title>Irreversible Inhibition of IspG, a Target for the Development of New Antimicrobials, by a 2&#8208;Vinyl Analogue of its MEcPP Substrate</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A substrate analogue of MEcPP, a key intermediate in the MEP pathway, has been synthesized. The target compound features a vinyl functionality in place of the natural methyl substituent. Potent irreversible inhibition towards GcpE (IspG) was observed. Introduction of a double bond allows conjugation in the putative reactive intermediates while entering enzymatic transformation. Unexpected covalent trapping could happen as consequential damage.







Abstract
IspG (also called GcpE) is an oxygen&#8208;sensitive [4Fe&#8208;4S] enzyme catalyzing the penultimate step of the methylerythritol phosphate (MEP) pathway, a validated target for drug development. It converts 2&#8208;C&#8208;methyl&#8208;d&#8208;erythritol&#8208;2,4&#8208;cyclo&#8208;diphosphate (MEcPP) into (E)&#8208;4&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;3&#8208;methyl&#8208;but&#8208;2&#8208;enyl&#8208;1&#8208;diphosphate (HMBPP). The reaction, assimilated to a reductive dehydration, involves redox partners responsible for the formal transfer of two electrons to substrate MEcPP. The 2&#8208;vinyl analogue of MEcPP was designed to generate conjugated species during enzyme catalysis, with the aim of providing new reactive centers to be covalently trapped by neighboring amino acid residues. The synthesized substrate analogue displayed irreversible inhibition towards IspG. Furthermore, we have shown that electron transfer occurs prior to inhibition; this might designate conjugated intermediates as probable affinity tags through covalent interaction at the catalytic site. This is the first report of an irreversible inhibitor of the IspG metalloenzyme.

         <title>&#947;&#8208;Resorcyclic Acid&#8208;Based AIEgens for Illuminating Endoplasmic Reticulum**
</title>

Illuminate ER: Two small molecules with &#947;&#8208;resorcyclic acid moiety were designed and synthesized having aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) activity due to dual intramolecular H&#8208;bonding. These small molecules localized into the sub&#8208;cellular endoplasmic reticulum to light it up.







Abstract
Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) has emerged as one of the interesting sub&#8208;cellular organelles due to its role in myriads of biological phenomena. Subsequently, visualization of the structure&#8208;function and dynamics of ER remained a major challenge to understand its involvement in different diseased states including cancer. To illuminate the ER, herein we have designed and synthesized &#947;&#8208;resorcyclic acid&#8208;based small molecules, which showed remarkable aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) property in water. This AIE property was originated from the dual intramolecular H&#8208;bonding leading to the self&#8208;assembled 2D aggregation confirmed by pH&#8208; and temperature&#8208;dependent fluorescence quenching studies as well as scanning electron microscopy. These small molecules illuminated the sub&#8208;cellular ER in HeLa cervical cancer cells as well as non&#8208;cancerous RPE&#8208;1 human retinal epithelial cells within 1&#8197;h. These novel small molecules have the potential to light up ER chemical biology in diseased states.

         <title>Exploring the Biosynthetic Potential of TsrM, a B12&#8208;dependent Radical SAM Methyltransferase Catalyzing Non&#8208;radical Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
TsrM is a B12&#8208;dependent radical SAM enzyme catalyzing methylation reactions from carbon&#8208;atoms to nucleophilic atoms making it a unique and versatile alkylating agent. TsrM is able to directly transfer methyl groups on the less reactive carbon atom of the indole ring and to install several methyl groups on its substrate. TsrM has thus unique properties among radical SAM enzymes by notably catalyzing non&#8208;radical reactions. (SAM: S&#8208;adenosyl&#8208;L&#8208;methionine).







Abstract
B12&#8208;dependent radical SAM enzymes are an emerging enzyme family with approximately 200,000 proteins. These enzymes have been shown to catalyze chemically challenging reactions such as methyl transfer to sp2&#8208; and sp3&#8208;hybridized carbon atoms. However, to date we have little information regarding their complex mechanisms and their biosynthetic potential. Here we show, using X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy, mutagenesis and synthetic probes that the vitamin B12&#8208;dependent radical SAM enzyme TsrM catalyzes not only C&#8208; but also N&#8208;methyl transfer reactions further expanding its synthetic versatility. We also demonstrate that TsrM has the unique ability to directly transfer a methyl group to the benzyl core of tryptophan, including the least reactive position C4. Collectively, our study supports that TsrM catalyzes non&#8208;radical reactions and establishes the usefulness of radical SAM enzymes for novel biosynthetic schemes including serial alkylation reactions at particularly inert C&#8722;H bonds.

         <title>Luminescent Pyrrole&#8208;Based Phosphaphenalene Gold Complexes: Versatile Anticancer Tools with Wide Applicability</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new gold standard: Pyrrole&#8208;based phosphaphenalene gold(I) complexes are potent anticancer agents with high efficacy against 14&#8197;different brain cancer cell lines derived from glioblastomas, brain metastases, meningiomas, IDH&#8208;mutant gliomas and head and neck cancers. The IC50 values reach concentrations as low as 730&#8197;nM. Furthermore, these versatile and tunable agents exhibit favorable optoelectronic properties giving rise to potential theranostic applications.







Abstract
Brain cancer, one of the most lethal diseases, urgently requires the discovery of novel theranostic agents. In this context, molecules based on six&#8208;membered phosphorus heterocycles &#8211; phosphaphenalenes &#8211; are especially attractive; they possess unique characteristics that allow precise chemical engineering. Herein, we demonstrate that subtle structural modifications of the phosphaphenalene&#8208;based gold(I) complexes lead to modify their electronic distribution, endow them with marked photophysical properties and enhance their efficacy against cancer. In particular, phosphaphenalene&#8208;based gold(I) complexes containing a pyrrole ring show antiproliferative properties in 14&#8197;cell lines including glioblastomas, brain metastases, meningiomas, IDH&#8208;mutant gliomas and head and neck cancers, reaching IC50 values as low as 0.73&#8197;&#956;M. The bioactivity of this new family of drugs in combination with their photophysical properties thus offer new research possibilities for both the fundamental investigation and treatment of brain cancer.

         <title>Disclosing Cyclic(Alkyl)(Amino)Carbenes as One&#8208;Electron Reductants: Synthesis of Acyclic(Amino)(Aryl)Carbene&#8208;Based Kekul&#233; Diradicaloids</title>

CAAC donates electron and acts as reductant: Cyclic(alkyl)(amino)(carbene) CAAC donates one electron during the formation of transient radical&#8208;cation evidenced by cyclic voltammetry and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy. Subsequently, the one electron&#8208;reductant property of the disclosed CAAC was used to synthesize acyclic(amino)(aryl)carbene&#8208;based Thiele and Chichibabin hydrocarbons. Notably, the acyclic(amino)(aryl)carbene&#8208;based Chichibabin's hydrocarbon shows an appreciable population of the triplet state at room temperature, as evidenced by both variable&#8208;temperature NMR and EPR spectroscopy.







Abstract
Herein, we disclose cyclic(alkyl)(amino)carbenes (CAACs) to be one&#8208;electron reductants under the formation of a transient radical cation as indicated by EPR spectroscopy. The disclosed CAAC reducing reactivity was used to synthesize acyclic(amino)(aryl)carbene&#8208;based Thiele and Chichibabin hydrocarbons, a new class of Kekul&#233; diradicaloids. The results demonstrate CAACs to be potent organic reductants. Notably, the acyclic(amino)(aryl)carbene&#8208;based Chichibabin's hydrocarbon shows an appreciable population of the triplet state at room temperature, as evidenced by both variable&#8208;temperature NMR and EPR spectroscopy.

         <title>Sterically Frustrated Aromatic Enes with Various Colors Originating from Multiple Folded and Twisted Conformations in Crystal Polymorphs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In the crystalline state of sterically frustrated aromatic enes (FAEs) both twisted and folded carbon&#8211;carbon double bonds coexist. FAEs exhibit various absorption and emission colors from yellow to orange and from orange to dark red, just like beautiful autumn leaves. These color differences correspond to the multiple energetically close metastable conformations of the FAEs, which differ in the twist and fold angles of the C=C bond and the dihedral angle of the aryl unit relative to the C=C bond. More information can be found in the Research Article by T. Nishiuchi, T. Kubo, and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202200286).
