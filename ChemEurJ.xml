         <title>A fluorescent gemcitabine prodrug that follows a nucleoside transporter&#8208;independent internalization and bears enhanced therapeutic efficacy with respect to gemcitabine</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The multiplexity of cancer has rendered it the second leading cause of mortality worldwide and theragnostic prodrugs have gained popularity in recent years as a means of treatment. Theragnostic prodrugs enable the simultaneous diagnosis and therapy of tumors via high&#8208;precision real&#8208;time drug release monitoring. Herein, we report the development of the small theragnostic prodrug GF, based on the nucleoside anticancer agent gemcitabine and the fluorescent dye 5(6)&#8208;carboxyfluorescein. We have successfully demonstrated its efficient internalization in tumor cells, showing localization throughout both the early and late endocytic pathways. Its mechanism of cell internalization was evaluated, confirming its independence from nucleoside transporters. Its cellular localization via confocal microscopy revealed a clathrin&#8208;mediated endocytosis mechanism, distinguishing it from analogous compounds studied previously. Furthermore, GF exhibited stability across various pH values and in human blood plasma. Subsequently, its in vitro cytotoxicity was assessed in three human cancer cell lines (A549, U87 and T98). Additionally, its pharmacokinetic profile in mice was investigated and the consequent drug release was monitored. Finally, its in vivo visualization was accomplished in zebrafish xenotransplantation models and its in vivo efficacy was evaluated in A549 xenografts. The results unveiled an intriguing efficacy profile, positioning GF as a compelling candidate warranting further investigation.</dc:description>

         <title>Uncatalyzed Diboron Activation by a Strained Hydrocarbon: Experimental and Theoretical Study of [1.1.1]Propellane Diborylation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthesis of strained carbocyclic building blocks is relevant for Medicinal Chemistry, and methylenecyclobutanes are particularly challenging with current synthetic technology. Careful inspection of the reactivity of [1.1.1]propellane and diboron reagents has revealed that bis(catecholato)diboron (B2cat2) can produce a bis(borylated) methylenecyclobutane in a few minutes at room temperature. This reaction constitutes the first example of B&#8211;B bond activation by a special&#160;apolar hydrocarbon and also the first time that propellane is electrophilically activated by boron. Mechanistic studies including in situ NMR kinetics and DFT calculations demonstrate that the diboron moiety can be directly activated through coordination with the inverted sigma bond of propellane, and reveal that DMF is involved in the stabilization of diboronate ylide intermediates rather than the activation of the B&#8211;B bond. These results enable new possibilities for both diboron and propellane chemistry, and for further developments in the synthesis of methylenecyclobutanes based on propellane strain release.</dc:description>

         <title>U(V) Stabilization via Aliovalent Incorporation of Ln(III) into Oxo&#8208;salt Framework</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ln(UVO2)W4O14 series are the inaugural materials to structurally integrate pentavalent uranium with rare&#8208;earth metals, featuring a unique U&#8722;Ln cation interaction. This occurs when Ln3+ ions replace Ca2+ in the crystal, they add extra positive charge, causing a charge imbalance that oxidizes uranium from U(VI) to U(V).







Abstract
Pentavalent uranium compounds are key components of uranium&#8216;s redox chemistry and play important roles in environmental transport. Despite this, well&#8208;characterized U(V) compounds are scarce primarily because of their instability with respect to disproportionation to U(IV) and U(VI). In this work, we provide an alternate route to incorporation of U(V) into a crystalline lattice where different oxidation states of uranium can be stabilized through the incorporation of secondary cations with different sizes and charges. We show that iriginite&#8208;based crystalline layers allow for systematically replacing U(VI) with U(V) through aliovalent substitution of 2+ alkaline&#8208;earth or 3+ rare&#8208;earth cations as dopant ions under high&#8208;temperature conditions, specifically Ca(UVIO2)W4O14 and Ln(UVO2)W4O14 (Ln=Nd, Sm, Eu, Gd, Yb). Evidence for the existence of U(V) and U(VI) is supported by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, high energy resolution X&#8208;ray absorption near edge structure, X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and optical absorption spectroscopy. In contrast with other reported U(V) materials, the U(V) single crystals obtained using this route are relatively large (several centimeters) and easily reproducible, and thus provide a substantial improvement in the facile synthesis and stabilization of U(V).

         <title>Unravelling the Mechanism of CO2 Activation: Insights Into Metal&#8208;Metal Cooperativity and Spin&#8208;Orbit Coupling with {3d&#8211;4f} Catalysts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
For the activation of CO2 by 3d&#8211;4f catalysts, our combined DFT and ab initio calculations reveal the significance of metal&#8208;metal cooperativity and the role of spin&#8208;orbit coupling in fine&#8208;tuning catalytic efficiency.







Abstract
Converting CO2 into useful chemicals using metal catalysts is a significant challenge in chemistry. Among the various catalysts reported, transition metal lanthanide hybrid {3d&#8211;4f} complexes stand out for their superior efficiency and site selectivity. However, unlike transition metal catalysts, understanding the origin of this efficiency in lanthanides poses a challenge due to their orbital degeneracy, rendering the application of DFT methods ineffective. In this study, we employed a combination of density functional theory (DFT) and ab initio CASSCF/RASSI&#8208;SO calculations to explore the mechanism of CO2 conversion to cyclic carbonate using a 3d&#8211;4f heterometallic catalyst for the first time. This work unveils the importance of 3d and 4f metal cooperativity and the role of individual spin&#8208;orbit states in dictating the overall efficiency of the catalyst.

         <title>Rapid Access to Divergent Fused Polycycles Via One&#8208;Pot A3 Coupling and Intramolecular Diels&#8208;Alder Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A combination of one&#8208;pot reaction and a derivation step is developed for concise construction of divergent nitrogen&#8208;containing fused polycyclic ring systems from simple starting materials, providing a rapid access to an under&#8208;explored structural space for discovery of new biological activities. The one&#8208;pot reaction combines aldehyde&#8208;alkyne&#8208;amine (A3) coupling and intramolecular Diels&#8208;Alder reactions under simple, open&#8208;air conditions.







Abstract
Divergent nitrogen&#8208;containing fused polycyclic ring systems are constructed from simple starting materials via a one&#8208;pot aldehyde&#8208;alkyne&#8208;amine (A3) coupling and intramolecular Diels&#8208;Alder reaction. This domino reaction directly furnishes linear 5/5/5 and 5/5/6, or nonlinear 5/5/6/5, polycyclic rings containing an oxa&#8208;bridged fused 5/5 bicycle and a 1,6&#8208;enyne substructure. One&#8208;step derivation of the oxa&#8208;bridged 5/5 bicycle leads to a polyfunctionalized 5/5 bicycle with tetrahydrofuran fused back&#8208;to&#8208;back to pyrroline or a 6/5 bicycle with the hexahydro&#8208;1H&#8208;isoindole structure, while cycloisomerizing the enyne substructure adds an extra fused 5&#8208;membered ring to afford functionalized linear 5/5/5/5 or 5/5/5/5/5 fused ring systems from selected substrates. In addition, the one&#8208;pot product can be designed so that the alkyne moiety is hydroalkoxylated to form an additional heterocyle in a linear 5/5/5/6 or nonlinear 5/5/6/5/5 ring system. This diversity&#8208;oriented synthetic approach thus allows rapid access to an under&#8208;explored structural space for discovery of new biological or non&#8208;biological activities or functions.

One-step derivation of the oxa-bridged 5/5 bicycle leads to a polyfunctionalized 5/5 bicycle with tetrahydrofuran fused back-to-back to pyrroline or a 6/5 bicycle with the hexahydro-1&lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;-isoindole structure, while cycloisomerizing the enyne substructure adds an extra fused 5-membered ring to afford functionalized linear 5/5/5/5 or 5/5/5/5/5 fused ring systems from selected substrates. In addition, the one-pot product can be designed so that the alkyne moiety is hydroalkoxylated to form an additional heterocyle in a linear 5/5/5/6 or nonlinear 5/5/6/5/5 ring system. This diversity-oriented synthetic approach thus allows rapid access to an under-explored structural space for discovery of new biological or non-biological activities or functions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Type of Stable Amides Behaves as Acyl Transfer Reagents upon Visible&#8208;Light Irradiation through Self&#8208;Aromatization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new type of stable amides is synthesized, which can react with various nucleophiles like acyl chlorides under light irradiation. This controllable switched&#8208;on reactivity hinges on a rational&#8208;designed photo&#8208;activatable masked acyl donor reagent.







Abstract
Organic molecules with light&#8208;modifiable reactivity are important in many fields because they can serve as the &#8220;switch&#8221; for light to trigger chemical processes. Herein, we disclose a new type of stable non&#8208;twisted amides, the reactivity of which can be turned on by light as acyl transfer reagents. Upon photo&#8208;activation, these amides react with various nucleophiles including amines, phenols, hydroxide, thiols, boronic acids, and alkynes either under metal&#8208;free or metal&#8208;catalysis conditions. This reactivity hinges on the design and synthesis of a photo&#8208;activatable reagent (7&#8208;nitro&#8208;5,6&#8208;dihydrophenanthridine), which undergoes self&#8208;aromatization enabled by an internal oxidant under light. This masked acyl donor group is anticipated to be useful in scenarios where light is preferred to trigger a chemical process.

         <title>Realizing color transitions for three copper (I) cluster organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid materials by adjusting reaction conditions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Copper iodide organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid materials have been favored by many researchers in the field of solid&#8208;state lighting (SSL) due to their structural diversity and optical adjustability. In this paper, three isomeric copper iodide cluster hybrid materials, Cu4I6(L)2(1), Cu5I4.5Cl2.5(L)2(2) and Cu5I7(L)2) (3) (L=1&#8208;(4&#8208;methylpyrimidin&#8208;2&#8208;yl)&#8208;1,4&#8208;diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octan&#8208;1&#8208;ium), were achieved by adjusting the reaction conditions. The crystal color transit from green, yellow to orange and the internal quantum yield (IQY) increase from 57% to 88%. All three complexes have good thermal stability, good solution processability, and high quantum yield. And origin and mechanism of luminescence of complexes were further studied. This study can provide ideas and theoretical basis for the regulation of cuprous iodide cluster luminescent materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrochemical Decarboxylative Cross&#8208;Coupling with Nucleophiles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Decarboxylative cross&#8208;coupling reactions are powerful tools for carbon&#8211;heteroatom bonds formation, but typically require pre&#8208;activated carboxylic acids as substrates or heteroelectrophiles as functional groups. Herein, we present an electrochemical decarboxylative cross&#8208;coupling of carboxylic acids with structurally diverse fluorine, alcohol, H2O, acid, and amine as nucleophiles. This strategy takes advantage of the ready availability of these building blocks from commercial libraries, as well as the mild and oxidant&#8208;free conditions provided by electrochemical system. This reaction demonstrates good functional&#8208;group tolerance and its utility in late&#8208;stage functionalization.</dc:description>

         <title>Hollow CeO2&#8208;Base Nanozyme with Self&#8208;Accelerated Cascade Reactions for Combined Tumor Therapy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nanozymes have obvious advantages in improving the efficiency of cancer treatment. However, due to the lack of tissue specificity, low catalytic efficiency, and so on, their clinical applications are limited. Herein, the nanoplatform CeO2@ICG@GOx@HA (CIGH) with self&#8208;accelerated cascade reactions is constructed. The as&#8208;prepared nanozyme shows the superior oxidase (OXD)&#8208;like, superoxide dismutase (SOD)&#8208;like, catalase (CAT)&#8208;like, and peroxidase (POD)&#8208;like activities. At the same time, under 808 nm near&#8208;infrared (NIR) irradiation, the photodynamic and photothermal capabilities are also significantly enhanced due to the presence of indocyanine green (ICG). We demonstrate that the nanozyme CIGH can efficiently accumulate in the tumor and exhibit amplified cascade antitumor effects with negligible systemic toxicity through the combination of photodynamic therapy (PDT), photothermal therapy (PTT), chemodynamic therapy (CDT) and starvation therapy. The nanozyme prepared in this study provides a promising candidate for catalytic nanomedicines for efficient tumor therapy.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In several biological processes, H2S is known to function as an endogenous gaseous agent. It is very necessary to monitor H2S and relevant physiological processes in vivo. Herein, a new type of fluorophore with a reliable leaving group allows for excited&#8208;state intramolecular transfer characteristics (ESIPT), inspired by mycophenolic acid. A morpholine ring was connected at the maleimide position to target the lysosome. Subsequently, the dinitrophenyl group known for a photoinduced electron transfer (PET) effect, was connected to allow for an effective &#8220;turn&#8208;on&#8221; probe Lyso&#8211;H2S. Lyso&#8211;H2S demonstrated strong selectivity towards H2S, large Stokes shift (111 nm), and an incredibly low detection limit (41.8 nM). The imaging of endogenous and exogenous H2S in living cells (A549 cell line) was successfully achieved because of the specificity and ultra&#8208;low toxicity (100 % cell viability at 50 &#181;M concentration of Lyso&#8211;H2S.) Additionally, Lyso&#8211;H2S was also employed to visualize the activity of H2S in the gallbladder and intestine in a living zebrafish model. This is the first report of a fluorescent probe to track H2S sensing in specific organ systems to our knowledge.</dc:description>

         <title>Luminescent Tetranuclear Copper(I) and Gold(I) Heterobimetallic Complexes: A Phosphine Acetylide Amidinate Orthogonal Ligand Framework for Selective Complexation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Luminescent tetranuclear heterobimetallic complexes: Heterobimetallic CuI/AuI complexes with phosphine acetylide amidinate ligand were synthesized by using different reaction pathways. These complexes are found to be luminescent and differ in terms of ancillary ligands at AuI centre.







Abstract
The synthesis of phosphine acetylide amidinate stabilized copper(I) and gold(I) heterobimetallic complexes was achieved by reacting ligand [{Ph2PC&#8801;CC(NDipp)2}Li(thf)3] (Dipp=2,6&#8208;N,N&#8242;&#8208;diisopropylphenyl) with CuCl and Au(tht))Cl, yielding the eight membered ring [{Ph2PC&#8801;CC(NDipp)2}2Cu2] and the twelve membered ring [{Ph2PC&#8801;CC(NDipp)2}2Au2]. {Ph2PC&#8801;CC(NDipp)2}2Cu2] features a Cu2 unit, which is bridged by two amidinate ligands, served as a metalloligand to synthesize the heterobimetallic CuI/AuI complexes [{(AuX)Ph2PC&#8801;CC(NDipp)2}2Cu2] (X=Cl, C6F5). In these reactions, the central ring structure is retained. In contrast, when the twelve membered ring [{Ph2PC&#8801;CC(NDipp)2}2Au2] was reacted with CuX (X=Cl, Br, I and Mes), the reaction led to the rearrangement of the central ring structure to give [{(AuX)Ph2PC&#8801;CC(NDipp)2}2Cu2] (X=Cl, Br, I and Mes), which feature the same the eight membered Cu2 ring as above. These compounds were also synthesized by a one&#8208;pot reaction. The luminescent heterobimetallic complexes were further investigated for their photophysical properties.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Luminescent tetranuclear heterobimetallic complexes&lt;/b&gt;: Heterobimetallic Cu&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt;/Au&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt; complexes with phosphine acetylide amidinate ligand were synthesized by using different reaction pathways. These complexes are found to be luminescent and differ in terms of ancillary ligands at Au&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt; centre.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The synthesis of phosphine acetylide amidinate stabilized copper(I) and gold(I) heterobimetallic complexes was achieved by reacting ligand [{Ph&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;PC&#8801;CC(NDipp)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}Li(thf)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;] (Dipp=2,6-N,N&#8242;-diisopropylphenyl) with CuCl and Au(tht))Cl, yielding the eight membered ring [{Ph&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;PC&#8801;CC(NDipp)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;] and the twelve membered ring [{Ph&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;PC&#8801;CC(NDipp)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Au&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]. {Ph&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;PC&#8801;CC(NDipp)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;] features a Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; unit, which is bridged by two amidinate ligands, served as a metalloligand to synthesize the heterobimetallic Cu&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt;/Au&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt; complexes [{(AuX)Ph&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;PC&#8801;CC(NDipp)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;] (X=Cl, C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;). In these reactions, the central ring structure is retained. In contrast, when the twelve membered ring [{Ph&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;PC&#8801;CC(NDipp)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Au&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;] was reacted with CuX (X=Cl, Br, I and Mes), the reaction led to the rearrangement of the central ring structure to give [{(AuX)Ph&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;PC&#8801;CC(NDipp)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;] (X=Cl, Br, I and Mes), which feature the same the eight membered Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ring as above. These compounds were also synthesized by a one-pot reaction. The luminescent heterobimetallic complexes were further investigated for their photophysical properties.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Recent Progress in Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Photosensitizers for Photodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
TADF molecules featuring an efficient intersystem crossing process have become increasingly crucial and potential photosensitizers for the PDT process. This review presents the key characteristics of TADF photosensitizers for the specific requirements, such as their water dispersibility, targeting ability, activability, and two&#8208;photon excitation properties. Furthermore, future challenges and prospects of TADF photosensitizers in PDT are suggested.







Abstract
Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a rapidly growing discipline that is expected to become an encouraging noninvasive therapeutic strategy for cancer treatment. In the PDT process, an efficient intersystem crossing (ISC) process for photosensitizers from the singlet excited state (S1) to the triplet excited state (T1) is critical for the formation of cytotoxic reactive oxygen species and improvement of PDT performance. Thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) molecules featuring an extremely small singlet&#8211;triplet energy gap and an efficient ISC process represent an enormous breakthrough for the PDT process. Consequently, the development of advanced TADF photosensitizers has become increasingly crucial and pressing. The most recent developments in TADF photosensitizers aimed at enhancing PDT efficiency for bio&#8208;applications are presented in this review. TADF photosensitizers with water dispersibility, targeting ability, activatable ability, and two&#8208;photon excitation properties are highlighted. Furthermore, the future challenges and perspectives of TADF photosensitizers in PDT are proposed.

         <title>Hydrosilylation of Olefins Activated on Highly Lewis&#8208;Acidic Calcium Cation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Readily available salt of Ca2+ with weakly coordinating anion [Al(ORF)4]&#8722; (RF=C(CF3)3) exhibits high Lewis acidity comparable to SbF5. Reactivity studies show it is an effective catalyst for olefin hydrosilylation, yielding anti&#8208;Markovnikov regioisomer. Experimental and DFT studies indicate a unique mechanism for this type of reaction, which involves the activation of the olefin molecule by coordination with Ca2+.







Abstract
The report introduces simple yet highly reactive calcium salt, Ca[Al(ORF)4]2 (RF=C(CF3)3), 1, which effectively catalyses olefin hydrosilylation through an unusual mechanism involving the activation of the alkene molecule. Upon dissolution in o&#8208;difluorobenzene (oDFB), 1 forms a highly Lewis acidic [Ca(oDFB)6]2+ complex. Our DFT calculations reveal that fluoride ion affinity is comparable to SbF5. Reactivity tests show that it effectively catalyses the hydrosilylation of olefins with high regioselectivity, also in reactions involving sterically demanding substrates like (iPr)3SiH or tetrasubstituted olefins. Experimental and computational results point to the mechanism where the olefin molecule forms a complex with Ca2+, which significantly facilitates the attack of H&#8208;SiR3 on the C=C double bond.

Thermally conductive epoxies with self&#8208;healing ability will be widely used in flexible electronic materials in the future. In this paper, alkyl chains of different lengths were introduced to epoxies for discussing the thermally conductive, the self&#8208;healing performance, and the synergistic effect. and the epoxies suitable for flexible electronic device can be prepared by adjusting the length of alkyl chains.







Abstract
With the popularization of 5G technology and artificial intelligence, thermally conductive epoxies with self&#8208;healing ability will be widely used in flexible electronic materials. Although many compounds containing both performances have been synthesized, there is little systematic theory to explain the coordination mechanism. In this paper, alkyl chains of different lengths were introduced to epoxies to discuss the thermally conductive, the self&#8208;healing performance, and the synergistic effect. A series of electronic&#8208;grade biphenyl epoxies (4,4&#8242;&#8208;bis(oxiran&#8208;2&#8208;ylmethoxy)&#8208;1,1&#8242;&#8208;biphenyl (1), 4,4&#8242;&#8208;bis(2&#8208;(oxiran&#8208;2&#8208;yl)ethoxy)&#8208;1,1&#8242;&#8208;biphenyl (2), 4,4&#8242;&#8208;bis(3&#8208;(oxiran&#8208;2&#8208;yl)propoxy)&#8208;1,1&#8242;&#8208;biphenyl (3), and 4,4&#8242;&#8208;bis(4&#8208;(oxiran&#8208;2&#8208;yl)butoxy)&#8208;1,1&#8242;&#8208;biphenyl (4) were synthesized and characterized. Furthermore, they were cured with decanedioic acid to produce polymers. Results showed that alkyl chains can both affect the two properties, and the epoxies suitable for specific application scenarios can be prepared by adjusting the length of alkyl chains. In terms of thermal conductivity, compound 1 was a most promising material. However, compound 4 was expected to be utilized in flexible electronic devices because of its acceptable thermal conductivity, self&#8208;healing ability, transparency, and flexibility.

         <title>Tetrazole and oxadiazole derivatives as thermally activated delayed fluorescence emitters</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) are promising lighting solutions for sustainability and energy efficiency. Incorporating thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) molecules enables OLEDs to achieve internal quantum efficiency (IQE), in principle, up to 100%; therefore, new classes of promising TADF emitters and modifications of existing ones are sought after. This study explores the TADF emission properties of six designed TADF emitters, examining their photophysical responses using experimental and theoretical methods. The design strategy involves creating six distinct types of a donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;A) system, where tert&#8208;butylcarbazoles are used as donors, while the acceptor component incorporates three different functional groups: nitrile, tetrazole and oxadiazole, with varying electron&#8208;withdrawing character. Additionally, the donor&#8208;acceptor distance is adjusted using a phenylene spacer, and its influence on TADF functionality is examined. The clear dependency of an additional spacer, inhibiting TADF, could be revealed. Emitters with a direct donor&#8208;acceptor connection are demonstrated to exhibit TADF moderate emissive behavior. The analysis emphasizes the impact of charge transfer, singlet&#8208;triplet energy gaps (&#916;EST), and other microscopic parameters on photophysical rates, permitting TADF. Among the emitters, TCz&#8208;CN shows optimal performance as a blue&#8208;green emitter with an 88% photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) and fast rate of reversible intersystem crossing of 2x106 s&#8208;1</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Bimetallic CpMM'Nacnac molecules with group 2 and 12 metals (M = Be, Mg, Ca, Zn, Cd, Hg) that contain novel metal&#8208;metal bonding have been investigated in a theoretical study of their molecular and electronic structure, thermodynamic stability, and metal&#8208;metal bonding. In all cases the metal&#8208;metal bonds are characterized as electron&#8208;sharing covalent single bonds from natural bond orbital (NBO) and energy&#8208;decomposition analysis with natural orbitals of chemical valence (EDA&#8208;NOCV) analysis. The sum of [MM'] charges is relatively constant, with all complexes exhibiting a [MM']2+&#160;core. Quantum theory of atoms in molecules (QTAIM) analysis indicates the presence of non&#8208;nuclear attractors (NNA) in the metal&#8208;metal bonds of the BeBe, MgMg, and CaCa complexes. There is substantial electron density (0.75&#8208;1.33 e) associated with the NNAs, which indicates that these metal&#8208;metal bonds, while classified as covalent electron&#8208;sharing bonds, retain significant metallic character that can be associated with reducing reactivity of the complex. The predicted stability of these complexes, combined with their novel covalent metal&#8208;metal bonding and potential as reducing agents, make them appealing targets for the synthesis of new metal&#8208;metal bonds.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This report describes an environmentally benign synthesis of 1,2,3&#8208;benzotriazines through an iodide&#8208;catalyzed electro&#8208;oxidative N&#8208;centered [1,2]&#8208;rearrangement of 3&#8208;aminoindazoles. The developed method demonstrates the activation of heteroatoms via electrochemically generated reactive iodide species without using any metal catalysts and peroxides. The protocol features practical and mild reaction conditions and displays a wide substrate scope. Various mechanistic experiments and cyclic voltammetric studies have been instrumental in elucidating the reaction mechanism, operating via a skeletal rearrangement of 3&#8208;aminoindazoles.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>We described a copper(I)&#8208;catalyzed atom economic and selective hydroamination&#8208;cyclization of alkynyl&#8208;tethered quinazolinones to prepare a variety of indole&#8208;fused pyrazino[1,2&#8208;a]quinazolinones in good to excellent yields ranging from 39% to 99% under mild reaction conditions. Control experiments revealed that coordination&#8208;directed method of quinazolinone moiety with copper(I) was important for the selective hydroamination&#8208;cyclization of alkynes at the N1&#8208;atom instead of N3&#8208;atom of quinazolinone. The reaction could be easily performed at gram scales and some prepared indole&#8208;fused pyrazino[1,2&#8208;a]quinazolinones with donating groups on the indole moiety showed a distinct fluorescence emission wavelength with blue shift under the acid conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Design of Triphenylamine&#8208;based D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A Systems for Efficient&#160;Ternary Worm Memory Devices</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The impact of various substituent moieties on the molecular framework of a conjugated D&#8208;A system in resistive switching memory property has been scrutinized through an array of novel D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A molecules. The synthesized molecules with triphenylamine (TPA) as the electron donor and dicyanovinylindanone (IC) as the electron acceptor demonstrated substantial non&#8208;volatile WORM (Write&#8208;Once Read&#8208;Many) memory behaviour with appreciable ON/OFF current ratios up to 105 and a lowest recorded threshold voltage of &#8208;0.80 V. The well&#8208;balanced combination of these potent electron donating and accepting units culminated in exceptional intramolecular charge transfer interactions and minimal band gap values (1.82&#8208;2.31 eV) for the molecules, as demonstrated by photophysical and electrochemical investigations. These factors, coupled with the thin&#8208;film morphological studies, corroborated the superior performance of the fabricated devices. A longer retention time of 2000s and an endurance of 100 cycles mark the substantial stability of the memory devices. Moreover, conversion from binary to ternary WORM memory was achieved by the effective tuning of the electronic properties of the D&#8208;A systems by various substituent moieties. Molecular simulation studies revealed that the resistive switching phenomenon arises from a synergistic interplay of charge transfer and charge trapping processes within these D&#8208;A systems.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Gold (III) complexes containing trifluromethyl ligands are efficient catalyst in the hydration of alkynes, operating at low catalyst loadings, without additives, using environmentally friendly solvents and at mild conditions (60 &#186;C).

         <title>Influence of O&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Pt interactions on photoluminescent response in the (Et4N)2{[Pt(bph)(CN)2][phenylene&#8208;1,4&#8208;diresorcinol]} framework</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photoluminescence (PL) of the [PtII(C&#8201;C)(CN)2]2&#8211; complexes are tunable via the modification of ligands, intermolecular interactions and type of molecular aggregation. SC XRD, PL, and DFT unite to discriminate the rare RO&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Pt synthons to be responsible for the emission redshift, the RO&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Ncomplex synthons being less critical. The plausible continuum of RO&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Pt contacts is indicated as the broad space for the PL continuous tuning.







Abstract
Tunable photoluminescence (PL) is one of the hot topics in current materials science, and research performed on the molecular phases is at the forefront of this field. We present the new (Et4N)2[PtII(bph)(CN)2]&#8901;rez3&#8901;1/3H2O (Pt2rez3) (bph=biphenyl&#8208;2,2&#8217;&#8208;diyl; rez3=3,3&#8221;,5,5&#8221;&#8208;tetrahydroxy&#8208;1,1&#8217;:4&#8217;,1&#8221;&#8208;terphenyl, phenylene&#8208;1,4&#8208;diresorcinol coformer, a linear quaternary hydrogen bond donor) co&#8208;crystal salt based on the recently appointed promising [PtII(bph)(CN)2]2&#8211; luminophore. Within the extended hydrogen&#8208;bonded subnetwork [PtII(bph)(CN)2]2&#8211; complexes and rez3 coformer molecules form two types of contacts: the rez3O&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Ncomplex ones in the equatorial plane of the complex and non&#8208;typical rez3O&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Pt ones along its axial direction. The combined structural, PL, and DFT approach identified the rez3O&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Pt synthons to be crucial in promoting the noticeable uniform redshift of bph ligand centered (LC) emission compared to the LC emission of the (Et4N)2[PtII(bph)(CN)2]&#8901;H2O (Pt2) precursor, owing to the direct interference of the phenol group with the PtII&#8208;bph orbital system via altering the CT processes within. The high&#8208;resolution emission spectra for Pt2 and Pt2rez3 were successfully reproduced at 77&#8197;K by using the Franck&#8208;Cordon expressions. The possibility to tune PL properties along the plausible continuum of rez3O&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Pt synthons is indicated, considering various scenarios of molecular occupation of the space above and below the complex plane.

         <title>Visible Light&#8208;mediated Late&#8208;stage Thioetherification of Mercaptopurine Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We present herein a novel photo&#8208;mediated homolytic C&#8208;S bond formation for the preparation of alkylthiopurines and alkylthiopurine nucleosides. Despite the presence of reactive sites for the Minisci reaction, chemoselective S&#8208;alkylation remained the predominant pathway. This method allows for the late&#8208;stage introduction of a broad spectrum of alkyl groups onto the sulfur atom of unprotective mercaptopurine derivatives, encompassing 2&#8208;, 6&#8208;, and 8&#8208;mercaptopurine rings. Organoborons serve as efficient and eco&#8208;friendly alkylating reagents, providing advantages in terms of readily availability, stability, and reduced toxicity. Further derivatization of the thioetherified nucleosides, together with anti&#8208;tumor assays, led to the discovery of potent anti&#8208;tumor agents with an IC50 value reaching 6.1 &#181;M (Comp. 31 for Jurkat).</dc:description>

         <title>Tuning Tumor Targeting and Ratiometric Photoacoustic Imaging by Fine&#8208;Tuning Torsion Angle for Colorectal Liver Metastasis Diagnosis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photoacoustic (PA) tomography is an emerging biomedical imaging technology for precision cancer medicine. Conventional small&#8208;molecule PA probes usually exhibit a single PA signal and poor tumor targeting that lack the imaging reliability. Here, we introduce a series of cyanine/hemicyanine interconversion dyes (denoted Cy&#8208;HCy) for PA/fluorescent dual&#8208;mode probe development that features optimized ratiometric PA imaging and tunable tumor&#8208;targeting ability for precise diagnosis and resection of colorectal cancer (CRC). Importantly, Cy&#8208;HCy can be presented in cyanine (inherent tumor targeting and long NIR PA wavelength) and hemicyanine (poor tumor targeting and short NIR PA wavelength) by fine&#8208;tuning torsion angle and the ingenious transformation between cyanine and hemicyanine through regulation optically tunable group endows the NIR ratiometric PA and tunable tumor&#8208;targeting properties. To demonstrate the applicability of Cy&#8208;HCy dyes, we designed the first small&#8208;molecule tumor&#8208;targeting and NIR ratiometric PA probe Cy&#8208;HCy&#8208;H2S for precise CRC liver metastasis diagnosis, activated by H2S (a CRC biomarker). Using this probe, we not only visualized the subcutaneous tumor and liver metastatic cancers in CRC mouse models but also realized PA and fluorescence image&#8208;guided tumor excision. We expect that Cy&#8208;HCy will be generalized for creating a wide variety of inherently tumor&#8208;targeting NIR ratiometric PA probes in oncological research and practice.</dc:description>

         <title>Unusually Short H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H Contacts in Intramolecularly Cyclized Helically Fused Anthracenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A helically fused anthracene structure was cyclized through intramolecular Ni(0)&#8208;mediated coupling of the dichloro derivative, resulting in a cyclic structure with unusually short H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H contacts (1.648&#8211;1.692&#8197;&#197;) within the inner region. This steric environment significantly influences the spectroscopic data and the bonding nature.







Abstract
The intramolecular coupling of dichloro&#8208;substituted helically fused anthracenes using the Yamamoto coupling yielded cyclized products with sterically congested molecular structures. The X&#8208;ray analysis and DFT calculations showed that the aromatic framework adopted a nonplanar structure with a twisted conformation about the newly formed single bond, which acts as a chiral axis. Interestingly, the X&#8208;ray structure obtained through the Hirshfeld atom refinement revealed short interatomic distances between the inner hydrogen atoms (1.648&#8211;1.692&#8197;&#197;), much shorter than the sum of their van der Waals radii. Owing to these unusually short contacts, the 1H NMR spectrum exhibited a significant deshielding (12.5&#8197;ppm) and a large nuclear Overhauser effect (44&#8201;%). Additionally, the IR spectrum displayed a high&#8208;frequency shift of the C&#8722;H stretching vibration. These observations, along with the noncovalent interaction plot indicative of a characteristic steric environment, strongly support the presence of steric hindrance. Moreover, dynamic NMR measurement of the mesityl&#8208;substituted derivative yielded a barrier to helical inversion of 84&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1. The optical properties and crystal packing of the cyclized products are also reported.

Abstract
The room temperature metal&#8208;free cascade electrophilic addition/cyclization/oxidation reactions of (3&#8208;phenoxyprop&#8208;1&#8208;yn&#8208;1&#8208;yl)benzenes to divergently synthesize various brominated benzopyran derivatives (3&#8208;bromo&#8208;2H&#8208;chromenes, 3&#8208;bromo&#8208;2H&#8208;chromen&#8208;2&#8208;ols and 3&#8208;bromo coumarins) by tuning the amount of Br2 and H2O have been developed. The method exhibited high selectivity, mild reaction conditions, broad substrate scope, high efficiency, and the applicability for derivatization of the brominated products. The importance of the strategies provides a great advantage for selective synthesis of brominated benzopyran derivatives.

&lt;p&gt;The room temperature metal-free cascade electrophilic addition/cyclization/oxidation reactions of (3-phenoxyprop-1-yn-1-yl)benzenes to divergently synthesize various brominated benzopyran derivatives (3-bromo-2&lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;-chromenes, 3-bromo-2&lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;-chromen-2-ols and 3-bromo coumarins) by tuning the amount of Br&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O have been developed. The method exhibited high selectivity, mild reaction conditions, broad substrate scope, high efficiency, and the applicability for derivatization of the brominated products. The importance of the strategies provides a great advantage for selective synthesis of brominated benzopyran derivatives.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Iron&#8208;Catalyzed, Light&#8208;Driven Decarboxylative Alkoxyamination</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An iron&#8208;catalyzed, visible&#8208;light induced decarboxylative alkoxyamination of carboxylic acids with TEMPO is disclosed. In the presence of FeBr2 and TEMPO, a large array of carboxylic acids including marketed drugs and biobased molecules is turned into the corresponding alkoxyamine derivatives. The versatility of the latter offers an entry towards molecular diversity generation from abundant starting materials and catalyst. Overall, this method proposes a unified and general approach for LMCT&#8208;based iron&#8208;catalyzed decarboxylative functionalization.

         <title>Regiodivergent Synthesis of 4&#8208; and 5&#8208;Sulfenyl Oxazoles from Alkynyl Thioethers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Regiodivergent synthesis of 4&#8208; and 5&#8208;sulfenyl oxazoles from 1,4,2&#8208;dioxazoles and alkynyl thioethers has been accomplished using Br&#248;nsted acid conditions and gold catalysis, respectively. Same excess experiments and natural bond order analysis illuminate the control processes in gold mediated alkynyl thioether reactions. A telescoped annulation&#8208;oxidation protocol affords sulfoxide and sulfone regioisomers.







Abstract
The regiodivergent synthesis of 4&#8208; and 5&#8208;sulfenyl oxazoles from 1,4,2&#8208;dioxazoles and alkynyl thioethers has been achieved. Gold&#8208;catalysed conditions are used to favour the formation of 5&#8208;sulfenyl oxazoles via &#946;&#8208;selective attack of the nitrenoid relative to the sulfenyl group. In contrast, 4&#8208;sulfenyl oxazoles are formed by &#945;&#8208;selective reaction under Br&#248;nsted acid conditions from the same substrates. The nature of stabilising gold&#8208;sulfur interactions have been investigated by natural bond orbital analysis, showing that the S&#8594;Au interactions are significantly stronger in the intermediate that favours the 5&#8208;sulfenyl oxazoles. A kinetic survey identifies catalyst inhibition processes. This study into the regiodivergent methods includes the development of telescoped annulation&#8208;oxidation protocols for regioselective access to oxazole sulfoxides and sulfones.

         <title>Activation of SO2F2 at a Rhodium PNP Pincer Complex: Ligand Supported S&#8722;F Bond Cleavage to Generate NSO2F Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Treatment of a PNP rhodium complex with SO2F2 led to the bimetallic rhodium(I) fluorido complex trans&#8208;[Rh(F)(CO){&#312;2&#8208;(P,P)&#8722;Cy2PC2H4N(SO2F)C2H4PCy2}]2. Reactivity studies with XeF2 resulted in an oxidative addition at the Rh centres to give a Rh(III) fluorido complex.







Abstract
The &#954;2&#8208;(P,N)&#8722;phosphine ligand precursor NH(CH2CH2PCy2)2 can be used for the synthesis of the rhodium(I) complex [Rh(CO){&#312;3&#8208;(P,N,P)&#8722;Cy2PC2H4NHC2H4PCy2}][Cl] (1). The deprotonated complex [Rh(CO){&#312;3&#8208;(P,N,P)&#8722;Cy2PC2H4NC2H4PCy2}] (2) shows a cooperative reactivity of the PNP ligand in the activation reaction of SO2F2 to yield the rhodium fluorido complex trans&#8208;[Rh(F)(CO){&#312;2&#8208;(P,P)&#8722;Cy2PC2H4N(SO2F)C2H4PCy2}]2 (3) by S&#8722;F bond cleavage. It is remarkable that no reaction was observed when 3 was treated with hydrogen sources e.&#8201;g. dihydrogen, organosilicon compounds such as triethylsilane or TMS&#8722;CF3 and different fluorine sources such as SF4 or Selectfluor&#174;. However, the treatment of complex 3 with XeF2 in the presence of CsF resulted in the formation of the unique fluorido rhodium(III) complex cis,trans&#8208;[Rh(F)3(CO){&#312;2&#8208;(P,P)&#8722;Cy2PC2H4N(SO2F)C2H4PCy2}]2 (4). In the presence of pyridine(HF)X or BF3 the fluorido complex 3 converted into the dicationic complexes [Rh(CO){&#312;2&#8208;(P,P)&#8722;Cy2PC2H4N(SO2F)C2H4PCy2}]2[XF]2, X=HF (5) or BF3 (6), respectively.

         <title>Mechanochemical Synthesis of Silylcyclopentenes via Ball Milling</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of innovative methods for synthesizing silylcyclopentene compounds is particularly important for enriching and improving the synthetical toolbox of organosilicon compounds. Herein, a facile approach has been developed for the synthesis of silylcyclopentenes promoted by mechanochemically generated organolithium species as silicon nucleophiles under ball milling conditions, avoiding the requirement of large amounts of bulk solvent. This operationally simple method demonstrates good functional group compatibility, which provides a great opportunity for further exploration of the synthetic applications of silylcyclopentenes. Density functional theory calculations indicated that the transient lithiosilole intermediates undergo a stepwise nucleophilic addition process, which governs this mechanic&#8208;force&#8208;promoted [4+1] cycloaddition reaction.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Bioinspired molecular engineering strategies have emerged as powerful tools that significantly enhance the development of novel therapeutics, improving efficacy, specificity, and safety in disease treatment. Recent advancements have focused on identifying and utilizing disease&#8208;associated biomarkers to optimize drug activity and address challenges inherent in traditional therapeutics, such as frequent drug administrations, poor patient adherence, and increased risk of adverse effects. In this review, we provide a comprehensive overview of the latest developments in bioinspired artificial systems (BAS) that use molecular engineering to tailor therapeutic responses to drugs in the presence of disease&#8208;specific biomarkers. We examine the transition from open&#8208;loop systems, which rely on external cues, to closed&#8208;loop feedback systems capable of autonomous self&#8208;regulation in response to disease&#8208;associated biomarkers. We detail various BAS modalities designed to achieve biomarker&#8208;driven therapy, including activatable prodrug molecules, smart drug delivery platforms, autonomous artificial cells, and synthetic receptor&#8208;based cell therapies, elucidating their operational principles and practical in vivo applications. Finally, we discuss the current challenges and future perspectives in the advancement of BAS&#8208;enabled technology and envision that ongoing advancements toward more programmable and customizable BAS&#8208;based therapeutics will significantly enhance precision medicine.</dc:description>

         <title>Chiral Br&#248;nsted Acid&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Reaction via Vinylidene ortho&#8208;Quinone Methides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Vinylidene ortho&#8208;quinone methides (VQMs) have been proven to be versatile and crucial intermediates in the catalytic asymmetric reaction in last decade, and thus have drawn considerable concentrations on account of the practical application in the construction of enantiomerically pure functional organic molecules. However, in comparison to the well established  chiral Br&#248;nsted base&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric reaction via VQMs, chiral Br&#248;nsted acid&#8208;catalyzed reaction is rarely studied and there is no systematic summary to date. In this review, we summarize the recent advances in the chiral Br&#248;nsted acid&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric reaction via VQMs according to three types of reactions: a) intermolecular asymmetric nucleophilic addition to VQMs; b) intermolecular asymmetric cycloaddition of VQMs; c) intramolecular asymmetric cyclization of VQMs. Finally, we put forward the remained challenges and opportunities for potential breakthroughs in this area.</dc:description>

         <title>Thiolated Cyanines Appended to Partially Pegylated Gold Nanoparticles for Fluorescence Quenching of Two&#8208;Channel Photothermal Inks</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Following a new approach, we prepared a nanoink with two separate photothermally responsive absorption bands. One is the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) absorption of gold nanoparticles (AuNP, d =17 nm), the second is the absorption band of two cyanine (Cy) dyes, Cy7&#8208;C6 or Cy7&#8208;C11, grafted to the AuNP surface through thiolated bridges of different lengths: the close proximity to the Au surface induces full quenching of the Cy fluorescence, resulting in thermal relaxation on irradiation. Attempts to full coat AuNP with the lipophilic Cy7&#8208;C6 and Cy7&#8208;C11 lead to precipitation from aqueous solutions. We thus prepared AuNP with partial pegylation (30, 50, or 70%), using a long chain thiol&#8208;terminated PEG bearing a &#8208;COOH function. Addition until saturation of either Cy7&#8208;C6 or Cy7&#8208;C11 to the partially pegylated AuNP gave the AuNP@Cy/PEGX% hybrids (X = 30, 50, 70) that are stable in water and in the water/alcohol mixtures used to prepare the nanoinks. Further overcoating of AuNP@Cy7&#8208;C6/PEG50% with PAH (polyallylamine hydrochloride) avoids LSPR hybridization in the dry nanoink printouts, that present two separate bands. When irradiated with laser sources near their absorption maxima, the printouts of the AuNP@Cy7&#8208;C6/PEG50%@PAH nanoink respond on two channels, giving different temperature increases depending on the irradiation wavelength.</dc:description>

         <title>Elucidating Heavy Atom Tunneling Kinetics in the Cope Rearrangement of Semibullvalene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this work, we characterize the temperature dependence of kinetic properties in heavy atom tunneling reactions
by means of molecular dynamics simulations, including nuclear quantum effects (NQEs) via Path Integral theory. To this end, we consider the prototypical Cope rearrangement of semibullvalene.
The reaction was studied in the 25&#8208;300K temperature range observing that the inclusion of NQEs modifies the temperature behavior of both free energy barriers and dynamical recrossing factors with respect to classical dynamics. Notably, while in classical simulations the activation free energy shows a very weak temperature dependence, it becomes strongly dependent on temperature when NQEs are included.
This temperature behavior shows a transition from a regime where the quantum effects are limited and can mainly be traced back to
zero point energy, to a low temperature regime where tunneling plays a dominant role.
In this regime, the free energy curve tunnels below the potential energy barrier along the reaction coordinate,&#160; allowing much faster reaction rates.
Finally, the temperature dependence of the rate constants obtained from molecular dynamics simulations was compared with available experimental data and with semi&#8208;classical transition state theory calculations, showing comparable behaviors and similar transition temperatures from&#160; thermal to (deep) tunneling regime.</dc:description>

         <title>Stereochemically Active Lone Pairs Stabilizing Intrinsic Vacancy Defects in Thermoelectric InTe</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Harvesting waste heat efficiently with thermoelectric energy conversion requires materials with low thermal conductivity. Recently, it was demonstrated how dynamic lone pair expression in thermoelectric InTe is responsible for giant anharmonicity leading to a very low lattice thermal conductivity. InTe also contains correlated disorder of intrinsic defects due to vacancies, and this contributes to additional lowering of the thermal conductivity. Here we use the three&#8208;dimensional difference pair distribution (3D&#8208;&#916;PDF) to analyze 25 K single crystal diffuse X&#8208;ray scattering from InTe to unravel the local defect structure, and propose a microscopic structural model. Extended off&#8208;centering of In+ ions induced by vacancies allows for the local expression of stereochemically active lone pairs. The associated electronic stabilization is proposed to be a driving force for the formation of In+ vacancy defects in InTe.</dc:description>

         <title>Stereoselective Crystallization of Chiral Pharmaceuticals Aided by Cellulose Derivatives through Helical Pattern Matching</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Stereoselective inhibition aided by "tailor&#8208;made" polymeric additives is an efficient approach to obtain enantiopure compounds through conglomerate crystallization. The chemical and configurational match between the side groups of polymers and the molecules of undesired enantiomer is considered to be a necessary condition for successful stereoseparation. Whereas in this contribution, we present an effective resolution of chiral pharmaceuticals by using cellulose acetates as the additives, which stereoselectively reside on the specific crystal faces of one enantiomer and inhibit its crystal nucleation and growth through helical pattern and supramolecular interaction complementarity. An investigation of nimodipine serves as a case study to highlight the novelty of this strategy wherein R&#8208;crystals exhibiting an impressive enantiomeric excess value of 97% can be attained by employing a mere 0.01 wt% cellulose acetate. Guaifenesin and phenyl lactic acid are also well&#8208;resolved by utilizing this methodology. Our work not only brings about a brand&#8208;new design strategy for &#8220;tailor&#8208;made&#8221; additives, but will also promote the further exploration of the endless potential for utilizing natural biomolecules in chiral recognition and resolution.</dc:description>

         <title>In Situ Generation and High Bioresistance of Trityl&#8208;based Semiquinone Methide Radicals under Anaerobic Conditions in Cellular Systems</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Bioreduction of spin labels and polarizing agents (generally stable radicals) has been an obstacle limiting the in&#8208;cell applications of pulsed electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy and dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP). In this work, we have demonstrated that two semiquinone methide radicals (OXQM&#8226; and CTQM&#8226;) can be easily produced from the trityl&#8208;based quinone methides (OXQM and CTQM) via reduction by various reducing agents including biothiols and ascorbate under anaerobic conditions. Both radicals have relatively low pKa&#8217;s and exhibit EPR single line signals at physiological pH. Moreover, the bioreduction of OXQM in three cell lysates enables quantitative generation of OXQM&#8226; which was most likely mediated by flavoenzymes. Importantly, the resulting OXQM&#8226; exhibited extremely high stability in the E.coli lysate under anaerobic conditions with 76&#8208; and 14.3&#8208;fold slower decay kinetics as compared to the trityl OX063 and a gem&#8208;diethyl pyrrolidine nitroxide.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Bioreduction of spin labels and polarizing agents (generally stable radicals) has been an obstacle limiting the in-cell applications of pulsed electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy and dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP). In this work, we have demonstrated that two semiquinone methide radicals (OXQM&#8226; and CTQM&#8226;) can be easily produced from the trityl-based quinone methides (OXQM and CTQM) via reduction by various reducing agents including biothiols and ascorbate under anaerobic conditions. Both radicals have relatively low pKa&#8217;s and exhibit EPR single line signals at physiological pH. Moreover, the bioreduction of OXQM in three cell lysates enables quantitative generation of OXQM&#8226; which was most likely mediated by flavoenzymes. Importantly, the resulting OXQM&#8226; exhibited extremely high stability in the E.coli lysate under anaerobic conditions with 76- and 14.3-fold slower decay kinetics as compared to the trityl OX063 and a gem-diethyl pyrrolidine nitroxide. Intracellular delivery of OXQM into HeLa cells was also achieved by covalent conjugation with a cell-permeable peptide as evidenced by the stable intracellular EPR signal from the OXQM&#8226; moiety. Owing to extremely high resistance of OXQM&#8226; towards bioreduction, OXQM and its derivatives show great application potential in in-cell EPR and in-cell DNP studies for various cells which can endure short-term anoxic treatments.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Clathrate Hydrates as a Kind of Promising Ice Nanoreactors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Since their discovery, clathrate hydrates (CHs) have received great attention both from theoretical and experimental aspects due to their great potential for gas storage and prospective applications as icy crystal materials. However, there has been limited research on the decomposition, reduction or other reactions of gases enclosed in CHs. Thanks to their unique hydrogen bonding network and cavity structures, CHs can serve as the promising nanoreactors to achieve chemical conversions, e.g. reducing greenhouse gases. In this review&#8208;type article, we characterize the potential performance of such CHs nanoreactors by discussing their multiple functions including important roles of hydrogen bonds in CHs, e.g. the confinement effect and proton source, and then discuss the enhanced electron&#8208;binding ability of guest molecules and the structures and properties of trapped electrons in the stacked nanocages, which contribute to our understanding of chemical reactions occurring in CHs. Finally, we provide detailed analyses of representative reaction mechanisms underwent in CH nanoreactors and effective investigation methods. This review&#8208;type article aims to provide a detailed summary about the functional characteristics of CHs and reactivity in CHs, which make CHs a kind of promising icy nanoreactors.</dc:description>

         <title>Probing Basal and Prismatic Planes of Graphitic Materials for Metal Single Atom and Subnanometer Cluster Stabilization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Supported metal single atom catalysis is a dynamic research area in catalysis science combining the advantages of homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysis. Understanding the interactions between metal single atoms and the support constitutes a challenge facing the development of such catalysts, since these interactions are essential in optimizing the catalytic performance. For conventional carbon supports, two types of surfaces can contribute to single atom stabilization: the basal planes and the prismatic surface; both of which can be decorated by defects and surface oxygen groups. To date, most studies on carbon&#8208;supported single atom catalysts focused on nitrogen&#8208;doped carbons, which, unlike classic carbon materials, have a fairly well&#8208;defined chemical environment. Herein we report the synthesis, characterization and modeling of rhodium single atom catalysts supported on carbon materials presenting distinct concentrations of surface oxygen groups and basal/prismatic surface area. The influence of these parameters on the speciation of the Rh species, their coordination and ultimately on their catalytic performance in hydrogenation and hydroformylation reactions is analyzed. The results obtained show that catalysis itself is an interesting tool for the fine characterization of these materials, for which the detection of small quantities of metal clusters remains a challenge, even when combining several cutting&#8208;edge analytical methods.</dc:description>

         <title>Strategies to Design Chemocatalytic Racemization of Tertiary Alcohols: State of the Art &amp; Utilization for Dynamic Kinetic Resolution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 36, June 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In the challenging field of racemizing tertiary alcohols, recently different concepts were developed. Suitable catalysts for efficient racemization and suppressing unwanted side&#8208;reactions were found. Besides Br&#248;nsted acids, oxovanadium complexes and piperidine turned out to be useful catalysts. The latter two types proved to be compatible with a lipase, thus leading to the first examples of chemoenzymatic dynamic kinetic resolution of tertiary alcohols.







Abstract
The synthesis of enantiomerically pure tertiary alcohols is an important issue in organic synthesis of a range of pharmaceuticals including molecules such as the anti&#8208;HIV drug Efavirenz. A conceptually elegant approach to such enantiomers is the dynamic kinetic resolution of racemic tertiary alcohols, which, however, requires efficient racemization strategies. The racemization of tertiary alcohols is particularly challenging due to various side reactions that can occur because of their high tendency for elimination reactions. In the last few years, several complementary catalytic concepts for racemization of tertiary alcohols have been developed, characterized by efficient racemization and suppression of unwanted side&#8208;reactions. Besides resins bearing sulfonic acid moieties and a combination of boronic acid and oxalic acid as heterogeneous and homogeneous Br&#248;nsted&#8208;acids, respectively, immobilized oxovanadium and piperidine turned out to be useful catalysts. The latter two catalysts, which have already been applied to different types of substrates, also have proven good compatibility with lipase, thus leading to the first two examples of chemoenzymatic dynamic kinetic resolution of tertiary alcohols. In this review, the difficulties in racemizing tertiary alcohols are specifically described, and the recently developed complementary concepts to overcome these hurdles are summarized.

         <title>Pathway Selection in Temporal Evolution of Supramolecular Polymers of Ionic &#960;&#8208;Systems: Amphiphilic Organic Solvent Dictates the Fate of Water</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 36, June 25, 2024. </description>

AOS dictates aqueous: The temporal evolution of short supramolecular polymers (SPs) of ionic &#960;&#8208;systems into long SP networks in water and amphiphilic organic solvent (AOS) mixture follows two distinct pathways. The release or retaining water from ionic &#960;&#8208;systems is the key for pathway selection, and it is dictated by AOS.







Abstract
Understanding solvent&#8208;solute interactions is essential to designing and synthesising soft materials with tailor&#8208;made functions. Although the interaction of the solute with the solvent mixture is more complex than the single solvent medium, solvent mixtures are exciting to unfold several unforeseen phenomena in supramolecular chemistry. Here, we report two unforeseen pathways observed during the hierarchical assembly of cationic perylene diimides (cPDIs) in water and amphiphilic organic solvent (AOS) mixtures. When the aqueous supramolecular polymers (SPs) of cPDIs are injected into AOS, initially kinetically trapped short SPs are formed, which gradually transform into thermodynamically stable high aspect ratio SP networks. Using various experimental and theoretical investigations, we found that this temporal evolution follows two distinct pathways depending on the nature of the water&#8208;AOS interactions. If the AOS is isopropanol (IPA), water is released from cPDIs into bulk IPA due to strong hydrogen bonding interactions, which further decreases the monomer concentration of cPDIs (Pathway&#8208;1). In the case of dioxane AOS, cPDI monomer concentration further increases as water is retained among cPDIs (Pathway&#8208;2) due to relatively weak interactions between dioxane and water. Interestingly, these two pathways are accelerated by external stimuli such as heat and mechanical agitation.

         <title>Temperature Control of the Self&#8208;Assembly Process of 4&#8208;Aminoquinoline Amphiphile: Selective Construction of Perforated Vesicles and Nanofibers, and Structural Restoration Capability</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 36, June 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report the selective construction of perforated vesicles and nanofibers based on temperature control of self&#8208;assembly process of a 4&#8208;aminoquinoline&#8208;based amphiphile through its LCST behavior in 10&#8197;mM HEPES buffer (pH&#8197;7.4). The perforated vesicles exhibit a slow morphological transformation but can be readily restored with a brief heating above the LCST.







Abstract
The construction of diverse and distinctive self&#8208;assembled structures in water, based on the control of the self&#8208;assembly processes of artificial small molecules, has received considerable attention in supramolecular chemistry. Cage&#8208;like perforated vesicles are distinctive and interesting self&#8208;assembled structures. However, the development of self&#8208;assembling molecules that can easily form perforated vesicles remains challenging. This paper reports a lower critical solution temperature (LCST) behavior&#8208;triggered self&#8208;assembly property of a 4&#8208;aminoquinoline (4&#8208;AQ)&#8208;based amphiphile with a tetra(ethylene glycol) chain, in HEPES buffer (pH&#8197;7.4). This property allows to form perforated vesicles after heating at 80&#8201;&#176;C (&gt; LCST). The self&#8208;assembly process of the 4&#8208;AQ amphiphile can be controlled by heating at 80&#8201;&#176;C (&gt; LCST) or 60&#8201;&#176;C (&lt; LCST). After cooling to room temperature, the selective construction of the perforated vesicles and nanofibers was achieved from the same 4&#8208;AQ amphiphile. Furthermore, the perforated vesicles exhibited slow morphological transformation into intertwined&#8208;like nanofibers but were easily restored by brief heating above the LCST.

     alt="Temperature Control of the Self-Assembly Process of 4-Aminoquinoline Amphiphile: Selective Construction of Perforated Vesicles and Nanofibers, and Structural Restoration Capability"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We report the selective construction of perforated vesicles and nanofibers based on temperature control of self-assembly process of a 4-aminoquinoline-based amphiphile through its LCST behavior in 10&#8197;mM HEPES buffer (pH&#8197;7.4). The perforated vesicles exhibit a slow morphological transformation but can be readily restored with a brief heating above the LCST.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The construction of diverse and distinctive self-assembled structures in water, based on the control of the self-assembly processes of artificial small molecules, has received considerable attention in supramolecular chemistry. Cage-like perforated vesicles are distinctive and interesting self-assembled structures. However, the development of self-assembling molecules that can easily form perforated vesicles remains challenging. This paper reports a lower critical solution temperature (LCST) behavior-triggered self-assembly property of a 4-aminoquinoline (4-AQ)-based amphiphile with a tetra(ethylene glycol) chain, in HEPES buffer (pH&#8197;7.4). This property allows to form perforated vesicles after heating at 80&#8201;&#176;C (&amp;gt; LCST). The self-assembly process of the 4-AQ amphiphile can be controlled by heating at 80&#8201;&#176;C (&amp;gt; LCST) or 60&#8201;&#176;C (&amp;lt; LCST). After cooling to room temperature, the selective construction of the perforated vesicles and nanofibers was achieved from the same 4-AQ amphiphile. Furthermore, the perforated vesicles exhibited slow morphological transformation into intertwined-like nanofibers but were easily restored by brief heating above the LCST.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Electrophotocatalysis Versus Indirect Electrolysis: Electrochemical Selenocyclization of 3&#8208;Aza&#8208;1,5&#8208;dienes Facilitated by Energy Transfer, Direct Photolysis or N&#8208;Hydroxyphthalimide</title>

         <dc:description>
Two new archetypes of electrophotocatalysis, including the first example of energy&#8208;transfer&#8208;involved photo/electro dual catalysis and the direct photolysis&#8208;involved one, as well as a NHPI&#8208;catalyzed electrochemical selenocyclization, are presented. These catalytic platforms enable direct syntheses of seleno 4&#8208;pyrrolin&#8208;2&#8208;ones from 1,5&#8208;dienes with broad substrate scopes in a mild, clean, Se&#8208;economic, regioselective and oxidant&#8208; and metal&#8208;free manner.







Abstract
Three hybrid electrochemical protocols, which involve the energy transfer, direct photolysis and N&#8208;hydroxyphthalimide catalyst, respectively, are presented for the selenylation/cyclization of the fragile substrates of 3&#8208;aza&#8208;1,5&#8208;dienes with diorganyl diselenides to afford 3&#8208;selenomethyl&#8208;4&#8208;pyrrolin&#8208;2&#8208;ones. The two electrophotocatalytic reactions and the indirect electrolysis one are both regioselective and external&#8208;oxidant&#8208; and transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free, and are associated with a broad substrate scope and high Se&#8208;economy, and all three methods are amenable to gram&#8208;scale syntheses, late&#8208;stage functionalizations, sunlight&#8208;induced experiments and all&#8208;solar&#8208;driven syntheses.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Organic Framework PCN&#8208;224 Combined Cobalt Oxide Nanoparticles for Hypoxia Relief and Synergistic Photodynamic/Chemodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 36, June 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We design and synthesize a tumor targeted nanoplatform (PCN&#8208;224@Co3O4&#8208;HA). HA can specifically target 4T1 cells and Co3O4 can produce oxygen in&#8197;situ to alleviate the hypoxic environment of the tumor. This nanosystem presents reliable biosafety performance, and can combine with PDT and CDT therapy to prevent the growth of tumor.







Abstract
Photodynamic therapy (PDT) and chemodynamic therapy (CDT) are promising tumor treatments mediated by reactive oxygen species (ROS), which have the advantages of being minimally invasive. However, the hypoxia of tumor microenvironment and poor target ability often reduce the therapeutic effect. Here we propose a tumor targeted nanoplatform PCN&#8208;224@Co3O4&#8208;HA for enhanced PDT and synergistic CDT, constructed by hyaluronate&#8208;modified Co3O4 nanoparticles decorated metal&#8208;organic framework PCN&#8208;224. Co3O4 can catalyze the decomposition of highly expressed H2O2 in tumor cells to produce oxygen and alleviate the problem of hypoxia. It can also produce hydroxyl radicals according to the Fenton&#8208;like reaction for chemical dynamic therapy, significantly improving the therapeutic effect. The cell survival experiment showed that after in&#8197;vitro treatment, 4T1 and MCF&#8208;7 cancer cells died in a large area under the anaerobic state, while the survival ability of normal cell L02 was nearly unchanged. This result effectively indicated that PCN&#8208;224@Co3O4&#8208;HA could effectively relieve tumor hypoxia and improve the effect of PDT and synergistic CDT. Cell uptake experiments showed that PCN&#8208;224@Co3O4&#8208;HA had good targeting properties and could effectively aggregate in tumor cells. In vivo experiments on mice, PCN&#8208;224@Co3O4&#8208;HA presented reliable biosafety performance, and can cooperate with PDT and CDT therapy to prevent the growth of tumor.

Discover how X&#8208;ray absorption and X&#8208;ray emission spectroscopy analyses unveil insights into the geometric and electronic properties of copper hydride complexes. The integration of experimental and theoretical approaches offers a holistic approach in detecting and characterizing hydride ligands in copper complexes.







Abstract
Transition metal complexes, particularly copper hydrides, play an important role in various catalytic processes and molecular inorganic chemistry. This study employs synchrotron hard X&#8208;ray spectroscopy to gain insights into the geometric and electronic properties of copper hydrides as potential catalysts for CO2 hydrogenation. The potential of high energy resolution X&#8208;ray absorption near&#8208;edge structure (HERFD&#8208;XANES) and valence&#8208;to&#8208;core X&#8208;ray emission (VtC&#8208;XES) is demonstrated with measurement on Stryker's reagent (Cu6H6) and [Cu3(&#956;3&#8208;H)(dpmppe)2](PF6)2 (Cu3H), alongside a non&#8208;hydride copper compound ICu(dtbppOH) (Cuy&#8722;I). The XANES analysis reveals that coordination geometries strongly influence the spectra, providing only indirect details about hydride coordination. The VtC&#8208;XES analysis exhibits a distinct signal around 8975&#8197;eV, offering a diagnostic tool to identify hydride ligands. Theoretical calculations support and extend these findings by comparing hydride&#8208;containing complexes with their hydride&#8208;free counterparts.

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Intramolecular Hydrosilylation of Alkynes: Embracing Conventional and Electrochemical Routes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 36, June 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This paper presents a nickel&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular hydrosilylation of various aryl silanes containing a triple bond. The Ni(0) catalyst was generated through a simple reduction of the NiBr2bipy pre&#8208;catalyst using manganese metal or via electroreduction. In the latter case, the amount of electrons involved is catalytic, making the process highly manageable.







Abstract
Nickel&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular hydrosilylation can be efficiently achieved with high regio&#8208; and stereoselectivities through two distinct methodologies. The first approach utilizes a conventional method, involving the reduction of nickel salt (NiBr2&#8208;2,2&#8217;&#8208;bipyridine) using manganese metal. The second method employs a one&#8208;step electrochemical reaction, utilizing the sacrificial anode process and NiBr2bipy catalysis. Both methods yield silylated heterocycles in good to high yields through a syn&#8208;exo&#8208;dig cyclization process. Control experiments and molecular electrochemistry (cyclic voltammetry) provided further insights into the reaction mechanism.

         <dc:description>
A visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced remote alkyl thiocyanation via ring&#8208;opening functionalization of cycloalkanols with the electrophilic N&#8208;thiocyanatosaccharin has been developed. A series of valuable ketones with remote thiocyanato substituent have been efficiently synthesized without transition metals and oxidants in moderate to good yields. This protocol provides possibility for the synthesis of some bioactive compounds with remote thiocyanato groups.







Abstract
The remote C(sp3)&#8208;SCN bond formation via ring&#8208;opening functionalization of cycloalkanols with N&#8208;thiocyanatosaccharin as the precursor of SCN radicals and pyrylium salt as the organic photocatalyst under visible light has been developed. Thus, various terminal keto thiocyanates were prepared without transition metals and oxidants in moderate to good yields. The simplicity, wide substrate scope and mild conditions feature its synthetic application capability.

         <title>Intramolecular Cyclopropanation of Active Methylene Derivatives Based on FeCl2 or FeCl3&#8208;Promoted Radical&#8208;Polar Crossover Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 36, June 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The bicyclic cyclopropanes were synthesized by two radical&#8208;polar crossover reactions based on the FeCl3&#8208;promoted oxidative radical cyclization of active methylene derivatives and the redox radical cyclization of &#945;&#8208;chloro&#8208;active methylenes using the subcatalytic amount of FeCl2 and ligand.







Abstract
Radical&#8208;polar crossover reactions were studied for the intramolecular cyclopropanation of active methylene derivatives. In the presence of FeCl3 as a stoichiometric oxidant and K2HPO4 as a base, the dehydrogenative cyclopropanation of active methylenes proceeded through the FeCl3&#8208;promoted oxidative radical cyclization followed by the ionic cyclization to give the bicyclic cyclopropanes. The use of &#945;&#8208;chloro&#8208;active methylenes leads the subcatalytic cyclopropanation involving two redox pathways. In the presence of K2HPO4, the redox cyclopropanation proceeded by using FeCl2 (20&#8197;mol%) in combination with ligand (20&#8197;mol%).

         <title>Application of Mono and Trinuclear Cyclometalated Iridium (III) Complexes in Differential Bacterial Imaging and Antimicrobial Photodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 36, June 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Luminescent transition metal complexes act as potential photosensitizers for antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (aPDT) against multidrug&#8208;resistant (MDR) bacterial infection. We designed luminescent mono and trinuclear cyclometalated Ir(III) complexes for bacterial imaging and antibacterial activity against Methicillin&#8208;resistant S. aureus (MRSA), L. lactis, C. jejuni, and E. coli. Trinuclear Ir (III) complex unveiled more excellent phototherapeutic antibacterial activity against MRSA. These complexes could be valuable candidates for fighting bacterial infections effectively.







Abstract
The application of transition metal complexes for antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (PDT) has emerged as an attractive alternative in mitigating a broad range of bacterial pathogens, including multidrug&#8208;resistant pathogens. In view of their photostability, long excited&#8208;state lifetimes, and tunable emission properties, transition metal complexes also contribute as bioimaging agents. In the present work, we designed mono and trinuclear cyclometalated iridium (III) complexes to explore their imaging application and antibacterial potential. For this, we used Methicillin&#8208;resistant S. aureus (MRSA), the most prevalent of community&#8208;associated (CA) multidrug&#8208;resistant (MDR) bacteria (CA MDR) and Lactococcus lactis (L. lactis) as Gram&#8208;positive while Campylobacter jejuni (C. jejuni) and E. coli as Gram&#8208;negative bacteria. In addition to differential bioimaging of these bacteria, we assessed the antibacterial effects of both mono and trinuclear Ir(III) complexes under exposure to 427&#8197;nm LED light. The data presented herein strongly suggest better efficacy of trinuclear Ir(III) complex over the mononuclear complex in imparting photoinduced cell death of MRSA. Based on the safety profile of these complexes, we propose that trinuclear cyclometalated iridium(III) complex holds great promise for selective recognition and targeting MDR bacteria with minimal off&#8208;target effect.

         <title>Application of Sublimation in the Synthesis and Crystal Growth of Organosulfones</title>

1,6&#8208;trans&#8208;substituted bis(arylsulfone) trienes undergo aromatization and elimination of phenylsulfinic acid during sublimation leading to the growth of high quality, pure single crystals of the resulting (4&#8208;phenylsulfonyl)biphenyls in the desublimation area.







Abstract
The solvent&#8208;free elimination of sulfinic acid and aromatization of 1,6&#8208;trans&#8208;substituted bis(arylsulfone) trienes is reported. It is shown that sublimation can be used as a &#8216;green&#8217; method to combine the thermal transformation of six trienes and the crystal growth of the resulting 4&#8208;(phenylsulfonyl)biphenyls. When the sublimation conditions are carefully controlled, high quality single crystals of the 4&#8208;(phenylsulfonyl)biphenyls are obtained. Theoretical modelling of the reaction using the simplified triene Ph&#8208;(CH)6&#8208;SO2H showed that the cyclization is energetically feasible and that the complete conversion is possible during the timescale of the sublimation. At temperatures slightly higher than the optimum sublimation temperature two of the trienes transformed into 1,4&#8208;cyclohexadienes that did not eliminate phenylsulfinic acid. A reaction mechanism involving a 1,3&#8208;hydrogen shift induced by free PhS&#8226; radicals is proposed for the formation of the 1,4&#8208;cyclohexadienes.

         <title>Efficient Blue Photo&#8208; and Electroluminescence from CF3&#8208;Decorated Cu(I) Complexes</title>

Two blue&#8208;emitting Cu(I)&#8208;based carbene&#8208;metal&#8208;amide complexes are developed by using CF3&#8208;decorated carbazole ligands. The resultant vacuum&#8208;deposited organic light&#8208;emitting diodes deliver pure&#8208;blue electroluminescence and a high external quantum efficiency.







Abstract
Luminescent organometallic complexes of earth&#8208;abundant copper(I) have long been studied in organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLED). Particularly, Cu(I)&#8208;based carbene&#8208;metal&#8208;amide (CMA) complexes have recently emerged as promising organometallic emitters. However, blue&#8208;emitting Cu(I) CMA complexes have been rarely reported. Here we constructed two blue&#8208;emitting Cu(I) CMA emitters, MAC*&#8208;Cu&#8208;CF3Cz and MAC*&#8208;Cu&#8208;2CF3Cz, by introducing one or two CF3 substitutes into carbazole ligands. Both complexes exhibited high thermal stability and blue emission colors. Moreover, two complexes exhibited different emission origins rooting from different donor ligands: a distinct thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) from ligand&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge transfer excited states for MAC*&#8208;Cu&#8208;CF3Cz or a dominant phosphorescence nature from local triplet excited state of the carbazole ligand for MAC*&#8208;Cu&#8208;2CF3Cz. Inspiringly, MAC*&#8208;Cu&#8208;CF3Cz had high photoluminescence quantum yields of up to 94&#8201;% and short emission lifetimes of down to 1.2&#8197;&#956;s in doped films, accompanied by relatively high radiative rates in the 105&#8197;s&#8722;1 order. The resultant vacuum&#8208;deposited OLEDs based on MAC*&#8208;Cu&#8208;CF3Cz delivered pure&#8208;blue electroluminescence at 462&#8197;nm together with a high external quantum efficiency of 13.0&#8201;%.

         <title>Exploration of Vitamin B6&#8208;Based Redox&#8208;Active Pyridinium Salts Towards the Application in Aqueous Organic Flow Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 36, June 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of novel redox&#8208;active benzoyl pyridinium salts was prepared from pyridoxal hydrochloride. Cyclic voltammetry studies demonstrated redox reversibility under basic conditions with the redox wave corresponding to a two&#8208;electron process. Under the bulk electrolysis conditions, the reduction via consecutive electron transfer (ET) and proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET) follows by a proton transfer (PT) to give the secondary alcohol product.







Abstract
Pyridoxal hydrochloride, a vitamin B6 vitamer, was synthetically converted to a series of diverse redox&#8208;active benzoyl pyridinium salts. Cyclic voltammetry studies demonstrated redox reversibility under basic conditions, and two of the most promising salts were subjected to laboratory&#8208;scale flow battery tests involving galvanostatic cycling at 10&#8197;mM in 0.1&#8197;M NaOH. In these tests, the battery was charged completely, corresponding to the transfer of two electrons to the electrolyte, but no discharge was observed. Both CV analysis and electrochemical simulations confirmed that the redox wave observed in the experimental voltammograms corresponds to a two&#8208;electron process. To explain the irreversibility in the battery tests, we conducted bulk electrolysis with the benzoyl pyridinium salts, affording the corresponding benzylic secondary alcohols. Computational studies suggest that the reduction proceeds in three consecutive steps: first electron transfer (ET), then proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET) and finally proton transfer (PT) to give the secondary alcohol. 1H&#8197;NMR deuterium exchange studies indicated that the last PT step is not reversible in 0.1&#8197;M NaOH, rendering the entire redox process irreversible. The apparent reversibility observed in CV at the basic media likely arises from the slow rate of the PT step at the timescale of the measurement.

         <title>Ferrocene&#8208;Based N&#8208;Heterocyclic Silylenes: Monomeric Silanechalcogenones, Silanimines, Silirenes, and Insertion Products with P4</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 36, June 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reactivity of two ferrocene&#8208;based N&#8208;heterocyclic silylenes towards small to moderately sized molecular substrates (P4, S8, Se8, organic azides and alkynes) is studied. The aryl&#8208;substituted congener is more reactive than the sterically more encumbered and less ambiphilic 1,3,2&#8208;diazaborolyl homologue. Monomeric silanechalcogenones, silanimines and silirenes are readily available from both silylenes.







Abstract
The stable ferrocene&#8208;based N&#8208;heterocyclic silylenes fc[(N{B})2Si] (A; fc=1,1&#8217;&#8208;ferrocenylene, {B}=(HCNDipp)2B, Dipp=2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl) and fc[(NDipp)2Si] (B) are compared in a study focussing on their reactivity towards a range of small to moderately sized molecular substrates, viz. P4, S8, Se8, MesN3 (Mes=mesityl), RC&#8801;CH, and RC&#8801;CR (R=Ph, SiMe3). The Dipp&#8208;substituted congener B exhibits a more pronounced ambiphilicity and is sterically less congested than its 1,3,2&#8208;diazaborolyl&#8208;substituted relative A, in line with the higher reactivity of the former. The difference in reactivity is obviously due more to electronic than to steric reasons, as is illustrated by the fact that both A and B react with the comparatively bulky substrate MesN3 under mild conditions to afford the corresponding silanimine fc[(N{B})2Si=NMes] and fc[(NDipp)2Si=NMes], respectively. The heavier ketone analogues fc[(N{B})2Si=E] (E=S, Se, Te) are readily available from A and the corresponding chalcogen. In contrast, the reaction of the more reactive silylene B with elemental sulfur or selenium is unspecific, affording product mixtures. However, fc[(NDipp)2Si=Se] is selectively prepared from B and (Et2N)3PSe; the Te analogue is also accessible, but crystallises as head&#8208;to&#8208;tail dimer.

         <title>Proton Domino Reactions at an Imidazole Relay Control the Oxidation of a TyrZ&#8208;His190 Artificial Mimic of Photosystem II</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 36, June 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer from an imidazole&#8208;phenol ligand to a covalently bound photooxidant was characterized. Upon oxidation of the phenol, the hydrogen&#8208;bonded imidazole accepts the phenolic proton and releases a proton from its 1&#8208;nitrogen group stabilizing the oxidized state. The system works with low driving force and closely mimics the Tyrz&#8208;His couple at the donor side of photosystem II.







Abstract
A close mimic of P680 and the TyrosineZ&#8208;Histidine190 pair in photosystem II (PS II) has been synthesized using a ruthenium chromophore and imidazole&#8208;phenol ligands. The intramolecular oxidation of the ligands by the photoproduced Ru(III) species is characterized by a small driving force, very similar to PS II where the complexity of kinetics was attributed to the reversibility of electron transfer steps. Laser flash photolysis revealed biphasic kinetics for ligand oxidation. The fast phase (&#964;&lt;50&#8197;ns) corresponds to partial oxidation of the imidazole&#8208;phenol ligand, proton transfer within the hydrogen bond, and formation of a neutral phenoxyl radical. The slow phase (5&#8211;9&#8197;&#956;s) corresponds to full oxidation of the ligand which is kinetically controlled by deprotonation of the distant 1&#8208;nitrogen of the imidazolium. These results show that imidazole with its two protonatable sites plays a special role as a proton relay in a &#8216;proton domino&#8217; reaction.

The slow phase (5&#8211;9&#8197;&#956;s) corresponds to full oxidation of the ligand which is kinetically controlled by deprotonation of the distant 1-nitrogen of the imidazolium. These results show that imidazole with its two protonatable sites plays a special role as a proton relay in a &#8216;proton domino&#8217; reaction.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Insight into the Effect of Methylglyoxal on the Conformation, Function, and Aggregation Propensity of &#945;&#8208;Synuclein</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 36, June 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Methylglyoxal reacts with &#945;&#8208;synuclein (&#945;S) by forming a heterogeneous mixture of reaction products on specific Lys. Among them highlights the 2&#8208;ammonio&#8208;6&#8208;[1&#8208;(5&#8208;ammonio&#8208;6&#8208;oxido&#8208;6&#8208;oxohexyl)&#8208;5&#8208;methylimidazolium&#8208;3&#8208;yl] hexanoate (MOLD), which crosslinks two Lys. The formation of these MG&#8208;derived AGEs had a scarce effect on the averaged conformational ensemble of &#945;S, but they completely depleted its native propensity to aggregate and its ability to bind, cluster and fusion synaptic&#8208;like vesicles.







Abstract
It is well&#8208;known that people suffering from hyperglycemia have a higher propensity to develop Parkinson's disease (PD). One of the most plausible mechanisms linking these two pathologies is the glycation of neuronal proteins and the pathological consequences of it. &#945;&#8208;Synuclein, a key component in PD, can be glycated at its fifteen lysine. In fact, the end products of this process have been detected on aggregated &#945;&#8208;synuclein isolated from in&#8197;vivo. However, the consequences of glycation are not entirely clear, which are of crucial importance to understand the mechanism underlying the connection between diabetes and PD. To better clarify this, we have here examined how methylglyoxal (the most important carbonyl compound found in the cytoplasm) affects the conformation and aggregation propensity of &#945;&#8208;synuclein, as well as its ability to cluster and fuse synaptic&#8208;like vesicles. The obtained data prove that methylglyoxal induces the Lys&#8208;Lys crosslinking through the formation of MOLD. However, this does not have a remarkable effect on the averaged conformational ensemble of &#945;&#8208;synuclein, although it completely depletes its native propensity to form soluble oligomers and insoluble amyloid fibrils. Moreover, methylglyoxal has a disrupting effect on the ability of &#945;&#8208;synuclein to bind, cluster and fusion synaptic&#8208;like vesicles.

         <title>1,2,3&#8208;Triazole&#8208;Containing Azamacrocycles from Chiral Triazolopeptoids: Synthesis and Solid&#8208;State Studies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 36, June 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Conformational studies and synthetic applications of chiral macrocyclic triazolopeptoids, a class of peptidomimetics, are described. Reduction of amide bonds in the backbone afforded new azamacrocycles, containing 1,2,3 triazole moieties. X&#8208;ray crystallographic studies highlighted their complexation abilities.







Abstract
Two new chiral 1,2,3&#8208;triazole&#8208;containing macrocyclic oligoamides (i.&#8201;e.: triazolopeptoid 4 and 5) were obtained through solid&#8208;phase synthesis of linear precursors followed by high dilution macrocyclization reaction. Theoretical (DFT) and spectroscopic (NMR) studies revealed the intricate interplay between the N&#945;&#8208;chiral side chains and their conformational attitudes. BH3&#8208;mediated reduction of the tertiary amide groups of known 1&#8211;3 and newly synthesized 4 gave novel azamacrocycles 6&#8211;9. Detection of borane complexes of azamacrocycles 6 and 9 (i.&#8201;e.: 10 and 11), corroborated by X&#8208;ray diffraction studies, demonstrated the peculiar properties of 1,2,3&#8208;triazole&#8208;containing macrorings.

         <title>Afterglow Performance of Phenylenevinylene&#8208;Based Semiconducting Polymer Nanoparticles Doped with Photosensitizers Containing Electron&#8208;Withdrawing Groups</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 36, June 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
For the doped photosensitizers with strong electron&#8208;withdrawing groups, the stronger the electron&#8208;withdrawing ability of the group, the worse of the afterglow performance of the SPN regardless of the 1O2 generation ability of the photosensitizer. When the doped photosensitizer exhibited weak or none electron&#8208;withdrawing effect, the 1O2 generation ability of the photosensitizer played a dominant role on the afterglow performance of the SPNs.







Abstract
It is usually believed that doping with photosensitizers capable of generating singlet oxygen (1O2) plays a pivotal role in enhancing the afterglow performance of semiconducting polymer nanoparticles (SPNs). However, the effect of doping photosensitizer bearing electron&#8208;withdrawing groups has not been reported. Here we report the effect of doping with six photosensitizers possessing different electron&#8208;withdrawing groups on the afterglow performance of SPNs using poly[(9,9&#8208;di(2&#8208;ethylhexyl)&#8208;9H&#8208;fluo&#8208;rene&#8208;2,7&#8208;vinylene)&#8208;co&#8208;(1&#8208;methoxy&#8208;4&#8208;(2&#8208;ethylhexyloxy)&#8208;2,5&#8208;phenylenevinylene)] (PF&#8208;MEHPPV) as substrate. It was found that the afterglow performance of SPNs was significantly influenced by doping with photosensitizers bearing electron&#8208;withdrawing groups. For the doped photosensitizers with strong electron&#8208;withdrawing groups, the stronger the electron&#8208;withdrawing ability of the group, the worse of the afterglow performance of the SPN regardless of the 1O2 generation ability of the photosensitizer. When the doped photosensitizer exhibited weak or none electron&#8208;withdrawing effect, the 1O2 generation ability of the photosensitizer played a dominant role on the afterglow performance of the SPNs. This work deepens the understanding of the design and synthesis of SPNs with different afterglow properties.

         <title>Dynamics of Coordinated Phosphonate Group Directly Observed by 17O&#8208;NMR in Lanthanide(iii) Complexes of a Mono(ethyl phosphonate) DOTA Analogue</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 36, June 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dynamics of mutual exchange of coordinated and non&#8208;coordinated oxygen atoms on phosphate anion analogue was measured for the first time. It proceeds through a sterically demanding four&#8208;membered &#954;2&#8208;O2P chelate. Its energy barrier steeply increases for smaller Ln(III) ions and is accessible only in more flexible TSA isomers of large Ln(III) ions.







Abstract
Biological phosphates can coordinate metal ions and their complexes are common in living systems. Dynamics of mutual oxygen atom exchange in the tetrahedral group in complexes has not been investigated. Here, we present a direct experimental proof of exchange (&#8220;phosphonate rotation&#8221;) in model Ln(III) complexes of monophosphonate H4dota analogue which alters phosphorus atom chirality of coordinated phosphonate monoester. Combination of macrocycle&#8208;based isomerism with P&#8208;based chirality leads to several diastereoisomers. (Non)&#8208;coordinated oxygen atoms were distinguished through 17O&#8208;labelled phosphonate group and their mutual exchange was followed by various NMR techniques and DFT calculations. The process is sterically demanding and occurs through bulky bidentate (&#954;2&#8208;PO2)&#8722; coordination and was observed only in twisted&#8208;square antiprism (TSA) diastereoisomer of large Ln(III) ions. Its energy demands increase for smaller Ln(III) ions (298&#916;G&#8800;(exp./DFT)=51.8/52.1 and 61.0/71.5&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1 for La(III) and Eu(III), respectively). These results are helpful in design of such complexes as MRI CA and for protein paramagnetic NMR probes. It demonstrates usefulness of 17O NMR to study solution dynamics in complexes involving phosphorus acid derivatives and it may inspire use of this method to study dynamics of phosphoric acid derivatives (as e.&#8201;g. phosphorus acid&#8208;based inhibitors of metalloenzymes) in different areas of chemistry.

The process is sterically demanding and occurs through bulky bidentate (&#954;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;-PO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; coordination and was observed only in twisted-square antiprism (TSA) diastereoisomer of large Ln(III) ions. Its energy demands increase for smaller Ln(III) ions (&lt;sup&gt;298&lt;/sup&gt;&#916;&lt;i&gt;G&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8800;&lt;/sup&gt;(exp./DFT)=51.8/52.1 and 61.0/71.5&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; for La(III) and Eu(III), respectively). These results are helpful in design of such complexes as MRI CA and for protein paramagnetic NMR probes. It demonstrates usefulness of &lt;sup&gt;17&lt;/sup&gt;O NMR to study solution dynamics in complexes involving phosphorus acid derivatives and it may inspire use of this method to study dynamics of phosphoric acid derivatives (as e.&#8201;g. phosphorus acid-based inhibitors of metalloenzymes) in different areas of chemistry.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Asymmetric 1,4&#8208;Addition of Diarylphosphine Oxides to &#945;, &#946;&#8208;Unsaturated 2&#8208;Acyl Imidazoles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 36, June 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An asymmetric 1,4&#8208;addition of diarylphosphine oxides to &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated 2&#8208;acyl imidazoles catalyzed by oxazaborolidine (CBS) was disclosed in this work. Interestingly, this methodology features a wide range of substrates scope, simple catalytic system and mild reaction conditions (room temperature and air insensitive).







Abstract
Here we introduce a metal&#8208;free, catalytic and enantioselective strategy from &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated 2&#8208;acyl imidazoles to the chiral phosphorous 2&#8208;acyl imidazoles. Interestingly, this methodology was catalyzed by the classical and commercial oxazaborolidine under mild conditions. This strategy features a wide range of substrates scope with good yields and excellent enantioselectivities. The possible mechanism further suggests the key of this reaction through the cleavage of diarylphosphine oxides using Frustrated Lewis Pairs theory.

         <title>Modular Construction of Vinylene&#8208;Linked Covalent Organic Frameworks with Tunable Emission for Tumor Visualization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 36, June 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of isostructural vinylene&#8208;linked 2D COFs were constructed based on a new tetratopic D2h&#8208;symmetric monomer with two highly electron deficient s&#8208;triazine core. The fluorescence emission of the resulting D&#8722;A type COFs red&#8208;shifted with respect to the enhancement of the electronegativity of the donor unit. Their ability in non&#8208;invasive tumor visualization was further demonstrated.







Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with ordered &#960; structures are very promising in porous light&#8208;emitting materials. However, most of these COFs are either poor in luminescence or lack of water&#8208;stability. Herein, a series of isostructural D&#8722;A vinylene&#8208;linked COFs were constructed based a new D2h symmetric linker 1,4&#8208;bis(4,6&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triazin&#8208;2&#8208;yl)benzene (TMTA) with high crystallinity, comparative high surface area and excellent chemical/thermal stability. Impressively, their adsorption and luminescence wavelength vary with respect to the density of &#960;&#8208;systems in the electron&#8208;donating group, which constitute the foundation for molecular engineering the luminescent properties of vinylene&#8208;linked COFs. The DFT calculations further established the relationship between the luminescence properties and the donor electronic structure. Moreover, one of representative COF named FZU&#8208;203 showed inspiring applications in bioimaging, which may further provide strategic guidance for the use of vinylene&#8208;linked COFs as fluorescent nanoprobes in non&#8208;invasive medical diagnosis and visualization therapy of tumors.

         <title>Overcrowded 14,14&#8242;&#8208;Bidibenzo[a,j]anthracenes: Challenges in Syntheses and Atypical Property of Lacking Symmetry&#8208;Breaking Charge Transfer (SBCT)</title>

The overcrowded biaryl bears two highly distorted molecular halves and a small interplanar angle between two anthryl moieties (31&#176;, currently the lowest reported value). The close contact between the two aryl fragments endows them with intramolecular interactions. Whereas the restricted rocking around the central C&#8722;C bond suspends the formation of the symmetry&#8208;breaking charge transfer (SBCT) state.







Abstract
14,14&#8242;&#8208;Bidibenzo[a,j]anthracenes (BDBAs) were prepared by iridium&#8208;catalyzed annulation of 5,5&#8242;&#8208;biterphenylene with alkynes. The molecular geometries of overcrowded BDBAs were verified by X&#8208;ray crystallography. The two dibenzo[a,j]anthryl moieties are connected through the sterically hindered 14 positions, resulting in highly distorted molecular halves. The conformation with a small twist angle between two molecular halves can minimize steric conflicts between the substituents at 1 and 13 positions and the carbon atoms of the central axis, as well as steric clashes between those substituents. One such example is octafluoro&#8208;substituted BDBA, where the interplanar angle between two anthryl moieties is approximately 31&#176; (currently the lowest reported value, cf. 81&#176; in 9,9&#8242;&#8208;bianthracene). The intramolecular interactions and electronic couplings between two molecular halves resulted in upfield 1H NMR signals, redshifted absorption and emission bands, and a reduced HOMO&#8211;LUMO gap. Photodynamic investigations on BDBAs indicated that the formation of the conventional symmetry&#8208;breaking charge transfer (SBCT) state was suspended by restricted rocking around the central C&#8722;C bond. Such a mechanism associated with this highly constrained conformation was examined for the first time.

         <title>Divergent Synthesis of Pyrazoles via Manganese Pincer Complex Catalyzed Acceptorless Dehydrogenative Coupling Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 36, June 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Molecularly defined Mn(I)&#8208;complex catalyzed acceptorless dehydrogenative coupling (ADC) reactions employing alcohols as the carbon source enabled the synthesis of multi&#8208;substituted pyrazoles. Symmetrical pyrazoles were made via the coupling of 1,3&#8208;diols with hydrazines. The unsymmetrically substituted pyrazoles were created using the ADC reaction of primary alcohols with hydrazones.







Abstract
This report detailed the synthesis of multi&#8208;substituted pyrazoles through the acceptorless dehydrogenative coupling (ADC) reaction catalyzed by a well&#8208;defined manganese(I)&#8208;pincer complex. Symmetrically substituted pyrazoles were synthesized by reacting 1,3&#8208;diols with hydrazines. Unsymmetrically substituted pyrazoles were selectively made via the ADC of primary alcohols with methyl hydrazones. Water and hydrogen are liberated as the green byproducts. The endurance of these methodologies has been presented by producing 30 substrates with varied functionalities. Model reactions were scaled up to demonstrate practicability. The reaction rate and order were measured to transparent the involvement of the reagents during catalysis. Control experiments elucidated the plausible reaction mechanisms.

         <title>Photo/Mechanical/Acidic Multi&#8208;Stimuli Responses and Information Encryption Design of Acylhydrazone Derivative</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 36, June 25, 2024. </description>

Three polymorphs of acylhydrazone derivative are prepared, the mechanisms of their photo/mechanical/acidic multi&#8208;stimuli responses are investigated, and an information encryption system based on photochromism and acidochromism is developed.







Abstract
Stimuli&#8208;responsive crystalline materials have received much attention for being potential candidates of smart materials. However, the occurrence of polymorphism&#8208;driven stimuli responses in crystalline materials remains interesting but rare. Herein, three polymorphs of an acylhydrazone derivative, N&#8242;&#8208;[(E)&#8208;(1&#8208;benzofuran&#8208;2&#8208;yl) methylidene] pyridine &#8722;4&#8208;carbohydrazide (BFMP) were prepared. Form&#8208;1 undergoes a photomechanical response via E&#8594;Z photoisomerization under UV irradiation, accompanied by a decrease in fluorescence intensity and a change from colorless to yellow. Two types of Z&#8594;E thermal isomerization mechanisms with significant differences in conversion rate were observed at different temperatures in form&#8208;1. The solid&#8208;melt&#8208;solid transition has a faster conversion rate compared to the solid&#8208;solid transition due to freedom from lattice confinement. The transition from form&#8208;2 to form&#8208;3 can be achieved under grinding, coupled with a significant decrease in fluorescence intensity. The similar molecular stacking pattern of form&#8208;2 and form&#8208;3 provides a structural basis for the grinding&#8208;induced crystalline transition behavior. In addition, the presence of the pyridine moiety imparts an acidochromic property. The combination of photochromism and acidochromism explores the possible applications of acylhydrazone derivatives in information encryption.

         <title>Solution&#8208;State Structure of a Long&#8208;Loop G&#8208;Quadruplex Formed Within Promoters of Plasmodium falciparum B var Genes</title>

We report a high&#8208;resolution NMR solution&#8208;state structure of an intramolecular [3+1]&#8208;hybrid G&#8208;quadruplex formed by a 34&#8208;nt DNA sequence, d[CAG3T2A2G3TATA2CT3AG4T2AG3T2]. The G&#8208;quadruplex with a diagonal 10&#8208;nt loop shows a unique equilibrium between two structures, both stabilized by base stacking and non&#8208;standard hydrogen bonding. In addition to the 12&#8197;guanines involved in three G&#8208;quartets, most residues in the loop regions are well defined and involved in the interactions.







Abstract
We report the high&#8208;resolution NMR solution&#8208;state structure of an intramolecular G&#8208;quadruplex with a diagonal loop of ten nucleotides. The G&#8208;quadruplex is formed by a 34&#8208;nt DNA sequence, d[CAG3T2A2G3TATA2CT3AG4T2AG3T2], named UpsB&#8208;Q&#8208;1. This sequence is found within promoters of the var genes of Plasmodium falciparum, which play a key role in malaria pathogenesis and evasion of the immune system. The [3+1]&#8208;hybrid G&#8208;quadruplex formed under physiologically relevant conditions exhibits a unique equilibrium between two structures, both stabilized by base stacking and non&#8208;canonical hydrogen bonding. Unique equilibrium of the two closely related 3D structures originates from a North&#8208;South repuckering of deoxyribose moiety of residue T27 in the lateral loop. Besides the 12 guanines involved in three G&#8208;quartets, most residues in loop regions are involved in interactions at both G&#8208;quartet&#8208;loop interfaces.

         <title>Efficient Synthetic Access to Stable Isotope Labelled Pseudouridine Phosphoramidites for RNA NMR Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 36, June 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A perfect combination of nucleotide chemistry and enzyme catalysis. The work describes the efficient chemo&#8208;enzymatic production of stable isotope labeled RNA building blocks. The synthetic route outcompetes previously reported procedures and makes the production of stable isotope labeled pseudouridine RNA building blocks economically reasonable.







Abstract
Here we report the efficient synthetic access to 13C/15N&#8208;labelled pseudouridine phosphoramidites, which were incorporated into a binary H/ACA box guide RNA/product complex comprising 77 nucleotides (nts) in total and into a 75&#8197;nt E. coli tRNAGly. The stable isotope (SI) labelled pseudouridines were produced via a highly efficient chemo&#8208;enzymatic synthesis. 13C/15N labelled uracils were produced via chemical synthesis and enzymatically converted to pseudouridine 5&#8242;&#8208;monophosphate (&#936;MP) by using YeiN, a &#936;&#8208;5&#8242;&#8208;monophosphate C&#8208;glycosidase. Removal of the 5&#8242;&#8208;phosphate group yielded the desired pseudouridine nucleoside (&#936;), which was transformed into a phosphoramidite building suitable for RNA solid phase synthesis. A &#936; &#8208;building block carrying both a 13C and a 15N label was incorporated into a product RNA and the complex formation with a 63&#8197;nt H/ACA box RNA could be observed via NMR. Furthermore, the SI labelled pseudouridine building block was used to determine imino proton bulk water exchange rates of a 75&#8197;nt E. coli tRNAGly CCmnm5U, identifying the T&#936;C&#8208;loop 5&#8208;methyluridine as a modifier of the exchange rates. The efficient synthetic access to SI&#8208;labelled &#936; building blocks will allow the solution and solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopic studies of &#936; containing RNAs and will facilitate the mass spectrometric analysis of &#936;&#8208;modified nucleic acids.

         <title>A Highly Sterically Encumbered Boron Lewis Acid Enabled by an Organotellurium&#8208;Based Ligand</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 36, June 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The new boron Lewis acid B[OTeF3(C6F5)2]3 combines one of the most sterically encumbered boron centres with a Lewis acidity comparable to that of B(C6F5)3. It additionally provides ligand transfer reactivity towards fluoride compounds as shown in the synthesis of an Au(III) complex and a hypervalent iodine species.







Abstract
Lewis acidic boron compounds are ubiquitous in chemistry due to their numerous applications, yet tuning and optimizing their properties towards different purposes is still a challenging field of research. In this work, the boron&#8208;based Lewis acid B[OTeF3(C6F5)2]3 was synthesized by reaction of the teflate derivative HOTeF3(C6F5)2 with BCl3 or BCl3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;SMe2. This new compound presents a remarkably high thermal stability up to 300&#8201;&#176;C, as well as one of the most sterically encumbered boron centres known in the literature. Theoretical and experimental methods revealed that B[OTeF3(C6F5)2]3 exhibits a comparable Lewis acidity to that of the well&#8208;known B(C6F5)3. The affinity of B[OTeF3(C6F5)2]3 towards pyridine was accessed by Isothermal Titration Calorimetry (ITC) and compared to that of B(OTeF5)3 and B(C6F5)3. The ligand&#8208;transfer reactivity of this new boron compound towards different fluorides was demonstrated by the formation of an anionic Au(III) complex and a hypervalent iodine(III) species.

         <title>Ammonothermal Synthesis and Solid&#8208;State NMR Study of the Imidonitridosilicate Rb3Si6N5(NH)6</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 36, June 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The imidonitridosilicate Rb3Si6N5(NH)6 was synthesized using the ammonothermal synthesis. Analysis of the compound is performed using X&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier&#8208;Transform infrared (FTIR) and magic&#8208;angle spinning (MAS) NMR spectroscopy. The characterization of the imidonitridosilicate Rb3Si6N5(NH)6, only the second representative of this compound class, as possible intermediate during the ammonothermal synthesis of nitridosilicates helps to improve the understanding for the ammonothermal synthesis of nitrides.







Abstract
The imidonitridosilicate Rb3Si6N5(NH)6, being only the second representative of this compound class, was synthesized ammonothermally at 870&#8197;K and 230&#8197;MPa. Its crystal structure was solved from single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction data. The imidonitridosilicate crystallizes isotypically with the respective potassium compound in space group P4132 with the lattice parameter a=10.9422(4)&#8197;&#197; forming a three&#8208;dimensional imidonitridosilicate tetrahedra network with voids for the rubidium ions. The structure model and the presence of the imide groups were verified by Fourier&#8208;Transform infrared (FTIR) and magic&#8208;angle spinning (MAS) NMR spectroscopy, using cross polarization 15N{1H} and 29Si{1H} MAS NMR experiments. Rb3Si6N5(NH)6 represents a possible intermediate during the ammonothermal synthesis of nitridosilicates. The characterization of such intermediates improves the understanding of the reaction pathway from ammonothermal solutions to nitrides. Thus, the ammonothermal synthesis is an alternative approach to the well&#8208;established high&#8208;temperature synthesis leading to the compound class of nitridosilicates.

         <title>Peri&#8208;Alkylated Terrylenes and Ternaphthalenes Building&#8208;Blocks Towards Multi&#8208;Edge Nanographenes
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 36, June 25, 2024. </description>

A facile synthetic route has been developed to produce highly soluble peri&#8208;alkylated terrylene and its derivatives with enhanced &#960;&#8208;conjugation at bay&#8208;regions. The synthesized terrylene derivatives exhibit remarkably high fluorescence quantum yields and molar extinction coefficients, making them ideal candidates for applications in single&#8208;molecule spectroscopy, photonics, and quantum emission.







Abstract
Since its first synthesis by Clar in 1948, terrylene &#8211; a fully connected ternaphthalene oligomer via naphthalene's peri&#8208;positions &#8211; has gained special focus within the rylene family, drawing interest for its unique chemical, structural, optoelectronic and single photon emission properties. In this study, we introduce a novel synthetic pathway that enhances the solubility of terrylene derivatives through complete peri&#8208;alkylation, while also facilitating extensions at the bay&#8208;positions. This approach not only broadens the scope of terrylene's chemical versatility but also opens new avenues for developing solution processable novel multi&#8208;edge nanographenes and tailoring electronic energy levels through topological edge structures. Our findings include a comprehensive structural and spectroscopic characterization along with transient absorption spectroscopy and photophysics of both the synthesized peri&#8208;alkylated terrylene and its phenylene&#8208;fused derivative.

The self&#8208;assembly process of the 4&#8208;aminoquinoline (4&#8208;AQ)&#8208;based amphiphile in neutral buffer can be temperature controlled. The lower critical solution temperature (LCST) is important, and the selective construction of perforated vesicles or nanofibers is achieved by heating the same 4&#8208;AQ amphiphile to 80&#8201;&#176;C (&gt;LCST) or 60&#8201;&#176;C (&lt;LCST) and then cooling it to room temperature. More information can be found in the Research Article by Y. Hisamatsu, N. Umezawa and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202400134).

         <title>Sustainable Electrolytes: Design Principles and Recent Advances</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 36, June 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Extensive research has focused on optimizing the solvation structure, including salt, solvent, additive, or concentration, little attention has been paid to developing low&#8208;toxic and safe electrolytes. It concludes with a summary and outlook on future research directions for the molecular design of high&#8208;performance, safe, environmentally friendly and sustainable electrolytes.







Abstract
Today, rechargeable batteries are omnipresent and essential for our existence. In order to improve the electrochemical performance of electric fields, the introduction of electrolytes with fluorine (F)&#8208;based inorganic elemental compositions is a direction of exploration. However, most fluorocarbons have a high global warming potential and ozone depletion potential, which do not meet the sustainability requirements of the battery industry. Therefore, developing sustainable electrolytes is a viable option for future battery development. Although researchers have made much progress in electrolyte optimization, little attention has been paid to developing low&#8208;toxic and safe electrolytes. This review aims to elucidate the design principles and recent advances in this direction for solvents and salts. It concludes with a summary and outlook on future research directions for the molecular design of green electrolytes for practical high&#8208;voltage rechargeable batteries.

         <title>Biomimetic Capsid&#8208;like Nanoshells Self&#8208;assembled from Homopolypeptides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The preparation of capsid&#8208;like nanoshells and the elucidation of their formation pathways are crucial for the application potential of capsid&#8208;like nanomaterials. In this study, we have prepared biomimetic capsid&#8208;like nanoshells (CLNs) through the solution self&#8208;assembly of poly (&#946;&#8208;phenethyl&#8208;L&#8208;aspartate) homopolypeptide (PPLA). The formation of CLNs is governed by an aggregation&#8208;fusion mechanism. Initially, PPLA molecules self&#8208;assemble into small spherical assemblies as subunits and the initial nuclei are formed through fusing some subunits. Subsequently, additional subunits rapidly fuse onto these nuclei, leading to the growth of full or partial CLNs during the growth phase. Moreover, the suitable condition benefiting CLNs formation is clarified by a morphological phase diagram based on the initial PPLA concentration against water content. Molecular&#8208;level measurements suggest that the molecular flexibility of PPLA is a key factor in the arrangement and fusion of subunits for the formation of CLNs. These findings offer new perspectives for a deeper understanding of the formation pathways of capsid&#8208;like nanoshells derived from synthetic polymers.</dc:description>

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Driven Germyl Radical Generation via EDA&#8208;Catalyzed ET&#8211;HAT Process</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Facile generation of germyl radical was achieved by using photo&#8208;excited electron transfer (ET) in an electron donor&#8208;acceptor (EDA) complex to drive hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) from germyl hydride (R3GeH). Using catalytic amounts of commercially available thiol and benzophenone derivatives, the ET&#8208;HAT cycle smoothly proceeds upon blue&#8208;light irradiation without any photocatalyst.







Abstract
We have established a facile and efficient protocol for the generation of germyl radicals by employing photo&#8208;excited electron transfer (ET) in an electron donor&#8208;acceptor (EDA) complex to drive hydrogen&#8208;atom transfer (HAT) from germyl hydride (R3GeH). Using a catalytic amount of EDA complex of commercially available thiol and benzophenone derivatives, the ET&#8208;HAT cycle smoothly proceeds simply upon blue&#8208;light irradiation without any transition metal or photocatalyst. This protocol also affords silyl radical from silyl hydride.

         <title>Mixed Tin Valence in the Tin(II/IV)&#8208;Nitridophosphate Sn3P8N16</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The novel tin nitridophosphate Sn3P8N16 was prepared in a high&#8208;pressure high&#8208;temperature reaction from Sn3N4 and P3N5. It incorporates tin in mixed oxidation states +II and +IV in a 3D&#8208;network of PN4 tetrahedra. The material was characterized by X&#8208;ray diffraction methods, energy&#8208;dispersive X&#8208;ray spectroscopy, solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy, M&#246;ssbauer spectroscopy and theoretical calculations.







Abstract
Sn3P8N16 combines the structural versatility of nitridophosphates and Sn within one compound. It was synthesized as dark gray powder in a high&#8208;pressure high&#8208;temperature reaction at 800&#8201;&#176;C and 6&#8197;GPa from Sn3N4 and P3N5. The crystal structure was elucidated from single&#8208;crystal diffraction data (space group C2/m (no. 12), a=12.9664(4), b=10.7886(4), c=4.8238(2) &#197;, &#946;=109.624(1)&#176;) and shows a 3D&#8208;network of PN4 tetrahedra, incorporating Sn in oxidation states +II and +IV. The Sn cations are located within eight&#8208;membered rings of vertex&#8208;sharing PN4 tetrahedra, stacked along the [001] direction. A combination of solid&#8208;state nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, 119Sn M&#246;ssbauer spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations was used to confirm the mixed oxidation of Sn. Temperature&#8208;dependent powder X&#8208;ray diffraction measurements reveal a low thermal expansion of 3.6&#8197;ppm/K up to 750&#8201;&#176;C, beyond which Sn3P8N16 starts to decompose.

         <title>Protecting&#8208;Group&#8208;Free Synthesis of ADP&#8208;Ribose and Dinucleoside Di&#8208;/Triphosphate Derivatives via P(V)&#8208;P(V) Coupling Reaction</title>

         <dc:description>
An efficient and reproducible method for protecting&#8208;group&#8208;free P(V)&#8208;P(V) coupling reaction is reported. By developing a hydrolysis&#8208;stable ImIm&#8208;Cl analog for phosphate activation, this P(V)&#8208;P(V) coupling reaction can be used to successfully synthesize biological important ADP&#8208; and ATP&#8208;containing molecules. This method allows for pyrophosphate formation on peptides for the first time to synthesize ADP&#8208;ribosyl peptides.







Abstract
Biomolecules containing adenosine di&#8208; or triphosphate (ADP or ATP) are crucial for diverse biological processes. Synthesis of these biomolecules and development of their chemical probes are important to elucidate their functions. Enabling reproducible and high&#8208;yielding access to these ADP&#8208; and ATP&#8208;containing molecules via conventional P(III)&#8208;P(V) and P(V)&#8208;P(V) coupling reactions is challenging owing to water content in highly polar phosphate&#8208;containing substrates. Herein, we report an efficient and reliable method for protecting&#8208;group&#8208;free P(V)&#8208;P(V) coupling reaction through in&#8197;situ activation of phosphates using hydrolysis&#8208;stable 2&#8208;[N&#8208;(2&#8208;methylimidazoyl)]&#8208;1,3&#8208;dimethylimidazolinium chloride (2&#8208;MeImIm&#8208;Cl), providing the corresponding electrophilic P(V) intermediates for subsequent nucleophilic attack using their coupling partners. This P(V)&#8208;P(V) coupling reaction proceeded even in a wet reaction medium and showed a broad substrate scope, accommodating protecting&#8208;group&#8208;free synthesis of ADP&#8208;ribose and nicotinamide adenine diphosphate analogs, ATP&#8208;containing biomolecules, and ADP&#8208;ribosyl peptides.

         <title>Dual Role of a Novel Heteroleptic Cu(I) Complex in Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Driven CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel Cu(I) complex based on a benzoquinoxalinone derivative was used in visible&#8208;light driven CO2 reduction. The ability to accumulate charges on the non&#8208;innocent ligand not only enables its role as an excellent photosensitizer, in combination with a an Fe(III) porphyrin, but brings this complex to the next level, as it acts as photocatalyst, achieving selectively the reduction of CO2 to CO.







Abstract
A novel mononuclear Cu(I) complex was synthesized via coordination with a benzoquinoxalin&#8208;2&#8217;&#8208;one&#8208;1,2,3&#8208;triazole chelating diimine and the bis[(2&#8208;diphenylphosphino)phenyl] ether (DPEPhos), to target a new and efficient photosensitizer for photocatalytic CO2 reduction. The Cu(I) complex absorbs in the blue&#8208;green region of the visible spectrum, with a broad band having a maximum at 475&#8197;nm (&#1013; =4500&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;1), which is assigned to the metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge transfer (MLCT) transition from the Cu(I) to the benzoquinoxalin&#8208;2&#8217;&#8208;one moiety of the diimine. Surprisingly, photo&#8208;driven experiments for the CO2 reduction showed that this complex can undergo a photoinduced electron transfer with a sacrificial electron donor and accumulate electrons on the diimine backbone. Photo&#8208;driven experiments in a CO2 atmosphere revealed that this complex can not only act as a photosensitizer, when combined with an Fe(III)&#8208;porphyrin, but can also selectively produce CO from CO2. Thus, owing to its charge&#8208;accumulation properties, the non&#8208;innocent benzoquinoxalin&#8208;2&#8208;one based ligand enabled the development of the first copper(I)&#8208;based photocatalyst for CO2 reduction.

         <title>Enhanced Near&#8208;infrared Phosphorescent Emission Modulated by Clipping of Metallotweezers in Aqueous Media</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The phosphorent nanoparticles with enhanced near&#8208;infrared emission were obtaiend by non&#8208;covalent clipping strategy. This approach offers a convenient and effecient pathway toward luminescent materials with specialized functions.







Abstract
Near&#8208;infrared phosphorescent materials have received significant attention due to their potential applications in bioimaging and diagnostics. Although, many types of organic phosphors with near&#8208;infrared emission have been developed, the low phosphorescence efficiency in aqueous solution hampers their practical applications in biological systems. Hence, there is an urgent need to develop near&#8208;infrared phosphorescent materials with high emission efficiency in aqueous media. Metallotweezers, based on d8 transition metal complexes, emerge as the potential candidates for realizing this objective. Specifically, metallotweezers, featuring two positively charged platinum(II) terpyridine and neutral gold(III) diphenylpyridine pincers on diphenylpyridine spacer, have been designed and synthesized, respectively. The pre&#8208;organization effect, rendered by the rigid spacer, enables the resulting metallotweezers to complex with each other, resulting in the formation of clipping complex. The synergistic rigidifying and shielding effects of clipping structure results in enhanced phosphorescent emission intensity. Concurrently, due to phase segregation between the clipping units and the polyethylene glycol tail, the clipping complex undergoes self&#8208;assembly in aqueous solution, resulting in phosphorescent emission in the near&#8208;infrared region. Overall, non&#8208;covalent clipping of metallotweezers illustrated in this study presents a new and effective approach toward near&#8208;infrared phosphorescent materials.

Based on the non&#8208;covalent self&#8208;assembly of water&#8208;soluble pillar[5]arenes, using WP5&#11815;G as the energy donor and commercially available dyes DBT (acceptor I) and SR101 (acceptor II) as the energy acceptor, a supramolecular light&#8208;harvesting system with sequential energy transfer was successfully constructed. Significantly, this system shows attractive applications in white light&#8208;emitting diode (LED) devices and latent fingerprint (LFP) imaging.

         <title>Electronic Control of Polyproline II Helix Stability via the Identity of Acyl Capping Groups: the Pivaloyl Group Particularly Promotes PPII</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The polyproline II helix (PPII) is stabilized by n&#8594;&#960;* interactions. The ability to tune PPII structure in water via changes in the electronic properties of the acyl capping group is demonstrated herein. More electron&#8208;rich acyl capping groups promote PPII, both at proline and non&#8208;proline residues, via stronger n&#8594;&#960;* interactions. In contrast, more electron&#8208;poor groups exhibit lower PPII.







Abstract
The type II polyproline helix (PPII) is a fundamental secondary structure of proteins, important in globular proteins, in intrinsically disordered proteins, and at protein&#8208;protein interfaces. PPII is stabilized in part by n&#8594;&#960;* interactions between consecutive carbonyls, via electron delocalization between an electron&#8208;donor carbonyl lone pair (n) and an electron&#8208;acceptor carbonyl (&#960;*) on the subsequent residue. We previously demonstrated that changes to the electronic properties of the acyl donor can predictably modulate the strength of n&#8594;&#960;* interactions, with data from model compounds, in solution in chloroform, in the solid state, and computationally. Herein, we examined whether the electronic properties of acyl capping groups could modulate the stability of PPII in peptides in water. In X&#8722;PPGY&#8208;NH2 peptides (X=10 acyl capping groups), the effect of acyl group identity on PPII was quantified by circular dichroism and NMR spectroscopy. Electron&#8208;rich acyl groups promoted PPII relative to the standard acetyl (Ac&#8722;) group, with the pivaloyl and iso&#8208;butyryl groups most significantly increasing PPII. In contrast, acyl derivatives with electron&#8208;withdrawing substituents and the formyl group relatively disfavored PPII. Similar results, though lesser in magnitude, were also observed in X&#8722;APPGY&#8208;NH2 peptides, indicating that the capping group can impact PPII conformation at both proline and non&#8208;proline residues. The pivaloyl group was particularly favorable in promoting PPII. The effects of acyl capping groups were further analyzed in X&#8211;DfpPGY&#8208;NH2 and X&#8722;ADfpPGY&#8208;NH2 peptides, Dfp=4,4&#8208;difluoroproline. Data on these peptides indicated that acyl groups induced order Piv&#8208; &gt; Ac&#8208; &gt; For&#8208;. These results suggest that greater consideration should be given to the identity of acyl capping groups in inducing structure in peptides.

         <title>Covalently Linked 5,6,11,12&#8208;Tetraazanaphthacene Dimer and Its Triptycene&#8208;Capped Derivatives as Electron Acceptors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Triptycene end&#8208;capped bi&#8208;tetraazaacene (bi&#8208;TpTANC) was synthesised with good solubility, rigidity, and crystallinity, and was characterised using X&#8208;ray crystallography. Bi&#8208;TpTANC is a multi&#8208;electron acceptor with a 3&#8208;step/4&#8208;electron transfer mechanism, and its electrochemistry suggests through&#8208;bond charge delocalisation in its monoanionic state. With a LUMO level of &#8722;4.1&#8197;eV, bi&#8208;TpTANC is expected to be an air stable electron acceptor or an n&#8208;type semiconductor.







Abstract
The development of electron transport and n&#8208;type materials is still largely dominated by a limited number of organic semiconductors, with fullerenes at the forefront. In contrast, substantial progress has been made in developing hole transport and p&#8208;type materials. Therefore, expanding the range of electron acceptors, making them solution&#8208;processable, and elucidating their structural arrangement by X&#8208;ray crystallography is essential. We synthesised 2,2&#8217;&#8208;bi&#8208;(5,6,11,12&#8208;tetraazanaphthacene) (bi&#8208;TANC) and its triptycene end&#8208;capped derivative, 2,2&#8242;&#8208;bi(8,13&#8208;dihydro&#8208;8,13&#8208;[1,2]benzenonaphtho&#8208;5,6,15,16&#8208;tetraazanaphthacene) (bi&#8208;TpTANC), as electron acceptors. Bi&#8208;TANC exhibits a herringbone&#8208;like crystal packing with intermolecular &#960;&#8211;&#960; overlap, which is observed in typical organic n&#8208;type semiconductors. However, it showed poor solubility, similar to larger acenes. In contrast, bi&#8208;TpTANC exhibited favourable solubility, and its electrochemistry in solution was investigated. In the cyclic voltammogram of bi&#8208;TpTANC, reversible redox waves corresponding to 3&#8208;step/4&#8208;electron transfer were observed at &#8722;0.795&#8197;V (1e&#8722;), &#8722;0.927&#8197;V (1e&#8722;), and &#8722;1.44&#8197;V (2e&#8722;) as half&#8208;wave potentials. The redox wave associated with the two&#8208;electron transfer on the negative low&#8208;potential side indicates the presence of through&#8208;bond charge delocalisation in the monoanionic state. Furthermore, the LUMO level of bi&#8208;TpTANC is &#8722;4.1&#8197;eV, which indicates its potential as a promising air&#8208;stable n&#8208;type material.

         <title>Dissolution of g&#8208;C3N4 Using Zinc Chloride Molten Salt Hydrates for Nanobelt Fabrication and Photocatalytic H2O2 Production</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Graphitic&#8208;carbon nitride (g&#8208;C3N4), a metal&#8208;free two&#8208;dimensional layered semiconductor material, holds great potential for energy conversion, environmental remediation, and sensing. However, the limited solubility of g&#8208;C3N4 in conventional solvents hinders its widespread application. Improving the dissolution of g&#8208;C3N4 in the liquid phase is highly desired but challenging. Herein, we report an innovative approach to dissolve g&#8208;C3N4 using ZnCl2 molten salt hydrates. The solubility of g&#8208;C3N4 in the solution reaches up to 200 mg mL&#8208;1. Density functional theory (DFT) results suggest that ZnCl+H2O is the key species that leads to charge redistribution on g&#8208;C3N4 surface and promotes the dissolution of carbon nitride in the solution. Furthermore, through dilution, the dissolved carbon nitride can be effectively recovered while maintaining its intrinsic chemical structure. The resultant regenerated C3N4 (r&#8208;C3N4) exhibits&#160; nanobelt morphology and demonstrates a substantially improved photocatalytic activity in H2O2 production. The rate of H2O2 production over the r&#8208; C3N4 reaches 20,228 &#181;mol g&#8208;1 h&#8208;1, which is 6.2 times higher than that of pristine g&#8208;C3N4. This green and efficient dissolution route of g&#8208;C3N4 offers an effective approach for its diverse applications.</dc:description>

The Pd&#8208;catalysed decarboxylative asymmetric allylic alkylation (DAAA) has been applied to the enantioselective synthesis of sterically hindered benzofuran&#8208;3(2H)&#8208;one&#8208;derived &#945;&#8208;aryl&#8208;&#946;&#8208;keto esters employing the (R,R)&#8208;ANDEN phenyl Trost ligand.

         <title>Chiral Acetal&#8208;Based Stereo&#8208;Controlled Degradable Polymer Synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The precise synthesis of chiral polymers remains a significant challenge in polymer chemistry, particularly for applications in advanced biomedical and electronic materials. The development of degradable polymers is important for eco&#8208;friendly and advanced materials. Here, we introduce a stereo&#8208;controlled degradable polymer via cascade enyne metathesis polymerization and enantioselective acetal synthesis through Pd&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric hydroamination.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The precise synthesis of chiral polymers remains a significant challenge in polymer chemistry, particularly for applications in advanced biomedical and electronic materials. The development of degradable polymers is important for eco-friendly and advanced materials. Here, we introduce a stereo-controlled degradable polymer via cascade enyne metathesis polymerization and enantioselective acetal synthesis through Pd-catalyzed asymmetric hydroamination. This approach allows for the creation of chiral acetal-based polymers with controlled stereochemistry and degradability, highlighting their potential for use in drug delivery and electronic applications. This concept article reviews the background, development, and potential applications of these stereo-controlled degradable polymers.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Phosphorus&#8208;centred, Zirconocene&#8208;bridged Tetraradical: Synthesis, Structure and Application as Molecular Double Switch</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Biradicals are important intermediates in the formation and breaking of a chemical bond. Their use as molecular switches is of particular interest. Much less is known about tetraradicals, which can, for example, consist of two biradical(oid) units. Here we report the synthesis of the first persistent phosphorus&#8208;centred tetraradical bound to a transition metal fragment. Starting from a zirconocene complex, rac&#8208;(ebthi)ZrCl2 (rac&#8208;(ebthi) = 1,2&#8208;ethylene&#8208;1,10&#8208;bis(h5&#8208;tetrahydroin&#173;denyl), two cyclo&#8208;1,3&#8208;diphospha&#8208;pentane&#8208;1,3&#8208;diyls were successfully introduced, which finally led to the isolation of a deep green zircon&#173;cene&#8208;bridged bis(biradicaloid) complex (5) that can act as a double molecular switch. Under the influence of light (570&#160;nm), this tetra&#173;radical forms a transannular bond in each of the two five&#8208;membered biradical units, leading to the formation of housane 5h. Upon irradiation at 415&#160;nm, the reverse reaction is observed, fully reco&#173;vering tetraradical 5. Through single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal trans&#173;formation, both stable species of the molecular switch could be structurally characterised using SCXRD. The switching under the influence of light and the activation of molecular hydrogen were analysed in solution using NMR and UV spectroscopy. It was found that the addition of one or two equivalents of molecular hydrogen can be switched on and off by light.</dc:description>

         <title>The Excited&#8208;State N&#8208;H Tautomerization Rate in Free&#8208;Base Corroles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Corrole is a tetrapyrrolic dye with a structure that resembles porphyrin, apart from a single missing carbon. The absence of this carbon results in the re&#8208;arrangement of the double bonds within the macrocycle, and the presence of three pyrrolic protons in the central cavity in its free base form. These protons lead to the existence of two distinct tautomeric structures that exist in a dynamic equilibrium. Although the ground state energies of the tautomers are similar, the excited states show a significant difference in energy which unbalances the equilibrium between the tautomers and results in rapid excited state tautomerization, favouring one tautomeric species over the other. Although the excited state tautomerization process has been known for a long time, very few studies have been performed on it leaving many key aspects of the process poorly understood. Herein we show how ultrafast photoluminescence can be used to experimentally determine the rates of excited state tautomerization and activation energies of three free base corrole derivatives thus allowing us to completely describe the excited state dynamics of the unusual, excited state of free base corrole and opening the door to the development of new materials that can exploit it unique characteristics..</dc:description>

         <title>Facile Synthesis and Characterization of Uniform Au Nanospheres Capped by Citrate for Biomedical Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report a simple and versatile method for effectively replacing the toxic ligands, such as&#160;cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) and&#160;cetyltrimethylammonium chloride (CTAC), on the surface of Au nanospheres with different sizes by citrate. The method involves the deposition of an ultrathin shell of fresh Au in the presence of sodium citrate at an adequate concentration.&#160;After the ligand exchange process, multiple techniques are used to confirm that the surface of the resultant Au nanospheres is covered by citrate while there is no sign of aggregation. We also demonstrate the mitigation of cell toxicity after exchanging the surface&#8208;bound CTAB/CTAC with citrate, opening the door to a range of biomedical applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Proton Conducting Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks (MOFs) via Post Synthetic Transmetallation and Water Induced Structural Transformations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Post Synthetic Modification (PSM) of Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks (MOFs) is a crucial strategy for developing new MOFs with enhanced functional properties compared to their parent one. PSM can be accomplished through various methods:1) modification of organic linkers; 2) exchange of metal ions or nodes; and 3) inclusion or exchange of solvent/guest molecules. Herein, PSM of bimetallic and monometallic MOFs containing biphenyl dinitro&#8208;tetra&#8208;carboxylates (NCA) are demonstrated. The tetra carboxylate NCA, produces monometallic Cd&#8208;MOF&#8208;1 and Cu&#8208;MOF&#8208;1 and bimetallic CoZn&#8208;MOF in solvothermal reactions with the corresponding metal salts. The CoZn&#8208;MOF undergoes post&#8208;synthetic transmetallation with Cd(NO3)2 and Cu(NO3)2 in aqueous solution to yield Cd&#8208;MOF&#8208;2 and Cu&#8208;MOF&#8208;2, respectively. Additionally, green crystals of Cu&#8208;MOF&#8208;1 found to undergo a single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal (SCSC) transformation to blue crystals of Cu&#8208;MOF&#8208;3 upon dipped into water at room temperature. These MOFs demonstrate notable proton conductivities ranging from 10&#8208;3 to 10&#8208;4 S cm&#8208;1 under variable temperatures and humidity levels. Among them, Cu&#8208;MOF&#8208;3 achieves the highest proton conductivity of 1.36 &#215; 10&#8208;3 S cm&#8208;1 at 90 &#176;C and 98% relative humidity, attributed to its continuous and extensive hydrogen bonding network, which provides effective proton conduction pathways within the MOF. This work highlights a convenient strategy for designing proton&#8208;conducting MOFs via post&#8208;synthetic modification.</dc:description>

         <title>Revisiting the mechanism of asymmetric Ni&#8208;catalyzed reductive carbo&#8208;carboxylation with CO2: The additives affect the product selectivity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The mechanistic details of the asymmetric Ni&#8208;catalyzed reductive cyclization/carboxylation of alkenes with CO2 have been revisited using DFT methods. Emphasis was put on the enantioselectivity and the mechanistic role of Lewis acid additives and in situ formed salts. Our results show that oxidative addition of the substrate is rate&#8208;limiting, with the formed Ni(II)&#8208;aryl intermediate preferring a triplet spin state. After reduction to Ni(I), enantioselective cyclization of the substrate occurs, followed by inner sphere carboxylation. Our proposed mechanism reproduces the experimentally observed enantiomeric excess and identifies critical C&#8208;H/O and C&#8208;H/N interactions that affect the selectivity. Further, our results highlight the beneficial effect of Lewis acids on CO2 insertion and suggest that in situ formed salts influence if the 5&#8208;exo or 6&#8208;endo product will be formed.</dc:description>

         <title>Aerobic Oxidation of PMB Ethers to Carboxylic Acids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The first aerobic protocol of direct transformation of p&#8208;methoxybenzyl (PMB) ethers to carboxylic acids efficiently with Fe(NO3)3&#8226;9H2O and TEMPO as catalysts at room temperature has been developed. The reaction accommodates C&#8208;Br bond, terminal/non&#8208;terminal C&#8208;C triple bond, amide, cyano, nitro, ester, and trifluoromethyl groups, etc. Even highly selective oxidative deprotection of different benzylic PMB ethers has been realized. The reaction has been successfully applied to the total synthesis of natural product, (R)&#8208;6&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;7,9&#8208;octadecadiynoic acid, demonstrating the practicality of the method. Based on experimental studies, a possible mechanism involving oxygen&#8208;stabilized benzylic cation has been proposed.</dc:description>

         <title>Low&#8208;lying LUMO Boosts Conductance in Antiaromatic Dibenzopentalene Versus Aromatic Analogues</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dibenzopentalene paired with pyridyl anchor groups is shown to conduct better than aromatic analogues containing phenyl or anthracene inside single&#8208;molecule junctions. Compared to thioanisole anchors, pyridyls provide better molecular orbital level&#8208;Fermi level alignment. The result is a significant conductance&#8208;voltage response especially for a sub&#8208;2&#8197;nm long molecule. The conductance increases nearly ten&#8208;fold over a 1.5&#8197;V range.







Abstract
Antiaromaticity is a fundamental concept in chemistry, but the study of molecular wires incorporating antiaromatic units is limited. Despite initial predictions, very few studies show that antiaromaticity has a beneficial effect on electron transport. Dibenzo[a,e]pentalene (DBP) is a stable structure that displays appreciable antiaromaticity within the five&#8208;membered rings of the pentalene core. We have investigated derivatives of DBP furnished with pyridyl (Py) and F4&#8208;pyridyl (PyF4) anchor groups, and compared the conductance with purely aromatic phenyl and anthracene analogues. We find that the low&#8208;bias conductance of DBP&#8208;Py is approximately 60&#8201;% larger than that of the anthracene analogue Anth&#8208;Py and 250&#8201;% larger compared to the phenyl derivative Ph&#8208;Py. This is due to a better alignment of the LUMO with the gold Fermi level, which we confirm by conductance&#8208;voltage spectroscopy where the conductance of DBP&#8208;Py shows the greatest voltage&#8208;dependence. The F4&#8208;pyridyl compounds, which have lower LUMO energies compared to the pyridyl analogues, did not, however, form detectable molecular junctions. The strongly electron&#8208;withdrawing fluorine atoms reduce the donor capability of the nitrogen lone&#8208;pair to the point where stable N&#8722;Au bonds no longer form.

         <title>UoC&#8208;7: A Bimetallic K&#8208;Zn&#8208;MOF with an Anionic Framework Based on Fluorinated Trimesate Ligands Exhibiting a Large CO2 Uptake</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The MOFs UoC&#8208;7(1F) and UoC&#8208;7(2F) (UoC: University of Cologne) with an anionic framework based on potassium and zinc cations and fluorinated trimesate linkers show an almost unprecedented high CO2 uptake at 1&#8197;bar, which increases significantly with an increasing number of fluorine substituents.







Abstract
In solvothermal reactions of Zn(NO3)2&#215;6H2O with K(H2mF&#8208;BTC) or K(H2dF&#8208;BTC) in DMF/ethanol or DMA/ethanol solvent mixtures, single crystals of the MOFs UoC&#8208;7(1F) and UoC&#8208;7(2F) were obtained crystallizing in the hexagonal space group P63/m (no.&#160;176) (H3BTC: 1,3,5&#8208;benzenetricarboxylic acid; mF&#8208;/dF: mono&#8208;/difluoro; DMF: N,N&#8208;dimethylformamide; DMA: N,N&#8208;dimethylacetamide; UoC: University of Cologne). According to the general composition [(CH3)2NH2][K2Zn3(mF&#8208;/dF&#8208;BTC)3(H2O)]&#215;solvent, UoC&#8208;7 consists of an anionic bimetallic framework. The charge is compensated by a (CH3)2NH2+ cation stemming from the (partial) hydrolysis of the solvent. The crystal structure shows large channels along the hexagonal [001] direction, which accommodate the cations as well as solvent molecules. Surface areas (SBET) of 2740&#8197;m2/g (UoC&#8208;7(1F)) and 1643&#8197;m2/g (UoC&#8208;7(2F)) were obtained from N2 sorption measurements. UoC&#8208;7 shows structural similarities to the MOF NKU&#8208;521 with a 5&#8208;(1H&#8208;tetrazol&#8208;5&#8208;yl)isophthalate linker. Both MOFs exhibit a 4,7,8T14 topology. Despite smaller channels in UoC&#8208;7 compared to NKU&#8208;521, the CO2 uptake is considerably higher (~164&#8197;cm3/g at 1&#8197;bar/293&#8197;K) being one of the highest CO2 uptakes observed up to now.

         <title>Photo&#8208;triggered Phase Transition of Crystals and Photoactuation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enol&#8208;(S)&#8208;1 crystals exhibit the photo&#8208;triggered &#945;&#8594;&#946; phase transition under UV irradiation and also show various motions, such as stepwise bending and locomotion. The requirements for the photo&#8208;triggered phase transition were clarified to be: a sufficient change in the molecular conformation, a smooth photoisomerization, and a chiral molecular arrangement.







Abstract
Photo&#8208;triggered phase transition is a new type of phase transition in which a photochromic crystal with a thermal phase transition transforms into an identical high&#8208;temperature phase in a temperature region lower than the thermal phase transition temperature upon light irradiation. Here, we report a second crystal that exhibits a photo&#8208;triggered phase transition, thereby demonstrating that the photo&#8208;triggered phase transition is a general phenomenon that occurs in crystals. When the chiral salicylidenephenylethylamine crystal was irradiated with ultraviolet (UV) light, the photo&#8208;triggered phase transition occurred in the temperature range &#8722;30 to &#8722;10&#8201;&#176;C. The photo&#8208;triggered phase transition is induced by local stress due to trans&#8208;keto molecules produced by photoisomerization near the irradiated surface. Crystal cantilevers exhibited stepwise bending by the combination of the photo&#8208;triggered phase transition and photoisomerization. Alternate irradiation with UV and visible light achieved locomotion of single crystals driven by repeated stepwise bending. Finally, a detailed comparison of photo&#8208;triggered and non&#8208;photo&#8208;triggered phase transition crystals revealed that a sufficient molecular conformation change in affordable crystal voids, smooth photoisomerization, and most likely a chiral molecular arrangement are required for inducing the photo&#8208;triggered phase transition.

         <title>Ligand Basicity and Chelate Effects on Sulfur Insertion vs. Sulfur Reduction by Zinc Thiolate Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of zinc thiolate complexes was synthesized and their reactivity with elemental sulfur was studied. Dependent on ligand factors such as thiolate nucleophilicity, chelation, and overall complex charge, these complexes were observed to undergo sulfur insertion or thiolate oxidation via sulfur reduction.







Abstract
4&#8208; and 5&#8208;coordinate zinc thiolate complexes supported either by bis(carboxamide)pyridine frameworks or by substituted tris(pyrazolyl)borate ligands react with elemental sulfur (S8) following two distinct pathways. Some zinc thiolate moieties insert sulfur atoms to form zinc polysulfanide complexes, while others reduce sulfur and oxidize the thiolate. Here, we compare the effects of ligand electronics, strain, and sterics for selecting the respective reaction pathway. These results show that chelating and electron&#8208;deficient thiolate ligands better stabilize persistent zinc&#8208;bound polysulfanide species.

         <title>Bioorthogonal Cycloadditions of C3&#8208;Trifluoromethylated 1,2,4&#8208;Triazines with trans&#8208;Cyclooctenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We prepared 3&#8208;trifluoromethyl&#8208;substituted 1,2,4&#8208;triazines, readily available from NH&#8208;1,2,3&#8208;triazoles, and studied their reactivity in cycloaddition reactions with trans&#8208;cyclooctenes. We demonstrate that these heterodienes are both reactive and stable, display fluorogenic properties, and enable the efficient labelling of unprotected peptides under biologically relevant conditions.







Abstract
1,2,4&#8208;triazines are a valuable class of heterodienes that can be employed in inverse electron&#8208;demand Diels&#8211;Alder reactions. However, their broader application in bioorthogonal chemistry is limited due to their low reactivity. This article focuses on 3&#8208;(trifluoromethyl)&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;triazines, which can be efficiently prepared in a one&#8208;pot reaction from NH&#8208;1,2,3&#8208;triazoles. These triazines are highly reactive in reactions with strained cyclooctenes, giving second&#8208;order rate constants as high as 230&#8197;M&#8722;1 s&#8722;1. Despite their high reactivity, the compounds remain sufficiently stable under biologically relevant conditions. We show that some of the compounds are fluorogenic, a property of potential use in bioimaging. In addition, we demonstrate the successful application of the triazines in labeling model biomolecules. Our work shows that the reactivity of 1,2,4&#8208;triazines can be enhanced by the 3&#8208;CF3&#8208;substitution, which we consider an important step toward the wider use of this promising class of reagents.

         <title>Backbone Modification in a Protein Hydrophobic Core</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Targeted backbone alteration is a powerful strategy for the design of protein mimetic macromolecules. The present work demonstrates artificial chain connectivity can be accommodated in the hydrophobic core of a complex tertiary fold with minimal impact on folded structure or folded stability.







Abstract
Targeted protein backbone modification can recreate tertiary structures reminiscent of folds found in nature on artificial scaffolds with improved biostability. Incorporation of altered monomers in such entities is typically limited to sites distant from the hydrophobic core to avoid potential disruptions to folding. This is limiting, as it is advantageous in some applications to incorporate artificial connectivity at buried sites. Here, we report an examination of protein backbone modification targeted specifically to hydrophobic core positions and its impacts on tertiary folded structure and fold stability. Different artificial monomer types are placed at core, core&#8208;flanking, or solvent&#8208;exposed positions in a compact three&#8208;helix protein. Effects on structure and folding energetics are assessed by NMR spectroscopy and biophysical methods. Results show that artificial residues can be well accommodated in the hydrophobic core of a defined tertiary fold, with effects on stability only modestly larger than identical changes at solvent&#8208;exposed sites. Collectively, these results provide new insights into folding behavior of protein&#8208;like artificial chains as well as strategies for the design of such molecules.

         <title>Unusual Stability of an End&#8208;on Superoxido Copper(II) Complex under Ambient Conditions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The unusual stability of an end&#8208;on superoxido copper complex, [CuII(Me6tren)(O2&#8901;&#8722;)]+ (Me6tren=tris(2&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;aminoethyl)amine), observed in an oxygen&#8208;enhanced atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP), was investigated. It was found that the corresponding peroxide complex and the complexes [CuI(Me6tren)(DMSO)]+ and [CuII(Me6tren)(OH)]+ participate in the overall reaction cycle.







Abstract
Superoxido copper complexes play an important role as usually short&#8208;lived intermediates in biology and chemistry. The unusual stability of an end&#8208;on superoxido copper complex observed in an oxygen&#8208;enhanced atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) led to a detailed mechanistic investigation of the formation of [CuII(Me6tren)(O2&#8901;&#8722;)]+ (Me6tren=tris(2&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;aminoethyl)amine) under ambient conditions. The persistence of the superoxido copper complex could be explained by a reaction cycle including the peroxido complex [(Me6tren)2CuII2(O2)]2+ together with [CuI(Me6tren)(DMSO)]+ and [CuII(Me6tren)(OH)]+ in the overall reaction.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Cover Feature shows that molybdenum sulfide (MoS2) nanoflowers have enabled high&#8208;energy, high&#8208;power, and scalable lithium&#8208;ion capacitor pouch cells for electric vehicle applications. The excellent performance was attributed to the fast surface redox reactions on the MoS2 electrode with tailored two&#8208;dimensional nanostructure and nanoflower morphology that overcome the sluggish kinetics in conventional lithium&#8208;ion capacitors. More information can be found in the Research Article by J. Liu and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202400907).

         <title>Hydrogen Tunneling Exhibiting Unexpectedly Small Primary Kinetic Isotope Effects</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A heavy pickup truck carries its load through a tunnel regardless of its molecular driver (H or D), thereby illustrating unexpectedly small primary H/D kinetic isotopic effects. These surprising results arise from the coupling of the tunneling H/D atoms with the N2 medium, thus highlighting a potential systematic oversight of quantum tunneling in many chemical reactions. More information can be found in the Research Article by C.&#8197;M. Nunes and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202401323).

More information can be found in the Research Article by C.&#8197;M. Nunes and co-workers (DOI: &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/chem.202401323"&gt;10.1002/chem.202401323&lt;/a&gt;).

         <title>Design of an Acidic pH&#8208;Activated NIR Fluorescent Convertible Rhodamine&#8722;Hemicyanine Probe&#8208;Peptide Conjugate for Living Cancer Cell Active Targeted Selective Tracking of Lysosomes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We have synthesized an acidic pH&#8208;activatable dual targeting ratiometric fluorescent probe&#8208;peptide conjugate using the SPPS protocol on&#160;resin. Living carcinoma cell specific active targeting, successive cell penetration, and selective staining of lysosomes are accomplished. Real&#8208;time monitoring of lysosomes, 3D, and multicolor cancer cell imaging are&#160;attained. The de novo design consists of the integration of multifunctionality into a single molecular scaffold, e.g., RGDS peptide&#160;to target cancer cell&#160;overexpressed receptor &#945;V&#946;3 integrin, live&#8208;cell penetrating&#160; rhodamine&#8722;hemicyanine chromophore comprising a lysosome targeting morpholine group, and an acidic pH openable spiro&#8208;lactam ring for a visible&#8208;to&#8208;NIR switchable ratiometric response. Water&#8208;soluble&#160;probe&#8208;peptide conjugate exhibits intramolecular spirolactamization at basic pH through Arg amide N. The visible spirolactam state predominantly exists at physiological and basic pH and can be switched to the highly conjugated NIR open amide state (&#955;em=735 nm) through spiro&#8208;lactam ring opening triggered by acidic pH with a huge bathochromic shift (&#916;&#955;abs=336 nm, &#916;&#955;FL=265 nm).&#160;pH&#8208;sensitive ratiometric&#160;switching is achieved. This in situ acidic cancer cell lysosome activatable multifunctional fluorophore&#8208;peptide conjugate shows augmented molar absorptivity, enhanced quantum yield, and improved fluorescence lifetime at acidic lysosomal pH; negligible cytotoxicity; and dual targeted ratiometric imaging capability of living cancer cell selective lysosomes with&#160;pKa value of 5.1.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Organic &#960;&#8208;scaffolds are being envisaged for new&#8208;age electron&#8208; and ion&#8208;responsive materials that can accumulate electrons as well as transport proton. However, such systems are extremely rare as electron&#8208;deficient scaffolds are unstable in aqueous solution. Here we detail the synthesis of a water&#8208;stable core&#8208;naphthalenediimide&#8208;nitrobenzyl&#8208;viologen based tetra&#8208;cation, which accumulates up to eight&#8208;electrons within an exceptionally narrow potential window of +0.05 V and &#8208;1.12 V. The supramolecular interactions and the ensuing ionic framework are tunable based on the three anions, e.g., Cl&#8208;, Br&#8208; and PF6&#8208;, that are investigated in this work. The ionic framework is formed and supported by a range of H&#8208;bonds, in which, the nitro benzyl groups act as pillars connecting the 1D water&#8208;tapes and the halide anions. The water molecules are hydrogen&#8208;bonded with the halide anions and bestow a facile pathway for the proton conduction, with proton conductivity up to 3.19 x 10&#8208;3 S cm&#8208;1. In contrast, the ionic assembly formed by the lipophilic PF6&#8208; anions do not host the water tapes and consequently the proton conductivity is found to be four orders of magnitude lower. This is a unique example, whereby proton conductivity is realized and is tunable within a highly electron&#8208;deficient, eight&#8208;electron acceptor, water&#8208;stable ionic supramolecular system.</dc:description>

Here we detail the synthesis of a water-stable core-naphthalenediimide-nitrobenzyl-viologen based tetra-cation, which accumulates up to eight-electrons within an exceptionally narrow potential window of +0.05 V and -1.12 V. The supramolecular interactions and the ensuing ionic framework are tunable based on the three anions, e.g., Cl-, Br- and PF6-, that are investigated in this work. The ionic framework is formed and supported by a range of H-bonds, in which, the nitro benzyl groups act as pillars connecting the 1D water-tapes and the halide anions. The water molecules are hydrogen-bonded with the halide anions and bestow a facile pathway for the proton conduction, with proton conductivity up to 3.19 x 10-3 S cm-1. In contrast, the ionic assembly formed by the lipophilic PF6- anions do not host the water tapes and consequently the proton conductivity is found to be four orders of magnitude lower. This is a unique example, whereby proton conductivity is realized and is tunable within a highly electron-deficient, eight-electron acceptor, water-stable ionic supramolecular system.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <dc:description>Leveraging electrochemistry, a new synthesis of non&#8208;natural derivatives of itaconic acid is proposed by utilizing carbon dioxide (CO2) as a valuable C1 synthon. An electrochemical cross&#8208;electrophile coupling between allenoates and CO2 was targeted, allowing for the synthesis of both mono&#8208; and di&#8208;carboxylation products in a catalyst&#8208; and additive&#8208;free environment (yields up to 87%, 30 examples). Elaboration of the model mono&#8208;carboxylation product, and detailed cyclovoltammetric, as well as mechanistic analyses complete the present investigation.</dc:description>

         <title>Protein&#8208;Protein Stabilization in VIVO/8&#8208;Hydroxyquinoline&#8211;Lysozyme adduct: A Spectroscopic, Crystallographic, and Computational Study</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The binding of the potential drug&#160;[VIVO(8&#8208;HQ)2], where 8&#8208;HQ is 8&#8208;hydroxyquinolinato, with hen egg white lysozyme (HEWL) was evaluated through spectroscopic (electron paramagnetic resonance, EPR, and UV&#8208;visible), spectrometric (electrospray ionization&#8208;mass spectrometry, ESI&#8208;MS), crystallographic (X&#8208;ray diffraction, XRD), and computational (DFT and docking) studies. ESI&#8208;MS indicates the interaction of [VIVO(8&#8208;HQ)(H2O)]+ and [VIVO(8&#8208;HQ)2(H2O)] species with HEWL. Room temperature EPR spectra suggest both covalent and non&#8208;covalent binding of the two different V&#8208;containing fragments. XRD analyses confirm these findings, showing that [VIVO(8&#8208;HQ)(H2O)]+ interacts covalently with the solvent exposed Asp119, while cis&#8208;[VIVO(8&#8208;HQ)2(H2O)] non&#8208;covalently with Arg128 and Lys96 from a symmetry mate. The covalent binding of [VIVO(8&#8208;HQ)(H2O)]+ to Asp119 is favored by a &#960;&#8211;&#960; contact with Trp62 and a H&#8208;bond with Asn103 of a symmetry&#8208;related molecule. Additionally, the covalent binding of VVO2+ to Asp48 and non&#8208;covalent binding of other V&#8208;containing fragments to Arg5, Cys6, and Glu7 is revealed. Molecular docking indicates that, in the absence of the interactions occurring at the protein&#8208;protein interface close to Asp119, the binding to Glu35 or Asp52 should be preferred. Such a protein&#8208;protein stabilization could be more common than what believed up today, at least in the solid state, and should be considered in the characterization of metal&#8211;protein adducts.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Sulfilimines via Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Mediated Triplet Energy Transfer to Sulfonyl Azides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sulfilimines and their derivatives have garnered considerable interest in both synthetic and medicinal chemistry. Photochemical nitrene transfer to sulfides is known as a conventional synthetic approach to sulfilimines. However, the existing methods have a limited substrate scope stemming from the incompatibility of singlet nitrene intermediates with nucleophilic functional groups. Herein, we report the synthesis of N&#8208;sulfonyl sulfilimines via visible&#8208;light&#8208;mediated energy transfer to sulfonyl azides, uncovering the previously overlooked reactivity of triplet nitrenes with sulfides through a postulated mechanism involving single electron transfer. This reaction features broad functional group tolerance, water compatibility, and amenability to the late&#8208;stage functionalization of drugs. Thus, this work represents an important example of energy transfer chemistry that overcomes challenges in traditional synthetic methods.</dc:description>

         <title>Red fluorescent aminoferrocene (pro)drugs for in cellulo and in vivo imaging</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Red fluorescent dyes are usually charged, lypophilic molecules with the relatively high molecular weight, which tend to localize in specific intracellular locations, e.g., a cyanine dye Cy5 is biased towards mitochondria. They are often used as markers of biomolecules including nucleic acids and proteins. Since molecular weight of the dyes is much smaller than that of the biomolecules, the labelling has a negligible effect on the properties of the biomolecules. In contrast, conjugation of the dyes to low molecular weight (pro)drugs can dramatically alter their properties. For example, conjugates of Cy5 with lysosome&#8208;targeting aminoferrocenes accumulate in mitochondria and exhibit no intracellular effects characteristic for the parent (pro)drugs. Herein we tested several neutral and negatively charged dyes for labelling lysosome&#8208;targeting aminoferrocenes 7 and 8 as well as a non&#8208;targeted control 3. We found that a BODIPY derivative BDP&#8208;TR exhibits the desired unbiased properties: the conjugation does not disturb the intracellular localization of the (pro)drugs, their mode of action and cancer cell specificity. We used the conjugates to clarify the mechanism of action of the aminoferrocenes. In particular, we identified new intermediates, explained why lysosome targeting aminoferrocenes are more potent than their non&#8208;targeted counterparts and evaluated their distribution in vivo.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Red fluorescent dyes are usually charged, lypophilic molecules with the relatively high molecular weight, which tend to localize in specific intracellular locations, e.g., a cyanine dye Cy5 is biased towards mitochondria. They are often used as markers of biomolecules including nucleic acids and proteins. Since molecular weight of the dyes is much smaller than that of the biomolecules, the labelling has a negligible effect on the properties of the biomolecules. In contrast, conjugation of the dyes to low molecular weight (pro)drugs can dramatically alter their properties. For example, conjugates of Cy5 with lysosome-targeting aminoferrocenes accumulate in mitochondria and exhibit no intracellular effects characteristic for the parent (pro)drugs. Herein we tested several neutral and negatively charged dyes for labelling lysosome-targeting aminoferrocenes 7 and 8 as well as a non-targeted control 3. We found that a BODIPY derivative BDP-TR exhibits the desired unbiased properties: the conjugation does not disturb the intracellular localization of the (pro)drugs, their mode of action and cancer cell specificity. We used the conjugates to clarify the mechanism of action of the aminoferrocenes. In particular, we identified new intermediates, explained why lysosome targeting aminoferrocenes are more potent than their non-targeted counterparts and evaluated their distribution in vivo.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Phosphoramidate Prodrug Platform: One&#8208;Pot Amine Functionalization of Kinase Inhibitors with Oligoethylene Glycol for Improved Water&#8208;Solubility</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Small molecular kinase inhibitors play a key role in modern cancer therapy. Protein kinases are essential mediators in the growth and progression of cancerous tumors, rendering involved kinases an increasingly important target for therapy. However, kinase inhibitors are almost insoluble in water because of their hydrophobic aromatic nature, often lowering their availability and pharmacological efficacy. Direct drug functionalization with polar groups represents a simple strategy to improve the drug solubility, availability, and performance. Here, we present a strategy to functionalize secondary amines with oligoethylene glycol (OEG) phosphate using a one&#8208;step synthesis in three exemplary kinase inhibiting drugs Ceritinib, Crizotinib, and Palbociclib. These OEG&#8208;prodrug conjugates demonstrate superior solubility in water compared to the native drugs, with the solubility increasing up to 190&#8208;fold. The kinase inhibition potential is only slightly decreased for the conjugates compared to the native drugs. We further show pH dependent hydrolysis of the OEG&#8208;prodrugs which releases the native drug. We observe a slow release at pH 3, while the conjugates remain stable over 96 h under physiological conditions (pH 7.4). Using confocal microscopy, we verify improved cell uptake of the drug&#8208;OEG conjugates into the cytoplasm of HeLa cells, further supporting our universal solubility approach.</dc:description>

         <title>Encapsulation of Cu(II) Terpyridine Complexes into Polymeric Nanoparticles for Enhanced Anticancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cancer is one of the deadliest diseases worldwide. One of the most commonly applied therapeutic techniques to combat this disease is chemotherapy. Despite its success, the majority of clinically applied chemotherapeutic agents are associated with strong side effects and drug resistance. To overcome this limitation, much research efforts are devoted toward the development of new anticancer agents. Among the most promising class of compounds, Cu(II) complexes have emerged. Despite their strong cytotoxic effect, these agents are typically associated with low water solubility, low stability, and poor tumor selectivity. To overcome these limitations, herein, we report on the encapsulation of a promising Cu(II) terpyridine complex with the Pluronic F&#8208;127/Poloxamer&#8208;407 polymeric carrier into nanoparticles. Besides overcoming the pharmacological drawbacks, the nanoparticles were able to eradicate human breast adenocarcinoma monolayer cells as well as challenging multicellular tumor spheroids at nanomolar concentrations.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Abstract

Reactive N&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;9&#8208;azabicyclo[3.3.1]nonane (ABNOH) linked 2&#8217;&#8208;deoxyuridine 5&#8217;&#8208;O&#8208;mono&#8208; and triphosphates were synthesized through a CuAAC click reaction of ABNO&#8208;H&#8208;PEG4&#8208;N3 with 5&#8208;ethynyl&#8208;dUMP or &#8208;dUTP. The modified triphosphate was used as substrate for enzymatic synthesis of modified DNA probes with KOD XL DNA polymerase. The keto&#8208;ABNO radical reacted with tryptophan (Trp) and Trp&#8208;containing peptides to form a stable 3&#8208;fused hexahydropyrrolo&#8208;indole conjugates.

Reactive N-hydroxy-9-azabicyclo[3.3.1]nonane (ABNOH) linked 2&#8217;-deoxyuridine 5&#8217;-O-mono- and triphosphates were synthesized through a CuAAC click reaction of ABNO-H-PEG4-N3 with 5-ethynyl-dUMP or -dUTP. The modified triphosphate was used as substrate for enzymatic synthesis of modified DNA probes with KOD XL DNA polymerase. The keto-ABNO radical reacted with tryptophan (Trp) and Trp-containing peptides to form a stable 3-fused hexahydropyrrolo-indole conjugates. Similarly modified ABNO-H-linked nucleotides reacted with Trp-containing peptides to form a stable conjugate in the presence but surprisingly even in the absence of NaNO2 (presumably through activation by O2). The reactive ABNO-H-modified DNA probe was used for bioconjugations and crosslinking with Trp-containing peptides or proteins.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>BOROSPHERENE IN THE NANOHOOP: COMPLEXATION AND AROMATICITY OF NEUTRAL AND DIOXIDIZED CYCLOPARAPHENYLENE SUPRAMOLECULES WITH B40 AND C60 FULLERENES</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Supramolecular complexes of carbon nanohoops with fullerenes play a key role for the design of novel nanomaterials with technological applications. Herein we investigate with density functional theory (DFT) methods the capability of neutral and dioxidized cycloparaphenylenes (CPPs) to encapsulate all&#8208;boron fullerene B40. Our results show that [9]CPP and [10]CPP are feasible host candidates to encapsulate B40 displaying comparable complexation energies with the all&#8208;carbon analog [10]CPP[[EQUATION]]C60. Upon dioxidation the host&#8208;guest interactions are not affected, whereas the positive charge is delocalized on the CPPs leading to global aromatic character of the hosts. Consequently, the dicationic complexes [n]CPP2+[[EQUATION]]B40 and [10]CPP2+[[EQUATION]]C60 display augmented global shielding cones that strongly shield the guests, as manifested by large upfield shifts in 11B&#8208;NMR and 13C&#8208;NMR signals. Hence, CPP complexes with carbon fullerenes can be extended borospherene B40 host&#8208;guest complexes, as well as to doubly oxidized species stabilized by global host aromaticity, expanding our understanding of carbon nanohoop complexes to boron&#8208;based fullerenes.</dc:description>

         <title>Strategies for the Development of Asymmetric and Non&#8208;Directed Petasis Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Abstract:&#160;The Petasis reaction is a multicomponent reaction of aldehydes, amines and organoboron reagents and is a useful method for the construction of substituted amines. Despite the significant advancement of the Petasis reaction since its invention in 1993, strategies for asymmetric and non&#8208;directed Petasis reactions remain limited. To date, there are very few catalytic asymmetric Petasis reactions and almost all asymmetric reports employ a chiral auxiliary. Likewise, the aldehyde component often requires a directing group, ultimately limiting the reaction&#8217;s scope. In this concept, key methods for asymmetric and non&#8208;directed Petasis reactions are discussed, focusing on how these conceptual advances can be applied to solve long&#8208;standing gaps in the Petasis literature.</dc:description>

         <title>Corrin Ring Modifications Reveal the Chemical and Spatial Requirements for the B12&#8208;btuB Riboswitch Interaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The btuB riboswitch is a regulatory RNA sequence controlling gene expression of the outer membrane B12 transport protein BtuB by specifically binding coenzyme B12 (AdoCbl) as its natural ligand. The B12 sensing riboswitch class is known to accept various B12 derivatives, leading to a division into two riboswitch subclasses, dependent on the size of the apical ligand. Here we focus on the role of side chains b and e on affinity and proper recognition, i.e. correct structural switch of the btuB RNA, which belongs to the AdoCbl&#8208;binding class I. Chemical modification of these side chains disturbs crucial hydrogen bonds and/or electrostatic interactions with the RNA, its effect on both affinity and switching being monitored by in&#8208;line probing. Chemical modifications at sidechain b of vitamin B12 show larger effects indicating crucial B12&#8208;RNA interactions. When introducing the same modification to AdoCbl the influence of any side&#8208;chain modification tested is reduced. This renders the impact of the adenosyl&#8208;ligand for B12&#8208;btuB riboswitch recognition clearly beyond the known role in affinity.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The morphological symmetry&#8208;retaining and symmetry&#8208;breaking of single crystals of  the &#947;&#8208;cyclodextrin metal&#8208;organic framework have been achieved via introducing lower symmetric &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrins and &#945;&#8208;cyclodextrins, respectively.&#946;&#8208;cyclodextrins led to a morphological evolution with retained symmetry from cubic to rhombic dodecahedra, while &#945;&#8208;cyclodextrins resulted in the original cubic crystal missing a vertex angle presenting symmetry&#8208;breaking behavior.The crystal structures of rhombic dodecahedra and angle&#8208;deficient crystals were confirmed through X&#8208;ray crystallography, and the mechanisms underlying the morphological transformation evolution were further analyzed. Our work not only provides a rare case realizing two different paths of morphological evolution in one system, but also encourages future efforts towards the evolution of artificial crystal systems in a natural way.</dc:description>

         <title>N&#8208;Heterocyclic carbene enabled functionalization of inert C(sp3)&#8208;H bonds via hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) processes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing methods to directly transform C(sp3)&#8208;H bonds is crucial in synthetic chemistry due to their prevalence in various organic compounds. While conventional protocols have largely relied on transition metal catalysis, recent advancements in organocatalysis, particularly with radical NHC catalysis have sparked interest in the direct functionalization of "inert" C(sp3)&#8208;H bonds for cross C&#8208;C coupling with carbonyl moieties. This strategy involves selective cleavage of C(sp3)&#8208;H bonds to generate key carbon radicals, often achieved via hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) processes. By leveraging the bond dissociation energy (BDE) and polarity effects, HAT enables the rapid functionalization of diverse C(sp3)&#8208;H substrates, such as ethers, amines, and alkanes. This mini&#8208;review summarizes the progress in carbene organocatalytic functionalization of inert C(sp3)&#8208;H bonds enabled by HAT processes, categorizing them into two sections: 1) C&#8208;H functionalization involving acyl azolium intermediates; and 2) functionalization of C&#8208;H bonds via reductive Breslow intermediates.</dc:description>

         <title>Conformational Analysis of (+)&#8208;Germacrene D&#8208;4&#8208;ol Using the Crystalline Sponge Method to Elucidate the Origin of its Instability</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The crystalline sponge (CS) method was employed for the X&#8208;ray conformational analysis of a relatively unstable terpene compound, (+)&#8208;germacrene D&#8208;4&#8208;ol. The CS method revealed a reactive conformation of this terpene, in which two double bonds are in proximity.







Abstract
Unsaturated cyclic terpenes often exhibit instability due to the proximation of C=C bonds in the cyclic skeleton, leading to nonenzymatic degradation. In this study, the crystalline sponge (CS) method was employed for the X&#8208;ray conformational analysis of a minute amount of oily and cyclic terpene compound, (+)&#8208;germacrene D&#8208;4&#8208;ol, which was produced by a terpene synthase OILTS under in&#8197;vitro conditions. The CS method revealed a reactive conformation of the cyclic terpene with proximal double bonds. Under weakly acidic in&#8197;vivo conditions, OILTS gave four pseudo&#8208;natural products or artifacts. The CS method also elucidated the structures of these degraded compounds, proposing a degradation mechanism triggered by the transannular reactions.

         <title>Grain Boundary Defect Engineering in Rutile Iridium Oxide Boosts Efficient and Stable Acidic Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Joule heating pretreatment and carbon templates are used to construct grain boudary&#8208;rich IrO2 nanoparticles for promoting acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The assembled proton exchange membrane water electrolysis (PEMWE) with the optimized catalyst (350&#8208;IrO2) exhibits high activity (1.68&#8197;V at 1&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2, 1.84&#8197;V at 2&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2) and stability (100&#8197;h at 1&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2).







Abstract
Proton exchange membrane water electrolysis (PEMWE) is considered a promising technology for coupling with renewable energy sources to achieve clean hydrogen production. However, constrained by the sluggish kinetics of the anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and the acidic abominable environment render the grand challenges in developing the active and stable OER electrocatalyst, leading to low efficiency of PEMWE. Herein, we develop the rutile&#8208;type IrO2 nanoparticles with abundant grain boundaries and the continuous nanostructure through the joule heating and sacrificial template method. The optimal candidate (350&#8208;IrO2) demonstrates remarkable electrocatalytic activity and stability during the OER, presenting a promising advancement for efficient PEMWE. DFT calculations verified that grain boundaries can modulate the electronic structure of Ir sites and optimize the adsorption of oxygen intermediates, resulting in the accelerated kinetics. 350&#8208;IrO2 affords a rapid OER process with 20&#8197;times higher mass activity (0.61&#8197;A mgIr&#8722;1) than the commercial IrO2 at 1.50&#8197;V vs. RHE. Benefiting from the reduced overpotential and the preservation of the stable rutile structure, 350&#8208;IrO2 exhibits the stability of 200&#8197;h test at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 with only trace decay of 11.8&#8197;mV. Moreover, the assembled PEMWE with anode 350&#8208;IrO2 catalyst outputs the current density up to 2&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 with only 1.84&#8197;V applied voltage, long&#8208;term operation for 100&#8197;h without obvious performance degradation at 1&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2.

         <title>Synthesis of Styrylbenzazole Photoswitches and Evaluation of their Photochemical Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report the synthesis and photochemical study of 23 styrylbenzazole photoswitches, which exhibit interesting properties, such as high thermal stabilities of the Z isomers, high quantum yields and negative photochromism. Furthermore, we found that the thermal stability, quantum yields, maximum absorption wavelength and photostationary state distributions can be tuned by modifying the benzazole heterocycle and the substitution pattern on the aryl ring.







Abstract
Styrylbenzazoles form a promising yet under&#8208;represented class of photoswitches that can perform a light&#8208;driven E&#8208;Z isomerization of the central alkene double bond without undergoing irreversible photocyclization, typical of the parent stilbene. In this work, we report the synthesis and photochemical study of 23 styrylbenzazole photoswitches. Their thermal stabilities, quantum yields, maximum absorption wavelengths and photostationary state (PSS) distributions can be tuned by changing the benzazole heterocycle and the substitution pattern on the aryl ring. In particular, we found that push&#8208;pull systems show large redshifts of the maximum absorption wavelengths and the highest quantum yields, whereas ortho&#8208;substituted styrylbenzazole photoswitches exhibit the most favorable PSS ratios. Taking advantage of both design principles, we produced 2,6&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;4&#8208;(dimethylamino)&#8208;styrylbenzothiazole, a thermally stable and efficient P&#8208;type photoswitch which displays negative photochromism upon irradiation with visible light up to 470&#8197;nm to obtain a near&#8208;quantitative isomerization with a very high quantum yield of 59&#8201;%. Furthermore, 4&#8208;hydroxystyrylbenzoxazole was demonstrated to be a pH&#8208;sensitive switch which exhibits a 100&#8197;nm redshift upon deprotonation. Ortho&#8208;methylation of its benzothiazole analogue improved the obtained PSS ratio in its deprotonated state from E&#8201;:&#8201;Z=53&#8201;:&#8201;47 to E&#8201;:&#8201;Z=18&#8201;:&#8201;82. We anticipate that this relatively unexplored class of photoswitches will form a valuable expansion of the current family of photoswitches.

Furthermore, 4-hydroxystyrylbenzoxazole was demonstrated to be a pH-sensitive switch which exhibits a 100&#8197;nm redshift upon deprotonation. &lt;i&gt;Ortho&lt;/i&gt;-methylation of its benzothiazole analogue improved the obtained PSS ratio in its deprotonated state from &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;&#8201;:&#8201;&lt;i&gt;Z&lt;/i&gt;=53&#8201;:&#8201;47 to &lt;i&gt;E&#8201;:&#8201;Z&lt;/i&gt;=18&#8201;:&#8201;82. We anticipate that this relatively unexplored class of photoswitches will form a valuable expansion of the current family of photoswitches.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Photoredox/Bismuth Relay Catalysis Enabling Reductive Alkylation of Nitroarenes with Aldehydes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photoredox/bismuth relay catalysis: A mild and transition metal&#8208;free visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced Photoredox/bismuth dual catalytic system allows sequential hydrogenation of nitroarenes and reductive dibenzylation and provides an facile access to N,N&#8208;dibenzyl anilines.







Abstract
The effective transition metal&#8208;free photoredox/bismuth dual catalytic reductive dialkylation of nitroarenes with benzaldehydes has been reported. The nitroarene reduction through visible light&#8208;driven photoredox catalysis was integrated with subsequent reductive dialkylation of anilines under bismuth catalysis to enable the cascade reductive alkylation of nitroarenes with carbonyls. Salient features of this relay catalysis system include mild reaction conditions, no requirement for transition metal catalysts, easy handling, step&#8208;economy, and high selectivity.

         <title>Thixotropic Composite Hydrogel Electrode Composed of a Polymer Hydrogelator and Water&#8208;Dispersive Tungsten Oxide Flat Microparticles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Gel electrode material: Water&#8208;dispersive WO3 flat microparticles were newly synthesized, demonstrating potential as a spreadable electrode material by mixing with a molecular hydrogel composed of a hydrogelator.







Abstract
Here, we introduce an organic/inorganic composite hydrogel as a versatile gel electrode material. This composite hydrogel was formed by simply mixing an aqueous solution of flat microparticles of tungsten oxide, exhibiting superior water dispersibility, with a hydrogel composed of a water&#8208;soluble polyaramide&#8208;based polymer hydrogelator. The resulting composite hydrogel exhibited uniform dispersion of tungsten oxide flat particles throughout the hydrogel matrix, supplementing the structure formed by the polymer hydrogelator. It maintained the gel&#8208;forming capability and thixotropic behavior inherent to the polymer hydrogelator while showcasing the electrochemical characteristics of tungsten oxide. With its spreadability and applicability to various electrode shapes, a composite hydrogel is presented as a potential spreadable gel electrode material.

         <title>Tridentate Lewis Acids Based on Tribenzotriquinacene Chalices</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dedicated to Professor Lothar Weber on the Occasion of his 80th Birthday.Chalice&#8208;type tridentate poly&#8208;Lewis acids (PLA) based on the C3v symmetric tribenzotriquinacene (TBTQ) have been synthesised and were studied regarding their complexation behaviour with (poly&#8208;)Lewis bases, that led to the synthesis of a tridentate base with a TBTQ backbone. The host&#8208;guest adducts were studied in more detail by DOSY NMR experiments to gain information about the size of the aggregates in solution.







Abstract
Chalice&#8208;shaped tridentate poly&#8208;Lewis acids (PLA) based on the tribenzotriquinacene (TBTQ) scaffold have been synthesised. Stannylation of the alkyne units, attached via phenyl&#8208;spacers to the benzhydrylic positions to the TBTQ scaffold, with Me2NSnMe3 afforded the trimethyltin substituted TBTQ derivative. Replacement of these tin functions with other elements resulted in rigid boron&#8208; and aluminium&#8208;functionalised PLAs. More flexible PLAs were obtained by hydrometallation reactions of the terminal alkyne groups of 4b,8b,12b&#8208;tris((ethynyl)phenyl)tribenzotriquinacene. The resulting poly&#8208;Lewis acids were tested for their acceptor abilities in host&#8208;guest experiments with suitable bases. Preliminary tests with pyridine led to the synthesis of a large tridentate base with three pyridyl groups attached to a TBTQ backbone. Complexation of this Lewis base with the PLAs resulted in the formation of aggregates, which were studied in solution in more detail by 1H DOSY NMR experiments regarding their size. Further experiments were performed with the tridentate bases 1,4,7&#8208;trimethyl&#8208;1,4,7&#8208;triazacyclononane and tris((dimethylphosphino)methyl)phenylsilane.

         <title>Telescoped Flow Synthesis of Azacyclic Scaffolds Exploiting the Chromoselective Photolysis of Vinyl Azides and Azirines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
&#8220;This study reports an efficient and readily scalable photochemical route into azirines and related photo&#8208;dimers that can be accessed from simple vinyl azides in a chromoselective manner. The value of these entities is demonstrated through flow&#8208;based conversions to highly substituted dihydropyrimidines and pyrimidines that are privileged scaffolds in medicinal and materials chemistry.&#8221;







Abstract
An efficient chromoselective photochemical process is presented for the synthesis of 2H&#8208;azirines and 1,3&#8208;diazabicylo[3.1.0]hex&#8208;3&#8208;enes from readily available vinyl azides. The method exploits continuous flow photochemistry to enable the safe consumption of the hazardous azide group and provides uniform irradiation using high&#8208;power LEDs at 365&#8211;450&#8197;nm. Additionally, a scaled telescoped process has been developed providing access to drug&#8208;like 1,6&#8208;dihydropyrimidines and pyrimidines via integrated ring&#8208;expansion and oxidation reactions. Given the prevalence of various azacyclic targets in pharmaceutical, agrochemical and materials applications it is anticipated that this methodology will enable further exploitations of these important scaffolds.

         <title>Spatially Resolved Multicolor Luminescence Tuning on the Single 1D Heterogeneous Microrod</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The spatially resolvable multicolored microrods have potential applications in many fields. However, achieving spatially resolved multi&#8208;color luminescence tuning on the microrod with a fixed composition remains a daunting challenge. Herein, a strategy is proposed that allows for the tuning of spatially resolved, multicolored upconversion (UC) luminescence (UCL) along a 1D heterogeneous microrod by modifying the pulse width of an external laser. NaYbF4:1%Ho is identified as an UCL color&#8208;adjustable material, exhibiting pulse width&#8208;dependent multicolored UCL, resulting in a significant regulation of the red/green (R/G) ratio from 0.1 to 10.3 as the pulse width is varied from 0.1 to 10 ms. Such variability can be ascribed to differences in the number of photons incident upon the microrod throughout the period necessary for the UC process to occur. Additionally, NaYbF4:1%Tm and NaYF4:20%Yb,1%Ho are employed as materials that emit blue and green light, respectively, with their UCL colors largely unaffected by changes in the pulse width. Subsequently, a tip&#8208;modified epitaxial growth method is utilized to integrate both UCL color&#8208;adjustable and non&#8208;adjustable segments within the same microrod. Comparing with single&#8208;color or fixed multi&#8208;color microrods, our developed multisegmented emissive color adjustable 1D heterogeneous microrods have unique optical characteristics and can carry more optical information.</dc:description>

         <title>Semi&#8208;interpenetrating polymer network anion exchange membranes based on quaternized polybenzoxazine and poly(vinyl alcohol&#8208;co&#8208;ethylene) for acid recovery by diffusion dialysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Acid recovery from acidic waste is a pressing issue in current times. Chemical methods for recovery are not economically feasible and require significant energy input to save the environment. This study reported a semi&#8208;interpenetrating polymer network (semi&#8208;IPN) anion exchange membranes (AEMs) for acid recovery by diffusion dialysis with excellent dimensional stability, high oxidation stability, good acid dialysis coefficient (UH+) and high separation factor (S). Semi&#8208;IPN AEMs are prepared by ring&#8208;open cross&#8208;linked quaternized polybenzoxazine (AQBZ) with poly(vinyl alcohol&#8208;co&#8208;ethylene), where AQBZ is obtained by Mannich reaction and Menshutkin reaction. Four proportions of semi&#8208;IPNs exhibit clear micro&#8208;phase separation, which is conducive to ion transport. The water uptake of the four semi&#8208;IPNs ranges from 14.2% to 19.2%, while the swelling ratio remains between 8.7% and 11.3%. These results indicate that the cross&#8208;linked structure in the designed semi&#8208;IPNs effectively control swelling and ensure dimensional stability. The thermal degradation temperature (Td5) of semi&#8208;IPN4:6 to semi&#8208;IPN7:3 varies from 309&#176;C to 289&#176;C, with an oxidation stability weight loss rate (WOX) ranging from 91.5% to 93.5%, demonstrating excellent thermal stability and oxidation stability. The semi&#8208;IPNs also show good UH+ values ranging from 11.9&#8208;16.3*10&#8208;3 m/h and high S values between 38.6 to 45.9, indicating the promising potential of the semi&#8208;IPNs.</dc:description>

         <title>Functionalization of Alginate Hydrogels with a Multifunctional Peptide Supports Mesenchymal Stem Cell Adhesion and Reduces Bacterial Colonization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hydrogels with cell adhesive moieties stand out as promising materials to enhance tissue healing and regeneration. Nonetheless, bacterial infections of the implants represent an unmet major concern. In the present work, we developed an alginate hydrogel modified with a multifunctional peptide containing the RGD cell adhesive motif in combination with an antibacterial peptide derived from the 1&#8208;11 region of lactoferrin (LF). The RGD&#8208;LF branched peptide was successfully anchored to the alginate backbone by carbodiimide chemistry, as demonstrated by 1H NMR and fluorescence measurements. The functionalized hydrogel presented desirable physicochemical properties (porosity, swelling and rheological behavior) to develop biomaterials for tissue engineering. The viability of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) on the peptide&#8208;functionalized hydrogels was excellent, with values higher than 85% at day 1, and higher than 95% after 14 days in culture. Moreover, the biological characterization demonstrated the ability of the hydrogels to significantly enhance ALP activity of MSCs as well as to decrease bacterial colonization of both Gram&#8208;positive and Gram&#8208;negative models. Such results prove the potential of the functionalized hydrogels as novel biomaterials for tissue engineering, simultaneously displaying cell adhesive activity and the capacity to prevent bacterial contamination, a dual bioactivity commonly not found for these types of hydrogels.</dc:description>

         <title>Binary and Ternary Deep Eutectic Solvents for Methylene Green Electropolymerization on Multiwalled Carbon Nanotubes: Optimization, Characterization and Application</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Choline chloride (ChCl) based binary and ternary deep eutectic solvents (DES) were evaluated for methylene green electropolymerization with oxalic acid (OA) and ethylene glycol (EG) as hydrogen bond donors. Binary DES ChCl:OA in molar ratios 1:1 and 2:1 and ChCl:EG 1:2 and ternary DES (tDES) in different molar ratios and percentages of water were evaluated. The highest polymer growth was in ChCl:OA:EG&#8208;tDES with added water, that had a lower viscosity and higher ionic conductivity when associated with HCl as dopant. This enhanced the formation of more cation radicals and, consequently, more polymer formation. The PMG/MWCNT/GCE&#8208;tDES sensor was successfully applied to the simultaneous determination of 5&#8208;aminosalicylic acid (5&#8208;ASA) and acetaminophen (APAP) by differential pulse voltammetry in the concentration range 2 &#181;M &#8208; 200 &#181;M, with detection limits of 0.37 &#181;M and 0.49 &#181;M for 5&#8208;ASA and APAP, respectively. The sensor demonstrated good repeatability, reproducibility and stability, and was successfully applied in pharmaceutical formulations.</dc:description>

         <title>Post&#8208;synthetic Metalation on the Ionic TiO2 Surface to Enhance Metal&#8208;CO2 Interaction During Photochemical CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Post&#8208;Modification for CO2 Reduction. The ionic surface of a polyoxometalate stabilized 6&#8197;nm photoactive TiO2 nanocore allows post&#8208;synthetic copper exchange on the surface of the nanoparticles. Copper(II) ions on the surface show enhanced CO2 adsorption and act as the reactive center to transfer photoexcited electrons to stabilize the M&#8208;[CO2]&#8722; intermediate, detected by quasi&#8208;in&#8208;situ Raman and labeling study, which has earlier been speculated as the reactive species to direct the selectivity of photochemical CO2 reduction.







Abstract
During the photochemical CO2 reduction reaction, CO2 adsorption on the catalyst's surface is a crucial step where the binding mode of the [metal&#8208;CO2] adduct directs the product selectivity and efficiency. Herein, an ionic TiO2 nanostructure stabilized by polyoxometalates (POM), ([POM]x@TiO2), is prepared and the sodium counter ions present on the surface to balance the POMs&#8217; charge are replaced with copper(II) ions, (Cux[POM]@TiO2). The microscopic and spectroscopic studies affirm the copper exchange without altering the TiO2 core and weak coordination of copper (II) ions to the POMs&#8217; surface. Band structure analysis suggests the photo&#8208;harvesting efficiency of the TiO2 core with the conduction band edge higher than the reduction potential of CuII/I and multi&#8208;electron CO2 reduction potentials. Photochemical CO2 reduction with Cux[POM]@TiO2 results in 30&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;gcat.&#8722;1 CO (79&#8201;%) and 8&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;gcat&#8722;1 of CH4 (21&#8201;%). Quasi&#8208;in&#8208;situ Raman study provides evidence in support of CO2 adsorption on the Cux[POM]@TiO2 surface. 13C and D2O labeling studies affirm the {Cu&#8208;[CO2]&#8722;} adduct formation. Despite the photo&#8208;harvesting ability of Nax[POM]@TiO2 itself, the poor CO2 adsorption ability of sodium ions highlights the crucial role of copper ion CO2 photo&#8208;reduction. Characterization of the {M&#8208;[&#951;2&#8208;CO2]&#8722;} species via surface tuning validates the CO2 activation and photochemical reduction pathway proposed earlier.

We present here the encapsulation of an FeII spin crossover complex C1 inside MOF&#8208;808(Zr), a chemically robust Metal&#8208;Organic Framework. The compound C1&#8834;MOF&#8208;808 retains its crystallinity as well as a partial porosity compared to pristine MOF and shows a reversible solvatochromism under formaldehyde and formic acid vapor sorption associated to a spin state change of the guest complex.







Abstract
We present here the encapsulation of a spin crossover complex C1 [FeII(L)] (L: 4&#8208;amino&#8208;, 2&#8208;(2&#8208;pyridinylmethylene)hydrazide) inside MOF&#8208;808(Zr), a chemically robust Metal&#8208;Organic Framework. The compound C1&#8834;MOF&#8208;808 retains its crystallinity as well as a partial porosity compared to pristine MOF and shows solvatochromism under Volatile Organic compounds (VOCs) sorption associated to a spin state change of the guest complex. More specifically, this compound shows an interesting reversible color change under formaldehyde and formic acid vapor sorption and can therefore be considered as a new kind of optical VOCs chemosensor, opening new doors for developing a broad range of VOCs optical sensors.

         <title>Influence of Chemical Modifications of the Crystallophore on Protein Nucleating Properties and Supramolecular Interactions Network</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Crystallophores are lanthanide complexes known to favor protein crystallization. Herein, we explore the effect of the introduction of pendant arms at the free amino position of the TACN macrocycle on the nucleating properties and protein crystal structures. Through high&#8208;throughput crystallization experiments and dataset analysis, we evaluated the effectiveness of these variants, in comparison to the first crystallophore generation, and highlighted the potential of the V1 variant, featuring a propanol pendant arm.







Abstract
Crystallophores are lanthanide complexes that have demonstrated outstanding induction of crystallization for various proteins. This article explores the effect of tailored modifications of the crystallophore first generation and their impact on the nucleating properties and protein crystal structures. Through high&#8208;throughput crystallization experiments and dataset analysis, we evaluated the effectiveness of these variants, in comparison to the first crystallophore generation G1. In particular, the V1 variant, featuring a propanol pendant arm, demonstrated the ability to produce new crystallization conditions for the proteins tested (hen&#8208;egg white lysozyme, proteinase K and thaumatin). Structural analysis performed in the case of hen egg&#8208;white lysozyme along with Molecular Dynamics simulations, highlights V1&#8242;s unique behavior, taking advantage of the flexibility of its propanol arm to explore different protein surfaces and form versatile supramolecular interactions.

         <title>Enhanced Low&#8208;Temperature Resistance of Lithium&#8208;Metal Rechargeable Batteries Based on Electrolyte Including Ethyl Acetate and LiDFOB Additives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Adjusting the solvent structure and reducing the desolvation energy enables the electrolyte to withstand high voltages and low temperatures. Li//LCO and HC//LCO batteries using this electrolyte can still operate within the voltage range of 3.0 to 4.5&#8197;V at &#8722;40&#8201;&#176;C, exhibiting high discharge specific capacities and long cycling performance.







Abstract
To meet the demand for higher energy density in lithium&#8208;ion batteries and expand their application range, coupling lithium metal anodes with high&#8208;voltage cathodes is an ideal solution. However, the compatibility between lithium metal batteries and electrolytes affects their applicability. In this study, proposes a locally concentrated electrolyte based on ethyl acetate (EA) as the solvent, lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (LiTFSI) as the lithium salt, and lithium difluorooxoborate (LiDFOB) as a sacrificial agent to enhance the low&#8208;temperature and high&#8208;voltage endurance of Li//Lithium cobalt oxide (LCO) batteries. The Li//LCO battery can operate within the voltage range of 3 to 4.5&#8197;V, with an initial discharge specific capacity of 174.5&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 20&#8201;&#176;C. At &#8722;40&#8201;&#176;C, after 200 cycles, the capacity retention rate is 87.7&#8201;%. It can operate under extreme conditions of &#8722;70&#8201;&#176;C, with a discharge specific capacity of 112.6&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1. Additionally, LCO//HC batteries using this electrolyte demonstrate excellent performance. Present work provides a new perspective for the optimization of electrolytes for low&#8208;temperature lithium&#8208;ion batteries.

Abstract
Carbon dots (C&#8208;dots) obtained from D&#8208;glucose have attracted great interest because of their properties and as a model for understanding the synthesis process and the origin of photoluminescence in carbon&#8208;based nanostructures. Synthesising C&#8208;dots under hydrothermal conditions has become one of the most common methods for their preparation. Understanding the details of this process is quite difficult. To tackle this challenge, we have adopted a multi&#8208;technique approach in our present work. We have correlated different spectroscopic analyses, such as infrared, Raman, fluorescence, NMR, and UV&#8208;Vis, to connect the emissions with specific chemical groups. In particular, in&#8197;situ infrared analysis as a function of temperature has allowed following the formation of C=C, C=O, and COOH species and the rise of specific emissions. Only weak emissions due to n&#8208;&#960;* transitions are detected upon post&#8208;synthesis thermal annealing.

A practical method for the preparation of a wide range of 2&#8208;butene&#8208;1,4&#8208;diol monoesters using Pd&#8208;catalysis is described that combines typically high yields, high chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208; and stereocontrol under mild operating conditions. The target compounds find application in the synthesis of a range of bifunctional scaffolds that have potential in complex molecule synthesis.







Abstract
(Z)&#8208;alkenes are useful synthons but thermodynamically less stable than their (E)&#8208;isomers and typically more difficult to prepare. The synthesis of 1,4&#8208;hetero&#8208;bifunctionalized (Z)&#8208;alkenes is particularly challenging due to the inherent regio&#8208; and stereoselectivity issues. Herein we demonstrate a general, chemoselective and direct synthesis of (Z)&#8208;2&#8208;butene&#8208;1,4&#8208;diol monoesters. The protocol operates within a Pd&#8208;catalyzed decarboxylative acyloxylation regime involving vinyl ethylene carbonates (VECs) and various carboxylic acids as the reaction partners under mild and operationally attractive conditions. The newly developed process allows access to a structurally diverse pool of (Z)&#8208;2&#8208;butene&#8208;1,4&#8208;diol monoesters in good yields and with excellent regio&#8208; and stereoselectivity. Various synthetic transformations of the obtained (Z)&#8208;2&#8208;butene&#8208;1,4&#8208;diol monoesters demonstrate how these synthons are of great use to rapidly diversify the portfolio of these formal desymmetrized (Z)&#8208;alkenes.

         <title>Defect&#8208;Engineered Metal&#8208;Organic Framework/Polyimide Mixed Matrix Membrane for CO2 Separation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Engineering defects on the Zr&#8208;fumarate MOF by heating the as&#8208;synthesized material at 320 &#176;C creates open Zr coordination sites, which improve its performance as the filler in mixed matrix membranes for CO2 separation, increasing both the permeability and selectivity over the Robeson upper bound for CO2/CH4 separation.







Abstract
Defect&#8208;engineered metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) with outstanding structural and chemical features have become excellent candidates for specific separation applications. The introduction of structural defects in MOFs as an efficient approach to manipulate their functionality provides excellent opportunities for the preparation of MOF&#8208;based mixed matrix membranes (MMMs). However, the use of this strategy to adjust the properties and develop the separation performance of gas separation membranes is still in its early stages. Here, a novel defect&#8208;engineered MOF (quasi ZrFum or Q&#8208;ZrFum) was synthesized via a controlled thermal deligandation process and incorporated into a CO2&#8208;philic 6FDA&#8208;durene polyimide (PI) matrix to form Q&#8208;ZrFum loaded MMMs. Defect&#8208;engineered MOFs and fabricated MMMs were investigated regarding their characteristic properties and separation performance. The incorporation of defects into the MOF structure increases the pore size and provides unsaturated active metal sites that positively affect CO2 molecule transport. The interfacial compatibility between the Q&#8208;ZrFum particles and the PI matrix increases via the deligandation process, which improves the mechanical strength of Q&#8208;ZrFum loaded membranes. MMM containing 5&#8197;wt.% of defect&#8208;engineered Q&#8208;ZrFum exhibits excellent CO2 permeability of 1308 Barrer, which increased by 99&#8201;% compared to the pure PI membrane (656 Barrer) at a feed pressure of 2&#8197;bar. CO2/CH4 and CO2/N2 selectivity reached 44 and 26.6 which increased by about 70 and 16&#8201;%, respectively. This study emphasizes that defect&#8208;engineered MOFs can be promising candidates for use as fillers in the preparation of MMMs for the future development of membrane&#8208;based gas separation applications.

&lt;p&gt;Engineering defects on the Zr-fumarate MOF by heating the as-synthesized material at 320 &lt;sup&gt;&#176;&lt;/sup&gt;C creates open Zr coordination sites, which improve its performance as the filler in mixed matrix membranes for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; separation, increasing both the permeability and selectivity over the Robeson upper bound for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; separation.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Defect-engineered metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) with outstanding structural and chemical features have become excellent candidates for specific separation applications. The introduction of structural defects in MOFs as an efficient approach to manipulate their functionality provides excellent opportunities for the preparation of MOF-based mixed matrix membranes (MMMs). However, the use of this strategy to adjust the properties and develop the separation performance of gas separation membranes is still in its early stages. Here, a novel defect-engineered MOF (quasi ZrFum or Q-ZrFum) was synthesized via a controlled thermal deligandation process and incorporated into a CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-philic 6FDA-durene polyimide (PI) matrix to form Q-ZrFum loaded MMMs. Defect-engineered MOFs and fabricated MMMs were investigated regarding their characteristic properties and separation performance. The incorporation of defects into the MOF structure increases the pore size and provides unsaturated active metal sites that positively affect CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; molecule transport. The interfacial compatibility between the Q-ZrFum particles and the PI matrix increases via the deligandation process, which improves the mechanical strength of Q-ZrFum loaded membranes. MMM containing 5&#8197;wt.% of defect-engineered Q-ZrFum exhibits excellent CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; permeability of 1308 Barrer, which increased by 99&#8201;% compared to the pure PI membrane (656 Barrer) at a feed pressure of 2&#8197;bar. CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; selectivity reached 44 and 26.6 which increased by about 70 and 16&#8201;%, respectively. This study emphasizes that defect-engineered MOFs can be promising candidates for use as fillers in the preparation of MMMs for the future development of membrane-based gas separation applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Electrosynthesis of dihydroxycoumestan and its application as topoisomerase I poison.







Abstract
Coumestan represents a biologically relevant structural motif distributed in a number of natural products, and the rapid construction of related derivatives as well as the characterization of targets would accelerate lead compound discovery in medicinal chemistry. In this work, a general and scalable approach to 8,9&#8208;dihydroxycoumestans via two&#8208;electrode constant current electrolysis was developed. The application of a two&#8208;phase (aqueous/organic) system plays a crucial role for success, protecting the sensitive o&#8208;benzoquinone intermediates from over&#8208;oxidation. Based on the structurally diverse products, a primary SAR study on coumestan scaffold was completed, and compound 3&#8201;r exhibited potent antiproliferative activities and a robust topoisomerase I (Top1) inhibitory activity. Further mechanism studies demonstrates that compound 3&#8201;r was a novel Top1 poison, which might open an avenue for the development of Top1&#8208;targeted antitumor agent.

         <title>Cleaving Folded RNA by Multifunctional DNAzyme Nanomachines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The developed multifunctional DNAzyme nanomachine (DNM) binds RNA by four short RNA binding arms, which ensure tight and highly selective RNA binding. The design can increase both the binding and product release steps of the DNAzyme catalytic cycle. The approach is efficient in cleaving RNA having stable secondary structures.







Abstract
Both tight and specific binding of folded biological mRNA is required for gene silencing by oligonucleotide gene therapy agents. However, this is fundamentally impossible using the conventional oligonucleotide probes according to the affinity/specificity dilemma. This study addresses this problem for cleaving folded RNA by using multicomponent agents (dubbed &#8216;DNA nanomachine&#8217; or DNM). DNMs bind RNA by four short RNA binding arms, which ensure tight and highly selective RNA binding. Along with the improved affinity, DNM maintain the high sequence selectivity of the conventional DNAzymes. DNM enabled up to 3&#8208;fold improvement in DNAzymes catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km) by facilitating both RNA substrate binding and product release steps of the catalytic cycle. This study demonstrates that multicomponent probes organized in sophisticated structures can help to achieve the balance between affinity and selectivity in recognizing folded RNA and thus creates a foundation for applying complex DNA nanostructures derived by DNA nanotechnology in gene therapy.

         <title>Direct Comparative Studies Revealing the Contribution of TADF Activity of Organic Emitters Towards Efficient Electrochemiluminescence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We presented four Carbazole&#8208;benzonitrile molecules possessing similar properties to facilitate a fairer comparison, thereby highlighting the influence of TADF on improving ECL. Intense ECL emission was observed from 4CzBN, underscoring the substantial difference in the ECL among molecules with comparable &#916;EST and similar spectral properties but varying TADF activity.







Abstract
Electrochemiluminescence (ECL) featuring thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) properties has attracted considerable interest, showcasing their potential for 100&#8201;% exciton harvesting, which marks a significant advancement in the realm of organic ECL. However, the challenge of elucidating the precise contribution of TADF to the enhanced ECL efficiency arises due to the lack of comparative studies of organic compounds with or without efficient TADF properties. In this study, we present four carbazole&#8208;benzonitrile molecules possessing similar chemical structures and comparable exchange energy (&#916;EST). Despite their comparable properties, these compounds exhibited varying TADF efficiencies, warranting a closer examination of their underlying structural and electronic characteristics governing the optical properties. Consequently, intense ECL emission was only observed from 4CzBN with a remarkable TADF efficiency, underscoring the substantial difference in the ECL signal among molecules with comparable &#916;EST and similar spectral properties but varying TADF activity.

         <title>Active Site Environment and Reactivity of Copper&#8208;A&#946; in Membrane Mimetic SDS Micellar Environment</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by the abnormal aggregation of amyloid &#946; (A&#946;) peptide in extracellular deposits generated upon proteolysis of Amyloid Precursor Protein (APP). While copper (Cu2+) binds to A&#946; in soluble oligomeric and aggregated forms, its interaction with membrane&#8208;bound A&#946; remains elusive. Investigating these interactions is crucial for understanding AD pathogenesis. Here, utilizing SDS micelles as a simplified membrane mimic, we focus on elucidating the interplay between membrane&#8208;anchored A&#946; and copper, given their pivotal roles in AD. We employed spectroscopic techniques including UV, CD, and EPR to characterize the active site of Cu&#8208;A&#946; complexes. Our findings demonstrate that copper interacts with A&#946; peptides in membrane&#8208;mimicking micellar environments similarly to aqueous buffer solutions. Cu&#8208;A&#946; complexes in this medium also induce higher hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) production, potentially contributing to AD&#8208;related oxidative stress. Moreover, we observe an increased oxidation rate of neurotransmitter such as dopamine by Cu&#8208;A&#946; complexes. These results enhance our understanding of Cu&#8208;A&#946; interactions in AD pathology and offer insights into potential therapeutic interventions targeting this interaction.</dc:description>

         <title>Self&#8208;immolative Polymer Hydrogels via&#160;In Situ&#160;Gelation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hydrogels are of interest for a wide range of applications. The ability to control when the hydrogel degrades can provide beneficial properties such as controlled degradation in the environment or the stimulated release of drugs or cells. Self&#8208;immolative polymers are a class of degradable polymers that undergo complete end&#8208;to&#8208;end depolymerization upon the application of a stimulus. They have been explored for hydrogel development, but the ability to prepare and selectively degrade self&#8208;immolative hydrogels under neutral aqueous conditions has so far been limited. We describe here the preparation of water&#8208;soluble polyglyoxyamides with cross&#8208;linkable pendent azides and their cross&#8208;linking to form hydrogels with 4&#8208;arm poly(ethylene glycol)s having unstrained and strained alkynes using copper&#8208;assisted and strain&#8208;promoted azide&#8208;alkyne click chemistry respectively. The influence of pendent azide density and solution polymer content on the resulting hydrogels was evaluated. A polyglyoxylamide with a 70:30 ratio of pendent hydroxyl:azide successfully provided hydrogels with compressive moduli ranging from 1.3 &#8211; 6.3 kPa under copper&#8208;free conditions at 10 &#8211; 20% (w/w) of polymer in phosphate&#8208;buffered saline. Selective depolymerization and degradation of the hydrogels upon irradiation with light was demonstrated, resulting in reductions in the compressive moduli and the release of depolymerization products that were detected by NMR spectroscopy.</dc:description>

         <title>Preparation and Optical and Electrochemical Properties of Boron (III) Octafluorosubphthalocyanines with One Triselenole and One Diselenet Ring</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Unsymmetric boron (III) subphthalocyanines with a triselenole ring or a diselenete ring and eight fluoro groups were prepared by the reaction of 5,6&#8208;dicyano&#8208;4,7&#8208;diethylbenzo&#8208;[1,2,3]triselenole and tetrafluorophthalonitrile with trichloroborane in xylene. The reaction was accompanied by a contraction of the triselenole ring to the diselenete ring. The substrate, dicyanobenzo[1,2,3]triselenole, was prepared by a new procedure via a photolytic demethylenation reaction of 3,7&#8208;diethyl[1,3]diselenolophthalonitrile using a 10 W white LED light. While triselenolosubphthalocyanine was treated by triphenylphosphine to give the diselenete derivative, the reaction of diselenetosubphthalocyanine with Woolion&#8217;s reagent produced the expanded triselenole ring. The diselenete derivative reacted with tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)platinum to yield the corresponding platinum complex with Se&#8208;Pt bonds. Q&#8208;band absorption for the products appeared at around &#955;max = 590 nm in the UV&#8208;vis spectrum and weak emission was observed at about &#955;e = 620 nm. When diselenetosubphthalocyanine was treated with pentachloro antimonate in dichloromethane or sodium metal in hexane/tetrahydrofuran, the solution showed strong ESR signals. The structures of model compounds were optimized using the DFT method with the Gaussian 09 program at the B3LYP/6&#8208;31G (d, p) level.</dc:description>

         <title>Fluorination/Dearomatization of C6F5 Groups: An FLP Route to an Electrophilic Borane and Non&#8208;Coordinating Anions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrophilic fluorination and de&#8208;aromatization of C6F5 rings in boranes and borate derivatives is achieved using XeF2 in the presence of BF3 or Lewis acidic cations. Thus, the anions [FB(C6F7)3]&#8722;, [B(C6F7)4]&#8722;, and [(C6F7)3BC&#8801;NB(C6F7)3]&#8722;, and borane adducts (L)B(C6F7)3 (L=MeCN, OPEt3) are reported.







Abstract
B(C6F5)3 and the corresponding anion [B(C6F5)4]&#8722; are ubiquitous in main group and transition metal chemistry. Known derivatives are generally limited to the incorporation of electron donating substituents. Herein we describe electrophilic fluorination and dearomatization of such species using XeF2 in the presence of BF3 or Lewis acidic cations. In this fashion the anions [HB(C6F5)3]&#8722;, [B(C6F5)4]&#8722; and [(C6F5)3BC&#8801;NB(C6F5)3]&#8722;, are converted to [FB(C6F7)3]&#8722;, [B(C6F7)4]&#8722;, and [(C6F7)3BC&#8801;NB(C6F7)3]&#8722;, respectively. Similarly, the borane adducts (L)B(C6F7)3 (L=MeCN, OPEt3) are produced. These rare examples of electrophilic attack of electron deficient rings proceed as [XeF][BF4] acts as a frustrated Lewis pair effecting fluorination and dearomatization of C6F5 rings.

         <title>A Monometallic Bis(cyaphido) Complex</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bis(cyaphido) complex is achieved for the first time, demonstrating the viability of incorporating multiple cyaphido ligands at one metal center. Comparison with the heteroleptic C&#8801;N/C&#8801;P analogue offers the first direct experimental comparison of cyaphide with cyanide. A degree of cooperative delocalization within the bis(cyaphido) complex illustrates the cyaphido ligand exhibiting some &#960;&#8208;donor, in addition to its &#960;&#8208;acceptor, character.







Abstract
The first example of a bis(cyaphido) complex, trans&#8208;[Ru(dppe)2(C&#8801;P)2], is described, unequivocally demonstrating the synthetic accessibility and stability of complexes that feature more than one cyaphido ligand. Synthesis is achieved from the precedent cation [Ru(dppe)2(C&#8801;P)]+ via sequential coordination and desilylation of the phosphaalkyne Me3SiC&#8801;P. The heteroleptic analogue trans&#8208;[Ru(dppe)2(C&#8801;N)(C&#8801;P)] is also prepared from the same cation and NaCN; both cyaphido complexes are structurally characterized, enabling the first direct comparison of cyaphide with cyanide, its isoelectronic and isolobal counterpart. This demonstrates an enhanced &#960;&#8208;acidity for &#8722;C&#8801;P over &#8722;C&#8801;N, while computational studies reveal also a higher &#960;&#8208;donor character for the cyaphido ligand.

&lt;p&gt;The first example of a bis(cyaphido) complex, &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;-[Ru(dppe)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(C&#8801;P)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;], is described, unequivocally demonstrating the synthetic accessibility and stability of complexes that feature more than one cyaphido ligand. Synthesis is achieved from the precedent cation [Ru(dppe)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(C&#8801;P)]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; via sequential coordination and desilylation of the phosphaalkyne Me&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;SiC&#8801;P. The heteroleptic analogue &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;-[Ru(dppe)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(C&#8801;N)(C&#8801;P)] is also prepared from the same cation and NaCN; both cyaphido complexes are structurally characterized, enabling the first direct comparison of cyaphide with cyanide, its isoelectronic and isolobal counterpart. This demonstrates an enhanced &#960;-acidity for &lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;C&#8801;P over &lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;C&#8801;N, while computational studies reveal also a higher &#960;-donor character for the cyaphido ligand.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>The Complete Assessment of Small Molecule and Peptidomimetic Inhibitors of Sortase A Towards Antivirulence Treatment</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review covers the most recent advances in the development of inhibitors for the bacterial enzyme sortase A (SrtA), where it is considered as a major target for antivirulence therapy. Sortases are key enzymes regulating bacterial adherence to host cells and are considered major virulence factors. Currently, many promising approaches to target SrtA are available, including naturally derived and synthetic small molecule inhibitors as well as peptidomimetic inhibitors, based on the SrtA recognition sequence.







Abstract
This review covers the most recent advances in the development of inhibitors for the bacterial enzyme sortase A (SrtA). Sortase A (SrtA) is a critical virulence factor, present ubiquitously in Gram&#8208;positive bacteria of which many are pathogenic. Sortases are key enzymes regulating bacterial adherence to host cells, by anchoring extracellular matrix&#8208;binding proteins to the bacterial outer cell wall. By targeting virulence factors, effective treatment can be achieved, without inducing antibiotic resistance to the treatment. This is a potentially more sustainable, long&#8208;term approach to treating bacterial infections, including ones that display multiple resistance to current therapeutics. There are many promising approaches available for SrtA inhibition, some of which have the potential to advance into further clinical development, with peptidomimetic and in&#8197;vivo active small molecules being among the most promising. There are currently no approved drugs on the market targeting SrtA, despite its promise, adding to the relevance of this review article, as it extends to the pharmaceutical industry additionally to academic researchers.

         <title>Unlocking Photocatalytic Activity of Acridinium Salts by Anion&#8208;Binding Co&#8208;Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The merge of anion&#8208;binding and photoredox catalysis for the modular, in&#8197;situ photocatalytic activation of acridinium salts is reported. This approach leads to an enhancement of the stability and selectivity of the photoactive ion pair species, which proved effective to promote several visible light&#8208;mediated photoredox reactions.







Abstract
The in&#8197;situ generation of active photoredox organic catalysts upon anion&#8208;binding co&#8208;catalysis by making use of the ionic nature of common photosensitizers is reported. Hence, the merge of anion&#8208;binding and photocatalysis permitted the modulation of the photocatalytic activity of simple acridinium halide salts, building an effective anion&#8208;binding &#8211; photoredox ion pair complex able to promote a variety of visible light driven transformations, such as anti&#8208;Markovnikov addition to olefins, Diels&#8208;Alder and the desilylative C&#8722;C bond forming reactions. Anion&#8208;binding studies, together with steady&#8208;state and time&#8208;resolved spectroscopy analysis, supported the postulated ion pair formation between the thiourea hydrogen&#8208;bond donor organocatalyst and the acridinium salt, which proved essential for unlocking the photocatalytic activity of the photosensitizer.

         <title>Stable CAAC&#8208;Triazenes: A New Nitrogen Ligand System With Donor and Conformational Flexibility, and With Application in Olefin Activation Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unusually stable: Triazenes stabilized with a cyclic (amino)(alkyl)carbene are readily accessible, remarkably stable towards thermal N2 loss and undergo partially reversible E&#8208;to&#8208;Z isomerization. They offer a large &#960;&#8208;conjugation that extends from the N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene and through all three nitrogens and, when used as ligand to palladium, impart high catalytic activity in olefin oligomerization and double bond migration.







Abstract
N&#8208;heterocyclic imines such as pyridylidene amines impart high catalytic activity when coordinated to a transition metal, largely imposed by their electronic flexibility. Here, this donor flexibility has been applied for the first time to CAAC&#8208;based systems through the synthesis of CAAC&#8208;triazenes. These new ligands offer a larger &#960;&#8208;conjugation that extends from the N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene through three nitrogens rather than just one, as observed in N&#8208;heterocyclic imines. We demonstrate the straightforward synthesis of three new CAAC&#8208;triazenes containing different substituents on the terminal triazene nitrogen. These compounds are remarkably stable up to 120&#8201;&#176;C without loss of N2 as typically observed with similar triazenes. E&#8208;to&#8208;Z isomerization within the triazene is instigated by UV light and is partially reversible dependent on the triazene substituent. The quinoline&#8208;substituted CAAC&#8208;triazene 1&#8208;Q has been applied as an L,L&#8217;&#8208;type ligand in the synthesis of [PdCl2(1&#8208;Q)], [PdCl(Me)(1&#8208;Q)] and [Pd(Me)(H2O(1&#8208;Q)]+. E&#8208;to&#8208;Z ligand isomerization also occurs when coordinated to PdCl2, providing access to on&#8208;metal manipulation. The cationic complex [PdMe(H2O)(1&#8208;Q)]+ is a precatalyst for oligomerization of ethylene to form initially 2&#8208;butene and subsequently linear and branched C8&#8722;C12 products from butene activation. Moreover, isomerization of 1&#8208;hexene takes place efficiently with exceptionally low catalyst loading (10&#8197;ppm) and up to 74,000 turnover numbers.

         <title>An Efficient and Scalable &#8220;Second Generation&#8221; Total Synthesis of the Marine Polyketide Limaol Endowed with Antiparasitic Activity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The apparently non&#8208;thermodynamic cluster of skipped exo&#8208;methylene substituents on the &#8220;northern&#8221; wing of limaol is not the Achilles heel of this unique dinoflagellate&#8208;derived marine natural product; rather, the proper choice of protecting groups on the spiroketal core proved to be key for an efficient synthesis. In consideration thereof, a &#8220;second generation&#8221; synthesis was devised that is practical, robust, efficient and scalable.







Abstract
The cluster of four skipped exo&#8208;methylene substituents on the &#8220;northern&#8221; wing of limaol renders this dinoflagellate&#8208;derived marine natural product unique in structural terms. This arguably non&#8208;thermodynamic array gains kinetic stability by virtue of populating local conformations which impede isomerization to a partly or fully conjugated polyene. This analysis suggested that the difficulties encountered during the late stages of our first total synthesis of this polyketide had not been caused by an overly fragile character of this unusual substructure; rather, an unfavorable steric microenvironment about the spirotricyclic core was identified as the likely cause. To remedy the issue, the protecting groups on this central fragment were changed; in effect, this amendment allowed all strategic and practical problems to be addressed. As a result, the overall yield over the longest linear sequence was multiplied by a factor of almost five and the material throughput increased more than eighty&#8208;fold per run. Key&#8208;to&#8208;success was a gold&#8208;catalyzed spirocyclization reaction; the reasons why a Br&#248;nsted acid cocatalyst is needed and the origin of the excellent levels of selectivity were delineated. The change of the protecting groups also allowed for much improved fragment coupling processes; most notably, the sequence of a substrate&#8208;controlled carbonyl addition reaction followed by Mitsunobu inversion that had originally been necessary to affix the southern tail to the core could be replaced by a reagent controlled asymmetric allylation. Finally, a much&#8208;improved route to the &#8220;northern&#8221; sector was established by leveraging the power of asymmetric hydrogenation of a 2&#8208;pyrone derivative. Limaol was found to combine appreciable antiparasitic activity with very modest cytotoxicity.

         <title>Synthesis and Performance of Bio&#8208;Based Amphoteric Surfactants</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The development of sustainable bio&#8208;based surfactants was explored derived from biomass monosaccharides. Amphoteric, amine&#8208;oxide containing surfactants were prepared through a simple oxidation process. These carbohydrate&#8208;based surfactants showed comparable properties performance to their commercially applied benchmarks. These bio&#8208;based alternatives offered a reduced skin irritation potential rapid biodegradability, increased viscosity, making them good candidates for the formulation of bio&#8208;based personal care products.







Abstract
As the global surfactant market continues to expand, there is an increasing need to develop bio&#8208;based alternatives in the shift towards a circular economy. This study focuses on the synthesis of polar, amphoteric, amine&#8208;oxide surfactants starting from biomass&#8208;derived monosaccharides and demonstrating their potential in various applications. The synthesis involved a reductive amination of the sugars with an alkylamine and formaldehyde followed by oxidation to produce N&#8208;oxide surfactants. These bio&#8208;based surfactants exhibited promising properties, including high solubility, foamability, surface tension reduction, and critical micelle concentration. In particular, N&#8208;GalA1.10 and N&#8208;GalA1.12 showed comparable performance to commercial surfactants. Furthermore, these bio&#8208;based surfactants demonstrated significantly lower skin irritation potential when compared to petrochemical&#8208;derived counterparts like sodium laureth sulfate (SLES), making them potentially suitable for personal care products. The biodegradability assessment revealed that N&#8208;GalA1.12 exhibited good biodegradation, indicating its potential environmental compatibility. In conclusion, this study highlights the potential of bio&#8208;based N&#8208;oxide surfactants derived from monosaccharides as sustainable and skin&#8208;friendly alternatives to traditional amphoteric surfactants, like cocamidopropyl betaine (CAPB).

         <title>Coinage Metal Complexes of a Sterically Encumbered Anionic Pyridylborate</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sterically loaded anionic pyridyl borate ligand has been utilized successfully to stabilize two&#8208;coordinate gold, silver, and copper phosphine complexes and a gold isocyanide complex, and to probe their solid&#8208;state structures, bonding, and spectroscopic features.







Abstract
Sterically loaded, anionic pyridine has been synthesized and utilized successfully in the stabilization of a isoleptic series of coinage metal complexes. The treatment of [4&#8208;(Ph3B)&#8208;2,6&#8208;Trip2Py]K (Trip=2,4,6&#8208;iPr3C6H2) with CuBr(PPh3), AgCl(PPh3) or AuCl(PPh3) (Py=pyridine) afforded the corresponding [4&#8208;(Ph3B)&#8208;2,6&#8208;Trip2Py]M(PPh3) (M=Au, Ag, Cu) complexes, via salt metathesis, as isolable, crystalline solids. Notably, these reactions avoid the facile single electron transfer chemistry reported with the less bulky ligand systems. The X&#8208;ray structures revealed that they are two&#8208;coordinate metal adducts. The M&#8722;N and M&#8722;P bond distances are longest in the silver and shortest in the copper adduct among the three group 11 family members. Computational analysis revealed an interesting stability dependence on steric bulk of the anionic pyridine (i.&#8201;e., pyridyl borate) ligand. A comparison of structures and bonding of [4&#8208;(Ph3B)&#8208;2,6&#8208;Trip2Py]Au(PPh3) to pyridine and m&#8208;terphenyl complexes, {[2,6&#8208;Trip2Py]Au(PPh3)}[SbF6] and [2,6&#8208;Trip2Ph]Au(PPh3) are also provided. The Au(I) isocyanide complex, [4&#8208;(Ph3B)&#8208;2,6&#8208;Trip2Py]Au(CNBut) has been stabilized using the same anionic pyridylborate illustrating that it can support other gold&#8208;ligand moieties as well.

         <title>Bispidine Based Hg(II) 1D Coordination Polymers of Helical Topology: Stability, Selective Adsorption and 1D to 2D Dimensionality Change Via SC&#8208;to&#8208;SC Transformation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two remarkably similar coordination polymers made of bispidine ligand 1 and Hg(II) ions behave in a completely different way as one provides selective adsorption capabilities towards MeOH/CHCl3 mixtures while the other a 1D to 2D dimensionality change in a SC&#8208;to&#8208;SC fashion.







Abstract
Bispidine based Hg(II) coordination polymers of helical topology CP&#8208;MeOH and CP&#8208;EtOH are almost isostructural (they mainly differ for the solvent included in their lattice and by a small % in unit cell parameters) but they differ for everything else: i) their intrinsic stability, ii) their ability to adsorb solvents upon prior evacuation, iii) their accessible structural transformations. In particular, one of the two starting materials, once evacuated, is capable to adsorb methanol from atmospheres containing binary and ternary mixtures of volatile organic compounds (MeOH, CHCl3 and EtOH) under ambient conditions (25&#8201;&#176;C, 1&#8197;atm) and with a marked selectivity. The other one is not, but undergoes a 1D to 2D dimensionality change which can be monitored in&#8197;situ by SC&#8208;XRD through a SC&#8208;to&#8208;SC process.

A colorimetric sensor array based on homochiral metal&#8211;organic&#8208;framework films in Fabry&#8211;P&#233;rot cavities is presented. The sensor read&#8208;out is generated by recording the RGB values with a common smartphone camera, and the data are analyzed with a simple machine&#8208;learning algorithm. In addition to the enantioselective detection of chiral odor molecules, the sensor system enables the discrimination of a large number of commercial perfume scents.

         <title>Multicomponent Synthesis of 3(2H)&#8208;Furanones Initiated by Copper(II)&#8208;Catalyzed Alkyne&#8208;Carbonyl Cross Metathesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The cooperative Lewis&#8208; and Br&#248;nsted acid catalysis makes convergent synthesis of 3(2H)&#8208;furanones through a three&#8208;component coupling of 1,3&#8208;diynes, alkyl glyoxylates and water. Control experiments support that Lewis acid&#8208;catalyzed highly chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208; and stereoselective alkyne&#8208;carbonyl metathesis of 1,3&#8208;diynes and alkyl glyoxylates might be the initial step of this multicomponent annulation. Further chemo&#8208; and regioselective hydration of the alkyne&#8208;carbonyl metathesis product and subsequent oxa&#8208;Michael addition promoted by Br&#248;nsted acid results in the formation of two C&#8208;O bonds of the five&#8208;membered oxygen heterocycle.</dc:description>

         <title>Glyco&#8208;DNA: Enzymatic synthesis of base&#8208;modified and hypermodified DNA displaying up to four different monosaccharide units in the major groove</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A portfolio of six modified 2'&#8208;deoxyribonucleoside triphosphate (dNTP) derivatives derived from 5&#8208;substituted pyrimidine or 7&#8208;substituted 7&#8208;deazapurine bearing different carbohydrate units (d&#8208;glucose, d&#8208;galactose, d&#8208;mannose, l&#8208;fucose, sialic acid and N&#8208;Ac&#8208;d&#8208;galactosamine) tethered through propargyl&#8208;glycoside linker was designed and synthesized via the Sonogashira reactions of halogenated dNTPs with the corresponding propargyl&#8208;glycosides. The nucleotides were found to be good substrates for DNA polymerases in enzymatic primer extension and PCR synthesis of modified and hypermodified DNA displaying up to four different sugars. Proof of concept binding study of sugar&#8208;modified oligonucleotides with concanavalin A showed positive effect of avidity and sugar units count.</dc:description>

         <title>Lewis Acid Catalyzed Cyclopropane Ring&#8208;Opening&#8208;Cyclization Cascade Using Thioureas as a N,N&#8208;bisnucleophile: Synthesis of Bicyclic Furo&#8208;, Pyrano&#8208;, and Pyrrololactams via a Formal [4+1]&#8208;Addition</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fused bicyclic cyclopropanes were converted by Lewis acid&#8208;catalysis with thioureas to furo&#8208;, pyrano, and pyrrolo&#173;lactams with yields of up to 99% and high diastere&#173;oselectivity. The formation of the title compounds, repre&#173;senting a formal [4+1]&#8208;cycloaddition to a donor&#8208;acceptor substituted cyclopropane, follows a cascade reaction involving SN1&#8208;type ring&#8208;opening addition and cyclization. Thiourea, being a cost&#8208;effective and odorless reagent, acts as an N,N&#8208;bis&#8208;nucleophile to generate bicyclic compounds containing an N&#8209;substituted &#947;&#8208;lactam moiety.</dc:description>

The formation of the title compounds, repre&#173;senting a formal [4+1]-cycloaddition to a donor-acceptor substituted cyclopropane, follows a cascade reaction involving SN1-type ring-opening addition and cyclization.
