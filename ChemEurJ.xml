         <title>Effect of Si on the oxidation behaviors of Ti3Al1&#8722;xSixC2 at 1000 &#176;C</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this work, Ti3Al1&#8722;xSixC2 (x = 0, 0.2, 0.4, and 0.6) with Al/Si solid solution structure are synthesized, the effects of Si on their oxidation behaviors at 1000 &#186;C are evaluated. The addition of Si not only contributes to the formation of Ti5Si3 impurity but also affects the composition of the oxide scale. Particularly, incorporation of Si in the TiO2 lattice is demonstrated, which alters the formation energy of the (110) plane in TiO2, thus leading to the preferential growth of Si&#8208;doped TiO2 to dendritic congeries. Moreover, the Si addition is believed to affect mass transportation during the oxidation process, which accelerates the formation of a continuous Al2O3 layer in the oxide scale. With an optimized Si content, the oxidation of Ti3Al1&#8722;xSixC2 is restrained. However, with excess Si content, the continuity of the resulting Al2O3 layer is destroyed, thus the oxidation rate rises again.</dc:description>

         <title>Photoinduced Dehydrogenative Borylation via Dihydrogen Bond Bridged Electron Donor and Acceptor Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Air&#8208;stable amine&#8208; and phosphine&#8208;boranes are discovered as donors to integrate with pyridinium acceptor for generating photoactive electron&#8208;donor&#8208;acceptor (EDA) complexes. Experimental results and DFT calculations suggest a dihydrogen bond bridging the donor and acceptor. Illuminating the EDA complex enables an intramolecular single electron transfer to give boron&#8208;centered radical for dehydrogenative borylation with no need of external photosensitizer and radical initiator. The deprotonation of Wheland&#8208;like radical intermediate rather than its generation is believed to determine the good ortho &#8208;selectivity based on DFT calculations. A variety of &#945;&#8208;borylated pyridine derivatives have been readily synthesized with good functional group tolerance.</dc:description>

         <title>Heteropoly Blue/Carbon Nanotubes Nanocomposites as High&#8208;Performance Photothermal Conversion Materials</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>To realize the direct and full use of the widely distributed solar energy, developing novel materials with superb photothermal conversion capability is essential. Although heteropoly blue has intrinsic outstanding solar absorption and photothermal conversion properties, its spectral absorption in the infrared region is weak. Here, composites of heteropoly blue and carbon nanotubes (HPB/CNTs) are synthesized depending on electrostatic interactions by facile microwave sonication and freeze&#8208;drying. The doped CNTs can dramatically improve the spectral absorption performance of HPB ontology in the infrared region. As a result, the light absorption of the optimized HPB/CNTs (20%) reaches more than 95 % in the range of 200&#8208;2400 nm, showing promising prospects as high&#8208;performance photothermal conversion material in the applications of solar desalination and wastewater treatment.</dc:description>

         <title>Next Generation Copper Mediators for the Efficient Production of 18F&#8208;Labeled Aromatics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Evaluation of a series of Cu(II) complexes revealed several highly efficient mediators for radiofluorination of aryl boronic and stannyl substrates. After optimization of the reaction conditions, their application enabled preparation of seven PET&#8208;tracers in improved radiochemical yields and/or using significantly lower precursor loadings.







Abstract
Cu&#8208;mediated radiofluorination is a versatile tool for the preparation of 18F&#8208;labeled (hetero)aromatics. In this work, we systematically evaluated a series of complexes and identified several generally applicable mediators for highly efficient radiofluorination of aryl boronic and stannyl substrates. Utilization of these mediators in nBuOH/DMI or DMI significantly improved 18F&#8208;labeling yields despite use of lower precursor amounts. Impressively, application of 2.5&#8197;&#956;mol aryl boronic acids was sufficient to achieve 18F&#8208;labeling yields of up to 75&#8201;%. The practicality of the novel mediators was demonstrated by efficient production of five PET&#8208;tracers and transfer of the method to an automated radiosynthesis module. In addition, (S)&#8208;3&#8208;[18F]FPhe and 6&#8208;[18F]FDOPA were prepared in activity yields of 23&#177;1&#8201;% and 30&#177;3&#8201;% using only 2.5&#8197;&#956;mol of the corresponding boronic acid or trimethylstannyl precursor.

         <title>A Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Emitter Investigated by Time&#8208;Resolved Near&#8208;Infrared Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A metal&#8208;free TADF (thermally activated delayed fluorescence) emitter was investigated by time&#8208;resolved near&#8208;infrared spectroscopy. This enabled upper excited states that contribute to spin&#8208;vibronic coupling to be detected.







Abstract
Emitters for organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) based on thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) require small singlet (S1)&#8208;triplet (T1) energy gaps as well as fast intersystem crossing (ISC) transitions. These transitions can be mediated by vibronic mixing with higher excited states Sn and Tn (n=2, 3, 4, &#8230;). For a prototypical TADF emitter consisting of a triarylamine and a dicyanobenzene moiety (TAA&#8208;DCN) it is shown that these higher states can be located energetically by time&#8208;resolved near&#8208;infrared (NIR) spectroscopy.

&lt;p&gt;Emitters for organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) based on thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) require small singlet (S&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;)-triplet (T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) energy gaps as well as fast intersystem crossing (ISC) transitions. These transitions can be mediated by vibronic mixing with higher excited states S&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt; and T&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt; (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;=2, 3, 4, &#8230;). For a prototypical TADF emitter consisting of a triarylamine and a dicyanobenzene moiety (TAA-DCN) it is shown that these higher states can be located energetically by time-resolved near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Activated Single&#8208;Phase Ti4O7 Nanosheets with Efficient Use of Precious Metal for Inspired Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;purity, single&#8208;crystal Ti4O7 nanosheets with a high specific surface area have been synthesized for the first time. Synergy and a strong metal&#8208;support interaction interface between Pt clusters and Ti4O7 were constructed with the assistance of visible light irradiation (650&#8197;nm). Continuous active sites (Ti3+, Pt2+, and Pt0+) for the ORR multielectron process are supplied. The new VI&#8722;Pt/Ti4O7 NSs exhibit excellent ORR activity.







Abstract
The oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is central to modern energy storage and conversion technologies for grids such as fuel cells and electrolyzers, but challenges remain due to the lack of reliable, economic, and durable electrocatalysts. Here, we develop single&#8208;crystal conductive black titanium (Ti4O7) nanosheets (NSs) as a new precious metal carrier based on sacrificial hard templates and ultrasonic&#8208;assisted peeling, and deposit Pt clusters on Ti4O7&#8201; NSs induced by wetness impregnation under the irradiation of visible light (VI; 650&#8197;nm). Pt/Ti4O7&#8201; NSs provide Ti3+, Pt2+, and Pt0+ continuous active sites for the ORR multielectron process, achieving synergy among them. The assistance of visible light not only makes a more uniform and smaller distribution of Pt nanoclusters, but also strengthens the charge transfer, thereby constructing a strong metal&#8208;support interaction interface. VI&#8722;Pt/Ti4O7&#8201; NSs show superior initial oxidation potential and a mass activity of 1.61&#8197;A&#8201;mg&#8722;1Pt at a E1/2=0.91&#8197;V, which is nine times higher than that of commercial Pt/C. This work provides an effective strategy for achieving high&#8208;value applications of titanium sub&#8208;oxides and further explores the enhanced interface in metals TinO2n&#8208;1 by light radiation.

         <title>The Influence of Small Biomolecules, Salts and Buffers on the Molecular Recognition of Amide Naphthotube in Aqueous Solutions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The binding affinities of amide naphthotube to neutral organic molecules in water are not influenced by a majority of small biomolecules, inorganic salts, and PBS and Tris buffers.







Abstract
We found the binding affinities of amide naphthotube to neutral organic molecules in water are not influenced by most of small biomolecules, inorganic salts, and PBS and Tris buffers but are reduced in HEPES buffer through competitive binding. Nevertheless, salts do change the binding affinities of amide naphthotube to charged molecules through a screening effect.

         <title>An Extremely Stable Interprotein Tetrahedral Hg(Cys)4 Core Forms in the Zinc Hook Domain of Rad50 Protein at Physiological pH</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
HgII interacting with a naturally ZnII&#8208;containing Rad50 protein interface yields HgS4 species, the strongest metal&#8211;protein interaction known to date. It also introduces the novel manifestation of HgII mechanism of prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells. Furthermore, the substitution of naturally occurring ZnII possibly has an impact on the quaternary structure and the protein assembly process, thus disrupting the DNA&#8208;repair mechanisms that engage the Mre11&#8211;Rad50 complex. More information can be found in the Research Article by A.&#8197;Kr&#281;&#380;el and co&#8208;workers. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202202738).

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Direct Arylation Polymerization for the Synthesis of Thiophene&#8208;Based Cross&#8208;linked Polymers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An earth&#8208;abundant nickel(II) bipyridine catalyst allows the direct arylation polymerization of non&#8208;activated (poly)thiophenes with (poly)aryl halides leading to a series of 20 highly reticulated, porous and alternating conjugated polymers with yields from 50 to 99&#8201;%.







Abstract
An earth&#8208;abundant nickel(II) bipyridine catalyst, combined with lithium hexamethyldisilazide as base, demonstrates its wide applicability in the direct arylation polymerization of di&#8208; and tri&#8208;thiophene heteroaryls with poly(hetero)aryl halides. With a nickel catalyst loading of 2.5&#8197;mol%, a series of twenty highly cross&#8208;linked organic polymers is obtained in 34 to 99&#8201;% yields. Using mixed polytopic coupling partners allows obtaining alternating and optically active thiophene&#8208;based solids with intrinsic porosity.

         <title>Organocatalyzed Phospha&#8208;Michael Addition: A Highly Efficient Synthesis of Customized Bis(acyl)phosphane Oxide Photoinitiators</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The phospha&#8208;Michael addition of bis(mesitoyl)phosphine to a variety of activated C&#8722;C bonds was investigated. Simple amine bases were employed as catalysts, with tetramethylguanidine showing an outstanding performance and allowing the preparation of bis(acyl)phosphines under very mild conditions in excellent yields and short time. Oxidation of the bis(acyl)phosphines led to bis(acyl)phosphane oxides, a substance class belonging to the most potent photoinitiators.







Abstract
Addition of the P&#8722;H bond in bis(mesitoyl)phosphine, HP(COMes)2 (BAPH), to a wide variety of activated carbon&#8211;carbon double bonds as acceptors was investigated. While this phospha&#8208;Michael addition does not proceed in the absence of an additive or catalyst, excellent results were obtained with stoichiometric basic potassium or caesium salts. Simple amine bases can be employed in catalytic amounts, and tetramethylguanidine (TMG) in particular is an outstanding catalyst that allows the preparation of bis(acyl)phosphines, R&#8722;P(COMes)2, under very mild conditions in excellent yields after only a short time. All phosphines RP(COMes)2 can subsequently be oxidized to the corresponding bis(acyl)phosphane oxides, RPO(COMes)2, a substance class belonging to the most potent photoinitiators for radical polymerizations known to date. Thus, a simple and highly atom economic method has been found that allows the preparation of a broad range of photoinitiators adapted to their specific field of application even on a large scale.

Thus, a simple and highly atom economic method has been found that allows the preparation of a broad range of photoinitiators adapted to their specific field of application even on a large scale.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Enhancing the Resistive Switching Behavior of WORM Memory Devices using D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A Based Ester&#8208;Flanked Quinolines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Donor&#8208;Acceptor systems are highly appreciated in the field of organic memory devices due to their efficient charge transport within the systems. In this work, we have designed and synthesized a D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A system constituting ester&#8208;flanked quinolines and functionalized triarylamines (TAA) through a single&#8208;step cross&#8208;coupling reaction to fabricate memory devices via Write&#8208;Once Read&#8208;Many times (WORM) non&#8208;volatile memory. Structure&#8208;property relationships are reconnoitered for these conjugated D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A systems through a series of UV, fluorescence, XRD, DFT, and memory characterizations. The UV and CV data show efficient charge transfer with intramolecular charge transfer occurring at 407&#8208; 417 nm and a short band gap of 2.56&#8208; 2.65 eV. An enhancement in the resistive switching behavior of the memory devices is observed for the compounds with simple TAA&#8208;quinoline and tert&#8208;butylphenyl substituted TAA and fluorophenyl substituted quinoline due to balanced charge distribution in the compounds. This enhanced switching induces an on/off ratio of 103 by generating a highly ordered arrangement in the thin films. The HOMO, LUMO levels, and the ESP images together estimate a charge transfer and charge trapping as the plausible mechanism for the solution&#8208;processable WORM memory devices. The longer retention time (103 s) and lower threshold voltages (&#8208;1.21 &#8208; &#8208;2.12 V) of the devices makes them intriguing compounds for memory applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Organometallic Pt(II) Photosensitisers that Demonstrate Ligand&#8208;Modulated Triplet&#8208;Triplet Annihilation Energy Upconversion Efficiencies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A series of 2&#8208;phenylquinoxaline ligands have been synthesised that introduce either CF3 or OCF3 electron withdrawing groups at different positions of the phenyl ring. These ligands were investigated as cyclometalating reagents for Pt(II) to give neutral complexes of the form [Pt(C^N)(acac)] (where C^N = cyclometalating ligand; acac = acetyl acetonate). X&#8208;ray crystallographic studies on three examples showed that the complexes adopt an approximate square planar geometry. All examples revealed strong Pt&#8722;Pt linear contacts of 3.2041(6), 3.2199(3) and 3.2586(2) &#197;. The highly coloured complexes display efficient visible absorption at 400&#8208;500 nm (&#949; ~ 5000 M&#8208;1 cm&#8208;1) and orange&#8208;red photoluminescent characteristics (&#955;em = 603&#8208;620 nm; &#934;em &#8804; 37%) which were subtly tuned by the ligand. Triplet emitting character was confirmed via microsecond luminescence lifetimes and the photogeneration of singlet oxygen with quantum efficiencies up to 57%. Each complex was investigated as a photosensitiser for triplet&#8208;triplet annihilation energy upconversion using 9,10&#8208;diphenylanthracene as the annihilator species: a range of good upconversion efficiencies (&#934;UC 5.9&#8208;14.1%) were observed and shown to be strongly influenced by the ligand structure in each case.</dc:description>

         <title>Inhibition of Urease by Hydroquinones: A Structural and Kinetic Study</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 64, November 16, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Getting into a flap: Hydroquinones inhibit urease by covalently binding to the thiol group of &#945;Cys322, a key residue located on a mobile protein flap directly involved in the catalytic mechanism. The inhibition occurs through an irreversible inactivation process that involves a radical&#8208;based autocatalytic mechanism.







Abstract
Hydroquinones are a class of organic compounds abundant in nature that result from the full reduction of the corresponding quinones. Quinones are known to efficiently inhibit urease, a NiII&#8208;containing enzyme that catalyzes the hydrolysis of urea to yield ammonia and carbonate and acts as a virulence factor of several human pathogens, in addition to decreasing the efficiency of soil organic nitrogen fertilization. Here, we report the molecular characterization of the inhibition of urease from Sporosarcina pasteurii (SPU) and Canavalia ensiformis (jack bean, JBU) by 1,4&#8208;hydroquinone (HQ) and its methyl and tert&#8208;butyl derivatives. The 1.63&#8208;&#197; resolution X&#8208;ray crystal structure of the SPU&#8208;HQ complex discloses that HQ covalently binds to the thiol group of &#945;Cys322, a key residue located on a mobile protein flap directly involved in the catalytic mechanism. Inhibition kinetic data obtained for the three compounds on JBU reveals the occurrence of an irreversible inactivation process that involves a radical&#8208;based autocatalytic mechanism.

The sluggish cathode kinetics and degradation of the Li anode result in large voltage hysteresis and low coulombic efficiency for LOBs, but they can be resolved by MOF&#8208;based catalysts and separators. This concept presents an overview of different kinds of MOF&#8208;based catalysts and separators, and discusses perspectives on the development of MOF&#8208;based LOBs.







Abstract
Rechargeable lithium&#8208;oxygen batteries (LOBs) are considered to be the next&#8208;generation energy technology owing to their high theoretical energy density. However, the sluggish cathode kinetics and degradation of Li anodes result in large voltage hysteresis and low coulombic efficiency. Various materials have been applied to promote the electrochemical performance of LOBs. Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) possessing porous structures, open active sites and adjustable pore sizes have been attempted as promising materials for catalysts and separators of LOBs. This concept presents an overview of different MOF&#8208;based catalysts for LOBs, including traditional, conductive, semi&#8208;conductive and soluble MOFs, as well as our recently proposed photo&#8208;involved LOBs. Recent advances in MOF&#8208;based separators to restrain the shuttling of redox mediators between cathodes and anodes and suppress the formation of lithium dendrites are also discussed. Finally, perspectives on the development of MOF&#8208;based LOBs for future research are presented.

         <title>Nonsymmetric [Pt(C^N*N&#8242;^C&#8242;)] Complexes: Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission in the Solid State and in Nanoparticles Tuned by Ligand Structure</title>

Square&#8208;planar PtII complexes with tetradentate nonsymmetric {C^N*N&#8242;^C&#8242;} ligands display aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) in the solid state and in nanoparticles formed upon mixing of their solutions in THF with water. The ability of the complexes to show AIE is determined by the steric and electronic properties of the ligands&#8217; aromatic systems.







Abstract
Five square&#8208;planar [Pt(C^N*N&#8242;^C&#8242;)] complexes (Pt1&#8211;Pt5) with novel nonsymmetric tetradentate ligands (L1&#8211;L5) were synthesized and characterized. Varying the structure of the metalating aromatic systems result in substantial changes in photophysical properties and intermolecular interaction mode of the complexes in solution and in solid state. The complexes are strongly emissive in tetrahydrofuran solution, with the band maxima ranging from 560 to 690&#8197;nm. Three of these complexes (Pt1, Pt2, Pt4) afford nanospecies upon injection of their solution into water, which show aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) with a strong red shift of emission bands. In the solid state, crystalline samples of these complexes demonstrate mechanochromism upon grinding with a bathochromic shift of the emission. DFT and TD&#8208;DFT computational analysis of monomeric Pt1&#8211;Pt5 in solution and model dimeric emitters formed through intermolecular interaction of Pt1, Pt2, Pt4 molecules allowed assignment of observed AIE to the 3MMLCT excited states of Pt&#8208;Pt bonded aggregates of these complexes.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Five square-planar [Pt(C^N*N&#8242;^C&#8242;)] complexes (&lt;b&gt;Pt1&lt;/b&gt;&#8211;&lt;b&gt;Pt5&lt;/b&gt;) with novel nonsymmetric tetradentate ligands (&lt;b&gt;L1&lt;/b&gt;&#8211;&lt;b&gt;L5&lt;/b&gt;) were synthesized and characterized. Varying the structure of the metalating aromatic systems result in substantial changes in photophysical properties and intermolecular interaction mode of the complexes in solution and in solid state. The complexes are strongly emissive in tetrahydrofuran solution, with the band maxima ranging from 560 to 690&#8197;nm. Three of these complexes (&lt;b&gt;Pt1&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;Pt2&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;Pt4&lt;/b&gt;) afford nanospecies upon injection of their solution into water, which show aggregation-induced emission (AIE) with a strong red shift of emission bands. In the solid state, crystalline samples of these complexes demonstrate mechanochromism upon grinding with a bathochromic shift of the emission. DFT and TD-DFT computational analysis of monomeric &lt;b&gt;Pt1&lt;/b&gt;&#8211;&lt;b&gt;Pt5&lt;/b&gt; in solution and model dimeric emitters formed through intermolecular interaction of &lt;b&gt;Pt1&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;Pt2&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;Pt4&lt;/b&gt; molecules allowed assignment of observed AIE to the &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;MMLCT excited states of Pt-Pt bonded aggregates of these complexes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

An azaphosphatrane (AZAP) forms a host:guest 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 complex with the cucurbit[10]uril (CB[10]) macrocycle in water and forces CB[10] to adopt an 8&#8208;shape with AZAP occupying the majority of the cavity. The CB[10] contraction leads to a residual space which favors the co&#8208;inclusion of planar and monocationic co&#8208;guest (CG) molecules, affording heteroternary CB[10]&#8901;AZAP&#8901;CG complexes.







Abstract
The globular and monocationic guest molecule trimethyl&#8208;azaphosphatrane (AZAP, a protonated Verkade superbase) was shown to form a host:guest 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 complex with the cucurbit[10]uril (CB[10]) macrocycle in water. Molecular dynamics calculations showed that CB[10] adopts an 8&#8208;shape with AZAP occupying the majority of the internal space, CB[10] contracting around AZAP and leaving a significant part of the cavity unoccupied. This residual space was used to co&#8208;include planar and monocationic co&#8208;guest (CG) molecules, affording heteroternary CB[10]&#8901;AZAP&#8901;CG complexes potentially opening new perspectives in supramolecular chemistry.

         <title>Isolation of Homo&#8208;/Mixed&#8208;Valence Ag12, Ag29, and Ag8 Clusters Stabilized by Cyclic Alkyl(amino) Carbene&#8208;Anchored Monoanionic Phosphorus Ligand</title>

Silver stableware: We have demonstrated the first syntheses and solid&#8208;state isolation of three unprecedented silver clusters [((cAAC)P)6Ag12Cl3](OTf)3 (1), [((cAAC)P)6Ag29] (2), and [((cAAC)P)4Ag8] (3) by employing cyclic alkyl(amino) carbene (cAAC)&#8208;supported phosphinidenide (cAACP&#8722;) generated in&#8197;situ as the stabilizing ligand from the corresponding phosphaalkene and potassium phosphinidenide, respectively.







Abstract
Silver clusters are attractive candidates for their promising optical properties, and biomedical activities. Herein, we report on the first syntheses and isolation of three homo&#8208;/mixed&#8208;valence silver nanoclusters (NCs) with Ag12Cl3, Ag29, and Ag8 cores [((cAAC)P)6Ag12Cl3](OTf)3 (1), [((cAAC)P)6Ag29] (2), and [((cAAC)P)4Ag8] (3) having three&#8208;/twofold symmetry, employing cyclic alkyl(amino) carbene (cAAC)&#8208;supported phosphinidenide (cAACP&#8722;) as the &#960;&#8208;accepting stabilizing ligand. The average diameters of Ag NCs 1, and 2 are approximately 1.6 to 2&#8197;nm. The redox non&#8208;innocent mono&#8208;atomic phosphorus anions (P&#8722;) anchored with cAAC ligands are generated in&#8197;situ by the reaction of AgOTf with a boryl&#8208;phosphaalkene (cAAC)P&#8722;B(NiPr2)2 through cleavage of the P&#8722;B bond with the help of a triflate anion (OTf&#8722;) as a weak nucleophile. Equivalent number of the (cAAC)P&#8722; anions generated in&#8197;situ are oxidized to produce the corresponding bis&#8208;phosphinidene (cAAC)2P2 leading to the generation of Ag0 ions in solution for the formation of the unprecedented mixed&#8208;valence Ag NC 2. Complex 3 is achieved by treating potassium phosphinidenide cAACPK with AgNTf2. The ligand field and the steric hindrance of the (cAAC)P units play crucial roles in stabilizing complexes 1&#8211;3, further providing a three&#8208; (1, 2)/two&#8208; (3) fold stand. The Ag12Cl3 NC (1) with a tricationic core [AgI12Cl3] was found to be diamagnetic, and fluorescent, emitting green light at 563&#8197;nm when excited at 400&#8197;nm. In contrast, the neutral Ag29 (2) and Ag8 (3) clusters were found to be paramagnetic, and NMR silent showing characteristic EPR signals for Ag0 at room temperature.

         <title>Elucidating the Nature of the External Acid Sites of ZSM&#8208;5 Zeolites Using NMR Probe Molecules</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 64, November 16, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The structure and acid properties of external sites of ZSM&#8208;5&#8201;zeolites, namely terminal SiOH groups, pore&#8208;mouth Br&#248;nsted, and tricoordinated Al&#8208;Lewis acid sites, are elucidated through the interaction of samples of distinct particle size with the NMR probe molecule trimethylphosphine oxide, assisted by computational methods.







Abstract
The identification of acid and nonacid species at the external surface of zeolites remains a major challenge, in contrast to the extensively&#8208;studied internal acid sites. Here, it is shown that the synthesis of zeolite ZSM&#8208;5 samples with distinct particle sizes, combined with solid&#8208;state NMR and computational studies of trimethylphosphine oxide (TMPO) adsorption, provides insight into the chemical species on the external surface of the zeolite crystals. 1H&#8211;31P HETCOR NMR spectra of TMPO&#8208;loaded zeolites exhibit a broad correlation peak at &#948;P &#8764;35&#8211;55&#8197;ppm and &#948;H &#8764;5&#8211;12&#8197;ppm assigned to external SiOH species. Pore&#8208;mouth Br&#248;nsted acid sites exhibit 31P and 1H NMR resonances and adsorption energies close to those reported for internal acid sites interacting with TMPO. The presence of an external tricoordinate Al&#8208;Lewis site interacting strongly with TMPO is suggested, resulting in 31P resonances that overlap with the peaks usually ascribed to the interaction of TMPO with Br&#248;nsted sites.

         <title>Electrical&#8208;Conductive/Insulating Bi&#8208;Functional Layers for Stable Zn Metal Anode</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 64, November 16, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Zinc&#8208;ion batteries: A strategy of electrical&#8208;conductive/insulating bi&#8208;functional layers is proposed to reduce local current density and the difference of Zn metal surface concentration, avoiding direct contact between electrolyte and electrode, and alleviating crazy dendrite growth by coordinating the functions of different coating domains. This strategy is expected to provide a design concept and reference for the realization of dendrite&#8208;free ZIBs.







Abstract
Zinc&#8208;ion batteries are regarded as an extremely promising candidate for large&#8208;scale energy storage equipment due to the inexpensive ingredients and high safety. However, dendrite growth and side reactions occur in the Zn anode, which lead to exceedingly low coulombic efficiency (CE) and poor cycling stability. In this work, we propose a strategy of a conductive/insulating bi&#8208;functional coating layer (CIBL) for stable Zn metal anodes. Porous Ag nanowires (NWs) coating as a conductive layer effectively reduces the nuclear barrier and contains Zn2+ deposition in a certain space. Polyimide (PI) coatings as insulating layer implement a shunting effect on Zn2+, which could reduce the differential concentration on the Zn surface and induce uniform deposition of Zn2+. Therefore, the CIBL&#8722;Zn//CIBL&#8722;Zn battery achieves stable plating/stripping of over 1300&#8197;h at 1&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. The CE of CIBL&#8722;Zn//CIBL&#8722;Zn battery maintains at 99.2&#8201;% even after 1000 cycles. Moreover, the CIBL&#8722;Zn//V2O5 battery exhibits a capacity of nearly 289.2&#8197;mA&#8201;h&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 5&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 3000 cycles and no sign of capacity degradation is found, which further demonstrate the feasibility of this strategy in practical application.

         <title>Plasma&#8208;Assisted Coupling Reactions of Dinitrogen and Carbon Dioxide Mediated by Monometallic YB1&#8211;4&#8722;&#8901;Anions: Carbon&#8722;Nitrogen Bond Formation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 64, November 16, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The monometallic YB1&#8211;4&#8722; anions mediated C&#8722;N coupling reactions with inert N2 and CO2 under plasma conditions have been reported. Anionic products NCNBO&#8722; and N(BO)2&#8722; were generated, accompanied by the production of neutral products of YO and YB0&#8211;2NC. This strategy may provide a new approach to realize the N2 and CO2 coupling reactions at room temperature.







Abstract
Transition&#8208;metal catalyzed coupling to form C&#8722;N bonds is significant in chemical science. However, the inert nature of N2 and CO2 renders their coupling quite challenging. Herein, we report the activation of dinitrogen in the mild plasma atmosphere by the gas&#8208;phase monometallic YB1&#8211;4&#8722; anions and further coupling of CO2 to form C&#8722;N bonds by using mass spectrometry and theoretical calculation. The observed product anions are NCNBO&#8722; and N(BO)2&#8722;, accompanied by the formation of neutral products YO and YB0&#8211;2NC, respectively. We can tune the reactivity and the type of products by manipulating the number of B atoms. The B atoms in YB1&#8211;4N2&#8722; act as electron donors in CO2 reduction reactions, and the carbon atom originating from CO2 serves as an electron reservoir. This is the first example of gas&#8208;phase monometallic anions, which are capable to realize the functionalization of N2 with CO2 through C&#8722;N bond formation and N&#8722;N and C&#8722;O bond cleavage.

         <title>Substituted Cyclopentannulated Tetraazapentacenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 64, November 16, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The introduction of bromine substituents into cyclopentannulated tetraazapentacenes allows post&#8208;functionalization, for example through Sonogashira coupling and Rosenmund&#8208;von Braun reaction. The altered properties of the resulting new compounds were examined by experimental and computational methods, and the potential use as organic field&#8208;effect transistors was demonstrated.







Abstract
Brominated pentannulated dihydrotetraazapentacenes were prepared by gold&#8208; or palladium&#8208;catalyzed 5&#8208;endo&#8208;dig cyclization of TIPS&#8208;ethynylated dihydrotetraazaacenes (TIPS = triisopropylsilyl). Post&#8208;functionalization was demonstrated by Sonogashira alkynylation and Rosenmund&#8208;von Braun cyanation. Calculations predict these species to act as n&#8208;type semiconductors, which was verified for two derivates through characterization in organic field&#8208;effect transistors.

         <title>Polymerization, Stimuli&#8208;induced Depolymerization, and Precipitation&#8208;driven Macrocyclization in a Nitroaldol Reaction System
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 64, November 16, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dynamic covalent nitroaldol polymers of different topology is presented. Linear dynamers were generally produced, from which specific macrocycles were formed through depolymerization, driven by precipitation. The dynamers showed a clear adaptive behavior, displaying depolymerization and rearrangement of the dynamer chains in response to alternative building blocks as external stimuli.







Abstract

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Dynamic covalent&lt;/b&gt; nitroaldol polymers of different topology is presented. Linear dynamers were generally produced, from which specific macrocycles were formed through depolymerization, driven by precipitation. The dynamers showed a clear adaptive behavior, displaying depolymerization and rearrangement of the dynamer chains in response to alternative building blocks as external stimuli.

         <title>Dual MOF&#8208;Derived MoS2/CdS Photocatalysts with Rich Sulfur Vacancies for Efficient Hydrogen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 64, November 16, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dual MOF&#8208;derived MoS2/CdS photocatalyst with abundant sulfur vacancies was synthesized by in&#8197;situ growth of CdS nanoparticles on 2D MoS2. Because of the existence of both 1T phase and sulfur vacancies, MoS2/CdS not only shows strong charge transport ability, but also possesses prolonged photoelectron lifetime. The 1&#8201;%MoS2/CdS exhibited 27 times higher hydrogen generation activity than pristine CdS.







Abstract
Cocatalyst plays an important role in efficient charge transfer and separation for photocatalysis. Herein, a MoS2/CdS photocatalyst with MoS2 as cocatalyst was designed by using Mo&#8208;MOF and Cd&#8208;MOF as precursors. Due to the existence of rich sulfur vacancies and 1T phase, MoS2 shows strong charge capture and transport ability. The photo&#8208;generated electrons on conduction band (CB) can be bound by the sulfur vacancy of CdS and effectively transported to MoS2 through the compact interface between the CdS nanoparticles and 2D large&#8208;scale MoS2. The optimal photocatalyst 1&#8201;%MoS2/CdS exhibited dramatically improved photocatalytic hydrogen production activity, which is 28 times that of pristine CdS and even about 2 times that of 1&#8201;%Pt/CdS with same loading amount of noble metal Pt. This work highlights the role of Mo&#8208;MOF derived MoS2 with 1T&#8208;2H phases as a sustainable and prospective candidate of cocatalyst for improving charge separation and photocatalytic stability of MoS2/CdS composites.

         <title>A Quick and Reproducible Silanization Method by Using Plasma Activation for Hydrophobicity&#8208;Based Kinesin Single Molecule Fluorescence&#8211;Microscopy Assays</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 64, November 16, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Strength in weakness: Weakly hydrophobic, plasma&#8208;activated surfaces silanized with a disilazane turned out to be optimal for single&#8208;molecule fluorescence measurements of biological molecular machines. The novel silanization assay reduced the work load more than tenfold and does not require any organic solvents, thus making the assay environmentally friendly and efficient.







Abstract
Single&#8208;molecule assays often require functionalized surfaces. One approach for microtubule assays renders surfaces hydrophobic and uses amphiphilic blocking agents. However, the optimal hydrophobicity is unclear, protocols take long, produce toxic waste, and are susceptible to failure. Our method uses plasma activation with hydrocarbons for hexamethyldisilazane (HMDS) silanization in the gas phase. We measured the surface hydrophobicity, its effect on how well microtubule filaments were bound to the surface, and the number of nonspecific interactions with kinesin motor proteins. Additionally, we tested and discuss the use of different silanes and activation methods. We found that even weakly hydrophobic surfaces were optimal. Our environmentally friendly method significanty reduced the overall preparation effort and resulted in reproducible, high&#8208;quality surfaces with low variability. We expect the method to be applicable to a wide range of other single&#8208;molecule assays.

         <title>Tetrahalidometallate(II) Ionic Liquids with More than One Metal: The Effect of Bromide versus Chloride</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 64, November 16, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A question of halide: Transition metal&#8208;based ionic liquids (ILs) are promising candidates for electrochemical energy. Bromide&#8208;based ILs are particularly interesting for their high electrochemical stability, although their conductivities are significantly lower than those of their chloride analogues. [MBr4]2&#8722; units are therefore highly promising building blocks for advanced electrochemically active ILs.







Abstract
Fifteen N&#8208;butylpyridinium salts &#8211; five monometallic [C4Py]2[MBr4] and ten bimetallic [C4Py]2[M0.5aM0.5bBr4] (M=Co, Cu, Mn, Ni, Zn) &#8211; were synthesized, and their structures and thermal and electrochemical properties were studied. All the compounds are ionic liquids (ILs) with melting points between 64 and 101&#8201;&#176;C. Powder and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction show that all ILs are isostructural. The electrochemical stability windows of the ILs are between 2 and 3&#8197;V. The conductivities at room temperature are between 10&#8722;5 and 10&#8722;6&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1. At elevated temperatures, the conductivities reach up to 10&#8722;4&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 70&#8201;&#176;C. The structures and properties of the current bromide&#8208;based ILs were also compared with those of previous examples using chloride ligands, which illustrated differences and similarities between the two groups of ILs.

         <title>Single&#8208;Metal&#8208;Encapsulated Double&#8208;Cage [Pt@Sn17]4&#8722;: An Exception from Group 14 Endohedral Clusters</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 64, November 16, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Asymmetrical fusion of two inhomogeneous building units [Pt@Sn9] and [Sn9] leads to the largest group&#8197;14 intermetalloid cluster [Pt@Sn17]4&#8722; encapsulating a single transition metal atom. The unusual double&#8208;cage structure could be seen as a result of the collapse of the capsule&#8208;like Sn17 framework when filled with only one Pt atom.







Abstract
Group&#8197;14 endohedral clusters containing a metal center inside usually possess a single cage topological structure, but here an unexpected single&#8208;metal&#8208;filled double&#8208;cage cluster, [Pt@Sn17]4&#8722; (1&#8201;a) is reported. It can be seen as a combination of the more extended Pt&#8208;filled [Pt@Sn9] cage and hollow [Sn9] cage sharing a central Sn atom, which is offset from the central position. This double&#8208;cage species represents the largest group&#8197;14 intermetalloid cluster encapsulating a single transition metal atom. DFT calculations show that the capsule&#8208;like architecture of [Sn17]4&#8722;, similar to that found in [Pt2@Sn17]4&#8722;, is unstable if filled with a single Pt atom and collapses to the title cluster 1&#8201;a upon geometry optimization. Deviation of the central Sn atom occurs due to the vibronic coupling as a consequence of pseudo&#8208;Jahn&#8208;Teller distortion leading to the bent Cs&#8208;symmetrical structure, in contrast to the more symmetrical D2d cage previously reported in [Ni2@Sn17]4&#8722;.

&lt;p&gt;Group&#8197;14 endohedral clusters containing a metal center inside usually possess a single cage topological structure, but here an unexpected single-metal-filled double-cage cluster, [Pt@Sn&lt;sub&gt;17&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;4&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; (&lt;b&gt;1&#8201;a&lt;/b&gt;) is reported. It can be seen as a combination of the more extended Pt-filled [Pt@Sn&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt;] cage and hollow [Sn&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt;] cage sharing a central Sn atom, which is offset from the central position. This double-cage species represents the largest group&#8197;14 intermetalloid cluster encapsulating a single transition metal atom. DFT calculations show that the capsule-like architecture of [Sn&lt;sub&gt;17&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;4&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;, similar to that found in [Pt&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;@Sn&lt;sub&gt;17&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;4&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;, is unstable if filled with a single Pt atom and collapses to the title cluster &lt;b&gt;1&#8201;a&lt;/b&gt; upon geometry optimization. Deviation of the central Sn atom occurs due to the vibronic coupling as a consequence of pseudo-Jahn-Teller distortion leading to the bent &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;-symmetrical structure, in contrast to the more symmetrical &lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;2d&lt;/sub&gt; cage previously reported in [Ni&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;@Sn&lt;sub&gt;17&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;4&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Spontaneous Synthesis of [FeII(Atrz)3]SO4 and its Analogues Through Accelerated Ageing: New Insights from Small&#8208;Scale Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 64, November 16, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Accelerated ageing can be used to synthesize functional materials including spin crossover systems. Reactions proceed between a metal salt and a ligand placed in contact in a humid environment without any solvent or applied energy. Optical microscopy of small&#8208;scale reactions can be used to derive mechanistic information about accelerated ageing.







Abstract
Accelerated ageing reactions that take place between two solid materials on contact in the absence of added solvent have been used to synthesize two spin&#8208;crossover&#8208;active 1D coordination polymers and one of their Cu(II) analogues. The hygroscopy of the ligands and the relative humidity of the reaction chamber have been shown to be particularly important factors in the rate of reaction. Small&#8208;scale reactions between a few individual crystals have allowed observation of deliquescence of the 4&#8208;aminotriazole ligand at high humidity. The metal salt does not dissolve, and the ligand diffuses into the crystal of the metal salt during the reaction. In the case of the Cu analogue, the formation of the product causes the crystal of the metal salt to deform with the formation of pseudocrystals, which have a fibrous structure.

         <title>Cu3(HHTP)2 c&#8208;MOF/ZnO Ultrafast Ultraviolet Photodetector for Wearable Optoelectronics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 64, November 16, 2022. </description>

Wearable ultraviolet photodetector based on 2D c&#8208;MOF Cu3(HHTP)2/ZnO type&#8208;II heterojunction is fabricated by Layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer (LbL) deposition. At optimized MOF layer cycles, the photodetector shows superior photoresponse and outstanding mechanical durability.







Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional conductive metal&#8211;organic frameworks (2D c&#8208;MOFs) are a family of highly tunable and electrically conducting materials that can be utilized in optoelectronics. A major issue of 2D c&#8208;MOFs for photodetection is their poor charge separation and recombination dynamics upon illumination. This study demonstrates a Cu3(HHTP)2/ZnO type&#8208;II heterojunction ultraviolet (UV) photodetector fabricated by layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer (LbL) deposition, in which the charge separation of photogenerated carriers is enhanced. At optimized MOF layer cycles, the device achieves a responsivity of 78.2&#8197;A/W and detectivity of 3.8&#215;109 Jones at 1&#8197;V. Particularly, the device can be operated in the self&#8208;powered mode with an ultrafast response time of 70&#8197;&#956;s, which is the record value for MOF&#8208;based photodetectors. In addition, even after 1000&#8208;time bending of 180&#176;, the flexible device maintains stable performance. This flexible MOF&#8208;based UV photodetector with anti&#8208;fatigue and anti&#8208;bending properties provides strong implication to wearable optoelectronics.

         <title>Electrochemically Determining Electronic Structure of ZnO Quantum Dots with Different Surface Ligands</title>

Cyclic voltammetry (CV) is employed to determine the band edges and trap states of ZnO QDs with different surface ligands. It is demonstrated that the ZnO QDs without surface ligands mainly have oxygen interstitial defects whilst the ZnO QDs covered with ligands contain oxygen vacancies.







Abstract
The electronic structure of quantum dots (QDs) including band edges and possible trap states is an important physical property for optoelectronic applications. The reliable determination of the energy levels of QDs remains a big challenge. Herein we employ cyclic voltammetry (CV) to determine the energy levels of three types of ZnO QDs with different surface ligands. Coupled with spectroscopic techniques, it is found that the onset potential of the first reductive wave is likely related to the conduction band edges while the first oxidative wave originates from the trap states. The determined specific energy levels in CV further demonstrates that the ZnO QDs without surface ligands mainly have oxygen interstitial defects whilst the ZnO QDs covered with ligands contain oxygen vacancies. The present electrochemical method offers a powerful and effective way to determine the energy levels of wide bandgap ZnO QDs, which will boost their device performance.

         <title>Directed Palladium Catalyzed C&#8722;H (Ethoxycarbonyl)difluoromethylthiolation Reactions</title>

         <dc:description>
The unprecedented construction of a C(sp2)&#8208;SCF2CO2Et bond was successfully achieved by Pd&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H bond activation. This robust protocol allowed the functionalization of a broad panel of aromatic and olefinic derivatives (37&#8197;examples, up to 87&#8201;% yield), a real advance as existing routes were restricted to the SCF3 and SCF2H residues. Post&#8208;functionalization reactions further illustrated the synthetic value of this fluorinated motif.







Abstract
The unprecedented Pd&#8208;catalyzed (ethoxycarbonyl)difluoromethylthiolation reaction of various unsaturated derivatives was studied. In the presence of the (ethoxycarbonyl)difluoromethylsulfenamide reagent I and under mild reaction conditions (60&#8201;&#176;C), both 2&#8208;(hetero)aryl and 2&#8208;(&#945;&#8208;aryl&#8208;vinyl)pyridine derivatives were smoothly functionalized with this methodology (37 examples, up to 87&#8201;% yield). Moreover, the synthetic interest of this fluorinated moiety was further showcased by its conversion into various original fluorinated residues. Finally, a plausible mechanism for this transformation was suggested.

Assembling simple functional groups by proline organocatalysis coupled with the addition of BF3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;OEt2 in the same flask allows for the mild formation of aza&#8208;ortho&#8208;quinone methide species that undergo nucleophilic addition to give access to enantio&#8208;enriched tri&#8208;substituted tetrahydroquinolines with a novel configuration. This advanced three&#8208;dimensional structure, after only two additional steps, gave rise to a valuable enantiopure and selective anti&#8208;inflammatory compound.







Abstract
The pharmaceutical industry has a pervasive need for chiral specific molecules with optimal affinity for their biological targets. However, the mass production of such compounds is currently limited by conventional chemical routes, that are costly and have an environmental impact. Here, we propose an easy access to obtain new tetrahydroquinolines, a motif found in many bioactive compounds, that is rapid and cost effective. Starting from simple raw materials, the procedure uses a proline&#8208;catalyzed Mannich reaction followed by the addition of BF3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;OEt2, which generates a highly electrophilic aza&#8208;ortho&#8208;quinone methide intermediate capable of reacting with different nucleophiles to form the diversely functionalized tetrahydroquinoline. Moreover, this enantioselective one&#8208;pot process provides access for the first time to tetrahydroquinolines with a cis&#8208;2,3 and trans&#8208;3,4 configuration. As proof of concept, we demonstrate that a three&#8208;step reaction sequence, from simple and inexpensive starting compounds and catalysts, can generate a BD2&#8208;selective BET bromodomain inhibitor with anti&#8208;inflammatory effect.

         <title>Charge&#8208;Transfer Transitions Govern the Reactivity and Photophysics of Vicinally Diphosphanyl&#8208;Substituted Diborapentacenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 64, November 16, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nucleophilic aromatic substitution reaction provides facile access to the ambipolar dihydrodiborapentacene P with two vicinal Ph2P substituents. Irradiation with visible light leads to a pronounced P&#8208;to&#8208;B charge transfer, which impacts the optoelectronic properties and reactivity of P and can in turn be modulated by Ph2P oxidation or transition&#8208;metal coordination.







Abstract
2,3&#8208;Difluoro&#8208;5,14&#8208;dihydro&#8208;5,14&#8208;diborapentacene (DBP) was endowed with two vicinal Ph2P groups by an SNAr reaction at both CF sites using Ph2PSiMe3. Computations reveal the ambipolar product P to undergo P&#8208;to&#8208;B charge transfer under ambient light irradiation. Consequently, P is prone to photooxidation by air, yielding the Ph2P(O) species PO. With S8 or [Me3O][BF4], P furnishes the Ph2P(S) or Ph2P(Me)+ derivatives PS or [PMe][BF4]2. Along the series P, PO, PS, and [PMe][BF4]2, the redox potentials shift anodically from E1/2=&#8722;1.89&#8197;V to &#8722;1.02&#8197;V (CH2Cl2). Thus, derivatization of the Ph2P group allows late&#8208;stage modulation of the LUMO&#8208;energy level of the DBP. Derivatization also influences the emission properties of the compounds, as PO shows green (521&#8197;nm) and [PMe][BF4]2 red (622&#8197;nm) fluorescence in C6H6, while P and PS are dark. With CuBr and AgBr, P forms dimeric [M(&#956;&#8208;Br)]2 complexes [PCu]2 and [PAg]2, which show pronounced metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge transfer (MLCT), making P a promising ligand for photocatalysts.

Cyclic alkyl(amino) carbene&#8208;anchored monoanionic phosphorus species have been introduced as the rising ligand to stabilize three unprecedented homo (AgI)&#8208; and mixed (Ag0/AgI)&#8208;valence silver nanoclusters Ag29, Ag12 and Ag8 in the solid state with defined structures. The neutral Ag29 and Ag8 clusters showed electron paramagnetic resonance at room temperature, whereas the green&#8208;emitting tri&#8208;cationic Ag12 cluster is diamagnetic and NMR active. More information can be found in the Research Article by S. Roy and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202202324).

Carbon dioxide, the most widely distributed carbon source in Nature, has been widely investigated for its reduction and reuse. In this field, nanometallic materials have been widely studied because of their excellent photo/electrocatalytic activity. As one of the nanometallic materials, metal aerogel has the unique advantages of high&#8208;electron transfer rate and large specific surface area, as well as rich pore space and strong adsorption performance, which makes it a highly researched material for catalytic CO2 reduction in recent years. Herein, we report for the first time, the latest preparation methods of metal aerogels and the recent progress in electrocatalytic CO2 reduction. After that, the properties of several typical metallic aerogels and their latest applications in electrocatalytic CO2 reduction are described. Finally, the vision and research directions for the future industrialization of metal aerogels for electrocatalytic CO2 reduction are proposed from the perspective of practical applications (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202201834)

An experimentalist removes one Pt atom from the capsule&#8208;like [Pt2@Sn17]4&#8722; cluster lying on the conveyor that drags it through the computational frame. This deciphers an immediate transformation of the capsule&#8208;like architecture to the singly encapsulated double&#8208;cage structure in the reported [Pt@Sn17]4&#8722; cluster that arises due to the insufficient support of the inner metal atom and electron deficiency of the Ge framework. More information can be found in the Research Article by I.&#8197;A. Popov, Z.&#8208;M. Sun, and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202202651).

         <dc:description>
Square&#8208;planar [Pt(C^N*N&#8242;^C&#8242;)] complexes bearing novel nonsymmetric tetradentate ligands display strong green&#8208;yellow emission in their monomeric form in tetrahydrofuran solution. Mixing the THF solutions with water results in aggregation of the complexes to afford nanospecies with clearly visible aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) that shifts the luminescent bands to the near infrared due to a metallophilic interaction between the starting molecular chromophores. More information can be found in the Research Article by S.&#8197;P. Tunik and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202202207).

Methane (CH4) is a potent greenhouse gas and the second highest contributor to global warming. Developing large&#8208;scale methane removal methods is one of the most effective strategies to reduce rapidly the CH4 emissions and thus to limit global warming. Challenges and prospects of solar&#8208;driven gas phase advanced oxidation processes for CH4 removal are analyzed.







Abstract
Methane (CH4) is a potent greenhouse gas and the second highest contributor to global warming. CH4 emissions are still growing at an alarmingly high pace. To limit global warming to 1.5&#8201;&#176;C, one of the most effective strategies is to reduce rapidly the CH4 emissions by developing large&#8208;scale methane removal methods. The purpose of this perspective paper is threefold. (1) To highlight the technology gap dealing with low concentration CH4 (at many emission sources and in the atmosphere). (2) To analyze the challenges and prospects of solar&#8208;driven gas phase advanced oxidation processes for CH4 removal. And (3) to propose some ideas, which may help to develop solar&#8208;driven gas phase advanced oxidation processes and make them deployable at a climate significant scale.

         <title>Interplay between hydrogen bonding and electron transfer in mixed valence assemblies of triarylamine trisamides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hydrogen&#8208;bonding interactions are assumed to play a critical role in the long&#8208;range transport of light or charge recently observed in supramolecular assemblies of C3&#8208;symmetrical discotic molecules. Herein, the structure of mixed valence assemblies formed by irradiating triarylamine trisamide (TATA) molecules was determined by multifarious techniques under various conditions with the aim of probing the interplay between the hydrogen bonding network and the rate of electron transport in different states (solution, gel, film). Irradiation was performed under initial states that vary by the degree of association of TATA monomers through hydrogen bonds. Firstly, a significant shift of the N&#9472;H and C=O stretching frequencies was observed by FT&#8208;IR upon irradiation thus revealing an overlooked signature of TATA&#8226;+ species and interacting mixed valence aggregates. Secondly, gels and films both mostly consist of hydrogen&#8208;bonded TATA polymers but their EPR spectra recorded at 293 K reveal very different behaviors: localized electrons in the gels versus fully delocalized electrons in the films. Hydrogen bonding thus appears as a necessary but not sufficient condition to get fast electron transfer rates and a packing of the TATA monomers particularly suitable for charge transport is assumed to exist in the solid state. Finally, defects in the hydrogen bonding network are detected upon increasing the number of radical species in the mixed valence assemblies present in the film state without impeding the delocalization of the unpaired electrons. A delicate balance between hydrogen bonds and packing is thus necessary to get supramolecular polarons in mixed valence TATA assemblies.</dc:description>

         <title>Caging of a Strongly Pairing Fluorescent Thymidine Analog with Soft Nucleophiles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Controlling the pairing strength of nucleobases in DNA through reactions with compounds found inside the cell is a formidable challenge. Here we report how a thiazolyl substituent turns a strongly pairing ethynylpyridone C&#8208;nucleoside into a reactive residue in oligonucleotides. The thiazolyl&#8208;bearing pyridone reacts with soft nucleophiles, such as glutathione, but not with hard nucleophiles like hydroxide or carbonate. The addition products pair much more weakly with adenine in a complementary strand than the starting material, and also change their fluorescence. This makes oligonucleotides containing the new deoxynucleoside interesting for controlled release. Due to its reactivity toward N, P, S, and Se&#8208;nucleophiles, and the visual signal accompanying chemical conversion, the fluorescent nucleotide reported here may also have applications in chemical biology, sensing and diagnostics.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>5&#8208;Diethylboryl&#8208;2,3&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine (1), which is inaccessible using conventional batch methods, was synthesized using a flow microreactor. Compound 1 was obtained as an equilibrium mixture of a cyclic trimer and a cyclic tetramer in solution, the latter of which was crystallized in benzene by vapor diffusion of hexane at 7 &#176;C. The dynamic nature of this system was confirmed by solvent&#8208; and concentration&#8208;dependent experiments. Notably, the dynamics was verified using flow NMR spectroscopy, which revealed that the time required to reach equilibrium was influenced by the solvent ratio (&lt;18 s, 24&#8211;28 s, and 34&#8211;42 s in 2:1, 1:1, and 1:2 mixtures of acetone&#8208;d6 and C6D6, respectively). Compound 1 and 3&#8208;[4&#8242;&#8208;(diethylboryl)phenyl]pyridine (2) exhibited different self&#8208;assembly behavior in solution and crystals. Density functional theory calculations suggested that this difference was largely due to enhanced planarity between two consecutive aromatic rings.</dc:description>

         <title>Photoinduced Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Carbon&#8211;Heteroatom Coupling
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Exogenous photocatalyst&#8208;free, single nickel&#8208;catalyzed carbon&#8211;heteroatom coupling under visible&#8208;light irradiation is reported. Over 15&#8197;classes of nucleophile can efficiently couple with aryl/alkene halides to afford valuable heteroatomic arenes/alkenes. The unprecedentedly broad substrate scope and late&#8208;stage modification of valuable molecules fully demonstrate the benefits of the method.







Abstract
Herein, we report visible light&#8208;promoted single nickel catalysis for diverse carbon&#8211;heteroatom couplings under mild conditions. This mild, general, and robust method to couple diverse nitrogen, oxygen, and sulfur nucleophiles with aryl(heteroaryl)/alkenyl iodides/bromides exhibits a wide functional group tolerance and is applicable to late&#8208;stage modification of pharmaceuticals and natural products. On the base of preliminary mechanistic studies, a NiI/NiIII cycle via the generation of active NiI complexes that appear from homolysis of NiII&#8722;I rather than NiII&#8722;aryl bond was tentatively proposed.

         <title>Recent Progress in Rechargeable Sodium Metal Batteries: A Review</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
High energy density and long lifespan sodium metal batteries. In this review, recent progress in high energy density and long lifespan SMBs is summarized from the aspects of modification of the sodium metal anode, electrolyte exploration, and cathode design. In addition, some insights toward their practical applications are introduced.







Abstract
Sodium metal batteries (SMBs) have been widely studied owing to their relatively high energy density and abundant resources. However, they still need systematic improvement to fulfill the harsh operating conditions for their commercialization. In this review, we summarize the recent progress in SMBs in terms of sodium anode modification, electrolyte exploration, and cathode design. Firstly, we give an overview of the current challenges facing Na metal anodes and the corresponding solutions. Then, the traditional liquid electrolytes and the prospective solid electrolytes for SMBs are summarized. In addition, insertion&#8208; and conversion&#8208;type cathode materials are introduced. Finally, an outlook for the future of practical SMBs is provided.

The unusual solid&#8208;state transformation of Na4SnS4&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;14H2O into Na4Sn2S6&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;5H2O at ambient conditions is elucidated on the molecular level by combined in&#8197;situ and ex situ experiments supported by theoretical calculations.







Abstract
A highly unusual solid&#8208;state epitaxy&#8208;induced phase transformation of Na4SnS4&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;14H2O (I) into Na4Sn2S6&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;5H2O (II) occurs at room temperature. Ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations indicate an internal acid&#8208;base reaction to form [SnS3SH]3&#8722; which condensates to [Sn2S6]4&#8722;. The reaction involves a complex sequence of O&#8722;H bond cleavage, S2&#8722; protonation, Sn&#8722;S bond formation and diffusion of various species while preserving the crystal morphology. In&#8197;situ Raman and IR spectroscopy evidence the formation of [Sn2S6]4&#8722;. DFT calculations allowed assignment of all bands appearing during the transformation. X&#8208;ray diffraction and in&#8197;situ 1H&#8197;NMR demonstrate a transformation within several days and yield a reaction turnover of &#8776;0.38&#8201;%/h.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A highly unusual solid-state epitaxy-induced phase transformation of Na&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;SnS&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;14H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O (&lt;b&gt;I&lt;/b&gt;) into Na&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;Sn&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;5H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O (&lt;b&gt;II&lt;/b&gt;) occurs at room temperature. Ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations indicate an internal acid-base reaction to form [SnS&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;SH]&lt;sup&gt;3&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; which condensates to [Sn&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;4&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;. The reaction involves a complex sequence of O&#8722;H bond cleavage, S&lt;sup&gt;2&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; protonation, Sn&#8722;S bond formation and diffusion of various species while preserving the crystal morphology. In&#8197;situ Raman and IR spectroscopy evidence the formation of [Sn&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;4&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;. DFT calculations allowed assignment of all bands appearing during the transformation. X-ray diffraction and in&#8197;situ &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H&#8197;NMR demonstrate a transformation within several days and yield a reaction turnover of &#8776;0.38&#8201;%/h.

         <title>Chiral Naphthalenediimides with High&#8208;Efficiency Fluorescence and Circularly Polarized Luminescence in the Solid State for the Application in Organic Optoelectronics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chiral non&#8208;core substituted naphthalenediimides (NDIs) exhibit an L&#8208;shape conformation and self&#8208;assemble into discrete dimers in the solid state. The unique discrete dimeric stacking significantly promoted the fluorescence quantum yields and chiroptical properties via the formation of pre&#8208;associated excimers. The findings disrupt the general idea that non&#8208;core substituted NDIs cannot exhibit strong fluorescence in the solid state.







Abstract
Naphthalenediimides (NDIs) have been extensively studied due to their tunable luminescent properties. However, generally, the monomers or aggregates of non&#8208;core substituted NDIs exhibit low fluorescence quantum yields (&#934;FL&lt;10&#8201;%) in the solid state, which limit their applications as light&#8208;emitting materials and render their chiral species unsuitable for circularly polarized luminescence (CPL). Herein, a series of non&#8208;core substituted chiral NDIs that exhibit high luminous efficiencies (&#934;FL up to 56.8&#8201;% for racemate and 36.5&#8201;% for enantiomer) and a strong CPL behavior in the solid state is reported. These significant improvements are attributed to the unique molecular conformation of the chiral NDIs and the formation of distinctive discrete dimers. The structures of the NDIs were significantly simpler and more accessible than those of other NDIs. The findings evidence that non&#8208;core substituted NDIs can exhibit strong fluorescence in the solid state and provide a new pathway to improve photophysical properties of NDIs.

         <title>Isolation and Reactivity of Stannylenoids Stabilized by Amido/Imino Ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel stannylenoid was isolated by using a bulky amido ligand. It can be converted to the dimeric chlorostannylene at 80&#8201;&#176;C with the elimination of LiCl. Treatment of the amidostannylenoid with IPrNLi (IPrN=bis(2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl)imidazolin&#8208;2&#8208;iminato) led to the formation of amido(imino)stannylene. In addition, the reaction of bis(imino)stannylenoid with N2O resulted in a dimeric Sn/O/Li complex.







Abstract
The reaction of the lithium aryl(silyl)amide Dipp(iPr3Si)NLi (Dipp=2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3) with one equivalent of SnCl2 in THF gave a novel stannylenoid Dipp(iPr3Si)NSnCl&#8901;LiCl(THF)2. Heating the solution of amidostannylenoid in toluene to 80&#8201;&#176;C resulted in dimeric amido(chloro)stannylene [Dipp(iPr3Si)NSnCl]2, which can be converted to bis(amido)stannylene Sn[N(Dipp)(iPr3Si)]2 and amido(imino)stannylene Sn[N(Dipp)(iPr3Si)][IPrN] (IPrN=bis(2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl)imidazolin&#8208;2&#8208;imino). Treatment of bis(imino)stannylenoid [IPrN]2Sn(Cl)Li with N2O resulted in the dimeric complex [IPrNSn(Cl)OLi]2. All compounds were characterized by NMR, elementary analysis, and X&#8208;ray structural determination.

         <title>Intra&#8208; and Intermolecular Cooperativity in the Catalytic Activity of Phosphodiester Cleavage by Self&#8208;Assembled Systems Based on Guanidinylated Calix[4]arenes.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Calix[4]arene scaffold, blocked in the cone conformation through alkylation with long alkyl chains, and decorated at the upper rim with four guanidine or arginine units, effectively catalyzes the cleavage of the phosphodiester bond of DNA and RNA model compounds in water. An exhaustive kinetic investigation unequivocally points to the existence of spontaneous aggregation phenomena, driven by hydrophobic interactions, occurring at different critical concentrations that depend on the identity of the compound. A pronounced superiority of the assembled structures compared with the monomers in solution was observed. Moreover, the catalytically active units, clustered on the macrocyclic tetrafunctional scaffold, were proved to efficiently cooperate in the catalytic mechanism and result in improved reaction rates compared to those of the monofunctional model compounds. The kinetic analysis is also integrated and corroborated with further experiments based on fluorescence spectroscopy and light scattering.
The advantage of the supramolecular assemblies based on tetrafunctional calixarenes leads to believe that the active units can cooperate not only intramolecularly but also intermolecularly. The molecules in the aggregates can probably mold, flex and rearrange but, at the same time, keep an ordered structure that favor phosphodiester bond cleavage. This dynamic preorganization can allow the catalytic units to reach a better fitting with the substrates and perform a superior catalytic activity.</dc:description>

         <title>Dichromic Allophycocyanin Trimer Covering a Broad Spectral Range (550&#8208;660 nm)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Phycobilisomes, the light&#8208;harvesting complexes of cyanobacteria and red algae, are a resource for photosynthetic, photonic and fluorescence labeling elements. They cover an exceptionally broad spectral range, but the complex super structure and assembly has been an obstacle. By replacing in Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 the biliverdin reductases, we studied the role of chromophores in the assembly of the phycobilisome core. Introduction of the green&#8208;absorbing phycoerythrobilin instead of the red&#8208;absorbing phycocyanobilin inhibited aggregation. A novel, trimeric allophycocyanin (Dic&#8208;APC) was obtained. In the small (110 kDa) unit, the two chromophores, phycoerythrobilin and phytochromobilin, cover a wide spectral range (550 to 660 nm). Due to efficient energy transfer, it provides an efficient artificial light&#8208;harvesting element. Dic&#8208;APC was generated in vitro using the contained core&#8208;linker, LC, for template&#8208;assisted purification and assembly. Labeling the linker provides a method for targeting Dic&#8208;APC.</dc:description>

         <title>How to Shrink the Ring: Phospholenes from Phosphabenzenes via Selective Ring Contraction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A 3&#8208;aminofunctionalized phosphabenzene (phosphinine) was synthesized and structurally characterized. The pyramidalized nitrogen atom of the dimethylamino substituent indicates only a weak interaction between the lone pair of the nitrogen atom and the aromatic phosphorus heterocycle, resulting in somewhat basic character. It turned out that the amino group can indeed be protonated by HCl. In contrast to pyridines, however, the phosphabenzene&#8208;ammonium salt undergoes a selective ring contraction to form a hydroxylphospholene oxide in the presence of additional water. Based on deuterium labelling experiments and quantum chemical calculations, a rational mechanism for this hitherto unknown conversion is proposed.</dc:description>

         <title>Structural and Functional Insight into the Mechanism of the Fe&#8208;S Cluster&#8208;Dependent Dehydratase from Paralcaligenes ureilyticus.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Enzyme&#8208;catalyzed reaction cascades play an increasingly important role for the sustainable manufacture of diverse chemicals from renewable feedstocks. For instance, dehydratases from the ilvD/EDD superfamily have been embedded into a cascade to convert glucose via pyruvate to isobutanol, a platform chemical for the production of aviation fuels and other valuable materials. These dehydratases depend on the presence of both a Fe&#8208;S cluster and a divalent metal ion for their function. However, they also represent the rate&#8208;limiting step in the cascade. Here, catalytic parameters and the crystal structure of the dehydratase from Paralcaligenes ureilyticus (PuDHT, both in presence of Mg2+ and Mn2+) were investigated. Rate measurements demonstrate that the presence of stoichiometric concentrations Mn2+ promotes higher activity than Mg2+, but at high concentrations the former inhibits the activity of PuDHT. Molecular dynamics simulations identify the position of a second binding site for the divalent metal ion. Only binding of Mn2+ (not Mg2+) to this site affects the ligand environment of the catalytically essential divalent metal binding site, thus providing insight into an inhibitory mechanism of Mn2+ at higher concentrations. Furthermore, in silico docking identified residues that play a role in determining substrate binding and selectivity. The combined data inform engineering approaches to design an optimal dehydratase for the cascade.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An&#160;&#8722;free regioselective functionalization of 2&#8208;aryl&#8722;heteroarenes and aryl aldehydes via an azaaryl BF2complex has been developed. Mechanistically the reaction comprises fluoride to bromide ligand exchange on an aryl boron species and consecutive C&#8722;B bond cleavage to deliver a broad range of functionalized products. The reaction is high yielding, has a broad substrate scope where several different heteroarenes can be functionalized with chloro, bromo, iodo, hydroxyl, amine and BF2&#160;in a highly regioselective fashion. The method can be applied for late&#8208;stage functionalization or for rapid skeleton remodeling with for instance cross&#8208;couplings.</dc:description>

         <title>A Simple Substitution on Thyroid Hormones Remarkably Alters the Regioselectivity of Deiodination by a Deiodinase Mimic</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The regioselective deiodinations of L&#8208;thyroxine (T4) play key roles in the thyroid hormone homeostasis. These reactions are catalyzed by three isoforms of the selenoenzymes, iodothyronine deiodinases (Dio1, Dio2 and Dio3), which are highly homologous in nature. Dio1 mediates 5&#8242;&#8208; or 5&#8208;deiodinations of T4 to produce T3 and rT3, respectively. In contrast, Dio2 and Dio3 are selective to 5&#8242;&#8208; or 5&#8208;deiodination to produce T3 and rT3, respectively. Understanding of the regioselectivity of deiodination at the molecular level is important as abnormal levels of thyroid hormone have been implicated in various clinical conditions, such as hypoxia, myocardial infarction, neuronal ischemia and cancer. In this paper, we report that the electronic properties of the iodine atoms in thyroxine (T4) can be modulated through a simple substitution in the 4'&#8208;phenolic moiety. This leads to the change in the regioselectivity of&#160;deiodination by different small molecule mimics of Dio enzymes. By using this chemical approach, we also show that the substitution of a strong electron withdrawing group facilitates the removal all four iodine atoms in the T4 derivative. Theoretical investigations on the hydrogen bonded adducts of T4 with imidazole indicate that the charge on the iodine atoms depend on the nature of hydrogen bond between the &#8208;OH group of T4 and the imidazole moiety. While the imidazole can act as either hydrogen bond acceptor (HBA) or hydrogen bond donor (HBD), the protonated imidazole acts exclusively as HBD in T4&#8208;imidazole complex. These studies support the earlier observations that the histidine residue at the active sites of the deiodinases play an important role not only in the substrate binding, but also in altering the regioselectivity of the deiodination reactions.</dc:description>

Theoretical investigations on the hydrogen bonded adducts of T4 with imidazole indicate that the charge on the iodine atoms depend on the nature of hydrogen bond between the -OH group of T4 and the imidazole moiety. While the imidazole can act as either hydrogen bond acceptor (HBA) or hydrogen bond donor (HBD), the protonated imidazole acts exclusively as HBD in T4-imidazole complex. These studies support the earlier observations that the histidine residue at the active sites of the deiodinases play an important role not only in the substrate binding, but also in altering the regioselectivity of the deiodination reactions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <dc:description>Multistimuli&#8208;responsive photochromism was observed for vinylene&#8208;linked bisflavin  1a  with an extended &#960;&#8208;conjugated platform.&#160; The yellow emission of a dilute solution of  1a  in 2&#8208;MeTHF (0.2 mM) observed at 298 K under UV excitation was changed to orange or red emission upon (1) an increase of concentration, (2) a decrease of temperature, and (3) variation of the solvent.&#160; This is in contrast to the almost non stimuli&#8208;responsive chromism of the  N  &#8208;methylated bisflavin analogue  1b  and monoflavin  2a  .&#160; Mechanistic investigation by  1  H NMR analysis under various conditions revealed that the extended &#960;&#8208;conjugation platform and imide moiety of  1a  generate controllability in the formation of lower&#8208; and higher&#8208;ordered aggregates, which induce variation of the emission color upon change.&#160; Bisflavin  1a  also exhibited redox&#8208;induced photochromism, where the orange emission of  1a  was quenched by the addition of hydrazine under anaerobic conditions, and changed back to the original emission upon subsequent bubbling of O  2  gas.</dc:description>

         <title>Coupling Value&#8208;Added Anodic Reactions with Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrocatalytic CO2 reduction features a promising approach to realize carbon neutrality. However, its competitiveness is limited by the sluggish oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at anode, which consumes a large portion of energy. Coupling value&#8208;added anodic reactions with CO2 electroreduction has been emerging as a promising strategy in recent years to enhance the full&#8208;cell energy efficiency and produce valuable chemicals at both cathode and anode of the electrolyzer. In this review, we briefly summarize recent progresses on the electrocatalytic CO2 reduction, and the economic feasibility of different CO2 electrolysis system is discussed. Then we provide a comprehensive summary of recent advances in the coupled electrolysis of CO2 and potential value&#8208;added anodic reactions, with special focus on the specific cell designs. Finally, current challenges and future opportunities for the coupled electrolysis systems are also proposed, which are targeted to facilitate progress in this field and push the CO2 electrolyzers to a more practical level.</dc:description>

Base pair stabilizers 1 and 2 were used to drive isothermal displacement reactions. Fluorescent pyrene sensors were developed to monitor the reaction progress by fluorescence change.







Abstract
Purine&#8208;2,6&#8208;diamine and 8&#8208;aza&#8208;7&#8208;deaza&#8208;7&#8208;bromopurine&#8208;2,6&#8208;diamine 2&#8217;&#8208;deoxyribonucleosides (1 and 2) were implemented in isothermal DNA strand displacement reactions. Nucleoside 1 is a weak stabilizer of dA&#8208;dT base pairs, nucleoside 2 evokes strong stabilization. Strand displacement reactions used single&#8208;stranded invaders with single and multiple incorporations of stabilizers. Displacement is driven by negative enthalpy changes between target and displaced duplex. Toeholds are not required. Two new environmental sensitive fluorescent pyrene sensors were developed to monitor the progress of displacement reactions. Pyrene was connected to the nucleobase in the invader or to a dendritic linker in the output strand. Both new sensors were constructed by click chemistry; phosphoramidites and oligonucleotides were prepared. Sensors show monomer or excimer emission. Fluorescence intensity changes when the displacement reaction progresses. Our work demonstrates that strand displacement with base pair stabilizers is applicable to DNA, RNA and to related biopolymers with applications in chemical biology, nanotechnology and medicinal diagnostics.

         <title>Carbodicarbenes and Striking Redox Transitions of their Conjugate Acids: Influence of NHC versus CAAC as Donor Substituents</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Structures and coordination behavior of carbodicarbenes bearing three possible combinations of N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) and cyclic(alkyl)(amino)(carbene) (CAAC) are compared. The strikingly different redox transitions of their conjugate acids are also reported.







Abstract
Herein, a new type of carbodicarbene (CDC) comprising two different classes of carbenes is reported; NHC and CAAC as donor substituents and compare the molecular structure and coordination to Au(I)Cl to those of NHC&#8208;only and CAAC&#8208;only analogues. The conjugate acids of these three CDCs exhibit notable redox properties. Their reactions with [NO][SbF6] were investigated. The reduction of the conjugate acid of CAAC&#8208;only based CDC with KC8 results in the formation of hydrogen abstracted/eliminated products, which proceed through a neutral radical intermediate, detected by EPR spectroscopy. In contrast, the reduction of conjugate acids of NHC&#8208;only and NHC/CAAC based CDCs led to intermolecular reductive (reversible) carbon&#8211;carbon sigma bond formation. The resulting relatively elongated carbon&#8211;carbon sigma bonds were found to be readily oxidized. They were, thus, demonstrated to be potent reducing agents, underlining their potential utility as organic electron donors and n&#8208;dopants in organic semiconductor molecules.

         <title>Reactivity of Sodium Pentaphospholide Na[cyclo&#8208;P5] towards C&#8801;E (E=C, N, P) Triple Bonds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
[Cyclo&#8208;P5]&#8722; reacts with alkynes and the isolobal nitriles and phosphaalkynes to generate novel, aromatic, five&#8208;membered heterocycles. DFT calculations give insight into the mechanism of the reaction. The anionic ligands coordinate in an &#951;5&#8208;fashion towards FeII to give the corresponding (aza)phosphametallocenes, which could be characterized crystallographically.







Abstract
A diglyme solution of Na[cyclo&#8208;P5] (1) reacts with alkynes and isolobal nitriles and phosphaalkynes to afford the otherwise elusive (aza)phospholide anions 2&#8201;a&#8211;c, 4&#8201;a,b, and 6. The reaction of Na[cyclo&#8208;P5] with alkynes and nitriles was studied by means of DFT methods, which suggested a concerted mechanism for the formation of 2&#8201;a and 4&#8201;b. The anions 2&#8201;a&#8211;c, 4&#8201;a,b, and 6 coordinate in an &#951;5&#8208;fashion towards FeII to give the sandwich (aza)phosphametallocenes 3&#8201;a&#8211;c, 5&#8201;a,b and 7 in moderate to good yields. The new compounds were characterized by means of multinuclear NMR spectroscopy, single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and cyclic voltammetry.

         <title>Transition&#8208;Metal&#8208;Free Dehydropolymerization of Phosphine&#8211;Boranes at Ambient Temperature</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polyphosphinoboranes [PhRP&#8208;BH2]n, including P&#8208;disubstituted derivatives, were accessed by deprotonation of a series of readily prepared phosphine&#8211;(triflimido)borane adducts. The choice of base impacts the polymer molar mass and linear/cyclic ratio and transient phosphinoborane monomers, RR'P&#8208;BH2 are proposed intermediates.







Abstract
Stoichiometric reaction of phosphine&#8211;borane adducts RR'PH&#8901;BH3 (R=Ph, R&#8217;=H, Ph, Et, and R=R&#8217;=tBu) with the strong acid HNTf2 (Tf=SO2CF3) leads to H2 elimination and the formation of the triflimido derivatives, RR'PH&#8901;BH2(NTf2). Subsequent deprotonation by using bases, such as diisopropylethylamine or the carbene IPr (IPr=N,N&#8217;&#8208;bis(2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl)imidazol&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene), led to the formation of P&#8208;mono&#8208; or &#8208;disubstituted polyphosphinoboranes [RR'P&#8208;BH2]n. Evidence for the intermediacy of transient phosphinoborane monomers, RR'PBH2, was provided by trapping reactions.

         <title>Co&#8208;based Catalysts for Selective H2O2 Electroproduction via 2&#8208;electron Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrochemical production of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) via two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) process is emerging as a promising alternative method to the conventional anthraquinone process. To realize high&#8208;efficiency H2O2 electrosynthesis, robust and low cost electrocatalysts have been intensively pursued, among which Co&#8208;based catalysts attract particular research interests due to the earth&#8208;abundance and high selectivity. Here, we provide a comprehensive review on the advancement of Co&#8208;based electrocatalyst for H2O2 electroproduction. The fundamental chemistry of 2&#8208;electron ORR is discussed firstly for guiding the rational design of electrocatalysts. Subsequently, the development of Co&#8208;based electrocatalysts involving nanoparticles, compounds and single atom catalysts is summarized with the focus on active site identification, structure regulation and mechanism understanding. Moreover, the current challenges and future directions of the Co&#8208;based electrocatalysts are briefly summarized in this review.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Peptides containing variations of the &#946;&#8208;amyloid hydrophobic core and five&#8208;membered sulfamidates derived from &#946;&#8208;amino acid &#945;&#8208;methylisoserine have been synthesized and fully characterized in the gas phase, solid state and in aqueous solution by a combination of experimental and computational techniques.

         <title>Dielectric Relaxation and Dielectric Switching Behaviors in (N,N&#8208;Diisopropylethylamine) Tetrachloroantimonate(III)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dielectric relaxation and dielectric switching behaviors of a novel antimony&#8208;based halide semiconductor are characterized by experiments and first&#8208;principles molecular dynamics simulations. It contains a 1D chain, undergoes an isostructural order&#8208;disorder phase transition and shows a step&#8208;like dielectric anomaly, which can function as a frequency&#8208;tuned dielectric switch with highly adjustable switch temperature.







Abstract
Dielectric switches have drawn renewed attention to the study of their many potential applications with the adjustable switch temperatures (Ts). Herein, a novel antimony&#8208;based halide semiconductor, (N,N&#8208;diisopropylethylamine) tetrachloroantimonate ((DIPEA)SbCl4, DIPEA+=N,N&#8208;diisopropylethylamine), with dielectric relaxation behavior and dielectric switches has been successfully synthesized. This compound, consisting of coordinated anion 
 chains and isolated DIPEA+ cations, undergoes an isostructural order&#8208;disorder phase transition and shows a step&#8208;like dielectric anomaly, which can function as a frequency&#8208;tuned dielectric switch with highly adjustable switch temperature (Ts). Variable&#8208;temperature single&#8208;crystal structure analyses and first&#8208;principles molecular dynamics simulations give information about the general mechanisms of molecular dynamics. This work enriches the dielectric switch family and proves that hybrid metal halides are promising candidates for switchable physical or chemical properties.

         <title>Pentacyclic and Hexacyclic Osmaarynes and Their Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The complex world of osmium: The first pentacyclic and hexacyclic osmaaryne have been successfully synthesized. The nucleophilic reaction of osmaarynes was used to obtain the corresponding osmium complexes, which exhibited near&#8208;infrared luminescence, aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) and photothermal conversion.







Abstract
Although osmabenzyne, osmanaphthalyne, osmaphenanthryne, and osmaanthracyne have been previously reported, the synthesis of polycyclic osmaarynes is still a challenge. Herein, we report the successful synthesis of the first pentacyclic osmaarynes (pyreno[b]osmabenzynes 1&#8201;a and 2&#8201;a) and hexacyclic osmaaryne (peryleno[b]osmabenzyne 3&#8201;a). Nucleophilic reaction of osmaarynes was used to obtain the corresponding pyreno[b]osmium complexes (1 and 2) and peryleno[b] osmium complex (3), which exhibited near&#8208;infrared luminescence and aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) properties. Complexes 2 and 3 are resistant to photodegradation, and complex 2 has better photothermal conversion properties than 3.

         <title>Conjugation Extension and Halochromic Behaviors of S&#8208;Fused Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons Bearing Cyclopenta[b]thiopyran Moieties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Three S&#8208;fused polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) bearing cyclopenta[b]thiopyran moieties have been designed and successfully synthesized. With the conjugation extension, the absorption onset of the longest PAH reaches 1110 nm. All the three S&#8208;fused PAHs exhibit significant halochromic properties in both solution and solid states. Upon protonation, the proton is incorporated on the cyclopentadiene ring while the positive charge is localized on the thiopyrylium ring. Moreover, no significant difference can be found for the two shorter PAHs upon the protonation by different organic acids, such as trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) and trifluoromethanesulfonic acid (TfOH), while the longest PAH can be only mono&#8208;protonated by TFA but di&#8208;protonated by stronger TfOH. Furthermore, after protonation, the non&#8208;emissive S&#8208;fused PAHs exhibit strong fluorescence and can be regenerated by simply neutralization with triethylamine. The enhanced emission of mono&#8208;protonated products stem from S2&#8594;S0 transitions, which disobey the Kasha's rule.</dc:description>

         <title>Establishing Family Relations in Group 15 Halogenido Metalates with the Largest Molecular Antimony Iodide Anion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A family of five iodido antimonates with structurally very similar anions has been prepared, and the influence of the anion's size on the band gap and the presence of additional charge&#8208;transfer effects was investigated.







Abstract
Studying structurally related families of compounds is a valuable tool in understanding and predicting material properties and has been extensively used for metal halide perovskites. Due to the variable anion structures in group 15 halogenido metalates, similar family relations are still largely missing. Herein, we present compounds featuring the [Sb2nI6n+4]4&#8722; family of anions, including the first n=5 member in [Hpyz]4[Sb10I34] (Hpyz=pyrazinium), which contains the largest halogenido pentelate anion reported to date. The optical properties of compounds featuring n=1&#8211;5 anions show a clear trend as well as an outlier, a low band gap of 1.72&#8197;eV for [Hpyz]4[Sb10I34], that can be well understood using quantum chemical investigations. Also using SbI3 and [H2NMe2]3[SbI6], a compound featuring a single octahedral [SbI6]3&#8722; unit, as limiting cases, we show that structure&#8208;property relationships can be established in group 15 halogenido metalates in a similar way as in metal halide perovskites, thus providing a framework for understanding new and known compounds in this emerging class of materials.

         <title>Simultaneous Loading of Ni2P Cocatalysts on the Inner and Outer Surfaces of Mesopores P&#8208;Doped Carbon Nitride Hollow Spheres for Enhanced Photocatalytic Water&#8208;Splitting Activity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ni2P cocatalysts were simultaneously loaded on the inner and outer surfaces of mesoporous P&#8208;doped carbon nitride hollow nanospheres to boost photocatalytic water splitting. The obtained Ni2P@PCNHS@Ni2P shows a significantly improved photocatalytic water splitting performance and enhanced atomic utilization. The findings guide the design of composite photocatalysts and the better utilization of hollow nanostructured semiconductors for photocatalysis.







Abstract
Promoting charge separation, constructing active sites, and improving the utilization of metal atoms are very important for the design of efficient photocatalysts. A simultaneous loading of Ni2P cocatalysts on the inner and outer surfaces of mesoporous P&#8208;doped carbon nitride hollow nanospheres (PCNHS) to construct a Ni2P@PCNHS@Ni2P photocatalyst is reported. Ni2P cocatalysts loading provides enough active sites on both the inner and outer surfaces for proton reduction, and the formed heterojunctions simultaneously promote the migration and separation of the photogenerated charges on the inner and outer surfaces. The photocatalytic reaction proceeds simultaneously on the inner and outer surfaces of Ni2P@PCNHS@Ni2P, which leads to a significantly improved photocatalytic water splitting performance and enhanced atomic utilization. Notably, the hydrogen evolution rate of Ni2P@PCNHS@Ni2P is 2.4 times higher than that of Pt&#8208;loaded PCNHS. The findings guide the design of hollow nanostructured composites with high&#8208;boosting photocatalytic performance.

Calcium hydride cation dimer catalysis: Dispersion&#8208;corrected DFT calculations reveal that the same double Ca&#8722;H&#8722;Ca bridged calcium hydride cation dimer catalyst [LCaH2CaL]2+&#8901;THF shows a novel substrate&#8208;dependent catalytic activity, involving cooperative Ca&#8722;H&#8722;Ca bridges for efficient H2 isotope exchange, terminal Ca&#8722;H bond for the Markovnikov addition of conjugation&#8208;activated styrene, and competitive Ca&#8722;H&#8722;Ca bridges and terminal Ca&#8722;H bonds for the anti&#8208;Markovnikov addition of unactivated 1&#8208;alkenes.







Abstract
Recently, it was shown that the double Ca&#8722;H&#8722;Ca bridged calcium hydride cation dimer complex [LCaH2CaL]2+ (macrocyclic ligand L=NNNN&#8208;tetradentate Me4TACD) exhibited remarkable activity in catalyzing the hydrogenation of unactivated 1&#8208;alkenes as well as the H2 isotope exchange under mild conditions, tentatively via the terminal Ca&#8722;H bond of cation monomer LCaH+. In this DFT mechanistic work, a novel substrate&#8208;dependent catalytic mechanism is disclosed involving cooperative Ca&#8722;H&#8722;Ca bridges for H2 isotope exchange, competitive Ca&#8722;H&#8722;Ca bridges and terminal Ca&#8722;H bonds for anti&#8208;Markovnikov addition of unactivated 1&#8208;alkenes, and terminal Ca&#8722;H bonds for Markovnikov addition of conjugation&#8208;activated styrene. THF&#8208;coordination plays a key role in favoring the anti&#8208;Markovnikov addition while strong cation&#8208;&#960; interactions direct the Markovnikov addition to terminal Ca&#8722;H bonds.

         <title>Inter&#8208;Network Charge&#8208;Transfer Excited State Formation Within a Two&#8208;fold Catenated Metal&#8211;Organic Framework</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two electronically complementary linkers of the same framework are a well&#8208;studied pathway to achieve the photo&#8208;excited charge transfer state in a framework structure. Here, we show a mostly undiscovered strategy, how intercatenated metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) endows ground&#8208;state donor&#8208;acceptor interaction from two networks of the same framework to facilitate the inter&#8208;net charge&#8208;transfer excited state through direct photo&#8208;excitation rendering the possibility in the energy conversion scheme.







Abstract
Charge&#8208;transfer excited state (CTES) defines the ability to split photon energy into work producing redox equivalents suitable for photocatalysis. Here, we report inter&#8208;net CTES formation within a two&#8208;fold catenated crystalline metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF), constructed with two linkers, N,N&#8242;&#8208;di(4&#8208;pyridyl)&#8208;1,4,5,8&#8208;naphthalenetetracarboxydiimide (DPNDI) and 2,6&#8208;dicarboxynaphthalene (NDC). The structural flexibility puts two complementary linkers from two nets in a proximal position to interact strongly. Supported by the electrochemical and steady&#8208;state electronic spectroscopic data, this ground&#8208;state interaction facilitates forming CTES that can be populated by direct excitation. We map the dynamics of the CTES which persists over a few nanoseconds and highlight the utilities of such relatively long&#8208;lived CTES as enhanced conductivity of the MOF under light over that measured in dark and as a proof&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;principle test, photo&#8208;reduction of methyl viologen under white light.

The structural flexibility puts two complementary linkers from two nets in a proximal position to interact strongly. Supported by the electrochemical and steady-state electronic spectroscopic data, this ground-state interaction facilitates forming CTES that can be populated by direct excitation. We map the dynamics of the CTES which persists over a few nanoseconds and highlight the utilities of such relatively long-lived CTES as enhanced conductivity of the MOF under light over that measured in dark and as a proof-of-the-principle test, photo-reduction of methyl viologen under white light.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Multi&#8208;Resonant Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescent (MR&#8208;TADF) Compounds as Photocatalysts
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multi&#8208;resonant thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) compounds, DiKTa and Mes3DiKTa, are shown to be excellent photocatalysts in a range of different reactions, benchmarked against the widely used donor&#8208;acceptor TADF photocatalyst, 4CzIPN. Advantages of using these MR&#8208;TADF photocatalysts include robust and inexpensive photocatalyst synthesis, lower required photocatalyst loadings and faster reaction rates, while achieving comparable or improved product yields.







Abstract
Donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8722;A) thermally activated delayed fluorescent (TADF) compounds, such as 4CzIPN, have become a widely used sub&#8208;class of organic photocatalysts for a plethora of photocatalytic reactions. Multi&#8208;resonant TADF (MR&#8208;TADF) compounds, a subclass of TADF emitters that are rigid nanographene derivatives, such as DiKTa and Mes3DiKTa, have to date not been explored as photocatalysts. In this study both DiKTa and Mes3DiKTa were found to give comparable or better product yield than 4CzIPN in a range of photocatalytic processes that rely upon reductive quenching, oxidative quenching, energy transfer and dual photocatalytic processes. In a model oxidative quench process, DiKTa and Mes3DiKTa gave increased reaction rates in comparison to 4CzIPN, with DiKTa being of particular interest due to the lower material cost (&#163;0.94/mmol) compared to that of 4CzIPN (&#163;3.26/mmol). These results suggest that DiKTa and Mes3DiKTa would be excellent additions to any chemist's collection of photocatalysts.

         <title>Neutral Boryl Radicals in Mixed&#8208;Valent B(III)Br&#8208;B(II) Adducts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two neutral boryl radicals containing intramolecular mixed&#8208;valent B(II)Br&#8208;B(III) adducts were prepared by one&#8208;electron reduction of biphenylene and 9,9&#8208;dimethylxanthene substituted haloboranes. The radical features a large spin density on the boron center and its stabilization is assisted by a weak B(III)Br&#8208;B(II) &#963; interaction.







Abstract
The general strategies to stabilize a boryl radical involve single electron delocalization by &#960;&#8208;system and the steric hinderance from bulky groups. Herein, a new class of boryl radicals is reported, with intramolecular mixed&#8208;valent B(III)Br&#8208;B(II) adducts ligated by a cyclic (alkyl)(amino)carbene (CAAC). The radicals feature a large spin density on the boron center, which is ascertained by EPR spectroscopy and DFT calculations. Structural and computational analyses revealed that the stability of radical species was assisted by the CAAC ligand and a weak but significant B(III)Br&#8208;B(II) interaction, suggesting a cooperative avenue for stabilization of boryl radicals. Two&#8208;electron reduction of these new boryl radicals provides C&#8722;H insertion products via a borylene intermediate.

         <title>Organic Crystals with Response to Multiple Stimuli: Mechanical Bending, Acid&#8208;Induced Bending and Heating&#8208;Induced Jumping</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two polymorphs (Form O and Form R) of a Schiff base compound were found, which could respond reversibly to multiple stimuli (external force, acid, heat) by elastic bending, rolling and jumping.







Abstract
Multiple stimuli&#8208;responsive molecular crystals are attracting extensive attentions due to their potential as smart materials, such as molecular machines, actuators, and sensors. However, the task of giving a single crystal multiple stimuli&#8208;responsive properties remains extremely challenging. Herein, we found two polymorphs (Form O and Form R) of a Schiff base compound, which could respond to multiple stimuli (external force, acid, heat). Form O and Form R have different elastic deformability, which can be attributed to the differences in the molecular conformation, structural packing and intermolecular interactions. Moreover, both polymorphs exhibit reversible bending driven by volatile acid vapor, which we hypothesize is caused by reversible protonation reaction of imines with formic acid. In addition, jumping can be triggered by heating due to the significant anisotropic expansion. The integration of reversible bending and jumping into one single crystal expands the application scope of stimuli&#8208;responsive crystalline materials.

Messages from the cell: The cover picture honors the sensitivity of nitroxide labels combined with EPR spectroscopy in reporting on protein structure dynamics inside bacterial cells. We have demonstrated, in particular, that NarJ protein can be investigated at room temperature within 15&#8197;minutes, conditions that allow the preservation of both cell integrity and the activity of the protein under investigation. More information can be found in the Research Article by E. Mileo and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202202249).

         <title>Design Concepts for Solution and Solid&#8208;State Emitters &#8211; A Modern Viewpoint on Classical and Non&#8208;Classical Approaches</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Shine a light! This Minireview shines a light on potential design strategies for luminophores with efficient emission in solution and the solid state. These so&#8208;called solution and solid&#8208;state emitters (SSSE) can be regarded as interplaying phenomena between the classic effects of aggregation&#8208;caused quenching (ACQ) and aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE). Hence, they feature remarkable and ideally environmentally insensitive photophysical properties and will for sure find wide&#8208;ranging applications in the near future.







Abstract
For a long time, luminescence phenomena were strictly distinguished between the emission of isolated molecules in dilute solutions or close&#8208;packed structures such as in powders or aggregates. This changed with the breakthrough observation of dual&#8208;state efficient materials, which led to a rapid boost of publications examining the influence of structural features to achieve balanced emission with disregarded molecular surroundings. Some first general structural design concepts have already been proposed based on reoccurring patterns and pivotal motifs. However, we have found another way to classify these solution and solid&#8208;state emitters (SSSEs). Hence, this minireview aims to present an overview of published structural features of SSSEs while shining light on design concepts from a more generalized perspective. Since SSSEs are believed to bridge the gap of hitherto known aggregation&#8208;sensitive compound classes, we hope to give future scientists a versatile tool in hand to efficiently design novel luminescent materials.

         <title>Recognition&#8208;Induced Enhanced Emission of Core&#8208;Fluorescent ESIPT&#8208;type Macrocycles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
ESIPT&#8208;type resorcin[4]arenes are capable of guest&#8208;binding in the cavity and generate FL response with large Stokes shift and size&#8208;selective enhancement of emission via the mechanism that involves (a) selective di&#8208;deprotonation, (b) generation of emissive double keto tautomeric forms, and (c) recognition&#8208;induced restriction of intramolecular motion.







Abstract
Core&#8208;fluorescent cavitands based on 2&#8208;(2&#8242;&#8208;resorcinol)benzimidazole fluorophores (RBIs) merged with the resorcin[4]arene skeleton were designed and synthesized. The cavitands, due to the presence of intramolecular hydrogen bonds and increased acidity, show excited state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT) and readily undergo deprotonation to form dianionic cavitands, capable of strong binding to organic cations. The changes in fluorescence are induced by deprotonation and binding events and involve huge Stokes shifts (due to emission from anionic double keto tautomers) and cation&#8208;selective enhancement of emission originating from the restriction of intramolecular motion (RIR) upon recognition in the cavity. Ab initio calculations indicate that the macrocyclic scaffold stabilizes the ground state tautomeric forms of the fluorophores that are not observed for non&#8208;macrocyclic analogs. In the excited state, the emitting forms for both macrocyclic scaffolds and non&#8208;macrocyclic analogs are anionic double keto tautomers, which are the result of excited state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT) or excited state double proton transfer (ESDPT).

         <title>Interactive Bioconjugation at N&#8208;Terminal Cysteines by Using O&#8208;Salicylaldehyde Esters towards Dual Site&#8208;Selective Functionalization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two&#8208;way protection: O&#8208;Salicylaldehyde esters are suitable handles for the site&#8208;specific protection of N&#8208;terminal cysteines on native peptides. The resulting phenolic thiazolidines present tunable stability through careful pH control that allows the orthogonal multifunctionalization of different Cys residues driven by interactive site&#8208;selective peptide modifications.







Abstract
N&#8208;terminal Cys modification has been intensively studied to produce homogeneous bioconjugates essentially through two modes of reaction: reversible modification with the equilibrium shifted towards the formation of the desired conjugate or stable and irreversible conjugates. Herein, we report a new method of N&#8208;terminal cysteine modification using O&#8208;salicylaldehyde esters (OSAEs) through fast conjugation and irreversible deconjugation. These reagents can rapidly react with N&#8208;terminal Cys at low&#8208;micromolar concentration to form thiazolidines with subsequent hydrolysis of the ester moiety to the phenolic derivative. These phenolic thiazolidines can be hydrolyzed at acidic pH (&#8776;4.5) to recover the intact N&#8208;terminal Cys. Bioconjugation reactions using OSAEs offer controlled reversibility to as act as a protecting group for N&#8208;terminal cysteines, allowing the modification of in&#8208;chain residues without perturbing the N&#8208;terminal Cys, which can then be deprotected and used as a conjugation site.

         <title>G&#8208;type Halohydrin Dehalogenases Catalyze Ring Opening Reactions of Cyclic Epoxides with Diverse Anionic Nucleophiles
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
G&#8208;type halohydrin dehalogenases convert 5&#8208; and 6&#8208;membered cyclic epoxides with a range of small anionic C&#8208;, N&#8208;, O&#8208; and S&#8208;nucleophiles.







Abstract
Halohydrin dehalogenases are promiscuous biocatalysts, which enable asymmetric ring opening reactions of epoxides with various anionic nucleophiles. However, despite the increasing interest in such asymmetric transformations, the substrate scope of G&#8208;type halohydrin dehalogenases toward cyclic epoxides has remained largely unexplored, even though this subfamily is the only one known to display activity with these sterically demanding substrates. Herein, we report on the exploration of the substrate scope of the two G&#8208;type halohydrin dehalogenases HheG and HheG2 and a newly identified, more thermostable member of the family, HheG3, with a variety of sterically demanding cyclic epoxides and anionic nucleophiles. This work shows that, in addition to azide and cyanide, these enzymes facilitate ring&#8208;opening reactions with cyanate, thiocyanate, formate, and nitrite, significantly expanding the known repertoire of accessible transformations.

         <title>Cobalt Cyclopentadienyl&#8208;Phosphine Dinitrogen Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By reducing cobalt chloride complexes under a dinitrogen atmosphere, cobalt dinitrogen complexes and binuclear cobalt tetra&#8208;dinitrogen complexes were formed. The cobalt dinitrogen complex could react with white phosphorus to afford a dinuclear cobalt complex bearing a cyclo&#8208;P4 moiety.







Abstract
By applying the potassium salts of cyclopentadienyl&#8208;phosphine ligands LK to CoCl2, the corresponding cobalt chlorides (1, LCoIICl) were prepared. By reducing complexes 1 with KHBEt3 under a N2 atmosphere, bridging end&#8208;on complexes, LCoI&#8722;N2&#8722;CoIL (2&#8201;a and 2&#8201;b), were successfully obtained. 15N2&#8208;labeled [15N2]&#8208;2&#8201;a was prepared under 15N2/14N2 exchange in THF solution. LCoI&#8722;N2&#8722;CoIL complex 2&#8201;a could react with P4 molecules to release N2 and generate a Co&#8722;P4&#8722;Co moiety 4. Further reduction of complex 2&#8201;b led to cleavage of a P&#8722;C bond in the cyclopentadienyl&#8208;phosphine ligand to provide novel &#956;&#8208;PCy2&#8208;bridged Co0&#8722;N2 complex 5. DFT calculations confirmed the experimental observations.

         <title>Constructing Netlike Nanosheets of ZnO/BiOCl with Heterojunction as Robust Material for Electrochemical Amine Detection</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
ZnO/BiOCl heterojunction material is fabricated by constructing netlike ZnO and BiOCl nanosheets. It exhibits high selectivity to ammonia and detection limit is 0.25&#8197;&#956;M, which is suitable to detect volatile amines quantitatively. The synergetic effects of the heterojunction and netlike structures contribute to boosting electrochemical activity. The ZnO/BiOCl hybrid could be an promising candidate for detection and analysis.







Abstract
The electrochemical sensing is a potential method for detection of trace toxic substance. Herein, the heterojunction of netlike ZnO/BiOCl nanosheets was constructed for the enhanced electrochemical detection of ammonia. Cyclic voltammetry and linear sweep voltammetry were used to investigate the electrochemical performance. The results show that the ZnO/BiOCl&#8208;modified electrode exhibits higher sensitivity towards ammonia compared with the ZnO and BiOCl&#8208;based electrodes, which is ascribed to band structure and fast electron transfer. The high response of 11.8&#8197;&#956;A&#8201;mM&#8722;1 and a low detection limit (LOD) of 0.25&#8197;&#956;M are achieved. In addition, the ZnO/BiOCl material exhibits high selectivity, repeatability and stability. The better linear relationship between concentration and current (R2=0.99) is significant for quantitative detection of ammonia, implying that netlike ZnO/BiOCl nanosheets can serve as electrochemical sensing platform for detecting toxic substance. This research provides a strategy for fabricating two&#8208;dimensional netlike materials and regulating heterojunctions used for electrochemical application.

     alt="Constructing Netlike Nanosheets of ZnO/BiOCl with Heterojunction as Robust Material for Electrochemical Amine Detection"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;ZnO/BiOCl heterojunction material&lt;/b&gt; is fabricated by constructing netlike ZnO and BiOCl nanosheets. It exhibits high selectivity to ammonia and detection limit is 0.25&#8197;&#956;M, which is suitable to detect volatile amines quantitatively. The synergetic effects of the heterojunction and netlike structures contribute to boosting electrochemical activity. The ZnO/BiOCl hybrid could be an promising candidate for detection and analysis.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The electrochemical sensing is a potential method for detection of trace toxic substance. Herein, the heterojunction of netlike ZnO/BiOCl nanosheets was constructed for the enhanced electrochemical detection of ammonia. Cyclic voltammetry and linear sweep voltammetry were used to investigate the electrochemical performance. The results show that the ZnO/BiOCl-modified electrode exhibits higher sensitivity towards ammonia compared with the ZnO and BiOCl-based electrodes, which is ascribed to band structure and fast electron transfer. The high response of 11.8&#8197;&#956;A&#8201;mM&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and a low detection limit (LOD) of 0.25&#8197;&#956;M are achieved. In addition, the ZnO/BiOCl material exhibits high selectivity, repeatability and stability. The better linear relationship between concentration and current (&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;2&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sup&gt;=0.99) is significant for quantitative detection of ammonia, implying that netlike ZnO/BiOCl nanosheets can serve as electrochemical sensing platform for detecting toxic substance. This research provides a strategy for fabricating two-dimensional netlike materials and regulating heterojunctions used for electrochemical application.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Tuning the Photocatalytic Performance of Ruthenium(II) Polypyridine Complexes Via Ligand Modification for Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Induced Phosphorylation of Tertiary Aliphatic Amines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The redox potential of ruthenium(II) complexes were tuned with the aim to expand their applicability as photocatalyst for synthetic conversion. This resulted in an extended scope of the photoredox phosphorylation of tertiary aliphatic amines using a new ruthenium complex as photocatalyst.







Abstract
Tuning the redox potential of commonly available photocatalyst to improve the catalytic performance or expand its scope for challenging synthetic conversions is an ongoing demand in synthetic chemistry. Herein, the excited state properties and redox potential of commercially available [Ru(bpy)3]2+ photocatalyst were tuned by modifying the structure of the bipyridine ligands with electron&#8208;donating/withdrawing units. The visible&#8208;light&#8208;mediated photoredox phosphorylation of tertiary aliphatic amines was demonstrated under mild conditions. A series of cross&#8208;dehydrogenative coupling reactions were performed employing the RuII complexes as photocatalyst giving the corresponding &#945;&#8208;aminophosphinoxides and &#945;&#8208;aminophosphonates via carbon&#8208;phosphorus (C&#8722;P) bond formation.

         <title>Continuous Charge Transport in Carbon Nitride Modulated by Interfacial Chemical Bond and Homophase Junction to Boost Photocatalytic Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Motivated by the electron transport chain in natural photosynthesis, we propose a strategy to construct an electron transport channel in a model artificial photocatalyst, C3N4&#8722;TiO2 (BN&#8722;BR/CN) by electron transport layer engineering through a homophase junction (BN&#8722;BR). The electrons generated in CN under visible light can be contiunuously extracted and migrated along CN,BR TiO2, and BN TiO2, resulting in the synergistic optimization of photoabsorption and charge separation, and boosting H2 evolution. More information can be found in the Research Article by J. Zhang and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202202007).

         <title>Placing CF2 in the Center: Major Physicochemical Changes Upon a Minor Structural Alteration in Gem&#8208;Difunctional Compounds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fluorine atoms play an important role in all branches of chemistry and accordingly, it is very important to study their unique and varied effects systematically, in particular, the structure&#8208;physicochemical properties relationship. The present study describes exceptional physicochemical effects resulting from a H/F exchange at the methylene bridge of gem&#8208;difunctional compounds. The &#916;log  P  (CF2&#8208;CH2)  values, i.e. the change in lipophilicity, observed for the CH  2  /CF  2  replacement in various &#945;,&#945;&#8208;phenoxy&#8208; and thiophenoxy&#8208;esters/amides, diketones, benzodioxoles and more, fall in the range of 0.6&#8208;1.4 units, which for most cases, is far above the values expected for such a replacement. Moreover, for compounds holding more than one such gem&#8208;difunctional moiety, the effect is nearly additive, so one can switch from a hydrophilic compound to a lipophilic one in a limited number of H/F exchanges. DFT studies of some of these systems revealed that polarity, conformational prference as well as charge distributions are strongly affected by such hydrogen to fluorine atom substitution. The pronounced effects described, are a result of the interplay between changes in polarity, H&#8208;bond basicity and molecular volume, which were obtained with a very low &#8216;cost&#8217; in terms of molecular weight or steric effects and may have a great potential for implementation in various fields of chemical sciences.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>An oxidation reaction of hydroxyhomosumanene on silica gel providing homosumanene ortho &#8208;quinone and its synthetic application for azaacene&#8208;fused homosumanenes is described. Hydroxyhomosumanene is photochemically oxidized by air, when it is coated on silica gel; this aerobic oxidation proceeds faster than that of planar analogues. The difference of such reactivity was attributed to the unusual keto&#8208;enol tautomerization due to structural difference between planer and curved &#960;&#8208;system. The homosumanene ortho quinone was used in the synthesis of several azaacene&#8208;fused homosumanenes, azaacenohomosumanenes. X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis of the single crystals revealed their columnar stacking structures due to the interactions between each bowl.

         <title>Proton induced defect&#8208;rich vanadium oxides as reversible polysulfide conversion sites for high performance lithium sulfur battery</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lithium&#8208;sulfur (Li&#8208;S) battery has attracted attentions due to its high theoretical energy density, natural abundance, and low cost. However, the diffusion of polysulfides decreases the utilization and further degrades the battery life. Herein, we successfully fabricated a defect&#8208;rich layered sodium vanadium oxide with proton doping (HNVO) nanobelt and it was utilized as the functional interface layer on separator in Li&#8208;S battery. Benefiting from the abundant defects of NVO and the catalytic activity of metal vanadium in electrochemical process, the shuttle of polysulfides was greatly decreased by reversible chemical adsorption. Besides, the extra graphene layer also contributes to accelerating the charge carrier at high current densities. Therefore, the Li&#8208;S battery with G@HNVO delivers a high capacity of 1494.8 mAh g&#8208;1 at 0.2 C and a superior cycling stability over 700 cycles at 1 C. This work provides an effective strategy for designing the electrode/separator interface layer to achieve the high&#8208;performance Li&#8208;S battery.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>As a sustainable energy technology, electrocatalytic energy conversion and storage has become increasingly prominent. Oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), oxygen evolution reaction (OER), hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR), and carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR) are the key steps in the industrial applications of energy conversion and storage. Compared to the widely used precious metal catalysts, less&#8208;noble transition metal oxides (TMOs) and TMO&#8208;like materials have attracted board attentions as electrocatalysts in the above reactions. In this concept, we summarize the challenges and opportunities of some typical TMOs in electrocatalysis, and modification strategies of TMOs as electrocatalysts are discussed.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis and Characterization of Hypervalent Pentacoordinate Carbon Compounds bearing a 7&#8208;6&#8208;7&#8208;Ring Skeleton</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>To stabilize SN2 transition state&#8208;like penta&#8208;coordinate carbon species, triaryl&#8208;substituted cationic carbon compounds bearing a moderately flexible 7&#8208;6&#8208;7&#8208;ring skeleton bearing sulfur donors were synthesized and characterized. Electronic effects of the para&#8208;substituents (R = Cl, F, H, CH3, SMe, OMe)&#160;the two equatorial aryl groups bound to the cationic central carbon were investigated systematically along with a planar bidentate thioxanthene derivative. X&#8208;ray analysis on their solid&#8208;state structures showed that the parent (R = H), chloro&#8208;, fluoro&#8208;, and methyl derivatives&#160;were tetracoordinate carbon (sulfonium) structures, while the pMeO&#160;and thioxanthenyl system&#160;were pentacoordinate carbocation structures. The Hammett substituent constants for the para substituents (&#963;p+) correlates well with the bonding in these compounds. The methylthio&#8208;derivative&#160;with intermediate Hammett substituent constants (p&#8208;MeS; &#963;p+=&#8208;0.60) showed a tetracooridnate solid&#8208;state structure, though solution UV&#8208;Vis properties suggested the presence of a penta&#8208;coordinate structure. These amount to the first unambiguous solution evidence to the hypervalent apical 3c&#8208;4e interactions in pentacoordinate carbon compounds.</dc:description>

         <title>Roles that Organic Ammoniums Play on the Surface of the Perovskite Film: A&#160;Review</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Although perovskites show excellent optoelectronic properties leading to unprecedented efficiency increases of perovskite solar cells (PSCs), their polycrystalline films present a number of defect states, especially concentrated on the surface, which seriously affects device efficiency and long&#8208;term stability. Numerous works have reported various organic ammonium salts (OASs) to reduce defect states on the surface of the perovskite film. However, diverse roles of OASs are proposed and a guideline for reasonably selecting an OAS to treat the perovskite film is still lacked. Herein, we summarize recent works regarding the surface treatment of the perovskite film with OASs and discuss various roles that OASs play. Furthermore, we reveal how key factors, including chemical environment of the perovskite surface, types of OASs, and annealing temperature, influence the roles of OASs. This review could provide clues for understanding working mechanisms of OASs and for selecting appropriate OASs to improve the PSC performance.</dc:description>

         <title>Reconstructured Electrocatalysts during Oxygen Evolution Reaction under Alkaline Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of electrocatalysts with high&#8208;efficiency and clear structure&#8208;activity relationship towards the sluggish oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is essential for the wide application of water electrolyzers. Recently, the dynamic reconstruction phenomenon of the catalysts&#8217; surface structures during the OER process has been discovered. With the help of various advanced ex situ and in situ characterization, it is demonstrated that such surface reconstruction could yield actual active species to catalyze the water oxidation process. However, the attention and studies of potential interaction between reconstructed species and substrate are lacking. This review summarizes the recent development of typical reconstructed electrocatalysts and the substrate effect. First, the advanced characterization for electrocatalytic reconstruction is briefly discussed. Then, typical reconstructed electrocatalysts are comprehensively summarized and the key role of substrate effects during the OER process is emphasized. Finally, the future challenges and perspectives of surface reconstructed catalysts for water electrolysis are discussed.</dc:description>

         <title>Formation, Reactivity and Decomposition of Aryl Phospha&#8208;Enolates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two lithium phospha&#8208;enolates [RP=C(Si i Pr3)OLi]2 were prepared by reaction of triisopropyl silyl phosphaethynolate,  i Pr3SiPCO, with aryl lithium reagents LiR (R = Mes: 1,3,5&#8208;trimethyl phenyl; or Mes*: 1,3,5,&#8208;tri&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl phenyl). Monomer/dimer aggregation of the enolates can be modulated by addition of 12&#8208;crown&#8208;4. Substitution of lithium for a heavier alkali metal was achieved through initial formation of a silyl enol ether, followed by reaction with KO t Bu to form the corresponding potassium phospha&#8208;enolate [MesP=C(Si i Pr3)OK]2. On addition of water, the enolates are protonated to afford RP=C(Si i Pr3)(OH). For the sterically less demanding system (R = Mes), this phospha&#8208;enol rapidly tautomerises to the corresponding acyl phosphine MesP(H)C(Si i Pr 3 )(O), which on heating extrudes CO. In contrast, bulkier phospha&#8208;enol (R = Mes*) is stable to rearrangement at room temperature and thermally decomposes to RH and  i Pr3SiPCO.</dc:description>

         <title>Bis(amidophenolato)phosphonium: Si&#8208;H Hydride Abstraction and Phosphorous&#8208;Ligand Cooperative Activation of C&#8208;C Multiple Bonds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The first bis(amidophenolato)phosphonium salts are prepared and fully characterized. The perfluorinated derivative represents the strongest monocationic phosphorus Lewis acid on the fluoride and hydride ion affinity scale isolable to date. This affinity enables new reactions, such as hydride abstraction from Et3SiH, the first phosphaalkoxylation of an alkyne or a phosphorous catalyzed intramolecular hydroarylation. All properties and reactions are scrutinized by theory and experiment. Substantial &#963;&#8208; and &#960;&#8208;acidity provides the required affinity for substrate activation, while phosphorous&#8208;ligand cooperativity substantially enriches the reactivity portfolio of phosphonium ions.</dc:description>

         <title>Two&#8208;Factor Fluorogenicity of Tetrazine&#8208;Modified Cyanine&#8208;Styryl Dyes for Bioorthogonal Labelling of DNA</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>TTwo green fluorescent tetrazine&#8208;modified cyanine&#8208;styryl dyes were synthesized for bioorthogonal labelling of DNA by means of the Diels&#8208;Alder reaction with inverse electron demand. With DNA as target biopolymer the fluorescence of these dyes is released by two factors: (i)&#160;sterically by their interaction with DNA, and (ii)&#160;structurally via the conjugated tetrazine as quencher moiety. As a result, the reaction with bicyclononyne&#8208;modified DNA is significantly accelerated up to &#8805;&#160;284,000&#160;M&#8208;1s&#8208;1, and the fluorescence turn&#8208;on is enhanced up to 560 by the two&#8208;factor fluorogenicity. These dyes are cell permeable even in low concentrations and undergo fluorogenic reactions with BCN&#8208;modified DNA in living HeLa cells. The two&#8208;factor fluorescence release improves the signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio such that washing procedures prior to cell imaging are not needed, which is a great advantage for live cell imaging of DNA and RNA in the future.</dc:description>

         <title>Erythrose and Threose: Carbonyl Migrations, Epimerizations, Aldol, and Oxidative Fragmentation Reactions Under Plausible Prebiotic Conditions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The prebiotic generation of sugars in the context of origins of life studies is of considerable interest. Among the important intramolecular processes of sugars are carbonyl migrations and accompanying epimerizations. Herein we describe the carbonyl migration&#8208;epimerization process occurring down the entire carbon chain of chirally pure d&#8208;tetroses sugars under mild conditions. Employing chirally pure 1&#8208;13C&#8208;erythrose, 4&#8208;13C&#8208;erythrose and 1&#8208;13C&#8208;threose, we (1) identify all the species formed as the carbonyl migrates down the four&#8208;carbon chain and (2) assess the rates associated with the production of each of these species. Competing aldol reactions and oxidative fragmentation processes were also observed. Further observations of self&#8208;condensation of glycolaldehyde mainly yielding 2&#8208;keto&#8208;hexoses (sorbose and tagatose) and tetrulose also provides a basis for understanding the effect of carbonyl migrations on the product distribution in plausible prebiotic scenarios.</dc:description>

         <title>Sustainable Production of Molybdenum Carbide (MXene) from Fruit Wastes for Improved Solar Evaporation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Freshwater production using solar&#8208;driven interfacial evaporation is considered to be a green and sustainable strategy. The biggest barrier to practical deployment of solar desalination, however, continues to be the lack of options for renewable materials. Herein, we present a simple two&#8208;step carbonization approach that is sustainable for developing innovative two&#8208;dimensional (2D) molybdenum carbide (Mo2C) materials derived&#160;from carbonized fruit wastes. The resultant 2D Mo2C photothermal layer has a high water evaporation rate of 1.52 kg m&#8208;2 h&#8208;1 with a photothermal conversion efficiency of 94 % under one sun irradiation, which is among the best values reported thus far. The broad solar absorption band, high specific surface area (555.1 m2 g&#8208;1) with large micro&#8208; and meso porosity&#160;of the Mo2C&#160;photothermal layer are responsible for these outstanding results. The conversion of food wastes into valuable products, in this case MXene, can potentially inspire greener developments of advanced materials for solar water evaporator.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>
Vinylene&#8208;linked thiopyrylium&#8208;based covalent organic frameworks (COFs) were synthesized from 2,4,6&#8208;trimethylpyrylium tetrafluoroborate and other common reagents by means of acid&#8208;catalyzed Aldol condensation. Besides, pyrylium&#8208;, and pyridinium&#8208;based COFs also can be prepared from the same monomer under slightly different reaction conditions.







Abstract
The development of new vinylene&#8208;linked covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with special ionic structure and high stability is challenging. Herein, we report a facile, general method for constructing ionic vinylene&#8208;linked thiopyrylium&#8208;based COFs from 2,4,6&#8208;trimethylpyrylium tetrafluoroborate and other common reagents by means of acid&#8208;catalyzed Aldol condensation. Besides, pyrylium&#8208;, and pyridinium&#8208;based COFs also can be prepared from the same monomer under slightly different reaction conditions. The COFs exhibited uniform nanofibrous morphologies with excellent crystallinities, special ionic structures, well&#8208;defined nanochannels, and high specific surface areas.

         <title>Probing Cell&#8208;Surface Interactions in Fungal Cell Walls by High&#8208;Resolution 1H&#8208;Detected Solid&#8208;State NMR Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
How 1H&#8208;detected fast MAS ssNMR spectroscopy can be applied for in&#8208;depth characterization of the Schizophyllum commune cell wall architecture and composition, as well as the elucidation of cell surface&#8208;level interactions. The obtained results reveal the relative abundance and arrangement of the polysaccharide and polypeptide layers and their significance in the binding of ligands to the fungal cell wall.







Abstract
Solid&#8208;state NMR (ssNMR) spectroscopy facilitates the non&#8208;destructive characterization of structurally heterogeneous biomolecules in their native setting, for example, comprising proteins, lipids and polysaccharides. Here we demonstrate the utility of high and ultra&#8208;high field 1H&#8208;detected fast MAS ssNMR spectroscopy, which exhibits increased sensitivity and spectral resolution, to further elucidate the atomic&#8208;level composition and structural arrangement of the cell wall of Schizophyllum commune, a mushroom&#8208;forming fungus from the Basidiomycota phylum. These advancements allowed us to reveal that Cu(II) ions and the antifungal peptide Cathelicidin&#8208;2 mainly bind to cell wall proteins at low concentrations while glucans are targeted at high metal ion concentrations. In addition, our data suggest the presence of polysaccharides containing N&#8208;acetyl galactosamine (GalNAc) and proteins, including the hydrophobin proteins SC3, shedding more light on the molecular make&#8208;up of cells wall as well as the positioning of the polypeptide layer. Obtaining such information may be of critical relevance for future research into fungi in material science and biomedical contexts.

Abstract
A three&#8208;component, solvent&#8208;dependent, Br&#248;nsted&#8208;acid&#8208;catalyzed reaction of benzaldehydes, silyl enolates and arene nucleophiles has been developed for the synthesis of potential drug candidate 3&#8208;aryl&#8208;1&#8208;indanones. This reaction features the formation of three C&#8722;C bonds, high regioselectivity in a one&#8208;pot strategy, broad substrate generality, facile scalability (1.04g), high functional group tolerance and viable substrates. The &#946;&#8208;O&#8208;silyl ethers generated in&#8208;situ from the Mukaiyama aldol reaction were subjected to acid&#8208;catalyzed benzylic arylation with strong as well as weak nucleophiles, and the resultant &#946;,&#946;&#8208;diaryl esters can undergo a third C&#8722;C bond formation with excellent regioselectivity through intramolecular cyclization to afford the indanone products in the same pot. Detailed mechanistic insight leads to a feasible reaction pathway. This transformation opens up a practical and adaptable approach to producing a variety of synthetically valuable transformations and enable the synthesis of medicinally valuable (R)&#8208;tolterodine and (+)&#8208;indatraline.

         <title>Stacking Interactions: A Supramolecular Approach to Upgrade Weak Halogen Bond Donors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
&#960;&#8208;Stacking interactions turn on halogen &#963;&#8208;hole in unactivated chloro&#8208; and bromo&#8208;arenes which are thus enabled to function as good halogen bonding donors.







Abstract
The co&#8208;crystallization of tetracyanobenzene (TCB) with haloarenes ArX provided six new co&#8208;crystals TCB&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;ArX (ArX=PhCl, PhBr, 4&#8208;MeC6H4Cl, 4&#8208;MeC6H4Br, 4&#8208;MeOC6H4Cl, 1,2&#8208;Br2C6H4) which were studied by X&#8208;ray diffraction. In these systems, the strong collective effect of &#960;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; stacking interactions and lone pair&#8208;(X)&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960;&#8208;hole&#8208;(C) bondings between TCB and ArX promote the strength of X&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Ncyano halogen bonding (HaB). Theoretical studies showed that the stacking interactions affect the &#963;&#8208;hole depth of the haloarenes, thus significantly boosting their ability to function as HaB donors. According to the molecular electrostatic potential calculations, the &#963;&#8208; hole&#8208;(Cl) value (1.5&#8197;kcal/mol) in the haloarene 4&#8208;MeOC6H4Cl (featuring an electron&#8208;rich arene moiety and exhibiting very poor &#963;&#8208;hole&#8208;(Cl) ability) increases significantly in the stacked trimer (TCB)2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;4&#8208;MeOC6H4Cl (12.5&#8197;kcal/mol). Theoretical DFT calculations demonstrate the dramatic increase of X&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Ncyano HaB strength for stacked trimers in comparison with parent unstacked haloarenes.

         <title>Efficient Photoredox Cycles to Control Perylenediimide Self&#8208;Assembly
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photoreduction can be used to disassemble perylenediimide&#8208;based supramolecular structures by creating repulsive dianions. Typically, photoreductions are done in oxygen&#8208;free conditions. Here we show that &#8216;indirect photoreduction&#8217; by acetone ketyl radicals is very efficient and can be done in open air. Repeated photoreduction/disassembly followed by oxidation/assembly cycles can in this way be performed by simple UV&#8722;C LED light.







Abstract
Photoreduction of perylenediimide (PDI) derivatives has been widely studied for use in photocatalysis, hydrogen evolution, photo&#8208;responsive gels, and organic semiconductors. Upon light irradiation, the radical anion (PDI&#8901;&#8722;) can readily be obtained, whereas further reduction to the dianion (PDI2&#8722;) is rare. Here we show that full 2&#8208;electron photoreduction can be achieved using UVC light: 1) in anaerobic conditions by &#8216;direct photoreduction&#8217; of PDI aggregates, or 2) by &#8216;indirect photoreduction&#8217; in aerobic conditions due to acetone ketyl radicals. The latter strategy is also efficient for other dyes, such as naphthalenediimide (NDI) and methylviologen (MV2+). Efficient photoreduction on the minute time&#8208;scale using simple LED light in aerobic conditions is attractive for use in dissipative light&#8208;driven systems and materials.

Silanols are important industrial building blocks for the functionalization of surfaces. In this research, one silicon&#8208;stereogenic silanol was selectively synthesized and analyzed. By using an innovative combination of this stereochemical probe and isotope labeling, a configurationally stable chiral silanol was studied, providing new insights into mechanistic studies.







Abstract
A silicon&#8208;stereogenic aminosilanol was isolated in excellent diastereomeric ratio and the absolute configuration was determined. The silanol is configurative and condensation stable in solution and shows stereoselective transformations with a clean stereospecific pathway in follow&#8208;up reactions, which leads to the isolation of a silicon&#8208;stereogenic zinc complex and siloxane compounds. Investigations with 18O&#8208;labelled water and mass spectrometry analysis revealed an otherwise hidden exchange of oxygen atoms of silanol and water in solution that proceeds with retention of the configuration at the silicon center. This novel combination of a stereochemical probe and isotopic labeling in a silicon&#8208;stereogenic compound opens new analytic possibilities to study stereochemical courses of reactions with the aid of chiral silanols mechanistically.

         <title>Systematic Modulation of Thiol Functionalities in Inexpensive Porous Polymers for Effective Mercury Removal</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Triple trickle trap: Mercury cations were captured by three thiol&#8208;modified porous polymers with precise sulfur content and chain length. Results show optimized binding with very high capacities and a unique hydrophobic/hydrophobic interplay with multidentate binding facilitates varying capture kinetics. Easily scaled up, these inexpensive solids could feasibly be used in cleaning mercury&#8208;laden water streams.







Abstract
Through accumulation, mercury contamination in aquatic systems still poses serious health risks despite the strict regulations on drinking water and industrial discharge. One effective strategy against this is adsorptive removal, in which a suitably functionalized porous material is added to water treatment protocols. Thiol (SH) group&#8208;grafted structures perform commendably; however, insufficient attention is paid to the cost, scalability, and reusability or how the arrangement of sulfur atoms could affect the HgII binding strength. We used an inexpensive and scalable porous covalent organic polymer (COP&#8208;130) to systematically introduce thiol functional groups with precise chain lengths and sulfur content. Thiol&#8208;functionalized COP&#8208;130 demonstrates enhanced wettability and excellent HgII uptake of up to 936&#8197;mg&#8201;g&#8722;1, with fast kinetics and exceptionally high selectivity. These Hg adsorbents are easily regenerated with HCl and can be used at least six times without loss of capacity even after treatment with strong acid, a rare performance in the domain of Hg&#8208;removal research.

         <title>Protonated Porphyrins: Bifunctional Catalysts for the Metal&#8208;Free Synthesis of N&#8208;Alkyl&#8208;Oxazolidinones</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
CO2 cycloaddition to N&#8208;alkyl aziridines was efficiently promoted by economic and easy&#8208;to&#8208;synthesize protonated forms of porphyrin ligands. The metal&#8208;free procedure does not require the addition of any Lewis base or additive and allows N&#8208;alkyl oxazolidinones to be obtained in high yields and regioselectivities. A catalytic mechanism for the procedure is proposed on the basis of a DFT study.







Abstract
The protonation of commercially available porphyrin ligands yields a class of bifunctional catalysts able to promote the synthesis of N&#8208;alkyl oxazolidinones by CO2 cycloaddition to corresponding aziridines. The catalytic system does not require the presence of any Lewis base or additive, and shows interesting features both in terms of cost effectiveness and eco&#8208;compatibility. The metal&#8208;free methodology is active even with a low catalytic loading of 1&#8201;% mol, and the chemical stability of the protonated porphyrin allowed it to be recycled three times without any decrease in performance. In addition, a DFT study was performed in order to suggest how a simple protonated porphyrin can mediate CO2 cycloaddition to aziridines to yield oxazolidinones.

         <title>Total Synthesis, Absolute Configuration, and Phytotoxic Activity of Foeniculoxin</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Foeniculoxin is a major phytotoxin produced by Italian strains of Phomopsis foeniculi. The first total synthesis is described utilizing the ene reaction and Sonogashira cross&#8208;coupling reaction as key steps. The absolute configuration of the C6&#8217; was determined using chiral separation and advanced Mosher&#8217;s method. The phytotoxicity of the synthesized compound was demonstrated via syringe&#8208;based infiltration into Chenopodium album and Arabidopsis thaliana leaves. Synthetic foeniculoxin induced various defects in A. thaliana leaf cells before lesion formation, including protein leakage into the cytoplasm from both chloroplasts and mitochondria and mitochondrial rounding and swelling. Furthermore, foeniculoxin and the antibiotic hygromycin B caused similar agglomeration of mitochondria around chloroplasts, highlighting this event as a common component in the early stages of plant cell death.</dc:description>

         <title>Oxidation of an Internal&#8208;Edge&#8208;Substituted [5]Helicene&#8208;Derived Phosphine Synchronously Enhances Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Helicenes with controllable chiroptical properties: Herein, we reveal a system in which the oxidation of a phosphino group on the inner rim of a helicene derivative induces a circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) response. A helicene bearing a phosphine oxide group exhibits a markedly enhanced CPL response in the excited state compared with that of such a helicene with a corresponding phosphine.

         <title>Robust Spirobifluorene Core Based Hole Transporters with High Mobility for Long&#8208;Life Green Phosphorescent Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Devices</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A green phosphorescent OLED with a high external quantum efficiency of 22&#8201;% and a long lifetime (LT50) of 89,000&#8197;h at 1000&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2 has been successfully developed by a spirobifluorene&#8208;based multifunctional hole transporter referred to as TDBFSBF1.







Abstract
Using a tailored high triplet energy hole transport layer (HTL) is a suitable way to improve the efficiency and extend the lifetime of organic light&#8208;emitting devices (OLEDs), which can use all molecular excitons of singlets and triplets. In this study, dibenzofuran (DBF)&#8208;end&#8208;capped and spirobifluorene (SBF) core&#8208;based HTLs referred as TDBFSBF1 and TDBFSBF2 were effectively developed. TDBFSBF1 exhibited a high glass transition temperature of 178&#8201;&#176;C and triplet energy of 2.5&#8197;eV. Moreover, a high external quantum efficiency of 22.0&#8201;%, long operational lifetime at 50&#8201;% of the initial luminance of 89,000&#8197;h, and low driving voltage at 1000&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2 of 2.95&#8197;V were achieved in green phosphorescent OLEDs using TDBFSBF1. Further, a high&#8208;hole mobility &#956;h value of 1.9&#215;10&#8722;3&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1 was recorded in TDBFSBF2. A multiscale simulation successfully reproduced the experimental &#956;h values and indicated that the reorganization energy was the primary factor in determining the mobility differences among these SBF core based HTLs.

Moreover, a high external quantum efficiency of 22.0&#8201;%, long operational lifetime at 50&#8201;% of the initial luminance of 89,000&#8197;h, and low driving voltage at 1000&#8197;cd&#8201;m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; of 2.95&#8197;V were achieved in green phosphorescent OLEDs using &lt;b&gt;TDBFSBF1&lt;/b&gt;. Further, a high-hole mobility &lt;i&gt;&#956;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt; value of 1.9&#215;10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3&lt;/sup&gt;&#8197;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;V&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; was recorded in &lt;b&gt;TDBFSBF2&lt;/b&gt;. A multiscale simulation successfully reproduced the experimental &lt;i&gt;&#956;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt; values and indicated that the reorganization energy was the primary factor in determining the mobility differences among these SBF core based HTLs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Siderophore&#8208;linked Ruthenium Catalysts for Targeted Allyl Ester Prodrug Activation within Bacterial Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Due to rising resistance, new antibacterial strategies are needed, including methods for targeted antibiotic release. As targeting vectors, chelating molecules released by bacteria to acquire iron called siderophores have been investigated for conjugation to antibacterials, leading to the clinically&#8208;approved drug cefiderocol. The use of small&#8208;molecule catalysts for prodrug activation within cells has shown promise in recent years, and here we investigate siderophore&#8208;linked ruthenium catalysts for the activation of antibacterial prodrugs within cells. Moxifloxacin&#8208;based prodrugs were synthesised and their catalyst&#8208;mediated activation was demonstrated under anaerobic, biologically&#8208;relevant conditions. In the absence of catalyst, decreased antibacterial activities were observed compared to moxifloxacin versus&#160;Escherichia coli K12 (BW25113). A series of siderophore&#8208;linked ruthenium catalysts were investigated for prodrug activation, all of which displayed a combinative antibacterial effect with the prodrug, whilst a representative example displayed little toxicity against mammalian cell lines. By employing complementary bacterial growth assays, conjugates containing siderophore units based on catechol and azotochelin were found to be most promising for intracellular prodrug activation.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This manuscript demonstrates a simple and efficient strategy that involves dual DBU/iron&#8208;catalyzed alkene perfluoroalkylvinylation using perfluoroalkyl iodides and 2aminonaphthalene&#8208;1,4&#8208;diones as coupling partners. In terms of the developed catalytic system, various styrenes and aliphatic alkenes are well&#8208;tolerated, leading to the accurate preparation of perfluoroalkyl&#8208;containing 2&#8208;aminonaphthalene&#8208;1,4&#8208;diones in excellent regioselectivity. Moreover, the protocol can be readily applied in late&#8208;stage modifications of natural products and pharmaceuticals. The title reactions are featured by easily accessible and inexpensive catalysts and substrates, broad substrate applicability, and mild reaction conditions. Mechanistic investigations reveal a tandem C&#8208;I cleavable alkylation and C&#8208;C vinylation enabled by cooperative DBU/iron catalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Catalysts as Key Enablers for the Synthesis of Bioplastics with Sophisticated Architectures</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly active and selective catalysts pave the way for the production of bioplastics with tailor&#8208;made properties. Comonomers can be used to alter the properties of the prominent bioplastic PLA. Besides the variation in the microstructure, a treasure not yet fully uncovered lies within the combination of different monomer classes in multimechanistic polymerizations.







Abstract
Bioplastics are one of the answers to environmental pollution and linear material flows. The most promising bioplastic polylactide (PLA) is already replacing conventional plastics in a number of applications. The properties of PLA, however, do not fit for all potential application areas, but they can be altered by the introduction of comonomers. The copolymerization of lactide (LA) with other lactones like &#1013;&#8208;caprolactone (CL) has been established for several years. Nevertheless, controlling copolymerizations remains a challenge due to the high complexity of the system. Copolymerization of LA with other monomer classes is much less investigated, but has the chance to overcome the limitations in material properties that occur when only lactones are used. The crucial factor for all copolymerizations is the catalyst. It dominates the reaction kinetics and determines the resulting microstructure. In this review, copolymerization catalysts for LA are presented divided into catalysts for the synthesis of lactone block copolymers, lactone random copolymers, and multimechanistically synthesized copolymers. The selected catalysts are highlighted either owing to their industrially applicable polymerization conditions or their non&#8208;standard mechanism.

         <title>Structure&#8211;Property Relationship of Cyano&#8208;Functionalized Conjugated Polymers for Photocatalytic Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>

Photocatalysis: The increase in the degree of CN functionalization can regulate the D&#8208;A interaction with beneficial effects, such as broadened light absorption range, improved charge separation, enhanced interaction with Pt cocatalyst, and strengthened hydrophilicity, which achieves an excellent activity in the photocatalytic hydrogen production reaction.







Abstract
Conjugated polymers (CPs) have garnered increasing attention in the field of photocatalysis due to their stability and molecular tunability. Understanding the structure&#8211;property relationship in CPs and addressing appropriate molecular design strategies are pivotal to improving the photocatalytic performance of CPs. Herein, a new efficient cyano (CN) engineering approach was proposed to promote the photocatalytic performance of CPs, and three representative CP&#8208;based photocatalysts with different CN contents were tailor&#8208;made to investigate the relationship between CN functionalization and photocatalytic activity. A series of systematically experimental and theoretical studies reveal that CN functionalization contributes to strengthening the donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;A) interaction, enhancing the light absorption ability, charge separation/transfer efficiency, and hydrophilicity of CPs, and also facilitating the output of separated photoinduced electrons from CPs to Pt cocatalyst. Thus, the dicyano&#8208;functionalized polymer (P&#8208;2CN) manifests an attractive photocatalytic performance in hydrogen production. This study provides a facile strategy to develop excellent CP&#8208;based photocatalysts for solar fuel production.

         <title>Investigating the Active Oxidants Involved in Cytochrome P450 Catalyzed Sulfoxidation Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Engineering peroxygenase activity into a P450 monooxygenase through mutations of the oxygen activation machinery resulted in a higher activity towards sulfoxidation than O&#8208;demethylation compared to the WT enzyme. This implies the existence of a second oxidant capable of catalyzing sulfoxidation which is proposed to be the Fe(III)&#8208;H2O2 complex as proposed in theoretical work by Shaik.







Abstract
Cytochrome P450 (CYP) heme&#8208;thiolate monooxygenases catalyze the hydroxylation of the C&#8722;H bonds of organic molecules. This reaction is initiated by a ferryl&#8208;oxo heme radical cation (Cpd I). These enzymes can also catalyze sulfoxidation reactions and the ferric&#8208;hydroperoxy complex (Cpd 0) and the Fe(III)&#8208;H2O2 complex have been proposed as alternative oxidants for this transformation. To investigate this, the oxidation of 4&#8208;alkylthiobenzoic acids and 4&#8208;methoxybenzoic acid by the CYP199A4 enzyme from Rhodopseudomonas palustris HaA2 was compared using both monooxygenase and peroxygenase pathways. By examining mutants at the mechanistically important, conserved acid alcohol&#8208;pair (D251N, T252A and T252E) the relative amounts of the reactive intermediates that would form in these reactions were disturbed. Substrate binding and X&#8208;ray crystal structures helped to understand changes in the activity and enabled an attempt to evaluate whether multiple oxidants can participate in these reactions. In peroxygenase reactions the T252E mutant had higher activity towards sulfoxidation than O&#8208;demethylation but in the monooxygenase reactions with the WT enzyme the activity of both reactions was similar. The peroxygenase activity of the T252A mutant was greater for sulfoxidation reactions than the WT enzyme, which is the reverse of the activity changes observed for O&#8208;demethylation. The monooxygenase activity and coupling efficiency of sulfoxidation and oxidative demethylation were reduced by similar degrees with the T252A mutant. These observations infer that while Cpd I is required for O&#8208;dealkylation, another oxidant may contribute to sulfoxidation. Based on the activity of the CYP199A4 mutants it is proposed that this is the Fe(III)&#8208;H2O2 complex which would be more abundant in the peroxide&#8208;driven reactions.

The peroxygenase activity of the T252A mutant was greater for sulfoxidation reactions than the WT enzyme, which is the reverse of the activity changes observed for &lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;-demethylation. The monooxygenase activity and coupling efficiency of sulfoxidation and oxidative demethylation were reduced by similar degrees with the T252A mutant. These observations infer that while Cpd I is required for &lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;-dealkylation, another oxidant may contribute to sulfoxidation. Based on the activity of the CYP199A4 mutants it is proposed that this is the Fe(III)-H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; complex which would be more abundant in the peroxide-driven reactions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Accumulation of Four Electrons on a Terphenyl (Bis)disulfide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Charge accumulation is relevant for applications in solar energy conversion. Here, we present an electron acceptor that is able to store up to four electrons by taking advantage of the uncommon phenomenon of potential inversion.







Abstract
The activation of N2, CO2 or H2O to energy&#8208;rich products relies on multi&#8208;electron transfer reactions, and consequently it seems desirable to understand the basics of light&#8208;driven accumulation of multiple redox equivalents. Most of the previously reported molecular acceptors merely allow the storage of up to two electrons. We report on a terphenyl compound including two disulfide bridges, which undergoes four&#8208;electron reduction in two separate electrochemical steps, aided by a combination of potential compression and inversion. Under visible&#8208;light irradiation using the organic super&#8208;electron donor tetrakis(dimethylamino)ethylene, a cascade of light&#8208;induced reaction steps is observed, leading to the cleavage of both disulfide bonds. Whereas one of them undergoes extrusion of sulfur to result in a thiophene, the other disulfide is converted to a dithiolate. These insights seem relevant to enhance the current fundamental understanding of photochemical energy storage.

         <title>Pnictogen&#8208;Bridged Diphenyl Sulfones as Photoinduced Pnictogen Bond Forming Emission Motifs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, we investigated pnictogen&#8208;bridged diphenyl sulfones as a new class of luminophores with photoinduced dynamic rearrangement. Experimental and theoretical studies revealed that their emission dynamics could be ascribed to the photoinduced Pn&#8722;bond formation between a lone O pair in the sulfonyl moiety and the antibonding orbital of the Pn&#8722;C bond.







Abstract
In this study, pnictogen (Pn)&#8208;bridged diphenyl sulfones were synthesized as motifs for photoinduced dynamic rearrangement. The newly synthesized sulfones exhibited dual fluorescence at 298&#8197;K. Density functional theory calculations revealed that the longer&#8208;wavelength fluorescence was derived from the geometries after structural relaxation through photo&#8208;driven pnictogen bond formation between the O atom lone pair of the sulfonyl moiety and the antibonding orbital of the Pn&#8722;C bond. This is the first report on emission dynamics driven by pnictogen bond formation upon photoexcitation.

         <dc:description>Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are the one of most promising photovoltaic technologies that can be achieved by a simple solution process. At the current stage, the key issues concern further improvements in efficiency and operational lifetime. Constructing a self&#8208;assembled perovskite structure with manipulated chemical and physical properties is a useful and effective strategy to solve these problems. Herein, we review the basic principles and the recent progress of spontaneous formation behaviors of heterostructured perovskite thin films. This concept provides insightful clues towards the design and fabrication of stable and efficient PSCs for the next&#8208;generation photovoltaics.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Novel coordination polymers embedding electroactive moieties present a high interest in the development of porous conducting materials. While tetrathiafulvalene (TTF) based metal&#8208;organic frameworks were reported to yield through&#8208;space conducting frameworks, the use of S&#8208;enriched scaffolds remains elusive in this field. Herein is reported the employment of bis(vinylenedithio)&#8208;tetrathiafulvalene (BVDT&#8208;TTF) functionalized with pyridine coordinating moieties in coordination polymers. Its combination with various transition metals yielded four isostructural networks, whose conductivity increased upon chemical oxidation with iodine. The oxidation was confirmed in a single&#8208;crystal to single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction experiment for the Cd(II) complex. Raman spectroscopy measurements and DFT calculations confirmed the oxidation state of the bulk materials, and band structure calculations assessed the ground state as an electronically localized antiferromagnetic state, while the conduction occurs in a 2D manner. These results are shedding light to comprehend how to improve through&#8208;space conductivity thanks to sulfur enriched ligands.</dc:description>

         <title>Stabilization of potent Co(II)&#8208;based Lewis acids with weakly basic ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Pairing cations with weakly coordinating anions (WCAs) often renders them highly Lewis&#8208;acidic and extremely reactive. Although these features are often desirable, excessive reactivity of a cation may lead to decomposition of solvents or WCAs, hindering isolation, storage and practical use of such species. In an attempt to mitigate the problem, we introduce a series of readily available novel Co(II)&#8208;WCA salts with the metal center stabilized by weakly bound ligands: SO2, halogenated acetonitriles and nitromethane with comprehensive characterization including structural, magnetic and spectral (IR) properties as well as thermal stability assessment. The use of these simple yet rarely encountered ligands yields mostly stable and highly Lewis&#8208;acidic complexes, in some cases comparable to SbF5 according to calculated Fluoride Ion Affinities. Highly acidic character of the species is also reflected in observed reactivity. Since the most convenient route towards the Co(II) complexes leads through silver salts, the results are complemented with characterization of a series of novel Ag(I) complexes with abovementioned ligands. Experimental part is backed with DFT calculations which gives insight into the structure and energetics of presented Co(II) complexes and shows that Co(II) center is available for substrates like olefins. This makes them good candidates for catalysts in reactions requiring the presence of Lewis acids.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sodium manganese&#8208;based oxides (NMO) are attracting huge attention as safe and cost&#8208;effective cathode materials for sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs). To date, one of the most important challenges of NMO&#8208;based cathodes is the relatively low capacity. Therefore, it is of great siginificance to develope high&#8208;capacity NMO&#8208;based cathodes. Great efforts have been made to enhance the reversible capacity of NMO&#8208;based cathodes, achieveing considerable progress not only on electrochemical performance, but also the mechanism of massive sodium ion storage. In this paper, the structure and sodium storage mechanism for typical phases of NMO are reviewed, including P2, P3, O3, tunnel&#8208;type and spinel&#8208;type NMO&#8208;based cathodes. Strategies for high&#8208;capacity NMO&#8208;based cathodes, such as cationic substitution, anion redox activation, etc. are introduced in detail. Last but not least, the future opportunities and challenges for high&#8208;capacity NMO&#8208;based cathode are prospected.</dc:description>

         <title>Bimetallic organic framework&#8208;decorated leaf&#8208;like 2D nanosheets as flexible air cathode for rechargeable Zn&#8208;air batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>To explore highly active and robust self&#8208;supporting air electrode is the key for &#64258;exible Zn&#8208;air batteries (FZABs). Therefore, we report a novel 3D structural bimetal&#8208;based self&#8208;supporting electrode consisting of hybrid Cu, Co nanoparticles co&#8208;modified nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon nanosheets on carbon cloth (Cu, Co NPs@NCNSs/CC), which displays excellent electrochemical activity and durability of oxygen reduction/evolution reaction (ORR/OER). The Cu, Co NPs@NCNSs/CC exhibits a half&#8208;wave potential of 0.863 V toward ORR and an overpotential of 225 mV at 10 mA cm&#8208;2 toward OER, owing to its exposed bimetallic sites accelerating kinetic reaction. In addition, the density functional theory calculation proves that the synergistic effect of CuCo sites favors ORR and OER. Hence, the FZABs based on Cu, Co NPs@NCNSs/CC achieve a larger open&#8208;circuit potential (1.45 V), higher energy density (130.10 mW cm&#8208;2), and outstandingly cycling stability. All remarkable results demonstrate valuable enlightenment for seeking advanced energy materials of portable and wearable electronics.</dc:description>

         <title>Probing a General Strategy to Break the C&#8208;C Bond of Benzene by a Cyclic (Alkyl)(Amino)Aluminyl Anion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The oxidative addition of C&#8208;C bonds in aromatic hydrocarbons by low valent main group species has attracted considerable attention from both theoretical and experimental chemists due to the big challenge in breaking their aromaticity. Here, we demonstrate a general strategy to break the C&#8208;C bonds in benzene by cyclic (alkyl)(amino)aluminyl anion via density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Our results suggest that the activation of the C&#8208;C bond of benzene by this anion is both kinetically and thermodynamically unfavorable whereas introducing electron&#8208;withdrawing groups makes such C&#8208;C bond activation becomes favorable both kinetically and thermodynamically. Such a sharp change on the kinetics and thermodynamics could be rationalized by the frontier molecular orbital theory by decreasing the lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals of the mono&#8208; and disubstituted benzenes. Aromaticity is found to stabilize the transition state for the ring open step. All these findings can help develop the chemistry of small&#8208;molecule activation.</dc:description>

         <title>Differences in the reactivity of geminal Si&#8211;O&#8211;P and Al&#8211;O&#8211;P</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The new oxygen&#8208;bridged geminal Si/P Frustrated Lewis Pair (FLP) tBu2P&#8211;O&#8211;Si(C2F5)3 (2) is able to reversibly bind carbon dioxide at ambient temperature. We compared its reactivity towards benzil, but&#8208;3&#8208;en&#8208;2&#8208;one, nitriles and phenylacetylene to that of the Al/P FLP tBu2P&#8211;O&#8211;AlBis2 (Bis = &#8211;CH(SiMe3)2) (1). When reacted with benzil, both, 1 and 2, form the 1,2&#8208;addition product, but in the Si/P FLP 2, the second carbonyl function additionally binds to the silicon atom. With but&#8208;3&#8208;en&#8208;2&#8208;one 2 forms the 1,2&#8208;addition product, while 1 binds in 1,4&#8208;position. The reaction with acetonitrile yielded an unexpected etheneimine adduct for both systems, while only 1 reacted with tert&#8208;butylnitrile. With benzonitrile and acrylonitrile, 2 showed reversible addition to the C&#8801;N bond and 1 forms a stable adduct with benzonitrile. Solely 1 shows reactivity towards phenylacetylene affording a mixture of the CH deprotonation adduct tBu2P(H)&#8211;O&#8211;AlBis2(CCPh) and the FLP&#8208;C&#186;C adduct under ring formation. All compounds were charac&#173;te&#173;rized by multinuclear NMR spectroscopy, XRD and elemental analysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Phosphorescent Metal Halide Nanoclusters for Tunable Photodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is currently limited by the inability of photosensitizers (PSs) to enter cancer cells and generate sufficient reactive oxygen species.&#160; Utilizing phosphorescent triplet states of novel PSs to generate singlet oxygen offers exciting possibilities for PDT. Here, we report&#160; phosphorescent octahedral molybdenum (Mo)&#8208;based nanoclusters&#160; (NC) with tunable toxicity for PDT of cancer cells without use of rare or toxic elements. Upon irradiation with blue light, these molecules are excited to their singlet state and then undergo intersystem crossing to their triplet state. These NCs display surprising tunability of their cellular cytotoxicity and phototoxicity by modulating the apical halide ligand with a series of short chain fatty acids from trifluoroacetate to heptafluorobutyrate. The NCs are effective in PDT against breast, skin, pancreas, and colon cancer cells as well as their highly metastatic derivatives, demonstrating the robustness of these NCs in treating a wide variety of aggressive cancer cells. Furthermore, these NCs are internalized by cancer cells, remain in the lysosome, and can be modulated by the apical ligand to produce singlet oxygen. Thus, (Mo)&#8208;based nanoclusters are an excellent platform for optimizing PSs. Our results highlight the profound impact of molecular nanocluster chemistry in PDT applications.</dc:description>

Isomeric mixtures of 1,3&#8208;dienes were selectively isomerized to their Z&#8208;isomers by uphill photocatalysis using blue LEDs and a catalytic amount of Ru(bpy)32+(PF6&#8722;)2 as the triplet sensitizer. It proved possible to directly convert alkyne and 1&#8208;alkene to Z&#8208;1,3&#8208;dienes by a one&#8208;pot procedure, offering a practical approach to Z&#8208;1,3&#8208;dienes which cannot be made directly by ene&#8208;yne metathesis.







Abstract
A variety of 1&#8208;aryl&#8208;1,3&#8208;dienes were isomerized from E to Z isomers by photocatalysis using Ru(bpy)3[PF6]2 and blue LED light. Enrichment of the Z&#8208;isomer is thought to occur by selective triplet energy transfer from the photocatalyst to the stereoisomeric mixture. The 1,3&#8208;diene starting materials are easily made by catalytic ene&#8208;yne metathesis (EYM). To access 1,3&#8208;diene Z&#8208;stereoisomers directly, a one pot procedure was developed. Additional 1,3&#8208;dienes were investigated for both isomerization and Z&#8208;enrichment. The combination of cross EYM with photocatalysis allows for the stereoconvergent synthesis of Z&#8208;1,3&#8208;dienes.

         <title>Nanoarchitectonics of RGO&#8208;Wrapped CNF/GO Aerogels with Controlled Pore Structures by PVA&#8208;Assisted Freeze&#8208;Casting Approach for Efficient Sound and Microwave Absorption
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A polyvinyl alcohol (PVA)&#8208;assisted freeze&#8208;casting is developed for controllably fabricating reduced graphene oxide wrapped&#8208;carbon nanofiber (RGO@CNF)/graphene oxide composite aerogel. Due to the modulation of the pore size and composition, the resultant aerogel demonstrated an improved sound absorption property, especially at low frequencies. Moreover, the sample exhibits good microwave absorption performance and cyclic loading stability.







Abstract
Acoustic absorption materials play an important role in eliminating the negative effects of noise. Herein, a polyvinyl alcohol (PVA)&#8208;assisted freeze&#8208;casting was developed for controllably fabricating reduced graphene oxide wrapped carbon nanofiber (RGO@CNF)/graphene oxide composite aerogel. During the freeze&#8208;casting, PVA was used as an icing inhibitor to control the size of ice crystals. While the concentration of PVA increased from 0 to 15&#8197;mg&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;ml&#8722;1, the average pore size of the aerogel was reduced from 154 to 45&#8197;&#956;m. Due to the modulation of the pore size and composition, the propagation path and friction loss for sound were optimized, especially at low frequency. For instance, the normalized sound absorption coefficient of RGO@CNF/GO&#8208;10 achieves 0.79 (250&#8211;6300&#8197;Hz). The sample also exhibits a desirable microwave absorbing property whose maximum reflection loss is &#8722;47.3&#8197;dB (9.44 GHz, d=3.0&#8197;mm).

     alt="Nanoarchitectonics of RGO-Wrapped CNF/GO Aerogels with Controlled Pore Structures by PVA-Assisted Freeze-Casting Approach for Efficient Sound and Microwave Absorption**&amp;#xA;"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A polyvinyl alcohol (PVA)-assisted freeze-casting&lt;/b&gt; is developed for controllably fabricating reduced graphene oxide wrapped-carbon nanofiber (RGO@CNF)/graphene oxide composite aerogel. Due to the modulation of the pore size and composition, the resultant aerogel demonstrated an improved sound absorption property, especially at low frequencies. Moreover, the sample exhibits good microwave absorption performance and cyclic loading stability.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acoustic absorption materials play an important role in eliminating the negative effects of noise. Herein, a polyvinyl alcohol (PVA)-assisted freeze-casting was developed for controllably fabricating reduced graphene oxide wrapped carbon nanofiber (RGO@CNF)/graphene oxide composite aerogel. During the freeze-casting, PVA was used as an icing inhibitor to control the size of ice crystals. While the concentration of PVA increased from 0 to 15&#8197;mg&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;ml&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, the average pore size of the aerogel was reduced from 154 to 45&#8197;&#956;m. Due to the modulation of the pore size and composition, the propagation path and friction loss for sound were optimized, especially at low frequency. For instance, the normalized sound absorption coefficient of RGO@CNF/GO-10 achieves 0.79 (250&#8211;6300&#8197;Hz). The sample also exhibits a desirable microwave absorbing property whose maximum reflection loss is &#8722;47.3&#8197;dB (9.44 GHz, d=3.0&#8197;mm). Prospectively, this synthetic strategy can be extended to develop other forms of elastic aerogel with a controlled pore size.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>&#963;&#8208;Holes in Iodonium Ylides: Halogen&#8208;Bond Activation of Carboxylic Acids, Phenols and Thiophenols May Enable Their X&#8722;H Insertion Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Computational analysis revealed iodonium ylides to possess two &#963;&#8208;holes of differing potentials, situated along the extensions of their C&#8722;I bonds. Experimentation revealed that formal O&#8722;H or S&#8722;H insertion reactions were possible with carboxylic acids, phenols and thiophenols. Halogen&#8208;bond activation is presumed to be essential, resulting in &#945;&#8208;substituted&#8208;&#946;&#8208;dicarbonyls in 64&#8201;%&#8211;99&#8201;% yield in five minutes.







Abstract
The first systematic evaluation of the electrostatic potential energy maps of iodonium ylides was conducted. We determined that they possess two &#963;&#8208;holes of differing electron deficiencies, with the more electropositive &#963;&#8208;hole located opposite the dative I&#8722;C bond to the &#946;&#8208;dicarbonyl motif, and the lesser electropositive &#963;&#8208;hole located opposite the iodoarene C&#8722;I bond. We also conducted the first systematic evaluation of carboxylic acids, phenols and thiophenols in the O/S&#8208;alkylation reaction of iodonium ylides. While carboxylic acids and thiophenols were found to be generally viable, only phenols possessing electron&#8208;withdrawing substituents were effective. This high&#8208;yielding and highly chemoselective reaction is believed to involve halogen&#8208;bond activation of heteroatoms, and nicely complements existing diazo&#8208;based methods for alkylation of acidic functional groups.

         <title>Cluster&#8208;Based Crystalline Materials for Iodine Capture</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cluster&#8208;based crystalline materials play an important role in the field of iodine host&#8208;guest chemistry. This review summarizes the recent progress of different types of cluster&#8208;based materials (such as cluster&#8208;based MOFs with different cluster nodes, metal&#8208;organic cages, macrocyclic molecules, and cluster composites) for iodine capture. The research status, possible iodine capture mechanisms and prospects of such crystalline materials are discussed.







Abstract
The treatment of radioactive iodine in nuclear waste has always been a critical issue of social concern. The rational design of targeted and efficient capture materials is of great significance to the sustainable development of the ecological environment. In recent decades, crystalline materials have served as a molecular platform to study the binding process and capture mechanism of iodine molecules, enabling people to understand the interaction between radioactive iodine guests and pores intuitively. Cluster&#8208;based crystalline materials, including molecular clusters and cluster&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic frameworks, are emerging candidates for iodine capture due to their aggregative binding sites, precise structural information, tunable pores/packing patterns, and abundant modifications. Herein, recent progress of different types of cluster materials and cluster&#8208;dominated metal&#8208;organic porous materials for iodine capture is reviewed. Research prospects, design strategies to improve the affinity for iodine and possible capture mechanisms are discussed.

         <title>Small Molecule Tools to Study Cellular Target Engagement for the Intracellular Allosteric Binding Site of GPCRs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A druggable intracellular allosteric binding site (IABS) has recently been identified at several GPCRs. Ligands targeting the IABS are promising drugs and currently evaluated in several clinical trials. Herein, we review small molecule tools that enable an unambiguous identification and characterization of cellular target engagement for intracellular allosteric GPCR ligands.







Abstract
A conserved intracellular allosteric binding site (IABS) has recently been identified at several G protein&#8208;coupled receptors (GPCRs). Ligands targeting the IABS, so&#8208;called intracellular allosteric antagonists, are highly promising compounds for pharmaceutical intervention and currently evaluated in several clinical trials. Beside co&#8208;crystal structures that laid the foundation for the structure&#8208;based development of intracellular allosteric GPCR antagonists, small molecule tools that enable an unambiguous identification and characterization of intracellular allosteric GPCR ligands are of utmost importance for drug discovery campaigns in this field. Herein, we discuss recent approaches that leverage cellular target engagement studies for the IABS and thus play a critical role in the evaluation of IABS&#8208;targeted ligands as potential therapeutic agents.

         <title>Introduction of Ferrocene as a Facilitator for the Construction of Supramolecular Polymers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ferrocene assistant: The central ferrocene unit facilitates the designed monomer (1,n&#8242;&#8208;disubstituted ferrocene&#8208;azobenzene&#8208;long alkyl chains) to form supramolecular polymer (SP) by supporting higher enthalpy gain. The restricted rotational flexibility of ferrocene allows two azobenzene&#8208;dendritic arms to rotate freely, generating the best possible molecular conformation required for effective intermolecular interactions towards SP formation.







Abstract
Proper monomer design is the key to enhancing the strength of noncovalent interactions between the molecules toward the efficient formation of supramolecular polymers (SPs). We have designed and synthesized 1,n&#8242;&#8208;disubstituted ferrocene&#8208;azobenzene&#8208;long alkyl chains, Fc(CONH&#8208;Azo&#8208;TDP)2, to afford SPs with a high probability. The design exploits the &#8216;&#8216;molecular ball&#8208;bearing&#8217;&#8217; property of the ferrocene core, which allows two azobenzene arms to rotate in the planes of cyclopentadienyl rings, generating the most suitable molecular conformation required for SP formation. This ferrocene monomer formed a supergel consisting of SPs supported by strong intermolecular (H&#8208;bonding and &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking) interactions and higher enthalpy gain than the reference molecules, where the central ferrocene core was replaced by flexible aliphatic as well as rigid benzene linkers. The molecular conformation involved in SPs, the strength of noncovalent interactions, and the process of supramolecular polymerization were investigated through NMR, UV&#8208;Vis, XRD and TEM studies. The results demonstrate that ferrocene may act as a good modulator for constructing efficient SPs.

         <title>Modulating CoFeOX Nanosheets Towards Enhanced CO2 Photoreduction to Syngas: Effect of Calcination Temperature and Mixed&#8208;Valence Multi&#8208;Metals</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The mixed valence state and nanosheet&#8208;like structure of CoFeOX cocatalyst support its ultra&#8208;high charge transfer, abundant CO2 active adsorption sites exposure, and thus outstanding photocatalytic CO2 reduction activity.







Abstract
CoFeOX nanosheets were synthesized by a facile coprecipitation and calcination method. The effect of calcination temperature on the crystal texture, morphology and surface areas of CoFeOX were fully explored. CoFeOX sample calcined at 600&#8201;&#176;C (CoFeOX&#8208;600) showed superior catalytic performance for the reduction of CO2 under visible light. Compared with the pure Ru(bpy)32+&#8208;sensitized CO2 reduction system, the CoFeOX&#8208;added system achieved 19&#8208;fold enhancement of CO production (45.7&#8197;&#956;mol/h). The mixed valence state and nanosheet&#8208;like structure of CoFeOX cocatalyst support its ultra&#8208;high charge transfer and abundant CO2 active adsorption sites exposure, which promote the separation of photogenerated charges, and thus improve the photocatalytic CO2 reduction activity. Carbon source of CO from CO2 was verified by 13CO2 isotopic labelling experiment. Repeated activity experiments confirmed the good stability of CoFeOX in the CO2 photoreduction system. This work would provide prospective insights into developing novel cost&#8208;effective, efficient, and durable non&#8208;precious metal cocatalysts to improve the efficiency of photocatalytic reduction of CO2.

     alt="Modulating CoFeOX Nanosheets Towards Enhanced CO2 Photoreduction to Syngas: Effect of Calcination Temperature and Mixed-Valence Multi-Metals"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The mixed valence state&lt;/b&gt; and nanosheet-like structure of CoFeO&lt;sub&gt;X&lt;/sub&gt; cocatalyst support its ultra-high charge transfer, abundant CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; active adsorption sites exposure, and thus outstanding photocatalytic CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction activity.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CoFeO&lt;sub&gt;X&lt;/sub&gt; nanosheets were synthesized by a facile coprecipitation and calcination method. The effect of calcination temperature on the crystal texture, morphology and surface areas of CoFeO&lt;sub&gt;X&lt;/sub&gt; were fully explored. CoFeO&lt;sub&gt;X&lt;/sub&gt; sample calcined at 600&#8201;&#176;C (CoFeO&lt;sub&gt;X&lt;/sub&gt;-600) showed superior catalytic performance for the reduction of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; under visible light. Compared with the pure Ru(bpy)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-sensitized CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction system, the CoFeO&lt;sub&gt;X&lt;/sub&gt;-added system achieved 19-fold enhancement of CO production (45.7&#8197;&#956;mol/h). The mixed valence state and nanosheet-like structure of CoFeO&lt;sub&gt;X&lt;/sub&gt; cocatalyst support its ultra-high charge transfer and abundant CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; active adsorption sites exposure, which promote the separation of photogenerated charges, and thus improve the photocatalytic CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction activity. Carbon source of CO from CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; was verified by &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; isotopic labelling experiment. Repeated activity experiments confirmed the good stability of CoFeO&lt;sub&gt;X&lt;/sub&gt; in the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; photoreduction system. This work would provide prospective insights into developing novel cost-effective, efficient, and durable non-precious metal cocatalysts to improve the efficiency of photocatalytic reduction of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Light&#8208;Responsive Oligothiophenes Incorporating Photochromic Torsional Switches</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel class of light&#8208;responsive &#960;&#8208;conjugated compounds incorporates photochromic torsional switches (PTS). These compounds are able to tune the planarization of their &#960;&#8208;conjugated backbone, and thus their optical and electronic properties, by using light as an external stimulus. The PTS unit is based on a bithiophene fragment linked to a photochromic azobenzene moiety. When this PTS&#8208;containing oligothiophene is not exposed to light, the azobenzene moiety assumes its extended trans conformation, which forces the oligothiophene backbone to twist out of coplanarity. Exposure to UV light results in isomerization to the cis conformation, which allows the bithiophene fragment to assume a planar, &#960;&#8208;conjugated conformation. More information can be found in the Research Article by D. Fazzi, E. Orentas, G. Sforazzini, and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202202698).

         <title>Dimorpholinoacetylene and Its Use for the Synthesis of Tetraaminocyclobutadiene Species</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A stable cyclobutadiene dication was isolated and structurally characterized as a bis(tribromide) salt. Unlike the folded minimum structure calculated for the parent C4H42+ system, this dication exhibits a planar geometry in the solid state. However, calculations reveal a nearly isoenergetic folded isomer, and detailed studies employing advanced NICS methods show that, counterintuitively, cyclobutadiene dications are more aromatic when puckered rather than planar. For more information on this topic and related applications of diaminoacetylenes, see the Research Article by M. Tamm and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202202737).

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Long&#8208;wavelength light&#8208;emitting electrochemical cells (LECs) are potential deep&#8208;red and near infrared light sources with solution&#8208;processable simple device architecture, low&#8208;voltage operation, and compatibility with inert metal electrodes. Many scientific efforts have been made to material design and device engineering of the long&#8208;wavelength LECs over the past two decades. The materials designed the for long&#8208;wavelength LECs cover ionic transition metal complexes, small molecules, conjugated polymers, and perovskites. On the other hand, device engineering techniques, including spectral modification via adjusting microcavity effect, light outcoupling enhancement, energy down&#8208;conversion from color conversion layers, and adjusting intermolecular interactions, are also helpful in improving the device performance of long&#8208;wavelength LECs. In this review, recent advances in the long&#8208;wavelength LECs are reviewed from the viewpoints of materials and device engineering. Finally, discussions on conclusion and outlook indicate possible directions for future developments of the long&#8208;wavelength LECs. This review would like to pave the way for the researchers to design materials and device engineering techniques for the long&#8208;wavelength LECs in the applications of displays, bio&#8208;imaging, telecommunication, and night&#8208;vision displays.</dc:description>

         <title>Complexation Preferences of Dynamic Constitutional Frameworks as Adaptive Gene Vectors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The growing applications of therapeutic nucleic acids requires the concomitant development of vectors that are optimized to complex one type of nucleic acid, forming nanoparticles suitable for further trafficking and delivery. While fine&#8208;tuning a vector by molecular engineering to obtain a particular nanoscale organization at the nanoparticle level can be a challenging endeavor, we turned the situation around and instead screened the complexation preferences of dynamic constitutional frameworks toward different types of DNAs. Dynamic constitutional frameworks (DCF) are recently&#8208;identified vectors by our group that can be prepared in a versatile manner through dynamic covalent chemistry. Herein, we designed and synthesized 40 new DCFs that vary in hydrophilic/hydrophobic balance, number of cationic headgroups. The results of DNA complexation obtained through gel electrophoresis and fluorescent displacement assays reveal binding preferences of different DCFs toward different DNAs. The formation of compact spherical architectures with an optimal diameter of 100&#8208;200 nm suggests that condensation into nanoparticles is more effective for longer PEG chains and PEI groups that induce a better binding performance in the presence of DNA targets.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The increased importance of RNA&#8208;based therapeutics&#160;comes with a need to develop next&#8208;generation stimuli&#8208;responsive&#160;systems capable of binding, transporting and releasing RNA&#160;oligomers. In this work, we describe triazolium&#8208;based amphiphiles&#160;capable of siRNA binding and enzyme&#8208;responsive release of the&#160;nucleic acid payload. In aqueous medium, the amphiphile selfassembles&#160;into nanocarriers that can disintegrate upon the addition of&#160;esterase. Key to the molecular design is a self&#8208;immolative linker that&#160;is anchored to the triazolium moiety and acts as a positively&#8208;charged&#160;polar head group. We demonstrate that addition of esterase leads to&#160;a degradation cascade of the linker, leaving the neutral triazole&#160;compound unable to form complexes and therefore releasing the&#160;negatively&#8208;charged siRNA. The reported molecular design and overall&#160;approach may have broad utility beyond this proof &#8208;of&#8208;principle study,&#160;because the underlying CuAAC &#8220;click&#8221; chemistry allows bringing&#160;together three groups very efficiently as well as cleaving off one of the&#160;three groups under the mild action of an esterase enzyme.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Molecular entities with doublet or triplet ground states find increasing interest as potential molecular quantum bits (qubits). Complexes with higher multiplicity might even function as qudits and serve to encode further quantum bits. Vanadium(II) ions in octahedral ligand fields with quartet ground states and small zero&#8208;field splittings qualify as qubits with optical read out thanks to potentially luminescent spin&#8208;flip states. We identified two V2+ complexes [V(ddpd)2]2+ with the strong field ligand N,N&#8217;&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;N,N&#8217;&#8208;dipyridine&#8208;2&#8208;yl&#8208;pyridine&#8208;2,6&#8208;diamine (ddpd) in two isomeric forms (cis&#8208;fac and mer) as suitable candidates. The energy gaps between the two lowest Kramers doublets amount to 0.2 and 0.5 cm&#8211;1 allowing pulsed EPR experiments at conventional Q&#8208;band frequencies (35 GHz). Both isomers possess spin&#8208;lattice relaxation times T1 of around 300 &#181;s and a phase memory time TM of around 1 &#181;s at 5 K. Furthermore, the mer isomer displays slow magnetic relaxation in an applied field of 400 mT. While the vanadium(III) complexes [V(ddpd)2]3+ are emissive in the near&#8208;IR&#8208;II region, the [V(ddpd)2]2+ complexes are non&#8208;luminescent due metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge transfer admixture to the spin&#8208;flip states.</dc:description>

         <title>Controlled Formation of Porous 2D Lattices from C3 Symmetric Ph6&#8208;Me&#8208;Tribenzotriquinacene&#8208;OAc3</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The on&#8208;surface self&#8208;assembly of molecules to form holey nanographenes is a promising approach for the control of the properties of the resulting 2D lattice. Usually, planar molecules are utilized to prepare flat, structurally confined molecular layers, with only a few recent examples of warped precursors. However, control of the superstructures is limited thus far. Herein, we report on the temperature&#8208;controlled self&#8208;assembly of a bowl&#8208;shaped, acetylated C 3 &#8208;symmetric hexaphenyltribenzotriquinacene derivative on Cu(111). Combining scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and density functional theory (DFT) confirms the formation of highly differing arrangements starting with &#960;&#8208;stacked bowl&#8208;to&#8208;bowl dimers at low coverage at room temperature via chiral honeycomb structures, an intermediate trigonal superstructure, followed by a fully carbon&#8208;based, flattened hexagonal superstructure formed by on&#8208;surface deacetylation, which is proposed as a precursor for holey graphene networks with unique defect structures.</dc:description>

         <title>Advances on Dual&#8208;Functional Hosts for Polysulfides Conversion and Lithium Plating/Stripping towards Lithium&#8722;Sulfur  Full Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The practical application of lithium&#8722;sulfur (Li&#8722;S) batteries is greatly hindered by the shuttle effect of dissolved polysulfides in the sulfur cathode and the severe dendritic growth in the lithium anode. Adopting one type of effective host with dual&#8208;functions including both inhibiting polysulfide dissolution and regulating Li plating/stripping, is recently an emerging&#160;research highlight in Li&#8722;S battery. This review focuses on such dual&#8208;functional hosts and systematically summarizes the recent research progress and application scenarios. Firstly, this review briefly describes the stubborn issues in Li&#8722;S battery operations and the sophisticated counter measurements over the challenges by dual&#8208;functional behaviors. Then, the latest advances on dual&#8208;functional hosts for both cathode and anode in Li&#8722;S full cells are catalogued as species, including metal chalcogenides, metal carbides, metal nitrides, heterojunctions, and the possible mechanisms during the process. Besides, we also outlined the theoretical calculation tools for the dual&#8208;functional host based on the first principles. Finally, several sound perspectives are also rationally proposed for fundamental research and practical development as guidelines.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Direct oxidative coupling of inert C(sp3)&#8208;H bond has been a great challenge. Herein, an environmentally friendly aerobic oxidative coupling of &#945;&#8208;methyl substituted N&#8208;heteroarenes with indoles was reported. A vareity of diheteroaryl ketones were prepared in good yileds (up to 72%). This protocol features simple operation and broad substrates scope (26 examples). Significantly, a plausible mechanism about catalytic cycle was proposed, and two key intermediates were confirmed by high resolution mass spectrometry.</dc:description>

         <title>Cu&#8208;Catalyzed Stereoselective Borylation and Pd&#8208;Catalyzed Stereospecific Cross&#8208;Coupling to Give&#160;Aryl C&#8208;Glycosides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metabolically stable C&#8208;glycosides are an essential family of compounds in bioactive natural products, therapeutic agents, and biological probes. For their application, development of synthetic methods by connecting glycosides and aglycons with strict stereocontrol at the anomeric carbon as well as with high functional group compatibility and environmental compatibility is a pivotal issue. Although Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura&#8208;type C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp2) cross&#8208;coupling using glycosyl boronates is a potential candidate for the construction of C&#8208;glycosides, neither the cross&#8208;coupling itself nor the facile synthesis of the coupling precursor, glycosyl boronates, have been achieved to date. Here, we succeeded in developing a Cu&#8208;catalyzed stereoselective one&#8208;step borylation of glycosyl bromides to glycosyl boronates and Pd&#8208;catalyzed stereospecific cross&#8208;coupling of &#946;&#8208;glycosyl borates with aryl bromides to give aryl &#946;&#8208;C&#8208;glycosides, in which the &#946;&#8208;configuration of the anomeric carbon of the glycosyl trifluoroborates is stereoretentively transferred to that of the resulting aryl C&#8208;glycosides.</dc:description>

         <title>Molecular Twisting Affects the Solid&#8208;State Photochemical Reactions of Unsaturated Ketones and the Photomechanical Effects of Molecular Crystals</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The three group of chalcone derivatives and their analogues involving halogen atoms (X = F, Cl, Br) have been synthesized. Firstly, the nearly planar acyclic chalcone derivatives were inclined to undergo photo&#8208;induced stereospecific [2+2] cycloaddition, which triggered the crystals to exhibit macroscopic motions of bending or cracking. In particular, the single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal transformation happened upon UV irradiation of their crystals, which was helpful for the understanding photomechanical effects. The group of cyclic 3,4&#8208;dihydronaphthalen&#8208;based chalcone analogues possess a more twisted conformation, and they tend to take place trans&#8208;cis isomerization. No photomechanical effect was observed for the crystals of the cyclic chalcone analogues due to the lower isomerization rate. The twist degree of chroman&#8208;based chalcone analogues molecules was in between of the first two, [2+2] cycloaddition and trans&#8208;cis isomerization simultaneously underwent in their crystals. Photo&#8208;induced bending and twisting were observed for the crystals of chroman&#8208;based chalcone analogues. Therefore, the differences in molecular dihedral angles in a,b&#8208;unsaturated ketones were responsible for their photochemical characters and in turn to tune the photomechanical effects. In this work, a bridge between the molecular structures and solid&#8208;state photochemical reactions triggered photomechanical crystals is built.</dc:description>

         <title>Modifying the St&#246;ber Process: Is the Organic Solvent Indispensable?</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The St&#246;ber method is one of the most important and fundamental processes for the synthesis of inorganic (nano)materials, but has the drawback of using a large amount of organic solvent. Herein, we used ethanol as an example to explore if the organic solvent in a typical St&#246;ber method can be omitted. We found that ethanol increases the particle size of the obtained silica spheres and aids the formation of uniform silica particles rather than forming a gel. Nevertheless, the results indicated that an organic solvent in the initial synthesis mixture is not indispensable. We discovered, an initially immiscible synthesis method, which can replace the organic solvent&#8208;based St&#246;ber method to successfully synthesize silica particles with the same size ranges as the original St&#246;ber process without addition of organic solvents. Moreover, this process can be of further value to be extended to synthesis processes of other materials based on the St&#246;ber process.</dc:description>

Nevertheless, the results indicated that an organic solvent in the initial synthesis mixture is not indispensable. We discovered, an initially immiscible synthesis method, which can replace the organic solvent-based St&#246;ber method to successfully synthesize silica particles with the same size ranges as the original St&#246;ber process without addition of organic solvents. Moreover, this process can be of further value to be extended to synthesis processes of other materials based on the St&#246;ber process.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Diastereo&#8208; and Enantioselective Reductive Mannich&#8208;type Reaction of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;Unsaturated Carboxylic Acids to Ketimines: A Direct Entry to Unprotected &#946;2,3,3&#8208;Amino Acids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Stereoselective construction of unprotected &#946; &#8208;amino acids is a significant challenge owing to the lack of methods for the catalytic generation of highly enantioenriched carboxylic acid enolates. In this study, we developed a novel copper&#8208;catalyzed diastereo&#8208; and enantioselective reductive Mannich&#8208;type reaction of &#945;,&#946; &#8208;unsaturated carboxylic acids, which provides a direct and scalable synthetic method for enantioenriched &#946; 2,3,3 &#8208;amino acids with vicinal stereogenic centers. Our protocol features in situ generation of transiently protected carboxylic acids by a hydrosilane and their diastereo&#8208; and enantioselective reductive coupling with ketimines. The synthetic utility of this process was demonstrated by a gram&#8208;scale reaction and the transformation of &#946; &#8208;amino acids.</dc:description>

         <title>Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed Formylation of Unactivated Alkyl Chlorides to Aldehydes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The first rhodium&#8208;catalyzed formylation of&#160;non&#8208;activated alkyl chlorides with syn gas (H2/CO) allows to produce aldehydes in high yields (25 examples). A catalyst optimization study revealedRh(acac)(CO)2 in the presence of 1,3&#8208;bisdiphenylphosphinopropane (DPPP) as&#160;the most active catalyst system for this transformation. Key for the success of the reaction is the addition of sodium iodide (NaI) to the reaction system, which leads to the formation of activated alkyl iodides as intermediates. Depending on the reaction conditions, either the linear or branched aldehydes can be preferentially obtained, which is explained by a different mechanism.</dc:description>

         <title>Structure&#8208;Activity Relationships in Nucleic&#8208;Acid&#8208;Templated Vectors Based on Peptidic Dynamic Covalent Polymers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The use of nucleic acids as templates which can trigger the self&#8208;assembly of their own vectors represent an emerging, simple and versatile, approach toward the self&#8208;fabrication of tailored nucleic acids delivery vectors. However, the structure&#8208;activity relationships governing this complex templated self&#8208;assembly process that accompanies the complexation of nucleic acids remains poorly understood. Here, we studied the class of arginine&#8208;rich dynamic covalent polymers (DCPs) composed of different monomers varying the number and position of arginines. We describe the combinations that lead to nucleic acid complexation, in saline buffer, using different templates, from short siRNA to long DNA. Finally, we identify a successful peptidic DCP featuring six&#8208;arginine repeating unit that promote the safe and effective delivery of siRNA in live cancer cells.</dc:description>
