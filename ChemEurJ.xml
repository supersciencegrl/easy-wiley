         <title>Proton Conduction at High Temperature in High&#8208;Symmetry Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Molecular Crystals of RuIII Complexes with Six Imidazole&#8208;Imidazolate Ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new H&#8208;bonded crystal of [RuIII(Him)3(Im)3](1) with six HIm (imidazole) was prepared so as to obtain a high&#8208;temperature proton conductor. The crystal is constructed through N&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;N&#8722;H&#8208;bonds between the inter&#8208;RuIII complexes and has a rare Icy&#8208;c* cubic net without crystal anisotropy. The proton conductivity is due not only to rotations and hopping motions of HIm, but also induced by isotropic whole&#8208;molecule rotation of 1.







Abstract
A new H&#8208;bonded crystal [RuIII(Him)3(Im)3] with three imidazole (Him) and three imidazolate (Im&#8722;) groups was prepared to obtain a higher&#8208;temperature proton conductor than a Nafion membrane with water driving. The crystal is constructed by complementary N&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;N H&#8208;bonds between the RuIII complexes and has a rare Icy&#8208;c* cubic network topology with a twofold interpenetration without crystal anisotropy. The crystals show a proton conductivity of 3.08&#215;10&#8722;5&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 450&#8197;K and a faster conductivity than those formed by only HIms. The high proton conductivity is attributed to not only molecular rotations and hopping motions of HIm frameworks that are activated at &#8764;113&#8197;K, but also isotropic whole&#8208;molecule rotation of [RuIII(Him)3(Im)3] at temperatures greater than 420&#8197;K. The latter rotation was confirmed by solid&#8208;state 2H&#8197;NMR spectroscopy; probable proton conduction routes were predicted and theoretically considered.

         <title>Chemoselective Acylation of Nucleosides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chemoselective functionalization of oxygen atoms versus nitrogen atoms in bifunctional and polyfunctional molecules is a long&#8208;standing challenge in both fundamental chemistry and in complex molecule synthesis. Different conditions that allow high selectivity in the derivatization of complex nucleosides that contain both O&#8208; and N&#8208;based functionalities are described. Particularly intriguing cases are also presented, in which the reactivity of the O&#8208; and N&#8208;based functionalities is quite context dependent, exhibiting reactivity that blurs conventional considerations, yet where selectivity may also be observed.







Abstract
Acylated nucleoside analogues play an important role in medicinal chemistry and are extremely useful precursors to various other nucleoside analogues. However, chemoselective acylation of nucleosides usually requires several protection and deprotection steps due to the competing nucleophilicity of hydroxy and amino groups. In contrast, direct protecting&#8208;group&#8208;free chemoselective acylation of nucleosides is a preferred strategy due to lower cost and fewer overall synthetic steps. Herein, a simple and efficient chemoselective acylation of nucleosides and nucleotides under mild reaction conditions, giving either O&#8208; or N&#8208;acylated products respectively with excellent chemoselectivity is reported.

         <title>Pyrimidoquinazolinophenanthroline Opens Next Chapter in Design of Bridging Ligands for Artificial Photosynthesis
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new bridging ligand, namely pyrimidoquinazolinophenanthroline pqp, was successfully synthesized by a chemistry on the complex method using cross coupling and dehydrogenation reactions. The twisted geometry of pqp bridges the gap of already existing bridging ligands. Its photophysics can be significantly influenced by the introduction of a second metal center. Furthermore, light&#8208;induced redox catalysis was explored with a pqp&#8208;based dyad.







Abstract
The synthesis and detailed characterization of a new Ru polypyridine complex containing a heteroditopic bridging ligand with previously unexplored metal&#8208;metal distances is presented. Due to the twisted geometry of the novel ligand, the resultant division of the ligand in two distinct subunits leads to steady state as well as excited state properties of the corresponding mononuclear Ru(II) polypyridine complex resembling those of prototype [Ru(bpy)3]2+ (bpy=2,2'&#8208;bipyridine). The localization of the initially optically excited and the nature of the long&#8208;lived excited states on the Ru&#8208;facing ligand spheres is evaluated by resonance Raman and fs&#8208;TA spectroscopy, respectively, and supported by DFT and TDDFT calculations. Coordination of a second metal (Zn or Rh) to the available bis&#8208;pyrimidyl&#8208;like coordination sphere strongly influences the frontier orbitals, apparent by, for example, luminescence quenching. Thus, the new bridging ligand motif offers electronic properties, which can be adjusted by the nature of the second metal center. Using the heterodinuclear Ru&#8722;Rh complex, visible light&#8208;driven reduction of NAD+ to NADH was achieved, highlighting the potential of this system for photocatalytic applications.

         <title>Aggregation Modes of Chiral Diketopyrrolo[3,4&#8208;c]pyrrole Dyes in Solution and Thin Films</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The aggregation modes of four new chiral diketopyrrolo[3,4&#8208;c]pyrrole (DPP) dyes, functionalized with enantiopure alkyl groups from natural sources, were deeply investigated in condition of solution aggregation and thin films by electronic circular dichroism (ECD) spectroscopy. ECD revealed superior capability, compared to absorbance spectroscopy, to provide information on the aggregation modes and to detect the possible co&#8208;existence of multiple aggregation pathways.







Abstract
The chiroptical features of chiral diketopyrrolo[3,4&#8208;c]pyrrole (DPP) derivatives have been only marginally investigated to date. In this regard, we have synthesized ad hoc four chiral DPP dyes, functionalized with enantiopure alkyl groups from natural sources either on the lactam moieties or on the terminal positions of the &#960;&#8208;conjugated backbone, to promote an efficient self&#8208;assembly into chiral supramolecular structures. For each of them, the aggregation modes has been investigated by absorbance and ECD spectroscopies in conditions of solution aggregation and on thin films, considering the effects of deposition technique (drop casting vs. spin coating) and post&#8208;deposition operations (solvent and thermal annealing). The effect of the structure of lateral &#960;&#8208;conjugated units attached to the central DPP scaffold, as well as that of the position of the alkyl chiral group, has been assessed. ECD revealed superior capability, compared to absorbance spectroscopy, to provide information on the aggregation modes and to detect the possible co&#8208;existence of multiple aggregation pathways.

         <title>Reactivity of Primary Phosphines and Primary Phosphine Sulfides towards Imines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
To P(III) or not to P(III). A three&#8208;component mixture containing primary phosphine, chalcogen, and an imine affords a bis&#8208;&#945;&#8208;aminophosphine chalcogenide. Mechanistic studies show an interesting dichotomy between the relative reactivities of P(III) vs. P(V) species towards imines.







Abstract
Reactivity of primary phosphines with two stoichiometric equivalents of imine results in the formation of bis&#8208;&#945;&#8208;aminophosphines (2&#8201;a&#8211;e), which can be subsequently oxidized in the presence of S8 or H2O2 to generate air stable bis&#8208;&#945;&#8208;aminophosphine sulfides (2&#8201;b&#8211;m(S/O)). To elucidate the mechanism of this three&#8208;component reaction, Hammett analysis, kinetic isotope effect (KIE), and trapping experiments were performed. Ultimately a P(V)&#8211;P(III) tautomerization is invoked, followed by nucleophilic attack by the P(III) species to generate the desired products.

Tri&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;1,4,7&#8208;trioxophenalenyl neutral diradical undergoes a &#963;&#8208;dimerization, generating two types of &#963;&#8208;dimers immediately after the preparation. One of the &#963;&#8208;dimers is a close&#8208;shell dimer linked through double&#8208;&#963;&#8208;bonds, and the other one is a peroxy&#8208;linked open&#8208;shell dimer. These &#963;&#8208;dimers are in equilibrium in the solution state by the reversible &#963;&#8208;bond formation/cleavage via the neutral diradical as a key intermediate.







Abstract
A novel neutral diradical of &#960;&#8208;extended phenalenyl derivative having three oxo&#8208;groups, tri&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;1,4,7&#8208;trioxophenalenyl, and two types of the corresponding &#963;&#8208;dimers were investigated. Quantum chemical calculations showed that the neutral diradical is in triplet ground state having doubly degenerate singly occupied molecular orbitals. The neutral diradical undergoes a &#963;&#8208;dimerization, generating two types of &#963;&#8208;dimers immediately after the preparation. One of the &#963;&#8208;dimers, which was selectively generated in the crystalline state, was a close&#8208;shell dimer linked through double&#8208;&#963;&#8208;bonds on the phenalenyl skeleton with a long C&#8722;C bond length of 1.66&#8197;&#197;. The other &#963;&#8208;dimer, which existed only in the solution state, was a peroxy&#8208;linked open&#8208;shell dimer in which one &#963;&#8208;bond was formed between two oxygen atoms. Furthermore, the temperature&#8208;dependent 1H&#8197;NMR and ESR spectra revealed that these &#963;&#8208;dimers are in equilibrium in the solution state by the reversible &#963;&#8208;bond formation/cleavage via the neutral diradical as a key intermediate.

         <title>Coordination adaptable networks: zirconium(IV) carboxylates.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Vitrimers are 3D &#8220;covalent adaptable networks&#8221; (CANs) with flow properties thanks to thermally activated associative exchange reactions. The present contribution introduces coordination adaptable networks, or CooANs, that are topologically related to metal&#8208;organic frameworks with octahedral Zr  6  clusters as secondary building units in a carboxylic acid&#8208;functionalized acrylate&#8208;methacrylate copolymer matrix. A series of  Zr&#8208;CooAN&#8208;x  materials (x = percent of Zr  6  loading relative to maximum capacity) was synthesized with x = 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 50 and 100. The mechanical and rheological investigations demonstrate vitrimer&#8208;like properties for x up to 50, the crosslink migration being ensured by carboxylate ligand exchange, with relaxation becoming slower as the Zr  6  content is increased. The flow activation energy of  Zr&#8208;CooAN&#8208;10  is 92.9 &#177; 3.6 kJ mol  &#8208;1  . Rapid (30 min) hot&#8208;press reshaping occurs at temperatures in the 50&#8208;100 &#176;C range under a 3&#8208;ton pressure and does not significantly alter the material properties.</dc:description>

         <title>Mechanistic Studies for the Rational Design of Multivalent Glycodendrimers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We have synthesized B&#8208;antigen&#8208;displaying dendrimers (16&#8208;mers) with different sizes and evaluated their affinity to their IgM antibody in order to investigate which design features lead to effective multivalency. Unexpectedly, the smallest dendrimer, which cannot chelate the multiple binding sites of IgM, clearly exhibited multivalency, together with an affinity similar to or higher than those of the larger dendrimers. These results indicate that the statistical rebinding model, which involves the rapid exchange of clustered glycans, significantly contributes to the multivalency of glycodendrimers. Namely, in the design of glycodendrimers, high&#8208;density glycan presentation to enhance statistical rebinding should be considered in addition to the ability to chelate multiple binding sites. This notion stands in contrast to the currently prevailing scientific consensus, which prioritizes the chelation model. This study thus provides new and important guidelines for molecular design of glycodendrimers.</dc:description>

         <title>Controlling the Emissive, Chiroptical, and Electrochemical Properties of Double [7]Helicenes through Embedded Aromatic Rings</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We present here the synthesis and in&#8208;depth physicochemical characterization of a double hetero[7]helicene fused with four triazole rings at both helical ends. The comparison of this triazole&#8208;fused double helicene with the previously reported all&#8208;carbon and thiadiazole&#8208;fused analogs revealed the huge impact of the embedded aromatic rings on the photophysical features. The small structural variation of the terminal rings from thiadiazole to triazole caused a dramatic change of the photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQYs) from &lt;1% to 96%, while the replacement of the terminal benzene rings with triazole rings induced a tenfold enhancement of the circularly polarized luminescence dissymmetry factor. These observations were well corroborated with transient absorption analysis and/or theoretic calculations. In addition, the triazole&#8208;fused double helicene exhibited ambipolar redox behavior, enabling the generation of radical cation and anion species by electrochemical and chemical methods and showing its potential for spin&#8208;related applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Cage&#8208;Shaped Borates Bearing Pyrenylmethyl Groups: Efficient Lewis Acid Catalyst for Photoactivated Glycosylations Driven by Intramolecular Excimer Formation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We describe the synthesis and characterization of a photoactivated boron&#8208;based Lewis acid catalyst based on a cage&#8208;shaped triphenolic ligand with three pyrenylmethyl moieties. The obtained cage&#8208;shaped borate functioned as a photoactivated Lewis acid catalyst thanks to the flexible three pyrenylmethyl moieties. The deformation of the cage&#8208;shaped scaffold driven by intramolecular excimer formations of the pyrenes is a critical factor in realizing the photoactivation. Mannich&#8208;type reactions and glycosylations significantly were accelerated under 370 nm light irradiations. It is noteworthy that various glycosyl fluorides, which are not easily activated in photocatalytic systems due to their high C&#8210;F bond stability, are activated by the photoimproved catalytic activity of the catalyst.</dc:description>

         <title>A Chemically Fuelled Molecular Automaton Displaying Programmed Migration of Zn2+ Between Alternative Binding Sites</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A molecular system comprising a cationic zinc complex and an amino acid&#8208;derived ambident ligand having phosphate and carboxylate binding sites undergoes a series of rearrangements in which the metal cation migrates autonomously from one site to another. The location of the metal is identified by the circular dichroism spectrum of a ligated bis(2&#8208;quinolylmethyl)&#8208;(2&#8208;pyridylmethyl)amine (BQPA) chromophore, which takes a characteristic shape at each binding site. Migration is fuelled by the decomposition of trichloroacetic acid to CO2 and CHCl3 , which progressively neutralises the acidity of the system as a function of time, revealing in sequence binding sites of increasing basicity. The migration rate responds to control by variation of the temperature, water content and triethylamine concentration, while an excess of fuel controls the duration of an induction period before the migration event.</dc:description>

         <title>Two Paths to Oxidative C&#8722;H Amination Under Basic Conditions: A Theoretical Case Study Reveals Hidden Opportunities Provided by Electron Upconversion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Traditionally, cross&#8208;dehydrogenative coupling (CDC) leads to C&#8722;N bond formation under basic and oxidative conditions and is proposed to proceed via a two&#8208;electron bond formation mediated by carbenium ions. However, the formation of such high&#8208;energy intermediates is only possible in the presence of strong oxidants, which may lead to undesired side reactions and poor functional group tolerance. In this work, we explore if oxidation under basic conditions allows the formation of three&#8208;electron bonds (resulting in &#8220;upconverted&#8221; highly reducing radical&#8208;anions). The benefit of this &#8220;upconversion&#8221; process is in the ability to use milder oxidants (e.g., O  2  ) and to avoid high&#8208;energy intermediates. Comparison of the two&#8208; and three&#8208;electron pathways using quantum mechanical calculations reveals that not only does the absence of a strong oxidant shut down two&#8208;electron pathways in favor of a three&#8208;electron path but, paradoxically, weaker oxidants react faster with the upconverted reductants by avoiding the Marcus inverted region for electron transfer.</dc:description>

         <title>Structure of Zinc and Nickel Histidine Complexes in Solution Revealed by Molecular Dynamics and Raman Optical Activity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The histidine residue has an exceptional affinity for metals, but solution structure of its complexes are difficult to study. For zinc and nickel, we used Raman and Raman optical activity (ROA) spectroscopies to investigate the link between spectral shapes and the geometry. The spectra were measured and interpreted on the basis of ionic equilibria, molecular dynamics, ab initio molecular dynamics, and density functional theory. For zwitterionic histidine the dominant tautomer was determined by the decomposition of experimental spectra into calculated subspectra. An octahedral structure was found to prevail for the ZnHis  2  complex in solution, in contrast to a tetrahedral arrangement in the crystal phase. The solution geometry of NiHis  2  is more similar to the octahedral structure found by x&#8208;ray. The Raman and ROA structural determinations of metal complexes are dependent on extensive computations, but reveal unique information about the studied systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Phosphorescence Induction by Host&#8208;Guest Complexation with Cyclodextrins &#8211; The Role of Regioisomerism and Affinity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Water&#8208;soluble aromatic thioethers reveal orange phosphorescence emission upon the formation of 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 inclusion complexes with &#947;&#8208;cyclodextrin, which was proven by state of the art photophysical characterisations as well as ITC&#8208;, NMR&#8208; and fluorescence titration&#8208;measurements supported by molecular dynamics simulations. It was found that not only the binding affinity but also the orientation of the guest in and around the cavity is crucial to restrict motion able to induce the emission.







Abstract
We present an in&#8208;depth investigation of cyclodextrin complexes with guest compounds featuring complexation&#8208;induced room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) in aqueous solution. Very interestingly, only the complexed regioisomers bearing lateral substituents on meta&#8208;position show RTP, whereas the stronger host&#8208;guest systems with para&#8208;substituted dyes show no RTP features. The reported systems were investigated regarding their complexation behavior in water using isothermal titration calorimetry and mass spectrometry. In the case of &#947;&#8208;CD very strong 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 inclusion complexes (Ka up to 5.13&#215;105&#8197;M&#8722;1) were unexpectedly observed. It was found that not only a strong binding to the cyclodextrin cavity is needed to restrict motion, inducing the emission, but also the conformation inside the cavity plays a pivotal role &#8211; as supported by an extensive NMR study and MD simulations.

&lt;p&gt;Water-soluble aromatic thioethers reveal orange phosphorescence emission upon the formation of 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 inclusion complexes with &#947;-cyclodextrin, which was proven by state of the art photophysical characterisations as well as ITC-, NMR- and fluorescence titration-measurements supported by molecular dynamics simulations. It was found that not only the binding affinity but also the orientation of the guest in and around the cavity is crucial to restrict motion able to induce the emission.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We present an in-depth investigation of cyclodextrin complexes with guest compounds featuring complexation-induced room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) in aqueous solution. Very interestingly, only the complexed regioisomers bearing lateral substituents on meta-position show RTP, whereas the stronger host-guest systems with para-substituted dyes show no RTP features. The reported systems were investigated regarding their complexation behavior in water using isothermal titration calorimetry and mass spectrometry. In the case of &#947;-CD very strong 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 inclusion complexes (K&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; up to 5.13&#215;10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;&#8197;M&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) were unexpectedly observed. It was found that not only a strong binding to the cyclodextrin cavity is needed to restrict motion, inducing the emission, but also the conformation inside the cavity plays a pivotal role &#8211; as supported by an extensive NMR study and MD simulations.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Electrocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution Using A Molecular Antimony Complex under Aqueous Conditions: An Experimental and Computational Study on Main&#8208;Group Element Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An antimony complex was synthesized and heterogenized onto a carbon paper electrode surface. This system is capable of electrocatalytically evolving hydrogen gas under aqueous acidic conditions with high activity and efficiency. The stability of the heterogenized complex was confirmed by XPS of the used electrode surface and ICP&#8208;MS of the post catalysis electrolyte. Computational kinetic studies suggest that the generation of hydrogen&#8208;catalyst adduct is a rate&#8208;limiting step.







Abstract
Electrocatalytic hydrogen gas production is considered a potential pathway towards carbon&#8208;neutral energy sources. However, the development of this technology is hindered by the lack of efficient, cost&#8208;effective, and environmentally benign catalysts. In this study, a main&#8208;group&#8208;element&#8208;based electrocatalyst, SbSalen, is reported to catalyze the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in an aqueous medium. The heterogenized molecular system achieved a Faradaic efficiency of 100&#8201;% at &#8722;1.4&#8197;V vs. NHE with a maximum current density of &#8722;30.7&#8197;mA/cm2. X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy of the catalyst&#8208;bound working electrode before and after electrolysis confirmed the molecular stability during catalysis. The turnover frequency was calculated as 43.4&#8197;s&#8722;1 using redox&#8208;peak integration. The kinetic and mechanistic aspects of the electrocatalytic reaction were further examined by computational methods. This study provides mechanistic insights into main&#8208;group&#8208;element electrocatalysts for heterogeneous small&#8208;molecule conversion.

Select and separate: Two novel dicarboxyimide/imino&#8208;based organic cages are proposed as materials for the selective separation of CO2 from N2 and CH4 under vacuum swing adsorption conditions. Robust mixed&#8208;matrix membranes for gas separation were also obtained by loading the cages in either Matrimid&#174; or PEEK&#8208;WC as polymers. An improvement in the gas&#8208;transport properties is achieved compared to that of neat polymer membranes.







Abstract
Two novel imide/imine&#8208;based organic cages have been prepared and studied as materials for the selective separation of CO2 from N2 and CH4 under vacuum swing adsorption conditions. Gas adsorption on the new compounds showed selectivity for CO2 over N2 and CH4. The cages were also tested as fillers in mixed&#8208;matrix membranes for gas separation. Dense and robust membranes were obtained by loading the cages in either Matrimid&#174; or PEEK&#8208;WC polymers. Improved gas&#8208;transport properties and selectivity for CO2 were achieved compared to the neat polymer membranes.

Alkenyl cyclopropyl ketones tethered to (hetero)arenes readily underwent catalytic, intramolecular interrupted homo&#8208;Nazarov cascade biscyclizations to form 6,6,6&#8208;, 6,5,6&#8208;, 6,6,5&#8208;, 6,6,6,5&#8208;, and 6,6,5,6&#8208;fused angular architectures. The approach was used for the concise total synthesis of (&#177;)&#8208;1&#8208;oxoferruginol, a bioactive abietane diterpenoid.







Abstract
Herein, a SnCl4&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular, interrupted homo&#8208;Nazarov cascade biscyclization to access angular (hetero)aryl&#8208;fused polycycles is reported. Subsequent decarboxylation of the readily enolizable products afforded the angular products in up to 71&#8201;% yield over two steps, with the trans&#8208;diastereomers as the major products. The cyclopropyl homo&#8208;Nazarov cyclization precursors were formed using a scalable and modular synthetic route that, ultimately, offers access to 6,6,6&#8208;, 6,6,5&#8208;, 6,5,6&#8208;, 6,6,5,6&#8208;, and 6,6,6,5&#8208;fused angular polycyclic products. To showcase the rigor and utility of the method, an 8&#8208;step total synthesis of (&#177;)&#8208;1&#8208;oxoferruginol, an antibacterial aromatic abietane diterpenoid, was disclosed.

         <title>Atmospheric&#8208;Temperature Chain Reaction towards Ultrathin Non&#8208;Crystal&#8208;Phase Construction for Highly Efficient Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multistep chain reaction at atmospheric temperature restructures the surface of high&#8208;crystallinity cobalt carbonate hydroxides (CCHs). An ultrathin (&#8764;5&#8197;nm) lattice&#8208;disorder layer of Fe(OH)3 on the CCH appeared to form CCH&#8722;FeOH hetero&#8208;interfaces, which are of great benefit for nano&#8208;interface exposure. The microscopic surface morphology of the material (CCH&#8722;FeOH&#8208;Dx) can be controlled by adjusting the degree of chain reaction. The as&#8208;obtained CCH&#8722;FeOH with an ultrathin shell structure is conducive to mass transfer and ion migration, giving excellent HER/OER performance.







Abstract
Combining the self&#8208;sacrifice of a highly crystalline substance to design a multistep chain reaction towards ultrathin active&#8208;layer construction for high&#8208;performance water splitting with atmospheric&#8208;temperature conditions and an environmentally benign aqueous environment is extremely intriguing and full of challenges. Here, taking cobalt carbonate hydroxides (CCHs) as the initial crystalline material, we choose the Lewis acid metal salt of Fe(NO3)3 to induce an aqueous&#8208;phase chain reaction generating free CO32&#8722; ions with subsequent instant FeCO3 hydrolysis. The resultant ultrathin (&#8764;5&#8197;nm) amorphous Fe&#8208;based hydroxide layer on CCH results in considerable activity in catalyzing the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), yielding 10/50&#8197;mA&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at overpotentials of 230/266.5&#8197;mV for OER and 72.5/197.5&#8197;mV for HER. The catalysts can operate constantly in 1.0&#8197;M KOH over 48 and 45&#8197;h for the OER and HER, respectively. For bifunctional catalysis for alkaline electrolyzer assembly, a cell voltage as low as 1.53&#8197;V was necessary to yield 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 (1.7&#8197;V at 50&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2). This work rationally builds high&#8208;efficiency electrochemical bifunctional water&#8208;splitting catalysts and offers a trial in establishing a controllable nanolevel ultrathin lattice disorder layer through an atmospheric&#8208;temperature chemical route.

     alt="Atmospheric-Temperature Chain Reaction towards Ultrathin Non-Crystal-Phase Construction for Highly Efficient Water Splitting"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A multistep chain reaction&lt;/b&gt; at atmospheric temperature restructures the surface of high-crystallinity cobalt carbonate hydroxides (CCHs). An ultrathin (&#8764;5&#8197;nm) lattice-disorder layer of Fe(OH)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; on the CCH appeared to form CCH&#8722;FeOH hetero-interfaces, which are of great benefit for nano-interface exposure. The microscopic surface morphology of the material (CCH&#8722;FeOH-D&lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;) can be controlled by adjusting the degree of chain reaction. The as-obtained CCH&#8722;FeOH with an ultrathin shell structure is conducive to mass transfer and ion migration, giving excellent HER/OER performance.
&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Metal&#8208;Mediated Directional Capping of Rod&#8208;Packing Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Based on structural analysis of newly synthesized 3D rod&#8208;packing manganese&#8208;based framework, strategic design of capping agent was developed to obtain a 2D rod&#8208;packing framework. SQUID measurements and DFT calculations proved ferrimagnetic ordering of the material below 8&#8197;K, further illustrating the potential of developing spintronic materials through 2D rod&#8208;packing MOFs







Abstract
Two new rod&#8208;packing metal&#8211;organic frameworks (RPMOF) are constructed by regulating the in situ formation of the capping agent. In CPM&#8208;s7, carboxylate linkers extend 1D manganese&#8208;oxide chains in four additional directions, forming 3D RPMOF. The substitution of Mn2+ with a stronger Lewis acidic Co2+, leads to an acceleration of the hydrolysis&#8208;prone sulfonate linker, resulting in presence of sulfate ions to reduce two out of the four carboxylate&#8208;extending directions, and thus forming a new 2D rod&#8208;packing CPM&#8208;s8. Density functional theory calculations and magnetization measurements reveal ferrimagnetic ordering of CPM&#8208;s8, signifying the potential of exploring 2D RPMOF for effective low&#8208;dimensional magnetic materials.

         <title>An Introduction to the Combustion of Carbon Materials</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Looking back over centuries of research on carbon combustion, this reaction has literally fuelled the development of mankind and truly astonishing technological advancement. Carbon combustion is complex and interplay of different limitations such as diffusion, heat/mass transfer, and reactivity of active sites is observed. The understanding and a unifying concept of carbon combustion may prove to be valuable also for the understanding of novel carbon nanomaterials, such as fibres or graphene like materials.







Abstract
Combustion is arguably as old as homo sapiens ability to observe and use fire. Despite the long tradition of using carbon combustion for energy production, this reaction is still not fully understood. This can be related to several facts that are intertwined and complicate the investigation, such as the large variety of possible carbon structures, the actual surface structure, porosity, the solid&#8208;gas nature of this reaction, diffusion limitation and fundamental reaction steps. In this review, a brief history of carbon combustion science is given, followed by a detailed discussion of the most important aspects of carbon combustion. Special attention is given to limitations for example diffusion. In carbon combustion, kinetic control can rarely be observed. The literature of the fundamental reaction steps actually occurring on the carbon framework is reviewed and it becomes apparent that the reaction is occurring primarily on defects on the basal plane. Thus, the reaction between oxygen and carbon may be used as an analytical tool to provide further insights into novel materials, for example synthetic carbon materials, fibres and graphene type materials. Mastering the combustion reaction in all its complexity may prove to be very valuable in the future.

         <title>Coassembly of Chiral Amines and a Four&#8208;Armed Cyano&#8208;Substituted Luminophore through Hydrogen bonds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chirality transfer from chiral molecules to assemblies is of vital importance to the design of functional chiral materials. In this work, we report the selective co&#8208;assembly behaviors between chiral molecules and an achiral luminophore, potentially driven by the intermolecular salt&#8208;bridge type hydrogen bonds. Cyano&#8208;substituted tetrakis(arylthio)benzene carboxylic acid (  TA  ) served as the luminophore and hydrogen bond donors, which underwent co&#8208;assembly with different chiral amines. It was found that structures of chiral amines affect the chirality transfer and the properties of coassemblies due to effects on hydrogen bonds and stacking pattern. Only in specific co&#8208;assemblies, the chiroptical properties occurred at both ground state and excited states based on the emerged Cotton effects and circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) signals, revealing the chirality successfully transferred from molecular level to supramolecular level. In addition, accurate quantitative examination of chiral amines was realized by circular dichroism (CD) spectra. This work demonstrates the characteristic chirality response and transfer  via  co&#8208;assembly, providing a potential method to develop smart chiroptical materials.</dc:description>

         <title>An encapsulated neutral ruthenium catalyst for substrateselective oxidation of alcohols</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The neutral complex dichloro&#8208;{diethyl[(5&#8208;phenyl&#8208;1,3,4oxadiazol&#8208;2&#8208;ylamino)&#8208;(4&#8208;trifluoro&#8208;methylphenyl)methyl]phosphonate} ( p &#8208;cymene)&#8208;ruthenium(II) was encapsulated inside a self&#8208;assembled hexameric host obtained upon reaction of 2,8,14,20&#8208;tetra&#8208;undecylresorcin[4]arene with water. The formation of an inclusion complex was inferred from a combination of spectral measurements (MS, UVvisible spectroscopy, 1 H and DOSY NMR). The 31 P and 19 F NMR spectra are consistent with motions of the ruthenium complex inside the self&#8208;assembled capsule. Molecular dynamics simulations carried out on the inclusion complex confirmed these intra&#8208;cavity movements and highlighted possible supramolecular interactions between the ruthenium first coordination sphere ligands and the inner&#8208;part (aromatic rings) of the capsule. The embedded ruthenium complex was assessed in the catalytic oxidation (using NaIO 4 as oxidant) of mixtures of three arylmethyl alcohols into the corresponding aldehydes. The reaction kinetics were shown to vary as a function of the substrates' size, with the oxidation rate varying in the order benzylalcohol &gt; 4&#8208;phenyl&#8208;benzylalcohol &gt; 9&#8208;anthracenemethanol. Control experiments realized in the absence of hexameric capsule did not allow any discrimination between the substrates.</dc:description>

Three protein&#8208;DNA conjugates were designed to calibrate the protein modification abilities of catalyst&#8208;functionalized DNA. For two catalysts, a clear correlation between distance and efficiency was found and both linker between DNA and protein as well as position and type of catalyst influenced the site of modification. Computational simulations were used to corroborate the findings.







Abstract
Many biomedical fields rely on proteins that are selectively modified. These can be attached using reactive or catalytic moieties, but the position where these moieties are attached is often poorly controlled. We assessed how catalyst position affects the efficiency and selectivity of protein modification. For this, we anchored a template DNA strand to three different proteins, which were subsequently hybridized to DNA strands that contained catalysts at different positions. We found a strong correlation between the catalyst&#8208;to&#8208;protein distance and the efficiency of protein modification for acyl transfer catalysts, which operate via a covalently bound reactant intermediate. Additionally, we found that the catalyst's distance and orientation with respect to the protein surface, also influences its site&#8208;selectivity. A catalyst operating with unbound reactant intermediates showed only enhanced efficiency. Our results are rationalized using computational simulations, showing that one&#8208;point anchoring of the DNA construct leads to notable differences in the site of modification.

         <title>Redox&#8208;Induced Structural Change in Artificial Heterometallic&#8208;Oxide Cluster Mimicking the Photosynthetic Oxygen&#8208;Evolving Center</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
To understand the chemical principle of the photosynthetic oxygen&#8208;evolving center (OEC), we report two (Mn3XO4)2O&#8208;clusters (X=Sr2+, La3+) closely mimicking both the heterometallic&#8208;oxide cubane and all types of oxide bridges in OEC. Structural comparison of both oxidized and reduced forms of the (Mn3LaO4)2O&#8208;cluster indicates that the reactive site is the &#956;2&#8208;oxide bridge rather than the &#956;4&#8208;oxide or &#956;3&#8208;oxide bridges in the cluster.







Abstract
The oxygen&#8208;evolving center (OEC) in photosynthesis is a unique Mn4CaO5&#8208;cluster that catalyzes the water&#8208;splitting reaction in nature. Understanding its catalytic mechanism for the O=O bond formation is of great challenge and long&#8208;standing issue, which is severely restricted by the lack of precise structure and mechanism mimics of this heterometallic&#8208;oxide cluster. Herein, we report two synthetic (Mn3XO4)2O&#8208;clusters (X=Sr2+, La3+) that closely mimic the heterometallic&#8208;oxide Mn3XO4 cubane and three different types of &#956;&#8208;oxide bridges (&#956;2&#8208;O2&#8722;, &#956;3&#8208;O2&#8722;, and &#956;4&#8208;O2&#8722;) simultaneously as seen in the OEC. By resolving the crystal structures of both oxidized and reduced forms of the cluster, we have identified significant redox&#8208;induced structural changes that take place on the &#956;2&#8208;oxide bridge, rather than the &#956;4&#8208;oxide or &#956;3&#8208;oxide bridges. Our results provide chemical insights into understanding the reactivity of three different types of oxide bridges in the biological Mn4CaO5&#8208;cluster in PSII.

         <title>Muon Spin Rotation/Resonance (&#956;SR) for Studying Radical Reactivity of Unsaturated Organophosphorus Compounds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The positive muon (&#956;+) can be regarded as a light isotope of proton and has been useful for study of radical reactions of organic compounds through formation of muonium (Mu=[&#956;+e&#8211;]). This article overviews the Muon Spin Rotation/Resonance (&#956;SR) studies of the phosphorus congeners of alkenes, anthracenes, and cyclobutane&#8208;1,3&#8208;diyls. The hydrogen surrogate enabled characterization of the regioselective radical additions producing the particular paramagnetic organophosphorus molecules.







Abstract
The positive muon (&#956;+) can be regarded as a light isotope of proton and has been an important tool to study radical reactions of organic compounds. Recently, muons have been applied to produce short&#8208;lived paramagnetic species from the heavier unsaturated organic molecules including the p&#8208;block elements. This article overviews recent muon spin rotation/resonance (&#956;SR) studies on the phosphorus analogs of alkenes, anthracenes, and cyclobutane&#8208;1,3&#8208;diyls together with the fundamentals of &#956;SR. The acyclic phosphaalkene of P=C and phosphasilenes of P=Si can accept muonium (Mu=[&#956;+e&#8722;]) at the heavier double bonds, and the corresponding radicals have been characterized. The phosphorus atom in 9&#8208;phosphaanthracene, whose P=C double bond is stabilized by the peri&#8208;substituted CF3 groups, predominantly captures muonium to provide the corresponding paramagnetic fused heterocyclic system. The peri&#8208;trifluoromethyl groups are functional to promote the unprecedented light isotope effect of muon providing the planar three&#8208;cyclic molecular structure to consume the increased zero&#8208;point energy. The formally open&#8208;shell singlet 1,3&#8208;diphosphacyclobutane&#8208;2,4&#8208;diyl unit can accept muonium at the (ylidic) phosphorus or the skeletal radicalic carbon, and the corresponding paramagnetic phosphorus heterocycles can be characterized by &#956;SR. The findings on these muoniation processes to the unsaturated phosphorus&#8208;containing compounds will contribute not only to development of novel paramagnetic functional species but also to progress on muon science.

         <title>Suppression of Liquid&#8211;Liquid Phase Separation and Aggregation of Antibodies by Modest Pressure Application</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high colloidal stability is important for pharmaceutical applications of antibody solutions. We demonstrate a high pressure sensitivity of antibody condensates as a suitable means to suppress liquid&#8211;liquid phase separation and subsequent aggregation of concentrated antibody solutions. The immunoglobulin molecules themselves are highly pressure resistant against unfolding, however, and can sustain high pressures without changing conformation. More information can be found in the Research Article by R. Winter and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202201658).

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
How to activate a Re&#8722;CO bond: Carbon monoxide&#8208;releasing molecules (CORMs) have attracted significant attention because of the vasorelaxation effect of CO. When a phthalocyanine ligand was used, the Re&#8722;CO bonds were successfully activated by a low&#8208;energy photon of red light, which can penetrate deeply into living tissues. Thus, this study provides key insights and a foundation for designing photoCORMs for biological or therapeutic applications. More information can be found in the Research Article by M. Kato, K. Onda, K. Ishii, and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202200716).

         <title>Surface Engineering of Conjugated Polybenzothiadiazoles and Integration with Cobalt Oxides for Photocatalytic Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Conjugated polybenzothiadiazoles thermally treated by a hydrolysis process present high hydrophilicity and low water absorption energy, which enable excellent photocatalytic water oxidation performance and stability.







Abstract
Conjugated polymers feature promising structure and properties for photocatalytic water splitting. Herein, a hydrolysis strategy was demonstrated to rationally modulate the surface hydrophilicity and band structures of conjugated poly&#8208;benzothiadiazoles. High hydrophilicity not only enhances the dispersions of polymeric solids in an aqueous solution but also reduces the absorption energy of water molecules. Besides, both theoretical and experimental results reveal that a more positive valence band potential is generated, which contributes to enhancing the photocatalytic water oxidation performance. Accordingly, the surface&#8208;modified conjugated polymers show largely promoted photocatalytic water oxidation activities by deposition of cobalt oxides as cocatalysts.

&lt;p&gt;Conjugated polymers feature promising structure and properties for photocatalytic water splitting. Herein, a hydrolysis strategy was demonstrated to rationally modulate the surface hydrophilicity and band structures of conjugated poly-benzothiadiazoles. High hydrophilicity not only enhances the dispersions of polymeric solids in an aqueous solution but also reduces the absorption energy of water molecules. Besides, both theoretical and experimental results reveal that a more positive valence band potential is generated, which contributes to enhancing the photocatalytic water oxidation performance.

         <title>Dissecting Noncovalent Interactions in Carboxyl&#8208;Functionalized Ionic Liquids Exhibiting Double and Single Hydrogens Bonds Between Ions of Like Charge</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Like&#8208;charge attraction is observed for carboxyl&#8208;functionalized ionic liquids. In the solid state, doubly hydrogen&#8208;bonded cationic dimers dominate. In the liquid, these structural motifs are replaced by single hydrogen bonds between like&#8208; and oppositely charged ions. Combining X&#8208;ray crystallography, IR spectroscopy, thermodynamic methods and DFT calculations allows all types of hydrogen bonding in the solid, liquid and gaseous states of the ionic liquid to be analyzed and characterized. More information can be found in the Research Article by R. Ludwig and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202200949).

         <dc:description>
Dwarfs are shown fixing two rhodium atoms into the skeleton of 21,23&#8208;dirhodaporphyrin, the first [18]porphyrin to incorporate two metal atoms within its macrocyclic frame, in place of two core nitrogen donors. The 18&#8208;&#960;&#8208;electron aromatic circuit is maintained, playing a crucial role in stabilizing the macrocycle, and enforcing the metal centers&#8242; proximity. These small metal sculptures of dwarfs are a tourist attraction scattered around Wroc&#322;aw, the city in Poland where the dirhodaporphyrin was synthesized. More information can be found in the Research Article by E. Pacholska&#8208;Dudziak and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202201513).

         <title>Mechanistic Insights about the Ligand&#8208;Enabled Oxy&#8208;arylation/vinylation of Alkenes via Au(I)/Au(III) Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The mechanism of oxy&#8208;arylation/vinylation of alkenes catalyzed by the (MeDalphos)AuCl complex  was comprehensively investigated by DFT. (P,N)Au(Ph)  2+  and (P,N)Au(vinyl)  2+  are key intermediates accounting for the activation of the alkenols and for their cyclization by outer&#8208;sphere nucleophilic attack of oxygen. The 5&#8208;  exo  and 6&#8208;  endo  paths have been computed and compared, reproducing the peculiar regioselectivity difference observed experimentally between  4&#8208;penten&#8208;1&#8208;ol, (  E  ) and (  Z  )&#8208;4&#8208;hexen&#8208;1&#8208;ols. Examining the way the alkenol coordinates to gold (more  h  2  or  h  1  ) can offer, in some cases, a simple way to predict the favoured path of cyclization.</dc:description>

Formally, the &#960;&#8208;conjugated systems of the pristine azaborole helicenes were enlarged with a phenanthrene unit leading to compounds with large Stokes shifts, significantly enhanced luminescence quantum yields (&#1060;) and dissymmetry factors (  g  lum  ). The beneficial effect on optical properties was also observed for helical elongation. The combined contributions of lateral and helical extensions resulted in a compound showing green emission with F of 0.31 and |  g  lum  | of 2.2&#160;&#215;&#160;10  &#8209;3  , highest within the series of &#960;&#8208;extended azaborahelicenes and superior to emission intensity and chiroptical response of its non&#8208;extended congener. This study shows that helical and lateral extensions of &#960;&#8208;conjugated systems are viable strategies to improve features of azaborole helicenes.

         <dc:description>A series of near&#8208;infrared (NIR) organic absorbers, named FNs and FPs, have been obtained with absorption maxima from 870 nm to 1100 nm and thus falling into the attractive second near&#8208;infrared region (NIR&#8208;II). The synthesis of their extended aromatic cores utilized an initial aryl&#8208;amination between 4&#8208;aminonaphthalene&#8208;1,8&#8208;dicarboximide (NMI&#8208;NH2) or 9&#8208;aminoperylene&#8208;3,4&#8208;dicarboximide (PMI&#8208;NH2) with chloro&#8208;substituted 9,10&#8208;anthraquinones followed by a novel base&#8208;induced cyclodehydrogenation. A NIR&#8208;II pigment, compound FPP, was obtained through de&#8208;alkylation of a soluble precursor. The synthesis of this photostable pigment is high&#8208;yielding and avoids column chromatographic purification which is important for many applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Molecular design of silicon&#8208;containing diazenes: absorbance of E and Z isomers in near&#8208;infrared region</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The effective use of photochromic systems based on azo compounds in a number of applications, especially biomedical and pharmacological ones, is impeded by the unresolved problem of their  E  &#8646;  Z  isomerization in the near&#8208;IR region, NIR (780&#8208;1400 nm). We have demonstrated at the TD&#8208;DFT, STEOM&#8208;DLPNO&#8208;CCSD and CASSCF&#8208;NEVPT2 levels of theory that the presence of a silylated diazene core &#8208;Si&#8208;N=N&#8208;Si&#8208; with three&#8208;, tetra&#8208; or five&#8208;coordinated silicon atoms practically guarantees the absorption of the  E  and  Z  forms of such derivatives in NIR and the amazing (185&#8208;400 nm) separation of their first absorption bands. In particular, the maximum  &#955;  1  of the first n&#8594;&#960;* band of the  E  isomer of azosilabenzene  ASiB  is at ~1030 nm, while for the  Z  isomer  &#955;  1  &#8773; 1340 nm. Based on the found bistable azo compounds (  ASiB  , bis(silyl)&#8208;  SiD  and bis(silatranyl)&#8208;  SaD  diazenes) and their derivatives with  E  and  Z  absorption in NIR, unique photoswitches can be created for a number of applications, in particular, for photothermal therapy.</dc:description>

         <title>Iron&#8208;Catalyzed Cross&#8208;Coupling of Thioesters and Organomanganese Reagents</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report a Fukuyama&#8208;type coupling of thioesters with aliphatic organomanganese reagents utilizing a cheap and easily available iron(III) precatalyst. The reactions exhibit a wide tolerance of solvents and functional groups, allowing for the conversion of thioesters derived from natural products and pharmaceutical compounds. A strong steric impact from each reaction component (carboxylic moiety, thiol substituent and manganese reagent) was displayed, which enabled regioselective transformation of dithioesters. Mechanistic investigations showed that the released thiolate does not act as a mere spectator ligand, but rather positively influences the stability of intermediate alkyl(II)ferrates.</dc:description>

         <title>Construction of Photo&#8208;Responsive Pd2L4 Type Nanocage based on Feringa&#8217;s Second&#8208;Generation Motor and Its Guest Binding Ability for C60</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We present the construction of a M  2  L  4  type metal&#8208;organic nanocage featuring four endohedral Feringa&#8217;s motor motifs and its adaptive encapsulation towards C  60  guest molecule. The structure of the cage, though complicated on the  1  H NMR spectrum due to the adoption of mixed ligands, was unambiguously characterized with a combination of ESI&#8208;MS, 2D DOSY,  13  C NMR and particularly the SAXS technique. The molecular motor within the cage demonstrated similar photophysical properties to the uncoordinated one, indicating the motor&#8217;s function was not compromised when it was anchored in such a confined nanospace. Furthermore, the nanocage showed good guest encapsulation ability towards C  60  , and a guest induced&#8208;fit behavior of the cage was revealed based on the extensive SAXS analysis and molecular dynamics simulation. The adaptive motorized nanocage reported here represents one of the very few examples of integrating individual motors into a discrete nanoconfined system and offers prospects to achieve its non&#8208;equilibrium functions.</dc:description>

         <title>Discovery of Complex Binding and Reaction Mechanisms from Ternary Gases in Rare Earth Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Understanding the selectivity of metal organic frameworks (MOFs) to complex acid gas streams will enable their use in industrial applications. Herein, ab initio molecular dynamic simulations (AIMD) were used to simulate ternary gas mixtures (H  2  O&#8208;NO  2  &#8208;SO  2  )&#160;in rare earth 2,5&#8208;dihydroxyterephthalic acid (RE&#8208;DOBDC) MOFs. Stronger H  2  O gas&#8208;metal binding arose from thermal vibrations in the MOF sterically hindering access of SO  2  and NO  2  molecules to the metal sites. Gas&#8208;gas and gas&#8208;linker interactions within the MOF framework resulted in the formation of multiple secondary gas species including HONO, HNO  2  , NOSO, and HNO  3  &#8208;  . Four gas adsorption sites were identified along with a new de&#8208;protonation reaction mechanism not observable through experiment. This study not only provides valuable information on competitive gas binding energies in the MOF, it also provides important chemical insights into transient chemical reactions and mechanisms.</dc:description>

         <title>Photocatalytic E&#8594;Z Contra&#8208;Thermodynamic Isomerization of Vinyl Silanes with Lewis Base</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The contra&#8208;thermodynamic E&#8594;Z isomerization of vinyl silanes was reported using rac&#8208;BINAP as the photocatalyst. This reaction proceeds via the in situ formation of a chromophoric species, in the presence of catalyst. Under irradiation at 405&#8197;nm the interconversion of E&#8208;isomers into the Z&#8208;congeners were carried out in good to excellent yields and outstanding Z/E selectivities (18 examples) and the reaction mechanism was studied.







Abstract
Herein, we disclosed the contra&#8208;thermodynamic E&#8594;Z isomerization of alkenyl silanes, according to the in situ formation of a chromophoric species, in the presence of rac&#8208;BINAP as the catalyst. The reaction carried out in DMSO or CH3CN under irradiation at 405&#8197;nm allowed the interconversion of the E&#8208;isomers into the Z&#8208;congeners in good to excellent yields and outstanding Z/E selectivities, on 18 examples. Finally, the mechanism of this E&#8594;Z isomerization was studied to get insight into the reaction mechanism.

         <title>Selective Iron Catalyzed Synthesis of N&#8208;Alkylated Indolines and Indoles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In contrast to classical iron&#8208;catalyzed C3&#8208;alkylations of indoles via the borrowing&#8208;hydrogen methodology, this contribution describes the switch of the selectivity towards N&#8208;alkylation. Starting from indolines, N&#8208;alkylation was efficiently done using a tricarbonyl(cyclopentadienone) iron complex as the catalyst in 2,2,2&#8208;trifluoroethanol. Notably, performing the one pot N&#8208;alkylation of indolines, followed by oxidation using a FeBr3/TEMPO catalyst with t&#8208;BuOOH, the corresponding N&#8208;alkylated indoles were obtained.







Abstract
Whereas iron catalysts usually promote catalyzed C3&#8208;alkylation of indole derivatives via a borrowing&#8208;hydrogen methodology using alcohols as the electrophilic partners, this contribution shows how to switch the selectivity towards N&#8208;alkylation. Thus, starting from indoline derivatives, N&#8208;alkylation was efficiently performed using a tricarbonyl(cyclopentadienone) iron complex as the catalyst in trifluoroethanol in the presence of alcohols leading to the corresponding N&#8208;alkylated indoline derivatives in 31&#8211;99&#8201;% yields (28&#8197;examples). The one&#8208;pot, two&#8208;step strategy for the selective N&#8208;alkylation of indolines is completed by an oxidation to give the corresponding N&#8208;alkylated indoles in 31&#8211;90&#8201;% yields (15&#8197;examples).

     alt="Selective Iron Catalyzed Synthesis of N-Alkylated Indolines and Indoles"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;In contrast to classical iron-catalyzed&lt;/b&gt; C3-alkylations of indoles via the borrowing-hydrogen methodology, this contribution describes the switch of the selectivity towards N-alkylation. Starting from indolines, N-alkylation was efficiently done using a tricarbonyl(cyclopentadienone) iron complex as the catalyst in 2,2,2-trifluoroethanol. Notably, performing the one pot N-alkylation of indolines, followed by oxidation using a FeBr&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;/TEMPO catalyst with &lt;i&gt;t-&lt;/i&gt;BuOOH, the corresponding N-alkylated indoles were obtained.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whereas iron catalysts usually promote catalyzed C3-alkylation of indole derivatives via a borrowing-hydrogen methodology using alcohols as the electrophilic partners, this contribution shows how to switch the selectivity towards N-alkylation. Thus, starting from indoline derivatives, N-alkylation was efficiently performed using a tricarbonyl(cyclopentadienone) iron complex as the catalyst in trifluoroethanol in the presence of alcohols leading to the corresponding N-alkylated indoline derivatives in 31&#8211;99&#8201;% yields (28&#8197;examples). The one-pot, two-step strategy for the selective N-alkylation of indolines is completed by an oxidation to give the corresponding N-alkylated indoles in 31&#8211;90&#8201;% yields (15&#8197;examples). This unprecedented oxidation methodology involves an iron salt catalyst associated with (2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidin-1-yl)oxyl (TEMPO) and a stoichiometric amount of &lt;i&gt;t-&lt;/i&gt;BuOOH at room temperature.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Switching Chirophilic Self&#8208;assembly: From meso&#8208;structures to Conglomerates in Liquid and Liquid Crystalline Network Phases of Achiral Polycatenar Compounds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Spontaneous generation of chirality from achiral molecules is a contemporary research topic with numerous implications for technological applications and for the understanding of the development of homogeneous chirality in biosystems. Herein, a series of azobenzene based rod&#8208;like molecules with an 3,4,5&#8208;trialkylated end and a single  n&#8208;  alkyl chain involving 5 to 20 aliphatic carbons at the opposite end is reported. Depending on the chain length and temperature these achiral molecules self&#8208;assemble into a series of liquid and liquid crystalline (LC) helical network phases. A chiral isotropic liquid (Iso  1  [  *  ]  ) and a cubic triple network phase with chiral  I  23 lattice were found for the short chain compounds, whereas non&#8208;cubic and achiral cubic phases dominate for the long chain compounds. Among them a mesoscale conglomerate with  I  23 lattice, a tetragonal phase (Tet  bi  ) containing one chirality synchronized and one non&#8208;synchronized achiral network, an achiral double network  meso&#8208;  structure with  Ia  d  space group and an achiral percolated isotropic liquid mesophase (Iso  1  ) were found. This sequence is attributed to an increasing strength of chirality synchronization between the networks, combined with a change of the preferred mode of chirophilic self&#8208;assembly between the networks, switching from enantiophilic to enantiophobic with decreasing chain length and lowering temperature. These nanostructured and mirror symmetry broken LC phases exist over wide temperature ranges which is of interest for potential applications in chiral and photosensitive functional materials derived from achiral compounds.</dc:description>

The reactivity of&#160;aryl monocarboxylic acids (benzoic, 1&#8208; or 2&#8208;naphtoic, 4&#8217;&#8208;methylbiphenyl&#8208;4&#8208;carboxylic and anthracene&#8208;9&#8208;carboxylic acids) has been investigated as complexing agent toward the ethoxide niobium(V) (Nb(OEt)  5  precursor. A total of 8 coordination complexes has been isolated with distinct niobium(V) nuclearities as well as carboxylates complexation states. The use of benzoic acid gives to a tetranuclear core Nb  4  (&#956;  2  &#8208;O)  4  (  L  )  4  (OEt)  8  ] (  L  = benzoate (  1  )) exhibiting four Nb&#8208;(&#956;  2  &#8208;O)&#8208;Nb linkages in a square plane configuration. A similar tetramer (  7  ) is obtained with 2&#8208;naphtoic acid by using a 55% humidity atmosphere synthetic route. Two types of dinuclear bricks has been identified with one central Nb&#8208;(&#956;  2  &#8208;O)&#8208;Nb linkages, and differ by the complexation state, with one bridging carboxylate ([Nb  2  (&#956;  2  &#8208;O)(&#956;  2  &#8208;OEt)(  L  )(OEt)  6  ], with  L  = 1&#8208;naphtoate (  3)  &amp;  L  = anthracene&#8208;9&#8208;carboxylate (  5  )) or two bridging carboxylate groups ([Nb  2  (&#956;  2  &#8208;O)(  L  )  2  (OEt)  6  ], with  L  = 4&#8217;&#8208;methylbiphenyl&#8208;4&#8208;carboxylic (  4)  &amp;  L  = anthracene&#8208;9&#8208;carboxylate (  6  )).

         <title>[2+3] Amide Cages by Oxidation of [2+3] Imine Cages &#8211; Revisiting Molecular Hosts for Highly Efficient Nitrate Binding</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of second generation amide cages were synthesized in high yields by converting imine cages by Pinnick oxidation reactions. By NMR titration experiments, one amide cage was identified having superior selectivities of nitrate vs. chloride (S=705) or hydrogensulfate (S &gt;13400) in combination with high association constants for nitrate.







Abstract
The pollution of groundwater with nitrate is a serious issue because nitrate can cause several diseases such as methemoglobinemia or cancer. Therefore, selective removal of nitrate by efficient binding to supramolecular hosts is highly desired. Here we describe how to make [2+3] amide cages in very high to quantitative yields by applying an optimized Pinnick oxidation protocol for the conversion of corresponding imine cages. By NMR titration experiments of the eight different [2+3] amide cages with nitrate, chloride and hydrogen sulfate we identified one cage with an unprecedented high selectivity towards nitrate binding vs. chloride (S=705) or hydrogensulfate (S&gt;13500) in CD2Cl2/CD3CN (1&#8201;:&#8201;3). NMR experiments as well as single&#8208;crystal structure comparison of host&#8208;guest complexes give insight into structure&#8208;property&#8208;relationships.

         <title>A Happy Get&#8208;Together &#8211; Probing Electrochemical Interfaces by Non&#8208;Linear Vibrational Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review aims at exploring the developments in understanding the molecular process at electrode&#8208;electrolyte interface facilitated by the collaboration between Vibrational Sum&#8208;Frequency Generation Spectroscopy (VSFG) and electrochemistry. Methodological advancements for incorporating VSFG in electrochemical set&#8208;ups to probe transient species during electrocatalytic reactions and solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase formation in the battery are assessed.







Abstract
Electrochemical interfaces are key structures in energy storage and catalysis. Hence, a molecular understanding of the active sites at these interfaces, their solvation, the structure of adsorbates, and the formation of solid&#8208;electrolyte interfaces are crucial for an in&#8208;depth mechanistic understanding of their function. Vibrational sum&#8208;frequency generation (VSFG) spectroscopy has emerged as an operando spectroscopic technique to monitor complex electrochemical interfaces due to its intrinsic interface sensitivity and chemical specificity. Thus, this review discusses the happy get&#8208;together between VSFG spectroscopy and electrochemical interfaces. Methodological approaches for answering core issues associated with the behavior of adsorbates on electrodes, the structure of solvent adlayers, the transient formation of reaction intermediates, and the emergence of solid electrolyte interphase in battery research are assessed to provide a critical inventory of highly promising avenues to bring optical spectroscopy to use in modern material research in energy conversion and storage.

         <title>High&#8208;Throughput Platform for Novel Reaction Discovery</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Extract, isolate and discover: We have designed a simple technique that can rapidly isolate reaction products with excellent purity by solid&#8208;phase extraction. This unique technique enabled us to develop a high&#8208;throughput reaction discovery platform. The effectiveness of this strategy was demonstrated by one newly discovered transformation, which shed light on the laboratory&#8208;scale discovery of new reactions.







Abstract
Detecting the formation of new chemical bonds in high&#8208;throughput synthesis is limited by the efficiency and scalability of reaction product detection, as conventional methods for isolating product from reaction mixtures are time consuming and labor intensive. Here, we report a miniaturizable purification method that enables the rapid, high&#8208;throughput isolation of quaternary ammonium&#8208;tagged products from reaction mixtures with excellent purity using inexpensive equipment that easily can be set up in a typical organic chemistry laboratory. This novel purification technique enabled us to establish a high&#8208;throughput reaction discovery platform. We validated this platform in a screen of 1536 reactions, and one previously unreported transformation was identified.

         <title>Facet Engineering on WO3 Mono&#8208;Particle&#8208;Layer Electrode for Photoelectrochemical Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Facet&#8208;aligned WO3 photoelectrodes: An electrode with planar configuration of massively assembled WO3 plates exposes (002) facets to the electrolyte so that bulk hole diffusion and interfacial charge transfer are facilitated. Photo&#8208;deposited Au at electron enriched {110} edges is positioned at the bottom to further improve charge collection to the substrate.







Abstract
Photoelectrochemical (PEC) performance of WO3 photoanodes for water splitting is heavily influenced by the orientation of crystal facets. In this work, mono&#8208;particle&#8208;layer electrodes, assembled by particulate WO3 square plates with highly uniform alignment along the (002) facet, improved PEC water oxidation kinetics and stability. Photo&#8208;deposition of Au along the cracks formed on the surface of the plates, which are the edges of {110} facets, was found to further enhance electron collection efficiency. Combination of these two strategies allowed the facet&#8208;engineered WO3 electrode to produce significantly higher efficiencies in charge separation and transfer than the electrode prepared without facet orientation. This work has provided a facile route for fabricating a structurally designed WO3 photoelectrode, which is also applicable to other regularly shaped semiconductor photocatalysts with anisotropic charge migration.

         <title>Post&#8208;Synthetic Modification of a Porous Hydrocarbon Cage to Give a Discrete Co24 Organometallic Complex
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A robust porous cage was synthesized using irreversible alkyne coupling reactions. Reaction with dicobalt octacarbonyl gave exhaustive metalation of the 12 alkyne units to give the Co24(CO)72 adduct of the cage in a single pot.







Abstract
A new alkyne&#8208;based hydrocarbon cage was synthesized in high overall yield using alkyne&#8208;alkyne coupling in the cage forming step. The cage is porous and displays a moderately high BET surface area (546&#8197;m2&#8201;g&#8722;1). The cage loses crystallinity on activation and thus is porous in its amorphous form, while very similar cages have been either non&#8208;porous, or retained crystallinity on activation. Reaction of the cage with Co2(CO)8 results in exhaustive metalation of its 12 alkyne groups to give the Co24(CO)72 adduct of the cage in good yield.

         <title>Monomeric Magnesium Catalyzed Alkene and Alkyne Hydroboration</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this work, two monomeric magnesium alkyl complexes (  1  and  2  ) were prepared using bis(phosphino)carbazole framework and among them  1  has been used as a catalyst for hydroboration of alkenes and alkynes with pinacolborane (HBpin). A broad variety of aromatic and aliphatic alkenes and alkynes were efficiently reduced. Anti&#8208;Markovnikov regioselective hydroboration of alkenes and alkynes was achieved, which was confirmed by deuterium&#8208;labelling experiments. The work represents the first example of the use of magnesium in homogeneous catalytic hydroboration of alkene with broad substrate scope. Experimental mechanistic investigations and DFT calculations provided insights into the reaction mechanism. Finally, the hydroboration protocol was extended to terpenes.</dc:description>

         <title>Metalloenzyme&#8208;mediated thiol&#8208;yne addition towards photoisomerizable fluorescent dyes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Proteins are able to irreversibly assemble biologically active ligands from building blocks bearing complementary reactive functions due their spatial proximity, through a kinetic target&#8208;guided synthetic process (also named in situ click chemistry). Although linkages thus formed are mostly passive, some of them have shown to significantly contribute to the protein binding through for instance hydrogen bonding and stacking interactions. Biocompatible reactions and click chemistry are a formidable source of inspiration for developing such new protein&#8208;directed ligations. In this study, we report a proximity&#8208;induced thiol&#8208;yne synthesis of carbonic anhydrase inhibitors. Not only this example widens the arsenal of Kinetic target&#8208;guided synthesis (KTGS) eligible reactions, but the obtained product displayed unsuspected photophysical properties. The corresponding vinyl sulfide linkage conjugated to a coumarin core proved to be engaged in a monodirectional Z to E photoisomerization process. Further investigations guided by theoretical calculations showed that fine&#8208;tuning of the nature of the substituents on the coumarin moiety allows to obtain a bidirectional photochemical process, thus discovering a new photoswitching moiety, displaying moreover fluorescence properties. Due to the spectral tunability of coumarin derivatives, this work should open new opportunities for the design of vinyl sulfide&#8208;based photoswitch systems with modular photophysical properties.</dc:description>

         <title>Solvent and Substrate Induced Chiroptical Inversion in Amphiphilic, Biocompatible Glycoconjugate Supramolecules: Shape&#8208;persistent Gelation, Self&#8208;healing, and Antibacterial Activity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We showed solvent and substrate&#8208;dependent chiral inversion of a few glycoconjugate supramolecules.&#160;  Z&#8208;F&#8208;Gluco, where D&#8208;Glucosamine has been attached chemically with the Cbz&#8208;protected L&#8208;Phenylalanine in the C&#8208;terminus, forms self&#8208;healing hydrogel via intertwining of the nanofibers wherein the gelators undergo lamellar packing in the &#946;&#8208;sheet secondary structures with a single chiral handedness. Dihybrid Z&#8208;F&#8208;Gluco nanocomposite gel has been prepared by in situ formation of AgNPs in the gel, which enhances the mechanical properties of the composite gel by physical cross&#8208;linking without altering the packing pattern. In contrast, Z&#8208;L&#8208;Gluco bearing L&#8208;Leucine moiety does not form hydrogel rather it forms organogel. Interestingly, the chiral handedness of the aggregates of Z&#8208;L&#8208;Gluco can be reversed by choosing suitable solvents. In addition to self&#8208;healing behavior, Z&#8208;L&#8208;Gluco gel revealed shape persistency. Further, Z&#8208;F&#8208;Gluco hydrogel is benign, non&#8208;toxic, non&#8208;immunogenic, and non&#8208;allergic to animal cells. AgNPs loaded Z&#8208;F&#8208;Gluco hydrogel showed antibacterial activity against both gram&#8208;positive and gram&#8208;negative bacteria.</dc:description>

         <title>Dihydrogen Activation with a Neutral, Intermolecular Silicon(IV)&#8208;Amine Frustrated Lewis Pair</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The heterolytic cleavage of dihydrogen constitutes the hallmark reaction of frustrated Lewis pairs (FLP). While being well&#8208;established for planar Lewis acids, such as boranes or silylium ion, the observation of the primary H2 splitting products with non&#8208;planar Lewis acid FLPs remained elusive. In the present work, we report bis(perfluoro&#8208; N &#8208;phenyl&#8208; o &#8208;amidophenolato)silane and its application in dihydrogen activation to a fully characterized hydridosilicate. The Lewis acid's strict design, the Lewis base's limited selection, and the distinct reaction conditions emphasize the narrow tolerance to achieve this fascinating process with a tetrahedral Lewis acid.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhancing the Peroxygenase Activity of a Cofactor&#8208;Independent Peroxyzyme by Directed Evolution Enabling Gram&#8208;Scale Epoxide Synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Peroxygenases selectively incorporate oxygen into organic molecules making use of the environmentally friendly oxidant H2O2 with water being the sole by&#8208;product. These biocatalysts can provide &#8216;green&#8217; routes for the synthesis of enantioenriched epoxides, which are fundamental intermediates in the production of pharmaceuticals. The peroxyzyme 4&#8209;oxalocrotonate tautomerase (4&#8209;OT), catalysing the epoxidation of a variety of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated aldehydes with H2O2, is outstanding because of its independence from any cost&#8208;intensive cofactor. However, its low&#8208;level peroxygenase activity and the decrease in the enantiomeric excess of the corresponding &#945;,&#946;&#8208;epoxy&#8208;aldehydes under preparative&#8208;scale conditions is limiting the potential of 4&#8209;OT. Herein we report the directed evolution of a tandem&#8208;fused 4&#8209;OT variant, which showed an ~150&#8208;fold enhanced peroxygenase activity compared to 4&#8208;OT wild type, enabling the synthesis of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;epoxy&#8208;aldehydes in milligram&#8208; and gram&#8208;scale with high enantiopurity (up to 98% ee) and excellent conversions. This engineered cofactor&#8208;independent peroxyzyme can provide new opportunities for the eco&#8208;friendly and practical synthesis of enantioenriched epoxides at large scale.</dc:description>

         <title>Multistep Continuous Flow Synthesis of Isolable NH2&#8208;Sulfinamidines via Nucleophilic Addition to Transient Sulfurdiimide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The growing interest in novel sulfur pharmacophores led to recent advances in the synthesis of some S(IV) and S(VI) motifs. However, preparation and isolation of uncommon primary sulfinamidines, the aza&#8208;analogues of sulfinamides, is highly desirable. Here we report a multistep continuous flow synthesis of poorly explored NH  2  &#8208;sulfinamidines by nucleophilic attack of organometallic reagents to  in situ  prepared  N  &#8208;(trimethylsilyl)&#8208;  N  &#8208;trityl&#8208;&#955;  4  &#8208;sulfanediimine (Tr&#8208;N=S=N&#8208;TMS). The transformation can additionally be realized under mild conditions, at room temperature, via a highly chemoselective halogen&#8208;lithium exchange of aryl bromides and iodides with  n  &#8208;butyllithium. Moreover, the synthetic potential of the methodology was assessed exploring further manipulations of the products and accessing novel S(IV) analogues of celecoxib, tasisulam, and relevant sulfinimidoylureas.</dc:description>

         <title>Pseudo&#8208;octahedral Iron(II) Complexes with Near&#8208;degenerate Charge Transfer and Ligand Field States at the Franck&#8208;Condon Geometry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Increasing the metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge transfer (MLCT) excited state lifetime of polypyridine iron(II) complexes can be achieved by lowering the ligand&#8217;s p* orbital energy and by increasing the ligand field splitting. In the homo&#8208; and heteroleptic complexes [Fe(cpmp)  2  ]  2+  (  1  2+  ) and [Fe(cpmp)(ddpd)]  2+  (  2  2+  ) with the tridentate ligands 6,2&#8217;&#8217;&#8208;carboxypyridyl&#8208;2,2&#8217;&#8208;methylamine&#8208;pyridyl&#8208;pyridine (cpmp) and  N  ,  N  &#8217;&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;  N  ,  N  &#8217;&#8208;di&#8208;pyridin&#8208;2&#8208;ylpyridine&#8208;2,6&#8208;diamine (ddpd) two or one dipyridyl ketone moieties provide low energy p* acceptor orbitals. A good metal&#8208;ligand orbital overlap to increase the ligand field splitting is achieved by optimizing the octahedricity through CO and NMe units between the coordinating pyridines which enable the formation of six&#8208;membered chelate rings. The push&#8208;pull ligand cpmp provides intra&#8208;ligand and ligand&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge transfer (ILCT, LL&#8217;CT) excited states in addition to MLCT excited states.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Increasing the metal-to-ligand charge transfer (MLCT) excited state lifetime of polypyridine iron(II) complexes can be achieved by lowering the ligand&#8217;s p* orbital energy and by increasing the ligand field splitting. In the homo- and heteroleptic complexes [Fe(cpmp)  2  ]  2+  (  1  2+  ) and [Fe(cpmp)(ddpd)]  2+  (  2  2+  ) with the tridentate ligands 6,2&#8217;&#8217;-carboxypyridyl-2,2&#8217;-methylamine-pyridyl-pyridine (cpmp) and  N  ,  N  &#8217;-dimethyl-  N  ,  N  &#8217;-di-pyridin-2-ylpyridine-2,6-diamine (ddpd) two or one dipyridyl ketone moieties provide low energy p* acceptor orbitals. A good metal-ligand orbital overlap to increase the ligand field splitting is achieved by optimizing the octahedricity through CO and NMe units between the coordinating pyridines which enable the formation of six-membered chelate rings. The push-pull ligand cpmp provides intra-ligand and ligand-to-ligand charge transfer (ILCT, LL&#8217;CT) excited states in addition to MLCT excited states. Ground and excited state properties of  1  2+  and  2  2+  were accessed by X-ray diffraction analyses, resonance Raman spectroscopy, (spectro)electrochemistry, EPR spectroscopy, X-ray emission spectroscopy, static and time-resolved IR and UV/Vis/NIR absorption spectroscopy as well as quantum chemical calculations.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Porphyrinoids are considered perfect candidates for their incorporation into electron donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;A) arrays due to their remarkable optoelectronic properties and low reorganization energies. For the first time, a series of subphthalocyanine (SubPc) and corrole (Cor) were covalently connected through a short&#8208;range linkage. SubPc axial substitution strategies were employed, which allowed the synthesis of the target molecules in decent yields. In this context, a qualitative synthetic approach was performed in order to reverse the expected direction of the different electronic events. Consequently, in&#8208;depth absorption, fluorescence, and electrochemical assays enabled the study of electronic and photophysical properties. Charge&#8208;separation was observed in cases of electron donating Cors, whereas a quantitative energy transfer from the Cor to the SubPc was detected in the case of electron accepting Cors.</dc:description>

         <title>The Significant Role of the Atomic Surface Structure of Support in Strong Metal&#8208;Support Interaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 41, July 20, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
General strategies for tailoring SMSI, including classical SMSI, oxidative SMSI, and various SMSIs after complex treatments are summarized in this concept. Moreover, a new proposal, considering both the exposed facets of support and the interaction with gas, is presented to alter the property of the support to tune SMSI. With this strategy, the same support can vary its property to reducible, oxidative, or other complex properties.







Abstract
Supported metal catalysts are important in many industrial reactions. It is reported that support materials are not always inert, and in some cases could even interact with metal nanoparticles (NPs) actively via various ways. In particular, the strong metal&#8208;support interaction (SMSI), referring to metal NPs covered by support materials, affects catalysis at the active sites on the metal NP surface, which can serve as a very effective method in tuning and improving catalytic performance. By tailoring the support materials or controlling the treatment processes, different kinds of SMSI, such as classical SMSI, oxidative SMSI, wet&#8208;chemistry SMSI, and adsorbate&#8208;mediated SMSI, can be achieved. This concept summarizes the general strategies to tune SMSI and discusses the key results. Moreover, a new proposal is presented to tailor SMSI by combining both the exposed facets of the support materials and external environments. Furthermore, the challenges faced at present are discussed and useful insights for future research concerning this topic are provided.

         <title>Neutron Diffraction Study of Indole Solvation in Deep Eutectic Systems of Choline Chloride, Malic Acid, and Water</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 41, July 20, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The solvation of indole in choline chloride:malic acid deep eutectic solvents is shown by neutron diffraction with isotopic substitution and atomistic modelling to vary with water content. Latent water does little, whereas adding 2&#8197;mole of equivalents of water causes interactions, not with the &#960;&#8208;system of indole, but via hydrophobic hydration and H&#8208;bonding in&#8208;plane with the heterocyclic rings. These results may therefore explain trends in heterocycle reactivity and selectivity.







Abstract
Deep eutectic systems are currently under intense investigation to replace traditional organic solvents in a range of syntheses. Here, indole in choline chloride&#8208;malic acid deep eutectic solvent (DES) was studied as a function of water content, to identify solute interactions with the DES which affect heterocycle reactivity and selectivity, and as a proxy for biomolecule solvation. Empirical Potential Structure Refinement models of neutron diffraction data showed [Cholinium]+ cations associate strongly with the indole &#960;&#8208;system due to electrostatics, whereas malic acid is only weakly associated. Trace water is sequestered into the DES and does not interact strongly with indole. When water is added to the DES, it does not interact with the indole &#960;&#8208;system but is exclusively in&#8208;plane with the heterocyclic rings, forming strong H&#8208;bonds with the &#8208;NH group, and also weak H&#8208;bonds and thus prominent hydrophobic hydration of the indole aromatic region, which could direct selectivity in reactions.

         <title>Intense Photoinduced Intervalence Charge Transfer in High&#8208;Valent Iron Mixed Phenolate/Carbene Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 41, July 20, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The usefulness of high&#8208;valent iron(NHC) chromophores is based on long&#8208;lived, ligand&#8208;to&#8208;metal charge transfer (LMCT) states. However, short&#8208;lived, metal&#8208;centered states may be populated if the ligands are not strong enough donors. We show that, thanks to metal&#8208;ligand covalency, iron ions can bridge ligand&#8211;ligand electronic communication, promoting ligand&#8208;based photoinduced intervalence charge transfer (PIIVCT) bands: spectroscopic markers in the usually silent NIR region that allow the interconversion between LMCT&#8208; and metal&#8208;centered states to be monitored.







Abstract
We report high&#8208;valent iron complexes supported by N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC)&#8208;anchored, bis&#8208;phenolate pincer ligands that undergo ligand&#8208;to&#8208;metal charge transfer (LMCT) upon photoexcitation. The resulting excited states &#8211; with a lifetime in the picosecond range &#8211; feature a ligand&#8208;based, mixed&#8208;valence system and intense intervalence charge transfer bands in the near&#8208;infrared region. Upon oxidation of the complex, corresponding intervalence charge transfer absorptions are also observed in the ground state. We suggest that the spectroscopic hallmarks of such LMCT states provide useful tools to decipher excited&#8208;state decay mechanisms in high&#8208;valent NHC complexes. Our observations further indicate that NHC&#8208;anchored, bis&#8208;phenolate pincer ligands are not sufficiently strong donors to prevent the population of excited metal&#8208;centered states in high&#8208;valent iron complexes.

&lt;p&gt;We report high-valent iron complexes supported by N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC)-anchored, bis-phenolate pincer ligands that undergo ligand-to-metal charge transfer (LMCT) upon photoexcitation. The resulting excited states &#8211; with a lifetime in the picosecond range &#8211; feature a ligand-based, mixed-valence system and intense intervalence charge transfer bands in the near-infrared region. Upon oxidation of the complex, corresponding intervalence charge transfer absorptions are also observed in the ground state. We suggest that the spectroscopic hallmarks of such LMCT states provide useful tools to decipher excited-state decay mechanisms in high-valent NHC complexes. Our observations further indicate that NHC-anchored, bis-phenolate pincer ligands are not sufficiently strong donors to prevent the population of excited metal-centered states in high-valent iron complexes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ultrathin Two&#8208;Dimensional Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Nanosheets Based on a Halogen&#8208;Substituted Porphyrin Ligand: Synthesis and Catalytic Application in CO2 Reductive Amination</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 41, July 20, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of ultrathin porphyrinic metal&#8211;organic framework (X&#8208;PMOF, X=F, Cl, Br) nanosheets with a thickness of down to 4.5&#8197;nm was prepared from the self&#8208;assembly of unsymmetrical halogen&#8208;based porphyrin ligands and ZrCl4. With the introduction of iridium(III) atoms into the porphyrin rings, the resultant Br&#8208;PMOF(Ir) nanosheets were efficient for CO2 reduction and aminolysis, giving rise to formamides in high yields under room temperature and atmospheric pressure.







Abstract
Ultrathin two&#8208;dimensional metal&#8211;organic framework nanosheets have emerged as a promising kind of heterogeneous catalysts. Herein, we report a series of 2D porphyrinic metal&#8211;organic framework nanosheets (X&#8208;PMOF, X=F, Cl, Br), which was prepared from the self&#8208;assembly of a halogen&#8208;based porphyrin ligand X&#8208;TCPP (X&#8208;TCPP=5&#8208;(4&#8208;halogenatedphenyl)&#8208;10,15,20&#8208;tris(4&#8208;carboxyphenyl)&#8208;porphyrin) and ZrCl4 in the presence of trifluoroacetic acid as the modulating reagent. The framework of X&#8208;PMOF possessed the ftw topology as in MOF&#8208;525. The lamellar X&#8208;PMOF nanosheets with the thickness of down to 4.5&#8197;nm were assembled and aggregated into a flower&#8208;like morphology. With the introduction of iridium(III) atoms into the porphyrin rings, the resultant X&#8208;PMOF(Ir) nanosheets were prepared by a similar method. Catalytic results show that Br&#8208;PMOF(Ir) nanosheets were efficient for CO2 reduction and aminolysis, giving rise to formamides in high yields under room temperature and atmospheric pressure, and can be recycled and reused for 3 runs. The total turnover number of Br&#8208;PMOF(Ir) after 3 runs was 1644 based on Ir. Mechanistic studies disclose that the high efficiency of Br&#8208;PMOF(Ir) nanosheets was ascribed to three factors, including the superior activation capability of iridium(III) porphyrin for Si&#8722;H bonds, more active sites on the external surfaces of Br&#8208;PMOF(Ir) nanosheets, and the defects caused by unsymmetrical porphyrin ligand that increased the framework's affinity towards CO2.

         <title>Relevance of Palladium to Radiopharmaceutical Development Considering Enhanced Coordination Properties of TE1PA</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 41, July 20, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Radiopharmaceuticals: Since the macrocyclic gold standards used in nuclear medicine are not suitable to Pd(II) coordination, its radioisotopes remain understated for radiopharmaceutical applications. The monopicolinate cyclam TE1PA presented here is a highly relevant chelator for natural and radioactive Pd, opening avenues to enrich the current palette of radiopharmaceuticals for targeted radiotherapy.







Abstract
The limited use of palladium&#8208;103 and &#8208;109 radionuclides for molecular radiotherapy is surely due to the lack of appropriate ligands capable of fulfilling all criteria required for application in nuclear medicine. Furthermore, the thermodynamic properties of these complexes in solution remain difficult to establish. The challenge is compounded when considering that radiolabeling of compounds for translation to clinical trials requires fast complexation. Thus, the coordination of Pd(II) and 103/109Pd&#8208;nuclides is a huge challenge in terms of molecular design and physicochemical characterization. Herein, we report a comprehensive study highlighting TE1PA, a monopicolinate cyclam &#8211; already established in nuclear imaging with 64Cu&#8208;PET (positron emission tomography) imaging tracers &#8211; as a highly relevant chelator for natural Pd and subsequently 109Pd&#8208;nuclide. The structural, thermodynamic, kinetic and radiolabeling studies of Pd(II) with TE1PA, as well as the comparison of this complex with three structurally related derivatives, support palladium&#8208;TE1PA radiopharmaceuticals as leading candidates for targeted nuclear medicine.

         <title>The Pursuit of Perphenylterphenyls</title>

Tetradecaphenyl&#8208;p&#8208;terphenyl was prepared in low yield by two methods: (1) Ullmann coupling of pentaphenyliodobenzene and 2,3,5,6&#8208;tetraphenyl&#8208;1,4&#8208;diiodobenzene and (2) Diels&#8208;Alder addition of tetracyclone and 1,4&#8208;bis(phenylethynyl)&#8208;2,3,5,6&#8208;tetraphenylbenzene. Its X&#8208;ray structure shows it to possess an unusual conformation with two boat&#8208;shaped benzene rings.







Abstract
Tetradecaphenyl&#8208;p&#8208;terphenyl (2) was synthesized from 2,3,5,6&#8208;tetraphenyl&#8208;1,4&#8208;diiodobenzene (11) by two methods. Ullmann coupling of 11 with pentaphenyliodobenzene (9) gave compound 2 in 1.7&#8201;% yield, and Sonogashira coupling of 11 with phenylacetylene, followed by a double Diels&#8208;Alder reaction of the product diyne 12 with tetracyclone (6), gave 2 in 1.5&#8201;% overall yield. The latter reaction also gave the monoaddition product 4&#8208;(phenylethynyl)&#8208;2,2&#8242;,3,3&#8242;,4&#8242;,5,5&#8242;,6,6&#8242;&#8208;nonaphenylbiphenyl (13) in 4&#8201;% overall yield. The X&#8208;ray structures of compounds 2 and 13 show them to possess core aromatic rings distorted into shallow boat conformations. Density functional calculations indicate that these unusual structures are not the lowest energy conformations in the gas phase and may be the result of packing forces in the crystal. In addition, while uncorrected DFT calculations indicate that the strain energy in compound 2 is approximately 50&#8197;kcal/mol, dispersion&#8208;corrected DFT calculations suggest that it is essentially unstrained, due to compensating, favorable, intramolecular interactions of its many phenyl rings. An attempted synthesis of tetradecaphenyl&#8208;o&#8208;terphenyl (4) by reaction of diphenylhexatriyne (14) with three equivalents of tetracyclone at 350&#8201;&#176;C gave only the diadduct 2&#8208;(phenylethynyl)&#8208;2&#8242;,3,3&#8242;,4,4&#8242;,5,5&#8242;,6,6&#8242;&#8208;nonaphenylbiphenyl (15) in 17&#8201;% yield. Even higher temperatures failed to produce 4 and lowered the yield of 15, perhaps due to rapid decomposition of the starting materials. Ullmann coupling of 3,4,5,6&#8208;tetraphenyl&#8208;1,2&#8208;diiodobenzene (16) and compound 9 also failed to give compound 4.

         <title>Nickel and Copper Catalyzed ipso&#8208;Phosphonodifluoromethylation of Arylboronic Acids with BrCF2P(O)(OEt)2 for the Synthesis of Phosphonodifluoromethylarenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 41, July 20, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The presented method allows the preparation of ipso&#8208;phosphonodifluoromethylarenes utilizing a heterobimetallic catalytic system of nickel and copper. The protocol represents an advantage over traditional palladium catalysed Suzuki coupling due to the short reaction times and the use of earth&#8208;abundant metals.







Abstract

         <dc:description>
An electrochemical transformation for the selective para&#8208;fluorination of anilides is presented. Herein, anodically generated ArIF2 mediates the conversion of a variety of 20 different anilides in up to 86&#8201;% yield. The sustainable and easy to conduct protocol in an ionic&#8208;liquid / dicholoromethane mixture represents a promising alternative to conventional reagent mediated synthesis protocol.







Abstract
The para&#8208;selective fluorination reaction of anilides using electrochemically generated hypervalent ArIF2 is reported, with Et3N&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;5HF serving as fluoride source and as supporting electrolyte. This electrochemical reaction is characterized by a simple set&#8208;up, easy scalability and affords a broad variety of fluorinated anilides from easily accessible anilides in good yields up to 86&#8201;%.

         <title>ThioCORMates: Tunable and Cost&#8208;Effective Carbon Monoxide&#8208;Releasing Molecules</title>

         <dc:description>
S&#8208;aryl thioformates, or thioCORMates, are versatile carbon monoxide&#8208;releasing molecules (CORMs) for a range of uses, from carbonylative cross coupling to protein binding. These molecules can be tuned to release CO at different rates (from &lt;1&#8197;min to &gt;1&#8197;h) at room temperature. Isotopically labeled 13CO can also be generated easily, since thioCORMates are made in one step from the corresponding thiophenol and formic acid.







Abstract
Carbon monoxide&#8208;releasing molecules (CORMs) can offer a safer alternative to CO delivery than the use of CO gas cylinders. Upon treatment with an amine base, S&#8208;aryl thioformates (&#8220;thioCORMates&#8221;) release CO nearly quantitatively at room temperature, a gas which can then be harnessed for carbonylative cross&#8208;coupling, biological study, or inorganic synthesis. These bench&#8208;stable molecules are easily synthesized from the corresponding thiophenol and can be electronically tuned to release CO at different rates&#8208;from less than 1&#8197;min to greater than 1&#8197;h&#8208;offering a practical alternative to existing CORM technology. Finally, isotopically labeled 13CO can be conveniently generated and used, with the thioCORMate synthesized from 13C&#8208;formic acid.

         <title>Mapping Catalyst&#8211;Solvent Interplay in Competing Carboamination/Cyclopropanation Reactions</title>

What will my product be? Selectivity and activity maps can be used to predict and rationalize reaction outcomes based on catalyst and solvent choice. Here, there utility is demonstrated by examining competing carboamination/cyclopropanation reactions catalyzed by Group 9 catalysts featuring cyclopentadienyl ligands, which reveals an interesting energetic interplay involving the role of the solvent and of the catalyst.







Abstract
Group 9 metals, in particular RhIII complexes with cyclopentadienyl ligands, are competent C&#8722;H activation catalysts. Recently, a Cp*RhIII&#8208;catalyzed reaction of alkenes with N&#8208;enoxyphthalimides showed divergent outcome based on the solvent, with carboamination favored in methanol and cyclopropanation in 2,2,2&#8208;trifluoroethanol (TFE). Here, we create selectivity and activity maps capable of unravelling the catalyst&#8208;solvent interplay on the outcome of these competing reactions by analyzing 42 cyclopentadienyl metal catalysts, CpXMIII (M=Co, Rh, Ir). These maps not only can be used to rationalize previously reported experimental results, but also capably predict the behavior of untested catalyst/solvent combinations as well as aid in identifying experimental protocols that simultaneously optimize both catalytic activity and selectivity (solutions in the Pareto front). In this regard, we demonstrate how and why the experimentally employed Cp*RhIII catalyst represents an ideal choice to invoke a solvent&#8208;induced change in reactivity. Additionally, the maps reveal the degree to which even perceived minor changes in the solvent (e.&#8201;g., replacing methanol with ethanol) influence the ratio of carboamination and cyclopropanation products. Overall, the selectivity and activity maps presented here provide a generalizable tool to create global pictures of anticipated reaction outcome that can be used to develop new experimental protocols spanning metal, ligand, and solvent space.

Tuning by timing: The photo&#8208;initiation of Sonogashira cross&#8208;coupling was achieved using a simple white LED combined with a triphenylphosphine ruthenium&#8211;arene complex bearing an azobenzene ligand. The strategy developed in this work involves the photo&#8208;controlled release of metal catalyst activator (PPh3) through Z&#8208;to&#8208;E azobenzene isomerization, thus generating competent Pd0 active species, and allows fine tuning of reaction kinetics according to irradiation time.







Abstract
Photo&#8208;release of triphenylphosphine from a sulfonamide azobenzene ruthenium&#8211;arene complex was exploited to activate PdIICl2 into Pd0 catalyst, for the photo&#8208;initiation of Sonogashira cross&#8208;coupling. The transformation was initiated on demand &#8211; by using simple white LED strip lights &#8211; with a high temporal response and the ability to control reaction rate by changing the irradiation time. Various substrates were successfully applied to this photo&#8208;initiated cross&#8208;coupling, thus illustrating the wide functional&#8208;group tolerance of our photo&#8208;caged catalyst activator, without any need for sophisticated photochemistry apparatus.

The zeolitic nickel molybdates are effective for C2 hydrocarbon separation.







Abstract
Zeolitic octahedral metal oxides are inorganic crystalline microporous materials with adsorption and redox properties. New &#1013;&#8208;Keggin nickel molybdate&#8211;based zeolitic octahedral metal oxides have been synthesized. 31P NMR spectroscopy shows that reduction of MoVI&#8208;based molybdates forms an &#1013;&#8208;Keggin polyoxometalate that immediately transfers to the solid phase. Investigation of the formation process indicates that a low Ni concentration, insoluble reducing agent, and long synthesis time are the critical factors for obtaining the zeolite octahedral metal oxides rather than the &#1013;&#8208;Keggin polyoxometalate molecule. The synthesized zeolitic nickel molybdate with Na+ is used as the adsorbent, which effectively separates C2 hydrocarbon mixtures.

         <title>Experimental and Theoretical Study of NiII&#8208; and PdII&#8208;Promoted Double Geminal C(sp3)&#8722;H Bond Activation Providing Facile Access to NHC Pincer Complexes: Isolated Intermediates and Mechanism</title>

A gem of a reaction: The first examples of stepwise (Pd) or direct (Ni) metal&#8208;promoted double geminal activation of C
&#8722;H bonds leading to imidazole&#8208;type N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene metal pincer complexes under mild conditions are presented.







Abstract
We report the first examples of metal&#8208;promoted double geminal activation of C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds of the N&#8722;CH2&#8722;N moiety in an imidazole&#8208;type heterocycle, leading to nickel and palladium N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene complexes under mild conditions. Reaction of the new electron&#8208;rich diphosphine 1,3&#8208;bis((di&#8208;tert&#8208;butylphosphaneyl)methyl)&#8208;2,3&#8208;dihydro&#8208;1H&#8208;benzo[d]imidazole (1) with [PdCl2(cod)] occurred in a stepwise fashion, first by single C&#8722;H bond activation yielding the alkyl pincer complex [PdCl(PC
HP)] (3) with two trans phosphane donors and a covalent Pd&#8722;C
 bond. Activation of the C&#8722;H bond of the resulting &#945;&#8208;methine C
H&#8722;M group occurred subsequently when 3 was treated with HCl to yield the NHC pincer complex [PdCl(PCNHCP)]Cl (2). Treatment of 1 with [NiBr2(dme)] also afforded a NHC pincer complex, [NiBr(PCNHCP)]Br (6), but the reactions leading to the double geminal C&#8722;H bond activation of the N&#8722;CH2&#8722;N group were too fast to allow identification or isolation of an intermediate analogous to 3. The determination of six crystal structures, the isolation of reaction intermediates and DFT calculations provided the basis for suggesting the mechanism of the stepwise transformation of a N&#8722;CH2&#8722;N moiety in the N&#8722;CNHC&#8722;N unit of NHC pincer complexes and explain the key differences observed between the Pd and Ni chemistries.

         <title>Selective [2+1+1] Fragmentation of P4 by heteroleptic Metallasilylenes</title>

Si cuts in: Heteroleptic metallasilylenes L1(Cl)MSiL2 (M=Al 1, Ga 2) react selectively with white phosphorus in a [2+1+1] fragmentation of the P4 tetrahedron to give L1(Cl)MPSi(L2)PPSi(L2)PM(Cl)L1 (M=Al 3, Ga 4).







Abstract
Small&#8208;molecule activation by low&#8208;valent main&#8208;group element compounds is of general interest. We here report the synthesis and characterization (1H, 13C, 29Si NMR, IR, sc&#8208;XRD) of heteroleptic metallasilylenes L1(Cl)MSiL2 (M=Al 1, Ga 2, L1=HC[C(Me)NDipp]2, Dipp=2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3; L2=PhC(NtBu)2). Their electronic nature was analyzed by quantum chemical computations, while their promising potential in small&#8208;molecule activation was demonstrated in reactions with P4, which occurred with unprecedented [2+1+1] fragmentation of the P4 tetrahedron and formation of L1(Cl)MPSi(L2)PPSi(L2)PM(Cl)L1 (M=Al 3, Ga 4).

         <title>Intramolecular (4+3) Cycloadditions of Oxidopyridinium Ions: Towards Daphnicyclidin A</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 41, July 20, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
No strain, no gain: Studies of the intramolecular (4+3) cycloaddition reaction of oxidopyridinium ions led to the idea that the reaction might be applicable to daphnicyclidin A and related alkaloids. It was demonstrated that despite an increase in strain relative to cycloadducts we had been studying, the ABC ring system of daphnicyclidin A, including a quaternary center, could be synthesized in 6 steps in 36.5&#8201;% overall yield from commercially available 4&#8208;hydroxybutanone.







Abstract
N&#8208;alkylation of 5&#8208;hydroxynicotinic acid esters with electrophiles containing diene functionality produces salts that undergo intramolecular (4+3) cycloaddition reactions upon heating in the presence of base. Initial studies used a three&#8208;carbon tether to join the pyridinium ion and diene, revealing some aspects of the inherent selectivity of the reaction with such substrates. Much more challenging was the synthesis of related species possessing only a two&#8208;carbon tether. Nevertheless, the cycloaddition of such compounds was successful, leading directly to the ABC ring system of the alkaloid daphnicyclidin A.

Stable radical complexes can be either oxidized to regular [MII(MB&#8208;DIPY)]+ (M=Cu or Ni) or reduced to [MII(MB&#8208;DIPY)]&#8722; compounds within an &#8764;400&#8197;mV electrochemical window.







Abstract
The preparation of radicals with intense and redox&#8208;switchable absorption beyond 1000&#8197;nm is a long&#8208;standing challenge in the chemistry of functional dyes. Here we report the preparation of a series of unprecedented stable neutral nickel(II) and copper(II) complexes of &#8220;Manitoba dipyrromethenes&#8221; (MB&#8208;DIPYs) in which the organic chromophore is present in the radical&#8208;anion state. The new stable radicals have an intense absorption at &#955;max&#8764;1300&#8197;nm and can be either oxidized to regular [MII(MB&#8208;DIPY)]+ (M=Cu or Ni) or reduced to [MII(MB&#8208;DIPY)]&#8722; compounds. The radical nature of the stable [MII(MB&#8208;DIPY)] complexes was confirmed by EPR spectroscopy with additional insight into their electronic structure obtained by UV&#8208;Vis spectroscopy, electro&#8208; and spectroelectrochemistry, magnetic measurements, and X&#8208;ray crystallography. The electronic structures and spectroscopic properties of the radical&#8208;based chromophores were also probed by density functional theory (DFT) and time&#8208;dependent DFT (TDDFT) calculations. These nickel(II) and copper(II) complexes represent the first stable radical compounds with a MB&#8208;DIPY ligand.

The coordination chemistry of palladium is poorly developed in nuclear medicine due to the lack of appropriate ligands capable of fulfilling all the criteria required for an in&#8197;vivo application. By showing that the monopicolinate cyclam TE1PA is a highly relevant chelator for natural and radioactive Pd, we have opened avenues to enrich the area of palladium&#8208;based targeted radiotherapies. This cover represents the early stage of their expansion. More information can be found in the Research Article by C.&#8197;H.&#8197;S. Driver, N. Le&#8197;Bris, R. Tripier, and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202200942).

Frontispiece: This concept summarizes the general strategies to tune SMSI and discusses the key results, including the classical SMSI, the oxidative SMSI, and the complex SMSI. Moreover, a new proposal for tuning SMSI by combining both the exposed facets of the support materials and external environments is presented. With this strategy, the same support can vary its property to reducible, &#8216;oxidative&#8217;, or other complex properties. For a given supported metal catalyst system, we can apply the SMSI in various conditions, extending the application of SMSI in catalysis, and importantly, broadening the ability to exert greater control in catalyst design.

         <title>Molecular Magnetic Materials Based on {CoIII(Tp*)(CN)3}&#8722; Cyanidometallate: Combined Magnetic, Structural and 59Co NMR Study</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A tris&#8208;cyanido cobalt(III) building block was used to design new molecular materials: (i) a paramagnetic two&#8208;dimensional compound, (ii) a tetrametallic spin&#8208;crossover square complex. This last one shows both thermally induced and photo&#8208;induced spin transitions accompanied by changes in optical and magnetic properties. The temperature&#8208;dependent electronic states of the compounds are probed by different techniques including magnetometry and 59Co NMR spectroscopy.







Abstract
The cyanidocobaltate of formula fac&#8208;PPh4[CoIII(Me2Tp)(CN)3]&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;CH3CN (1) has been used as a metalloligand to prepare polynuclear magnetic complexes (Me2Tp=hydrotris(3,5&#8208;dimethylpyrazol&#8208;1&#8208;yl)borate). The association of 1 with in&#8197;situ prepared [FeII(bik)2(MeCN)2](OTf)2 (bik=bis(1&#8208;methylimidazol&#8208;2&#8208;yl)ketone) leads to a molecular square of formula {[CoIII{(Me2Tp)}(CN)3]2[FeII(bik)2]2}(OTf)2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;4MeCN&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2H2O (2), whereas the self&#8208;assembly of 1 with preformed cluster [CoII2(OH2)(piv)4(Hpiv)4] in MeCN leads to the two&#8208;dimensional network of formula {[CoII2(piv)3]2[CoIII(Me2Tp)(CN)3]2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2CH3CN}&#8734; (3). These compounds were structurally characterized via single crystal X&#8208;ray analysis and their spectroscopic (FTIR, UV&#8208;Vis and 59Co NMR) properties and magnetic behaviours were also investigated. Bulk magnetic susceptibility measurements reveal that 1 is diamagnetic and 3 is paramagnetic throughout the explored temperature range, whereas 2 exhibits sharp spin transition centered at ca. 292&#8197;K. Compound 2 also exhibits photomagnetic effects at low temperature, selective light irradiations allowing to promote reversibly and repeatedly low&#8208;spin&#8660;high&#8208;spin conversion. Besides, the diamagnetic nature of the Co(III) building block allows us studying these compounds by means of 59Co NMR spectroscopy. Herein, a 59Co chemical shift has been used as a magnetic probe to corroborate experimental magnetic data obtained from bulk magnetic susceptibility measurements. An influence of the magnetic state of the neighbouring atoms is observed on the 59Co NMR signals. Moreover, for the very first time, 59Co NMR technique has been successfully introduced to investigate molecular materials with distinct magnetic properties.

         <title>Adamantyl Side Chains as Anti&#8208;Aggregating Moieties in Dyes for Dye&#8208;Sensitized Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two novel triarylamine dyes are reported, that are decorated with ethyladamantyl side chains on the &#960;&#8208;spacer (BSH&#8208;2), and on the donor (BSH&#8208;3). The ethyladamantyl modified dyes display higher photovoltages than the non&#8208;modified reference dye (JK&#8208;305). DSSC devices prepared with the adamantyl decorated donor dye (BSH&#8208;3) and the anti&#8208;aggregation additive CDCA display the best PCE of the series, at 6.1&#8201;%.







Abstract
Designing and evaluating novel dye concepts is crucial for the development of the field of dye&#8208;sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). In our recent report, the novel concept of tethering the anti&#8208;aggregation additive chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) to dyes for DSSC was introduced. Based on the performance improvements seen for this modification, the aim of this study is to see if a simplified anti&#8208;aggregation unit could achieve similar results. The following study reports the synthesis and photovoltaic characterization of two novel dyes decorated with the steric ethyladamantyl moiety on the &#960;&#8208;spacer, and on the triarylamine donor. This modification is demonstrated to be successful in increasing the photovoltages in devices employing copper&#8208;based electrolytes compared to the non&#8208;modified reference dye. The best photovoltaic performance is achieved by a device prepared with the adamantyl decorated donor dye and CDCA, this device achieves a power conversion efficiency of 6.1&#8201;% (Short&#8208;circuit current=8.3&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, Open&#8208;circuit voltage=1054&#8197;mV, Fill factor=0.69). The improved photovoltaic performance seen for the adamantyl decorated donor demonstrate the potential of ethyladamantyl side chains as a tool to ensure surface protection of TiO2.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Two novel triarylamine&lt;/b&gt; dyes are reported, that are decorated with ethyladamantyl side chains on the &#960;-spacer (&lt;b&gt;BSH-2&lt;/b&gt;), and on the donor (&lt;b&gt;BSH-3&lt;/b&gt;). The ethyladamantyl modified dyes display higher photovoltages than the non-modified reference dye (&lt;b&gt;JK-305&lt;/b&gt;). DSSC devices prepared with the adamantyl decorated donor dye (&lt;b&gt;BSH-3&lt;/b&gt;) and the anti-aggregation additive CDCA display the best PCE of the series, at 6.1&#8201;%.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Designing and evaluating novel dye concepts is crucial for the development of the field of dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). In our recent report, the novel concept of tethering the anti-aggregation additive chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) to dyes for DSSC was introduced. Based on the performance improvements seen for this modification, the aim of this study is to see if a simplified anti-aggregation unit could achieve similar results. The following study reports the synthesis and photovoltaic characterization of two novel dyes decorated with the steric ethyladamantyl moiety on the &#960;-spacer, and on the triarylamine donor. This modification is demonstrated to be successful in increasing the photovoltages in devices employing copper-based electrolytes compared to the non-modified reference dye. The best photovoltaic performance is achieved by a device prepared with the adamantyl decorated donor dye and CDCA, this device achieves a power conversion efficiency of 6.1&#8201;% (Short-circuit current=8.3&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, Open-circuit voltage=1054&#8197;mV, Fill factor=0.69). The improved photovoltaic performance seen for the adamantyl decorated donor demonstrate the potential of ethyladamantyl side chains as a tool to ensure surface protection of TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Red&#8208;Light&#8208;Driven CO&#8208;Releasing Complex: Photoreactivities and Excited&#8208;State Dynamics of Highly Distorted Tricarbonyl Rhenium Phthalocyanines</title>

         <dc:description>
Designing photoCORMs: A new photo&#8208;induced CO&#8208;releasing molecule has been developed by using tricarbonyl rhenium(I) phthalocyanine. The distorted structures of the Re phthalocyanine complexes allowed their ultrafast excited&#8208;state dynamics to be analysed by spin&#8208;orbit coupling.







Abstract
A complex comprising one [Re(CO)3]+ unit and a phthalocyanine (Pc) ligand (Re1Pc) is shown to function as a photo&#8208;induced CO&#8208;releasing molecule (photoCORM) in the presence of O2 and a coordinative solvent under irradiation with red light, which can deeply penetrate living tissues. Transient absorption spectroscopic measurements indicate very short excited&#8208;state lifetimes and ultrafast intersystem crossing for Re1Pc and Re2Pc, which contains two [Re(CO)3]+ units. The excited&#8208;state properties are ascribed to efficient spin&#8211;orbit coupling and large Franck&#8211;Condon factors originating from the complexes&#8217; distorted structures, that is, unsymmetric coordination of [Re(CO)3]+ unit(s), one of which was confirmed by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray analysis of a symmetrically substituted Pc with two [Re(CO)3]+ units. Re1Pc represents a promising red&#8208;light&#8208;driven photoCORM that can be applied in biological environments or therapeutic applications.

         <title>Late&#8208;Stage Functionalisation of Peptides on the Solid Phase by an Iodination&#8208;Substitution Approach</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An on&#8208;resin iodination&#8208;substitution approach is established to easily introduce various functional modifications into peptides at a late synthesis stage. The method allows access to methionine&#8208;like thioethers, selenoethers, thioglycosides, pyridinium salts, and fluorescent labels in a combinatorial manner. Using this approach, we synthesised an iFRET&#8208;based ZnII sensor by labelling a designed &#946;&#8208;sheet minireceptor prototype with 7&#8208;mercapto&#8208;4&#8208;methylcoumarin.







Abstract
The functionalisation of peptides at a late synthesis stage holds great potential, for example, for the synthesis of peptide pharmaceuticals, fluorescent biosensors or peptidomimetics. Here we describe an on&#8208;resin iodination&#8208;substitution reaction sequence on homoserine that is also suitable for peptide modification in a combinatorial format. The reaction sequence is accessible to a wide range of sulfur nucleophiles with various functional groups including boronic acids, hydroxy groups or aromatic amines. In this way, methionine&#8208;like thioethers or thioesters and thiosulfonates are accessible. Next to sulfur nucleophiles, selenols, pyridines and carboxylic acids were successfully used as nucleophiles, whereas phenols did not react. The late&#8208;stage iodination&#8208;substitution approach is not only applicable to short peptides but also to the more complex 34&#8208;amino&#8208;acid WW domains. We applied this strategy to introduce 7&#8208;mercapto&#8208;4&#8208;methylcoumarin into a switchable ZnII responsive WW domain to design an iFRET&#8208;based ZnII sensor.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We describe the iron&#8208;catalyzed polymerizations of diol and silane monomers to obtain 14 different poly(silylether) products with number average molecular weights (  M  n  ) up to 36.3 kDa. The polymerization reactions developed in this study are operationally simple and applicable to 1&#176; and 2&#176; silane monomer substrates and a range of benzylic and aliphatic diol substrates as well as one polyol example. The polymers were characterized by IR spectroscopy, DSC and TGA and, where solubility allowed,  1  H,  13  C{  1  H},  29  Si{  1  H} NMR spectroscopies, GPC and MALDI&#8208;TOF were also employed. The materials obtained displayed low  T  g  values (&#8722;70.6 to 19.0 &#176;C) and were stable upon heating up to  T  &#8211;5%,Ar  421.6 &#176;C. A trend in  T  &#8211;5%,Ar  was observed whereby use of a 2&#176; silane leads to higher  T  &#8211;5%,Ar  compared to those obtained using a 1&#176; silane. &#160;Reaction monitoring was undertaken by  in situ  gas evolution studies coupled with GPC analysis to follow the progression of chain&#8208;length growth which confirmed a condensation polymerization&#8208;type mechanism.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhancing dual&#8208;state emission in maleimide fluorophores through fluorocarbon functionalisation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, a library of trifluoroethyl substituted aminomaleimide derivatives are reported with small size and enhanced emissions in both solution and solid&#8208;state. A di&#8208;CH  2  CF  3  substituted aminochloromaleimide exhibits the most efficient dual state emission (  &#934;  f  &gt; 50% in solution and solid&#8208;state), with reduced quenching from protic solvents. This is attributed to the reduction of electron density on the maleimide ring and suppressed &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking in the solid&#8208;state. This mechanism was explored in&#8208;depth by crystallographic analysis, and modelling of the electronic distribution of HOMO&#8208;LUMO isosurfaces and NCI plots. Hence, these dual&#8208;state dyes overcome the limitations of single&#8208;state luminescence and will serve as an important step forward for this rapidly developing nascent field.</dc:description>

         <title>Gel&#228;nder Molecules with Orthogonal Joints: Synthesis of Macrocyclic Dimers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Orthogonal joints, understood as connections with an angle of 90&#176;, were introduced in the design of the &#8220;Gel&#228;nder&#8221; model compounds  1  and  2  . The banister, consisting of a conjugated carbazole dimer linked by either 1,3&#8208;butadiyne (  2  ) or a single thiophene (  1  ), wraps around an axis composed of a phthalimide dimer due to the dimensional mismatch of both subunits, which are interconnected by phenylene rungs. The &#8220;Gel&#228;nder&#8221; structure was assembled from a monomer comprising the 1,4&#8208;diaminobenzene rung with one amino substituent as part of a 4&#8208;bromo phthalimide subunit forming the orthogonal junction to the axis, and the other as part of a masked 2&#8208;ethynyl carbazole as orthogonal joint to the banister. The macrocycle was obtained by two sequential homocoupling steps. A first dimerization by a reductive homocoupling assembled the axis, while an oxidative acetylene coupling served as ring closing reaction. The formed butadiyne was further derivatized to a thiophene, rendering all carbons of the model compound sp  2  hybridized. Both helical structures were fully characterized and chirally resolved. Assignment of the enantiomers was achieved by simulation of chiroptical properties and enantiopure synthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>Catalysis by [Ga4L6]12&#8208; Metallocage on the Nazarov Cyclization The Basicity of Complexed Alcohol is Key</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The Nazarov cyclization is investigated in solution and within K  12  [Ga  4  L  6  ] supramolecular organometallic cage by means of computational methods. The reaction needs acidic condition in solution but works at neutral pH in the presence of the metallocage. The reaction steps for the process are analogous in both media: (a) protonation of the alcohol group, (b) water loss and (c) cyclization. The relative Gibbs energies of all the steps are affected by changing the environment from solvent to the metallocage. The first step in the mechanism, the alcohol protonation, turns out to be the most critical one for the acceleration of the reaction inside the metallocage. In order to calculate the relative stability of protonated alcohol inside the cavity, we propose a computational scheme for the calculation of basicity for species inside cavities and can be of general use. These results are in excellent agreement with the experiments, identifying key steps of catalysis and providing an in&#8208;depth understanding of the impact of the metallocage on all the reaction steps.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Oxygen species functionalized graphene (O&#8208;G) is an effective electrocatalyst for electrochemically synthesizing hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) by a 2 e&#8208;&#160;oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). The type of oxygen specie and degree of carbon crystallinity in O&#8208;G are the two key factors for the high catalytic performance of the 2 e&#8208;&#160;ORR. However, the general preparing method of O&#8208;G by the precursor of graphite has the disadvantages of consuming massive strong oxidant and washing water. Herein, the biomass&#8208;based graphene with tunable oxygen species is rapidly fabricated by CO2&#160;laser. In a flow cell setup, the laser&#8208;induced graphene (LIG) with abundant active oxygen species and graphene structure shows high catalytic performance including high Faraday efficiency (over 78%) and high mass activity (814 mmolgcatalyst&#8208;1&#160;h&#8208;1), superior to most of the reported carbon&#8208;based electrocatalysts.&#160;Density function theory demonstrates the meta&#8208;C atoms at nearby C&#8208;O,&#160;O&#8208;C=O&#160;species are the key catalytic sites. Therefore, we develop one facile method to rapidly convert biomass to graphene electrocatalyst used for H2O2&#160;synthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>Efficient and Selective of CO2 Electroreduction to HCOOH over Bismuth&#8208;Based Bromide Perovskites in Acidic Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal halide perovskites, primarily used as optoelectronic devices, have not been applied for electrochemical conversion due to their insufficient stability in moisture. Herein, we demonstrate two bismuth&#8208;based perovskites as novel electrocatalysts to convert CO2 into HCOOH in aqueous acidic media (pH 2.5), exhibiting a high Faradaic efficiency for HCOOH of &gt;80% in a wide potential range from &#8722;0.75 to &#8722;1.25 V. Their structural evolution against water were dynamically monitored by in situ spectra. Theoretical calculations further reveal that the formation of intermediate OCHO* on bismuth sites of Cs3Bi2Br9(111) play a pivotal role toward HCOOH production, which has a lower energy barrier than that on Cs2AgBiBr6(001) surfaces. Significantly, we found that CO2 react with protons instead of water can enhance CO2 reduction rate and suppress hydrogen evolution by avoiding carbonate formation in acidic electrolytes. This work paves the way for the extensive investigation of halide perovskites in aqueous systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Metal&#8211;ligand Lability and Ligand Mobility Enables Framework Transformation via Ligand Release in a Family of Crystalline 2D Coordination Polymers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two&#8208;dimensional coordination polymers exhibit ligand extrusion into the vapour phase on heating to undergo an extensive structural reorganisation involving bond breaking and formation, ligand migration and reorientation. The reactions occur with retention of crystallinity and have been followed in&#8197;situ by PXRD.







Abstract
A family of seven silver(I)&#8208;perfluorocarboxylate&#8208;quinoxaline coordination polymers, [Ag4(O2CRF)4(quin)4] 1&#8211;5 (RF=(CF2)n&#8208;1CF3)4, n=1 to 5); [Ag4(O2C(CF2)2CO2)2(quin)4] 6; [Ag4(O2CC6F5)4(quin)4] 7 (quin=quinoxaline), denoted by composition as 4&#8201;:&#8201;4&#8201;:&#8201;4 phases, was synthesised from reaction of the corresponding silver(I) perfluorocarboxylate with excess quinoxaline. Compounds 1&#8211;7 adopt a common 2D layered structure in which 1D silver&#8208;perfluorcarboxylate chains are crosslinked by ditopic quinoxaline ligands. Solid&#8208;state reaction upon heating, involving loss of one equivalent of quinoxaline, yielding new crystalline 4&#8201;:&#8201;4&#8201;:&#8201;3 phases [Ag4(O2C(CF2)n&#8208;1CF3)4(quin)3]n (8&#8211;10, n=1 to 3), was followed in&#8197;situ by PXRD and TGA studies. Crystal structures were confirmed by direct syntheses and structure determination. The solid&#8208;state reaction converting 4&#8201;:&#8201;4&#8201;:&#8201;4 to 4&#8201;:&#8201;4&#8201;:&#8201;3 phase materials involves cleavage and formation of Ag&#8722;N and Ag&#8722;O bonds to enable the structural rearrangement. One of the 4&#8201;:&#8201;4&#8201;:&#8201;3 phase coordination polymers (10) shows the remarkably high dielectric constant in the low electric field frequency range.

Ultra&#8208;pure&#8208;blue/green OLED: Three types of novel (N&#8722;B&#8722;O) embedded MR&#8208;TADF emitters are successfully developed for high efficiency and narrow emission organic light&#8208;emitting devices (OLEDs). In this study, the molecular orbital characters were regulated by adjusting the position of heteroatoms to achieve color&#8208;tunable of MR&#8208;TADF. The ultra&#8208;pure&#8208;blue/green devices exhibit high external quantum efficiency over 20&#8201;% and narrow full width at half maximum less than 50&#8197;nm.







Abstract
In this study, we synthesized and characterized multiresonant thermally activated delayed fluorescent (TADF) materials embedded with nitrogen&#8208;boron&#8208;oxygen (N&#8722;B&#8722;O), exhibiting color&#8208;tunability between blue and green, namely NBO, m&#8208;DiNBO, and p&#8208;DiNBO. The three emitter materials showed a high photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) and a state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art narrow full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 96&#8201;%/25&#8197;nm, 87&#8201;%/17&#8197;nm, and 99&#8201;%/19&#8197;nm, respectively. For m&#8208;DiNBO and p&#8208;DiNBO, the emission color could be tuned from blue to green by regulating the nonbonding/bonding molecular orbital characters. Owing to the expanded planar molecular structure, m&#8208;DiNBO and p&#8208;DiNBO showed high horizontal dipole ratio (&#920;) of 88&#8201;% and 92&#8201;%, respectively. OLEDs were prepared with NBO, m&#8208;DiNBO, and p&#8208;DiNBO, exhibiting high external quantum efficiencies of 16.8&#8201;%, 24.2&#8201;%, and 21.6&#8201;%, respectively. NBO and m&#8208;DiNBO exhibited pure&#8208;blue emission with CIE coordinates of (0.137, 0.142) and (0.126, 0.098), respectively. p&#8208;DiNBO showed pure&#8208;green emission with a CIE coordinate of (0.258, 0.665).

         <title>In Situ Grignard Metalation Method for the Synthesis of Hauser Bases</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Magnesium is an alkaline&#8208;earth metal of low reactivity. Therefore, direct metalation of primary and secondary amines yielding Hauser bases is impossible. The addition of bromoethane to a suspension of Mg metal and amine in an ethereal solvent allows the smooth syntheses of large amounts of amidomagnesium bromides without intermediate work&#8208;up procedures.







Abstract
The in situ Grignard Metalation Method (iGMM) is a straightforward one&#8208;pot procedure to quickly produce multigram amounts of Hauser bases R2N&#8208;MgBr which are valuable and vastly used metalation reagents and novel electrolytes for magnesium batteries. During addition of bromoethane to a suspension of Mg metal and secondary amine at room temperature in an ethereal solvent, a smooth reaction yields R2N&#8208;MgBr under evolution of ethane within a few hours. A Schlenk equilibrium is operative, interconverting the Hauser bases into their solvated homoleptic congeners Mg(NR2)2 and MgBr2 depending on the solvent. Scope and preconditions are studied, and side reactions limiting the yield have been investigated. DOSY&#8197;NMR experiments and X&#8208;ray crystal structures of characteristic examples clarify aggregation in solution and the solid state.

         <title>Rapid Discrimination of Bacterial Drug Resistivity by Array&#8208;Based Cross&#8208;Validation Using 2D MoS2</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Spot the difference: A sensor array comprising cationic 2D MoS2 and GFP has been used to discriminate bacterial analytes. By using this optimized sensor array, bacteria and lysates belonging to different types and with different amounts of drug resistivity were successfully classified. Cross validation of blind samples through combined analysis of bacterial cell and lysates provided improved detection accuracy.







Abstract
The precise discrimination of microbes based on family, class and drug resistivity is essential for the early diagnosis of infectious diseases. Information about the type and strength of drug resistivity can help the analyst to prescribe a suitable antibiotic at the proper dosage to completely eradicate microbes without giving them a chance to gain further resistance. Herein, we propose a sensor array based on the use of cationic two&#8208;dimensional MoS2 units and green fluorescence protein as building blocks. Cationic surfaces of receptors with various functionality were suitable for tunable interaction with anionic surfaces of microbes. The array successfully discriminates six different bacterial strains. The versatile ability of the receptors to bind with the wild&#8208;type as well as the corresponding ampicillin&#8208;resistant strain contributed significantly to rapid detection with high sensitivity. The optimized array was able to classify five different types and three different extents of drug&#8208;resistant variants of Escherichia coli by using bacteria cells and lysates. Finally, we have introduced the cross identification method using both bacteria cells and lysates and we found a great enhancement of detection in sensitivity and accuracy. This is the first report of this approach, which can be extended to many other methods for better accuracy in array&#8208;based detection.

         <title>Chemically Laminated 2D Bis(terpyridine)metal Polymer Films: Formation Mechanism at the Liquid&#8211;Liquid Interface and Redox Rectification</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Heterolaminated bis(terpyridine)metal films have been prepared by sequential coordination at the H2O/CH2Cl2 interface. In the reaction, metal ions permeate the grown films from the aqueous phase to react with the terpyridine ligand on the organic&#8208;phase side. The heterolaminated films show unique redox behavior based on electron transfer mediation, and a stable rectification character owing to the difference in electron transfer kinetics between the two layers. More information can be found in the Research Article by H. Nishihara and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202201316).

         <title>Self&#8208;assembled nano&#8208;filamentous zeolite catalyst to realize efficient one&#8208;step ethanol synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The non&#8208;petroleum synthesis route of ethanol from syngas with methyl acetate (MA)&#160;as the core intermediate product has been confirmed as an excellent industrialization route for high purity ethanol production. However, as the central part of this tandem&#8208;catalysis path, the carbonylation of dimethyl ether (DME) to MA is limited by the undesirable catalytic activity and stability of zeolite catalysts. Herein, a facile inhibitor&#8208;assisted strategy was developed for constructing self&#8208;assembled nano&#8208;MOR zeolites without using expensive or complex template. A nano&#8208;filamentous MOR zeolite with 70 nm crystal diameter was synthesized by controlling the crystal growth with a specific inhibitor. The performance of self&#8208;assembled nano&#8208;MOR catalysts was remarkably outstanding in DME carbonylation. The&#160;highest STY of MA was achieved over NF&#8208;MOR, which was significantly improved&#160;comparing with that of the traditional ES&#8208;MOR (3780 mmol/(kg&#183;h) vs 1368 mmol/(kg&#183;h)). One&#8208;step ethanol synthesis was realized by combining the MOR catalyst and an innovative self&#8208;reduced CZ/SiO2 catalyst. The tailor&#8208;made NF&#8208;MOR&amp;CZ/SiO2 combination obtained the highest STY of ethanol,&#160;4 times of the conventional ES&#8208;MOR&amp;CZ combination (1800 mmol/(kg&#183;h) vs 476 mmol/(kg&#183;h)). Our self&#8208;assembled zeolites synthetic strategy opens a new way for&#160;fabrication of high&#8208;performance zeolites for industrial applications in catalytic conversions of C1 small molecules to high value&#8208;added chemicals.</dc:description>

         <title>Unravelling the Role of the Pentafluoroorthotellurate Group as a Ligand in Nickel Chemistry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The pentafluoroorthotellurate group (teflate, OTeF5) is able to form species, for which only the fluoride analogues are known. Despite nickel fluorides being widely investigated, nickel teflates have remained elusive for decades. By reaction of [NiCl4]2&#8211; and neat ClOTeF5, we have synthesized the homoleptic [Ni(OTeF5)4]2&#8211; anion, which presents a distorted tetrahedral structure, unlike the polymeric [NiF4]2&#8211;. This high&#8208;spin complex has allowed the study of the electronic properties of the teflate group, which can be classified as a weak/medium&#8208;field ligand, and therefore behaves as the fluoride analogue also in ligand&#8208;field terms. The teflate ligands in [NEt4]2[Ni(OTeF5)4] are easily substituted, as shown by the formation of [Ni(NCMe)6][OTeF5]2 by dissolving it in acetonitrile. Nevertheless, careful reactions with other conventional ligands have enabled the crystallization of nickel teflate complexes with different coordination geometries, i.e. [NEt4]2[trans&#8208;Ni(OEt2)2(OTeF5)4] or [NEt4][Ni(bpyMe2)(OTeF5)3].</dc:description>

         <title>Bioorthogonal Click of Colloidal Gold Nanoparticles to Antibodies In Vivo</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Combining nanotechnology and bioorthogonal chemistry for theranostic strategies offers the possibility to develop next generation nanomedicines. These materials are thought to increase therapeutic outcome and improve current cancer management. Due to their size, nanomedicines target tumors passively. Thus, they can be used for drug delivery purposes. Bioorthogonal chemistry opens up for pretargeting. Higher target&#8208;to&#8208;background drug accumulation ratios can be achieved. Pretargeting can also be used to induce internalization processes or trigger controlled drug release. Colloidal gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) have attracted widespread interest as drug delivery vectors within the last decades. Here, we demonstrate &#8208; for the first time &#8208; the possibility to successfully ligate AuNPs in vivo to pretargeted monoclonal antibodies. We believe that this possibility will facilitate the development of AuNPs for clinical use and ultimately, improve state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art patient care.</dc:description>

         <title>In Situ Ternary Adduct Formation of Yttrium Polyaminocarboxylates Leads to Small Molecule Capture and Activation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this work we exploit the chemistry of yttrium complexes for small molecule capture and activation. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and density functional theory (DFT) studies were used to investigate the  in situ  formation of solution state ternary yttrium&#8208;acetate, yttrium&#8208;bicarbonate, and yttrium&#8208;pyruvate adducts with a range of polyaminocarboxylate chelates. These studies reveal that [Y(DO3A)(H  2  O)  2  ] (H  3  DO3A &#8722; 1,4,7,10&#8208;tetraazacyclododecane&#8208;1,4,7&#8208;tricarboxylic acid) and [Y(EDTA)(H  2  O)  2  ]  &#8208;  (H  4  EDTA &#8722; ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid) are able to form ternary adducts with bicarbonate and pyruvate. In the latter, unusual decarboxylation of pyruvate to form acetic acid and CO  2  was observed and further studied using SABRE&#8208;hyperpolarised  13  C NMR (SABRE &#8722; signal amplification by reversible exchange) to provide information about the reaction timescale and lifetime of intermediates involved in this conversion. The work presented demonstrates that yttrium complexes can capture and activate small molecules, which may lead to novel and useful applications of this metal in catalysis and medical imaging.</dc:description>

         <title>Two Tags in One Probe: Combining Fluorescence&#8208; and Biotin&#8208;based Detection of the Trypanosomal Cysteine Protease Rhodesain</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Rhodesain is the major cysteine protease of the protozoan parasite  Trypanosoma brucei  and a therapeutic target for sleeping sickness, a fatal neglected tropical disease. We designed, synthesized and characterized a bimodal activity&#8208;based probe that binds to and inactivates rhodesain. This probe exhibited an irreversible mode of action and extraordinary potency for the target protease with a  k  inac  /  K  i  value of 37,000 M  &#8208;1  s  &#8208;1  . Two reporter tags, a fluorescent coumarin moiety and a biotin affinity label, were incorporated into the probe and enabled highly sensitive detection of rhodesain in a complex proteome by in&#8208;gel fluorescence and on&#8208;blot chemiluminescence. Furthermore, the probe was employed for microseparation and quantification of rhodesain and for inhibitor screening using a competition assay. The developed bimodal rhodesain probe represents a new proteomic tool for studying  Trypanosoma  pathobiochemistry and antitrypanosomal drug discovery.</dc:description>

         <title>Nanoarchitectonics in the Ionothermal Synthesis for Nucleation of Crystalline Potassium Poly(heptazine imide) Towards an Enhanced Solar&#8208;Driven H2O2 Production</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Solar&#8208;driven selective oxygen reduction reaction on polymeric carbon nitride framework is one of the most promising approaches toward sustainable H  2  O  2  production. Potassium poly(heptazine imide) (PHI), with regular metal sites in the framework and favorable crystalline structure, is highly active for photocatalytic selective 2e oxygen reduction to produce H  2&#173;  O  2  . By introducing NH  4  Cl into the eutectic KCl&#8208;LiCl salt mixture, the PHI framework exhibits a remarkable performance for photocatalytic production of H  2  O  2  , e.g., a record high H  2  O  2  photo&#8208;production rate of 29.5  &#956;mol h  &#8722;1  mg  &#8722;1  .

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Solar-driven selective oxygen reduction reaction on polymeric carbon nitride framework is one of the most promising approaches toward sustainable H  2  O  2  production. Potassium poly(heptazine imide) (PHI), with regular metal sites in the framework and favorable crystalline structure, is highly active for photocatalytic selective 2e oxygen reduction to produce H  2&#173;  O  2  . By introducing NH  4  Cl into the eutectic KCl-LiCl salt mixture, the PHI framework exhibits a remarkable performance for photocatalytic production of H  2  O  2  , e.g., a record high H  2  O  2  photo-production rate of 29.5  &#956;mol h  &#8722;1  mg  &#8722;1  . The efficient photocatalytic performance is attributed to the favorable properties of the new PHI framework, such as improved porosity, negatively shifted LUMO position, enhanced exciton dissociation and charges migration properties  .  A mechanistic investigation by quenching and electron spin resonance technique reveals the critical role of superoxide radicals for the formation singlet oxygen, and the singlet oxygen is one of the critical intermediates towards the formation of the H  2  O  2  by proton extraction from the ethanol.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Indole&#8208;based long&#8208;wavelength fluorescent probes for bioimaging of S&#8208;nitrosylation in mitochondria</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>S  &#8208;Nitrosylation has been found to play an important role in regulating mitochondrial function. However, probes for detection of protein  S  &#8208;nitrosylation in mitochondria remain unexplored. Herein, a novel 4&#8208;(pyridin&#8208;4&#8208;yl)vinyl&#8208;substituted indole was designed, exhibiting a long&#8208;wavelength emission and a high fluorescent quantum yield. Functionalization of the 7&#8208;position of the indole ring with an arylphosphine ester resulted with probes with efficient mitochondria&#8208;targeting ability. Furthermore, the indole&#8208;arylphosphine displayed a significant fluorescence enhancement upon exposure to  S  &#8208;nitrosoglutathione (GSNO) at low micromolar concentrations in A431 cells. Taken together, this study provides a new indole&#8208;based fluorescent probe with a unique long&#8208;wavelength emission for direct detection of  S  &#8208;nitrosylation in mitochondria, which may represent a powerful tool for understanding the critical roles of  S  &#8208;nitrosylation within mitochondria of living organisms.</dc:description>

         <title>A Tumor&#8208;Targeting Dual&#8208;Stimuli&#8208;Activatable Photodynamic Molecular Beacon for Precise Photodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A multifunctional&#160;photodynamic molecular beacon (PMB) has been designed and synthesized which contains an epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)&#8208;targeting cyclic peptide and a trimeric phthalocyanine skeleton in which the three zinc(II) phthalocyanine units are each substituted with a glutathione (GSH)&#8208;responsive 2,4&#8208;dinitrobenzenesulfonate (DNBS) quencher and are linked&#160;via&#160;two cathepsin B&#8208;cleavable GFLG peptide chains. This tailor&#8208;made conjugate is fully quenched in the native form due to the photoinduced electron transfer effect of the DNBS moieties and the self&#8208;quenching of the phthalocyanine units. It can target the EGFR overexpressed in cancer cells, and after receptor&#8208;mediated endocytosis, it can be activated selectively by the co&#8208;existence of intracellular GSH and cathepsin B, both of which are also overproduced in cancer cells, in terms of fluorescence emission and singlet oxygen generation. The cell&#8208;selective behavior of this PMB has been demonstrated using a range of cancer cells with different expression levels of EGFR, while the stimuli&#8208;responsive properties have been studied both&#160;in vitro&#160;and in various aqueous media. The overall results show that this advanced PMB, which exhibits several levels of control of the tumor specificity, is a promising photosensitizer for precise antitumoral photodynamic therapy.</dc:description>

         <title>In Situ Preparation of CsPbBr3@CsPb2Br5 Composite Assisted with Water as a Highly Efficient and Stable Catalyst for Photothermal CO2 Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lead halide perovskite has triggered a lot of research due to its superior optical properties. However, halide perovskite materials have poor environmental stabilities and are easily affected by external factors such as water and heat, resulting in structural decomposition and performance failure. Contrary to this commonplace concept, CsPbBr3 can convert to CsPb2Br5 partially when meeting a small amount of water, and the CsPbBr3@CsPb2Br5 composite is synthesized by an in&#8197;situ method accordingly. The CsPbBr3@CsPb2Br5 composite shows an enhanced catalytic performance compared with pure CsPbBr3, as well as a dramatically synergistic effect of photo and thermal for catalytic CO2 hydrogenation.







Abstract
Lead halide perovskite has triggered a lot of research due to its superior optical properties. However, halide perovskite materials have poor environmental stabilities and are easily affected by external factors such as water and heat, resulting in structural decomposition and performance failure. Contrary to this commonplace concept, it is found that CsPbBr3 (CPB) can convert to CsPb2Br5 (CP2B5) partially when meeting a small amount of water, and the CsPbBr3@CsPb2Br5 (CPB@CP2B5) composite is synthesized by an in&#8197;situ method accordingly. The CPB@CP2B5 composite shows an enhanced catalytic performance compared with pure CPB, as well as a dramatically synergistic effect of photo and thermal for catalytic CO2 hydrogenation. The CO production rate of CPB@CP2B5 is determined as 69&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 under light irradiation at 200&#8201;&#176;C, which is 156.8 and 43.4 times higher than that under pure photo (0.44&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h &#8722;1) and pure thermal (1.59&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h &#8722;1) condition, respectively. Meanwhile, the CPB@CP2B5 sample is also stable, which shows no significant decline in the catalytic activity during 8 cycles of repeated experiments. The probable mechanism is explored by utilizing a series of in&#8197;situ characterizations.

         <title>Carbon&#8208;Based Materials as Lithium Hosts for Lithium Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Owing to their low costs, high specific surface areas, high electrical conductivities, and wide electrochemical stabilities, carbon&#8208;based materials are prime candidates for use as Li hosts. This concept article describes a series of structurally&#8208;unique carbon&#8208;based materials that have been used in Li storage applications and includes an examination of the underlying mechanisms of Li dendrite growth and suppression as well as an outlook for the field.







Abstract
Lithium (Li) metal has attracted significant attention in areas that range from basic research to various commercial applications due to its high theoretical specific capacity (3860&#8197;mA&#8201;h&#8201;g&#8722;1) and low electrochemical potential (&#8722;3.04 vs. standard hydrogen electrode). However, dendrites often form on the surfaces of Li metal anodes during cycling and thus lead to battery failure and, in some cases, raise safety concerns. To overcome this problem, a variety of approaches that vary the electrolyte, membrane, and/or anode have been proposed. Among these efforts, the use of three&#8208;dimensional frameworks as Li hosts, which can homogenize and minimize the current density at the anode surface, is an effective approach to suppress the formation of Li dendrites. Herein, we describe the development of using carbon&#8208;based materials as Li hosts. While these materials can be fabricated into a variety of porous structures, they have a number of intrinsic advantages including low costs, high specific surface areas, high electrical conductivities, and wide electrochemical stabilities. After briefly summarizing the formation mechanisms of Li dendrites, various methods for controlling structural and surface chemistry will be described for different types of carbon&#8208;based materials from the viewpoint of improving their performance as Li hosts. Finally, we provide perspective on the future development of Li host materials needed to meet the requirements for their use in flexible and wearable devices and other contemporary energy storage techniques.

         <title>Layered Oxide Cathodes Promoted by Crystal Regulation Strategies for Potassium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Transition metal (TM) layered oxides with rigid frameworks and two&#8208;dimensional ion diffusion pathways have been extensively studied in potassium&#8208;ion batteries. To improve their potassium storage properties, a series of crystal tuning strategies have been developed, including TM layer regulation, potassium and oxygen layers regulation, construction of hierarchical structure, air&#8208;stabilized TM layered oxides.







Abstract
Layered oxide cathodes have demonstrated great potential for potassium&#8208;ion batteries (PIBs) on account of high reversible capacity, appropriate diffusion paths, and low cost. However, their electrochemical performance in PIBs is generally worse than that in lithium&#8208;ion batteries due to large structural changes and deformations during charging and discharging. To improve their potassium storage performance, a series of strategies have been developed in recent studies. In this review, we summarize the latest advancements in layered oxide cathodes for PIBs through different crystal regulation strategies, including transition metal layer doping, potassium content optimization, oxygen partial substitution, functional morphology construction and air stability improvement. Meanwhile, the relationship between the electrochemical properties and structural evolution of these modified cathodes is also investigated. In addition, the challenges and prospects of these layered oxide cathodes in PIBs are analyzed in detail, providing constructive insights for future applications of PIBs.

         <title>Suppression of Liquid&#8208;Liquid Phase Separation and Aggregation of Antibodies by Modest Pressure Application</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydrostatic pressures of a few tens of to hundred bar are sufficient to suppress liquid&#8211;liquid phase separation and subsequent aggregation and fibril formation of immunoglobulins. The immunoglobulin molecules themselves are highly resistant to unfolding under pressure, however, so the immunological activity of foods processed under high pressure is preserved.







Abstract
The high colloidal stability of antibody (immunoglobulin) solutions is important for pharmaceutical applications. Inert cosolutes, excipients, are generally used in therapeutic protein formulations to minimize physical instabilities, such as liquid&#8211;liquid phase separation (LLPS), aggregation and precipitation, which are often encountered during manufacturing and storage. Despite their widespread use, a detailed understanding of how excipients modulate the specific protein&#8208;protein interactions responsible for these instabilities is still lacking. In this work, we demonstrate the high sensitivity to pressure of globulin condensates as a suitable means to suppress LLPS and subsequent aggregation of concentrated antibody solutions. The addition of excipients has only a minor effect. The high pressure sensitivity observed is due to the fact that these flexible Y&#8208;shaped molecules create a considerable amount of void volume in the condensed phase, leading to an overall decrease in the volume of the system upon dissociation of the droplet phase by pressure already at a few tens of to hundred bar. Moreover, we show that immunoglobulin molecules themselves are highly resistant to unfolding under pressure, and can even sustain pressures up to about 6&#8197;kbar without conformational changes. This implies that immunoglobulins are resistant to the pressure treatment of foods, such as milk, in high&#8208;pressure food&#8208;processing technologies, thereby preserving their immunological activity.

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light Mediated Arbuzov&#8208;Like Reaction with Thiophenols</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A visible light mediated Arbuzov type reaction of thiophenols and phosphites to access phosphorothioates under mild metal&#8208;free conditions was demonstrated.







Abstract
We hereby disclose, a visible light mediated addition of sulfenyl radicals to trialkyl phosphites to access functionalized phosphorothioates. The use of cheap and readily available Eosin Y as a photocatalyst under mild energy efficient conditions bypassing the use of external oxidants forms the chief highlight of the work. The protocol is scalable and mechanistic studies indicate that the reaction proceeds through an ionic&#8208;Arbuzov like pathway from phosphoranyl radicals.

         <title>Targeting Pathogenic DNA and RNA Repeats: A Conceptual Therapeutic Way for Repeat Expansion Diseases</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The unusual structures of DNA and RNA repeats play a key role in the development of some human neurodegenerative diseases which are also called as repeat expansion diseases. Therapeutic targeting of these pathogenic DNA and RNA repeats with small&#8208;molecule drugs offers a potential way to cure repeat expansion diseases.







Abstract
Expansions of short tandem repeats (STRs) in the human genome cause nearly 50 neurodegenerative diseases, which are mostly inheritable, nonpreventable and incurable, posing as a huge threat to human health. Non&#8208;B DNAs formed by STRs are thought to be structural intermediates that can cause repeat expansions. The subsequent transcripts harboring expanded RNA repeats can further induce cellular toxicity through forming specific structures. Direct targeting of these pathogenic DNA and RNA repeats has emerged as a new potential therapeutic strategy to cure repeat expansion diseases. In this conceptual review, we first introduce the roles of DNA and RNA structures in the genetic instabilities and pathomechanisms of repeat expansion diseases, then describe structural features of DNA and RNA repeats with a focus on the tertiary structures determined by X&#8208;ray crystallography and solution nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and finally discuss recent progress and perspectives of developing chemical tools that target pathogenic DNA and RNA repeats for curing repeat expansion diseases.

         <title>In Situ Observation of Hot Carrier Transfer at Plasmonic Au/Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks (MOFs) Interfaces</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
MOF structures possess the advantage of molecular&#8208;level tunability via functionalization of both secondary building units (SBUs) and organic ligands, which manipulate interface charge transfer and separation on plasmonic photocatalysts. It is observed that hot electrons on Au can be captured by the coordinatively unsaturated sites of SBUs in MOF structures, while hot holes on Au tend to transfer to and be trapped at the functionalized organic ligand.







Abstract
Constructing heterostructures have been demonstrated as an ideal strategy for boosting charge separation on plasmonic photocatalysts, but the detailed interface charge transfer mechanism remains elusive. Herein, that authors fabricate plasmonic Au and metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs, NH2&#8722;MIL&#8208;125 and MIL&#8208;125 used in this work) heterostructures and explore the interface charge transfer mechanism by in&#8197;situ electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy and electrochemical measurements. The plasmon&#8208;excited hot electrons on Au can transfer across the Au/MOF interface and be captured by the coordinatively unsaturated sites of secondary building units (Ti8O8(OH)4 cluster) of the MOF structure, and the plasmon&#8208;excited hot holes on Au tend to transfer to and be trapped at the functionalized organic ligand (1,4&#8208;benzenedicarboxylate&#8722;NH2). The spatially separated hot electrons and holes exhibit boosted the photocatalytic activity for chromium (VI) reduction and selective benzyl alcohol oxidation. This work illustrates the advantage of the versatile functionalization of MOF structures enabling molecular&#8208;level manipulation of interface charge transfer on plasmonic photocatalysts.

         <title>Enhanced Photoelectrochemical Water Splitting of Black Silicon Photoanode by pH&#8208;Dependent Copper&#8208;Bipyridine Catalysts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Since the water oxidation half&#8208;reaction requires the transfer of multi&#8208;electrons and the formation of O&#8208;O bond, it&#8217;s crucial to investigate the catalytic behaviours of semiconductor photoanodes. In this work, a bio&#8208;inspired copper&#8208;bipyridine catalyst of Cu(dcbpy) is decorated on the nanoporous Si photoanode (black Si,  b  &#8208;Si). Under AM1.5G illumination, the  b  &#8208;Si/Cu(dcbpy) photoanode exhibits a high photocurrent density of 6.31 mA cm  &#8208;2  at 1.5 V  RHE  at pH 11.0, which is dramatically improved from the  b  &#8208;Si photoanode (1.03 mA cm  &#8208;2  ) and  f  &#8208;Si photoanode (0.0087 mA cm  &#8208;2  ). Mechanism studies demonstrate that  b  &#8208;Si/Cu(dcbpy) has improved light&#8208;harvesting, interfacial charge&#8208;transfer, and surface area for water splitting. More interestingly,  b  &#8208;Si/Cu(dcbpy) exhibits a pH&#8208;dependent water oxidation behaviour with a minimum Tafel slope of 241 mV/dec and the lowest overpotential of 0.19 V at pH 11.0, which is due to the monomer/dimer equilibrium of copper catalyst. At pH ~11, the formation of dimeric hydroxyl&#8208;complex could form O&#8208;O bond through a redox isomerization (RI) mechanism, which decreases the required potential for water oxidation. This in&#8208;depth understanding of pH&#8208;dependent water oxidation catalyst brings insights into the design of dimer water oxidation catalysts and efficient photoanodes for solar energy conversion.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Since the water oxidation half-reaction requires the transfer of multi-electrons and the formation of O-O bond, it&#8217;s crucial to investigate the catalytic behaviours of semiconductor photoanodes. In this work, a bio-inspired copper-bipyridine catalyst of Cu(dcbpy) is decorated on the nanoporous Si photoanode (black Si,  b  -Si). Under AM1.5G illumination, the  b  -Si/Cu(dcbpy) photoanode exhibits a high photocurrent density of 6.31 mA cm  -2  at 1.5 V  RHE  at pH 11.0, which is dramatically improved from the  b  -Si photoanode (1.03 mA cm  -2  ) and  f  -Si photoanode (0.0087 mA cm  -2  ). Mechanism studies demonstrate that  b  -Si/Cu(dcbpy) has improved light-harvesting, interfacial charge-transfer, and surface area for water splitting. More interestingly,  b  -Si/Cu(dcbpy) exhibits a pH-dependent water oxidation behaviour with a minimum Tafel slope of 241 mV/dec and the lowest overpotential of 0.19 V at pH 11.0, which is due to the monomer/dimer equilibrium of copper catalyst. At pH ~11, the formation of dimeric hydroxyl-complex could form O-O bond through a redox isomerization (RI) mechanism, which decreases the required potential for water oxidation. This in-depth understanding of pH-dependent water oxidation catalyst brings insights into the design of dimer water oxidation catalysts and efficient photoanodes for solar energy conversion.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Expanding Catch and Release DNA Decoy (CRDD) Technology with Pyrimidine Mimics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Catch and Release DNA Decoys (CRDDs) utilize photochemically responsive nucleoside analogues that generate abasic sites upon exposure to light. Herein, we describe the synthesis and evaluation of four candidate CRDD monomers containing nucleobases that mimic endogenous pyrimidines: 2&#8208;nitroimidazole (2NI), 2&#8208;nitrobenzene (2&#8208;NB), 2&#8208;nitropyrrole (2&#8208;NP) and 3&#8208;nitropyrrole (3&#8208;NP). Our studies reveal that 2&#8208;NI and 2&#8208;NP can function as CRDDs, whereas 3&#8208;NP and 2&#8208;NB undergo decomposition and transformation to a higher&#8208;ordered structure upon photolysis, respectively. When incorporated into DNA, 2&#8208;NP undergoes rapid photochemical cleavage of the anomeric bond (1.8 min half&#8208;life) to yield an abasic site. Finally, we find that all four pyrimidine mimics show significantly greater stability when base&#8208;paired against the previously reported, 7&#8208;nitroindole CRDD monomer. Our work marks the expansion of CRDD technology to both purine and pyrimidine scaffolds.</dc:description>

         <title>Influence of the Intramolecular Hydrogen Bond on the Fluorescence of 2&#8208;ortho&#8208;Aminophenyl Pyridines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The dynamic nature of Excited State Intramolecular Proton Transfer (ESIPT) and its effect on the emission spectrum is an attractive strategy to create multi&#8208;emissive dyes. Here we describe the behavior of a series of hydrogen&#8208;bonded triphenylpyridines having a set of donor&#8208;acceptor combinations that allowed us to perceive the influence of each substitution on the photophysical properties of the dyes. The susceptibility of these ESIPT moieties to pH variations was also studied, elucidating that the level of protonation had a significant effect on the emission colour. The assignment of each emission band was made using DFT and td&#8208;DFT calculations that were in agreement with the experimental results. This study emphasizes the versatility of triphenylpyridines that can be synthetized effortlessly with logical C&#8208;2, C&#8208;4 and C&#8208;6 independent substitution, in order to have the desired ESIPT modulation and subsequent multi&#8208;emission response.</dc:description>

         <title>Role of Phosphonate Ligand Length and Solution Temperature in the Colloidal Stability of TiO2 Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Surface ligands are essential tools for the stabilization of colloidal nanoparticles (NPs) in solvents. However, knowledge regarding the effects of the ligand shell, especially the ligand length, is insufficient and controversial. Here we demonstrate solution&#8208;based experiments on  n&#8208;  alkylphosphonate&#8208;capped TiO  2  NPs to investigate the effects of ligand length and solution temperature on colloidal stability. A robust ligand exchange process is achieved, which enables free ligands and impurities away from the colloidal solution. In the case of 8 nm anatase NPs in toluene, the dodecylphosphonate ligand provided better colloidal stability than all the other  n&#8208;  alkylphosphonate ligands. In addition, relaxation studies suggested there is kinetic hysteresis in the dispersion/agglomeration transition. The proposed method is applicable to a wide range of surface ligands designed to maximize the colloidal stability of NPs.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Engineered heme protein biocatalysts provide an efficient and sustainable approach to develop amine&#8208;containing compounds through C&#8208;H amination. A quantum chemical study to reveal the complete heme catalyzed intramolecular C&#8208;H amination pathway and protein axial ligand effect was reported, using reactions of an experimentally used arylsulfonylazide with hemes containing L = none, SH  &#8208;  , MeO  &#8208;  , and MeOH to simulate no axial ligand, negatively charged Cys and Ser ligands, and a neutral ligand for comparison. Nitrene formation was found as the overall rate&#8208;determining step (RDS) and the catalyst with Ser ligand has the best reactivity, consistent with experimental reports. Both RDS and non&#8208;RDS (nitrene transfer) transition states follow the barrier trend of MeO  &#8208;  &lt; SH  &#8208;  &lt; MeOH &lt; None due to the charge donation capability of the axial ligand to influence the key charge transfer process as the electronic driving forces. Results also provide new ideas for future biocatalyst design with enhanced reactivities.</dc:description>

         <title>Insight into the Structural Variation and Sodium Storage Behavior of Polyoxometalates Encapsulated within Single&#8208;Walled Carbon Nanotubes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The host&#8208;guest interaction can remarkably alter the physiochemical properties of composite materials. It is crucial to clarify the mechanism by revealing the influence of the host on the electronic structure of the guest molecules. Herein, we study the structural variation of polyoxometalates (POMs) after being confined in single&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes (SWNT). What we found is that in addition to the reported charge transfer from SWNT to POM, an intramolecular electron transfer within a single POM cluster can be observed in the POM@SWNT composites. Moreover, the charge density on the bridged oxygen&#160;of POMs is prominently enhanced. The structural change and electron reconfiguration of POMs upon encapsulation in SWNT significantly speed up electron and ion transport, leading to the improved electrochemical performance for sodium ions storage.</dc:description>

         <title>Selective Oxidations Using a Cytochrome P450 Enzyme Variant Driven with Surrogate Oxygen Donors and Light</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A single amino acid mutation can convert cytochrome P450 monooxygenases into peroxygenase. These do not require the addition of nicotinamide cofactors or electron transfer proteins greatly simplifying their application. For example, urea&#8208;hydrogen peroxide and light can be used to drive the selective oxidations catalysed by these enzymes.







Abstract
Cytochrome P450 monooxygenase enzymes are versatile catalysts, which have been adapted for multiple applications in chemical synthesis. Mutation of a highly conserved active site threonine to a glutamate can convert these enzymes into peroxygenases that utilise hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). Here, we use the T252E&#8208;CYP199A4 variant to study peroxide&#8208;driven oxidation activity by using H2O2 and urea&#8208;hydrogen peroxide (UHP). We demonstrate that the T252E variant has a higher stability to H2O2 in the presence of substrate that can undergo carbon&#8208;hydrogen abstraction. This peroxygenase variant could efficiently catalyse O&#8208;demethylation and an enantioselective epoxidation reaction (94&#8201;% ee). Neither the monooxygenase nor peroxygenase pathways of the P450 demonstrated a significant kinetic isotope effect (KIE) for the oxidation of deuterated substrates. These new peroxygenase variants offer the possibility of simpler cytochrome P450 systems for selective oxidations. To demonstrate this, a light driven H2O2 generating system was used to support efficient product formation with this peroxygenase enzyme.

         <title>Synthesis and Biological Evaluation of Water&#8208;Soluble Esterase&#8208;Activated CO&#8208;Releasing Molecules Targeting Mitochondria</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ionic moiety makes the difference. A pyridinium salt in the ester side chain not only improves the water solubility of acyloxydiene&#8208;Fe(CO)3 complexes but also directs these prodrugs to mitochondria, where they are triggered by an esterase to release carbon monoxide as an anti&#8208;inflammatory and cytoprotective agent directly effecting the metabolic state of the cells.







Abstract
Due to the beneficial effects of carbon monoxide as a cell&#8208;protective and anti&#8208;inflammatory agent, CO&#8208;releasing molecules (CORMs) offer some promising potential applications in medicine. In this context, we synthesized a set of acyloxy&#8208;cyclohexadiene&#8208;Fe(CO)3 complexes, all displaying a N&#8208;methyl&#8208;pyridinium triflate moiety in the ester side chain, as mitochondria&#8208;targeting esterase&#8208;triggered CORM prodrugs. Whereas the compounds in which the acyloxy substituent is attached to the 2&#8208;position of the diene&#8208;Fe(CO)3 unit (A series) spontaneously release CO upon dissolution in phosphate buffer, which remarkably is partly suppressed in the presence of porcine liver esterase (PLE), the 1&#8208;substituted isomers (B series) show the expected PLE&#8208;induced release of CO (up to 3&#8197;equiv.). The biological activity of Mito&#8208;CORMs 2/3&#8208;B and their isophorone&#8208;derived analogs 2/3&#8208;A&#8217;, which also displayed PLE&#8208;induced CO release, was assessed by using human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC). Whereas Mito&#8208;CORMs 2/3&#8208;B were not cytotoxic up to 500&#8197;&#956;M (MTT assay), Mito&#8208;CORMs 2/3&#8208;A&#8217; caused significant toxicity at concentrations above 50&#8197;&#956;M. The anti&#8208;inflammatory potential of both Mito&#8208;CORM variants was demonstrated by concentration&#8208;dependent down&#8208;regulation of the pro&#8208;inflammatory markers VCAM&#8208;1, ICAM&#8208;1 and CXCL1 as well as induction of HO&#8208;1 in TNF&#945;&#8208;stimulated human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs; western blotting and qPCR). Energy phenotyping by seahorse real&#8208;time cell metabolic analysis, revealed opposing shifts of metabolic potentials in cells treated either with Mito&#8208;CORMs 2/3&#8208;B (increased mitochondrial respiration and glycolytic activity) or Mito&#8208;CORMs 2/3&#8208;A&#8217; (suppressed mitochondrial respiration and increased glycolytic activity). Thus, the Mito&#8208;CORMs represent valuable tools for the safe and targeted delivery of CO to mitochondria as a subcellular compartment to induce positive anti&#8208;inflammatory effects with only minor shifts in cellular energy metabolism. Also, due to their water solubility, these compounds provide a promising starting point for further pharmacological studies.

         <title>Photothermal Oxidation of Cinnamyl Alcohol with Hydrogen Peroxide Catalyzed by Gold Nanoparticle/Antimony&#8208;Doped Tin Oxide Nanocrystals</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Gold nanoparticle&#8208;loaded, antimony&#8208;doped tin oxide nanocrystals (Au/ATO NCs) show thermally activated catalytic activity for the oxidation of cinnamyl alcohol to cinnamaldehyde by hydrogen peroxide. Light irradiation (&#955;ex&gt;660&#8197;nm, &#8764;0.5 sun) of Au/ATO NCs gives rise to a more than twofold increase in the rate of reaction with &#8764;95&#8201;% selectivity. Kinetic analyses indicated that the striking enhancement of the reaction stems from the rise in the temperature near the catalyst surface of &#8764;30&#8197;K due to the photothermal effect of the ATO NCs. More information can be found in the Research Article by H. Tada and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202201653).

         <title>An Iodide&#8208;mediated Anodic Amide Coupling</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The ubiquity of amide bonds, present in natural products and common pharmaceuticals renders this functional group one of the most prevalent in organic chemistry. Despite its importance and a wide variety of existing methods for its formation, the latter still can be a challenge for classical activating reagents such as chloridating agents or carbodiimides. As the spent reagents often cannot be recycled, the development of more sustainable methods is highly desirable. Herein, we report an operationally simple and mild indirect electrochemical protocol to effect the condensation of carboxylic acids with amines, forming a wide variety of carboxamides.</dc:description>

         <title>One Fluorophore&#8208;Two Sensing Films: Hydrogen&#8208;Bond Directed Formation of a Quadruple Perylene Bisimide Stack</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Elaborately designed &#960;&#8208;stacked molecular aggregates are significant for modulation of photophysical properties of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). Herein, a double hydrogen&#8208;bonds trussed di(pyridyl)pyrrole&#8208;perylene bisimide (HDPP&#8208;PBI) was designed and its dimerization behavior was studied. HDPP&#8208;PBI tends to form a quadruple PBI stack with a dimerization constant of ~5.56 &#215; 10  6  M  &#8208;1  . The dimerization was ascribed to synergistic intramolecular double hydrogen&#8208;bonds formation and intermolecular &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking. Addition of CF  3  COOH, a hydrogen bond blocker, promotes the dimer to monomer transition. Accordingly, two distinct fluorescent films were prepared by drop&#8208;casting of the dimerized or the monomeric HDPP&#8208;PBI onto a substrate surface. Interestingly, the less&#8208;emissive PBI quadruple stack&#8208;based film showed a turn on response to acetone vapor, while the highly emissive HDPP&#8208;PBI&#8208;based film exhibited fluorescence quenching upon exposure to triethylamine vapor. We believe that the discovered synergistic effect in the PBI aggregates would enlighten the design of new PAHs aggregates with defined structures.</dc:description>

         <title>Mechanistic and Kinetic Investigations of ON/OFF (Photo)Switchable Binding of Carbon Monoxide by Chromium(0), Molybdenum(0) and Tungsten(0) Carbonyl Complexes with a Pyridyl&#8208;Mesoionic Carbene Ligand</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Shining light on group 6&#8201;photochemistry: The reversible (photo)chemistry of chromium(0), molybdenum(0) and tungsten(0) carbonyl complexes containing a mesoionic carbene ligand has been investigated. Kinetic and mechanistic studies were performed by using (temperature&#8208;dependent) FTIR and UV/VIS spectroscopy, in combination with density functional theory calculations.







Abstract
This work tackles the photochemistry of a series of mononuclear Cr0, Mo0 and W0 carbonyl complexes containing a bidentate mesoionic carbene ligand of the 1,2,3&#8208;triazol&#8208;5&#8208;ylidene type. FTIR spectroscopy, combined with density functional theory calculations, revealed a clean photo&#8208;induced reaction in organic solvents (acetonitrile, pyridine, valeronitrile) to give mainly one photoproduct with monosubstitution of a carbonyl ligand for a solvent molecule. The highest photodissociation quantum yields were reached for the Cr0 complex under UV irradiation (266&#8197;nm). Based on previous investigations, the kinetics of the dark reverse reactions have now been determined, with reaction times of up to several hours in pyridine. Photochemical studies in the solid state (KBr matrix, frozen solution) also showed light&#8208;induced reactivity with stabilization of the metastable intermediate with a free coordination site at very low temperature. The identified reactive species emphasizes a mechanism without ligand&#8211;sphere reorganization.

         <title>Noncovalent Interactions Involving Group 6&#8201;in Biological Systems: The Case of Molybdopterin and Tungstopterin Cofactors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Protein Data Bank inspection revealed the existence of noncovalent contacts between tetra&#8208; and pentacoordinated Mo/W complexes and electron donor atoms. This newly attractive force involving elements from group&#8197;6 has been described as a Wolfium bond, being markedly different from classical coordination bonds (antibonding Wf&#8208;Ligand orbital involved). The results derived from the PDB survey have been backed up by an ab initio computational study at the RI&#8208;MP2/def2&#8208;TZVP level of theory.







Abstract
In this study we propose to coin the term Wolfium bond (WfB) to refer to a net attractive force (noncovalent interaction) between any element of group&#8197;6 and electron donor atoms (neutral molecules or anions) and to differentiate it from a coordination bond (metal&#8208;ligand interaction). We provide evidence of the existence of this interaction by inspecting the X&#8208;ray crystal structure of proteins containing Molybdopterin and Tungstopterin cofactors from the Protein Data Bank (PDB). The plausible biological role of the interaction as well as its physical nature (antibonding Wf&#8208;Ligand orbital involved) are also analyzed by means of ab initio calculations (RI&#8208;MP2/def2&#8208;TZVP level of theory), Atoms in Molecules (AIM), Natural Bond Orbital (NBO) and Noncovalent Interactions plot (NCIplot) analyses.

         <title>Bistriazoles Connected Through a B&#8722;B Bridge, Synthesized by Highly Selective Dipolar Cycloaddition Reactions of a Diazido&#8208;diborane(4)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An exceptionally thermally stable diazido diborane was applied in dipolar cycloaddition reactions with terminal alkynes. The products are the first bistriazoles connected by a B&#8722;B bond. The reactions are highly regioselective, leading exclusively to the 1,4&#8208;triazoles, and tolerate the presence of Lewis&#8208;basic groups and additional alkynyl groups at the alkyne.







Abstract
In this work we report the first cycloaddition reactions between a diazido diborane(4) and terminal alkynes, providing unique access to bis&#8208;1,2,3&#8208;triazoles connected by a B&#8722;B bridge. The catalyst&#8208;free reactions are highly selective, yielding exclusively the thermodynamically disfavored bis&#8208;1,4&#8208;triazoles. The reactions are enabled by the high thermal stability of the diazido&#8208;diborane [B(hpp)(N3)]2 (hpp=1,3,4,6,7,8&#8208;hexahydro&#8208;2H&#8208;pyrimido[1,2&#8208;&#945;]pyrimidinate). Due to the tetra&#8208;coordinate boron atoms in this reagent, the reactions are tolerant with respect to the introduction of Lewis&#8208;basic groups at the alkyne. The scope and limitations of the new reactions are discussed.

         <title>Modulation of the Naked&#8208;Eye and Fluorescence Color of a Protonated Boron&#8208;Doped Thiazolothiazole by Anion&#8208;Dependent Hydrogen Bonding</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The visible and fluorescence colors of a doubly protonated boron&#8208;doped thiazolothiazole can be modulated by tuning its hydrogen&#8208;bonding interactions with its counteranions or donor solvent molecules (Cl&#8722;, O3SCF3&#8722;, B(3,5&#8208;(CF3)2C6H3)4&#8722;, OEt2). DFT calculations show that these affect the relative energies of the &#960; orbitals involved in the S0&#8594;S1 transition, thus enabling fine&#8208;tuning of their absorption and emission spectral features.







Abstract
The reaction of a cyclic alkyl(amino)carbene (CAAC)&#8208;stabilized thiazaborolo[5,4&#8208;d]thiazaborole (TzbTzb) with strong Br&#248;nsted acids, such as HCl, HOTf (Tf=O2SCF3) and [H(OEt2)2][BArF4] (ArF=3,5&#8208;(CF3)2C6H3), results in the protonation of both TzbTzb nitrogen atoms. In each case X&#8208;ray crystallographic data show coordination of the counteranions (Cl&#8722;, OTf&#8722;, BArF4&#8722;) or solvent molecules (OEt2) to the doubly protonated fused heterocycle via hydrogen&#8208;bonding interactions, the strength of which strongly influences the 1H&#8197;NMR shift of the NH protons, enabling tuning of both the visible (yellow to red) and fluorescence (green to red) colors of these salts. DFT calculations reveal that the hydrogen bonding of the counteranion or solvent to the protonated nitrogen centers affects the intramolecular TzbTzb&#8208;to&#8208;CAAC charge transfer character involved in the S0&#8594;S1 transition, ultimately enabling fine&#8208;tuning of their absorption and emission spectral features.

         <title>Key Role of a&#8208;Top CO on Terrace Sites of Metallic Pd Clusters for CO Oxidation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
O2 titration using in&#8197;situ DRIFTS was performed on metallic Pd cluster supported on Al2O3 saturated with CO. The most weakly adsorbed a&#8208;top CO adsorbed on terrace site preferentially reacted with oxygen than other CO species. It clearly demonstrated that the CO oxidation is initiated with a&#8208;top CO on terrace sites.







Abstract
Pd&#8208;based catalysts are the most widely used for CO oxidation because of their outstanding catalytic activity and thermal stability. However, fundamental understanding of the detailed catalytic processes occurring on Pd&#8208;based catalysts under realistic conditions is still lacking. In this study, we investigated CO oxidation on metallic Pd clusters supported on Al2O3 and SiO2. High&#8208;angle annular dark&#8208;field scanning transmission electron microscopy revealed the formation of similar&#8208;sized Pd clusters on Al2O3 and SiO2. In contrast, CO chemisorption analysis indicated a gradual change in the dispersion of Pd (from 0.79 to 0.2) on Pd/Al2O3 and a marginal change in the dispersion (from 0.4 to 0.24) on Pd/SiO2 as the Pd loading increased from 0.27 to 5.5&#8197;wt&#8201;%; these changes were attributed to differences in the metal&#8208;support interactions. Diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier&#8208;transform spectroscopy revealed that fewer a&#8208;top CO species were present in Pd supported on Al2O3 than those in Pd supported on SiO2, which is related to the morphological differences in the metallic Pd clusters on these two supports. Despite the different dispersion profiles and surface characteristics of Pd, O2 titration demonstrated that linearly bound CO (with an infrared signal at 2090&#8197;cm&#8722;1) reacted first with oxygen in the case of CO&#8208;saturated Pd on Al2O3 and SiO2, which suggests that a&#8208;top CO on the terrace site plays an important role in CO oxidation. The experimental observations were corroborated by periodic density functional calculations, which confirmed that CO oxidation on the (111) terrace sites is most plausible, both kinetically and thermodynamically, compared to that on the edge or corner sites. This study will deepen the fundamental understanding of the effect of Pd clusters on CO oxidation under reaction conditions.

         <title>Dissecting Noncovalent Interactions in Carboxyl&#8208;Functionalized Ionic Liquids Exhibiting Double and Single Hydrogens Bonds Between Ions of Like Charge</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Like&#8208;likes&#8208;like charge attraction is observed for a carboxyl&#8208;functionalized ionic liquid that exhibits three kind of hydrogen bond: the expected single hydrogen bonds between cation and anion, and, surprisingly, single and double hydrogen bonds between the cations, despite the repulsive Coulomb forces between the ions of like charge. Combining X&#8208;ray crystallography, differential scanning calorimetry, IR spectroscopy, thermodynamic methods and DFT calculations allowed all kind of hydrogen bonds present in the solid, liquid and gaseous states to be addressed.







Abstract
We show that the carboxyl&#8208;functionalized ionic liquid 1&#8208;(carboxymethyl)pyridinium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide [HOOC&#8208;CH2&#8208;py][NTf2] exhibits three types of hydrogen bonding: the expected single hydrogen bonds between cation and anion, and, surprisingly, single and double hydrogen bonds between the cations, despite the repulsive Coulomb forces between the ions of like charge. Combining X&#8208;ray crystallography, differential scanning calorimetry, IR spectroscopy, thermodynamic methods and DFT calculations allows the analysis and characterization of all types of hydrogen bonding present in the solid, liquid and gaseous states of the ionic liquid (IL). We find doubly hydrogen bonded cationic dimers (c+=c+) in the crystalline phase. With increasing temperature, this binding motif opens in the liquid and is replaced by (c+&#8722;c+&#8722;a&#8722; species, with a remaining single cationic hydrogen bond and an additional hydrogen bond between cation and anion. We provide clear evidence that the IL evaporates as hydrogen&#8208;bonded ion pairs (c+&#8722;a&#8722;) into the gas phase. The measured transition enthalpies allow the noncovalent interactions to be dissected and the hydrogen bond strength between ions of like charge to be determined.

         <title>Phosphine&#8208;Functionalized Syndiotactic Polystyrenes: Synthesis and Application to Immobilization of Transition Metal Nanoparticle Catalysts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The precise control of monomer sequence and stereochemistry in copolymerization is of much interest and importance for the synthesis of high performance materials, but studies toward this goal have met with only limited success to date. The syndiospecific polymerization of diphenylphosphinostyrene (  p  &#8208;StPPh  2  and  o  &#8208;StPPh  2  ) and its copolymerization with styrene (St) by (C  5  Me  4  SiMe  3  )Sc(CH  2  C  6  H  4  NMe  2  &#8208;  o  )  2  have been achieved for the first time to afford a new series of phosphine functionalized syndiotactic polystyrene. By the design of the polymer structure, the copolymer of  o  &#8208;StPPh  2  and St (poly(  o  &#8208;StPPh  2  &#8208;  alt  &#8208;St)&#8208;  b  &#8208;  s  PS) containing  o  &#8208;StPPh  2  and St alternating copolymer block and syndiotactic polystyrene block (  s  PS) showed excellent thermal stability and chemical resistance. The simple combination of the triphenylphosphine and the syndiotactic polystyrene structures realized the stable immobilization of metal nanoparticles to afford highly robust metal@poly(  o  &#8208;StPPh  2  &#8208;  alt  &#8208;St)&#8208;  b  &#8208;  s  PS nanocatalysts at high temperature and various atmospheres.

         <title>Hydrogen peroxide&#8211;responsive triggers based on borinic acids: molecular insights into the control of oxidative rearrangement.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Arylborinic acids represent new, efficient, and underexplored hydrogen peroxide&#8208;responsive triggers. In contrast to boronic acids, two concomitant oxidative rearrangements are involved in the complete oxidation of these species, which might represent a major limitation for an efficient effector (drug or fluorophore) release. Herein, we describe a comprehensive study of H  2  O  2  &#8208;mediated unsymmetrical arylborinic acid oxidation to investigate the factors that could selectively guide their oxidative rearrangement. The  o  &#8208;CF  3  substituent was found to be an excellent directing group since complete regioselectivity was obtained on borinic acid models. This result was successfully applied to synthesizing new borinic acid&#8208;based fluorogenic probes, which exclusively release the fluorescent moiety upon H  2  O  2  treatment. These compounds maintained their superior kinetic properties compared to boronic acids, thus further enhancing the potential of arylborinic acids as valuable new H  2  O  2  &#8208;sensitive triggers.</dc:description>

Dissociation of the labile TMEDA ligand in the resulting complex [{BDI}Ga(H)&#8213;(H)Zn(tmeda)] (1) facilitates insertion of a second equiv. of I into the remaining Zn&#8213;H to form a thermally sensitive trinuclear species [({BDI}Ga(H))2Zn] (2). Compound 1 exchanges with polymeric zinc dideuteride [ZnD2]n in the presence of TMEDA, and with compounds I and 2via sequential and reversible ligand dissociation and gallium(I) insertion.

         <title>Bola&#8208;Amphiphilic Glycodendrimers: New Carbohydrate&#160;Mimicking&#160;Scaffolds to Target Carbohydrate&#8208;Binding Proteins</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dendrimers are appealing scaffolds for creating carbohydrate mimics with unique multivalent cooperativity. We report here novel bola&#8208;amphiphilic glycodendrimers bearing mannose and glucose terminals, and a hydrophobic thioacetal core responsive to reactive oxygen species. The peculiar bola&#8208;amphiphilic feature enabled stronger binding to lectin compared to the conventional amphiphile. In addition, these dendrimers are able to target mannose receptors and glucose transporters expressed at the surface of cells, allowing effective and specific cellular uptake.&#160; All these highlight&#160;their great promise for targeted delivery.</dc:description>

         <title>Cost&#8208;Effective 2D Ultrathin Metal&#8211;Organic Layers with Bis&#8208;Metallic Catalytic Sites for Visible Light&#8208;Driven Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>As novel generated 2D materials, metal&#8208;organic layers (MOLs) have recently emerged as a potential platform for photocatalysis CO2 reduction reaction (PCO2RR). Such 2D structures negate the blemish of low&#8208;density catalytic sites and low electron transmission efficiency on the surface of MOFs, while retaining the advantage of low expenditure when using earth&#8208;abundant metal nodes and meritorious applicability in the PCO2RR. Herein, we report that the 2D ultrathin layer material with bis&#8208;metallic catalytic sites (Ni&#8208;O metal node and the Ni&#8208;N metal site) from bidentate ligand 2,2&#8217;&#8208;bipyridine&#8208;5,5&#8217;&#8208;dicarboxylate (H2bpydc) and nickel (II) remarkably boosts the visible light&#8208;driven PCO2RR performance with a CO yield of 2400 mmol/g for 18 h and a selectivity up to 99%. Consequently, the effects of morphology, catalytic sites and intrinsic properties on PCO2RR efficiency have been investigated in detail. In this context, the ultrathin layer structrue has been elucidated as the key point to facilitate electron transfer efficiency. Notably, the bis&#8208;metallic catalytic sites with reasonable distance between two adjacent metals presumably induce synergistic effect, offering a guiding ideology for further designing high performance photocatalysts.</dc:description>
