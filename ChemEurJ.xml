         <title>Smartphone&#8208;Based Sensing of Cortisol by Functionalized Rhodamine Probes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>During a stress condition, the human body synthesizes catecholamine neurotransmitters and specific hormones (called &#8220;stress hormones&#8221;), the most important of which is cortisol. The monitoring of cortisol levels should be extremely important to control the stress levels, and for this reason, it shows important medical applications. The common analytical methods (HPLC, GC&#8208;MS) cannot be used in real life, due to the bulky size of the instruments and the necessity of specialized personnel. Molecular probes solve these problems due to their fast and easy use. The synthesis of new fluorescent rhodamine probes, able to interact by non&#8208;covalent interactions with cortisol, the recognition properties in solution as well as in solid state by Strip Test, using a smartphone as detector, are here reported. DFT calculations and FT&#8208;IR measurements suggest the formation of supramolecular complexes through hydrogen bonds as main non&#8208;covalent interaction. The present study represents one of the first sensor, based on synthetical chemical receptors, able to detect cortisol in a linear range from 1 mM to 1 pM, based on non&#8208;covalent molecular recognition and paves the way to the realization of practical point&#8208;of&#8208;care device for the monitoring of cortisol in real live.</dc:description>

         <title>Recent Advancements in Continuous&#8208;Flow Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura Coupling Utilizing Immobilized Molecular Palladium Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The present &#8216;Concept&#8217; provides a comprehensive review of recent strides in continuous&#8208;flow Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura coupling, employing a packed&#8208;bed reactor featuring immobilized palladium complexes. Emphasis is placed on meticulously designed catalyst structures and the innovative reaction technologies employed under continuous&#8208;flow conditions, accentuating their pivotal roles in the establishment of a pragmatic synthesis process.







Abstract
Immobilized Pd&#8208;catalyzed Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura coupling under continuous&#8208;flow conditions using a packed&#8208;bed reactor, representing an efficient, automated, practical, and safe technology compared to conventional batch&#8208;type reactions. The core objective of this study is the development of an active and durable catalyst. In contrast to supported Pd nanoparticles, the attachment of Pd complexes onto solid supports through well&#8208;defined coordination sites is considered a favorable approach for preparing highly dispersed and stabilized Pd species. These species can be directly employed in various flow reactions without the need for pre&#8208;treatment. This concept paper explores recent achievements involving the application of immobilized Pd complexes as precatalysts for continuous&#8208;flow Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura coupling. Our focus is to elucidate the significance of the designed catalyst structures in relation to their catalytic performance under flow conditions. Additionally, we highlight various reaction systems and catalyst packing methods, emphasizing their crucial roles in establishing a practical synthesis process.

         <title>Morphological Transformations of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Nucleocapsid Protein Biocondensates Mediated by Antimicrobial Peptides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 nucleocapsid protein (N&#8722;P) undergoes liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation in the presence of RNA, resulting in biocondensate formation. Antimicrobial peptides are found to interfere with N&#8722;P/RNA condensates, leading to clustering or even to the formation of fibrillar structures. Such morphological transformations are expected to impair the normal functionality of the N&#8722;P droplets and thus virion assembly.







Abstract
Recently, the discovery of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) as excellent candidates for overcoming antibiotic resistance has attracted significant attention. AMPs are short peptides active against bacteria, cancer cells, and viruses. It has been shown that the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 nucleocapsid protein (N&#8722;P) undergoes liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation in the presence of RNA, resulting in biocondensate formation. These biocondensates are crucial for viral replication as they concentrate the viral RNA with the host cell&#8216;s protein machinery required for viral protein expression. Thus, N&#8722;P biocondensates are promising targets to block or slow down viral RNA transcription and consequently virion assembly. We investigated the ability of three AMPs to interfere with N&#8722;P/RNA condensates. Using microscopy techniques, supported by biophysical characterization, we found that the AMP LL&#8211;III partitions into the condensate, leading to clustering. Instead, the AMP CrACP1 partitions into the droplets without affecting their morphology but reducing their dynamics. Conversely, GKY20 leads to the formation of fibrillar structures after partitioning. It can be expected that such morphological transformation severely impairs the normal functionality of the N&#8722;P droplets and thus virion assembly. These results could pave the way for the development of a new class of AMP&#8208;based antiviral agents targeting biocondensates.

         <title>Injectable Chitosan Hydrogels Doped with 2D Peptide Nanosheet&#8208;Drug Conjugates for Glutathione&#8208;Responsive Sustained Drug Delivery</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A molecule&#8208;responsive drug release system based on 2D peptide nanosheets (PNSs) has been developed by using chitosan (CS) hydrogel as a sustained&#8208;release platform. The PNS&#8208;CS&#8208;based drug delivery system demonstrates outstanding pH&#8208;responsiveness and sustained drug release capabilities, and the improved cellular uptake shown offers potential for biomedical applications.







Abstract
The development of novel and effective drug delivery systems aimed at enhancing therapeutic profile and efficacy of therapeutic agents is a critical challenge in modern medicine. This study presents an intelligent drug delivery system based on self&#8208;assembled two&#8208;dimensional peptide nanosheets (2D PNSs). Leveraging the tunable properties of amino acid structures and sequences, we design a peptide with the sequence of Fmoc&#8208;FKKGSHC, which self&#8208;assembles into 2D PNSs with uniform structure, high biocompatibility, and excellent degradability. Covalent attachment of thiol&#8208;modified doxorubicin (DOX) drugs to 2D PNSs via disulfide bond results in the peptide&#8208;drug conjugates (PDCs), which is denoted as PNS&#8208;SS&#8208;DOX. Subsequently, the PDCs are encapsulated within the injectable, thermosensitive chitosan (CS) hydrogels for drug delivery. The designed drug delivery system demonstrates outstanding pH&#8208;responsiveness and sustained drug release capabilities, which are facilitated by the characteristics of the CS hydrogels. Meanwhile, the covalently linked disulfide bond within the PNS&#8208;SS&#8208;DOX is responsive to intracellular glutathione (GSH) within tumor cells, enabling controlled drug release and significantly inhibiting the cancer cell growth. This responsive peptide&#8208;drug conjugate based on a 2D peptide nanoplatform paves the way for the development of smart drug delivery systems and has bright prospects in the future biomedicine field.

         <title>Unravelling the Role of Free Radicals in Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photogenerated radicals have good redox properties, thus promoting the widespread application of photocatalysis for environmental treatment and organic synthesis. The generation and application of photogenerated radicals are related to carriers and reactive molecules, such as a variety of alkane radicals in photocatalytic dissolution. In this conceptual article, we discuss some basic properties of photogenerated radicals and recent related research work.







Abstract
Free radicals are increasingly recognized as active intermediate reactive species that can participate in various redox processes, significantly influencing the mechanistic pathways of reactions. Numerous researchers have investigated the generation of one or more distinct photogenerated radicals, proposing various hypotheses to explain the reaction mechanisms. Notably, recent research has demonstrated the emergence of photogenerated radicals in innovative processes, including organic chemical reactions and the photocatalytic dissolution of precious metals. To harness the potential of these free radicals more effectively, it is imperative to consolidate and analyze the processes and action modes of these photogenerated radicals. This conceptual paper delves into the latest advancements in understanding the mechanics of photogenerated radicals.

         <title>Modular Divergent Synthesis of Indole Alkaloid Derivatives by an Atypical Ugi Multicomponent Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A complex pentacyclic ketimine undergoes a fully diastereoselective Ugi&#8208;type multicomponent reaction with various isocyanides and carboxylic acids to give a range of non&#8208;natural indole alkaloid derivatives. DFT calculations show that the reaction proceeds via a hydrogen bonding mechanism and that the stereoselectivity is primarily governed by ring strain considerations.







Abstract
We present an Ugi multicomponent approach to explore the chemical space around Aspidosperma&#8208;type monoterpene indole alkaloids. By variation of the isocyanide and carboxylic acid inputs we demonstrate the rapid generation of molecular diversity and the possibility to introduce handles for further modification. The key Ugi three&#8208;component reaction showed full diastereoselectivity towards the cis&#8208;fused ring system, which can be rationalized by DFT calculations that moreover indicate that the reaction proceeds via a Passerini&#8208;type hydrogen bonding mechanism. Several post&#8208;Ugi modifications were also performed, including Pictet&#8208;Spengler cyclization to highly complex nonacyclic natural product hybrid scaffolds.

         <title>Enabling High Activation of Glucose&#8208;6&#8208;Phosphate Dehydrogenase Activity Through Liquid Condensate Formation and Compression</title>

Temperature and pressure dependence of the glycolytic G6PDH reaction forming NADPH/PLL droplets as the enzymatic reaction proceeds: Incorporation of the reactants in the droplet phase led to a boost in enzymatic activity, which was most pronounced at medium&#8208;high pressures.







Abstract
Droplet formation via liquid&#8211;liquid phase separation is thought to be involved in the regulation of various biological processes, including enzymatic reactions. We investigated a glycolytic enzymatic reaction, the conversion of glucose&#8208;6&#8208;phosphate to 6&#8208;phospho&#8208;D&#8208;glucono&#8208;1,5&#8208;lactone with concomitant reduction of NADP+ to NADPH both in the absence and presence of dynamically controlled liquid droplet formation. Here, the nucleotide serves as substrate as well as the scaffold required for the formation of liquid droplets. To further expand the process parameter space, temperature and pressure dependent measurements were performed. Incorporation of the reactants in the liquid droplet phase led to a boost in enzymatic activity, which was most pronounced at medium&#8208;high pressures. The crowded environment of the droplet phase induced a marked increase of the affinity of the enzyme and substrate. An increase in turnover number in the droplet phase at high pressure contributed to a further strong increase in catalytic efficiency. Enzyme systems that are dynamically coupled to liquid condensate formation may be the key to deciphering many biochemical reactions. Expanding the process parameter space by adjusting temperature and pressure conditions can be a means to further increase the efficiency of industrial enzyme utilization and help uncover regulatory mechanisms adopted by extremophiles.

         <title>Supramolecular Control of the Temperature Responsiveness of Fluorescent Macrocyclic Molecular Rotamers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The molecular motion of macrocyclic carbazole macrocycles (CarROTs) is controlled through the external addition of anions, cations or through deprotonation allowing four discreet rotational speeds to be accessed, which in turn stop, reduce or enhance the thermoluminescent properties due to increasing or decreasing non&#8208;radiative decay processes, thereby providing a means to externally control the temperature sensitivity of the system.







Abstract
To fully harness the potential of molecular machines, it is crucial to develop methods by which to exert control over their speed of motion through the application of external stimuli. A conformationally strained macrocyclic fluorescent rotamer, CarROT, displays a reproducible and linear fluorescence decrease towards temperature over the physiological temperature range. Through the external addition of anions, cations or through deprotonation, the compound can access four discreet rotational speeds via supramolecular interactions (very slow, slow, fast and very fast) which in turn stop, reduce or enhance the thermoluminescent properties due to increasing or decreasing non&#8208;radiative decay processes, thereby providing a means to externally control the temperature sensitivity of the system. Through comparison with analogues with a higher degree of conformational freedom, the high thermosensitivity of CarROT over the physiological temperature range was determined to be due to conformational strain, which causes a high energy barrier to rotation over this range. Analogues with a higher degree of conformational freedom display lower sensitivities towards temperature over the same temperature range. This study provides an example of an information rich small molecule, in which programable rotational speed states can be observed with facile read&#8208;out.

         <title>Genetically Fusing Order&#8208;Promoting and Thermoresponsive Building Blocks to Design Hybrid Biomaterials</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review discusses strategies for enhancing the structural diversity of intrinsically disordered elastin&#8208;like polypeptides (ELPs) and resilin&#8208;like polypeptides (RLPs) through genetic fusion with ordered helical or beta sheet domains, aiming to generate well&#8208;structured, stimuli&#8208;responsive supramolecular materials on the nanoscale.







Abstract
The unique biophysical and biochemical properties of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) and their recombinant derivatives, intrinsically disordered protein polymers (IDPPs) offer opportunities for producing multistimuli&#8208;responsive materials; their sequence&#8208;encoded disorder and tendency for phase separation facilitate the development of multifunctional materials. This review highlights the strategies for enhancing the structural diversity of elastin&#8208;like polypeptides (ELPs) and resilin&#8208;like polypeptides (RLPs), and their self&#8208;assembled structures via genetic fusion to ordered motifs such as helical or beta sheet domains. In particular, this review describes approaches that harness the synergistic interplay between order&#8208;promoting and thermoresponsive building blocks to design hybrid biomaterials, resulting in well&#8208;structured, stimuli&#8208;responsive supramolecular materials ordered on the nanoscale.

         <title>Synthesis and Structural Revision of a Natural Tetrasaccharide from Starfish Asterias rollestoni Bell</title>

The synthesis and structural revision of the natural 2&#8208;O&#8208;glycosylated tetrasaccharides via dual DPPA&#8208;directed [2+2] glycosylation.







Abstract
Starfish provide important saponins with diverse bioactivities as the secondary metabolites, among which 2&#8208;O&#8208;glycosylated glycosides are commonly found. Preparation of those 1,2&#8208;trans 2&#8208;O&#8208;glycosylated glycosides usually relies on 2&#8208;O&#8208;acyl participation requiring the selective installation and cleavage of 2&#8208;O&#8208;acyl groups. A convergent synthesis using 2&#8208;O&#8208;glycosylated oligosaccharide donors would be more straightforward but also pose greater challenges. Herein, we report a convergent synthesis of a distinctive tetrasaccharide isolated from starfish Asterias rollestoni Bell. Dual 2&#8208;(diphenylphosphinoyl)acetyl (DPPA) groups at O3 and O4 on galactose moiety led to high &#946;&#8208;selectivities (&#946;/&#945;=12/1 or &#946; only) in the challenging [2+2] glycosylation, giving the desired tetrasaccharides in &gt;90&#8201;% yields from the 2&#8208;O&#8208;glycosylated disaccharide donors. These synthetic studies have also unambiguously revised the structure of these natural tetrasaccharides. This work would facilitate further studies on new inhibitors of &#945;&#8208;glucosidase as hypoglycemic drugs.

         <title>A Healable Quasi&#8208;Solid Polymer Electrolyte with Balanced Toughness and Ionic Conductivity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A gel polymer electrolyte, rooted in poly(urethane&#8208;urea) chemistry, has been synthesized by a post immersion method, which allows for precise manipulation of its mechanical and electrical properties. This polymer electrolyte demonstrates exceptional dendritic resistance and outstanding self&#8208;healing features, with significant potential for application in lithium&#8208;ion batteries.







Abstract
Solid polymer electrolytes (SPEs) have garnered extensive attention as potential alternatives to traditional liquid electrolytes, primarily due to their prowess in curbing lithium dendrite formation and preventing electrolyte leaks. The quest for SPEs that are both mechanically robust and exhibit superior ionic conductivity has been vigorous. However, achieving a harmonious balance between these two attributes remains a significant challenge. In this study, we introduce a novel quasi&#8208;solid electrolyte, ingeniously crafted from a poly(urethane&#8208;urea) network, enriched with lithium salts and plasticizers. This innovative composition not only boasts remarkable toughness but also ensures commendable ionic conductivity. Our post&#8208;gelation method yields gel polymer electrolytes that undergo rigorous evaluation, leading to an optimized version that stands out with its exceptional room&#8208;temperature ionic conductivity (2.94&#215;10&#8722;4&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1) and outstanding toughness (11.9 MJ m&#8722;3). Moreover, it demonstrates a broad electrochemical window (4.73&#8197;V), remarkable stability across a 600&#8208;hour cycle test, a high capacity retention exceeding 80&#8201;% after 100&#8197;cycles at 0.2&#8197;C, and a noteworthy self&#8208;healing capability. This quasi&#8208;solid polymer electrolyte emerges as a promising contender to replace current liquid electrolyte solutions.

         <title>Synthesis of Superbulky Amide Ligands by Addition of Polar Reagents to Sila&#8211;Imine</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Superbulky amide ligands are generally not accessible by deprotonation of their parent amines. Addition of polar reagents to a sila&#8208;imine precursor gave a range of metal complexes with superbulky amide ligands that generally act as weakly coordinating anions.







Abstract
The chemistry of extremely bulky amide ligands is troubled by difficulties in deprotonation of the parent amine. As an alternative route to superbulky amide reagents, the addition of polar reagents to a sila&#8211;imine has been investigated. Attempts to synthesize the superbulky amide anion (tBu3Si)2N&#8722; by addition of tBuLi to tBu2Si=N(SitBu3) failed and gave tBu3Si(tBu2HSi)NLi and isobutene. Reaction of the sila&#8211;imine with KOtBu successfully led to tBu3Si[tBu2(tBuO)Si]NK which crystallized as a separated ion&#8211;pair. Reaction with the slightly bulkier KOAd (Ad=1&#8208;adamantyl) led in presence of THF to ether ring&#8211;opening. Reaction with tBuOH gave tBu3Si[tBu2(tBuO)Si]NH but this amine cannot be easily deprotonated. Reaction with (BDI*)MgnBu in presence of THF gave (BDI*)Mg+&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;(THF)2 and the non&#8211;coordinating anion tBu3Si[tBu2(nBu)Si]N&#8722;; BDI*=&#223;&#8208;diketiminate ligand HC[C(tBu)N&#8722;DIPP]2, DIPP=2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl. Reaction of Mg(nBu)2 with tBu2Si=N(SitBu3) led to a Mg complex with one amide ligand: tBu3Si[tBu2(nBu)Si]N&#8722;. The other superbulky amide anion isomerized by internal deprotonation of a tBu&#8208;substituent to give a primary carbanion that is also coordinated to Mg. Although the amide&#8211;to&#8211;carbanion isomerization is highly contrathermodynamic, it allows for coordination of both anions to a single Mg center. The new bulky amides are rare cases of halogen&#8211;free weakly coordinating anions.

         <title>Photoreduction of Trifluoromethyl Group: Lithium Ion Assisted Fluoride&#8208;Coupled Electron Transfer from EDA Complex</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photoinduced single&#8208;electron reduction is an efficient method for the mono&#8208;selective activation of the C&#8211;F bond on a trifluoromethyl group to construct a difluoroalkyl group. We have developed an electron&#8208;donor&#8208;acceptor (EDA) complex mediated single&#8208;electron transfer (EDA&#8208;SET) of &#945;,&#945;,&#945;&#8208;trifluoromethyl arenes in the presence of lithium salt to give &#945;,&#945;&#8208;difluoroalkylarenes. The C&#8211;F bond reduction was realized by lithium iodide and triethylamine, two common feedstock reagents. Mechanistic studies revealed the generation of a &#945;,&#945;&#8208;difluoromethyl radical by single&#8208;electron reduction and defluorination, followed by the radical addition to alkenes. Lithium salt interacted with the fluorine atom to promote the photoinduced reduction mediated by the EDA complex. Computational studies indicated that the lithium&#8208;assisted defluorination and the single&#8208;electron reduction occurred concertedly. We call this phenomenon fluoride&#8208;coupled electron transfer (FCET). FCET is a novel approach to C&#8211;F bond activation for the synthesis of organofluorine compounds.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Introduction of the trifluoromethyl (CF3) group into organic compounds has garnered substantial interest because of its significant role in pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals. Here, we report a hydroxylamine&#8208;mediated radical process for C(sp2)&#8722;H trifluoromethylation of terminal alkenes. The reaction shows good reactivity, impressive E/Z selectivity (up to &gt; 20:1), and broad functional group compatibility. Expansion of this approach to perfluoroalkylation and late&#8208;stage trifluoromethylation of bioactive molecules demonstrates its promising application potential. Mechanistic studies suggest that the reaction follows a radical addition and subsequent elimination pathway.</dc:description>

         <title>Dehydro[12]&#8208; and [18]annulene&#8208;Fused Ball&#8208;Shaped Ruthenium Complex Oligomers: Synthesis, Aromatic/Antiaromatic Effect, and Symmetry for Near&#8208;Infrared Optical Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A single&#8208;step synthesis of ball&#8208;shaped ruthenium complex oligomers has been realized. The process involves the Eglinton coupling of alkyne&#8208;substituted ruthenium complexes, allowing selective oligomer formation. NMR and magnetic circular dichroism spectroscopy confirm annulene&#8216;s influence on chromophores. The resulting oligomers demonstrate increased absorption coefficients in the near&#8208;infrared (NIR) region, providing an efficient strategy for controlling NIR optical properties.







Abstract
The appropriate arrangement of near&#8208;infrared (NIR) chromophores allows for the modification of the peak wavelength in the NIR region and efficient use of NIR light. However, the preparation of novel NIR chromophores using simple procedures remains a formidable challenge. Herein, we report the synthesis of ball&#8208;shaped ruthenium complex oligomers. The metal complexes can be synthesized in a single step and interact strongly with NIR light. Alkyne&#8208;substituted low&#8208;symmetry ball&#8208;shaped ruthenium complexes were synthesized and subjected to Eglinton coupling to obtain dehydro[12] and [18]annulene&#8208;fused dimers and trimers. Fine&#8208;tuning of the reaction conditions led to the selective synthesis of the target oligomers. NMR spectroscopy confirmed that the 18&#960;&#8208;aromatic and 12&#960;&#8208;antiaromatic properties of the annulene influenced the ruthenium complex chromophore, and magnetic circular dichroism spectroscopy showed changes in the electronic structure of their excited state owing to molecular&#8208;symmetry differences. The absorption coefficient in the NIR region of the absorption spectra of the oligomers increased significantly, supporting the efficient use of light by oligomerization. The formation of oligomers using ball&#8208;shaped metal complexes is a simple and effective strategy for controlling NIR optical properties.

         <title>On the Synthesis and Structure of &#8216;Naked&#8217; Ga(I) and In(I) Salts and the Surprising Stability of Simple Ga(I) and In(I) Salts in the Coordinating Solvents Ether and Acetonitrile</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this work, we present the solid&#8208;state structures of solvent&#8208;free Ga[pf] and In[pf] salts ([pf]&#8211; = [Al(ORF)4]&#8211;; RF = C(CF3)3), which are very rare examples of salts with truly &#8216;naked&#8217; metal cations. Both salts may serve as starting materials for subvalent gallium and indium chemistry with very weakly coordinating ligands providing the freedom of choice for solvents and ligands for the future. On the other hand, we report and rationalize the formation and isolation of [M(OEt2)2][pf] and [M(MeCN)2][pf] (M&#160;= Ga, In), underlining the surprising stability of these subvalent group 13 M+ ions against disproportionation. Unexpectedly, tricoordinate and carbene analogous [Ga(L)2]+ ions with the [pf]&#8211; counterion are stable in L = acetonitrile and diethyl ether at room temperature, opening up possible applications for example in organic synthesis and catalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Improving the Stability and Kinetic Inertness of Mn(II) Complexes by Increasing the Bridge Length in Bicyclic CDTA&#8208;like Ligands</title>

         <dc:description>Kinetic inertness of Mn(II)&#8208;based MRI&#160;contrast agents can be improved by increasing the rigidity of the polydentate ligand that tightly coordinate the metal ion. Taking inspiration from the remarkable increase in kinetic inertness of [Mn(CDTA)]2&#8208;&#160;compared to [Mn(EDTA)]2&#8208;&#160;due to the cyclohexyl backbone rigidity, we devised that bicyclic ligands&#160;would further improve the kinetic inertness of the Mn(II) complexes. The length of the alkyl bridge on the cyclohexane ring was varied from methylene (BCH&#8208;DTA), ethylene (BCO&#8208;DTA) to propylene (BCN&#8208;DTA) to evaluate the influence of the different&#160;trans&#8208;diaminotetraacetate ligands on&#160;relaxometric, thermodynamic and kinetic properties of the Mn(II)&#8208;complexes.&#160;1H and&#160;17O NMR relaxometric&#160;studies showed a slight increase in relaxivity and a faster water exchange rate in these Mn(II)&#8208;complexes with respect to [Mn(CDTA)]2&#8208;. Solution studies revealed that the conditional stability (pMn) and dissociation half&#8208;life (t1/2) at pH 7.4 follow the order [Mn(BCH&#8208;DTA)]2&#8208;&#160;&lt; [Mn(BCO&#8208;DTA)]2&#8208;&#160;&lt; [Mn(BCN&#8208;DTA)]2&#8208; by highlighting the effect of the bridge length on the overall stability of the Mn(II)&#8208;complexes. Remarkably, [Mn(BCN&#8208;DTA)]2&#8208; shows an improved pMn value and a 7&#8208;times higher kinetic inertness than [Mn(CDTA)]2&#8208;.

         <title>Chemoselective Post&#8208;Synthesis Modification of Pyridyl&#8208;Substituted, Aromatic Phosphorus Heterocycles: Cationic Ligands for Coordination Chemistry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Triazaphospholes are potential polydentate ligands due to the presence of both phosphorus and nitrogen donor atoms within the aromatic 5&#8208;membered heterocycle. The incorporation of an additional pyridyl&#8208;substituent opens up the possibility of a post&#8208;synthesis modification via chemoselective and also stepwise alkylation exclusively of the nitrogen atoms. This can be controlled by the choice and by the stoichiometry of the electrophile and allows the targeted synthesis of a variety of novel mono&#8208; and dicationic ligands. Reaction with Cu(I)&#8208;halides causes the formation of cuprates of the type [CuXn](n&#8208;1)&#8208;, which enables coordination of the &#960;&#8208;acidic phosphorus donor to the negatively charged metal core, which is favored over the coordination by a strongly &#963;&#8208;donating nitrogen atom. The use of cationic triazaphosphole derivatives can be used as a strategy to enforce the coordination of the ligand to an electron rich metal solely via the phosphorus atom. However, there is a subtle balance between the formation of either coordination polymers or dimeric structures, as the substitution pattern on the heterocycle and the nature of the halide have a large influence on the coordination motifs formed.</dc:description>

         <title>Composition and Conformation of Hetero&#8208; versus Homo&#8208;Fluorinated Triazolamers Influence their Activity on Islet Amyloid Polypeptide Aggregation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
While fluorinated molecules constitute nearly 30&#8201;% of all newly approved drugs, and peptidomimetic foldamers provide original solutions to resolve certain peptide problems, the interest of fluorinated foldamers is still little addressed. The conformational and biological interest of fluorinated triazolamers as an alternative to natural peptides is demonstrated here.







Abstract
Novel fluorinated foldamers based on aminomethyl&#8208;1,4&#8208;triazolyl&#8208;difluoroacetic acid (1,4&#8208;Tz&#8722;CF2) units were synthesized and their conformational behaviour was studied by NMR and molecular dynamics. Their activity on the aggregation of the human islet amyloid polypeptide (hIAPP) amyloid protein was evaluated by fluorescence spectroscopy and mass spectrometry. The fluorine labelling of these foldamers allowed the analysis of their interaction with the target protein. We demonstrated that the preferred extended conformation of homotriazolamers of 1,4&#8208;Tz&#8722;CF2 unit increases the aggregation of hIAPP, while the hairpin&#8208;like conformation of more flexible heterotriazolamers containing two 1,4&#8208;Tz&#8722;CF2 units mixed with natural amino acids from the hIAPP sequence reduces it, and more efficiently than the parent natural peptide. The longer heterotriazolamers having three 1,4&#8208;Tz&#8722;CF2 units adopting more folded hairpin&#8208;like and ladder&#8208;like structures similar to short multi&#8208;stranded &#946;&#8208;sheets have no effect. This work demonstrates that a good balance between the structuring and flexibility of these foldamers is necessary to allow efficient interaction with the target protein.

         <title>Breaking the Rules: On the Relative Stability of Some Methylencyclopropane and Methylcyclopropene Derivatives.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In or out? Contrarily to the well&#8208;established tendency of 1&#8208;methylcyclopropene compounds to isomerize to the corresponding methylenecyclopropanes, the spiro&#8208;derivative MeCP is refractory towards its conversion into MCP. The reasons of this unexpected behavior were unraveled by high&#8208;level computations, which showed that in the case under exam the endocyclic C&#8722;C double bond isomer is more stable than the exocyclic one by around 2.5&#8211;3.0&#8197;Kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1.







Abstract
The structure of the spirocyclic product obtained by reacting catechol with 1,1&#8208;dichloro&#8208;2&#8208;(chloromethyl)cyclopropane is shown by NMR and X&#8208;ray analysis to be that of a 2&#8208;methylcyclopropene (MeCP), instead of the previously reported 2&#8208;methylenecyclopropane (MCP) one. The study of the equilibration between the two isomeric forms by experimental and computational means (including both Density Functional Theory &#8211; DFT &#8211; and Coupled Cluster with single, double, and perturbative triple excitations &#8211; CCSD(T) &#8211; calculations) revealed that, at variance with most of the alkylidenecyclopropane/alkylcyclopropene systems described to date, for the compounds of the present study the MeCP derivative is more stable by&#8776; 2.5&#8211;3.0&#8197;Kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1 than the MCP one. The extension of the DFT and CCSD(T) study to other spiro&#8208;MCP/MeCP pairs suggests that the origin of the unexpected shift of the equilibrium position can be tracked back to a combination of electronic and ring&#8208;strain effects. These findings lead to re&#8208;think a long&#8208;standing, and substantially undisputed belief in the area of unsaturated cyclopropane derivatives.

         <title>Combined Covalent and Supramolecular Polymerization To Reinforce Perylenebisimide Photosynthetic &#8220;Quantasomes&#8221;</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
&#8220;Could we extend the life time of the photocatalytic systems by designing an ad&#8208;hoc porous polymer that allowed a supramolecular architecture while slowing down the disassembly of the quantasome?&#8221; This and more about the story behind the front cover can be found in the article at 10.1002/chem.202303784).







Abstract
Invited for the cover of this issue are the groups of Marcella Bonchio at the University of Padova and J&#233;r&#244;me Canivet at the CNRS&#8211;University of Lyon. The image depicts the hierarchical self&#8208;organization of bio&#8208;inspired quantasomes, crosslinked within a polystyrene network to enchain their lateral and orthogonal proximity for long&#8208;lasting oxygen evolution using green photons.

         <title>(Diazomethyl)dimethylphosphine Oxide&#8212;A Diazoalkane Reagent for [3+2] Cycloadditions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A &#8220;Ukrainian diazoalkane train&#8221; arrives at Kyiv station where a new representative of the diazoalkane family is waiting to board. Over the last two decades, several diazoalkanes relevant to medicinal chemistry have been studied extensively by Ukrainian chemists. Now, the synthesis and [3+2] cycloaddition reactions of (diazomethyl)dimethylphosphine oxide (Me&#8322;P(O)CHN&#8322;), a novel diazoalkane reagent, are described for the first time. More information can be found in the Research Article by O.&#8197;O. Grygorenko and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202303972). Artwork by Vitalii Boklashchuk.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Click chemistry&#160;has reached its maturity as the weapon of choice for the irreversible ligation of molecular fragments, with over 20 years of research resulting in the development or improvement of highly efficient kinetically controlled conjugation reactions. Nevertheless, traditional click reactions can be disadvantageous not only in terms of efficiency (side products, slow kinetics, air/water tolerance, etc.), but also because they completely avoid the possibility to reversibly produce and control bound/unbound states. Recently,&#160;non&#8208;covalent click chemistry&#160;has appeared as a more efficient alternative, in particular by using host&#8208;guest self&#8208;assembled systems of high thermodynamic stability and kinetic lability. This review discusses the implementation of molecular switches in the development of such non&#8208;covalent ligation processes, resulting in what we have termed&#160;stimuli&#8208;responsive click chemistry, in which the bound/unbound constitutional states of the system can be favored by external stimulation, in particular using host&#8208;guest&#160;complexes. As we exemplify with handpicked selected examples, these supramolecular systems are well suited for the development of human&#8208;controlled molecular conjugation, by coupling thermodynamically regulated processes with appropriate temporally resolved extrinsic control mechanisms, thus mimicking nature and advancing our efforts to develop a more function&#8208;oriented chemical synthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>Linear, Planar, Orbicular, and Macrocyclic Multinuclear Zinc (Meth)acrylate Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Zinc carboxylate complexes are widely utilized as artificial models of metalloenzymes and as secondary building units of PCPs/MOFs. However, the relationship between the structure of the monodentate carboxylato ligand and the molecular arrangement of multinuclear zinc carboxylate complexes is not fully understood because of the coordination flexibility of the Zn ion and carboxylato ligands. Herein, we report the structural analysis of a series of complexes derived from zinc (meth)acrylate which has a linear infinite chain structure. The molecular structure of &#956;4&#8208;oxido&#8208;bridged tetranuclear complexes [Zn4(&#956;4&#8208;O)(OCOR)6] revealed a distorted Zn4O core. Crystallization of zinc acrylate under aqueous conditions afforded a &#956;3&#8208;hydroxido&#8208;containing pentanuclear complex [Zn5(&#956;3&#8208;OH)2(OCOR)8] as the repeating unit of an infinite sheet&#8208;like structure in the solid state. It was also obtained by the hydrolysis of the &#956;4&#8208;oxido&#8208;bridged tetranuclear complex. In sharp contrast, the methacrylate analog retained the methacrylato ligands under aqueous crystallization conditions to form a macrocyclic dodecanuclear complex with methacrylato as the sole ligand.</dc:description>

This concept outlines the &#8220;Covalent&#8208;disassembly&#8220; approach for analyte detection with metal&#8208;complexes in&#8197;vitro, foodstuff and living cells. Design principles for developing new probes for challenging targets as well as for improving current systems are summarized.







Abstract
The detection of analytes with small molecular probes is crucial for the analysis and understanding of chemical, medicinal, environmental and biological situations as well as processes. Classic detection approaches rely on the concept of molecular recognition and bond formation reactions. Bond breakage reactions have been less explored in similar contexts. This concept article introduces metal&#8208;salen and metal&#8208;imine complexes as &#8220;covalent&#8208;disassembly&#8221;&#8208;based (DB)&#8208;probes for detecting polyoxophosphates, thiols, amino acids, HCN and changes in pH. It discusses the roles, importance and combinations of structurally functionalized molecular building blocks in the construction of DB&#8208;probes. Applications of optimized DB&#8208;probes for analyte detection in live cells and foodstuff are also discussed. Furthermore, the mechanism of the disassembly of a Fe(III)&#8208;salen probe upon pyrophosphate binding is presented. Extraordinary selectivity for this analyte was achieved by a multistep disassembly sequence including an unprecedented structural change of the metal complex (i.&#8201;e. &#8220;induced&#8208;fit&#8221; principle). Design principles of probes for sensing applications following the &#8220;covalent&#8208;disassembly&#8221; approach are summarized, which will help improving current systems, but will also facilitate the development of new DB&#8208;probes for challenging analytic targets.

         <title>C&#8722;F Bond Insertion: An Emerging Strategy for Constructing Fluorinated Molecules</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 20, April 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
C&#8722;F Insertion reactions are powerful methods for preparing fluorinated molecules, however their development has been severely hampered by the challenge of activating strong C&#8722;F bonds without sequestering the released fluoride. Recently, several strategies have emerged that allow for C&#8722;F insertion of a range of fluorinated substrates. In this article, the recent breakthroughs are discussed focusing on the key underlying concepts.







Abstract
C&#8722;F Insertion reactions, where an organic fragment formally inserts into a carbon&#8211;fluorine bond in a substrate, are highly attractive, yet largely unexplored, methods to prepare valuable fluorinated molecules. The inherent strength of C&#8722;F bonds and the resulting need for a large thermodynamic driving force to initiate C&#8722;F cleavage often leads to sequestering of the released fluoride in an unreactive by&#8208;product. Recently, however, several groups have succeeded in overcoming this challenge, opening up the study of C&#8722;F insertion as an efficient and highly atom&#8208;economical approach to prepare fluorinated compounds. In this article, the recent breakthroughs are discussed focusing on the key conceptual advances that allowed for both C&#8722;F bond cleavage and subsequent incorporation of the released fluoride into the product.

&lt;p&gt;C&#8722;F Insertion reactions are powerful methods for preparing fluorinated molecules, however their development has been severely hampered by the challenge of activating strong C&#8722;F bonds without sequestering the released fluoride. Recently, several strategies have emerged that allow for C&#8722;F insertion of a range of fluorinated substrates. In this article, the recent breakthroughs are discussed focusing on the key underlying concepts.

NiY@CQDs electrode materials prepared by a hydrothermal method have an excellent electrochemical property with a mass&#8208;specific capacitance of 2,944&#8197;F&#8201;g&#8722;1 at a current density of 1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1. The NiY@CQDs//AC asymmetric supercapacitors can reach an energy density of 138.65&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 at a high power density of 1,500&#8197;W&#8201;kg&#8722;1.







Abstract
Supercapacitor is an important energy storage device widely used in the automobile industry, military production, and communication equipment because of its fast charge&#8208;discharge rate, and high power density. Herein, carbon quantum dots modified and Y3+ doped Ni3(NO3)2(OH)4 (NiY@CQDs) nanospheres are prepared by a solvothermal method and used as an electrode material. The electrochemical properties of NiY@CQDs were measured in a three&#8208;electrode system. An asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) cell was assembled with activated carbon (AC) as the anode and NiY@CQDs as the cathode. The electrochemical properties of the ASC device were measured in a two&#8208;electrode system. Experimental results show the shape of NiY@CQDs is petal&#8208;shaped and the introducing carbon quantum dots and doping Y3+ significantly increases the specific surface area, conductivity, and specific capacitance of Ni3(NO3)2(OH)4. The mass&#8208;specific capacitance of NiY@CQDs reaches up to 2944&#8197;F&#8201;g&#8722;1 at a current density of 1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1. The asymmetric supercapacitor of NiY@CQDs//AC has a high energy density of 138.65&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 at a power density of 1500&#8197;W&#8201;kg&#8722;1, displaying a wide range of application prospects in the energy storage area.

         <title>Development of Receptor for Advanced Glycation End Products (RAGE) ligands through target directed dynamic combinatorial chemistry: a novel class of possible antagonists</title>

Tackling the Receptor for Advanced Glycation End Products (RAGE) inhibition via Dynamic Combinatorial Chemistry (DCC). Leveraging protein recognition, in the presence of a continually self&#8208;correcting, evolving dynamic library, we were able to find novel ligands for RAGE. Our biological tests confirmed their superior affinities, as well as potential as antagonists, a fresh perspective for inhibiting this multifaceted and inflammation&#8208;associated receptor.







Abstract
RAGE is a transmembrane receptor of immunoglobulin family that can bind various endogenous and exogenous ligands, initiating the inflammatory downstream signaling pathways, including inflammaging. Therefore, RAGE represents an attractive drug target for age&#8208;related diseases. For the development of small&#8208;molecule RAGE antagonists, we employed protein&#8208;templated dynamic combinatorial chemistry (ptDCC) using RAGE&#8242;s VC1 domain as a template, the first application of this approach in the context of RAGE. The affinities of DCC hits were validated using microscale thermophoresis. Subsequent screening against AGE2 (glyceraldehyde&#8208;modified AGE)&#8208;sRAGE (solubleRAGE) (AGE2&#8208;BSA/sRAGE) interaction using ELISA tests led to the identification of antagonists with micromolar potency. Our findings not only demonstrate the successful application of ptDCC on RAGE but also highlight its potential to address the pressing need for alternative strategies for the development of small&#8208;molecule RAGE antagonists, an area of research that has experienced a slowdown in recent years.

         <title>Aromaticity in the Electronic Ground and Lowest Triplet States of Molecules with Fused Thiophene Rings</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 20, April 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Off&#8208;nucleus isotropic shielding isosurfaces computed with DFT show that while the sulflower with eight thiophene rings follows Baird's rule by switching from aromatic in its electronic ground state to antiaromatic in its lowest triplet state, the sulfower with six thiophene rings disobeys the rule by becoming even more aromatic in its lowest triplet state.







Abstract
Analysis of the variations of the off&#8208;nucleus isotropic magnetic shielding, &#963;iso(r), around thiophene, thienothiophenes, dithienothiophenes and sulflowers in their electronic ground (S0) and lowest triplet (T1) states reveals that some of the features of aromaticity and bonding in these molecules do not fit in with predictions based on the popular H&#252;ckel's and Baird's rules. Despite having 4n &#960; electrons, the S0 states of the sulflowers are shown to be aromatic, due to the local aromaticities of the individual thiophene rings. To reduce its T1 antiaromaticity, the geometry of thiophene changes considerably between S0 and T1: In addition to losing planarity, the carbon&#8208;carbon two &#8216;double&#8217; and one &#8216;single&#8217; bonds in S0 turn into two &#8216;single&#8217; and one &#8216;double&#8217; bonds in T1. Well&#8208;defined Baird&#8208;style aromaticity reversals are observed between the S0 and T1 states of only three of the twelve thiophene&#8208;based compounds investigated in this work, in contrast, the sulflower with six thiophene rings which is weakly aromatic in S0 becomes more aromatic in T1. The results suggest that the change in aromaticity between the S0 and T1 states in longer chains of fused rings is likely to affect mostly the central ring (or the pair of central rings); rings sufficiently far away from the central ring(s) can retain aromatic character.

         <title>Continuous isomerisation of 2,5&#8208;dimethylfuran to 2,4&#8208;dimethylfuran over Ga&#8208;silicate</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 20, April 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
MFI framework zeolites and zeotypes enable the isomerisation of 2,5&#8208;dimethylfuran to 2,4&#8208;dimethylfuran through a heterogeneously catalysed route. Incorporating gallium instead of aluminium increases the selectivity and durability of the catalyst. This reaction is promoted by suitable acidity of the catalyst and steric confinement in the micropores.







Abstract
2,4&#8208;dimethylfuran has a rare disubstitution pattern in the five&#8208;membered heterocyclic furan ring that is highly interesting chemically but challenging to access synthetically. We present a heterogeneously catalysed route to synthesise 2,4&#8208;dimethylfuran from commonly available 2,5&#8208;dimethylfuran using a zeolite packed&#8208;bed flow reactor. As supported by DFT calculations, the reaction occurs inside the zeolite channels, where the acid sites catalyse proton transfer followed by migration of a methyl group. The zeotype Ga&#8208;silicate (MFI type) appears superior to an aluminium&#8208;containing ZSM&#8208;5 by demonstrating higher selectivities and slower catalyst deactivation.

     alt="Continuous isomerisation of 2,5-dimethylfuran to 2,4-dimethylfuran over Ga-silicate"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MFI framework zeolites and zeotypes enable the isomerisation of 2,5-dimethylfuran to 2,4-dimethylfuran through a heterogeneously catalysed route. Incorporating gallium instead of aluminium increases the selectivity and durability of the catalyst. This reaction is promoted by suitable acidity of the catalyst and steric confinement in the micropores.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2,4-dimethylfuran has a rare disubstitution pattern in the five-membered heterocyclic furan ring that is highly interesting chemically but challenging to access synthetically. We present a heterogeneously catalysed route to synthesise 2,4-dimethylfuran from commonly available 2,5-dimethylfuran using a zeolite packed-bed flow reactor. As supported by DFT calculations, the reaction occurs inside the zeolite channels, where the acid sites catalyse proton transfer followed by migration of a methyl group. The zeotype Ga-silicate (MFI type) appears superior to an aluminium-containing ZSM-5 by demonstrating higher selectivities and slower catalyst deactivation. This work provides new opportunities for the continuous valorisation of bio-feedstock molecules in the perspective of the emerging biorefinery era.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Generalist versus Specialist Self&#8208;Replicators</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 20, April 5, 2024. </description>

Whether assembly&#8208;driven self&#8208;replicators that emerge from a mixture of two building blocks specialize on one resource or are generalists was found to depend on their supramolecular organization.







Abstract
Darwinian evolution, including the selection of the fittest species under given environmental conditions, is a major milestone in the development of synthetic living systems. In this regard, generalist or specialist behavior (the ability to replicate in a broader or narrower, more specific food environment) are of importance. Here we demonstrate generalist and specialist behavior in dynamic combinatorial libraries composed of a peptide&#8208;based and an oligo(ethylene glycol) based building block. Three different sets of macrocyclic replicators could be distinguished based on their supramolecular organization: two prepared from a single building block as well as one prepared from an equimolar mixture of them. Peptide&#8208;containing hexamer replicators were found to be generalists, i.&#8201;e. they could replicate in a broad range of food niches, whereas the octamer peptide&#8208;based replicator and hexameric ethyleneoxide&#8208;based replicator were proven to be specialists, i.&#8201;e. they only replicate in very specific food niches that correspond to their composition. However, sequence specificity cannot be demonstrated for either of the generalist replicators. The generalist versus specialist nature of these replicators was linked to their supramolecular organization. Assembly modes that accommodate structurally different building blocks lead to generalist replicators, while assembly modes that are more restrictive yield specialist replicators.

         <title>A Simple Manganese(I) Catalyst for the Efficient and Selective Hydrophosphination of Olefins with PH3, Primary, and Secondary Phosphanes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 20, April 5, 2024. </description>

A Mn(I) amido complex with a tridentate P,N,N ligand, which is easily synthesized from commercially available chemicals, is a remarkable efficient (pre)catalyst for the hydrophosphination of alkenes using secondary and primary aryl and alkyl phosphines and even PH3 as reagents.







Abstract
A tridentate ligand L with a P,NH,N donor motif was synthesized in few steps from commercially available precursors. Upon reaction with [MnBr(CO)5], an octahedral 18&#8208;electron complex [Mn(CO)3(L)]Br (1) is obtained in which L adopts a facial arrangement. After deprotonation of the NH group in the cationic complex unit, a neutral Mn(I) amido complex [Mn(CO)2(L&#8208;H)] (2) is formed under loss of CO. Rearrangement of L&#8208;H leads to a trigonal bipyramidal structure in which the P and N donor centers are in trans position. Further deprotonation of 2 results in a dep&#8208;blue anionic complex fragment [Mn(CO)2(L&#8208;2H)]&#8722; (3). DFT calculations and a QTAIM analysis show that the amido complex&#8197;2 contains a Mn&#8208;N bond with partial double bond character and 3 an aromatic MnN2C2 ring. The anion [Mn(CO)2(L&#8208;2H)]&#8722; reacts with Ph2PH to give a phosphido complex, which serves as phosphide transfer reagent to activated olefins. But the catalytic activity is low. However, the neutral amido complex&#8197;2 is an excellent catalyst and with loadings as low as 0.04&#8197;mol&#8201;%, turn over frequencies of &gt;40&#8217;000&#8197;h&#8722;1 can be achieved. Furthermore, secondary and primary alkyl phosphines as well as PH3 can be added in a catalytic hydrophosphination reaction to a wide range of activated olefins such as &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated aldehydes, ketones, esters, and nitriles. But also, vinyl pyridine and some styrene derivatives are converted into the corresponding phosphanes.

         <title>Strong Circularly Polarized Luminescence Promoted by AIE&#8208;active Chiral Co&#8208;assemblies in Liquid Crystal Polymer Films</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 20, April 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A kind of chiral co&#8208;assembled liquid crystal polymer (PTZ doped in S&#8208;PB2) exhibits reversed and amplified yellow CPL emission (|glum|=0.13) after thermal annealing treatment. This is due to the variation of chiral co&#8208;assemblies from spherical aggregates to helical nanofibers. Noticeably, the largest glum value could reach up to +0.91/&#8208;0.82 by increasing the film thickness.







Abstract
Recently, extensive works have focused on increasing the dissymmetry factors (glum) of various circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) materials, which is one of the most important factors for future applications of CPL. Herein, we designed a chiral co&#8208;assembled liquid crystal polymer (LCP) PTZ@R/S&#8208;PB2, which was prepared by chiral binary co&#8208;polymer (R/S&#8208;PB2) doped with achiral phenothiazine derivation dye (PTZ). For comparison, ternary co&#8208;polymerized LCP (R/S&#8208;PT) was synthesized by co&#8208;polymerizing with mesogenic monomer, chiral monomer and emissive monomer. Both PTZ@R/S&#8208;PB2 and R/S&#8208;PT showed aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) properties. Interestingly, the CPL signals of both PTZ@R/S&#8208;PB2 and R/S&#8208;PT were reversed and amplified after thermal annealing treatment. The |glum| values of the co&#8208;assembled PTZ@R/S&#8208;PB2 were up to 0.13 at a 32&#8197;nm thickness, which was 5.4 times that of R/S&#8208;PT (|glum|=0.024). This is due to PTZ@R/S&#8208;PB2 could form more orderly chiral co&#8208;assembly structures. Noticeably, increasing the LCP film thickness could further improve the glum value, and the maximum glum of PTZ@R/S&#8208;PB2 could be enhanced to +0.91/&#8722;0.82 at a 220&#8197;nm thickness.

         <title>The impact of stoichiometry on the initial steps of crystal formation: Stability and lifetime of charged triple&#8208;ion complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 20, April 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Charged Triple&#8208;Ion Clusters (CTICs) form by addition of an anion or cation to an ion pair and are intermediate species on ionic&#8208;crystal nucleation pathways. Computations show that the energies and lifetimes for positive and negative CTICs vary differently for BaSO4 and CaCO3. This difference can be related to asymmetrical nucleation behavior observed in solutions with cation&#8208; versus with anion excess.







Abstract
Minerals form in natural systems from solutions with varying ratios of their lattice ions, yet non&#8208;stoichiometric conditions have generally been overlooked in investigations of new formation (nucleation) of ionic crystals. Here, we investigated the influence of cation:anion ratio in the solution on the initial steps of nucleation by studying positively and negatively charged triple ion complexes and subsequent particle size evolution. Our model systems are carbonates and sulfates of calcium and barium, as it was recently shown that solution stoichiometry affects the timing and rate of their nucleation. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and dynamic light scattering (DLS) flow experiments show that nucleation correlates with the stability and lifetime of the initial complexes, which were significantly impacted by the cation:anion stoichiometry and ion type. Specifically,

 and

This suggests a causal relationship between the stability and lifetime of the initial charged complexes and the nucleation under non&#8208;stoichiometric conditions.

         <title>Influence Mechanism of Interfacial Oxidation of Li3YCl6 Solid Electrolyte on Reduction Potential</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 20, April 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, we confirmed the influence of oxidative byproducts of Li3YCl6 on its reduction potential and investigates its redox mechanism. Through combined characterization techniques and electrochemical measurements, it was discovered that when the cathode voltage surpassed the oxidation voltage of the electrolyte or in the presence of an exotic element&#8208;induced condition, the electrolyte underwent oxidation of the halide element, resulting in the absence of ligands. Simultaneously, such process generated LixYCl3+x with a distinct reduction potential compared to pristine Li3YCl6. The Y element within LixYCl3+x experienced reduction to a lower valence state during the discharge process. Consequently, such structural change led to a significant rise in interfacial impedance and a decline in the performance of all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries.







Abstract
Halide&#8208;based solid electrolytes are promising candidates for all solid&#8208;state lithium&#8208;ion batteries (ASSLBs) due to their high ionic conductivity, wide electrochemical window, and excellent chemical stability with cathode materials. However, when tested in practice, their intrinsic electrochemical stability windows do not well match the conditions for stable operation of ASSBs. Existing literature reports halide&#8208;based ASSBs that still operate well outside the electrochemical stability window, while ASSBs that do not operate within the window are not well studied or the studies are based on the cathode material interface. In this study, we aim to elucidate the mechanism behind all&#8208;solid&#8208;state battery failure by investigating how the reduction potential of Li3YCl6 solid&#8208;state electrolyte itself changes under overcharging conditions. Our findings demonstrate that in Li&#8208;In|Li3YCl6|Li3YCl6&#8208;C half&#8208;cells during the first state of charge, Cl ions participate in charge compensation, resulting in a depletion of ligands. This phenomenon significantly affects the reduction potential of Y3+, causing it to be reduced to Y2Cl3 and ultimately to Y0 at conditions far exceeding its actual reduction potential. Furthermore, we analyze the interfacial impedance induced by this process and propose a novel perspective on battery failure.

         <title>Electrochemical Dearomatizing Methoxylation of Phenols and Naphthols: Synthetic and Computational Studies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 20, April 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Phenols and naphthols are dearomatized to methoxycyclohexadienones under simple and robust electrochemical conditions, in a green way without chemical oxidants. The mechanism of the reaction is established using density functional theory calculations, which also explain the chemo&#8208; and regioselectivity for differently&#8208;substituted substrates.







Abstract
The electrochemical oxidative dearomatizing methoxylation of phenols and naphthols was developed. It provides an alternative route for the preparation of methoxycyclohexadienones, important and versatile synthetic intermediates, that eliminates the need for stoichiometric high&#8208;energy chemical oxidants and generates hydrogen as a sole by&#8208;product. The reaction proceeds in a simple constant current mode, in an undivided cell, and it employs standardized instrumentation. A collection of methoxycyclohexadienones derived from various 2,4,6&#8208;tri&#8208;substituted phenols and 1&#8208;substituted&#8208;2&#8208;naphthols was obtained in moderate to excellent yields. These include a complex derivative of estrone, as well as methoxylated dearomatized 1,1&#8242;&#8208;bi&#8208;2&#8208;naphthols (BINOLs). The mechanism of the reaction was subject to profound investigations using density functional theory calculations. In particular, the reactivity of two key intermediates, phenoxyl radical and phenoxenium ion, was carefully examined. The obtained results shed light on the pathway leading to the desired product and rationalize experimentally observed selectivities regarding a side benzylic methoxylation and the preference for the functionalization at the para over the ortho position. They also uncover the structure&#8208;selectivity relationship, inversely correlating the steric bulk of the substrate with its propensity to undergo the side&#8208;reaction. Moreover, the loss of stereochemical information from enantiopure BINOL substrates during the reaction is rationalized by the computations.

         <title>Molecular Dynamics of Steroidal Rotors Probed by Theoretical, Spectroscopic and Dielectric Methods</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 20, April 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three different steroidal molecular rotors with a dipolar fluorine&#8208;substituted phenyl group rotator were synthesized. Raman and FT&#8208;IR measurements were used to analyse the effect of fluorine substitution on molecular dynamics of the phenyl ring. The electric properties were investigated with the impedance spectroscopy. ECD spectroscopy was used to approximate the solid&#8208;state structure of one of the rotors.







Abstract
Our study focuses on molecular rotors with fast&#8208;moving rotators and their potential applications in the development of new amphidynamic crystals. Steroidal molecular rotors with a dipolar fluorine&#8208;substituted phenyl group as the rotator were synthesized and characterized. Three different rotors were investigated with varying numbers of fluorine atoms. A comprehensive analysis was performed using vibrational spectroscopy (Raman, FT&#8208;IR), electronic circular dichroism (ECD), and dielectric response to understand the behavior of the investigated model rotors. The results were supported by theoretical calculations using Density Functional Theory (DFT) methods. The angle&#8208;dependent polarized Raman spectra confirmed the crystallinity of the samples. Nearly frequency and temperature&#8208;independent permittivity suggest low&#8208;frequency librational motion of stators. An in&#8208;depth analysis of ECD spectra revealed high conformational flexibility in solution, resulting in low ECD effects, while in the solid&#8208;state with restricted rotation, significant ECD effects were observed. These findings shed light on the conformational behavior and potential applications of the studied steroidal molecular rotors.

         <title>Exceptional capture of methane at low pressure by an iron&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic framework</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 20, April 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
MFM&#8208;300(Fe) shows exceptional high uptake of CH4 at low pressure, which enables the highly efficient capture of CH4 and separation of CH4/N2 under ambient conditions. The unique and strong binding interaction between MFM&#8208;300(Fe) and CH4 is revealed structurally via complementary experimental techniques coupled with modelling.







Abstract
The selective capture of methane (CH4) at low concentrations and its separation from N2 are extremely challenging owing to the weak host&#8208;guest interactions between CH4 molecules and any sorbent material. Here, we report the exceptional adsorption of CH4 at low pressure and the efficient separation of CH4/N2 by MFM&#8208;300(Fe). MFM&#8208;300(Fe) shows a very high uptake for CH4 of 0.85&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 1&#8197;mbar and 298&#8197;K and a record CH4/N2 selectivity of 45 for porous solids, representing a new benchmark for CH4 capture and CH4/N2 separation. The excellent separation of CH4/N2 by MFM&#8208;300(Fe) has been confirmed by dynamic breakthrough experiments. In&#8197;situ neutron powder diffraction, and solid&#8208;state nuclear magnetic resonance and diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopies, coupled with modelling, reveal a unique and strong binding of CH4 molecules involving Fe&#8722;OH&#8943;CH4 and C&#8943;phenyl ring interactions within the pores of MFM&#8208;300(Fe), thus promoting the exceptional adsorption of CH4 at low pressure.

&lt;p&gt;MFM-300(Fe) shows exceptional high uptake of CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; at low pressure, which enables the highly efficient capture of CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and separation of CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;/N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; under ambient conditions. The unique and strong binding interaction between MFM-300(Fe) and CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; is revealed structurally &lt;i&gt;via&lt;/i&gt; complementary experimental techniques coupled with modelling.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The selective capture of methane (CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) at low concentrations and its separation from N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are extremely challenging owing to the weak host-guest interactions between CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; molecules and any sorbent material. Here, we report the exceptional adsorption of CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; at low pressure and the efficient separation of CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;/N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; by MFM-300(Fe). MFM-300(Fe) shows a very high uptake for CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; of 0.85&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 1&#8197;mbar and 298&#8197;K and a record CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;/N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; selectivity of 45 for porous solids, representing a new benchmark for CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; capture and CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;/N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; separation. The excellent separation of CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;/N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; by MFM-300(Fe) has been confirmed by dynamic breakthrough experiments. &lt;i&gt;In&#8197;situ&lt;/i&gt; neutron powder diffraction, and solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance and diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopies, coupled with modelling, reveal a unique and strong binding of CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; molecules involving Fe&#8722;OH&#8943;CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and C&#8943;phenyl ring interactions within the pores of MFM-300(Fe), thus promoting the exceptional adsorption of CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; at low pressure.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Geometric and Electronic Engineering in Co/VN Nanoparticles to Boost Bifunctional Oxygen Electrocatalysis for Aqueous/Flexible Zn&#8208;Air Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 20, April 5, 2024. </description>

The Co/VN@NC nanofoam exhibits a competitive difference (0.65 V) between the half&#8208;wave potential of ORR and OER potential at 10 mA cm&#8722;2, leading to an elevated peak power density (156/85 mW cm&#8722;2) in aqueous/flexible ZABs. It is attributed to the disordered carbon reinforcing the confinement of electrons, and the coupling of components optimizing the absorption of intermediates.







Abstract
Modulating metal&#8208;metal and metal&#8208;support interactions is one of the potent tools for augmenting catalytic performance. Herein, highly active Co/VN nanoparticles are well dispersed on three&#8208;dimensional porous carbon nanofoam (Co/VN@NC) with the assistance of dicyandiamide. Studies certify that the consequential disordered carbon substrate reinforces the confinement of electrons, while the coupling of diverse components optimizes charge redistribution among species. Besides, theoretical analyses confirm that the regulated electron configuration can significantly tune the binding strength between the active sites and intermediates, thus optimizing reaction energy barriers. Therefore, Co/VN@NC exhibits a competitive potential difference (&#916;E, 0.65&#8197;V) between the half&#8208;wave potential of ORR and OER potential at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, outperforming Pt/C+RuO2 (0.67&#8197;V). Further, catalyst&#8208;based aqueous/flexible ZABs present superior performances with peak power densities of 156 and 85&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2, superior to Pt/C&#8208;based counterparts (128 and 73&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2). This research provides a pivotal foundation for the evolution of bifunctional catalysts in the energy sector.

         <title>Divergent Electrochemical Synthesis of Indoles through pKa Regulation of Amides: Synthetic and Mechanistic Insights</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 20, April 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This manuscript describes an unprecedented chemo&#8208;divergent synthesis of C&#8208;3&#8208;free and C&#8208;3&#8208;selenylated indoles with exclusive chemoselectivity through controlled and selective electrochemical oxidation of 2&#8208;amino stilbene derivatives. The chemoselectivity was achieved by regulating the pKa of the N&#8722;H proton. Detailed experimental and computational studies assist in explaining the ambiguous chemical nature of diversely N&#8208;protected 2&#8208;amino stilbenes in synthesizing chemo&#8208;divergent indole frameworks.







Abstract
A divergent synthetic approach to access highly substituted indole scaffolds is illustrated. By virtue of a tunable electrochemical strategy, distinct control over the C&#8208;3 substitution pattern was achieved by employing two analogous 2&#8208;styrylaniline precursors. The chemoselectivity is governed by the fine&#8208;tuning of the acidity of the amide proton, relying on the appropriate selection of N&#8208;protecting groups, and assisted by the reactivity of the electrogenerated intermediates. Detailed mechanistic investigations based on cyclic voltametric experiments and computational studies revealed the crucial role of water additive, which assists the proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer event for highly acidic amide precursors, followed by an energetically favorable intramolecular C&#8722;N coupling, causing exclusive fabrication of the C&#8208;3 unsubstituted indoles. Alternatively, the implementation of an electrogenerated cationic olefin activator delivers the C&#8208;3 substituted indoles through the preferential nucleophilic nature of the N&#8208;acyl amides. This electrochemical approach of judicious selection of N&#8208;protecting groups to regulate pKa/E&#176; provides an expansion in the domain of switchable generation of heterocyclic derivatives in a sustainable fashion, with high regio&#8208; and chemoselectivity.

         <title>Oxidation of Alcohols in Continuous Flow with a Solid Phase Hypervalent Iodine Catalyst</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 20, April 5, 2024. </description>

Discover a sustainable, solid&#8208;phase catalyst for fast and efficient oxidation of a wide range of alcohols to their corresponding carbonyls in continuous flow! The new approach enables successful oxidation of various alcohols, including previously unreactive primary alcohols, with minimal catalyst loadings and rapid product accessibility.







Abstract
One of the most useful transformations in the synthetic chemist arsenal is the oxidation of alcohols to their corresponding carbonyl congeners. Despite its seemingly straightforward nature, this transformative reaction predominantly relies on the use of metals or hazardous reagents, making these processes highly unsustainable. To address this challenge, we have developed a sustainable metal&#8208;free method for the oxidation of alcohols in continuous flow. Using a solid phase hypervalent iodine catalyst and nBu4HSO5 as a phase transfer catalyst and co&#8208;oxidant, primary and secondary alcohols were selectively oxidized to the corresponding carbonyl motifs. This operationally simple continuous&#8208;flow set&#8208;up is highly robust (15 cycles run without significant catalyst leaching or loss of reaction efficiency), uses green solvents, such as acetonitrile or acetic acid, and is readily scalable.

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light Driven Control Over Triply and Quadruply Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Supramolecular Assemblies</title>

Foldamers consisting of two hydrogen bonding motifs (HBMs) connected by a central azobenzene exhibit concentration and light dependent switching between four states.







Abstract
Supramolecular polymers offer tremendous potential to produce new &#8220;smart&#8221; materials, however, there remains a need to develop systems that are responsive to external stimuli. In this work, visible&#8208;light responsive hydrogen&#8208;bonded supramolecular polymers comprising photoresponsive supramolecular synthons (I&#8211;III) consisting of two hydrogen bonding motifs (HBMs) connected by a central ortho&#8208;tetrafluorinated azobenzene have been characterized by DOSY NMR and viscometry. Comparison of different hydrogen&#8208;bonding motifs reveals that assembly in the low and high concentration regimes is strongly influenced by the strength of association between the HBMs. I, Incorporating a triply hydrogen&#8208;bonded heterodimer, was found to exhibit concentration dependent switching between a monomeric pseudo&#8208;cycle and supramolecular oligomer through intermolecular hydrogen bonding interactions between the HBMs. II, Based on the same photoresponsive scaffold, and incorporating a quadruply hydrogen&#8208;bonded homodimer was found to form a supramolecular polymer which was dependent upon the ring&#8208;chain equilibrium and thus dependent upon both concentration and photochemical stimulus. Finally, III, incorporating a quadruply hydrogen&#8208;bonded heterodimer represents the first photoswitchable AB type hydrogen&#8208;bonded supramolecular polymer. Depending on the concentration and photostationary state, four different assemblies dominate for both monomers II and III, demonstrating the ability to control supramolecular assembly and physical properties triggered by light.

Comparison of different hydrogen-bonding motifs reveals that assembly in the low and high concentration regimes is strongly influenced by the strength of association between the HBMs. &lt;b&gt;I&lt;/b&gt;, Incorporating a triply hydrogen-bonded heterodimer, was found to exhibit concentration dependent switching between a monomeric pseudo-cycle and supramolecular oligomer through intermolecular hydrogen bonding interactions between the HBMs. &lt;b&gt;II&lt;/b&gt;, Based on the same photoresponsive scaffold, and incorporating a quadruply hydrogen-bonded homodimer was found to form a supramolecular polymer which was dependent upon the ring-chain equilibrium and thus dependent upon both concentration and photochemical stimulus. Finally, &lt;b&gt;III&lt;/b&gt;, incorporating a quadruply hydrogen-bonded heterodimer represents the first photoswitchable &lt;i&gt;AB&lt;/i&gt; type hydrogen-bonded supramolecular polymer. Depending on the concentration and photostationary state, four different assemblies dominate for both monomers &lt;b&gt;II&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;III&lt;/b&gt;, demonstrating the ability to control supramolecular assembly and physical properties triggered by light.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

An asymmetric double desymmetrization reaction has been realized through vinylogous Michael addition reaction of prochiral &#945;,&#945;&#8208;dicyanocyclohexane to 2,2&#8208;disubstituted cyclopentene&#8208;1,3&#8208;dione catalyzed by a chiral Ag&#8208;(R)&#8208;DTBM&#8208;SEGPHOS catalyst. This method enables the formation of four chiral centers, including an all&#8208;carbon quaternary stereocenter in a single C&#8722;C bond formation event.







Abstract
An asymmetric double desymmetrization methodology has been developed for synthesizing densely functionalized chiral cyclopentylcyclohexane scaffolds. We have constructed four chiral centers, including an all&#8208;carbon quaternary stereocenter in a single C&#8722;C bond formation event. The methodology has high functional&#8208;group tolerance and delivers a broad range of enantioenriched products. This vinylogous Michael addition reaction of prochiral &#945;,&#945;&#8208;dicyanocyclohexane to 2,2&#8208;disubstituted cyclopentene&#8208;1,3&#8208;dione is catalyzed by a chiral Ag&#8208;(R)&#8208;DTBM&#8208;SEGPHOS catalyst.

         <title>Exploring the Theoretical Foundations of Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence (TADF) Emission: A Comprehensive TD&#8208;DFT Study on Phenothiazine Systems</title>

         <dc:description>
Exploring Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence (TADF) in phenothiazine&#8208;based systems, through this study, we analyse ten recognized TADF&#8208;active configurations using TD&#8208;DFT and Multiwfn. It validates El Sayed&#8242;s rule and visualizes charge transfer dynamics, exploring diverse sulfur oxidation states and phenothiazine substitutions to identify additional TADF&#8208;active compounds. Insights into rISC rates and dihedral angles contribute to a comprehensive understanding, guiding phenothiazine material design for experimentalists.







Abstract
This study conducts a thorough theoretical investigation of Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence (TADF) in phenothiazine&#8208;based systems, examining ten molecular configurations recognized experimentally as TADF&#8208;active. Employing Time&#8208;Dependent Density Functional Theory (TD&#8208;DFT), our analysis spans the investigation of singlet&#8208;triplet energy gaps (&#916;EST), spin&#8208;orbit coupling, and excitation characteristics using Multiwfn. This approach not only validates the adherence to El Sayed's rule across these systems but also provides a detailed understanding of charge transfer dynamics, as visualized through heat maps. A significant aspect of our study is the exploration of different oxidation states of sulfur and site substitutions on phenothiazine. This systematic variation aims to identify additional TADF&#8208;active compounds, drawing parallels with properties characterizing other known TADF emitters. Our investigation into Reverse Intersystem Crossing (rISC) rates and the analysis of dihedral angles in relation to &#916;EST values offer nuanced insights into the TADF behaviours of these molecules. By integrating rigorous computational analysis with practical implications, we provide a foundational understanding that enhances the design and optimization of phenothiazine&#8208;based materials for optoelectronic applications. This work not only advances our theoretical understanding of TADF in phenothiazine derivatives but also serves as a guide for experimentalists and industry professionals in the strategic design of new TADF materials.

         <title>Aurones: Unexplored Visible&#8208;Light Photoswitches for Aqueous Medium</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 20, April 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aurone derivatives have been introduced for the first time as a novel class of visible&#8208;light photoswitches in aqueous medium possessing good quantum yields, high conversions in photostationary states and remarkably long (up to 7 years) lifetimes of the photoisomers. Moreover, the aurone scaffold can be easily modified with functional substituents without affecting its robust photochemical performance paving a way towards a range of applications.







Abstract
The development of synthetically accessible photoswitches showing an efficient performance in aqueous medium has recently become an urgent task due to the rapid progress of photopharmacology and novel biomedical applications. In response to this challenge, in this work, aurone derivatives are introduced as a novel class of efficient visible&#8208;light photoswitches for aqueous medium. In general, aurones exhibit superior performance in water, including significantly higher quantum yields, compared with other indigoid photoswitches (hemithioindigo and hemiindigo). Especially remarkable are the half&#8208;lives of the photoinduced E&#8208;isomers of aurones in water, reaching up to 7&#8197;years. Further modification of the aurone scaffold with substituents that increase water solubility does not affect most of the photoswitching characteristics and even improves some them. The highly advantageous property profile of the aurone photoswitches make them a perfect novel platform for the design of light&#8208;controllable systems in the areas requiring photoswitching in aqueous medium.

         <title>Photoswitching in a Liquid Crystalline Pt(II) Coordination Complex</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 20, April 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An example of single&#8208;component multimode photoswitch was demonstrated by designing a novel Pt(II) coordination complex decorated with spiropyran, which can deliver distinct apparent colors, photoluminescent colors and liquid crystal textures in response to light.







Abstract
Photoswitching of photoluminescence has sparked tremendous research interests for super&#8208;resolution imaging, high&#8208;security&#8208;level anti&#8208;counterfeiting, and other high&#8208;tech applications. However, the excitation of photoluminescence is usually ready to trigger the photoswitching process, making the photoluminescence readout unreliable. Herein, we report a new photoswitch by the marriage of spiropyran with platinum(II) coordination complex. Viable photoluminescence can be achieved upon excitation by 480&#8197;nm visible light while the photoswitching can be easily triggered by 365&#8197;nm UV light. The feasible photoswitching may be benefited from the formed liquid crystalline (LC) phase of the designed photoswitch as a crystalline spiropyran is normally unable to implement photoswitching. Compared to the counterparts, this LC photoswitch can show distinct and reliable apparent colors and emission colors before and after photoswitching, which may promise the utility in high&#8208;security&#8208;level anti&#8208;counterfeiting and other advanced information technologies.

         <title>Polymer Backbone Chemistry Shapes the Alkaline Stability of Metallopolymer Anion&#8208;Exchange Membranes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 20, April 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metallopolymers employ a metal center to facilitate the transport of ions in anion&#8208;exchange membranes. The characteristics of metallopolymers emerge from the intricate interplay between the metal complex and polymer backbone. Our investigation scrutinizes the influence of polymer backbone chemistry on the metalation reaction and the alkaline resilience of metallopolymers.

Anion&#8208;exchange membrane fuel cells and water electrolyzers have garnered significant attention in past years due to their potential role in sustainable and affordable energy conversion and storage. However, the chemical stability of the polymeric anion&#8208;exchange membranes (AEMs), the key component in these devices, currently limits their lifespan. Recently, metallopolymers have been proposed as chemically stable alternatives to organic cations, using metal centers as ion transporters. In metallopolymer AEMs, various properties such as alkaline stability, water uptake, flexibility, and performance, are determined by both the metal complex and polymer backbone. Herein we present a systematic study investigating the influence of the polymer backbone chemistry on some of these properties, focusing on the alkaline stability of low&#8208;oxophilicity gold metallopolymers. Despite the use of a common N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene ligand, upon gold metalation using the same reaction conditions, different polymer backbones end up forming different gold complexes. These findings suggest that polymer chemistry affects the metalation reaction in addition to the other properties relevant to AEM performance.

&lt;p&gt;Metallopolymers employ a metal center to facilitate the transport of ions in anion-exchange membranes. The characteristics of metallopolymers emerge from the intricate interplay between the metal complex and polymer backbone. Our investigation scrutinizes the influence of polymer backbone chemistry on the metalation reaction and the alkaline resilience of metallopolymers.

Octamethylcalix[4]pyrrole (omC4P) behaves like alkali metals and reacts with halogens (X) via the harpoon mechanism to form charge&#8208;separated omC4P+&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;X&#8722; complexes.harpoon reactionlong range electron transferphotoelectron spectroscopy







Abstract
The harpoon mechanism has been a milestone in molecular reaction dynamics. Until now, the entity from which electron harpooning occurs has been either alkali metal atoms or non&#8208;metallic analogs in their excited states. In this work, we demonstrate that a common organic molecule, octamethylcalix[4] pyrrole (omC4P), behaves just like alkali metal atoms, enabling the formation of charge&#8208;separated ionic bonding complexes with halogens omC4P+&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;X&#8722; (X=F&#8722;I, SCN) via the harpoon mechanism. Their electronic structures and chemical bonding were determined by cryogenic photoelectron spectroscopy of the corresponding anions and confirmed by theoretical analyses. The omC4P+&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;X&#8722; could be visualized to form from the reactants omC4P+X via electron harpooning from omC4P to X at a distance defined by the energy difference between the ionization potential of omC4P and electron affinity of X.

         <title>Versatile Polymerization&#8208;Induced Emission Polymers from Barbier Polymerization of Cinnamic Esters with Tunable Emission</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 20, April 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cinnamic ester was successfully used as monomer to prepare polymers with NTIL characteristics through Barbier PIE strategy, which exhibited adjustable NTIL from AIE type to ACQ type. Further potential applications and the mechanism of luminescent polymer in explosive detection were carried out.







Abstract
Cinnamic ester is a common and abundant chemical substance, which can be extracted from natural plants. Compared with traditional esters, cinnamic ester contains &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated carbonyl structure with multiple reactive sites, resulting in more abundant reactivities and chemical structures. Here, a versatile polymerization&#8208;induced emission (PIE) is successfully demonstrated through Barbier polymerization of cinnamic ester. Attributed to its abundant reactivities of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated carbonyl structure, Barbier polymerization of cinnamic esters with different organodihalides gives polyalcohol and polyketone via 1,2&#8208;addition and 1,4&#8208;addition, respectively, which is also confirmed by small molecular model reactions. Meanwhile, these organodihalides dependant polyalcohol and polyketone exhibit different non&#8208;traditional intrinsic luminescence (NTIL) from aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) type to aggregation&#8208;caused quenching (ACQ) type, where novel PIE luminogens (PIEgens) are revealed. Further potential applications in explosive detection are carried out, where it achieves TNT detection sensitivity at&#8197;ppm level in solution and ng level on the test paper. This work therefore expands the structure and functionality libraries of monomer, polymer and NTIL, which might cause inspirations to different fields including polymer chemistry, NTIL, AIE and PIE.

         <title>Synthesis and functionalities of FeSn12 superatom prepared by single atom introduction with a dendrimer template</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 20, April 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Development of synthesis method for superatoms is significant for the design to mimic an atom. The asymmetric dendrimer &#8220;pyTPM G4&#8221; introduces one Fe atom, making solution&#8208;phase synthesis of FeSn12. The synthesis and obtained structure were clarified and the electronic state was investigated by theoretical calculations. The prepared superatom showed Near&#8208;IR emission and magnetism enhancement.







Abstract
Superatoms are promising as new building block materials that can be designed by precise controlling of the constituent atoms. Stannaspherene (Sn122&#8722;) is a rigid cage&#8208;like cluster with icosahedral symmetry, for which one&#8208;atom encapsulation was theoretically expected and detected in the gas phase. Here, a single&#8208;atom introduction method into stannaspherene using a dendrimer template with polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) protection is demonstrated. This advanced solution&#8208;phase synthesis allows not only the selective doping of one atom into the cluster cage, but also enable further detail characterization of optical and magnetic properties that were not possible in the gas&#8208;phase synthesis. In other words, this liquid&#8208;phase synthesis method has enabled the adaptation of detailed analytical methods. In this study, FeSn12 was synthesized and characterized, revealing that a single Fe atom introduction in the Sn122&#8722; cage result in the appearance of near&#8208;infrared emission and enhancement in the magnetism.

A chemistry professor explains the mechanism of the copper(I)&#8208;catalyzed alkyne&#8211;azide cycloaddition (CuAAC) while suggesting that by interrupting the click reaction, it is possible to exploit the reactivity of the copper metallacycle intermediate to synthesize new products. The students who are listening are imagining novel synthetic pathways and finding ways to access products that are typically hard to obtain. More information can be found in the Review by M. Giustiniano, G.&#8197;C. Tron and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202303844).

Defect engineering holds tremendous potential for improving the electrochemical reduction of nitrate to ammonia through the precise modulation of the electronic and geometric structures of catalysts. This review provides a comprehensive overview of recent advancements in defect engineering for nitrate reduction, while also highlighting promising unexplored avenues for further progress in this field.







Abstract
Electrocatalytic nitrate (NO3&#8722;) reduction to ammonia (NH3) is a &#8220;two birds&#8208;one stone&#8221; method that targets remediation of NO3&#8722;&#8208;containing sewage and production of valuable NH3. The exploitation of advanced catalysts with high activity, selectivity, and durability is a key issue for the efficient catalytic performance. Among various strategies for catalyst design, defect engineering has gained increasing attention due to its ability to modulate the electronic properties of electrocatalysts and optimize the adsorption energy of reactive species, thereby enhancing the catalytic performance. Despite previous progress, there remains a lack of mechanistic insights into the regulation of catalyst defects for NO3&#8722; reduction. Herein, this review presents insightful understanding of defect engineering for NO3&#8722; reduction, covering its background, definition, classification, construction, and underlying mechanisms. Moreover, the relationships between regulation of catalyst defects and their catalytic activities are illustrated by investigating the properties of electrocatalysts through the analysis of electronic band structure, charge density distribution, and controllable adsorption energy. Furthermore, challenges and perspectives for future development of defects in NO3RR are also discussed, which can help researchers to better understand the defect engineering in catalysts, and also inspire scientists entering into this promising field.

         <title>Design Strategies towards Advanced Hydrogen Evolution Reaction Electrocatalysts at Large Current Densities</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 20, April 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
To bridge the gap between academia and industry for water electrolysis to produce hydrogen, in this review, design strategies from five aspects including number of active sites, intrinsic activity of each site, charge transfer, mass transfer, and stability are summarized for achieving highly active and robust large&#8208;current&#8208;density hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) electrocatalysts.







Abstract
Hydrogen (H2), produced by water electrolysis with the electricity from renewable sources, is an ideal energy carrier for achieving a carbon&#8208;neutral and sustainable society. Hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is the cathodic half&#8208;reaction of water electrolysis, which requires active and robust electrocatalysts to reduce the energy consumption for H2 generation. Despite numerous electrocatalysts have been reported by the academia for HER, most of them were only tested under relatively small current densities for a short period, which cannot meet the requirements for industrial water electrolysis. To bridge the gap between academia and industry, it is crucial to develop highly active HER electrocatalysts which can operate at large current densities for a long time. In this review, the mechanisms of HER in acidic and alkaline electrolytes are firstly introduced. Then, design strategies towards high&#8208;performance large&#8208;current&#8208;density HER electrocatalysts from five aspects including number of active sites, intrinsic activity of each site, charge transfer, mass transfer, and stability are discussed via featured examples. Finally, our own insights about the challenges and future opportunities in this emerging field are presented.

         <title>Each Interruption is an Opportunity: Novel Synthetic Strategies Explored Through Interrupted Click Reactions</title>

The copper&#8208;catalyzed reaction between azides and alkynes, known as CuAAC, has allowed for the efficient synthesis of 1,2,3&#8208;trisubstituted 1,4&#8208;triazoles and the formation of a metallocycle intermediate. This intermediate can be used for creating new structures or generating multi&#8208;component reactions, collectively referred to as &#8220;interrupted click reactions&#8221;







Abstract
The particular and unique mechanism of the copper&#8208;catalyzed reaction between azides and alkynes (CuAAC) has not only allowed for the efficient synthesis of 1,2,3&#8208;trisubstituted 1,4&#8208;triazoles in excellent yields and under mild conditions, becoming the quintessential click reaction, but it has also enabled the straightforward formation of a metallocycle intermediate, the copper triazolyl. This, under suitable reaction conditions able to suppress its protonolysis, can be used either for the creation of new bicyclic triazolyl structures or for the generation of novel three or four&#8208;component reactions. The aim of this review is to rationalize and unify all these transformations, which are collectively referred to as &#8220;interrupted click reactions&#8221;.

Shaping Chirality from Heterocyles. The mild, organocatalytic generation of elusive ortho&#8208;quinodimethane intermediates (Het&#8208;oQDMs) from suitable heteroaromatic carbonyl&#8208; or carbonyl&#8208;like pronucleophiles has recently proved to be succesful in the development of enantioselective [4+2] cycloadditions, giving access to novel, chiral heterocyclic chemotypes featuring in&#8208;cycle stereocenters. This review provides a critical analysis of the most important advances in the field achieved in the last decade.







Abstract
Polycyclic compounds bearing a complex heterocyclic core such as an aromatic heterocycle &#8220;fused&#8221; with one or more functionalized rings, are widespread leading molecules in the domain of synthetic organic chemistry and pharmaceuticals. Although many synthetic methodologies have been devised to access achiral, fused heteroaromatic scaffolds, or related chiral variants adorned with out&#8208;of&#8208;cycle stereogenic elements, equally efficient strategies to afford chiral heterocycles featuring in&#8208;cycle stereocenters, exist to a lesser extent and presently represent a growing field of investigation.

         <title>The Catalytic Asymmetric Allylic Alkylation of Acyclic Enolates for the Construction of Quaternary and Tetrasubstituted Stereogenic Centres</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 20, April 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review describes the catalytic asymmetric allylic alkylation (AAA) of acyclic prochiral nucleophiles, namely enolates, as a means of accessing congested quaternary and tetrasubstituted stereogenic centres. In particular, strategies for the stereocontrolled access to acyclic enolate nucleophiles, as well as the impact of enolate geometry on the stereochemical outcome of allylic alkylation, are highlighted.







Abstract
To facilitate the discovery and development of new pharmaceuticals, the demand for novel stereofunctionalised building blocks has never been greater. Whilst molecules bearing quaternary and tetrasubstituted stereogenic centres are ideally suited to explore untapped areas of chemical space, the asymmetric construction ofsterically congested carbon centres remains a longstanding challenge in organic synthesis. The enantioselective assembly of acyclic stereogenic centres is even more demanding due to the need to restrict a much wider range of geometries and conformations of the intermediates involved. In this context, the catalytic asymmetric allylicalkylation (AAA) of acyclic prochiral nucleophiles, namely enolates, has become an indispensable tool to access a range of linear&#945;&#8208;quaternary and&#945;&#8208;tetrasubstituted carbonyl compounds. However, unlike the AAA of cyclic enolates with a fixed enolate geometry, to achieve high levels of stereocontrol in the AAA of acyclic enolates, the stereoselectivity of enolisation must be considered. The aim of this review is to offer acomprehensivediscussion of catalytic AAA reactions of acyclic prochiral enolates and their analogues to generate congested quaternary and tetrasubstituted chiral centres using metal, non&#8208;metal and dual catalysis, with particular focus given to the control of enolate geometry and its impact on the stereochemical outcome of the reaction.

         <title>A Fluorination Strategy and Low&#8208;Acidity Anchoring Group in Self&#8208;Assembled Molecules for Efficient and Stable Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we synthesized two donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;A) type small organic molecules with self&#8208;assembly properties, namely MPA&#8208;BT&#8208;BA and MPA&#8208;2FBT&#8208;BA, both containing a low acidity anchoring group, benzoic acid. After systematically investigation, it is found that, with the fluorination, the MPA&#8208;2FBT&#8208;BA demonstrates a lower highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy level, higher hole mobility, higher hydrophobicity and stronger interaction with the perovskite layer than that of MPA&#8208;BT&#8208;BA. As a result, the device based&#8208;on MPA&#8208;2FBT&#8208;BA displays a better crystallization and morphology of perovskite layer with larger grain size and less non&#8208;radiative recombination. Consequently, the device using MPA&#8208;2FBT&#8208;BA as hole transport material achieved the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 20.32% and remarkable stability. After being kept in an N2 glove box for 116 days, the unsealed PSCs&#8217; device retained 93% of its initial PCE. Even exposed to air with a relative humidity range of 30&#177;5% for 43 days, its PCE remained above 91% of its initial condition. This study highlights the vital importance of the fluorination strategy combined with a low acidity anchoring group in SAMs, offering a pathway to achieve efficient and stable PSCs.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis and Functionalization of Azetidine&#8208;Containing Small Macrocyclic Peptides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Incorporation of a 3&#8208;aminoazetidine (3&#8208;AAz) into peptide backbones improves head&#8208;to&#8208;tail cyclizations compared to unmodified peptides. The azetidine nitrogen can be readily functionalized using substitution or click chemistry. Crystal structure analysis reveals that a 3&#8208;AAz modified cyclic tetrapeptide adopts an uncommon all&#8208;trans conformation. The 3&#8208;AAz provides stability to protease degradation compared to the unmodified macrocycle.







Abstract
Cyclic peptides are increasingly important structures in drugs but their development can be impeded by difficulties associated with their synthesis. Here, we introduce the 3&#8208;aminoazetidine (3&#8208;AAz) subunit as a new turn&#8208;inducing element for the efficient synthesis of small head&#8208;to&#8208;tail cyclic peptides. Greatly improved cyclizations of tetra&#8208;, penta&#8208; and hexapeptides (28 examples) under standard reaction conditions are achieved by introduction of this element within the linear peptide precursor. Post&#8208;cyclization deprotection of the amino acid side chains with strong acid is realized without degradation of the strained four&#8208;membered azetidine. A special feature of this chemistry is that further late&#8208;stage modification of the resultant macrocyclic peptides can be achieved via the 3&#8208;AAz unit. This is done by: (i) chemoselective deprotection and substitution at the azetidine nitrogen, or by (ii) a click&#8208;based approach employing a 2&#8208;propynyl carbamate on the azetidine nitrogen. In this way, a range of dye and biotin tagged macrocycles are readily produced. Structural insights gained by XRD analysis of a cyclic tetrapeptide indicate that the azetidine ring encourages access to the less stable, all&#8208;trans conformation. Moreover, introduction of a 3&#8208;AAz into a representative cyclohexapeptide improves stability towards proteases compared to the homodetic macrocycle.

         <title>A pH&#8208;Responsive Topological Switch Based on a DNA Quadruplex&#8208;Duplex Hybrid</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The conformation of a quadruplex&#8208;duplex hybrid interconverts between antiparallel and (3+1) hybrid topologies as a function of pH. This topological transition is associated with adenine protonation to form a capping structure in a slightly acidic environment and may be used as a pH&#8208;sensitive DNA nanoswitch.







Abstract
A guanine&#8208;rich oligonucleotide based on a human telomeric sequence but with the first three&#8208;nucleotide intervening stretch replaced by a putative 15&#8208;nucleotide hairpin&#8208;forming sequence shows a pH&#8208;dependent folding into different quadruplex&#8208;duplex hybrids in a potassium containing buffer. At slightly acidic pH, the quadruplex domain adopts a chair&#8208;type conformation. Upon increasing the pH, a transition with a midpoint close to neutral pH to a major and minor (3+1) hybrid topology with either a coaxially stacked or orthogonally oriented duplex stem&#8208;loop occurs. NMR&#8208;derived high&#8208;resolution structures reveal that an adenine protonation is prerequisite for the formation of a non&#8208;canonical base quartet, capping the outer G&#8208;tetrad at the quadruplex&#8208;duplex interface and stabilizing the antiparallel chair conformation in an acidic environment. Being directly associated with interactions at the quadruplex&#8208;duplex interface, this unique pH&#8208;dependent topological transition is fully reversible. Coupled with a conformation&#8208;sensitive optical readout demonstrated as a proof of concept using the fluorescent dye thiazole orange, the present quadruplex&#8208;duplex hybrid architecture represents a potentially valuable pH&#8208;sensing system responsive in a physiological pH range of 7&#177;1.

         <title>The Divalent Lanthanoid Triflates Ln(CF3SO3)2(CH3CN) (Ln=Sm, Eu): Structure, Luminescence, and Magnetism</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The divalent lanthanoide triflates Ln(OTf)2(CH3CN) (Ln=Sm, Eu) were prepared from the respective trivalent triflates an the metals in acetonitrile. The new salts were characterized comprehensively including luminescence spectroscopy and magnetic measurements.







Abstract
The reaction of the trivalent lanthanoide triflates Ln(OTf)3 (Ln=Sm, Eu; OTf=CF3SO3&#8722;) with the respective metals in acetonitrile leads to the Ln(II)&#8208;triflates Eu(OTf)2(CH3CN) (monoclinic, P21/n, Z=4, a=1053.54(1), b=610.28(5), c=1946.92(2) pm, &#946; =98.611(4)) and Sm(OTf)2(CH3CN) (monoclinic, P21/n, Z=4, a=1054.41(4), b=612.16(2), c=1952.65(7) pm, &#946; =98.524(2)). The isotypic strontium compound Sr(OTf)2(CH3CN) (monoclinic, P21/n, Z=4, a=1056.39(5), b=610.05(3), c=1950.1(1) pm, &#946; =98.900(2)&#176;) has been obtained from SrCO3 and triflic acid. The compounds have been investigated by X&#8208;ray diffraction, vibrational spectroscopy, luminescence spectroscopy, cyclic voltammetry, thermal analysis, and magnetic measurements.

         <title>Design and Asymmetric Control of Orientational Chirality by Using the Combination of C(sp2)&#8208;C(sp) Levers and Achiral N&#8208;Protecting Group</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report herein the design of the asymmetric synthesis of orientational atropisomers via Sonogashira coupling as the key step. This new category of orientational atropisomers is anticipated to have a broad impact on chemical, biomedical, and material sciences in the future.







Abstract
New chiral targets of orientational chirality have been designed and asymmetrically synthesized by taking advantage of N&#8208;sulfinyl imine&#8208;directed nucleophilic addition/oxidation, Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura, and Sonogashira cross&#8208;coupling reactions. Orientation of single isomers has been selectively controlled by using aryl/alkynyl levers [C(sp2)&#8208;C(sp) axis] and tBuSO2&#8208; protecting group on nitrogen as proven by X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis. The key structural characteristic of resulting orientational products is shown by remote through&#8208;space blocking manner.

     alt="Design and Asymmetric Control of Orientational Chirality by Using the Combination of C(sp2)-C(sp) Levers and Achiral N-Protecting Group"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We report herein the design of the asymmetric synthesis of orientational atropisomers &lt;i&gt;via&lt;/i&gt; Sonogashira coupling as the key step. This new category of orientational atropisomers is anticipated to have a broad impact on chemical, biomedical, and material sciences in the future.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New chiral targets of orientational chirality have been designed and asymmetrically synthesized by taking advantage of &lt;i&gt;N-&lt;/i&gt;sulfinyl imine-directed nucleophilic addition/oxidation, Suzuki-Miyaura, and Sonogashira cross-coupling reactions. Orientation of single isomers has been selectively controlled by using aryl/alkynyl levers [C(sp&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)-C(sp) axis] and &lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;BuSO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;- protecting group on nitrogen as proven by X-ray diffraction analysis. The key structural characteristic of resulting orientational products is shown by remote through-space blocking manner. Seventeen examples of multi-step synthesis were obtained with modest to good chemical yields and complete orientational selectivity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Recognition of Amino Acid Salts by Temperature&#8208;Dependent Allosteric Binding with Stereodynamic Urea Receptors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stereodynamic homotropic allosteric receptors consisting of a rotational shaft as the axial chirality unit, terphenyl units as structural transmission sites and four urea units as binding sites have been developed to transmit and amplify induced chirality by the first guest binding to axial chirality. VT&#8208;CD spectra observed upon binding with amino acid salts showed interesting temperature&#8208;dependent Cotton effects leading to the successful discrimination of hydrocarbon&#8208;based side chains of amino acids.







Abstract
Positive homotropic artificial allosteric systems are important for the regulation of cooperativity, selectivity and nonlinear amplification. Stereodynamic homotropic allosteric receptors can transmit and amplify induced chirality by the first ligand binding to axial chirality between two chromophores. We herein report stereodynamic allosteric urea receptors consisting of a rotational shaft as the axial chirality unit, terphenyl units as structural transmission sites and four urea units as binding sites. NMR titration experiments revealed that the receptor can bind two carboxylate guests in a positive homotropic allosteric manner attributed to the inactivation by intramolecular hydrogen&#8208;bonding between urea units within the receptor. In addition, the VT&#8208;CD spectra observed upon binding of the urea receptor with l&#8208; or D&#8208;amino acid salts in MeCN showed interesting temperature&#8208;dependent Cotton effects, based on the differences of the receptor shaft unit and the guest structure. The successful discrimination of hydrocarbon&#8208;based side chains of amino acid salts indicated that the input of chiral and steric information for the guest was amplified as outputs of the Cotton effect and the temperature&#8208;dependence of VT&#8208;CD spectra through cooperativity of positive allosteric binding.

         <title>Optimal Oriented External Electric Fields to Trigger a Barrierless Oxaphosphetane Ring Opening Step of the Wittig Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The perturbed potential energy surface of the oxaphosphetane ring opening due to the optimal electric field demonstrates that the process occurs by first breaking the P&#8722;C bond and then breaking the O&#8722;C bond.







Abstract
The Wittig reaction is one of the most important processes in organic chemistry for the asymmetric synthesis of olefinic compounds. In view of the increasingly acknowledged potentiality of the electric fields in promoting reactions, here we will consider the effect of the oriented external electric field (OEEF) on the second step of Wittig reaction (i.&#8201;e. the ring opening oxaphosphetane) in a model system for non&#8208;stabilized ylides. In particular, we have determined the optimal direction and strength of the electric field that should be applied to annihilate the reaction barrier of the ring opening through the polarizable molecular electric dipole (PMED) model that we have recently developed. We conclude that the application of the optimal external electric field for the oxaphosphetane ring opening favours a Bestmann&#8208;like mechanism.

Abstract
A new noncentrosymmetric strontium borate, P1&#8208;Sr2[B5O8(OH)]2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;[B(OH)3]&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;H2O (1), has been synthesized under the hydrothermal condition. The P1&#8208;Sr2[B5O8(OH)]2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;[B(OH)3]&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;H2O shows a layered B&#8722;O network with 9&#8208;ring windows in the ab plane. Sr2+ cations, H3BO3, and H2O molecules are located in the voids of layers and interlayers, respectively. The P1&#8208;Sr2[B5O8(OH)]2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;[B(OH)3]&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;H2O is the first synthetic phase of veatchite, while the other three polymorphs are found in different natural minerals. This strontium borate is a potential deep&#8208;ultraviolet&#8208;transparent nonlinear&#8208;optical (NLO) crystal whose second&#8208;harmonic&#8208;generation (SHG) intensity is 1.7 times that of KH2PO4 (KDP) and is phase&#8208;matchable. The short wavelength cutoff edge of compound 1 is below 190&#8197;nm. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations show that the B&#8722;O units are responsible for the nonlinear optical property.

         <title>20&#960;&#8208;Electron Antiaromatic Benziphthalocyanines with Absorption Reaching the Near&#8208;Infrared&#8208;II Region</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
20&#960;&#8208;Electron antiaromatic benziphthalocyanines, low symmetry analogues of phthalocyanine, were synthesized by hydrogenation of 18&#960;&#8208;electron benziphthalocyanines. They exhibit intense absorption in the near&#8208;IR (NIR) region despite their antiaromaticity, which is attributed to electric&#8208;dipole&#8208;allowed HOMO&#8208;LUMO transition as a result of symmetry&#8208;lowering. Further structural modification extends the absorption into the second NIR region (reaching 1100&#8197;nm).







Abstract
Although second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II, 1000&#8211;1500&#8197;nm) light has attracted considerable attention, especially for life sciences applications, the development of organic dyes with NIR&#8208;II absorption remains a formidable challenge. Herein we report the design, synthesis, and electronic properties of 20&#960;&#8208;electron antiaromatic benziphthalocyanines (BPcs) that exhibit intense absorption bands in the NIR region. The strong, low&#8208;energy absorption of the antiaromatic BPcs is attributed to electric&#8208;dipole&#8208;allowed HOMO&#8208;LUMO transitions with narrow band gaps, enabled by the reduced structural symmetry of BPc compared with regular porphyrins and phthalocyanines. The combination of peripheral substituents and a central metal decreases the HOMO&#8208;LUMO energy gaps, leading to the extension of the absorption bands into the NIR&#8208;II region (reaching 1100&#8197;nm) under reductive conditions.

         <dc:description>Ruthenium(II)&#8208;catalyzed synthesis of &#960;&#8208;conjugated fused imidazo[1,5&#8208;a]quinolin&#8208;2&#8208;ium derivatives have been achieved via C&#8722;H activation of quinoline&#8208;functionalized NHC (NHC = N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene) and oxidative coupling with internal alkynes. The reaction occurred with high efficiency, broad substrate scope, tolerates a wide range of functional groups and utilized into a gram&#8208;scale. Synthetic applications of a coupled product have been exemplified in the late&#8208;stage derivatization of various highly functionalized scaffolds. Moreover, most of the annulated products exhibit intense fluorescence and have potential applications in optoelectronic devices. Mechanistic studies have provided insights into the spectroscopic characterization of key five&#8208;membered ruthenacycle intermediate and Ru(0) sandwich species. Based on several control experiments, deuterium&#8208;kinetic isotope effect, and thermodynamic activation parameters the mechanistic finding demonstrated that fused imidazo&#8208;[1,5&#8208;a]quinolin&#8208;2&#8208;ium C(2)&#8722;H bond cleavage is the rate&#8208;determining step and ruling out the possibility of reductive elimination for controlling the rate of reaction.</dc:description>

         <title>Luminescent Supramolecular Metallogels: Drug Loading and Eu(III) as Structural Probe</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Supramolecular metallogels combine the rheological properties of gels with the color, magnetism, and other properties of metal ions. Lanthanide ions such as Eu(III) can be valuable components of metallogels due to their fascinating luminescence. In this work, we combine Eu(III) and iminodiacetic acid (IDA) into luminescent hydrogels. We investigate the tailoring of the rheological properties of these gels by changes in their metal:ligand ratio. Further, we use the highly sensitive Eu(III) luminescence to obtain information about the chemical structure of the materials. In special, we take advantage of computational calculations to employ an indirect method for structural elucidation, in which the simulated luminescent properties of candidate structures are matched to the experimental data. With this strategy, we can propose molecular structures for different EuIDA gels. We also explore the usage of these gels for the loading of bioactive molecules such as OXA, observing that its aldose reductase activity remains present in the gel. We envision that the findings from this work could inspire the development of luminescent hydrogels with tunable rheology for applications such as 3D printing and imaging&#8208;guided drug delivery platforms. Finally, Eu(III) emission&#8208;based structural elucidation could be a powerful tool in the characterization of advanced materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly Efficient and Thermally Durable Luminescence of 1D Eu3+ Coordination Polymers with Arsenic Bridging Ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this work, bisarsine oxides were evaluated as novel bridging ligands, aiming to develop practical and efficient luminescent lanthanide coordination polymers. We have synthesized one&#8208;dimensional (1D) Eu3+ coordination polymers that incorporate bisarsine oxide bridging ligands and hexafluoroacetylacetonate anions. These polymers exhibited a denser packing of chains compared to analogous polymers bridged with bisphosphine oxides. The coordination polymers demonstrated exceptional thermal stability and substantial emission quantum yields. Additionally, the bisarsine oxides induced a pronounced polarization effect, facilitating a sensitive electric dipole transition that yields considerably narrow band red emission. Remarkably, the Eu3+ coordination polymers with bisarsine oxides maintained intense emission even at 550 K. A distinctive feature of these polymers is their heating&#8208;induced emission enhancement observed when the temperature was increased from 300 K to 400 K.</dc:description>

         <title>Reactive Magnesium Nanoparticles to Perform Reactions in Suspension</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Zerovalent magnesium (Mg(0)) nanoparticles are prepared in the liquid phase (THF) by reduction of MgBr2 either with lithium naphthalenide ([LiNaph]) or lithium biphenyl ([LiBP]). [LiBP]&#8208;driven reduction results in smaller Mg(0) nanoparticles (10.3&#177;1.7&#160;nm) than [LiNaph]&#8208;driven reduction (28.5&#177;4&#160;nm). The as&#8208;prepared Mg(0) nanoparticles are monocrystalline (d101&#160;=&#160;245&#177;5&#160;pm) for both types of reduction. Their reactivity is probed by liquid&#8208;phase reaction (THF, toluene) in suspension near room temperature (20&#8208;120&#160;&#176;C) with 1&#8208;bromoadamantane (AdBr), chlortriphenylsilane (Ph3SiCl), trichlorphenylsilane (PhSiCl3), 9H&#8208;carbazole (Hcbz), 7&#8208;azaindole (Hai), 1,8&#8208;diaminonaphthalene (H4nda) and N,N&#8242;&#8208;bis(&#945;&#8208;pyridyl)&#8208;2,6&#8208;diaminopyridine (H4tpda) as exemplary starting materials. The reactions result in the formation of 1,1&#8242;&#8208;biadamantane (1), [MgCl2(thf)2]&#215;Ph6Si2 (2), [Mg9(thf)14Cl18] (3), [Mg(cbz)2(thf)3] (4), [Mg4O(ai)6]&#215;1.5&#160;C7H8 (5), [Mg4(H2nda)4(thf)4] (6) and [Mg3(tpda)3] (7) with 40&#8208;80&#160;% yield. 1 and 2 show the reactivity of Mg(0) nanoparticles for C&#8211;C and Si&#8211;Si coupling reactions with sterically demanding starting materials. 3&#8208;7 represent new coordination compounds using sterically demanding N&#8211;H&#8208;acidic amines as starting materials. The formation of multinuclear Mg2+ complexes with multidentate ligands illustrates the potential of the oxidative approach to obtain novel compounds with Mg(0) nanoparticles in the liquid phase.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Inclusion of a heteroatom to the phosphole ring is a promising strategy to intrinsically modulate the optical properties of phosphole derivatives. We report on a series of 2&#8208;aryl&#8208;3H&#8208;1,3&#8208;benzazaphosphole oxides that were efficiently prepared via sequential C&#8211;P cross&#8208;coupling, dehydrative [3 + 2] cycloaddition, and ring&#8208;oxidation reactions.

         <title>Effect of Benzo&#8208;Annelation on Triplet State Energies in Polycyclic Conjugated Hydrocarbons</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We established a quantitative model of the relationship between the structure of conjugated polycyclic hydrocarbons and their triplet state excitation energies E(T1). The proposed model can accurately predict the E(T1) with an average absolute error of less than 0.1&#8197;eV.







Abstract
In a series of earlier studies, the effect of benzo&#8208;annelation was found to be a useful tool for tuning the aromaticity in polycyclic conjugated compounds to desired level. In this work we studied the (anti)aromaticity of benzo&#8208;annelated derivatives of three conjugated hydrocarbons (anthracene, fluoranthene and biphenylene) in their lowest lying singlet (S0) and triplet (T1) states by means of the energy effect (ef), harmonic oscillator model of aromaticity (HOMA), multicentre delocalization indices (MCI), magnetically induced current densities (MICDs) and nucleus independent chemical shifts (NICS). We showed that benzo&#8208;annelation is a topology&#8208;based effect which can be used to modify the T1 state excitation energies (E(T1)). A quantitative model was established being able to accurately predict the E(T1) based only on the numbers of angularly, linearly and geminally annelated benzene rings. In addition, it was demonstrated that the E(T1) can be directly related to the (anti)aromatic character of the central ring in the studied molecules in their S0 state.

         <title>Synthesis and Reactivity of Discrete Europium(II) Hydride Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hyping up Europium: Here we report the first examples of molecular europium&#8197;(II) hydrides, which can be conveniently isolated from the reaction of either symmetrical or unsymmetrical &#946;&#8208;diketiminato europium&#8197;(II) alkyls with 1,4&#8208;cyclohexadiene.







Abstract
The bulky &#946;&#8208;diketiminate ligand frameworks [BDIDCHP]&#8722; and [BDIDipp/Ar]&#8722; (BDI=[HC{C(Me)2N&#8208;Dipp/Ar}2]&#8722; (Dipp=2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl (Dipp); Ar=2,6&#8208;dicyclohexylphyenyl (DCHP) or 2,4,6&#8208;tricyclohexylphyenyl (TCHP)) have been developed for the kinetic stabilisation of the first europium&#8197;(II) hydride complexes, [(BDIDCHP)Eu(&#956;&#8208;H)]2, [(BDIDipp/DCHP)Eu(&#956;&#8208;H)]2 and [(BDIDipp/TCHP)Eu(&#956;&#8208;H)]2, respectively. These complexes represent the first step beyond the current lanthanide(II) hydrides that are all based on ytterbium. Tuning the steric profile of &#946;&#8208;diketiminate ligands from a symmetrical to unsymmetrical disposition, enhanced solubility and stability in the solution&#8211;state. This provides the first opportunity to study the structure and bonding of these novel Eu(II) hydride complexes crystallographically, spectroscopically and computationally, with their preliminary reactivity investigated.

         <title>Synthesis, Reactivity, and Complexation with Fe(0) of a Tight&#8208;bite Bis(N&#8208;heterocyclic silylene)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This paper describes the unique reactions of a tight&#8208;bite bis(NHSi) with p&#8208;toluidine and Fe(CO)5. With p&#8208;toluidine, it resulted in the oxidative addition of both N&#8722;H bonds across two Si(II) atoms to afford cyclodisilazane, whereas with Fe(CO)5 a four&#8208;membered NSi2Fe2 ring with a Fe&#8722;Fe bond of 2.6892(13) &#197; is formed.







Abstract
The synthesis, reactivity, and complexation with Fe(0) precursor of a tight&#8208;bite bis(N&#8208;heterocyclic silylene) (bis(NHSi)) ligand 1 are reported. The reaction of 1 with p&#8208;toluidine led to the activation of both N&#8722;H bonds across Si(II) atoms to afford a four&#8208;membered heterocyclic cyclodisilazane 2, with hydride substituents attached to five&#8208;coordinate Si atoms. A 1&#8201;:&#8201;2 reaction of 1 with Fe(CO)5 led to an intriguing dinuclear complex 3 featuring a five&#8208;membered (N&#8722;Si&#8722;Fe&#8722;Fe&#8722;Si) ring with a Fe&#8722;Fe bond distance of 2.6892(13) &#197;. All compounds (1&#8208;3) were thoroughly characterized by various spectroscopic methods and X&#8208;ray diffraction studies conclusively established their molecular structures. DFT calculations were carried out to shed light on bonding and energetic aspects in 1&#8211;3.

         <title>Unrevealing the Nitrogen Elusive Chirality of 3&#8208;Sulfanyl and 3&#8208;Sulfinyl N&#8208;Tosyl Isoindolinones by ECD Spectra: an Experimental and Theoretical Investigation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A combined theoretical&#8211;experimental strategy revealed the chiral, configurationally stable nature of solvated tricoordinate N&#8208;lactams of the title compounds, offering reliable insights into their chiroptical properties.







Abstract
The nitrogen&#8211;hybridization/pyramidalization of two solvated N&#8208;tosylisoindolinone derivatives having chiral residues in adjacent&#8197;(I) or adjacent and distal (II) position has been investigated by a theoretical&#8208;computational procedure based on Molecular Dynamics simulations and Quantum&#8211;Chemical calculations. After validation of our methodology in providing a reliable repertory of conformations by modeling the electronic circular dichroism (EDC) spectra, the electronic features associated with N&#8208;pyramidalization were further characterized through Natural Bond Order (NBO) analysis. Comparing against the N&#8208;geometry observed in crystal structures as a reference, our findings reveal that the presence of neighbouring chiral centers induces a more pronounced N&#8208;pyramidalization in solution than in the solid state, both in I and II. Furthermore, NBO analysis confirms that the N&#8208;lactam mostly retains the sp2 character but exhibits slight configurational distortion (&#958;I=13&#176;; &#958;II=21&#176;), which significantly influences the chiroptical activities observed in ECD spectra of I and II. This substantiates the N&#8208;lactams as configurationally stable chiral centers.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Free Selective Synthesis of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;Unsaturated Aldehydes from Alkenes and Formaldehyde Catalyzed by Dimethylamine</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report here a selective and metal&#8208;free pathway to &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated aldehydes from cheap alkenes and formaldehyde. The reaction occurs at 30&#8211;50&#8201;&#176;C and only releases water as a by&#8208;product. Through a combined theoretical&#8208;experimental study, we discovered that this reaction could be advantageously catalyzed by dimethylamine.







Abstract
&#945;,&#946;&#8208;Unsaturated aldehydes are important building blocks for the synthesis of a wide range of chemicals, including polymers. The synthesis of these molecules from cheap feedstocks such as alkenes remains a scientific challenge, mainly due to the low reactivity of alkenes. Here we report a selective and metal&#8208;free access to &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated aldehydes from alkenes with formaldehyde. This reaction is catalyzed by dimethylamine and affords &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated aldehydes in yields of up to 80&#8201;%. By combining Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations and experiments, we elucidate the reaction mechanism which is based on a cascade of hydride transfer, hydrolysis and aldolization reactions. The reaction can be performed under very mild conditions (30&#8211;50&#8201;&#176;C), in a theoretically 100&#8201;% carbon&#8208;economical fashion, with water as the only by&#8208;product. The reaction was successfully applied to non&#8208;activated linear 1&#8208;alkenes, thus opening an access to industrially relevant &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated aldehydes from cheap and widely abundant chemicals at large scale.

         <title>Cross&#8208;coupling between Aryl Halides and&#160;Aryl Alkynes Catalyzed by an Odd Alternant Hydrocarbon</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Catalytic cross&#8208;coupling between aryl halides and alkynes is considered an extremely important organic transformation (popularly known as the Sonogashira coupling) and it requires a transition metal&#8208;based catalyst. Accomplishing such transformation without any transition metal&#8208;based catalyst in the absence of any external stimuli such as heat, photoexcitation or cathodic current is extremely challenging.&#160;&#160;This work reports transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free cross&#8208;coupling between aryl halides and alkynes synthesizing a rich library of internal alkynes without any external stimuli. A chemically double&#8208;reduced phenalenyl (PLY)&#8208;based molecule with the super&#8208;reducing property was employed for single electron transfer to activate aryl halides generating reactive aryl radicals, which subsequently react with alkyne. This protocol covers not only various types of aryl, heteroaryl and polyaryl halides but also applies to a large variety of aromatic alkynes at room temperature. With a versatile substrate scope successfully tested on more than 75 entries, this radical&#8208;mediated pathway has been explained by several control experiments. All the key reactive intermediates have been characterized with spectroscopic evidence. Detailed DFT calculations have been instrumental in portraying the mechanistic pathway. Furthermore, we have successfully extended this transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free catalytic strategy for the first time towards solvent&#8208;free cross&#8208;coupling between solid aryl halide and alkyne substrates.</dc:description>

         <title>Strategies for using Quaternary Ammonium Salts as Alternative Reagents in Alkylations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Alkylation reactions are pivotal in organic chemistry, with wide&#8208;ranging utilization across various fields of applied synthetic chemistry. However, conventional reagents employed in alkylations often pose substantial health and exposure risks. Quaternary ammonium salts (QAS) present a promising alternative for these transformations offering significantly reduced hazards as they are non&#8208;cancerogenic, non&#8208;mutagenic, non&#8208;flammable, and non&#8208;corrosive. Despite their potential, their use in direct organic transformations remains relatively unexplored. This review outlines strategies for utilizing QAS as alternative reagents in alkylation reactions, providing researchers with safer approaches to chemical synthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>Influence of Lattice Defects on trans&#8208;Oligoene Substructure Formation in Graphene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The photochemical reaction of iodine and graphene induces strong new Raman modes due to the formation of trans&#8208;oligoene substructures in graphene domains. This unique reactivity was demonstrated before on defect&#8208;free graphene, however leaving the influence of e.g. carbon vacancies, unexplored. Here, we investigate the photochemical reaction applied on graphene with varying average distances of lattice defects and statistically analyze the characteristic Raman modes which develop with the iodination reaction. We show that the iodination reaction does not lead to Raman&#8208;active defects and thus, the newly formed trans&#8208;oligoene substructures do not contribute to the D&#8208;mode of graphene. A statistical analysis reveals the correlation between the average distance of lattice defects and the intensity of the v1&#8208;mode. For defective graphene with average defect distances below ~1 nm no new Raman modes evolve, which is the lower limit of the substructure size probed at 532 nm and explains why this observation was not possible before using common graphene oxide as graphene source.</dc:description>

         <title>Structure&#8208;Based Design and Synthesis of Lipid A Derivatives to Modulate Cytokine Responses</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Agonists of Toll like receptors (TLRs) have attracted interest as adjuvants and immune modulators. A crystal structure of TLR4/MD2 with E. coli LPS indicates that the fatty acid at C&#8208;2 of the lipid A component of LPS induces dimerization of two TLR4&#8208;MD2 complexes, which in turn initiates cell signaling leading to the production of (pro)inflammatory cytokines. To probe the importance of the (R)&#8208;3&#8208;hydroxymyristate at C&#8208;2 of lipid A, a range of bis&#8208; and mono&#8208;phosphoryl lipid A derivatives with different modifications at C&#8208;2 were prepared by a strategy in which 2&#8208;methylnaphthyl ethers were employed as permanent protecting group that could be readily removed by catalytic hydrogenation. The C&#8208;2 amine was protected as 9&#8208;fluorenylmethyloxycarbamate, which at a later stage could be removed to give a free amine that was modified by different fatty acids. LPS and the synthetic lipid As induced the same cytokines, however, large differences in activity were observed. A compound having a hexanoyl moiety at C&#8208;2 still showed agonistic properties, but further shortening to a butanoyl abolished activity. The modifications had a larger influence on monophosphoryl lipid As. The lipid As having a butanoyl moiety at C&#8208;2 could selectively antagonize TRIF associated cytokines induced by LPS or lipid A.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>A de novo asymmetric strategy for the synthesis of d&#8208;bradyrhizose diastereomers from an achiral ketoenolester precursor is described. Key transformations used in the stereodivergent approach include two Noyori asymmetric reductions, an Achmatowicz rearrangement, diastereoselective alkene oxidations, and the first example of a palladium(0)&#8208;catalyzed glycosylation of a vinylogous pyranone. The isomeric composition of the bicyclic reducing sugars obtained was analyzed and their behaviour was compared to the natural product, revealing key stereocentres that impact the overall distribution.</dc:description>

         <title>Extended Reichardt&#8217;s Dye &#8211; Synthesis and Solvatochromic Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Three new pyridinium&#8208;phenolate dyes based on the benchmark solvatochromic dye Betaine 30 were synthesised. The dyes contained phenylene spacers between the donor and acceptor groups. Their UV&#8208;Vis absorption spectra were measured, with the dyes showing strong negative solvatochromic behaviour comparable to that of Betaine 30. These results stood in contrast to the behaviour of the &#960;&#8208;extended dye Betaine 21, originally reported in 1963. This dye was synthesised and found to be significantly more solvatochromic than previously reported but prone to degrade. All &#960;&#8208;extended dyes synthesised were found to be unstable in certain solvents. Although the increased distance between donor and acceptor did not enhance solvatochromism to the extent predicted, it was still determined that the reduced planarity caused by a phenylene spacer is not as detrimental as believed.</dc:description>

         <title>Hypervalent Iodine(III) Mediated Halogen Bonded Supramolecular Chiral System with Cholesteryl Naphthalimides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Halogen bonding acknowledged as a noteworthy weak interaction, has gained growing recognition in the field of supramolecular chemistry. In this study, we selected structurally rigid diaryliodonium ions (I(III)) with two biaxial &#963;&#8208;holes as halogen&#8208;bond donors, to bind with three chiral acceptor molecules bearing cholesteryl and naphthalimides with distinct geometries. The abundant carbonyl oxygen atoms in side&#8208;arm substituents function as multiple acceptors for halogen bonding. The self&#8208;aggregation of chiral acceptor molecules demonstrates adaptiveness to solvent media, evidenced by the inversion of the Cotton effect and the morphological evolution from spherical to rod&#8208;like nanoarchitectures in different solvent systems. The distinct geometries of the acceptor molecules conferred various binding modes with I(III). The introduction of I(III) as a halogen&#8208;bond donor regulates the aggregation of the donors, achieving amplification of chiroptical signals and inheriting solvent responsiveness from the self&#8208;aggregated assembly. This study successfully utilized rational structural design and multimodal control strategies to achieve regulation of supramolecular chirality.</dc:description>

         <title>Construction of Supramolecular Polymers and Covalent Polymers via the Same Monomers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nature owns the ability to construct structurally different polymers from the same monomers. While polymers can be classified as covalent polymers (CPs) and supramolecular polymers (SPs), it is still difficult to synthesize CPs and SPs using same monomers like nature do. Herein, M1 with two diazo salts on both the ends was designed. Additionally, hydroquinone was chosen to be M2 for the existence of two hydroxyl groups. When mixing at room temperature, M1 and M2 self&#8208;assembled to SPs via N&#8230;H hydrogen bonds. In another way, upon the exposure to ultraviolet irradiation when blending M1 with M2, CPs were fabricated in the presence of covalent bonds. The excellent thermal stability of CPs was determined by TGA and DSC, while the great corrosion resistance of covalent polymers was detected by acid or alkali immersion. In this way, constructing two kinds of polymers using the same monomers was successfully achieved. This shows tremendous potential in fields of polymer science, supramolecular chemistry, which would boom the development of polymers.</dc:description>

         <title>Kinetic Trapping of an Out&#8208;of&#8208;Equilibrium Dynamic Library of Imines by Changing Solvent</title>

         <title>Indole C5&#8208;Selective Bromination of Indolo[2,3&#8208;a]quinolizidine Alkaloids via In Situ&#8208;Generated Indoline Intermediate</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>There are many indole alkaloids that contain diverse functional groups attached to the benzene ring on the indole core. Promising biological activities of these alkaloids have been reported. Herein, we report the indole C5&#8208;selective bromination of indolo[2,3&#8208;a]quinolizidine alkaloids by adding nearly equimolar amounts of Br3&#183;PyH and HCl in MeOH. The resulting reaction plausibly proceeds through an indoline intermediate by the nucleophilic addition of MeOH to the C3&#8208;brominated indolenine intermediate. Data support the intermediacy of a C3&#8208;, C5&#8208;dibrominated indolenine intermediate as a brominating agent. These conditions demonstrate excellent selectivity for indole C5 bromination of natural products and their derivatives. Thus, these simple, mild, and metal&#8208;free conditions allow for selective, late&#8208;stage bromination followed by further chemical modifications. The utility of the brominated product prepared from naturally occurring yohimbine was demonstrated through various derivatizations, including a bioinspired heterodimerization reaction.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly Efficient Thiolate&#8208;Based Ionic Liquid Catalysts for Reduction of CO2: Selective N&#8208;Functionalization of Amines to Form Formamides and Methylamines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing efficient catalysts to convert CO2 into value&#8208;added chemicals is valuable for reducing carbon emissions. Herein, a kind of novel thiolate&#8208;based ionic liquid&#160;with sulfur as the active site was designed and synthesized, which served as highly efficient catalyst for the reductive functionalization of CO2 by amines and hydrosilane. By adjusting the CO2 pressure, various formamides and methylamines were selectively obtained in high yields. Remarkably, at the catalyst loading of 0.1 mol%, the N&#8208;formylation reaction of N&#8208;methylaniline exhibited an impressive turnover frequency (TOF) up to 600 h&#8208;1. This IL catalyst displayed the highest activity compared to the reported non&#8208;transition&#8208;metal catalysts, which could be attributed to the multiple roles of the IL in activating hydrosilane, amine and CO2. In addition, control experiments and NMR monitoring experiments provided evidence that the reduction of CO2 by hydrosilane yielded formoxysilane intermediates that subsequently reacted with amines to form N&#8208;formylated products. Alternatively, the formoxysilane intermediates could further react with hydrosilane and amine to produce 4&#8208;electron&#8208;reduced aminal products. These aminal products served as crucial intermediates in the N&#8208;methylation reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Leveraging Pyrazolium Ylide Reactivity to Access Indolizine and 1,2&#8208;Dihydropyrimidine Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mild, transition metal&#8208;free method to synthesize indolizines and 1,2&#8208;dihydropyrimidines from pyrazolium ylides is presented. The reaction of pyrazolium ylides with alkynes follows an N&#8208;deletion mechanism to afford indolizines, while reaction with isocyanates follows a rearrangement into a 1,2&#8208;dihydropyrimidine.







Abstract
N&#8208;Heterocyclic ylides are important synthetic precursors to rapidly build molecular complexity. Pyrazolium ylides have largely been unexplored, and we demonstrate their diverse utility in this report. We show that these readily accessible building blocks can be used to construct different heterocyclic skeletons by varying the coupling partner. Indolizines can be formed via an N&#8208;deletion type mechanism when reacting pyrazolium salts with electron deficient alkynes. 1,2&#8208;Dihydropyrimidines can be formed via a rearrangement mechanism when reacting pyrazolium ylides with isocyanates. These reactions enable access to valuable heteroarenes without the need for transition metal catalysis, high temperatures, or strong bases.

         <title>Design of New Bis(1,2,3&#8208;triazol&#8208;1&#8208;yl)methane&#8208;Based Nitrogen Ligands: Synthesis and Coordination Chemistry</title>

         <dc:description>
The synthesis of new alcohol neutral ligand precursors based on bis(1,2,3&#8208;triazol&#8208;1&#8208;yl)methane moieties is reported. A substrate&#8208;dependent functionalization is observed allowing access to a variety of ligand precursors. The coordination chemistry of some of them against aluminum and zinc have also been investigated.







Abstract
The reaction between bis(1,2,3&#8208;triazol&#8208;1&#8208;yl)methane derivatives and nBuLi and various aldehydes, yielded novel neutral ligand precursors incorporating alcohol functional groups. The resulting compounds exhibited distinct characteristics depending on the steric hindrance of the aldehyde employed. In instances where aromatic aldehydes were utilized, functionalization occurred at the methine group bridging both triazole rings. Conversely, the use of pivalic aldehyde prompted functionalization at the C5 position of the triazole ring. These compounds were subsequently employed as ligand precursors in the synthesis of organometallic aluminum and zinc complexes, yielding dinuclear complexes with high efficiency. The structural elucidation of all compounds was accomplished through spectroscopic methods and validated by X&#8208;ray crystallography. Preliminary catalytic investigations into the coupling reaction of cyclohexene oxide and CO2 revealed that aluminum and zinc complexes catalyzed the selective formation of polyether and polycarbonate materials, respectively.

         <title>Amino&#8208; and Alkoxybenziodoxoles: Facile Preparation and Use as Arynophiles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A diverse array of amino&#8208; and alkoxybenziodoxoles can be easily synthesized by reacting the respective amines and alcohols with chlorobenziodoxole. These iodane compounds undergo insertion of arynes into the N&#8722;I(III) and O&#8722;I(III) bonds to give ortho&#8208;amino&#8208; and alkoxy&#8208;arylbenziodoxoles, the iodane group of which can be leveraged as a versatile leaving group for downstream transformations.







Abstract
We report here on the facile synthesis of amino&#8208; and alkoxy&#8208;&#955;3&#8208;iodanes supported by a benziodoxole (BX) template and their use as arynophiles. The amino&#8208; and alkoxy&#8208;BX derivatives can be readily synthesized by reacting the respective amines or alcohols with chlorobenziodoxole in the presence of a suitable base. Unlike previously known nitrogen&#8208; and oxygen&#8208;bound iodane compounds, which have primarily been employed as electrophilic group transfer agents or oxidants, the present amino&#8208; and alkoxy&#8208;BX reagents manifest themselves as nucleophilic amino and alkoxy transfer agents toward arynes. This reactivity leads to the aryne insertion into the N&#8722;I(III) or O&#8722;I(III) bond to afford ortho&#8208;amino&#8208; and ortho&#8208;alkoxy&#8208;arylbenziodoxoles, iodane compounds nontrivial to procure by existing methods. The BX group in these insertion products exhibits excellent leaving group ability, enabling diverse downstream transformations.

         <dc:description>
A stereoselective intramolecular bicyclization reaction of sulfonamides via intramolecular Mannich and aza&#8208;Michael addition cascade which is an efficient, simple and practical method for the synthesis of bicyclic &#947;&#8208;ureasultams.







Abstract
A novel approach has been developed for the synthesis of bicyclic &#946;, &#947;&#8208;fused bicyclic &#947;&#8208;ureasultams containing two consecutive chiral centers through an intramolecular Mannich and aza&#8208;Michael addition cascade of alkenyl sulfamides. The straightforward practical procedure and readily available starting materials enable the synthesis of variously substituted ureasultams. In addition, bicyclic &#947;&#8208;ureasultams is a class of potential biotin analogues.

         <title>Endowing Metal&#8208;Organic Coordination Materials with Chiroptical Activity by a Chiral Anion Strategy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Taking advantage of the chirality transfer from chiral anions to cationic coordination components, efficient circular dichroism and circularly polarized luminescence properties are realized. Such a chiral anion strategy is successfully implemented in ionic small&#8208;molecular metal complexes, metal clusters, coordination supramolecular assemblies, and metal&#8208;organic frameworks. The chiroptical properties can be modulated by the use of different chiral anions.







Abstract
Recently, chiral metal&#8208;organic coordination materials have emerged as promising candidates for a wide range of applications in chiroptoelectronics, chiral catalysis, and information encryption, etc. Notably, the chiroptical effect of coordination chromophores makes them appealing for applications such as photodetectors, OLEDs, 3D displays, and bioimaging. The direct synthesis of chiral coordination materials using chiral organic ligands or complexes with metal&#8208;centered chirality is very often tedious and costly. In the case of ionic coordination materials, the combination of chiral anions with cationic, achiral coordination compounds through noncovalent interactions may endow molecular materials with desirable chiroptical properties. The use of such a simple chiral strategy has been proven effective in inducing promising circular dichroism and/or circularly polarized luminescence signals. This concept article mainly delves into the latest advances in exploring the efficacy of such a chiral anion strategy for transforming achiral coordination materials into chromophores with superb photo&#8208; or electro&#8208;chiroptical properties. In particular, ionic small&#8208;molecular metal complexes, metal clusters, coordination supramolecular assemblies, and metal&#8208;organic frameworks containing chiral anions are discussed. A perspective on the future opportunities on the preparation of chiroptical materials with the chiral anion strategy is also presented.

         <title>A GFP Inspired 8&#8208;Methoxyquinoline&#8211;Derived Fluorescent Molecular Sensor for the Detection of Zn2+ by Two&#8211;Photon Microscopy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
New zinc sensor with 8&#8208;methoxyquinoline moiety inspired by the green fluorescent protein chromophore was synthesized and characterized. The in&#8197;vitro validation of the novel probe with two&#8211;photon microscopy was carried out successfully.







Abstract
An effective, GFP&#8208;inspired fluorescent Zn2+ sensor is developed for two&#8211;photon microscopy and related biological application that features an 8&#8208;methoxyquinoline moiety. Excellent photophysical characteristics including a 37&#8208;fold fluorescence enhancement with excitation and emission maxima at 440&#8197;nm and 505&#8197;nm, respectively, as well as a high two&#8211;photon cross&#8211;section of 73&#8197;GM at 880&#8197;nm are reported. Based on the experimental data, the relationship between the structure and properties was elucidated and explained backed up by DFT calculations, particularly the observed PeT phenomenon for the turn&#8211;on process. Biological validation and detailed experimental and theoretical characterization of the free and the zinc&#8211;bound compounds are presented.

         <title>Unraveling Polymorphism Dependent Cytotoxicity, Cellular Uptake, and Live Cell Imaging Using Luminescent Polymorphs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polymorphism&#8208;dependent cytotoxicity and cellular uptake of drug molecules have been studied for the past two decades. However, visualizing the polymorph&#8208;dependent cellular uptake and cytotoxicity using microscopy imaging technique has not been reported yet. The luminescent polymorph is an ideal candidate to validate the above hypothesis. Herein, we report the polymorph&#8208;dependent cellular uptake, cytotoxicity, and bio&#8208;imaging functions of polymorphs 1Y and 1R of a naphthalimide&#8208;phenothiazine dyad. These polymorphs show different luminescence colors in the solid state and exhibit aggregation&#8208;induced enhanced emission (AIEE) in the DMSO&#8208;Water mixture. Bioimaging, cytotoxicity assay, and fluorescence&#8208;activated cell sorting (FACS) studies revealed that these polymorphs show different levels of cytotoxicity, cellular uptake, localization, and imaging potential. Detailed photophysical, morphological, and biological studies revealed that the difference in molecular conformation in these polymorphs enables them to form aggregates of different sizes and morphology, which leads to the differential uptake of these into the cells and consequently shows different cytotoxicity and imaging potentials.</dc:description>

         <title>Strategies to Design Chemocatalytic Racemization of Tertiary Alcohols: State of the Art &amp; Utilization for Dynamic Kinetic Resolution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this "Concepts"&#8208;article, the difficulties in racemizing tertiary alcohols are described as well as a summary of the different chemocatalytic concepts to overcome these hurdles and to pave a way for efficiently racemizing of tertiary alcohols. When combined with the enantioselective enzymatic esterification of tertiary alcohols, the racemization protocols enable a DKR to convert the racemates into enantiomerically pure esters of tertiary alcohols, which are of high interest in the field of pharmaceutically active products. Very recently, various research groups have succeeded in solving the challenging task of identifying suitable chemocatalysts for an efficient racemization of tertiary alcohols and simultaneously suppressing unwanted dehydration side&#8208;reactions. It is noteworthy that such methods are based on different, complementary catalysis concepts. Besides Br&#248;nsted acids, oxovanadium catalysts as well as piperidine as a representative of an organocatalyst have been found to be useful for the racemization of each type of alcohols. The latter two types of catalysts also turned out to be compatible with lipase&#8208;catalyzed kinetic resolution, thus leading to the first two examples of a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept for chemoenzymatic DKR of tertiary alcohols.</dc:description>

         <title>Coordination of a Phosphine&#8208;Tethered Aminoborane to Group 10 Metals</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>While &#960;&#8208;complexes of C=C bonds are ubiquitous in organometallic chemistry, analogous complexes of the isoelectronic but strongly polarized B=N double bond of aminoboranes are extremely scarce. To address this gap, a diphosphine&#8208;aminoborane ligand (PhDPBAiPr) is introduced and its coordination with group 10 metals is investigated. The B=N bond does not coordinate to the metal in Pt(0) and Pd(II) complexes. In contrast, side&#8208;on coordination of the B=N bond is observed in the Ni(0) complex [PhDPBAiPr]Ni(NCPh), and the X&#8208;ray crystal structure reveals B&#8212;N bond elongation compared to the free ligand. The choice of co&#8208;ligand strongly influences the presence or absence of side&#8208;on coordination at Ni(0) as evidenced by NMR spectroscopy. While the B=N &#960;&#8208;complex is geometrically similar to C=C analogues, a bonding analysis reveals that the interaction of the B=N motif with the electron&#8208;rich Ni(0) center is best described as 3c4e hyperbond, in which Ni and N are competing for the empty orbital on B.</dc:description>

While the B=N &#960;-complex is geometrically similar to C=C analogues, a bonding analysis reveals that the interaction of the B=N motif with the electron-rich Ni(0) center is best described as 3c4e hyperbond, in which Ni and N are competing for the empty orbital on B.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Control of Kinetic Pathways toward Supramolecular Chiral Polymorphs for Tunable Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An amphiphilic aza&#8208;BODIPY dye (S)&#8208;1 bearing two chiral hydrophilic side chains with S&#8208;stereogenic centers was synthesized. This dye exhibited kinetic&#8208;controlled self&#8208;assembly pathways and supramolecular chiral polymorphism properties in MeOH/H2O (9/1, v/v) mixed solvent. The (S)&#8208;1 monomers first aggregated into a kinetic controlled, off&#8208;pathway species Agg. A, which was spontaneously transformed into an on&#8208;pathway metastable aggregate (Agg. B) and subsequently into the thermodynamic Agg. C. The three aggregate polymorphs of dye (S)&#8208;1 displayed distinct optical properties and nanomorphologies. In particular, chiral J&#8208;aggregation characteristics were observed for both Agg. B and Agg. C, such as Davydov&#8208;split absorption bands (Agg. B), extremely sharp and intense J&#8208;band with large bathochromic shift (Agg. C), non&#8208;diminished fluorescence upon aggregation, as well as strong bisignated Cotton effects. Moreover, the AFM and TEM studies revealed that Agg. A had the morphology of nanoparticle while fibril or rod&#8208;like helical nanostructures with left&#8208;handedness were observed respectively for Agg. B and Agg. C. By controlling the kinetic transformation process from Agg. B to Agg. C, thin films consisting of Agg. B and Agg. C with different ratios were prepared, which displayed tunable CPL with emission maxima at 788 &#8208; 805 nm and g&#8211;factors between &#8211;4.2 &#215; 10&#8211;2 and &#8211;5.1 &#215; 10&#8211;2.</dc:description>

         <title>Engineered Nanomaterials for Tumor Immune Microenvironment Modulation in Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Tumor immunotherapy, represented by immune checkpoint blocking and chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy, has achieved promising resutls in clinical applications. However, it faces challenges that hinder its further development, such as limited response rates and poor tumor permeability. The efficiency of tumor immunotherapy is also closely linked to the structure and function of the immune microenvironment where the tumor resides. Recently, nanoparticle&#8208;based tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) modulation strategies have attracted a great deal of attention in cancer immunotherapy. This is primarily due to the distinctive physical characteristics of nanoparticles, which enable them to effectively infiltrate the TIME and selectively modulate its key constituents. This paper reviews recent advances in nanoparticle engineering to improve anti&#8208;cancer immunotherapy. Emerging nanoparticle&#8208;based approaches for modulating immune cells, tumor stroma, cytokines and immune checkpoints are discussed, aiming to overcome current challenges in the clinic. In addition, integrating immunotherapy with various treatment modalities such as chemotherapy and photodynamic therapy can be facilitated through the utilization of nanoparticles, thereby enhancing the efficacy of cancer treatment. The future challenges and opportunities of using nanomaterials to reeducate the suppressive immune microenvironment of tumors are also discussed, with the aim of anticipating further advancements in this growing field.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Optically active poly(naphthalene&#8208;1,4&#8208;diyl) was prepared through helix&#8208;sense&#8208;selective polymerization of the corresponding monomers and also through circularly polarized light (CPL) irradiation, resulting in distinctive circular dichroism (CD) spectral patterns. Chirality of the helix&#8208;sense&#8208;selective polymerization &#8208;based polymer is ascribed to preferred&#8208;handed helicity while that of the CPL&#8208;based polymer to a non&#8208;helical, chiral conformation (&#8216;biased&#8208;dihedral conformation&#8217;) with preferred&#8208;handedness which was stable only in the solid state. The helix of the helix&#8208;sense&#8208;selective polymerization&#8208;based polymer gradually racemized in tetrahydrofuran while it was stabilized by aggregate formation in a hexane&#8208;dichloromethane solution.

         <title>Elucidation of Design Criteria for V&#8208;based Redox Mediators: Structure&#8208;Function Relationships that Dictate Rates of Heterogeneous Electron Transfer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Redox mediators are attractive solutions for addressing the stringent kinetic stipulations required for efficient energy conversion processes. In this work, we compare the electrochemical properties of four vanadium complexes, namely [V(acac)3], [V6O7(OMe)12], [nBu4N]3[V6O13(TRISNO2)2], and [nBu4N]5[V18O46(NO3)] in non&#8208;aqueous solutions on glassy carbon electrodes. The goal of this study is to investigate the electron transfer kinetics and diffusivity of these compounds under identical experimental conditions to develop an understanding of structure&#8208;function relationships that dictate the physicochemical properties of vanadium oxide assemblies. Complex selection was dictated by two criteria &#8211; (1) nuclearity of the transition metal complexes (2) distribution of electron density in the native electronic configuration. Our analyses establish that electronic communication between metal centers significantly impacts charge transfer kinetics of these vanadium&#8208;based compounds.</dc:description>

         <title>Dinuclear Rhenium(I) Tricarbonyl Complexes as Anticancer Drug Candidates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cancer is one of the deadliest diseases worldwide. Chemotherapy remains one of the most dominant forms for anticancer treatment. Despite their clinical success, the used chemotherapeutic agents are associated with severe side effect and pharmacological limitations. To overcome these drawbacks there is a need for the development of new types of chemotherapeutic agents. Herein, the chemical synthesis and biological evaluation of dinuclear rhenium(I) complexes as potential chemotherapeutic drug candidates are proposed. The metal complexes were found to be internalized by an energy dependent endocytosis pathway, primary accumulating in the mitochondria. The rhenium(I) complexes demonstrated to induce cell death against a variety of cancer cells in the micromolar range through apoptosis. The lead compound showed to eradicate a pancreatic carcinoma multicellular tumor spheroid at micromolar concentrations.</dc:description>

         <title>Regulation Strategies on Fe&#8208;N&#8208;C and Co&#8208;N&#8208;C Catalysts for Oxygen Reduction Reaction: A Review</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) and alkaline membrane fuel cells (AEMFCs) have received great attention as the energy device of next generation. Accelerating oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) kinetics is the key to improve PEMFCs and AEMFCs performance. Platinum&#8208;based catalysts are the most widely used catalysts for ORR, but their high price and low abundance limit the commercialization of fuel cell. Non&#8208;noble metal&#8208;nitrogen&#8208;carbon (M&#8208;N&#8208;C) is considered to be the most likely material to replace Pt&#8208;based catalysts, among which Fe&#8208;N&#8208;C and Co&#8208;N&#8208;C have been widely studied due to their excellent intrinsic ORR performance and have made great progress in the past decades. With the improvement of synthesis technology and deepening understanding of the ORR mechanism, some reported Fe&#8208;N&#8208;C and Co&#8208;N&#8208;C catalysts have shown excellent ORR activity close to that of commercial Pt/C catalysts. Inspired by the progress, regulation strategies on Fe&#8208;N&#8208;C or Co&#8208;N&#8208;C catalysts are summarized in this review from 5 aspects: (1) coordinated atoms, (2) environmental heteroatoms and defects, (3) dual&#8208;metal active sites, (4) metal&#8208;based particle promoter and (5) curved carbon layer. Next, we make our own suggestions on some challenges facing Fe&#8208;N&#8208;C and Co&#8208;N&#8208;C research.</dc:description>

         <title>Superalkalis with Hydrogen as Central Electronegative Atom and their Possible Applications: Ab Initio and DFT Study</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Superalkalis having hydrogen as central electronegative core are designed. They exhibit very low ionization energies even lower than that of cesium. The superalkalis are capable of reducing molecules having very low electron affinities. They can act as the building blocks of supersalts and also show remarkable non&#8208;linear optical property.







Abstract
Superalkalis are unusual species having ionization energies lower than that of the alkali metals. These species with various applications are of great importance in chemistry due to their low ionization energies and strong reducing property. A typical superalkali contains a central electronegative core decorated with excess metal ligands. In the quest for novel superalkalis, we have designed the superalkalis HLi2, HLiNa and HNa2 using hydrogen as central electronegative atom for the first time employing high level ab initio (CCSD(T), MP2) and density functional theory (&#969;B97X&#8208;D) methods. The superalkalis exhibit very low ionization energies, even lower than that of cesium. Stability of these species is verified from binding energy and dissociation energy values. The superalkalis are capable of reducing SO2, NO, CO2, CO and N2 molecules by forming stable ionic complexes and therefore can be used as catalysts for the reduction or activation of systems possessing very low electron affinities. The superalkalis form stable supersalts with tailored properties when interact with a superhalogen. They also show remarkably high non&#8208;linear optical responses, hence could have industrial applications. It is hoped that this work will enrich the superalkali family and spur further theoretical and experimental research in this direction.

         <title>Roles of Oxygen&#8208;Containing Functional Groups in Carbon for Electrocatalytic Two&#8208;Electron Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Oxygen&#8208;containing functional groups (OFGs) are crucial in carbon&#8208;based electrocatalysts for the two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction which enables the flexible synthesis of H2O2. Herein, the construction strategies and the specific roles of OFGs are reviewed, aiming to provide inspirations for the future development of advanced carbon&#8208;based electrocatalysts for H2O2 production.







Abstract
Recent years have witnessed great research interests in developing high&#8208;performance electrocatalysts for the two&#8208;electron (2e&#8722;) oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) that enables the sustainable and flexible synthesis of H2O2. Carbon&#8208;based electrocatalysts exhibit attractive catalytic performance for the 2e&#8722; ORR, where oxygen&#8208;containing functional groups (OFGs) play a decisive role. However, current understanding is far from adequate, and the contribution of OFGs to the catalytic performance remains controversial. Therefore, a critical overview on OFGs in carbon&#8208;based electrocatalysts toward the 2e&#8722; ORR is highly desirable. Herein, we go over the methods for constructing OFGs in carbon including chemical oxidation, electrochemical oxidation, and precursor inheritance. Then we review the roles of OFGs in activating carbon toward the 2e&#8722; ORR, focusing on the intrinsic activity of different OFGs and the interplay between OFGs and metal species or defects. At last, we discuss the reasons for inconsistencies among different studies, and personal perspectives on the future development in this field are provided. The results provide insights into the origin of high catalytic activity and selectivity of carbon&#8208;based electrocatalysts toward the 2e&#8722; ORR and would provide theoretical foundations for the future development in this field.

         <title>Suppressing Cis/Trans &#8216;Ring&#8208;Flipping&#8217; in Organoaluminium(III)&#8208;2&#8208;Pyridyl Dimers&#8211;Design Strategies Towards Lewis Acid Catalysts for Alkene Oligomerisation</title>

         <dc:description>
Controlling the cis/trans isomerism of the dimers [R2Al(&#956;&#8208;2&#8208;py&#8217;)]2 is the key to the development of co&#8208;operative cationic Al(III) catalysts that may offer stereo&#8208;control of alkene insertion during polymerization, in a similar way to established Zr(IV)&#8208;based systems. Substitution at the 6&#8208;position of the 2&#8208;py&#8217; groups favors the desired C2&#8208;symmetric trans isomer and the stability of the cations [{RAl(2&#8208;py&#8217;)}2(&#956;&#8208;Me)]+ formed by demethylation.







Abstract
Owing to its high natural abundance compared to the commonly used transition (precious) metals, as well as its high Lewis acidity and ability to change oxidation state, aluminium has recently been explored as the basis for a range of single&#8208;site catalysts. This paper aims to establish the ground rules for the development of a new type of cationic alkene oligomerisation catalyst containing two Al(III) ions, with the potential to act co&#8208;operatively in stereoselective assembly. Five new dimers of the type [R2Al(2&#8208;py&#8242;)]2 (R=Me, iBu; py&#8242;=substituted pyridyl group) with different substituents on the Al atoms and pyridyl rings have been synthesised. The formation of the undesired cis isomers can be suppressed by the presence of substituents on the 6&#8208;position of the pyridyl ring due to steric congestion, with DFT calculations showing that the selection of the trans isomer is thermodynamically controlled. Calculations show that demethylation of the dimers [Me2Al(2&#8208;py&#8242;)]2 with Ph3C+ to the cations [{MeAl(2&#8208;py&#8217;)}2(&#956;&#8208;Me)]+ is highly favourable and that the desired trans disposition of the 2&#8208;pyridyl ring units is influenced by steric effects. Preliminary experimental studies confirm that demethylation of [Me2Al(6&#8208;MeO&#8208;2&#8208;py)]2 can be achieved using [Ph3C][B(C6F5)4].

         <title>Selective Mono&#8208;Defluorinative Cross&#8208;Coupling of Trifluoromethyl arenes via Multiphoton Photoredox Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new cross&#8208;coupling of trifluoromethyl arenes has been realized via multiphoton photoredox catalysis. A series of valuable &#945;,&#945;&#8208;difluorobenzylic compounds can be generated while the the addition of D2O leads to highly deuterated derivatives.







Abstract
A new cross&#8208;coupling of trifluoromethyl arenes has been realized via multiphoton photoredox catalysis. Trifluoromethyl arenes were demonstrated to undergo selective mono&#8208;defluorinative alkylation under mild reaction conditions providing access to a series of valuable &#945;,&#945;&#8208;difluorobenzylic compounds. The reaction shows broad substrate scope and general functional group tolerance. In addition to the electron&#8208;deficient trifluoromethyl arenes that are easily reduced to the corresponding radical anion, more challenging electron&#8208;rich substrates were also successfully applied. Steady&#8208;State Stern&#8208;Volmer quenching studies indicated that the trifluoromethyl arenes were reduced by the multiphoton excited Ir&#8208;based photocatalyst.

A novel [3+3] annulation reaction of 2&#8208;alkenylindoles with hydrazonyl chlorides in the presence of base for the formation of pyridazino[4,5&#8208;b]indoles was developed. This approach provided a convenient and efficient way to synthesize a series of functionalized pyridazino[4,5&#8208;b]indoles derivatives. The method exhibited a broad substrate scope and provided the corresponding pyridazino[4,5&#8208;b]indoles products with excellent yields.

The anilato&#8208;based DyIII&#8208;containing compounds formulated as [Dy2(C6O4Cl2)3(fma)6]&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;4.5fma (1) and [Dy2(C6O4X2)3(fma)6]&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;4fma&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2H2O, with X=Br (2) and Cl (3), prepared with formamide as coordinating solvent, are coordination polymers with a honey&#8208;comb layered structure showing slow magnetic relaxation when a DC field is applied. Compounds 1 and 3 are solvates obtained with a slow and fast crystallization method, respectively. Compounds 2 and 3 are isostructural.







Abstract
We have prepared and characterized three coordination polymers formulated as [Dy2(C6O4Cl2)3(fma)6]&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;4.5fma (1) and [Dy2(C6O4X2)3(fma)6]&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;4fma&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2H2O with X=Br (2) and Cl (3), where fma=formamide and C6O4X22&#8722;=3,6&#8208;disubstituted&#8208;2,5&#8208;dihydroxy&#8208;1,4&#8208;benzoquinone dianion with X=Cl (chloranilato) and Br (bromanilato). Compounds 1 and 3 are solvates obtained with slow and fast precipitation methods, respectively. Compounds 2 and 3 are isostructural and only differ in the X group of the anilato ligand. The three compounds present (6,3)&#8208;gon two&#8208;dimensional hexagonal honey&#8208;comb structures. Magnetic measurements indicate that the three compounds show slow relaxation of the magnetization at low temperatures when a continuous magnetic field is applied, although with different relaxation times and energy barriers depending on X and the crystallisation molecules. Compounds 1&#8211;3 represent the first examples of anilato&#8208;based lattices with formamide and field&#8208;induced slow relaxation of the magnetization.

         <title>Wireless Light&#8208;Emitting Electrode Arrays for the Evaluation of Electrocatalytic Activity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Simultaneous evaluation of the catalytic activity of anode and cathode materials present in water electrolyzers is made possible by combining bipolar electrochemistry with an optical readout based on light&#8208;emitting diodes. The straightforward strategy is an alternative to classic physico&#8208;chemical characterization techniques and can be applied beyond water splitting.







Abstract
Water splitting has become a sustainable and clean alternative for hydrogen production. Commonly, the efficiency of such reactions is intimately related to the physico&#8208;chemical properties of the catalysts that constitute the electrolyzer. Thus, the development of simple and fast methods to evaluate the electrocatalytic efficiency of an electrolyzer is highly required. In this work, we present an unconventional method based on the combination of bipolar electrochemistry and light&#8208;emitting diodes, which allows the evaluation of the electrocatalytic performance of the two types of catalysts, composing an electrolyzer, namely for oxygen and hydrogen evolution reactions, respectively. The integrated light emission of the diode acts as an optical readout of the electrocatalytic information, which simultaneously depends on the composition of the anode and the cathode. The electrocatalytic activity of Au, Pt, and Ni electrodes, connected to the LED in multiple anode/cathode configurations, towards the water splitting reactions has been evaluated. The efficiency of the electrolyzer can be represented in terms of the onset electric field (&#1013;onset) for light emission, obtaining variations that are in agreement with data reported with conventional electrochemistry. This work introduces a straightforward method for evaluating electrocatalysts and underscores the importance of material characterization in developing efficient electrolyzers for hydrogen production.

         <title>Intramolecular Friedel&#8208;Crafts Acylation of [11C]Isocyanates Enabling the Radiolabeling of [carbonyl&#8208;11C]DPQ</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a radiolabeling method for &#945;,&#946;&#8208;aromatic lactams using the PET nuclide carbon&#8208;11. The labeling reactions utilize widely available [11C]CO2 and amine precursors in a quick, robust and automatable one&#8208;pot reaction. The reaction showed a broad substrate scope and was applied to produce the otherwise inaccessible PARP inhibitor tracer [carbonyl&#8208;11C]DPQ, meeting the quality requirements of the European Pharmacopoeia.







Abstract
&#945;,&#946;&#8208;aromatic lactams are highly abundant in biologically active molecules, yet so far they cannot be radiolabeled with short&#8208;lived (t1/2=20.3&#8197;min), &#946;+&#8208;decaying carbon&#8208;11, which has prevented their application as positron emission tomography tracers. Herein, we developed, optimized, and applied a widely applicable, one&#8208;pot, quick, robust and automatable radiolabeling method for &#945;,&#946;&#8208;aromatic lactams starting from [11C]CO2 using the reagent POCl3&#8901;AlCl3. This method proceeds via intramolecular Friedel&#8208;Crafts acylation of in&#8197;situ formed [11C]isocyanates and shows a broad substrate scope for the formation of five&#8208; and six&#8208;membered rings. We implemented our developed labeling method for the radiosynthesis of the potential PARP1 PET tracer [carbonyl&#8208;11C]DPQ in a clinical radiotracer production facility following the standards of the European Pharmacopoeia.

         <title>Incorporation of Carboxylate Pendant Arms into 18&#8208;Membered Macrocycles: Effects on [nat/203Pb]Pb(II) Complexation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chelators based on an 18&#8208;membered macrocyclic unit form very stable Pb(II) complexes from the thermodynamic point of view. The studies performed with [203Pb]Pb(II) show that the fluxionality of the complexes is a key factor that needs to be considered for the development of Pb(II)&#8208;based radiopharmaceuticals.







Abstract
We present a detailed investigation on the coordination chemistry of [nat/203Pb]Pb(II) with chelators H4PYTA and H4CHX&#8208;PYTA. These chelators belong to the family of ligands derived from the 18&#8208;membered macrocyclic backbone PYAN and present varying degrees of rigidity due to the presence of either ethyl or cyclohexyl spacers. A complete study of the stable Pb(II) complexes is carried out via NMR, X&#8208;Ray crystallography, stability constant determination and computational studies. While these studies indicated that Pb(II) complexation is achieved, and the thermodynamic stability of the resulting complexes is very high, a certain degree of fluxionality does exist in both cases. Nevertheless, radiolabeling studies were carried out using SPECT (single photon emission computed tomography) compatible isotope lead&#8208;203 (203Pb, t1/2=51.9&#8197;h), and while both chelators complex the radioisotope, the incorporation of carboxylate pendant arms appears to be detrimental towards the stability of the complexes when compared to the previously described amide analogues. Additionally, incorporation of a cyclohexyl spacer does not improve the kinetic inertness of the system.

&lt;p&gt;We present a detailed investigation on the coordination chemistry of [&lt;sup&gt;nat/203&lt;/sup&gt;Pb]Pb(II) with chelators H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;PYTA and H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;i&gt;CHX&lt;/i&gt;-PYTA. These chelators belong to the family of ligands derived from the 18-membered macrocyclic backbone PYAN and present varying degrees of rigidity due to the presence of either ethyl or cyclohexyl spacers. A complete study of the stable Pb(II) complexes is carried out &lt;i&gt;via&lt;/i&gt; NMR, X-Ray crystallography, stability constant determination and computational studies. While these studies indicated that Pb(II) complexation is achieved, and the thermodynamic stability of the resulting complexes is very high, a certain degree of fluxionality does exist in both cases. Nevertheless, radiolabeling studies were carried out using SPECT (single photon emission computed tomography) compatible isotope lead-203 (&lt;sup&gt;203&lt;/sup&gt;Pb, &lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;1/2&lt;/sub&gt;=51.9&#8197;h), and while both chelators complex the radioisotope, the incorporation of carboxylate pendant arms appears to be detrimental towards the stability of the complexes when compared to the previously described amide analogues. Additionally, incorporation of a cyclohexyl spacer does not improve the kinetic inertness of the system.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>[Gd(HB&#8208;DO3A)]: Equilibrium, Dissociation Kinetic and Structural Differences in a Simple Homolog of [Gd(HP&#8208;DO3A)] (Prohance&#174;)</title>

The minor structural variation arising in [Gd(HB&#8208;DO3A)] from homologation of a coordination side arm of the clinically employed MRI contrast agent [Gd(HP&#8208;DO3A)] (gadoteridol) does not influence its overall general structure but significantly affects its dynamic properties.







Abstract
[Gd(HP&#8208;DO3A)] (gadoteridol) as an active compound of ProHance&#174; is a widely employed contrast agent in clinical MRI scans in the last 30&#8197;years. Recent concerns about the long&#8208;term retention of gadolinium&#8208;based contrast agents (GBCAs) led to a deeper investigation of the structural features underlying the integrity of the paramagnetic metal complex. Several human and nonclinical studies have noted marked differences among the macrocyclic GBCAs, with the least retention of Gd traces and most rapid elimination consistently being reported for [Gd(HP&#8208;DO3A)]. It was deemed of interest to assess how minor structural/electronic changes associated to the ligand structure may affect basic properties of the metal complex with several [Gd(HP&#8208;DO3A)] analogues synthesized and characterized in the last years. We recently reported that the closest homolog of [Gd(HP&#8208;DO3A)], i.&#8201;e.: [Gd(HB&#8208;DO3A)], in which a (&#177;)&#8208;2&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;1&#8208;propyl pendant arm is replaced by a (&#177;)&#8208;2&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;1&#8208;butyl moiety, showed a significantly different retention behaviour in the model interaction with collagen, despite the apparently very minor structural difference. In this paper we report a comprehensive study of the structural, thermodynamic, kinetic and relaxation properties of [Gd(HB&#8208;DO3A)], compared to the parent [Gd(HP&#8208;DO3A)] and to other closely related macrocyclic GBCAs to assess whether very minor structural changes can modulate the physico&#8208;chemical properties of Gd3+ complexes.

Abstract
A series of isostructural imidonitridophosphates AE2AlP8N15(NH) (AE=Ca, Sr, Ba) was synthesized at high&#8208;pressure/high&#8208;temperature conditions (1400&#8201;&#176;C and 5&#8211;9&#160;GPa) from alkaline&#8208;earth metal nitrides or azides Ca3N2/Sr(N3)2/Ba(N3)2 and the binary nitrides AlN and P3N5. NH4F served as a hydrogen source and mineralizing agent. The crystal structures were determined by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and feature a three&#8208;dimensional network of vertex&#8208;sharing PN4&#8208;tetrahedra forming diverse&#8208;sized rings that are occupied by aluminum and alkaline earth ions. These structures represent another example of nitridophosphate&#8208;based networks that simultaneously incorporate AlN6&#8208;octahedra and alkaline&#8208;earth&#8208;centered polyhedra, with aluminum not participating in the tetrahedra network. They differ from previously reported ones by incorporating non&#8208;condensed octahedra instead of strongly condensed octahedra units and contribute to the diversity of multicationic nitridophosphate network structures. The results are supported by atomic resolution EDX mapping, solid&#8208;state NMR and FTIR measurements. Eu2+&#8208;doped samples show strong luminescence with narrow emissions in the range of green to blue under UV excitation, marking another instance of Eu2+&#8208;luminescence within imidonitridophosphates.

         <title>Design of Bright Chemogenetic Reporters Based on the Combined Engineering of Fluorogenic Molecular Rotors and of the HaloTag Protein</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The combination of fluorogenic probes (fluorogens) and self&#8208;labeling protein tags represent a promising tool for imaging biological processes with high specificity but it requires the adequation between the fluorogen and its target to ensure a good activation of its fluorescence. In this work, we report a strategy to develop molecular rotors that specifically target HaloTag with a strong enhancement of their fluorescence. The divergent design facilitates the diversification of the structures to tune the photophysical and cellular properties. Four bright fluorogens with emissions ranging from green to red were identified and applied in wash&#8208;free live cell imaging experiments with good contrast and selectivity. A HaloTag mutant adapted from previous literature reports was also tested and shown to further improve the brightness and reaction rate of the most promising fluorogen of the series both in vitro and in cells. This work opens new possibilities to develop bright chemogenetic reporters with diverse photophysical and biological properties by exploring a potentially large chemical space of simple dipolar fluorophores in combination with protein engineering.</dc:description>

         <title>Structural and Electronic Chirality in Inorganic Crystals: from Construction to Application</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chirality represents a fundamental characteristic inherent in nature, playing a pivotal role in the emergence of homochirality and the origin of life. While the principles of chirality in organic chemistry are well&#8208;documented, the exploration of chirality within inorganic crystal structures continues to evolve. This ongoing development is primarily due to the diverse nature of crystal/amorphous structures in inorganic materials, along with the intricate symmetrical and asymmetrical relationships in the geometry of their constituent atoms. In this review, we commence with a summary of the foundational concept of chirality in molecules and solid states matters. This is followed by an introduction of structural chirality and electronic chirality in three&#8208;dimensional and two&#8208;dimensional inorganic materials. The construction of chirality in inorganic materials is classified into physical photolithography, wet&#8208;chemistry method, self&#8208;assembly, and chiral imprinting. Highlighting the significance of this field, we also summarize the research progress of chiral inorganic materials for applications in optical activity, enantiomeric recognition and chiral sensing, selective adsorption and enantioselective separation, asymmetric synthesis and catalysis, and chirality&#8208;induced spin polarization. This review aims to provide a reference for ongoing research in chiral inorganic materials and potentially stimulate innovative strategies and novel applications in the realm of chirality.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>
4,4&#8242;&#8208;Biazulene has been synthesized by the combination of decarbonylative borylation, iodination and Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling and characterized by spectroscopic and crystallographic methods. The racemization energy barrier of 4,4&#8242;&#8208;biazulene is comparable to that of isomeric 1,1&#8242;&#8208;binaphthyl.

4,4&#8242;&#8208;Biazulene is a potentially attractive key component of an axially chiral biaryl compound, however, its structure and properties have not been clarified owing to the lack of its efficient synthesis. We report a breakthrough in the reliable synthesis of 4,4&#8242;&#8208;biazulene, which is achieved by the access to azulen&#8208;4&#8208;ylboronic acid pinacol ester and 4&#8208;iodoazulene as novel key synthetic intermediates for the Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling reaction. The X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis of 4,4&#8242;&#8208;biazulene confirmed its axial chirality. The enantiomers of 4,4&#8242;&#8208;biazulene were successfully resolved by HPLC on the chiral stationary phase column. The kinetic experiments and DFT calculations indicate that the racemization energy barrier of 4,4&#8242;&#8208;biazulene is comparable to that of 1,1&#8242;&#8208;binaphthyl.

         <title>The Role of Alkalis in Orchestrating Uranyl&#8208;Peroxide Reactivity Leading to Direct Air Capture of Carbon Dioxide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Alkali&#8208;countercations for inorganic oxoanions are not innocent bystanders. The uranyl triperoxide anion, a monomer building block for uranyl&#8208;polyoxometalates, shows substantial decrease in stability with increasing alkali size, in solution and the solid state. The Cs uranyl triperoxide, stable for only minutes in air, undergoes stabilization by direct air capture of CO2.







Abstract
Spectator ions have known and emerging roles in aqueous metal&#8208;cation chemistry, respectively directing solubility, speciation, and reactivity. Here, we isolate and structurally characterize the last two metastable members of the alkali uranyl triperoxide series, the Rb+ and Cs+ salts (Cs&#8208;U1 and Rb&#8208;U1). We document their rapid solution polymerization via small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering, which is compared to the more stable Li+, Na+ and K+ analogues. To understand the role of the alkalis, we also quantify alkali&#8208;hydroxide promoted peroxide deprotonation and decomposition, which generally exhibits increasing reactivity with increasing alkali size. Cs&#8208;U1, the most unstable of the uranyl triperoxide monomers, undergoes ambient direct air capture of CO2 in the solid&#8208;state, converting to Cs4[UVIO2(CO3)3], evidenced by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, and Raman spectroscopy. We have attempted to benchmark the evolution of Cs&#8208;U1 to uranyl tricarbonate, which involves a transient, unstable hygroscopic solid that contains predominantly pentavalent uranium, quantified by X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Powder X&#8208;ray diffraction suggests this intermediate state contains a hydrous derivative of CsUVO3, where the parent phase has been computationally predicted, but not yet synthesized.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>1,2,4&#8208;triazolo&#8208;[4,3&#8208;a]pyrazine was prepared via a two&#8208;step electrochemical, photochemical process. First, a 5&#8208;substituted tetrazole is electrochemically coupled to 2,6&#8208;dimethoxypyrazine to yield 1,5&#8208; and 2,5&#8208; disubstituted tetrazoles. Subsequent photochemical excitation of the 2,5&#8208;disubstituted tetrazole species using an ultraviolet lamp releases nitrogen gas and produces a short&#8208;lived nitrilimine intermediate. Rapid cyclization of the nitrilimine intermediate yields a 1,2,4&#8208;triazolo&#8208;[4,3&#8208;a]pyrazine backbone. The scope of this reaction was explored using various tetrazoles and pyrazines. Materials produced were identified using chemical analytical techniques and computationally studied for potential application as an insensitive energetic material.</dc:description>

         <title>The Effect of Basic Ligands and Alkenes on the Regioselectivity of C&#8211;H  Additions of Tertiary Amines to Alkenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Highly regioselective C&#8210;H alkylation reactions of tertiary anilines and tertiary alkyl amines with simple alkenes have been achieved by the use of imidazolin&#8208;2&#8208;iminato scandium alkyl complexes. This protocol provided an efficient and  atom&#8208;economical route to structurally diverse tertiary amine derivatives. The basic ligand, a coordinating THF in the catalyst and the substitution of alkene substrates were found to switch the regioselectivity of the C&#8210;H alkylation reactions of tertiary anilines presumably due to the generation of different types of catalytically active species or the formation of relatively stable intermediates. On the basis of the deuterium labeling experiments and KIE experiments, possible catalytical cycles were provided to understand the reaction mechanism as well as the regioselectivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Polymorphism of Two&#8208;Dimensional Semiconducting Coordination Polymers: Impact of a Lead&#8211;Sulfur Network on Photoconductivity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sulfur&#8208;coordinated coordination polymers (S&#8208;CPs) have unique optoelectrical properties that originate from infinite M&#8211;S bond networks. In this study, we synthesized and characterized two polymorphs of a two&#8208;dimensional Pb(II) S&#8208;CP with a formula of [Pb(tzdt)(OAc)] (Htzdt = 1,3&#8208;thiazolidine&#8208;2&#8208;thione, OAc = acetate). Our findings revealed that the thermodynamic product (KGF&#8208;26) possesses (&#8211;Pb&#8211;O&#8211;)n chains only, whereas the kinetic product (KGF&#8208;27) has both one&#8208;dimensional (&#8211;Pb&#8211;O&#8211;)n chains and two&#8208;dimensional (&#8211;Pb&#8211;S&#8211;)n layers. The results of time&#8208;resolved microwave conductivity measurements and first&#8208;principles calculations confirmed that KGF&#8208;27 exhibits higher photoconductivity than KGF&#8208;26, which establishes that the inorganic (&#8211;Pb&#8211;S&#8211;)n networks formed in S&#8208;CPs are crucial for achieving high photoconductivity. This is the first experimental demonstration of the impact of the (&#8211;M&#8211;S&#8211;)n networks in S&#8208;CPs on photoconductivity through the comparison of crystal polymorphisms.</dc:description>

         <title>Directed Evolution and Immobilization of Lactobacillus brevis Alcohol Dehydrogenase for Chemo&#8208;enzymatic Synthesis of Rivastigmine</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Rivastigmine is one of the several pharmaceuticals widely prescribed for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. However, its practical synthesis still faces many issues, such as the involvement of toxic metals and harsh reaction conditions. Herein, we report a chemo&#8208;enzymatic synthesis of Rivastigmine. The key chiral intermediate was synthesized by an engineered alcohol dehydrogenase from Lactobacillus brevis (LbADH). A semi&#8208;rational approach was employed to improve its catalytic activity and thermal stability. Several LbADH variants were obtained with a remarkable increase in activity and melting temperature. Exploration of the substrate scope of these variants demonstrated improved activities toward various ketones, especially acetophenone analogs. To further recycle and reuse the biocatalyst, one LbADH variant and glucose dehydrogenase were co&#8208;immobilized on nanoparticles. By integrating enzymatic and chemical steps, Rivastigmine was successfully synthesized with an overall yield of 66%. This study offers an efficient chemo&#8208;enzymatic route for Rivastigmine and provides several efficient LbADH variants with a broad range of potential applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Temperature&#8208;induced Sign Inversion of Circularly Polarized&#160;Luminescence of Binaphthyl&#8208;bridged Tetrathiapyrenophanes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>D2&#8208;symmetric (R)&#8208;binaphthyl&#8208;bridged pyrenophanes containing thioether bonds were synthesized. The pyrenophanes exhibited the temperature&#8208;induced sign inversion of circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) while maintaining the emission wavelength and reversibility. The &#916;glum value reached 0.02, and the FL quenching by heat was negligible. The sign inversion of CPL originates from the inversion of intramolecular excimer chirality associated with excitation dynamics. The two pyrenes form a kinetically trapped left&#8208;handed twist excimer at low temperatures, while they form a thermodynamically favored right&#8208;handed twist excimer at high temperatures. The thioether linkers can impart flexibility suitable for the inversion of chirality of the excimers.</dc:description>

         <title>Chiral Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks with Spectroscopic Methods: Towards Chemical Sensor Devices</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chiral Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks (CMOFs) are a rapidly growing field reflecting their potential as selective and sensitive chemical sensors for chiral analytes. The highly tuneable nature of CMOFs enables the size, shape, and non&#8208;covalent interactions to be optimised towards specific analytes to engender strong intermolecular interactions and sensing responses. While CMOFs as chiral chemical sensor devices have been explored with electrochemical methods including differential pulse voltammetry (DPV), bipolar and chemiresistive sensing techniques, the CMOFs as chiral chemical sensors using spectroscopic methods has received significantly less attention. This review examines the synthesis of CMOFs for chemical sensors with spectroscopic methods such as photoluminescence, circular dichroism, and solid&#8208;state nuclear magnetic resonance with a view towards their incorporation into chemical sensor devices. Future directions of the field are highlighted for the generation of functional devices.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis and Lewis Acid Properties of Neutral Silver(III) Adducts Containing the AgIII(CF3)3 Moiety</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The acetonitrile AgIII complex [AgIII(CF3)3(NCCH3)] (2) has been reported independently by Eujen and Naumann in the last century, albeit with intriguing NMR discrepancy. In their reports, 2 was claimed to be obtained starting from either [AgIII(CF3)3Cl]&#8211; (3.Cl) or [AgIII(CF3)4]&#8211; (1) via halide abstraction using AgNO3 or acidic treatment, resp. These two synthetic routes are herein reinvestigated. The feasibility of Naumann&#8217;s method is demonstrated, thus providing 2 yet accompanied by its s&#8208;triazinyl derivative [AgIII(CF3)3(C6H9N3)] (2&#8217;). The formation of 2&#8217; is unprecedented and was thereby investigated. Both 2 and 2&#8217; were isolated in pure fashion and fully characterized. In turn, halide extraction from 3.Cl leads to the AgIII&#8208;ONO2 anion 5 instead of 2, as evidenced by NMR spectroscopy, EA and Sc&#8208;XRD.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis, Structure and (Photo)Catalytic Behavior of Ce&#8208;MOFs Containing Perfluoroalkylcarboxylate Linkers: Experimental and Theoretical Insights</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cerium&#8208;based Metal&#8208;Organic frameworks (Ce&#8208;MOFs) are attracting increasing interest due to their similar structural features to zirconium MOFs. The redox behavior of Ce(III/IV) adds a range of properties to the compounds. Recently, perfluorinated linkers have been used in the synthesis of MOFs to introduce new characteristic into the structure.&#160;We report the synthesis and structural characterization of Ce(IV)&#8208;based MOFs constructed using two perfluorinated alkyl linkers. Their structure, based on hexanuclear Ce6O4(OH)412+ clusters linked to each other by the dicarboxylate ions, has been solved ab&#8208;initio from X&#8208;ray powder diffraction data and refined by the Rietveld method. The crystallization kinetics and the MOF formation mechanism was also invesitigated by Synchrotron radiation with XAS spectroscopies (EXAFS and XANES). The MOFs present the same fcu cubic topology as observed in MOF&#8208;801 and UiO&#8208;66, and they showed good stability in water at different pH conditions. The electronic structure of these MOFs has been studied by DFT calculations in order to obtain insights into the density of states structure of the reported compounds, resulting in band gaps in the range of 2.8&#8208;3.1 eV. Their catalytic properties were tested both thermally and under visible light irradiation for the degradation of methyl orange (MO) dye.</dc:description>

         <title>Heptagonal Molecular Tiling via Self&#8208;Assembly of Heptagonal Phenylene&#8208;Ethynylene Macrocycle at the Liquid&#8211;Solid Interface</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The molecular&#8208;level scrutinization of on&#8208;surface tiling garners considerable interest among scientists. Herein, we demonstrate molecular&#8208;level heptagonal tiling using the self&#8208;assembly of a heptagonal meta&#8208;phenylene&#8208;ethynylene macrocycle featuring 14 long alkoxy substituents at the liquid&#8211;graphite interface using scanning tunneling microscopy. This heptagonal macrocycle produces an antiparallel pattern at the 1&#8208;phenyloctane&#8211;graphite interface through van der Waals interactions between the alkoxy chains. This pattern resembles the densely packed pattern of heptagonal tiles, albeit with variations in the orientations and spacing of heptagonal cores owing to intermolecular interactions between the alkoxy chains. Conversely, at the 1,2,4&#8208;trichlorobenzene&#8211;graphite interface, the heptagonal molecule forms an oblique pattern composed of four independent molecular orientations. This phenomenon arises from core distortion induced by the coadsorption of the solvent molecules within the intrinsic macrocyclic pores. This study elucidates the design strategy&#8212;specifically, the choice of heptagonal molecular building block&#8212;for heptagonal tiling and fills a crucial gap in the field of two&#8208;dimensional crystal engineering.</dc:description>

         <title>Chemoenzymatic Synthesis of Tri&#8208;antennary&#160;N&#8208;glycans Terminating in Sialyl&#8208;Lewisx Reveals the Importance of Glycan Complexity for Influenza A Virus Receptor Binding</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sialyl&#8208;Lewisx&#160;(SLex) is involved in immune regulation, human fertilization, cancer, and bacterial and viral diseases. The influence of the complex glycan structures, which can present SLex&#160;epitopes, on binding is largely unknown. We report here a chemoenzymatic strategy for the preparation of a panel&#160;of twenty&#8208;two&#160;isomeric asymmetrical tri&#8208;antennary&#160;N&#8208;glycans presenting SLex&#8208;Lex&#160;epitopes on either the MGAT4 or MGAT5 arm&#160;that include putative high&#8208;affinity ligands for E&#8208;selectin. The&#160;N&#8208;glycans were prepared starting from&#160;a sialoglycopeptide isolated from egg yolk powder and&#160;took advantage of inherent substrate preferences of glycosyltransferases and the use of 5&#8242;&#8208;diphospho&#8208;N&#8208;trifluoracetylglucosamine (UDP&#8208;GlcNHTFA) that can be transferred by branching&#160;N&#8208;acetylglucosaminyltransferases to give, after base treatment,&#160;GlcNH2&#8208;containing glycans that temporarily disable an antenna from enzymatic modification.&#160;Glycan microarray binding studies showed that E&#8208;selectin bound equally well to linear glycans and tri&#8208;antennary&#160;N&#8208;glycans presenting SLex&#8208;Lex. On the other hand, it was found that hemagglutinins (HA) of H5 influenza A viruses (IAV) preferentially bound the tri&#8208;antennary&#160;N&#8208;glycans. Furthermore, several H5 HAs preferentially bound to&#160;N&#8208;glycan presenting SLex&#160;on the MGAT4 arm. SLex&#160;is displayed in the respiratory tract of several avian species, demonstrating the relevance of investigating the binding of, among others IAVs, to complex&#160;N&#8208;glycans presenting SLex.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Saturated heterocycles are important class of structural scaffolds in small&#8208;molecule drugs, natural products, and synthetic intermediates. Here, we disclosed a metal free, mild, and scalable functionalization of saturated heterocycles using vinylarenes as a linchpin approach. Key to success of this transformation is the employing of simple and cheap benzophenone as a hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) catalyst. This operationally robust process was used for the making of diverse functionalized saturated heterocycles. Furthermore, aldehydes, alkane, and alcohol have been functionalized under the optimized conditions.

         <title>Highly Stable Self&#8208;Regenerating Organic Multi&#8208;Redox Systems derived from Bicyclic (Alkyl)(amino)carbenes (BICAACs)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly stable organic radical cations with multiple redox states spanning over notably wide redox range (1.8&#8197;V) were derived from bicyclic(alkyl)amino carbenes (BICAACs). The availability of stable multiple redox states was utilized in the symmetric H&#8208;cell charge/discharge cycling. The system works efficiently and continuously for 1500 cycles in 2e&#8722; charge/discharge process with a minimum capacity loss and regenerated upon exposure to air.







Abstract
An extended class of organic multi&#8208;redox systems was derived from bicyclic(alkyl)amino carbenes (BICAACs). The highly&#8208;conjugated system undergoes a total of 4 redox events spanning a 1.8&#8197;V redox range. These organic compounds exhibited four different stable redox states (dication, radical cation, neutral and radical anion), and all of them were characterized either by single crystal X&#8208;ray study and/or various spectroscopic studies. Three of the four redox states are stable to air and moisture. The availability of stable multiple redox states demonstrated promise towards their efficacy in the symmetric H&#8208;cell charge/discharge cycling. Among various redox states, the dication/neutral state works efficiently and continuously for 1500 cycles in 2e&#8722; charge/discharge process outside glovebox in commercially available DMF with minimum capacity loss (retaining nearly 90&#8201;% Coulombic efficiency). Surprisingly, the efficiency of the redox cycle was retained even if the system was exposed to air for 30&#8197;days when it slowly regenerated to the initial deep blue radical cation, and it exhibited another 100 charge/discharge cycles with a minimal capacity loss. Such a stable H&#8208;cell cycling ability is not well known among organic molecule&#8208;based systems.

         <title>In situ Diazonium Salt Formation and Photochemical Aryl&#8208;Aryl Coupling in Continuous Flow Monitored by Inline NMR Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Diazonium trifluoroacetates for biphenyls are an underrated aryl radical source for the photochemical aryl&#8208;aryl coupling. This concept does not require any additional catalysts to perform an efficient and selective reaction. The photoarylation is supported by the application of Flow Chemistry using microreactors and modern LED technology. An integrated benchtop NMR spectrometer enables real&#8208;time analysis of the substituted products.







Abstract
A novel class of diazonium salts is introduced for the photochemical aryl&#8208;aryl coupling to produce (substituted) biphenyls. As common diazonium tetrafluoroborate salts fail, soluble and safe aryl diazonium trifluoroacetates are applied. In this mild synthesis route no catalysts are required to generate an aryl&#8208;radical by irradiation with UV&#8208;A light (365&#8197;nm). This reactive species undergoes direct C&#8722;H arylation at an arene, forming the product in reasonable reaction times. With the implementation of a continuous flow setup in a capillary photoreactor 13 different biphenyl derivatives are successfully synthesized. By integrating an inline 19F&#8208;NMR benchtop spectrometer, samples are reliably quantified as the fluorine&#8208;substituents act as a probe. Here, real&#8208;time NMR spectroscopy is a perfect tool to monitor the continuously operated system, which produces fine chemicals of industrial relevance even in a multigram scale.

         <title>Influence of Polymer Side Chain Size and Backbone Length on the Self&#8208;Assembly of Supramolecular Polymer Bottlebrushes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Benzene trisurea (BTU) and benzene tris(phenylalanine) (BTP) can assemble into supramolecular polymer bottlebrushes in water when conjugated to hydrophilic polymers. Here we investigate the effect of side and main chain lengths of the attached polymers on the resulting morphologies. Both longer main and side chains induce a morphological transition from cylindrical to spherical micelles, but the latter can even prevent any form of aggregation.







Abstract
Hydrogen bonds are a versatile tool for creating fibrous, bottlebrush&#8208;like assemblies of polymeric building blocks. However, a delicate balance of forces exists between the steric repulsion of the polymer chains and these directed supramolecular forces. In this work we have systematically investigated the influence of structural parameters of the attached polymers on the assembly behaviour of benzene trisurea (BTU) and benzene tris(phenylalanine) (BTP) conjugates in water. Polymers with increasing main chain lengths and different side chain sizes were prepared by reversible addition&#8208;fragmentation chain&#8208;transfer (RAFT) polymerization of hydroxyethyl acrylate (HEA), tri(ethylene glycol) methyl ether acrylate (TEGA) and oligo(ethylene glycol) methyl ether acrylate (OEGA). The resulting structures were analyzed using small angle X&#8208;ray scattering (SAXS) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Both BTU and BTP formed fibres with PHEA attached, but a transition to spherical morphologies was observed at degrees of polymerisation (DP) of 70 and above. Overall, the main chain length appeared to be a dominating factor in inducing morphology transitions. Increasing the side chain size generally had a similar effect but mainly impeded any aggregation as is the case of POEGA. Interestingly, BTP conjugates still formed fibres, suggesting that the stronger intermolecular interactions can compensate partially for the steric repulsion.

         <title>pH&#8208;Responsive Aminobenzocoumarins as Fluorescent Probes for Biological Acidity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fluorescent pH probes applicable in staining lysosomes in live human cells have been synthesized and characterized. These aminobenzocoumarins display large Stokes shifts, emission in the visible region, and up to 300&#8208;fold emission intensity increase upon activation in acidic conditions.







Abstract
Regulation of pH plays an essential role in orchestrating the delicate cellular machinery responsible for life as we know it. Its abnormal values are indicative of aberrant cellular behavior and associated with pathologies including cancer progression or solid tumors. Here, we report a series of bent and linear aminobenzocoumarins decorated with different substituents. We investigate their photophysical properties and demonstrate that the probes display strong pH&#8208;responsive fluorescence &#8220;turn on&#8221; behavior in highly acidic environments, with enhancement up to 300&#8208;fold. In combination with their low cytotoxicity, this behavior enabled their application in bioimaging of acidic lysosomes in live human cells. We believe that these molecules serve as attractive lead structures for future rational design of novel biocompatible fluorescent pH probes.

We investigate their photophysical properties and demonstrate that the probes display strong pH-responsive fluorescence &#8220;turn on&#8221; behavior in highly acidic environments, with enhancement up to 300-fold. In combination with their low cytotoxicity, this behavior enabled their application in bioimaging of acidic lysosomes in live human cells. We believe that these molecules serve as attractive lead structures for future rational design of novel biocompatible fluorescent pH probes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Eight&#8208;Electron Copper Nanoclusters for Photothermal Conversion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Atomically precise Cu54 nanoclusters with eight free valence electrons have been prepared, characterized, and structurally determined. The clusters show high performance in the field of photothermal conversion. For the first time, atomically precise copper nanoclusters are proved to be effective in photothermal application, which may stimulate the research on using copper nanoclusters in material sciences.







Abstract
Owing to distinct physicochemical properties in comparison to gold and silver counterparts, atomically precise copper nanoclusters are attracting embryonic interest in material science. The introduction of copper cluster nanomaterials in more interesting fields is currently urgent and desired. Reported in this work are novel copper nanoclusters of [XCu54Cl12(tBuS)20(NO3)12] (X=S or none, tBuSH=2&#8208;methyl&#8208;2&#8208;propanethiol), which exhibit high performance in photothermal conversion. The clusters have been prepared in one pot and characterized by combinatorial techniques including ultraviolet&#8208;visible spectroscopy (UV&#8208;vis), electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI&#8208;MS), and X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The molecular structure of the clusters, as revealed by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis (SCXRD), shows the concentric three&#8208;shell Russian doll arrangement of X@Cu14@Cl12@Cu40. Interestingly, the [SCu54Cl12(tBuS)20(NO3)12] cluster contains 8 free valence electrons in its structure, making it the first eight&#8208;electron copper nanocluster stabilized by thiolates. More impressively, the clusters possess an effective photothermal conversion (temperature increases by 71&#8201;&#176;C within ~50&#8197;s, &#955;ex=445&#8197;nm, 0.5&#8197;W&#8201;cm&#8722;2) in a wide wavelength range (either blue or near&#8208;infrared). The photothermal conversion can be even driven under irradiation of simulated sunlight (3 sun), endowing the clusters with great potency in solar energy utilization.

         <title>Construction of Co1&#8208;xZnxFe2xGa2&#8208;2xO4 (0&lt;x&#8804;0.6) solid solutions for improving solar fuels production in photocatalytic CO2 reduction by H2O vapour</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Solid solutions are garnering substantial attention in the realm of solar energy utilization due to their tunable electronic properties, encompassing band edge positions and charge&#8208;carrier mobilities. In this study, we designed and synthesized Co1&#8208;xZnxFe2xGa2&#8208;2xO4 (0&lt;x&#8804;0.6) as a photocatalyst for CO2 conversion using H2O. Careful optical and photo/electrochemical characterizations unveiled that the relative content of CoGa2O4 and ZnFe2O4 not only substantially influences light absorption in the full solar spectrum but also modulates valence and conduction band positions. We thoroughly assessed the photocatalytic activity of Co1&#8208;xZnxFe2xGa2&#8208;2xO4 and found that when x=0.35, the solid&#8208;solution catalyst achieved a remarkable CO2 reduction rate to CH4 and CO (31.5 &#956;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1). Furthermore, this optimized solid&#8208;solution catalyst demonstrated impressive photostability. Characterization and DFT calculations revealed that the formation of a solid solution not only reduces the band gap and promotes the separation of electron&#8208;hole pairs to accelerate efficient CO2 photoreduction, but also the introduction of more FeO6 octahedral active sites in Co1&#8208;xZnxFe2xGa2&#8208;2xO4 solid solutions enhanced the effective photoreduction of CO2. This design results in high conversion efficiencies for producing solar fuels through CO2 reduction with H2O.</dc:description>

         <title>Nucleic acid&#8208;Templated Synthesis of Cationic Styryl Dyes in vitro and in Living Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A novel method for synthesizing cationic styryl dyes through a nucleic acid&#8208;templated reaction has been developed. This approach overcomes issues associated with traditional synthesis methods, such as harsh conditions, low throughput, and wasteful chemicals. The presence of a nucleic acid template accelerated the styryl dye formation from quaternized heteroaromatic and cationic aldehyde substrates. These styryl dyes show remarkable optical properties change when bound to nucleic acids, hence the success of the synthesis could be readily monitored in situ by UV&#8208;Vis and fluorescence spectroscopy and the optical properties data were also observable at the same time. This method provides the desired products from a broad range of coupling partners. By employing different substrates and templates, it is possible to identify new dyes that can bind to a specific type of nucleic acid such as a G&#8208;quadruplex. The templated dye synthesis is also successfully demonstrated in live HeLa cells. This approach is a powerful tool for the rapid synthesis and screening of dyes specific for diverse types of nucleic acids or cellular organelles, facilitating new biological discoveries.</dc:description>

         <title>Dual Enzyme&#8208;Encapsulated Materials for Biological Cascade Chemistry and Synergistic Tumor Starvation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Framework and polymeric nanoreactors (NRs) have distinct advantages in improving chemical reaction efficiency in the tumor microenvironment (TME). Nanoreactor&#8208;loaded oxidoreductase enzyme is activated by tumor acidity to produce H2O2 by increasing tumor oxidative stress. High levels of H2O2 induce self&#8208;destruction of the vesicles by releasing quinone methide to deplete glutathione and suppress the antioxidant potential of cancer cells. Therefore, the synergistic effect of the enzyme&#8208;loaded nanoreactors results in efficient tumor ablation via suppressing cancer&#8208;cell metabolism. The main driving force would be to take advantage of the distinct metabolic properties of cancer cells along with the high peroxidase&#8208;like activity of metalloenzyme/metalloprotein. A cascade strategy of dual enzymes such as glucose oxidase (GOx) and nitroreductase (NTR) wherein the former acts as an O2&#8208;consuming agent such as overexpression of NTR and further amplified NTR&#8208;catalyzed release for antitumor therapy. The design of cascade bioreductive hypoxia&#8208;responsive drug delivery via GOx regulates NTR upregulation and NTR&#8208;responsive nanoparticles. Herein, we discuss tumor hypoxia, reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation, and the effectiveness of these therapies. Nanoclusters in cascaded enzymes along with chemo&#8208;radiotherapy with synergistic therapy are illustrated. Finally, we outline the role of the nanoreactor strategy of cascading enzymes along with self&#8208;synergistic tumor therapy.</dc:description>

         <title>Ether Naphthotube Host&#8208;guest Complexes and [2]Rotaxanes with Dications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The interactions between ether naphthotube and a series of dication guests in organic solution were investigated. It was found that ether naphthotube formed stable host&#8208;guest complexes selectively with these guests in a 1:1 stoichiometric ratio with association constants ranging from 102 to 106 M&#8208;1, which were confirmed by 1H&#8208;NMR spectra and ITC experiments. The host&#8208;guest interactions are driven by enthalpy change as the entropic factors are unfavorable. Positive correlations between &#916;H and &#916;S have been observed in the host&#8208;guest complexes. Furthermore, the para&#8208;substitution of the guests can significantly affect the binding affinities through a combination of field/inductive and resonance effects by following a linear free energy relationship. Based on the host&#8208;guest complexes composed of ether naphthotube and organic cations, two interlocked [2]rotaxanes were prepared by cationization reaction and Huisgen cycloaddition between the cations and the stopper components. The ether naphthotube&#8208;based host&#8208;guest complexes are useful for creating sophisticated interlocked molecules.</dc:description>

         <title>Advances in the Continuous Flow Synthesis of 3&#8208; and 4&#8208;Membered Ring Systems</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Small carbo&#8208; and heterocyclic ring systems have experienced a significant increase in importance in recent years due to their relevance in modern pharmaceuticals, as building blocks for designer materials or as synthetic intermediates. This necessitated the development of new synthetic methods for the preparation of these strained ring systems focusing on effectiveness and scalability. The high ring strain of these entities as well as the use of high&#8208;energy reagents and intermediates has often challenged their synthesis. Continuous flow approaches have thus emerged as highly effective means to safely and reliably access these strained scaffolds. In this short review, key developments in this field are summarised showcasing the power of continuous flow approaches for accessing 3&#8208; and 4&#8208;membered ring systems via thermal, photo&#8208; and electrochemical processes.</dc:description>

         <title>Indenoannulated Tridecacyclene: An All&#8208;Carbon Seven&#8208;Stage Redox&#8208;Amphoter</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We disclose an indenoannulated tridecacyclene comprising a central cyclooctatetraene moiety with multiple adjacent pentagonal rings which is accessible in a concise synthetic sequence. The saddle&#8208;shaped geometry of the non&#8208;benzenoid polycyclic scaffold and its unique packing behavior in the solid state were characterized by X&#8208;ray crystallography. In electrochemical studies, the compound undergoes seven reversible redox events comprising five reductions and two oxidations. The dicationic and dianionic species obtained by chemical oxidation and reduction, respectively, were characterized spectroscopically in solution. Density functional theory calculations were applied to provide insights into aromaticity evolution in the respective charged species, highlighting the beneficial effect of the non&#8208;benzenoid moieties on charge stabilization</dc:description>

         <title>On the Use of Triethyloxonium Tetrafluoroborate for Chloride Removal during Sarcosine&#160;N&#8208;Carboxyanhydride Synthesis: Improving NCA purity for controlled ring opening polymerization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The clinical translation of polysarcosine (pSar) as polyethylene glycol (PEG) replacement in the development of novel nanomedicines creates a broad demand of polymeric material in high&#8208;quality making high&#8208;purity sarcosine N&#8208;carboxyanhydride (Sar&#8208;NCA) as monomer for its production inevitable. Within this report, we present the use of triethyloxonium tetrafluoroborate in Sar&#8208;NCA synthesis with focus on amino acid and chloride impurities to avoid the sublimation of Sar&#8208;NCAs. With a view towards upscaling into kilogram or ton scale, a new methodology of monomer purification is introduced by utilizing the Meerwein&#8217;s Salt triethyloxonium tetrafluoroborate to remove chloride impurities by covalent binding and converting chloride ions into volatile products within a single step. The novel straightforward technique enables access to monomers with significantly reduced chloride content (&lt;100&#160;ppm) compared to Sar&#8208;NCA derived by synthesis or sublimation. The derived monomers enable the controlled&#8208;living polymerization in DMF and provide access to pSar polymers with Poisson&#8208;like molecular weight distribution within a high range of chain lengths (Xn 25&#8208;200). In conclusion, the reported method can be easily applied to Sar&#8208;NCA synthesis or purification of commercially available pSar&#8208;NCAs and eases access to well&#8208;defined hetero&#8208;telechelic pSar polymers.</dc:description>

         <title>Selective transition enhancement in a g&#8208;engineered diradical</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A diradical with engineered g&#8208;asymmetry was synthesized by grafting a nitroxide radical onto the [Y(Pc)2]&#729; radical platform. Various spectroscopic techniques and computational studies revealed that the electronic structures of the two spin systems remained minimally affected within the diradical system. Fluid&#8208;solution Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) experiments revealed a weak exchange coupling with |J| ~ 0.014 cm&#8208;1, subsequently rationalized by CAS&#8208;SCF calculations. Frozen solution continuous&#8208;wave (CW) EPR experiments showed a complicated and power&#8208;dependent spectrum that eluded analysis using the point&#8208;dipole model. Pulse EPR manipulations with varying microwave powers, or under varying magnetic fields, demonstrated that different resonances could be selectively enhanced or suppressed, based on their different tipping angles. In particular, Field&#8208;Swept Echo&#8208;Detected (FSED) spectra revealed absorptions of MW power&#8208;dependent intensities, while Field&#8208;Swept Spin Nutation (FSSN) experiments revealed two distinct Rabi frequencies. This study introduces a methodology to synthesize and characterize g&#8208;asymmetric two&#8208;spin systems, of interest in the implementation of spin&#8208;based CNOT gates.</dc:description>

         <title>Iridium Pyridylpyrrolides Hyperpolarised by Para&#8208;Hydrogen</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chemical activation of the nuclear singlet state of dihydrogen, para&#8208;hydrogen, can dramatically increase the sensitivity of magnetic resonance spectroscopy and imaging. Here, we show that the highly reversible activation of para&#8208;hydrogen by an iridium pyridylpyrrolide complex is capable of producing this hyperpolarisation effect. Bound alkene ligands exhibit signal enhancement without reduction to alkanes, which is in contrast to the most widely used hyperpolarisation catalysts. The complex is recoverable due to the highly reversible binding and release of H2, and result in enhanced hydride signals in a wide range of coordinating and non&#8208;coordinating deuterated solvents. Synthetic modification of the ligand substituents and the addition of co&#8208;ligands show a strong dependence of chemical structure on reactivity, which reveals an untapped potential to exploit pyridylpyrrolides as ligands in the development of tunable para&#8208;hydrogen induced hyperpolarisation catalysts or molecular probes.</dc:description>

         <title>An Enantioselective Aminocatalytic Cascade Reaction Affording Bioactive Hexahydroazulene Scaffolds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A novel cascade reaction initiated by an enantioselective aminocatalysed 1,3&#8208;dipolar [6+4] cycloaddition between catalytically generated trienamines and 3&#8208;oxidopyridinium betaines is presented. The [6+4] cycloadduct spontaneously undergoes an intramolecular enamine&#8208;mediated aldol, hydrolysis, and E1cb sequence, which ultimately affords a chiral hexahydroazulene framework. In this process, three new C&#8211;C bonds and three new stereocenters are formed, enabled by a formal unfolding of the pyridine moiety from the dipolar reagent. The hexahydroazulenes are formed with excellent diastereo&#8208;, regio&#8208; and periselectivity (&gt;20:1), up to 96% ee, and yields up to 52%. Synthetic elaborations of this scaffold were performed, providing access to a variety of functionalised hydroazulene compounds, of which some were found to display biological activity in U&#8208;2OS osteosarcoma cells in cell painting assays.</dc:description>

         <title>Emergent Properties in Chemistry &#8208; Relating Molecular Properties to Bulk Behavior</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Certain physico&#8208;chemical properties like density or color emerge only when a sufficient number of atoms or molecules are combined in a suitable way. By discussing various case studies, such as the liquidity of water, we here investigate the fundamental types of emergence in chemistry. Studying how properties emerge enables us to gain a deeper understanding of the nature of these properties.







Abstract
Certain properties of an object only emerge when a sufficient number of those objects are present in a definite arrangement. For example, one or two water molecules cannot said to be in a liquid state, but a drop of water can be. This concept of emergence has been studied extensively, but only occasionally discussed explicitly in the context of chemistry. In this paper, we aim to show the fruitfulness of the concept of emergence for chemical inquiry by considering four case studies of emergent chemical properties, i.&#8201;e., the liquidity and freezing of water, structural properties of crystals, thermodynamical phase transitions and quantum mechanical phenomena. We show that some of these properties emerge gradually, some at discrete points, and some should be taken to emerge only when the number of constituents tends to infinity. We argue that studying the way in which chemical properties emerge presents a useful avenue for research that promises greater insight into the nature of those properties.

In this paper, we aim to show the fruitfulness of the concept of emergence for chemical inquiry by considering four case studies of emergent chemical properties, i.&#8201;e., the liquidity and freezing of water, structural properties of crystals, thermodynamical phase transitions and quantum mechanical phenomena. We show that some of these properties emerge gradually, some at discrete points, and some should be taken to emerge only when the number of constituents tends to infinity. We argue that studying the way in which chemical properties emerge presents a useful avenue for research that promises greater insight into the nature of those properties.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Bacteria at Work &#8211; Experimental and Theoretical Studies Reveal the Catalytic Mechanism of Ectoine Synthase</title>

Ectoine is a compound gaining popularity in recent years, having unique moisturizing and cell&#8208;protective properties. This osmolyte is produced by many bacteria species via the ectoine biosynthetic pathway, the final stage of which is&#160;catalyzed by Ectoine Synthase (EctC). Here, the catalytic mechanism of EctC is proposed, supported by theoretical (QM/MM) and experimental studies (Mossbauer spectroscopy).







Abstract
Ectoine synthase (EctC) catalyses the ultimate step of ectoine biosynthesis, a kosmotropic compound produced as compatible solute by many bacteria and some archaea or eukaryotes. EctC is an Fe2+&#8208;dependent homodimeric cytoplasmic protein. Using M&#246;ssbauer spectroscopy, molecular dynamics simulations and QM/MM calculations, we determined the most likely coordination number and geometry of the Fe2+ ion and proposed a mechanism of the EctC&#8208;catalysed reaction. Most notably, we show that apart from the three amino acids binding to the iron ion (Glu57, Tyr84 and His92), one water molecule and one hydroxide ion are required as additional ligands for the reaction to occur. They fill the first coordination sphere of the Fe2+&#8208;cofactor and act as critical proton donors and acceptors during the cyclization reaction.
