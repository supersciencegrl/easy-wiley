      <title>Journey from Small&#8208;molecule Diyne Structures to 2D Graphdiyne: Synthetic Strategies</title>
      <dc:description>Graphdiyne (GDY) exhibited unique properties of highly conjugated &#960; system, conformably distributed pores, and direct bandgap. This encouraged multidisciplinary research groups to investigate its application in energy conversion and storage, catalysts, electronic devices, sensing and separation. In this Minireview, we present the achievements of synthesis strategies for small&#8208;molecule diyne structures (graphdiyne substructure), 1D nanoribbons and 2D graphdiyne. These studies may help future investigation of the intrinsic structure&#8208;related properties of graphdiyne and synthesis methodology for the future developments of graphdiyne related 2D carbon materials.</dc:description>

      <title>Nanoisozymes: The Origin behind Pristine CeO2 as Enzyme&#8208;mimetics</title>
      <dc:description>It is well&#8208;known that the interplay between molecules and active sites on the topmost surface of solid catalyst determines its activity in heterogeneous catalysis. The electron density of active site is believed to affect both adsorption and activation of reactant molecules at surface. Unfortunately, commercial X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) often adopted for such characterization is not sensitive enough to catalyst&#8217; topmost surface. In our opinion, most researchers fail to acknowledge this point during their catalytic correlation, leading to different interpretations found in literatures over the past decades. Recent studies on pristine Cu2O (Nat. Catal. 2019, 2, 889; Nat. Energy 2019, 4, 957) have clearly suggested that the electron density of surface Cu is facet dependent and plays a key role in CO2 reduction. Herein, we show that pristine CeO2 can reach 2506%/1133% increase in phosphatase&#8208;/peroxidase&#8208;like activity once the exposed surface is wisely selected. Using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) with surface probe, the electron density of surface Ce (i.e. the active site) is found facet&#8208;dependent and the key factor dictating their enzyme mimicking activities. Most importantly, the surface area of those CeO2 morphologies was demonstrated to become a factor only when their surface Ce can activate the adsorbed reactant molecules.</dc:description>

      <title>Two&#8208;Dimensional Mesoporous Carbon Materials Derived from Fullerene Microsheets for Energy Applications</title>
      <dc:description>Porous carbon materials with rich defects are promising candidates in energy storage and conversion applications. Herein, we report a facile template&#8208;free approach for the synthesis of a two&#8208;dimensional (2D) mesoporous carbon material derived from fullerene (C60) microsheets (FMSs) by simple heat&#8208;treatment. The sample obtained at 1000  o  C (FMS1000) shows a large surface area of 1507.6 m  2  g  &#8208;1  due to the presence of mesopores and rich defects which promote the electron and mass transfer in the electrocatalysis process of oxygen reduction reactions (ORR) showing excellent performances with an onset potential of 0.95 V, half&#8208;wave potential of 0.85 V and long&#8208;term durability of 2000 cycles which are comparable to that of commercial Pt/C. Moreover, FMS1000 displays a remarkable supercapacitive property with specific capacitance of 330.7 F g  &#8208;1  at 0.2 A g  &#8208;1  and long&#8208;term stability with capacitance retention of 97% over 50,000 cycles. Thus, a practical strategy for the production of mesoporous carbon materials with different morphological structures and porous defects as high&#8208;performance energy materials is advanced.</dc:description>

Fabrication of ultrathin and highly crystalline GDY film is of vital importance for studies of their intrinsic properties. This work reports the successful application of a liquid/liquid/gel system for confined synthesis of GDY film with high quality in a controllable way. After loading of the Au, the Au/GDY showed excellent performances in a nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR); the highest yield was 4.15&#8197;&#956;g&#8201;cm&#8722;2&#8201;h&#8722;1 with Faraday efficiency (FE) reaching 1.95&#8201;%.

      <title>Control over the Redox Cooperative Mechanism of Radical Carbene Transfer Reactions for the Efficient Active&#8208;Metal&#8208;Template Synthesis of [2]Rotaxanes</title>
      <dc:description>
Radical carbene transfer reactions promoted by macrocyclic CoII&#8211;porphyrinates bearing nitrogen&#8208;based axial ligands were used to assemble asymmetrical [2]rotaxanes through the active&#8208;metal&#8208;template technique. Careful control of the reaction conditions and proper choice of axial ligands enable formation of rotaxanes in up to 95% yield, while precluding formation of non&#8208;interlocked byproducts and total suppression of radical proton abstraction and carbene dimerization side reactions. The present study provides a detailed investigation on how to control the redox cooperative mechanism between the CoII ion in the porphyrin core and the radical carbene species to favor rotaxane formation.

More information can be found in the Full Paper by J.&#8197;D. Megiatto et&#8197;al. (DOI: &lt;a&gt;https://doi.org/10.1002/chem.20190560210.1002/chem.201905602&lt;/a&gt;).

However, the molecular mechanisms leading to a shift in catalytic activity optimum temperatures remain unclear, and there is increasing experimental evidence that thermal adaptation involves complex changes in both structural and reactive properties. Here we apply a combination of enhanced protein conformational sampling with an explicit chemical reaction description to mesophilic and thermophilic homologs of the dihydrofolate reductase enzyme, and obtain a quantitative description of the stability and catalytic activity shifts between homologs.&#160;
In contrast with pictures focusing on protein flexibility and dynamics, we reveal the key role played by temperature&#8208;induced shifts in protein conformational distributions; we show that while the homologs' reaction free energies are similar, the striking discrepancy between their activation energies is caused by their different conformational changes with temperature. We propose an analytic model combining catalytic activity and structural stability which quantitatively predicts the shift in homologs' optimum temperatures, and we show that this general model provides a molecular explanation of changes in optimum temperatures for several other&#160;enzymes.</dc:description>

      <title>Desymmetrization of C2&#8208;Symmetric Bis(Boronic Esters) by Zweifel Olefinations</title>
      <dc:description>
It's a crab! By combining the Hoppe, Matteson, Aggarwal, and Zweifel chemistry, a bidirectional access to polyketides featuring the challenging 1,3&#8208;deoxypropionate motif is presented. The desymmetrization of various 1,3&#8208;bis(boronic esters) led to synthetically interesting building blocks. With this reliable method the pheromones invictolide and serricornin were synthesized.







Abstract
anti&#8208;Configured 1,3&#8208;dimethyl deoxypropionate motifs are important sub structures in natural products. Herein, we describe a bidirectional approach for the rapid construction of natural products featuring such motifs by using C2&#8208;symmetrical 1,3&#8208;bis(boronic esters). As for its application in convergent syntheses it was important to establish a selective mono&#8208;Zweifel olefination we describe the scope and limitations by using different 1,3&#8208;bis(boronic esters) and nucleophiles. This protocol takes advantage of the combination of the Hoppe&#8211;Matteson&#8211;Zweifel chemistry, which was elegantly put into practice by Aggarwal et&#8197;al. In order to show its applicability the total syntheses of two natural products, serricornin and (+)&#8208;invictolide, were performed.

      <title>Boronate Ester&#8208;Capped Helicates</title>
      <dc:description>
Helicates with caps: Metal&#8208;templated multicomponent reactions of bispyridyloxime ligands with arylboronic acids give helicates with terminal arylboronate ester groups. The latter can be used to introduce functional groups such as pyridines, aldehydes, nitriles, and carboxylic acids in an apical position (see figure).







Abstract
Triple&#8208;stranded helicates were obtained by metal&#8208;templated multicomponent reactions of bispyridyloxime ligands with arylboronic acids. The helicates feature two hexa&#8208;coordinated MII ions (M=Fe, Zn, or Mn), which are embedded in a macrobicyclic ligand framework, and two arylboronate ester capping groups. The latter can be used to introduce functional groups such as pyridines, aldehydes, nitriles, and carboxylic acids in apical position. The functionalized helicates have the potential to be used as nanoscale building blocks for more complex assemblies, as evidenced by the synthesis of a 3&#8197;nm&#8208;sized trianglimine.

      <title>Control over the Redox Cooperative Mechanism of Radical Carbene Transfer Reactions for the Efficient Active&#8208;Metal&#8208;Template Synthesis of [2]Rotaxanes</title>
      <dc:description>
Controlling radical behavior: Manipulation of the redox cooperative properties of carbenoid species and CoII ions results in a powerful methodology for the synthesis of [2]rotaxanes through the active&#8208;metal&#8208;template technique.







Abstract
A 5,15&#8208;bis(1,1&#8242;&#8208;biphenyl)porphyrin&#8208;based molecular clip covalently connected to a ditopic aliphatic ester loop moiety yields a semi&#8208;rigid macrocycle with a well&#8208;defined cavity. The resulting macrocycle fits the structural requirements for the preparation of porphyrinates capable of promoting formation of C&#8722;C bonds. To demonstrate the usefulness of porphyrin&#8208;based macrocycles, an active&#8208;metal&#8208;template synthesis of rotaxanes through a redox non&#8208;innocent carbene transfer reaction is described. Coordination of CoII ions into the porphyrin subunit followed by addition of appropriate monodentate nitrogen&#8208;based additives to function as axial ligands enables the radical carbene transfer reactions to styrene derivatives to occur exclusively through the cavity of the macrocycle to afford cyclopropane&#8208;linked rotaxanes in excellent 95&#8201;% yield. Investigation of the product distribution afforded from the rotaxane assembly reaction reveals how the redox cooperative action between the carbene species and the CoII ions can be manipulated to gain control over the radical&#8208;type mechanism to favor the productive rotaxane forming process.

      <title>Zinc interactions with a soluble mutated rat amylin to mimic whole human amylin. An experimental and simulation approach to understand stoichiometry, speciation and coordination of the metal complexes</title>
      <dc:description>Islet Amyloid Polypeptide (IAPP) is a hormone co&#8208;secreted with insulin and zinc from pancreatic &#946;&#8208;cells. To overcome the low solubility of human IAPP, we characterized the zinc complexes species formed with: i) a mutated form of rat&#8208;IAPP(1&#8208;37;R18H) able to mimic the human IAPP; ii) the r&#8208;IAPP(1&#8208;37) and the IAPP(1&#8208;8) fragment. Stoichiometry, speciation and coordination features of zinc(II) complexes were unveiled by ESI&#8208;MS, potentiometric and NMR&#8208;based measurements combined with DFT and free&#8208;energy simulations. Mononuclear species start to form around pH 6; Zn  2+  binds both His18 and N&#8208;amino terminus in rat&#8208;IAPP(1&#8208;37; R18H).The in silico study allows us to assess not only a structured turn compact domain in r&#8208;IAPP(1&#8208;37) and r&#8208;IAPP(1&#8208;37;R18H) featured by a different free energy barrier for the transition from the compact to elongated conformation upon the coordination of Zn  2+  &#160;but also to bring into light a coordination shell further stabilized by non&#8208;covalent interactions.</dc:description>

Mononuclear species start to form around pH 6; Zn  2+  binds both His18 and N&#8208;amino terminus in rat&#8208;IAPP(1&#8208;37; R18H).The in silico study allows us to assess not only a structured turn compact domain in r&#8208;IAPP(1&#8208;37) and r&#8208;IAPP(1&#8208;37;R18H) featured by a different free energy barrier for the transition from the compact to elongated conformation upon the coordination of Zn  2+  &#160;but also to bring into light a coordination shell further stabilized by non&#8208;covalent interactions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Oxidized Hemithioindigo Photoswitches &#8208; Influence of Oxidation State on (Photo)physical and Photochemical Properties</title>
      <dc:description>The photophysical and photochemical properties of sulfoxide and sulfone derivatives of hemithioindigo photoswitches are scrutinized and compared to the unoxidized parent chromophores. Oxidation results in significantly blue&#8208;shifted absorptions and mostly reduction of photochromism while thermal stabilities of individual isomers remain largely unaltered. Effective photoswitching takes place at shorter wavelengths compared to parent hemithioindigos and high isomeric yields can be obtained reversibly in the respective photostationary states. Reversible solid state photoswitching is observed for a twisted sulfone derivative accompanied by visible color changes. These results establish oxidized hemithioindigo photoswitches as promising and versatile tools for robust light&#8208;control of molecular behavior for a wide range of applications.</dc:description>

      <title>Dual Acting Small&#8208;Molecule Inhibitors Targeting Mycobacterial DNA Replication</title>
      <dc:description>Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) is a pathogenic bacterium and a causative agent of tuberculosis (TB), a disease that kills more than 1.5 million people worldwide annually. One of the main reasons for this high mortality rate is the evolution of new Mtb strains that are resistant to available antibiotics. Therefore, new therapeutics for TB are in constant demand. Here we report the development of such inhibitors that target two DNA replication enzymes of Mtb, namely DnaG primase and DNA gyrase, which share a conserved TOPRIM fold near the inhibitors&#8217; binding site. The molecules were developed on the basis of previously reported inhibitors for T7 DNA primase that bind near the TOPRIM fold. In order to improve the physicochemical properties of the molecules as well as their inhibitory effect on primase and gyrase, 49 novel compounds were synthesized as potential drug candidates in three stages of optimization. The last stage of chemical optimization yielded two novel inhibitors for the fast&#8208;growing nonpathogenic model Mycobacterium smegmatis (Msmg).</dc:description>

Despite their significance, classical methods to synthesize such compounds demand either harsh reaction conditions, prefunctionalization of starting materials, highly sensitive organometallic reagents, or expensive transition metal catalysts.

      <title>(Iso)Quinoline&#8208;Artemisinin Hybrids via Click Chemistry: Highly Potent Agents against Viruses</title>
      <dc:description>Viral infections cause life&#8208;threatening diseases in millions of people worldwide every year and there is urgent need for new effective antiviral drugs. Hybridization of two chemically diverse compounds into a new bioactive effector product is a successful concept to improve the hybrid drug&#8217;s properties compared to its parent compounds. In this study, (iso)quinoline&#8208;artemisinin hybrids, obtained via copper&#8208;catalyzed azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC) or organocatalyzed click reactions (in organic solvents or in the presence of water), were analyzed in vitro for the first time for their inhibitory activity against human cytomegalovirus (HCMV), as compared with their parent compounds and the reference drug ganciclovir. EC50 (HCMV) values were obtained in a range 0.22&#8208;1.20 &#181;M, indicating highly potent antiviral properties in the absence of cytotoxic effects on normal cells (CC50 &gt;100 &#181;M). The most active hybrid 1 (EC50 = 0.22 &#181;M) is 25 times more potent than its parent compound artesunic acid (EC50 = 5.41 &#181;M) and 12 times more efficient than the standard drug ganciclovir (EC50 = 2.6 &#181;M). Interestingly, hybrid 1 shows also inhibitory activity against hepatitis B virus in vitro (EC50 (HBeAg) = 2.57 &#181;M).</dc:description>

Attachment of larger substituents attenuated the bioactivities. In vivo actin&#8208;binding studies with adherent mammalian cells showed that actin remains the likely intracellular target.

      <title>Frontispiece: Reactivity of Binary and Ternary Sulfur Halides towards Transition&#8208;Metal Compounds</title>
      <dc:description>
Binary sulfur fluorides exhibit an interesting reactivity towards transition metal complexes. They open up routes for the generation of sulfur&#8208;containing building blocks and ligands with particular properties can be constructed. This includes their ability to transfer sulfur atoms or polysulfide units as well as fluorination reactions. This Minireview by T. Braun et al. on page&#8197;6945&#8197;ff., provides an insight into the reactivity of the binary and ternary sulfur halides S2Cl2, SCl2, SF4, SF6, and SF5Cl towards transition metal compounds. In many recent studies the activation, depletion or derivatization of SF6 has been in focus, in part because the generation of sulfur fluoride&#8208;containing building blocks from SF6 might open up opportunities for the formation of sulfur&#8208;containing molecules and materials.

      <title>Ferroelectrically Switchable Axial Polarization in Columnar Liquid Crystalline Phases</title>
      <dc:description>
Up and down: The axial polarization formed by the one&#8208;dimensional stacking of polar groups can be ferroelectrically switched in response to an electric field, if its stability and dynamics are exquisitely balanced. This minireview presents an overview of ferroelectrically switchable columnar liquid crystals in terms of polar group design.







Abstract
Recently, ferroelectrically switchable columnar LCs have drawn a great deal of attention for their generation of rich polarization domains. Because of their unique dielectric and self&#8208;assembly properties, they are considered to be a promising material for the design of sensors and ultra&#8208;high memory devices. Herein, ferroelectrically switchable LCs by using ester, amide, and 1,2,3&#8208;triazole groups are reviewed. Most of them do not exhibit genuine ferroelectricity owing to the low energy barrier between the two polar states. The intermolecular interactions between polar groups strongly affect the switchability and stability of polarization. Therefore, it is challenging to balance these two competing factors to improve the ferroelectric function in columnar LCs. Overall, additional effort, including LC design and device fabrication, should be made to optimize the material performance for practical applications in the future.

      <title>Hydrazone&#8208;Linked Heptazine Polymeric Carbon Nitrides for Synergistic Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Driven Catalysis</title>
      <dc:description>
Synergistic effects: A novel and environmentally friendly method for preparing heptazine&#8208;based mesoporous polymeric carbon nitrides with hydrazone links formed through a simple Schiff base condensation and their photocatalytic activity in the visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven aerobic oxidation of benzyl alcohol is presented.







Abstract
Heptazine&#8208;based conjugated polymeric carbon nitrides (PCNs) are promising metal&#8208;free photocatalysts, yet their synthesis is challenging due to the electron&#8208;deficiency and insolubility of heptazine units. Indeed, heptazine&#8208;containing polymers have only been prepared through nucleophilic substitution with amines by using toxic cyameluric chloride as the starting material. Herein, we report the novel and environmentally friendly method for preparing heptazine&#8208;based mesoporous PCNs with hydrazone links formed through a simple Schiff base condensation of melem&#8208;NH2 and aldehydes. Unlike cyameluric chloride, melem&#8208;NH2 is non&#8208;toxic, stable, and can be readily obtained from melem and hydrazine in solution. We demonstrate that the hydrazone linkages and the heptazine units synergistically enhance the photocatalytic activity of PCNs in visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven aerobic oxidation of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde. In particular, the polymer constructed from melem&#8208;NH2 and p&#8208;phthalaldehyde shows 17&#8197;times more activity than graphitic carbon nitride (g&#8208;C3N4).

      <title>Phosphate Ion&#8208;Functionalized CoS with Hexagonal Bipyramid Structures from Metal&#8208;Organic Framework: Bifunctionality towards Supercapacitors and Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
      <dc:description>To solve energy&#8208;related environmental problems and energy crisis, efficient electrochemical materials have been developed as alternative energy storage and conversion systems. Abundant transition metals and their sulfides are attractive electrochemical materials. Herein, we reported an efficient phosphorization strategy, which improved the overall electrochemical performance of metal sulfides. In detail, CoS hexagonal bipyramids were synthesized through simple calcination combined with  in situ  sulfurization of a cobalt&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic framework template, and then phosphate ion&#8208;functionalized CoS (P&#8208;CoS) was prepared through a phosphorization reaction. P&#8208;CoS exhibited outstanding electrochemical activity as a bifunctional material,  i.e.  both supercapacitor electrode and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalyst. Supercapacitors based on CoS and P&#8208;CoS as the electrodes had high specific capacitances of 304 and 442 F g  &#8208;1  respectively, and remained stable after over 10000 cycles at 5 A g  &#8208;1  . For OER, P&#8208;CoS has a current density of 10 mA cm  &#8208;2  at overpotential of 340 mV, with a small Tafel slope.

Initially, the presence of a photocatalyst and a light source was needed to achieve gold oxidation with these electrophiles. However, recently it has been shown that in some instances just heating, light irradiation or the addition of certain bases and/or nucleophiles is enough. In this review, we summarized the transformations developed so far using aryldiazonium salts as electrophiles with special emphasis on mechanistic studies. The information gained by different authors, points that the specific steps of gold oxidation with aryldiazonium salts depends upon the activation mode of the diazonium salt.</dc:description>

      <title>Covalent attachment of active enzymes to upconversion phosphors allows ratiometric detection of substrates</title>

      <title>The mechanism of the intramolecular hydrocarbyl metathesis within a planar triruthenium cluster &#8211; combining core flexibility with hydride mobility</title>
      <dc:description>The formation and cleavage of C&#8208;C bonds is of utmost importance in synthetic chemistry. While most of the existing homogeneous catalysts are mononuclear, knowledge of the behavior of polynuclear species is much more limited. By using computational methods, here we shed light into the mechanism of the thermally induced isomerization of Cp*3Ru3(&#956;&#8208;H)2(&#956;3&#8208;&#951;2&#8208;pentyne)(&#956;3&#8208;pentylidyne) (2) into Cp*3Ru3(&#956;&#8208;H)2(&#956;3&#8208;&#951;2&#8208;octyne)(&#956;3&#8208;ethylidyne) (3), a process that involves the migration of a C3  fragment between the hydrocarbyl ligands and across the plane formed by the three Ru centers. Our results show this to be a complex transformation that comprises of five individual rearrangements in an  A&#8208;B&#8208;A&#8208;B&#8208;A  order. Each rearrangement A  consists of the CH migration from the &#956;3&#8208;&#951;2&#8208;alkyne into the &#956;3&#8208;alkylidine ligand in the other side of the Ru3  plane. This process is facilitated by the cluster&#8217;s ability to adopt open&#8208;core structures in which one Ru&#8208;Ru bond is broken and a new C&#8208;C bond is formed. On the contrary, rearrangements B  do not involve the formation of C&#8208;C bonds nor do they require the opening of the cluster core. Instead, they consist of the isomerization of the &#956;3&#8208;&#951;2&#8208;alkyne and &#956;3&#8208;alkylidyne ligands on each side of the Ru&#8323; plane into &#956;3&#8208;alkylidyne and &#956;3&#8208;&#951;2&#8208;alkyne, respectively. This implies the migration of three H atoms within the hydrocarbyl ligands, and it is aided by the cluster&#8217;s ability to behave as a H reservoir. All in all, this study highlights the plasticity of these structures, whereby Ru&#8208;Ru, Ru&#8208;C, Ru&#8208;H, C&#8208;C, and C&#8208;H bonds are formed and broken with surprising ease.</dc:description>

      <title>Enhanced the electrochemical performance of high voltage LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4&#160;cathode in carbonate based electrolyte by a novel and low cost functional additive</title>
      <dc:description>Butyric anhydride (BA) is used as an effective functional additive to improve the electrochemical performance of high voltage LiNi  0.5  Mn  1.5  O  4  (LNMO) cathode. In presence of 0.5 wt.% BA, the capacity retention of LNMO/Li cell is significantly improved from 15.3 % to 88.4 % after 200 cycles at 1 C. Furthermore, the rate performance of LNMO/Li cell is also effectively enhanced and the capacity is up to 112 m Ah g  &#8208;1  even at 5 C, which is considerably higher than that LNMO/Li cell in electrolyte without BA additive (95.4 m Ah g  &#8208;1  at 5 C). Linear sweep voltammetry and cyclic voltammetry results reveal that the BA additive can be preferentially oxidized to construct a stable cathode electrolyte interphase (CEI) film upon the LNMO cathode. Subsequently, the BA&#8208;derived CEI film can alleviate the decomposition of the electrolyte and the dissolution of Mn and Ni ions from LNMO cathode as well as maintain the structural stability of LNMO cathode during the cycling process, which leads to outstanding electrochemical performance. Therefore, this work provides an effective and low&#8208;cost functional electrolyte for high&#8208;voltage LNMO&#8208;based LIBs.</dc:description>

      <title>Visible Light&#8208;Enabled sp3&#8208;C&#8208;H Functionalization with Chloro&#8208; and Bromoalkynes: Chemoselective Route to Vinylchlorides or Alkynes</title>
      <dc:description>An unprecedented direct atom&#8208;economic chemo&#8208; and regioselective hydroalkylation of chloroalkynes and an sp3&#8208;C,H alkynylation of bromoalkynes was achieved, reaction partners are unfunctionalized ethers, alcohols, amides, and even non&#8208;activated hydrocarbons. We found that a household fluorescent bulb was able to excite diaryl ketone, which then selectively abstracts a H atom from an sp3&#8208;C&#8208;H bond. The product of formal alkyne insertion into the sp3&#8208;C&#8208;H bond was obtained with chloroalkynes, providing valuable vinyl chlorides.

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;An unprecedented direct atom&#8208;economic chemo&#8208; and regioselective hydroalkylation of chloroalkynes and an sp3&#8208;C,H alkynylation of bromoalkynes was achieved, reaction partners are unfunctionalized ethers, alcohols, amides, and even non&#8208;activated hydrocarbons. We found that a household fluorescent bulb was able to excite diaryl ketone, which then selectively abstracts a H atom from an sp3&#8208;C&#8208;H bond. The product of formal alkyne insertion into the sp3&#8208;C&#8208;H bond was obtained with chloroalkynes, providing valuable vinyl chlorides. The photo&#8208;organocatalytic hydrogen atom transfer strategy gives rise to a broad range of diversely functionalized olefins.

      <title>Electronic Finetuning of 8&#8208;Methoxy Psoralens by Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Coupling: Acidochromicity and Solvatochromicity</title>
      <dc:description>
A diverse and colorful library of novel psoralens can be obtained by cross&#8208;coupling reactions of 5&#8208;bromo&#8208;8&#8208;methoxypsoralen, which was prepared by a novel multistep synthesis. Photophysical properties, such as emission solvatochromicity and acidochromicity make this class of functional chromophores particularly attractive.







Abstract
Differently 5&#8208;substituted 8&#8208;methoxypsoralens can be synthesized by an efficient synthetic route with various cross&#8208;coupling methodologies, such as Suzuki, Sonogashira and Heck reaction. Compared to previously synthesized psoralens, thereby promising daylight absorbing compounds as potentially active agents against certain skin diseases can be readily accessed. Extensive investigations of all synthesized psoralen derivatives reveal fluorescence in the solid state as well as several distinctly emissive derivatives in solution. Donor&#8208;substituted psoralens exhibit remarkable photophysical properties, such as high fluorescence quantum yields and pronounced emission solvatochromicity and acidochromicity, which were scrutinized by Lippert&#8211;Mataga and Stern&#8211;Volmer plots. The results indicate that the compounds exceed the limit of visible light, a significant factor for potential applications as an active agent. In addition, (TD)DFT calculations were performed to elucidate the underlying electronic structure and to assign experimentally obtained data.

      <title>A Phosphinine&#8208;Derived 1&#8208;Phospha&#8208;7&#8208;Bora&#8208;Norbornadiene: Frustrated Lewis Pair Type Activation of Triple Bonds</title>
      <dc:description>
Just like an FLP: A hetero&#8208;norbornadiene incorporating phosphorus and boron atoms is accessible by a facile salt metathesis procedure. Although this compound represents a classical Lewis acid&#8211;base adduct, its reactivity is reminiscent of frustrated Lewis pairs. Reactions with nitriles and alkynes afford unusual insertion and 1,4&#8208;addition products. In both cases, reversible P&#8722;B bond dissociation is of key mechanistic significance.







Abstract
Salt metathesis of 1&#8208;methyl&#8208;2,4,6&#8208;triphenylphosphacyclohexadienyl lithium and chlorobis(pentafluorophenyl)borane affords a 1&#8208;phospha&#8208;7&#8208;bora&#8208;norbornadiene derivative 2. The C&#8801;N triple bonds of nitriles insert into the P&#8722;B bond of 2 with concomitant C&#8722;B bond cleavage, whereas the C&#8801;C bonds of phenylacetylenes react with 2 to form &#955;4&#8208;phosphabarrelenes. Even though 2 must formally be regarded as a classical Lewis adduct, the C&#8801;N and C&#8801;C activation processes observed (and the mild conditions under which they occur) are reminiscent of the reactivity of frustrated Lewis pairs. Indeed, NMR and computational studies give insight into the mechanism of the reactions and reveal the labile nature of the phosphorus&#8211;boron bond in 2, which is also suggested by detailed NMR spectroscopic studies on this compound. Nitrile insertion is thus preceded by ring opening of the bicycle of 2 through P&#8722;B bond splitting with a low energy barrier. By contrast, the reaction with alkynes involves formation of a reactive zwitterionic methylphosphininium borate intermediate, which readily undergoes alkyne 1,4&#8208;addition.

      <title>Unusual Structures of the Parent Molecules Diarsene, Distibene, and Dibismuthene. Toward Their Observation</title>
      <dc:description>There is considerable interest, from both experimental and theoretical perspectives, in molecules incorporating multiple bonds between main group elements. Herein, we not only consider the parent molecules HE=EH (E = As, Sb, Bi), but also a number of their isomers. For each E2 H2 molecule, a number of different structures were optimized with four different DFT methods. Final structures were determined with the coupled cluster method CCSD(T) using large basis sets, namely cc&#8208;pVQZ&#8208;PP, incorporating relativistic psuedopotentials. All feasible dissociation pathways are examined. For all three E2H2 molecules the trans isomer lies lowest in energy, with the cis isomer higher by 2.7 (As), 2.1 (Sb), and 1.8 (Bi) kcal/mol, respectively. However, both cis and trans structures should be observable, as large barriers (27.7, 20.5, and 17.7 kcal/mol) separate them. For both the cis and tran s structures, in the infrared the strong E&#8208;H stretching frequencies should also be observable. Only the cis structures have dipole moments (0.62, 0.01, and 0.83 debye, respectively), and their observation by microwave spectroscopy would be stunning. Also considered were the higher energy vinylidene&#8208;like, pyramidal, monobridged, and linear structures. We conclude that molecules such as HSb=SbH&#8208;Fe(CO)4, HBi=BiH&#8208;Fe(CO)4, and related systems, should be feasible synthetic targets.</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;There is considerable interest, from both experimental and theoretical perspectives, in molecules incorporating multiple bonds between main group elements. Herein, we not only consider the parent molecules HE=EH (E = As, Sb, Bi), but also a number of their isomers. For each E2 H2 molecule, a number of different structures were optimized with four different DFT methods. Final structures were determined with the coupled cluster method CCSD(T) using large basis sets, namely cc&#8208;pVQZ&#8208;PP, incorporating relativistic psuedopotentials. All feasible dissociation pathways are examined. For all three E2H2 molecules the trans isomer lies lowest in energy, with the cis isomer higher by 2.7 (As), 2.1 (Sb), and 1.8 (Bi) kcal/mol, respectively. However, both cis and trans structures should be observable, as large barriers (27.7, 20.5, and 17.7 kcal/mol) separate them. For both the cis and tran s structures, in the infrared the strong E&#8208;H stretching frequencies should also be observable. Only the cis structures have dipole moments (0.62, 0.01, and 0.83 debye, respectively), and their observation by microwave spectroscopy would be stunning. Also considered were the higher energy vinylidene&#8208;like, pyramidal, monobridged, and linear structures. We conclude that molecules such as HSb=SbH&#8208;Fe(CO)4, HBi=BiH&#8208;Fe(CO)4, and related systems, should be feasible synthetic targets.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Multipolar Porphyrin&#8208;Triazatruxene Arrays for Two&#8208;Photon Fluorescence Cell Imaging</title>
      <dc:description>Two&#8208;photon excited fluorescent (TPEF) materials are highly desirable for bioimaging applications owing to their unique characteristics of deep&#8208;tissue penetration and high spatiotemporal resolution. Herein, by connecting one, two, or three electron&#8208;deficient zinc porphyrin units to an electron&#8208;rich triazatruxene core via ethynyl &#960;&#8208;bridges, conjugated multipolar molecules  TAT&#8208;(ZnP)  n  (n = 1&#8208;3) were developed as TPEF materials for cell imaging. The three new dyes present high fluorescence quantum yields (0.40&#8208;0.47) and rationally improved two&#8208;photon absorption (TPA) properties. In particular, the peak TPA cross section of  TAT&#8208;ZnP  (436 GM) is significantly larger than that of the  ZnP  reference (59 GM). The  &#948;  TPA  values of  TAT&#8208;(ZnP)  2  and  TAT&#8208;(ZnP)  3  further increase to 1031 and up to 1496 GM respectively, indicating the effect of incorporated ZnP units on the TPA properties. The substantial improvement of the TPEF properties is attributed to the formation of &#960;&#8208;conjugated quadrapole/octupole molecules and the extension of D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A&#8208;D systems, which has been rationalized by density function theory (DFT) calculations. Moreover, all of the three new dyes display good biocompatibility and preferential targeting ability toward cytomembrane, thus can be superior candidates for TPEF imaging of living cells. Overall, this work demonstrated a promising strategy for the development of porphyrin&#8208;based TPEF materials by the construction and extension of D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A&#8208;D multipolar array.</dc:description>

      <title>Partially fluorinated copolymers as oxygen sensitive 19F MRI agents</title>
      <dc:description>19  F magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is an promising emerging imaging modality.

The synthesis of a systematic library of partially fluorinated copolymers enabled a comprehensive evaluation of copolymer structure&#8211;property relationships relevant to  19  F MRI. The highest&#8208;performing material composition demonstrated a signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio that corresponded to an apparent  19  F density of 220 mM, which surpasses the threshold of 126 mM  19  F required for visualization on a three Tesla clinical MRI.

      <title>FeIII and FeII Phosphasalen Complexes: Synthesis, Characterization, and Catalytic Application for 2&#8208;Naphtol Oxidative Coupling</title>
      <dc:description>We report on the synthesis and characterization of three iron(III) phosphasalen complexes,  [Fe  III  (Psalen)(X)]  differing in the nature of the counter&#8208;anion/exogenous ligand (X  &#8208;  = Cl  &#8208;  , NO  3  &#8208;  , OTf  &#8208;  ), as well as the neutral iron(II) analogue,  [Fe  II  (Psalen)]  . Phosphasalen (Psalen) differs from salen by the presence of iminophosphorane (P=N) functions in place of the imines. All the complexes were characterized by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, UV&#8208;vis, EPR, and cyclic voltammetry. The [Fe  II  (Psalen)] complex was shown to remain tetracoordinated even in coordinating solvent but exhibits surprisingly a magnetic moment in line with a Fe  II  high spin ground state. For the Fe  III  complexes, the higher lability of triflate anion compared to nitrate was demonstrated. As they exhibit lower reduction potentials compared to their salen analogues, these complexes were tested for the coupling of 2&#8208;naphtol using O  2  from air as oxidant. In order to shed light on this reaction, the interaction between 2&#8208;napthol and the Fe  III  (Psalen) complexes was studied by cyclic voltammetry as well as UV&#8208;vis spectrosocopy.</dc:description>

      <title>Selective Release of Doxorubicin from Cucurbit[8]uril Stabilized Gold Supra&#8208;pyramid&#160;Host at pH of Small Intestine</title>
      <dc:description>Gold supra&#8208;pyramid structures were obtained by the addition of acidic solution of cucurbit[8]uril (CB[8]) to an aqueous solution of citrate stabilized gold nanoparticles (AuNP). The reaction resulted in the precipitation of supra&#8208;pyramid from the solution just after 1 min of shaking. Microscopic images confirmed formation of supra&#8208;pyramid. The stepwise structural transformation towards supra&#8208;pyramid was examined with variable concentration of CB[8] to AuNP solution. Anionic counter parts of these acids (Br&#8211;, NO3&#8211;, SO42&#8211;&#160;and Cl&#8211;) controlled the size of the synthesized supra&#8208;pyramids. These supra&#8208;pyramid hosts showed uptake of three anticancer drugs: oral drugs etoposide, prednisolone and intravenous drug doxorubicin. Releases of drugs from these hosts were emulated at acidic stomach pH, basic small intestinal pH and in presence of human serum albumin (HSA). The specific release of doxorubicin was confirmed at small intestinal pH 7.4. Poor release of drugs in presence of CB[8] specific guest 1&#8208;adamantanamine confirmed the role of supra&#8208;pyramid as exclusive host. The release of doxorubicin from supra&#8208;pyramid at pH 7.4 was confirmed by fluorescence microscopic imaging with prostate cancer DU&#8208;145 cell line.</dc:description>

The reaction resulted in the precipitation of supra&#8208;pyramid from the solution just after 1 min of shaking. Microscopic images confirmed formation of supra&#8208;pyramid. The stepwise structural transformation towards supra&#8208;pyramid was examined with variable concentration of CB[8] to AuNP solution. Anionic counter parts of these acids (Br&#8211;, NO3&#8211;, SO42&#8211;&#160;and Cl&#8211;) controlled the size of the synthesized supra&#8208;pyramids. These supra&#8208;pyramid hosts showed uptake of three anticancer drugs: oral drugs etoposide, prednisolone and intravenous drug doxorubicin. Releases of drugs from these hosts were emulated at acidic stomach pH, basic small intestinal pH and in presence of human serum albumin (HSA). The specific release of doxorubicin was confirmed at small intestinal pH 7.4. Poor release of drugs in presence of CB[8] specific guest 1&#8208;adamantanamine confirmed the role of supra&#8208;pyramid as exclusive host. The release of doxorubicin from supra&#8208;pyramid at pH 7.4 was confirmed by fluorescence microscopic imaging with prostate cancer DU&#8208;145 cell line.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Highly Elastic Slide&#8208;Ring Hydrogel with Good Recovery as Stretchable Supercapacitor</title>
      <dc:description>As a new material with excellent mechanical properties and good stability, slide&#8208;ring gels have attracted more and more attention and research. However, it cannot be widely used due to its relatively complicated synthesis. Herein, we use 6&#8211;acrylamidomethylether&#8208;modified &#945;&#8208;cyclodextrin (&#945;CDAAmMe) and PEG 20000 diacrylate (PEG 20000 DA) to construct a polypseudorotaxane. Then, the polypseudorotaxane reacts with acrylamide via a photo&#8208;initiated polymerization in&#8208;situ to conveniently obtain a slide&#8208;ring hydrogel with good elastic property and high recovery property. That is, the hydrogel can be easily stretched to 22.5 times of its original length but recovered rapidly and almost reversibly. These results enable the application of hydrogel to make an intrinsically stretchable and compressible supercapacitor after doping ions and the adhesion of commercially available carbon nanotube (CNT) paper as electrodes, giving the ionic conductivity as 17.0 mS/cm (comparable to that of the commercial PVA/H3PO4 electrolyte) and the capacitance as 0.87 uF/cm2 (at the scan speed of 100 mV/s), and its capacitance can be further enhanced under the stretching.</dc:description>

      <title>Unraveling Benignant Microstructure Evolution in Pyrite for Boosted Lithium Storage Performance</title>
      <dc:description>Pyrite FeS2 as a high&#8208;capacity electrode material for lithium ion batteries (LIBs) is hindered by its unstable cycling performance due to the large volume change and irreversible phase segregation from coarsening of Fe. Here, we unravel the benignant microstructure evolution in MoS2&#8208;modified FeS2 as an anode for LIBs during the cycling process that is responsible for its significantly boosted lithium storage performances. Specifically, the FeS2/MoS2 displays a long cycle life with a capacity retention of 116% after 600 cycles at 0.5 A g&#8208;1, which is the best among the reported FeS2&#8208;based materials so far. A series of electrochemical tests and structural characterizations substantially revealed that the introduced MoS2 in FeS2 experiences an irreversible electrochemical reaction and thus the in&#8208;situ formed metallic Mo could act as the conductive buffer layer to accelerate the dynamics of Li+ diffusion and electron transport. More importantly, it can guarantee the highly reversible conversion in lithiated FeS2 by preventing Fe coarsening. This work provides a fundamental understanding and an effective strategy towards the microstructure evolution for boosting lithium storage performances for other metal sulfide&#8208;based materials.</dc:description>

      <title>Separating Growth from Nucleation for Facile Control over the Size and Shape of Palladium Nanocrystals</title>
      <dc:description>In order to maximize the performance of nanocrystals in a specific application, it is necessary to control both their size and shape. Here we report a one&#8208;pot protocol that allows us to separate growth from nucleation for achieving better controls over the size and shape of Pd nanocrystals. The two processes are temporally separated from each other, although the synthesis is carried out in the same reaction container. Size control is achieved by simply varying the ratio between the amounts of precursor allocated to the growth and nucleation processes. With the involvement of seeds at a fixed number, increasing the amount of precursor for growth leads to increasingly larger nanocrystals. Shape control is made possible by varying the capping agent, with bromide leading to a cubic shape and citrate inducing the formation of an octahedral shape. The synthesis can also be scaled up by at least 10&#8208;fold without compromising the quality.</dc:description>

      <title>Triquinoline vs Fullerene based cycloparaphenylene ionic complexes. Comparison of photoinduced charge&#8208;shift reactions.</title>
      <dc:description>A triquinoline cationic moiety (TQ&#8226;H+) has recently been designed as a novel molecular unit for supramolecular chemistry. In addition to some useful features, TQ&#8226;H+ has strong electron acceptor properties which make the molecular cation to be a unique element in nano&#8208;chemistry. TQ&#8226;H+ is found to form complexes with coronene (COR) and cycloparaphenylene (CPP). In this work, we report a computational study of photoinduced electron transfer (PET) in supramolecular complexes TQ&#8226;H+&#8211;COR, TQ&#8226;H+&#8834;[12]CPP and (TQ&#8226;H+&#8211;COR)&#8834;[12]CPP. The electron transfer rates are estimated by using the semi&#8208;classical approach. The calculation results are compared with the data previously obtained for a structurally similar inclusion complex Li+@C60&#8834;[10]CPP. In particular, we find a red solvatochromic shift for charge&#8208;shift bands in the TQ&#8226;H+&#8208;complexes unlike a blue shift showed by Li+@C60&#8834;[10]CPP. This distinction is explored in terms of electronic and structural features of the systems.</dc:description>

      <title>Activity&#8208;directed synthesis of inhibitors of the p53/hDM2 protein&#8208;protein interaction</title>
      <dc:description>Protein&#8208;protein interactions (PPIs) provide a rich source of potential targets for drug discovery and biomedical science research.  However, the identification of structural&#8208;diverse starting points for discovery of PPI inhibitors remains a significant challenge.  Activity&#8208;directed synthesis (ADS), a function&#8208;driven discovery approach, was harnessed in the discovery of the p53/hDM2 PPI.  Over two rounds of ADS, 346 microscale reactions were performed, with prioritisation on the basis of the activity of the resulting product mixtures.  Four distinct and novel series of PPI inhibitors were discovered that, through biophysical characterisation, were shown to have promising ligand efficiencies.  It was thus shown that ADS can facilitate ligand discovery for a target that does not have a defined small&#8208;molecule binding site, and can provide distinctive starting points for the discovery of PPI inhibitors.</dc:description>

      <title>Catalytic activity of alkali metal cations for chemical oxygen reduction reaction in a biphasic liquid system probed by scanning electrochemical microscopy</title>
      <dc:description>Chemical reduction of dioxygen in organic solvents for the production reactive oxygen species or the concomitant oxidation of organic substrates can be enhanced in by separation of products and educts in biphasic liquid systems. Here, we study the coupled electron and ion transfer processes as well as reagent fluxes across the liquid&#8208;liquid interface for the chemical reduction of dioxygen by decamethylferrocene (DMFc) in a dichloroethane&#8208;based organic electrolyte forming an interface with an aqueous electrolyte containing alkali metal ions. This interface is stabilized at the orifice of a pipette, across which a Galvani potential difference is externally applied and precisely adjusted in order to enforce the transfer of different alkali metal ions from the aqueous to the organic electrolyte. The oxygen reduction is followed by H  2  O  2  detection in the aqueous phase close to the interface by a microelectrode of a scanning electrochemical microscope (SECM). The results prove a strong catalytic effect of hydrated alkali metal ions on the formation rate of H  2  O  2  which varies systematically with the acidity of the transferred alkali metal ions in the organic phase.</dc:description>

      <title>Synthesis of chiral MOF&#8208;74 frameworks by post&#8208;synthetic modification using an amino acid</title>
      <dc:description>The synthesis of chiral metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) is highly relevant for asymmetric heterogenous catalysis, yet very challenging. Chiral MOFs with MOF&#8208;74 topology were synthesized using post&#8208;synthetic modification with proline. Vibrational circular dichroism studies demonstrate that proline is the source of chirality. The solvents used in the synthesis play a key role in tuning the loading of proline and its interaction with the MOF&#8208;74 framework. In N,N&#8217;&#8208;dimethylformamide, proline coordinates monodentate to the Zn  2+  ions within the MOF&#8208;74 framework, whilst it is only weakly bound to the framework when using methanol as solvent. Introducing chirality within the MOF&#8208;74 framework also leads to the formation of defects, with both the organic linker and metal ions missing from the framework. The formation of defects combined with the coordination of DMF and proline within the framework leads to a pore blocking effect. This is confirmed by adsorption studies and testing of the chiral MOFs in the asymmetric aldol reaction between acetone and  para  &#8208;nitrobenzaldehyde.</dc:description>

      <title>Flavonoids with Vicinal Hydroxyl Groups Inhibit Human Calcitonin Amyloid Formation</title>
      <dc:description>Human calcitonin (hCT) is a 32&#8208;residue peptide hormone that can aggregate into amyloid fibrils and cause cellular toxicity. In this study, we investigated the inhibition effects of a group of polyphenolic molecules on hCT amyloid formation. Our results suggest that the gallate moiety in epigallocatechin&#8208;3&#8208;gallate (EGCG), a well&#8208;recognized amyloid inhibitor, is not critical for its inhibition activity of the hCT amyloid formation. Our results demonstrate that the flavonoid compounds such as myricetin, quercetin, and baicalein that contain vicinal hydroxyl groups on the phenyl ring effectively prevent hCT fibrillization. This structural feature can also be applied to non&#8208;flavonoid polyphenolic inhibitors. Moreover, our results indicate a plausible mechanistic role of these vicinal hydroxyl groups which might include the oxidation to form a quinone and the subsequent Schiff base formation with the lysine or histidine residues of hCT. This may further disrupt the crucial electrostatic and aromatic interactions involved in the process of hCT amyloid fibril formation. The inhibition activity of the polyphenolic compounds against hCT fibril formation may likely be attributed to a combination of factors such as Schiff base formation, aromatic stacking, and hydrogen bonding interactions.</dc:description>

      <title>Importance of Methane Chemical Potential for Its Conversion to Methanol on Cu&#8208;Exchanged Mordenite</title>
      <dc:description>
Tricopper&#8208;oxo clusters [Cu3(&#956;&#8208;O)3]2+ hosted in mordenite can selectively oxidize methane to methanol but yields are limited. At standard pressure, one cluster reacts with one CH4 molecule. Elevated methane pressure increased the chemical potential of methane by enabling the activation of two CH4 molecules by two &#956;&#8208;O atoms out of the three contained in a [Cu3(&#956;&#8208;O)3]2+, thus doubling the yield of methanol. More information can be found in the Full Paper by J. Zheng, M. Sanchez&#8208;Sanchez, J.&#8197;A.&#8197;Lercher et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202000772).

      <title>A Cornucopia of Iridium Nitrogen Compounds Produced from Laser&#8208;Ablated Iridium Atoms and Dinitrogen</title>
      <dc:description>
Iridium, the &#8220;rainbow&#8221; element, is the element with the highest attainable formal oxidation state of +IX. The goal of this work was to produce neutral Ir+IXN3 by reacting excited iridium atoms with dinitrogen. This reaction leads to a cornucopia of iridium nitrogen compounds identified by FTIR spectroscopy under cryogenic conditions. Quantum chemical calculations give insight to their electronic structure. The product molecules are discussed with emphases on oxidation states and dinitrogen activation. More information can be found in the Full Paper by S.&#8197;Riedel et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.201905514).

      <title>Multivariate Analysis of Coupled Operando EPR/XANES/EXAFS/UV&#8211;Vis/ATR&#8208;IR Spectroscopy: A New Dimension for Mechanistic Studies of Catalytic Gas&#8208;Liquid Phase Reactions</title>
      <dc:description>
Four eyes see more than two: Operando EPR, XANES/EXAFS, ATR&#8208;IR, and UV/Vis spectroscopy have been coupled in the same experiment to complete the mechanistic puzzle in selective aerobic alcohol oxidation by a copper&#8208;TEMPO catalyst. The reaction is driven by a single CuI/CuII redox cycle that activates O2 with the help of TEMPO. Dimeric CuII&#8211;CuII species have no catalytic impact since they dissolve in the early stage of the reaction without activity loss. More information can be found in the Full Paper by J. Rabeah, V. Briois, A. Br&#252;ckner, et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202000436).

      <dc:description>
Surface deactivated (only pore&#8208;active) core&#8211;shell&#8208;type MOF (metal&#8211;organic framework) catalysts for aerobic oxidation of alcohols were synthesized via a simple postsynthetic ligand exchange (PSE) method. They contain TEMPO groups on the ligand as active sites at the core. The highly porous but catalytically inactive shell ensured the substrate size&#8208;selective permeability by sieving effects and induced all reactions to take place in the pore of the catalytically active core.
