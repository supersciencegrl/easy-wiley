         <title>Organic two&#8208;photon&#8208;absorbing photosensitizers can overcome competing light absorption in organic photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Conventional organic photocatalysis typically relies on ultraviolet and short&#8208;wavelength visible photons as the energy source. However, this approach often suffers from competing light absorption by reactants, products, intermediates, and co&#8208;catalysts, leading to reduced quantum efficiency and side reactions. To address this issue, we developed novel organic two&#8208;photon&#8208;absorbing (TPA) photosensitizers capable of functioning under deep red and near&#8208;infrared light irradiation. Three model reactions including cyclization, Sonogashira Csp2&#8208;Csp cross&#8208;coupling, and Csp2&#8208;N cross&#8208;coupling reactions were selected to compare the performance of the new photosensitizers under both blue (427 nm) and deep red (660 nm) light irradiation. The obtained results unambiguously prove that for reactions involving blue light&#8208;absorbing reactants, products, and/or co&#8208;catalysts, deep red light source resulted in better performance than blue light when utilizing our TPA photosensitizers. This work highlights the potential of our metal&#8208;free TPA photosensitizers as a sustainable and effective solution to mitigate the competing light absorption issue in photocatalysis, not only expanding the scope of organic photocatalysts but also reducing reliance on expensive Ru/Ir/Os&#8208;based photosensitizers.</dc:description>

         <title>Asymmetric Kinetic Resolution Polymerization of Racemic Lactide Mediated by Axial&#8208;Chiral Thiourea/Phosphazene Binary Organocatalyst</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The simple and effective binary organocatalytic pairs, associating axial&#8208;chiral thiourea organocatalysts and phosphazene bases, allow for both high polymerization activity and moderate enantioselectivity (kD/kL=18.1) for the AKRP of rac&#8208;LA at room temperature, yielding semi&#8208;crystalline and metal&#8208;free stereoblock PLA with a melting temperature as high as 186&#8201;&#176;C.







Abstract
Asymmetric kinetic resolution polymerization (AKRP) provides an ideal way to obtain highly isotactic polylactide (PLA) with superior thermal&#8208;mechanical properties from racemic lactide (rac&#8208;LA). However, the development of a new catalytic system with concurrent high activity and selectivity at ambient temperature remains a great callenge. Here, a series of simple and effective binary organocatalytic pairs containing axial&#8208;chiral thioureas and commercially available phosphazene bases were designed. These chiral binary organocatalytic pairs allow for both high polymerization activity and moderate enantioselectivity for AKRP of rac&#8208;LA at room temperature, yielding semi&#8208;crystalline and metal&#8208;free stereoblock PLA with a melting temperature as high as 186&#8201;&#176;C. The highest kinetic resolution coefficient (krel) of 8.5 at 47&#8201;% conversion was obtained, and D&#8208;LA was preferentially polymerized via kinetic resolution with a maximum selectivity factor (kD/kL) of 18.1, indicating that an enantiomorphic site control mechanism (ESC) was involved.

         <title>The Hydronaphthalide Monoanion: Isolation of the &#8220;red transient&#8221; Birch Intermediate from liquid Ammonia</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present the isolation and full characterisation of a reactive intermediate from the Birch reduction which was first observed in 1939.The historically as transient described compound was isolated as an organic salt from the reaction of naphthalene, sodium, and tetramethylammonium chloride in liquid ammonia. The trapped intermediate demonstrates a tamed reduction potential enabling higher reaction control compared to stronger reducing agents.







Abstract
Birch reactions employing alkali metals in ammonia have been a well&#8208;established method for the reduction and functionalisation of aromatic compounds for nearly 100&#8197;years. Speculations regarding intermediates in the reaction pathway have been discussed since the beginning. We hereby report the isolation of NMe4(HNaph) (1), a kinetically trapped intermediate of the Birch reaction of naphthalene and sodium in liquid ammonia. 1 has been fully characterised and has been shown to continue to react to 1,2/1,4&#8208;dihydronaphthalene &#8211; the Birch product of the reduction of naphthalene. The reactivity of 1 was investigated towards activity as an electron and hydride transfer agent with both, elements and small organic molecules. 1 demonstrates a tamed reduction potential which allows for controlled reactions such as the selective formation of hexasulphide and hexaselenide anions.

         <title>Chalcogen Bonding in Selective Recognition and Liquid&#8208;Liquid Extraction of Perrhenate</title>

Potent tetrapodal Se&#8208;based ChB receptors selectively extract ReO4&#8722; from 100&#8201;% water medium, employing both precipitation and LLE method.







Abstract
Efficient recognition and extraction of hazardous anionic pollutants from water medium is of great significance for environmental concerns, representing a challenging area of research in supramolecular chemistry. In this study, we present, for the first time, a comprehensive demonstration of the ability of chalcogen bonding (ChB) to recognize and remove the ReO4&#8722; from 100&#8201;% water medium. The anion recognition ability is well elucidated through solution phase NMR and ITC studies, which clearly reveal the selective binding of ReO4&#8722; over other oxo&#8208;anions. Moreover, the selenoimidazolium scaffold effectively engages in Se&#8226;&#8226;&#8226;O ChB interaction with ReO4&#8722; as confirmed by X&#8208;ray crystal structure and XPS analysis. More importantly, the binding of ReO4&#8722; with different prolongations of the &#963;&#8211;holes, along with Se&#8226;&#8226;&#8226;Se chalcogen bonding interactions, lead to the formation of a 1D supramolecular assembly. Eventually, ChB receptor Se4Me&#8722;Br exhibits ~62&#8201;% ReO4&#8722; extraction efficiency through precipitation as the extraction method. Furthermore, in efforts to enhance efficiency, a hydrophobic ChB receptor Se4Do&#8208;PF6 has been prepared, achieving an efficiency of up to ~93&#8201;% at a very low concentration (~5&#8197;ppm) by liquid&#8208;liquid extraction.

         <title>Tuning Energetics of 2&#8201;e&#8722;/2H+ PCET Properties with Model Ru&#8208;bisamido Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fine&#8208;tuning of electronic structures allows control over energetic parameters in a family of complexes that undergo multi&#8208;redox 2e&#8722;/2H+ processes. The orbital overlap gives structural energy stabilization for potential inversion.







Abstract
Most redox processes that break/form bonds involve net 2e&#8722; changes, and many are coupled to protons. Yet most proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET) studies focus on 1e&#8722;/1H+ reactions. Reported here is a family of molecular models that undergo tunable 2e&#8722;/2H+ redox changes. Complexes [(X2bpy)RuII(en*)2](PF6)2 and [(X2bpy)RuIV(en*&#8208;H)2](PF6)2 have been synthesized with bpy=2,2&#8217;&#8208;bipyridine with 4,4&#8217;&#8208;subtitutions X=&#8722;NMe2, &#8722;OMe, &#8722;Me, &#8722;H, &#8722;CF3; and en*=2,3&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;2,3&#8208;butanediamine. They have been characterized by IR, UV&#8208;vis, and NMR spectroscopies, XRD, electrochemistry, mass spectrometry, DFT and (TD)DFT computations. The introduction of electron&#8208;withdrawing and donating groups at the 4,4&#8217;&#8208;position of the bpy ligand affects the complexes&#8217; redox potentials, pKa&#8217;s, and Bond Dissociation Free Energies (BDFEs) of the N&#8722;H bonds in the en* ligands.

&lt;p&gt;Fine-tuning of electronic structures allows control over energetic parameters in a family of complexes that undergo multi-redox 2e&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;/2H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; processes. The orbital overlap gives structural energy stabilization for potential inversion.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most redox processes that break/form bonds involve net 2e&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; changes, and many are coupled to protons. Yet most proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) studies focus on 1e&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;/1H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; reactions. Reported here is a family of molecular models that undergo tunable 2e&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;/2H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; redox changes. Complexes &lt;b&gt;[(X&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;bpy)Ru&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt;(en*)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;](PF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;[(X&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;bpy)Ru&lt;sup&gt;IV&lt;/sup&gt;(en*-H)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;](PF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; have been synthesized with bpy=2,2&#8217;-bipyridine with 4,4&#8217;-subtitutions X=&#8722;NMe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, &#8722;OMe, &#8722;Me, &#8722;H, &#8722;CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;; and en*=2,3-dimethyl-2,3-butanediamine. They have been characterized by IR, UV-vis, and NMR spectroscopies, XRD, electrochemistry, mass spectrometry, DFT and (TD)DFT computations. The introduction of electron-withdrawing and donating groups at the 4,4&#8217;-position of the bpy ligand affects the complexes&#8217; redox potentials, p&lt;i&gt;K&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;&#8217;s, and Bond Dissociation Free Energies (BDFEs) of the N&#8722;H bonds in the en* ligands. The average BDFEs for the overall 2e&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;/2H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; PCET span over 5&#8197;kcal/mol. Notably, these complexes all show marked potential inversion over an extended range, &#916;p&lt;i&gt;K&lt;/i&gt;

         <title>Energy&#8208;Transfer Enabled Divergent Synthesis of Polycyclic &#947;&#8208;Sultines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photoinduced energy transfer enabled procedure for the construction of otherwise challenging&#8208;to&#8208;access polycyclic sultine derivatives has been discovered. The reaction demonstrates good functional group compatibility, mild reaction conditions, excellent diastereoselectivity, and scalable.







Abstract
A visible&#8208;light&#8208;initiated energy&#8208;transfer enabled radical cyclization for the divergent synthesis of polycyclic &#947;&#8208;sultine derivatives has been developed. The reaction provides an alternative and expeditious access to benzofused &#947;&#8208;sultine frameworks, the analogues of &#947;&#8208;lactones and &#947;&#8208;sultones, and features good functional group compatibility, mild reaction conditions and excellent diastereoselectivity. The robustness and application potential of this method have also been successfully displayed by two gram&#8208;scale reactions and the synthesis of polycyclic sultones. Mechanistic studies indicated the transformations through a possible energy&#8208;transfer enabled intramolecular radical homolytic substitution or hydrogen atom transfer process mainly.

         <title>The Strategies Towards Electrochemical Generation of Aryl Radicals</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electrochemical generation of aryl radicals from various precursors has attracted significant attention due to their high reactivity in forming multiple chemical bonds. This review summarizes recent advancements by categorizing the aryl radical precursors into five key types: (1) aryl diazonium salts, (2) aryl halides, (3) aryl (sulfonyl)hydrazines, (4) aryl quaternary arylammonium salts, and (5) other aryl radical precursors.







Abstract
The advancement in electrochemical techniques has unlocked a new path for achieving unprecedented oxidations and reductions of aryl radical precursors in a controlled and selective manner. This approach facilitates the construction of aromatic carbon&#8722;carbon and carbon&#8722;heteroatom bonds. In light of the green merits and the growing importance of this technique in aryl radical chemistry, this review aims to provide an overview of the recent advance in the electrochemical generation of aryl radicals organized by the aryl radical precursor type, with a focus on the substrate scope, limitation, and underlying mechanism, thereby inspiring future work on electrochemical aryl radical generation.

         <title>Stimuli&#8208;Induced Fluorescence Switching in Azine&#8208;Containing Fluorophores Displaying Resonance&#8208;Stabilized ESIPT Emission</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis, structural and photophysical characterization of azaheterocycles&#8208;functionalized 2&#8208;(2&#8217;&#8208;hydroxyphenyl)benzazole derivatives showing dual&#8208;state emission properties are described. Their stimuli&#8208;sensitive (acid, cations) response is also scrutinized with the support of ab initio calculations.







Abstract
This article reports the synthesis, along with structural and photophysical characterization of 2&#8208;(2&#8217;&#8208;hydroxyphenyl)benzazole derivatives functionalized with various azaheterocycles (pyridine, pyrimidine, terpyridine). These compounds show dual&#8208;state emission properties, that is intense fluorescence both in solution and in the solid&#8208;state with a range of fluorescent color going from blue to orange. Moreover, the nature of their excited state can be tuned by the presence of external stimuli such as protons or metal cations. In the absence of stimuli, these dyes show emission stemming from anionic species obtained after deprotonation (D* transition), whereas upon protonation or metal chelation, ESIPT process occurs leading to a stabilized and highly emissive K* transition. With the help of extensive ab initio calculations, we confirm that external stimuli can switch the nature of the transitions, making this series of dyes attractive candidates for the development of stimuli&#8208;responsive fluorescent ratiometric probes.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chirality at the metal center is a well&#8208;established concept, exemplified by numerous four&#8208; and six&#8208;coordinated complexes. Here, a pioneering example of linear chirality&#8208;at&#8208;metal is described: L&#8208;2&#8208;[Ag(NHC)2]+ (NHC = N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene). In solution, stabilizing &#960;&#8208;&#960; interactions preserve the chiral information of the solid state. Consequently, a novel class of atropisomers is identified, whose stereogenicity arises from hindered rotation about a C&#8211;Ag&#8211;C axis, instead of a typical C&#8211;C bond.</dc:description>

         <title>Stable Antiaromatic [16]Triphyrin(2.1.1) with Core Modification: Synthesis Using a 16&#960; Electrocyclic Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Antiaromatic porphyrinoids have attracted significant attention owing to their unique electronic properties and potential applications. However, synthesis of antiaromatic contracted porphyrinoids is challenging owing to the inherent instability associated with smaller ring sizes. In this study, we report the synthesis and characterization of the first stable trioxa[16]triphyrin(2.1.1), a novel 16&#960; antiaromatic contracted porphyrinoid. We utilized a core modification approach to stabilize the [16]triphyrin(2.1.1). X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis revealed a nearly planar structure. Electrochemical studies demonstrated reversible oxidation behavior and a small HOMO&#8211;LUMO gap, which was consistent with its antiaromatic nature. Chemical oxidation yielded an aromatic [14]triphyrin(2.1.1) dication, highlighting the antiaromaticity&#8211;aromaticity switching capability of this system. This synthesis involved the discovery of a key intermediate, dihydrotrioxatriphyrin(2.1.1), which underwent oxidative dehydrogenation to yield the target compound. Theoretical calculations suggested that dihydrotrioxatriphyrin(2.1.1) formed via a rare 16&#960; electrocyclic reaction. The successful synthesis and characterization of this stable trioxa[16]triphyrin(2.1.1) underscores the potential of the core modification strategies for the rational design of novel antiaromatic systems with tunable properties. Moreover, the discovery of the rare 16&#960; electrocyclic reaction advances the understanding of high&#8208;order pericyclic processes and may inspire new synthetic strategies for complex macrocyclic compounds.</dc:description>

Theoretical calculations suggested that dihydrotrioxatriphyrin(2.1.1) formed via a rare 16&#960; electrocyclic reaction. The successful synthesis and characterization of this stable trioxa[16]triphyrin(2.1.1) underscores the potential of the core modification strategies for the rational design of novel antiaromatic systems with tunable properties. Moreover, the discovery of the rare 16&#960; electrocyclic reaction advances the understanding of high-order pericyclic processes and may inspire new synthetic strategies for complex macrocyclic compounds.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Multi&#8208;Catalytic Metal&#8208;Based Homogeneous&#8208;Heterogeneous Systems in Organic Chemistry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 50, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this concept article we provide examples where metal&#8208;based homogeneous and heterogeneous multi&#8208;catalytic systems cooperate to provide advantages over conventional catalytic systems, such as higher compatibility or increased sustainability. This simple, yet powerful strategy has an untapped potential to address important challenges in organic chemistry.







Abstract
The combination of metal&#8208;based homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysts in the same reaction media is a powerful, yet relatively unexplored approach in organic chemistry. This strategy can address important limitations associated with purely homogeneous or heterogeneous catalysis such as the incompatibility of different catalytic species in solution, or the limited tunability of solid catalysts, respectively. Moreover, the facile reusability of the solid catalyst, contributes to increase the overall sustainability of the process. As a result, this semi&#8208;heterogeneous multi&#8208;catalytic approach has unlocked significant advances in organic chemistry, improving existing reactions and even enabling the discovery of novel transformations, exemplified by the formal alkane metathesis. This concept article aims to showcase the benefits of this strategy through the exploration of diverse relevant examples from the literature, hoping to spur research on new metal&#8208;based homogeneous&#8208;heterogeneous catalyst combinations that will result in reactivity challenging to achieve by conventional homogeneous or heterogeneous catalysis alone.

         <title>Contact Electrification as an Emerging Strategy for Controlling the Performance of Metal Nanoparticle Catalysts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 50, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
As modern technology enters the era of nanomaterials, the contact electrification, as a classic physical phenomenon, brings new ideas for studying the interactions between metal nanoparticles. The study of contact electrification phenomenon by classical theory shows that the Fermi level of materials before and after contact changes. This conclusion is further confirmed by modern characterization techniques, and this change in the Fermi level of materials is reflected in the field of catalysis, which can regulate the performance of catalysts in catalytic reactions.







Abstract
Contact electrification (CE) is an emerging strategy for controlling the performance of metal nanoparticle (NP) catalysts. The underlying physical principle of this control is the sensitivity of the Fermi level to metal&#8208;metal contacts. This change in electronic structure has a direct impact on surface properties and chemical reactivity. The concept article briefly introduces the basic theory of CE and its relationship to catalytic performance. We then highlight selected recent examples of advances in the preparation of hybrid metal NP assemblies, experimental techniques for characterizing CE, and finally applications of CE for altering catalytic performance.

         <title>Highly Graphitized Coal Tar Pitch&#8208;Derived Porous Carbon as High&#8208;Performance Lithium Storage Materials</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 50, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report that excellent porous carbon materials are obtained by modulating different proportions of coal tar pitch and nano&#8208;calcium carbonate powder (CTP&#8722;X). CTP&#8208;2 exhibits excellent cycling and multiplication performance when used as an anode for LIBs, and is expected to be used as an electrode material for the next generation LIBs.







Abstract
Because of its high specific capacity and superior rate performance, porous carbon is regarded as a potential anode material for lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs). However, porous carbon materials with wide pore diameter distributions suffer from low structural stability and low electrical conductivity during the application process. During this study, the calcium carbonate nanoparticle template method is used to prepare coal tar pitch&#8208;derived porous carbon (CTP&#8722;X). The coal tar pitch&#8208;derived porous carbon has a well&#8208;developed macroporous&#8208;mesoporous&#8208;microporous hierarchical porous network structure, which provides abundant active sites for Li+ storage, significantly reduces polarization and charge transfer resistance, shortens the diffusion path and promotes the rapid transport of Li+. More specifically, the CTP&#8208;2 anode shows high charge capacity (496.9&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 50&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1), excellent rate performance (413.6&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 even at 500&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1), and high cycling stability (capacity retention rate of about 100&#8201;% after 1,000 cycles at 2&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1). The clean and eco&#8208;friendly large&#8208;scale utilization of coal tar pitch will facilitate the development of high&#8208;performance anodes in the field of LIBs.

         <title>Covalently Linked 5,6,11,12&#8208;Tetraazanaphthacene Dimer and Its Triptycene&#8208;Capped Derivatives as Electron Acceptors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 50, September 5, 2024. </description>

Triptycene end&#8208;capped bi&#8208;tetraazaacene (bi&#8208;TpTANC) was synthesised with good solubility, rigidity, and crystallinity, and was characterised using X&#8208;ray crystallography. Bi&#8208;TpTANC is a multi&#8208;electron acceptor with a 3&#8208;step/4&#8208;electron transfer mechanism, and its electrochemistry suggests through&#8208;bond charge delocalisation in its monoanionic state. With a LUMO level of &#8722;4.1&#8197;eV, bi&#8208;TpTANC is expected to be an air stable electron acceptor or an n&#8208;type semiconductor.







Abstract
The development of electron transport and n&#8208;type materials is still largely dominated by a limited number of organic semiconductors, with fullerenes at the forefront. In contrast, substantial progress has been made in developing hole transport and p&#8208;type materials. Therefore, expanding the range of electron acceptors, making them solution&#8208;processable, and elucidating their structural arrangement by X&#8208;ray crystallography is essential. We synthesised 2,2&#8217;&#8208;bi&#8208;(5,6,11,12&#8208;tetraazanaphthacene) (bi&#8208;TANC) and its triptycene end&#8208;capped derivative, 2,2&#8242;&#8208;bi(8,13&#8208;dihydro&#8208;8,13&#8208;[1,2]benzenonaphtho&#8208;5,6,15,16&#8208;tetraazanaphthacene) (bi&#8208;TpTANC), as electron acceptors. Bi&#8208;TANC exhibits a herringbone&#8208;like crystal packing with intermolecular &#960;&#8211;&#960; overlap, which is observed in typical organic n&#8208;type semiconductors. However, it showed poor solubility, similar to larger acenes. In contrast, bi&#8208;TpTANC exhibited favourable solubility, and its electrochemistry in solution was investigated. In the cyclic voltammogram of bi&#8208;TpTANC, reversible redox waves corresponding to 3&#8208;step/4&#8208;electron transfer were observed at &#8722;0.795&#8197;V (1e&#8722;), &#8722;0.927&#8197;V (1e&#8722;), and &#8722;1.44&#8197;V (2e&#8722;) as half&#8208;wave potentials. The redox wave associated with the two&#8208;electron transfer on the negative low&#8208;potential side indicates the presence of through&#8208;bond charge delocalisation in the monoanionic state. Furthermore, the LUMO level of bi&#8208;TpTANC is &#8722;4.1&#8197;eV, which indicates its potential as a promising air&#8208;stable n&#8208;type material.

         <title>Probing Basal and Prismatic Planes of Graphitic Materials for Metal Single Atom and Subnanometer Cluster Stabilization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 50, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The detection of small quantities of metal clusters in single atom catalysts remains a challenge even when combining electron microscopy (EM), X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The results obtained demonstrate that Rh single atoms are mainly present on materials presenting prismatic surface, and that catalysis itself constitutes a valuable tool for the characterization of these materials.







Abstract
Supported metal single atom catalysis is a dynamic research area in catalysis science combining the advantages of homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysis. Understanding the interactions between metal single atoms and the support constitutes a challenge facing the development of such catalysts, since these interactions are essential in optimizing the catalytic performance. For conventional carbon supports, two types of surfaces can contribute to single atom stabilization: the basal planes and the prismatic surface; both of which can be decorated by defects and surface oxygen groups. To date, most studies on carbon&#8208;supported single atom catalysts focused on nitrogen&#8208;doped carbons, which, unlike classic carbon materials, have a fairly well&#8208;defined chemical environment. Herein we report the synthesis, characterization and modeling of rhodium single atom catalysts supported on carbon materials presenting distinct concentrations of surface oxygen groups and basal/prismatic surface area. The influence of these parameters on the speciation of the Rh species, their coordination and ultimately on their catalytic performance in hydrogenation and hydroformylation reactions is analyzed. The results obtained show that catalysis itself is an interesting tool for the fine characterization of these materials, for which the detection of small quantities of metal clusters remains a challenge, even when combining several cutting&#8208;edge analytical methods.

         <title>Thiolated Cyanines Appended to Partially Pegylated Gold Nanoparticles for Fluorescence Quenching of Two&#8208;Channel Photothermal Inks</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 50, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cyanine dyes equipped with a thiolated bridge are non&#8208;fluorescent when grafted on partially&#8208;pegilated Au nanoparticles. The cyanine/AuNP pegilated hybrids can be dissolved in water/alcohol mixtures to give nanoinks, whose printouts display two photothermally responsive absorption bands, that give different T increases when laser&#8208;irradiated.







Abstract
Following a new approach, we prepared a nanoink with two separate photothermally responsive absorption bands. One is the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) absorption of gold nanoparticles (AuNP, d=17&#8197;nm), the second is the absorption band of two cyanine (Cy) dyes, Cy7&#8208;C6 or Cy7&#8208;C11, grafted to the AuNP surface through thiolated bridges of different lengths: the close proximity to the Au surface induces full quenching of the Cy fluorescence, resulting in thermal relaxation on irradiation. Attempts to full coat AuNP with the lipophilic Cy7&#8208;C6 and Cy7&#8208;C11 lead to precipitation from aqueous solutions. We thus prepared AuNP with partial pegylation (30, 50, or 70&#8201;%), using a long chain thiol&#8208;terminated PEG bearing a &#8208;COOH function. Addition until saturation of either Cy7&#8208;C6 or Cy7&#8208;C11 to the partially pegylated AuNP gave the AuNP@Cy/PEGX% hybrids (X=30, 50, 70) that are stable in water and in the water/alcohol mixtures used to prepare the nanoinks. Further overcoating of AuNP@Cy7&#8208;C6/PEG50&#8201;% with PAH (polyallylamine hydrochloride) avoids LSPR hybridization in the dry nanoink printouts, that present two separate bands. When irradiated with laser sources near their absorption maxima, the printouts of the AuNP@Cy7&#8208;C6/PEG50&#8201;%@PAH nanoink respond on two channels, giving different temperature increases depending on the irradiation wavelengths. This enhances the potentiality of use of these nanoinks for photothermal anticounterfait printouts, making more difficult to reproduce the correct &#916;T vs &#955;irradiation output.

         <title>Monomeric Fe(III)&#8208;Hydroxo and Fe(III)&#8208;Aqua Complexes Display Oxidative Asynchronous Hydrogen Atom Abstraction Reactivity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 50, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This paper presents the lipoxygenase&#8208;like activity of monomeric [FeIII(L5R)(OH)]1+ and [FeIII(L5R)(OH2)]2+ complexes (R=OMe, H, Cl, NO2), employing linoleic acid as a substrate. The rate&#8208;limiting step involves hydrogen atom transfer from linoleic acid to the &#8220;FeIII&#8722;OH&#8220;/&#8221;FeIII&#8722;OH2&#8220; complexes via an oxidative asynchronous concerted proton&#8208;electron transfer (CPET) pathway. The higher degree of asynchronicity in CPET within aqua complexes enhances the rate by approximately five&#8208;fold compared to hydroxo analogs.







Abstract
This paper presents the synthesis and characterization of a series of novel monomeric aqua&#8208;ligated iron(III) complexes, [FeIII(L5R)(OH2)]2+ (R=OMe, H, Cl, NO2), supported by an amide&#8208;containing pentadentate N5 donor ligand, L5R [HL5R=2&#8208;(((1&#8208;methyl&#8208;1H&#8208;imidazol&#8208;2&#8208;yl)methyl)(pyridin&#8208;2&#8208;yl&#8208;methyl)amino)&#8208;N&#8208;(5&#8208;R&#8208;quinolin&#8208;8&#8208;yl)acetamide]. The complexes were characterized by various spectroscopic and analytical techniques, including electrochemistry and magnetic measurements. The Fe(III)&#8208;hydroxo complexes, [FeIII(L5R)(OH)]1+, were generated in&#8197;situ by deprotonating the corresponding aqua complexes in a pH ~7 aqueous medium. In another way, adding one equivalent of a base to a methanolic solution of the Fe(III)&#8208;aqua complexes also produced the Fe(III)&#8208;hydroxo complexes. The study uses linoleic fatty acid as a substrate to explore the hydrogen atom abstraction (HAA) reactivity of both hydroxo and aqua complexes. The investigation highlights the substitution effect of the L5R ligand on reactivity, revealing a higher rate when an electron&#8208;withdrawing group is present. Hammett analyses and(or) determination of the asynchronicity factor (&#951;) suggest an oxidative asynchronous concerted proton&#8208;electron transfer (CPET) pathway for the HAA reactions. Aqua complexes exhibited a higher asynchronicity in CPET, resulting in higher reaction rates than their hydroxo analogs. Overall, the work provides insights into the beneficial role of a higher imbalance in electron&#8208;transfer&#8208;proton&#8208;transfer (ET&#8208;PT) contributions in HAA reactivity.

         <title>A Hydrogen Bonded Non&#8208;Porous Organic&#8208;Inorganic Framework for Measuring Cysteine in Blood Plasma and Endogenous Cancer Cell</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 50, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This article reports the synthesis of a non&#8208;luminescent one&#8208;dimensional hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic&#8208;inorganic framework (HOIF) of Cu(II) and its affinity studies with cysteine. Cysteine measurement by HOIF has been validated using a commercial dye, &#8220;Cysteine Green&#8221;. The probe is suitable for measuring cysteine in plasma and bio&#8208;imaging endogenous cysteine in cancer cells.







Abstract
An imbalance in cysteine (Cys) levels in the cells and plasma has been identified as the risk indicator for various human diseases. The structural similarity of cysteine with its congener homocysteine and glutathione offers challenges in its measurement. Herein, we report a hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic&#8208;inorganic framework of Cu(II) (HOIF) for the selective detection of cysteine over other biothiols. The non&#8208;fluorescent HOIF showed 12&#8208;fold green emission in the presence of cysteine. The monomeric unit of HOIF is stabilized via intermolecular hydrogen bonds, resulting in a non&#8208;porous network structure. Non&#8208;interference from homocysteine, glutathione, and other competitive bio&#8208;analytes revealed explicit affinity of HOIF for cysteine. Fluorimetric titration showed a wide working concentration window (650&#8197;nM&#8211;800&#8197;&#956;M) for measuring cysteine in an aqueous medium. The mechanistic investigation involving HRMS, EPR, and UV&#8208;vis spectroscopic studies revealed the decomplexation of HOIF with Cys, resulting in a fluorescence turn&#8208;on response from the luminescent ligand. Validation using a commercial dye, &#8220;Cysteine Green&#8221;, confirmed the prospect of HOIF for early diagnostic purposes. Utilizing the fluorescence turn&#8208;on property of HOIF in the presence of cysteine, we measured cysteine quantitatively in the blood plasma samples. Bio&#8208;imaging of endogenous cysteine in cancer cells indicated the ability of HOIF to monitor the intracellular cysteine.

The non-fluorescent HOIF showed 12-fold green emission in the presence of cysteine. The monomeric unit of HOIF is stabilized via intermolecular hydrogen bonds, resulting in a non-porous network structure. Non-interference from homocysteine, glutathione, and other competitive bio-analytes revealed explicit affinity of HOIF for cysteine. Fluorimetric titration showed a wide working concentration window (650&#8197;nM&#8211;800&#8197;&#956;M) for measuring cysteine in an aqueous medium. The mechanistic investigation involving HRMS, EPR, and UV-vis spectroscopic studies revealed the decomplexation of HOIF with Cys, resulting in a fluorescence turn-on response from the luminescent ligand. Validation using a commercial dye, &#8220;Cysteine Green&#8221;, confirmed the prospect of HOIF for early diagnostic purposes. Utilizing the fluorescence turn-on property of HOIF in the presence of cysteine, we measured cysteine quantitatively in the blood plasma samples. Bio-imaging of endogenous cysteine in cancer cells indicated the ability of HOIF to monitor the intracellular cysteine.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Targeted Endoperoxides Delivering Singlet Oxygen to Cancer Cell Mitochondria: Exploration of the Therapeutic Potential</title>

Controlled and targeted generation of singlet oxygen in tumor tissues is poised to evolve into a viable therapeutic approach for cancer which does not require light or oxygen.







Abstract
The clinical practice of photodynamic therapy of cancer (PDT) is mostly limited to superficial types of cancer. The major reason behind this limited applicability is the need for light in the photogeneration of ROS, and in particular singlet oxygen. In order to circumvent this major roadblock, we designed and synthesized naphthalene&#8208;derived endoperoxides with mitochondria targeting triphenylphosphonium moieties. Here, we show that these compounds release singlet oxygen by thermal cycloreversion, and initiate cell death with IC50&lt;10&#8197;&#956;M in cancer cell cultures. The mouse 4T1 breast tumor model study, where the endoperoxide compound was introduced intraperitoneally, also showed highly promising results, with negligible systemic toxicity. Targeted delivery of singlet oxygen to cancer cell mitochondria could be the breakthrough needed to transform Photodynamic Therapy into a broadly applicable methodology for cancer treatment by keeping the central tenet and discarding problematic dependencies on oxygen or external light.

         <title>A Novel Fluorescent Gemcitabine Prodrug That Follows a Nucleoside Transporter&#8208;Independent Internalization and Bears Enhanced Therapeutic Efficacy With Respect to Gemcitabine</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 50, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fluorescent prodrug, named GF, based on gemcitabine and 5(6)&#8208;carboxyfluorescein was developed in a single step. GF follows a nucleoside transporter&#8208;independent endocytosis internalization mechanism, surpassing a key resistance mechanism against gemcitabine. Its pharmacokinetic profile and drug release efficiency were evaluated in mice, and eventually its visualization was achieved in zebrafish and its tumor inhibition was monitored in A549 xenografted mice.







Abstract
The multiplexity of cancer has rendered it the second leading cause of mortality worldwide and theragnostic prodrugs have gained popularity in recent years as a means of treatment. Theragnostic prodrugs enable the simultaneous diagnosis and therapy of tumors via high&#8208;precision real&#8208;time drug release monitoring. Herein, we report the development of the small theragnostic prodrug GF, based on the nucleoside anticancer agent gemcitabine and the fluorescent dye 5(6)&#8208;carboxyfluorescein. We have successfully demonstrated its efficient internalization in tumor cells, showing localization throughout both the early and late endocytic pathways. Its mechanism of cell internalization was evaluated, confirming its independence from nucleoside transporters. Its cellular localization via confocal microscopy revealed a clathrin&#8208;mediated endocytosis mechanism, distinguishing it from analogous compounds studied previously. Furthermore, GF exhibited stability across various pH values and in human blood plasma. Subsequently, its in&#8197;vitro cytotoxicity was assessed in three human cancer cell lines (A549, U87 and T98). Additionally, its pharmacokinetic profile in mice was investigated and the consequent drug release was monitored. Finally, its in&#8197;vivo visualization was accomplished in zebrafish xenotransplantation models and its in&#8197;vivo efficacy was evaluated in A549 xenografts. The results unveiled an intriguing efficacy profile, positioning GF as a compelling candidate warranting further investigation.

         <title>Isolation, Structure Elucidation, and Biological Activity of the Selective TACR2 Antagonist Tumonolide and its Aldehyde from a Marine Cyanobacterium</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 50, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study describes the isolation of tumonolide and its aldehyde from a marine cyanobacterium. The relative and absolute stereochemistry of tumonolide were determined utilizing various spectroscopic and computational methods. Functional screening against a GPCR panel, molecular docking and global profiling using RNA sequencing provided the biological profile of tumonolide.







Abstract
The macrocyclic tumonolide (1) with enamide functionality and the linear tumonolide aldehyde (2) are new interconverting natural products from a marine cyanobacterium with a peptide&#8208;polyketide skeleton, representing a hybrid of apratoxins and palmyrolides or laingolides. The planar structures were established by NMR and mass spectrometry. The relative configuration of the stereogenically&#8208;rich apratoxin&#8208;like polyketide portion was determined using J&#8208;based configuration analysis. The absolute configuration of tumonolide (1) was determined by chiral analysis of the amino acid units and computational methods, followed by NMR chemical shift and ECD spectrum prediction, indicating all&#8208;R configuration for the polyketide portion, as in palmyrolide A and contrary to the all&#8208;S configuration in apratoxins. Functional screening against a panel of 168 GPCR targets revealed tumonolide (1) as a selective antagonist of TACR2 with an IC50 of 7.0&#8197;&#956;M, closely correlating with binding affinity. Molecular docking studies established the binding mode and rationalized the selectivity for TACR2 over TACR1 and TACR3. RNA sequencing upon treatment of HCT116 colorectal cancer cells demonstrated activation of the pulmonary fibrosis idiopathic signaling pathway and the insulin secretion signaling pathway at 20&#8197;&#956;M, indicating its potential to modulate these pathways.

         <title>The Influence of Disulfide, Thioacetal and Lanthionine&#8208;Bridges on the Conformation of a Macrocyclic Peptide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 50, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Does the bridge matter? We have compared the solution conformations of lanthionine, disulfide and thioacetal&#8208;bridged cyclic analogues of angiotensin(1&#8211;7). Despite the different bridging structures, the major conformations are found to be conserved for the macrocyclic core.







Abstract
Cyclisation of peptides by forming thioether (lanthionine), disulfide (cystine) or methylene thioacetal bridges between side chains is established as an important tool to stabilise a given structure, enhance metabolic stability and optimise both potency and selectivity. However, a systematic comparative study of the effects of differing bridging modalities on peptide conformation has not previously been carried out. In this paper, we have used the NMR deconvolution algorithm, NAMFIS, to determine the conformational ensembles, in aqueous solution, of three cyclic analogues of angiotensin(1&#8211;7), incorporating either disulfide, or non&#8208;reducible thioether or methylene thioacetal bridges. We demonstrate that the major solution conformations are conserved between the different bridged peptides, but the distribution of conformations differs appreciably. This suggests that subtle differences in ring size and bridging structure can be exploited to fine&#8208;tune the conformational properties of cyclic peptides, which may modulate their bioactivities.

         <title>Photoinduced Transition&#8208;Metal and External Photosensitizer Free Benzylic Fluorination of Unactivated Alkylarenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 50, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The photocatalytic monofluorination of unactivated alkylarenes, potentially initiated via a single&#8208;electron transfer, offers a highly efficient and selective pathway with excellent substrate compatibility, enabling the scale&#8208;up synthesis of pharmaceutical molecules. Omitting transition&#8208;metal catalysts and photosensitizers simplifies late&#8208;stage drug modification and the purification process.







Abstract
A green and efficient protocol for the direct monofluorination of unactivated alkylarenes under visible&#8208;light irradiation has been developed, without any extraneous transition&#8208;metal catalysts or photosensitizers. This method is compatible with a broad spectrum of functional groups, including carboxylic and alcoholic scaffolds, under mild reaction conditions. Gram&#8208;scale synthesis of a fluorine&#8208;containing pharmaceutical analogue was successfully executed, underscoring the strategy's reliability and practicality. Furthermore, mechanistic studies suggest that a single&#8208;electron transfer mechanism might be responsible for the generation of the benzylic radicals in initiation step.

         <title>Exploring the Esterase Catalytic Activity of Minimalist Heptapeptide Amyloid Fibers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 50, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The esterase activity of minimalist amyloid fibers, made up of seven&#8208;residue peptides IHIHIHI and IHIHIQI, is examined using computational techniques. Contrary to initial assumptions, computational simulations reveal that the twist angle of the fiber is not notably influenced by the sixth residue, the reduction in the energy barrier when Gln is present being attributed to the formation of hydrogen bonds with the substrate.







Abstract
This paper investigates the esterase activity of minimalist amyloid fibers composed of short seven&#8208;residue peptides, IHIHIHI (IH7) and IHIHIQI (IH7Q), with a particular focus on the role of the sixth residue position within the peptide sequence. Through computational simulations and analyses, we explore the molecular mechanisms underlying catalysis in these amyloid&#8208;based enzymes. Contrary to initial hypotheses, our study reveals that the twist angle of the fiber, and thus the catalytic site's environment, is not notably affected by the sixth residue. Instead, the sixth residue interacts with the p&#8208;nitrophenylacetate (pNPA) substrate, particularly through its &#8722;NO2 group, potentially enhancing catalysis. Quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) simulations of the reaction mechanism suggest that the polarizing effect of glutamine enhances catalytic activity by forming a stabilizing network of hydrogen bonds with pNPA, leading to lower energy barriers and a more exergonic reaction. Our findings provide valuable insights into the intricate interplay between peptide sequence, structural arrangement, and catalytic function in amyloid&#8208;based enzymes, offering potentially valuable information for the design and optimization of biomimetic catalysts.

The developed method demonstrates the activation of heteroatoms via electrochemically generated reactive iodide species without using any metal catalysts and peroxides. The protocol features practical and mild reaction conditions and displays a wide substrate scope.

         <title>Gold Nanoclusters Whose Photoluminescent Properties are Dynamically Tunable by Modulating the Assembly Pathway Complexity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 50, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Gold nanoclusters (DPT&#8208;AuNCs) could self&#8208;assembles into two distinct aggregation structures in MeOH/water mixed solvent, exhibiting pathway complexity with different photoluminescent property. DPT&#8208;AuNCs firstly assembles into non&#8208;luminescent nanofibers (kinetically controlled), which further transforms into strongly luminescent microflowers (thermodynamically controlled).







Abstract
Modulating the assembly pathway is an indispensable strategy for optimizing the performance of optical materials. However, implementing this strategy is nontrivial for metal nanocluster building blocks, due to the limited functional modification of nanoclusters and complexity of their emission mechanism. In this report, we demonstrate that a gold nanocluster modified by 4,6&#8208;diamino&#8208;2&#8208;pyrimidinethiol (DPT&#8208;AuNCs) self&#8208;assembles into two distinct aggregation structures in methanol (MeOH)/water mixed solvent, thus exhibiting pathway complexity. Kinetic studies show that DPT&#8208;AuNCs firstly assembles into non&#8208;luminescent nanofibers (kinetically controlled), which further transforms into strongly luminescent microflowers (thermodynamically controlled). In&#8208;depth analysis of the assembly mechanism reveals that the transformation of aggregation structures involves the disassembly of nanofibers and a subsequent nucleation&#8208;growth process. Temperature&#8208;dependent photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy and infrared (IR) measurements reveal that inter&#8208;cluster hydrogen bonding bridged by solvent molecules and C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; interaction are the key factors for emission enhancement. The photoluminescent property of DPT&#8208;AuNCs can be controlled by varying the cosolvent in water, enabling DPT&#8208;AuNCs to distinguish different kind of alcohols, particularly the isomerism n&#8208;propanol (NPA) and isopropanol (IPA). Additionally, the addition of seeds effectively regulate the assembly kinetics of DPT&#8208;AuNCs. This study advances our understanding of assembly pathways and improves the luminescent performance of nanoclusters (NCs).

         <title>Total Synthesis of (15R)&#8208; and (15S)&#8208;Prostaglandin A2</title>

Caribbean Vibes in the Lab: Prostaglandin A2 is a tissue hormone, which is also present in Caribbean Sea whips. The short and robust total syntheses of both naturally occurring PGA2 epimers and the subsequent biological evaluation of both compounds revealed an interaction of PGA2 depending on the stereochemistry at C15.







Abstract
From both pharmaceutical and structural perspectives, the large family of prostaglandins represent a truly remarkable class of natural products. Prostaglandin A2 is a tissue hormone naturally found in human seminal plasma and in the sea whip Plexaura homomalla with yet poorly understood biological or therapeutic effects. Herein, a novel strategy for the stereoselective construction of both naturally occurring prostaglandin A2 epimers and first insights into their functional effects on the major inhibitory neurotransmitter &#947;&#8208;aminobutyric acid (GABA) type A receptors (GABAAR) are provided. The synthesis of both epimers was achieved in only 11 steps starting from commercially available 2,5&#8208;dimethoxy&#8208;tetrahydrofuran employing an organocatalytic domino&#8208;aldol reaction, a Mizoroki&#8208;Heck reaction, a Wittig reaction as well as an oxidation&#8208;decarboxylation sequence. The (15R)&#8208;epimer significantly reduced GABA&#8208;induced currents through GABAA receptors while its (15S)&#8208;epimer did not show any significant effect. These data suggest that (15R)&#8208;PGA2 might serve as a novel scaffold for the development of selective GABAA receptor modulators.

         <title>Searching for &#8220;Greener&#8221; Bioequivalents of CF3 to Lower its Environmental Impact</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 50, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Considering concerns on the negative environmental effects of CF3 containing compounds, we searched for &#8220;greener&#8221; alternatives. We found &#8722;I as the best alternative since it is equivalent in all aspects studied, size, electronic and lipophilic, followed by &#8722;F, &#8208;cyclo&#8208;Pr, &#8722;2&#8208;oxetyl, &#8722;SF5 and &#8722;SCH3. We suggest using these functionalities as an alternative to &#8722;CF3 in the preparation of new therapies.







Abstract
Considering the broad use of the trifluoromethyl functional group (&#8722;CF3) in medicinal chemistry and taking into account the recent concerns on the negative environmental effects of CF3 containing compounds, we are searching for &#8220;greener&#8221; alternatives. Thus, different chemical groups (i.&#8201;e. iodide, fluoride, cyclopropyl, isopropyl, cyclobutyl, 3&#8208;oxetyl, 2&#8208;oxetyl, methylsulfide, pentafluorosulfide, methylsulfonyl and sulfonamide) have been considered as potential bioequivalents of &#8722;CF3 aiming to use them in compounds with therapeutic interest instead of the polyfluoride functionality. Different structural (molecular surface and volume) and physicochemical (electronic and lipophilic) aspects of the bioequivalent functionalities proposed have been theoretically calculated and compared to those of &#8722;CF3. Additionally, the corresponding phenyl derivatives carrying these functionalities have been purchased or prepared and their experimental lipophilicity (i.&#8201;e. LogP) measured using shake&#8208;flask experiments and UV&#8208;vis spectroscopy.

         <title>Excited&#8208;State Dynamics in Segregated Donor&#8208;Acceptor Stacks Versus a Peri&#8208;Bisdonor&#8208;Acceptor System</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 50, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Delocalized excitation in the segregated stacks of the naphthalenemonoimide&#8208;perylene based donor&#8208;acceptor system (NI&#8208;Pe) is reported. In the monomer of the fork&#8208;shaped bisdonor&#8208;acceptor system (NI&#8208;Pe2) with intrinsic close&#8208;stacked perylene donors, a long&#8208;lived charge&#8208;separated (CS) state is observed in non&#8208;polar solvents. The CS state involves a delocalized perylene dimer radical cation engendered by the peri&#8208;perylene interactions in NI&#8208;Pe2.







Abstract
The investigation of impact of through&#8208;space/through&#8208;bond electronic interaction among chromophores on photoexcited&#8208;state properties has immense potential owing to the distinct emergent photophysical pathways. Herein, the photoexcited&#8208;state dynamics of homo&#8208;sorted &#960;&#8208;stacked aggregates of a naphthalenemonoimide and perylene&#8208;based acceptor&#8208;donor (NI&#8208;Pe) system and a fork&#8208;shaped acceptor&#8208;bisdonor (NI&#8208;Pe2) system possessing integrally stacked peri&#8208;substituted donors was examined. Femtosecond transient absorption (fsTA) spectra of NI&#8208;Pe monomer recorded in chloroform displayed spectroscopic signatures of the singlet state of Pe; 1Pe*, the charge&#8208;separated state; NI&#8722;&#8901;&#8208;Pe+&#8901;, and the triplet state of Pe; 3Pe*. The examination of ultrafast excited&#8208;state processes of NI&#8208;Pe aggregate in chloroform revealed faster charge recombination (

         <title>Stereochemically Active Lone Pairs Stabilizing Intrinsic Vacancy Defects in Thermoelectric InTe</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 50, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thermoelectric InTe exhibits significant structural disorder in the form of In+ vacancies. Using 3D&#8208;&#916;PDF informed Monte&#8208;Carlo simulations we reveal the local structure associated with these defects. This structure allows the local expression of stereochemically active lone pairs with an associated electronic energy gain, which is proposed to be a driving force for the formation of the intrinsic vacancy defects.







Abstract
Harvesting waste heat efficiently with thermoelectric energy conversion requires materials with low thermal conductivity. Recently, it was demonstrated how dynamic lone pair expression in thermoelectric InTe is responsible for giant anharmonicity leading to a very low lattice thermal conductivity. InTe also contains correlated disorder of intrinsic defects due to vacancies, and this contributes to additional lowering of the thermal conductivity. Here we use the three&#8208;dimensional difference pair distribution function (3D&#8208;&#916;PDF) to analyze 25&#8197;K single crystal diffuse X&#8208;ray scattering from InTe to unravel the local defect structure, and propose a microscopic structural model. Extended off&#8208;centering of In+ ions induced by vacancies allows for the local expression of stereochemically active lone pairs. The associated electronic stabilization is proposed to be a driving force for the formation of In+ vacancy defects in InTe.

         <title>Mechanochemical Synthesis of Corannulene Flanked N&#8208;heterocyclic Carbene (NHC) Precursors and Preparation of Their Metal Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 50, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents the mechanosynthesis of novel corannulene&#8208;flanked imidazolium bromide NHC precursors. The proposed approach is benchmarked against conventional solution&#8208;based methods using green metrics and energy consumption parameters, showcasing ball&#8208;milling as a greener and more energy&#8208;efficient technique. In addition, the new compounds are demonstrated to be robust ligands for transition metals using ligand substitution reactions as proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept.







Abstract
The synthesis of new compounds is an important pillar for the advancement of the field of chemistry and adjacent fields. In this regard, over the last decades huge efforts have been made to not only develop new molecular entities but also more efficient sustainable synthetic methodologies due to the increasing concerns over environmental sustainability. In this context, we have developed synthetic routes to novel corannulene flanked imidazolium bromide NHC precursors both in the solid&#8208;state and solution phases. Our work presents a comprehensive comparative study of mechanochemical routes and conventional solution&#8208;based methods. Green metrics and energy consumption comparison were performed for both routes revealing ball&#8208;milling generation of these compounds to be an environmentally greener technique to produce such precursors compared to conventional solvent&#8208;based methods. In addition, we have demonstrated proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept of the herein reported corannulene flanked NHCs to be robust ligands for transition metals and their ligand substitution reactions.

We described a copper(I)&#8208;catalyzed atom&#8208;economic and highly chemo&#8208;selective hydroamination&#8208;cyclization of alkynyl&#8208;tethered quinazolinones to prepare a variety of indole&#8208;fused pyrazino[1,2&#8208;a]quinazolinones in good to excellent yields under mild reaction conditions.







Abstract
We described a copper(I)&#8208;catalyzed atom economic and selective hydroamination&#8208;cyclization of alkynyl&#8208;tethered quinazolinones to prepare a variety of indole&#8208;fused pyrazino[1,2&#8208;a]quinazolinones in good to excellent yields ranging from 39&#8201;%&#8211;99&#8201;% under mild reaction conditions. Control experiments revealed that coordination&#8208;directed method of quinazolinone moiety with copper(I) was important for the selective hydroamination&#8208;cyclization of alkynes at the N1&#8208;atom instead of N3&#8208;atom of quinazolinone. The reaction could be easily performed at gram scales and some prepared indole&#8208;fused pyrazino[1,2&#8208;a]quinazolinones with donating groups on the indole moiety showed a distinct fluorescence emission wavelength with blue shift under the acid conditions.

         <title>Wittig Reaction in Deep Eutectic Solvents: Expanding the DES Toolbox in Synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 50, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Wittig reaction was performed in Deep Eutectic Solvents with high yields, wide scope, facile TPPO (triphenyl phosphine oxide) removal and scalability of the process.







Abstract
Wittig reaction between substituted phosphonium salts and (hetero)aromatic and alkyl carbonyl compounds in Deep Eutectic Solvents has been developed under a scalable and friendly protocol. Highly efficient reactions were successfully run with a wide range of bases including organic (DBU, LiTMP, t&#8208;BuOK) and inorganic (NaOH, K2CO3) ones in ChCl/Gly 1&#8201;:&#8201;2 (mol/mol) as solvent under mild conditions, at room temperature and under air. The proposed protocol was applied to a wide range of substrates, including (hetero)aromatic aldehydes with substituents as halogens (I, Br, Cl), EDG (alkoxy, methyl), EWG (NO2, CF3) or reactive groups as CN, esters, and ketones. Vinylic, alkynyl and cycloalkyl, alicyclic and &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated aldehydes can also be used. Highly electrophilic ketones gave good yields. The diastereoselectivity of the reaction is in complete agreement with the E/Z ratio predictable under traditional conditions. We demonstrated that the protocol is scalable to 2&#8197;g (5&#8197;mmol) of phosphonium salt, furthermore the proposed workup protocol allows to remove TPPO without need of additional chromatographic purification.

         <title>Prediction of Covalent Metal&#8208;Metal Bonding in Cp&#8722;M&#8722;M&#8217;&#8208;Nacnac Complexes of Group 2 and 12 Metals (Be, Mg, Ca, Zn, Cd, Hg)</title>

Cp&#8722;M&#8722;M&#8242;&#8208;Nacnac complexes (M=Be, Mg, Ca, Zn, Cd, Hg) are predicted to exhibit electron&#8208;sharing covalent metal&#8208;metal bonds with a [MM&#8242;]2+ core. QTAIM predicts non&#8208;nuclear attractors (NNAs) with substantial electron density in the BeBe, MgMg, and CaCa complexes, suggesting that these metal&#8208;metal bonds also retain significant metallic character that can be associated with reducing reactivity. The novel metal&#8208;metal bonding makes for appealing synthetic targets.







Abstract
Bimetallic CpMM'Nacnac molecules with group 2 and 12 metals (M=Be, Mg, Ca, Zn, Cd, Hg) that contain novel metal&#8208;metal bonding have been investigated in a theoretical study of their molecular and electronic structure, thermodynamic stability, and metal&#8208;metal bonding. In all cases the metal&#8208;metal bonds are characterized as electron&#8208;sharing covalent single bonds from natural bond orbital (NBO) and energy&#8208;decomposition analysis with natural orbitals of chemical valence (EDA&#8208;NOCV) analysis. The sum of [MM&#8242;] charges is relatively constant, with all complexes exhibiting a [MM&#8242;]2+ core. Quantum theory of atoms in molecules (QTAIM) analysis indicates the presence of non&#8208;nuclear attractors (NNA) in the metal&#8208;metal bonds of the BeBe, MgMg, and CaCa complexes. There is substantial electron density (0.75&#8211;1.33&#8197;e) associated with the NNAs, which indicates that these metal&#8208;metal bonds, while classified as covalent electron&#8208;sharing bonds, retain significant metallic character that can be associated with reducing reactivity of the complex. The predicted stability of these complexes, combined with their novel covalent metal&#8208;metal bonding and potential as reducing agents, make them appealing targets for the synthesis of new metal&#8208;metal bonds.

         <title>Electrochemical Decarboxylative Cross&#8208;Coupling with Nucleophiles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 50, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Direct electrochemical decarboxylative cross&#8208;coupling with nucleophiles has been developed for the synthesis of structurally diverse fluoride, alcohol, ether, ester, and amine products. This strategy takes advantage of the ready availability of these building blocks from commercial libraries, as well as the mild and oxidant&#8208;free conditions provided by the electrochemical system.







Abstract
Decarboxylative cross&#8208;coupling reactions are powerful tools for carbon&#8208;heteroatom bonds formation, but typically require pre&#8208;activated carboxylic acids as substrates or heteroelectrophiles as functional groups. Herein, we present an electrochemical decarboxylative cross&#8208;coupling of carboxylic acids with structurally diverse fluorine, alcohol, H2O, acid, and amine as nucleophiles. This strategy takes advantage of the ready availability of these building blocks from commercial libraries, as well as the mild and oxidant&#8208;free conditions provided by electrochemical system. This reaction demonstrates good functional&#8208;group tolerance and its utility in late&#8208;stage functionalization.

         <title>Visible Light Promoted Site&#8208;Specific Functionalization of &#945;&#8208;Acyloxy Carboxamides: Unlocking a Forbidden Chemical Space in the Passerini Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 50, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel method is presented, demonstrating the facile generation of &#945;&#8208;acyloxy carboxamide radicals via photoredox catalysis of Passerini adducts, obtained employing a 4&#8208;formyl&#8208;1,4&#8208;dihydropyridine. These radicals efficiently undergo Giese reactions with various olefins, yielding novel Passerini compounds unattainable through traditional aldehyde&#8208;based routes.







Abstract
The facile generation of the &#945;&#8208;acyloxy carboxamide radical is hereby reported for the first time, utilizing a photoredox catalyzed reaction of Passerini adducts synthesized using a 4&#8208;formyl&#8208;1,4&#8208;dihydropyridine as the carbonyl component. This radical effectively engages in a Giese reaction with a range of olefins, ultimately leading to the synthesis of novel Passerini&#8208;derived products not previously amenable to direct aldehyde&#8208;based transformations. Consequently, the resulting strategy, developed both in batch and in flow, offers a promising opportunity to expand the chemical space accessible through the Passerini reaction, virtually incorporating &#8220;impossible&#8221; aldehydes.

     alt="Visible Light Promoted Site-Specific Functionalization of &#945;-Acyloxy Carboxamides: Unlocking a Forbidden Chemical Space in the Passerini Reaction"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A novel method is presented, demonstrating the facile generation of &#945;-acyloxy carboxamide radicals via photoredox catalysis of Passerini adducts, obtained employing a 4-formyl-1,4-dihydropyridine. These radicals efficiently undergo Giese reactions with various olefins, yielding novel Passerini compounds unattainable through traditional aldehyde-based routes.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The facile generation of the &#945;-acyloxy carboxamide radical is hereby reported for the first time, utilizing a photoredox catalyzed reaction of Passerini adducts synthesized using a 4-formyl-1,4-dihydropyridine as the carbonyl component. This radical effectively engages in a Giese reaction with a range of olefins, ultimately leading to the synthesis of novel Passerini-derived products not previously amenable to direct aldehyde-based transformations. Consequently, the resulting strategy, developed both in batch and in flow, offers a promising opportunity to expand the chemical space accessible through the Passerini reaction, virtually incorporating &#8220;impossible&#8221; aldehydes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Front Cover: Covalently Linked 5,6,11,12&#8208;Tetraazanaphthacene Dimer and Its Triptycene&#8208;Capped Derivatives as Electron Acceptors (Chem. Eur. J. 50/2024)</title>

5,6,11,12&#8208;Tetraazanaphthacene (TANC), from the family of azaacenes, is a conveniently synthesised electron acceptor. To further increase the electron affinity of TANC, an extended dimer bi&#8208;TANC with a single covalent bond was developed. Regrettably, the larger bi&#8208;TANC had only severely poor solubility. This has been dramatically improved in bi&#8208;TpTANC, in which both ends of bi&#8208;TANC are end&#8208;capped with triptycene (Tp). The electrochemistry of bi&#8208;TpTANC in solution confirms its higher electron affinity with a LUMO level of &#8722;4.1&#8197;eV, making it a potentially practical n&#8208;type material. More information can be found in the Research Article by H. Kamebuchi, M. Tadokoro and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202400632).

An aquarium contains the materials for synthesizing the marine natural products (15S)&#8208; and (15R)&#8208;prostaglandin&#8197;A2. Both epimers can be isolated from the sea whip Plexaura homomalla. While the (15S)&#8208;prostaglandin&#8197;A2 (left) significantly reduced GABA&#8208;induced currents through GABAA receptors, its 15R epimer (right) did not show any significant effect. The bubbler on the left side is shaped like Spittelau, a Viennese landmark located near the lab. More information can be found in the Research Article by N. Sch&#252;tzenmeister and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202401921).

         <dc:description>
Aiming to contribute to eradicate a certain naivet&#233; common to many research chemists specializing in green chemistry and catalysis, this study illustrates through selected examples of reproducible green syntheses using hybrid sol&#8208;gel catalysts from doctoral theses and research articles published between 2013 and early 2024, how said catalysts have been applied to a number industrially relevant green synthetic methods.







Abstract
Referring to selected examples of reproducible green syntheses using hybrid sol&#8208;gel catalysts of the SiliaCat series from different doctoral theses and research works published between 2015 and early 2024, this study briefly illustrates how said catalysts have been applied in a number of green synthetic methods of significant industrial relevance. This shows evidence that the nanochemistry &#8220;bottom&#8208;up&#8221; sol&#8208;gel approach based on catalytic species entrapped in organically modified silicas as effective and versatile heterogeneous catalysts developed between the late 1990s and 2010 has succeeded. Subsequent developments will show how the use of said materials in automated syntheses, supplying data to machine learning algorithms actually leads to faster and cheaper optimization of the reaction conditions. Said progress ultimately will further accelerate industrial uptake of heterogeneous catalysis under flow in the fine chemical industry whose reluctance to change processes was due to the need to replace financially amortized (and expensive) production plants.

         <title>Recognition&#8208;Encoded Molecules: a Minimal Self&#8208;Replicator</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nucleic acids, with their unique duplex structure, which is key for information replication, have sparked interest in self&#8208;replication's role in life's origins. Early template&#8208;based replicators, initially built on short oligonucleotides, expanded to include peptides and synthetic molecules. We explore here the potential of a class of synthetic duplex&#8208;forming oligoanilines, as self&#8208;replicators. We have recently developed oligoanilines equipped with 2&#8208;trifluoromethylphenol&#8211;phosphine oxide H&#8208;bond base pairs and we investigate whether the imine formed between aniline and aldehyde complementary monomers can self&#8208;replicate. Despite lacking a clear sigmoidal kinetic profile, control experiments with a methylated donor and a competitive inhibitor support self&#8208;replication. Further investigations with the reduced aniline dimer demonstrate templated synthesis, revealing a characteristic parabolic growth. After showing sequence selective duplex formation, templated synthesis and the emergence of catalytic function, the self&#8208;replication behaviour further suggests that the unique properties of nucleic acids can be paralleled by synthetic recognition&#8208;encoded molecules.</dc:description>

         <title>Bis&#8208;Squaramide&#8208;Based [2]Rotaxane Hosts for Anion Recognition</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The first examples of bis&#8208;squaramide axle containing [2]rotaxanes linked via rigid aryl and flexible alkyl spacers synthesised using copper(I) catalysed active metal template methodology are reported. The halide and oxoanion binding properties of the [2]rotaxanes in aqueous&#8208;organic solvent media are examined through extensive 1H&#8208;NMR titration experiments to investigate the impact of integrating multiple squaramide motifs on the anion binding capabilities of the interlocked receptors. These studies reveal that the bis&#8208;squaramide rotaxane host systems exhibit enhanced halide anion binding capabilities relative to a mono&#8208;squaramide axle functionalised rotaxane, demonstrating a rare anti&#8208;Hofmeister bias halide anion selectivity trend in aqueous&#8208;organic mixtures and highlighting the efficacy of the potent solvent shielded hydrophobic interlocked binding pocket created upon mechanical bond formation. Notably, employing a rigid aryl linker between the two squaramide motifs in the axle component enables the rotaxane host to exhibit strong and selective binding of tetrahedral oxoanions. Conversely, a flexible alkyl spacer facilitates trigonal oxoanion selective recognition by the bis&#8208;squaramide [2]rotaxane.</dc:description>

Trans to cis isomerization of the attached photoswitchable moieties in the Au(I) complex enables four&#8208;fold decrement in the rate of oxazoline formation reaction. Whereas the progress of the copper(I) catalyzed, azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition reaction gets reduced by at least threefold. Alternate exposure to UV and blue light could easily toggle the rate of reactions remotely. The catalytic activity of thermodynamically stable trans&#8208;trans isomers is found to be similar to the common N&#8208;aryl substituted NHC&#8208;Au/Cu(I) complexes. NHC&#8208;Au(I) and &#8208;Cu(I) compounds bearing (trans)azobenzene moieties were characterized by X&#8208;ray diffraction. Photoswitching, recyclability studies, and the metastable isomer's thermal half&#8208;life in both complexes were studied via UV&#8208;visible spectroscopy. Whereas the extent of photoswitching and concomitant formation of geometrical isomers were investigated by using&#160;1H&#8208;NMR&#160;spectroscopic study.

         <title>Functionalized &#945;&#8208;Cyanostilbene Derivatives for Detection of Hypoxia or Proteostasis Imbalance in Live Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>&#945;&#8208;Cyanostilbene represents one of the easily functionalized aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) scaffolds. It has been widely adopted for the construction of fluorescent materials for broad applications. Here, we further expanded the utilization of &#945;&#8208;cyanostilbene derivatives for the detection of hypoxia or proteostasis imbalance in live cells. Four different amine containing donors were introduced to construct &#945;&#8208;cyanostilbene derivatives (R&#8208;ASC) with donor&#8208;acceptor scaffolds. Equipped with the cysteine (Cys) reactive group, maleimide (MI), R&#8208;ASC&#8208;MI shows fluorescence turn&#8208;on property upon binding with unfolded proteins in vitro and in live cells under proteostatic stress. By virtue of R&#8208;ASC&#8208;MI, the level of unfolded protein loads in cells can be quantified by flow cytometry, or visualized under microscope. Furthermore, we also characterized the performance of R&#8208;ASC&#8208;NO2, synthetic precursors of R&#8208;ASC&#8208;MI, in cellular hypoxia. R&#8208;ASC&#8208;NO2 revealed upregulated activities of nitroreductase, as well as increased hydrophobicity in live cells, under either chemical (NaN3) induced or atmospheric (1% O2) hypoxia. Together, the advantages of easy modification and high signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio of new &#945;&#8208;cyanostilbene derivatives reported in this work highlight the great potential of &#945;&#8208;cyanostilbene in constructing functional biosensors and many other domains.</dc:description>

         <title>Structure&#8208;Activity Relationships in Supramolecular Hosts Targeting Bacterial Phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) Lipids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The World Health Organization has described the antimicrobial resistance crisis as one of the top ten global public health threats. New antimicrobial agents that can fight infections caused by antimicrobial resistant pathogens are therefore needed. A potential strategy is the development of small molecules that can selectively interact with bacterial membranes (or membranes of other microbial pathogens), and thereby rapidly kill the bacteria. Here, we report the structure&#8208;activity relationship within a group of 22 compounds that were designed to bind the bacterial lipid phosphatidylethanolamine (PE). Liposome&#8208;based studies reveal that the lipophilicity of the compounds has the strongest effect on both the affinity and selectivity for PE. The best results were obtained for compounds with logP &#8776; 3.75, which showed a 5x to 7x selectivity for bacterial PE lipids over human PC (phosphatidylcholine) lipids. Furthermore, these compounds also showed potent antibacterial activity against the Gram&#8208;positive bacterium B. cereus, with minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) below 10 &#181;M, a concentration where they showed minimal hemolytic activity against human red blood cells. These results not only show the possibility of PE&#8208;binding small molecules to function as antibiotics, but also provide guidelines for the development of compounds targeting other types of biologically relevant membrane lipids.</dc:description>

Here, we report the structure-activity relationship within a group of 22 compounds that were designed to bind the bacterial lipid phosphatidylethanolamine (PE). Liposome-based studies reveal that the lipophilicity of the compounds has the strongest effect on both the affinity and selectivity for PE. The best results were obtained for compounds with logP &#8776; 3.75, which showed a 5x to 7x selectivity for bacterial PE lipids over human PC (phosphatidylcholine) lipids. Furthermore, these compounds also showed potent antibacterial activity against the Gram-positive bacterium B. cereus, with minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) below 10 &#181;M, a concentration where they showed minimal hemolytic activity against human red blood cells. These results not only show the possibility of PE-binding small molecules to function as antibiotics, but also provide guidelines for the development of compounds targeting other types of biologically relevant membrane lipids.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Counterion Exchange Enhances the Brightness and Photostability of a Fluorous Cyanine Dye</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fluorofluorophores are a unique class of fluorophores that can be solubilized in perfluorocarbons (PFCs) and used to study biological systems. However, because of the low dielectric constant and high oxygen solubility in the fluorous phase, the brightness and photostability of the fluorofluorophores are significantly diminished. Here, we leveraged the tight ion pairing in the fluorous phase to improve the photophysical properties of a fluorous soluble pentamethine dye (FCy5) via counterion exchange. We found that larger, softer, fluorinated, aryl borate counterions promote the ideal polymethine state where charge delocalization across the polymethine chain increases the brightness (6&#8208;fold) and photostability (55&#8208;fold) of FCy5.</dc:description>

         <title>Novel Methods for the Formation of Free Carbyne Radicals in Solution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Carbyne free radicals RC&#8942; (RC) are usually associated with high&#8208;energy processes, thus research on their preparation, chemical reactivity, and prevalence under mild conditions is scarce. Recently, it was reported that metallo&#8208;complexes containing CR ligands may undergo spontaneous degradation in aqueous solutions to produce free RC radicals. These highly reactive species may react with each other to form the corresponding alkyne and other products. The reaction of 1,1,1 halo&#8208;carbo&#8208;hydrates with Cr(II) ions also forms RC radicals under mild conditions. Herein, we report two additional synthetic routes that produce free RC radicals under mild conditions. First, the reaction between metallic zinc and acetic anhydride produces 2&#8208;butyne and several other C2, C3, and C4 compounds. Isotopic&#8208;labeling experiments indicate that the formation of 2&#8208;butyne results from an inter&#8208;molecular reaction in which two RC moieties from two acetic anhydride molecules combine in solution. In addition, the degradation of the tri&#8208;molybdenum complex [Mo3(H3CC&#8801;CCH3)(OAc)(H2O)2Br7], in which a 2&#8208;butyne ligand is coordinated to the Mo3 framework in a &#956;3&#8208;&#951;2 (&#8869;) binding mode in aqueous solution produces several C2, C3, C4 and C5 molecules. This indicates the formation of free CH3C radicals by a homolytic cleavage of the carbon&#8208;carbon triple bond.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>A curved nanographene, conceptually by insertion of nitrogen into a trapezoidal planar nanographene at the edge was synthesized by &#960;&#8208;extension of the nitrogen&#8208;doped hexa&#8208;peri&#8208;hexabenzocoronene.

The bent &#960;&#8208;extension exhibited a low degree of conjugation suggested by calculation results.

         <title>N&#8208;Vacancy Enriched Porous BN Fibers for Enhanced Polysulfides Adsorption and Conversion in High&#8208;Performance Lithium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presented herein centers on the fabrication of one&#8208;dimensional (1D) BN fibers with abundant pores and sufficient N&#8208;vacancy defects, achieved through a unique strategy of thermal crystallization following a pre&#8208;condensation step. After incorporating these fibers with highly interweaved bacterial cellulose (BC) followed by carbonization, the resulting Nv&#8208;BN@CBC exhibited higher specific capacity, superior rate capability, and more stable cycling performance.







Abstract
Severe shuttle effect of soluble polysulfides and sluggish redox kinetics have been thought of as the critical issues hindering the extensive applications of lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries (LSBs). Herein, one&#8208;dimensional boron nitride (1D BN) fibers with abundant pores and sufficient N&#8208;vacancy defects were synthesized using a thermal crystallization following a pre&#8208;condensation step. The 1D structure of BN facilitates unblocked ions diffusion pathways during charge/discharge cycles. The embedded pores within the polar BN strengthen the immobilization of polysulfides via both physical confinement and chemical interaction. Moreover, the highly exposed active surface area and intentionally created N&#8208;vacancy sites substantially promote reaction kinetics by lowering the energy barriers of the rate&#8208;limiting steps. After incorporating with conductive carbon networks and elemental S, the as&#8208;prepared S/Nv&#8208;BN@CBC cathode of LSBs deliver an initial discharge capacity of up to 1347&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 200&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1, while maintaining a low decay rate of 0.03&#8201;% per cycle over 1000&#8197;cycles at 1600&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1. This work offers an effective strategy to mitigate the shuttle effect and highlights the significant potential of defect&#8208;engineered BN in accelerating the reaction kinetics of LSBs.

         <title>A Peptide Strategy for Inhibiting Different Protein Aggregation Pathways</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
General peptide inhibitors of protein aggregation were developed by discovering the molecular determinants of inherent anti&#8208;aggregation activity. Substitutions maximizing &#960;&#8208;stacking, H&#8208;bonding and flexibility further enhanced the potency of natural inhibitors. So&#8208;designed peptides potently inhibited unrelated proteins aggregating via different mechanisms ranging from amorphous aggregation to Tau and Huntingtin amyloid aggregation.







Abstract
Protein aggregation correlates with many human diseases. Protein aggregates differ in structure and shape. Strategies to develop effective aggregation inhibitors that reach the clinic failed so far. Here, we developed a family of peptides targeting early aggregation stages for both amorphous and fibrillar aggregates of proteins unrelated in sequence and structure. They act on dynamic precursors before mechanistic differentiation takes place. Using peptide arrays, we first identified peptides inhibiting the amorphous aggregation of a molten globular, aggregation&#8208;prone mutant of the Axin tumor suppressor. Optimization revealed that the peptides activity did not depend on their sequences but rather on their molecular determinants: a composition of 20&#8211;30&#8201;% flexible, 30&#8211;40&#8201;% aliphatic and 20&#8211;30&#8201;% aromatic residues, a hydrophobicity/hydrophilicity ratio close to 1, and an even distribution of residues of different nature throughout the sequence. The peptides also suppressed fibrillation of Tau, a disordered protein that forms amyloids in Alzheimer's disease, and slowed down that of Huntingtin Exon1, an amyloidogenic protein in Huntington's disease, both entirely unrelated to Axin. Our compounds thus target early stages of different aggregation mechanisms, inhibiting both amorphous and amyloid aggregation. Such cross&#8208;mechanistic, multi&#8208;targeting aggregation inhibitors may be lead compounds for developing drug candidates against various protein aggregation diseases.

         <dc:description>
A highly electron&#8208;deficient, water&#8208;stable, eight&#8208;electron acceptor scaffold has been used as a platform to realize proton conduction through ionic self&#8208;assembly. In this unique self&#8208;assembled material, 1D water tapes are revealed, that undergo hydrogen&#8208;bonding with halide anions, thereby generating a pathway for anion&#8208;assisted, tunable proton conduction.







Abstract
Organic &#960;&#8208;scaffolds are being envisaged for new&#8208;age electron&#8208; and ion&#8208;responsive materials that can accumulate electrons as well as transport proton. However, such systems are extremely rare as electron&#8208;deficient scaffolds are unstable in aqueous solution. Here we detail the synthesis of a water&#8208;stable core&#8208;naphthalenediimide&#8208;nitrobenzyl&#8208;viologen based tetra&#8208;cation, which accumulates up to eight&#8208;electrons within an exceptionally narrow potential window of +0.05&#8197;V and &#8722;1.12&#8197;V. The supramolecular interactions and the ensuing ionic framework are tunable based on the three anions, e.&#8201;g., Cl&#8722;, Br&#8722; and PF6&#8722;, that are investigated in this work. The ionic framework is formed and supported by a range of H&#8208;bonds, in which, the nitro benzyl groups act as pillars connecting the 1D water&#8208;tapes and the halide anions. The water molecules are hydrogen&#8208;bonded with the halide anions and bestow a facile pathway for the proton conduction, with proton conductivity up to 3.19&#215;10&#8722;3&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1. In contrast, the ionic assembly formed by the lipophilic PF6&#8722; anions do not host the water tapes and consequently the proton conductivity is found to be four orders of magnitude lower. This is a unique example, whereby proton conductivity is realized and is tunable within a highly electron&#8208;deficient, eight&#8208;electron acceptor, water&#8208;stable ionic supramolecular system.

         <title>Modular Synthesis of Azines Bearing a Guanidine Core from N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene (NHC)&#8208;Derived Selenoureas and Diazo Reagents</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The present study introduces a novel transformation between N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene&#8208;derived selenoureas and diazo compounds in the presence of triphenylphosphine. Products incorporating both an azine and a guanidine moiety are obtained, with potential applications in pharmaceuticals, materials chemistry, and organic synthesis.







Abstract
N&#8208;Heterocyclic carbene (NHC)&#8208;derived selenoureas comprise a fundamentally important class of NHC derivatives, with key applications in coordination chemistry and the determination of NHC electronic properties. Considering the broad reactivity of chalcogen&#8208;containing compounds, it is surprising to note that the use of NHC&#8208;derived selenoureas as organic synthons remains essentially unexplored. The present contribution introduces a novel, straightforward transformation leading to azines bearing a guanidine moiety, through the reaction of a wide range of NHC&#8208;derived selenoureas with commercially available diazo compounds, in the presence of triphenylphosphine. This transformation offers a new approach to such products, having biological, materials chemistry, and organic synthesis applications. The guanidine&#8208;bearing azines are obtained in excellent yields, with all manipulations taking place in air. A reaction mechanism is proposed, based on both experimental mechanistic findings and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. A one&#8208;pot, multicomponent transesterification reaction between selenoureas, &#945;&#8208;diazoesters, alcohols, and triphenylphosphine was also developed, providing highly functionalized azines.

         <title>Self&#8208;Replication Without Hydrogen&#8208;Bonds: An Exobiotic Design</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Exobiotic self&#8208;replication: When sulfur is positioned between the two nitrogens of benzothiadiazole, it can engage in edge&#8208;on molecular recognition events. We present a new potential self&#8208;replicating system based on this interaction, and evidence for autocatalysis. The designs have implications for exobiology, due to their cosmic similarities and potential for genetic capacity.







Abstract
Life on Earth uses DNA as the central template for self&#8208;replication, genetic encoding, and information transfer. However, there are no physical laws precluding life's existence elsewhere in space, and alternative life forms may not need DNA. In the search for exobiology, knowing what to look for as a biosignature remains a challenge &#8211; especially if it is not from the obvious list of biologic building blocks. Clues from chemicals recently discovered on Mars and in the Taurus Molecular Cloud 1 (TMC&#8208;1), show that intriguing organic compounds exist beyond Earth, which could provide a starting point for unconventional exobiotic designs. Here we present a new potential self&#8208;replicating system with structural similarities to recently discovered compounds on Mars and TMC&#8208;1. Rather than using DNA's hydrogen&#8208;bonding motif for reliable base&#8208;paring, our design employs sulfur&#8208;nitrogen interactions to selectively template unique benzothiadiazole units in sequence. We synthesized and studied two versions of this system, one reversible and the other irreversible, and found experimental evidence of self&#8208;replication in d&#8208;chloroform solvent. These results are part of a larger pursuit in our lab for developing a basis for a potential exobiological system using starting blocks closely related to these cosmic compounds.

         <title>Synthesis, Characterization and Interconversion of p&#8211;Tolylsulfone&#8208;Functionalized Norbornadiene/Quadricyclane Couples</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A family of new push&#8211;pull functionalized norbornadiene/quadricyclane (NBD/QC) couples was generated and investigated. For the first time the para&#8208;tolylsulfone moiety was chosen as electron&#8208;withdrawing group. The library was comprehensively examined regarding their interconversion capability and photophysical properties.







Abstract
We report the synthesis and characterization of library of new 2,3&#8211;disubstituted norbornadiene/quadricyclane couples. For the first time, the para&#8211;tolylsulfone moiety was employed as electron&#8211;withdrawing substituent in combination with a variety of different electron donors as counterparts. Comprehensive characterization was conducted for every interconversion couple. By comparison with structurally related molecules published before we established the tosyl moiety as suitable alternative to previously investigated ester functionalities by providing similar photophysical properties. The photo&#8211;induced interconversion behavior was investigated via UV/Vis&#8208; and NMR&#8211;spectroscopy. The UV/Vis experiments were carried out exclusively in acetonitrile, whereas several solvents were investigated in the NMR studies. A detailed description and comparison of the isomerization behavior is provided, while examining relevant optical properties like &#955;max and &#955;onset. Thereby, an enhanced red&#8208;shift up to &#955;max=394&#8197;nm combined with an &#955;onset value of 469&#8197;nm could be generated which is necessary for potential applications.

         <title>Redox Transformations of the OX063 Radical in Biological Media: Oxidative Decay of Initial Trityl with Further Formation of Structurally&#8208;Modified TAM</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We studied in details redox reactions of OX063 radical in biological media. These reactions can introduce distortions into EPR oximetry data derived for objects under hypoxia, and they may possibly pose obstacles to the successful application of TAMs to spin&#8208;labeling of biopolymers for experiments in&#8197;vivo or in the cell. The use of 13C labeling to track these reactions is described.







Abstract
Being a low&#8208;toxic and hydrophilic representative of TAM, OX063 has shown its suitability for in&#8208;vivo and in&#8208;cell EPR experiments and design of spin labels. Using 13C labeling, we investigated the course of oxidative degradation of OX063 into quinone&#8208;methide (QM) under the influence of superoxide as well as further thiol&#8208;promoted reduction of QM into TAM radical, which formally corresponds to substitution of a carboxyl function by a hydroxyl group. We found these transformations being quantitative in model reactions mimicking specific features of biological media and confirmed the presence of these reactions in the blood and liver homogenate of mice in&#8197;vitro. The emergence of the trityl with the hydroxyl group can be masked by an initial TAM in EPR spectra and may introduce distortions into EPR&#8208;derived oximetry data if they have been obtained for objects under hypoxia. 13C labeling allows one to detect its presence, considering its different hyperfine splitting constant on 13C1 (2.04&#8197;mT) as compared to OX063 (2.30&#8197;mT). The potential involvement of these reactions should be considered when using TAM in spin&#8208;labeling of biopolymers intended for subsequent EPR experiments, as well as in the successful application of TAM in experiments in&#8197;vivo and in cell.

Using &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C labeling, we investigated the course of oxidative degradation of OX063 into quinone-methide (QM) under the influence of superoxide as well as further thiol-promoted reduction of QM into TAM radical, which formally corresponds to substitution of a carboxyl function by a hydroxyl group. We found these transformations being quantitative in model reactions mimicking specific features of biological media and confirmed the presence of these reactions in the blood and liver homogenate of mice &lt;i&gt;in&#8197;vitro&lt;/i&gt;. The emergence of the trityl with the hydroxyl group can be masked by an initial TAM in EPR spectra and may introduce distortions into EPR-derived oximetry data if they have been obtained for objects under hypoxia. &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C labeling allows one to detect its presence, considering its different hyperfine splitting constant on &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; (2.04&#8197;mT) as compared to OX063 (2.30&#8197;mT). The potential involvement of these reactions should be considered when using TAM in spin-labeling of biopolymers intended for subsequent EPR experiments, as well as in the successful application of TAM in experiments &lt;i&gt;in&#8197;vivo&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;in cell&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Quantitative Characterization of RCA&#8208;Based DNA Hydrogels &#8211; Towards Rational Materials Design</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The impact of template sequences and reaction conditions on the synthesis of DNA hydrogels via Rolling Circle Amplification (RCA) was systematically investigated. The employed methodology is high&#8208;throughput capable and facilitates the development of sequence&#8208;property relationships by correlating reaction process parameters with synthesis efficiency and mechanical material properties.







Abstract
DNA hydrogels hold significant promise for biomedical applications and can be synthesized through enzymatic Rolling Circle Amplification (RCA). Due to the exploratory nature of this emerging field, standardized RCA protocols specifying the impact of reaction parameters are currently lacking. This study varied template sequences and reagent concentrations, evaluating RCA synthesis efficiency and hydrogel mechanical properties through quantitative PCR (qPCR) and indentation measurements, respectively. Primer concentration and stabilizing additives showed minimal impact on RCA efficiency, while changes in polymerase and nucleotide concentrations had a stronger effect. Concentration of the circular template exerted the greatest influence on RCA productivity. An exponential correlation between hydrogel viscosity and DNA amplicon concentration was observed, with nucleobase sequence significantly affecting both amplification efficiency and material properties, particularly through secondary structures. This study suggests that combining high&#8208;throughput experimental methods with structural folding prediction offers a viable approach for systematically establishing structure&#8208;property relationships, aiding the rational design of DNA hydrogel material systems.

         <title>Adsorption of Prochiral Solvent Molecules by Surface&#8208;Confined Chiral Supramolecular Assemblies: How Solvent Impacts on&#8208;Surface Chirality</title>

Adsorption of a prochiral solvent molecule in porous SAMNs formed by a chiral dehydrobenzo[12]annulene derivative leads to the reversal of supramolecular chirality of the SAMN through the prochirality recognition of a solvent molecule.







Abstract
The understanding of supramolecular chirality in self&#8208;assembled molecular networks (SAMNs) on surfaces generates a lot of interest because of its relation to the production of chiral sensors, reactors, and catalysts. We herein report the adsorption of a prochiral solvent molecule in porous SAMNs formed by a chiral dehydrobenzo[12]annulene (cDBA) derivative. Through the prochirality recognition of a solvent molecule, the supramolecular chirality of the SAMN is switched: the cDBA exclusively forms a counter&#8208;clockwise pore through co&#8208;adsorption of the solvent molecule in prochiral 1,2,4&#8208;trichlorobenzene, while in 1&#8208;phenyloctane it produces the opposite chiral, clockwise pore. The prochirality recognition of the solvent molecule in the chiral SAMN pores is attributed to the adaptable conformational changes of the chiral chains of the cDBA molecule.

         <title>Oxidative N&#8722;N Bond Formation Versus the Curtius Rearrangement</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present herein some experimental results, including NMR and x&#8208;ray, which have led to the recent retraction of a Nature Communications article claiming to feature a metal&#8208;free cross&#8208;dehydrogenative N&#8722;N coupling of primary amides with amines under the action of a hypervalent iodine oxidant. These findings should help the chemical research community to avoid such pitfalls in the future.







Abstract
The oxidative formation of N&#8722;N bonds from primary amides has been recently reported and then retracted in the journal Nature Communications by Kathiravan, Nicholls, and co&#8208;authors, utilizing a hypervalent iodane reagent. Unfortunately, the authors failed to recognize the Curtius reaction taking place under the described reaction conditions. Thus, the claimed N&#8722;N coupling products were not formed. Instead, the Curtius rearrangement urea coupling products were obtained. We demonstrate this herein by means of NMR and x&#8208;ray analysis, as well as with the support of an alternative synthetic route.

         <title>Tweezer Dyads for H&#8208;Bond Assisted Cooperativity in Tandem Uncaging Systems</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>

Tweezer dyads synthesized by click chemistry harness large two&#8208;photon absorption in the NIR region from quadrupolar antenna and enhancement of the uncaging efficiency via electron transfer sensitization leading to very high two&#8208;photon sensitivity.







Abstract
&#8220;Tandem&#8221; uncaging systems, in which a photolabile protecting group (PPG) is sensitized by an energy&#8208;harvesting antenna, may increase the photosensitivity of PPGs by several orders of magnitude for two&#8208;photon (2P) photorelease. Yet, they remain poorly accessible because of arduous multi&#8208;step synthesis. In this work, we design efficient tandem uncaging systems by (i) using a convenient assembly of the building blocks relying on click chemistry, (ii) introducing H&#8208;bonding induced proximity thus facilitating (iii) photoinduced electron transfer (PeT) as a cooperative mechanism. A strong two&#8208;photon absorber electron&#8208;donating quadrupolar antenna and various electron&#8208;accepting PPGs (mDEAC, MNI or MDNI) were clicked stepwise onto a &#8220;tweezer&#8208;shaped&#8221; pyrido&#8208;2,6&#8208;dicarboxylate platform whose H&#8208;bonding and &#960;&#8208;stacking abilities were exploited to keep the antenna and the PPGs in close proximity. The different electron&#8208;accepting ability of the PPGs led to dyads with wildly different behaviors. Whilst the MDNI and MNI dyads showed poor dark stability or no photo&#8208;uncaging ability due to their too high electron&#8208;accepting character, the mDEAC dyad benefited from optimum redox potentials to promote PeT and slow down charge recombination, resulting in enhanced uncaging quantum yield (&#934;u=0.38) compared to mDEAC (&#934;u=0.014). This unique combination resulted in large 2P photo&#8208;sensitivity in the near&#8208;infrared window (240&#8197;GM at 710&#8197;nm).

         <title>Decarboxylative Alkylation of Carboxylic Acids with Easily Oxidizable Functional Groups Catalyzed by an Imidazole&#8208;Coordinated Fe3 Cluster under Visible Light Irradiation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Decarboxylative alkylation of carboxylic acids with easily oxidizable functional groups such as phenol and indole functionalities was achieved using a catalytic amount of basic iron(III) acetate, Fe(OAc)2(OH), in the presence of benzimidazole under 427 nm LED irradiation. Kinetic analyses of this catalytic reaction revealed that the reaction rate is first&#8208;order in alkenes and is linearly correlated with the light intensity; the faster reaction rate for the benzimidazole&#8208;ligated species was consistent with the increased absorbance in the visible light region. Wide functional group tolerance for the easily oxidizable groups is ascribed to the weak oxidation ability of the in situ&#8208;generated oxo&#8208;bridged iron clusters compared with other iron(III) species.</dc:description>

         <title>Harnessing Gene Editing Technology for Tumor Microenvironment Modulation: An Emerging Anticancer Strategy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cancer is a multifaceted disease influenced by both intrinsic cellular traits and extrinsic factors, with the tumor microenvironment (TME) being crucial in its progression. To satisfy their high proliferation and aggressiveness, cancer cell always plunders large amounts of nutrition and releases various signals to the surrounding, forming a dynamic TME with special metabolic, immune, microbial and physical characteristics. Due to the neglect of interactions between tumor cell and TME, traditional cancer therapies often struggle with challenges such as drug resistance, low efficacy, and recurrence. Importantly, with the development of gene editing technologies, particularly the CRISPR&#8208;Cas system, offers promising new strategies for cancer treatment. Combined with nanomaterials strategies, CRISPR&#8208;Cas technology exhibits precision, affordability, and user&#8208;friendliness with reduced side effects, which holds great promise for profoundly altering the TME at a genetic level, potentially leading to lasting anticancer outcomes. This review will delve into how CRISPR&#8208;Cas can be leveraged to manipulate the TME, examining its potential as a transformative anticancer therapy.</dc:description>

         <title>Formation to Transportation: En&#8208;Route Fission&#8208;Facilitated Formation of Spheres in a Phosphorus&#8208;Based Porous Organic Polymer for Transportation of Iodine</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Despite its potential as a clean power source to meet rising electricity demands, nuclear energy generates radioactive waste, including isotopes of iodine, that pose significant environmental and health risks. There is a growing demand to capture radioactive iodine and repurpose it effectively. However, achieving this dual functionality with a single material remains a significant challenge. This study explores phosphorus&#8208;based porous organic polymers (P&#8208;POPs) as probes for these dual functionalities. By employing 4&#8208;formyl(triphenyl)phosphine (BB1) and phenyl&#8208;1,4&#8208;diacetonitrile (BB2) under the Knoevenagel polycondensation method, P&#8208;POPs (PKPOPs) have been synthesized that exhibit a smooth spherical morphology, which efficiently captures and release iodine under ambient conditions, facilitating efficient transportation of molecular iodine. This novel approach aims to potentially transform nuclear waste into valuable organic feedstock via an iodination reaction. The innovative application of PKPOP has also been demonstrated for iodination reactions using ball mills and under continuous flow conditions, showcasing its potential for safer waste management and utilization.</dc:description>

         <title>Investigating the Mechanism of Triboluminescence: Insights from Structural and Electrostatic Characterization of Copper Thiocyanate Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The creation of oppositely charged pairs, followed by their recombination to exhibit triboluminescence upon disrupting intermolecular interactions during mechanical fracture of crystal, was characterized by X&#8208;ray analysis and theoretical calculations. This study elucidated the crucial role of charge separation in triboluminescence and enabled its activation and deactivation through molecular network design.







Abstract
Triboluminescence is a phenomenon in which light is generated through mechanical stress; it has emerging applications in stress&#8208;sensing devices. Although the prevailing mechanistic model indicates that light emits from charge separation and recombination in fracture planes arising from polar structures, its application in designing triboluminescent materials remains limited owing to numerous exceptions. This study provides insights into the essential requirements for triboluminescence by investigating the structural and electrostatic properties of fractured crystals of copper thiocyanate complexes. The examined fracture plane indicated that charge pairs (which are essential for light emission) form when intermolecular interactions are disrupted during fracturing. On the basis of the nature of these charges, we successfully suppressed triboluminescence by inhibiting the formation of intermolecular interactions disrupted in the examined complexes. Furthermore, we induced its re&#8208;emergence by creating an alternative fracture plane through controlled manipulation of the molecular network. This demonstrative deactivation and reactivation of triboluminescence underscores the critical role of intermolecular disruption in generating charge pairs, a prerequisite for triboluminescence.

         <dc:description>
Hemipiperazines are recently reported biocompatible molecular photoswitches based on cyclic dipeptides. Here we demonstrate a multistimuli&#8208;responsive hemipiperazine&#8208;based system that reacts on light, solvents, acidity and presence of metal ions.

Abstract
Advance in the design of molecular photoswitches &#8208; adapters that convert light into changes at molecular level &#8208; opens up exciting possibilities in preparing smart polymers, drugs photoactivated inside humans, or light&#8208;fueled nanomachines that might in the future operate in our bloodstream. Hemipiperazines are recently reported biocompatible molecular photoswitches based on cyclic dipeptides. Here we report a multistimuli&#8208;responsive hemipiperazine&#8208;based switch that reacts on light, solvents, acidity, or metal ions. Its photoequilibration is controlled by the intramolecular hydrogen bonding pattern.

         <title>Origins of Temperature&#8208;Dependent Anomeric Selectivity in Glycosylations with an L&#8211;Idose Thioglycoside</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Computational modelling reveals the key mechanistic details explaining why glycosylations involving L&#8208;idose thioglycoside donors, and potentially also a wide range of other donors, become increasingly &#945;&#8208;selective as the temperature is raised.







Abstract
L&#8211;Idose thioglycosides are useful glycosyl donors for the construction of glycosaminoglycan oligosaccharides. When activated with NIS and catalytic TMSOTf in the presence of methanol, the stereoselectivity of O&#8208;glycosylation displays an intriguing dependence on the reaction temperature, with an increased preference for formation of the &#945;&#8208;glycoside at higher temperatures. Using a combination of vt&#8208;NMR spectroscopy and DFT calculations, we show how a simple mechanistic model, based on competing reactions of the iodinated thioglycoside, can explain the main features of the temperature dependence. In this model, the increased selectivity at high temperature is attributed to differences among the entropy and energy terms of the competing reaction pathways. Neighbouring&#8208;group participation (giving an intermediate acyloxonium ion) plays an increasingly dominant role as temperature is raised. The general features of this kinetic regime may also apply more broadly to other glycosylations that likewise favour &#945;&#8208;glycoside formation at high temperature.

         <title>A Donor&#8208;Acceptor Molecular Octopus and the CLICK Procedure in Columnar Liquid Crystal Phases</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Molecular Octopus: A donor&#8208;acceptor discotic star mesogen based on a porphyrin core, bithiophene arms and decorated with four fullerenes attached via spacer forms porphyrin J&#8208;type aggregates by porphyrin&#8208;fullerene supramolecular interactions. Mixed with a complementary star providing intrinsic free space between the conjugated scaffold, the fullerenes fall into the void and assemble in completely different columnar aggregates.







Abstract
Two star&#8208;shaped mesogens with a (meso&#8208;tetraphenylporphinato) zinc (II) core and bithiophene conjugated arms with 3,4,5&#8208;trisdodecyloxyphenyl periphery were synthesized. One of these molecules was decorated with four fullerenes via an aliphatic spacer. This is the sterically overcrowded compound with an octapodal morphology. The other star lacks the fullerenes and provides free space between the conjugated arms. This mesogen does not aggregate in solution, but in solid state it forms a hexagonal columnar and a highly ordered oblique helical columnar phase, while the octopus molecule assembles in an amorphous solid. Photophysical studies of the octapodal compound in solution and the solid thin film reveal the formation of J&#8208;type aggregates, in which the interaction between donors (porphyrin) and acceptors (fullerene) dominates leading to absorption bands in the NIR region of the spectra. The mixture of both compounds results in a self&#8208;assembly which is called the Click procedure. Fullerenes of the octopus nanosegregate in the pockets of the star mesogens generating hexagonal columnar structures with a regular stacking along the columnar axis. Thus providing free space is a tool to control the competition between supramolecular interactions and nanosegregation. Such liquid&#8208;crystalline donor&#8208;acceptor structures may play a role in future LC photovoltaic applications.

         <title>A Phosphorus&#8208;Centred, Zirconocene&#8208;Bridged Tetraradical: Synthesis, Structure and Application as Molecular Double Switch</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first synthesis of a phosphorus&#8208;centred tetraradical linked to a zirconocene fragment is presented, which can act as a molecular switch both in solution and in the solid state. This new hybrid switch was used to switch H2 addition on and off, which can be controlled photochemically.







Abstract
Biradicals are important intermediates in the formation and breaking of a chemical bond. Their use as molecular switches is of particular interest. Much less is known about tetraradicals, which can, for example, consist of two biradical(oid) units. Here we report the synthesis of the first persistent phosphorus&#8208;centred tetraradical bound to a transition metal fragment. Starting from a zirconocene complex, rac&#8208;(ebthi)ZrCl2 (rac&#8208;(ebthi)=1,2&#8208;ethylene&#8208;1,10&#8208;bis(&#951;5&#8208;tetrahydroindenyl), two cyclo&#8208;1,3&#8208;diphospha&#8208;pentane&#8208;1,3&#8208;diyls were successfully introduced, which finally led to the isolation of a deep green zirconcene&#8208;bridged bis(biradicaloid) complex (5) that can act as a double molecular switch. Under the influence of light (570&#8197;nm), this tetraradical forms a transannular bond in each of the two five&#8208;membered biradical units, leading to the formation of housane 5&#8201;h. Upon irradiation at 415&#8197;nm, the reverse reaction is observed, fully recovering tetraradical 5. Through single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal transformation, both stable species of the molecular switch could be structurally characterised using SCXRD. The switching under the influence of light and the activation of molecular hydrogen were analysed in solution using NMR and UV spectroscopy. It was found that the addition of one or two equivalents of molecular hydrogen can be switched on and off by light.

         <title>Benzothiadiazole&#8208;Based Ordered Mesoporous Polymer as a Versatile, Metal&#8208;Free Heterogeneous Photocatalyst</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A benzothiadiazole&#8208;functionalized ordered mesoporous polymer (OMP) is synthesized by an evaporation induced self&#8208;assembly (EISA) approach, which is used as a versatile heterogeneous photocatalyst for a wide variety of organic transformations (six reactions). This work suggests a new avenue to develop photoactive OMPs as next generation of heterogeneous photocatalysts.







Abstract
Visible&#8208;light active heterogeneous organophotocatalysts have recently gained considerable interest in organic synthetic community. Ordered mesoporous polymers (OMPs) are highly promising as heterogeneous alternative to traditional precious metal/organic dyes&#8208;based photocatalysts. Herein, we report the preparation of a benzothiadiazole functionalized OMPs (BT&#8208;MPs) through a &#8220;bottom&#8208;up&#8221; strategy. High ordered periodic porosity, large surface area, excellent stability and rational energy&#8208;band structures guarantee the high catalytic activity of BT&#8208;MPs. As a result, at least six conversions, e.&#8201;g., the [3+2] cycloaddition of phenols with olefins, the selective oxidation of sulfides, the C&#8208;3 thiocyanation of indole and the aminothiocyanation of &#946;&#8208;keto ester, could be promoted smoothly by BT&#8208;MPs. In addition, BT&#8208;MPs was readily recovered with well maintaining its photocatalytic activity and could be reused for at least eight times. This study highlights the potential of exploiting photoactive OMPs as recyclable, robust and metal&#8208;free heterogeneous photocatalysts.

         <title>A Well&#8208;Defined Magnesium Complex of C706&#8722;</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A well&#8208;defined soluble magnesium complex of the C706&#8722; ion has been prepared and characterised, and the various global and local changes to structure, charges and orbitals as a result of reduction and countercation coordination are discussed.







Abstract
Controlling and understanding charge state and metal coordination in carbon nanomaterials is crucial to harnessing their unique properties. Here we describe the synthesis of the well&#8208;defined fulleride complex [{(Mesnacnac)Mg}6C70], 2, (Mesnacnac)=HC(MeCNMes)2, Mes=2,4,6&#8208;Me3C6H2, from the reaction of the &#946;&#8208;diketiminate magnesium(I) complex [{(Mesnacnac)Mg}2] with C70 in aromatic solvents. The molecular structure of complex 2 was determined, providing the first high&#8208;quality structural study of a complex with the C706&#8722; ion. In combination with solution state NMR spectroscopic and DFT computational studies, the changes in geometry and charge distribution in the various atom and bond types of the fulleride unit were investigated. Additionally, the influence of the (Mesnacnac)Mg+ cations on the global and local fulleride coordination environment was examined.

         <title>Tuning the Thermal Stability of Tetra&#8208;o&#8211;chloroazobenzene Derivatives by Transforming Push&#8208;Pull to Push&#8208;Push Systems</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
From push&#8208;pull to push&#8208;push tetra&#8208;o&#8208;chloroazobenzenes: Six new tetra&#8208;o&#8208;chloroazobenzenes bearing push&#8208;pull systems displaying very short half&#8208;life for the Z&#8208;isomers (t1/2&lt;10&#8197;ms) have been successfully synthesized via the azo&#8208;coupling method. Through one&#8208;step reduction of the nitro group, the push&#8208;pull tetra&#8208;o&#8208;chloroazobenzenes can be readily transformed into the push&#8208;push derivatives, with dramatically increased thermostability for the corresponding Z&#8208;isomers (t1/2&gt;4&#8197;h). Furthermore, these functionalisable azobenzenes demonstrate excellent photostability under full&#8208;visible light irradiation.







Abstract
Molecular photoswitches provide interesting tools to reversibly control various biological functions with light. Thanks to its small size and easy introduction into the biomolecules, azobenzene derivatives have been widely employed in the field of photopharmacology. All visible&#8208;light switchable azobenzenes with controllable thermostability are highly demanded. Based on the reported tetra&#8208;o&#8208;chloroazobenzenes, we synthesized push&#8208;pull systems, by introducing dialkyl amine and nitro groups as strong electron&#8208;donating and electron&#8208;withdrawing groups on the para&#8208;positions, and then transformed to push&#8208;push systems by a simple reduction step. The developed push&#8208;pull and push&#8208;push tetra&#8208;o&#8208;chloroazobenzene derivatives displayed excellent photoswitching properties, as previously reported. The half&#8208;life of the Z&#8208;isomers can be tuned from milliseconds for the push&#8208;pull system to several hours for the push&#8208;push system. The n&#8208;&#960;* and &#960;&#8208;&#960;* transitions have better resolution in the push&#8208;push molecules, and excitation at different wavelengths can tune the E/Z ratio at the photostationary state. For one push&#8208;pull molecule, structure and absorption spectra obtained from theoretical calculations are compared with experimental data, along with data on the push&#8208;push counterpart.

         <title>Luminescent Platinum(II) Complexes with Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Flexible Lewis Pair Ligands: Spectroscopic and Computational Studies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of platinum(II) complexes containing stimuli&#8208;responsive Flexible Lewis Pair (FlexLP) ligands were synthesized and characterized. The photophysical properties of the complexes have been studied using spectroscopic techniques and theoretical calculations. The results show that these complexes exhibit readily tunable fluorescence and triplet excited&#8208;state lifetime that can be controlled by the solvent and peripheral ligands on the platinum(II) centers.







Abstract
A series of new luminescent bimetallic platinum(II) complexes with stimuli&#8208;responsive flexible Lewis pair (FlexLP) ligands are described. The FlexLP ligands consist of a dimesitylboron Lewis acid and diphenylphosphine oxide Lewis base which are in equilibrium between the unbound open form and the Lewis adduct, controlled by the hydrogen bond donating strength of the solvent. Spectroscopic techniques and density functional theory (DFT) calculations were used to interpret the photophysics of the platinum(II) complexes. All complexes exhibit tunable absorption in the region of 300&#8211;500&#8197;nm and green to orange photoluminescence, depending on the ratio of weak (THF) to strong (MeOH) hydrogen bond donating solvent employed. Spectroscopic and computational data shows that phosphine and peripheral acetylide ligands on the platinum(II) centers have limited influence on the emission energy, indicating the emission originates from the FlexLP&#8208;dominated fluorescence. Using time&#8208;resolved transient absorption spectroscopy it is shown that the complexes undergo intersystem crossing (ISC) to the triplet excited state upon photoexcitation, and the ISC efficiency is affected by the peripheral acetylide ligands. The triplet excited state lifetime can also be manipulated by the state of the FlexLP ligand, with the closed form complexes having longer lifetimes than the open form complexes.

         <title>Tetrazole and Oxadiazole Derivatives as Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Emitters</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This article explores the thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) properties of six specially designed emitters for OLEDs, focusing on how structural variations like donor&#8208;acceptor distances and functional groups influence TADF efficiency. One standout emitter, TCz&#8208;CN, shows excellent performance as a blue&#8208;green emitter, demonstrating the potential for optimizing OLED properties through precise molecular design.







Abstract
Organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) are promising lighting solutions for sustainability and energy efficiency. Incorporating thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) molecules enables OLEDs to achieve internal quantum efficiency (IQE), in principle, up to 100&#8201;%; therefore, new classes of promising TADF emitters and modifications of existing ones are sought after. This study explores the TADF emission properties of six designed TADF emitters, examining their photophysical responses using experimental and theoretical methods. The design strategy involves creating six distinct types of a donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8722;A) system, where tert&#8208;butylcarbazoles are used as donors, while the acceptor component incorporates three different functional groups: nitrile, tetrazole and oxadiazole, with varying electron&#8208;withdrawing character. Additionally, the donor&#8208;acceptor distance is adjusted using a phenylene spacer, and its influence on TADF functionality is examined. The clear dependency of an additional spacer, inhibiting TADF, could be revealed. Emitters with a direct donor&#8208;acceptor connection are demonstrated to exhibit TADF moderate emissive behavior. The analysis emphasizes the impact of charge transfer, singlet&#8208;triplet energy gaps (&#916;EST), and other microscopic parameters on photophysical rates, permitting TADF. Among the emitters, TCz&#8208;CN shows optimal performance as a blue&#8208;green emitter with an 88&#8201;% photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) and fast rate of reversible intersystem crossing of 2&#215;106&#8197;s&#8722;1 and 1&#215;107&#8197;s&#8722;1, obtained from time&#8208;resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) experiment in PMMA matrix and quantum mechanical calculations, respectively. This comprehensive exploration identifies molecular bases of superior TADF emitters and provides insights for future designs, advancing the optimization of TADF properties in OLEDs.

         <title>De&#8208; and Rearomatisation of Pyridine in Silylene Chemistry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The dearomatisation process of pyridine is facilitated by the metal&#8208;free reactions of pyridylamino&#8208;functionalized silylene with benzophenone or acetophenone. The former resulting product can undergo further rearomatisation of pyridine upon heating. Both steric hindrance and aromatic groups collectively influence the dearomatisation of pyridine in pyridylaminosilylene reactions.







Abstract
Traditional methods relying on metal&#8208;ligand cooperation for activating pyridine bonds in de&#8208; and rearomatisation are being challenged by the abundant metal&#8208;free element species as alternatives. Here, we investigated the de/re&#8208;aromatisation of pyridine facilitated by pyridylamino&#8208;functionalised silylene reactions with ketones and ketene. The reactivity outcome is highly dependent on the substituents on the ketones. By carefully tuning the steric demand of the ketone, each intermediate of the reaction sequence could be isolated. At room temperature, benzophenone and acetophenone substrates led to dearomatisation of the pyridine moiety, with the case of acetophenone showing an intermediate silaoxirane preceding dearomatisation. However, when subjected to acetone or diphenylketene, only silaoxiranes were formed without dearomatisation of the pyridine moiety. Notably, only benzophenone&#8208;derived dearomatised species demonstrated rearomatisation upon heating. Furthermore, the reduced steric bulk of the ketene facilitated further ring expansion with another equivalent of the substrate, forming sila&#8208;1,3&#8208;dioxolanes. Both steric hindrance and aromatic groups collectively influence the dearomatisation of pyridine in pyridylaminosilylene reactions.

         <title>Functional Linkers Support Targeting of Multivalent Tweezers to Taspase1</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
&#8220;Dock &amp; lock&#8221;: Supramolecular binding units mediate specific docking of the linker to lock the ligands&#8217; jaws on the protein of interest (POI). Molecular tweezers (MT) were equipped with aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) functionalities to generate spider&#8208;like inhibitors lighting up upon Taspase1 binding. Utilizing a calix[4]arene backbone resulted in a scorpion&#8208;like double pincer ligand with even superior binding and inhibition properties.







Abstract
Taspase 1 is a unique protease not only pivotal for embryonic development but also implicated in leukemias and solid tumors. As such, this enzyme is a promising while still challenging therapeutic target, and with its protein structure featuring a flexible loop preceding the active site a versatile model system for drug development. Supramolecular ligands provide a promising complementary approach to traditional small&#8208;molecule inhibitors. Recently, the multivalent arrangement of molecular tweezers allowed the successful targeting of Taspase 1&#8217;s surface loop. With this study we now want to take the next logic step und utilize functional linker systems that not only allow the implementation of novel properties but also engage in protein surface binding. Consequently, we chose two different linker types differing from the original divalent assembly: a backbone with aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) properties to enable monitoring of binding and a calix[4]arene scaffold initially pre&#8208;positioning the supramolecular binding units. With a series of four AIE&#8208;equipped ligands with stepwise increased valency we demonstrated that the functionalized AIE linkers approach ligand binding affinities in the nanomolar range and allow efficient proteolytic inhibition of Taspase 1. Moreover, implementation of the calix[4]arene backbone further enhanced the ligands&#8217; inhibitory potential, pointing to a specific linker contribution.

         <title>Fluorinated Linkers Enable High&#8208;Voltage Pyrrolidinium&#8208;based Dicationic Ionic Liquid Electrolytes</title>

Designed high&#8208;voltage electrolytes with stabilities of up to 7 Volt by incorporation of fluoroether linkers into pyrrolidinium&#8208;based dicationic ionic liquids.







Abstract
Novel fluorinated, pyrrolidinium&#8208;based dicationic ionic liquids (FDILs) as high&#8208;performance electrolytes in energy storage devices have been prepared, displaying unprecedented electrochemical stabilities (up to 7&#8197;V); thermal stability (up to 370&#8201;&#176;C) and ion transport (up to 1.45&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1). FDILs were designed with a fluorinated ether linker and paired with TFSI/FSI counterions. To comprehensively assess the impact of the fluorinated spacer on their electrochemical, thermal, and physico&#8208;chemical properties, a comparison with their non&#8208;fluorinated counterparts was conducted. With a specific focus on their application as electrolytes in next&#8208;generation high&#8208;voltage lithium&#8208;ion batteries, the impact of the Li&#8208;salt on the characteristics of dicationic ILs was systematically evaluated. The incorporation of a fluorinated linker demonstrates significantly superior properties compared to their non&#8208;fluorinated counterparts, presenting a promising alternative towards next&#8208;generation high&#8208;voltage energy storage systems.

         <title>Unveiling the Influence of Brightness Heterogeneity in Fluorescence Correlation Spectroscopy of Perovskite Nanocrystals</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through advanced PIE&#8208;FCS and blinking studies, we investigated the FCS behaviors of nanoparticles with single&#8208;photon purity. Our findings reveal that several FCS characteristics, such as reduced g2(0) amplitude and extended diffusion time at high pump intensity, stem from brightness heterogeneity, which is, light&#8208;induced ON/OFF blinking of individual nanoparticles.







Abstract
Nanoparticles (NPs), including perovskite nanocrystals (PNCs) with single photon purity, present challenges in fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) studies due to their distinct photoluminescence (PL) behaviors. In particular, the zero&#8208;time correlation amplitude [g2(0)] and the associated diffusion timescale (&#964;D) of their FCS curves show substantial dependency on pump intensity (IP). Optical saturation inadequately explains the origin of this FCS phenomenon in NPs, thus setting them apart from conventional dye molecules, which do not manifest such behavior. This observation is apparently attributed to either photo&#8208;brightening or optical trapping, both lead to increased NP occupancy (N) in the excitation volume, consequently reducing the g2(0) amplitude [since g2(0) &#945; 1/N] at high IP. However, an advanced FCS study utilizing alternating laser excitation at two different intensities dismisses such possibilities. Further investigation into single&#8208;particle blinking behaviors as a function of IP reveals that the intensity dependence of g2(0) primarily arises from the brightness heterogeneity prevalent in almost all types of NPs. This report delves into the complexities of the photophysical properties of NPs and their adverse impacts on FCS studies.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A unique high&#8208;valent formal Cu(III) iodide complex was prepared from tris(trifluoromethyl)copper pyridine adduct by weak Lewis base addition and fully characterized including X&#8208;ray crystallography. Pyridine adduct undergoes ligand substitution with tridentate pincer ligands to give formally octahedral Cu(III)(CF3)3 species, with high potential for applications.

         <title>Biocatalysis in Non&#8208;Conventional Media: Unlocking the Potential for Sustainable Chiral Amine Synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Replacing traditional aqueous reaction media with non&#8208;conventional solvents shows great potential for enhancing the sustainability of enzyme catalysis and addressing issues in large&#8208;scale production applications. This review highlights significant advancements in using non&#8208;conventional media, such as organic green solvents and Deep Eutectic Solvents, to produce chiral amines with high yields and enantiomeric excesses, as well as to enable chemo&#8208;enzymatic cascades.







Abstract
The application of biocatalysis has become essential in both academic and industrial domains for the asymmetric synthesis of chiral amines, and it serves as an alternative tool to transition&#8208;metal catalysis and complements traditional chemical methods. It relies on the swift expansion of available processes, primarily as a result of advanced tools for enzyme discovery, combined with high&#8208;throughput laboratory evolution techniques for optimizing biocatalysts. This concept paper explores the utilization of non&#8208;conventional media such as ether&#8208;type solvents, deep eutectic solvents, and micellar catalysis to enhance biocatalytic reactions for chiral amine synthesis. Each section focuses on the unique properties of these media, including their ability to stabilize enzymes, alter substrate solubility, and modulate enzyme selectivity. The paper aims to provide insights into how these innovative media can overcome traditional limitations, offering new avenues for sustainable and efficient chiral amine production through biocatalytic processes.

         <title>Efficient Adsorption and Elimination of Tm3+ for Enhanced Seed Germination Using Pillar[5]Arene Polymer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This paper describes the design and synthesis of a pillar[5] arene&#8208;based polymer (Pol&#8208;P[5]&#8208;BTZP) for enhancing the adsorption and recovery of rare earth elements (REE). Pol&#8208;P[5]&#8208;BTZP exhibits excellent adsorption capacity, thermal stability, and porous structure. It shows versatility in absorbing and recovering various RREs, with the potential for reuse in green agriculture.







Abstract
While rare earth elements (REEs) are essential for modern technology, their production methods raise concerns for agriculture. Researchers are now exploring ways to control and recycle REEs pollution, aiming to minimize agricultural impacts and potentially even develop methods to utilize these elements for improved crop yields. Regarding this issue, a new type of pillar[5]arene polymer (Pol&#8208;P[5]&#8208;BTZP) has been designed and synthesized by click reaction to enhance the efficiency of adsorption and recovery of rare earth metals. This polymer incorporates the unique structure of 2,6&#8208;di&#8208;1,2,3&#8208;triazolyl&#8208;pyridine. The results of various analyses revealed that Pol&#8208;P[5]&#8208;BTZP exhibits excellent thermal stability, a high specific surface area, and well&#8208;distributed networks of micropores and mesoporous structures. The adsorption capacity of Pol&#8208;P[5]&#8208;BTZP for Tm3+, a representative REE, was evaluated using the Langmuir and Freundlich isothermal adsorption models with a maximum adsorption capacity (Qmax) of 127.71&#8197;mg/g. Furthermore, the versatility of Pol&#8208;P[5]&#8208;BTZP in adsorption and recovering various REEs was tested. In addition to its adsorption capabilities, the potential of Pol&#8208;P[5]&#8208;BTZP for rare earth recovery and reuse was assessed through experiments on the impact of Tm3+ and La3+ on seed germination. These experiments demonstrated the wide&#8208;ranging applicability of Pol&#8208;P[5]&#8208;BTZP in recovering and reusing REEs for green agriculture.

         <title>DNA Hierarchical Superstructures from Micellar Units: Stiff Hydrogels and Anisotropic Nanofibers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using three different orthogonal interactions &#8211; hydrophobic effect, RNA kissing loops, DNA base pairing &#8211; we created hierarchical nanostructures from precise DNA amphiphiles. These micron&#8208;sized materials are controlled by the nanoscale structure of the self&#8208;assembled amphiphiles with sequence&#8208;dependent behavior and have found applications as self&#8208;healing hydrogels. This bottom&#8208;up approach opens new avenues towards novel DNA hybrid materials.







Abstract
Supramolecular materials have been assembled using a wide range of interactions, including the hydrophobic effect, DNA base&#8208;pairing, and hydrogen bonding. Specifically, DNA amphiphiles with a hydrophobic building block self&#8208;assemble into diverse morphologies depending on the length and composition of both blocks. Herein, we take advantage of the orthogonality of different supramolecular interactions &#8211; the hydrophobic effect, Watson&#8208;Crick&#8208;Franklin base pairing and RNA kissing loops &#8211; to create hierarchical self&#8208;assemblies with controlled morphologies on both the nanometer and the micrometer scales. Assembly through base&#8208;pairing leads to the formation of hybrid, multi&#8208;phasic hydrogels with high stiffness and self&#8208;healing properties. Assembly via hydrophobic core interactions gives anisotropic, discrete assemblies, where DNA fibers with one sequence are terminated with DNA spheres bearing different sequences. This work opens new avenues for the bottom&#8208;up construction of DNA&#8208;based materials, with promising applications in drug delivery, tissue engineering, and the creation of complex DNA structures from a minimum array of components.

         <title>Dynamic Phase Behavior of Surface&#8208;Active Fluorinated Ionic Liquid Epoxidation Catalysts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report on the synthesis of amphiphobic fluorinated surface&#8208;active ionic liquid (FSAIL) epoxidation catalysts, which show reversible temperature&#8208;controlled solubility in water. The solubility of FSAILs containing the catalytically active perrhenate&#8208; and tungstate anions was studied in both the aqueous and the substrate phase, showing a significant solubility decrease in both media compared to their non&#8208;fluorinated congeners. It was shown that both the epoxide product and the catalyst additive phenylphosphonic acid (PPA) are efficient in transferring the FSAIL catalyst into the organic phase, rendering the reaction homogeneous. The FSAILs were used as catalysts for the epoxidation of olefins using aqueous H2O2 as oxidant, showing an exceptionally high catalytic activity at mild conditions. Catalyst recycling was demonstrated over ten consecutive runs by phase separation and subsequent product distillation.</dc:description>

         <title>A Strongly Ambiphilic Ferrocene&#8208;Based Cyclic (Alkyl)(amino)carbene &#8211; Specific Decomposition to an Enamine by a 1,2&#8208;Phenyl Shift</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The recently described crystalline cyclic (alkyl)(amino)carbene with a 1,1&#8217;&#8208;ferrocenylene (fc) backbone fc(CPh2&#8211;C&#8211;NMes) (A, Mes = mesityl) is highly reactive due to its particularly pronounced ambiphilicity and is thermally not stable in solution due to an intramolecular insertion of the divalent carbon atom into a methyl C&#8211;H bond of the Mes substituent. The closely related congener fc(CPh2&#8211;C&#8211;N&#8208;p&#8208;C6H4&#8208;tBu) (1) cannot undergo such an insertion reaction. Nevertheless, 1 is too short&#8208;lived for isolation due to a rapid 1,2&#8208;shift of a phenyl group, furnishing the isomeric cyclic enamine fc[C(Ph)=C(Ph)&#8211;N&#8208;p&#8208;C6H4&#8208;tBu] (1&#8217;) in a specific decomposition process unprecedented for CAACs. Trapping of 1 was possible with carbon monoxide, elemental selenium and with [CuBr(SMe2)], respectively affording the aminoketene 1=C=O, the selenoamide 1=Se and the homoleptic CuI complex [Cu(1)2][CuBr2]. 1 is an even stronger ambiphile than A according to NMR spectroscopic data. Similar to A, 1 does not react with H2, because the experimentally observed intramolecular process is kinetically more favourable according to DFT results.</dc:description>

         <title>Manipulating the Substituent Sphere of a Bicyclic Silicon(I) Ring Compound Results in Anionic Cubane&#8208;Type Clusters and a Tetrahedral Silanide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The reaction of the bicyclic silicon(I) ring compound Si4{N(SiMe3)Mes}4 1 with strong zwitterionic character and moderate sterical demand of the amido substituents with two equivalents of KC8 was investigated. This resulted in the unexpected abstraction of two amido substituents from 1 and additionally in dimerization to a dianionic Si8 cluster compound 2 with four unsubstituted silicon atoms and two [K([18]crown&#8208;6)]+ counter cations. Performing this reaction in the absence of [18]crown&#8208;6 results in release of only one amido substituent from 1 and dimerization to a dianionic Si8 cluster compound 3 with only two unsubstituted silicon atoms. This reaction with KC8 was repeated and trapping agents such as SiMe3Cl and tBuCl were added in&#8208;situ whereupon the second isolated homocyclic silylene 4 and a monoanionic hydride and tBu substituted Si8 cluster 5 with one unsubstituted silicon atom were isolated. Furthermore, 1 was reacted with KOtBu which resulted in the selective abstraction of one SiMe3 group and formation of the tetrahedral silanide 6 with one imido substituent bridging an edge of the tetrahedron.</dc:description>

         <title>Secondary Sphere Lewis Acid Activated Heme Superoxo Adducts Mimic Crucial Non&#8208;Covalent Interactions in IDO/TDO Heme Dioxygenases</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Heme enzymes play a central role in a medley of reactivities within a wide variety of crucial biological systems. Their active sites are highly decorated with pivotal evolutionarily optimized non&#8208;covalent interactions that precisely choreograph their biological functionalities with specific regio&#8208;, stereo&#8208;, and chemo&#8208;selectivities. Gaining a clear comprehension of how such weak interactions within the active sites control reactivity offers powerful information to be implemented into the design of future therapeutic agents that target these heme enzymes. To shed light on such critical details pertaining to tryptophan dioxygenating heme enzymes, this study investigates the indole dioxygenation reactivities of Lewis acid&#8208;activated heme superoxo model systems, wherein an unprecedented kinetic behavior is revealed. In that, the activated heme superoxo adduct is observed to undergo indole dioxygenation with the intermediacy of a non&#8208;covalently organized precursor complex, which forms prior to the rate&#8208;limiting step of the overall reaction landscape. Spectroscopic and theoretical characterization of this precursor complex draws close parallels to the ternary complex of heme dioxygenases, which has been postulated to be of crucial importance for successful 2,3&#8208;dioxygenative cleavage of indole moieties.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>6,13&#8208;Diethynylpentacene derivatives with sterically bulky substituents (Tr*, tris(3,5&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butylphenyl)methyl groups) appended to the ethynyl moieties at the 6&#8208; and 13&#8208;positions have been synthesized, as well as derivatives with electron withdrawing fluorine groups on the eight pro&#8208;cata positions. These molecules are designed to investigate relationships between steric and electronic effects on the stability of pentacene toward endoperoxide formation via reaction with photosensitized oxygen in solution under conditions of ambient light (i.e., &#8216;laboratory&#8217; conditions). It is evident from the study that stabilization through changes to the electronic characteristics of pentacene are more effective than the incorporation of sterically bulky groups at the acetylenic termini. Selected pentacene derivatives have been made into binary, amorphous films with the fullerene derivative PCBM to investigate the stability imparted by substituents against cycloaddition reactions. Overall, the introduction of steric protection through incorporation of Tr* groups is not an efficient strategy for enhancing persistence of pentacenes. Stabilization through fluorination proves successful for extending the lifetime of the pentacene derivatives by an order of magnitude in solution. Notably, the persistence of pentacene derivatives in solution can also be enhanced through the use ethereal solvents stabilized with butylated hydroxy toluene (BHT) and/or an increased number of trialkylsilyl groups as substituents.</dc:description>

         <title>Design of an Electrochemical Cell for Continuous Wave EPR Measurements of Radical Ions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The combination of continuous wave electron paramagnetic resonance (cw&#8208;EPR) with electrochemistry is highly attractive as it allows a clean in&#8208;situ generation and the subsequent spectroscopic characterisation of radical ions, which are important intermediates in many photocatalytic cycles as well as light&#8208;induced processes occurring in biological systems or optoelectronic devices. Although commercial setups for spectroelectrochemical EPR are available, they are often expensive and tailored to a particular spectroscopic setup.&#160;
Here we present a design for a low&#8208;cost electrochemical EPR cell that can be used in combination with any commercial cw&#8208;EPR instrumentation. The cell design is compared to existing setups and the performance of the cell is evaluated by comparison of EPR spectra obtained by chemical and electrochemical oxidation of a graphene fragment.</dc:description>

         <title>Investigation of Neighboring Group Participation in 3,4&#8208;Diacetylated Glycosyl Donors in the Gas Phase</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A key challenge in oligosaccharide synthesis is the stereoselective installation of glycosidic bonds. Each glycosidic linkage has one of two possible stereo&#8208;chemical geometries, &#945;/&#946; or 1,2&#8208;cis/trans. An established approach to install 1,2&#8208;trans glycosidic bonds is neighboring group participation (NGP), mediated by a 2&#8208;O&#8208;acyl group. Extension of this intramolecular stabilization to nucleophilic groups located at more remote positions has also been suggested, but remains poorly understood. Previously, we employed infrared ion spectroscopy to characterize the molecular ions of monoacetylated sugar donors and showed how the strength of the stabilizing effect depends on the position of the participating ester group on the glycosyl donor ring as well as on its relative stereochemistry. In this work, we investigated glycosyl donors carrying two acyl groups. Using isotope labelling and isomer population analysis we were able to resolving spectra of isomeric mixtures and establish the relative contribution of individual species. We conclude that 3,4&#8208;diacetyl mannosyl donors exclusively form a dioxanium ion as a result of C&#8208;3 acyl stabilization. In contrast, the glucosyl and galactosyl cations form mixtures of C&#8208;3 and C&#8208;4 acyl participation products. Hence, the combination of isotope labeling and population analysis allows for the study of increasingly complex glycosyl cations.</dc:description>

In contrast, the glucosyl and galactosyl cations form mixtures of C-3 and C-4 acyl participation products.

         <title>Adjusting the Number of Functional Groups in Vicinal Bis(trichlorosilylated) Benzenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organo(chloro)silanes are essential chemicals, but the synthesis of compounds of the formula RnSiCl4&#8210;n with defined values of n is usually laborious. Herein, we first disclose that a [4+2]&#8208;cycloaddition between readily available Cl3SiC&#8801;CSiCl3 and selected dienes provides facile access to vicinal bis(trichlorosilylated) benzenes and bicyclo[2.2.2]octa&#8208;2,5&#8208;dienes. Second, we show how the number of six Si&#8210;Cl bonds in 1,2&#8208;(Cl3Si)2C6H2Me2 (1) can be selectively reduced to four or two by reaction with pinacol (H2pin) or catechol (H2cat), which act as Si&#183;&#183;&#183;Si&#8217;&#8208;bridging and/or Si&#8208;chelating ligands. Third, we demonstrate that the thermolysis of compound 6, which contains a benzannulated eight&#8208;membered C2(SiCl2)2(&#956;&#8208;pin) ring with Si&#183;&#183;&#183;Si&#8217;&#8208;bridging pin moiety, furnishes 13 with a benzannulated five&#8208;membered C2(SiCl2)2O ring via the release of pinacolone. Such cyclic disiloxanes are valuable building blocks for specialty silicones; an alternative assembly of the Si&#8210;O&#8210;Si unit by controlled hydrolysis of 1 is not feasible if the four valuable Si&#8210;Cl functionalities are to be retained for further derivatization. Substitution of one Cl atom per Si site of 13 gives the rac&#8208;1,3&#8208;disila&#8208;2&#8208;oxaindane rac&#8208;15 with high selectivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Differential Sensing Approach as a Pattern&#8208;based Discrimination for Biological Samples</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The differential sensing approach uses fingerprint patterning to distinguish uncharacterized biological samples. Inspired by natural sensory systems, an array of cross&#8208;reactive sensors generates unique response fingerprint depending on the samples. Until today, this array system has been developed using various materials, including the library of surface&#8208;charged nanoparticles and chemosensors. Many differential array systems have demonstrated accurate identification of bacterial species, viral subtypes, and cancer cells, as well as distinguishing disease states in blood or urine. This capability is particularly important for distinguishing between normal and abnormal states when specific marker molecules have not yet been identified, providing a powerful diagnostic tool. In this concept, we summarized representative outcomes of differential sensing applications for biological sample discrimination.</dc:description>

         <title>Deciphering the cell surface sugar&#8208;coating via Biochemical Pathways</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cell surface components, specifically glycans, play a significant role in several biological functions like cell structure, crosstalk between cells, and eventual target recognition of the cells for therapeutics. The dense layer of glycans, i.e., glycocalyx, could differ in taxon, species, and cell type. Glycans are coupled with lipids and proteins to form glycolipids, glycoproteins, proteoglycans, and glycosylphosphatidylinositol&#8208;anchored proteins, making their study challenging. However, understanding glycosylation at the cellular level is vital for fundamental research and the advancement of glycan&#8208;targeted therapy. Among different pathways, metabolic glycan labelling uses the natural metabolic processes of the cell to introduce abiotic functionality into glycan residues. The Bertozzi group pioneered metabolic oligosaccharide engineering using glycan salvage pathways to convert monosaccharides with unnatural modifications. This eventually results in the probe becoming part of the complex cellular glycan structures via click chemistry using copper. On the other hand, the boronic acid&#8208;based probe can recognise carbohydrates in a single step without any chemical modification of the surface. This review discusses the significance of glycans as biomarkers for different diseases and the necessity to evaluate them in situ within the physiological environment. The review also discusses the prospect of this field and its potential applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Formate Salt as a Bifunctional Reagent for Hydroxylation and Carbonylation Reactions Under Photochemically Driven Nickel Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this study, we disclose for the first time that formate salt can be used as a bifunctional reagent for the synthesis of phenol derivatives and as a CO source for carbonylative cross&#8208;coupling processes using the COware gas reactor under activation free conditions. Key to this success is the in&#8208;situ synthesis of aryl formate via an unprecedented nickel/organophotocatalyst system under blue LED irradiation. This developed system demonstrated high applicability to various aryl iodide substrates for synthesizing phenol derivatives. Moreover, the generated CO could be utilized in a range of carbonylative C&#8208;heteroatom and C&#8208;C processes. Notably, commercially available H13COONa salt can serve as a bifunctional reagent for both synthesizing phenols and generating 13CO.</dc:description>

         <title>Conformation Regulation of Trisresorcinarene Directed by Cavity Solvation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This compound is a synthetic macrocycle comprising three pivaloyl&#8208;protected resorcinarene units connected by six pentylene chains. We conducted a conformational study using 1H&#8208;NMR, X&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD), and computational analyses. The macrocycle adopts two conformers, one open, the other closed. The ratio of the open to closed forms depended on the solvent used. Only the open form existed in [D8]toluene, both forms coexisted in [D6]benzene, and the closed form was the major conformer in [D1]chloroform. The benzene&#8208;solvated open form observed in the solid state suggests that cavity solvation by solvent molecules directs the open form. The open form was the major or only conformer in [D10]o&#8208; and [D10]m&#8208;xylene and [D12]mesitylene, whereas the closed form was the major conformer in [D6]acetone. The open and closed forms were equally populated in [D10]p&#8208;xylene, suggesting that the size, shape, and dimensions of the solvent molecules most likely influenced the conformation of the protected trisresocinarene.</dc:description>

The addition reaction of &#945;&#8208;hydroxyphosphonates, derived from alkyl aryl&#8208; and diaryl ketones, with electrophiles such as phenyl vinyl sulfone, afforded phosphates having a tertiary alkyl group, which were readily convertible to the corresponding tertiary benzylic alcohols. This operationally simple protocol provides efficient complementary access to tertiary alcohols that are difficult to synthesize by conventional methods.</dc:description>

         <title>Access to diverse carbonyl compounds by catalyst&#8208;free and photoinduced aerobic cleavage of C=N bonds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Functional group interconversion is of great significance in organic synthesis. However, aerobic cleavage of C=N bonds to access carbonyl compounds still suffered from some limitations such as harsh reaction conditions, stoichiometric oxidants, poor substrate scope and use of toxic reagents. Herein, we report a catalyst&#8208;free and photo&#8208;induced aerobic cleavage of C=N bonds to afford diverse carbonyl compounds using oxygen from air as green oxidant. This mild methodology permits N&#8208;tosylhydrazones converted into the corresponding carbonyl compounds including ketones, amides, aldehydes and carboxylic acids, showing broad functional group tolerance and compatibility. Moreover, the gram&#8208;scale reaction and post&#8208;modification of complicated molecules proved the applicability and efficiency of this strategy. Finally, a plausible mechanism was proposed based on spectroscopic investigations and detailed mechanistic studies.</dc:description>

         <title>Ferrocenyl Dithiophosphonate Ag(I) Complexes: Synthesis, Structures, Luminescence, and Electrocatalytic Water Splitting Tuned by Nuclearity and Ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The heterometallic [Ag(I)/Fe(II)] molecular electrocatalysts for hydrogen production were introduced here to recognize the mutual role of metallic nuclearity and ligand engineering. A series of ferrocenyl dithiophosphonate stabilized mononuclear [Ag(PPh3)2{S2PFc(OR)}] {where R = Me (1), Et (2), nPr (3), iPr (4), iAmyl (5); Fc = Fe (&#627;5&#8208;C5H4)(&#627;5&#8208;C5H5) } and dinuclear [Ag(PPh3){S2PFc(OR}]2 {where R = Et (2a), and nPr (3a)} complexes were synthesized and characterized by SCXRD, NMR (31P and 1H), ESI&#8208;MS, UV&#8208;Vis, and FT&#8208;IR spectroscopy. The comparative electrocatalytic HER behavior of 1&#8722;5 and 2a&#8722;3a showed effective current density of 1 mA/cm2 with overpotentials ranging from 772 to 991 mV, demonstrating the influence of extended and branched carbon chains in dithiophosphonates and metallic (mono&#8208;/di&#8208;) nuclearity, which correlates with documented tetra&#8208;nuclear [Ag4(S2PFc(OnPr)4], 6. DFT study suggests the coordinated (&#956;1&#8208;S) site of ligands is the reactivity center and the adsorption energy of intermediate [H*&#8208;SM] varies with the engineering of ligand and nuclearity. A catalytic mechanism using mononuclear (1) and di&#8208;nuclear (2a) was proposed with the assistance of DFT. Each complex, being the first example of Ag(I) dithiophosphonates, exhibits intense photoluminescence with high quantum yields ranging from 33% to 67%. These results link the lower nuclearity structures to their physical and catalytic properties.</dc:description>

         <title>Fluorescence of Aggregated Aromatic Peptides for Studying the Kinetics of Aggregation and Hardening of Amyloid&#8208;like Structures</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The intrinsic fluorescence anisotropy of peptide based amyloid&#8208;like structures gives clues about kinetics of aggregation and hardening of these supramolecular architectures.







Abstract
The capability of amyloid&#8208;like peptide fibers to emit intrinsic&#8208;fluorescence enables the study of their formation, stability and hardening through time&#8208;resolved fluorescence analysis, without the need for additional intercalating dyes. This approach allows the monitoring of amyloid&#8208;like peptides aggregation kinetics using minimal sample volumes, and the simultaneous testing of numerous experimental conditions and analytes, offering rapid and reproducible results. The analytical procedure applied to the aromatic hexapeptide F6, alone or derivatized with PEG (polyethylene glycol) moiety of different lengths, suggests that aggregation into large anisotropic structures negatively correlates with initial monomer concentration and relies on the presence of charged N&#8208; and C&#8208;termini. PEGylation reduces the extent of aggregates hardening, possibly by retaining water, and overall impacts the final structural properties of the aggregates.

         <title>Fluorogenic in&#8208;situ Labelling of Gelatin Polymer in Aqueous Solution and Hydrogel</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A practical fluorogenic gelatin labelling was achieved directly in the aqueous phase using water&#8208;soluble tetraphenylethylene fluorophores via multivalent tetrazolate&#8208;amine electrostatic interactions during macromolecular encapsulation. This strategy allowed the construction of fluorescence&#8208;responsive hydrogel biomaterials exhibiting dynamic behaviors upon salting&#8208;in/out treatments, and enabled high spatio&#8208;temporal imaging of the hydrogel network for biomedical applications.







Abstract
Gelatin polymers made from partially degraded collagen are important biomaterials, but their in&#8208;situ analysis suffers from uncontrollable covalent labelling and poor spatial&#8208;temporal imaging resolution. Herein, three tetrazolate&#8208;tagged tetraphenylethylene fluorophores (TPE&#8722;TAs) are introduced for practical fluorogenic labelling of gelatin in aqueous phase and hydrogels. These probes with aggregation&#8208;induced emission characteristics offer negligible background and elicit turn&#8208;on fluorescence by simply mixing with the gelatin in aqueous phase, giving a detection limit of 0.15&#8197;mg/L over a linear dynamic range up to 100&#8197;mg/L. This method does not work for collagens and causes minimal interference with gelatin properties. Mechanistic studies reveal a key role for multivalent electrostatic interactions between the abundant basic residues in gelatin (e.&#8201;g., lysine, hydroxylysine, arginine) and anionic tetrazolate moieties of the lipophilic fluorophore synergistically in spatially rigid macromolecular encapsulation to achieve fluorogenic labelling. The AIE strategy by forming non&#8208;covalent fluorophore&#8208;gelatin complexes was developed for novel hydrogels that exhibited reversible fluorescence in response to dynamic microstructural changes in the hydrogel scaffold upon salting&#8208;in/out treatments, and enabled high spatial&#8208;temporal imaging of the fiber network in lyophilized samples. This work may open up avenues for in&#8208;situ imaging analysis and evaluation of gelatin&#8208;based biomaterials during processes such as in&#8197;vivo degradation and mineralization.

         <title>Uncatalyzed Diboron Activation by a Strained Hydrocarbon: Experimental and Theoretical Study of [1.1.1]Propellane Diborylation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This report reveals that a special apolar hydrocarbon can activate a boron&#8208;boron bond to produce its electrophilic diborylation. Interestingly, this unique reaction occurs with surprising ease within minutes at room temperature, and its detailed mechanistic study has revealed several disruptive features in the context of both propellane and diboron chemistries.







Abstract
The synthesis of strained carbocyclic building blocks is relevant for Medicinal Chemistry, and methylenecyclobutanes are particularly challenging with current synthetic technology. Careful inspection of the reactivity of [1.1.1]propellane and diboron reagents has revealed that bis(catecholato)diboron (B2cat2) can produce a bis(borylated) methylenecyclobutane in a few minutes at room temperature. This reaction constitutes the first example of B&#8722;B bond activation by a special apolar hydrocarbon and also the first time that propellane is electrophilically activated by boron. Mechanistic studies including in&#8197;situ NMR kinetics and DFT calculations demonstrate that the diboron moiety can be directly activated through coordination with the inverted sigma bond of propellane, and reveal that DMF is involved in the stabilization of diboronate ylide intermediates rather than the activation of the B&#8722;B bond. These results enable new possibilities for both diboron and propellane chemistry, and for further developments in the synthesis of methylenecyclobutanes based on propellane strain release.

     alt="Uncatalyzed Diboron Activation by a Strained Hydrocarbon: Experimental and Theoretical Study of [1.1.1]Propellane Diborylation"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This report reveals that a special apolar hydrocarbon can activate a boron-boron bond to produce its electrophilic diborylation. Interestingly, this unique reaction occurs with surprising ease within minutes at room temperature, and its detailed mechanistic study has revealed several disruptive features in the context of both propellane and diboron chemistries.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The synthesis of strained carbocyclic building blocks is relevant for Medicinal Chemistry, and methylenecyclobutanes are particularly challenging with current synthetic technology. Careful inspection of the reactivity of [1.1.1]propellane and diboron reagents has revealed that bis(catecholato)diboron (B&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;cat&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) can produce a bis(borylated) methylenecyclobutane in a few minutes at room temperature. This reaction constitutes the first example of B&#8722;B bond activation by a special apolar hydrocarbon and also the first time that propellane is electrophilically activated by boron. Mechanistic studies including &lt;i&gt;in&#8197;situ&lt;/i&gt; NMR kinetics and DFT calculations demonstrate that the diboron moiety can be directly activated through coordination with the inverted sigma bond of propellane, and reveal that DMF is involved in the stabilization of diboronate ylide intermediates rather than the activation of the B&#8722;B bond. These results enable new possibilities for both diboron and propellane chemistry, and for further developments in the synthesis of methylenecyclobutanes based on propellane strain release.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Peripheral Fusion of Carbon&#8208;based Aromatic Rings to B4N4&#8208;Heteropentalene Leading to Close &#960;&#8208;Stacking in the Solid State</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>&#960;&#8208;Electronic molecules with a BN&#8208;heterocyclic and carbon&#8208;based aromatic hybrid ring system (h&#8208;CBN) are interesting in that they potentially exhibit synergistic properties arising from the two different &#960;&#8208;systems. Here we report the synthesis and properties of a h&#8208;CBN&#8208;type molecule (1) having a bicyclic B4N4&#8208;heteropentalene core fused with extended aromatic rings. This molecule exhibits excellent chemical stability despite the absence of bulky substituents for kinetic protection, which in turn provides effective stacking of the &#960;&#8208;system upon crystallization. Depending on the crystallization solvent, 1 forms two polymorphs, i.e., the &#945;&#8208; and &#946;&#8208;phases. While both phases have one&#8208;dimensional columnar structures, the &#960;&#8208;stacking geometries associated with the transfer integrals of the frontier orbitals are different, resulting in a twofold difference in the electrical conducting properties. We also found that upon thermal vacuum deposition, 1 gives an amorphous film, which serves as a host material for a red phosphorescent OLED device (maximum external quantum efficiency: 15.5 and 13.3% at 0.1 and 2.5 mA, respectively).</dc:description>

         <title>Complexes of a Frustrated Lewis Pair&#8208;Supported P(&#8211;1) Ligand</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Several complexes of the intramolecular frustrated Lewis pair (FLP)&#8208;supported P(&#8211;1) ligand [iPr2P(C6H4)BCy2{P}]&#8211; are presented (Cy = cyclohexyl). Chief among these is the first example of a monomeric zinc bis(phosphido) complex, which was synthesized as a potential precursor for the solution&#8208;phase deposition of Zn3P2. While this goal was ultimately unsuccessful, the Zn(II) complex acts as a convenient springboard to other metal phosphide species via transmetallation: namely, a tellurium bis(phosphido) and a formal adduct of the phosphorus subhalide PPCl2. Trapping experiments show that the PPCl2 adduct can also be prepared directly through the in situ reduction of PCl3 in the presence of an intramolecular FLP ligand. Lastly, we report a formal &#951;2&#8208;phosphaborene complex of cobalt(&#8208;1) which is isoelectronic to olefin complexes, and explore its bonding via density functional theory (DFT) computations.</dc:description>

         <title>Research Progress on Ni&#8208;based Electrocatalysts for Electrochemical Reduction of Nitrogen to Ammonia</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The electrochemical NRR&#160;to synthesize ammonia&#160;is considered as a promising method due to its approvable advantages of zero&#8208;pollution emission, feasible reaction proceedings, good safety and easy management. The multiple efforts have been devoted to the exploration of earth&#8208;abundant&#8208;element&#8208;based nanomaterials as high&#8208;efficiency electrocatalysts for realizing their industrial applications. Among these, the Ni&#8208;based nanomaterials is prioritized as an attractive non&#8208;noble&#8208;metal electrocatalysts for catalyzing NRR because they are earth&#8208;abundance and exceedingly easy to synthesize as well as also delivers the potential of high electrocatalytic activity and durability. In this review, after briefly elucidating the underlying mechanisms of NRR during the electrochemical process, we systematically sum up the recent research progress in representative Ni&#8208;based electrocatalysts, including monometallic Ni&#8208;based nanomaterials, bimetallic Ni&#8208;based nanomaterials, polymetallic Ni&#8208;based nanomaterials, etc. In particular, we discuss the effects of physicochemical properties, such as phases, crystallinity, morphology, composition, defects, heteroatom doping, and strain engineering, on the comprehensive performance of the abovementioned electrocatalysts, with the aim of establishing the nanostructure&#8208;function relationships of the electrocatalysts. In addition, the promising directions of Ni&#8208;based electrocatalysts for NRR are also pointed out and highlighted. The generic approach in this review may expand the frontiers of NRR and provides the inspiration for developing high&#8208;efficiently Ni&#8208;based electrocatalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>&#945;&#8208;Bi2Mo3O12: A Dual&#8208;Functional material for electrocatalytic water splitting and supercapacitor applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This study explores the functionality of &#945;&#8208;Bi2Mo3O12 (BMO) as an electrocatalyst for water splitting and its suitability for supercapacitor applications. BMO was synthesized by the solvothermal method and characterized in pre&#8208;calcination [BMO (BC)], post&#8208;calcination [BMO (AC)], and base&#8208;etched forms [BMO (BE)]. Structural analysis confirmed the formation of &#945;&#8208;Bi2Mo3O12 with well&#8208;defined crystallographic planes. Electrochemical analysis revealed that BMO (AC) exhibited the lowest overpotential for hydrogen evolution reactions (HER) and BMO (BC) exhibited the lowest overpotential for oxygen evolution reactions (OER), indicating its superior electrocatalytic activity. The Tafel slope and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy results confirmed the superior kinetics and charge transfer properties of BMO material. Furthermore, BMO samples demonstrated excellent stability during prolonged chronoamperometry (CA) testing for 12 h. For supercapacitor performances, the BMO (BE) exhibits a superior specific capacitance value of 398 F/g at 2.0 A/g. Thus, the BMO material delivers prominent electrocatalytic activity as well as supercapacitor performance. Overall, this study demonstrates the potentiality of &#945;&#8208;Bi2Mo3O12 in different forms as a dual&#8208;functional material for efficient energy storage and conversion.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Electron spin qubits are becoming an important research direction in the field of quantum computing and information storage. However, the quantum decoherence has seriously hindered the development of this field. So far, few qubits exhibit long phase memory time (Tm), and even fewer qubits that can reach room temperature. Some reports show that the coherence times of radicals are generally long, so radicals may be the preferred spin carriers for qubits. Here, we demonstrate the qubit properties of a photogenerated radical (1a) based on 2,4,6&#8208;Tri(4&#8208;pyridyl)&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triazine (tpt, 1). More importantly, the photogenerated radical is a spin self&#8208;diluting complex, which the dilution is generally used in the investigation of qubits to reduce the interference of environment on qubits in order to overcome the decoherence of qubits. It is surprised that radical tpt has a stable Tm = 1.1 &#956;s above 20 K, even keep it to room temperature. In addition, the tpt&#8208;film prepared by the vacuum evaporation is significantly increase the T1 and Tm at low temperature.</dc:description>

         <title>Discrete Macrocyclic Polymers Hosts Induced Cascade Luminescence Enhancement and Application in Bioimaging</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The integration of polymers, supramolecular macrocycles and aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) molecules provides numerous possibilities for constructing various functional supramolecular systems.

         <title>Reduced Surface Area for the Oxygen Reduction Reaction in Porous Electrode via Electrical Conductivity Relaxation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) performance of porous electrode is critical for solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs). However, the effects of gas diffusion on the ORR in porous media need further investigation, although some issues, such as nonthermal surface oxygen exchange, have been attributed to gas diffusion. Herein, La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3&#8208;&#948; (LSCF) with various porosity, pore radii and gas permeability were investigated via the electrical conductivity relaxation method and analysed using the distributed of characteristic time (DCT) model. The ORR is revealed with three characteristic times, which are gas diffusion, oxygen exchange via the surface corresponding to small pores, and oxygen exchange to large pores. Gas diffusion delays the oxygen surface exchange reaction, resulting in very low chemical oxygen surface exchange coefficient compared with that obtained with dense sample under the assumption that all the surfaces are active for the ORR. Reduced surface area is thus defined to quantitatively represent the gas diffusion effects. The reduced surface area increases with increasing gas permeability, demonstrating the importance of electrode engineering for fast gas transport. Moreover, reduced surface area is suggested for replacing the specific surface area to calculate the electrode polarization resistance using the ALS model.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The synthetic methodology for the preparation of photoresponsive dioxazaborocanes&#8208;containing oligomers is developed. It relies on the transformation of the (diisopropylamino)boryl group (&#8208;BH(NiPr2)) into a dioxazaborocane unit in the presence &#946;&#8208;aminodiols and involves a bis&#8208;borylated dithienylethene photochromic unit.

         <title>Amplifying reactivity of bio&#8208;inspired [FeFe]&#8208;hydrogenase mimics by organic nanotubes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A bio&#8208;inspired FeFe hydrogenase model which catalyses hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in acidic solutions is immobilized in polyaniline (PANI)&#8208;based nanotubes. A combination of analytical techniques reveals that this construct maintains both the molecular signatures of the bio&#8208;inspired complex and the material properties of PANI. The amine and imine&#8208;rich environment of the PANI chain amplifies the inherent HER activity of the bio&#8208;inspired complex, allowing electrocatalytic HER at neutral pH, with lower overpotentials and higher current densities compared to the bio&#8208;inspired complex alone. This construct retains the oxygen stability of the bio&#8208;inspired complex and remains stable through several hours of aerobic electrolysis, producing only 6.5% H2O2 from the competing oxygen reduction reaction (ORR).</dc:description>

         <title>Aerobic Oxidation of PMB Ethers to Carboxylic Acids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
With Fe(NO3)3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;9H2O and TEMPO as cocatalysts and oxygen as green oxidant, PMB ethers have been converted to carboxylic acids at room temperature with high efficiency and selectivity. Total synthesis of naturally occuring (R)&#8208;6&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;7,9&#8208;octadecadiynoic acid has been realized by applying this protocol as key step. A mechanism involving oxygen&#8208;stabilized benzylic cation has been proposed based on careful studies.







Abstract
The first aerobic protocol of direct transformation of p&#8208;methoxybenzyl (PMB) ethers to carboxylic acids efficiently with Fe(NO3)3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;9H2O and TEMPO as catalysts at room temperature has been developed. The reaction accommodates C&#8722;Br bond, terminal/non&#8208;terminal C&#8722;C triple bond, amide, cyano, nitro, ester, and trifluoromethyl groups. Even highly selective oxidative deprotection of different benzylic PMB ethers has been realized. The reaction has been successfully applied to the total synthesis of natural product, (R)&#8208;6&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;7,9&#8208;octadecadiynoic acid, demonstrating the practicality of the method. Based on experimental studies, a possible mechanism involving oxygen&#8208;stabilized benzylic cation has been proposed.

         <title>Pd/C Catalyzed Selective N&#8208;monomethylation by Transfer Hydrogenation of Urea derivatives using Methanol as H2 and C1 Sources</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>N&#8208;monomethyl amines are useful intermediates in drugs, natural products, paints. Yet their synthesis is a tremendous challenge due to their high reactivity, typically leading to overmethylation. In this contribution, a highly selective catalytic N&#8208;methylation methodology is reported, converting urea derivatives to monomethylated amines, using a commercially available heterogeneous Pd/C catalyst and methanol as unique reagent. Methanol provides a sustainable alternative protocol for the selective preparation of mono&#8208;methylated derivatives as it acts as both H2 and C1 sources. In addition, several control experiments were performed to provide a proposal for the mechanism, namely dehydrogenation of methanol and subsequent hydrogenation of urea derivatives, followed by reduction of the in situ formed methyl imine. Importantly, the approach is simple, highly productive and enables novel synthetic procedures for the preparation of monomethylamines from urea derivatives.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis, Reactivity, and Bonding Analysis of a Tetracoordinated Nickel Carbene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nickel carbenes are key reactive intermediates in the catalytic cyclopropanation of olefins and other reactions, but isolated examples are scarce and generally rely on low coordination numbers (&#8804; 3) to stabilize the metal&#8211;ligand multiple bond. Here we report the isolation and characterization of a stable tetracoordinated nickel carbene bearing a triphosphine pincer ligand. Its nucleophilic character is evidenced by reaction with acids, and it can transfer the carbene fragment to CO to form a ketene. A computational study of the Ni=C chemical bond sheds light on the role of the third phosphine in the pincer framework to the stabilization of the nickel carbene fragment.</dc:description>

         <title>The possible aromatic conjugation via the different edges of (car)borane clusters &#8722; Can the relationship between 3D and 2D aromatic systems be reconciled?</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The possible aromatic conjugation between 3D and 2D aromatic units is in the focus since the synthesis of benzocarborane. It has been showed that in the 3D aromatic icosahedral 1,2&#8208;dicarba&#8208;closo&#8208;dodecaborane systems fused with 2D aromatic rings a global 3D/2D aromaticity does not exist. Despite this fact during the last years several studies propose interactions between 2D and 3D moieties. Herein, while tuning the size and the effective charge of the (car)borane systems, we demonstrate that global aromatic character can be excluded in any investigated cases, and the detectable conjugative properties can be explained the effect of the well&#8208;known negative hyperconjugation.</dc:description>

         <title>Ultrasonication&#8208;Boosted Resorcinol&#8208;Formaldehyde Resin Nanoparticle Bromine Fixation and Corresponding Upgraded Aquatic Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Bromine (Br2) and related species removal from water systems are rather complicated due to the complicated chemistry instability, and materials with high Br2 removal rate and efficiency, along with stimuli/apparatus suitable for highly corrosive environments, are necessary. Ultrasonication as a non&#8208;destructive process is especially suitable in scenarios where conventional stir apparatus is not applicable, such as highly corrosive environments. Considering the validity nature of Br2 and combining the advantages of ultrasonic with a highly stable Br2 fixation method through aromatic polymer nanoparticles, we demonstrate highly efficient acoustic&#8208;aided Br2 removal in aqueous solutions with two times capacity compared to the non&#8208;treated sample. Related aquatic applications are also proposed for the materials to be cost&#8208;effective, including silver (Ag) recovery, recyclable MnO2&#8208;mediated Br2 deep removal, and aqueous zinc anode modification. The coupled novel&#8208;material&#8208;based processes motivate the strategic design of water purification with high&#8208;safety and sustainable industrial procedures and post&#8208;value&#8208;added utilizations.</dc:description>

         <title>Two&#8208;Coordinate Dinuclear Donor&#8208;Gold(I)&#8208;Acceptor Complexes Exhibiting Multiple Excitation Wavelength Dependent Phosphorescence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two&#8208;coordinate Au(I) complexes with a donor&#8208;metal&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;M&#8208;A) structure have shown rich luminescent properties. However, charge&#8208;neutral dinuclear donor&#8208;metal&#8208;acceptor type Au(I) complexes featuring aurophilic interactions have been seldom explored. Herein, we describe the structures and photoluminescence properties of two dinuclear Au(I) complexes, namely DiAu&#8208;Ph and DiAu&#8208;Me. Single crystal X&#8208;ray structural analysis of DiAu&#8208;Ph reveals a short intramolecular Au&#8208;Au distance of 3.224 &#197;. In dilute solution and doped films, excitation wavelength dependent multiple phosphorescence phenomena were observed for these dinuclear complexes. Theoretical calculations reveal that the aurophilic interaction causes increased contribution of the Au d orbital to the highest occupied molecular orbitals. Thus, the gap between singlet and triplet excited states (&#916;EST) is enlarged, which disables the thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF). Moreover, the large energy separation (0.45&#8208;0.52 eV) and the different orbital configurations between the various excited states result in an inefficient internal conversion, accounting for their multiple phosphorescence properties.</dc:description>

         <title>Janus Reactivity of Crownphyrinoids: Alkali&#8208; vs. Transition Metal&#8208;Mediated Transformations of Crown Ether&#8208;Porphyrin Hybrids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Crownphyrinogens and crownphyrins constitute a group of macrocycles that combine the structural facets of porphyrinoids and crown ethers. The dual&#8208;nature cavity embedded in their molecules enables reactivity involving two structurally distinct parts of the macrocyclic ligand. Upon Ni(II) and Pd(II) insertion, coordination compounds are produced wherein the metal is incorporated into the porphyrinoid&#8208;like pocket, resulting in monomeric or accordion&#8208;like dimeric products, depending on the oxidation level of the macrocycle and metal cation. The reactions with Na(I) and K(I) resulted in the formation of complexes where only the crown ether segment of the molecule is involved in metal binding, yielding remarkable dimeric species. The exploitation of a crownphyrin large enough to accommodate two metal cations allowed the synthesis of an alkali/transition metal binuclear complexes wherein the macrocycle demonstrated the Janus reactivity with one cavity acting as a porphyrinoid, and the other mimicking the crown ether.</dc:description>

         <title>Photomediated Hexafluoroisopropoxylation of Unactivated Aryl Halides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The use of fluoroalkoxy groups, such as trifluoromethoxy and 2,2,2&#8208;trifluoroethoxy groups, in pharmaceutical and agrochemical development has increased dramatically in recent years. However, hexafluoroisopropoxy groups have remained significantly underrepresented, presumably due to limited synthetic methods for accessing this substituent in good yields. Herein, we report a mild, photochemical nucleophilic aromatic substitution (SNAr) approach for the synthesis of hexafluoroisopropyl aryl ethers from unactivated and abundant aryl halides. Notably, aryl chloride and bromide functionality are efficiently engaged by this methodology in addition to the traditional aryl fluoride nucleofuge. This method provided access to a diverse array of hexafluoroisopropyl aryl ethers, including multiple examples of late&#8208;stage functionalization of active pharmaceutical ingredients. A simple flow system was adapted for 10x scale&#8208;up, maintaining good yield for the reaction. Initial mechanistic studies indicate single electron oxidation of the arene as a key step in product formation.</dc:description>

         <title>Achieving Regioselectivity for Remote C&#8211;H Activation by Substructure Conformations: an Approach of Paralogous Cytochrome P450 Enzymes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>For advanced synthetic intermediates or natural products with multiple unactivated and energetically similar C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds, controlling regioselectivity for the C&#8208;H activation is particularly challenging. The use of cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYPs) is a promising solution to the &#8216;regioelectivity&#8217; challenge in remote C&#8211;H activation. Notably, CYPs and organic catalysts share a fundamental principle: they strive to control the distance and geometry between the metal reaction center and the target C&#8208;H site. Most structural analyses of the regioselectivity of CYPs are limited to the active pocket, particularly when explaining why regioselectivity could be altered by enzyme engineering through mutagenesis. However, the substructures responsible for forming the active pocket in CYPs are well known to display complex dynamic changes and substrate&#8208;induced plasticity. In this context, we highlight a comparative study of the recently reported paralogous CYPs, IkaD and CftA, which achieve different regioselectivity towards the same substrate ikarugamycin by distinct substructure conformations. We propose that substructural conformation&#8208;controlled regioselectivity might also be present in CYPs of other natural product biosynthesis pathways, which should be considered when engineering CYPs for regioselective modifications.</dc:description>

         <title>N&#8208;Heteroocyclic Carbenes and N&#8208;Heterocycles as Synthetic Reagents and Building Blocks</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>N&#8208;Heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) have become important tools in modern synthetic chemistry due to their versatility as organocatalysts and ligands in organometallic complexes. Since their first isolation and characterization, NHCs have demonstrated significant utility in various catalytic processes, offering advantages such as strong &#963;&#8208;electron donation and the ability to stabilize reactive intermediates. However, beyond their well&#8208;documented roles in catalysis, the potential of NHCs as stoichiometric reagents and synthetic building blocks remains an underexplored yet promising area. This Mini&#8208;review aims to shed light on these lesser&#8208;known applications of NHCs and their N&#8208;heterocyclic precursors or derivatives in organic synthesis. Furthermore, we discuss how the unique electronic and steric properties of NHCs can be harnessed to develop new synthetic methodologies or construct interesting organic frameworks. By highlighting these emerging uses, we hope to encourage further research into the non&#8208;catalytic applications of NHCs, broadening their scope and impact in synthetic chemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>Introduction of Molecular Complexity via the Cross&#8208;Coupling of Lithium 1,4&#8208;Dioxene with Aryl Bromides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthetic potential of substituted 1,4&#8208;dioxenes is well recognised, although the chemistry of 2&#8208;aryl&#8208;1,4&#8208;dioxenes is relatively unexplored. Their transition metal&#8208;catalysed synthesis has been limited to Stille&#8208;type cross&#8208;coupling chemistry, typically showing long reaction times, or proceeding at high reaction temperatures. Here we present a facile and general methodology for the cross&#8208;coupling of aryl bromides with lithium 1,4&#8208;dioxene, affording a range of 2&#8208;aryl&#8208;1,4&#8208;dioxenes in generally good yields. We highlight the synthetic applicability of this transformation at multigram scale, and demonstrate the versatility of the products by conversion of the dioxene units to various carbonyl&#8208;based functionalities. Additionally, we present a concise two&#8208;step synthesis of an arylated analogue to a known 1,4&#8208;dioxene&#8208;based antifungal agent.</dc:description>

         <title>Hydroflux Synthesis and Structural Phase Transition of Rare&#8208;Earth Borate Hydroxides Na2[RE(BO3)(OH)2] (RE = Y, Gd&#8211;Er)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Reacting RE2O3 and H3BO3 in an ultra&#8208;alkaline NaOH hydroflux at about 250 &#176;C yielded pure, crystalline samples of Na2[RE(BO3)(OH)2] (RE = Y, Gd&#8211;Er). The compounds dehydrate to Na3RE(BO3)2 upon heating in air to about 500 &#176;C. Na2[RE(BO3)(OH)2] (RE = Tb&#8211;Er) are photoluminescent under UV radiation. Their UV&#8208;Vis spectra show the typical absorptions associated with 4f&#8208;4f transitions and absorption edges in the UV (band gaps &#8805; 5.7 eV). The RE3+ cation is coordinated by seven oxygen atoms, which define a distorted pentagonal bipyramid. The bipyramids share trans&#8208;edges of their base forming infinite chains. Triangular (BO3)3&#8211; groups connect the chains into layers. The crystal structure of Na2[Ho(BO3)(OH)2] was investigated at various temperatures in the range 100 K &#8804; T &#8804; 320 K. Above 310(2) K, the compound crystallizes in the orthorhombic space group Cmcm (&#946;&#8208;phase), below, it undergoes a displacive phase transition of second order resulting in a monoclinic structure in space group C2/c (&#945;&#8208;phase). The critical exponents derived from different structural parameters indicate a cooperative distortion of the borate layers, but a rather uncorrelated adaptation of the sodium cations to their local environment. The other compounds of the series also adopt the structure of the &#945;&#8208;phase at 296 K.</dc:description>

         <title>ZnH2P4N8: Case Study on Topochemical Imidonitridophosphate High&#8208;Pressure Synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nitridophosphates are subject of current research, as they have a broad spectrum of properties and potential applications, such as ion conductors or luminescent materials. Yet, the subclass of imidonitridophosphates has been studied less extensively. The primary reason is that the controlled N&#8211;H functionalization of nitridophosphates is not straight forward, making targeted synthesis more challenging. Inspired by the high&#8208;pressure (HP) post&#8208;synthetic modification of nitridophosphates, we present the topochemical HP deprotonation of phosphorus nitride imides using the high&#8208;pressure polymorph &#946;&#8208;PN(NH) as an example. Additional incorporation of Zn2+ results in the first quaternary transition metal imidonitridophosphate ZnH2P4N8. The crystal structure was elucidated by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (SCXRD), energy&#8208;dispersive X&#8208;ray spectroscopy (EDX), powder X&#8208;ray diffraction (PXRD) and solid&#8208;state magic angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MAS NMR). In addition, the presence of H as part of an imide group was confirmed by IR spectroscopy. The potential of this defunctionalization approach for controlling the N&#8211;H content is demonstrated by the preparation of partially deprotonated intermediates ZnxH4&#8722;2xP4N8 (x&#160;&#8776;&#160; 0.5, 0.85). This topochemical high&#8208;pressure reaction represents a promising way to prepare, control and manipulate new imide&#8208;based materials without altering their overall anionic framework</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The emergence of drug resistance in cancer&#160;is a serious threat. Upregulation of&#160;ABC/P&#8208;gp&#160;transporters significantly contributes to this&#160;emergence.&#160;Despite&#160;30 years of efforts,&#160;the search for effective ABC/P&#8208;gp inhibitors with&#160;minimal&#160;toxicity to human cells, is&#160;still underway.&#160;Inspired by Nocardioazine A, a marine alkaloid that inhibits&#160;P&#8208;gp, we report a regioselective pathway to create&#160;indole&#8208;C3&#8208;benzyl cyclo&#8208;L&#8208;Trp&#8208;L&#8208;Trp DKPs. We have reported that&#160;exo&#8208;C3&#8208;N&#8208;Dbn&#173;&#8208;Trp2 (13) as a lead ABCB1 inhibitor that is more effective than Verapamil. C3N&#8208;Dbn&#8208;Trp2 restored chemotherapy sensitivity in drug&#8208;resistant human cancer cells and had no adverse effect on cell proliferation.&#160;Herein, we report several such&#160;C3&#8208;functionalized pyrroloindolines as ABCB1 inhibitors.&#160;Results arising from the molecular docking studies indicate that the interactions at the access tunnel between ABCB1 and the inhibitor result in a powerful predictor for the efficacy of the inhibitor. Based on fluorescence&#8208;based assays, we conclude that the most efficacious inhibitor is the p&#8208;cyano&#8208;derived exo&#8208;C3&#8208;N&#8208;Dbn&#173;&#8208;Trp2 (33a), closely followed by several analogues. We correlate that the predictions based on the inhibitor interactions at the access tunnel provide clues about the design of improved ABCB1 inhibitors. This work lays the foundation for the design of a new class of inhibitors from a&#160;cyclo&#8208;L&#8208;Trp&#8208;L&#8208;Trp DKP scaffold.</dc:description>

         <title>Columnar Organization of Nonalternant Fluorinated Dehydrobenzannulenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two new partially fluorinated dehydrobenzannulenes have been prepared by inter&#8208; and intramolecular oxidative homocoupling of diyne precursors. These systems contain fluorinated and nonfluorinated arene rings in a non&#8208;alternant arrangement. Both macrocycles are roughly planar and organize into extended columns in the solid state. The assembly of these columns is mediated by the combination of dispersion interactions, slipped [&#960;&#183;&#183;&#183;&#960;] stacking interactions of the perfluorinated rings with each other, and their association with the nonfluorinated rings in the molecules of the neighboring macrocycles. These results suggest that partial fluorination of dehydrobenzannulenes can serve as a versatile motif for their assembly into columnar superstructures.</dc:description>

         <title>Chiral Amphiphilic Au23 Cluster and Its Specific Recognition to Remote Di&#8208;amines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The atomic precision of metal nanoclusters and variability of surface ligands pave the way for its rational design and functionalization, whereas the property strengthening in multiple ways has been long challenging. Herein, improved amphiphilicity, chirality, thermostability, and strong CPL (circularly polarized luminescence) properties have been accomplished by facile ligand exchange of [Au23(CHT)16]&#8208; with HCapt (HCHT and HCapt denote cyclohexanethiol and captopril). In addition, the obtained chiral [Au23(SR)16]&#8208; (short for [Au23(CHT)16&#8208;x(Capt)x]&#8208;) clusters show specific binding affinity to remote&#8208;diamines (such as arginine and single/double strand DNA), originating from the hydrogen bonding and Van der Walls interaction among the surface Capt ligands and the di&#8208;amine groups.</dc:description>

         <title>In&#8208;Situ Electrolyte for Electrosynthesis: Scalable Anodically&#8208;Enabled One&#8208;Pot Sequence from Aldehyde to Isoxazol(in)es</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrochemical transformations are considered a green alternative to classical redox chemistry as it eliminates the necessity for toxic and waste producing redox reagents. Typical electrochemical reactions require the addition of a so&#8208;called supporting electrolyte &#8208; a salt bridge &#8211; and other additives, such as hexafluorisopropanol, to enhance conductivity and reaction outcomes, respectively. However, this is often accompanied by an increase in the amount of produced waste. Here, we report an "in&#8208;situ electrolyte" concept for facile, transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free, additive&#8208;free one&#8208;pot electrochemical preparation of isoxazol(in)es, important scaffolds for biologically active natural and synthetic molecules, from the respective aldehydes. The protocol utilizes no halogenated solvents and no external oxidants, while salt side&#8208;products provide the ionic conductivity necessary for the electrosynthesis. The electrolysis is performed in an undivided cell, using the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art electrodes for the chlor&#8208;alkali industry dimensionally stable and scalable mixed metal oxide anode and platinized titanium anode of high durability. The cascade transformation comprises the condensation of aldehyde to oxime followed by its anodic oxidation and subsequent intra&#8208; and/or intermolecular [3+2] cycloadditions with an appropriate dipolarophile. Chemical yields up to 97%, and good Faradaic efficiency, scalability, and stability are observed for most substrates in a broad scope.</dc:description>

         <title>Assay for characterizing adsorption&#8208;properties of surfaces (APS)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Analytes, from sample preparation, until entering an analytical instrument, are prone to adsorb to surfaces, driven by the chemical properties of the surface and the liquids they are dissolved in. This problem can be addressed with internal standards when a single or few known analytes are quantified that are usually not available in omics. However, minimal to no loss of analytes is the aim. Here, we present a novel assay for qualifying and quantifying interactions responsible for adsorption of molecules to surfaces (APS) by using LC&#8208;MS/MS&#8208;based differential quantitative analysis. To reflect a broad range of chemical interactions with surfaces, a reference mixture of thousands of tryptic peptides, with known compositions was selected, representing a variety of different chemical characteristics. The assay was tested by investigating the adsorption properties of several different vials with different surface chemistries. A significant number of hydrophobic peptides adsorbed to conventional polypropylene vials. In contrast, only few peptides adsorbed to polypropylene vials, assigned as low&#8208;protein&#8208;binding. The highest number of peptides adsorbed to glass vials driven by electrostatic interactions. In summary, the new assay is suitable to characterize adsorption properties of different surfaces and to approximate the loss of analytes during sample preparation.</dc:description>

         <title>Real&#8208;Time Metabolic Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy of Pancreatic and Colon Cancer Tumor&#8208;Xenografts with Parahydrogen Hyperpolarized 1&#8208;13C Pyruvate&#8208;d3</title>

1&#8208;13C&#8208;pyruvate&#8208;d3 hyperpolarized via parahydrogen can be used to study altered metabolism with MRI in pancreatic as well as colon cancer human tumor&#8208;xenografts.







Abstract
Parahydrogen&#8208;induced polarization (PHIP) is an emerging technique to enhance the signal of stable isotope metabolic contrast agents for Magnetic Resonance (MR). The objective of this study is to continue establishing 1&#8208;13C&#8208;pyruvate&#8208;d3, signal&#8208;enhanced via PHIP, as a hyperpolarized contrast agent, obtained in seconds, to monitor metabolism in human cancer. Our focus was on human pancreatic and colon tumor xenografts. 1&#8208;13C&#8208;vinylpyruvate&#8208;d6 was hydrogenated using parahydrogen. Thereafter, the polarization of the protons was transferred to 13C. Following a workup procedure, the free hyperpolarized 1&#8208;13C&#8208;pyruvate&#8208;d3 was obtained in clean aqueous solution. After injection into animals bearing either pancreatic or colon cancer xenografts, slice&#8208;selective MR spectra were acquired and analyzed to determine rate constants of metabolic conversion into lactate and alanine. 1&#8208;13C&#8208;pyruvate&#8208;d3 proved to follow the increased metabolic rate to lactate and alanine in the tumor xenografts.

         <title>Elevating Oxygen Evolution using Iron Phthalocyanine Infused Vanillic acid Electrocatalyst</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The designing of transition metal based organic catalyst plays an important role in water oxidation to produce oxygen. The present work involves the fabrication of iron based phthalocyanine catalyst on Ni foam which exhibited higher oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity with lower overpotential compared to standard IrO2&#8901; It emphasizes the role of bimetallic Fe and Ni catalyst in the enhancement of OER activity.







Abstract
Oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is the bottle neck step in water splitting reaction towards the realization of hydrogen based clean energy production and storage. Metal air batteries and polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells (PEMFC) are the alternative green energy systems that utilise O2 and H2 in the production of continuous and high energy output without the utilization of carbon based fuels which are the major sources of pollution. Transition metal based N4 organics are explored extensively as oxygen electrocatalysts i.&#8201;e., OER and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalysts because of their ease of synthesis, tuneable properties, low cost and high performance with long term stability. Here, vanillic acid functionalized iron phthalocyanine (FeVAPc) was synthesised and characterised by various spectroscopic techniques. The novel FeVAPc exhibited good thermal stability and was coated on Ni foam for OER studies. The scanning electron microscopy images showed net&#8208;work like surface morphology and the X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy indicated the presence of Fe in +3 oxidation state. The Ni/FeVAPc demonstrated excellent electrocatalytic activity for OER with overpotential of 312&#8197;mV at 10&#8197;mA.cm&#8722;2 current density in 1.0&#8197;M KOH electrolyte. The designed organic based catalyst exhibited lesser Tafel slope value which is nearer to the benchmark catalyst, IrO2. The proposed catalyst exhibited good stability as phthalocyanines are highly stable and do not undergo decomposition even in strong acidic and basic corrosive media. Integration of FeVAPc onto the Ni foam resulted in higher mass activity, lower charge transfer resistance, high active surface area leading to enhanced conductivity and activity. The fabricated Ni/FeVAPc is an appropriate cost&#8208;effective, efficient and stable catalyst for OER towards industrial applications.

         <title>Electrostatic Surface Potentials and Chalcogen&#8208;Bonding Motifs of Substituted 2,1,3&#8208;Benzoselenadiazoles Probed via 77Se Solid&#8208;State NMR Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The influence of substituents on the self&#8208;complementary chalcogen bonding of 2,1,3&#8208;benzoselenadiazoles is investigated through solid&#8208;state and computational methods. 77Se solid&#8208;state NMR is found to be a sensitive probe of molecular surface potentials and chalcogen bond motifs.







Abstract
Chalcogen bonds (ChB) are moderately strong, directional, and specific non&#8208;covalent interactions that have garnered substantial interest over the last decades. Specifically, the presence of two &#963;&#8208;holes offers great potential for crystal engineering, catalysis, biochemistry, and molecular sensing. However, ChB applications are currently hampered by a lack of methods to characterize and control chalcogen bonds. Here, we report on the influence of various substituents (halogens, cyano, and methyl groups) on the observed self&#8208;complementary ChB networks of 2,1,3&#8208;benzoselenadiazoles. From molecular electrostatic potential calculations, we show that the electrostatic surface potentials (ESP) of the &#963;&#8208;holes on selenium are largely influenced by the electron&#8208;withdrawing character of these substituents. Structural analyses via X&#8208;ray diffraction reveal a variety of ChB geometries and binding modes that are rationalized via the computed ESP maps, although the structure of 5,6&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;2,1,3&#8208;benzoselenadiazole also demonstrates the influence of steric interactions. 77Se solid&#8208;state magic&#8208;angle spinning NMR spectroscopy, in particular the analysis of the selenium chemical shift tensors, is found to be an effective probe able to characterize both structural and electrostatic features of these self&#8208;complementary ChB systems. We find a positive correlation between the value of the ESP maxima at the &#963;&#8208;holes and the experimentally measured 77Se isotropic chemical shift, while the skew of the chemical shift tensor is established as a metric which is reflective of the ChB binding motif.

         <title>Photochemical Initiation and Reactions of Thiyl Radicals Studied with SH2&#8217; Radical Traps</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
SH2&#8217;&#8208;based radical traps were used to probe the mechanisms of photochemical spirocyclisation of indole&#8208;ynones with thiols and a relate thiol&#8208;ene reaction. The observation of trapped initiator radicals by electrospray ionisation mass spectrometry (ESI&#8208;MS) was consistent with the proposed formation of an intramolecular electron donor&#8208;acceptor indole&#8208;ynone complex. Trends in MS intensity of trapped intermediate radicals were rationalised in terms of radical reactivity.







Abstract
A radical trapping method based on an SH2&#8217; homolytic substitution reaction was applied to study the mechanism of a photochemical spirocyclisation of indole&#8208;ynones in the presence of thiols. Starting material, products and a range of trapped radical intermediates were simultaneously detected in reaction mixtures by mass spectrometry (MS). The trapped intermediates included both initiating and main chain propagating radicals. These data made it possible to propose a self&#8208;initiation mechanism consistent with the originally postulated photoexcitation of an intramolecular electron donor&#8208;acceptor complex of the substrate. The effect of thiol structure on the MS peak intensity of the reaction components was rationalised in terms of the relative stability of the radical intermediates. The results were compared to a simpler related reaction, a photochemical thiol&#8208;ene addition where reagents, products and trapped intermediate radicals were also detected by MS. Relative MS peak intensities were again explained by a combination of electronic and steric effects on the stability of intermediate radicals. Overall, SH2&#8217; radical trapping was demonstrated to be a powerful experimental technique for providing mechanistic evidence on photochemical and other organic radical reactions.

         <title>Gas Delivery Relevant to Human Health using Porous Materials</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Gases are essential for various applications relevant to human health and medicine. This Perspective aims to review the use of porous materials for the delivery of medicinally relevant gases including hydrogen sulfide, xenon, oxygen, and various gases for organic synthesis and to highlight the advantages of these solid&#8208;state systems over traditional methods of gas storage and delivery.







Abstract
Gases are essential for various applications relevant to human health, including in medicine, biomedical imaging, and pharmaceutical synthesis. However, gases are significantly more challenging to safely handle than liquids and solids. Herein, we review the use of porous materials, such as metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs), zeolites, and silicas, to adsorb medicinally relevant gases and facilitate their handling as solids. Specific topics include the use of MOFs and zeolites to deliver H2S for therapeutic applications, 129Xe for magnetic resonance imaging, O2 for the treatment of cancer and hypoxia, and various gases for use in organic synthesis. This Perspective aims to bring together the organic, inorganic, medicinal, and materials chemistry communities to inspire the design of next&#8208;generation porous materials for the storage and delivery of medicinally relevant gases.

         <title>Enhanced Photocatalytic Ozonation Using Modified TiO2 With Designed Nucleophilic and Electrophilic Sites</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The surface hydroxyl groups greatly promote O3 adsorption due to the presence of nucleophilic O&#8208;sites and electrophilic H&#8208;sites. At the same time, the surface hydroxyl groups lead to the internal polarization of the surface&#8208;adsorbed O3 and enhanced separation of photogenerated charge carriers, both of which are beneficial to promote O3 activation and ROS formation. Therefore, TiO2&#8722;OH displays efficiently photocatalytic ozonation. Notably, TiO2&#8722;OH mineralization efficiency in pharmaceutical plant wastewater is as high as 97.6&#8201;% within 7&#8197;hours.







Abstract
Photocatalytic ozonation is considered to be a promising approach for the treatment of refractory organic pollutants, but the design of efficient catalyst remains a challenge. Surface modification provides a potential strategy to improve the activity of photocatalytic ozonation. In this work, density functional theory (DFT) calculations were first performed to check the interaction between O3 and TiO2&#8722;OH (surface hydroxylated TiO2) or TiO2&#8722;F (surface fluorinated TiO2), and the results suggest that TiO2&#8722;OH displays better O3 adsorption and activation than does TiO2&#8722;F, which is confirmed by experimental results. The surface hydroxyl groups greatly promote the O3 activation, which is beneficial for the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Importantly, TiO2&#8722;OH displays better performance towards pollutants (such as berberine hydrochloride) removal than does TiO2&#8722;F and most reported ozonation photocatalysts. The total organic carbon (TOC) removal efficiency reaches 84.4&#8201;% within two hours. This work highlights the effect of surface hydroxylation on photocatalytic ozonation and provides ideas for the design of efficient photocatalytic ozonation catalysts.

         <title>Design and Realization of Visual and Contact&#8208;Type Fast Charging Power Source</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Different with the charging method of conventional batteries, charging is achieved by a Zn sheet contacting with a WO3 film moistened with water, resulting in a rapid discoloration of WO3, and the open&#8208;circuit voltage of the device is 0.7&#8197;V, which can be used to drive various electronics by series&#8208;parallel connection.







Abstract
Charging power supplies with both fast and visualization functions have a wide range of applications in the information and new energy industries. In this paper, the visualized and contact&#8208;type fast charging power supply based on WO3 film and Zn sheet is presented, and the prototype devices are fabricated. Different with the charging method of conventional batteries, charging is achieved by a Zn sheet contacting with a WO3 film moistened with water, resulting in a rapid discoloration of WO3. Theoretical investigation indicates that the interaction between Zn sheet and water molecules is the primary cause of the color change in the WO3 film. The WO3 film completes the colouring state within 10&#8197;s in the presence of Zn sheet and water, and the open&#8208;circuit voltage of the device is 0.7&#8197;V, which can be used to drive various electronics by series&#8208;parallel connection. This research introduces a novel method to induce colouring of WO3 films and proposes a fast charging mode different from traditional power sources. It provides valuable insights for the future development of fast charging in the field of electrical energy.

         <title>Elucidating Mechanism and Selectivity in Pyridine Functionalization Through Silylium Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that a semi&#8208;enclosed &#8242;rigid&#8217; electronegative cavity in PADI&#8208;type anions creates a well&#8208;defined recognition site, facilitating interaction with positively charged silylium pyridine species. Due to the high electrophilicity and minimal steric demand at the C4&#8208;position of the pyridine substrate, the reaction predominantly produces a C4&#8208;regioselective product.







Abstract
The functionalization of aromatic N&#8208;heterocycles through silylium activation demonstrates exceptional selectivity and efficiency. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations unveil the detailed silylium catalysis mechanism and elucidate the origins of selectivity in this reaction. The phosphoramidimidate sulfonamide (PADI) precatalyst orchestrates of the catalytic cycle via three elementary steps. The Br&#248;nsted acidity of precatalyst significantly influences both the formation of silylium&#8208;based Lewis acid active species and the silylium activation of pyridine. Unlike disulfonimide (DSI)&#8208;type precatalysts, both Tf2NH and PADI precatalysts with strong acidities can easily promote the generation of activated silylium pyridine species. A semi&#8208;enclosed &#8242;rigid&#8217; electronegative cavity in PADI&#8208;type anions constructs a well&#8208;defined recognition site, facilitating engagement with the positively charged silylium pyridine species. Due to the high electrophilicity and less steric demand at the C4&#8208;position of the pyridine substrate, the product with C4&#8208;regioselectivity was predominantly generated.

         <title>Radical C&#8208;Glycosylation Using Photoexcitable Unprotected Glycosyl Borate</title>

         <dc:description>
We have developed radical C&#8208;glycosylation using photoexcitable unprotected glycosyl borate. The direct excitation of glycosyl borate under visible light irradiation enabled the generation of anomeric radical without any photoredox catalysts. The in&#8197;situ generated anomeric radical was applicable to the radical addition such as Giese&#8208;type addition and Minisci&#8208;type reaction to introduce alkyl and heteroaryl groups at the anomeric position. In addition, the radical&#8211;radical coupling between the glycosyl borate and acyl imidazolide provided unprotected acyl C&#8208;glycoside.

         <title>Novel Benzothiadiazole&#8208;based Donor&#8208;Acceptor Systems: Synthesis, Ultrafast Charge Transfer and Separation Dynamics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new series of benzothiadiazole&#8208;based donor&#8208;acceptor chromophores with multiple donor/acceptor entities of variable electronic strengths has been designed, synthesized, and unveiled their explicit photo&#8208;electro&#8208;chemical responses for the first time. Facile intramolecular charge transfer, subsequent charge separation, and broad absorption expand their horizons in advanced optical and photonic applications.







Abstract
Near&#8208;infrared (NIR) absorbing electron donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8722;A) chromophores have been at the forefront of current energy research owing to their facile charge transfer (CT) characteristics, which are primitive for photovoltaic applications. Herein, we have designed and developed a new set of benzothiadiazole (BTD)&#8208;based tetracyanobutadiene (TCBD)/dicyanoquinodimethane (DCNQ)&#8208;embedded multimodular D&#8722;A systems (BTD1&#8208;BTD6) and investigated their inherent photo&#8208;electro&#8208;chemical responses for the first time having identical and mixed terminal donors of variable donicity. Apart from poor luminescence, the appearance of broad low&#8208;lying optical transitions extendable even in the NIR region (&gt;1000&#8197;nm), particularly in the presence of the auxiliary acceptors, are indicative of underlying nonradiative excited state processes leading to robust intramolecular CT and subsequent charge separation (CS) processes in these D&#8722;A constructs. While electrochemical studies identify the moieties involved in these photo&#8208;events, orbital delocalization and consequent evidence for the low&#8208;energy CT transitions have been achieved from theoretical calculations. Finally, the spectral and temporal responses of different photoproducts are obtained from femtosecond transient absorption studies, which, coupled with spectroelectrochemical data, identify broad NIR signals as CS states of the compounds. All the systems are found to be susceptible to ultrafast (~ps) CT and CS before carrier recombination to the ground state, which is, however, significantly facilitated after incorporation of the secondary TCBD/DCNQ acceptors, leading to faster and thus efficient CT processes, particularly in polar solvents. These findings, including facile CT/CS and broad and intense panchromatic absorption over a wide window of the electromagnetic spectrum, are likely to expand the horizons of BTD&#8208;based multimodular CT systems to revolutionize the realm of solar energy conversion and associated photonic applications.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Near-infrared (NIR) absorbing electron donor-acceptor (D&#8722;A) chromophores have been at the forefront of current energy research owing to their facile charge transfer (CT) characteristics, which are primitive for photovoltaic applications. Herein, we have designed and developed a new set of benzothiadiazole (BTD)-based tetracyanobutadiene (TCBD)/dicyanoquinodimethane (DCNQ)-embedded multimodular D&#8722;A systems (&lt;b&gt;BTD1-BTD6&lt;/b&gt;) and investigated their inherent photo-electro-chemical responses for the first time having identical and mixed terminal donors of variable donicity. Apart from poor luminescence, the appearance of broad low-lying optical transitions extendable even in the NIR region (&amp;gt;1000&#8197;nm), particularly in the presence of the auxiliary acceptors, are indicative of underlying nonradiative excited state processes leading to robust intramolecular CT and subsequent charge separation (CS) processes in these D&#8722;A constructs. While electrochemical studies identify the moieties involved in these photo-events, orbital delocalization and consequent evidence for the low-energy CT transitions have been achieved from theoretical calculations. Finally, the spectral and temporal responses of different photoproducts are obtained from femtosecond transient absorption studies, which, coupled with spectroelectrochemical data, identify broad NIR signals as CS states of the compounds. All the systems are found to be susceptible to ultrafast (~ps) CT and CS before carrier recombination to the ground state, which is, however, significantly facilitated after incorporation of the secondary TCBD/DCNQ acceptors, leading to faster and thus efficient CT processes, particularly in polar solvents. These findings, including facile CT/CS and broad and intense panchromatic absorption over a wide window of the electromagnetic spectrum, are likely to expand the horizons of BTD-based multimodular CT systems to revolutionize the realm of solar energy conversion and associated photonic applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

A facile synthetic strategy was developed to prepare a class of CL&#8208;based monomers (R&#8208;TO) with a variety of functionalities and well&#8208;defined stereochemistry by exploit of epoxides, which readily polymerize via well&#8208;controlled ring&#8208;opening polymerization (ROP) to afford a series of amorphous polyesters P(R&#8208;TO). Sequential addition copolymerization of MTO and L&#8208;lactide (L&#8208;LA) allowed to access of a series of ABA triblock copolymers with composition&#8208;dependent mechanical properties.







Abstract
The development of innovative synthetic strategies to create functional polycaprolactones is highly demanded for advanced material applications. In this contribution, we reported a facile synthetic strategy to prepare a class of CL&#8208;based monomers (R&#8208;TO) derived from epoxides. They readily polymerize via well&#8208;controlled ring&#8208;opening polymerization (ROP) to afford a series of polyesters P(R&#8208;TO) with high molecular weight (Mn up to 350&#8197;kDa). Sequential addition copolymerization of MTO and L&#8208;lactide (L&#8208;LA) allowed to access of a series of ABA triblock copolymers with composition&#8208;dependent mechanical properties. Notably, P(L&#8208;LA)100&#8208;b&#8208;P(MTO)500&#8208;b&#8208;P(L&#8208;LA)100 containing the amorphous P(MTO) segment as a soft midblock and crystalline P(L&#8208;LA) domain as hard end block behaved as an excellent thermoplastic elastomer (TPE) with high elongation at break (1438&#177;204&#8201;%), tensile strength (23.5&#177;1.7&#8197;MPa), and outstanding elastic recovery (&gt;88&#8201;%).

         <title>Lead Bromide Complex in Tri&#8208;n&#8208;Octylphosphine Oxide Matrix with Bright Photoluminance and Exceptional Thermoplasticity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal halide materials, known for their opto&#8208;electronic properties and structural diversity, face challenges due to rigidity, making them brittle and difficult to shape. We introduce a thermoplastic hybrid lead halide solid, formed by integrating lead bromide complex into a TOPO matrix. This enables near&#8208;room&#8208;temperature melt&#8208;processing, offering potential for self&#8208;healing fluorescent inks.







Abstract
Metal halide materials have recently drawn increasing research interest for their excellent opto&#8208;electronic properties and structural diversity, but their resulting rigid structures render them brittle and poor formability during manufacturing. Here we demonstrate a thermoplastic luminant hybrid lead halide solid by integrating lead bromide complex into tri&#8208;n&#8208;octylphosphine oxide (TOPO) matrix. The construction of the hybrid materials can be achieved by a simple dissolution process, in which TOPO molecules act as the solvents and ligands to yield the monodispersed clusters. The combination of these functional units enables the near&#8208;room&#8208;temperature melt&#8208;processing of the materials into targeted geometry by simple molding or printing techniques, which offer possibilities for fluorescent writing inks with outstanding self&#8208;healing capacity to physical damage. The intermarriage between metal halide clusters with functional molecules expands the range of practical applications for hybrid metal halide materials.

         <title>Intramolecular Nucleophilic Vinylic Substitution (SNV) by Carbon Nucleophiles: Conformationally Directed Formation of Dienes from N,N&#8217;&#8208;Diallyl Ureas</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Diallyl ureas, on treatment with base, undergo a cascade of reversible deprotonations and alkene isomerisations that culminate in an intramolecular SNV reaction that links the two allylic substituents together to form a diene.







Abstract
Nucleophilic vinylic substitution (SNV) by carbon nucleophiles allows the formation of vinylic C&#8722;C bonds without transition metal catalysts. In this paper, we show that tethering two alkenes together through a urea linkage can lead to the formation of a diene by an intramolecular SNV reaction. The starting materials are fully substituted N,N&#8217;&#8208;diallyl ureas; the reaction proceeds in the presence of base, and entails a cascade of deprotonations, reprotonations, and an SNV reaction of an allylic carbanion on a rare electrophile: a vinylic urea. As a result, two allylic substituents couple to form a diene, despite the fact that neither is activated towards electrophilic attack. The reaction is tolerant of significant steric bulk, and exhibits regioselectivity with unsymmetrical diallyl ureas: &#946;&#8208;substituted allyl groups invariably behave as nucleophiles, while electrophilic behavior may be enforced by the use of an E&#8208;vinylic urea substituent that cannot be deprotonated under the reaction conditions.

How to select a few cells from a culture and modify them with a probe? Triphenylamine&#8208;sensitized 8&#8208;DMAQ (TAQ) probes showed internalization in HeLa cells that could be consecutively activated either by using UV light source (357&#8197;nm) or, under two&#8208;photon irradiation conditions (760&#8197;nm). Activation allowed to efficient release of the reporter into cells in light&#8208;exposed regions.







Abstract
Triphenylamine&#8208;sensitized 8&#8208;dimethylaminoquinoline (TAQ) probes showed fair two&#8208;photon absorption and fragmentation cross sections in releasing kainate and GABA ligands.

         <title>Dimers and 2D Networks of Adamantane&#8208;Related Ternary Organosilicon Coinage Metal Sulfide Clusters</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reactions of the organosilicon sulfide cluster [(PhSi)4S6] with [AgCl(PMe2Ph)2]2 or mixtures of MCl (M=Cu or Ag) and a phosphine ligand in CH2Cl2 caused its disassembly and reorganization under incorporation of metal phosphine moieties to form [(Ph3P)3Ag(&#956;&#8208;S)SiCl2Ph], [(PhSiClS2CH2)2(&#956;&#8208;dppb)], [{(dppbCu2)Cu(&#956;&#8211;dppb)0.5(PhSi)3S6}2], and [Na2(thf)1.5][(Me2PhPAg)(PhSi)3S6]. The latter two represent ternary M&#8722;S&#8722;Si&#8208;based clusters with complex crystal structures and wideband semiconductor&#8208;like optical gaps.







Abstract
Adamantane&#8208;type organotin sulfide clusters were recently shown to react with coinage metal phosphine complexes under replacement of an organic substituent by a metal&#8208;phosphine unit. An extension of such studies involving the silicon&#8208;based congener [(PhSi)4S6] (A) revealed that the cluster core will be partly disassembled and a {PhSi} moiety is replaced by a coinage metal phosphine complex to form [(Et3PAg)3(PhSi)3S6] (B) and [Na2(thf)2.33][(Me3PCu)(PhSi)3S6] (C). Herein, we present an extension of this work upon variation of the reactants and reaction conditions. Besides the isolation of crystalline precursor complexes [CuCl(PMe2Ph)3] (1) and [AgCl(PMe2Ph)2]2 (2), the study addresses reactions of A with AgCl and a phosphine ligand in CH2Cl2, upon which A is completely disassembled to form [(Ph3P)3Ag(&#956;&#8208;S)SiCl2Ph] (3). In another case a CH2 group, most likely stemming from CH2Cl2, was attached to the ligand, thus generating [{PhCl(S)SiSCH2P(Ph2)CH2CH2}2] (4). Upon using CuCl and 1,4&#8208;bis(diphenylphosphino)butane (dppb) we isolated the phosphine&#8208;bridged analog of B, [{(dppbCu2)CuP(Ph2)(CH2CH2)(PhSi)3S6}2] (5). In order to receive the yet elusive silver homolog of C, we used PMe2Ph as a bulkier ligand. This way we generated a 2D coordination polymer of the desired composition, [Na2(thf)1.5][(Me2PhPAg)(PhSi)3S6] (6). UV&#8208;visible spectra of 6 indicated a bandgap of 3.89&#8197;eV, thus blue&#8208;shifted in regards to B and C.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adamantane-type organotin sulfide clusters were recently shown to react with coinage metal phosphine complexes under replacement of an organic substituent by a metal-phosphine unit. An extension of such studies involving the silicon-based congener [(PhSi)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;] (&lt;b&gt;A&lt;/b&gt;) revealed that the cluster core will be partly disassembled and a {PhSi} moiety is replaced by a coinage metal phosphine complex to form [(Et&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;PAg)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(PhSi)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;] (&lt;b&gt;B&lt;/b&gt;) and [Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(thf)&lt;sub&gt;2.33&lt;/sub&gt;][(Me&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;PCu)(PhSi)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;] (&lt;b&gt;C&lt;/b&gt;).

         <title>Selective Oxidation of Vitamin D3 Enhanced by Long&#8208;Range Effects of a Substrate Channel Mutation in Cytochrome P450BM3 (CYP102A1)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Long&#8208;range effects from mutation of a substrate access tunnel residue selected by docking&#8208;guided design of cytochrome P450BM3 (CYP102A1) to loosen the interaction between two secondary structure elements reshaped the substrate binding pocket and increased the activity for the oxidation vitamin D3 to 25&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;vitamin D3, an important human and animal health supplement.







Abstract
Vitamin D deficiency affects nearly half the population, with many requiring or opting for supplements with vitamin D3 (VD3), the precursor of vitamin D (1&#945;,25&#8208;dihydroxyVD3). 25&#8208;HydroxyVD3, the circulating form of vitamin D, is a more effective supplement than VD3 but its synthesis is complex. We report here the engineering of cytochrome P450BM3 (CYP102A1) for the selective oxidation of VD3 to 25&#8208;hydroxyVD3. Long&#8208;range effects of the substrate&#8208;channel mutation Glu435Ile promoted binding of the VD3 side chain close to the heme, enhancing VD3 oxidation activity that reached 6.62&#8197;g of 25&#8208;hydroxyVD3 isolated from a 1&#8208;litre scale reaction (69.1&#8201;% yield; space&#8208;time&#8208;yield 331&#8197;mg/L/h).

         <title>Realizing Color Transitions for Three Copper (I) Cluster Organic&#8208;Inorganic Hybrid Materials by Adjusting Reaction Conditions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three isomeric copper iodide cluster hybrid materials 1&#8211;3 were achieved by adjusting the reaction conditions. The crystal color transit from green, yellow to orange with high QYs at 57&#8201;%~88&#8201;%. All three complexes have good thermal stability, good solution processability, and high quantum yield. This study can provide development of cuprous iodide cluster luminescent materials.







Abstract
Copper iodide organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid materials have been favored by many researchers in the field of solid&#8208;state lighting (SSL) due to their structural diversity and optical adjustability. In this paper, three isomeric copper iodide cluster hybrid materials, Cu4I6(L)2(1), Cu5I4.5Cl2.5(L)2(2) and Cu5I7(L)2) (3) (L=1&#8208;(4&#8208;methylpyrimidin&#8208;2&#8208;yl)&#8208;1,4&#8208;diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octan&#8208;1&#8208;ium), were achieved by adjusting the reaction conditions. The crystal color transit from green, yellow to orange and the internal quantum yield (IQY) increase from 57&#8201;%&#8211;88&#8201;%. All three complexes have good thermal stability, good solution processability, and high quantum yield. And origin and mechanism of luminescence of complexes were further studied. This study can provide ideas and theoretical basis for the regulation of cuprous iodide cluster luminescent materials.

         <title>High Rotational Barrier Atropisomers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unprecedented class of atropisomers based on Ugi reaction that exhibit exceptional rotational barrier is reported. The versatility of our approach enables the synthesis of atropisomers &#8220;by design&#8221; and allow the conceptualization of this work in atroposelective synthesis and high&#8208;sensitivity modular balances. Single&#8208;crystal structures, combined by DFT calculations and dynamic NMR allow us to examine a plethora of &#960;&#8208;interactions.







Abstract
Atropisomers have attracted a great deal of attention lately due to their numerous applications in organic synthesis and to their employment in drug discovery. However, the synthetic arsenal at our disposal with which to access them remains limited. The research described herein is two&#8208;pronged; we both demonstrate the use of MCR chemistry as a synthetic strategy for the de novo synthesis of a class of atropisomers having high barriers to rotation with the simultaneous insertion of multiple chiral elements and we study these unprecedented molecular systems by employing a combination of crystallography, NMR and DFT calculations. By fully exploiting the synthetic capabilities of our chemistry, we have been able to monitor a range of different types of interaction, i.&#8201;e. &#960;&#8208;&#960;, CH&#8211;&#960;, heteroatom&#8208;&#960; and CD&#8211;&#960;, in order to conduct structure&#8208;property studies. The results could be applied both to atroposelective synthesis and in drug discovery.
