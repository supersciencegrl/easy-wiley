         <title>Direct Synthesis of Phosphoryltriacetates from White Phosphorus via Visible Light Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organophosphorus compounds (OPCs) are widely used in many fields. However, traditional synthetic routes in the industry usually involve multistep and hazardous procedures. Therefore, it&#8217;s of great significance to construct such compounds in an environmental&#8208;friendly and facile way. Herein, a photoredox catalytic method has been developed to construct novel phosphoryltriacetates. Using fac&#8208;Ir(ppy)3 (ppy = 2&#8208;phenylpyridine) as the photocatalyst and blue LEDs (456 nm) as the light source, white phosphorus can react with &#945;&#8208;bromo esters smoothly to generate phosphoryltriacetates in moderate to good yields. This one&#8208;step approach features mild reaction conditions and simple operational process without chlorination.</dc:description>

         <title>B(C6F5)3&#8208;Catalyzed [2+3]&#8208;Cyclative o,m&#8208;diC&#8208;H Functionalization of Phenols</title>

         <dc:description>
A B(C6F5)3&#8208;catalyzed highly chemoselective [2+3]&#8208;cyclative diC&#8722;H functionalization of phenols tethered with propargylic ether motifs was developed for the synthesis of polycyclic compounds. Derivatizations of the phenol&#8208;OH group demonstrated the good variability of the cyclization products, indicating the potential application of this methodology in the preparation of other types of polycyclic compounds.







Abstract
Metal&#8208;free catalytic C&#8722;H functionalization is highly desired for the construction of C&#8722;C bonds. We herein report a highly chemoselective consecutive C&#8722;H [2+3]&#8208;cyclative functionalization for the simultaneous formation of two C&#8722;C bonds with construction of polycyclic phenols catalyzed by commercially available and low&#8208;cost B(C6F5)3. This catalytic system tolerates a wide range of substrate scope, providing a series of 2,6,7,8&#8208;tetrahydroacenaphthylen&#8208;3&#8208;ol&#8208;type polycyclic compounds efficiently. Several derivatizations of the catalytic products have also been conducted to show the potential application of this method in synthesis of polycyclic compounds.

         <title>Controlling the Formation of Electroactive Graphene&#8208;Based Cementitious Composites: Towards Structural Health Monitoring of Civil Structures</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multifunctional rGO&#8208;based cement composite featuring remarkably enhanced electrical properties was developed. Simple and efficient method for obtaining homogeneous and stable rGO dispersion in cement composites was established. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy was applied to investigate the conduction mechanisms within rGO&#8208;based cement mortar and new electrical equivalent circuit was proposed.







Abstract
The development of composites combining multiple components each one imparting a specific function to the ensemble is highly sought after for disruptive applications in chemistry and materials science, with a particular importance for the realization of smart structures. Here, we report on the development of an unprecedented multifunctional cementitious composite incorporating reduced graphene oxide (rGO). By design, this material features significantly enhanced electrical properties while retaining the excellent cement's hydration and microstructure. The multiscale investigation on the chemical and physical properties of the dispersion made it possible to establish an efficient preparation protocol for rGO aqueous dispersion as well as rGO&#8208;based cementitious composites using a commercial poly(carboxylate ether)&#8208;based superplasticizer. The conduction mechanisms within the matrix of rGO containing mortars were unraveled by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy revealing conductive paths originating from bulk cement matrix and rGO nanosheets in composites with rGO loadings as low as 0.075&#8197;wt.&#8201;%. For this rGO loading, we observed the reduction of the resistivity of bulk cement mortar layers from 18.3&#8197;M&#937;&#8201;cm to 2.8&#8197;M&#937;&#8201;cm. Moreover, the addition of 0.2&#8197;wt.&#8201;% of rGO resulted in the formation of rGO conductive paths with the resistivity of 51.1&#8197;k&#937;&#8201;cm. These findings represent a major step forward towards the practical application of graphene&#8208;based materials in structural health monitoring of concrete structures.

         <title>Boosting the Cell Performance of the SiO/Cu and SiO/PPy Anodes via In&#8208;Situ Reduction/Oxidation Coating Strategies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The SiO/Cu and SiO/PPy composites are prepared by in&#8208;situ reduction/oxidation of Cu2+ and Py on the discharged/charged SiO surface, respectively. Cu and ppy coating layer enhance the conductivity of composite and mitigate volume expansion, which significantly improves the electrochemical performance of the SiO anode.







Abstract
Silicon monoxide (SiO) has attracted great attention due to its high theoretical specific capacity as an alternative material for conventional graphite anode, but its poor electrical conductivity and irreversible side reactions at the SiO/electrolyte interface seriously reduce its cycling stability. Here, to overcome the drawbacks, the dicharged SiO anode coated with Cu coating layer is elaborately designed by in&#8208;situ reduction method. Compared with the pristine SiO anode of lithium&#8208;ion battery (293&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.5&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 200&#8197;cycles), the obtained SiO/Cu composite presents superior cycling stability (1206&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.5&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 200&#8197;cycles). The tight combination of Cu particles and SiO significantly improves the conductivity of the composite, effectively inhibits the side&#8208;reaction between the active material and electrolyte. In addition, polypyrrole&#8208;coated SiO composites are further prepared by in&#8208;situ oxidation method, which delivers a high reversible specific capacity of 1311&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.5&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 200&#8197;cycles. The in&#8208;situ coating strategies in this work provide a new pathway for the development and practical application of high&#8208;performance silicon&#8208;based anode.

         <title>Mechanistic Study on Selenium&#8208; and Sulfur&#8208;Mediated Isomerization of Hydroxamic Acids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of para&#8208;aminophenols, such as paracetamol, holds high interest in pharmaceutical applications. In this study, the mechanistic transformations involved in the selenium&#8208; and sulfur&#8208;mediated formation of these compounds from hydroxamic acid were investigated computationally. Calculations with density functional theory (DFT) methods and experimental studies reveal the formation of ortho&#8208;sulfoxide as a product of the sulfur&#8208;mediated reaction.







Abstract
An in&#8208;depth computational study reveals the intriguing mechanism of the recently reported isomerization of hydroxamic acids into para&#8208;aminophenols catalyzed by phenylselenyl bromide under mild conditions. The computations not only align with the reported experimental data, effectively explaining observed phenomena such as para&#8208;selectivity but also shed light on crucial aspects of the reaction mechanism that establish limitations on the scope of the studied rearrangement. Additionally, a joint theoretical/experimental study was performed to examine the potency of the phenylsulfenyl bromide to mediate the reaction under the same conditions.

The computations not only align with the reported experimental data, effectively explaining observed phenomena such as &lt;i&gt;para&lt;/i&gt;-selectivity but also shed light on crucial aspects of the reaction mechanism that establish limitations on the scope of the studied rearrangement. Additionally, a joint theoretical/experimental study was performed to examine the potency of the phenylsulfenyl bromide to mediate the reaction under the same conditions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Dual Strategies with Anion/Cation Co&#8208;Doping and Lithium Carbonate Coating to Enhance the Electrochemical Performance of Lithium&#8208;Rich Layered Oxides</title>

The lithium&#8208;rich layered oxides (LLOs, Li1.2Mn0.54Ni0.13Co0.13O2) were successfully prepared based on a dual modification strategy, by co doped with anions and cations and coated with lithium carbonate coating. It founds that modified LLOs possess excellent electrochemical performance.







Abstract
Lithium&#8208;rich layered oxides (LLOs, Li1.2Mn0.54Ni0.13Co0.13O2) are widely used as cathode materials for lithium&#8208;ion batteries due to its high specific capacity, high operating voltage and low cost. However, the LLOs are faced with rapid decay of charge/discharge capacity and voltage, as well as interface side reactions, which limit its electrochemical performance. Herein, the dual strategies of sulfite/sodium ion co&#8208;doping and lithium carbonate coating were used to improve it. It founds that modified LLOs achieve 88.74&#8201;% initial coulomb efficiency, 295.3&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 first turn discharge capacity, in addition to 216.9&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 1&#8197;C, and 87.23&#8201;% capacity retention after 100&#8197;cycles. Mechanism research indicated that the excellent electrochemical performance benefits from the doping of both Na+ and SO32&#8722;, and it could significantly reduce the migration energy barrier of Li+ and promote Li+ migration. Meanwhile, anion and cation are co&#8208;doped greatly reduces the band gap of LLOs and increase its electrical conductivity, and its binding effect on Li+ is weakened, making it easier for Li+ to shuttle through the material. In addition, the lithium carbonate coating significantly inhibits the occurrence of interfacial side reactions of LLOs. This work provides a theoretical basis and practical guidance for the further development of LLOs with higher electrochemical performance.

         <title>Highly Stable Perovskite Solar Cells Based on the Efficient Interaction between Pb2+ and Cyano Groups of 4&#8208;Aminophthalonitrile</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By using 4&#8208;APN to manage surface defects in perovskite film, highly stable perovskite solar cells have been achieved.







Abstract
Defects present on the top surface of perovskite films have a pronounced detrimental impact on the photovoltaic performance and stability of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Consequently, the development of effective defect passivation strategies has become key in enhancing both the power conversion efficiency (PCE) and stability of PSCs. In this study, a small molecule material, 4&#8208;Aminophthalonitrile (4&#8208;APN), was introduced as a means to mitigate surface defects within perovskite films. Obviously, 4&#8208;APN effectively passivates the defects at grain boundaries by combining cyano groups (&#8722;C&#8801;N) with Pb2+, significantly reducing the density of defect states, inhibiting non&#8208;radiative recombination at the interface, and promoting the charge transfer efficiency from the perovskite layer to the hole transport layer. The 4&#8208;APN modification led to a significant upswing in the PCE, while concurrently bolstering the overall device stability. Importantly, the devices on 4&#8208;APN as passivation additive exhibited negligible performance degradation aging for 1200&#8197;h.

         <title>A Three&#8208;Dimensional (3D) Framework of Freestanding Vanadium Nitride Nanowires for Dendrite&#8208;Free and Long Life&#8208;Span Lithium Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Freestanding vanadium nitride (VN) nanowires are established as Li host for Li metal anode. A lithiophilic Li3N interlayer is in&#8197;situ formed by the surface reaction between molten Li and VN. As a result, the VN&#8722;Li exhibits a dendrite&#8208;free morphology and significant improvements of the lifespan during cycling.







Abstract
Lithium (Li) metal is a promising anode candidate for high&#8208;energy&#8208;density batteries owing to its high theoretical capacity and low electrochemical potential. However, uneven Li nucleation, uncontrollable dendritic growth, infinite voltage change and even safety issues hinder its commercial application. Herein, a three&#8208;dimensional (3D) framework of freestanding vanadium nitride nanowires (VN NWs) is established as Li host for dendrite&#8208;free Li metal anode. A lithiophilic Li3N interlayer which in&#8197;situ formed by the surface reaction between molten Li and VN NWs is utilized to guide a uniform Li nucleation and deposition within the skeleton, as well as avoid the dendrite formation. Meanwhile, VN NWs can decrease local current density, homogenize Li&#8208;ion flux and accommodate volume fluctuations of the anode due to its 3D structure with high electron conductivity. Thus, the corresponding composite Li metal anode delivers a long&#8208;life span of 500&#8197;cycles (1000&#8197;h) at a current density of 0.5&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, and exhibits lower nucleation over&#8208;potential and voltage hysteresis at different current densities from 0.5~5&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in carbonate electrolyte. In conclusion, this work provides a new type of scaffold with both high electronic conductivity and excellent lithiophilicity for stable Li anodes.

         <title>Nitrogen Heterocycle Synthesis through Hydride Abstraction of Acyclic Carbamates and Related Species: Scope, Mechanism, Stereoselectivity, and Product Conformation Studies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Acyliminium ions and related species can be formed through hydride abstraction reactions that obviate the need for leaving group installation and avoid issues of unfavorable equilibria. This allows for the study of several previously unappreciated reactivity properties of these species in the context of cyclization reactions, including intermediate geometry, transition state conformation, stereoselectivity and product geometry.







Abstract
Acyliminium ions and related species are potent electrophiles that can be quite valuable in the synthesis of nitrogen&#8208;containing molecules. This manuscript describes a protocol to form these intermediates through hydride abstractions of easily accessible allylic carbamates, amides, and sulfonamides that avoids the reversibility that is possible in classical condensation&#8208;based routes. These intermediates are used in the preparation of a range of nitrogen&#8208;containing heterocycles, and in many cases high levels of stereocontrol are observed. Specifically areas of investigation include the impact of chemical structure on oxidation efficiency, the geometry of the intermediate iminium ions, the impact of a substrate stereocenter on stereocontrol, and an examination of transition state geometry.

     alt="Nitrogen Heterocycle Synthesis through Hydride Abstraction of Acyclic Carbamates and Related Species: Scope, Mechanism, Stereoselectivity, and Product Conformation Studies"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Acyliminium ions and related species&lt;/b&gt; can be formed through hydride abstraction reactions that obviate the need for leaving group installation and avoid issues of unfavorable equilibria. This allows for the study of several previously unappreciated reactivity properties of these species in the context of cyclization reactions, including intermediate geometry, transition state conformation, stereoselectivity and product geometry.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acyliminium ions and related species are potent electrophiles that can be quite valuable in the synthesis of nitrogen-containing molecules. This manuscript describes a protocol to form these intermediates through hydride abstractions of easily accessible allylic carbamates, amides, and sulfonamides that avoids the reversibility that is possible in classical condensation-based routes. These intermediates are used in the preparation of a range of nitrogen-containing heterocycles, and in many cases high levels of stereocontrol are observed. Specifically areas of investigation include the impact of chemical structure on oxidation efficiency, the geometry of the intermediate iminium ions, the impact of a substrate stereocenter on stereocontrol, and an examination of transition state geometry.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Resolution of Expanded Porphyrinoids: A Path to Persistent Chirality and Appealing Chiroptical Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review provides a summary of strategies for achieving the chiral resolution of expanded porphyrinoids. In many cases, the isolated enantiomers display unique chiroptical properties, features that reflect their extensive &#960;&#8208;electron conjugation pathways and unique metal complexation features. As a class, expanded porphyrinoids are expected to play a crucial role in the future production of chiral functional materials.







Abstract
Chirality is a fundamental characteristic of nature. Expanded porphyrinoids and their analogues offer an attractive platform for delving into the intricacies of chirality. Expanded porphyrinoids comprise pyrrolic macrocycles and related heterocyclic systems. As a class, expanded porphyrinoids are widely recognized for their flexible structural features, nontrivial coordination capabilities, and intriguing optical and electronic properties. With limited exceptions, their inherent conformational flexibility coupled with a low racemization barrier allows for the facile interchange between enantiomers. As a result, achieving the effective chiral resolution of individual enantiomers and the subsequent exploration of their chiroptical properties represents a significant challenge. This review summarizes strategies used to realize the chiral resolution of expanded porphyrinoids and the understanding of intrinsic chiroptical properties that has emerged from these separation efforts. It is our hope that this review will serve not only to codify our current understanding of chiral expanded porphyrinoids, but also inspire advances in the generalized area of chiral functional materials.

         <title>Fabrication of High Surface Area Fe/Fe3O4 with Enhanced Performance for Electrocatalytic Nitrogen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel specific surface area and interconnected pores Fe/Fe3O4/PC composite is fabricated by a simple template method. The as&#8208;synthesized material possessing high electrochemically active surface area promote the occurrence of catalytic kinetics, therefore affording super electrocatalytic nitrogen reduction performance.







Abstract
The development of high&#8208;efficient and large&#8208;scale non&#8208;precious electrocatalysts to improve sluggish reaction kinetics plays a key role in enhancing electrocatalytic nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) for ammonia production under mild condition. Herein, Fe3O4 and Fe supported by porous carbon (denoted as Fe/Fe3O4/PC&#8208;800) composite with a high specific surface area of 1004.1&#8197;m2&#8201;g&#8722;1 was prepared via a simple template method. On one hand, the high surface area of Fe/Fe3O4/PC&#8208;800 provides a large area to enhance N2 adsorption and promote more protons and electrons to accelerate the reaction, thereby greatly improving the dynamics. On the other hand, mesoporous Fe/Fe3O4/PC&#8208;800 provides high electrochemically active surface area for promoting the occurrence of catalytic kinetics. As a result, Fe/Fe3O4/PC&#8208;800 exhibited significantly enhanced NRR performance with an ammonia yield of 31.15&#8197;&#956;g&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;mg&#8722;1cat. and faraday efficiency of 22.26&#8201;% at &#8722;0.1&#8197;V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE). This study is expected to provide a new strategy for the synthesis of catalysts with large specific area and pave the way for the foundational research in NRR.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through dearomative spirocyclization of a furan and N&#8208;tosylhydrazone with palladium catalysis, concise syntheses of cephalotaxus alkaloids, fortuneicyclidins A and B, and cephalotine&#8197;B have been accomplished. These natural products have a highly fused polycyclic skeleton including an azaspirocycle. By orchestrating the dearomative azaspirocyclization and a tandem reaction to construct the main skeleton, these natural products can be reached in only eight or nine steps. More information can be found in the Research Article by Y. Uwabe, K. Muto and J. Yamaguchi (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202302769).

         <title>Heterobimetallic Complexes Bridged by an Unsymmetrical Bis(NHC) Ligand: Study of Enhanced Catalytic Activity in Tandem Transformations and Understanding of Cooperativity between the Metal Centers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The selective sequential metalation of a bis(NHC) ligand yielded the heterobimetallic complexes IrIII&#8722;M (M=PdII/AuI); these heterobimetallic catalysts exhibit clear advantages in various one&#8208;pot tandem catalytic reactions over the equivalent catalytic systems containing either the homobimetallic IrIII and PdII catalysts or the monometallic analogs. This superior activity could be correlated to a better communication/cooperativity between the two different metal centers as validated by NMR, electrochemical, and theoretical studies. More information can be found in the Research Article by A. Rit and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202302180).

         <title>Total Synthesis of Cyanobactin Natural Product Balgacyclamide B</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Balgacyclamide A&#8208;C are a family of cyanobactin natural products isolated from freshwater cyanobacteria&#160;Microcystis aeruginosa. These macrocyclic peptides are characterized by their oxazoline&#8208;thiazole core, their 7 or 8 stereocenters, and their antiparasitic activities. Balgacyclamide B is known for its activity towards&#160;Plasmodium falciparum&#160;chloroquine&#8208;resistant strain K1,&#160;Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense,&#160;and&#160;Leishmania donovani. In this report, the first total synthesis of Balgacyclamide B is described in a 17&#8208;steps pathway and a 2% overall yield. The synthetic pathway toward balgacyclamide B can be adapted for the future syntheses of balgacyclamide A and C. In addition, a brief history background of oxazolines syntheses is shown to emphasize the importance of the cyclization conditions used to interconvert or retain configuration of&#160;b&#8208;hydroxy amides via dehydrative cyclization.</dc:description>

         <title>Organophotocatalyzed Alkyl/Arylsulfonylation of Vinylcyclopropanes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Allyl sulfones are an essential pharmacophore in many bioactive compounds. To combat their synthetic barrier, we report a practical, straightforward organophotocatalyzed&#160;methodology for accessing miscellaneously functionalized allyl sulfone derivatives using inexpensive and bench&#8208;stable sodium sulfinate salts under mild conditions. This photo&#8208;catalyzed radical sulfonylation provides access to a variety of allyl sulfones in good to excellent yields with high E:Z selectivity. A wide range of vinyl cyclopropanes, as well as aryl/hetero and alkyl sodium sulfinates, were tolerated and reliable in gram&#8208;scale synthesis. Later on, further functionalization of allyl sulfones was demonstrated. A plausible mechanism is proposed for radical sulfonylation with the control experiments.</dc:description>

         <title>New Multifunctional Bipyrimidine&#8208;Based Chromophores for NLO Active Thin&#8208;Film Preparation.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>New synthesized bipyrimidine&#8208;based chromophores presenting alkoxystyryl donor groups carrying aliphatic achiral and chiral chains in the 4 position, connected to electron&#8208;accepting 2,2&#8208;bipyrimidine cores have been synthesized. Their linear and nonlinear optical properties were investigated as well as their mesomorphic properties by various techniques (light&#8208;transmission measurements, polarized&#8208;light optical microscopy, differential scanning calorimetry measurements and two&#8208;photon excited fluorescence). &#160;The derivatives with achiral linear carbon chains were found to exhibit liquid&#8208;crystal properties with the formation smectic phases over large temperature ranges which were confirmed by small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering analysis via stacking models. The nonlinear optical properties in the solid state for derivatives with C14 and the citronellol chains have been studied by wide&#8208;field second&#8208;harmonic generation and multi&#8208;photon fluorescence imaging, confirming centrosymmetry for these achiral mesogens and their excellent third&#8208;order nonlinearity whereas the chiral compound exhibits non&#8208;centrosymmetric organization resulting in a strong Second Harmonic Generation at the crystal state.</dc:description>

         <title>Reductive Release from a Hybrid PKS&#8208;NRPS during the Biosynthesis of Pyrichalasin H</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Three central steps during the biosynthesis of cytochalasan precursors, including reductive release, Knoevenagel cyclisation and Diels Alder cyclisation are not yet understood at a detailed molecular level. In this work we investigated the reductive release step catalysed by a hybrid polyketide synthase non&#8208;ribosomal peptide synthetase (PKS&#8208;NRPS) from the pyrichalasin H pathway. Synthetic thiolesters were used as substrate mimics for in vitro studies with the isolated reduction (R) and holo&#8208;thiolation (T) domains of the PKS&#8208;NRPS hybrid PyiS. These assays demonstrate that the PyiS R&#8208;domain mainly catalyses an NADPH&#8208;dependent reductive release of an aldehyde intermediate that quickly undergoes spontaneous Knoevenagel cyclisation. The R&#8208;domain can only process substrates that are covalently bound to the phosphopantetheine thiol of the upstream T&#8208;domain, but it shows little selectivity for the polyketide.</dc:description>

         <title>Tunable Metal&#8208;free Imidazole&#8208;Benzimidazole Electrocatalysts for Oxygen Reduction in Aqueous Solutions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A series of metal&#8208;free imidazole&#8208;benzimidazole catalysts (ImBenz&#8208;H, ImBenz&#8208;NO2, ImBenz&#8208;OCH3) for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) were prepared. We demonstrate that the electrocatalytic O2 reduction by ImBenz&#8208;NO2 with the electron&#8208;withdrawing group showed high selectivity toward H2O with the number of electrons transferred (n = 3.7) in a neutral aqueous solution. The highest ORR selectivity toward H2O2 was achieved using ImBenz&#8208;H (n = 2.4) in an alkaline solution. Electrochemical studies of reaction kinetics disclosed that the highest turnover frequencies were obtained from ImBenz&#8208;H in both neutral and alkaline aqueous solutions. The results prove that the ORR selectivity is tunable by modulating the substituent of the ImBenz catalysts. Furthermore, DFT calculations suggested that the ORR mechanism of ImBenz&#8208;H involves the electron transfer from imidazole&#8208;benzimidazole to O2 resulting in the formation of H2O2 which supports the redox active properties of the catalysts ImBenz.</dc:description>

         <title>Colloidal and Thermal Stability of Three&#8208;Component Hybrid Materials containing Clay Mineral, Polysaccharide and Surfactant</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The paper presents the colloidal and thermal stability of the three&#8208;component hybrid materials containing halloysite, polysaccharides (alginic acid, cationic cellulose and hydroxyethyl cellulose) and Tritons. TX&#8208;100, TX&#8208;165 and TX&#8208;405 were used as non&#8208;ionic surfactants. Stability and other properties of the hybrid materials were tested by the following methods: UV&#8208;Vis, TGA (thermogravimetric analysis) and DSC (differential scanning calorimetry), CHN (elemental analysis), SEM&#8208;EDX (scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive X&#8208;Ray spectroscopy) and tensiometry. According to the results with the increasing polymer concentration the colloidal stability of the tested systems also increases. Moreover, the addition of the surfactants causes the increase of polysaccharide adsorption but the colloidal stability of the tested systems decreases due to large weights of formed aggregates. As follows from the thermal analysis, the comparison of the TG/DTG&#8208;DSC curves obtained for the investigated polymers confirms that their thermal decomposition courses have some common features. The obtained results have the application potential in the formation of the materials for the pollutants removal from water and sewages.</dc:description>

         <title>The Diversity of Cucurbituril Molecular Switches and Shuttles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The enriching shuttling of cucurbiturils. The number and complexity of supramolecular systems featured by cucurbituril macrocycles shuttling over other molecules do not cease to increase. This concept article discusses the recent advances in the field and proposes challenges to tackle.







Abstract
Ring translocation switches and shuttles featuring a macrocycle (or a ring molecule) navigating between two or more stations continue to attract attention. While the vast majority of these systems are developed in organic solvents, the cucurbituril (CB) macrocycles are ideally suited to prepare such systems in water. Indeed, their stability and their relatively high affinity for relevant guest molecules are key attributes toward translating the progresses made in organic solvents, into water. This concept article summarizes the findings, key advances and multiple possibilities offered by CBs toward advanced molecular switches and shuttles in water.

         <title>Understanding the Electronic Structure of Magnetic Trinuclear Complexes Based on the Tris&#8208;dioxolene Triphenylene Non&#8208;innocent Bridging Ligand, a Theoretical Study</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A complete theoretical analysis using first the simple H&#252;ckel model followed by more sophisticated multi&#8208;reference calculations on a trinuclear Ni(II) complex (Tp#Ni3HHTP), bearing the non&#8208;innocent bridging ligand HHTP3&#8208;, is carried out. The three semiquinone moieties of HHTP3&#8208;&#160;couple antiferromagnetically and lead to a single unpaired electron localized on one of the moieties. The calculated exchange coupling integrals together with the zero&#8208;field parameters allow, when varied within a certain range, reproducing the experimental data. These results are generalized for two similar other trinuclear complexes containing Ni(II) and Cu(II). The electronic structure of HHTP3&#8208;&#160;turns out to be independent of both the chemical nature and the geometry of the metal ions. We also establish a direct correlation between the geometrical and the electronic structures of the non&#8208;innocent ligand that is consistent with the results of calculations. It allows experimentalists to get insight into the magnetic behavior of this type of complexes by an analysis of their X&#8208;ray structure.</dc:description>

We also establish a direct correlation between the geometrical and the electronic structures of the non-innocent ligand that is consistent with the results of calculations. It allows experimentalists to get insight into the magnetic behavior of this type of complexes by an analysis of their X-ray structure.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Metal&#8208;Free Molecular Ferroelectric [4&#8208;Me&#8208;cyclohexylamine]ClO4 Introduced by Boat and Chair Conformations of Cyclohexylamine</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic ferroelectrics have received a great deal of interest due to their exclusive&#160;properties. However, organic ferroelectrics have not been fully explored, which hinders their practical application. Here, we presented a novel metal&#8208;free organic molecular ferroelectric [4&#8208;MCHA][ClO4] (1) (4&#8208;MCHA = trans&#8208;4&#8208;methylcyclohexylamine), which exhibits an above&#8208;room&#8208;temperature of 328 K. Strikingly, the crystal structure analysis of 1 shows that the driving force of phase transition is related to the interesting chair&#8208;boat conformation change of 4&#8208;MCHA cation, in addition to&#160; the order&#8208;disorder transition. Using piezoelectric response force microscopy (PFM), the presence of domains and the implemented polarization switching was clearly observed, which explicitly determined the presence of room&#8208;temperature ferroelectricity of 1. As far as we know, the ferroelectric phase transition mechanism attributed to the conformational change in a trans isomeric cation is very rare. This research enriched the path of designing ferroelectric materials and smart materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Simulating non&#8208;adiabatic dynamics of photoexcited phenyl azide: Investigating electronic and structural relaxation en route to the formation of phenyl nitrene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Excited state molecular dynamics simulations of the photoexcited phenyl azide have been performed. The semi&#8208;classical surface hopping approximation has enabled an unconstrained analysis of the electronic and nuclear degrees of freedom which contribute to the molecular dissociation of phenyl azide into phenyl nitrene and molecular nitrogen. The significance of the second singlet excited state in leading the photodissociation has been established through electronic structure calculations, based on multiconfigurational schemes, and state population dynamics. The investigations on the structural dynamics have revealed the N &#8722; N bond separation to be accompanied by synchronous changes in the azide N &#8722; N &#8722; N bond angle. The 100 fs simulation results in a nitrene fragment that is electronically excited in the singlet manifold.</dc:description>

         <title>Tuneable Plasmonic Resonances Of A Dynamic Thin Film Of Ultrasmall Nanocrystals Modified In the Anti&#8208;Galvanic Reduction Process</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unprecedented plasmonic enhancement in ultra&#8208;small gold nanoparticles modified with Anti&#8208;Galvanic Reduction gives access to new type pseudo liquid&#8208;crystalline nanoparticles. Thermoswitchable structure and induced plasmonic properties provide a general and straightforward access to a variety of a new type of plasmonic materials based on small gold nanoparticles.







Abstract
Ultrasmall gold nanoparticles (NPs) have revolutionized nanotechnology as they are an excellent starting substrate for the synthesis of organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid materials with photonic or energy conversion applications, often with a responsive nature. However, ultrasmall NPs do not sustain plasmonic resonances, preventing their use in plasmon&#8208;related applications. In the presented work, we show a method of chemical modification of ultrasmall gold nanoparticles in order to fabricate dynamically controlled plasmonic thin films. For this purpose, we used the Anti&#8208;Galvanic Reduction process (AGR) to modify the surface of small gold nanoparticles, inducing plasmonic properties without notable size increases. Au@Ag NPs are then modified with liquid crystal&#8208;like organic ligands. The obtained NPs can assemble into densely packed films with long&#8208;range order and temperature&#8208;dependent structural properties. Namely, we detect two, fully reversible phase transitions between the hexagonal and cubic symmetries. The combination of AGR and organic surface modifications enabled us to demonstrate the possibility of managing plasmonic properties in the thin film of ~2&#8197;nm diameter metallic NPs.

         <title>Catalytic Asymmetric Synthesis of N&#8722;N Biaryl Atropisomers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Although N&#8722;N Biaryl atropisomers has emerged into valuable scaffolds in natural products, drug design and asymmetric synthesis, its asymmetric synthesis is scare until recently. This concept will focus on the asymmetric synthesis of the divergent N&#8722;N biaryl atropisomers scaffolds including N&#8722;N bipyrroles atropisomers, N&#8722;N pyrrole&#8722;indole atropisomers, N&#8722;N bisindoles atropisomers, N&#8722;N indole&#8722;carbazole atropisomers.







Abstract
Atropisomers have emerged as important structural scaffolds in natural products, drug design, and asymmetric synthesis. Recently, N&#8722;N biaryl atropisomers have drawn increasing interest due to their unique structure and relatively stable axes. However, its asymmetric synthesis remains scarce compared to its well&#8208;developed C&#8722;C biaryl analogs. In this concept, we summarize the asymmetric synthesis of N&#8722;N biaryl atropisomers including N&#8722;N pyrrole&#8722;pyrrole, N&#8722;N pyrrole&#8722;indole, N&#8722;N indole&#8722;indole, and N&#8722;N indole&#8722;carbazole, during which a series synthetic strategies are highlighted. Also, a synthetic evolution is briefly reviewed and an outlook of N&#8722;N biaryl atropisomers synthesis is offered.

         <title>Synthesis of the A&#8722;F Fragment of the Pacific Ciguatoxin CTX3C by Iterative Ring&#8208;Closing Metathesis and Tsuji&#8211;Trost Allylation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The fully functionalized A&#8722;F ring system of the Pacific ciguatoxin CTX3C suitable for coupling to the I&#8722;M fragment of the natural product, has been synthesized from a simple glucal derivative. A six&#8208;step sequence that features ring&#8208;closing metathesis and stereoselective palladium&#8208;mediated allylation has been deployed in an iterative manner to construct the medium&#8208;sized D and E rings.







Abstract
The fully functionalized A&#8722;F fragment of the Pacific ciguatoxin CTX3C has been synthesized from a derivative of D&#8208;glucal, which serves as the B&#8208;ring. Rings A and C were introduced to either side of ring B by ring&#8208;closing diene and enyne metathesis (RCM). The seven&#8208;membered D&#8208;ring and eight&#8208;membered E&#8208;ring were assembled by iterative use of a six&#8208;step reaction sequence in which RCM was used for ring construction and Tsuji&#8211;Trost allylation was employed for subsequent stereoselective functionalization. The nine&#8208;membered F&#8208;ring was formed by use of an RCM reaction and bears the functionality required for attachment of the I&#8722;M fragment and subsequent closure of rings G and H.

         <title>Multigram Synthesis of Dimethyl Stellane&#8208;1,5&#8208;Dicarboxylate as a Key Precursor for ortho&#8208;Benzene Mimics
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
From a new C(sp3)&#8208;rich hydrocarbon cage, a potential ortho&#8208;substituted benzene analogue (bioisoster), up to 50&#8197;g of tricyclo[3.3.0.03,7]octane (stellane) 1,5&#8208;dicarboxylic acid derivatives can be produced in one run. The outcome of the synthesis hinges on the substrate's stereochemistry. While the endo,endo DMOD isomer only undergoes epimerization in the reaction conditions, others yield the sought&#8208;after stellane ester. X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis shows stellane 1,5&#8208;dicarboxylic acid dimethyl ester as an ideal saturated alternative for ortho&#8208;disubstituted benzene with in&#8208;plane topology.

Herein, we present previously unavailable C(sp3)&#8208;rich polycyclic hydrocarbon scaffolds that have the potential to become valuable tools in medicinal chemistry and crop science as saturated bioisosteres of benzenoids. We have developed a scalable protocol (up to 50&#8197;g from a single synthetic run) for the synthesis of tricyclo[3.3.0.03,7]octane (bisnoradamantane or stellane) 1,5&#8208;dicarboxylic acid derivatives. X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis of the stellane 1,5&#8208;dicarboxylic acid dimethyl ester has revealed that this scaffold is an optimal saturated isostere for ortho&#8208;disubstituted benzene where substituents exhibit in&#8208;plane topology. The synthetic protocol is based on the oxidative cyclization of dimethyl octahydropentalene&#8208;2,5&#8208;dicarboxylate (DMOD) through lithiation followed by I2 oxidation. The reaction outcome is determined by the stereochemistry of the substrate. While the endo,endo cis&#8208;DMOD, exclusively gives the &#8220;unwanted&#8221; Claisen cyclization product, the exo,endo cis&#8208; and exo,exo cis&#8208; stereoisomers afford the desired stellane 1,5&#8208;dicarboxylic acid dimethyl ester quantitatively. DFT computations have revealed that the reaction proceeds via the dianion of dimethyl octahydropentalene&#8208;2,5&#8208;dicarboxylate, which undergoes SET oxidation by I2 to form a radical anion. The subsequent cyclization followed by a second SET oxidation gives the desired stellane derivative.

&lt;p&gt;From a new C(sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)-rich hydrocarbon cage, a potential &lt;i&gt;ortho&lt;/i&gt;-substituted benzene analogue (bioisoster), up to 50&#8197;g of tricyclo[3.3.0.0&lt;sup&gt;3,7&lt;/sup&gt;]octane (stellane) 1,5-dicarboxylic acid derivatives can be produced in one run. The outcome of the synthesis hinges on the substrate's stereochemistry. While the &lt;i&gt;endo,endo&lt;/i&gt; DMOD isomer only undergoes epimerization in the reaction conditions, others yield the sought-after stellane ester. X-ray diffraction analysis shows stellane 1,5-dicarboxylic acid dimethyl ester as an ideal saturated alternative for &lt;i&gt;ortho&lt;/i&gt;-disubstituted benzene with in-plane topology.

         <title>Pillar[5]arene&#8208;Based Fluorescent Supramolecular Polymers Without Conventional Chromophores</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel fluorescent supramolecular polymer without conventional chromophores have been reported.







Abstract
Fluorescent supramolecular polymers have garnered significant attention due to their successful integration of supramolecular polymers and fluorescence, offering vast potential for applications in sensing, imaging, optoelectronics, and photonics. In this study, we present a novel supramolecular polymer based on P5&#8208;OH, derived from mono&#8208;substituted pillararene macrocycles. Notably, these formed supramolecular polymeric aggregates exhibit a prominent blue emission, representing a rare instance of fluorescent polymers devoid of conventional chromophores. Furthermore, through the modification of alkyl chain ending groups attached to pillar[5]arenes, slight shifts in the emission peak could be observed. This research expands the scope of functional supramolecular polymeric systems utilizing pillararenes, providing valuable insights for the design of innovative luminescent materials and optical devices.

         <title>Dyads and Triads of Boron Difluoride Formazanate and Boron Difluoride Dipyrromethene Dyes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first examples of BF2 formazanate and BODIPY conjugates: Dyads and triads of BF2 formazanate and BODIPY dyes undergo reversible reduction to polyanions and exhibit anti&#8208;Kasha photoluminescence. These properties arise from the interplay of the discrete properties of each dye and highlight the promise of dye&#8208;dye conjugates based on BF2 formazanates.







Abstract
Dye&#8208;dye conjugates have attracted significant interest for their utility in applications such as bioimaging, theranostics, and light&#8208;harvesting. Many classes of organic dyes have been employed in this regard; however, building blocks don't typically extend beyond small chromophores. This can lead to minor changes to the optoelectronic properties of the original dye. The exploration of dye&#8211;dye structures is impeded by long synthetic routes, incompatible synthetic conditions, or a mismatch of the desired properties. Here, we present the first&#8208;of&#8208;their&#8208;kind dye&#8208;dye conjugates of boron difluoride complexes of formazanate and dipyrromethene ligands. These conjugates exhibit dual photoluminescence bands that reach the near&#8208;infrared spectral region and implicate anti&#8208;Kasha processes. Cyclic voltammetry experiments revealed the generation of polyanionic species that can reversibly tolerate the uptake of up to 6 electrons. Ultimately, we demonstrate that BF2 formazanates can serve as a synthetically accessible platform to build upon new classes of dye&#8208;dye conjugates.

         <title>Dioxygen Activation and Reduction by a Soluble Iron Phthalocyanine</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Catalytic Oxygen activation by square planar iron. A well soluble phthalocyanine derivative stabilizes a square planar Fe2+ centre with S=1 paramagnetism. The bulky substituents prevent the formation of aggregates while leaving a large cavity at the metal for stoichiometric and catalytic reactions. The compound can be used as a molecular model for studying dioxygen reduction and catalytic oxygenation.







Abstract
Iron ions in a square&#8208;planar coordination can bind molecules at the vacant axial positions and are able to transform them in stoichiometric and catalytic reactions. Nature takes advantage of these properties by incorporating iron into porphyrin systems, which play a key role not only in the binding and transport of oxygen, but also in catalytic oxidation and reduction reactions involving cytochrome P450. Although these systems have been studied extensively, there are still unresolved questions regarding the interplay between the iron ions and the surrounding ligands. Phthalocyanines (Pc) create a similar environment for metal atoms and FePc is known for a long time. However, without axial ligands FePc aggregates leading to solids of low solubility. In this work we used a known six&#8208;coordinate iron phthalocyanine derivative with bulky substituents and removed the stabilizing axial ligands. The resulting paramagnetic, four&#8208;coordinate compound does not aggregate and dissolves well so that NMR spectroscopy can be employed for studying the molecular structure and the reactivity. Solvent molecules bind weakly to the iron centers and oxygen is reduced in the presence of H&#8208;atom donors. The stoichiometric and catalytic reactivity with oxygen was studied in more detail.

         <title>Reactive Reductive Species Participating Photodynamic Therapy for Cancer Treatment</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reductive phototherapy takes advantage of endogenous substances such as GSH and NADH to drive photoredox catalysis and produce reactive reductive species (RRS) for antioxidant defense. The basic concept on RRSs (e.&#8201;g., H&#8901; and electrons) participating in reductive photodynamic therapy (R&#8208;PDT) holds great potential in fighting cancers under extremely hypoxic conditions.







Abstract
Although the development of oxidative photodynamic therapy (O&#8208;PDT) based on reactive oxygen species (ROS) has led to great progress in cancer treatment, tumor hypoxia, cellular adaptation and intrinsic antioxidant defenses are still obstacles at this stage. Fortunately, with the discovery and development of reactive reductive species (RRS) in the PDT process, reductive PDT (R&#8208;PDT) is receiving increasing research interest. R&#8208;PDT with oxygen&#8208;independence is an effective reduction therapy that promises excellent therapeutic efficacy in extremely hypoxic or even anaerobic environments. In the concept, we introduce representative strategies to boost the type&#8208;I photosensitizing pathway, and then focus on the most recent R&#8208;PDT involving hydrogen radical (H&#8901;) and the single electron transfer (SET) process.

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Electrocatalyzed Synthesis of Bifuran&#8208;Based Monomers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nickel&#8208;electrocatalyzed homocoupling is applied to the preparation of bifuran&#8208;based monomers from methyl bromo&#8208;furancarboxylates that can be prepared from hemicellulose&#8208;based furfural. The protocol is run with graphite electrodes in an undivided cell, and the products are isolated by precipitation.







Abstract
Bifuran motifs can be accessed with nickel&#8208;bipyridine electrocatalyzed homocouplings of bromine&#8208;substituted methyl furancarboxylates, which, in turn, can be prepared from hemicellulose&#8208;derived furfural. The described protocol uses sustainable carbon&#8208;based graphite electrodes in the simplest setup &#8211; an undivided cell with constant current electrolysis.

     alt="Nickel-Electrocatalyzed Synthesis of Bifuran-Based Monomers"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Nickel-electrocatalyzed homocoupling&lt;/b&gt; is applied to the preparation of bifuran-based monomers from methyl bromo-furancarboxylates that can be prepared from hemicellulose-based furfural. The protocol is run with graphite electrodes in an undivided cell, and the products are isolated by precipitation.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bifuran motifs can be accessed with nickel-bipyridine electrocatalyzed homocouplings of bromine-substituted methyl furancarboxylates, which, in turn, can be prepared from hemicellulose-derived furfural. The described protocol uses sustainable carbon-based graphite electrodes in the simplest setup &#8211; an undivided cell with constant current electrolysis. The reported method avoids using a sacrificial anode by employing triethanolamine as an electron donor.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Alcohol&#8208;Induced Conformation Changes and Thermodynamic Signatures in the Binding of Polyphenols to Proline&#8208;Rich Salivary Proteins</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first contact of polyphenols, such as tannins from red grapes, with the human body takes place in the mouth, where they interact with salivary proteins. These interactions are important at the sensory level, especially for the development of astringency. We have studied the binding process of the polyphenol ellagic acid to different salivary proteins. The presence of 10&#8197;vol.&#8201;% EtOH, as found in wines, dramatically increases the binding constant of ellagic acid with salivary proteins; this can be attributed to the effect of EtOH on the conformational dynamics and hydration of the proteins. More information can be found in the Research Article by N. Jahmidi&#8208;Azizi, R. Oliva and R. Winter (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202302384).

         <title>Disulfide&#8208;Driven Pore Functionalization of Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 61, November 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new post&#8208;synthetic modification strategy for metal&#8211;organic frameworks is presented. Diverse functional groups are installed within an analogue of MIL&#8208;53(Al) via disulfide bonds.







Abstract
Post&#8208;synthetic modification (PSM) imparts additional functionality to metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) that is often difficult to access using solvothermal synthesis. As such, expanding the repertory of PSM reactions available to the practitioner is of increased importance for the generation of materials tailored for desired applications. Herein, a method is described for the protecting group&#8208;free installation of diverse functional groups within the pores of a MIL&#8208;53(Al) analogue via disulfide bond formation. The majority of the reactions proceed with thiol&#8208;to&#8208;disulfide conversions ranging from high to nearly quantitative. The disulfide bonds are stable in various solvents and can be cleaved in the presence of a reducing agent.

         <title>Re&#8208;Thinking Dimer Design Principles with Indolonaphthyridine Intramolecular Singlet Fission</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 61, November 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The intramolecular singlet fission (i&#8208;SF) mechanism of INDT dimers linked via para&#8208;phenyl, meta&#8208;phenyl and fluorene bridging groups is investigated. Using ultra&#8208;fast spectroscopy the highest rate of singlet fission is found in the para&#8208;phenyl linked dimer. The mechanistic picture of polarisable singlet fission materials, such as INDT, extends beyond the traditional mechanistic landscape.







Abstract
Singlet fission is a phenomenon that could significantly improve the efficiency of photovoltaic devices. Indolonaphthyridine thiophene (INDT) is a photostable singlet fission material that could potentially be utilised in singlet fission&#8208;based photovoltaic devices. This study investigates the intramolecular singlet fission (i&#8208;SF) mechanism of INDT dimers linked via para&#8208;phenyl, meta&#8208;phenyl and fluorene bridging groups. Using ultra&#8208;fast spectroscopy the highest rate of singlet fission is found in the para&#8208;phenyl linked dimer. Quantum calculations show the para&#8208;phenyl linker encourages enhanced monomer electronic coupling. Increased rates of singlet fission were also observed in the higher polarity o&#8208;dichlorobenzene, relative to toluene, indicating that charge&#8208;transfer states have a role in mediating the process. The mechanistic picture of polarisable singlet fission materials, such as INDT, extends beyond the traditional mechanistic landscape.

         <title>Chiroptical Recognition of Carboxylates with Charge&#8208;Neutral Double&#8208;Stranded Zinc(II) Helicates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 61, November 2, 2023. </description>

Isomer truel &#8208; The guest calls out the winner. The dynamic interconversion of a neutral metal&#8208;based container&#8208;like helicate enables chiroptical recognition of chiral mono&#8208; and dicarboxylates by CD spectroscopy. Efficient guest recognition paired with an optimal chiral information transfer resulting from a coordinative binding mode allows the usage of the receptor for chirality analysis.







Abstract
Chirality analysis of small molecules for the determination of their enantiopurity is nowadays ruled by streamlined chromatographic methods which utilize chiral stationary phases. Chiroptical probes which rely on host&#8211;guest interactions are so far overshadowed by the latter but have the benefit of depending only on common spectroscopic techniques such as CD spectroscopy to distinguish enantiomers and to quantify their ratio. Interest into this receptor&#8208;based approach is constantly rising because non&#8208;invasive high&#8208;throughput screenings with a minimal waste production can be performed. In this study we investigate the possibility to utilize metal&#8208;based containers in form of charge&#8208;neutral helicates able to recognize anions for this purpose. Key building block of the helicates are triazole units which show rotational freedom and give rise to either a meso&#8208;structure or a racemic mixture of the right&#8208; and left&#8208;handed complex. A chiroptical response of the probe is observed upon recognition of chiral mono&#8208; or dicarboxylates and chirality analysis of tartrate is conducted by CD spectroscopy.

Dancing hybridization: The first example of efficient and stereoselective (E)&#8208;1,3&#8208;enyne synthesis exclusively from alkene substrates is described. Inauguration of nitro group as a sacrificial directing group, formation of magical triple bond by promoting zero&#8208;order to third&#8208;order upgradation make this methodology atom and step efficient with sustainability.







Abstract
The involvement of nitroalkenes instead of minimal one alkyne motif for (E)&#8208;1,3&#8208;enynes synthesis through a palladium catalyzed stereoselective bond forming pathway at room temperature is presented. Implication of nitro group as a sacrificial directing group, formation of magical alkyne on a newly developed Csp3&#8208;Csp3 bond with initial palladium&#8208;MBH adduct make this methodology distinctive. This protocol features an unprecedented sequential acetate addition, carbon&#8208;carbon bond formation, isomerization of double bond and nitromethane degradation in a tandem catalytic walk via dancing hybridization. Mechanistic understanding through identification of intermediates and computational calculations furnishes complete insight into the tandem catalytic pathway. Broad substrates scope and functional groups tolerance make this synthetic methodology magnificent and dynamic. This represents the first example of stereoselective 1,3&#8208;enyne synthesis exclusively from alkene substrates by introducing the concept of sacrificial directing group.

         <title>Reduced Tiara&#8208;like Palladium Complex for Suzuki Cross&#8208;Coupling Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 61, November 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study describes the development of a highly active and reusable palladium&#8208;based catalyst on alumina (Pd8/Al2O3) derived from an octanuclear tiara&#8208;like palladium complex and exploited for Suzuki coupling reactions. The high specific activity of the catalyst allowed to complete the coupling reaction in 30&#8197;min using only 0.12&#8197;mol&#8201;% Pd loading under very mild and green reaction conditions.







Abstract
The design of highly active and structurally well&#8208;defined catalysts has become a crucial issue for heterogeneous catalysed reactions while reducing the amount of catalyst employed. Beside conventional synthetic routes, the employment of polynuclear transition metal complexes as catalysts or catalyst precursors has progressively intercepted a growing interest. These well&#8208;defined species promise to deliver catalytic systems where a strict control on the nuclearity allows to improve the catalytic performance while reducing the active phase loading. This study describes the development of a highly active and reusable palladium&#8208;based catalyst on alumina (Pd8/Al2O3) for Suzuki cross&#8208;coupling reactions. An octanuclear tiara&#8208;like palladium complex was selected as active phase precursor to give isolated Pd&#8208;clusters of ca. 1&#8197;nm in size on Al2O3. The catalyst was thoroughly characterised by several complementary techniques to assess its structural and chemical nature. The high specific activity of the catalyst has allowed to carry out the cross&#8208;coupling reaction in 30&#8197;min using only 0.12&#8197;mol&#8201;% of Pd loading under very mild and green reaction conditions. Screening of various substrates and selectivity tests, combined with recycling and benchmarking experiments, have been used to highlight the great potentialities of this new Pd8/Al2O3 catalyst.

         <title>Ru(II)&#8208;Cyanine Complexes as Promising Photodynamic Photosensitizers for the Treatment of Hypoxic Tumours with Highly Penetrating 770&#8197;nm Near&#8208;Infrared Light</title>

A novel class of Ruthenium(II) complexes that can be photoactivated at 770&#8197;nm under hypoxic conditions thanks to the incorporation of a heptamethine cyanine dye is described.







Abstract
Light&#8208;activated treatments, such as photodynamic therapy (PDT), provide temporal and spatial control over a specific cytotoxic response by exploiting toxicity differences between irradiated and dark conditions. In this work, a novel strategy for developing near infrared (NIR)&#8208;activatable Ru(II) polypyridyl&#8208;based photosensitizers (PSs) was successfully developed through the incorporation of symmetric heptamethine cyanine dyes in the metal complex via a phenanthrimidazole ligand. Owing to their strong absorption in the NIR region, the PSs could be efficiently photoactivated with highly penetrating NIR light (770&#8197;nm), leading to high photocytotoxicities towards several cancer cell lines under both normoxic and hypoxic conditions. Notably, our lead PS (Ru&#8208;Cyn&#8208;1), which accumulated in the mitochondria, exhibited a good photocytotoxic activity under challenging low&#8208;oxygen concentration (2&#8201;% O2) upon NIR light irradiation conditions (770&#8197;nm), owing to a combination of type I and II PDT mechanisms. The fact that the PS Protoporphyrin IX (PpIX), the metabolite of the clinically approved 5&#8208;ALA PS, was found inactive under the same challenging conditions positions Ru&#8208;Cyn&#8208;1 complex as a promising PDT agent for the treatment of deep&#8208;seated hypoxic tumours.

         <title>Direct Solution&#8208;Phase Synthesis and Functionalization of 2D WSe2 for Ambient Stability</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 61, November 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Simultaneous exfoliation and noncovalent functionalization of 2D WSe2 by commercial surfactants containing varying hydrophobic chain length and hydroxyl and mercapto head groups, which contribute to its long&#8208;term stability in aqueous suspension, is described.







Abstract
2H phase tungsten diselenide (WSe2) is a p&#8208;type 2D semiconductor from the transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) family with unique optoelectrical properties. Solution phase production of atomically thin WSe2 is challenging due to its instability under ambient conditions. We present a highly efficient and scalable solution method for simultaneously exfoliating and functionalizing WSe2 by leveraging the non&#8208;covalent interaction between mercapto&#8208;group and bulk WSe2. Single and few&#8208;layer 2H phase pure WSe2 sheets of lateral size up to 5&#8197;&#956;m with minimal basal plane defects, as revealed by XPS, Raman and FTIR spectroscopy, are produced in a water&#8208;ethanol mixture. Remarkably, WSe2 dispersion remains stable even at high concentrations (10&#8197;mg/mL) and exhibited high colloidal stability with a shelf&#8208;life exceeding a year. The findings from our study suggest that through precise manipulation of intercalation chemistry, mass production of solution&#8208;processable phase&#8208;sensitive 2D materials such as WSe2 can be achieved. This advancement holds great potential for facilitating their practical utilization in various real&#8208;world applications.

         <title>DFT Study of Imine&#8208;Exchange Reactions in Iron(II)&#8208;Coordinated Pincers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 61, November 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Proton shuttle: A DFT study on condensation and transimination reactions of an Fe2+&#8208;coordinated diimine pyridine pincer was conducted. Titration experiments confirmed the use of Fe2+ as a model metal ion, after which the reactions were investigated computationally using traditional four&#8208;membered ring transition states for proton transfer. When those displayed unrealistic high energy barriers, two ethylamines were added to function as proton shuttles, which lowered the activation energies to realistic values.







Abstract
The imine bond is among the most applied motifs in dynamic covalent chemistry. Although its uses are varied and often involve coordination to a transition metal for stability, mechanistic studies on imine exchange reactions so far have not included metal coordination. Herein, we investigated the condensation and transimination reactions of an Fe2+&#8208;coordinated diimine pyridine pincer, employing wB97XD/6&#8208;311G(2d,2p) DFT calculations in acetonitrile. We first experimentally confirmed that Fe2+ is strongly coordinated by these pincers, and is thus a justified model ion.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Proton shuttle&lt;/b&gt;: A DFT study on condensation and transimination reactions of an Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-coordinated diimine pyridine pincer was conducted. Titration experiments confirmed the use of Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; as a model metal ion, after which the reactions were investigated computationally using traditional four-membered ring transition states for proton transfer. When those displayed unrealistic high energy barriers, two ethylamines were added to function as proton shuttles, which lowered the activation energies to realistic values.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The imine bond is among the most applied motifs in dynamic covalent chemistry. Although its uses are varied and often involve coordination to a transition metal for stability, mechanistic studies on imine exchange reactions so far have not included metal coordination. Herein, we investigated the condensation and transimination reactions of an Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-coordinated diimine pyridine pincer, employing wB97XD/6-311G(2d,2p) DFT calculations in acetonitrile. We first experimentally confirmed that Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; is strongly coordinated by these pincers, and is thus a justified model ion. When considering a four-membered ring-shaped transition state for proton transfers, the required activation energies for condensation and transimination reaction exceeded the values expected for reactions known to be spontaneous at room temperature. The nature of the incoming and exiting amines and the substituents on the &lt;i&gt;para&lt;/i&gt;-position of the pincer had no effect on this.

However, the addition of two ethylamine molecules lowered the energy barriers to be compatible with experiment (19.4 and 23.2&#8197;kcal/mol for condensation and transimination, respectively). Lastly, the energy barrier of condensation of a non-coordinated pincer was significantly higher than found for Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-coordinating pincers, underlining the catalyzing effect of metal coordination on imine exchange reactions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Elucidating the Excited State Behavior of Pyridyl Pyridinium Systems via Computational and Transient Absorption Studies of Tetrahedral Multichromophoric Arrays and their Model Compounds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 61, November 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A set of tetrameric molecules with four identical subunits bearing pyridyl pyridinium or bipyridinium moieties has been investigated by means of steady&#8208;state and time resolved spectroscopy and the results are corroborated by computational studies. The behavior of the tetrameric molecules, when compared with that of the corresponding model compounds (one of the four identical arms), highlights a remarkable electronic interaction between the subunits in the array.







Abstract
The tetrahedral shape&#8208;persistent molecule 14+, containing four identical pyridyl pyridinium units connected via a sp3 hybridized carbon atom, has been investigated in detail by means of steady&#8208;state and time resolved spectroscopy. Remarkable photophysical properties are observed, particularly in comparison with protonated and methylated analogues (1H48+, 1Me48+), which exhibit substantially shorter excited state lifetimes and lower emission quantum yields. Theoretical studies have rationalized the behavior of the tetrameric molecules relative to the monomers, with DFT and TD&#8208;DFT calculations corroborating steady&#8208;state (absorption and emission) and transient absorption spectra. The behavior of the monomeric compounds (each consisting in one of the four identical subunits of the tetramers, i.&#8201;e., 2+, 2H2+ and 2Me2+) considerably differs from that of the tetramers, indicating a strong electronic interaction between the subunits in the tetrameric species, likely promoted by the homoconjugation through the connecting sp3&#8197;C atom. 2+ is characterized by a peculiar S1&#8208;S2 excited state inversion, whereas the short&#8208;lived emitting S1 state of 2H2+ and 2Me2+ exhibits a partial charge&#8208;transfer character, as substantiated by spectro&#8208;electrochemical studies. Among the six investigated systems, only 14+ is a sizeable luminophore (&#934;em=0.15), which is related to the peculiar features of its singlet state.

         <title>Naphthalene&#8208;Embedded Multi&#8208;Resonance Emitters Enabling Efficient Narrow Emissive Blue OLEDs

Naphthalene&#8208;embedded multi&#8208;resonance blue emitters based on N&#8722;B&#8722;O frameworks with different structural variation for finely tuning the photophysical properties, which enables effcient narrowband emissive organic light emitting diodes have been designed and investigated.







Abstract
Great achievements have been made in the development of organic light&#8208;emitting diodes in recent decades. However, achieving high color purity for blue emitters remains a challenge. In this study, we have designed and synthesized three naphthalene (NA)&#8208;embedded multi&#8208;resonance (MR) emitters, named SNA, SNB and SNB1, based on N&#8722;B&#8722;O frameworks with isomer variations for finely adjusting the photophysical properties. These emitters show tunable blue emission with emission peaks of 450&#8211;470&#8197;nm. Small full width of half maximum (FWHM) of 25&#8211;29&#8197;nm are achieved in these emitters, indicating the well maintaining of molecular rigidity and MR effect with NA extension. Such design also ensures a fast radiative decay. However, no obvious delayed fluorescence is observed in all three emitters due to the relatively large energy differences between the first singlet and triplet excited states. Both SNA and SNB enable high electroluminescent (EL) performance in doped devices with external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 7.2 and 7.9&#8201;%, respectively. When applying the sensitized strategy, devices based on SNA and SNB show huge improvement with EQE of 29.3 and 29.1&#8201;%. More importantly, SNB with twist geometry enables stable EL spectra with almost unchanged FWHM under different doping concentrations. This work demonstrates the potential of NA extension design in constructing narrowband emissive blue emitters.

         <title>Bridging the Gap between Zeolites and Dense Silica Polymorphs: Formation of All&#8208;Silica Zeolite with High Framework Density from Natural Layered Silicate Magadiite</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 61, November 2, 2023. </description>

Between zeolite and silica: A silica zeolite RWZ&#8208;1 with a very high framework density (FD) was synthesized through topotactic condensation of natural layered silicate magadiite. Based on the viewpoint of its FD and thermal expansion behavior, RWZ&#8208;1 is regarded as a truly intermediate silica material between zeolites and dense silica polymorphs, which can be applicable as a unique catalyst and adsorbent.







Abstract
A silica zeolite (RWZ&#8208;1) with a very high framework density (FD) was synthesized from highly crystalline natural layered silicate magadiite, bridging the gap between the two research areas of zeolites and dense silica polymorphs. Magadiite was topotactically converted into a 3D framework through two&#8208;step heat treatment. The resulting structure had a 1D micropore system of channel&#8208;like cavities with an FD of 22.1 Si atoms/1000&#8197;&#197;3. This value is higher than those of all other silica zeolites reported so far, approaching those of silica polymorphs (tridymite (22.6) and &#945;&#8208;quartz (26.5)). RWZ&#8208;1 is a slight negative thermal expansion material with thermal properties approaching those of dense silica polymorphs. It contributes to the creation of a new field on microporous high&#8208;density silica/silicates. Synergistic interactions are expected between the micropores with molecular sieving properties and the dense layer&#8208;like building units with different topologies which provide thermal and mechanical stabilities.

         <title>Diverse Reactions of Formazanate/Formazan with Tetrylenes: Reduction, C&#8722;H Bond Activation, Substitution and Addition</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 61, November 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The diverse redox chemistry of formazanate/formazan with low&#8208;valent group&#8197;14 compounds is inverstigated. Both formazanate potassium salt and neutral formazan ligands were subjected to reactions with tetrylenes. In the former case, the anticipated salt metathesis reactions occurred, accompanied by unexpected reduction/insertion and C&#8722;H activation. The latter reactions displayed substitution and addition reaction patterns.







Abstract

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The diverse redox chemistry&lt;/b&gt; of formazanate/formazan with low-valent group&#8197;14 compounds is inverstigated. Both formazanate potassium salt and neutral formazan ligands were subjected to reactions with tetrylenes. In the former case, the anticipated salt metathesis reactions occurred, accompanied by unexpected reduction/insertion and C&#8722;H activation. The latter reactions displayed substitution and addition reaction patterns.

Reactions of the mixed dipnictogen complexes [{CpMo(CO)2}2(&#956;,&#951;2&#8201;:&#8201;2&#8208;PE)] (E=P, As, Sb) with carbon&#8208; and tin&#8208;based electrophiles led to the formation of novel [EPR]+ chains stabilized by two [CpMo(CO)2] units, which can formally be considered as heavier diazonium homologs. Reactivity studies on these unique entities with different NHCs showed the formation of novel, asymmetrically substituted diphosphenes.







Abstract
The reactivity of the mixed dipnictogen complexes [{CpMo(CO)2}2(&#956;,&#951;2&#8201;:&#8201;2&#8208;PE)] (E=P, As, Sb) towards different group&#8197;14 electrophiles is reported. The resulting library of cationic compounds [{CpMo(CO)2}2(&#956;,&#951;2&#8201;:&#8201;2&#8208;EPR)]+ (R=Mes (2,4,6&#8208;C6H2Me3), CH3, CPh3, SnMe3) represents formally inorganic diazonium homologs which are stabilized by transition metal units. Modifying the steric and electronic properties of the electrophile drastically impacts the respective P&#8722;R bond lengths and is accompanied by increasing (SnMe3&gt;CPh3&gt;CH3) dynamic behavior in solution. In contrast to the well&#8208;studied organic analogs, the prepared compounds are stable at room temperature. The subsequent reaction of the model substrate [{CpMo(CO)2}2(&#956;,&#951;2&#8201;:&#8201;2&#8208;P2Me)][OTf] ([OTf]&#8722;=[CF3SO3]&#8722;) with different N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) leads to an addition at the unsubstituted P atom which is also predicted by computational methods. NMR spectroscopy confirms the formation of two isomers sync/gauche&#8208;[{CpMo(CO)2}(&#956;,&#951;2&#8201;:&#8201;1&#8208;P(NHC)PMe){CpMo(CO)2}][OTf]. X&#8208;ray crystallographic characterization and additional DFT calculations shed light on the spatial arrangement as well as on the possible formation pathways of the isomers.

N&#8208;alkylation of diazo compounds: Value&#8208;added to industry waste diazo compounds using feedstock alcohols under earth&#8208;abundant manganese catalysis.alcoholdehydrogenative couplingdrug intermediateshydrogenkinetic studiesmanganese







Abstract
Sustainable chemical production requires fundamentally new types of catalysts and catalytic technologies. The development of coherent and robust catalytic systems based on earth&#8208;abundant transition metals is essential, but highly challenging. Herein, we systematically explored a general hydrogenative cleavage/N&#8208;alkylation tandem of cyclic and acyclic diazo (N=N) compounds to value&#8208;added amines under manganese catalysis. The reaction is catalyzed by a single&#8208;site molecular manganese complex and proceeds via tandem dehydrogenation, transfer hydrogenation, and borrowing hydrogenation strategies. Interestingly, the reaction involves abundantly available renewable feedstocks, such as alcohols, that can act as (transfer)hydrogenating and alkylating agents. The synthetic application of our approach in large&#8208;scale pharmaceutical synthesis and easy access to highly demanding N&#8208;CH3/CD3 derivatives are also demonstrated. Kinetic studies show that the reaction rate depends on the concentration of alcohol and Mn&#8208;catalyst and follows fractional orders. Several selective bond activation/formation reactions occur sequentially via amine&#8211;amide metal&#8208;ligand cooperation.

Under mild conditions: A redox&#8208;neutral and base&#8208;free protocol for the directed ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H aminocarbonylation is developed through high&#8208;throughput experimentation. The mild conditions allowed the introduction of privileged amide moieties to a wide range of anilides bearing various substitution patterns and different weakly Lewis basic directing groups.







Abstract
Introducing amide functional groups under mild conditions has growing importance owing to the prevalence of such moiety in biologically active molecules. Herein, we disclose a mild protocol for the directed ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H aminocarbonylation with isocyanates as the amidating agents developed through high&#8208;throughput experimentation (HTE). The redox&#8208;neutral and base&#8208;free reaction is guided by weakly Lewis basic functional groups, including anilides, lactams and carbamates to access anthranilamide derivatives. The synthetic utility of this transformation is reflected by large&#8208;scale synthesis and late&#8208;stage functionalization.

         <title>Highly Enantioselective Synthesis of Pharmaceuticals at Chiral&#8208;Encoded Metal Surfaces</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 61, November 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanostructured mesoporous Pt&#8208;Ir alloys are used as heterogeneous catalysts for the asymmetric synthesis of pharmaceutical compounds, illustrated by the enantioselective hydrogenation adrenalone, leading to the desired epinephrine stereoisomer as a model compound with up to 95&#8201;% ee.







Abstract
Enantioselective catalysis is of crucial importance in modern chemistry and pharmaceutical science. Although various concepts have been used for the development of enantioselective catalysts to obtain highly pure chiral compounds, most of them are based on homogeneous catalytic systems. Recently, we successfully developed nanostructured metal layers imprinted with chiral information, which were applied as electrocatalysts for the enantioselective synthesis of chiral model compounds. However, so far such materials have not been employed as heterogeneous catalysts for the enantioselective synthesis of real pharmaceutical products. In this contribution, we report the asymmetric synthesis of chiral pharmaceuticals (CPs) with chiral imprinted Pt&#8722;Ir surfaces as a simple hydrogenation catalyst. By fine&#8208;tuning the experimental parameters, a very high enantioselectivity (up to 95&#8201;% enantiomeric excess) with good catalyst stability can be achieved. The designed materials were also successfully used as catalytically active stationary phases for the continuous asymmetric flow synthesis of pharmaceutical compounds. This illustrates the possibility of producing real chiral pharmaceuticals at such nanostructured metal surfaces for the first time.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Nanostructured mesoporous Pt-Ir alloys&lt;/b&gt; are used as heterogeneous catalysts for the asymmetric synthesis of pharmaceutical compounds, illustrated by the enantioselective hydrogenation adrenalone, leading to the desired epinephrine stereoisomer as a model compound with up to 95&#8201;% &lt;i&gt;ee&lt;/i&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enantioselective catalysis is of crucial importance in modern chemistry and pharmaceutical science. Although various concepts have been used for the development of enantioselective catalysts to obtain highly pure chiral compounds, most of them are based on homogeneous catalytic systems. Recently, we successfully developed nanostructured metal layers imprinted with chiral information, which were applied as electrocatalysts for the enantioselective synthesis of chiral model compounds. However, so far such materials have not been employed as heterogeneous catalysts for the enantioselective synthesis of real pharmaceutical products. In this contribution, we report the asymmetric synthesis of chiral pharmaceuticals (CPs) with chiral imprinted Pt&#8722;Ir surfaces as a simple hydrogenation catalyst. By fine-tuning the experimental parameters, a very high enantioselectivity (up to 95&#8201;% enantiomeric excess) with good catalyst stability can be achieved. The designed materials were also successfully used as catalytically active stationary phases for the continuous asymmetric flow synthesis of pharmaceutical compounds. This illustrates the possibility of producing real chiral pharmaceuticals at such nanostructured metal surfaces for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Photo&#8208;degradable Crosslinker for the Development of Light&#8208;responsive Protocell Membranes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 61, November 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel photocleavable, poly(ethylene) glycol&#8208;based crosslinker, reactive to biological nucleophiles is synthesized and used to covalently stabilise proteinosome membranes. The crosslinker effectively degrades on irradiation with UV light, allowing for the photopatterning of populations of proteinosomes using a 405&#8197;nm laser, and for the controlled formation of membrane pores and the consequent controlled release of macromolecular cargoes based on their molecular weight.







Abstract
The achievement of light&#8208;responsive behaviours is an important target for protocell engineering to allow control of fundamental protocellular processes such as communication via diffusible chemical signals, shape changes or even motility at the flick of a switch. As a step towards this ambitious goal, here we describe the synthesis of a novel poly(ethylene glycol)&#8208;based crosslinker, reactive towards nucleophiles, that effectively degrades with UV light (405&#8197;nm). We demonstrate its utility for the fabrication of the first protocell membranes capable of light&#8208;induced disassembly, for the photo&#8208;generation of patterns of protocells, and for the modulation of protocell membrane permeability. Overall, our results not only open up new avenues towards the engineering of spatially organised, communicating networks of protocells, and of micro&#8208;compartmentalised systems for information storage and release, but also have important implications for other research fields such as drug delivery and soft materials chemistry.

Four different 5,8&#8217;&#8208;coupled naphthylisoquinoline alkaloids have been prepared via a general and concise synthetic pathway directly from the corresponding cross&#8208;coupling reaction precursors. For the cross&#8208;coupling key step, a new Negishi cross&#8208;coupling reaction, employing a Ni/N,N&#8208;ligand&#8208;based catalyst providing the natural products in good yields and high enantiomeric purities, has been developed. Furthermore, we also report on a new approach to the northern 1,8&#8208;dioxynaphthalene building blocks found in the naphthylisoquinoline natural products, utilizing Hartwig's borylation/methylation strategy that allows for the efficient installation of orthogonal protecting groups.







Abstract
A general and concise synthetic pathway for the preparation of four different 5,8&#8217;&#8208;coupled naphthylisoquinoline alkaloids, employing a specially developed nickel/N,N&#8208;ligand&#8208;catalyzed atroposelective Negishi coupling is reported. In the first reported direct atroposelective coupling of the fully substituted precursors, the naturally occurring cross&#8208;coupled products were generally obtained directly in reasonable yields and high enantiomeric purities. For the synthesis of the cross&#8208;coupling precursors, we employed a modification of Bringmann's known approach to the dihydroisoquinoline compounds and a newly developed route for the naphthalene building blocks. For the latter 1,8&#8208;dioxynaphthalene precursors, our strategy utilized Hartwig's borylation/methylation approach and included the efficient installation of orthogonal protecting groups.

         <title>Electroactive Dyes Based on 1,8&#8208;Naphthalimide with Acetylene Linkers as Promising OLED Materials &#8211; the Relationship Between Structure and Photophysical Properties</title>

Appropriate communication is the key to success: four new 1,8&#8208;napthalimide derivatives of acceptor&#8208;&#960;&#8208;donor&#8208;&#960;&#8208;acceptor type were obtained and thoroughly investigated, paying special attention to photophysical properties. The key element of the structures are the ethynyl linkers, thanks to which perfect &#960;&#8208;electron communication between aromaric building blocks is possible. These luminescence, highly efficient emitters were tested in SM&#8208;OLEDs&#8217; prototypes (DEV1&#8208;DEV4).







Abstract
Four A&#8208;&#960;&#8208;D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A type small organic molecules with 1,8&#8208;naphthalimide motifs were successfully synthesised. The designed compounds are built of two 1,8&#8208;naphthalimide units linked via ethynyl &#960;&#8208;linkages with selected functionalised donor motifs i.&#8201;e. 2,2&#8217;&#8208;bithiophene, fluorene, phenothiazine and carbazole derivative. The synthesis based on Sonogashira cross&#8208;coupling allowed us to obtain the presented dyes with good yields. The resulting symmetrical small molecules&#8217; optical, electrochemical and thermal properties were thoroughly investigated, and their potential applicability for the OLED devices was demonstrated. In addition, the relationship between molecular structure and properties was considered by employing experimental and theoretical studies. As a result of using various donor groups, it was possible to achieve efficient electroluminescence in the range from green (DEV4) to orange&#8208;red light (DEV3) with a maximum luminance of 3 820&#8197;cd/m2 for DEV4. Upon the insertion of an acetylene linker to the designed molecules, the free rotation of D and A fragments, and hence the effective &#960;&#8208;electron communication within the entire molecule, is possible, which was confirmed by DFT studies. The obtained dyes are characterised by high thermal stability, reversible oxidation&#8208;reduction process, satisfactory optoelectronic properties and good solubility in organic solvents, which is advisable for the application in small molecular organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (SM&#8208;OLEDs) technology.

         <title>Efficient Spin&#8211;Orbit Charge&#8208;Transfer Intersystem Crossing and Slow Intramolecular Triplet&#8211;Triplet Energy Transfer in Bodipy&#8211;Perylenebisimide Compact Dyads and Triads</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 61, November 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Intersystem crossing: FRET (40.4&#8197;ps) and CS (1.55&#8197;ns) were observed, upper 3BDP* was populated by charge recombination, followed by the slow intramolecular TTET (14.5&#8197;&#956;s), which generates 3PBI* state, the triplet state formed via the RP ISC shows an unusual ESP phase pattern of (e, e, e, e, e, e), which is a rare example of S&#8208;T+1/T0 states mixing in the RP ISC mechanism.







Abstract
Bodipy (BDP)&#8208;perylenebisimide (PBI) donor&#8211;acceptor dyads/triad were prepared to study the spin&#8211;orbit charge&#8208;transfer intersystem crossing (SOCT&#8208;ISC). For BDP&#8208;PBI&#8208;3, in which BDP was attached at the imide position of PBI, higher singlet oxygen quantum yield (&#934;&#916;=85&#8201;%) was observed than the bay&#8208;substituted derivative BDP&#8208;PBI&#8208;1 (&#934;&#916;=30&#8201;%). Femtosecond transient absorption spectra indicate slow F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET; 40.4&#8197;ps) and charge separation (CS; 1.55&#8197;ns) in BDP&#8208;PBI&#8208;3, while for BDP&#8208;PBI&#8208;1, CS takes 2.8&#8197;ps. For triad BDP&#8208;PBI&#8208;2, ultrafast FRET (149&#8197;fs) and CS (4.7&#8197;ps) process were observed, the subsequent charge recombination (CR) takes 5.8&#8197;ns and long&#8208;lived 3PBI* (179.8&#8197;&#956;s) state is populated. Nanosecond transient absorption spectra of BDP&#8208;PBI&#8208;3 show that the CR gives upper triplet excited state (3BDP*) and subsequently, via a slow intramolecular triplet energy transfer (14.5&#8197;&#956;s), the 3PBI* state is finally populated, indicating that upper triplet state is involved in SOCT&#8208;ISC. Time&#8208;resolved electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy revealed that both radical pair ISC (RP ISC) and SOCT&#8208;ISC contribute to the ISC. A rare electron spin polarization of (e, e, e, e, e, e) was observed for the triplet state formed via the RP ISC mechanism, due to the S&#8722;T+1/T0 states mixing.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Intersystem crossing&lt;/b&gt;: FRET (40.4&#8197;ps) and CS (1.55&#8197;ns) were observed, upper &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;BDP* was populated by charge recombination, followed by the slow intramolecular TTET (14.5&#8197;&#956;s), which generates &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;PBI* state, the triplet state formed via the RP ISC shows an unusual ESP phase pattern of (&lt;i&gt;e&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;e&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;e&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;e&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;e&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;e&lt;/i&gt;), which is a rare example of S-T&lt;sub&gt;+1&lt;/sub&gt;/T&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; states mixing in the RP ISC mechanism.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bodipy (BDP)-perylenebisimide (PBI) donor&#8211;acceptor dyads/triad were prepared to study the spin&#8211;orbit charge-transfer intersystem crossing (SOCT-ISC). For &lt;b&gt;BDP-PBI-3&lt;/b&gt;, in which BDP was attached at the imide position of PBI, higher singlet oxygen quantum yield (&lt;i&gt;&#934;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;&#916;&lt;/sub&gt;=85&#8201;%) was observed than the bay-substituted derivative &lt;b&gt;BDP-PBI-1&lt;/b&gt; (&lt;i&gt;&#934;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;&#916;&lt;/sub&gt;=30&#8201;%). Femtosecond transient absorption spectra indicate slow F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET; 40.4&#8197;ps) and charge separation (CS; 1.55&#8197;ns) in &lt;b&gt;BDP-PBI-3&lt;/b&gt;, while for &lt;b&gt;BDP-PBI-1&lt;/b&gt;, CS takes 2.8&#8197;ps. For triad &lt;b&gt;BDP-PBI-2&lt;/b&gt;, ultrafast FRET (149&#8197;fs) and CS (4.7&#8197;ps) process were observed, the subsequent charge recombination (CR) takes 5.8&#8197;ns and long-lived &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;PBI* (179.8&#8197;&#956;s) state is populated. Nanosecond transient absorption spectra of &lt;b&gt;BDP-PBI-3&lt;/b&gt; show that the CR gives upper triplet excited state (&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;BDP*) and subsequently, via a slow intramolecular triplet energy transfer (14.5&#8197;&#956;s), the &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;PBI* state is finally populated, indicating that upper triplet state is involved in SOCT-ISC. Time-resolved electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy revealed that both radical pair ISC (RP ISC) and SOCT-ISC contribute to the ISC. A rare electron spin polarization of (&lt;i&gt;e&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;e&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;e&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;e&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;e&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;e&lt;/i&gt;) was observed for the triplet state formed via the RP ISC mechanism, due to the S&#8722;T&lt;sub&gt;+1&lt;/sub&gt;/T&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; states mixing.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Synthesis, Structure, and Redox and Optical Properties of 5,10,15,20&#8208;Tetraaryl&#8208;5&#8208;azaporphyrinium Salts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 61, November 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A metal&#8208;templated annulation method is established for the synthesis of 5,10,15,20&#8208;tetraaryl&#8208;5&#8208;monoazaporphyrinium (TAMAP) salts, which exhibit characteristic redox and optical properties reflecting the electronic effects of the meso&#8208;nitrogen atom. The zinc complex of TAMAP salt generated singlet oxygen in quantum yield of 0.77 under irradiation with visible light.







Abstract
The fundamental properties of azaporphyrins can be modulated over a wide range by changing the number of meso&#8208;nitrogen atoms. Reported herein are the first examples of 5,10,15,20&#8208;tetraaryl&#8208;5&#8208;azaporphyrinium (MTAMAP) salts, which were prepared via metal&#8208;templated cyclization of the corresponding zinc(II) and copper(II) complexes of 10&#8208;aryl&#8208;1&#8208;chloro&#8208;19&#8208;benzoyl&#8208;5,15&#8208;dimesityl&#8208;10&#8208;azabiladiene&#8208;ac. The inclusion of one meso&#8208;nitrogen atom in the 5,10,15,20&#8208;tetraarylporphyrin skeleton considerably changes the redox and optical properties as well as the degree of aromaticity of the porphyrin ring. The present findings suggest that MTAMAP salts would be promising scaffolds for the development of new azaporphyrin&#8208;based ionic fluorophores and photosensitizers.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Free Catalytic Hydrogenolysis of Chlorosilanes into Hydrosilanes with &#8220;Inverse&#8221; Frustrated Lewis Pairs
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 61, November 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydrosilanes can be synthesized from chlorosilanes and H2, thanks to a combination of a superbase and a borane catalyst, forming an inverse FLP. A mechanistic study demonstrates that the key intermediate species is a highly reactive borohydride, arising from H2 heterolytic splitting.







Abstract
The challenging metal&#8208;free catalytic hydrogenolysis of silyl chlorides to hydrosilanes is unlocked by using an inverse frustrated Lewis pair (FLP), combining a mild Lewis acid (Cy2BCl) and a strong phosphazene base (BTPP) in mild conditions (10&#8197;bar of H2, r.&#8201;t.). In the presence of a stoichiometric amount of the base, the hydrosilanes R3SiH (R=Me, Et, Ph) are generated in moderate to high yields (up to 95&#8201;%) from their chlorinated counterparts. A selective formation of the valuable difunctional monohydride Me2SiHCl is also obtained from Me2SiCl2. A mechanism is proposed based on stoichiometric experiments and DFT calculations; it highlights the critical role of borohydride species generated by the heterolytic splitting of H2.

A highly soluble perylene anti&#8208;bis(4,5&#8208;dialkoxybenzimidazole) bearing branched flexible chains that stabilize a room&#8208;temperature columnar hexagonal phase is reported for the first time. With balanced ambipolar charge carrier mobility, it has a high extinction coefficient, a small optical band gap and a wide absorption range.







Abstract
A new series of highly soluble perylene anti&#8208;bis(4,5&#8208;dialkoxybenzimidazole)s bearing branched flexible chains stabilizing room temperature columnar hexagonal phase and with balanced ambipolar charge carrier mobility is reported for the first time. Only the anti isomer was successfully separated and characterized. These compounds have a high extinction coefficient, small optical band gap and wide absorption range, thus making them a promising class of ambipolar organic semiconductors capable of self&#8208;organizing.

         <title>Hexakis&#8208;TIPS&#8208;Alkynylated Nonacenes: Persistent and Processible</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 61, November 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Soluble nonacenes are stabilized via triisopropylsilyl&#8208;ethynylation, halogenation and methoxylation. The substitution resulted in the most stable nonacenes to date. Two derivatives were characterized by crystal structure analysis and one derivative is tested as thin&#8208;film transistor material.







Abstract
Four substituted nonacenes were prepared and characterized by UV&#8208;vis and EPR spectroscopy and X&#8208;ray crystallography. The compounds are the most stable and soluble nonacenes to date &#8211; due to six strategically placed triisopropylsilyl(TIPS)&#8208;ethynyl groups. They are stable for several weeks in the solid state. In dilute solution their half&#8208;life is 5&#8211;9&#8197;h. Crystal structure analyses of two nonacenes prove their structures. A nonacene derivative was tested in a solution&#8208;processed transistor and exhibits ambipolar charge transport (&#956;e=0.007&#8197;cm2/Vs; &#956;h=0.023&#8197;cm2/Vs).

         <title>Non&#8208;Covalent Supramolecular 1D Alternating Copolymer in Crystal toward 2D Anisotropic Photon Transport</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 61, November 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The 1D non&#8208;covalent supramolecular copolymer is aligned horizontally with the 2D crystal surface because of the angle&#8208;controlled supramolecular synthons. The anisotropic waveguiding ability, &#945;L/&#945;S, is estimated to be 41, which is more than an order of magnitude greater than previously reported 2D platelet crystal waveguides.







Abstract
To realize organic integrated optoelectronic circuits, there is a need for anisotropic optical waveguides at the micro/nanoscale. Anisotropic alignment of one&#8208;dimensional&#8208;ordered supramolecular structures composed of light&#8208;emissive &#960;&#8208;conjugated molecules in a crystal may meet the requirements of such waveguides. Here, a bipyridyl&#8208;appended acrylonitrile&#8208;based &#960;&#8208;conjugated molecule was designed, which produced a one&#8208;dimensional supramolecular polymer constructed through non&#8208;covalent bonding between a lone pair in bipyridyl and a &#963;&#8208;hole in 1,4&#8208;diiodo&#8208;2,3,5,6&#8208;tetrafluorobenzene. The one&#8208;dimensional copolymer of bipyridyl and 1,4&#8208;diiodo&#8208;2,3,5,6&#8208;tetrafluorobenzene is aligned horizontally with the two&#8208;dimensional crystal surface because of the angle&#8208;controlled supramolecular synthons. As a result of control over the non&#8208;covalent bonding direction, anisotropic photoluminescence and photon transport (optical waveguiding) characteristics are realized by orienting the transition dipole moment horizontally with respect to the two&#8208;dimensional surface. Compared with the loss coefficient &#945;L=52&#8197;dB&#8201;cm&#8722;1 for the long&#8208;axis direction of the two&#8208;dimensional platelet cocrystal, a very large difference of &#945;S=2111&#8197;dB&#8201;cm&#8722;1 is present in the crystal short&#8208;axis direction. The anisotropic waveguiding ability, &#945;L/&#945;S, is estimated to be 41, which is more than an order of magnitude greater than previously reported two&#8208;dimensional platelet crystal waveguides. This supramolecular synthon provides an approach to designing anisotropic photon transporters and highly regulated optical logic circuits.

&lt;p&gt;To realize organic integrated optoelectronic circuits, there is a need for anisotropic optical waveguides at the micro/nanoscale. Anisotropic alignment of one-dimensional-ordered supramolecular structures composed of light-emissive &#960;-conjugated molecules in a crystal may meet the requirements of such waveguides. Here, a bipyridyl-appended acrylonitrile-based &#960;-conjugated molecule was designed, which produced a one-dimensional supramolecular polymer constructed through non-covalent bonding between a lone pair in bipyridyl and a &#963;-hole in 1,4-diiodo-2,3,5,6-tetrafluorobenzene. The one-dimensional copolymer of bipyridyl and 1,4-diiodo-2,3,5,6-tetrafluorobenzene is aligned horizontally with the two-dimensional crystal surface because of the angle-controlled supramolecular synthons. As a result of control over the non-covalent bonding direction, anisotropic photoluminescence and photon transport (optical waveguiding) characteristics are realized by orienting the transition dipole moment horizontally with respect to the two-dimensional surface.

A jewelry rack represents the square&#8208;lattice of a metal&#8211;organic framework. This is exemplified by a MOF being visible when the jewelry rack is reflected in the table mirror. The earrings on the rack are attached with S&#8722;S hooks that mimic the disulfide bonds used to append functional groups to MOFs in this work. The earrings lacking the S&#8208;hook are left resting on the table, unable to attach to the rack. More information can be found in the Research Article by D.&#8197;T.

Nanostructured mesoporous Pt&#8208;Ir alloys, illustrated by the tunnel entrances, have been successfully developed as heterogeneous catalysts for the asymmetric synthesis of pharmaceutical compounds. These findings, reported by C. Wattanakit, A. Kuhn, and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202302054), illustrate that these designer materials allow the enantioselective hydrogenation of adrenalone to produce the desired epinephrine stereoisomer with up to 95&#8201;% enantiomeric excess.

         <title>Donor&#8208;Acceptor Activation of Carbon Dioxide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 61, November 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The cooperative activation of carbon dioxide by donor&#8208;acceptor interactions have become a highly popular strategy whose chemical designs span across the whole periodic table. This perspective categorizes the wide variety of systems reported and assesses their limitations and prospects to develop catalytic functionalization protocols.







Abstract
The activation and functionalization of carbon dioxide entails great interest related to its abundance, low toxicity and associated environmental problems. However, the inertness of CO2 has posed a challenge towards its efficient conversion to added&#8208;value products. In this review we discuss one of the strategies that have been widely used to capture and activate carbon dioxide, namely the use of donor&#8208;acceptor interactions by partnering a Lewis acidic and a Lewis basic fragment. This type of CO2 activation resembles that found in metalloenzymes, whose outstanding performance in catalytically transforming carbon dioxide encourages further bioinspired research. We have divided this review into three general sections based on the nature of the active sites: metal&#8208;free examples (mainly formed by frustrated Lewis pairs), main group&#8208;transition metal combinations, and transition metal heterobimetallic complexes. Overall, we discuss one hundred compounds that cooperatively activate carbon dioxide by donor&#8208;acceptor interactions, revealing a wide range of structural motifs.

         <title>&#8220;Holographic&#8221; Autostereoscopic Displays: A Perspective on Their Technology and Potential Impact in Chemistry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 61, November 2, 2023. </description>

Adding dimensions to chemistry: I explore the potential of &#8220;holographic&#8221; autostereoscopic displays in chemistry research and education. This perspective delves into how this emerging technology could enhance the understanding of complex molecular structures, offering a more immersive and intuitive learning and research experience.







Abstract
The three&#8208;dimensional arrangement of atoms in molecules is essential for understanding their properties and behavior. Traditional 2D representations and digital 3D models presented on 2D media often fall short in conveying the complexity of molecular structures. Autostereoscopic displays, often marketed as &#8220;holographic&#8221; displays, pose a potential solution to this challenge. These displays, with their multi&#8208;view and single&#8208;view configurations, promise to advance chemistry education and research by offering accurate 3D representations with depth and parallax. In this perspective, I delve into the possibilities and limitations of autostereoscopic displays in chemistry, discussing the underlying technology and potential applications, from research to teaching and science communication. Multi&#8208;view autostereoscopic displays excel in facilitating collaborative work by enabling multiple viewers to simultaneously perceive the same 3D structure from different angles. However, they currently suffer from low resolution and high cost, which could limit their immediate widespread adoption. Conversely, single&#8208;view autostereoscopic displays with eye&#8208;tracking, while limited to one viewer at a time, provide higher resolution at a lower cost, thus suggesting that they might become the technology of the future given the balance of price to performance. Despite current limitations, autostereoscopic displays possess undeniable potential for shaping the future of chemistry education and research.

         <title>Doubly Bridged Anthracenes: Blue Emitters for OLEDs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The photooxidative stability of a series of doubly bridged anthracenes was evaluated after their preparation via twofold macrocyclization of a bis(resorcinyl)anthracene. Lightfastness correlates with the energy levels of the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO), resulting in superior stability of the tetraesters compared to the tetraethers. The lengths and steric demand of the linker only plays a minor role for the ester&#8208;based compounds, which can be prepared in reasonable yields and thus tested in proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept organic light&#8208;emitting diodes. Double ester&#8208;bridging allows deep blue electro&#8208;luminescence, highlighting the importance of the choice of the functional groups used for macrocyclization.</dc:description>

         <title>Deciphering iron&#8208;catalyzed C&#8211;H amination with organic azides:&#160;

N2&#160;cleavage from a stable organoazide complex</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Catalytic C&#8211;N bond formation by direct activation of C&#8211;H groups offers wide synthetic potential. En route to C&#8211;H amination, complexes with organic azides are critical precursors towards the reactive nitrene intermediate. Despite their relevance, only&#160;&#945;&#8208;N coordinated organoazide complexes are scarce in general, and elusive with iron, although iron complexes are by far the most active catalysts for C&#8211;H amination with organoazides. Herein, we report the synthesis of a stable iron&#160;&#945;&#8208;N coordinated organoazide complex from Fe(N(SiMe3)2)2&#160;and AdN3&#160;(Ad = 1&#8208;adamantyl) and its crystallographic, IR, NMR and M&#246;ssbauer spectroscopic characterization. These analyses revealed that the organoazide is in fast equilibrium between the free and coordinated state (Keq&#160;= 62). Photo&#8208;crystallography experiments showed gradual dissociation of N2, which imparted an Fe&#8211;N bond length increase and correspond to structural snapshots of the formation of an iron imido/nitrene complex. Reactivity of the organoazide complex in solution showed complete loss of N2, and subsequent formation of a C&#8211;H aminated product via nitrene insertion into a C&#8211;H bond of the N(SiMe3)2&#160;ligand. Monitoring this reaction by&#160;1H NMR spectroscopy indicates the transient formation of the imido/nitrene intermediate, which was supported by zero&#8208;field M&#246;ssbauer spectroscopy in frozen solution.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>NIR&#8208;II fluorescence imaging&#8208;guided photothermal therapy (PTT) has been widely investigated due to its great application potential in tumor theranostics. PTT is an effective and non&#8208;invasive tumor treatment method that can adapt to tumor hypoxia; nevertheless, simple and effective strategies are still desired to develop new materials with excellent PTT properties to meet the clinical requirements. In this work, we arise a bromine&#8208;substitution strategy to enhance the PTT of A&#8208;D&#8208;A&#8217;&#8208;D&#8208;A &#960;&#8208;conjugated molecules. The experimental results reveal that bromine&#8208;substitution can notably enhance the absorptivity (&#949;) and photothermal conversion efficiency (PCE) of the &#960;&#8208;conjugated molecules, resulting in the brominated molecules generating two&#8208;fold more heat (&#949;808 nm &#215; PCE) compared with the non&#8208;substituted counterpart. We declare that the enhanced photothermal properties of bromine&#8208;substituted &#960;&#8208;conjugated molecules are a combined outcome of the heavy&#8208;atom effect, enhanced ICT effect, and bromine&#8208;mediate more intense intermolecular &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking. Finally, the NIR&#8208;II tumor imaging capability and efficient PTT tumor ablation of the brominated &#960;&#8208;conjugated materials demonstrate that bromine&#8208;substitution will become a promising strategy for developing high&#8208;performance NIR&#8208;II imaging&#8208;guided PTT agents in the future.</dc:description>

         <title>Chemo&#8208;Enzymatic Synthesis of Isomeric I&#8208;branched Polylactosamines using Traceless Blocking Groups</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Poly&#8208;N&#8208;acetyl lactosamines (polyLacNAc) are common structural motifs of N&#8208; and O&#8208;linked glycan, glycosphingolipids and human milk oligosaccharides. They can be branched by the addition of &#946;1,6&#8208;linked N&#8208;acetyl&#8208;glucosamine (GlcNAc) moieties to internal galactoside (Gal) residues by the I&#8208;branching enzyme beta&#8208;1,6&#8208;N&#8208;acetylglucosaminyltransferase 2 (GCNT2). I&#8208;branching has been implicated in many biological processes and is also associated with various diseases such as cancer progression. Currently, there is a lack of methods that can install, in a regioselective manner, I&#8208;branches and allows the preparation of isomeric poly&#8208;LacNAc derivatives. Here, we described a chemo&#8208;enzymatic strategy that addresses this deficiency and is based in the enzymatic assembly of an oligo&#8208;LacNAc chain that at specific positions is modified by a GlcNTFA moiety. Replacement of the trifluoroacetyl (TFA) moiety by tert&#8208;butyloxycarbonyl (Boc) gives compounds in which the galactoside at the proximal site is blocked from modification by GCNT2. After elaboration of the antennae, the Boc group can be removed, and the resulting amine acetylated to give natural I&#8208;branched structures. It is also shown that fucosides can function as a traceless blocking group that can provide complementary I&#8208;branched structures from a single precursor. The methodology made it possible to synthesize a library of polyLacNAc chains having various topologies.</dc:description>

         <title>Regulating the Interfacial Charge Density by Constructing a Novel Zn Anode&#8208;Electrolyte Interface for Highly Reversible Zn Anode</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs) have attracted considerable attention. However, due to the uneven distribution of charge density at Zn anode|electrolyte interface, severe dendrites and corrosion are generated during cycling. In this work, a facile and scalable strategy to address the above&#8208;mentioned issues has been proposed through regulating the charge density at Zn anode|electrolyte interface. As a proof of concept, amidinothiourea (ATU) with abundant lone&#8208;pair electrons is employed as an interfacial charge modifier for Zn anode|electrolyte interface. The uniform and increased interfacial charge distribution on Zn anode|electrolyte interface has been obtained. Moreover, the unique Zn&#8208;bond constructed between N atoms and Zn2+ as well as the hydrogen bonds are formed among ATU and Ac&#8208; anion/active H2O, which promote the migration and desolvation behavior of Zn2+ at anode|electrolyte interface. Accordingly, at a trace concentration of 0.01 mg mL&#8208;1 ATU, these features endow Zn anode with a long cycling life (more than 800 h), and a high average Columbic efficiency (99.52%) for Zn||Cu batteries. When pairing with I2 cathode, the improved cycling ability (5000 cycles) with capacity retention of 77.9% is achieved. The fundamental understanding on the regulation of charge density at anode|electrolyte interface can facilitate the development of AZIBs.</dc:description>

         <title>Computational design of &#945;&#8208;conotoxins to target specific nicotinic acetylcholine receptor subtypes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) are drug targets for neurological diseases and disorders, but selective targeting of the large number of nAChR subtypes is challenging. Marine cone snail &#945;&#8208;conotoxins are potent blockers of nAChRs and some have been engineered to achieve subtype selectivity. This engineering effort would benefit from rapid computational methods able to predict mutational energies, but current approaches typically require high&#8208;resolution experimental structures, which are not widely available for &#945;&#8208;conotoxin complexes. Here, we benchmarked five mutational energy prediction methods using crystallographic and mutational data on two acetylcholine binding protein/&#945;&#8208;conotoxin systems. We developed molecular models for six nAChR subtypes in complex with five &#945;&#8208;conotoxins that were studied through 150 substitutions. We determined that the best method was a combination of FoldX and molecular dynamics simulations, resulting in a predictive Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) of 0.68 (85% accuracy). Novel &#945;&#8208;conotoxin mutants designed using this method were successfully validated by experimental assay with improved pharmaceutical properties. This work paves the way for the rapid design of subtype&#8208;specific nAChR ligands and potentially accelerated drug development.</dc:description>

         <title>Molecular Adhesion of a Pilus&#8208;derived Peptide Involved in Pseudomonas aeruginosa Biofilm Formation on non&#8208;polar ZnO Surfaces</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Bacterial colonization and biofilm formation on abiotic surfaces are initiated by the adhesion of peptides and proteins. Understanding the adhesion of such peptides and proteins at a molecular level thus represents an important step toward controlling and suppressing biofilm formation on technological and medical materials. This study investigates the molecular adhesion of a pilus&#8208;derived peptide that facilitates biofilm formation of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a multidrug&#8208;resistant opportunistic pathogen frequently encountered in healthcare settings. Single&#8208;molecule force spectroscopy (SMFS) was performed on chemically etched ZnO surfaces to gather insights about peptide adsorption force and its kinetics. Metal&#8208;free click chemistry for the fabrication of peptide&#8208;terminated SMFS cantilevers was performed on amine&#8208;terminated gold cantilevers and verified by X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and polarization&#8208;modulated infrared reflection absorption spectroscopy (PM&#8208;IRRAS). Atomic force microscopy (AFM) and XPS analyses reveal stable topographies and surface chemistries of the substrates that are not affected by SMFS. Rupture events described by the worm&#8208;like chain model (WLC) up to 600 pN were detected for the non&#8208;polar ZnO(11&#8208;20) surfaces. The dissociation barrier energy at zero force &#916;G(0), the transition state distance xb and bound&#8208;unbound dissociation rate at zero force koff(0) for the single crystalline substrate indicate that coordination and hydrogen bonds dominate the peptide/surface interaction.</dc:description>

         <title>Extremely Slow Thermally&#8208;induced Spin Crossover in the Two&#8208;dimensional Network [Fe(bbtr)3](BF4)2</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cooling [Fe(bbtr)3](BF4)2 (bbtr=1,4&#8208;di(1,2,3&#8208;triazol&#8208;1&#8208;yl)butane) triggers very slow spin crossover below 80 K (T1/2&#8595; = 76 K). The spin crossover (SCO) is accompanied by a hysteresis loop &#8232;(T1/2&#8593; = 89 K). In contrast to isostructural perchlorate analogue [Fe(bbtr)3](ClO4)2 in which spin crossover during cooling is preceded by phase transition at TPT=126 K in tetrafluoroborate phase transition does not occur to the beginning of spin crossover (80 K). Studies of mixed crystals [Fe(bbtr)3](BF4)2(1&#8208;x)(ClO4)2x (0.5&#8804;x&#8804;0.9) showed that a phase transition precedes spin crossover, however, for x &#8773; 0.46 intersection of T1/2(x) and TPT(x) dependencies takes place. The application of pressure of 1 GPa shifts the spin crossover in [Fe(bbtr)3](BF4)2 to a temperature above 270 K. High&#8208;pressure studies of neat tetrafluoroborate and perchlorate, as well as mixed crystals [Fe(bbtr)3](BF4)2(1&#8208;x)(ClO4)2x (0.1&#8804;x&#8804;0.9), revealed that at 295 K P1/2 value changes linearly with x indicating similar mechanism of spin crossover under elevated pressure in all systems under investigation. Variable pressure single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction studies confirmed that in contrast to thermally induced spin crossover undergoing differently in tetrafluoroborate and perchlorate an application of high pressure removes this differentiation leading to a similar mechanism depending at first on start spin crossover and then P&#8208;3&#8594;P&#8208;1 phase transition occurs.</dc:description>

High-pressure studies of neat tetrafluoroborate and perchlorate, as well as mixed crystals [Fe(bbtr)3](BF4)2(1-x)(ClO4)2x (0.1&#8804;x&#8804;0.9), revealed that at 295 K P1/2 value changes linearly with x indicating similar mechanism of spin crossover under elevated pressure in all systems under investigation. Variable pressure single crystal X-ray diffraction studies confirmed that in contrast to thermally induced spin crossover undergoing differently in tetrafluoroborate and perchlorate an application of high pressure removes this differentiation leading to a similar mechanism depending at first on start spin crossover and then P-3&#8594;P-1 phase transition occurs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Nanocomposite Hydrogels with Self&#8208;Assembling Peptide&#8208;Functionalized Carbon Nanostructures</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Carbon nanostructures (CNS) morphology and functionalization effects are studied to attain nanocomposite and supramolecular hydrogels with a self&#8208;assembling tripeptide. The latter is covalently anchored onto carbon nanotubes and carbon nanohorns, and the resulting nanocomposite soft matter is characterized at the nanoscale and macroscale to rationalize the self&#8208;healing ability of the hydrogel, and the CNS influence on peptide fibrillation in aqueous buffer.







Abstract
Carbon nanostructures (CNSs) are attractive components to attain nanocomposites, yet their hydrophobic nature and strong tendency to aggregate often limit their use in aqueous conditions and negatively impact their properties. In this work, carbon nanohorns (CNHs), multi&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes (CNTs), and graphene (G) are first oxidized, and then reacted to covalently anchor the self&#8208;assembling tripeptide L&#8208;Leu&#8208;D&#8208;Phe&#8208;D&#8208;Phe to improve their dispersibility in phosphate buffer, and favor the formation of hydrogels formed by the self&#8208;organizing L&#8208;Leu&#8208;D&#8208;Phe&#8208;D&#8208;Phe present in solution. The obtained nanocomposites are then characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), oscillatory rheology, and conductivity measurements to gain useful insights as to the key factors that determine self&#8208;healing ability for the future design of this type of nanocomposites.

         <title>Poly(arylene iminoborane)s, Analogues of Poly(arylene vinylene) with a BN&#8208;Doped Backbone: A Comprehensive Study</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polymers, copolymers, and oligomers from combinations of backbone&#8208;BN&#8208;doped poly(p&#8208;phenylene vinylene) (PPV) and poly(thiophene vinylene) (PTV) with tailored properties have been prepared by a modular approach. The &#960;&#8208;conjugated donor&#8208;acceptor&#8208;type backbone structure gives rise to efficient solid&#8208;state emission and aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) behavior.







Abstract
Despite the great success of the concept of doping organic compounds with BN units to access new materials with tailored properties, its use in polymer chemistry has only been realized quite recently. Herein, we present a comprehensive study of oligo&#8208; and poly(arylene iminoborane)s comprising a backbone of phenylene or thiophene moieties, as well as combinations thereof, linked via B=N units. The novel polymers can be regarded as BN analogues of poly(p&#8208;phenylene vinylene) (PPV) or poly(thiophene vinylene) (PTV) or their copolymers. Our modular synthetic approach allowed us to prepare four polymers and 12 monodisperse oligomers with modulated electronic properties. Alternating electron&#8208;releasing diaminoarylene and electron&#8208;accepting diborylarylene building blocks gave rise to a pronounced donor&#8208;acceptor character. Effective &#960;&#8208;conjugation over the arylene iminoborane backbone is evidenced by systematic bathochromic shifts of the low&#8208;energy UV&#8208;vis absorption maximum with increasing chain length, which is furthermore supported by crystallographic and computational investigations. Furthermore, all compounds investigated show emission of visible light in the solid state and aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) behavior, due to the presence of partially flexible linear B=N linkages in the backbone.

         <title>Synthesis of 10&#8208;Membered Azecines through Pd&#8208;Catalyzed Formal [6+4] Cycloaddition and Their Transannular Reaction to Polycyclic Compounds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Catalytic formal [6+4] cycloaddition was developed for the synthesis of 10&#8208;membered azecines. Under palladium catalysis, the reaction of &#948;&#8208;vinylvalerolactones and benzofuran&#8208;derived azadienes proceeds smoothly to afford benzofuran&#8208;fused azecines with high diastereoselectivity in moderate to good yields. The unique transformations involving the transannular reaction of these compounds was also demonstrated.







Abstract
Azecine fragments are frequently presented in natural products and bioactive compounds. However, minor efforts have been devoted to these 10&#8208;membered N&#8208;heterocycles, and their synthesis is still challenging. Reported herein is the first catalytic formal [6+4] cycloaddition for the synthesis of 10&#8208;membered azecines. Under palladium catalysis, the reaction of &#948;&#8208;vinylvalerolactones and benzofuran&#8208;derived azadienes proceeds smoothly to afford benzofuran&#8208;fused azecines with high diastereoselectivity in moderate to good yields. A unique transannular reaction of these 10&#8208;membered azecines for the construction of polycyclic compounds is also demonstrated.

         <title>Encapsulation in Charged Droplets Generates Distorted Host&#8208;Guest Complexes
</title>

         <dc:description>
&#8220;Spring&#8208;loaded&#8221; resorcinarene capsules form in charged droplets. The complexes are not observed in solution and form during electrospray ionisation under conditions violating electroneutrality. The strained resorcinarene and dicationic guest complexes survive due to strengthening of non&#8208;covalent bonds in the gas&#8208;phase enabling structural assignment via different tandem mass spectrometry techniques.







Abstract
The ability of various hydrogen&#8208;bonded resorcinarene&#8208;based capsules to bind &#945;,&#969;&#8208;alkylbisDABCOnium (DnD) guests of different lengths was investigated in solution and in the gas&#8208;phase. While no host&#8208;guest interactions were detected in solution, encapsulation could be achieved in the charged droplets formed during electrospray ionisation (ESI). This included guests, which are far too long in their most stable conformation to fit inside the cavity of the capsules. A combination of three mass spectrometric techniques, namely, collision&#8208;induced dissociation, hydrogen/deuterium exchange, and ion&#8208;mobility mass spectrometry, together with computational modelling allow us to determine the binding mode of the DnD guests inside the cavity of the capsules. Significant distortions of the guest into horseshoe&#8208;like arrangements are required to optimise cation&#8208;&#960; interactions with the host, which also adopt distorted geometries with partially open hydrogen&#8208;bonding seams when binding longer guests. Such quasi &#8220;spring&#8208;loaded&#8221; capsules can form in the charged droplets during the ESI process as there is no competition between guest encapsulation and ion pair formation with the counterions that preclude encapsulation in solution. The encapsulation complexes are sufficiently stable in the gas&#8208;phase &#8211; even when strained &#8211; because non&#8208;covalent interactions significantly strengthen in the absence of solvent.

         <title>Chalcogen Bond Catalysis with Telluronium Cations for Bromination Reaction: Importance of Electrostatic and Polarization Effects</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The mechanism of bromination reaction based on chalcogen bond (ChB) catalysis was discussed and the importance of the electrostatic and polarization effects in the ChB is elucidated by high&#8208;level computational results. Moreover, the structure&#8208;property relationship between the strength of ChB bond, electrostatic effect, polarization effect and catalytic performance are established for the design of more efficient ChB catalysts.







Abstract
Recently, chalcogen bond catalysts with telluronium cations have garnered considerable attention in organic reactions. In this work, chalcogen bond catalysis on the bromination reaction of anisole with N&#8208;bromosuccinimide (NBS) with the telluronium cationic catalysts has been explored with density functional theory (DFT). The catalytic reaction is divided into two stages: the bromine transfer step and the proton transfer step. Based on the computational results, one can find the rate&#8208;determining step is the bromine transfer step. Moreover, the present study elucidates that a stronger chalcogen bond between catalysts and NBS will give better catalytic performance. Additionally, this work also clarified the importance of the electrostatic and polarization effects in the chalcogen bond between the oxygen atom of NBS and the Te atom of the catalyst in this bromination reaction. The electrostatic and polarization effects are significantly influenced by the electron&#8208;withdrawing ability of the substitution groups on the catalysts. Moreover, the structure&#8208;property relationship between the strength of chalcogen bond, electrostatic effect, polarization effect and catalytic performance are established for the design of more efficient chalcogen bond catalysts.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The mechanism of bromination reaction&lt;/b&gt; based on chalcogen bond (ChB) catalysis was discussed and the importance of the electrostatic and polarization effects in the ChB is elucidated by high-level computational results. Moreover, the structure-property relationship between the strength of ChB bond, electrostatic effect, polarization effect and catalytic performance are established for the design of more efficient ChB catalysts.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently, chalcogen bond catalysts with telluronium cations have garnered considerable attention in organic reactions. In this work, chalcogen bond catalysis on the bromination reaction of anisole with N-bromosuccinimide (NBS) with the telluronium cationic catalysts has been explored with density functional theory (DFT). The catalytic reaction is divided into two stages: the bromine transfer step and the proton transfer step. Based on the computational results, one can find the rate-determining step is the bromine transfer step. Moreover, the present study elucidates that a stronger chalcogen bond between catalysts and NBS will give better catalytic performance. Additionally, this work also clarified the importance of the electrostatic and polarization effects in the chalcogen bond between the oxygen atom of NBS and the Te atom of the catalyst in this bromination reaction. The electrostatic and polarization effects are significantly influenced by the electron-withdrawing ability of the substitution groups on the catalysts. Moreover, the structure-property relationship between the strength of chalcogen bond, electrostatic effect, polarization effect and catalytic performance are established for the design of more efficient chalcogen bond catalysts.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Optimization of a 1,4,7&#8208;Triazacyclononane&#8208;1,4&#8208;diacetic acid (NODA) Derivative Radiofluorination by Al18F Complexation Using a Design of Experiments Approach</title>

Lesser, better, faster: Optimization of a radiolabeling method by complexation of aluminum&#8208;[18F]fluoride {Al18F} species using a Design of Experiments (DoE) approach is presented. This study demonstrates the potential of this strategy in radiochemistry for optimization of a radiochemical process.







Abstract
Fluorine&#8208;18 (18F) is the most favorable positron emitter for radiolabeling Positron Emission Tomography (PET) probes. However, conventional 18F labeling through covalent C&#8722;F bond formation is challenging, involving multiple steps and stringent conditions unsuitable for sensitive biomolecular probes whose integrity may be altered. Over the past decade, an elegant new approach has been developed involving the coordination of an aluminum fluoride {Al18F} species in aqueous media at a late&#8208;stage of the synthetic process. The objective of this study was to implement this method and to optimize radiolabeling efficiency using a Design of Experiments (DoE). To assess the impact of various experimental parameters on {Al18F} incorporation, a pentadentate chelating agent NODA&#8208;MP&#8208;C4 was prepared as a model compound. This model carried a thiourea function present in the final conjugates resulting from the grafting of the chelating agent onto the probe. The formation of the radioactive complex Al18F&#8208;NODA&#8208;MP&#8208;C4 was studied to achieve the highest radiochemical conversion. A complementary &#8220;cold&#8221; series study using the natural isotope 19F was also conducted to guide the radiochemical operating conditions. Ultimately, Al18F&#8208;NODA&#8208;MP&#8208;C4 was obtained with a reproducible and satisfactory radiochemical conversion of 79&#177;3.5&#8201;% (n=5).

         <title>Ruthenium and Iron Co&#8208;doped Molybdenum Carbide as a Stable Hydrogen Evolution Electrocatalyst in Harsh Electrolyte</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ru and Fe co&#8208;doped Mo2C electrocatalyst (Ru&#8208;Fe/Mo2C@NC) was synthesized via a controllable two&#8208;step method for efficient and persistent hydrogen evolution reaction in harsh electrolyte. The synergistic effect between Ru, Fe dopants and Mo2C resulted in a remarkably enhanced hydrogen evolution performance of the electrocatalyst in both acidic and alkaline electrolyte.







Abstract
Electrocatalytic water splitting is one of the most commercially valuable pathways of hydrogen production especially combined with renewable electricity; however, efficient and durable electrocatalysts are urgently needed to reduce electric energy consumption. Here, we reported a Ru and Fe co&#8208;doped Mo2C on nitrogen doped carbon via a controllable two&#8208;step method, which can be used for efficient and enduring hydrogen evolution reaction. At 10, 100 and 200&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in acidic electrolyte, the resultant Ru&#8208;Fe/Mo2C@NC delivered low overpotentials of 31, 78 and 103&#8197;mV, respectively, which are comparable to that of the commercial Pt/C (20&#8197;wt&#8201;%). At an applied current density of 100&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, stable hydrogen production was conducted for 120&#8197;h without obvious degradation. In alkaline media, Ru&#8208;Fe/Mo2C@NC can also deliver a current density of 100&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 for more than 100&#8197;h. Furthermore, the Ru&#8208;Fe/Mo2C@NC electrocatalyst was used as cathode in an anion exchange membrane water electrolyzer under industrial environments for robust hydrogen production. The characterization and electrochemical results prove the synergism effects between Ru, Fe dopants and Mo2C for promoting hydrogen evolution activity. This work would pave a new avenue to fabricate low&#8208;cost, high&#8208;performance hydrogen evolution electrocatalysts for industrial water electrolyzers.

         <title>Modern Potentiometric Biosensing Based on Non&#8208;Equilibrium Measurement Techniques</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The introduction of bioreceptors, new sensing concepts, and a deeper theoretical understanding of the potentiometric responses of ISEs encourages innovations in potentiometric biosensing applications. Dynamic responses based on non&#8208;equilibrium measurement techniques under zero&#8208;current conditions and stimulus&#8208;controlled modes offer fruitful information that can be automatically analyzed by artificial intelligence technology.







Abstract
Modern potentiometric sensors based on polymeric membrane ion&#8208;selective electrodes (ISEs) have achieved new breakthroughs in sensitivity, selectivity, and stability and have extended applications in environmental surveillance, medical diagnostics, and industrial analysis. Moreover, nonclassical potentiometry shows promise for many applications and opens up new opportunities for potentiometric biosensing. Here, we aim to provide a concept to summarize advances over the past decade in the development of potentiometric biosensors with polymeric membrane ISEs. This Concept article articulates sensing mechanisms based on non&#8208;equilibrium measurement techniques. In particular, we emphasize new trends in potentiometric biosensing based on attractive dynamic approaches. Representative examples are selected to illustrate key applications under zero&#8208;current conditions and stimulus&#8208;controlled modes. More importantly, fruitful information obtained from non&#8208;equilibrium measurements with dynamic responses can be useful for artificial intelligence (AI). The combination of ISEs with advanced AI techniques for effective data processing is also discussed. We hope that this Concept will illustrate the great possibilities offered by non&#8208;equilibrium measurement techniques and AI in potentiometric biosensing and encourage further innovations in this exciting field.

         <title>Impact of Truncation on Optoelectronic Properties of Azaborole Helicenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Removal of C=C bonds from azabora[7]helicenes strongly impacts their optoelectronic properties. The truncated compounds show photoluminescence quantum yields of up to 0.53 in the solid state and phosphorescence with lifetimes of up to ~0.5&#8197;s. A methyl complex of azabora[7]helicene was used as a chiral inducer embedded in an emissive polymer (F8BT) to produce CP&#8208;OLEDs with gEL of 0.54.







Abstract
Herein, we report configurationally stable singly&#8208;truncated (ST) and structurally flexible doubly&#8208;truncated (DT) helically chiral compounds derived from azabora[7]helicenes by a hypothetical removal of a single or two C=C double bonds. The singly&#8208;truncated constitutional isomers were synthesized from either benzoisoquinoline (BIQ) or phenantherene building blocks and the corresponding biaryls in excellent yields to give azabora[5]helicenes with a pendant phenyl ring at a sterically hindered position. These systems highlight the electronic impact of the nitrogen donor substitution position. The compounds with a disrupted BIQ moiety (STN) possess remarkable photoluminescence quantum yields of up to 0.53 in the solid state and a blue emission in solution with dissymmetry factors of up to ca. 3&#215;10&#8722;3. Upon cooling to 79&#8197;K all compounds exhibit phosphorescence with lifetimes of up to ca. 0.5&#8197;s.

         <title>Late&#8208;Stage C&#8722;H Activation of Drug (Derivative) Molecules with Pd(ll) Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review emphasizes and comprehensively analyses representative examples of palladium(II)&#8208;catalyzed late&#8208;stage C&#8722;H activation reactions and demonstrates their efficacy in converting C&#8722;H bonds at multiple positions within drug (derivative) molecules into diverse functional groups. Specifically, this study elucidates the notable strides made in the realm of late&#8208;stage C&#8722;H activation of drug (derivatives) molecules employing Pd (II) catalysts.







Abstract
This review comprehensively analyses representative examples of Pd(II)&#8208;catalyzed late&#8208;stage C&#8722;H activation reactions and demonstrates their efficacy in converting C&#8722;H bonds at multiple positions within drug (derivative) molecules into diverse functional groups. These transformative reactions hold immense potential in medicinal chemistry, enabling the efficient and selective functionalization of specific sites within drug molecules, thereby enhancing their pharmacological activity and expanding the scope of potential drug candidates. Although notable articles have focused on late&#8208;stage C&#8722;H functionalization reactions of drug&#8208;like molecules using transition&#8208;metal catalysts, reviews specifically focusing on late&#8208;stage C&#8722;H functionalization reactions of drug (derivative) molecules using Pd(II) catalysts are required owing to their prominence as the most widely utilized metal catalysts for C&#8722;H activation and their ability to introduce a myriad of functional groups at specific C&#8722;H bonds. The utilization of Pd&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H activation methodologies demonstrates impressive success in introducing various functional groups, such as cyano (CN), fluorine (F), chlorine (Cl), aromatic rings, olefin, alkyl, alkyne, and hydroxyl groups, to drug (derivative) molecules with high regioselectivity and functional&#8208;group tolerance. These breakthroughs in late&#8208;stage C&#8722;H activation reactions serve as invaluable tools for drug discovery and development, thereby offering strategic options to optimize drug candidates and drive the exploration of innovative therapeutic solutions.

         <title>Construction and Hierarchical Self&#8208;Assembly of a Supramolecular Metal&#8211;Carbene Complex with Multifunctional Units</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multifunctional metal&#8211;carbene assembly comprising three crown ether and three ferrocene units close to each other was developed. The introduction of ammonium salts caused crown ether blocks to move far away from the electrochemical center, regulating the redox properties. Using bisammonium salts as cross&#8208;linked agents and metal&#8722;carbene complexes as cores can form a stimulus&#8208;responsive and self&#8208;healing supramolecular gel.







Abstract
Hierarchical combinations involving metal&#8211;ligand interactions and host&#8722;guest interactions can consolidate building blocks with unique functions into material properties. This study reports the construction and hierarchical self&#8208;assembly of multifunctional trinuclear AuI tricarbene complex containing three crown ether units and three ferrocene units. Host&#8722;guest interactions between the multifunctional trinuclear AuI tricarbene complex and organic ammonium salts were investigated, revealing that crown ether&#8208;based host&#8722;guest interactions can effectively regulate the electrochemical properties of the complex. Utilizing bisammonium salt as the cross&#8208;linker and multifunctional trinuclear AuI tricarbene complex as the core, a stimuli&#8208;responsive and self&#8208;healing supramolecular gel with different functional units was obtained.

         <title>Highly Electrophilic Intermediates in the Bypass Mechanism of Glutathione Peroxidase: Synthesis, Reactivity, and Structures of Selenocysteine&#8208;Derived Cyclic Selenenyl Amides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The crystal structures and reactivities of selenocysteine&#8208;derived cyclic selenenyl amides have been elucidated. The results obtained here suggest that they can serve not only as protective forms to suppress the degradation of the active center in glutathione peroxidase but also as highly electrophilic intermediates in the several reactions of selenoproteins.







Abstract
Selenocysteine (Sec)&#8208;derived cyclic selenenyl amides, formed by the intramolecular cyclization of Sec selenenic acids (Sec&#8211;SeOHs), have been postulated to function as protective forms in the bypass mechanism of glutathione peroxidase (GPx). However, their chemical properties have not been experimentally elucidated in proteins or small&#8208;molecule systems. Recently, we reported the first nuclear magnetic resonance observation of Sec&#8211;SeOHs and their cyclization to the corresponding cyclic selenenyl amides by using selenopeptide model systems incorporated in a molecular cradle. Herein, we elucidate the structures and reactivities of Sec&#8208;derived cyclic selenenyl amides. The crystal structures and reactions toward a cysteine thiol or a 1,3&#8208;diketone&#8208;type chemical probe indicated the highly electrophilic character of cyclic selenenyl amides. This suggests that they can serve not only as protective forms to suppress the inactivation of Sec&#8211;SeOHs in GPx but also as highly electrophilic intermediates in the reactions of selenoproteins.

         <title>Gas&#8208;Phase Alkali&#8208;Metal Cation Affinities of Stabilized Enolates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The alkali&#8208;metal cation affinities of a series of stabilized enolate anions were determined by a combination of gas&#8208;phase experiments and quantum chemical calculations. Both methods afford values in excellent agreement and show how the derived affinities result from the subtle interplay of electronic and conformational effects.







Abstract
The chemistry of alkali&#8208;metal enolates is dominated by ion pairing. To improve our understanding of the intrinsic interactions between the alkali&#8208;metal cations and the enolate anions, we have applied Cooks&#8217; kinetic method to determine relative M+ (M=Li, Na, K) affinities of the stabilized enolates derived from acetylacetone, ethyl acetoacetate, diethyl malonate, ethyl cyanoacetate, 2&#8208;cyanoacetamide, and methyl malonate monoamide in the gas phase.

     alt="Gas-Phase Alkali-Metal Cation Affinities of Stabilized Enolates"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The alkali-metal cation&lt;/b&gt; affinities of a series of stabilized enolate anions were determined by a combination of gas-phase experiments and quantum chemical calculations. Both methods afford values in excellent agreement and show how the derived affinities result from the subtle interplay of electronic and conformational effects.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The chemistry of alkali-metal enolates is dominated by ion pairing. To improve our understanding of the intrinsic interactions between the alkali-metal cations and the enolate anions, we have applied Cooks&#8217; kinetic method to determine relative M&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; (M=Li, Na, K) affinities of the stabilized enolates derived from acetylacetone, ethyl acetoacetate, diethyl malonate, ethyl cyanoacetate, 2-cyanoacetamide, and methyl malonate monoamide in the gas phase. Quantum chemical calculations support the experimental results and moreover afford insight into the structures of the alkali-metal enolate complexes. The affinities decrease with increasing size of the alkali-metal cations, reflecting weaker electrostatic interactions and lower charge densities of the free M&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ions. For the different enolates, a comparison of their coordinating abilities is complicated by the fact that some of the free anions undergo conformational changes resulting in stabilizing intramolecular interactions. If these complicating effects are disregarded, the M&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; affinities correlate with the electron density of the chelating functionalities, that is, the carbonyl and/or the nitrile groups of the enolates. A comparison with the known association constants of the corresponding alkali-metal enolates in solution points to the importance of solvation effects for these systems.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Hexanuclear Ln6L6 Complex Formation by Using an Unsymmetric Ligand</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reduced symmetry ligand directs formation of hexanuclear lanthanide complex: Lanthanide ionic radius and counterions play a role in self&#8208;assembly of a hexagonal Ln6L6 complex. Structural assignment was achieved by NMR, mass spectrometry and homo&#8208;RIDME EPR experiments that identified three unique Gd&#8943;Gd distances. The Eu6L6 complex shows distinct photophysical features from the Eu2L3 complex generated with a related symmetric ligand.







Abstract
Multinuclear, self&#8208;assembled lanthanide complexes present clear opportunities as sensors and imaging agents. Despite the widely acknowledged potential of this class of supramolecule, synthetic and characterization challenges continue to limit systematic studies into their self&#8208;assembly restricting the number and variety of lanthanide architectures reported relative to their transition metal counterparts. Here we present the first study evaluating the effect of ligand backbone symmetry on multinuclear lanthanide complex self&#8208;assembly. Replacement of a symmetric ethylene linker with an unsymmetric amide at the center of a homoditopic ligand governs formation of an unusual Ln6L6 complex with coordinatively unsaturated metal centers. The choice of triflate as a counterion, and the effect of ionic radii are shown to be critical for formation of the Ln6L6 complex. The atypical Ln6L6 architecture is characterized using a combination of mass spectrometry, luminescence, DOSY NMR and EPR spectroscopy measurements. Luminescence experiments support clear differences between comparable Eu6L6 and Eu2L3 complexes, with relatively short luminescent lifetimes and low quantum yields observed for the Eu6L6 structure indicative of non&#8208;radiative decay processes. Synthesis of the Gd6L6 analogue allows three distinct Gd&#8943;Gd distance measurements to be extracted using homo&#8208;RIDME EPR experiments.

         <title>An In Situ Fabricated Hydrogel Polymer &#8211; Palladium Nanocomposite Electrocatalyst for the HER: Critical Role of the Polymer in Realizing High Efficiency and Stability</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanoelectrocatalyst in hydrogel: A novel and unique role of the hydrogel polymer matrix of an in&#8197;situ fabricated nanocomposite thin film (palladium&#8208;poly(2&#8208;hydroxyethyl methacrylate)) based catalytic electrode, in promoting hydrogen evolution in the water splitting reaction is demonstrated.







Abstract
Development of general and simple designs of catalytic electrodes for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is critical. The present work demonstrates the multiple roles played by a hydrogel polymer in the fabrication and activity enhancement of the nanoelectrocatalyst. A nanocomposite thin film of Pd with the insulating hydrogel, poly(2&#8208;hydroxyethyl methacrylate) (PHEMA), is fabricated through a facile in&#8197;situ process, the polymer itself functioning as the reducing/stabilizing agent in the formation of Pd nanoparticles. Pd&#8208;PHEMA on Ni foam enables efficient HER in alkaline medium with a low overpotential; the polymer enables the electrocatalysis by its swelling and confinement of the electrolyte. Most significantly, when the electrode is subjected to an optimized cycling protocol, the overpotential decreases steadily, reaching an impressively low value of 36&#8197;mV (@10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2). A low Tafel slope (68&#8197;mV&#8201;dec&#8722;1), high exchange current density, Faradaic efficiency and TOF (3.27&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, 99&#8201;%, 122.7&#8197;h&#8722;1), and extended stability are achieved. Detailed investigations reveal the active role of the polymer in the evolution of the nanocatalyst, itself undergoing favorable morphological changes. The study illustrates the widened scope for developing efficient and stable catalytic electrodes with hydrogel polymers and unique features that promote the generation of green hydrogen.

         <title>o&#8208;Hydroxyarylphosphanes: Strategies for Syntheses of Configurationally Stable, Electronically and Sterically Tunable Ambiphiles with Multiple Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>o&#8208;Hydroxyarylphosphanes are fascinating compounds by their multiple&#8208;reactivity features, attributed to the ambident hard and soft Lewis&#8208; and also Br&#248;nstedt acid&#8208;base properties, wide tuning opportunities via backbone substituents with &#177;mesomeric and inductive, at P and in o&#8208;position to P and O also steric effects, and in addition, the configurational stability at three&#8208;valent phosphorus. Air sensitivity may be overcome by reversible protection with BH3, but the easy oxidation to P(V)&#8208;compounds may also be used. Since the first reports on the title compounds ca. 50 years ago the multiple reactivity has led to versatile applications. This includes various P&#8208;E&#8208;O and P=C&#8208;O heterocycles, a multitude of O&#8208;substituted derivatives including acyl derivatives for traceless Staudinger couplings of biomolecules with labels or functional substituents, phosphane&#8208;phosphite ligands, which like the o&#8208;phosphanylphenols itself form a range of transition metal complexes and catalysts. Also main group metal complexes and (bi)arylphosphonium&#8208;organocatalysts are derived. Within this review the various strategies for the access of the starting materials are illuminated, including few hints to selected applications.</dc:description>

However, the rational design of BODIPY triplet chromophores by ab initio modelling is limited by their strong interactions of spin, electronic and vibrational dynamics. In particular, spin&#8208;vibronic coupling is often overlooked when estimating intersystem crossing (ISC) rates. In this study, we developed a combined experimental and theoretical approach using spin&#8208;vibronic coupling to correctly describe ISC in BODIPY dyes. For this purpose, we examined seven &#960;&#8208;extended BODIPY derivatives with iodine atoms in different positions. We found that the heavy&#8208;atom effect of iodine atoms is site&#8208;specific, causing high triplet yields in only some positions. This site&#8208;specific ISC was explained by El&#8208;Sayed rules, so both the contribution and character of the molecular orbitals involved in the excitation must be considered when predicting the ISC rates. Overall, the rational design of BODIPY triplet chromophores requires using (i) the high&#8208;quality electronic structure theory, including both static and dynamical correlations, and (ii) the two&#8208;component wave function Hamiltonian, and rationalizing (iii) ISC based on the character of the molecular orbitals of heavy atoms involved in the excitation, expanding El&#8208;Sayed rules beyond their traditional applications.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The construction of molecular photogears that can achieve through&#8208;space transmission of the unidirectional double&#8208;bond rotary motion of light&#8208;driven molecular motors onto a remote single&#8208;bond axis is a formidable challenge in the field of artificial molecular machines. Here, we present a proof&#8208;of&#8208;principle design of such photogears that is based on the possibility to use stereogenic substituents to control both the relative stabilities of two helical forms of the photogear and the double&#8208;bond photoisomerization reaction that connects them. The potential of the design is verified by quantum&#8208;chemical modeling through which photogearing is found to be a favorable process compared to free&#8208;standing single&#8208;bond rotation (&#8220;slippage&#8221;). Overall, our study unveils a surprisingly simple approach to realizing unidirectional photogearing.</dc:description>

         <title>Cage Match: Comparing the Anion Binding Ability of Isostructural Versus Isofunctional Pairs of Metal&#8208;Organic Nanocages</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Affinities of six anions (mesylate, acetate, trifluoroacetate, p&#8208;toluenecarboxylate, p&#8208;toluenesulfonate, and perfluorooctanoate) for three related Pt2+&#8208;linked porphyrin nanocages were measured to probe the influence of different noncovalent recognition motifs (e.g., hydrogen bonding, electrostatics, &#960; bonding) on anion binding. Two new hosts of M6L312+ (1b) and M4L28+ (2) composition (M = (en)Pt2+, L = (3&#8208;py)4porphyrin) were prepared in a one&#8208;pot synthesis and allowed comparison of hosts that differ in structure while maintaining similar N&#8208;H hydrogen&#8208;bond donor ability. Comparisons of isostructural hosts that differ in hydrogen&#8208;bonding ability were made between 1b and a related M6L312+ nanoprism (1a, M = (tmeda)Pt2+) that lacks N&#8208;H groups. Considerable variation in association constants (K1 = 1.6 x 103 M&#8208;1 to 1.3 x 108 M&#8208;1) and binding mode (exo vs. endo) were found for different host&#8208;guest combinations. Strongest binding was seen between ptoluenecarboxylate and 1b, but surprisingly, association of this guest with 1a was only slightly weaker despite the absence of NH&#8208;&#8208;&#8208;O interactions. The high affinity between p&#8208;toluenecarboxylate and 1a could be turned off by protonation, and this behavior was used to toggle between the binding of this guest and the environmental pollutant perfluorooctanoate, which otherwise has a lower affinity for the host.</dc:description>

         <title>Chiral Benzene Triimide (BTI) Radical Anions for Probing the Interplay of Unpaired Electron Spin and Chirality</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein a series of chiral BTI radical anions bearing different chiral substituents were efficiently prepared by chemical reduction. X&#8208;ray crystallography revealed finely&#8208;tuned packing and helix assemblies of the radicals by the size of chiral substituents in crystalline state. In accordance with the crystalline&#8208;state packing, the powder ESR spectra indicate that 4a&#8211;&#8226;CoCp2+ and 4c&#8211;&#8226;CoCp2+ &#960;&#8208;dimers exhibit thermally excited triplet states arising from strong spin&#8208;spin interactions, while discrete 4b&#8211;&#8226;CoCp2+ shows a broad doublet&#8208;state signal reflecting to weak spin&#8208;spin interactions. The interplay between the unpaired electron spin and chiral substituents was studied by UV&#8208;Vis&#8208;NIR spectra, electronic circular dichroism (ECD) and TD DFT calculations. Different NIR absorptions of the radicals attributing to isolated SOMO&#8594;LUMO+1 (~889 nm) transitions were recorded. The emergence of Cotton effects (CEs) at the NIR region for 4c&#8211;&#8226;CoCp2+ radical enantiomers suggest the interplay between chirality and unpaired electron spin. The origin of the different circularly polarized light absorptions regarding SOMO derived transitions (around 880 nm) was attributed to chiral substitutes regulated electric and magnetic transition dipole moments of the unpaired electron participated transition.</dc:description>

         <title>Unexpected Reduction of a Coordinated Diazapyridinophane Ligand bound to Chromium(III) Ion Leading to Delocalization of the Unpaired Electron across two Isolated Pyridine Units</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In the tetraazamacrocyclic ligand N,N&#8217;&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;2,11&#8208;diaza&#8208;[3.3](2,6)pyridinophane (L&#8208;N4Me2), the two pyridine units are separated from each other by sp3&#8208;hybridized triatomic bridges. Such electronically isolated pyridine moieties are considerably less prone to reductions than di&#8208; or triimines. A detailed structural, magnetic, and spectroscopic investigation of the complexes [Cr(L&#8208;N4Me2)(OAc)2] and [Cr(L&#8208;N4Me2)(OAc)2](PF6), in combination with theoretical calculations, reveals that the reduced complex must be described as a chromium(III) ion coordinated to the anionic radical ligand (L&#8208;N4Me2&#8226;)1&#8208; rather than a low&#8208;spin chromium(II) ion bound to closed&#8208;shell ligands. Thus, it is, to the best of our knowledge, only the second example of a stable and structurally characterized metal complex containing a reduced isolated pyridine unit. The stability is attributed to the delocalization of the unpaired electron across the two pyridine units, mediated by their interaction to the metal ion.</dc:description>

         <title>Altering the Localization of an Unpaired Spin in a Formal Ni(V) Species</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The participation of both ligand and the metal center in the redox events has been recognized as one of the ways to attain the formal high valent complexes for the late 3d metals, such as Ni and Cu. Such an approach has been employed successfully to stabilize a Ni(III) bisphenoxyl diradical species in which there exist an equilibrium between the ligand and the Ni localized resultant spin. The present work however broadens the scope of the previously reported three oxidized equivalent species by conveying the approaches that tend to affect the reported equilibrium in CH3CN at 233 K. Various spectroscopic characterization revealed that employing exogenous N&#8208;donor ligands like 1&#8208;methyl imidazole and pyridine favors the formation of the Ni centered localized spin though axial binding. In contrast, due to its steric hinderance, quinoline favors an exclusive ligand localized radical species. DFT studies shed light on the novel intermediates' complex electronic structure. Further, the three oxidized equivalent species with the Ni centered spin was examined for its hydrogen atom abstraction ability stressing their key role in alike reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Facile Synthesis of Multifunctional Ni(OH)2&#8208;Supported Core&#8208;Shell Ni@Pd Nanocomposites for the Electro&#8208;Oxidation of Small Organic Molecules</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Ni(OH)2 formed by the spontaneous hydrolyzation of metallic Ni can prevent the aggregation of active core&#8208;shell Ni@Pd nanoparticles. At the same time, the Ni(OH)2 substrate is naturally active in the dissociation of H2O to generate OHads species. Consequently, the as&#8208;prepared Ni(OH)2/Ni@Pd nanocomposites is promising for the electrocatalytic oxidation of alcohols.







Abstract
In the domain of proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs), the development of efficient and durable catalysts for the electro&#8208;oxidation of small organic molecules, especially of alcohols (methanol, ethanol, ethylene glycol, et&#8197;al.) has always been a hot topic. A large number of related electrocatalysts with splendid performance have been designed and synthesized till now, while the preparation processes of most of them are demanding on experimental operations and conditions. Herein, we put forward a facile and handy method for the preparation of multifunctional Ni(OH)2&#8208;supported core&#8208;shell Ni@Pd nanocomposites (Ni(OH)2/Ni@Pd NCs) with the assistance of galvanic replacement reaction (GRR) at room temperature and ambient pressure. As expected, the Ni(OH)2 substrate can prevent the aggregation of core&#8208;shell (CS) Ni@Pd nanoparticles (NPs) and inhibit the formation of COads and further prevent Pd from being poisoned. The synergistic effect between CS Ni@Pd NPs and Ni(OH)2 substrate and the electronic effect between Pd shell and Ni core contribute to the outstanding electrocatalytic performance for methanol, ethanol, and ethylene glycol oxidation in alkaline condition. This study provides a succinct method for the design and preparation of efficient Pd&#8208;based electrocatalysts for alcohol electro&#8208;oxidation.

Easily accessible crosslinking ethynylbenziodazolone (EBZ) JW&#8208;AM&#8208;005 enables the conjugation of peptides and proteins through the selective linkage of cysteine residues. Peptide dimers or stapled peptides were obtained under mild and tuneable conditions. The rebridging of antibody fragments was also performed in a one&#8208;pot three&#8208;reaction process with high regioselectivity, outperforming the standard reagents commonly used for this transformation.







Abstract
Peptide and protein bioconjugation sees ever&#8208;growing applications in the pharmaceutical sector. Novel strategies and reagents that can address the chemo&#8208; and regioselectivity issues inherent to these biomolecules, while delivering stable and functionalizable conjugates, are therefore needed. Herein, we introduce the crosslinking ethynylbenziodazolone (EBZ) reagent JW&#8208;AM&#8208;005 for the conjugation of peptides and proteins through the selective linkage of cysteine residues. This easily accessed compound gives access to peptide dimers or stapled peptides under mild and tuneable conditions. Applied to the antibody fragment of antigen binding (Fab) species, JW&#8208;AM&#8208;005 delivered rebridged proteins in a one&#8208;pot three&#8208;reaction process with high regioselectivity, outperforming the standard reagents commonly used for this transformation.

         <title>Synthesis of Functional Isosorbide&#8208;Based Polyesters and Polyamides by Passerini Three&#8208;Component Polymerization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Passerini Three&#8208;Component polymerization was employed to synthesize functional isosorbide&#8208;based polyesters and polyamides using dicarboxylic acid modified isosorbide. By precisely controlling the backbone structure and side groups, a series of functional polymers were successfully obtained, thereby establishing a versatile platform for the production of isosorbide&#8208;based polymers.







Abstract
Environmental issues are becoming more and more prominent, and bio&#8208;based polymers are essential to alleviate environmental degradation by replacing traditional polymers. With this context, a new family of functional isosorbide&#8208;based polyesters and polyamides with high glass transition temperature are prepared via Passerini&#8208;Three component polymerization (P&#8208;3CP). To optimize the P&#8208;3CP conditions, the influence of the polymerization solvent, temperature, feed ratio on the molar mass of final polymers are investigated. The higher molar mass (up to 10100&#8197;g/mol) and yield (&gt;70&#8201;%) are achieved under very mild conditions (30&#8201;&#176;C, standard atmosphere). Functional side groups, such as alkenyl, alkynyl and methyl ester, were introduced into polymer structure via P&#8208;3CP by using functional isocyanides. The obtained polyesters and polyamides are characterized by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and infrared (IR) spectroscopies, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA). All polymers are thermal stable and amorphous with variable glass transition temperatures (Tg). The obtained polyester has Tg up to 87.5&#8201;&#176;C, while the Tg of polyamides (ISPA&#8208;2) is detected to be 97.5&#8201;&#176;C depending on the amide bonds in the polymer backbone and the benzene ring side groups. The cytotoxicity is investigated by the CCK&#8208;8 assay against mBMSC cells to confirm the biological safety. Overall, this novel strategy provides an efficient approach to produce functional isosorbide&#8208;based polyesters and polyamides, which are promising prospect for being applied to biodegradable materials.

         <title>Pioneering the Power of Twin Bonds in a Revolutionary Double Bond Formation. Unveiling the True Identity of o&#8208;Carboryne as o&#8208;Carborene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Experimental and computational evidence shows that despite the similarity of o&#8208;carboryne and o&#8208;benzyne, the nature of the C&#8722;C bond generated between two adjacent carbons that lose H atoms is different. While in o&#8208;benzyne the C&#8722;C bond behaves as a triple bond, in o&#8208;carboryne the C&#8722;C bond is a double bond.







Abstract
The homolytic elimination of two H atoms from two adjacent carbons in benzene results in the aromatic product o&#8208;benzyne. In a similar way, the homolytic elimination of two H atoms from the two adjacent carbons in 1,2&#8208;C2B10H12 results in the aromatic product o&#8208;carboryne. In this work, we provide experimental and computational evidences that despite the similarity of o&#8208;carboryne and o&#8208;benzyne, the nature of the C&#8722;C bond generated between two adjacent carbons that lose H atoms is different. While in o&#8208;benzyne the C&#8722;C bond behaves as a triple bond, in o&#8208;carboryne the C&#8722;C bond is a double bond. Therefore, we must stop naming 1,2&#8208;dehydro&#8208;o&#8208;carboryne as o&#8208;carboryne but instead call it o&#8208;carborene.

         <title>Complexation&#8208;Triggered Fluctuation of &#960;&#8208;Conjugation on an Antiaromatic Dicyanoanthracene Dianion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reduction of a bisboron complex consisting of 9,10&#8208;dicyanoanthracene and two equivalents of tris(pentafluorophenyl)borane has also been studied. X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis and theoretical calculations revealed a decrease in antiaromaticity upon Lewis adduct formation. The outer rings acquired aromaticity upon reduction, and the central ring turned into a nonaromatic quinoidal structure. Furthermore, a B&#8722;N&#8722;C angle&#8208;dependent change in antiaromaticity was suggested by a scan of the NICS(1) calculation. Dianion 2 exhibited chemiluminescence upon exposure to an oxygen atmosphere.







Abstract
The formation of Lewis pairs is an important chemical concept. Recently, the complexation of Lewis acidic tris(pentafluorophenyl)borane with Lewis basic moieties and subsequent reduction has emerged as a fascinating strategy for designing novel reactions and structures. The impact of the complexation and subsequent reduction of antiaromatic systems bearing Lewis base moieties has been investigated. We found how Lewis adduct formation stabilizes an antiaromatic system consisting of 9,10&#8208;dicyanoanthracene and tris(pentafluorophenyl)borane by using synthesis, X&#8208;ray crystallography, spectroscopic analysis, and quantum chemical calculations.

Introduction of monofluorocarbene synthons has emerged as an important strategy for the construction of fluorine&#8208;containing products. This review summarizes the recent advances in the synthetic applications of monofluorinated carbenes, carbenoids, ylides, and related species.







Abstract
The synthesis of monofluorinated compounds is of great interest because of the vast applications of organofluorine compounds. Recently, the introduction of monofluorocarbene synthons has emerged as an important strategy for the synthesis of fluorine&#8208;containing products. In contrast to direct fluorination, in which C&#8722;F bonds are formed, the use of monofluorinated carbenes and related reactive species involves C&#8722;C or C&#8722;X bond formation while delivering valuable fluorine atoms into the target structure. Owing to increased knowledge on carbon&#8208;carbon and carbon&#8208;heteroatom bond formations, monofluorinated carbenes have enormous potential for the synthesis of organofluorine compounds, which, in our opinion, has not yet been fully exploited. This review summarizes the recent advances in the synthetic applications of monofluorinated carbenes, carbenoids, ylides, and related species.

         <title>Bismuth Infrared Star: Being at a Glance</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The bonding patterns of bismuth homoatomic polycations and their heteroatomic derivatives were analyzed using the AdNDP approach. Multiple delocalized bonds were observed in the clusters, influencing their absorption properties. The emission spectrum of Bi53+ was accurately predicted, demonstrating near&#8208;infrared luminescence. These findings provide insights into the photophysical properties and bonding nature of bismuth clusters for material design.







Abstract
Bismuth polycations have garnered significant attention from researchers due to their extraordinary and counter&#8208;intuitive structures and stoichiometries. Despite extensive experimental and theoretical investigations, understanding of the bonding in such clusters remains insufficient. An AdNDP bonding analysis was conducted to elucidate the bonding characteristics using both homoatomic and heteroatomic bismuth clusters with various stoichiometries. Analysis of the calculated nucleus&#8208;independent chemical shift data confirmed the aromatic nature of these species. Universal bonding patterns were identified that can be applied to a range of homoatomic and heteroatomic bismuth clusters. Additionally, calculations of absorbance and fluorescence spectra were performed to gain insights into the near&#8208;infrared emission and establish a potential correlation between absorbance and the identified bonding patterns.

         <title>Chalcogen Bonding Catalysis: Tellurium, the Last Frontier?</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review highlights the importance of chalcogen bonding in organic synthesis through a compilation of tellurium derivatives used up&#8208;to&#8208;now in catalysis. These powerful chalcogen bond donors were shown to activate numerous kind of substrates by non&#8208;covalent interaction with functional groups such as chlorides, carbonyls, imines, epoxides, alcohols and nitro derivatives.







Abstract
Chalcogen bonding (ChB) is the non&#8208;covalent interaction occurring between chalcogen atoms as Lewis acid sites and atoms or groups of atoms able to behave as Lewis bases through their lone pair or &#960; electrons. Analogously to its sister halogen bonding, the high directionality of this interaction was implemented for precise structural organizations in the solid state and in solution. Regarding catalysis, ChB is now accepted as a new mode of activation as demonstrated by the increased number of examples in the last five years. In the family of ChB catalysts, those based on tellurium rapidly appeared to overcome their lighter sulfur and selenium counterparts. In this review, we highlight the Lewis acid properties of tellurium&#8208;based derivatives in solution and summarize the start&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art of their applications in catalysis.

         <title>Chiral&#8208;at&#8208;Metal Racemization Unraveled for MX2(a&#8208;chel)2 by means of a Computational Analysis of MoO2(acnac)2</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Racemization mechanisms of chiral&#8208;at&#8208;metal MX2(a&#8208;chel)2 complexes were unraveled using MoO2(acnac)2 as a model. The cis(NN) isomer is the global energy minimum and racemizes via a three&#8208;step mechanism DML&#8594; CH&#8594;DML, which serves as prototype for racemizing MX2(a&#8208;chel)2.







Abstract
Octahedral chiral&#8208;at&#8208;metal complexes MX2(a&#8208;chel)2 (a&#8208;chel=asymmetric chelate) can rearrange their ligands by four mechanisms known as the Bailar (B), Ray&#8208;Dutt (RD), Conte&#8208;Hippler (CH), and Dhimba&#8208;Muller&#8208;Lammertsma (DML) twists. Racemization involves their interconnections, which were computed for MoO2(acnac)2 (acnac=&#946;&#8208;ketoiminate) using density functional theory at &#969;B97x&#8208;D with the 6&#8208;31G(d,p) and 6&#8208;311G(2d,p) basis sets and LANL2DZ for molybdenum. Racemizing the cis(NN) isomer, being the global energy minimum with trans oriented imine groups, is a three step process (DML&#8208;CH&#8208;DML) that requires 17.4&#8197;kcal/mol, while all three cis isomers (cis(NN), cis(NO), and cis(OO)) interconvert at &#8804;17.9&#8197;kcal/mol. The B and RD twists are energetically not competitive and neither are the trans isomers. The interconnection of all enantiomeric minima and transition structures is summarized in a graph that also visualizes valley ridge inflection points for two of the three CH twists. Geometrical features of the minima and twists are given. Lastly, the influence of N&#8208;substitution on the favored racemization pathway is evaluated. The present comprehensive study serves as a template for designing chiral&#8208;at&#8208;metal MX2(a&#8208;chel)2 catalysts that may retain their chiral integrity.

         <title>Concentration&#8208; and Solvent&#8208;Induced Chiral Tuning by Manipulating Non&#8208;Proteinogenic Amino Acids in Glycoconjugate Supra&#8208;Scaffolds: Interaction with Protein, and Streptomycin Delivery</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cbz&#8208;Protected non&#8208;proteinogenic amino acids L&#8208;phenylglycine and 4&#8208;Nitro&#8208;L&#8208;phenylalanine were chemically attached with D&#8208;glucosamine to fabricate biomimetic, non&#8208;immunogenic, non&#8208;allergic, biocompatible, and ambidextrous supergelators. The fibrous assemblies of the gelators revealed solvent&#8208; and concentration&#8208;triggered chiral alteration. Highly entangled helical fiber formation was observed in the microscopic images. Further, antibacterial activity by the streptomycin&#8208;loaded hydrogel, interaction with protein, and cell attachment were also demonstrated.







Abstract
We showed solvent&#8208; and concentration&#8208;triggered chiral tuning of the fibrous assemblies of two novel glycoconjugates Z&#8208;P(Gly)&#8208;Glu and Z&#8208;F(4&#8208;N)&#8208;Glu made by chemical attachment of Cbz&#8208;protected [short as Z)] non&#8208;proteinogenic amino acids L&#8208;phenylglycine [short as P(Gly)] and 4&#8208;Nitro&#8208;L&#8208;phenylalanine [short as F(4&#8208;N)] with D&#8208;glucosamine [short as Glu]. Both biomimetic gelators can form self&#8208;healing and shape&#8208;persistent gels with a very low critical gelator concentration in water as well as in various organic solvents, indicating they are ambidextrous supergelators. Detailed spectroscopic studies suggested &#946;&#8208;sheet secondary structure formation during anisotropic self&#8208;aggregation of the gelators which resulted in the formation of hierarchical left&#8208;handed helical fibers in acetone with an interlayer spacing of 2.4&#8197;nm. After the physical characterization of the gels, serum protein interaction with the gelators was assessed, indicating they may be ideal for biomedical applications. Further, both gelators are benign, non&#8208;immunogenic, non&#8208;allergenic, and non&#8208;toxic in nature, which was confirmed by performing the blood parameters and liver function tests on Wister rats. Streptomycin&#8208;loaded hydrogels showed efficacious antibacterial activity in&#8197;vitro and in&#8197;vivo as well. Finally, cell attachment and biocompatibility of the hydrogels were demonstrated which opens a newer avenue for promising biomedical and therapeutic applications.

Further, both gelators are benign, non-immunogenic, non-allergenic, and non-toxic in nature, which was confirmed by performing the blood parameters and liver function tests on Wister rats. Streptomycin-loaded hydrogels showed efficacious antibacterial activity in&#8197;vitro and in&#8197;vivo as well. Finally, cell attachment and biocompatibility of the hydrogels were demonstrated which opens a newer avenue for promising biomedical and therapeutic applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Formation and Growth of Atomic Scale Seeds of Au Nanoparticle in the Nanospace of an Organic Cage Molecule</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Although it is recently becoming possible to observe the nucleation of clusters with only a few metal atoms by TEM, it is challenging to control their formation and growth in a homogeneous solution system to synthesize metal nanoparticles. This work presents a new synthetic concept for metal nanoparticles utilizing an organic cage molecule which regulates both the formation and growth of seeds composing of only a few Au(0) atoms.







Abstract
Seed&#8208;mediated growth has been widely used to synthesize noble metal nanoparticles with controlled size and shape. Although it is becoming possible to directly observe the nucleation process of metal atoms at the single atom level by using transmission electron microscopy (TEM), it is challenging to control the formation and growth of seeds with only a few metal atoms in homogeneous solution systems. This work reports site&#8208;selective formation and growth of atomic scale seeds of the Au nanoparticle in a nanospace of an organic cage molecule. We synthesized a cage molecule with amines and phenols, which were found to both capture and reduce Au(III) ions to spontaneously form the atomic scale seeds containing Au(0) in the nanospace. The growth reaction of the atomic scale seeds afforded Au nanoparticles with an average diameter of 2.0&#177;0.2&#8197;nm, which is in good agreement with the inner diameter of the cage molecule.

         <title>Heterogeneous Fe&#8208;Doped Ni(OH)2 Grown on Nickel Mesh by Electrodeposition for Efficient Alkaline Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fe&#8208;doped Ni(OH)2 electrodeposited on nickel mesh was prepared for efficient alkaline OER, in which Ni3+ active components could be formed in electrochemical reconstruction.







Abstract
Designing highly excellent and stable catalysts for alkaline oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is gradually pivotal for clean energy development. In this work, a heterogeneous Fe&#8208;doped Ni(OH)2 (Ni/Fe&#8208;0.1) was developed via simple one&#8208;step electrodeposition onto nickel mesh. The heterogeneous interface structure generates sufficient active sites, significantly improving OER performance with an overpotential of 174&#8197;mV at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 (&#951;10), while Tafel slope is only 43.0&#8197;mV&#8201;dec&#8722;1. In particular, Ni/Fe&#8208;0.1 is still able to operate stably at a current density of 1&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 for 100&#8197;h without obvious potential decay. The oxidation of Ni2+ to Ni3+ was detected by X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy, proving that the heterogeneous catalyst could stabilize the high&#8208;valence state of nickel as active sites to its superior OER performance. This work provides a convenient synthetic strategy for forming heterogeneous catalysts toward efficient water electrolysis.

         <title>Fluorescent Phenotyping of Blood Cells Using a Differential Sensing Strategy: Differentiating Physiological Aging Stages and Neuro&#8208;degenerative Disease Drugs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Blood continually contributes to the maintenance of homeostasis of the body and contains information regarding the health state of an individual. However, current hematological analyses predominantly rely on a limited number of CD markers and morphological analysis. Here, we introduce differentially sensitive fluorescent compounds based on TCF scaffolds designed for fluorescent phenotyping of blood. Depending on their structures, TCF compounds displayed varied responses to reactive oxygen species, biothiols, redox&#8208;related biomolecules, and hemoglobin, which are the primary influential factors within blood. Contrary to conventional CD marker&#8208;based analysis, this unbiased fluorescent phenotyping method produces diverse fingerprints of the health state. We successfully demonstrated precise discrimination of blood samples from 37 mice based on their developmental stages, ranging from 10 to 19 weeks of age. Additionally, our fluorescent phenotyping method enabled the differentiation between drugs with distinct targets, serving as a simple yet potent tool for pharmacological analysis to understand the mode of action of various drugs.</dc:description>

         <title>Easy to Use DFT Approach for Computational pKa Determination of Carboxylic Acids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In pKa computational determination, the challenge in exploring and fostering new methodologies and approaches goes in parallel with the amelioration of computational performances. In this paper a &#8220;ready to use methodology&#8221; has been compared to other strategies, such as the re&#8208;shaping in solvation cavity (Bondi radius re&#8208;shaping), wanting to assess its reliability in predicting the pKa of a broad list of carboxylic acids. Thus, the functionals B3LYP and CAM&#8208;B3LYP have been selected, using SMD as continuum solvation model. Exploiting our previous results, two water molecules were made explicit on the reaction centre. Data show that our model (CAM&#8208;B3LYP/2H2O) is capable to accurately predict pKa, leading to mean absolute error (MAE) values lower than 0.5. Noteworthy, good results were achieved in computing the pKa of substituents bearing nitro and cyano groups. Focusing on B3LYP, eventually remarkable outputs were obtained only when Bondi correction was applied to the complex with two water molecules. Hence, massive outcomes were obtained in foreseeing the trichloro and trifluoro acetic acid pKa. These findings demonstrated that no complex level of theory nor external factor are required to accurately predict carboxylic acids pKa, with MAE well below 0.5 units.</dc:description>

         <title>Revealing the Origin of Fast Delayed Fluorescence in a Donor Functionalized Bisterpyridine</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A new carbazole&#8208;substituted bisterpyridine with pronounced delayed fluorescence is presented. While the molecular donor&#8208;acceptor&#8208;donor design suggests the origin of this to be thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF), results from various photophysical characterizations, OLED characteristics, temperature&#8208;dependent NMR spectroscopy, and DFT calculations all point against the involvement of triplet states. The molecule exhibits blue emission at about 440 nm with two or more fast decay channels in the lower nanosecond range in both solution and thin films. The delayed emission is proposed to be caused by rotational vibrational modes. We suggest that these results are generally applicable, especially for more complex molecules, and should be considered as alternative or competitive emissive relaxation pathways in the field of organic light emitting materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Luminescent Chiral Furanol&#8208;PAHs via Straightforward Ni&#8208;Catalyzed Csp2&#8208;F Functionalization: Mechanistic Insights into the Scholl Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Here we report the stepwise synthesis of new nanographes (NGs) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) obtained via Scholl ring fusion applied at aromatic homologation compounds, which are obtained through one&#8208;step Ni&#8208;catalysed Csp2&#8208;F functionalization. The latter are rapidly accessed valid precursors for the Scholl reaction, and screening of experimental conditions allowed us to describe for the first time furanol&#8208;bearing PAHs. Mechanistic insights are obtained by DFT to rationalize the formation of the furanol PAHs under moderately acidic conditions. All PAHs and NGs synthesized show moderate/weak fluorescent properties, and all PAHs crystallized show some degree of curvature and are obtained as racemic mixtures. Enantiomeric separation by chiral HPLC of one furanol&#8208;bearing PAH allowed the study of their chiroptical CD properties.</dc:description>

         <title>Direct synthesis of N&#8208;formamides by integrating reductive amination of ketones and aldehydes with CO2 fixation in a metal&#8208;organic framework</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Formamides are important feedstocks for the manufacture of many fine chemicals. State&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art synthesis of formamides relies on the use of an excess amount of reagents, giving copious waste and thus poor atom&#8208;economy. Here, we report the first example of direct synthesis of N&#8208;formamides by coupling two challenging reactions, namely reductive amination of carbonyl compounds, particularly biomass&#8208;derived aldehydes and ketones, and fixation of CO2 in the presence of H2 over a metal&#8208;organic framework supported ruthenium catalyst, Ru/MFM&#8208;300(Cr). Highly selective production of N&#8208;formamides has been observed for a wide range of carbonyl compounds. Synchrotron X&#8208;ray powder diffraction reveals the presence of strong host&#8208;guest binding interactions via hydrogen bonding and parallel&#8208;displaced &#960;&#183;&#183;&#183;&#960; interactions between the catalyst and adsorbed substrates facilitating the activation of substrates and promoting selectivity to formamides. The use of multifunctional porous catalysts to integrate CO2 utilisation in the synthesis of formamide products will have a significant impact in the sustainable synthesis of feedstock chemicals.</dc:description>

         <title>Lanthanide Mimicking by Magnesium for Oxazolidinone Synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In the last decade, magnesium complexes have emerged as a viable alternative to transition&#8208;metal catalysts for the hydrofunctionalization of unsaturated bonds. However, their potential for advanced catalytic reactions has not been thoroughly investigated. To address this gap, we have developed a novel magnesium amide compound (3) using a PNP framework that is both bulky and flexible. Our research demonstrates that compound 3 can effectively catalyze the synthesis of biologically significant oxazolidinone derivatives. This synthesis involves a tandem reaction of hydroalkoxylation and cyclohydroamination of isocyanate using propargyl alcohol. Furthermore, we conducted comprehensive theoretical calculations to gain insights into the reaction mechanism. It is important to note that these types of transformations have not been reported for magnesium and would significantly enhance the catalytic portfolio of the 7th most abundant element.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>A unique gyroid cubic phase has been discovered for a discotic star mesogen with three covalently attached DNA bases.

         <title>Single&#8208;Step Synthesis of NiI from NiII with H2</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
NiI complex directly from H2: This paper demonstrates for the first time that a NiI complex can be synthesized in single step from the reaction of a NiII complex with H2 at room temperature. The NiI complex can catalytically reduce N&#8208;methyl acridinium ions. The acridinium ion reduction, which demonstrates electron transfer from H2, rather than hydride transfer is discussed.







Abstract
Chemists have long sought to regulate the reactivity of H2, to yield hydride ions, hydrogen atoms, or electrons on demand. One source of inspiration for achieving this control is [NiFe]hydrogenase ([NiFe]H2ase), which reacts with H2 to form various hydrogen active species such as NiIII hydride species, NiII hydride species, and NiI low&#8208;valent species. Chemists have attempted to synthesize these hydrogen active species not only as models for the active species of [NiFe]H2ase, but also as electron transfer catalysts. However, the synthesis of NiI complex directly from H2 has not been reported. This paper reports the first example of a single&#8208;step synthesis of a NiI complex, via reaction of a NiII complex with H2, stable for over 3&#8197;months at room temperature and we further demonstrate a reductive coupling of acridinium ions as part of a reaction cycle.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ni&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt; complex directly from H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;: This paper demonstrates for the first time that a Ni&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt; complex can be synthesized in single step from the reaction of a Ni&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt; complex with H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; at room temperature. The Ni&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt; complex can catalytically reduce &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-methyl acridinium ions. The acridinium ion reduction, which demonstrates electron transfer from H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, rather than hydride transfer is discussed.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chemists have long sought to regulate the reactivity of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, to yield hydride ions, hydrogen atoms, or electrons on demand. One source of inspiration for achieving this control is [NiFe]hydrogenase ([NiFe]H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;ase), which reacts with H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to form various hydrogen active species such as Ni&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt; hydride species, Ni&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt; hydride species, and Ni&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt; low-valent species. Chemists have attempted to synthesize these hydrogen active species not only as models for the active species of [NiFe]H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;ase, but also as electron transfer catalysts. However, the synthesis of Ni&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt; complex directly from H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; has not been reported. This paper reports the first example of a single-step synthesis of a Ni&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt; complex, via reaction of a Ni&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt; complex with H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, stable for over 3&#8197;months at room temperature and we further demonstrate a reductive coupling of acridinium ions as part of a reaction cycle.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>DNA Chimeras as Electrochemical Biosensors for Host&#8208;Guest Measurements in Blood</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sensing in real blood: We developed a new class of sensors by covalently modifying an electrode&#8208;bound DNA with cyclobis&#8208;p&#8208;phenylene (i.&#8201;e., blue box), an electroactive host molecule that binds to small electron&#8208;rich aromatic molecules. Our sensors are rapid (&lt;5 min), single&#8208;step, reagentless, and afford continuous and stable measurements (&gt;3 days) of guest molecules at physiologically relevant concentrations directly in undiluted bovine whole&#8208;blood.







Abstract
Few sensing platforms have become ubiquitous to enable rapid and convenient measurements at the point&#8208;of&#8208;care. Those, however, are &#8220;one&#8208;off&#8221; technologies, meaning that they can only detect a single target and are hardly adaptable. In response, we plan to develop a sensing platform that can be extended to detect other classes of molecules and that affords rapid, convenient, continuous measurements directly in undiluted complex matrices. For this, we decided to rely on a host molecule that presents reversible interactions toward specific guest molecules to develop a new class of sensors that we coined &#8220;Electrochemical DNA&#8208;host chimeras&#8221;. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept for our sensor, we decided to use cyclobis(paraquat&#8208;p&#8208;phenylene) (&#8220;blue box&#8221;) that we attached on an electrode&#8208;bound DNA to allow measurements of electron&#8208;rich guests such as dopamine and aspirin. Doing so allows to promote host&#8208;guest complex that could be quantified using blue box's electrochemistry. Because of this unique sensor architecture, we achieve, to our knowledge, the first reagentless, continuous and rapid (&lt;5 min) host&#8208;guest measurements in undiluted whole blood. We envision that given the library of electroactive host molecules that this will allow the development of a sensing platform for measurements of several classes of molecules in complex matrices at the point&#8208;of&#8208;care.

         <title>Neutral Silylyne Complex of Molybdenum: Synthesis, Properties, and Access to Silaiminoacyl Complexes via [2+3] Cycloaddition</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A neutral silylyne complex of molybdenum was synthesized and its properties including cycloaddition reactions with alkynes and organic azides were studied. The first silicon version of iminoacyl complexes, i.&#8201;e., silaiminoacyl complexes were obtained by the [2+3] cycloaddition with organic azides. The novel structural and bonding aspects were revealed by X&#8208;ray crystal structure analysis and DFT calculations.







Abstract
A neutral silylyne complex of molybdenum was synthesized by the stepwise dehydrogenation method and its properties were compared with those of the tungsten analog. The complex takes a dimeric form as crystals but afford a monomer&#8208;dimer equilibrium in solution. The replacement of the central metal from W to Mo led to a monomer dominant (~98&#8201;%) solution at room temperature. The monomer&#8208;dimer dynamics was investigated based on thermodynamic parameters. The molybdenum silylyne complex underwent [2+2] cycloaddition with alkynes much faster than the tungsten analog. The reactions with organic azides led to the formation of the first example of silaiminoacyl complexes through [2+3] cycloaddition. The structures and bonding aspects of the products were clarified by multiple measurements and DFT calculations.

Golden time: 2&#8208;Aminoaryl&#8208;3&#8208;arylpropargyl&#8208;benzenesulfonamides react after diazotization with gold to give 3&#8208;acylindoles and/or Z&#8208;3&#8208;(chloromethylene)indolines. DFT calculations show that the arylAu intermediate evolve via external nucleophilic attack over the alkyne, which is more favorable energetically than an insertion process. One of the Z&#8208;3&#8208;(chloromethylene)indolines crystallized with [Cl&#8208;Au&#8208;Cl]&#8722; displaying short Au&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H&#8722;C contacts, that are maintained in solution.







Abstract
A one&#8208;pot diazotization/gold&#8208;mediated cyclization of 2&#8208;aminoaryl&#8208;3&#8208;arylpropargyl&#8208;benzenesulfonamides is described. After diazotization, Me2SAuCl triggers an oxy&#8208; and/or chloroarylation of the alkyne moiety, resulting in the formation of 3&#8208;acylindoles and/or Z&#8208;3&#8208;(chloromethylene)indolines. Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations show the significant energetic preference of both processes over an insertion pathway. Notably, a Z&#8208;3&#8208;(chloromethylene)indoline crystallized with [Cl&#8208;Au&#8208;Cl],&#8722; exhibiting Au&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H&#8722;C short contacts.

         <title>Improving In Vivo Tumor Accumulation and Efficacy of Platinum Antitumor Agents by Electronic Tuning of the Kinetic Lability</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The impact of kinetic lability or reactivity on in vitro cytotoxicity, stability in plasma, in vivo tumor and tissue accumulation, and antitumor efficacy of&#160;&#160; platinum(II) (Pt) anticancer agents containing a O&#708;O &#946;&#8208;diketonate leaving ligand remain largely unexplored. To investigate this, we synthesized Pt complexes [(NH3)2Pt(L1&#8208;H)]NO3 and [(DACH)Pt(L1&#8208;H)]NO3&#160; (L1 = 4,4,4&#8208;trifluoro&#8208;1&#8208;ferrocenylbutane&#8208;1,3&#8208;dione, DACH = 1R,2R&#8208;cyclohexane&#8208;1,2&#8208;diamine) containing an electron deficient L1&#8208;H O&#708;O leaving ligand and [(NH3)2Pt(L2&#8208;H)]NO3 and [(DACH)Pt(L2&#8208;H)]NO3 (L2 = 1&#8208;ferrocenylbutane&#8208;1,3&#8208;dione) containing an electron&#8208;rich L2&#8208;H O&#708;O leaving ligand. While all four complexes have comparable lipophilicity, the presence of the electron&#8208;withdrawing CF3 group was found to dramatically enhance the reactivity of these complexes toward nucleophilic biomolecules. In vitro cellular assays revealed that the more reactive complexes have higher cellular uptake and higher anticancer potency as compared to their less reactive analogs. But the scenario is opposite in vivo, where the less reactive complex showed improved tissue and tumor accumulation and better anticancer efficacy in mice bearing ovarian xenograft when compared to its more reactive analog. Finally, in addition to demonstrating the profound but contrasting impact of kinetic lability on in vitro and in vivo antitumor potencies, we also described the impact of kinetic lability on the mechanism of action of this class of complexes</dc:description>

         <title>Enhanced hydroxyl adsorption in ultrathin NiO/Cr2O3 in&#8208;plane heterostructures for efficient alkaline methanol oxidation reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The exploration of advanced nickel&#8208;based electrocatalysts for alkaline methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) holds immense promise for value&#8208;added organic products coupled with hydrogen production, but still remain challenging. Herein, we construct ultrathin NiO/Cr2O3 in&#8208;plane heterostructures to promote the alkaline MOR process. Experimental and theoretical studies reveal that NiO/Cr2O3 in&#8208;plane heterostructures enable a favorable upshift of the d&#8208;band center and enhanced adsorption of hydroxyl species, leading to accelerated generation of active NiO(OH)ads species. Furthermore, ultrathin in&#8208;plane heterostructures endow the catalyst with good charge trcellansfer ability and adsorption behavior of methanol molecules onto catalytic sites, contributing to the improvement of alkaline MOR kinetics. As a result, ultrathin NiO/Cr2O3 in&#8208;plane heterostructures exhibit a remarkable MOR activity with a high current density of 221 mA cm&#8208;2 at 0.6 V vs Ag/AgCl, which is 7.1&#8208;fold larger than that of pure NiO nanosheets and comparable with other highly active catalysts reported so far. This work provides an effectual strategy to optimize the activity of nickel&#8208;based catalysts and highlights the dominate efficacy of ultrathin in&#8208;plane heterostructures in alkaline MOR.</dc:description>

         <title>Field&#8208;assisted Regulation Induced by Cobalt&#8208;Doped ZnO for Dendrite&#8208;Free Lithium Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lithium metal batteries are deemed as an optimal&#160;candidate for the next generation of durable energy storage devices.&#160;However, the&#160;growth of lithium dendrite&#160;and significant&#160;volume expansion pose as&#160;obstacles that impede the application of lithium metal batteries.&#160;Herein, we design a functional&#160;copper&#160;current collector&#160;by coating it with&#160;Co&#8208;doped ZnO (Co/ZnO) to enhance&#160;the lithiophilicity&#160;through local electric fields and&#160;built&#8208;in magnetic fields&#160;induced&#160;by the ferromagnetic material.&#160;The incorporation&#160;of Co not only induces a local electric field and thus accelerates electron transfer, but also imparts&#160;the ferromagnetic behavior to&#160;ZnO,&#160;resulting in an internal magnetic field to regulate the dynamic trajectory. Profiting&#160;from&#160;the above advantages, the symmetric cells have excellent cycle stability in 1 mA cm&#8208;2&#160;and 1 mAh cm&#8208;2, maintaining ultra&#8208;low voltage for over 2000 h.

         <title>Visible Light Activates Coumarin&#8208;Caged mRNA for Cytoplasmic Cap Methylation in Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Protein synthesis is important and regulated by various mechanisms in the cell. Translation initiation in eukaryotes starts at the 5&#8242; cap and is the most complex of the three phases of mRNA translation. It requires methylation of the N7 position of the terminal guanosine (m7G). The canonical capping occurs in the nucleus, however, cytoplasmic recapping has been discovered. It functions in switching mRNAs between translating and non&#8208;translating states, but the individual steps are difficult to dissect. We targeted cytoplasmic cap methylation as the ultimate step of cytoplasmic recapping. We present an N7G photocaged 5&#8242; cap that can be activated for cytoplasmic methylation by visible light. We report chemical and chemo&#8208;enzymatic synthesis of this 5&#8242; cap with 7&#8208;(diethylamino)&#8208;4&#8208;methyl&#8208;coumarin (DEACM) at the N7G and validate that it is not bound by translation initiation factor 4E (eIF4E). We demonstrate incorporation into mRNA, the release of unmethylated cap analogue and enzymatic remethylation to functional cap 0 after irradiation at 450 nm. In cells, irradiation triggers translation of mRNAs with the N7G photocaged 5&#8242; cap via cytoplasmic cap methylation.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis, Structure and Reactivity of a Mononuclear N,N,O&#8208;Bound Fe(II) &#945;&#8208;Keto&#8208;Acid Complex</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Bulky, tridentate phenolate ligand (ImPh2NNOtBu) was used to synthesise the first example of a mononuclear, facial, N,N,O&#8208;bound iron(II) benzoylformate complex, [Fe(ImPh2NNOtBu)(BF)] (2). The X&#8208;ray crystal structure of 2 reveals that the iron centre is pentacoordinate (&#964; = 0.5), with a vacant site located cis to the bidentate BF ligand. The M&#246;ssbauer parameters of 2 are consistent with high&#8208;spin iron(II), and are very close to those reported for &#945;&#8208;ketoglutarate&#8208;bound non&#8208;heme iron enzyme active sites. According to NMR and UV&#8208;vis spectroscopies, the structural integrity of 2 is retained in both coordinating and non&#8208;coordinating solvents. Cyclic voltammetry studies show that the iron centre has a very low oxidation potential and is more prone to electrochemical oxidation than the redox&#8208;active phenolate ligand. Complex 2 reacts with NO to form a S = 3/2 {FeNO}7 adduct in which NO binds directly to the iron centre, according to EPR, UV&#8208;vis, IR spectroscopies and DFT analysis. Upon O2 exposure, 2 undergoes oxidative decarboxylation to form a diiron(III) benzoate complex, [Fe2(ImPh2NNOtBu)2(&#956;2&#8208;OBz)(&#956;2&#8208;OH)2]+ (3). Some hydroxylated ligand was also observed by ESI&#8208;MS, hinting at the formation of a high&#8208;valent iron(IV)&#8208;oxo intermediate. Initial reactivity studies show that 2 is capable of oxygen atom transfer reactivity with O2, converting methyl(p&#8208;tolyl)sulfide to sulfoxide.</dc:description>

         <title>Magnetic Relaxations of Chromium Nitride Porphyrinato Complexes Driven by the Anisotropic g&#8208;factor</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Molecule&#8208;based magnetic materials are useful candidates as the spin qubit due to their long coherence time and high designability. The anisotropy of the g&#8208;values of the metal complexes can be utilized to access the individual spin of the metal complexes, making it possible to achieve the scalable molecular spin qubit. For this goal, it is important to evaluate the effect of g&#8208;value anisotropy on the magnetic relaxation behaviour. We report here the slow magnetic relaxation behaviour of chromium nitride (CrN2+) porphyrinato complex (1), which is structurally and magnetically similar with the vanadyl (VO2+) poprphyrinato complex (2) which is known as the excellent spin qubit. Detailed analyses for vibrational and dynamical magnetism of 1 and 2 revealed that g&#8208;value anisotropy accelerates magnetic relaxations greater than the internal magnetic field from nuclear spin does. Our results provide a design criterion for construction of multiple spin qubit based on g&#8208;tensor engineering.</dc:description>

         <title>CoFe Alloys Dispersed on Se, N Co&#8208;Doped Graphitic Carbon as Efficient Bifunctional Catalysts for Zn&#8208;Air Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of a stable and efficient non&#8208;noble metal catalyst with both oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is paramount to achieving the widespread application of Zn&#8208;air batteries (ZABs), but remains a great challenge. Herein, a novel Co3Fe7 alloy nanoparticle dispersed on Se, N co&#8208;doped graphitic carbon (denoted as CoFe/Se@CN) was prepared through a facile hydrothermal and pyrolysis process. The synthesized CoFe/Se@CN exhibits outstanding ORR and OER properties with an ultralow potential gap of 0.625 V, which is mainly attributed to the abundant porous structure, the rich structural defects formed by doping Se atoms, and the strong synergistic effects between the CoFe alloys and graphitic carbon nanosheet. Furthermore, the ZAB fabricated by CoFe/Se@CN shows a high peak power density of 160 mW cm&#8208;2 and a large specific capacity of 802 mA h g&#8208;1 with favorable cycling stability, outperforming that of Pt/C+RuO2. Our study offers a plausible strategy to explore bifunctional carbon&#8208;based materials with efficient electrocatalytic properties for rechargeable ZABs.</dc:description>

         <title>Visible Light Mediated Co&#8208;Catalyzed Isocyanide Insertion with Sulfonyl Azide: Synthesis of Sulfonyl Carbamimidic Azide and Sulfonyl Aminotetrazole via Carbodiimide Intermediate</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we report an operationally simple and efficient protocol to prepare sulfonyl carbamimidic azide and N&#8208;sulfonyl aminotetrazole via Co&#8208;catalyzed three component coupling of sulfonyl azide (acts as nitrene source), isocyanide, and TMS&#8208;azide at room temperature under visible light. Initially, the carbamimidic azide is formed, which cyclizes only in the presence of base to deliver N&#8208;sulfonyl aminotetrazole in very good yields. The sulfonyl aminotetrazole can also be synthesized directly without isolating the carbamimidic azide in the presence of base. The sulfonyl azide is anticipated to generate nitrene and reacts with isocyanide to produce carbodiimide. Subsequent addition of azide (TMS&#8208;N3) to carbodiimide results in the formation of carbamimidic azide.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhancing Triplet&#8208;triplet Annihilation Upconversion of Pyrene Derivatives for Photoredox Catalysis via Molecular Engineering</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Triplet&#8208;triplet annihilation upconversion (TTA&#8208;UC) has the potential to enhance photoredox catalysis yield. It includes a sensitizer and an annihilator. Efficient and stable annihilators are essential for photoredox catalysis, yet only a few examples are reported. Herein, we designed four novel pyrene annihilators (1, 2, 3 and 4) via introducing aryl&#8208;alkynyl group onto pyrene to systematically modulate their singlet and triplet energies. Coupled with platinum octaethylporphyrin (PtOEP), the TTA&#8208;UC efficiency is enhanced gradually as the number of aryl&#8208;alkynyl group increases. When combining 4 with palladium tetraphenyl&#8208;tetrabenzoporphyrin (PdTPTBP), we achieve the highest red&#8208;to&#8208;green upconversion efficiency (22.4&#177;0.3%) (out of a 50% maximum) so far. Then, this pair is used to activate photooxidation of aryl boronic acid under red light (630 nm), which achieves a great improved reaction yield compared to that activated by green light directly. The result not only provides a design strategy for efficient annihilators, but also shows the advantage of applying TTA&#8208;UC into improving the photoredox catalysis yield.</dc:description>

         <title>Transforming Hetera&#8208;Buckybowls into Chiral Conjugated Polycycles Incorporating Epoxyocyclooctadiene: a Two&#8208;Step Approach</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chiral &#960;&#8208;conjugated polycycles have garnered increasing attention due to versatile applications in optoelectronic materials and biological sciences. In this study, we report the synthesis of chiral &#960;&#8208;conjugated polycycles incorporating a chiral epoxycyclooctadiene moiety. Our synthetic strategy capitalizes on the novel reactions of hetera&#8208;buckybowl triselenasumanene (TSS) and is achieved in two&#8208;step manner. Firstly, the TSS is regio&#8208;selectively transformed into its ortho&#8208;quinone form. Subsequently, the nucleophilic addition reactions of TSS ortho&#8208;quinone by phenylethynides are metal ion&#8208;dependent. When utilizing (phenylethynyl)magnesium bromide as the nucleophile, two phenylethynyls are furnished onto the edged benzene ring of TSS. When the nucleophile is (phenylethynyl)lithium, a cascade of nucleophilic addition, intermolecular electron&#8208;transfer, ring&#8208;opening, and tetradehydro&#8208;Diels&#8211;Alder (TDDA) reactions occur sequentially in one&#8208;pot, ultimately affording chiral &#960;&#8208;conjugated polycycles featuring the epoxycyclooctadiene moiety as an integral part of their backbones. This work represents a step forward in the synthesis of chiral &#960;&#8208;conjugated polycycles using TSS as synthon.</dc:description>

         <title>Nitrogen&#8208;Doped Starbons&#174;: Methodology Development and Carbon Dioxide Capture Capability.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Five nitrogen sources (glycine, &#946;&#8208;alanine, urea, melamine and nicotinamide) and three heating methods (thermal, monomodal microwave and multimodal microwave) are used to prepare nitrogen&#8208;doped Starbons&#174; derived from starch. The materials are initially produced at 250&#8211;300 oC (SNx300y), then heated in vacuo to 800 oC to produce nitrogen&#8208;doped SNx800y&#8217;s. Melamine gives the highest nitrogen incorporation without destroying the Starbon&#174; pore structure and the microwave heating methods give higher nitrogen incorporations than thermal heating. The carbon dioxide adsorption capacities of the nitrogen&#8208;doped Starbons&#174; determined gravimetrically, in many cases exceed those of S300 and S800. The carbon dioxide, nitrogen and methane adsorption isotherms of the most promising materials are measured volumetrically. Most of the nitrogen&#8208;doped materials show higher carbon dioxide adsorption capacities than S800, but lower methane and nitrogen adsorption capacities. As a result, the nitrogen&#8208;doped Starbons&#174; exhibit significantly enhanced carbon dioxide versus nitrogen and methane versus nitrogen selectivities compared to S800.</dc:description>

         <title>Modifying the catalytic activity of lipopeptide assemblies with nucleobases</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Biohybrid catalysts that operate in aqueous media are intriguing for systems chemistry. In this paper, we investigate whether control over the self&#8208;assembly of biohybrid catalysts can tune their properties. As a model, we use the catalytic activity of functional hybrid molecules consisting of a catalytic H&#8208;dPro&#8208;Pro&#8208;Glu tripeptide, derivatized with fatty acid and nucleobase moieties. This combination of simple biological components merged the catalytic properties of the peptide with the self&#8208;assembly of the lipid, and the structural ordering of the nucleobases. The biomolecule hybrids self&#8208;assemble in aqueous media into fibrillar assemblies and catalyze the reaction between butanal and nitrostyrene. The interactions between the nucleobases enhanced the order of the supramolecular structures and affected their catalytic activity and stereoselectivity. The results point to the significant control and ordering that nucleobases can provide in the self&#8208;assembly of biologically inspired supramolecular catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Pressure assisted synthesis of highly crystalline 1T&#8217;&#8217;&#8208;LixMoS2</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>LixMoS2 is not only discussed as lithium battery material, but is also an important precursor for the synthesis of MoS2 nanomaterials. Current syntheses of MoS2 like in n&#8208;butyllithium / LiBH4 or electrochemically are not satisfying in terms of defined stoichiometry and crystallinity, so an accurate experimental crystal structure determination of this important and widely used material is longingly awaited. A high&#8208;pressure/high&#8208;temperature synthesis yielded highly crystalline 1T&#8217;&#8217;&#8208;LixMoS2 (x = 1, 1.333). 1T&#8217;&#8217;&#8208;LiMoS2 crystallizes in the space group Pwith a = 6.2482(3) &#197;, b = 6.6336(3) &#197;, c = 6.7480(3) &#197;, &#945; = 119.321(2)&#176;, &#946; = 90.010(2)&#176; and &#947; = 90.077(2)&#176;. The arrangement of Mo atoms within the b&#8208;c&#8208;plane confirm a predicted Peierls distortion. A similar atom distribution pattern as for Mo is also observed for the lithium atoms. Calculation of bond valence site energies gave an activation barrier of 1.244 eV for 2D lithium&#8208;ion migration. For x = 1.333, a phase pure synthesis was achieved.</dc:description>

         <title>Fluorinated Benzimidazole&#8208;Linked Highly Conjugated Polymer Enabling Covalent Polysulfide Anchoring for Stable Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sulfur is one of the most abundant and economical sources in the p&#8208;block family and highly redox active, potentially utilizable as a charge&#8208;storing electrode with high theoretical capacities. However, its inherent dissolution feature in the electrolytes inhibits its accessibility as an electrode material in typical metal&#8208;sulfur batteries. In this work, the synthetically designed fluorinated porous polymer, when treated with elemental sulfur through a well&#8208;known nucleophilic aromatic substitution mechanism (SNAr), allows for the covalent integration of polysulfides into a highly conjugated benzimidazole polymer by replacing the fluorine atoms. Chemically robust benzimidazole linkages allow such harsh post&#8208;synthetic treatment and facilitate the electronic activation of the anchored polysulfides for redox reactions under applied potential. The electrode amalgamated with sulfurized polymer mitigates the so&#8208;called polysulfide shuttle effect in the lithium&#8208;sulfur (Li&#8208;S) battery and also enables a reversible, more environmentally friendly, and cheaper aluminum&#8208;sulfur (Al&#8208;S) battery that is configured with mostly p&#8208;block elements as cathode, anode, and electrolytes. The improved cycling stabilities and reduction of the overpotential in both cases pave the way for future sustainable energy storage solutions.</dc:description>

         <title>Oxidants Controlled C&#8208;H Bond Functionalization of N&#8208;Aryltetrahydroisoquinolines: The Construction of the Quaternary Carbon Center and Cleavage of the C&#8208;N Bond</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Initiated by triarylamine radical cation salt (TBPA), the direct C&#8208;H bond functionalization of &#945;&#8208;N&#8208;aryltetrahydroisoquinoline esters was smoothly realized, giving a series of &#945;&#8208;hydroxylated derivatives with a quaternary carbon center in good yields. Differently, in the presence of tert&#8208;butyl nitrite (TBN), the C&#8208;N single bond was cleaved to keto esters. The mechanistic study revealed that these reactions were mediated by a similar mechanism, in which the N&#8208;nitrosation might provide a driving force to the C&#8208;N bond cleavage.</dc:description>

         <title>Customized synthesis of MOF nanoplates via molecular scalpel strategy for efficient oxygen reduction in Zn&#8722;air batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The production of metal&#8722;organic framework (MOF) nanoplates with well&#8208;defined geometric morphology is remarkable for expanding their applications. Herein, the cobalt&#8208;based MOF nanoplates with hexagonal channels from a layer&#8208;pillared MOF are accomplished, via a molecular scalpel strategy, utilizing monodentate pyridine to replace the bidentate 4,4&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine. The morphology can be modified from nanorods to nanoplates with controllable thickness tuned by the amounts of pyridine. Succeeding carbonization treatment transforms the MOF nanoplates into Co particles homogeneously encapsulated in the nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon layers. The prepared catalyst with a unique platelike morphology displays a high half&#8208;wave potential of 0.88 V in oxygen reduction reaction. When used in primary Zn&#8722;air batteries, it delivers a high peak power density of 280 mW cm&#8722;2. This work clarifies the structure&#8208;morphology&#8208;reactivity connection of MOF nanoplates.</dc:description>

         <title>Control of Relative Positions of Electron&#8208;Donor and Electron&#8208;Acceptor Molecules in Charge&#8208;Transfer Complexes for Luminescent Property Modulation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Charge&#8208;transfer complexes can exhibit various physical properties, which depend on the relative positions of electron&#8208;donor and electron&#8208;acceptor molecules. Several studies have investigated the relationship between the relative positions of electron&#8208;donor and electron&#8208;acceptor molecules and their luminescence properties. However, elucidating the pure correlation between the relative positions and detailed luminescence processes without changing their molecular structures has been unexplored. Herein, we report the relative&#8208;position&#8208;control based on charge&#8208;assisted hydrogen bonds between sulfo and amino groups and on alkylamines&#8217; steric factors, and report concomitant luminescent property modulation. From anthracene&#8208;2,6&#8208;disulfonic acid and 1,2,4,5&#8208;tetracyanobenzene as electron&#8208;donor and electron&#8208;acceptor molecules, and various alkylamines, six charge&#8208;transfer complexes were prepared. Different alkylamines' steric factors drastically and precisely changed the relative positions of the electron&#8208;donor and electron&#8208;acceptor molecules without changing their molecular structures. Consequently, the six crystals exhibited maximum emission wavelengths from 543 to 624 nm and different luminescence processes.</dc:description>

In this work, the highly condensed lithium (imido)nitridophosphates LiP4N7 and Li3&#8722;xP6N11&#8722;x(NH)x (x&#160;=&#160;1.66(3)) were synthesized from LiPN2 and P3N5 in the multianvil press at 10&#160;GPa.

         <dc:description>An electrochemical synthesis of gold(I)&#8208;N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (Au&#8208;NHC) complexes has been developed. The electrochemical methodology uses only imidazolium salts, gold metal electrodes, and electricity to produce these complexes and the only by&#8208;product is hydrogen gas. This high&#8208;yielding and operationally simple procedure has been used to produce seven mononuclear and three dinuclear Au&#8208;NHC complexes. The electrochemical procedure facilitates a clean reaction with no by&#8208;products. As such, Au&#8208;NHC complexes can be directly transferred to catalytic reactions without work&#8208;up or purification. The Au&#8208;NHC complexes were produced on&#8208;demand and tested as catalysts in a vinylcyclopropanation reaction. All mononuclear Au&#8208;NHC complexes performed similarly to or better than the isolated complexes, showcasing how the electrochemical procedure can speed up catalyst screening and reaction development.</dc:description>

         <title>Electronic effects in Phosphino&#8208;Iminophosphorane PdII complexes upon varying the N substituent</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Three series of palladium(II) complexes supported by a phosphine&#8208;iminophosphorane ligand built upon an ortho&#8208;phenylene core were investigated to study the influence of the iminophosphorane N substituent. Cis&#8208;dichloride palladium(II) complexes 1 in which the N atom bears an isopropyl (iPr, 1a), a phenyl (Ph, 1b), a trimethylsilyl (TMS, 1c) group or an H atom (1d) were synthesized in high yield. They were characterized by NMR, IR spectroscopy, HR&#8208;mass spectrometry, elemental analysis, and X&#8208;ray diffraction. A substantial bond length difference between the Pd&#8208;Cl bonds was observed in 1. Complexes 1a&#8208;d were converted into [Pd(LR)Cl(CNtBu)](OTf)] 2a&#8208;d whose isocyanide is located trans to the iminophosphorane. The corresponding dicationic complexes [Pd(LR)(CNtBu)2](OTf)2 3a&#8208;d were also synthesized, however they exhibited lower stability in solution than 2, the isopropyl derivative 3a being the most stable of the series. Molecular modeling was performed to rationalize the regioselectivity of the substitution of the single chloride by isocyanide (from 1 to 2) and to study the electronic distribution in the complexes. In particular differences between the TMS and H containing complexes vs the iPr and Ph ones were found. This suggests that the nature of the N substituent is far from innocent and can help tune the reactivity of iminophosphorane complexes.</dc:description>

         <title>10 &#956;m&#8208;Level TiNb2O7 Secondary Particles for Fast&#8208;Charging Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>TiNb2O7 with Wadsley&#8208;Roth phase delivers double theoretical specific capacity and similar working potential in comparison to spinel Li4Ti5O12, &#160;and thus can enable much higher energy density of lithium&#8208;ion batteries. However, the inter&#8208;particle resistance within the high&#8208;mass&#8208;loading TiNb2O7 electrode would impede the capacity release for practical application, especially under fast&#8208;charging condition. Here, we fabricated 10&#8211;20 &#956;m&#8208;size carbon&#8208;coated TiNb2O7 secondary particle (SP&#8208;TiNb2O7) consisting of initial micro&#8208;scale TiNb2O7 particles (MP&#8208;TiNb2O7). The high crystallinity of active material could enable fast charge diffusion and electrochemical reaction rate within particles, and the small number of stacking layers of SP&#8208;TiNb2O7 could reduce the large inter&#8208;particle resistance that regular particle electrode often possesses and achieve high compaction density of electrodes with high mass loading. The investigation on materials structure and electrochemical reaction kinetics verified the advances of the as&#8208;fabricated SP&#8208;TiNb2O7 in achieving superior electrochemical performance.&#160;Particularly, the advances of such an anode were verified in practical 5 Ah&#8208;level laminated full pouch cell. The as&#8208;assembled LiFePO4||TiNb2O7 full cell exhibited a high capacity of 5.08 Ah at high charging rate of 6 C (77.9% of that at 0.2 C of 6.52 Ah), as well as an ultralow capacity decay rate of 0.0352% for 250 cycles at 1 C.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The oxidant&#8208;controlled divergent synthesis of C&#8208;2' formyl 2H&#8208;indazoles and indazoloindazolediones has been developed through Mn(I)&#8208; catalyzed ortho C&#8208;H functionalization of 2H&#8208;indazoles with para&#8208;formaldehyde to afford C&#8208;2' hydroxymethylated 2H&#8208;indazoles and subsequently oxidation with varying the amount of DDQ in one&#8208;pot. By employing selectfluor as the oxidant instead of DDQ, this reaction exclusively provided indazolebenzoxazine derivatives. This strategy delivered unsymmetrical indazoloindazoledione and indazolobenzoxazine with varied functional group tolerance in moderate to good yields.</dc:description>

         <title>Hierarchical Porous Aerogels With Multiple Adsorptive Interactions for Dye Wastewater Purification</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aerogels present a huge potential for removing organic dyes from printing and dyeing wastewater (PDW). However, the preparation of aerogels with multiple dye adsorption capabilities remains a challenge, as many existing aerogels are limited to adsorbing only a single type of dye. Herein, a composite aerogel (CG/T&#8208;rGO) with the addition of carboxymethyl chitosan, gelatin and tannic acid reduced graphene oxide (T&#8208;rGO) was synthesized by freeze&#8208;drying technology. The electrostatic interactions between dye molecular and GEL/CMCS (CG) networks, as well as the supramolecular interactions (H&#8208;bonds, electrostatic interactions and &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacks) between T&#8208;rGO, have endowed the aerogel with the ability to adsorb multiple types of dye, such as methylene blue (MB) and methyl orange (MO). Results exhibited that the prepared CG/T&#8208;rGO aerogel possessed strong mechanical strength and a porous 3D network structure with a porosity of 96.33%. Using MB and MO as adsorbates, the adsorption capacity (88.2mg/g and 66.6 mg/g, respectively) and the mechanism of the CG/T&#8208;rGO aerogel were investigated. The adsorption processes of aerogel for MB and MO were shown to follow the pseudo&#8208;second&#8208;order kinetic model and Langmuir isotherm model, indicating the chemical adsorption of a monolayer. The proposed aerogel in this work has promising prospects for dye removal from PDW.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this study, we explore feasibility of the mechanochemical approach in the synthesis of tetrabenzofluorenes (fluoreno[5]helicenes). For this, commercially available phenylated cyclopentadiene precursors are subjected to the Scholl reaction in the solid state using FeCl3 as an oxidant and sodium chloride as the solid reaction medium. This ball milling process gave access to the 5&#8208;membered ring containing&#8208;helicenes in one synthetic step in high (95&#8208;96%) isolated yields. The solution&#8208;phase reactions, however, were found to be moderate to low yielding in this regard (10&#8208;40%).</dc:description>
