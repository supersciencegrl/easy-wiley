The alkylsilicates were prepared in one step from organometallic reagents. Not only primary, secondary, and tertiary alkyl radicals but also elusive methyl radicals could be generated using the present reaction system. The generated radicals were trapped by electron&#8208;deficient olefins bearing various functional groups to give the desired alkyl adducts. The silicon byproduct can be recovered after the photoreaction. The radical&#8208;generation process was investigated by theoretical calculations, which provide an insight on the facile generation of methyl radicals from methylsilicate bearing  C,O  &#8208;bidentate ligands.</dc:description>

      <title>Ruthenium&#8208;Catalyzed Coupling Reactions of CO2 with C2H4 and Hydrosilanes towards Silyl Esters</title>
      <dc:description>A series of in situ&#8208;prepared catalytic systems incorporating Ru(II) precursors and bidentate phosphine ligands has been probed in the reductive carboxylation of ethylene in the presence of triethylsilane as reductant. The catalytic production of propionate and acrylate silyl esters was evidenced by high&#8208;throughput screening (HTS) and implemented in batch reactor techniques. The most promi&#8208;sing catalyst systems identified were made of Ru(H)(Cl)(CO)(PPh3)3 and 1,4&#8208;bis(dicyclohexylphosphino)butane (DCPB) or 1,1&#8217;&#8208;ferrocene&#8208;diyl&#8208;bis(cyclohexylphosphine) (DCPF). A marked influence of water on the acrylate/propionate selectivity was noted. Turnover numbers (TON, mol.mol(Ru)&#8722;1) up to 16 for acrylate and up to 68 for propionate were reached under relatively mild conditions (20 bar, 100 &#176;C, 0.5 mol% Ru, 40 mol% H2O vs. HSiEt3).

      <title>Do sulfonamides interact with aromatic rings?</title>
      <dc:description>Aromatic rings form energetically favorable interactions with many polar groups in chemical and biological systems. Recent molecular studies have shown that sulfonamides can chelate metal ions and form hydrogen bonds, however, it is presently not established whether the polar sulfonamide functionality also interacts with aromatic rings. Here we report synthetic, spectroscopic, structural and quantum chemical analyses on 2,6&#8208;diarylbenzenesulfonamides, in which two flanking aromatic rings are positioned close to the central sulfonamide moiety. Fine&#8208;tuning the aromatic character by substituents on the flanking rings leads to linear trends in acidity and proton affinity of sulfonamides. Our physical&#8208;organic chemistry study demonstrates that aromatic rings have a capacity to stabilize sulfonamides  via  through&#8208;space NH&#8211;&#960; interactions. These results have implications in rational drug design targeting electron&#8208;rich aromatic rings in proteins.</dc:description>

      <title>Parallel Lipid Peroxide Accumulation Strategy Based on Bimetal&#8208;Organic Frameworks for Enhanced Ferrotherapy</title>
      <dc:description>Ferroptosis, a nonapoptotic cell death pathway, is commonly regulated by ether lipid peroxide generation or glutathione consumption. In this work, a parallel lipid peroxide accumulation strategy was designed based on catalytic metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) for enhanced ferrotherapy. The bimetallic MOF was synthesized with iron porphyrin as a linker and cupric ion as a metal node, and erastin, a ferroptosis inducer, was sandwiched between MOF layers with 4,4'&#8208;dipyridyl disulphide as spacers. Under tumor microenvironment, erastin was released from the layered MOFs via a glutathione&#8208;responsive cleavage. The exfoliated MOFs served as a dual Fenton reaction inducer to generate numerous hydroxyl radicals for the accumulation of lipid peroxide while erastin aggravated glutathione depletion to down&#8208;regulate glutathione peroxidase 4, which then inhibited the consumption of lipid peroxide. Therefore, a parallel lipid peroxide accumulation strategy was established for enhanced ferrotherapy which effectively inhibited tumor growth in living mice, opening up new opportunities to treat apoptosis&#8208;insensitive tumors.</dc:description>

      <title>Rhodium(I)&#8208;Catalyzed Three&#8208;Component [4+2+1] Cycloaddition of Two Vinylallenes and CO</title>
      <dc:description>Transition metal catalyzed [4+2+1] reactions of diene (or diene derivatives such as vinylallene), alkyne/alkene, and CO (or carbene) are expected to be the most straightforward approach to synthesize challenging seven&#8208;membered ring compounds, but so far only limited successes have been realized. Here we report an unexpected three&#8208;component [4+2+1] reaction between two vinylallenes and CO to give highly functionalized tropone derivatives under mild conditions, where one vinylallene acts as 4C synthon, the other vinylallene as 2C synthon and CO as 1C synthon. We propose that this reaction occurs via oxidative cyclization of diene part of one vinylallene molecule, followed by insertion of terminal alkene part of the allene moiety in another vinylallene, into the Rh&#8208;C bond of five&#8208;membered rhodacycle. Then CO insertions and reductive elimination give the [4+2+1] cycloadduct.

      <dc:description>The development of metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) based supercapacitors have attracted intense concentration in recent years due to their regularly arranged porous and tunable pore sizes. However, the performance of the MOFs derived supercapacitors is also low because of their poor electrical conductivity and rarely accessible active sites. In the present work, we develop a Co&#8208;MOF (namely Co 2  BIM 4  , BIM=benzimidazole) nanosheets derived Co 3  O 4  /nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon (Co 2  BIM 4  &#8208;Co 3  O 4  /NC) heteroaerogel as a novel supercapacitor electrode. The 3D Co 2  BIM 4  &#8208;Co 3  O 4  /NC heteroaerogels are obtained by directly intercalating polyethyleneimine (PEI) into the interlayers of Co 2  BIM 4  nanosheets, and following by carbonizing the resulting Co 2  BIM 4  /PEI composite. The Co 2  BIM 4  &#8208;Co 3  O 4  /NC electrode possess 3D conductive framework with an overlapped hetero&#8208;interface and expanded interlayers, leading to fast and stable charge transfer/diffusion and enhanced pseudocapacitance performance.

      <title>The Relationship of William Henry Perkin, Jr. and Sir Robert Robinson: Teacher and Student, then Student and Teacher</title>
      <dc:description>
A productive collaboration: W.&#8197;H. Perkin, Jr. (left) and R. Robinson (right) had perhaps the most productive and broad collaboration between a professor and one's student. Together, during and after Robinson's student days, they had 71 joint publications, 25 of which involved just the two of them, 17 of which involved the structure determination of strychnine, and eight of which were published after Perkin's death in 1929. This Essay examines the professional relationship of Perkin, Jr. and Robinson as revealed in their joint publications on the structure of strychnine.







Abstract
William Henry Perkin, Jr. FRS, the son of the inventor of mauve and other commercial dyes and credited for initiating the industrialization of chemistry, was himself a notable chemist. He was the Professor of Organic Chemistry at Manchester from 1892&#8211;1912 and then was the Waynflete Professor of Chemistry at Oxford and the first Head of the Dyson Perrins Laboratory from 1912&#8211;1929. One of Perkin's graduate students and research assistants at Manchester was Robert Robinson, subsequently Sir Robert Robinson, FRS and recipient of the 1947 Nobel Prize in Chemistry. Perkin and Robinson had perhaps the most productive and broad collaboration between a professor and one's student. Together, during and after Robinson's student days, they had 71 joint publications, 25 of which involved just the two of them, 17 of which involved the structure determination of strychnine, and eight of which were published after Perkin's death in 1929. Upon Perkin's early death, Robinson succeeded him as the fourth Waynflete Professor of Chemistry at the Dyson Perrins Laboratory, Oxford University. This Essay will examine the professional relationship of Perkin, Jr. and Robinson as revealed in their joint publications on the structure of strychnine.

      <title>Energetics of Formation of Cyclacenes from 2,3&#8208;Didehydroacenes and Implications for Astrochemistry</title>
      <dc:description>
n&#8208;Acenes (C4n+2H2n+4) are potential carrier candidates for diffuse interstellar bands. Their conversion into n&#8208;cyclacenes (C4nH2n) through UV photon&#8208;initiated dehydrogenation followed by Diels&#8211;Alder cycloaddition and acetylene expulsion appears energetically plausible. Analysis of the conversion through TAO&#8208;DFT reveals dependency of the energy barriers on ring strains of the primary n&#8208;cyclacene.







Abstract
The carriers of the diffuse interstellar bands (DIBs) are still largely unknown although polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, carbon chains, and fullerenes are likely candidates. A recent analysis of the properties of n&#8208;acenes of general formula C4n+2H2n+4 suggested that these could be potential carriers of some DIBs. Dehydrogenation reactions of n&#8208;acenes after absorption of an interstellar UV photon may result in dehydroacenes. Here the reaction energies and barriers for formation of n&#8208;cyclacenes from 2,3&#8208;didehydroacenes (n&#8208;DDA) by intramolecular Diels&#8211;Alder reaction to dihydro&#8208;etheno&#8208;cyclacenes (n&#8208;DEC) followed by ejection of ethyne by retro&#8208;Diels&#8211;Alder reactions are analyzed using thermally assisted occupation density functional theory (TAO&#8208;DFT) for n=10&#8211;20. It is found that the barriers for each of the steps depend on the ring strain of the underlying n&#8208;cyclacene, and that the ring strain of n&#8208;DEC is about 75&#8201;% of that of the corresponding n&#8208;cyclacene. In each case, ethyne extrusion is the step with the highest energy barrier, but these barriers are smaller than CH bond dissociation energies, suggesting that formation of cyclacenes is an energetically conceivable fate of n&#8208;acenes after multiple absorption of UV photons.

      <title>Chemical Bonding as a New Avenue for Controlling Excited&#8208;State Properties and Excitation Energy Transfer Processes&#160;in Zinc Phthalocyanine&#8208;Fullerene Dyads</title>
      <dc:description>In this work we employ electronic structure and non&#8208;adiabatic dynamics methods to explore excited&#8208;state properties of covalently bonded zinc phthalocyanine (ZnPc)&#8208;fullerene (C60) dyads with 6&#8208;6 [or 5&#8208;6] bonding configuration in which ZnPc is bonded to two carbon atoms shared by the two hexagonal rings [or a pentagonal and a hexagonal ring] in&#160;C60. In both cases, the locally excited (LE) states on ZnPc are spectroscopically bright. However, their different chemical bondings differentiate the electronic interactions between ZnPc and C60. In the 5&#8208;6 bonding configuration the LE states on ZnPc are much higher in energy than the LE states on C60. Thus, the excitation energy transfer from ZnPc to&#160;C60&#160;is thermodynamically favorable. On the other hand, in the 6&#8208;6 bonding configuration such a process is inhibited because the LE states on ZnPc are the lowest ones. More detailed mechanisms are elucidated from non&#8208;adiabatic dynamics simulations. In the 6&#8208;6 bonding configuration, no excitation energy transfer has been observed. In contrast, in the 5&#8208;6 bonding configuration, several LE and charge&#8208;transfer (CT) excitons have been identified to participate in the energy transfer process. Further analysis reveals that the photoinduced energy transfer is mediated by a CT exciton, such that electron and hole transfer processes take place in a concerted but asynchronous manner in the excitation energy transfer. Furthermore, the present work opens up new avenues for regulating excited&#8208;state properties of molecular donor&#8208;acceptor dyads by means of chemical bonding.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>High&#8208;performance OLEDs that use phosphorescent and/or thermally activated delayed fluorescence emitters are capable of realizing 100% electron&#8208;to&#8208;photon conversion. The host materials in these OLEDs play crucial roles in determining OLED performance. Carbazole derivatives are frequently used as host materials, among which 3,3&#8208;di(9 H &#8208;carbazol&#8208;9&#8208; yl)biphenyl ( mCBP ) is often used for lifetime testing in scientific studies. In this study, we expanded the&#160; p &#8208;conjugation of the carbazole unit to enhance OLED lifetime by designing and developing two benzothienocarbazole (BTCz)&#8208;based host materials, namely&#160; m1BTCBP&#160; and&#160; m4BTCBP . Among these host materials,&#160; m1BTCBP&#160; formed a highly efficient Ir(ppy) 3 &#8208;based OLED with an operational luminescence half&#8208;life (LT 50 ) of over 300 h at an initial luminance of approximately 12000 cd m &#8211;2&#160; (current density: 25 mA cm &#8211;2 ). LT 50&#160; at 1000 cd cm &#8208;2&#160; is estimated to be about 23000 h. This performance is clearly greater than that of&#160; mCBP &#8208;based OLEDs (LT 50&#160; = ca. 8500 h).</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Sulfur&#8208;containing molecules are of utmost topical importance towards the effective development of pharmaceuticals and functional materials. Herein, we present an efficient and mild electrochemical thiolation by cross&#8208;electrophile coupling of alkyl bromides with functionalized bench&#8208;stable thiosulfonates to access alkyl sulfides with excellent efficacy and broad functional group tolerance. Cyclic voltammetry and potentiostatic analysis were performed to elucidate mechanistic insights of this electrocatalytic thiolation reaction.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <dc:description>Polyazanes (that is, higher nuclearity homologues of hydrazines) with increasing numbers of bound nitrogen atoms (from 3 to 5) were prepared via additions of lower order polyazanes to diazo reagents, including the first pentazane ever described .

      <title>Pushing the Limits of Acene Chemistry: The Recent Surge of Large Acenes</title>
      <dc:description>
Ring changes: Rooted in advances in organic synthesis and combined with specialized techniques for generation and study of highly reactive molecules, longer and longer acenes have became accessible for experimental investigations. Combined with sophisticated modern computational chemistry techniques, an encompassing picture of this unusual class of alternant polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons emerges.







Abstract
Acenes, consisting of linearly fused benzene rings, are an important fundamental class of organic compounds with various applications. Hexacene is the largest acene that was synthesized and isolated in the 20th century. The next largest member of the acene family, heptacene, was observed in 2007 and since then significant progress in preparing acenes has been reported. Significantly larger acenes, up to undecacene, could be studied by means of low&#8208;temperature matrix isolation spectroscopy with in situ photolytic generation, and up to dodecacene by means of on&#8208;surface synthesis employing innovative precursors and highly defined crystalline metal surfaces under ultrahigh vacuum conditions. The review summarizes recent experimental and theoretical advances in the area of acenes that give a significantly deeper insight into the fundamental properties and nature of the electronic structure of this fascinating class of organic compounds.

      <title>Carbon dioxide capture and utilization with isomeric forms of bis(amino)&#8208;tagged zinc bipyrazolate Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks</title>
      <dc:description>Aiming at extending the tagged zinc bipyrazolate Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks (MOFs) family, the ligand 3,3'&#8208;diamino&#8208;4,4'&#8208;bipyrazole (3,3'&#8208;H2L  ) has been synthesized in good yield. The reaction with zinc(II) acetate hydrate led to the related MOF  Zn(3,3'&#8208;L). The compound is isostructural with its mono(amino) analogue Zn(BPZNH2) and with  Zn(3,5&#8208;L), its isomeric parent built with 3,5&#8208;diamino&#8208;4,4'&#8208;bipyrazole.The textural analysis has unveiled its micro&#8208;/mesoporous nature, with&#160; BET area of 463 m2/g. Its CO2  adsorption capacity(17.4 wt.%CO2&#160;at p  CO2  = 1 bar and T = 298 K) and isosteric heat of adsorption (Q  st  = 24.8 kJ mol  &#8208;1) are comparable to that of  Zn(3,5&#8208;L). Both  Zn(3,3'&#8208;L)  and  Zn(3,5&#8208;L)  have been tested as heterogeneous catalysts in the reaction of CO2  with the epoxides epichlorohydrin and epibromohydrin to give the corresponding cyclic carbonates at T=393K and pCO2  =5 bar under solvent&#8208; and co&#8208;catalyst&#8208;free conditions. In general, the conversions recorded are higher than those found for Zn(BPZNH2),proving that the insertion of an extra amino tag in the pores is beneficial for the epoxidation catalysis. The best catalytic match has been observed for the  Zn(3,5&#8208;L)  /epichlorohydrin couple,with 64% conversion and a TOF of 5.3 mmol(carbonate)&#8729;(mmolZn)  &#8208;1&#8729;h&#8208;1.To gain better insights on the MOF&#8208;epoxide interaction, the crystal structure of the [epibromohydrin@Zn(3,3'&#8208;L)] adduct has been solved, confirming the existence of Br&#183;&#183;&#183;(H)&#8208;N non&#8208;bonding interactions.

      <title>Non&#8208;coordinated and hydrogen bonded phenolate anions as one&#8208;electron reducing agents</title>
      <dc:description>Here we present the syntheses of non&#8208;coordinated electron&#8208;rich phenolate anions via deprotonation of the corresponding alcohols with an extremely powerful perethyl tetraphosphazene base (Schwesinger base). The application of uncharged phosphazenes renders the selective preparation of anionic phenol&#8208;phenolate and phenolate hydrates possible, which allows the investigation of hydrogen bonding in these species. Hydrogen bonding brings about decreased redox potentials relative to the corresponding non&#8208;coordinated phenolate anions. The latter show redox potentials of up to &#8208;0.72(1)&#160;V vs. SCE, which is comparable to that of zinc metal, thus qualifying their application as organic zinc mimics. We utilized phenolates as reducing agents for the generation of radical anions in addition to the corresponding phenoxyl radicals. A tetracyanoethylene radical anion salt was synthesized and fully characterized as a representative example. We also present the activation of sulfur hexafluoride (SF  6  ) with phenolates in an SET reaction. Thereby the nature of the respective phenolate determines whether simple fluorides or pentafluorosulfanide ([SF  5  ]  &#8208;  ) salts are formed.</dc:description>

      <title>Reactivity of Single Transition Metal Atoms on a Hydroxylated&#160;Amorphous Silica Surface: A Periodic Conceptual DFT Investigation.</title>
      <dc:description>The drive to develop maximal atom&#8208;efficient catalysts coupled to the continuous strive for more sustainable reactions has led to an ever&#8208;increasing interest in single&#8208;atom catalysis. Based on a periodic conceptual Density Functional Theory (cDFT) approach, fundamental insights into the reactivity and adsorption of single late transition metal atoms supported on a fully hydroxylated amorphous silica surface have been acquired. In particular,&#160;this investigation revealed that the influence of van der Waals dispersion forces is especially significant for a silver (98%) or gold (78%) atom, while the oxophilicity of the Group 8&#8208;10 transition metals plays a major role in the interaction strength of these atoms on the non&#8208;reducible SiO2&#160;support. The adsorption energies for the less electronegative row 4 elements (Fe, Co, Ni) ranged from &#8208;1.40 to &#8208;1.92 eV, while for the heavier row 5 and 6 metals, with the exception of Pd, these values are between &#8208;2.20 and &#8208;2.92 eV. Through a systematic analysis of cDFT descriptors determined using three different theoretical schemes, the Fermi weighted density of states approach was identified as the most suitable for describing the reactivity of the studied systems. The contribution of the energy levels to the reactivity is simultaneously scaled based on their position relative to the Fermi level. Finally, the obtained Fermi weighted density of states reactivity trends show a good agreement with the chemical characteristics of the investigated metal atoms as well as the experimental data.</dc:description>

      <title>De Novo Design of Selective Quadruplex&#8208;Duplex Junction Ligands and Structural Characterisation of their Binding Mode: Targeting the G4 Hot&#8208;Spot</title>
      <dc:description>Targeting the interface between DNA quadruplex and duplex regions by small molecules holds significant promise in both therapeutics and nanotechnology. Herein we report on a new pharmacophore that selectively binds with high affinity to quadruplex&#8208;duplex junctions, while presenting a poorer affinity for G&#8208;quadruplex or duplex DNA alone. Ligands complying with the reported pharmacophore exhibit a significant affinity and selectivity for quadruplex&#8208;duplex junctions, including the one observed in the HIV&#8208;1 LTR&#8208;III sequence. The structure of the complex between a quadruplex&#8208;duplex junction with a ligand of this family has been determined by NMR methods. According to these data, the remarkable selectivity of this structural motif for quadruplex&#8208;duplex junctions is achieved through an unprecedented interaction mode so far unexploited in medicinal and biological chemistry: the insertion of a benzylic ammonium moiety into the centre of the partially exposed interfacial G&#8208;tetrad. Further decoration of the described scaffolds with additional fragments opens up the road to the development of selective ligands for G&#8208;quadruplex&#8208;forming regions of the genome.</dc:description>

      <title>The combined use of gold nanoparticles and infrared radiation enables cytosolic protein delivery</title>
      <dc:description>Cytosolic protein delivery remains elusive. The inability of most proteins to cross the cellular membrane is a huge hurdle. Here we explore the unique photothermal properties of gold nanorods (AuNRs) to trigger cytosolic delivery of proteins. Both partners, protein and AuNRs, are modified with a protease&#8208;resistant cell&#8208;penetrating peptide with nuclear targeting properties to induce internalization.

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Cytosolic protein delivery remains elusive. The inability of most proteins to cross the cellular membrane is a huge hurdle. Here we explore the unique photothermal properties of gold nanorods (AuNRs) to trigger cytosolic delivery of proteins. Both partners, protein and AuNRs, are modified with a protease&#8208;resistant cell&#8208;penetrating peptide with nuclear targeting properties to induce internalization. Once internalised, spatiotemporal control of protein release is achieved by near&#8208;infrared laser irradiation in the safe second biological window. Importantly, catalytic amounts of AuNRs are sufficient to trigger cytosolic protein delivery. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that AuNRs with their maximum of absorption in the second biological window are used to deliver proteins into the intracellular space. This strategy represents a powerful tool for the cytosolic delivery of virtually any class of protein.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Design and Development of Axially Chiral Bis(Naphthofuran) Luminogens as Fluorescent Probe for Cell&#8208;imaging</title>
      <dc:description>Designing chiral AIEgens without any externally tagged AIE active molecules to the chiral scaffold remains a long&#8208;standing challenge to the scientific community. The inherent ACQ phenomenon associated with the axially chiral (R)&#8208;BINOL scaffold, together with the marginal Stokes shift limits their application as chiral AIE active materials. Herein, in our effort to design chiral luminogens, we have come across a design strategy where 2&#8208;phenacyl furans when appropriately fused with the BINOL scaffold will generate solid&#8208;state emissive materials with high thermal and photostability stability as well as color tunable property. The excellent biocompatibility together with high fluorescence quantum yield and large Stokes shift of one of the luminogen stimulated us to investigate its cell&#8208;imaging potential. The luminogen was observed well internalized and uniformly dispersed within the cytoplasm of MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;231 cancer cells with high fluorescence intensity.</dc:description>

      <title>Interaction of Hydrogen with Ceria: Hydroxylation, Reduction, and Hydride Formation on the Surface and in the Bulk</title>
      <dc:description>The&#160; study reports on a first attempt to address the interplay between surface and bulk in hydride formation in ceria (CeO2) by combining experiment, using surface sensitive and bulk sensitive spectroscopic techniques on the two sample systems, i.e., CeO2(111) thin films and CeO2 &#160;powders, and theoretical calculations of CeO2(111) surfaces with oxygen vacancies (Ov) at the surface and in the bulk. We show that, on a stoichiometric CeO2(111) surface, H2 dissociates and forms surface hydroxyls (OH). On the pre&#8208;reduced CeO2&#8208;x samples, both films and powders, hydroxyls and hydrides (Ce&#8208;H) are formed on the surface as well as in the bulk, accompanied by the Ce3+&#171;Ce4+ redox reaction. As the Ov concentration increases, hydroxyl is destabilized and hydride becomes more stable. Surface hydroxyl is more stable than bulk hydroxyl, whereas bulk hydride is more stable than surface hydride. The surface hydride formation is the kinetically&#8208;favorable process at relatively low temperatures, and the resulting surface hydride may diffuse into the bulk region and be stabilized therein. At higher temperatures, surface hydroxyls can react to produce water and create additional oxygen vacancies, increasing its concentration, which controls the H2/CeO2 interaction. The results demonstrate a large diversity of reaction pathways, which have to be taken into account for better understanding of reactivity of ceria&#8208;based catalysts in a hydrogen&#8208;rich atmosphere.</dc:description>

      <title>Comments on &#8220;Molecular Chirality in Classical Spacetime: Solving the Controversy about the Spinning Cone Model of Rotating Molecules&#8221;</title>
      <dc:description>
A recent analysis in this journal claiming to solve the controversy about the chirality or otherwise of a non&#8208;translating spinning cone is reassessed. We conclude that it is misleading since, being purely mathematical, it ignores the distinct physicochemical properties of a chiral molecule and a stationary spinning cone, especially the ability of the first but not the second to support time&#8208;even pseudoscalar observables.







Abstract
A recent mathematical analysis by Michel Petijean aimed at solving the Barron/Mislow controversy concerning the chirality or otherwise of a non&#8208;translating spinning cone concluded that both are right: the controversy is a matter of an arbitrary choice of a conversion factor. This reassessment highlights the different physicochemical properties of a stationary spinning cone and a chiral molecule and concludes that Petitjean's analysis is misleading.

No, not NO! Based on the spectroscopic and mechanistic reassignment of the EPR spectrum of a nitroxide radical and a reinterpretation of DNA cleavage data presented in the title paper, it is reasoned that intercalated amidyl radicals and/or higher nitrogen oxides, but not NO radicals, were responsible for site&#8208;selective single&#8208;strand scission of DNA.

This Correspondence reports on a structural and mechanistic misinterpretation of an observed EPR spectrum, a misleading presentation of DNA cleavage data, and the physicochemically unsupported assignment of nitric oxide as a major DNA cleaving agent in the article cited in the title.

      <title>Ring&#8208;Closing Olefin Metathesis Catalyzed by Well&#8208;Defined Vanadium Alkylidene Complexes</title>
      <dc:description>Vanadium&#8208;based catalysts have shown activity and selectivity in ring&#8208;opening metathesis polymerization of strained cyclic olefins comparable to those of Ru, Mo, and W catalysts. However, the application of V alkylidenes in routine organic synthesis is limited. Here, we present the first example of ring&#8208;closing olefin metathesis catalyzed by well&#8208;defined V chloride alkylidene phosphine complexes. The developed catalysts exhibit tolerance to various functional groups, such as an ether, an ester, a tertiary amide, a tertiary amine, and a sulfonamide. The size and electron&#8208;donating properties of the imido group and the phosphine play a crucial role in the stability of active intermediates. Reactions with ethylene and olefins suggest that both &#120573;&#8208;hydride elimination of the metallacyclobutene and bimolecular decomposition are responsible for catalyst degradation.</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Vanadium&#8208;based catalysts have shown activity and selectivity in ring&#8208;opening metathesis polymerization of strained cyclic olefins comparable to those of Ru, Mo, and W catalysts. However, the application of V alkylidenes in routine organic synthesis is limited. Here, we present the first example of ring&#8208;closing olefin metathesis catalyzed by well&#8208;defined V chloride alkylidene phosphine complexes. The developed catalysts exhibit tolerance to various functional groups, such as an ether, an ester, a tertiary amide, a tertiary amine, and a sulfonamide. The size and electron&#8208;donating properties of the imido group and the phosphine play a crucial role in the stability of active intermediates. Reactions with ethylene and olefins suggest that both &#120573;&#8208;hydride elimination of the metallacyclobutene and bimolecular decomposition are responsible for catalyst degradation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

In modern research, C&#8722;S/N&#8722;S bonds are indispensable in many biological important compounds and pharmaceuticals. Given many advantages (such as inexpensive, environmentally benign, and easy&#8208;handled catalysts or reagents) of iodine and its derivatives, several new strategies, such as oxidation relay strategy, have been greatly developed and accelerated the advancement of this field. The most recent advances in iodine&#8208; and its derivatives&#8208;promoted hybridized C&#8722;S/N&#8722;S bonds formation with special emphasis on the features and mechanisms of the corresponding reactions, together with a comparison of some reactions with previous reports and an outlook to the future of this domain are discussed in the Review by T.

      <dc:description>
Germacrene A shows a unique and interesting chemistry mainly characterised by its reactivity towards acid&#8208;catalysed cyclisations and its thermal lability in a Cope rearrangement to &#946;&#8208;elemene. Similar observations have been made for other germacrenes, suggesting that the high ring strain associated with the 10&#8208;membered ring in these systems may be a strong driving force for the observed reactions leading to much less strained compounds with 6&#8208;membered rings. Germacrene A is of central importance in sesquiterpene biosynthesis and this Review covers the biosynthetic derivatives, the absolute configurations and the natural sources.

Helical Molecular Orbitals&#8212;Hel&#8208;MOs&#8212;have been tailored theoretically through the torsion angle of diphenylbutadiynes. Experimentally, suitable conformations have been locked by the synthesis of cyclic spirobifluorenes.

      <title>Tuning the Molecular Packing of Self&#8208;Assembled Amphiphilic Pt(II) Complexes by Variation of the Hydrophilic Side Chain Length</title>
      <dc:description>Understanding the relationship between molecular design and packing modes constitutes one of the major challenges in self&#8208;assembly and is essential for the preparation of functional materials. Herein, we have achieved high precision control over the supramolecular packing of amphiphilic Pt(II) complexes by systematic variation of the hydrophilic side chain length. A novel approach of general applicability based on complementary X&#8208;ray diffraction and solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy has allowed us to establish a clear correlation between molecular features and supramolecular ordering: systematically increasing the side chain length gradually increases the steric demand and reduces the extent of aromatic interactions, inducing a gradual shift in the molecular packing from parallel to a long&#8208;slipped organization. Notably, our findings highlight the necessity of advanced solid&#8208;state NMR techniques to gain structural information for supramolecular systems where single&#8208;crystal growth is not possible. Our work further demonstrates a new molecular design strategy to modulate aromatic interaction strengths and packing arrangements, which may be useful for the engineering of functional materials based on Pt(II) and aromatic molecules.</dc:description>

      <title>A general approach to intermolecular olefin hydroacylation via light induced HAT initiation: an efficient synthesis of long chain aliphatic ketones and functionalized fatty acids</title>
      <dc:description>Herein, an operationally simple, environmentally benign, and effective method for intermolecular radical hydroacylation of unactivated substrates employing photo&#8208;induced hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) initiation is described. The use of commercially available and inexpensive photoinitiators (Ph2CO and NHPI) makes the process attractive. The olefin hydroacylation protocol applies to a wide array of substrates bearing numerous functional groups and many complex structural units. The reaction proves to be scalable (up to 5 g scale). Different functionalized fatty acids, petrochemicals and naturally occurring alkanes are synthesized with this protocol. A radical chain mechanism is implicated for the process.</dc:description>

      <title>Paraoxonase Mimic by a Nanoreactor Aggregate Containing Benzimidazolium Calix and L&#8208;Histidine: Demonstration of the Acetylcholine Esterase Activity</title>
      <dc:description>An anion&#8208;mediated preorganization approach was used to design and synthesize the benzimidazolium&#8208;based calix compound  R1  &#8729;2ClO  4  &#8211;  . X&#8208;ray crystallography analysis revealed that the hydrogen bonding interactions between the benzimidazolium cations and N,N&#8208;dimethylformamide (DMF) helped  R1  &#8729;2ClO  4  &#8211;  encapsulate DMF molecule(s)A nanoreactor, with  R1  &#8729;2ClO  4  &#8211;  and  L  &#8208;histidine (  L  &#8208;His) as the components, was fabricated using a neutralization method. The nanoreactor could detoxify paraoxon in 30 min.  L  &#8208;His played a vital role in this process. Paraoxonase is a well&#8208;known enzyme used for pesticide degradation. The Ellman&#8217;s reagent was used to determine the percentage inhibition of the acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity in the presence of the nanoreactor. The results indicated that the nanoreactor inhibited AChE inhibition.</dc:description>

The nanoreactor could detoxify paraoxon in 30 min.  L  &#8208;His played a vital role in this process. Paraoxonase is a well&#8208;known enzyme used for pesticide degradation. The Ellman&#8217;s reagent was used to determine the percentage inhibition of the acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity in the presence of the nanoreactor. The results indicated that the nanoreactor inhibited AChE inhibition.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Preparation of functionalized carbon&#8208;coated cobalt nanoparticles with sulfonated arene derivatives, a study on surface functionalization and stability</title>
      <dc:description>The functionalization of magnetic nanoparticles has been an important field in the last decade due to the versatile applications in catalysis and biomedicine. Generally, a high degree of functionalities on the surface of the nanoparticles is desired. In this study, covalent functionalization of various aromatic sulfonic acids on carbon&#8208;coated cobalt nanoparticles are investigated on surface functionalization yield and stability. The nanoparticles are prepared  via  covalent linkage of an  in situ  generated diazonium on the graphene&#8208;like surface. Adsorption and wash experiments were performed to confirm a covalent bonding of the naphthalene derivatives on the nanoparticle surface. With an increased number of sulfonic acid groups on the aromatic compound a significantly lower loading is observed on the corresponding functionalized nanoparticles. This can be counteracted by a change of nitrite species. With this method, nanoparticles with a high number of sulfonic acid groups can be produced.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>A new mode of aromatic metamorphosis has been developed, which allows thiophenes and their benzo&#8208;fused derivatives to be converted to a variety of exotic heteroles. This transformation involves 1) the efficient generation of key 1,4&#8208;dianions by means of desulfurative dilithiation with lithium powder and 2) the subsequent trapping of the dianions with heteroatom electrophiles in a one&#8208;pot manner.

      <title>Donor&#8211;acceptor Stenhouse adducts: Exploring the effects of ionic character</title>
      <dc:description>The effects of solution&#8208;state dielectric and intermolecular interactions on the degree of charge separation provides a route to understand the switching properties and concentration dependence of donor&#8211;acceptor Stenhouse adducts (DASAs). Using solvatochromic analysis of the open form DASA in conjunction with X&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD) and computational theory we analyzed the ionic character of a series of DASAs. First and third generation architectures lead to a higher zwitterionic resonance contribution of the open form and a zwitterionic closed form while second generation architecture poses less charge&#8208;separated open form and neutral closed forms. This can be correlated to equilibrium control and photoswitching solvent compatibility. Due to the high contribution of the zwitterionic resonance form of a first and third generation DASA we demonstrate external control over their switching kinetics by ion concentration, while second generation DASAs are less affected. Importantly, the ionic character of DASAs correlates to the previously observed concentration dependence and is not universal to DASA.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Though graphene fiber&#8208;based supercapacitors are promising for wearable electronic devices, low energy density of electrodes and poor cold resistance of aqueous electrolytes limit their wide applications in cold environments. Herein, porous nitrogen/sulfur dual&#8208;doped graphene fibers (NS&#8208;GFs) are synthesized via hydrothermal self&#8208;assembly followed by thermal annealing, exhibiting an excellent capacitive performance of 401 F cm&#8208;3 at 400 mA cm&#8208;3 because of the synergistic effect of heteroatom dual&#8208;doping. The assembled symmetric all&#8208;solid&#8208;state supercapacitor with polyvinyl alcohol/H2SO4/graphene oxide gel electrolyte exhibits high capacitance of 221 F cm&#8208;3 and high energy density of 7.7 mWh cm&#8208;3 at 80 mA cm&#8208;3. Interestingly, solar&#8208;thermal energy conversion of the electrolyte with 0.1 wt% graphene oxide extends operating temperature range of the supercapacitor to 0 oC. Furthermore, the photocatalysis effect of the dual&#8208;doped heteroatoms increases the capacitance of NS&#8208;GFs. At an ambient temperature of 0 oC, the capacitance increases from 0 to 182 F cm&#8208;3 under 1&#8208;sun irradiation because of the excellent solar light absorption and efficient solar&#8208;thermal energy conversion of graphene oxide, preventing the aqueous electrolyte from freezing.

      <title>Benzo&#8208;Tetrathiafulvalene&#8208; (BTTF&#8208;) Annulated Expanded Porphyrins: Potential Next Generation Multielectron Reservoirs</title>
      <dc:description>Two sterically crowded benzo&#8208;tetrathiafulvalene (BTTF)&#8208;annulated expanded porphyrins (  BTTF7&#8211;F  and  BTTF8  ) have been synthesized. Detailed photophysical investigations revealed their intrinsic intramolecular charge transfer (CT) character, originated from partial electron transfer from electron&#8208;rich TTF units to the relatively electron&#8208;deficient macrocyclic core. This finding stands in contrast to what was observed in the previously reported figure&#8208;of&#8208;eight conformer of BTTF&#8208;annulated [28]hexaphyrin &#160; (  BTTF6  ), where typical &#960;&#8208;&#960; * electronic transition from HOMO to LUMO was observed. However, core expansion in  BTTF7&#8211;F  and  BTTF8  makes the oligopyrrole macrocyclic cores relatively more electron deficient, facilitating the effective intramolecular CT process. Comparative electrochemical investigations revealed that the current generated at the oxidative region is directly proportional to the number of TTF units attached with the macrocyclic core. This work demonstrates the control of intramolecular CT process by incremental addition of TTF units to the macrocyclic core. Facile multielectron electrochemical oxidations of these expanded porphyrins suggest that they behave like potential multielectron reservoirs.</dc:description>

      <title>Concentration&#8208;dependent Self&#8208;assembly of an Unusually Large Hexameric Hydrogen&#8208;bonded Molecular Cage</title>
      <dc:description>The sizes of available self&#8208;assembled hydrogen bond based supramolecular capsules and cages are rather limited. The largest systems feature volumes of approx. 1400 &#8722; 2300 &#197;3. Here, we report a large, hexameric cage based on intermolecular amide&#8722;amide dimerization. The unusual structure with openings, reminiscent of covalently linked cages, is held together by 24 hydrogen bonds. With a diameter of 2.3 nm and a cavity volume of &#8764; 2800 &#197;3 the assembly is larger than any previously known capsule/cage structures relying exclusively on hydrogen bonds. The self&#8208;assembly process in chlorinated, organic solvents was found to be strongly concentration dependent with the monomeric form prevailing at low concentrations. Additionally, the formation of host&#8722;guest complexes with fullerenes (C60 and C70) was observed.</dc:description>

      <title>Intermediate valence states in lanthanide compounds</title>
      <dc:description>Over more than 50 years, intermediate valence states in lanthanide compounds have often resulted in unexpected or puzzling spectroscopic and magnetic properties. Such experimental singularities could not be rationalised until new theoretical models involving multiconfigurational electronic ground states and  ab initio  calculations were established. In this minireview, we highlight the different singularities that have been observed among lanthanide complexes, detail the models used to rationalise them and show how such electronic effects may be adjusted depending on energy and symmetry considerations. Understanding and tuning the ground state multiconfigurational behaviour in lanthanide complexes may open new doors to modular and unusual reactivities.</dc:description>

Moreover, they present excellent selectivity and regenerability for CO  2  in mixtures with CH  4  and N  2  in comparison with other reported materials, as evidenced by dynamic breakthrough gas experiments.

      <title>Synthesis of carbapenems containing peptidoglycan&#8208;mimetics and inhibition of the cross&#8208;linking activity of a transpeptidase of the L,D specificity</title>
      <dc:description>The carbapenem class of &#946;&#8208;lactams has been optimized against Gram&#8208;negative bacteria producing extended&#8208;spectrum &#946;&#8208;lactamases by introducing substituents at position C  2  . Carbapenems are currently investigated for the treatment of tuberculosis since these drugs are potent covalent inhibitors of L,D&#8208;transpeptidases involved in mycobacterial cell wall assembly. We sought to optimize carbapenems for inactivation of these unusual targets by exploiting the nucleophilicity of the C  8  hydroxyl group to introduce chemical diversity. Since &#946;&#8208;lactams are structure analogues of peptidoglycan precursors, the substituents were chosen to increase similarity between the drug and the substrate. Fourteen peptido&#8208;carbapenems were efficiently synthesized. They were more effective than the reference drug, meropenem, due to the positive impact of a phenethylthio substituent introduced at position C  2  but the peptidomimetics added at position C  8  did not further improve activity. Thus, position C  8  can be modified to modulate the pharmacokinetic properties of highly efficient carbapenems.</dc:description>

      <title>Cellular fucosylation inhibitors based on fluorinated fucose&#8208;1&#8208;phosphates.</title>
      <dc:description>Fucosylation of glycans impacts a myriad of physiological and pathological processes. Inhibition of fucose expression emerges as a potential therapeutic avenue for example in cancer, inflammation, and infection. In this study, we found that protected 2&#8208;fluorofucose 1&#8208;phosphate efficiently inhibits cellular fucosylation with a four to seven times higher potency than known inhibitor 2FF, independently of the anomeric stereochemistry. Nucleotide sugar analysis revealed that both the &#945;&#8208; and &#946;&#8208;GDP&#8208;2FF anomers are formed inside the cell. In conclusion, we developed A2FF1P and B2FF1P as potent new tools for studying the role of fucosylation in health and disease and they are potential therapeutic candidates.</dc:description>

Inhibition of fucose expression emerges as a potential therapeutic avenue for example in cancer, inflammation, and infection. In this study, we found that protected 2&#8208;fluorofucose 1&#8208;phosphate efficiently inhibits cellular fucosylation with a four to seven times higher potency than known inhibitor 2FF, independently of the anomeric stereochemistry. Nucleotide sugar analysis revealed that both the &#945;&#8208; and &#946;&#8208;GDP&#8208;2FF anomers are formed inside the cell. In conclusion, we developed A2FF1P and B2FF1P as potent new tools for studying the role of fucosylation in health and disease and they are potential therapeutic candidates.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Spin state tunes oxygen atom transfer towards FeIVO formation in FeII complexes</title>
      <dc:description>Oxo&#8208;iron(IV) complexes bearing tetradentate ligands have been extensively studied as models for the active oxidants in non heme iron dependent enzymes. These species are commonly generated by oxidation of their ferrous precursors. The mechanisms of these reactions have been seldom investigated. In this work, the kinetics of reaction of&#160;[Fe  II  (CH  3  CN)  2  L](SbF  6  )  2  ([  1  ]  (SbF  6  )  2  and [  2  ]  (SbF  6  )  2  ) and [Fe  II  (CF  3  SO  3  )  2  L] ([  1  ]  (OTf)  2  and [  2  ]  (OTf)  2  (  1  , L =  Me,H  Pytacn,  2  , L =  nP,H  Pytacn) with Bu  4  NIO  4  to form the&#160;[Fe  IV  (O)(CH  3  CN)L]  2+  (  3  , L =  Me,H  Pytacn,  4  , L =  nP,H  Pytacn) species has been studied. The reactions occur in a single&#160;step with activation parameters independent of the&#160;anion and similar to those&#160;for&#160;substitution&#160;using Cl  &#8208;  , which indicates that formation of [Fe  IV  (O)(CH  3  CN)L]  2+  is kinetically controlled by substitution&#160;to form [Fe  II  (IO  4  )(CH  3  CN)L]  +  intermediates that convert rapidly to the oxo complexes . The kinetics of the reaction is strongly dependent on the spin state of the starting complex. A detailed analysis of the magnetic&#160;susceptibility and kinetic data&#160;reveals that the experimental&#160;activation parameters&#160;are the result of a partial compensation of the contributions from the&#160;spin crossover equilibrium and the substitution.

      <title>Benzothiadiazole substituted aza&#8208;BODIPY dyes: two&#8208;photon absorption enhancement for improved optical limiting performances in the SWIR range.</title>
      <dc:description>Aza&#8208;boron dipyrromethenes (aza&#8208;BODIPYs) presenting a benzothiadiazole substitution on upper positions are described. The strong electron&#8208;withdrawing effect of the benzothiadiazole moiety permits to enhance the accepting strength and improve the delocalisation of the aza&#8208;BODIPY core to attain a significant degree of electronic communication between the lower donating groups and the upper accepting groups. The nature of the intramolecular charge transfer is studied both experimentally and theoretically. Linear spectroscopy highlighted the strongly red&#8208;shifted absorption and emission of the synthesized molecules with recorded fluorescence spectra over 1000 nm. Nonlinear optical properties were also investigated. Strong enhancement of the two&#8208;photon absorption of the substituted dyes compared to the unsubstituted one (up to 4520 GM at 1300 nm) results in a ca. 15 &#8208; 20% improvement of the optical power limiting performances. These dyes are therefore a good starting point for further improvement of optical power limiting in the SWIR range.</dc:description>

      <title>Cyclo&#8208;Ketal Xanthene Dyes: A New Class of Near&#8208;Infrared Fluorophores for Super&#8208;Resolution Imaging of Live Cells</title>
      <dc:description>Newly emerging super&#8208;resolution imaging techniques provide opportunities for precise observations on cellular microstructures. However, they also impose severe demands on fluorophores. Here, we develop a new series of NIR xanthene dyes, named as KRhs, by replacing the 10&#8208;position O of rhodamines with a cyclo&#8208;ketal. KRhs display intense NIR emission peaked at 700 nm with fluorescence quantum yields up to 0.64. More importantly, they, without the aid of any enhancing buffer, exhibit stochastic fluorescence off&#8208;on switches to support time&#8208;resolved localization of single&#8208;fluorophore. KRhs are functionalized into KRh&#8208;MitoFix, KRh&#8208;Mem and KRh&#8208;Halo that demonstrate mitochondria, plasma membrane and fusion protein targeting ability respectively. Consequently, these KRh probes demonstrate straightforward usage for super&#8208;resolution imaging of these targets in live cells. Therefore, KRhs merit future development for fluorescence labeling and super&#8208;resolution imaging in the NIR region.</dc:description>

Both  L1  and  L2  induce parallel G&#8208;quadruplexes from hybrid structures (K  +  ) and  L1  induce hybrid G&#8208;quadruplexes from antiparallel conformations (Na  +  ).

We go further to explore precursor&#8208;solvent combinations that can be used to create metal sulfide nanoparticles in the gas&#8208;phase.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Structurally Modelling the 2&#8208;His&#8208;1&#8208;Carboxylate Facial Triad with a Bulky N,N,O Phenolate Ligand</title>
      <dc:description>We present the synthesis and coordination chemistry of a bulky, tripodal  N,N,O  ligand,  Im  Ph2  NNO  tBu  (  L  ), designed to model the 2&#8208;His&#8208;1&#8208;carboxylate facial triad (2H1C) by means of two imidazole groups and an anionic 2,4&#8208;di&#8208;  tert  &#8208;butyl&#8208;subtituted phenolate. Reacting  K&#8208;L  with MCl  2  (M = Fe, Zn) affords the isostructural, tetrahedral non&#8208;heme complexes [Fe(L)(Cl)] (  1  ) and [Zn(L)(Cl)] (  2  ) in high yield. The tridentate  N,N,O  ligand coordination observed in their X&#8208;ray crystal structures remains intact and well&#8208;defined in MeCN and CH  2  Cl  2  solution. Reacting  2  with NaSPh affords a non&#8208;heme zinc thiolate complex, [Zn(L)(SPh)] (  4  ), that is relevant to isopenicillin N synthase (IPNS) biomimicry. Cyclic voltammetry studies demonstrate the ligand&#8217;s redox non&#8208;innocence, where phenolate oxidation is the first electrochemical response observed in  K&#8208;L  ,  2  and  4  . However, the first electrochemical oxidation in  1  is iron&#8208;centred, the assignment of which is supported by DFT calculations. Overall,  Im  Ph2  NNO  tBu  provides access to well&#8208;defined mononuclear, monoligated,  N,N,O  &#8208;bound metal complexes, enabling more accurate structural modelling of the 2H1C to be achieved.</dc:description>
