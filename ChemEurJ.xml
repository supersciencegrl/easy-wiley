         <title>Chiral 4&#8208;MeO&#8208;Pyridine (MOPY) Catalyst for Enantioselective Cyclopropanation: Attenuation of Lewis Basicity Leads to Improved Catalytic Efficiency</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rational design of Lewis base catalyst by fine&#8208;tuning of pyridine Lewis basicity has allowed for the development of chiral 4&#8208;MeO&#8208;pyridine (MOPY) catalyst for enantioselective cyclopropanation.







Abstract
The design of pyridine&#8208;derived organocatalysts aims at the increase of their Lewis basicity, however such an approach is not always efficient. For example, strongly Lewis basic DMAP is completely inefficient as catalyst in the cyclopropanation reaction. Herein we disclose an alternative approach that relies on attenuation of DMAP Lewis basicity. Specifically, the replacement of 4&#8208;dimethylamino substituent in DMAP for 4&#8208;MeO group delivered a highly efficient catalyst for cyclopropanation of electron&#8208;deficient olefins with &#945;&#8208;bromoketones. Kinetic studies provide compelling evidence that the superior catalytic efficiency of 4&#8208;MeO pyridine (MOPY) is to be attributed to the favorable balance between Lewis basicity and leaving group ability. The use of chiral, enantiomerically pure MOPY catalyst has helped to achieve high enantioselectivities (up to 91&#8201;:&#8201;9 er) in the previously unreported pyridine&#8208;catalyzed cyclopropanation reaction.

         <title>Development of Platinum Complexes for Tumor Chemoimmunotherapy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chemoimmunotherapy is a novel treatment for cancers via synergy between chemotherapy and immunotherapy. Pt complexes could be developed into chemoimmunotherapeutic agents as inducers of immunogenic cell death, inhibitors of immune checkpoint, stimulators of immune response, relievers of immunosupression, or modulators of immune signal. They reshape the tumor microenvironment and reinforce the antitumor activity.







Abstract
Platinum complexes are potential antitumor drugs in chemotherapy. Their impact on tumor treatment could be greatly strengthened by combining with immunotherapy. Increasing evidences indicate that the antitumor activity of platinum complexes is not limited to chemical killing effects, but also extends to immunomodulatory actions. This review introduced the general concept of chemoimmunotherapy and summarized the progress of platinum complexes as chemoimmunotherapeutic agents in recent years. Platinum complexes could be developed into inducers of immunogenic cell death, blockers of immune checkpoint, regulators of immune signaling pathway, and modulators of tumor immune microenvironment, etc. The synergy between chemotherapeutic and immunomodulatory effects reinforces the antitumor activity of platinum complexes, and helps them circumvent the drug resistance and systemic toxicity. The exploration of platinum complexes for chemoimmunotherapy may create new opportunities to revive the discovery of metal anticancer drugs.

         <title>Rhodium&#8208;Mediated Dehydrogenation of Hydroboranes and Group 14 Compounds: Base&#8208;Stabilized Silylene and Germylene Complexes vs. Transmetalation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dehydrogenation of Group 13 and 14 substrates has been explored by using a rhodium pincer complex. While primary and secondary silanes and germanes are able to release H2 (blast off!), generating silylene and germylene compounds, the grounded boron and tin symbolize synthetic challenges with respect to this process. The same rhodium complex is able to catalyze the dehydrogenative coupling of silanes/germanes with pinacol; an example product is illustrated as a constellation in the night sky. More information can be found in the Research Article by S.&#8208;J. Hsiang and P.&#8197;G. Hayes (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202302925).

         <title>Preparation of carbon&#8208;coated Fe2O3@Ti3C2Tx composites by mussel&#8208;like modifications as high&#8208;performance anodes for lithium&#8208;ion batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Carbon&#8208;coated Fe2O3@Ti3C2Tx composites as high&#8208;performance anode were synthesized by a mussel&#8208;like modification method, where electronegative group (&#8722;OH) on polydopamine can easily coordinate with Fe3+ ions as well as form hydrogen bonds with the &#8722;OH terminal group on the Ti3C2Tx surface, which induces a uniform distribution of Fe2O3 on the Ti3C2Tx surface. Meanwhile, the polydopamine&#8208;derived carbon layer protects Ti3C2Tx from oxidation.







Abstract
Fe2O3 with high theoretical capacity (1007&#8197;mA&#8201;h&#8201;g&#8722;1) and low cost is a potential anode material for lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs), but its practical application is restricted by its low electrical conductivity and large volume changes during lithiation/delithiation. To solve these problems, Fe2O3@Ti3C2Tx composites were synthesized by a mussel&#8208;like modification method, which relies on the self&#8208;polymerization of dopamine under mild conditions. During polymerization, the electronegative group (&#8722;OH) on dopamine can easily coordinate with Fe3+ ions as well as form hydrogen bonds with the &#8722;OH terminal group on the surface of Ti3C2Tx, which induces a uniform distribution of Fe2O3 on the Ti3C2Tx surface and mitigates self&#8208;accumulation of MXene nanosheets. In addition, the polydopamine&#8208;derived carbon layer protects Ti3C2Tx from oxidation during the hydrothermal process, which can further improve the electrical conductivity of the composites and buffer the volume expansion and particle agglomeration of Fe2O3. As a result, Fe2O3@Ti3C2Tx anodes exhibit ~100&#8201;% capacity retention with almost no capacity loss at 0.5&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 250 cycles, and a stable capacity of 430&#8197;mA&#8201;h&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 2&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 500 cycles. The unique structural design of this work provides new ideas for the development of MXene&#8208;based composites in energy storage applications.

         <title>Synthesis of Trifluoromethylated Monoterpenes by an Engineered Cytochrome P450</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The carbene transfer reaction was realized in the biosynthetic pathway. Using L&#8208;limonene as the precursor, L&#8208;carveol was biotransformed by P411&#8208;PFA to generate unnatural terpenoid derivatives with trifluoromethyl group.







Abstract
Protein engineering of cytochrome P450s has enabled these biocatalysts to promote a variety of abiotic reactions beyond nature&#8216;s repertoire. Integrating such non&#8208;natural transformations with microbial biosynthetic pathways could allow sustainable enzymatic production of modified natural product derivatives. In particular, trifluoromethylation is a highly desirable modification in pharmaceutical research due to the positive effects of the trifluoromethyl group on drug potency, bioavailability, and metabolic stability. This study demonstrates the biosynthesis of non&#8208;natural trifluoromethyl&#8208;substituted cyclopropane derivatives of natural monoterpene scaffolds using an engineered cytochrome P450 variant, P411&#8208;PFA. P411&#8208;PFA successfully catalyzed the transfer of a trifluoromethyl carbene from 2&#8208;diazo&#8208;1,1,1&#8208;trifluoroethane to the terminal alkenes of several monoterpenes, including L&#8208;carveol, carvone, perilla alcohol, and perillartine, to generate the corresponding trifluoromethylated cyclopropane products. Furthermore, integration of this abiotic cyclopropanation reaction with a reconstructed metabolic pathway for L&#8208;carveol production in Escherichia coli enabled one&#8208;step biosynthesis of a trifluoromethylated L&#8208;carveol derivative from limonene precursor. Overall, amalgamating synthetic enzymatic chemistry with established metabolic pathways represents a promising approach to sustainably produce bioactive natural product analogs.

&lt;p&gt;The carbene transfer reaction was realized in the biosynthetic pathway. Using L-limonene as the precursor, L-carveol was biotransformed by P411-PFA to generate unnatural terpenoid derivatives with trifluoromethyl group.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Protein engineering of cytochrome P450s has enabled these biocatalysts to promote a variety of abiotic reactions beyond nature&#8216;s repertoire. Integrating such non-natural transformations with microbial biosynthetic pathways could allow sustainable enzymatic production of modified natural product derivatives. In particular, trifluoromethylation is a highly desirable modification in pharmaceutical research due to the positive effects of the trifluoromethyl group on drug potency, bioavailability, and metabolic stability. This study demonstrates the biosynthesis of non-natural trifluoromethyl-substituted cyclopropane derivatives of natural monoterpene scaffolds using an engineered cytochrome P450 variant, P411-PFA. P411-PFA successfully catalyzed the transfer of a trifluoromethyl carbene from 2-diazo-1,1,1-trifluoroethane to the terminal alkenes of several monoterpenes, including L-carveol, carvone, perilla alcohol, and perillartine, to generate the corresponding trifluoromethylated cyclopropane products. Furthermore, integration of this abiotic cyclopropanation reaction with a reconstructed metabolic pathway for L-carveol production in &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; enabled one-step biosynthesis of a trifluoromethylated L-carveol derivative from limonene precursor. Overall, amalgamating synthetic enzymatic chemistry with established metabolic pathways represents a promising approach to sustainably produce bioactive natural product analogs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Stepwise Functionalization of a Pillar[5]arene&#8208;Containing [2]Rotaxane with Pentafluorophenyl Ester Stoppers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The pillar[5]arene acts as an umbrella to protect the axle of the rotaxane from nucleophiles. Indeed, reaction of a nucleophile with the first activated ester stopper of a symmetrical rotaxane building block affords a mono&#8208;acylated intermediate in which the pillar[5]arene moiety is preferentially located close to the remaining pentafluorophenyl ester stopper. As a result, the accessibility of the second reactive carbonyl group by the nucleophilic reagent is limited, and selective mono&#8208;functionalization is very efficient. More information can be found in the Research Article by I. Nierengarten, J.&#8208;F. Nierengarten and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202303501).

         <title>Orbital Analysis Captures the Existence of a Mixed&#8208;Valent CuIII&#8722;O&#8722;CuII Active&#8208;Site and its Role in Water&#8208;Assisted Aliphatic Hydroxylation</title>

         <dc:description>The Cu&#8722;O&#8722;Cu core has been proposed as a potential site for methane oxidation in particulate methane monooxygenase. In this work, we used density functional theory (DFT) to design a mixed&#8208;valent CuIII&#8722;O&#8722;CuII species from an experimentally known peroxo&#8208;dicopper complex supported by N&#8208;donor ligands containing phenolic groups. We found that the transfer of two&#8208;protons and two&#8208;electrons from phenolic groups to peroxo&#8208;dicopper core takes places, which results to the formation of a bis&#8208;&#956;&#8208;hydroxo&#8208;dicopper core. The bis&#8208;&#956;&#8208;hydroxo&#8208;dicopper core converts to a mixed&#8208;valent CuIII&#8722;O&#8722;CuII core with the removal of a water molecule. The orbital and spin density analyses unravel the mixed&#8208;valent nature of CuIII&#8722;O&#8722;CuII. We further investigated the reactivity of this mixed&#8208;valent core for aliphatic C&#8722;H hydroxylation. Our study unveiled that mixed&#8208;valent CuIII&#8722;O&#8722;CuII core follows a hydrogen atom transfer mechanism for C&#8722;H activation. An in&#8208;situ generated water molecule plays an important role in C&#8722;H hydroxylation by acting as a proton transfer bridge between carbon and oxygen. Furthermore, to assess the relevance of a mixed&#8208;valent CuIII&#8722;O&#8722;CuII core, we investigated aliphatic C&#8722;H activation by a symmetrical CuII&#8722;O&#8722;CuII core. DFT results show that the mixed&#8208;valent CuIII&#8722;O&#8722;CuII core is more reactive toward the C&#8722;H bond than the symmetrical CuII&#8722;O&#8722;CuII core.</dc:description>

         <title>A Two&#8208;dimensional Metal&#8722;Organic Framework as Promising Cathode for Advanced Lithium Storage</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Anthraquinone electrode materials are promising candidates for lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) due to the abundance,&#160;high theoretical capacity, and good reversibility of&#160; anthraquinone electrodes. However, the active anthraquinone materials are soluble in organic electrolytes, resulting in a sharp decay of capacity during the charge and discharge processes. Herein, we report on a two&#8208;dimensional calcium anthraquinone 2,3&#8208;dicarboxy metal&#8208;organic framework (2D CaAQDC MOF) fabricated using a simple hydrothermal method. The 2D CaAQDC MOF not only effectively inhibits the dissolution of active electrode substances into the electrolyte, but also promotes the diffusion of lithium ions into the pores of the MOF. When used as a cathode for the LIBs, the resulting CaAQDC electrode delivers a high specific capacity of ~100 mAh&#183;g&#8208;1 at a current density of 50 mA&#183;g&#8208;1 after 200 cycles, demonstrating its good cycle stability. Even at a high current density of 200 mA&#183;g&#8208;1, the CaAQDC electrode exhibits a specific capacity of ~60 mAh&#183;g&#8208;1. The fabricated 2D coordination polymers effectively restrains the dissolution of anthraquinone into the organic electrolyte and enhances the structural stability, which greatly improves the electrochemical performance of anthraquinone. These research results offer a rational molecular design strategy to address the dissolution of this and other active organic electrode materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Cu&#8208;Catalyzed Coupling of Aliphatic Amines with Alkylboronic Esters</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report a Cu&#8208;catalyzed oxidative coupling of aliphatic amines with benzylic and aliphatic boronic esters to give high value alkyl amines, products found widely in applications from medicinal chemistry to materials science. This operationally simple reaction, which can be performed on gram scale, runs under mild conditions and exhibits broad functional group tolerance. The terminal oxidant of the reaction is O2 from the air, avoiding the need for additional chemical oxidants. Investigation into the reaction mechanism suggests that the boronic ester is activated by an aminyl radical, formed through oxidation of the amine by the Cu catalyst, to give a key alkyl radical intermediate. To demonstrate its utility and potential for late&#8208;stage functionalization, we showcase the method as the final step in the total synthesis of a TRPV1 antagonist.</dc:description>

         <title>Polar covalent apex&#8208;base bonding in borapyramidanes probed by solid&#8208;state NMR and DFT calculations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy has been applied to probe the bonding properties of borapyramidane molecules. Combining the spectroscopic and quantum&#8208;chemical data, the bonding scenario is best described as covalent with a high degree of polarity. The study highlights the high sensitivity of NMR in probing bonding properties.







Abstract
Pyramidane molecules have attracted chemists for many decades due to their regular shape, high symmetry and their correspondence in the macroscopic world. Recently, experimental access to a number of examples has been reported, in particular the rarely reported square pyramidal bora[4]pyramidanes. To describe the bonding situation of the nonclassical structure of pyramidanes, we present solid&#8208;state Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) as a versatile tool for deciphering such bonding properties for three now accessible bora[4]pyramidane and dibora[5]pyramidane molecules. 11B solid&#8208;state NMR spectra indicate that the apical boron nuclei in these compounds are strongly shielded (around &#8722;50&#8197;ppm vs. BF3&#8208;Et2O complex) and possess quadrupolar coupling constants of less than 0.9&#8197;MHz pointing to a rather high local symmetry. 13C&#8722;11B spin&#8208;spin coupling constants have been explored as a measure of the bond covalency in the borapyramidanes. While the carbon&#8208;boron bond to the &#8722;B(C6F5)2 substituents of the base serves as an example for a classical covalent 2&#8208;center&#8208;2&#8208;electron (2c&#8211;2e) sp2&#8208;carbon&#8208;sp2&#8208;boron &#963;&#8208;bond with 1J(13C&#8208;11B) coupling constants in the order of 75&#8197;Hz, those of the boron(apical)&#8208;carbon(basal) bonds in the pyramid are too small to measure. These results suggest that these bonds have a strongly ionic character, which is also supported by quantum&#8208;chemical calculations.

         <title>Reactive Reductive Species Participating Photodynamic Therapy for Cancer Treatment</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 1, January 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reductive phototherapy takes advantage of endogenous substances such as GSH and NADH to drive photoredox catalysis and produce reactive reductive species (RRS) for antioxidant defense. The basic concept on RRSs (e.&#8201;g., H&#8901; and electrons) participating in reductive photodynamic therapy (R&#8208;PDT) holds great potential in fighting cancers under extremely hypoxic conditions.







Abstract
Although the development of oxidative photodynamic therapy (O&#8208;PDT) based on reactive oxygen species (ROS) has led to great progress in cancer treatment, tumor hypoxia, cellular adaptation and intrinsic antioxidant defenses are still obstacles at this stage. Fortunately, with the discovery and development of reactive reductive species (RRS) in the PDT process, reductive PDT (R&#8208;PDT) is receiving increasing research interest. R&#8208;PDT with oxygen&#8208;independence is an effective reduction therapy that promises excellent therapeutic efficacy in extremely hypoxic or even anaerobic environments. In the concept, we introduce representative strategies to boost the type&#8208;I photosensitizing pathway, and then focus on the most recent R&#8208;PDT involving hydrogen radical (H&#8901;) and the single electron transfer (SET) process.

         <title>Catalyst&#8208;Free Transfer Hydrogenation from Amine&#8208;Borane Small Oligomers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 1, January 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Small hydrogen&#8208;rich amine&#8208;borane oligomers were prepared via capping agent&#8208;controlled AA/BB polycondensation. Solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy, Differential Scanning Calorimetry and reactivity in catalyst&#8208;free transfer hydrogenations &#8211; to aldehydes, imines, electron&#8208;poor alkenes and alkynes &#8211; were used to assess how the oligomers bridge the gap between molecular amine&#8208;boranes and poly(amine&#8208;borane)s.







Abstract
Amine&#8208;borane dimers and oligomers with varied steric and electronic profiles were prepared via capping agent&#8208;controlled AA/BB polycondensations. They were used for transfer hydrogenations to aldehydes, ketones, imines as well as electron&#8208;poor alkene/alkyne moieties. The amine&#8208;borane Lewis&#8208;paired oligomers and the congested bis(amine&#8208;borane)s provided the highest yields. This was likely helped by facilitated dissociation (oligomers) or H&#8208;bond assistance. In the case of the oligomers, the second equivalent of H2 present was also engaged in the reaction. Solid&#8208;state NMR characterization provides evidence that the boron&#8208;containing materials obtained after transfer dehydrogenation are highly similar to those obtained from thermal dehydrogenation. The oligomers bridge the gap between simple amine&#8208;borane molecular reductants and the poly&#8208;amine&#8208;boranes and provide a full picture of the reactivity changes at the different scales.

Three in one: The interplay of three redox&#8208;active diguanidinobenzene units in hexaguanidino&#8208;triptycene and triphenylene molecules affects the redox&#8208;chemistry of the free and coordinated molecules.







Abstract
Novel redox&#8208;active hexaguanidine molecules with multiple redox states were synthesized by connecting three o&#8208;diguanidinobenzene units. In 2,3,6,7,14,15&#8208;hexaguanidino&#8208;triptycenes, the three redox&#8208;active o&#8208;diguanidinobenzene units are connected through C&#8722;C bonds to the sp3&#8208;hybridized bridgehead C atoms, and in 2,3,6,7,10,11&#8208;hexaguanidino&#8208;triphenylenes they are directly connected. The connectivity difference leads to different electronic coupling between the three redox&#8208;active o&#8208;diguanidinobenzene units, with homoconjugation being present in the triptycene, but not in the triphenylene compounds. Motivated by the appearance of an intense low&#8208;energy electronic transition, we especially analysed the effect of homoconjugation on the electronic structure and charge delocalization in the dicationic redox state of the triptycene derivatives. Then, several trinuclear high&#8208;spin cobalt (and copper) complexes were synthesized with the triphenylene and triptycene ligands, and the magnetic coupling and redox properties analysed. By choice of the coligands (hexafluoroacetylacetonate, trifluoroacetylacetonate and acetylacetonate), oxidation could be switched between metal&#8208; and ligand&#8208;centered redox events, leading to drastic changes in the magnetic or optical properties, especially as a consequence of homoconjugation in the triptycene derivatives.

         <title>Simple Synthesis of 1,2&#8208;Dideoxy&#8208;2&#8208;Vinyl Carbohydrates by Tin&#8208;Free Radical Reactions of Xanthates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 1, January 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Radical and non&#8208;toxic: C&#8208;Branched carbohydrates 3 are easily available from glycals 1 via xanthates 2. Key step is a radical reaction with triethylborane, which proceeds under mild conditions with high regioselectivity. Various side products have been isolated in pure form. They speak for a reversible ring&#8208;opening of the intermediary cyclopropylmethyl radicals, which is interesting for the mechanistic understanding of such reactions.







Abstract
Vinyl&#8208;substituted carbohydrates have been synthesized from glycals derived from hexoses and pentoses. Key step is the radical reaction of xanthates in the presence of triethylborane, a non&#8208;toxic reagent. The mechanism has been investigated by isolation of various side products, which speak for a reversibility of the cyclopropylmethyl radical ring&#8208;opening. Compared to reactions with tributyltin hydride, higher regioselectivities in favor of the 2&#8208;vinyl&#8208;substituted sugars have been obtained. Yields are slightly lower with triethylborane, but all products have been isolated in analytically pure form. The new reaction is applicable to benzyl&#8208; and silyl&#8208;protected carbohydrates, which makes free sugars accessible as well. Overall, more than 15 1,2&#8208;dideoxy&#8208;2&#8208;vinyl carbohydrates have been synthesized from simple precursors in only few steps.

         <title>Underwater Adhesives from Redox&#8208;Responsive Polyplexes of Thiolated Polyamide Polyelectrolytes</title>

Redox&#8208;responsive underwater adhesives exhibiting high optical transparency, biodegradability and strong adhesion of biological substrates were prepared from polyplexes of oppositely charged partially&#8208;thiolated polyamide polyelectrolytes (TPEs).







Abstract
We report the fabrication of optically clear underwater adhesives using polyplexes of oppositely charged partially&#8208;thiolated polyamide polyelectrolytes (TPEs). The thiol content of the constituent PEs was varied to assess its influence on the adhesive properties of the resulting glues. These catechol&#8208;free, redox&#8208;responsive TPE&#8208;adhesives were formulated in aquo and exhibited high optical transparency and strong adhesion even on submerged or moist surfaces of diverse polar substrates such as glass, aluminium, wood, and bone pieces. The adhesives could be cured under water through oxidative disulphide crosslinking of the constituent TPEs. The polyamide backbone provided multi&#8208;site H&#8208;bonding interactions with the substrates while the disulphide crosslinking provided the cohesive strength to the glue. Strong adhesion of mammalian bones (load bearing capacity upto 7&#8197;kg/cm2) was achieved using the adhesive containing 30&#8197;mol&#8201;% thiol residues. Higher pH and use of oxidants such as povidone&#8208;iodine solution enhanced the curing rate of the adhesives, and so did the use of Tris buffer instead of Phosphate buffer. The porous architecture of the adhesive and its progressive degradation in aqueous medium over the course of three weeks bode well for diverse biomedical applications where temporary adhesion of tissues is required.

Unraveling the mysteries of ring current combinations in polycyclic benzenoid hydrocarbons.







Abstract
Nowadays, an active research topic is the connection between Clar's rule, aromaticity, and magnetic properties of polycyclic benzenoid hydrocarbons. In the present work, we employ a meticulous magnetically induced current density analysis to define the net current flowing through any cyclic circuit, connecting it to aromaticity based on the ring current concept. Our investigation reveals that the analyzed polycyclic systems display a prominent global ring current, contrasting with subdued semi&#8208;local and local ring currents. These patterns align with Clar's aromatic &#960;&#8208;sextets only in cases where migrating &#960;&#8208;sextet structures are invoked. The results of this study will enrich our comprehension of aromaticity and magnetic behavior in such systems, offering significant insights into coexisting ring current circuits in these systems.

The increasing prevalence of neurodegenerative diseases has prompted researchers to develop advanced three&#8208;dimensional models that accurately mimic neuronal tissues. In this regard, the synthesis of an acrylamide&#8208;based hydrogel incorporating the peptide sequence arginine&#8208;glycine&#8208;aspartic acid has been carried out, examined in depth the matrix properties that govern cell behavior.







Abstract
The increasing prevalence of neurodegenerative diseases has spurred researchers to develop advanced 3D models that accurately mimic neural tissues. Hydrogels stand out as ideal candidates as their properties closely resemble those of the extracellular matrix. A critical challenge in this regard is to comprehend the influence of the scaffold&#8216;s mechanical properties on cell growth and differentiation, thus enabling targeted modifications. In light of this, a synthesis and comprehensive analysis of acrylamide&#8208;based hydrogels incorporating a peptide has been conducted. Adequate cell adhesion and development is achieved due to their bioactive nature and specific interactions with cellular receptors. The integration of a precisely controlled physicochemical hydrogel matrix and inclusion of the arginine&#8208;glycine&#8208;aspartic acid peptide sequence has endowed this system with an optimal structure, thus providing a unique ability to interact effectively with biomolecules. The analysis fully examined essential properties governing cell behavior, including pore size, mechanical characteristics, and swelling ability. Cell&#8208;viability experiments were performed to assess the hydrogel's biocompatibility, while the incorporation of grow factors aimed to promote the differentiation of neuroblastoma cells. The results underscore the hydrogel's ability to stimulate cell viability and differentiation in the presence of the peptide within the matrix.

Borrowing hydrogen: The catalytic efficiency of phosphine&#8208;free non&#8208;bifunctional MnI&#8722;NHC complexes of chelating heteroditopic ligands featuring ImNHC connected to a 1,2,3&#8208;triazole&#8208;N or tzNHC donors through a methylene spacer have been explored for coupling of diverse nitriles with alcohols by borrowing hydrogen protocol. The catalyst Mn1 containing ImNHC connected to triazole&#8208;N donor displayed higher activity than Mn2/Mn3 containing an unsymmetrical bis&#8208;carbene donors (ImNHC and tzNHC).







Abstract
In the present work, several manganese(I) complexes of chelating heteroditopic ligands Mn1&#8211;3, featuring ImNHC (imidazol&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene) connected to a 1,2,3&#8208;triazole&#8208;N or tzNHC (1,2,3&#8208;triazol&#8208;5&#8208;ylidene) donors via a methylene spacer, with possible modifications at the triazole backbone have been synthesized and completely characterized. Notably, the CO stretching frequencies, electrochemical analysis, and frontier orbital analysis certainly suggest that the chelating ImNHC&#8208;tzNHC ligands have stronger donation capabilities than the related ImNHC&#8208;Ntz ligand in the synthesized complexes. Moreover, these well&#8208;defined phosphine&#8208;free Mn(I)&#8722;NHC complexes have been found to be effective non&#8208;bifunctional catalysts for the &#945;&#8208;alkylation of nitriles using alcohols and importantly, the catalyst Mn1 containing ImNHC connected to a weaker triazole&#8208;N donor displayed higher activity compared to Mn2/Mn3 containing an unsymmetrical bis&#8208;carbene donors (ImNHC and tzNHC). A wide range of aryl nitriles were coupled with diverse (hetero)aromatic as well as aliphatic alcohols to get the corresponding products in good to excellent yields (32 examples, up to 95&#8201;% yield). The detailed mechanistic studies including deuterium labelling experiments reveal that the reaction follows a Borrowing Hydrogen pathway.

The catalyst &lt;b&gt;Mn1&lt;/b&gt; containing ImNHC connected to triazole-N donor displayed higher activity than &lt;b&gt;Mn2/Mn3&lt;/b&gt; containing an unsymmetrical bis-carbene donors (ImNHC and tzNHC).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the present work, several manganese(I) complexes of chelating heteroditopic ligands &lt;b&gt;Mn1&#8211;3&lt;/b&gt;, featuring ImNHC (imidazol-2-ylidene) connected to a 1,2,3-triazole-N or tzNHC (1,2,3-triazol-5-ylidene) donors via a methylene spacer, with possible modifications at the triazole backbone have been synthesized and completely characterized. Notably, the CO stretching frequencies, electrochemical analysis, and frontier orbital analysis certainly suggest that the chelating ImNHC-tzNHC ligands have stronger donation capabilities than the related ImNHC-Ntz ligand in the synthesized complexes. Moreover, these well-defined phosphine-free Mn(I)&#8722;NHC complexes have been found to be effective non-bifunctional catalysts for the &#945;-alkylation of nitriles using alcohols and importantly, the catalyst &lt;b&gt;Mn1&lt;/b&gt; containing ImNHC connected to a weaker triazole-N donor displayed higher activity compared to &lt;b&gt;Mn2&lt;/b&gt;/&lt;b&gt;Mn3&lt;/b&gt; containing an unsymmetrical bis-carbene donors (ImNHC and tzNHC). A wide range of aryl nitriles were coupled with diverse (hetero)aromatic as well as aliphatic alcohols to get the corresponding products in good to excellent yields (32 examples, up to 95&#8201;% yield). The detailed mechanistic studies including deuterium labelling experiments reveal that the reaction follows a Borrowing Hydrogen pathway.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Hydrazine Sulfonic Acid, NH3NH(SO3), the Bigger Sibling of Sulfamic Acid</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 1, January 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydrazine sulfonic acid has been structurally elucidated for the first time. Like its smaller congener, sulfamic acid, the acid crystallizes as a zwitterion in the solid state. The hydrazine sulfonate anion is accessible by deprotonation, as demonstrated for Ba[N2H3(SO3)]2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;H2O.







Abstract
The reaction of hydrazine hydrate, N2H4&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;H2O, and SO3 leads to hydrazine sulfonic acid (Pca21, a=849.59(4)&#8197;pm, b=482.18(2)&#8197;pm, c=832.17(4)&#8197;pm). Structure elucidation reveals the zwitter&#8208;anionic nature of the compound according to NH3NH(SO3). With the barium salt Ba[NH2NH(SO3)]2(H2O), a first salt of hydrazine sulfonic acid has been prepared (P
, a=489.75(5)&#8197;pm, b=737.52(7)&#8197;pm, c=1317.4(1)&#8197;pm, &#945;=88.238(4)&#176;, &#946;=84.761(4)&#176;, &#947;=79.701(4)&#176;). The compounds were characterized by vibrational spectroscopy, DFT calculations and thermal analyses.

         <title>New Protocol for the Synthesis of S&#8208;Thioesters from Benzylic, Allylic and Tertiary Alcohols with Thioacetic Acid</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 1, January 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reaction of activated alcohols with neat thioacetic acid catalyzed by HBF4 provides a convenient entry into thioacetates, protected version of the corresponding thiols; the generation of intermediate acetates and thionoacetates and the mechanism of their further conversion to the final products has been fully rationalized.







Abstract
A new one&#8208;pot solvent&#8208;less reaction to convert benzylic, allylic, ferrocenyl or tertiary alcohols into S&#8208;thioesters, bench&#8208;stable and less odorous precursors of the corresponding thiols, which is based on reactions in neat thioacetic acid in the presence of tetrafluoroboric acid, is presented. Reaction monitoring by NMR and GC of the benzyl alcohol conversion indicated the intermediate formation of benzyl acetate and benzyl thionoacetate (PhCH2OC(S)CH3) prior to the slower conversion to the final S&#8208;benzyl thioacetate product. Increasing the HBF4 concentration enhanced the reaction rate, giving good to excellent yield (up to 99&#8201;%) for a large scope of alcohols. Control experiments, with support of DFT calculations, have revealed a thermodynamically favorable, though requiring HBF4&#8208;activation, disproportionation of CH3C(O)SH to CH3C(O)OH and CH3C(S)SH, the latter immediately decomposing to H2S and (MeC)4S6 but also generating the hitherto unreported [MeC(O)C(Me)S]2(&#956;&#8208;S)2. Kinetic investigations demonstrated that the rate of benzyl alcohol conversion is second&#8208;order in [PhCH2OH] and second order in [HBF4], while the rate of conversion of the benzyl acetate intermediate to S&#8208;benzyl thioacetate is second order in [PhCOOMe] and fourth order in [HBF4]. The DFT calculations rationalize the need to two alcohol molecules and two protons to generate the reactive benzyl cation.

         <title>Molecular Accessibility and Diffusion of Resorufin in Zeolite Crystals</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 1, January 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Resorufin has been investigated as a fluorescent probe for 3D microimaging in microporous materials. Understanding the processes, such as aggregation, that affect the measured fluorescence intensity enables the probe to be used to measure real&#8208;time diffusion, microporosity, and accessibility in zeolite&#8208;&#946; crystals.







Abstract
We have used confocal laser scanning microscopy on the small, fluorescent resorufin dye molecule to visualize molecular accessibility and diffusion in the hierarchical, anisotropic pore structure of large (~10&#8197;&#956;m&#8208;sized) zeolite&#8208;&#946; crystals. The resorufin dye is widely used in life and materials science, but only in its deprotonated form because the protonated molecule is barely fluorescent in aqueous solution. In this work, we show that protonated resorufin is in fact strongly fluorescent when confined within zeolite micropores, thus enabling fluorescence microimaging experiments. We find that J&#8208;aggregation guest&#8211;guest interactions lead to a decrease in the measured fluorescence intensity that can be prevented by using non&#8208;fluorescent spacer molecules. We characterized the pore space by introducing resorufin from the outside solution and following its diffusion into zeolite&#8208;&#946; crystals. The eventual homogeneous distribution of resorufin molecules throughout the zeolite indicates a fully accessible pore network. This enables the quantification of the diffusion coefficient in the straight pores of zeolite&#8208;&#946; without the need for complex analysis, and we found a value of 3&#215;10&#8722;15&#8197;m2&#8197;s&#8722;1. Furthermore, we saw that diffusion through the straight pores of zeolite&#8208;&#946; is impeded when crossing the boundaries between zeolite subunits.

         <title>Tuning the Optical Properties Through Hydrogen Bond&#8208;assisted H&#8208;aggregate Formation: The ODIN Case</title>

Hydrogen bond&#8208;assisted H&#8208;aggregate: Our work focuses on the investigation of two functionalized naphthyridine derivatives, namely ODIN&#8208;EtPh and ODIN&#8208;But, to gain insights into the hydrogen bond&#8208;assisted H&#8208;aggregate formation and its impact on the optical properties of ODIN molecules. A synergic approach of X&#8208;ray and electron crystallography, linear and non&#8208;linear (ultrafast) optical Spectroscopy and computation was employed.







Abstract
The current work focuses on the investigation of two functionalized naphthyridine derivatives, namely ODIN&#8208;EtPh and ODIN&#8208;But, to gain insights into the hydrogen bond&#8208;assisted H&#8208;aggregate formation and its impact on the optical properties of ODIN molecules. By employing a combination of X&#8208;ray and electron crystallography, absorption and emission spectroscopy, time resolved fluorescence and ultrafast pump&#8208;probe spectroscopy (visible and infrared) we unravel the correlation between the structure and light&#8208;matter response, with a particular emphasis on the influence of the polarity of the surrounding environment. Our experimental results and simulations confirm that in polar and good hydrogen&#8208;bond acceptor solvents (DMSO), the formation of dimers for ODIN derivatives is strongly inhibited. The presence of a phenyl group linked to the ureidic unit favors the folding of ODIN derivatives (forming an intramolecular hydrogen bond) leading to the stabilization of a charge&#8208;transfer excited state which almost completely quenches its fluorescence emission. In solvents with a poor aptitude for forming hydrogen bonds, the formation of dimers is favored and gives rise to H aggregates, with a consequent considerable reduction in the fluorescence emission.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The current work focuses on the investigation of two functionalized naphthyridine derivatives, namely ODIN-EtPh and ODIN-But, to gain insights into the hydrogen bond-assisted H-aggregate formation and its impact on the optical properties of ODIN molecules. By employing a combination of X-ray and electron crystallography, absorption and emission spectroscopy, time resolved fluorescence and ultrafast pump-probe spectroscopy (visible and infrared) we unravel the correlation between the structure and light-matter response, with a particular emphasis on the influence of the polarity of the surrounding environment. Our experimental results and simulations confirm that in polar and good hydrogen-bond acceptor solvents (DMSO), the formation of dimers for ODIN derivatives is strongly inhibited. The presence of a phenyl group linked to the ureidic unit favors the folding of ODIN derivatives (forming an intramolecular hydrogen bond) leading to the stabilization of a charge-transfer excited state which almost completely quenches its fluorescence emission. In solvents with a poor aptitude for forming hydrogen bonds, the formation of dimers is favored and gives rise to H aggregates, with a consequent considerable reduction in the fluorescence emission. The urea-bound phenyl group furtherly stabilizes the dimers in chloroform.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Owing to the S&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O/F&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H or F&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H/O&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H noncovalently configurational locks, both IDT&#8208;BOF and IDT&#8208;BFO have a completely planar structure. IDT&#8208;BOF exhibits a similar LUMO to IDT&#8208;BFO, but higher HOMO energy levels, leading to a smaller optical bandgap and red&#8208;shifted absorption. However, IDT&#8208;BOF&#8208;based bulk&#8208;heterojunction organic solar cells (BHJ&#8208;OSCs) coupled with PBDB&#8208;T, and PCE&#8208;10 as donor materials both exhibited a lower PCE than that of IDT&#8208;BFO (PBDB&#8208;T: 5.2 vs. 6.1&#8201;%; PCE&#8208;10: 1.7 vs. 3.2&#8201;%). Comprehensively comparing and investigating IDT&#8208;BOF&#8201;:&#8201;PBDB&#8208;T and IDT&#8208;BFO&#8201;:&#8201;PBDB&#8208;T OSCs suggested that the large phase separation and serious charge recombination of IDT&#8208;BOF&#8208;based OSCs contributed to its lower power conversion efficiency. Importantly, ternary solar cells based on PBDB&#8208;T&#8201;:&#8201;Y5 as control devices with an additional 10&#8201;% IDT&#8208;BFO exhibited a 5&#8201;% enhancement in the PCE compared to the control device (14.3 vs. 13.46&#8201;%).

         <title>Prediction of Strong Solvatochromism in a Molecular Photocatalyst

Solvatochromism denotes the dependence of the colour of a solution on the solvent. Based on quantum chemical calculations, we predict strong solvatochromism in a light&#8208;driven molecular photocatalyst for hydrogen evolution. Moreover, we find a solvent&#8208;dependent relocation of the highest occupied molecular orbital opening the way to deliberately modify the properties of photoactive complexes.







Abstract
Based on quantum chemical calculations, we predict strong solvatochromism in a light&#8208;driven molecular photocatalyst for hydrogen generation, that is we show that the electronic and optical properties of the photocatalyst strongly depend on the solvent it is dissolved in. Our calculations in particular indicate a solvent&#8208;dependent relocation of the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO). Ground&#8208;state density functional theory and linear response time&#8208;dependent density functional theory calculations were applied in order to investigate the influence of implicit solvents on the structural, electronic and optical properties of a molecular photocatalyst. Only at high dielectric constants of the solvent, is the HOMO located at the metal center of the photosensitizer, whereas at low dielectric constants the HOMO is centered at the metal atom of the catalytically active complex. We elucidate the electronic origins of this strong solvatochromic effect and sketch the consequences of these insights for the use of photocatalysts in different environments.

Polyfluoroalkyl chain&#8208;based TACN derivatives were developed to lower their CAC in the presence of equimolar amount of Zn2+ ions to drive the self&#8208;assembly and afford high catalytic activity towards the hydrolysis reaction of HPNP, demonstrating the robustness of F&#8208;chain assemblies, compared with their perhydroalkyl chain counterparts.







Abstract
Amphiphobic fluoroalkyl chains are exploited for creating robust and diverse self&#8208;assembled biomimetic catalysts. Long terminal perfluoroalkyl chains (CnF2n+1 with n=6, 8, and 10) linked with a short perhydroalkyl chains (CmH2m with m=2 and 3) were used to synthesize several 1,4,7&#8208;triazacyclononane (TACN) derivatives, CnF2n+1&#8208;CmH2m&#8208;TACN. In the presence of an equimolar amount of Zn2+ ions that coordinate the TACN moiety and drive the self&#8208;assembly into micelle&#8208;like aggregates, the critical aggregation concentration of polyfluorinated CnF2n+1&#8208;CmH2m&#8208;TACN&#8901;Zn2+ was lowered by &#8764;1 order of magnitude compared to the traditional perhyroalkyl counterpart with identical carbon number of alkyl chain. When 2&#8217;&#8208;hydroxypropyl&#8208;4&#8208;nitrophenyl phosphate was used as the model phosphate substrate, polyfluorinated CnF2n+1&#8208;CmH2m&#8208;TACN&#8901;Zn2+ assemblies showed higher affinity and catalytic activity, compared to its perhyroalkyl chain&#8208;based counterpart. Coarse&#8208;grained molecular dynamic simulations have been introduced to explore the supramolecular assembly of polyfluoroalkyl chains in the presence of Zn2+ ions and to better understand their enhanced catalytic activity.

A ring&#8208;expanded NHC, 6&#8208;Dipp ((6&#8208;Dipp=C{NDippCH2}2CH2, Dipp=2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3)), has been shown to support two acyclic boryls. Reaction of (6&#8208;Dipp)CuOtBu with B2(OMe)4 provided access to (6&#8208;Dipp)CuB(OMe)2, the first acyclic boryl of copper, which was shown to react similarly to its cyclic cousins. Remarkably, however, it could also be subjected to salt metathesis to access (6&#8208;Dipp)CuB(OMe)NMe2, the second acyclic boryl of copper.







Abstract
Reaction of (6&#8208;Dipp)CuOtBu (6&#8208;Dipp=C{NDippCH2}2CH2, Dipp=2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3) with B2(OMe)4 provided access to (6&#8208;Dipp)CuB(OMe)2 via &#963;&#8208;bond metathesis. (6&#8208;Dipp)CuB(OMe)2 was characterised by NMR spectroscopy and X&#8208;ray crystallography and shown to be a monomeric acyclic boryl of copper. (6&#8208;Dipp)CuB(OMe)2 reacted with ethylene and diphenylacetylene to provide insertion compounds into the Cu&#8208;B bond which were characterised by NMR spectroscopy in both cases and X&#8208;ray crystallography in the latter. It was also competent in the rapid catalytic deoxygenation of CO2 in the presence of excess B2(OMe)4. Alongside &#960;&#8208;insertion, (6&#8208;Dipp)CuB(OMe)2 reacted with LiNMe2 to provide a salt metathesis reaction at boron, giving (6&#8208;Dipp)CuB(OMe)NMe2, a second monomeric acyclic boryl, which also cuproborated diphenylacetylene. Computational interrogation validated these acyclic boryl species to be electronically similar to (6&#8208;Dipp)CuBpin.

Two isostructural semiconducting metal phosphonate frameworks, Co2[1,4&#8208;NDPA] and Zn2[1,4&#8208;NDPA] (1,4&#8208;NDPA4&#8722; is 1,4&#8208;naphthalenediphosphonate), are reported which have optical bandgaps within the semiconducting regime (1.7&#8197;eV and 2.5&#8197;eV, respectively),. The electrocatalyst derived from Co2[1,4&#8208;NPDA] as a precatalyst holds potential in the oxygen evolution reaction (OER).







Abstract
Two new isostructural semiconducting metal&#8208;phosphonate frameworks are reported. Co2[1,4&#8208;NDPA] and Zn2[1,4&#8208;NDPA] (1,4&#8208;NDPA4&#8722; is 1,4&#8208;naphthalenediphosphonate) have optical bandgaps of 1.7&#8197;eV and 2.5&#8197;eV, respectively. The electrocatalyst derived from Co2[1,4&#8208;NPDA] as a precatalyst generated a low overpotential of 374&#8197;mV in the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) with a Tafel slope of 43&#8197;mV&#8201;dec&#8722;1 at a current density of 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in alkaline electrolyte (1&#8197;mol&#8201;L&#8722;1 KOH), which is indicative of remarkably superior reaction kinetics. Benchmarking of the OER of Co2[1,4&#8208;NPDA] material as a precatalyst coupled with nickel foam (NF) showed exceptional long&#8208;term stability at a current density of 50&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 for water splitting compared to the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art Pt/C/RuO2@NF after 30&#8197;h in 1&#8197;mol&#8201;L&#8722;1 KOH. In order to further understand the OER mechanism, the transformation of Co2[1,4&#8208;NPDA] into its electrocatalytically active species was investigated.

         <title>Support Engineering for the Stabilisation of Heterogeneous Pd3P&#8208;Based Catalysts for Heck Coupling Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 1, January 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The concept of support engineering using phosphorus&#8208;modified silica is used to modulate catalyst&#8208;support interactions and to stabilize catalytically active species on the support. Following this approach, an enhanced catalytic performance and catalyst stability as well as a reduction of metal leaching can be achieved for Pd3P.







Abstract
Herein we report the use of a supported Pd3P catalyst for Heck coupling reactions. For the stabilisation of Pd3P and Pd, as reference system, the silica support material was modified via phosphorus doping (0.5 and 1&#8197;wt&#8201;% P). Through this so&#8208;called support engineering approach, the catalytic activity of Pd3P was clearly enhanced. Whereas an iodobenzene conversion of 79&#8201;% was witnessed for Pd3P@SiO2 in the coupling of styrene and iodobenzene in 1&#8197;h, 90&#8201;% conversion could be achieved using Pd3P@1P&#8208;SiO2. This improved catalytic activity probably stems from an electronic modulation of the support surface via the introduction of phosphorus. Simultaneously, the recyclability was boosted and the Pd3P@1P&#8208;SiO2 catalyst has shown to maintain its catalytic activity over several recovery tests. Hereby, metal leaching could almost be suppressed completely to 3&#8201;% by the use of a P&#8208;modified silica support.

         <title>Chasing Turns and Twists: Unraveling the One&#8208;Step Synthesis, Intricate Pathways, and Structural Revelations of N&#8208;Aryl Aza&#8208;quasi[8]circulenes</title>

COT is caught! This report presents an efficient one&#8208;step, metal&#8208;free synthesis of aza&#8208;quasi[8]circulenes from bis(biaryl)carbazoles. The regioselective &#8242;fold&#8208;in&#8242; synthesis unravels the intricate pathways involved and overcomes the helical strain in the intermediate aza[7]helicene formed. The resulting aza&#8208;quasi[8]circulenes feature a non&#8208;planar central cyclooctatetraene (COT) and exhibit intriguing optical, chiroptical, and redox properties, making them promising candidates for future applications in organic electronics.







Abstract
An efficient one&#8208;step synthesis of N&#8208;Aryl aza&#8208;quasi[8]circulenes is reported starting from bis(biaryl)carbazoles. The intermediacy of N&#8208;aryl aza[7]helicene is investigated, and the Scholl oxidative cyclization route is invoked here to overcome the large strain during the formation of N&#8208;aryl aza&#8208;quasi[8]circulenes from N&#8208;aryl aza[7]helicene. Notably, this transformation occurs without the need for directing groups and proceeds from a more helical to a less helical pathway. Both the N&#8208;aryl aza[7]helicene and N&#8208;aryl aza&#8208;quasi[8]circulene are confirmed by single crystal X&#8208;ray structural analysis. The enantiomers of N&#8208;aryl aza[7]helicene are separated by chiral HPLC and analyzed by circular dichroism spectroscopy to investigate their chiroptical properties. However, N&#8208;aryl aza&#8208;quasi[8]circulene racemizes rapidly. The radical cations generated from aza&#8208;quasi[8]circulene through chemical oxidation exhibit broad absorption in the near&#8208;IR region and air stability up to 24&#8197;h. Optical and electrochemical studies with aza[7]helicene and aza&#8208;quasi[8]circulene derivatives highlight their potential in organic electronic devices.

         <title>Mechanochemical Scholl Reaction on Phenylated Cyclopentadiene Core: One&#8208;Step Synthesis of Fluoreno[5]helicenes</title>

Fluoreno[5]helicenes are prepared in the solid state in one synthetic step from commercially available phenylated cyclopentadiene precursors in high isolated yields using a ball milling mechanochemical technique.







Abstract
In this study, we explore feasibility of the mechanochemical approach in the synthesis of tetrabenzofluorenes (fluoreno[5]helicenes). For this, commercially available phenylated cyclopentadiene precursors are subjected to the Scholl reaction in the solid state using FeCl3 as an oxidant and sodium chloride as the solid reaction medium. This ball milling process gave access to the 5&#8208;membered ring containing&#8208;helicenes in one synthetic step in high (95&#8211;96&#8201;%) isolated yields. The solution&#8208;phase reactions, however, were found to be moderate to low yielding in this regard (10&#8211;40&#8201;%).

         <title>Pinacol Cross&#8208;Coupling Promoted by an Aluminyl Anion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 1, January 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The potassium aluminyl K[Al(NON)] (NON=[O(SiMe2NDipp)2]2&#8722;) is a suitable platform for the pinacol coupling of aldehydes and ketones. Isolating an intermediate allows unsymmetrical examples to be accessed via a sequential addition strategy. A rare example of a p&#8208;block ketyl complex was isolated, and DFT was used to confirm a carbon&#8208;based radical. Product release was achieved using an iodosilane, demonstrating the steps required to generate a closed synthetic cycle.







Abstract
A simple sequential addition protocol for the reductive coupling of ketones and aldehydes by a potassium aluminyl grants access to unsymmetrical pinacolate derivatives. Isolation of an aluminium ketyl complex presents evidence for the accessibility of radical species. Product release from the aluminium centre was achieved using an iodosilane, forming the disilylated 1,2&#8208;diol and a neutral aluminium iodide, thereby demonstrating the steps required to generate a closed synthetic cycle for pinacol (cross) coupling at an aluminyl anion.

         <title>Synthesis of Bridged Tetrazoles with Promising Properties and Potential Applications by a One&#8208;Step Finkelstein Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 1, January 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Several new nitramine&#8208; and oxa&#8208;bridged bis&#8208;tetrazolyl energetic materials were synthesized and fully characterized. The thermal behavior of all compounds was studied and their sensitivities towards impact (IS) and friction (FS) determined. Energetic properties, were calculated using the EXPLO5 (V6.06.01) computer code. In particular, 1,3&#8208;bis&#8208;2,2&#8217;&#8208;nitrotetrazolylnitrazapropane and 1,7&#8208;bis&#8208;2,2&#8217;&#8208;tetrazolyltrinitrazaheptane show promising properties for use as RDX replacements.







Abstract
Numerous nitramine bridged compounds which show promising combinations of properties have already been identified in the area of energetic materials. In this work, four new nitrazapropane bridged tetrazoles, as well as four new trinitrazaheptane tetrazoles and three oxapropane bridged tetrazoles were synthesized and fully characterized. These new compounds can all be synthesized by a simple, one&#8208;step synthesis using Finkelstein conditions. All of these new energetic materials were characterized using NMR spectroscopy, single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, vibrational analysis and elemental analysis. The thermal behaviour of these compounds was studied by differential thermal analysis (DTA) and partly by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). The BAM standard method was used to determine the sensitivities towards impact (IS) and friction (FS). The enthalpies of formation were calculated at the CBS&#8208;4M level, and the energetic performances were calculated using the EXPLO5 (V6.06.01) computer code. The properties of the new compounds were compared to each other as well as to the known energetic material RDX. Moreover, the iron(II) and copper(II) perchlorate complexes with 1,3&#8208;bis&#8208;1,1&#8208;tetrazolylnitrazapropane as ligand were prepared and investigated.

         <title>Single Atom Stabilization of Phosphinate Ester&#8208;Containing Rhodamines Yields Cell Permeable Probes for Turn&#8208;On Photoacoustic Imaging
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 1, January 2, 2024. </description>

We describe an approach to stabilize NIR absorbing rhodamine dyes containing phosphinate esters, affording cell permeable photoacoustic probes with maximal absorbance in the range of commercial instrumentation. A derivative of our optimal dye can used for turn&#8208;on detection of a disease relevant analyte in living cells and mice.







Abstract
Photoacoustic imaging (PAI) is an emerging imaging technique that uses pulsed laser excitation with near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light to elicit local temperature increases through non&#8208;radiative relaxation events, ultimately leading to the production of ultrasound waves. The classical xanthene dye scaffold has found numerous applications in fluorescence imaging, however, xanthenes are rarely utilized for PAI since they do not typically display NIR absorbance. Herein, we report the ability of Nebraska Red (NR) xanthene dyes to produce photoacoustic (PA) signal and provide a rational design approach to reduce the hydrolysis rate of ester containing dyes, affording cell permeable probes. To demonstrate the utility of this approach, we construct the first cell permeable rhodamine&#8208;based, turn&#8208;on PAI imaging probe for hypochlorous acid (HOCl) with maximal absorbance within the range of commercial PA instrumentation. This probe, termed SNR700&#8208;HOCl, is capable of detecting exogenous HOCl in mice. This work provides a new set of rhodamine&#8208;based PAI agents as well as a rational design approach to stabilize esterified versions of NR dyes with desirable properties for PAI. In the long term, the reagents described herein could be utilized to enable non&#8208;invasive imaging of HOCl in disease&#8208;relevant model systems.

         <title>Mechanochemical Oxidative Coupling of Amine to Azo&#8208;based Polymers by Hypervalent Iodine Oxidant</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 1, January 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthetic strategy of azo&#8208;based polymers is tedious and limited to liquid&#8208;phase synthesis. In most cases, the explosion is inevitable when hypervalent iodine in direct contacts with primary amines, which further restricts the solid&#8208;state synthesis. Inspired by the principle of &#8220;rule of six&#8221;, it is feasible to construct azo&#8208;based polymers by hypervalent iodine oxidant in ball milling process.







Abstract
Among porous organic polymers (POPs), azo&#8208;linked POPs represent a crucial class of materials, making them the focus of numerous catalytic systems proposed for their synthesis. However, the synthetic process is limited to metal&#8208;catalyzed, high&#8208;temperature, and liquid&#8208;phase reactions. In this study, we employ mechanochemical oxidative metal&#8208;free systems to encompass various syntheses of azo&#8208;based polymers. Drawing inspiration from the &#8220;rule of six&#8221; principle (six or more carbons on an azide group render the organic compound relatively safe), an azo compound featuring significant steric hindrance is obtained using the hypervalent iodine oxidation strategy. Furthermore, during the polymerization process, steric hindrance is enhanced in monomers to effectively prevent explosions resulting from direct contact between hypervalent iodine oxidants and primary amines. Indeed, this approach provides a facile and innovative solid&#8208;phase synthesis method for synthesizing azo&#8208;based materials.

Inspired by the principle of &#8220;rule of six&#8221;, it is feasible to construct azo-based polymers by hypervalent iodine oxidant in ball milling process.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among porous organic polymers (POPs), azo-linked POPs represent a crucial class of materials, making them the focus of numerous catalytic systems proposed for their synthesis. However, the synthetic process is limited to metal-catalyzed, high-temperature, and liquid-phase reactions. In this study, we employ mechanochemical oxidative metal-free systems to encompass various syntheses of azo-based polymers. Drawing inspiration from the &#8220;rule of six&#8221; principle (six or more carbons on an azide group render the organic compound relatively safe), an azo compound featuring significant steric hindrance is obtained using the hypervalent iodine oxidation strategy. Furthermore, during the polymerization process, steric hindrance is enhanced in monomers to effectively prevent explosions resulting from direct contact between hypervalent iodine oxidants and primary amines. Indeed, this approach provides a facile and innovative solid-phase synthesis method for synthesizing azo-based materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Easy to Use DFT Approach for Computational pKa Determination of Carboxylic Acids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 1, January 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein we propose an easy and low computational approach in computing pKa calculation with remarkable results. Our method is characterized by great accuracy and feasibility in a wide panel of substrate. Results exploited no external factor nor mathematical fitting correction, leading to a MAE values lower than 0.5. Difficult to model compounds, such as ones bearing &#8722;CN and NO2 as well as trichloro and trifluoro acetic acids were foreseen with DFT functionals without exploiting high level of theory.







Abstract
In pKa computational determination, the challenge in exploring and fostering new methodologies and approaches goes in parallel with the amelioration of computational performances. In this paper a &#8220;ready to use methodology&#8221; has been compared to other strategies, such as the re&#8208;shaping in solvation cavity (Bondi radius re&#8208;shaping), wanting to assess its reliability in predicting the pKa of a broad list of carboxylic acids. Thus, the functionals B3LYP and CAM&#8208;B3LYP have been selected, using SMD as continuum solvation model. Exploiting our previous results, two water molecules were made explicit on the reaction centre. Data show that our model (CAM&#8208;B3LYP/2H2O) is capable to accurately predict pKa, leading to mean absolute error (MAE) values lower than 0.5. Noteworthy, good results were achieved in computing the pKa of substituents bearing nitro and cyano groups. Focusing on B3LYP, eventually remarkable outputs were obtained only when Bondi correction was applied to the complex with two water molecules. Hence, massive outcomes were obtained in foreseeing the trichloro and trifluoro acetic acid pKa. These findings demonstrated that no complex level of theory nor external factor is required to accurately predict carboxylic acids pKa, with MAE well below 0.5&#8197;units.

         <title>Unveiling the Potential of Heterogeneous Catalysts for Molecular Solar Thermal Systems</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 1, January 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Developing compounds that store and release solar energy is crucial for overcoming its intermittent nature. In Molecular Solar Thermal (MOST) systems, a high&#8208;energy photoisomer captures and releases energy. While photoisomerization is well&#8208;studied, back&#8208;conversion using catalysts is underexplored. We compare 27 catalysts in a Norbornadiene/Quadricyclane MOST system, offering insights for effective catalyst development and testing, highlighting the efficiency of Pt based heterogenous catalyst.







Abstract
Solar energy utilization has gained considerable attention due to its abundance and renewability. However, its intermittent nature presents a challenge in harnessing its full potential. The development of energy storing compounds capable of capturing and releasing solar energy on demand has emerged as a potential solution. These compounds undergo a photochemical transformation that results in a high&#8208;energy metastable photoisomer, which stores solar energy in the form of chemical bonds and can release it as heat when required. Such systems are referred to as MOlecular Solar Thermal (MOST)&#8208;systems. Although the photoisomerization of MOST systems has been vastly studied, its back&#8208;conversion, particularly using heterogeneous catalysts, is still underexplored and the development of effective catalysts for releasing stored energy is crucial. Herein we compare the performance of 27 heterogeneous catalysts releasing the stored energy in an efficient Norbornadiene/Quadricyclane (NBD/QC) MOST system. We report the first benchmarking of heterogeneous catalysts for a MOST system using a robust comparison method of the catalysts&#8217; activity and monitoring the conversion using UV&#8208;Visible (UV&#8208;Vis) spectroscopy. Our findings provide insights into the development of effective catalysts for MOST systems. We anticipate that our assay will reveal the necessity of further investigation on heterogeneous catalysis.

         <title>Modifying the Catalytic Activity of Lipopeptide Assemblies with Nucleobases</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 1, January 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biomolecular conjugates consisting of a catalytic tripeptide, a fatty acid and nucleobase moieties form defined fibrillar assemblies in aqueous media and catalyze the reaction of butanal with nitrostyrene. The interaction between complementary nucleobases enhanced the order in the supramolecular assemblies and influenced the catalytic properties of the peptide&#8208;nucleolipids, indicating that nucleobases can be valuable for control over the self&#8208;assembly and catalytic properties of biologically inspired supramolecular catalysts.







Abstract
Biohybrid catalysts that operate in aqueous media are intriguing for systems chemistry. In this paper, we investigate whether control over the self&#8208;assembly of biohybrid catalysts can tune their properties. As a model, we use the catalytic activity of functional hybrid molecules consisting of a catalytic H&#8208;dPro&#8208;Pro&#8208;Glu tripeptide, derivatized with fatty acid and nucleobase moieties. This combination of simple biological components merged the catalytic properties of the peptide with the self&#8208;assembly of the lipid, and the structural ordering of the nucleobases. The biomolecule hybrids self&#8208;assemble in aqueous media into fibrillar assemblies and catalyze the reaction between butanal and nitrostyrene. The interactions between the nucleobases enhanced the order of the supramolecular structures and affected their catalytic activity and stereoselectivity. The results point to the significant control and ordering that nucleobases can provide in the self&#8208;assembly of biologically inspired supramolecular catalysts.

         <title>Effects of Fluorinated Functionalization of Linker on Quercetin Encapsulation, Release and Hela Cell Cytotoxicity of Cu&#8208;Based MOFs as Smart pH&#8208;Stimuli Nanocarriers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 1, January 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two copper&#8208;based MOFs, Cu2(BDC)2DABCO and Cu2(F4BDC)2DABCO, as smart carriers of Quercetin (QU), with high loading potential and sustained release of Quercetin, were synthesized and investigated for their potential as pH stimulus nanocarriers of QU as an anticancer agent. Their interactions with QU were investigated through Grand Canonical Monte Carlo simulation calculations. Cytotoxicity was evaluated by MTT assays against HEK&#8208;293 and HeLa cell lines. Also, kinetic models of release were evaluated.







Abstract
Controlled delivery of target molecules is required in many medical and chemical applications. For such purposes, metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs), which possess desirable features such as high porosity, large surface area, and adjustable functionalities, hold great potential as drug carriers. Herein, Quercetin (QU), as an anticancer drug, was loaded on Cu2(BDC)2(DABCO) and Cu2(F4BDC)2)DABCO) MOFs (BDC=1,4&#8208;benzenedicarboxylate and DABCO=1,4&#8208;diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane). As these Cu&#8208;MOFs have a high surface area, an appropriate pore size, and biocompatible ingredients, they can be utilized to deliver QU. The loading efficiency of QU in these MOFs was 49.5&#8201;% and 41.3&#8201;%, respectively. The drug&#8208;loaded compounds displayed sustained drug release over 15&#8197;days, remarkably high drug loading capacities and pH&#8208;controlled release behavior. The prepared nanostructures were characterized by different characterization technics including FT&#8208;IR, PXRD, ZP, TEM, FE&#8208;SEM, UV&#8208;vis, and BET. In addition, MTT assays were carried out on the HEK&#8208;293 and HeLa cell lines to investigate cytotoxicity. Cellular apoptosis analysis was performed to investigate the cell death mechanisms. Grand Canonical Monte Carlo simulations were conducted to analyze the interactions between MOFs and QU. Moreover, the stability of MOFs was also investigated during and after the drug release process. Ultimately, kinetic models of drug release were evaluated.

         <title>Thermochromic Hydrogels with Opaque&#8208;Transparent Gradient Transition for Switchable Window and Temperature Monitor</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 1, January 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydrogels with gradient opaque&#8208;transparent transition thermochromic temperature from 5&#8201;&#176;C to 53&#8201;&#176;C were prepared and the accuracy was controlled at 1&#8201;&#176;C. The thermochromic property was regulated by the aggregation state of sodium dodecyl sulfate micelles by adding potassium tartrate hemihydrate and cations. The thermochromic hydrogel can serve for smart window and temperature detector/monitor.







Abstract
In recent years, the thermochromic hydrogel was acted as suitable sandwiching material to adjust light transmission. However, to accurately control the thermochromic temperature in a wide range still was a significant challenge. Here, a simple method was explored to prepare hydrogels with gradient opaque&#8208;transparent transition thermochromic temperature from 5&#8201;&#176;C to 53&#8201;&#176;C, which was regulated by the aggregation state of sodium dodecyl sulfate micelles by adding potassium tartrate hemihydrate and cations. Using Li+, Na+, and K+ as cations, the accuracy was controlled at 1&#8201;&#176;C. Moreover, the transmittance of the hydrogel was not changed when the thermochromic temperature was adjusted. As a result, an intelligent window was fabricated by utilizing thermochromic hydrogel as a sandwiching layer into the outer glass layers, which could effectively and stably regulate the visible and infrared light. The temperature monitors/detectors were also designed, which showed excellent temperature monitoring/detecting ability. Therefore, this low&#8208;cost, high&#8208;efficient, large&#8208;scale prepared thermochromic hydrogel provided more potential for intelligent temperature devices.

         <title>Acceptorless or Transfer Dehydrogenation of Glycerol Catalyzed by Base Metal Salt Cobaltous Chloride &#8211; Facile Access to Lactic Acid and Hydrogen or Isopropanol</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 1, January 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Readily available, inexpensive, environmentally benign and earth&#8208;abundant base metal salt cobaltous chloride has been employed to catalyze the reforming of glycerol to lactic acid in high yield and excellent selectivity either in an acceptorless fashion or under transfer dehydrogenation conditions at 160&#8201;&#176;C.







Abstract
The dehydrogenation of glycerol to lactic acid (LA) under both acceptorless and transfer dehydrogenation conditions using readily available, inexpensive, environmentally benign and earth&#8208;abundant base metal salt CoCl2 is reported here. The CoCl2 (0.5&#8197;mol&#8201;%) catalyzed acceptorless dehydrogenation of glycerol at 160&#8201;&#176;C in the presence of 0.75&#8197;equiv. of KOH, gave up to 33&#8201;% yield of LA in 44&#8201;% selectivity apart from hydrogen. Alternatively, with acetone as a sacrificial hydrogen acceptor, the CoCl2 (0.5&#8197;mol&#8201;%) catalyzed dehydrogenation of glycerol at 160&#8201;&#176;C in the presence of 1.1&#8197;equiv. of NaOtBu resulted in up to 93&#8201;% LA with 96&#8201;% selectivity along with another value&#8208;added product isopropanol. Labelling studies revealed a modest secondary KIE of 1.68 which points to the involvement of C&#8722;H bond activation as a part of the catalytic cycle but not as a part of the rate&#8208;determining step. Catalyst poisoning experiments with PPh3 and CS2 are indicative of the homogeneous nature of the reaction mixture involving molecular species that are likely to be in&#8208;situ formed octahedral Co(II) as inferred from EPR, HRMS and Evans magnetic moment studies. The net transfer dehydrogenation activity is attributed to exclusive contribution from the alcoholysis step.

Color&#8208;changing dyes in zeolites: In free solution, deprotonated resorufin emits a bright fuchsia&#8208;colored light. As it proceeds through the pore openings of zeolite&#8208;&#946;, it picks up a proton. Confinement by the micropores allows this species to fluoresce with a bright orange light. This feature was used to investigate accessibility and diffusion (barriers) in zeolites. More information can be found in the Research Article by B.&#8197;M.

         <dc:description>
Computational chemistry has an intrinsically green approach, as it gives us the possibility to predict molecular properties, such as the pKa, thereby avoiding time&#8208;consuming experiments. It combines the past of experimental chemistry with the future. In the cartoon, our DFT&#8208;based &#8220;easy&#8208;to&#8208;use&#8208;methodology&#8221; is shown. Note the accurate result in predicting the pKa values of trifluoro&#8208; and trichloroacetic acid, easily obtained by adding two water molecules at the reaction centre. More information can be found in the Research Article by F. Sabuzi and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202303167).

Trapping sunlight energy into chemical bonds has become an important method for storing renewable energy and releasing it on demand. To illustrate the new catalyst&#8208;testing protocol, a cyclic road shows the photoisomerization process trapping sunlight (top) and the back&#8208;conversion catalytic reaction releasing heat. The bottom wheel indicates that up to 27 different catalysts were studied. More information can be found in the Research Article by I. Funes&#8208;Ardoiz, D. Sampedro and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202303230).

         <title>The Field of Main Group Lewis Acids and Lewis Superacids: Important Basics and Recent Developments</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 1, January 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Essential basics of Donor&#8208;Acceptor (DA) interactions are presented to emphasize vital role of the Lewis acidity from weak intermolecular interactions to the strong DA complexes. Recent advances in synthesis and characterization of novel Lewis acids and Lewis superacids of group&#8197;2, 13, 14, and 15 elements are presented and discussed.







Abstract
New developments in the field of Lewis acidity are highlighted, with the focus of novel Lewis acids and Lewis superacids of group&#8197;2, 13, 14, and 15 elements. Several important basics, illustrated by modern examples (classification of Donor&#8208;Acceptor (DA) complexes, amphoteric nature of any compound in terms of DA interactions, reorganization energies of main group Lewis acids and the role of the energies of frontier orbitals) are presented and discussed. It is emphasized that the Lewis acidity phenomena are general and play vital role in different areas of chemistry: from weak &#8220;atomophilic&#8221; interactions to the complexes of Lewis superacids.

         <title>Bioinspired Functionalization of Carbonyl Compounds Enabled by Metal Chelated Bifunctional Ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 1, January 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The current Review gives an overview of the recently developed synthetic transformations enabled by Nature&#8208;inspired bifunctional ligands that not only bind to a metal catalyst but also activate the carbonyl substrates, for example aldehydes, ketones etc., via organocatalysis, thereby accelerating the rate and facilitating stereoselectivity of the new chemical bond forming step.







Abstract
In Nature, enzymatic reactions proceed through exceptionally ordered transition states giving rise to extraordinary levels of stereoselection. In those reactions, the active site of the enzyme plays crucial roles &#8211; through one position, it holds the substrate in the proximity to the reaction epicentre that facilitates both the reactivity and stereoselectivity of the chemical process. Inspired by this natural phenomenon, synthetic chemists have designed bifunctional ligands that not only coordinate to a metal centre but also preassociate with an organic substrate, for example aldehyde and ketone, and exerts stereodirecting influence to accelerate the attack of the incoming reacting partner from a particular enantiotopic face. The chief goal of the current review is to give an overview of the recently developed approaches enabled by privileged bio&#8208;inspired bifunctional ligands that not only bind to the metal catalyst but also activates carbonyl substrates via organocatalysis, thereby easing in the new bond forming step. As carbonyl &#945;&#8208;functionalizations are dominated by enamine and enolate chemistry, the current review primarily focusses on enamine&#8208; and enolate&#8208;metal catalysis by bifunctional ligands. Thus, developments based on traditional cooperative catalysis occurring through two directly coupled but independent catalytic cycles of an organocatalyst and a metal catalyst are not covered.

         <title>Synthesis of 3&#8208;Phenylserine by a Two&#8208;enzyme Cascade System with PLP Cofactor</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel cascade system was first proposed for the synthesis of 3&#8208;Phenylserine with transaminase and threonine aldolase. This cascade reaction system can not only facilitate the in&#8197;situ removal of the co&#8208;product benzaldehyde, enhancing the economic viability of the reaction, but also the PLP is utilized as the only cofactor in these reaction system.







Abstract
A two&#8208;enzyme cascade system containing &#969;&#8208;transaminase (&#969;&#8208;TA) and L&#8208;threonine aldolase (L&#8208;ThA) was reported for the synthesis of 3&#8208;Phenylserine starting from benzylamine, and PLP was utilized as the only cofactor in these both two enzymes reaction system. Based on the transamination results, benzylamine was optimized as an advantageous amino donor as confirmed by MD simulation results. This cascade reaction system could not only facilitate the in&#8197;situ removal of the co&#8208;product benzaldehyde, enhancing the economic viability of the reaction, but also establish a novel pathway for synthesizing high&#8208;value phenyl&#8208;serine derivatives. In our study, nearly 95&#8201;% of benzylamine was converted, yielding over 54&#8201;% of 3&#8208;Phenylserine under the optimized conditions cascade reaction.

         <title>&#8220;Bubble&#8208;Diode&#8221; Breathable Electrodes for Fast Gas Transport</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bubbles arising from wild gas evolution commonly exist in electrochemical systems. Herein, the concept of a &#8220;bubble&#8208;diode&#8221; breathable electrode to promote gaseous molecules to the external environment with high efficiency while avoiding bubble accumulation has been introduced from the original conception to the current state of maturation.







Abstract
Bubbles arising from wild gas evolution commonly exist in electrochemical systems, particularly in water electrolysis and rechargeable aqueous batteries (e.&#8201;g., Zn&#8208;air batteries). Substantial energy dissipation occurs due to the obstruction of active sites and ion&#8208;conducting pathways by evolving bubbles. Efforts are made to elucidate effective strategies for fast gas transport, most of which focus on minimizing bubble size and facilitating their timely detachment through complex techniques such as constructing super&#8208;hydrophilic nano&#8208;structure electrodes, flowing electrolytes, and ultrasonic oscillation.

&lt;p&gt;Bubbles arising from wild gas evolution commonly exist in electrochemical systems. Herein, the concept of a &#8220;bubble-diode&#8221; breathable electrode to promote gaseous molecules to the external environment with high efficiency while avoiding bubble accumulation has been introduced from the original conception to the current state of maturation.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bubbles arising from wild gas evolution commonly exist in electrochemical systems, particularly in water electrolysis and rechargeable aqueous batteries (e.&#8201;g., Zn-air batteries). Substantial energy dissipation occurs due to the obstruction of active sites and ion-conducting pathways by evolving bubbles. Efforts are made to elucidate effective strategies for fast gas transport, most of which focus on minimizing bubble size and facilitating their timely detachment through complex techniques such as constructing super-hydrophilic nano-structure electrodes, flowing electrolytes, and ultrasonic oscillation. Recently, an innovative, facile, and highly efficient method utilizing a breathable electrode design to promote gaseous molecules to the external environment emerges as a promising approach since it avoids remarkable bubble accumulation while remaining free of additional accessories. This paper highlights the origin and evolution of this promising design. Starting with introducing the basic concept of traditional breathable electrodes based on hydrophobic polymer networks and discussing the current progress made in underlying mechanisms, a detailed description of the advanced design inspired by a &#8220;bubble-diode&#8221; concept with superior breathability follows. This Concept aims to contribute to a deep understanding of this technology and paves the way for further advancements in this renewable energy era.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Substrate Selectivity Imparted by Self&#8208;Assembled Molecular Containers and Catalysts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Substrate selectivity is the property of catalysts like enzymes to pick up one substrate among many others in solution. To implement substrate selectivity in artificial homogeneous catalysts, an emerging approach in homogeneous catalysis consists in exploiting self&#8208;assembled nano&#8208;catalysts and nanocontainers. The confinement effects provide supramolecular substrate recognition before the catalytic step. This review covers recent achievements in this challenging field of research.







Abstract
Recent trends in catalysis are devoted to mimicking some peculiar features of enzymes like site selectivity, through functional group recognition, and substrate selectivity, through recognition of the entire surface of the substrate. The latter is a specific feature of enzymes that is seldomly present in homogeneous catalysis. Supramolecular catalysis, thanks to the self&#8208;assembly of simple subunits, enables the creation of cavities and surfaces whose confinement effects drive the preferential binding of a substrate among others with consequent substrate selectivity. The topic is an emerging field that exploits recognition phenomena to discriminate the reagents based on their size and shape. This review deals this cutting&#8208;edge field of research covering examples of supramolecular self&#8208;assembled molecular containers and catalysts operating in organic as well as aqueous media, with special emphasis for catalytic systems dealing with direct competitive experiments involving two or more substrates.

         <title>Hierarchical Porous Aerogels With Multiple Adsorptive Interactions for Dye Wastewater Purification</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A composite aerogel composed of carboxymethyl chitosan, gelatin and tannic acid&#8208;reduced graphene oxide was successfully fabricated by the freeze&#8208;drying method, which could achieve the adsorption of multiple types of dye (such as methylene blue and methyl orange) due to the generation of hydrogen bonds, electrostatic interactions and &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacks with dyes.







Abstract
Aerogels present a huge potential for removing organic dyes from printing and dyeing wastewater (PDW). However, the preparation of aerogels with multiple dye adsorption capabilities remains a challenge, as many existing aerogels are limited to adsorbing only a single type of dye. Herein, a composite aerogel (CG/T&#8208;rGO) with the addition of carboxymethyl chitosan, gelatin and tannic acid reduced graphene oxide (T&#8208;rGO) was synthesized by freeze&#8208;drying technology. The electrostatic interactions between dye molecular and GEL/CMCS (CG) networks, as well as the supramolecular interactions (H&#8208;bonds, electrostatic interactions and &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacks) between T&#8208;rGO, have endowed the aerogel with the ability to adsorb multiple types of dye, such as methylene blue (MB) and methyl orange (MO). Results exhibited that the prepared CG/T&#8208;rGO aerogel possessed strong mechanical strength and a porous 3D network structure with a porosity of 96.33&#8201;%. Using MB and MO as adsorbates, the adsorption capacity (88.2&#8197;mg/g and 66.6&#8197;mg/g, respectively) and the mechanism of the CG/T&#8208;rGO aerogel were investigated. The adsorption processes of aerogel for MB and MO were shown to follow the pseudo&#8208;second&#8208;order kinetic model and Langmuir isotherm model, indicating the chemical adsorption of a monolayer. The proposed aerogel in this work has promising prospects for dye removal from PDW.

         <title>Temperature&#8208;dependent Electrochemical Performance of Ta&#8208;substituted SrCoO3 perovskite for Supercapacitors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing new electrode materials with good temperature&#8208;dependent electrochemical performance has become a great issue for the deployment of hybrid supercapacitors with wide temperature tolerance.&#160;&#160;In this work, a series of Ta&#8208;substituted SrCo1&#8208;xTaxO3&#8208;&#948; (x = 0.05, 0.10, 0.15, 0.20) perovskites have been studied as positive electrodes for hybrid supercapacitors in&#160;terms of their structures, elemental valence states and electrochemical performances. Incorporating Ta into SrCoO3&#8208;&#948; perovskite not only stabilizes the crystallite structure but also notably improves electrochemical activities. The SrCo0.95Ta0.05O3&#8208;&#948;@CC delivers the highest specific capacity (Qsp) of 227.91 C g&#8208;1 at 1 A g&#8208;1, which is attributed to the highest oxygen vacancy content and the fastest oxygen diffusion kinetics. The hybrid supercapacitor SrCo0.95Ta0.05O3&#8208;&#948;@CC//AC@CC exhibits a high energy density of 22.82 Wh kg&#8208;1@775.09 W kg&#8208;1 and a stable long&#8208;term cycle life (5000 cycles) with 90.7% capacity retention. As temperature increases from 25 to 85 &#8451;, the capacitance properties are improved at elevated temperatures for both electrode and device due to the increased electrolyte conductivity. The outstanding electrochemical results present that SrCo1&#8208;xTaxO3&#8208;&#948; perovskite holds good prospects for hybrid supercapacitors with wide temperature tolerance.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Fluorine, the tiny robust atom, with its unique features has captured the attention of scientists in recent times, especially in drug discovery with its integration in small molecules, peptides, and proteins. However, studies to understand the &#8216;fluorine effects&#8217; (&#8216;fluorine magic&#8217;) on the conformation of molecules that follow &#8216;beyond the rule of 5&#8217; are in the infancy yet significant in molecular design and function. For the first time, using short hybrid peptide sequence as an appropriate model, we examined the substitution effect (size, stereoelectronic effect, and hydrogen bonding) using X&#8208;ray diffraction 2D&#8208;NMR, and CD studies. The comparative study on their folding patterns with hydrogen&#8208;substituted analogs can provide valuable insights into &#8216;flustrates&#8217; fluorinated substrates&#8217; design.</dc:description>

         <title>Polyoxometalate&#8208;dependent photocatalytic activity of radical&#8208;doped perylenediimide&#8208;based hybrid materials</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Four radical&#8208;doped PDI&#8208;based crystalline hybrid materials, Cl4&#8208;PDI&#183;SiW12O40 (1), Cl4&#8208;PDI&#183;SiMo12O40 (2), Cl4&#8208;PDI&#183;PW12O40 (3), and Cl4&#8208;PDI&#183;PMo12O40 (4), were attainedby slow diffusion of polyoxometalates (POMs) into acidified Cl4&#8208;PDI solutions. The obtained PDI&#8208;based crystalline hybrid materials not only exhibited prominent photochromism, but also possessed reactive organic radicals under ambient conditions. Furthermore, all hybrid materials could be easily photoreduced to their radical anions (Cl4&#8208;PDI&#8226;&#8210;), and then underwent a second photoexcitation to form energetic excited state radical anions (Cl4&#8208;PDI&#8226;&#8210;*). However, experiments and theoretical calculations demonstrated that the formed energetic Cl4&#8208;PDI&#8226;&#8210;* showed unusual POM&#8208;dependent photocatalytic efficiencies toward the oxidative coupling of amines and the iodoperfluoroalkylation of alkenes; higher photocatalytic efficiencies were found for hybrid materials 1 and 2 compared to 3 and 4. The photocatalytic efficiencies of these hybrid materials are mainly controlled by the energy differences between the SOMO&#8208;2 level of Cl4&#8208;PDI&#8226;&#8210;* and the LUMO level of the POMs.</dc:description>

         <title>Elevating Lithium&#8208;Sulfur Battery Durability through Samarium Oxide/Ketjen Black Modified Separator</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries have garnered significant attention as a promising next&#8208;generation battery technology due to their potential for high energy density. However, their practical application is hampered by slow reaction kinetics and the shuttle effect of lithium polysulfide intermediates. In this context, the authors introduce a pioneering solution in the form of a novel porous carbon nanostructure modified with samarium oxide, denoted as Sm2O3/KB. The material has a highly polar surface, allowing lithium polysulfide to be chemisorbed efficiently. The unsaturated sites provided by the oxygen vacancies of Sm2O3 promote Li2S nucleation, lowering the reaction energy barrier and accelerating Li2S dissolution. The porous structure of Ketjen Black provides a highly conductive channel for electron transport and effectively traps polysulfides. Meanwhile, the batteries with Sm2O3/KB/PP spacers exhibited remarkable electrochemical performances, including a low&#8208;capacity decay rate of only 0.046% for 1000 cycles at 2 C and an excellent multiplicative performance of 624 mAh g&#8208;1 at 3 C. This work opens up a new avenue for the potential use of rare earth&#8208;based materials in lithium&#8208; sulfur batteries.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Novel rhodium&#8208;catalyzed [3+3] annulations of diazoenals and &#945;&#8208;amino ketones has been disclosed here. The reactivity of diazoenals has been switched from carbenoid to vinylogous NH&#8208;insertion by altering acyclic to cyclic &#945;&#8208;aminoketones.&#160;In this direction, we report an efficient strategy to synthesize 1,2&#8208;dihydropyridines (DHPs) and fused 1,4&#8208;oxazines. Mechanistic investigation revealed that the formyl group is necessary for carbenoid [3+3] annulation and the cyclohexyl group is the dictating factor for vinylogous NH&#8208; insertion. The synthetic utility of 1,2&#8208;dihydropyridines was demonstrated by synthesizing piperidine, pyrido[1,2&#8208;a]indole, and 2&#8208;pyridone scaffolds..Further, structural diversification of fused 1,4&#8208;oxazines resulted in the short synthesis of hexahydroquinolin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;ones, hexahydro quinolines and tetrahydroquinolinones via ring opening rearrangement and a new oxidative deformylation, respectively.</dc:description>

The reactions of XeF6 and CrO2F2 in anhydrous HF and melts yield the dinuclear Cr(VI) oxyfluoro&#8208;dianion salts, [XeF5]2[Cr2O4F6], [XeF5]2[Cr2O4F6]&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;4HF, [XeF5]2[Cr2O4F6]&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2XeOF4, and the mononuclear Cr(VI) dianion salt, [XeF5][Xe2F11][CrO2F4]. The salts were structurally characterized by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and Raman spectroscopy. Gas&#8208;phase quantum&#8208;chemical calculations show that the intimately ion&#8208;paired cations and dianions interact through Xe&#8208;&#8201;&#8208;&#8201;&#8208;F &#963;&#8208;hole bonds.







Abstract
The fluorobasic character of the strong oxidative fluorinator, XeF6, and the oxidative resistance of the [XeF5]+ and [Xe2F11]+ cations have been exploited for the syntheses of several novel Cr(VI) dianion salts. The reactions of XeF6 and CrO2F2 in anhydrous HF and by direct fusion of the reactants in melts have yielded the first dinuclear Cr(VI) oxyfluoro&#8208;dianion salts, [XeF5]2[Cr2O4F6], [XeF5]2[Cr2O4F6]&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;4HF, [XeF5]2[Cr2O4F6]&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2XeOF4, and mononuclear Cr(VI) oxyfluoro&#8208;dianion salt, [XeF5][Xe2F11][CrO2F4]. The salts were structurally characterized by low&#8208;temperature (LT) single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (SCXRD) and LT Raman spectroscopy. The [CrO2F4]2&#8722; and [Cr2O4F6]2&#8722; dianions have distorted octahedral cis&#8208;dioxo Cr(VI) coordination spheres in which two F&#8208;atoms are trans to one another and two F&#8208;atoms are trans to O&#8208;atoms, where the [Cr2O4F6]2&#8722; dianion is the fluorine&#8208;bridged dimer of the [CrO2F3]&#8722; anion. Quantum&#8208;chemical calculations were used to obtain the energy&#8208;minimized, gas&#8208;phase geometries, and the calculated vibrational spectra of the gas&#8208;phase dianions and their ion&#8208;pairs, which were used to aid in the vibrational frequency assignments of the crystalline salts. NBO and MEPS analyses and SCXRD show these salts are comprised of intimate ion&#8208;pairs in which their cations and anions interact through primarily electrostatic Xe&#8208;&#8201;&#8208;&#8201;&#8208;F &#963;&#8208;hole bonds.

         <title>Separator Design Strategies to Advance Rechargeable Aqueous Zinc Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The quality of separators is thoroughly assessed by systematically analyzing and scrutinizing aspects such as cost, functionality, safety, and environmental sustainability in their preparation. This comprehensive evaluation serves as a guide for the objectives and future directions for separators research of zinc ion batteries.







Abstract
With the increasing demand for low&#8208;cost and high&#8208;safety portable batteries, aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs) have been regarded as a potential alternative to the lithium&#8208;ion batteries, bringing about extensive research dedicated in the exploration of high&#8208;performance and highly reversible ZIBs. Although separators are generally considered as non&#8208;active components in conventional research on ZIBs, advanced separators designs seem to offer effective solutions to the majority of issues within ZIBs system. These issues encompass concerns related to the zinc anode, cathode, and electrolyte. Initially, we delve into the origins and implications of various inherent problems within the ZIBs system. Subsequently, we present the latest research advancements in addressing these challenges through separators engineering. This includes a comprehensive, detailed exploration of various strategies, coupled with instances of advanced characterizations to provide a more profound insight into the mechanisms that influence the separators. Finally, we undertake a multi&#8208;criteria evaluation, based on application standards for diverse substrate separators, while proposing guiding principles for the optimal design of separators in zinc batteries. This review aims to furnish valuable guidance for the future development of advanced separators, thereby nurturing progress in the field of ZIBs.

         <title>Electrochemical Redox Conversion of Formate to CO via Coupling Fe&#8208;Co Layered Double Hydroxides and Au Catalysts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Formate has been considered an inactive molecule and thus cannot be further reduced under CO2 reduction conditions, which limits its widespread application as feedstock. Here we present an electrochemical redox conversion of formate to CO through the potential&#8208;dependent generation of carbon dioxide radical anions (CO2&#8226;&#8208;) on Fe&#8208;Co layered double hydroxides (Fe&#8208;Co LDHs) and the subsequent reduction of CO2&#8226;&#8208; to CO on Au catalysts. We present an electrodeposition protocol for the synthesis of Fe&#8208;Co LDHs with precise composition control and find that Fe1Co4 exhibits a promising potential window for CO2&#8208;&#8226; formation between 1.14 and 1.4 V and an optimized potential at 1.24 V at a neutral pH condition. We further determined the formation of CO2&#8226;&#8208; at 1.24 V via electron paramagnetic resonance and CO2 at &gt; 1.4 V through differential electrochemical mass spectrometry. This work provides a redox chemistry route for converting formate into CO through a coupled slit parallel&#8208;plate electrode system.</dc:description>

         <title>Solution and Solvent&#8208;Free Stopper Exchange Reactions for the Preparation of Pillar[5]arene&#8208;containing [2] and [3]Rotaxanes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Diamine reagents have been used to functionalize a [2]rotaxane building block bearing an activated pentafluorophenyl ester stopper. Upon a first acylation, an intermediate host&#8208;guest complex with a terminal amine function is obtained. Dissociation of the intermediate occurs in solution and acylation of the released axle generates a [2]rotaxane with an elongated axle subunit. In contrast, the corresponding [3]rotaxane can be obtained if the reaction conditions are appropriate to stabilize the inclusion complex of the mono&#8208;amine intermediate and the pillar[5]arene. This is the case when the stopper exchange is performed under mechanochemical solvent&#8208;free conditions. Alternatively, if the newly introduced terminal amide group is large enough to prevent the dissociation, the second acylation provides exclusively a [3]rotaxane. On the other hand, detailed conformational analysis has been also carried out by variable temperature NMR investigations. A complete understanding of the shuttling motions of the pillar[5]arene subunit along the axles of the rotaxanes reported therein has been achieved with the help of density functional theory calculations.</dc:description>

         <title>Investigation of the Chemisorption&#8208;Catalysis Behavior of Sulfur Species on the Electrocatalysts Designed by Co&#8208;regulation Strategy of Anions and Cations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Li&#8208;S batteries possess high energy density and have been one of the most promising energy storage systems. For sulfur cathodes, the electrochemical performance is still seriously hindered by the polysulfide shuttling and sluggish conversion kinetics. It has been demonstrated to be one effective strategy to address the above issues via designing electrocatalysts with robust affinity and catalytic capacity towards polysulfides. However, it is still a great challenge to rapidly and economically discover high&#8208;performance electrocatalysts. Herein, using density functional theory calculation, we studied the chemisorption&#8208;catalysis behavior of sulfur species on a series of electrocatalysts (MCo2X4, M = Co, Zn, Cu, Ni, Fe, and Mn, X = O, S, and Se) to assess the effect of the anions and cations co&#8208;regulation on their electronic structure, chemisorption behavior, and catalytic property. FeCo2Se4 and CuCo2Se4 combined appropriate chemisorption with superior electronic conductivity and sulfur reduction catalytic capacity have been predicted as novel electrocatalysts for high&#8208;performance Li&#8208;S batteries. This study gives theoretical guidance for repaid discovery of high&#8208;efficient electrocatalyst to boost the electrochemical performance of sulfur cathodes.</dc:description>

         <title>Direct Band Gap Semiconductors with Two&#8208; and Three&#8208;Dimensional Triel&#8208;Phosphide Frameworks (Triel = Al, Ga, In)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Recently, several ternary phosphidotrielates and &#8208;tetrelates have been investigated with respect to their very good ionic conductivity, while less focus was pointed towards their electronic structures. Here, we report on a novel series of compounds, in which several members possess direct band gaps. We investigated the known compounds Li3AlP2, Li3GaP2, Li3InP2, and Na3InP2 and describe the synthesis and the crystal structure of novel Na3In2P3. For all mentioned phosphidotrielates reflectance UV&#8208;Vis measurements reveal direct band gaps in the visible light region with decreasing band gaps in the series: Li3AlP2 (2.45 eV), Li3GaP2 (2.18&#160;eV), Li3InP2 (1.99 eV), Na3InP2 (1.37&#160;eV), and Na3In2P3 (1.27&#160;eV). All direct band gaps are confirmed by quantum chemical calculations. The unexpected property occurs despite different structure types. As a common feature all compounds contain EP4 tetrahedra, which share exclusively vertices for E = In and vertices as well as edges for E = Al and Ga. The structure of the novel Na3In2P3 is built up by a polyanionic framework of six&#8208;membered rings of corner&#8208;sharing InP4 tetrahedra. As a result, the newly designed semiconductors with direct band gaps are suitable for optoelectronic applications, and they can provide significant guidance for the design of new functional semiconductors.</dc:description>

         <title>Photoelectrocatalytic Utilization of CO2: A Big Show of Si&#8208;based Photoelectrodes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>CO2 is a greenhouse gas that contributes to environmental deterioration; however, it can also be utilized as an abundant C1 resource for the production of valuable chemicals. Solar&#8208;driven photoelectrocatalytic (PEC) CO2 utilization represents an advanced technology for the resourcing of CO2. The key to achieving PEC CO2 utilization lies in high&#8208;performance semiconductor photoelectrodes. Si&#8208;based photoelectrodes have attracted increasing attention in the field of PEC CO2 utilization due to their suitable band gap (1.1 eV), high carrier mobility, low cost, and abundance on Earth. There are two pathways to PEC CO2 utilization using Si&#8208;based photoelectrodes: direct reduction of CO2 into small molecule fuels and chemicals, and fixation of CO2 with organic substrates to generate high&#8208;value chemicals. The efficiency and product selectivity of PEC CO2 utilization depends on the structures of the photoelectrodes as well as the composition, morphology, and size of the catalysts. In recent years, significant and influential progress has been made in utilizing Si&#8208;based photoelectrodes for PEC CO2 utilization. This review summarizes the latest research achievements in Si&#8208;based PEC CO2 utilization, with a particular emphasis on the mechanistic understanding of CO2 reduction and fixation, which will inspire future developments in this field.</dc:description>

         <title>Revisiting Peri&#8208;Aryloxyquinones: From a Forgotten Photochromic System to a Promising Tool for Emerging Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Peri&#8208;AryloxyQuinones (PAQs) undergo a reversible light&#8208;induced arylotropy between para&#8208; and ana&#8208;quinone states. The structure&#8208;switch relationships, mechanism of molecular photochromism as well as potential applications and prospects of PAQs in optically switchable materials and devices are discussed.







Abstract
Emerging applications of photochromic compounds demand new molecular designs that can be inspired by some long&#8208;known yet currently forgotten classes of photoswitches. In the present review, we remind the community about Peri&#8208;AryloxyQuinones (PAQs) and their unique photoswitching behavior originally discovered more than 50&#8197;years ago. At the heart of this phenomenon is the light&#8208;induced migration of an aromatic moiety (arylotropy) in peri&#8208;aryloxy&#8208;substituted quinones resulting in ana&#8208;quinones. PAQs feature absorbance of both isomers in the visible spectral region, photochromism in the amorphous and crystalline state, and thermal stability of the photogenerated ana&#8208;isomer. Particularly noticeable is the high sensitivity of the ana&#8208;isomer towards nucleophiles in solution. In addition to the mechanism of molecular photochromism and the underlaying structure&#8208;switch relationships, we analyze potential applications and prospects of aryloxyquinones in optically switchable materials and devices. Due to their ability to efficiently photoswitch in the solid state, PAQs are indeed attractive candidates for such materials and devices, including electronics (optically controllable circuits, switches, transistors, memories, and displays), porous crystalline materials, crystalline actuators, photoactivated sensors, and many more. This review is intended to serve as a guide for researchers who wish to use photoswitchable PAQs in the development of new photocontrollable materials, devices, and processes.

         <title>Borirenes and Boriranes: Development and Perspectives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Borirenes and boriranes, both featuring a BC2 three&#8208;membered ring, represent a class of compounds that combine substantial ring strain with Lewis acidity. Further fusion with benzene and o&#8208;carborane through a shared CC bond leads to benzoborienes and carborane&#8208;fused boriranes, which exhibit even higher ring strain. This minireview summarizes their synthesis and reactivity and offers perspectives.







Abstract
Strained compounds constitute a highly topical area of research in chemistry. Borirene and borirane both feature a BC2 three&#8208;membered ring. They can be viewed as the structural analogues of cyclopropane and cyclopropene, where a CH2 unit of the carbonaceous counterparts is replaced with BH, respectively. Indeed, this structural variation introduces numerous intriguing aspects. For instance, borirane and borirene are both Lewis acidic due to the presence of a tricoordinate borane center. In addition, borirene is 2&#960; aromatic according to H&#252;ckel's rule. In addition to their ability to form adducts with Lewis bases and the capacity of borirenes to act as ligands in coordination with metals, both borirenes and boriranes exhibit ring&#8208;opening reactivity due to the considerable ring strain. Under specific conditions, coordinated boriranes can even cleave two BC bonds to serve as formal borylene sources (although the reaction mechanisms are quite complex). On the other hand, recent successful syntheses of benzoborienes and their carborane&#8208;based three&#8208;dimensional analogues (also referred to as carborane&#8208;fused boriranes) have introduced novel perspectives to this field. For instance, they display excellent ring&#8208;expanding reactivity, possibly attributed to the boosted ring strain arising from the fusion of borirenes with benzene and boriranes with o&#8208;carborane. Importantly, their applications as valuable &#8220;BC2&#8221; synthons have become increasingly evident along with the newly disclosed reactivity. Additionally, the boosted Lewis acidity of carborane&#8208;fused boriranes, thanks to the potent electron&#8208;withdrawing effect of o&#8208;carborane, combined with their readiness for ring enlargement, makes them promising candidates as electron&#8208;accepting building blocks in the construction of chemically responsive luminescent materials. This review provides a summary of the synthesis and reactivity of borirene and borirane derivatives, with the aim of encouraging the design of new borierene&#8208; and borirane&#8208;based molecules and inspiring further exploration of their potential applications.

         <title>Structural Impact of N&#8208;terminal Pyroglutamylate in an Amyloid&#8208;&#946;(3&#8208;42) Fibril Probed by Solid&#8208;State NMR Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Solid state NMR spectroscopy on fibrils of recombinant, pyroglutamylated [U&#8208;13C,15N]&#8208; pEA&#946;(3&#8208;42) show highly similar &#946;&#8208;strand positions and a conserved turn region around V24 comparable to LS&#8208;shaped A&#946;(1&#8208;42) fibrils. Due to missing D1&#8208;A2 and pE3 formation a salt bridge of K28&#8208;D1' is absent in pEA&#946;(3&#8208;42) fibrils. G37&#8208;G38 act as sensors for the N&#8208;terminal modifications in pEA&#946;(3&#8208;42) fibrils.







Abstract
Extracellular amyloid&#8208;&#946; (A&#946;) plaques, primarily formed by A&#946;(1&#8208;40) and A&#946;(1&#8208;42) fibrils, are a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease. The A&#946; peptide can undergo a high variety of different post&#8208;translational modifications including formation of a pyroglutamate (pGlu, pE) at N&#8208;terminal Glu3 or Glu11 of truncated A&#946;(3&#8208;x) or A&#946;(11&#8208;x), respectively. Here we studied structural similarities and differences between pEA&#946;(3&#8208;42) and LS&#8208;shaped A&#946;(1&#8208;42) fibrils grown under identical conditions (pH&#8197;2) using solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy. We show that the central region of pEA&#946;(3&#8208;42) fibrils including the turn region around V24 is almost identical to A&#946;(1&#8208;42) showing similar &#946;&#8208;strands also at the N&#8208;terminus. The missing N&#8208;terminal residues D1&#8208;A2 along with pE3 formation in pEA&#946;(3&#8208;42) preclude a salt bridge between K28&#8208;D1' as in A&#946;(1&#8208;42) fibrils. G37 and G38 act as highly sensitive internal sensors for the modified N&#8208;terminus, which remains rigid over ~five pH units.

         <title>The Fluoride Method: Access to Silver(III) NHC Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We have synthesized the first silver(III) carbene complexes, (CF3)3Ag(NHC), by direct reaction of the silver(III) fluoride precursor complex [PPh4][(CF3)3AgF] with different imidazolium salts. This novel methodology circumvents the use of free NHC molecules. The silver(III) carbene complexes thus prepared are unprecedented and show remarkable thermal stabilities. They display square&#8208;planar or square&#8208;pyramidal geometry. Following our calculations, the electronic structure of a model representative complex exhibits Inverse Ligand Field (ILF). The compounds reported herein are synthetic analogues of the elusive difluorocarbene and carbonyl species proposed as intermediates in the acidic decomposition of [Ag(CF3)4]&#8722;. The synthetic procedure reported is envisaged to enable access to carbene complexes of other late transition&#8208;metals in high oxidation states.</dc:description>

         <title>Binding of Acetylated Lysine by Using a Water Soluble Aryl Extended Calix[4]pyrrole</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Post&#8208;translational modifications of lysine in histones, as methylation and acetylation, have well established functions in epigenetics and are emerging as important actors in broader biological regulation. Currently, the detection of acetylated lysine (Kac) in water solution as free amino acid or protein residue remains challenging. Acetylated lysine is a neutral amino acid, and the lack of ion&#8211;dipole interactions causes the decrease in binding affinity displayed by synthetic molecular receptors with respect to the other lysine modifications. Here, we report molecular modeling calculations and 1H NMR experiments to investigate the binding properties of two different calix[4]pyrrole receptors towards Kac. Computational analyses reveal that tetra&#8208;aryl&#8208;extended calix[4]pyrrole (1) preferentially binds the cis&#8208;Kac conformer over the trans one due to steric considerations and more favorable interactions. Experimental 1H NMR titration experiments confirm the formation of a 1:1 complex between receptor 1 and cis&#8208;Kac, with a Ka exceeding 103 M&#8208;1. Conversely, the super&#8208;aryl&#8208;extended calix[4]pyrrole 2 is less efficient in binding Kac, due to unfavorable solvation/desolvation effects, as proven by 1H NMR experiments. Moreover, receptor 1 showed a higher affinity for Kac over other lysine modifications, such as methylated lysines.</dc:description>

         <title>Pyrrole &#946;C&#8208;B&#8208;N Fused Porphyrins: Molecular Structures and Opto&#8208;Electrochemical Studies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we report the design, synthesis, structure, and electrochemical study of doubly &#946;C&#8208;B&#8208;N fused Ni(II) porphyrins (1&#8208;trans, 1&#8208;cis, 2&#8208;trans, and 2&#8208;cis). These compounds were synthesized from A2B2 type dipyridyl Ni(II) porphyrins (Ar = Ph for 1a; Ar = C6F5 for 2a) via Lewis base&#8208;directed electrophilic aromatic borylation reactions. The solution state structures of these compounds were established using 1H NMR, 11B NMR, 1H&#8208;1H COSY, 1H&#8208;13C HSQC, and 19F&#8208;13C HSQC NMR techniques. Single crystal X&#8208;ray analysis revealed that 1&#8208;trans, 1&#8208;cis, and 2&#8208;trans adopt ruffled conformations, with alternate meso&#8208;carbons on the opposite sides of the mean porphyrin plane. The Soret bands in the absorption spectra of the B&#8208;N fused molecules are ~40 nm redshifted compared to unfused Ni(II) porphyrin precursors. The B&#8208;N fusion diminishes the redox potential of fused porphyrins. Although 1&#8208;trans and 1&#8208;cis, show four oxidation processes, 2&#8208;trans and 2&#8208;cis showed only three oxidation processes. DFT studies revealed that the tetrahedral geometry of the boron induces a twist in the &#960;&#8208;conjugation, which destabilizes the HOMO and stabilizes the LUMO in 1&#8208;trans, 1&#8208;cis, 2&#8208;trans, and 2&#8208;cis.</dc:description>

DFT studies revealed that the tetrahedral geometry of the boron induces a twist in the &#960;-conjugation, which destabilizes the HOMO and stabilizes the LUMO in 1-trans, 1-cis, 2-trans, and 2-cis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Conformations and Rearrangements of Collinolactone &#8211; Experiments and Theory on a Dynamic Cyclodecatriene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a series of new isomers of collinolactone A which were obtained from thermal, and acid promoted rearrangements of the natural product. We are able to rationalize these findings through detailed quantum chemical computations of the involved conformers and their reactions.







Abstract
Collinolactone A is a microbial specialized metabolite with a unique 6&#8208;10&#8208;7 tricyclic bislactone skeleton which was isolated from Streptomyces bacteria. The unusual cyclodecatriene motif features dynamic interconversions of two rotamers. Given the biological profiling of collinolactone A as neuroprotective agent, semisynthetic modifications represent an invaluable strategy to enhance its efficacy. Since understanding conformations and reactions of bioactive substances is crucial for rational structure&#8208;based design and synthesis of derivatives, we conducted computational studies on conformational behavior as well as experiments on thermal and acid induced rearrangements of the cyclodecatriene. Experimental conformer ratios of collinolactone A and its biosynthetic ketolactone precursor are well reproduced by computations at the PW6B95&#8208;D3/def2&#8208;QZVPP//r2SCAN&#8208;3c level. Upon heating collinolactone A in anhydrous dioxane at 100&#8201;&#176;C, three collinolactone B stereoisomers exhibiting enollactone structures form via Cope rearrangements. Our computations predict the energetic preference for a boat&#8208;like transition state in agreement with the stereochemical outcome of the main reaction pathway. Constriction of the ten&#8208;membered ring forms collinolactone C with four annulated rings and an exocyclic double bond. Computations and semisynthetic experiments demonstrate strong preference for an acid&#8208;catalyzed reaction pathway over an alternative Alder&#8208;ene route to collinolactone C with a prohibitive reaction barrier, again in line with stereochemical observations.

         <title>n&#8208;Type Fullerene&#8208;Carbon Dots: Synthesis and Electrochemical and Photophysical Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The covalent anchoring of electron acceptors derived of [6,6]&#8208;phenyl&#8208;fullerene&#8208;methyl butyrate (PC61BM and PC71BM) to carbon dots (CD) was carried out successfully and the obtained hybrid nanomaterials characterized by means of AFM microscopy, and FTIR and XPS spectroscopies. Electrochemical and photophysical studies confirmed the electronic communication between the covalently connected units and their promise for further photo&#8208; and electronic applications.







Abstract
The covalent incorporation of C60 and C70 derivatives of the well&#8208;known n&#8208;type organic semiconductor PCBM ([6,6]&#8208;phenyl&#8208;C61&#8208;butyric acid methyl ester) onto carbon dots (CD) is described. Morphological and structural characterization reveal combined features of both pristine starting materials (CD and PCBM). Electrochemical investigations evidenced the existence of additional reduction processes to that of CD or PCBM precursors, showing rich electron&#8208;acceptor capabilities, with multistep processes in an affordable and narrow electrochemical window (ca. 1.5&#8197;V). Electronic communication in the obtained nanoconjugated species were derived from steady&#8208;state absorption and emission spectroscopies, which showed bathochromically shifted absorptions and emissions well entering the red region. Finally, the lower fluorescence quantum yield of CD&#8208;PCBM nanoconjugates, compared with CD, and the fast decay of the observed emission of CD, support the existence of an electronic communication between both CD and PCBM units in the excited state.

         <title>Bottom&#8208;Up Construction of Ni(II)&#8208;Incorporated Covalent Organic Framework for Metallaphotoredox Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a facile bottom&#8208;up strategy to synthesize Ni(II)&#8208;incorporated covalent organic framework (LZU&#8208;713@Ni) as heterogeneous all&#8208;in&#8208;one metallaphotoredox catalyst. LZU&#8208;713@Ni showed excellent activity and recyclability in photoredox/nickel&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;O, C&#8722;S, and C&#8722;P cross&#8208;coupling reactions. The superiority of bottom&#8208;up strategy was exemplified by the increased activity of LZU&#8208;713@Ni compared to both the dual catalyst system and LZU&#8208;713/Ni prepared via post&#8208;synthetic modification.







Abstract
The construction of an all&#8208;in&#8208;one catalyst, in which the photosensitizer and the transition metal site are close to each other, is important for improving the efficiency of metallaphotoredox catalysis. However, the development of convenient synthetic strategies for the precise construction of an all&#8208;in&#8208;one catalyst remains a challenging task due to the requirement of precise installation of the catalytic sites. Herein, we have successfully established a facile bottom&#8208;up strategy for the direct synthesis of Ni(II)&#8208;incorporated covalent organic framework (COF), named LZU&#8208;713@Ni, as a versatile all&#8208;in&#8208;one metallaphotoredox catalyst. LZU&#8208;713@Ni showed excellent activity and recyclability in the photoredox/nickel&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;O, C&#8722;S, and C&#8722;P cross&#8208;coupling reactions. Notably, this catalyst displayed a better catalytic activity than its homogeneous analogues, physically mixed dual catalyst system, and, especially, LZU&#8208;713/Ni which was prepared through post&#8208;synthetic modification. The improved catalytic efficiency of LZU&#8208;713@Ni should be attributed to the implementation of bottom&#8208;up strategy, which incorporated the fixed, ordered, and abundant catalytic sites into its framework. This work sheds new light on the exploration of concise and effective strategies for the construction of multifunctional COF&#8208;based photocatalysts.

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Responsive Polyoxometalate@Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks Involving Ir Metalloligands for Highly Selective Photocatalytic Oxidation of Sulfides to Sulfoxide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have synthesized a crystalline POM@MOF (Ir&#8722;SiW) by assembling Ir metalloligands and POMs for the first time. Ir&#8722;SiW has high activity for selective oxidation sulfide to sulfoxide, with a yield of 99.5&#8201;% within 2.5&#8197;h, which is higher than the currently known POM&#8208;based photocatalysts.







Abstract
The synthesis of highly efficient visible&#8208;light&#8208;responsive photocatalysts is fundamental to solving the problems of low efficiency and poor selectivity in photocatalytic organic synthesis reactions. We synthesized a crystalline polyoxometalate @metal&#8208;organic framework material {Zn4(H2O)8[Ir(ppy)2(dcbpy)]4[SiW12O40]}&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;4H2O (Ir&#8722;SiW) by self&#8208;assembly of Ir metalloligands with POMs. The introduction of Ir metalloligands extends the light absorbing range to visible light, improving the efficient utilization of solar energy. The transfer of photogenerated electrons from Ir metalloligands to SiW12 was observed under visible light irradiation, which boosted the carrier separation efficiency. The synergistic effect of the two components increased the photocatalytic thioether oxidation activity, and the product methyl phenyl sulfoxide for 2.5&#8197;h under visible light irradiation (&#955; &gt;400&#8197;nm) reached 99.5&#8201;%, which was higher than those of other POM&#8208;based photocatalysts. Meanwhile, the yield of methyl phenyl sulfoxide was still higher than 97&#8201;% after three cycles, demonstrating the high stability and reusability of Ir&#8722;SiW.

         <title>Unveiling the Anomaly of Reduction of Carborane&#8208;bis&#8208;silylene&#8208;Stabilised Silylone/Germylone Leading to Unusual Oxidation of Si0/Ge0 to SiI/GeI with EDA&#8208;NOCV Analyses</title>

         <dc:description>
The most favourable bonding scenario in carborane&#8208;bis&#8208;silylene stabilized silylone and germylone has been uncovered by density functional calculations and EDA&#8208;NOCV analyses. The interactions between the negatively charged carborane and positively charged bis&#8208;silylene fragments in their doublet states are likely to form one covalent electron&#8208;sharing bond and one covalent dative bond. These findings provide a detailed understanding of the bonding interactions within these species, helping us to infer why the carborane fragment undergoes intramolecular electronic rearrangements, and shed light on the fragments&#8217; stability, distribution of electron densities and often unusual reactivity.







Abstract
Researchers have successfully isolated Si0/Ge0 species, termed silylone and germylone, with two lone pairs of electrons on them. These elusive compounds have been stabilised in singlet ground states by using different donor base ligands. Driess et&#8197;al. in particular have made strides in this area, isolating carborane&#8208;bis&#8208;silylene&#8208;stabilised silylone/germylone and their N+/Pb analogues. Carborane (C2B10H10) plays a pivotal role as a redox&#8208;active ligand, converting from closo&#8208;carborane to nido&#8208;carborane with the addition of two electrons. Notably, anomalous oxidation of Si0/Ge0 centres in carborane&#8208;bis&#8208;silylene&#8208;stabilised species to SiI/GeI has been reported, resulting in the formation of dimeric SiI&#8722;SiI/GeI&#8722;GeI di&#8208;cationic units. The energy decomposition analysis coupled with natural orbital for chemical valence (EDA&#8208;NOCV) study focuses on the carborane&#8208;bis&#8208;silylene ligand in the free state, and its three other species, including silylone/germylone species. Interestingly, it reveals that the carborane unit in an anionic doublet state tends to form one electron&#8208;sharing bond and one dative bond with the counter fragment in its cationic doublet state. This helps us to rationalise why the carborane unit undergoes intramolecular electronic rearrangements leading to the formation of a di&#8208;anionic carborane unit with a significantly elongated C&#8722;C bond (2.38&#8211;2.68&#8197;&#197;) and undergoes unusual oxidation of Si0/Ge0 to SiI/GeI.

         <title>Pertechnetate/perrhenate&#8208;capped Zr/Hf&#8208;Dihydroxide Dimers: Elucidating Zr&#8722;TcO4 Co&#8208;Mobility in the Nuclear Fuel Cycle</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The well&#8208;known Zr/Hf4&#8208;tetramer is cleaved in aqueous solutions by perrhenate/pertechnetate to yield a dihydroxide dimer capped by these oxoanions. Structure and solution characterization of this complex along with solvent extraction studies elucidates 93Zr&#8208;99Tc co&#8208;extraction (two of the most abundant and problematic 235U fission products) during nuclear fuel reprocessing.







Abstract
Spent nuclear fuel contains heavy element fission products that must be separated for effective reprocessing for a safe and sustainable nuclear fuel cycle. 93Zr and 99Tc are high&#8208;yield fission products that co&#8208;transport in liquid&#8208;liquid extraction processes. Here we seek atomic&#8208;level information of this co&#8208;extraction process, as well as fundamental knowledge about ZrIV (and HfIV) aqueous speciation in the presence of topology&#8208;directing ligands such as pertechnetate (TcO4&#8722;) and non&#8208;radioactive surrogate perrhenate (ReO4&#8722;). In this context, we show that the flat tetrameric oxyhydroxyl&#8208;cluster [MIV4(OH)8(H2O)16]8+ (and related polymers) is dissociated by perrhenate/pertechnetate to yield isostructural dimers, M2(OH)2(XO4&#8722;)6(H2O)6&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;3H2O (M=Zr/HfIV; X=Re/TcVII), elucidated by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. We used these model compounds to understand the pervasive 93Zr&#8208;99Tc coextraction with further speciation studies in water, nitric acid, and tetrabutylphosphate (TBP) &#8208;kerosene; where the latter two media are relevant to nuclear fuel reprocessing. SAXS (small angle X&#8208;ray scattering), compositional evaluation, and where experimentally feasible, ESI&#8208;MS (electrospray ionization mass spectrometry) showed that perrhenate/pertechnetate influence Zr/HfIV&#8208;speciation in water. In Zr&#8208;XO4 solvent extraction studies to simulate fuel reprocessing, we provide evidence that TcO4&#8722; enhances extraction of ZrIV, and compositional analysis of the extracted metal&#8208;complexes (Zr&#8208;ReO4 study) is consistent with the crystallized ZrIV2(OH)2(ReVIIO4&#8722;)6(H2O)6&#8901;dimer.

         <title>Synthesis and Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction of a Cyclic Zinc(II) Porphyrin Trimer with an Encapsulated Rhenium(I) Bipyridine Tricarbonyl Complex</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We introduced a [Re(CO)3Br] fragment into the trimer to create a new heterobimetallic photocatalyst. The presence of ester groups in the Zn porphyrin trimer significantly deactivated CO2 reduction. After converting the ester groups to acetoxymethyl groups, the photocatalytic activity was remarkably enhanced. The modified trimer exhibited Re&#8208;induced phosphorescence, which was quenched by an electron donor, indicating efficient electron transfer during CO2 reduction.







Abstract
We previously reported a cyclic Zn(II) porphyrin trimer in which three Zn porphyrins are alternately bridged by three 2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine (bpy) moieties, enabling the encapsulation of metal complexes within the nanopore formed by the Zn porphyrins. In this study, we introduced a [Re(CO)3Br] fragment into one of the bpy moieties of the cyclic trimer to form the catalytic Re(4,4&#8217;&#8208;R2&#8208;bpy)(CO)3Br center (R=methyl ester). The ester groups (R) play an important role in the synthesis of the cyclic structure. However, it was observed that these ester groups significantly deactivated the photocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction. Therefore, we converted the ester groups with a suitable reducing reagent into hydroxymethyl groups, followed by acetylation to form acetoxymethyl groups. This modification remarkably enhanced the photocatalytic activity of the cyclic trimer=Re complex system for CO2 reduction. Moreover, in the modified system, the presence of the Re complex induced room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence of the Zn porphyrin. The phosphorescence was significantly quenched by 1,3&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;2&#8208;phenyl&#8208;2,3&#8208;dihydro&#8208;1H&#8208;benzo[d]imidazole, indicating that efficient electron transfer mediated by the excited triplet state of the Zn porphyrin occurs during the photocatalytic CO2 reduction.

         <title>Electrophilic Fluorination of Silyl Dienol Ethers: a General and Selective Access to &#947;&#8208;Fluoro Enals</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first general synthesis of &#947;&#8208;fluoro &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated aldehydes was achieved from the corresponding silyl dienol ethers and N&#8208;fluorobenzenesulfonimide (NFSI). The complete selectivity towards the &#947; position was rationalized thanks to DFT calculations.







Abstract
We describe the direct synthesis of &#947;&#8208;fluoro enals from the corresponding silyl dienol ethers. This simple process operates under mild conditions and is compatible with a wide range of functionalities. The high &#947; regioselectivity of this protocol was rationalized by means of theoretical calculations.

         <title>Photophysical Analysis of Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission (AIE) Luminogens Based on Triphenylamine and Thiophene: Insights into Emission Behavior in Solution and PMMA Films</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photophysical analysis of the Triphenylamine&#8722;Thiophene Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission luminogen was conducted in solution and PMMA films. In a solution, emission can arise from either the locally excited (LE) or twisted intramolecular charge transfer (TICT) state, depending on the solvent. In PMMA films, only LE state emission occurs, but excimer&#8208;like formations reduce emission intensity. This effect was probe in Luminescent Solar Concentrator.







Abstract
Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission (AIE) luminogens have garnered significant interest due to their distinctive applications in different applications. Among the diverse molecular architectures, those based on triphenylamine and thiophene hold prominence. However, a comprehensive understanding of the deactivation mechanism both in solution and films remains lacking. In this study, we synthesized and characterized spectroscopically two AIE luminogens: 5&#8208;(4&#8208;(bis(4&#8208;methoxyphenyl)amino)phenyl)thiophene&#8208;2&#8208;carbaldehyde (TTY) and 5&#8242;&#8208;(4&#8208;(bis(4&#8208;methoxyphenyl)amino)phenyl)&#8208;[2,2&#8242;&#8208;bithiophene]&#8208;5&#8208;carbaldehyde (TTO). Photophysical and theoretical analyses were conducted in both solution and PMMA films to understand the deactivation mechanism of TTY and TTO. In diluted solutions, the emission behavior of TTY and TTO is influenced by the solvent, and the deactivation of the excited state can occur via locally excited (LE) or twisted intramolecular charge transfer (TICT) state. In PMMA films, rotational and translational movements are constrained, necessitating emission solely from the LE state. Nevertheless, in the PMMA film, excimers&#8208;like structures form, resulting in the emergence of a longer wavelength band and a reduction in emission intensity. The zenith of emission intensity occurs when molecules are dispersed at higher concentrations within PMMA, effectively diminishing the likelihood of excimer&#8208;like formations. Luminescent Solar Concentrators (LSC) were fabricated to validate these findings, and the optical efficiency was studied at varying concentrations of luminogen and PMMA.

         <title>Cucurbit[7]uril&#8208;mediated Histidine Dimerization: Exploring the Structure and Binding Mechanism</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Histidine amino acid forms a 2&#8201;:&#8201;1 complex with cucurbit[7]uril (CB7), as confirmed using X&#8208;ray diffraction experiments. The affinity of histidine in oligopeptides strongly depends on the neighbouring residues in the sequence, with the strongest binding observed for Tyr&#8208;His and Leu&#8208;His.







Abstract
Cucurbit[7,8]urils are known to form inclusion complexes with hydrophobic amino acids such as Trp, Tyr, Phe, and Met, as well as peptides containing these residues at the N&#8208;terminus. Despite their widespread use in protein purification, the affinity of histidine (His) for cucurbit[7,8]urils has not been extensively explored. In this study, X&#8208;ray diffraction experiments were conducted to investigate the binding of two histidine moieties to the cucurbit[7]uril (CB7) cavity, resulting in a network of &#960;&#8211;&#960; and hydrogen bonds. This assembly was found to induce a His pKa shift of &#916;pKa=&#8722;4. Histidine weakly bound to CB7 or CB8; however, isothermal titration calorimetry revealed micromolar equilibrium dissociation constant values for CB7 and CB8 when bound to dipeptides containing His at the C&#8208;terminus. Conversely, dipeptides with His at the N&#8208;terminus exhibited millimolar values. Additionally, the His&#8208;Gly&#8208;Gly tripeptide formed a 2&#8201;:&#8201;1 complex with CB7. These findings suggest the potential use of histidine and histidine&#8208;containing tags in conjunction with CB7 for various biological applications.

         <title>Cyclometalated gold(III)&#8208;hydride under oriented external electric fields: a new strategy to modulate its reactivity?</title>

Cyclometalated gold(III)&#8208;hydride under electric fields: The effect of oriented external electric fields (OEEFs) on the geometric structure, electronic properties, and chemical reactivity of a potential antitumor drug, namely a novel gold(III)&#8208;hydride complex has been systematically investigated on the basis of the density functional theory.







Abstract
Selected gold complexes have been regarded as promising anti&#8208;cancer agents because they can bind with protein targets containing thiol or selenol moieties, but their clinical applications were hindered by the unbiased binding towards off&#8208;target thiol&#8208;proteins. Recently, a novel gold(III)&#8208;hydride complex (abbreviated as 1) with visible light&#8208;induced thiol reactivity has been reported as potent photo&#8208;activated anticancer agents (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed., 2020, 132, 11139). To explore new strategies to stimuli this potential antitumor drug, the effect of oriented external electric fields (OEEFs) on its geometric structure, electronic properties, and chemical reactivity was systematically investigated. Results reveal that imposing external electric fields along the Au&#8722;H bond of 1 can effectively activate this bond, which is conducive to its dissociation and the binding of Au site to potential targets. Hence, this study provides a new OEEF&#8208;strategy to activate this reported gold(III)&#8208;hydride, revealing its potential application in electrochemical therapy. We anticipate this work could promote the development of more electric field&#8208;activated anticancer agents. However, further experimental research should be conducted to verify the conclusions obtained in this work.

         <title>Label&#8208;Free Detection of Unbound Bilirubin and Nitrophenol Explosives in Water by a Mechanosynthesized Dual Functional Zinc Complex: Recognition of Picric Acid in Various Common Organic Media</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This article describes label&#8208;free instant dual detection of unconjugated bilirubin and picric acid in pure aqueous solution by a mechanosynthesized luminescent zinc(II) complex, which can be performed via pH tuning of the medium.







Abstract
High levels of unconjugated bilirubin (UB) in serum lead to asymptomatic and neonatal jaundice and brain dysfunctions. Herein, we have reported the detection of UB at as low as 1&#8197;&#956;M in an aqueous alkaline medium using a Zn(II) complex. The specificity of the complex has been validated by the HPLC in the concentration window 6&#8211;90&#8197;&#956;M, which is rare. The sensory response of the probe at physiological pH against nitro explosives developed it as an instant&#8208;acting fluorosensor for picric acid (PA) and 2,4&#8208;dinitrophenol (2,4&#8208;DNP). Spectroscopic titration provided a binding constant of 4&#215;105&#8197;M&#8722;1 with PA. The naked eye detection was found to be 15&#8197;&#956;M. The solid&#8208;state photoluminescent nature of the complex enabled it for PA sensing in the solid phase. Interestingly, the probe remained fluorescent in various volatile and non&#8208;volatile organic solvents. As a result, it can also detect PA and 2,4&#8208;DNP in a wide range of common organic media. NMR studies revealed the coordination of PA, 2,4&#8208;DNP, and UB to the Zn(II) center of the probe, which is responsible for the observed quenching of the probe with the analytes.

         <title>Anthraquinone&#8208;Modified Silica Nanoparticles as Heterogeneous Photocatalyst for the Oxidative Hydroxylation of Arylboronic Acids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this work, the synthesis and characterization of a heterogeneous photocatalyst based on spherical silica nanoparticles superficially modified with anthraquinone 2&#8208;carboxylic acid (AQ&#8208;COOH) are presented. The nanomaterial was characterized by TEM, SEM, FT&#8208;IR, diffuse reflectance, fluorescence, NMR, DLS, XRD and XPS. These analyses confirm the covalent linking of AQ&#8208;COOH with the NH2 functionality in the nanomaterial and, more importantly, the photocatalyst retains its photophysical properties once bound. The heterogeneous photocatalyst was successfully employed in the aerobic hydroxylation of arylboronic acids to phenols under sustainable reaction conditions. Phenols were obtained in high yields (up to 100 %) with low catalyst loading (3.5 mol %), reaching TOF values of 3.7 h&#8208;1. Using 2&#8208;propanol as solvent at room temperature, the visible light photocatalysis produced H2O2 as a key intermediate to promote the aerobic hydroxylation of arylboronic acids. The heterogeneous photocatalyst was reused at least 5 times, without modification of the nanomaterial structure and morphology. This simple heterogeneous system showed great catalytic activity under sustainable reaction conditions.</dc:description>

Phenols were obtained in high yields (up to 100 %) with low catalyst loading (3.5 mol %), reaching TOF values of 3.7 h-1. Using 2-propanol as solvent at room temperature, the visible light photocatalysis produced H2O2 as a key intermediate to promote the aerobic hydroxylation of arylboronic acids. The heterogeneous photocatalyst was reused at least 5 times, without modification of the nanomaterial structure and morphology. This simple heterogeneous system showed great catalytic activity under sustainable reaction conditions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A functional electrolyte containing P&#8208;phenyl diisothiocyanate (PDITC) additive achieves the interphase stability of high nickel cathode in a wide temperature range</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) with high nickel cathode have high specific energy, but as the nickel content in the cathode active material increases, batteries are suffering from temperature limitations, unstable performance, and transition metal dissolution during long cycling. In this work, a functional electrolyte with P&#8208;phenyl diisothiocyanate (PDITC) additive is developed to stabilize the performance of LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 (NCM811)/graphite LIBs over a wide temperature range. Compared to the batteries without the additive, the capacity retention of the batteries with PDITC&#8208;containing electrolyte increases from 23% to 74% after 1400 cycles at 25 &#176;C, and from 15% to 85% after 300 cycles at 45 &#176;C. After being stored at 60 &#176;C, the capacity retention rate and capacity recovery rate of the battery are also improved. In addition, the PDITC&#8208;containing battery has a higher discharge capacity at &#8208;20 &#176;C, and the capacity retention rate increases from 79% to 90% after 500 cycles at 0 &#176;C. Both theoretical calculations and spectroscopic results demonstrate that PDITC is involved in constructing a dense interphase, inhibiting the decomposition of the electrolyte and reducing the interfacial impedance. The application of PDITC provides a new strategy to improve the wide&#8208;temperature performance of the NCM811/graphite LIBs.</dc:description>

         <title>Hydride&#8208;Containing Pt&#8208;doped Cu&#8208;rich Nanoclusters: Synthesis, Structure, and Electrocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A structurally precise hydride&#8208;containing Pt&#8208;doped Cu&#8208;rich nanocluster [PtH2Cu14{S2P(OiPr)2}6(CCPh)6] (1) has been synthesized. It consists of a bicapped icosahedral Cu14 cage that encapsulates a linear PtH2 unit. Upon the addition of two equivalents of CF3COOH to 1, two hydrido clusters are isolated. These clusters are [PtHCu11{S2P(OiPr)2}6(CCPh)4] (2), which is a vertex&#8208;missing Cu11 cuboctahedron encaging a PtH moiety, and [PtH2Cu11{S2P(OiPr)2}6(CCPh)3] (3), a distorted 3,3,4,4,4&#8208;pentacapped trigonal prismatic Cu11 cage enclosing a PtH2 unit. The electronic structure of 2, analyzed by Density Functional Theory, is a 2e superatom. The electrocatalytic activities of 1&#8208;3 for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) were compared. Notably, Cluster 2 exhibited an exceptionally excellent HER activity within metal nanoclusters, with an onset potential of &#8211;0.03&#8197;V (at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2), a Tafel slope of 39&#8197;mV&#8201;dec&#8722;1, and consistent HER activity throughout 3000&#8197;cycles in 0.5&#8197;M H2SO4. Our study suggests that the accessible central Pt site plays a crucial role in the remarkable HER activity and may provide valuable insights for establishing correlations between catalyst structure and HER activity.</dc:description>

         <title>Anthraquinodimethane&#8208;Based Molecular Switches Tethered by Four&#8208;Arm Star&#8208;like Polymers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Molecular switches that reversibly change their structures and physical properties are important for applications such as sensing and information processing at molecular scales. In order to avoid the intermolecular aggregation that is often detrimental to the stimuli&#8208;responses of molecular switches, previous studies of molecular switches have been often conducted in dilute solutions which are difficult for applications in solid&#8208;state devices. Here we report molecular design and synthesis that integrates anthraquinodimethane as molecular switching units into polymers with amenable processibility in solid states. Optical and electron spin resonance characterizations indicate that the four&#8208;arm polymers of poly(&#949;&#8208;caprolactone) or poly(D,L&#8208;lactide) tethered from anthraquinodimethane slow down the dynamics of the conformational switching between the folded and the twisted conformations, enhance the photoluminescence in solid states and impart materials with a small energy gap from singlet ground state to thermally accessible triplet state.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhancing Polymer Electrolyte Membrane Fuel Cells with Ionic Liquids: A Review</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) represent a promising clean energy solution. However, their widespread adoption faces hurdles related to component optimization. This review explores the pivotal role of ionic liquids (ILs) in enhancing PEMFC performance, focusing on their role in polymer electrolyte membranes, catalyst modification, and other components. By addressing key obstacles, ILs provide a pathway towards the widespread commercialization of PEMFCs. In the realm of PEMFC membranes, ILs have shown great potential in improving proton conductivity, mechanical strength, and thermal stability. Additionally, the utilization of ILs as catalyst modifiers has shown promise in enhancing the electrocatalytic activity of electrodes and reduce their agglomeration, thereby augmenting catalytic performance. Furthermore, ILs can be tailored to optimize the catalyst&#8208;support interaction, ultimately enhancing the overall fuel cell efficiency. Their unique properties, such as high oxygen solubility and low volatility, offer advantages in terms of reducing mass transport and water management issues. This review not only underscores the promising advancements achieved thus far but also outlines the challenges that must be addressed to unlock the full potential of ILs in PEMFC technology, offering a valuable resource for researchers and engineers working toward the realization of efficient and durable PEMFCs.</dc:description>

         <title>Oxazaborolidinones: Steric Coverage Effect of Lewis Acidic Boron Center in Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura Coupling Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
&#945;&#8208;Hydroxycarboxamide moiety of oxazaborolidinone (OxB) dynamically covers the Lewis acidic boron center, providing stabilizing effects on unstable boronic acids including 2&#8208;furyl, vinyl, and alkyl groups and protective effects on OxB with haloaryl groups. Reported protection is useful for iterative couplings and Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura coupling reactions with OxBs prepared from unstable arylboronic acids.







Abstract
It was demonstrated that &#945;&#8208;hydroxycarboxamide is an excellent boron&#8208;protecting group. The reaction between &#945;&#8208;hydroxycarboxamide and organoboronic acids produced stable oxazaborolidinones (OxBs), in which the 
&#8208;hybridized boron atom was sterically protected by &#945;&#8208;hydroxycarboxamide. The alkyl groups of the &#945;&#8208;hydroxycarboxamide moiety can dynamically cover the p&#8208;orbital of the 
&#8208;hybridized boron center, creating a small space around the boron atom, allowing for smooth transmetalation by a Pd catalyst and easy deprotection by water.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&#945;-Hydroxycarboxamide moiety&lt;/b&gt; of oxazaborolidinone (OxB) dynamically covers the Lewis acidic boron center, providing stabilizing effects on unstable boronic acids including 2-furyl, vinyl, and alkyl groups and protective effects on OxB with haloaryl groups. Reported protection is useful for iterative couplings and Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura coupling reactions with OxBs prepared from unstable arylboronic acids.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was demonstrated that &#945;-hydroxycarboxamide is an excellent boron-protecting group. The reaction between &#945;-hydroxycarboxamide and organoboronic acids produced stable oxazaborolidinones (OxBs), in which the 
-hybridized boron atom was sterically protected by &#945;-hydroxycarboxamide. The alkyl groups of the &#945;-hydroxycarboxamide moiety can dynamically cover the &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;-orbital of the 
-hybridized boron center, creating a small space around the boron atom, allowing for smooth transmetalation by a Pd catalyst and easy deprotection by water. This protecting phenomenon is effective for readily purification, Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura coupling reactions with unstable boronic acids and iterative cross-couplings.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Oligo&#8208;Condensation Reactions of Silanediols with Conservation of Solid&#8208;State&#8208;Structural Features</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Oligo&#8208; and polysiloxanes are usually prepared by condensation reactions in solvents without control of stereochemistry. Here we present a solventless thermal condensation of stable organosilanols which act as precursors in a thermal condensation reaction. We investigated the condensation reactions of organosilanediols with different organic substituents, having in common at least one aromatic group. The condensation kinetics of the precursors observed by NMR spectroscopy revealed a strong dependence on temperature, time, and substitution pattern at the silicon atom. SEC measurements showed that chain length increases with increasing condensation temperature and time and lower steric demand of the substituents, which also influences the glass transition temperatures (Tg). X&#8208;ray diffraction studies of the crystalline silanediols and their condensation products revealed a structural correlation between the substituent location in the crystalline precursors and the formed polysiloxanes induced by the hydrogen bond pattern. In certain cases, it is possible to carry out topotactic polymerization in the solid&#8208;state, which has its origin in the crystal structure.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Supramolecular polymers built from stimuli&#8208;responsive host&#8208;guest interactions represent an attractive way of tailoring smart materials. Herein, we exploit the chaotropic effect of polyoxometalates and related host&#8208;guest properties to design unconventional polymer systems with reversible redox and thermo&#8208;responsive sol&#8208;gel transition. These supramolecular networks result from the association of cyclodextrin&#8208;based oligomers and Keggin&#8208;type POMs acting as electro&#8208;active crosslinking agents. The structure and the dynamics of such self&#8208;assembly systems have been investigated using a multiscale approach involving MALDI&#8208;TOF, viscosity measurements, cyclic voltammetry, 1H&#8208;NMR (1D and DOSY), and Small&#8208;Angle X&#8208;ray Scattering. Our results reveal that the chaotropic effect corresponds to a powerful and efficient force that can be used to induce responsiveness in hybrid supramolecular oligomeric systems.</dc:description>

         <title>The Phosphidosilicates AE2Li4SiP4 (AE = Ca, Sr, Eu) and Ba4Li16Si3P12</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The quaternary phosphidosilicates AE2Li4SiP4 (AE = Ca, Sr, Eu) and Ba4Li16Si3P12 were synthesized by heating the elements and Li3P under argon atmosphere. Their crystal structures were determined by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. AE2Li4SiP4 crystallize in a new layered structure type (P21/m, Z = 2) with CdI2&#8208;analoguos layers. Edge sharing CaP6 octahedra are separated by layers of vertex&#8208;sharing SiP4 and LiP4 tetrahedra, which contain additional chains of LiP6 octahedra. Ba4Li16Si3P12 forms likewise a new structure type (P21/c, Z = 16) with a three&#8208;dimensional network of SiP4, Si2P6 and LiP4 entities as well as one phosphorus site not bonded to silicon. Barium is located in capped trigonal prisms of phosphorus which form strongly corrugated layers. 31P and 29Si solid&#8208;state NMR spectra confirm the crystal structures of the compounds AE2Li4SiP4. 7Li spectra show only one signal in spite of quite different crystallographic positions, which indicate possible Li+ mobility.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The quaternary phosphidosilicates AE2Li4SiP4 (AE = Ca, Sr, Eu) and Ba4Li16Si3P12 were synthesized by heating the elements and Li3P under argon atmosphere. Their crystal structures were determined by single crystal X-ray diffraction. AE2Li4SiP4 crystallize in a new layered structure type (P21/m, Z = 2) with CdI2-analoguos layers. Edge sharing CaP6 octahedra are separated by layers of vertex-sharing SiP4 and LiP4 tetrahedra, which contain additional chains of LiP6 octahedra.

         <title>Single&#8208;ion spin qubits of Cu(II) doped in Zn(II) metal&#8208;organic frameworks above microsecond phase memory time</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>With the aim of creating single&#8208;ion Cu(II) spin qubits in a rigid metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF), this work demonstrates a doping of 5%, 2%, 1%, and 0.1% mol of Cu(II) ions into a perovskite&#8208;type MOF [CH6N3][Zn(HCOO)3]. The presence of dopant Cu(II) sites are confirmed with anisotropic g&#8208;factors (gx = 2.07, gy = 2.12, and gz = 2.44) in the S = 1/2 system by experimentally and theoretically. Magnetic dynamics indicate the occurrence of a slow magnetic relaxation via the direct and Raman processes under an applied field, with a relaxation time (&#964;) of 3.5 ms (5%Cu), 9.2 ms (2%Cu), and 15 ms (1%Cu) at 1.8 K. Furthermore, pulse&#8208;ESR spectroscopy reveals spin qubit properties with a spin&#8208;spin relaxation (phase memory) time (T2) of 0.21 &#956;s (2%Cu), 0.39 &#956;s (1%Cu), and 3.0 &#956;s (0.1%Cu) at 10 K as well as Rabi oscillation between MS = &#177;1/2 spin sublevels. T2 above microsecond is achieved for the first time in the Cu(II)&#8208;doped MOFs. It can be observed at submicrosecond around 50 K. These spin relaxations are very sensitive to the spin&#8211;spin interactions relating with cross&#8208;relaxation between the Cu(II) sites and can be tuned by adjusting the dopant concentration.</dc:description>

         <title>In vitro Production of Hemin&#8208;Based Artificial Metalloenzymes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing enzyme alternatives is pivotal to improving and enabling new processes in biotechnology and industry. Artificial metalloenzymes (ArMs) are combinations of protein scaffolds with metal elements, such as metal nanoclusters or metal&#8208;containing molecules with specific catalytic properties, which can be customized. Here, we engineered an ArM based on the consensus tetratricopeptide repeat (CTPR) scaffold by introducing a unique histidine residue to coordinate the hemin cofactor. Our results show that this engineered system exhibits robust peroxidase&#8208;like catalytic activity driven by the hemin. The expression of the scaffold and subsequent coordination of hemin was achieved by recombinant expression in bulk and through in vitro transcription and translation systems in water&#8208;in&#8208;oil drops. The ability to synthesize this system in emulsio paves the way to improve its properties by means of droplet microfluidic screenings, facilitating the exploration of the protein combinatorial space to discover improved or novel catalytic activities.</dc:description>

         <title>One&#8208;pot Construction of Metal Nanoparticles Loaded COF Catalysts for Aqueous Hydrogenation Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The catalysis performance of metal nanoparticles (NPs) will be significantly deteriorated because of their spontaneous agglomeration during practical applications. Covalent&#8208;organic frameworks (COFs) materials with functional groups and well&#8208;defined channels benefit for the dispersion and anchor of metal ions and the confined growth of metal NPs, working as an ideal platform to compose catalytic systems. In this article, we report a one&#8208;pot strategy for the preparation of metal NPs loaded COFs without the need of post&#8208;modification. During the polymerization process, the pre&#8208;added metal ions were stabilized by the rapidly formed COF oligomers and hardly disturb the construction of COFs. After reduction, metal NPs are uniformly anchored on the COF matrix. Eventually, a wide spectrum of metal NPs, including Au, Pd, Pt, AuPd, CuPd, CuPt and CuPdPt, loaded COFs are successfully prepared. The versatility and metal ions anchoring mechanism are verified with four different COF matrixes. Taking AuPd NPs as example, the resultant AuPd NPs loaded COF materials can selectively decompose ammonium formate and produce hydrogen in&#8208;situ, exhibiting over 99% conversion of hydrodechlorination for chlorobenzenes and nitro&#8208;reduction reaction for nitroaromatic compounds under ambient temperature in aqueous solution.</dc:description>

         <title>Recent research progresses of Sn/Bi/In&#8208;based electrocatalysts for electroreduction CO2 to formate</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Abstract: Carbon dioxide electroreduction reaction (CO2RR) can take full advantage of sustainable power to mitigate the ever&#8208;increasing global carbon emission. Recycling CO2 to produce formic acid or formate is a technologically and economically viable approach to accomplish electrochemical CO2 cyclic utilization. Developing efficient and cost&#8208;effective electrocatalysts with high selectivity towards formate is prioritized for the industrialized applications of CO2RR electrolysis. From the previous explored CO2RR catalysts,&#160;Sn, Bi and In based materials have drawn increasing attentions due to the high selectivity towards formate.&#160;However, there are still confronted with several challenges for the practical applications of these materials. Therefore, a rational design of the catalysts for formate is urgently needed for the target of industrialized applications. Herein, we comprehensively summarized the recent development in the advanced electrocatalysts for the CO2RR to formate. Firstly, the reaction mechanism of CO2RR is introduced. Then the preparation and design strategies of the highly active electrocatalysts are presented. Especially the innovative design mechanism in engineering materials for promoting catalytic performance, and the efforts on mechanistic exploration using in situ (ex situ) characterization techniques are reviewed. Subsequently, some perspectives and expectations are proposed about current challenges and future potentials in CO2RR research.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Bench&#8208;stable Polycyclic Organophosphorus Heterocycles via Staudinger&#8208;type Annulations of ortho&#8208;Azidophenols</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The formation of a five&#8208; or six&#8208;membered ring is known to stabilize unstable molecular structures such as hemiacetals. This idea can also be extended to stabilize other high&#8208;coordinated p&#8208;block element species. Herein, we synthesized two novel polycyclic organophosphorus heterocycles via Staudinger&#8208;type annulations. Reactions of either ortho&#8208;phosphinoarenesulfonyl fluorides 1 or ortho&#8208;phosphinobenzoic acid methyl esters 4 with ortho&#8208;azidophenols 2 gave rise to penta&#8208;coordinated P(V) heterocycles, benzo&#8208;benzo&#8208;1,2,3&#8208;thiazaphospholo&#8208;1,3,2&#8208;oxazaphosphole (B&#8208;B&#8208;TAP&#8208;OAP) 3 and benzo&#8208;benzo&#8208;1,2&#8208;azaphospholo&#8208;1,3,2&#8208;oxazaphosphol&#8208;12&#8208;one (B&#8208;B&#8208;AP&#8208;OAP) 5 in satisfactory yields. It is remarkable that heterocycles 3 and 5 are both bench&#8208;stable and exhibit considerable stability in a 10% aqueous tetrahydrofuran solution. Preliminary computational studies disclosed that the formation of nitrogen gas is the key driving force for the annulations. In addition, the formation of a strong Si&#8208;F bond is another contributor to the annulation of 1 and 2.</dc:description>

         <title>Research Progress in Liquid Phase Growth of GaN Crystals</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>As a wide band gap semiconductor, gallium nitride (GaN) has excellent structural stability and mechanical properties, giving it unique advantages in applications such as high frequency, high power, and high temperature. As a result, it has broad application prospects in optoelectronics and microelectronics. However, the lack of high&#8208;quality, large&#8208;size GaN crystal substrates severely limit the improvement of electronic device performance. To solve this problem, liquid phase growth of GaN has attracted much attention because it can produce higher quality GaN crystals compared to traditional vapor phase growth methods. This review introduces two main methods of liquid phase growth of GaN: the flux method and ammonothermal method, as well as their advantages and challenges.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;As a wide band gap semiconductor, gallium nitride (GaN) has excellent structural stability and mechanical properties, giving it unique advantages in applications such as high frequency, high power, and high temperature. As a result, it has broad application prospects in optoelectronics and microelectronics. However, the lack of high-quality, large-size GaN crystal substrates severely limit the improvement of electronic device performance. To solve this problem, liquid phase growth of GaN has attracted much attention because it can produce higher quality GaN crystals compared to traditional vapor phase growth methods.

         <title>Chemo&#8208; and Regioselective Catalytic Cross&#8208;Coupling Reaction of Ketones for the Synthesis of &#946;, &#947;&#8208;Disubstituted &#946;, &#947;&#8208;Unsaturated Ketones</title>

         <dc:description>C&#8208;C bond forming reaction of ketone with aldehyde is well&#8208;studied for the synthesis of &#945;, &#946;&#8208;unsaturated ketones, however, the reaction with two different ketones to unsaturated carbonyl compound has not yet been systematically studied. Probably due to the relatively low reactivity of ketones as electrophiles (aldol acceptors), its propensity for retro&#8208;aldol reaction. The reactions often suffer from unsatisfactory chemoselectivity. In this quest, we report here for the first time selective cross&#8208;coupling reaction of ketones to &#946;&#8208;branched &#946;, &#947;&#8208;unsaturated ketones by using ruthenium catalysis. Interestingly, single crossed aldol condensation products are formed even in reactions where a mixture of products is possible. Reaction is highly chemoselective, regioselective and produces H2O as the only byproducts. Method is compatible with a wide variety of sensitive functional group and applicable for even problematic aliphatic ketones as substrates. Notably, acetone was found as a three&#8208;carbon feedstock for the syntheses of simple &#946;, &#947;&#8208;unsaturated ketones. The process can further be extended to the late&#8208;stage functionalization of natural products. With the help of DFT calculations, and several control experiments, the mechanistic finding demonstrated that initial aldol&#8208;condensation of ketones to &#945;, &#946;&#8208;unsaturated ketone, which further isomerizes to a &#946;, &#947;&#8208; unsaturated ketone via &#951;3&#8208;allyl ruthenium complex.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhanced adhesive and mechanically robust silicone&#8208;based coating with excellent marine anti&#8208;fouling and anti&#8208;corrosion performances</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) is widely used in marine antifouling coatings due to its low surface energy property. However, certain drawbacks of PDMS coatings such as poor surface adhesion, weak mechanical properties, and inadequate static antifouling performance have hindered its practical applications. Herein, condensation polymerization is utilized to prepare PDMS&#8208;based polythiamine ester (PTUBAF) coatings that consist of PDMS, polytetrahydrofuran (PTMG), 2, 3, 5, 6&#8208;tetrafluoro&#8208;1, 4&#8208;benzenedimethanol (TBD) as the main chains and isobornyl acrylate(IBA) as the antifouling group. The surface adhesion to the substrate is enhanced due to the hydrogen bond between the coated carbamate group and the hydroxyl group on the surface of the substrate. Mechanical properties of PTUBAF are significantly improved due to the benzene ring and six&#8208;membered ring biphase hard structure.&#160; The strong synergistic effect of bactericidal&#160;groups and low surdace energy endows the PTUBAF coating with outstanding antifouling performance.&#160;Due to the low surface energy surface, the PTUBAF coatings are also found to possess excellent anti&#8208;corrosion. Furthermore, since the PTUBAF coatings exhibit a visible light transmittance of 91%, they can applied as protective films for smartphones. The proposed method has the potential to boost the production and practical applications of silicone&#8208;based coatings.</dc:description>

         <title>Stacked Covalent Organic Ribbons&#160;Perpendicular to Graphene Oxide Sheets;&#160;a 1D&#8208;p&#8208;2D Design for Photocatalytic Tandem Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Development of one dimensional covalent organic frameworks (1D&#8208;COFs) with potential in light absorption and catalysis is still challenging, due to their rapid interpenetration to form 2D and 3D porous structures. Here we report a successful synthesis of imine&#8208;linked 1D covalent organic ribbons (COR), using two simple linear building blocks 1,4&#8208;Benzenediamine (Bda) and [2,2'&#8208;Bipyridine]&#8208;5,5'&#8208;dicarbaldehyde (Bpy). The obtained 1D structure with nanorod morphology could keep its physicochemical characteristic properties when it is perpendicularitated on the surface of graphene oxide (GO) sheets (1D&#8208;p&#8208;2D structure). Due to an AB &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking and efficient charge transfer between perpendicular 1D COR and GO sheets, the obtained nanocomposite showed strong visible light absorbance (400&#8208;700 nm) with coefficient of 4.400 M&#8208;1cm&#8208;1 and decreased recombination rate of photogenerated reactive species by 92%. The strategy of 1D&#8208;p&#8208;2D light driven system greatly enhanced the photocatalytic activity in practical applications such as both oxidation and hydrogenation tandem reactions to a rate constant of higher than 0.02 min&#8208;1. This study presents the first case of 1D covalent organic polymers grown perpendicularly on a carbon&#8208;based layer for boosting electron mobility through the junction between the two components.</dc:description>

         <title>Crystal, Solution, and Computational Study of the Structure of Ortho&#8208;Lithium N,N&#8208;Diisopropyl&#8208;P,P&#8208;Diphenylphosphinothioic Amide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The first crystal structure of an ortho&#8208;lithium phosphinothioic amide complexed with tetramethylethylenediamine 12 is reported. The complex consists of a spirane in which the spirolithium is N,N&#8208; and C,S&#8208;chelated by the diamine and organophosphorus ligands, respectively. The analogous ortho anion 14 obtained by Sn(IV)/Li transmetallation in THF has also been synthesized. Nuclear magnetic resonance study of both anions showed that they exist as monomers in solution and are involved in dynamic processes including the restricted rotation around the P&#8210;N bond. 14 is converted at room temperature by nucleophilic cyclization to the dearomatized anion 15, which evolves after a few hours to the benzophosphindole sulfide 16. Density functional theory calculations supported the aggregation state in solution and were used to explore the conformational space of anion 12, the mechanism of ortholithiation directed by P(X)&#8208;N (X = O, S) groups, and the mechanism of formation of 15.</dc:description>

         <title>Water&#8208;soluble triazolium covalent cages for ATP sensing</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Water&#8208;soluble organic cages are attractive targets for their molecular recognition and sensing features of biologically relevant molecules. Here, we have successfully designed and synthesized a pair of water&#8208;soluble cationic cages employing click reaction as the fundamental step followed by the N&#8208;methylation of the triazole rings. The rigid and shape&#8208;persistent 3D hydrophobic cavity, positively charged surface, H&#8208;bonding triazolium rings, and excellent water solubility empower both cages to exhibit a superior affinity and selectivity for binding with adenosine&#8208;5&#8217;&#8208;triphosphate (ATP) compared to cyclophanes and other macrocyclic receptors. Both cage molecules (PCC&#183;Cl and BCC&#183;Cl) can bind a highly emissive dye HPTS (8&#8208;hydroxypyrene&#8208;1,3,6&#8208;trisulfonic acid trisodium salt) to form non&#8208;fluorescent complexes. The addition of ATP resulted in the stronger cage&#204;ATP complexes with the retention of HPTS emission upon its displacement. The resultant indicator&#8208;displacement assay system can efficiently sense and quantify ATP in nanomolar detection limits in buffer solutions and human serum matrix. Spectroscopic and theoretical studies revealed the synergistic effect of &#960;&#215;&#215;&#215;&#960; stacking interaction between the aromatic moiety of the cationic cages and the adenine moiety of ATP, as well as the electrostatic and hydrogen bonding interaction between the phosphate anion of ATP and triazole protons of cages, played the pivotal roles in the sensing process.</dc:description>

         <title>Mn(III) O^N^O Complexes as Water&#8208;tolerant and Environmentally Benign Catalysts for Polyurethane Foam Synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polyurethanes are synthesized on industrial scale by the reaction of diisocyanates with diols in the presence of catalysts which are commonly based on tin complexes and amines. However, due to the toxicity and volatility of these tin catalysts and amines, there is the need to develop new catalysts that are more environmentally benign. Herein, we report the synthesis of O^N^O pincer&#8208;ligated Mn(III) and Fe(III) complexes that serve as suitable catalysts for urethane formation and are stable to hydrolysis as predicted by computations and observed experimentally. The O^N^O pincer scaffold is vital to the activity of these catalysts, simultaneously ensuring increased solubility in the reaction medium as well as providing a stable framework upon dissociation of co&#8208;ligands in the catalytic cycle. In silico mechanistic investigations for urethane formation show that the stabilization of active species in square&#8208;planar geometries enabled by these O^N^O ligands permit simultaneous coordination of alcohol and isocyanate in suitable configuration at the metal center.</dc:description>

         <title>Unexpected Low Temperature Activity with Low N2O Emission of Stabilized Al&#8208;rich Zeolite Beta for Selective Catalytic Reduction of NOx</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
With the use of liquid&#8208;mediated stabilization treatment, Fe&#8208;containing beta zeolite catalysts show improved NOx conversions at low temperature regions and better hydrothermal stability while maintaining high selectivity due to the reorganization of Al framework. (FB: Fe&#8208;beta, &#8208;st: stabilized sample).







Abstract
The low temperature activity of Fe&#8208;loaded zeolites as selective catalytic reduction of NOx by NH3 (NH3&#8208;SCR) catalysts is a critical drawback for practical application. Here, we found unexpected improvement of low temperature activity by our proposed post&#8208;synthetic treatment. An Al&#8208;rich zeolite beta (Si/Al=5) is employed as the catalyst support, and the parent sample is dealuminated for higher hydrothermal stability, followed by the liquid&#8208;mediated stabilization treatment and impregnation. It is found that stabilized samples feature excellent low temperature activity and high N2 selectivity even for a long&#8208;term operation, along with the ability to maintain high NOx conversion after aging. The improved SCR activity should be attributed to abundant acid sites in Al&#8208;rich framework and better stabilization of monomeric iron species after the stabilization treatment. Furthermore, the low yield of side product N2O is probably due to the absence of the generation of NH4NO3 during NH3&#8208;SCR catalyzed by Fe&#8208;loaded zeolites.

         <title>Aromatic C(sp2)&#8722;H Functionalization by Consecutive Paired Electrolysis: Dibromination of Aryl Amines with Dibromoethane at Room Temperature</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient one&#8208;pot bromination protocol for aryl amines has been developed under metal and external oxidant&#8208;free conditions employing constant current electrolysis at room temperature. The developed methodology uses electrically generated bromine from dibromoethane and carried out regioselective bromination of a wide range of aryl amines without the help of any additional activator.







Abstract
Herein, we disclose a facile and efficient electrochemical method for the dibromination of aryl amines by double functionalization of aromatic C(sp2)&#8722;H (both para and ortho) under metal&#8208; and external oxidant&#8208;free conditions at room temperature for the first time. The reaction is demonstrated using 1,2&#8208;dibromoethane to dibrominate a wide range of N&#8208;substituted aryl amines in a simple setup with C(+)/Pt(&#8722;) electrodes under mild reaction conditions. This transformation proceeds smoothly with a broad substrate scope affording the valuable and versatile N&#8208;substituted 2,4&#8208;dibromoanilines in moderate to excellent yields with high regioselectivity. In this paired electrolysis, cathodic reduction of 1,2&#8208;DBE followed by anodic oxidation generates bromonium intermediates, which then couple with anilines to furnish the dibrominated products. It represents a distinctive approach to challenging redox&#8208;neutral reactions. The versatility of the electrochemical ortho&#8208;, para&#8208;dibromination was reflected by unique regioselectivities for challenging aryl amines and gram&#8208;scale electrosynthesis without the use of a stoichiometric oxidant or an activating agent.

         <title>A Proof&#8208;of&#8208;Concept Study on the Theranostic Potential of 177Lu&#8208;labeled Biocompatible Covalent Polymer Nanoparticles for Cancer Targeted Radionuclide Therapy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We proposed to employ covalent polymer nanoparticles (CPNs) as nanocarriers to obtain 177Lu radiolabeled nanoparticles with reliable cancer theranositic functions. The effective tumor targeting and impressive antitumor efficacy of as&#8208;synthesized theranostic agents (177Lu&#8208;DOTA&#8208;PEG&#8208;CPNs) were demonstrated by systematic in&#8197;vitro and in&#8197;vivo anticancer investigations: a) 177Lu&#8208;DOTA&#8208;PEG&#8208;CPNs were equipped with excellent capacity of bonding with breast cancer cells (4T1), inhibiting the cell viability, leading to cell apoptosis, arresting the cell cycle, and upregulating the reactive oxygen species (ROS); b) notable accumulation of 177Lu&#8208;DOTA&#8208;PEG&#8208;CPNs at tumor site in 4T1 tumor bearing model was revealed by SPECT/CT imaging and biodistribution; c) 50&#8201;% of mice intratumorally injected with 177Lu&#8208;DOTA&#8208;PEG&#8208;CPNs was cured and showed no tumor recurrence within 3&#8197;months.







Abstract
Theranostic nanomedicine combined bioimaging and therapy probably rises more helpful and interesting opportunities for personalized medicine. In this work, 177Lu radiolabeling and surface PEGylation of biocompatible covalent polymer nanoparticles (CPNs) have generated a new theranostic nanoformulation (177Lu&#8208;DOTA&#8208;PEG&#8208;CPNs) for targeted diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer. The in&#8197;vitro anticancer investigations demonstrate that 177Lu&#8208;DOTA&#8208;PEG&#8208;CPNs possess excellent bonding capacity with breast cancer cells (4T1), inhibiting the cell viability, leading to cell apoptosis, arresting the cell cycle, and upregulating the reactive oxygen species (ROS), which can be attributed to the good targeting ability of the nanocarrier and the strong relative biological effect of the radionuclide labelled compound. Single photon emission computed tomography/ computed tomography (SPECT/CT) imaging and in&#8197;vivo biodistribution based on 177Lu&#8208;DOTA&#8208;PEG&#8208;CPNs reveal that notable radioactivity accumulation at tumor site in murine 4T1 models with both intravenous and intratumoral administration of the prepared radiotracer. Significant tumor inhibition has been observed in mice treated with 177Lu&#8208;DOTA&#8208;PEG&#8208;CPNs, of which the median survival was highly extended. More strikingly, 50&#8201;% of mice intratumorally injected with 177Lu&#8208;DOTA&#8208;PEG&#8208;CPNs was cured and showed no tumor recurrence within 90&#8197;days. The outcome of this work can provide new hints for traditional nanomedicines and promote clinical translation of 177Lu radiolabeled compounds efficiently.

         <title>Anode Reaction Control for a Single&#8208;Compartment Electrochemical CO2 Reduction Reactor with a Surface&#8208;Activated Diamond Cathode</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We demonstrated anode reaction control for a membrane&#8208;free single&#8208;compartment carbon dioxide reduction (CO2R) flow reactor with a boron&#8208;doped diamond (BDD) electrode. Fluorinated polymer coatings over an IrO2 electrode improved the selectivity of anode reactions. The use of a halogen free electrolyte and the activation of BDD cathode improved the CO2R reaction selectivity and achieved a Faradaic efficiency of formic acid of over 70&#8201;%.







Abstract
The electrochemical reaction of carbon dioxide (CO2) in aqueous electrolyte solutions is attracting increasing attention for sustainable chemical production. Boron&#8208;doped diamond (BDD) electrodes have been previously shown to be very effective for the stable electrochemical production of formic acid from CO2. Typically, the electrochemical production of formic acid by CO2 reduction (CO2R) reaction is performed with a dual&#8208;compartment flow reactor equipped with a membrane separator. The problems caused by the membrane separator, such as scaling&#8208;up, complicated operational control and materials costs can be solved using a membrane free single&#8208;compartment reactor. Here we demonstrate anode reaction control for a single&#8208;compartment CO2R flow reactor using a surface&#8208;activated BDD cathode and achieve a Faradaic efficiency for formic acid production of over 70&#8201;%.

Typically, the electrochemical production of formic acid by CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;R) reaction is performed with a dual-compartment flow reactor equipped with a membrane separator. The problems caused by the membrane separator, such as scaling-up, complicated operational control and materials costs can be solved using a membrane free single-compartment reactor. Here we demonstrate anode reaction control for a single-compartment CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;R flow reactor using a surface-activated BDD cathode and achieve a Faradaic efficiency for formic acid production of over 70&#8201;%.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Neutral Chromium Complex with a Cr&#8801;Si Triple Bond: Synthesis and Photoinduced H&#8722;H and Benzene C&#8722;H Bond Activation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Neutral silylyne complex with a Cr&#8801;Si bond was synthesized via dehydrogenation from a silylene complex with (H)Cr=Si(H) moiety. Its monomeric structure was revealed by XRD and DFT calculations. Irradiation of the chromium complex with H2 using LED light let to H2 activation to reproduce the (H)Cr=Si(H) complex. The chromium complex performed benzene C&#8722;H bond activation across the Cr&#8801;Si bond to afford 1,2&#8208;C&#8722;H addition product under irradiation.







Abstract
A neutral silylyne complex with a Cr&#8801;Si triple bond was prepared by dehydrogenation of a chromium silylene complex with Cr&#8722;H and Si&#8722;H bonds, and was isolated as monomeric crystals, unlike dimeric forms of its tungsten and molybdenum congeners. The strong Cr(&#948;&#8722;)&#8722;Si(&#948;+) bond polarity was revealed by the reaction with MeOH and DFT calculations. The chromium silylyne complex reacted with H2 under LED (365&#8197;nm) irradiation to reproduce the precursor silylene complex with a (H)Cr=Si(H) moiety, as a result of 1,2&#8208;H&#8722;H addition across the Cr&#8801;Si triple bond. Similarly, the chromium silylyne complex reacted with benzene under irradiation to afford an 1,2&#8208;addition product with a (H)Cr=Si(Ph) moiety, via benzene C&#8722;H bond activation accompanied by Si&#8722;C bond forming.

         <title>Scaffold Editing of Cubanes into Homocubanes, Homocuneanes via Cuneanes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
When benzoyl triflate was used as a catalyst on acyloxymethylcubane, a ring expansion of one carbon atom proceeded, resulting in the efficient production of acyloxymethylhomocubane. Additionally, we observed that the isomerization of 1,4&#8208;diacyloxymethylcubane resulted in the generation of both D2&#8208; and C2&#8208;symmetrical bishomocubanes. Similarly, 2&#8208;acyloxymethylcuneane can also be converted into acyloxycuneane. This approach, which involves the direct synthesis of homocubanol and homocuneanol esters, is promising as a novel method for the synthesis of phenoxy bioisosteres.







Abstract
The selective synthesis of cage&#8208;type hydrocarbons through the editing of the highly symmetric molecule cubane can be anticipated as one of the efficient approaches. In this paper, we identify a catalyst that facilitates the efficient scaffold isomerization of cubanes into homocubanes. This approach, which involves the direct synthesis of homocubanol esters, is promising as a novel method for the synthesis of phenoxy bioisosteres. Additionally, we observed that the isomerization of 1,4&#8208;bis(acyloxymethl)cubane results in the generation of both D2&#8208; and C2&#8208;symmetrical bishomocubanes. The same catalyst was also applied to the isomerization of acyloxymethylcuneanes, producing homocuneanol esters.

         <title>Annulation of a Methylenecyclopropane with Cyanoalkenes Catalyzed by Lewis Bases</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rare intermolecular annulation of donor&#8211;acceptor cyclopropanes with alkenes has been developed by using a methylenecyclopropane (MCP) and acyl cyanoalkenes to give dihydrofurans or furans. The dihydrofurans were synthesized in the presence of a catalytic amount of the base and were readily converted to the furans by using a stoichiometric amount of the base. A 1H&#8197;NMR study revealed that the ring&#8208;opened MCP reacts with the alkenes.







Abstract
The annulation of a methylenecyclopropane with acyl cyanoalkenes by using DABCO or quinuclidine as a catalyst to give 2,3&#8208;dihydofurans has been developed. A stoichiometric amount of the Lewis bases promoted the isomerization of 2,3&#8208;dihydrofurans to furans. 1H&#8197;NMR spectra of the reaction in&#8197;situ revealed that the methylenecyclopropane is opened by the Lewis base to form a reaction intermediate that is added to the cyanoalkenes.

         <title>Juggling Optoelectronics and Catalysis: The Dual Talents of Bench Stable 1,4&#8208;Azaborinines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bench stable 1,4&#8208;azaborinine PAHs with an anthracene or ladder&#8208;type pentacene scaffold have been prepared, characterised and proven to be efficient catalysts for hydroboration of carbonyls and imines.







Abstract
Boron&#8208; and nitrogen&#8208;doped polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (B&#8208;PAHs) have established a strong foothold in the realm of organic electronics. However, their catalytic potential remains largely untapped. In this study, we synthesise and characterise two bench stable B,N&#8208;doped PAH derivatives based on a 1,4&#8208;azaborinine motif. Most importantly, the anthracene derived structure is an efficient catalyst in the reduction of various carbonyls and imines. These results underscore the potential of B,N&#8208;PAHs in catalytic transformations, setting the stage for deeper exploration in this chemical space.

         <title>Conformer aggregates exhibit dual wavelength emissions on chiral binaphthyl&#8208;based triphenylethylenes and acetone detection</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chiral binaphthyl&#8208;based triphenylethylene derivatives were synthesized, characterized by the distorted structures with local conjugation&#8208;induced rigidity, thus allowing excellent dual state emission. Upon aggregation, two stable conformers were generated, likely resulting in the dual wavelength emission peaks. Furthermore, acetone detection could be achieved in both aqueous and organic phases.







Abstract
The study on structure&#8208;property relationship has been a significant focus in the field of organic molecular luminescence. In the present work, three chiral binaphthyl&#8208;based triphenylethylene (HTPE) derivatives were prepared through condensation reactions. Despite their similar structures, these compounds exhibited distinct luminescent properties. Diphenylmethane&#8208;derived HTPE displayed dual&#8208;state emissions, characterized by dual&#8208;wavelength emissions which were insensitive to the polarity of solvents. The dual emissions in solution state could be attributed to the different locally excited (LE) excitons. However, upon aggregation, two stable conformers were generated, probably leading to different emission peaks. In contrast, dibenzocycloheptadiene&#8208;derived HTPE aggregates showed only a single emission peak. Surprisingly, fluorene&#8208;derived HTPE exhibited obvious luminescence in neither solution nor aggregate states due to inherent &#960;&#8208;&#960; interactions. These conclusions were substantiated by X&#8208;ray analysis, spectroscopic analysis, and theory calculations. Application studies demonstrated that fluorescence on/off switches could be achieved through exposure to acetone. More importantly, trace amounts of acetone could be detected using luminescent materials in both organic and aqueous phases with a detection limit of 0.08&#8201;%. Thus, this work not only presents a strategy for designing chiral triphenylethylene fluorophores but also provides valuable information for dual wavelength emissions resulting from two stable conformations.

         <title>Post&#8208;device Dimethylamine Treatment Enables Stable and Efficient Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dimethylamine (DMA) is introduced as a post&#8208;treatment vapor to modify perovskite solar cells by a controlled low&#8208;dimensional perovskite formation process, thus reduce interface defects, hinder ion migration, provide a protective layer to inhibit invasion of water, suppress the escape of volatile ingredients. This DMA post&#8208;treatment enables the enhancement of both efficiency and stability of devices.







Abstract
The incorporation of organic ligands via post&#8208;device treatment is an effective strategy to improve the stability of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Although the active area is protected by metal electrode under post&#8208;treatment, the aggression of post&#8208;treatment ligands into active area cannot be avoided thoroughly. Unfortunately, the size of long&#8208;chain amines is too large, and the three&#8208;dimensional (3D) perovskite cannot maintain its 3D perovskite structure once the cation substitution occurs during the post&#8208;treatment. Despite that the low&#8208;dimensional (LD) perovskites are beneficial to stability, long&#8208;chain amines are harmful to carrier transport in PSCs. Here, we introduce dimethylamine (DMA), a slightly oversized cation that can be doped into 3D perovskite structure, for post&#8208;device treatment to improve the efficiency and stability of PSCs. After exposure to DMA gas, the inactive area of Cs/FA/MA mixed cation perovskite device that is not covered by metal electrode is converted into LD perovskite, passivating the defects of 3D perovskite in the active region, suppressing non&#8208;radiation recombination and ion migration. As a result, we achieved a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 22.29&#8201;% with negligible hysteresis and better stability after DMA post&#8208;treatment, which is much higher than that (20.40&#8201;%) of the control device.

         <title>"Buttressing Effect" in the Halogen&#8208;Lithium Exchange&#160;in ortho&#8208;Bromo&#8208;N,N&#8208;dimethylanilines and Related Naphthalenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Non&#8208;covalent interactions such as coordination of an organolithium reagent by a directing group and steric repulsion of substituents strongly affect the halogen&#8208;lithium exchange process. Here we present the manifestation of the &#8220;buttressing effect&#8221; &#8211; an indirect interaction between two substituents issued by the presence of a third group &#8211; and its influence on the ease and selectivity of the bromine&#8208;lithium exchange and the reactivity of formed aryllithiums. The increase of the size of the &#8220;buttressing&#8221; substituent strongly affects the conformation of a NMe2 group, forcing it to hinder ortho&#8208;bromine and thus slowing down the exchange. In naphthalene substrates bearing two bromines, this suppresses regioselectivity of the reaction. The &#8220;buttressing effect&#8221; forces formed aryllithiums to deaggregate, thus boosting their reactivity. This facilitates the decomposition via protolisys by ethereal solvents even at low temperatures and in some cases initiates fast Wurtz&#8208;Fittig coupling.</dc:description>

         <title>Oxidation&#8208;state sensitive light&#8208;induced dynamics of Ruthenium&#8208;4H&#8208;Imidazole complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Oxidized molecular states are key intermediates in photo&#8208;induced redox reactions, e.g., intermolecular charge transfer between photosensitizer and catalyst in photoredox catalysis. The stability and longevity of the oxidized photosensitizer is an important factor in optimizing the respective light&#8208;driven reaction pathways. In this work the oxidized states of Ruthenium(II)&#8208;4H&#8208;imidazole dyes are studied. The Ruthenium complexes constitute benchmark photosensitizers in solar energy interconversion processes with exceptional chemical stability, strong visible light absorption, and favourable redox properties. To rationalize the light&#8208;induced reaction in the oxidized Ruthenium(III) systems, we combine UV&#8208;vis absorption, resonance Raman, and transient absorption spectroelectrochemistry (SEC) with time dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) calculations. Three complexes are compared, which vary with respect to their coordination environment, i.e., combining an 4H&#8208;imidazole with either 2,2&#8217;&#8208;bipyridine (bpy) or 2,2';6'2"&#8208;terpyridine (tpy) coligands, and chloride or isothiocyanate ligands. While all oxidized complexes have similar steady state absorption properties, their excited state kinetics differ significantly; the study thus opens the doorway to study the light&#8208;driven reactivity of oxidized molecular intermediates in intermolecular charge transfer cascades.</dc:description>

         <title>Characterization of the Ligand Properties of Donor stabilized Pnictogenyltrielanes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A general synthesis and the characterization of novel alkyl&#8208;substituted NHC&#8208;stabilized pnictogenylboranes NHC &#183; BH2ER2 (NHC = N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene, E = P, As; R2 = Me2, Ph2,tBuH, Cy2, (SiMe3)2) are reported. These compounds were reacted with Ni(CO)4 to the corresponding complexes of the type [(NHC &#183; BH2ER2)Ni(CO)3] to determine their donor strength by Tolman Electronic Parameters (TEPs) and their steric demand as ligands compared to classical phosphines, superbasic phosphines and other commonly applied donor systems. The results show that the NHC&#8208;stabilized pnictogenyltrielanes can be considered as being highly basic, while their steric influence depends strongly on the organic residues as well as the donor attached to the {BH2} moiety. Although weaker than commonly used superbasic phosphines, the donor strength of pnictogenyltrielanes in general can be classified as of similar strength as NHCs. The steric and electronic properties can easily be modified by alkyl substitution as evident from the TEP trends.</dc:description>

         <title>Colloidal ruthenium catalysts for selective quinaldine hydrogenation: Ligand and solvent effects</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Colloidal Ru nanoparticles (NP) display interesting catalytic properties for the hydrogenation of (hetero)arenes as they proceed efficiently in mild reaction conditions. In this work, a series of Ru based materials was used in order to selectively hydrogenate quinaldine and assess the impact of the stabilizing agent on their catalytic performances. Ru nanoparticles stabilized with polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) and 1&#8208;adamantanecarboxylic acid (AdCOOH) allowed to obtain 6,7,8&#8208;tetrahydroquinaldine with a remarkable selectivity in mild reaction conditions by choosing the suitable solvent. The presence of a carboxylate ligand on the surface of the Ru NP led to an increase in the activity when compared to Ru/PVP catalyst. The stabilizing agent had also an impact on the selectivity, as carboxylate ligand modified catalysts promoted the selectivity towards 1,2,3,4&#8208;tetrahydroquinaldine, with bulky carboxylate displaying the highest ones.</dc:description>

         <title>Cerium oxide catalyzed disproportionation of hydrogen peroxide: a closer look at the reaction intermediate</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cerium oxide nanoparticles (CNPs) have recently gained increasing interest as redox enzyme&#8208;mimetics to scavenge the intracellular excess of reactive oxygen species, including hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). Despite the extensive exploration, there remains a notable discrepancy regarding the interpretation of observed redshift of UV&#8208;Visible spectroscopy due to H2O2 addition and the catalase&#8208;mimicking mechanism of CNPs. To address this question, we investigated the reaction mechanism by taking a closer look at the reaction intermediate during the catalase mimicking reaction. In this study, we present evidence demonstrating that in aqueous solutions, H2O2 adsorption at CNP surface triggers the formation of stable intermediates known as cerium&#8208;peroxo (Ce&#8208;O22&#8208;) and/or cerium&#8208;hydroperoxo (Ce&#8208;OOH&#8208;) complexes as resolved by Raman scattering and UV&#8208;Visible spectroscopy. Polymer coating presents steric hinderance for H2O2 accessibility to the solid&#8208;liquid interface limiting further intermediate formation. We demonstrate in depth that the catalytic reactivity of CNPs in the H2O2 disproportionation reaction increases with the Ce(III)&#8208;fraction and decreases in the presence of polymer coatings. The developed approach using UV&#8208;Visible spectroscopy for the characterization of the surface peroxide species can potentially serve as a foundation for determining the catalytic reactivity of CNPs in the disproportionation of H2O2.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrochemical N&#8208;Aroylation of Sulfoximines by Using Benzoyl Hydrazines with H2 Generation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Developed here is an electrochemical cross&#8208;coupling between aroyl hydrazine and NH&#8208;sulfoximine with the evolution of N2 and H2 as innocuous by&#8208;products, which can be utilized as a clean energy source. This approach features mild, operational simplicity, and remarkable scope of complex and sensitive pharmaceuticals and natural products.







Abstract
Developed here is a robust electrochemical cross&#8208;coupling reaction between aroyl hydrazine and NH&#8208;sulfoximine via concomitant cleavage and formation of C(sp2)&#8722;N bonds with the evolution of H2 and N2 as innocuous by&#8208;products. This sustainable protocol avoids the use of toxic reagents and occurs at room temperature. The reaction proceeds via the generation of an aroyl and a sulfoximidoyl radical via anodic oxidation under constant current electrolysis (CCE), affording N&#8208;aroylated sulfoximine. The strategy is applied to late&#8208;stage sulfoximidation of L&#8208;menthol, (&#8722;)&#8208;borneol, D&#8208;glucose, vitamin&#8208;E derivatives, and marketed drugs such as probenecid, ibuprofen, flurbiprofen, ciprofibrate, and sulindac. In addition, the present methodology is mild, high functional group tolerance with broad substrate scope and scalable.

         <title>Theoretical Insight into the Special Synergy of Bimetallic Site in Co/MoC Catalyst to Promote N2&#8208;to&#8208;NH3 Conversion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The introduced Co atom does not directly participate in binding with intermediates, but primarily serves as a reservoir of H atoms. DFT results reveal that by maintaining the good activity of N&#8722;N bond cleavage and the stability of intermediates on &#945;&#8208;MoC(0001) surface, the formation of NHx species is promoted by reducing the migration barrier of H atom after introducing Co atom.







Abstract
The catalytic mechanisms of nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) on the pristine and Co/&#945;&#8208;MoC(001) surfaces were explored by density functional theory calculations. The results show that the preferred pathway is that a direct N&#8801;N cleavage occurs first, followed by continuous hydrogenations. The production of second NH3 molecule is identified as the rate&#8208;limiting step on both systems with kinetic barriers of 1.5 and 2.0&#8197;eV, respectively, indicating that N2&#8208;to&#8208;NH3 transformation on bimetallic surface is more likely to occur. The two components of the bimetallic center play different roles during NRR process, in which Co atom does not directly participate in the binding of intermediates, but primarily serves as a reservoir of H atoms. This special synergy makes Co/&#945;&#8208;MoC(001) have superior activity for ammonia synthesis. The introduction of Co not only facilitates N2 dissociation, but also accelerates the migration of H atom due to the antibonding characteristic of Co&#8722;H bond. This study offers a facile strategy for the rational design and development of efficient catalysts for ammonia synthesis and other reactions involving the hydrogenation processes.

         <title>A pseudo&#8208;Double&#8208;Network Hydrogel Built upon Layered Double Hydroxides with Self&#8208;Strengthening Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Layered double hydroxide (LDH) hydrogels, possessing a pseudo&#8208;double&#8208;network, have been constructed on the basis of dynamic covalent bonds, electrostatic interactions and hydrogen bonding. The as&#8208;prepared nanocomposite hydrogels can retain more than 99&#8197;wt.% of water and exhibit a self&#8208;strengthening phenomenon, which originates from the inherent dynamic interactions, after mechanical training.







Abstract
While great achievements have been made in the development of mechanically robust nanocomposite hydrogels, incorporating multiple interactions on the bases of two demensional inorganic cross&#8208;linkers to construct self&#8208;strengthening hydrogels has rarely been investigated. To this end, we propose here a new method for the coupling the dynamic covalent bonds and non&#8208;covalent interactions within a pseudo double&#8208;network system. The pseudo first network, formed through the Schiff Base reation between Tris&#8208;modified layered double hydroxides (Tris&#8722;LDHs) and oxidized dextran (ODex), is linked to the second network built upon non&#8208;covalent interactions between Tris&#8722;LDHs and poly(acrylamide&#8208;co&#8208;2&#8208;acrylamido&#8208;2&#8208;methyl&#8722;propanesulfonate) (p&#8208;(AM&#8208;co&#8208;AMPS). The swelling and mechanical properties of the resulting hydrogels have been investigated as a function of the ODex and AMPS contents. The as&#8208;prepared hydrogel can swell to 420 times of its original size and retain more than 99.9&#8197;wt.% of water. Mechanical tests show that the hydrogel can bear 90&#8201;% of compression and is able to be stretched to near 30 times of its original length. Cyclic tensile tests reveal that the hydrogels are capable of self&#8208;strengthening after mechanical training. The unique energy dissipation mechanism based on the dynamic covalent and non&#8208;covalent interactions is considered to be responsible for the outstanding swelling and mechanical performances.

         <title>Contemporary Applications of Thioamides and Methods for their Synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Substitution of amide bonds with thioamides can have a beneficial influence on the stability of peptides towards proteolysis and affect folding among other effects. In this Review, we highlight the recent developments in the preparation of thioamides and their applications for modification of peptides and natural products as well as new frontiers in the introduction of thioamide functionalities into proteins.







Abstract
Thioamides are naturally occurring isosteres of amide bonds in which the chalcogen atom of the carbonyl is changed from oxygen to sulfur. This substitution gives rise to altered nucleophilicity and hydrogen bonding properties with importance for both chemical reactivity and non&#8208;covalent interactions. As such, thioamides have been introduced into biologically active compounds to achieve improved target affinity and/or stability towards hydrolytic enzymes but have also been applied as probes of protein and peptide folding and dynamics. Recently, a series of new methods have been developed for the synthesis of thioamides as well as their utilization in peptide chemistry. Further, novel strategies for the incorporation of thioamides into proteins have been developed, enabling both structural and functional studies to be performed. In this Review, we highlight the recent developments in the preparation of thioamides and their applications for peptide modification and study of protein function.

         <title>General Construction of Asymmetric Amine Ethers via Efficient Transesterification</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of asymmetric amine ethers proceeds via efficient transesterification. Two tertiary amine alcohol hydrogen sulfates are prepared in high yields and applied as intermediates of transesterification to synthesize asymmetric amine ethers, which has significant advantages over the conventional process.







Abstract
A novel method to prepare asymmetric amine ethers is reported. Tertiary amine alcohol hydrogen sulfate intermediates are prepared through a reactive distillation process, followed by the transesterification process to afford eventually asymmetric amine ethers. Experiments and DFT calculations revealed the essential roles the sulfate group plays in the highly selective monoesterification process. This clean method is tolerant towards various functional groups with good yields under mild condition, which is obviously superior compared to the conventional processes.

         <title>Study on the epoxidation of chain olefins using biquaternary ammonium phosphotungstic acid phase transfer catalysts under no&#8208;solvent condition</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel phase transfer catalyst comprising phosphotungstic acid and biquaternary ammonium cation salt is synthesized for the epoxidation of long carbon chain olefins under solvent&#8208;free conditions, which exhibits high selectivity for epoxides. Different methods are used to characterize the fundamental structure and catalytic mechanism of this catalyst.







Abstract
In this study, we have developed a novel catalyst synthesized by phosphotungstic acid and a gemini quaternary ammonium cation salt. This quaternary ammonium salt not only reduces the interfacial tension between olefins and hydrogen peroxide but also forms a notably stable structure with phosphotungstic acid. Dodecene was successfully epoxidized to epoxy dodecane with a selectivity of 82.9&#8201;%. The impact of initial conditions was systematically investigated such as molar ratio, temperature, reaction time, and catalyst dosage on the catalytic performance. Characterization of the catalyst morphology was performed by SEM, TEM and SAXS. Raman spectra, FT&#8208;IR and XPS spectra were employed to perform the catalyst transformation during the epoxidation reaction. This catalytic mechanism study could provide the industrial application in the epoxidation of long&#8208;chain olefins.

         <title>Dynamic Covalent Bonds in the Ebselen Class of Antioxidants&#160;Probed by X&#8208;ray Quantum Crystallography</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dynamic bonds are essential structural ingredients of dynamic covalent chemistry that involve reversible cleavage and formation of bonds. Herein, we explore the electronic characteristics of Se&#8722;N bonds in the organo&#8208;selenium antioxidant ebselen and its derivatives for their propensity to function as dynamic covalent bonds by employing high&#8208;resolution X&#8208;ray quantum crystallography and complementary computational studies. An analysis of the experimentally reconstructed X&#8208;ray wavefunctions reveals the salient electronic features of the Se&#8722;N bonds with very low electron density localized at the bonding region and a positive Laplacian value at the bond critical point. Bond orders and percentage covalency and ionicity estimated from the X&#8208;ray wavefunctions, along with localized orbital locator (LOL) and electron localization function (ELF) analyses show that the Se&#8722;N bond is unique in its closed shell&#8208;like features, despite being a covalent bond. Time&#8208;dependent DFT calculations simulate the cleavage of Se&#8722;N bonds in ebselen in the excited state, further substantiating their nature as dynamic bonds.</dc:description>

         <title>Chiral NHC Ligands for Enantioselective Gold(I) Catalysis Under Aerobic Conditions: the Importance of Conformational Flexibility and Steric Hindrance of NHC Ligand on Reactivity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Gold(I) catalysis has been recognized as a valuable tool for the unique transformation of multiple carbon&#8208;carbon bonds. Enantioselective &#960;&#8208;catalysis based on gold(I) complexes is, however, still underdeveloped due to lack of privileged ligands. Herein, we present an accessible method to a new family of stable yet catalytically active chiral NHC&#8208;Au(I)&#8208;Cl complexes. The key to preserving a simultaneous fine balance between reactivity and stability in this newly developed family appears to be sterically hindered, but conformationally flexible NHC ligands. These could be easily accessed on a multigram scale by merging sterically hindered anilines with commercially available amino alcohols and amines via a four&#8208;steps synthetic sequence without the need for chromatographic purification. Further investigations of the catalytic activity of NHC&#8208;Au&#8208;Cl complexes identified the OH functionality incorporated into the NHC core as crucial for the level of enantioselectivity as well as the TsO&#8208; anion responsible for the activation of NHC&#8208;Au(I)&#8208;Cl. Finally, NMR studies and X&#8208;ray investigations revealed for the first time that the widely accepted ion metathesis (NHC&#8208;Au&#8208;Cl to NHC&#8208;Au&#8208;OSO2R) responsible for the activation of NHC&#8208;Au&#8208;Cl complexes does not take place (or it is very slow) in commonly used MeNO2 in contrast to DCM.</dc:description>

         <title>Template Assisted Formation of 32 and 34&#960; Octaphyrins Embedded with Dithienopyrrole Cores: A New Scaffold to Unravel Proton Coupled Redox Switching and (Anti)Aromaticity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we report two distinct octaphyrins obtained by the condensation of new dithieno[3,2&#8208;b:2',3'&#8208;d]pyrrole based tetrapyrrane under two different acidic conditions. Fourfold meso&#8208;substituted octaphyrin was the major product when the reaction was performed in the presence of an aryl aldehyde using trifluoroacetic acid. Whereas, the sixfold meso&#8208;substituted octaphyrin was obtained when the precursor was condensed with pentafluorobenzaldehyde using para&#8208;toluenesulfonic acid. Such a template effect of aryl aldehydes in oxidative coupling reactions is realized for the first time in literature. Experimental and theoretical studies suggested that the oxidized form of fourfold meso&#8208;substituted octaphyrin is 32p antiaromatic and undergoes proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET) to the protonated form of 34p aromatic congener upon treatment with protic acids. Furthermore, small organic molecules such as alcohols and amines were also found to promote chemical reduction. Single crystal X&#8208;ray structure revealed that the aromatic counterpart is highly planar and stabilized by several intermolecular H&#8208;bonding and F&#8208;F interactions, leading to a large 3D supramolecular arrangement and exhibited colorimetric sensing for fluoride and hydroxide anions. On the other hand, sixfold meso&#8208;substituted octaphyrin did not show (anti)aromatic features, PCET or anion sensing, but its intriguing absorption features associated with protonation could make it an ideal candidate for pH&#8208;dependent bioimaging.</dc:description>

         <title>Stepwise Functionalization of a Pillar[5]arene&#8208;Containing [2]Rotaxane with Pentafluorophenyl Ester Stoppers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>

The pillar[5]arene as a protecting group. Selective mono&#8208;functionalization of a rotaxane building block is very efficient owing to steric effects limiting the access of the nucleophilic reagents to the second reactive carbonyl group. Introduction of a second stopper is then possible to generate dissymmetrical rotaxanes or axles in high yields.







Abstract
Detailed investigations into the stepwise bis&#8208;functionalization of a pillar[5]arene&#8208;containing rotaxane building block have been carried out. Upon a first stopper exchange, the pillar[5]arene moiety of the mono&#8208;acylated product is preferentially located close to its reactive pentafluorophenyl ester stopper, thus limiting the accessibility to the reactive carbonyl group by the nucleophilic reagents. Selective mono&#8208;functionalization is thus very efficient. Introduction of a second stopper is then possible to generate dissymmetrical rotaxanes with different amide stoppers. Moreover, when dethreading is possible upon the second acylation, the pillar[5]arene plays the role of a protecting group allowing the synthesis of dissymmetrical axles that are particularly difficult to prepare under statistical conditions. Finally, detailed conformation analysis of the rotaxanes revealed that the position of the pillar[5]arene moiety on its axle subunit is mainly governed by polar interactions in nonpolar organic solvents, whereas solvophobic effects play a major role in polar solvents.

         <title>A Nickel Anchored Covalent Organic Framework as Unimolecular Metallaphotocatalyst for Visible Light Driver C&#8722;P Bond Coupling Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nickel&#8208;anchored COF (Bpy&#8208;COF&#8208;NiCl2) represents a unimolecular heterogeneous metallaphotocatalysis system, adept at efficient C&#8722;P bond construction. The synthesized photocatalyst demonstrates superior catalytic performance, achieving up to a 95&#8201;% yield. Furthermore, it exhibits a broad substrate scope and tolerance for various functional groups. Notably, this metallaphotocatalytic system has been found to process aryl bromides seamlessly, yielding products previously unreported in similar systems.







Abstract
The urgent need to develop a sustainable and environmentally friendly method for synthesizing organophosphine compounds is underscored by their extensive applications in organic synthesis, coordination chemistry, medicinal chemistry, and photoelectric materials. Metalated covalent organic frameworks (MCOFs), which seamlessly integrate the inherent photo properties of COF with the catalytic capabilities of metal ions, offer an optimal material for efficient transformation of organics sustainably. In this study, we introduce a simple COF with nickel anchorages (Bpy&#8208;COF&#8208;NiCl2) as a unimolecular metallaphotocatalytic system for effective C&#8722;P bond formation. This heterogeneous photocatalyst exhibits superior catalytic performance, achieving yields of up to 95&#8201;%, and demonstrates broad substrate tolerance and functional group reactivity. Notably, the metallaphotocatalytic system has demonstrated the capability to process aryl bromides to produce the desired product, a feat not previously reported. Finally, the production and reusability test at the gram scale attests to its superior practicality for designing future organic cross&#8208;coupling reactions.

The synthesized photocatalyst demonstrates superior catalytic performance, achieving up to a 95&#8201;% yield. Furthermore, it exhibits a broad substrate scope and tolerance for various functional groups. Notably, this metallaphotocatalytic system has been found to process aryl bromides seamlessly, yielding products previously unreported in similar systems.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The urgent need to develop a sustainable and environmentally friendly method for synthesizing organophosphine compounds is underscored by their extensive applications in organic synthesis, coordination chemistry, medicinal chemistry, and photoelectric materials. Metalated covalent organic frameworks (MCOFs), which seamlessly integrate the inherent photo properties of COF with the catalytic capabilities of metal ions, offer an optimal material for efficient transformation of organics sustainably. In this study, we introduce a simple COF with nickel anchorages (Bpy-COF-NiCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) as a unimolecular metallaphotocatalytic system for effective C&#8722;P bond formation. This heterogeneous photocatalyst exhibits superior catalytic performance, achieving yields of up to 95&#8201;%, and demonstrates broad substrate tolerance and functional group reactivity. Notably, the metallaphotocatalytic system has demonstrated the capability to process aryl bromides to produce the desired product, a feat not previously reported. Finally, the production and reusability test at the gram scale attests to its superior practicality for designing future organic cross-coupling reactions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Multielectron Redox Afforded by a Pincer Ligand Promoting Kumada Cross&#8208;Coupling Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nickel&#8208;catalysed sp2&#8208;sp2 cross&#8208;coupling, that involves redox non&#8208;innocence of a NNN pincer ligand backbone is described.







Abstract
The redox&#8208;active nature of a pincer has been exploited to conduct C&#8722;C cross&#8208;coupling reactions under mild conditions. A nickel complex with a NNN pincer was dimeric in the solid state, and the structure displayed a Ni2N2 diamond core. In the dimeric structure, both ligand backbones house an electron, in the iminosemiquinonate form, to keep the metal's oxidation state at +2. In the presence of an aryl Grignard reagent, only 3&#8197;mol&#8201;% loading the nickel complex generates a Kumada cross&#8208;coupled product in good yield from a wide variety of aryl&#8208;X (X= I, Br, Cl) substrates. That the ligand&#8208;based radical remains responsible for promoting such a coupling reaction following a radical pathway is suggested by TEMPO quenching. Furthermore, a radical&#8208;clock experiment along with tracing product distribution unambiguously supported the radical's involvement through the catalytic cycle. A series of thorough mechanistic probation, including computational DFT analysis, disclosed the cooperative action of both redox&#8208;active pincer ligand and the metal centre to drive the reaction.

         <title>Dynamic Configuration on a Chiral&#8208;at&#8208;Rhodium Catalyst Featuring a Flexible Tetradentate Ligand</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first chiral&#8208;at&#8208;metal catalyst with a dynamic configuration has been successfully synthesized and subsequently resolved. Both experimental and DFT studies show that the stereogenic rhodium center preserves its chiral information. Furthermore, the resolved complex provides enantiomeric ratios of up to 99&#8201;:&#8201;1 in the catalytic Friedel&#8208;Crafts alkylation of indoles. These findings highlight its immense potential in asymmetric catalysis.







Abstract
The unique dynamic configuration of an enantioselective chiral&#8208;at&#8208;metal catalyst based on Rh(III) and a non&#8208;chiral tetradentate ligand is described and resolved. At room temperature, the catalyst undergoes a dynamic configuration process leading to the formation of two interconvertible metal&#8208;stereoisomers, remarkably without racemization. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicate that this metal&#8208;isomerization proceeds via a concerted transition state, which features a trigonal bipyramidal geometry stabilized by the tetradentate ligand. Furthermore, the resolved enantiopure complex shows high catalytic enantioinduction in the Friedel&#8208;Crafts reaction, achieving enantiomeric ratios as high as 99&#8201;:&#8201;1.

         <title>Rhodium&#8208;Mediated Dehydrogenation of Hydroboranes and Group 14 Compounds: Base&#8208;Stabilized Silylene and Germylene Complexes vs. Transmetalation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dehydrogenation of primary and secondary silanes and germanes via a metal&#8208;ligand cooperative process affords base&#8208;stabilized silylene and germylene complexes that can serve as synthons of free &#8220;:ER2&#8221; (E=Si, Ge).







Abstract
Monocarbonyl rhodium complex LRh(CO), 1, which is stabilized by a pyrrole&#8208;based bis(phosphinimine) pincer ligand (L=&#954;3&#8208;NNN&#8217;=2,5&#8208;[iPr2P=N(4&#8208;iPrC6H4)]2&#8208;N&#8217;(C4H2)&#8722;), serves as a versatile platform for the dehydrogenation of group 14 substrates. Reaction with primary and secondary silanes and germanes (MesSiH3, Et2SiH2, Ph2GeH2, tBuGeH3; Mes=mesityl) liberates H2 and yields base&#8208;stabilized tetrylene compounds of the form &#954;2&#8208;L(CO)Rh(ER2) (E=Si: R=Mes, H, 2; R=Et, 5; E=Ge: R=Ph, 6; R=tBu, H, 8). The &#8220;:ER2&#8221; fragment in these species bridges between the rhodium center and a phosphinimine donor. Preliminary reactions between pinacol (Pin) and &#954;2&#8208;L(CO)Rh(ER2), E=Si, Ge, indicate that such complexes can serve as silylene and germylene synthons, releasing :ER2 and catalytically generating PinER2. In contrast, combination of complex 1 and MesGeH3 does not yield the anticipated dehydrogenation product, but rather, transmetalation similar to that observed upon reaction between 1 and 3,5&#8208;dimethylphenylborane prevails.

         <title>Controlling pH&#8208;Sensitive Chemical Reactions Pathways with Light &#8208; a Tale of Two Photobases: an Arrhenius and a Br&#248;nsted</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An interplay between two photobases, a hydroxide&#8208;releasing Arrhenius&#8208;type and a proton&#8208;accepting Br&#248;nsted&#8208;type, can result in a reversible change of pH upon tandem irradiation at two wavelengths. This system can control the direction of chemical reactions. In this study, the reaction direction of Alizarin Red S can be controlled in this manner.







Abstract
Light&#8208;gated chemical reactions allow spatial and temporal control of chemical processes. Here, we suggest a new system for controlling pH&#8208;sensitive processes with light using two photobases of Arrhenius and Br&#248;nsted types. Only after light excitation do Arrhenius photobases undergo hydroxide ion dissociation, while Br&#248;nsted photobases capture a proton. However, none can be used alone to reversibly control pH due to the limitations arising from excessively fast or overly slow photoreaction timescales. We show here that combining the two types of photobases allows light&#8208;triggered and reversible pH control. We show an application of this method in directing the pH&#8208;dependent reaction pathways of the organic dye Alizarin Red S simply by switching between different wavelengths of light, i.&#8201;e., irradiating each photobase separately. The concept of a light&#8208;controlled system shown here of a sophisticated interplay between two photobases can be integrated into various smart functional and dynamic systems.

         <title>Autocatalysis in Eschenmoser Coupling Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Piecing the puzzle together. Mass spectrometry reveals the autocatalytic behavior of the Eschenmoser coupling reaction. Combining the results from ESI&#8208;MS coupled with various add&#8208;on methods, such as IR spectroscopy, ion mobility, or flow chemistry, leads to a comprehensive view of the reaction mechanism.







Abstract
The Eschenmoser coupling reaction (ECR) of thioamides with electrophiles is believed to proceed via thiirane intermediates. However, little is known about converting the intermediates into ECR products. Previous mechanistic studies involved external thiophiles to remove the sulfur atom from the intermediates. In this work, an ECR proceeding without any thiophilic agent or base is studied by electrospray ionization&#8208;mass spectrometry. ESI&#8208;MS enables the detection of the so&#8208;far elusive polysulfide species Sn, with n ranging from 2 to 16 sulfur atoms, proposed to be the key species leading to product formation. Integrating observations from ion mobility spectrometry, ion spectroscopy, and reaction monitoring via flow chemistry coupled with mass spectrometry provides a comprehensive understanding of the reaction mechanism and uncovers the autocatalytic nature of the ECR reaction.

         <title>Intermolecular 1,3&#8208;Dipolar Cycloaddition Reaction of N&#8208;Carbamoyl Nitrones Generated by N&#8208;Selective Carbamoylation of Oximes with Isocyanates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reaction of isocyanates and oximes undergoes N&#8208;selective carbamoylation, directly generating nitrones. Sequential reactions with dipolarophiles give isoxazolidines. The combination of the three components provides diversity in the yields of isoxazolidines.







Abstract
N&#8208;Selective carbamoylation reaction of oximes with isocyanates generates nitrones, which undergo 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloaddition with various dipolarophiles to afford diverse isoxazolidines. Notably, combinations of highly electron&#8208;rich oxime and highly electron&#8208;deficient dipolarophile exhibited high reactivity, with product yields of up to 94&#8201;%. The substituent on the isoxazolidine&#8208;nitrogen atom could be successfully removed without loss of the cyclic structure. Computational studies have also elucidated the mechanism of the reaction and origin of stereoselectivity.

         <title>Covalent Organic Frameworks as Electrode Materials for Alkali Metal&#8208;ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are a class of porous crystalline polymeric materials constructed by linking organic small molecules through covalent bonds. COFs have the advantages of strong covalent bond network, adjustable pore structure, large specific surface area and excellent thermal stability, and have broad application prospects in various fields. Based on these advantages, rational COFs design strategies such as the introduction of active sites, construction of conjugated structures, and carbon material composite, etc. can effectively improve the conductivity and stability of the electrode materials in the field of batteries. This paper introduces the latest research results of high&#8208;performance COFs electrode materials in alkali metal&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs, SIBs, PIBs and LSBs) and other advanced batteries. The current challenges and future design directions of COFs&#8208;based electrode are discussed. It provides useful insights for the design of novel COFs structures and the development of high&#8208;performance alkali metal&#8208;ion batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>gamma&#8208;Cyclodextrins as Supramolecular Reactors for the Three&#8208;component Aza&#8208;Darzens Reaction in Water</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In recent decades, many efforts have been devoted to studying reactions catalyzed in nanoconfined spaces. The most impressive aspect of catalysis in nanoconfined spaces is that the reactivity of the molecules can be smartly driven to disobey classical behavior. A green and efficient three&#8208;component aza&#8208;Darzens (TCAD) reaction using a catalytic amount of g&#8208;cyclodextrins (CDs) in water has been developed to synthesize N&#8208;phenylaziridines. CDs effectively performed this reaction in an environmentally friendly setting, achieving good yields. The same reaction was then performed using polymeric g&#8208;CD such as a g&#8208;cyclodextrin polymer crosslinked (GCDPC) with epichlorohydrin, a sponge&#8208;like macroporous g&#8208;cyclodextrin&#8208;based cryogel (GCDC), and a g&#8208;cyclodextrin&#8208;based hydrogel (GCDH). The homogeneous and heterogeneous catalyst recovery was then studied, and it was proved to be easily recycled several times without relevant activity loss. Water, as a unique and eco&#8208;friendly reaction medium, has been utilized for the first time, to the best of our knowledge, in this reaction. The inclusion of the reagents in CDs has been studied and rationalized by NMR spectroscopy experiments and molecular modeling calculations. The credit of the presented protocol includes good yields and catalyst reusability and precludes the use of organic solvents.</dc:description>

         <title>Recent Advances&#160;in&#160;the Synthesis of Peptidomimetics via Ugi&#160;Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Peptidomimetics&#160;have been extensively explored in many area due to their ability to improve&#160;pharmacological qualities and interesting biological activities. Cycles&#160;could be incorporated in peptides to reduce their flexibility, often enhancing the affinity for a certain receptor. Many&#160;efforts have been made to synthesize various&#160;peptidomimetics. Among them,&#160;the Ugi reaction is a popular way for the synthesis of peptidomimetics because it provides peptide&#8208;like products. The Ugi reaction consists of&#160;the&#160;condensation of an aldehyde or ketone, a carboxylic acid, an amine, and an isocyanide usually giving a linear&#160;peptidomimetic. In order to&#160;obtain&#160;other&#160;linear,&#160;cyclic or polycyclic&#160;peptidomimetics, the acyclic products have to undergo additional transformations or cyclizations.&#160;This review covers the years from 2018&#8208;2023, regarding the synthesis of linear, cyclic and polycyclic peptidomimetics, employing Ugi reactions eventually&#160;followed by post&#8208;Ugi transformations. Organo&#8208;catalyzed reactions, base&#8208;promoted reactions,&#160;and metal&#8208;free reactions&#160;toward peptidomimetics&#160;are highlighted.</dc:description>

         <title>CARBON DOTS BASED TISSUE EQUIVALENT DOSIMETER AS AN IONIZING RADIATION SENSOR</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This work explores the potential of carbon dots as a fluorescent probe in the determination of heavy ions and as an electrochemical biosensor. It also discusses how carbon dots can be introduced into the Fricke solution to potentially serve as an ionizing radiation sensor. The study presents a novel tissue equivalent dosimeter carbon dots&#8208;based as an ionizing radiation sensor. The methodology for the synthesis of Nitrogen&#8208;doped Carbon Dots N&#8208;CDs and the characterization of the material are described. The results show that the N&#8208;CDs have a high sensitivity to ionizing radiation and can be used as a dosimeter for radiation detection. The study also discusses the limitations and challenges of using carbon dots as a dosimeter for ionizing radiation. Overall, this study provides valuable insights into the potential applications of carbon dots in different fields and highlights the importance of further research in this area.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Size matters: In a systematic study, a series of organic cages was synthesized, and their molecular size and mass were determined by diffusion&#8208;ordered NMR spectroscopy (DOSY). Specific effects of window size and rigid exohedral functionalization revealed insight into structure&#8208;diffusion relationships, which could be transferred to literature&#8208;known cages and aid for the precise structure elucidation and property prediction of future cages.







Abstract
Reliable structure elucidation of covalent organic cage compounds remains challenging as routine analysis might leave ambiguities. Diffusion&#8208;ordered NMR spectroscopy (DOSY) allows insight into the molecular size and mass of the species present in solution, but a systematic evaluation of the diffusion behavior for cage assemblies is rarely considered. Here we report the synthesis of four series of covalent organic cages based on tribenzotriquinacenes and diboronic acids with varying geometry and exohedral substituents. We provide a guideline for the consistent measurement of diffusion coefficients from 1H&#8208;DOSY&#8197;NMR spectroscopy, which was utilized to study the diffusion behavior for the whole set of cages and selected examples from the literature. For structurally similar cages, a linear correlation between the solvodynamic volume and the molecular mass allows precise size determination. For more complex systems, multiple parameters, such as window size or rigid exohedral functionalization. further modulate cage diffusion in solution.

         <title>Activated Mn&#8208;MACHO Complexes Form Stable CO2 Adducts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Manganese(I) carbonyl complexes based on MACHO ligand scaffolds produce in their activated amido form stable CO2 adducts, which comprise a 4&#8208;membered {Mn&#8722;N&#8722;C&#8722;O} metallacyclic core. The CO2 adducts generally exhibit a reactivity tamed down as compared to the parent complexes. As masked forms of the catalytically competent amido species, these adducts may have important implications as off&#8208;loop species in carbon dioxide conversion.







Abstract
Manganese(I) carbonyl complexes bearing a MACHO&#8208;type ligand (HN(CH2CH2PR2)2) readily react in their amido form with CO2 to generate 4&#8208;membered {Mn&#8722;N&#8722;C&#8722;O} metallacycles. The stability of the adducts decreases with the steric demand of the R groups at phosphorous (R=isopropyl&gt;adamantyl). The CO2&#8208;adducts display generally a lower reactivity as compared to the parent amido complexes. These adducts can thus be interpretated as masked forms of the active amido catalysts and potentially play important roles as off&#8208;loop species or branching points in catalytic transformations of carbon dioxide.

         <title>Unlocking same&#8208;sign CPL: solvent effects on spectral form and racemisation kinetics in nine&#8208;coordinate chiral europium(III) complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This article highlights the importance and role of solvent polarity, for europium(III) complexes displaying circularly polarised luminescence (CPL) transitions in their emission profile. It is key to investigate the effect of these fundamental physical and environmental factors on the shape, sign and magnitude of CPL active luminescent transitions. Increased understanding of this could lead to novel, bright europium(III) complexes with monosignate individual CPL transitions to be designed for applications ranging from advanced security inks to bio&#8208;probes for live cell imaging.







Abstract
Understanding the factors that shape the circularly polarised luminescence (CPL) emission profiles of europium(III)&#8208;based CPL emitters to have specific sign properties, e.&#8201;g. monosignate individual CPL transitions, is key to design novel complexes for applications ranging from advanced security inks to bio&#8208;probes for live cell imaging. In order to correlate structure and spectral characteristics, a photophysical and kinetic investigation has been conducted on a series of coordinatively saturated nine&#8208;coordinate europium(III) systems based on 1,4,7&#8208;triazacyclononane. We highlight that lanthanide emission is sensitive to changes in the ligand field by showing the linear dependence of total emission intensity ratios as a function of solvent polarity, for europium(III) complexes displaying an internal charge transfer (ICT) excited state. This sensitivity increases by a factor of 20 when studying changes in CPL spectra, rendering these complexes accurate probes of local polarity. Solvent polarity, solvent&#8208;specific effects, and the nature of the chromophores&#8217; coordinating donor atoms strongly influence the kinetic stability of europium(III) complexes with respect to enantiomer interconversion. Notably, we show that the choice of donor groups to coordinating to europium(III) and the nature and polarity of the solvent affects the rate of racemisation, leading to systems with very long half&#8208;lives at room temperature in non&#8208;polar media.

         <title>&#960;&#8208;Electron Fluctuation&#8208;Induced P+/C&#8722; Ambiphilic Interaction for Intramolecular CAr&#8722;H Bond Activation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unexpected C&#8722;H bond activation promoted us to re&#8208;visit the reaction mechanism with 2H&#8208;phosphindole, and further theoretical studies led to finding that within a five&#8208;membered ring, the polarizable PC3 unit orchestrates the formation of a transient P+/C&#8722; ambiphilic species, which responsible for the C&#8722;H bond activation. This work provides mechanistic insights into the previously reported regioselective [4+2] cycloadditions with 2H&#8208;phosphindoles also.







Abstract
Herein, we describe how computational mechanistic understanding has led directly to the discovery of new 2H&#8208;phosphindole for C&#8722;CAr bond activation and dearomatization reaction. We uncover an unexpected intramolecular C&#8722;H bond activation with a 2H&#8208;phosphindole derivative. This new intriguing experimental observation and further theoretical studies led to an extension of the reaction mechanism with 2H&#8208;phosphindole. Through DFT calculations, we confirm that within a five&#8208;membered ring, the polarizable PC3 unit orchestrates the formation of an electrophilic phosphorus atom (P+) and a nucleophilic carbon atom (C&#8722;). This kinetically accessible ambiphilic phosphorus/carbon couple is spatially separated by geometric constraints, and their reactivity is modulated through structural resonance.

         <title>Stereoselective Synthesis of Silylated Vinylboronates by a Boron&#8208;Wittig Reaction and Their Application to Tetrasubstituted Olefins</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of tetrasubstituted silylated pinacol vinylboronates and trisubstituted silylated vinyl MIDA&#8208;boronates was synthesized by using the boron&#8208;Wittig approach. By using this protocol, the boryl and the silyl groups can be directly and highly stereoselectively incorporated into the olefin&#8216;s anti&#8208;position. Further, sequential Suzuki coupling of the silylated vinyl boronates allows access to several all&#8208;carbon tetrasubstituted alkenes, anticancer drug Tamoxifen, and AIEgen agent TPE&#8208;TF17.







Abstract
The highly stereoselective synthesis of a series of tetrasubstituted mono&#8208; as well as disilylated vinylboronates is reported by using the boron&#8208;Wittig approach. The condensation between acylsilanes and gem&#8208;diborylalkanes gave the desired tetrasubstituted olefins in good to excellent yield and high stereoselectivity. Also, a series of trisubstituted silylated vinyl MIDA&#8208;boronates was synthesized by using the boron&#8208;Wittig reaction followed by a transesterification reaction. This methodology allows direct incorporation of B(pin) and TMS groups in the anti&#8208;position of the olefin in a highly stereoselective manner. Further, sequential Suzuki coupling reaction with the silylated vinyl boronic esters generated all&#8208;carbon tetrasubstituted alkenes, which have been applied in the total synthesis of the anticancer drug Tamoxifen and aggregation&#8208;induced luminogen agent TPE&#8208;TF17.

         <title>trans&#8208;Cyclooctenes as Scavengers of Bromine Involved in Catalytic Bromination</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A trans&#8208;cyclooctene (TCO) bearing a 2&#8208;pyridylethyl group was developed to retard non&#8208;catalyzed reactions in bromination using N&#8208;bromosuccinimide by capturing in&#8197;situ&#8208;generated bromine (Br2), which was revealed to cause background reactions. The TCO is useful as an additive for improving catalyst&#8208;controlled selectivity and as a probe to investigate the involvement of Br2 in catalytic bromination.







Abstract
Scavengers that capture reactive chemical substances are used to prevent the decomposition of materials. However, in the field of catalysis, the development of scavengers that inhibit background pathways has attracted little attention, although the concept will open up an otherwise inaccessible reaction space. In catalytic bromination, fast non&#8208;catalyzed background reactions disturb the catalytic control of the selectivity, even when using N&#8208;bromoamide reagents, which have a milder reactivity than bromine (Br2). Here, we developed a trans&#8208;cyclooctene (TCO) bearing a 2&#8208;pyridylethyl group to efficiently retard background reactions by capturing Br2 in bromocyclization using N&#8208;bromosuccinimide. The use of less than a stoichiometric amount of the TCO was sufficient to inhibit non&#8208;catalyzed reactions, and mechanistic studies using the TCO revealed that in&#8197;situ&#8208;generated Br2 provides non&#8208;catalyzed reaction pathways based on a chain mechanism. The TCO is useful as an additive for improving enantioselectivity and regioselectivity in catalytic reactions. Cooperative systems using the TCO with selective catalysts offer an alternative strategy for optimizing catalyst&#8208;controlled selectivity during bromination. Moreover, it also served as an indicator of Br2 involved in catalytic reaction pathways; thus, the TCO was useful as a probe for mechanistic investigations into the involvement of Br2 in bromination reactions of interest.

         <title>Organometallic Bridge Diversification of Bicyclo[1.1.1]pentanes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Bicyclo[1.1.1]pentane (BCP) derivatives have attracted significant recent interest in drug discovery as alkyne, tert&#8208;butyl and arene bioisosteres, where their incorporation is frequently associated with increased compound solubility and metabolic stability. While strategies for functionalisation of the bridgehead (1,3) positions are extensively developed, platforms allowing divergent substitution at the bridge (2,4,5) positions remain limited. Recent reports have introduced 1&#8208;electron strategies for arylation and incorporation of a small range of other substituents, but are limited in terms of scope, yields or practical complexity. Herein, we show the synthesis of diverse 1,2,3&#8208;trifunctionalised BCPs through lithium&#8208;halogen exchange of a readily accessible BCP bromide. When coupled with medicinally relevant product derivatisations, our developed 2&#8208;electron &#8220;late stage&#8221; approach provides rapid and straightforward access to unprecedented BCP structural diversity (&gt;20 hitherto&#8208;unknown motifs reported). Additionally, we describe a method for the synthesis of enantioenriched &#8220;chiral&#8208;at&#8208;BCP&#8221; bicyclo[1.1.1]pentanes through a novel stereoselective bridgehead desymmetrisation.</dc:description>

         <title>Macrocycle&#8208;Based Hierarchically Porous Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) are porous crystalline materials. The pores in HOFs are usually non&#8208;covalent extrinsic pores constructed through the formation of the framework. Supramolecular macrocycles with intrinsic pores in their structures are good candidates for constructing HOFs with intrinsic pores from the macrocycles themselves, thus leading to hierarchically porous structures. Combining the macrocycle and HOFs will endow these hierarchically porous materials with enhanced properties and special functionalities. This review summarizes recent advances in macrocycle&#8208;based HOFs, including the macrocycles used for constructing HOFs, the hierarchically porous structures of the HOFs, and the applications induced by the hierarchically HOFs porous structures. This review provides insights for future research on macrocycle&#8208;based hierarchically porous HOFs and the appropriate applications of the unique structures.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis, Structures and Photophysical Properties of Asymmetric Fulvene&#8208;[b]&#8208;fused BODIPYs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we developed a one&#8208;pot procedure to synthesize novel fulvene&#8208;[b]&#8208;fused BODIPYs from &#945;&#8208;(2&#8208;alkynylphenyl)&#8208;pyrrole and acylpyrrole, using 5&#8208;exo cyclization as the key transformation. Compared to benzene&#8208;[b]&#8208;fused BODIPYs, although they have similar chemical compositions, their structures and properties significantly differ from each other, which can be attributed to the less aromaticity of the fulvene linker than benzene. Notably, fulvene&#8208;[b]&#8208;fused BODIPY 1b exhibits helical&#8208;twisted core skeleton, intensified red&#8208;shifted absorption, and peak fluorescence. In addition, the pathway of this one&#8208;pot reaction and the mechanism of POCl3 mediated 5&#8208;exo cyclization have been proposed by a combining experimental and computational study.</dc:description>

         <title>Construction of&#160;Oligorotaxanes with Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Aramide&#160;Macrocycles through Threaded Host&#8208;Guest Complexation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of efficient and selective organic synthetic approaches for complex molecules has garnered significant attention due to the need for precise control over molecular structures and functions. Rotaxanes, a type of mechanically interlocked molecules (MIMs), have shown promising applications in various fields including sensing, catalysis, and material science. However, the highly selective synthesis of oligo[n]rotaxanes (mostly n &#8805; 3) through controlling host&#8208;guest complexation and supramolecular threading assembly process still remains an ongoing challenge. In particular, the utilization of two&#8208;dimensional (2D) macrocycles with structural shape&#8208;persistency for the synthesis of oligo[n]rotaxanes is rare. In this concept, research on cooperatively threaded host&#8208;guest complexation with hydrogen&#8208;bonded (H&#8208;bonded) aramide macrocycles and selective synthetic protocols of oligo[n]rotaxanes has been summarized. The high efficiency and selectivity in synthesis are ascribed to the synergistic interplay of multiple non&#8208;covalent bonding interactions such as hydrogen bonding and intermolecular &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking of macrocycles within the unique supramolecular structure of threaded host&#8208;guest complexes and rotaxanes. This review focuses on the latest progress in the concepts, synthesis, and properties of H&#8208;bonded aramide macrocycle&#8208;based oligorotaxanes, and presents an in&#8208;depth outlook on challenges in this emerging field.</dc:description>

         <title>Double Four Ring Units&#8208;Containing Zeolites: Synthesis, Structural Modification and Catalytic Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In zeolite frameworks, double four&#8208;ring (d4r) configurations are among the most frequent composite building units. The composition variations in d4r units greatly influence the energy and structural modifiability of the zeolitic framework. The introduction of germanium, with a larger ionic radius than silicon or aluminum, not only reduces the energy constraints of d4r in the nucleation and crystal growth of zeolites, but also opens a new window for constructing novel crystalline structures, especially with large or extra&#8208;large pores and channels. Ge&#8208;enriched d4r units endow germanosilicates with structure diversity readily for post treatments. Promising catalytic materials have been gradually developed and increasingly studied by direct synthesis or post&#8208;synthetic isomorphous substitution for Ge. This review focuses on the recent progress in the synthesis, modification, and catalytic application of d4r&#8208;containing zeolites, including germanosilicates, aluminosilicates, and silicates.</dc:description>

         <title>Giant Star&#8208;shaped meso&#8208;substituted Fluorescent Porphyrins with Fluorenyl&#8208;containing Arms Designed for Two&#8208;photon Oxygen Photosensitization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Abstract: In the continuation of previous studies on carbon&#8208;rich meso&#8208;tetraarylporphyrins featuring 2,7&#8208;fluorene units at their periphery, the effect of changing the peripheral dendritic arms for linear arms on . their oxygen&#8208;photosensitizing ability, their fluorescence and their two&#8208;photon absorption (2PA) properties is now analyzed. Thus, starburst porphyrins possessing up to twenty conjugated fluorenyl units were isolated and studied. More precisely, a series of five new free&#8208;base porphyrins featuring fully conjugated arms incorporating an increasing number of fluorenyl groups connected via 1,2&#8208;alkenyl spacers were synthesized, along with their Zn(II) complexes. Upon excitation in the arm&#8208;centred&#160;band, an efficient energy transfer takes place from the peripheral fluorenyl units to the central porphyrin core, leading to intense red&#8208;light emission and oxygen photosensitization by the latter. More interestingly, while the linear optical properties of these porphyrins were only slightly improved compared to those of their dendrimer analogues for photodynamic therapy (PDT) or fluorescence imaging, their 2PA cross&#8208;sections were much more significantly boosted, evidencing the key role played by different structures on nonlinear optical properties. Finally, by comparison with other porphyrin&#8208;based two&#8208;photon photosensitizers reported in the literature, we show that these new &#8220;semi&#8208;disconnected&#8221; starburst systems exhibit a remarkable trade&#8208;off between intrinsic 2PA, fluorescence and oxygen photosensitization.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Abstract: In the continuation of previous studies on carbon-rich meso-tetraarylporphyrins featuring 2,7-fluorene units at their periphery, the effect of changing the peripheral dendritic arms for linear arms on . their oxygen-photosensitizing ability, their fluorescence and their two-photon absorption (2PA) properties is now analyzed. Thus, starburst porphyrins possessing up to twenty conjugated fluorenyl units were isolated and studied. More precisely, a series of five new free-base porphyrins featuring fully conjugated arms incorporating an increasing number of fluorenyl groups connected via 1,2-alkenyl spacers were synthesized, along with their Zn(II) complexes. Upon excitation in the arm-centred&#160;band, an efficient energy transfer takes place from the peripheral fluorenyl units to the central porphyrin core, leading to intense red-light emission and oxygen photosensitization by the latter. More interestingly, while the linear optical properties of these porphyrins were only slightly improved compared to those of their dendrimer analogues for photodynamic therapy (PDT) or fluorescence imaging, their 2PA cross-sections were much more significantly boosted, evidencing the key role played by different structures on nonlinear optical properties. Finally, by comparison with other porphyrin-based two-photon photosensitizers reported in the literature, we show that these new &#8220;semi-disconnected&#8221; starburst systems exhibit a remarkable trade-off between intrinsic 2PA, fluorescence and oxygen photosensitization.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Nucleophilic Substitution at Phosphorus Centres &#8211; Old and Recent Studies and a Final Solution of Mechanistic and Related Stereochemical Problems</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Among many problems of a fundamental value in the heteroatom chemistry the mechanism and stereochemistry of nucleophilic substitution reaction at the phosphorus and other heteroatom centres have attracted a great attention of phosphorus chemists already in the middle of the last century. This review, which does not have a comprehensive character, summarizes the selected original contributions aimed at solution of the mechanism of SN2&#8208;P reaction and its relationship with stereochemistry. The breakthrough in these studies has the Westheimer concept and his rules presented at the beginning of this article. Next, a series of papers is presented where the stereochemistry of substitution at phosphorus was investigated in cyclic five&#8208;, four&#8208; and six&#8208;membered ring phosphorus compound. The majority of these reactions have been found to occur with retention of the P&#8208;configuration. In the third part of this account, the selected examples of substitution reactions at phosphorus in acyclic compounds are discussed. As the results of all the investigations discussed did not allow to ascribe undoubtedly the mechanism (SN2 or A&#8208;E) to the investigated reactions, in the last part the SN&#8208;P reactions are presented the mechanism of which has been established by combination of the stereochemical and DFT&#8208;studies.</dc:description>

This review, which does not have a comprehensive character, summarizes the selected original contributions aimed at solution of the mechanism of SN2-P reaction and its relationship with stereochemistry. The breakthrough in these studies has the Westheimer concept and his rules presented at the beginning of this article. Next, a series of papers is presented where the stereochemistry of substitution at phosphorus was investigated in cyclic five-, four- and six-membered ring phosphorus compound. The majority of these reactions have been found to occur with retention of the P-configuration. In the third part of this account, the selected examples of substitution reactions at phosphorus in acyclic compounds are discussed. As the results of all the investigations discussed did not allow to ascribe undoubtedly the mechanism (SN2 or A-E) to the investigated reactions, in the last part the SN-P reactions are presented the mechanism of which has been established by combination of the stereochemical and DFT-studies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>
