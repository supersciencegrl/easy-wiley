      <title>Triphenylphosphine&#8208;functionalized core&#8208;cross&#8208;linked micelles and nanogels with a polycationic outer shell: synthesis and application in rhodium&#8208;catalyzed biphasic hydrogenations</title>
      <dc:description>Unimolecular amphiphilic nanoreactors with a poly(4&#8208;vinyl&#8208;N&#8208;methylpyridinium iodide) (P4VPMe+I&#8208;) polycationic outer shell and two different architectures (core&#8208;crosslinked micelles, CCM, and nanogels, NG), with narrow size distributions around 130&#8208;150 nm in diameter, were synthesized by RAFT polymerization from an R0&#8208;4VPMe+I&#8208;140&#8208;b&#8208;S50&#8208;SC(S)SPr macroRAFT agent by either chain extension with a long (300 monomer units) hydrophobic polystyrene&#8208;based block followed by crosslinking with diethylene glycol dimethacrylate (DEGDMA) for the CCM particles, or by simultaneous chain extension and crosslinking for the NG particles. A core&#8208;anchored triphenylphosphine (TPP) ligand functionality was introduced by using 4&#8208;diphenylphosphinostyrene (DPPS) as a comonomer (5&#8208;20% mol/mol) in the chain extension (for CCM) or chain extension/crosslinking (for NG) step. The products were directly obtained as stable colloidal dispersions in water (latexes). After loading with [RhCl(COD)]2  to yield [RhCl(COD)(TPP@CCM)] or [RhCl(COD)(TPP@NG)], respectively, the polymers were used as polymeric nanoreactors in the Rh&#8208;catalyzed aqueous biphasic hydrogenation of the model substrates styrene and 1&#8208;octene, either neat (for styrene) or in an organic solvent (toluene or 1&#8208;nonanol). All hydrogenations were rapid (TOF up to 300 h&#8208;1  ) at 25&#176;C and 20 bar of H2  pressure, the biphasic mixture rapidly decanted at the end of the reaction (&lt; 2 min), the Rh loss was negligible (&lt;0.1 ppm in the recovered organic phase), and the catalyst phase could be recycled 10 times without significant loss of catalytic activity.</dc:description>

      <title>Generation of Oxidoreductases with Dual Alcohol Dehydrogenase and Amine Dehydrogenase Activity</title>
      <dc:description>
The catalytic promiscuity of LysEDH&#8212;which naturally catalyzes the oxidative deamination of l&#8208;lysine at the &#1013;&#8208;amino group&#8212;was harnessed to create variants that exhibited alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) and amine dehydrogenase (AmDH) activities. These ADH and AmDH activities could be switched by changing the reaction conditions. The dual ADH&#8208;AmDH activity (i.e., alcohol aminase) was applied to convert benzyl alcohol to benzylamine using a single enzyme. The artwork illustrates a &#8220;water lever&#8221; that represents the switch of the enzyme's activity from an AmDH to an ADH and vice versa.

      <title>Metastability and seeding effects in the mechanochemical hybrid lead(II) iodide formation</title>
      <dc:description>We present the mechanism for the mechanochemical synthesis of (C(NH  2  )  3  )  3  PbI  5  3  and (C(NH  2  )  3  )  4  PbI  6  4  and their conversion into each other. We investigated the syntheses of  3  at different frequencies and energies using in situ powder X&#8208;ray diffraction. By splitting the reaction into single parts we could prove that the formation of  3  is simply dependent on the energy and mixing speed. The nucleation of  4  instead is slightly negative dependent on the energy but dependent on the mixing speed, while its growth is mostly independent of any influence. We were able to influence the reaction pathways by seeding the mixture with a small amount of powdery  4  . The formation of  4  is very likely an auto&#8208;catalytic process.  3  instead is metastable. It can be stabilized by energy, which beside mechanochemistry can also be achieved by temperature. The results showcases the complex nature of mechanochemical reactions.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>We report the self&#8208;assembly of a unique molecular container: hybrid hydrogen&#8208;bonded/metal&#8208;coordinated cage where both hydrogen&#8208;bonding and metal&#8208;coordination form the crucial part of the topology. The hybrid cage was prepared combining hydrogen&#8208;bonded rosette motif and palladium(II)/platinum(II) coordination to a pyridine ligand. We also show that the hybrid cage can be prepared by integrative self&#8208;sorting from simple components. We further manifest for the first time the genuine dual character of the hybrid cage as both self&#8208;assembling parts response selectively to different stimuli (such as phosphine and cyanurate), which results in the disassembly of the cage.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Transition metal phosphide is regarded as one of the most promising candidates to replace noble&#8208;metal hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) electrocatalysts. Nevertheless, the controllable design and synthesis of transition metal phosphide electrocatalyst with efficient and stable electrochemical performance are still very challenging.

      <title>Exploratory N&#8208;protecting group manipulation for the total synthesis of zwitterionic Shigella sonnei oligosaccharides</title>
      <dc:description>Shigella sonnei  surface polysaccharides are well&#8208;established protective antigens against this major cause of diarrhoeal disease. They also qualify as unique zwitterionic polysaccharides (ZPSs) featuring a disaccharide repeating unit made of two 1,2&#8208;  trans  linked rare aminodeoxy sugars, a 2&#8208;acetamido&#8208;2&#8208;deoxy&#8208;l&#8208;altruronic acid (l&#8208;Alt  p  NAcA) and a 2&#8208;acetamido&#8208;4&#8208;amino&#8208;2,4,6&#8208;trideoxy&#8208;d&#8208;galactopyranose (AAT). Herein, the stereoselective synthesis of  S. sonnei  oligosaccharides comprising two and three repeating units is reported for the first time. Several sets of up to seven protecting groups were explored, shedding light on the singular conformational behavior of protected altrosamine and altruronic residues. A disaccharide building block equipped with three distinct  N  &#8208;protecting groups and featuring the uronate moiety already in place was designed to accomplish the iterative high yielding glycosylation at the axial 4&#8208;OH of the altruronate component and achieve the challenging full deprotection step. Key to the successful strategy was the use of a diacetyl strategy whereby the  N  &#8208;acetamido group of the l&#8208;Alt  p  NAcA is masked in the form of an imide.</dc:description>

      <title>Enantioselective cleavage of cyclobutanols through Ir&#8208;catalyzed&#160;C&#8208;C bond activation: Mechanistic and synthetic aspects</title>
      <dc:description>The Ir&#8208;catalyzed conversion of prochiral&#160;  tert  &#8208;cyclo&#173;butanols to&#160; b &#8208;methyl&#8208;substituted ketones proceeds under comparably mild conditions in toluene (45&#8211;110&#176;C) and is particularly suited for the enantio&#173;selective desymmetrization of&#160; b &#8208;oxy&#8208;substituted substrates to give products with a quaternary chirality center with up to 95%&#160;  ee  &#160;using DTBM&#8208;SegPhos as a chiral ligand. Deuteration experi&#173;ments and kinetic isotope effect measurements revealed major mechanistic differences to related Rh(I)&#8208;catalyzed transformations. Supported by DFT calculations we propose the initial formation of an Ir(III) hydride intermediate which then undergoes a&#160; b &#8208;C elimination (C&#8208;C bond activation) prior to reductive C&#8208;H elimination. The computational model also allows the prediction of the stereochemical outcome. The Ir&#8208;catalyzed cyclobutanol cleavage is broadly applicable but fails for substrates bearing strongly coordinating groups. The method is of particular value for the stereo&#8208;controlled synthesis of substituted chromanes related to the tocopherols and other natural products.</dc:description>

      <title>A series of bisamide&#8208;substituted diacetylenes exhibiting terminal alkyl odd&#8208;even parity effect on mechano&#8208;activation for the subsequent photopolymerization property</title>
      <dc:description>Diacetylene derivatives exhibit solid&#8208;state polymerization to polydiacetylene initiated by UV light or &#947;&#8208;ray irradiation. The activation of the photopolymerization highly relies on the monomer diynes arrangement. Recently, we have demonstrated the first mechanoresponsive bisamide substituted diacetylenes (DAs) showing dramatic switching from light&#8208;inert to light&#8208;reactive state upon a given pressure. The origin of this unique phenomenon was apparently related to the pressure&#8208;sensitive crystalline transition in DAs, but the molecular mechanism remains elusive. To obtain the insight, we herein present a series of DAs with varying terminal alkyl spacer length, and their molecular structural effect on the intermolecular hydrogen bonding and steric repulsion. In pristine states, even&#8208;parity DAs were inactive upon UV irradiation (&#955;=254 nm) unless external pressure was given. By contrast, odd&#8208;parity DAs were easily polymerized upon UV irradiation without pressure application. However, the pressure&#8208;induced crystalline phase transition exhibiting photopolymerization was valid for all DAs regardless of their alkyl spacer length. A systematic investigation revealed that the terminal alkyl spacer length, especially its odd&#8208;even parity plays a key role to determine the intrinsic intermolecular hydrogen bonding nature of DA crystals and resultant molecular packing. In addition, the relevant thermochromic behaviour was also observed from photopolymerized polydiacetylenes.</dc:description>

      <title>An Antimony(III) Fluoride Oxalate With Large Birefringence</title>
      <dc:description>Birefringent materials play a key role in modulating the polarization of light and thus in optical communication as well as the laser techniques and science. Designing new, excellent birefringent materials remains a challenge. In this work, we designed and synthesized the first antimony(III) fluoride oxalate birefringent material, KSb  2  C  2  O  4  F  5  , by a combination of delocalized  &#960;  &#8208;conjugated [C  2  O  4  ]  2&#8208;  groups, stereochemical active Sb  3+  cations, and the most electronegative F element. The [C  2  O  4  ]  2&#8208;  groups are not in an optimal arrangement in the crystal structure of KSb  2  C  2  O  4  F  5  . Remarkably, KSb  2  C  2  O  4  F  5  exhibits a large birefringence (&#916;  n  = 0.170 @546 nm) that is even better than the well&#8208;known commercial birefringent material  &#945;  &#8208;BaB  2  O  4  , whereas the latter features an optimal arrangement of  &#960;  &#8208;conjugated [B  3  O  6  ]  3&#8208;  groups. Based on the first&#8208;principles calculations, this prominent birefringence should be attributed to the alliance of planar  &#960;  &#8208;conjugated [C  2  O  4  ]  2&#8208;  anions, highly distorted SbO  2  F  2  and SbOF  3  polyhedra with stereochemical activity lone pair. Combination of lone pair electrons and  &#960;  &#8208;conjugated systems enables to boost the birefringence to a large extent and will help to develop high&#8208;performance birefringent materials.</dc:description>

Based on the first&#8208;principles calculations, this prominent birefringence should be attributed to the alliance of planar  &#960;  &#8208;conjugated [C  2  O  4  ]  2&#8208;  anions, highly distorted SbO  2  F  2  and SbOF  3  polyhedra with stereochemical activity lone pair. Combination of lone pair electrons and  &#960;  &#8208;conjugated systems enables to boost the birefringence to a large extent and will help to develop high&#8208;performance birefringent materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Mechanical modulation of the solid&#8208;state luminescence of tricarbonyl rhenium(I) complexes through the interplay between two triplet excited states</title>
      <dc:description>Mechanoresponsive luminescence (MRL) active materials promise smart devices for sensing, optoelectronics, and security. Herein is the first report on the MRL&#8208;activity of two Re(I) complexes, opening up new opportunities for applications in this field. Both complexes exhibit marked solid&#8208;state luminescence enhancement (SLE) effect. Pristine microcrystalline powders emit in the yellow&#8208;green region, grinding led to an amorphous phase with concomitant emission red&#8208;shift and shrinking of photoluminescence (PL) quantum yields and lifetimes. Quantum chemical calculations revealed the existence of two low&#8208;lying triplet excited states of very close energy levels, i.e. 3IL and 3MLCT, having respectively almost pure intraligand and metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge transfer character. Transition between these states could be promoted by rotation around the pyridyltriazole&#8208;phenylbenzoxazole (pyta&#8208;PBO) bond. In microcrystals, where rotations are hindered, the 3IL state induces prominent PL emission at short wavelengths. Upon grinding, rotation is facilitated and the transition to the 3MLCT state results in a larger proportion of long&#8208;wavelength PL. FTIR spectroscopic analyses and variable temperature PL spectroscopy showed that the opening of vibrational modes favours non&#8208;radiative deactivation of the triplet states in the amorphous phase. In solutions, PL only arises from the 3MLCT state. The same mechanism accounts for the spectroscopic differences observed when passing from crystals to amorphous powders, and then to solutions, clarifying the link between SLE and MRL for these complexes.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Conventional histology is a destructive technique based on the evaluation of 2D slices of a 3D biopsy. By using 3D X&#8208;ray histology these obstacles can be overcome, but their application is still restricted due to the inherently low attenuation properties of soft tissue. In order to solve this problem, the tissue can be stained before X&#8208;ray computed tomography (CT) imaging to enhance the soft tissue X&#8208;ray contrast. Evaluation of brominated fluorescein salts revealed a mutual influence of the number of bromine atoms and the cations applied on the achieved contrast enhancement.

      <dc:description>Self&#8208;assembly of &#960;&#8208;conjugated molecules in solution generally occurs due to either an enthalpic or an entropic gain; however, designing &#960;&#8208;conjugated systems that simultaneously exhibit enthalpically and entropically favorable self&#8208;assembly behavior is challenging. Herein, we disclose the self&#8208;assembly behavior of tetraazatetrathia[8]circulenes, which is driven by both enthalpy and entropy. A single&#8208;crystal x&#8208;ray diffraction analysis demonstrated that molecules of these tetraazatetrathia[8]circulenes form face&#8208;to&#8208;face stacked dimers&#160; with a 1D columnar structure due to the circularly arranged dipole moments. Importantly, concentration&#8208; and temperature&#8208;dependent&#160;  1  H NMR spectra revealed that the formation of self&#8208;assemblies of tetraazatetrathia[8]circulenes in chloroform and methanol is favored by both enthalpic and entropic factors. The unique association behavior is due to the presence of sp  2  &#8208;hybridized nitrogen atoms, which weakly coordinate to the hydrogen atoms of these solvents and reduce the&#160; &#960; &#8208;electron density of the circulene cores.</dc:description>

      <title>Boron&#8208;Ligand Cooperation: The Concept and Applications</title>
      <dc:description>The term boron&#8208;ligand cooperation was introduced to describe a specific mode of action by which certain metal&#8208;free systems activate chemical bonds. The main characteristic of this mode of action is that one covalently bound substituent at the boron is actively involved in the bond activation process and changes to a datively bound ligand in the course of the bond activation. Within this review, we reflect on how the term boron&#8208;ligand cooperation evolved and discuss examples of bond activation by boron&#8208;ligand cooperation. We furthermore show that systems that operate via boron&#8208;ligand cooperation can complement the reactivity of classic intramolecular frustrated Lewis pairs and summarize applications of this new concept for metal&#8208;free catalysis.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>
Alloy nanoclusters (NCs) have become a hot topic in the study of metal NCs and the number of publications on alloy NCs has increased explosively in recent years. Such publications have provided much insight into the effects of alloying on the electronic structure and function of alloy NCs. Here, the obtained knowledge for Aun&#8722;xMx(SR)m, Agn&#8722;xMx(SR)m, Aun&#8722;xMx(PR3)l(SR)m, and Agn&#8722;xMx(PR3)l(SR)m (Au=gold, Ag=silver, M=heteroatom, PR3=phosphine, and SR=thiolate) NCs is summarized.

      <dc:description>
The electronic properties of conjugated polymers are strongly affected by the conformation of the polymer backbone. A rigid coplanar conformation could significantly improve the intrachain and interchain charge transport. Three types of conjugated polymers with rigid coplanar conformations are introduced. Complete conformation control strategies of conjugated polymers are summarized in this Minireview by J. Pei et al. on page 16194.

      <title>Frontispiece: Insights into the Mechanism of Gold(I) Oxidation with Aryldiazonium Salts</title>
      <dc:description>
Aryldiazonium salts have emerged as efficient electrophiles for the oxidative addition of gold. In this minireview we enclose the mechanistic evidences gained so far by different authors concerning the mechanism. It is of common acceptance that aryladicals are crucial intermediates in these processes. Interestingly, it has been manifested that there are various successful ways to activate aryldiazonium salts for the generation of the desired arylgold(III) species. Generally speaking, these methods can be encompassed in: photoredox activation, photo activation and chemical activation. For more information see the Minireview by I. Medina&#8208;Mercado and S. Porcel on page 16206. The frontispiece graphic was designed by Hortensia Segura Silva.

      <dc:description>
A new class of visible&#8208;light&#8208;sensitive photolabile protecting groups based on low&#8208;molecular weight COUPY fluorophores, which expand the current photochemical toolbox, is described. Besides being efficiently photoactivated with yellow and red light under physiological&#8208;like conditions, COUPY photocages exhibit excellent cellular uptake and accumulate selectively in mitochondria, opening the door to the delivery of caged analogues of biologically active compounds into these organelles. For more details see the Communication by V. March&#225;n et&#8197;al. on page 16222.

Multi&#8208;vicinal fluorine analogues are among the most intriguing and promising compounds but their physical and biological investigations suffer from challenging syntheses. Hence, we report on the synthesis of a large set of novel polyfluorohexitols. The determination of the dominant solution&#8208;state conformation of all trifluorohexitol was achieved, along with the comparison of solid&#8208;state conformation of some analogues. Finally, the lipophilicity of a large set of polyfluorinated hexopyranose and hexitol analogues was attributed using a log  P  determination method based on  19  F NMR spectroscopy.</dc:description>

Yolk/double&#8208;shelled SiOx@TiO2@C nanospheres with different voids were successfully prepared, and the regulation of SiOx yolk was achieved by changing the etching time. The etching time of SiOx yolk affects the morphology and electrochemical performance of SiOx@TiO2@C. The dial represents the etching time of SiOx yolk in NaOH solution and the brightness of the Chinese red lantern represents the electrochemical performance of the composites. When the etching time is 60&#8197;min, SiOx@TiO2@C with 30&#8197;nm void exhibits remarkable performance as an anode for lithium&#8211;ion batteries. More information can be found in the Full Paper by G.&#8197;Zhou et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202003246).

      <title>In Situ Corrosion Fabrication of NaNbO3/Nb3O7F Heterojunctions with Optimized Band Realignment for Enhanced Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution</title>
      <dc:description>Heterostructured photocatalysis is a significant issue&#160;due to the unique band alignment, improved spectrum absorption and enhanced photocatalytic activity. However, constructing uniform, controllable and effective heterojunctions still keeps a huge challenge&#160;up to now. Herein, NaNbO3/Nb3O7F&#160;heterojunctions were fabricated by an  in situ  &#160;corrosion technique for the first time. The influence of phase transformation on the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity was investigated systematically&#160;  via  &#160;the photocatalytic water splitting for H2  production. Interestingly, the band realignment and good interfacial contact endowed NaNbO3/Nb3O7F&#160;heterojunctions with higher HER activity (43.3 mmol&#8226;g&#8208;1  h&#8208;1  ), about 2.4 times of pure Nb3O7F&#160;(mmol&#8226;g&#8208;1  h&#8208;1  ) and 1.36 times of pure NaNbO3  (mmol&#8226;g&#8208;1  h&#8208;1  ).

      <dc:description>Photodynamic therapy has been used to treat a variety of diseases, however there is a continuous search for new biocompatible photosensitizers. Herein, we demonstrate for the first time that imidazo[1,2&#8208;  a  ]pyrimidine compounds are able to generate singlet oxygen species, and can act as photosensitizers in the intracellular environment. Our results show that this class of compounds absorbs and emits in the 400&#8208;500 nm region, presents low cytotoxicity in the dark, is efficiently uptaken by cells, is fluorescent in the intracellular medium, and generates singlet oxygen upon irradiation killing cancer cells within 2 h at low concentration (2.0 &#181;M).

      <title>Personalized Reusable Face Masks with Smart Nano&#8208;Assisted Destruction of Pathogens for COVID&#8208;19: a Visionary Road</title>
      <dc:description>The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID&#8208;19) emergency has demonstrated that the utilization of face masks plays a critical role in limiting the outbreaks. Healthcare professionals utilize masks all day long without replacing them very frequently, thus representing a source of cross&#8208;infection for patients and themselves. Nanotechnology is a powerful tool with the capability to produce nanomaterials with unique physicochemical and anti&#8208;pathogen properties. Here, we outline how to realize non&#8208;disposable and highly comfortable respirators with light&#8208;triggered self&#8208;disinfection ability by bridging bioactive nanofiber properties and stimuli&#8208;responsive nanomaterials. The visionary road highlighted in this Concept is based on the possibility to develop a new generation of masks based on multifunctional membranes where the presence of nanoclusters and plasmonic nanoparticles arranged in a hierarchical structure enables the realization of a chemically&#8208;driven and on&#8208;demand anti&#8208;pathogen activities. Multilayer electrospun membranes have the ability to dissipate humidity present within the mask, enhancing the wearability and usability. The photo&#8208;thermal disinfected membrane is the core of these 3D printed and reusable masks with moisture pump capability. Personalized face masks with smart nano&#8208;assisted destruction of pathogens will bring enormous advantages to the entire global community, especially for front&#8208;line personnel, and will open up great opportunities for innovative medical applications.</dc:description>

      <title>Ditopic Chelators of Dicopper Centers for an Enhancement of Tyrosinases Inhibition</title>
      <dc:description>Tyrosinase enzymes (Tys) are involved in the key steps of melanin (protective pigments) biosynthesis and molecules targeting the binuclear copper active site on tyrosinases represent a relevant strategy to regulate enzyme activities. In this work, we studied the possible synergic effect generated by combination of known inhibitors. For this, derivatives containing kojic acid (KA) and 2&#8208;Hydroxypyridine&#8208;  N  &#8208;oxide (HOPNO) combined with a thiosemicarbazone (TSC) moiety were synthetized. Their inhibition activities were evaluated on purified tyrosinases from different sources (mushroom, bacterial and human) as well as on melanin production by lysats from human melanoma MNT&#8208;1 cell line. Results showed significant enhancement of the inhibitory effects compared to the parent compounds, in particular for HOPNO&#8208;TSC. In order to elucidate the interaction mode with the dicopper(II) active site, we investigated the binding studies towards a tyrosinase bio&#8208;inspired model of the dicopper(II) center. The structure of the isolated adduct between one ditopic inhibitor (KA&#8208;TSC) and the model complex reveals that the binding to a dicopper center can occur with both chelating sites. Computational studies on model complexes and docking studies on enzymes led to the identification of KA and HOPNO moieties as interacting groups with the dicopper active site.</dc:description>

      <title>Controlled Shape&#8211;Evolution of Pure&#8208;MOF 1D&#8208;Microcrystals towards Efficient Waveguide and Laser Applications</title>
      <dc:description>MOF&#8208;based one&#8208;dimensional materials have received increasing attention in nanophotonics field, but it is still diffcult in the flexible shape&#8211;evolution of MOF micro/nanocrystals for desired optical functionalities due to the susceptible solvothermal growth process. Herein, we report on the well&#8208;controlled shape&#8211;evolution of pure&#8208;MOF microcrystals with optical waveguide and lasing performances based on a bottom&#8208;up &amp; top&#8208;down synergistic method. The MOF microcrystals from solvethermol synthesis (bottom&#8208;up) enable to evolve from microrods via microtubes to nanowires through a chelating agent&#8208;assisted etching process (top&#8208;down). The three types of MOF 1D&#8208;microstructures with high crystallinity and smooth surfaces all exhibit efficient optical waveguide performance. Furthermore, MOF nanowire with lowest propagation loss served as low&#8208;threshold pure&#8208;MOF nanolasers with Fabry&#8722;P&#233;rot resonance. These results advance the fundamental understanding on the controlled MOF evolution mechanism, and offer a valuable route for the development of pure&#8208;MOF&#8208;based photonic components with desired functionalities.</dc:description>

      <title>How Oriented External Electric Fields Modulate Reactivity</title>
      <dc:description>A judiciously oriented external electric field (OEEF) can catalyze a wide range of reactions and can even induce&#160;endo/exostereoselectivity of cycloaddition reactions. We study the Diels&#8208;Alder reaction between cyclopentadiene and maleic anhydride using quantitative activation strain and Kohn&#8208;Sham molecular orbital theory to pinpoint the origin of these catalytic and stereoselective effects. Our quantitative model reveals that an OEEF along the reaction axis induces an enhanced electrostatic and orbital interaction between the reactants, which in turn lowers the reaction barrier. The stronger electrostatic interaction originates from an increased electron density difference between the reactants at the reactive center, while the enhanced orbital interaction arises from the promoted normal electron demand donor&#8211;acceptor interaction driven by the OEEF. An OEEF perpendicular to the plane of the reaction axis solely stabilizes the&#160;exo&#160;pathway of this reaction while the&#160;endo&#160;pathway remains unaltered and efficiently steers the&#160;endo/exo&#160;stereoselectivity. Furthermore, we have also investigated the influence of OEEFs on the inverse electron demand Diels&#8208;Alder reaction, which, unexpectedly, inhibits the reaction, as the electric field now suppresses the critical inverse electron demand donor&#8211;acceptor interaction.</dc:description>

      <title>Ni2P Nanoalloy as an Air&#8208;Stable and Versatile Hydrogenation Catalyst in Water: P&#8208;Alloying Strategy for Designing Smart Catalysts</title>
      <dc:description>Non&#8208;noble metal&#8208;based hydrogenation catalysts have limited practical applications because they exhibit low activity, require harsh reaction conditions, and are unstable in air. To overcome these limitations, herein we propose the alloying of non&#8208;noble metal nanoparticles with phosphorus as a promising strategy for developing smart catalysts that exhibit both excellent activity and air stability. We synthesized a novel nickel phosphide nanoalloy (nano&#8208;Ni2P) with coordinatively unsaturated Ni active sites. Unlike conventional air&#8208;unstable non&#8208;noble metal catalysts, nano&#8208;Ni2P retained its metallic nature in air, and exhibited a high activity for the hydrogenation of various substrates with polar functional groups, such as aldehydes, ketones, nitriles, and nitroarenes to the desired products in excellent yields in water. Furthermore, the used nano&#8208;Ni2P catalyst was easy to handle in air and could be reused without pretreatment, providing a simple and clean catalyst system for general hydrogenation reactions.</dc:description>

      <title>Covalency in Actinide Compounds</title>
      <dc:description>Covalency in actinides has emerged as a resounding research topic on account of the technological importance in separating minor actinides from lanthanides for spent nuclear fuel processing, and utilization of their distinct bonding properties has been realized as a route towards overcoming this challenge. Because of the&#160; limited radial extent of the 4  f  orbitals , there is almost no 4  f  &#160;electron participation in bonding in lanthanides; this is not the case for the actinides, which have extended 5  f  &#160;orbitals that are capable of overlapping with ligand orbitals, although not to the degree of overlap as in the&#160;  d  &#160;orbitals of transition metals. In this concept paper, we provide a general description of covalency in actinide compounds. After introducing two main approaches to enhance covalency, either by exploiting increased orbital overlap or decreasing energy differences between the orbitals causing orbital energy degeneracy, we show the current state of the field using several examples from the recent literature. We will conclude by proposing the use of actinide chalcogenides as a convenient auxiliary tool to study covalency in actinide compounds.</dc:description>

Because of the&#160; limited radial extent of the 4  f  orbitals , there is almost no 4  f  &#160;electron participation in bonding in lanthanides; this is not the case for the actinides, which have extended 5  f  &#160;orbitals that are capable of overlapping with ligand orbitals, although not to the degree of overlap as in the&#160;  d  &#160;orbitals of transition metals. In this concept paper, we provide a general description of covalency in actinide compounds. After introducing two main approaches to enhance covalency, either by exploiting increased orbital overlap or decreasing energy differences between the orbitals causing orbital energy degeneracy, we show the current state of the field using several examples from the recent literature. We will conclude by proposing the use of actinide chalcogenides as a convenient auxiliary tool to study covalency in actinide compounds.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Electro&#8208;oxidative selective esterification of methylarenes and benzaldehydes</title>
      <dc:description>A mild and green electro&#8208;oxidative protocol to construct aromatic esters from methylarenes and alcohols is herein reported. Importantly, the reaction is free of metals, chemical oxidants, bases, acids, and operates at room temperature. Moreover, the design of the electrolyte was found critical for the oxidation state and structure of the coupling products, a rarely documented effect. This electro&#8208;oxidative coupling process also displays exceptional tolerance of many fragile easily oxidized functional groups such as hydroxyl, aldehyde, olefin, alkyne, as well as neighboring benzylic positions. The enantiomeric enrichment of some chiral alcohols is moreover preserved during this electro&#8208;oxidative coupling reaction, making it overall a promising synthetic tool.</dc:description>

      <title>Stereo&#8208; and Enantioselective Synthesis of Propionate&#8208;Derived&#160;Trisubstituted Alkene Motifs</title>
      <dc:description>We report a new method for constructing propionate&#8208;derived trisubstituted alkene motifs in a stereoselective manner. 1&#8208;Substituted 1,1&#8208;di(pinacolatoboryl)&#8208;(E)&#8208;alk&#8208;2&#8208;enes are in situ generated from 1&#8208;substituted 1,1&#8208;di(pinacolatoboryl)alk&#8208;3&#8208;enes through ruthenium(II)&#8208;catalyzed double&#8208;bond transposition. These species undergo a chiral phosphoric acid&#8208;catalyzed allylation reaction of aldehydes to produce the E isomers of anti&#8208;homoallylic alcohols. On the other hand, the corresponding Z isomers of anti&#8208;homoallylic alcohols are obtained when a dimeric palladium(I) complex is employed as the catalyst for this double&#8208;bond transposition. Thus, both E and Z isomers can be synthesized from the same starting materials. A B&#8211;C(sp2) bond remaining with the allylation product undergoes the Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling reaction to furnish a propionate&#8208;derived trisubstituted alkene motif in a stereo&#8208;defined form. The present method to construct the motifs with (E)&#8208; and (Z)&#8208;alkenes are successfully applied to the syntheses of (+)&#8208;isotrichostatic acid, (&#8211;)&#8208;isotrichostatin RK, and (+)&#8208;trichostatic acid, respectively.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Direct targeting of intrinsically disordered proteins, including MYC by small&#8208;molecules for biomedical applications will resolve a longstanding issue in chemical biology and medicine. Thus, we developed gold&#8208;based small&#8208;molecule MYC reagents that engage MYC inside cells and modulate MYC transcriptional activity.

      <title>Controlling Spin&#8208;Correlated Radical Pairs with Donor&#8722;Acceptor Dyads: A New Concept to Generate Reduced Metal Complexes for More Efficient Photocatalysis</title>
      <dc:description>One&#8208;electron reduced metal complexes derived from photoactive ruthenium or iridium complexes are important intermediates for substrate activation steps in photoredox catalysis and for the photocatalytic generation of solar fuels. However, owing to the heavy atom effect, direct photochemical pathways to these key intermediates suffer from intrinsic efficiency problems resulting from rapid geminate recombination of radical pairs within the so&#8208;called solvent cage.

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;One&#8208;electron reduced metal complexes derived from photoactive ruthenium or iridium complexes are important intermediates for substrate activation steps in photoredox catalysis and for the photocatalytic generation of solar fuels. However, owing to the heavy atom effect, direct photochemical pathways to these key intermediates suffer from intrinsic efficiency problems resulting from rapid geminate recombination of radical pairs within the so&#8208;called solvent cage. In this study, we prepared and investigated molecular dyads capable of producing reduced metal complexes via an indirect pathway relying on a sequence of energy and electron transfer processes between a Ru complex and a covalently connected anthracene moiety. Our test reaction to establish the proof of concept is the photochemical reduction of ruthenium(tris)bipyridine by the ascorbate dianion as sacrificial donor in aqueous solution.

      <title>Surface Termination Layer Dominating the Moisture Degradation Pathway in CH3NH3PbI3 Perovskite Film</title>
      <dc:description>Theoretical studies have disclosed that the surface terminations such as MAI&#8208; or PbI&#8208;layers affect greatly on the environmental stability of organic&#8208;inorganic perovskite. However, until now, there have been rarely direct evidence trying to experimentally detect the existence of MAI or PbI terminations on MAPbI3  grains, let along disclosing their effects on the humidity degradation pathway of perovskite solar cell. Here, we successfully modified and detected the surface terminations of MAI and PbI species on the polycrystalline MAPbI3  films. For the MAI&#8208;terminated perovskite film, it followed the moisture degradation process from MAPbI3  to hydrate MAPbI3&#183;H2O and then into PbI2, penetration of water molecules was the main driving force to lead the degradation of MAPbI3  layer by layer. While, for the PbI&#8208;terminated perovskite film in humidity, a deprotonation degradation pathway was confirmed, in which it preferred to directly degrade from MAPbI3  into PbI2, while the iodine defects here played a key role in promoting the dissociation of water molecules into hydroxyl OH&#8208;  and further catalyzing the decomposition of perovskite.</dc:description>

      <title>Mechanistic Investigation on Chemiluminescent Formaldehyde Probes</title>
      <dc:description>A first&#8208;generation pair of chemiluminescent formaldehyde (FA) probes&#160;(CFAP540 and CFAP700) was reported recently. CFAP540 and CFAP700 with high selectivity and sensitivity to FA, are respectively suitable in cell and in vivo. Experimentalists have confirmed that both probes utilize a general 2&#8208;aza&#8208;Cope FA&#8208;reactive trigger and a chemiluminogenic phenoxydioxetane scaffold. The mechanism and detailed process of CFAP chemiluminescence (CL) remain largely unknown. In the present paper, we performed (time&#8208;dependent) density functional theory calculations on the entire reaction process of CFAP540 with FA to produce CL. The calculations elucidated the CL producing process: FA initiates the decomposition of CFAP540 by dehydration condensation, and a phenoxy 1,2&#8208;dioxetane is formed through a series of reactions of aza&#8208;Cope rearrangement, hydrolysis of imine, and &#946;&#8208;elimination of alkoxyl group. Afterwards, the produced phenoxy 1,2&#8208;dioxetane decomposes to produce m&#8208;oxybenzoate derivative at the first singlet state (S1) via two crossings between potential energy surfaces of the ground state (S0) and S1 state. This m&#8208;oxybenzoate derivative was assigned to the light emitter of the CFAP540 CL. The CL producing process and assignment of the light emitter of CFAP700 CL are similar with the corresponding ones of CFAP540. By analyzing the D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A architecture of the light emitters of CFAP540 and CFAP700, we theoretically designed a series of CFAPs and proposed a scheme to modulate their CL from visible to near&#8208;infrared region by adjusting the length and structure of the &#960;&#8208;bridge.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Two&#8208;dimensional polymers (2DPs) have attracted much interest due to their unique 2D atomic&#8208;thick covalent network with periodically linked monomers. The preparation of mono&#8208; or few&#8208;layered 2DPs with highly ordered structures is still a big challenge.

The pre&#8208;assembly process induced by the D&#8208;A interactions before the polymerization plays a key role in constructing highly ordered structure.

      <dc:description>Universal&#160;access to clean water has been the global ambition over the years. Photocatalytic water disinfection via advanced oxidation processes has been regarded as one of the promising methods in breaking down microbials. The forefront of this research focuses on the application of metal&#8208;free photocatalysts for disinfection to prevent secondary pollution.

      <title>Aerobic Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Salicylaldehydic Cformyl&#8211;H Arylations with Arylboronic Acids</title>
      <dc:description>We report a challenging copper&#8208;catalyzed Cformyl&#8722;H arylation of salicylaldehydes with arylboronic acids, which involves unique salicylaldehydic copper&#8208;species differing from reported salicylaldehydic rhodacycle and palladacycle. Also, this protocol has high chemoselectivity for the Cformyl&#8722;H bond compared to the phenolic O&#8722;H bond involving copper catalysis under high reaction temperature. This approach is compatible with a wide range of salicylaldehyde and arylboronic acid substrates, including estrone and carbazole derivatives, which leads to corresponding arylation products. Mechanistic studies show that 2&#8208;hydroxy group of salicylaldehyde substrate triggers the formation of salicylaldehydic copper complexes via Cu(I)/Cu(II)/Cu(III) catalytic cycle.</dc:description>

      <title>Ferrous to ferric transition in Fe&#8208;phthalocyanine driven by NO2 exposure</title>
      <dc:description>Due to its unique magnetic properties offered by the open&#8208;shell electronic structure of the central metal ion, and for being an effective catalyst in a wide variety of reactions, iron phthalocyanine has drawn significant interest from the scientific community. Nevertheless, upon surface deposition, the magnetic properties of the molecular layer can be significantly affected by the coupling occurring at the interface, and the more reactive the surface, the stronger is the impact on the spin state. Here we show that on Cu(100), indeed, the strong hybridization between the Fe  d  &#8208;states of FePc and the  sp  band of the copper substrate modifies the charge distribution in the molecule, significantly influencing the magnetic properties of the iron ion. The Fe  II  ion is stabilized in the low singlet spin state (S=0), leading to the complete quenching of the molecule&#8217;s magnetic moment. By exploiting the FePc/Cu(100) interface, we demonstrate that NO  2  dissociation can be used to gradually change the magnetic properties of the iron ion, by trimming the gas dosage. For lower doses, the FePc film is decoupled from the copper substrate, restoring the gas phase triplet spin state (S=1). A higher dose induces the transition from ferrous to ferric phthalocyanine, in its intermediate spin state, with enhanced magnetic moment due to the interaction with the atomic ligands. Remarkably, in this way, three different spin configurations have been observed within the same metalorganic/metal interface by exposing it to different doses of NO  2  at room temperature.</dc:description>
