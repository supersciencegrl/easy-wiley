         <title>CO2 Laser&#8208;Induced Graphene with an Appropriate Oxygen Species as an Efficient Electrocatalyst for Hydrogen Peroxide Synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 60, October 26, 2022. </description>

Biomass&#8208;based graphene with active oxygen species is rapidly fabricated by a CO2 laser method. The laser&#8208;induced graphene shows a high catalytic performance in 2 e&#8722; oxygen reduction reactions to synthesize H2O2 including high Faraday efficiency (over 78&#8201;%) and mass activity (814&#8197;mmolgcatalyst&#8722;1&#8197;h&#8722;1) in alkaline solution, superior to most of the reported carbon&#8208;based electrocatalysts. As demonstrated by density function theory simulations, the high catalytic sites are attributed to the meta&#8208;C atoms with charge accumulation at nearby C&#8722;O and O&#8722;C=O species.







Abstract
Oxygen species functionalized graphene (O&#8722;G) is an effective electrocatalyst for electrochemically synthesizing hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) by a 2 e&#8722; oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). The type of oxygen species and degree of carbon crystallinity in O&#8722;G are two key factors for the high catalytic performance of the 2 e&#8722; ORR. However, the general preparing method of O&#8722;G by the precursor of graphite has the disadvantages of consuming massive strong oxidant and washing water. Herein, the biomass&#8208;based graphene with tunable oxygen species is rapidly fabricated by a CO2 laser. In a flow cell setup, the laser&#8208;induced graphene (LIG) with abundant active oxygen species and graphene structure shows high catalytic performance including high Faraday efficiency (over 78&#8201;%) and high mass activity (814&#8197;mmolgcatalyst&#8722;1&#8197;h&#8722;1), superior to most of the reported carbon&#8208;based electrocatalysts. Density function theory demonstrates the meta&#8208;C atoms at nearby C&#8722;O, O&#8722;C=O species are the key catalytic sites. Therefore, we develop one facile method to rapidly convert biomass to graphene electrocatalyst used for H2O2 synthesis.

         <title>Chemo&#8208; and Site&#8208;Selective Electro&#8208;Oxidative Alkane Fluorination by C(sp3)&#8722;H Cleavage</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 60, October 26, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal&#8208;free electrochemical C(sp3)&#8722;H fluorination was accomplished without the requirement for directing groups and electrophilic fluorine sources, featuring high levels of site&#8208; and chemoselectivity.







Abstract
Electrochemical fluorinations of C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds with a nucleophilic fluoride source have been accomplished in a chemo&#8208; and site&#8208;selective fashion, avoiding the use of electrophilic F+ sources and stoichiometric oxidants. The introduced metal&#8208;free strategy exhibits high functional group tolerance, setting the stage for late&#8208;stage fluorinations of biorelevant motifs. The synthetic utility of the C(sp3)&#8722;H fluorination was reflected by subsequent one&#8208;pot arylation of the generated benzylic fluorides.

         <title>Controlling Electronic Events Through Rational Structural Design in Subphthalocyanine&#8211;Corrole Dyads: Synthesis, Characterization, and Photophysical Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 60, October 26, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of covalently linked subphthalocyanine&#8211;corrole (SubPc&#8208;Cor) dyads have been prepared. In four of the reported examples, Cor&#8901;+&#8208;SubPc&#8901;&#8722; charge&#8208;separated states have been observed, whereas in the case of the electron&#8208;rich SubPc and the electron&#8208;deficient Cor dyad, only energy transfer has been detected.







Abstract
Porphyrinoids are considered perfect candidates for their incorporation into electron donor&#8211;acceptor (D&#8211;A) arrays due to their remarkable optoelectronic properties and low reorganization energies. For the first time, a series of subphthalocyanine (SubPc) and corrole (Cor) were covalently connected through a short&#8208;range linkage. SubPc axial substitution strategies were employed, which allowed the synthesis of the target molecules in decent yields. In this context, a qualitative synthetic approach was performed to reverse the expected direction of the different electronic events. Consequently, in&#8208;depth absorption, fluorescence, and electrochemical assays enabled the study of electronic and photophysical properties. Charge separation was observed in cases of electron&#8208;donating Cors, whereas a quantitative energy transfer from the Cor to the SubPc was detected in the case of electron accepting Cors.

         <title>Cationic Gold(II) Complexes: Experimental and Theoretical Study
</title>

         <dc:description>
Gilded gases: Gold(II) complexes are rare, and a little is known about their properties. We have generated gaseous gold(II) halido complexes from their gold(III) precursors with various auxiliary ligands and investigated them by helium&#8208;tagging infrared and visible photodissociation spectroscopy. The structure of the complexes was described by DFT calculations benchmarked by comparison with the experimental data.







Abstract
Gold(II) complexes are rare, and their application to the catalysis of chemical transformations is underexplored. The reason is their easy oxidation or reduction to more stable gold(III) or gold(I) complexes, respectively. We explored the thermodynamics of the formation of [AuII(L)(X)]+ complexes (L=ligand, X=halogen) from the corresponding gold(III) precursors and investigated their stability and spectral properties in the IR and visible range in the gas phase. The results show that the best ancillary ligands L for stabilizing gaseous [AuII(L)(X)]+ complexes are bidentate and tridentate ligands with nitrogen donor atoms. The electronic structure and spectral properties of the investigated gold(II) complexes were correlated with quantum chemical calculations. The results show that the molecular and electronic structure of the gold(II) complexes as well as their spectroscopic properties are very similar to those of analogous stable copper(II) complexes.

Exploring the possibilities of an odd&#8208;electron bond formation under basic and oxidative conditions in silico: How radical&#8208;anion bond formation and electron upconversion allow for milder oxidative conditions.







Abstract
Traditionally, cross&#8208;dehydrogenative coupling (CDC) leads to C&#8722;N bond formation under basic and oxidative conditions and is proposed to proceed via a two&#8208;electron bond formation mediated by carbenium ions. However, the formation of such high&#8208;energy intermediates is only possible in the presence of strong oxidants, which may lead to undesired side reactions and poor functional group tolerance. In this work we explore if oxidation under basic conditions allows the formation of three&#8208;electron bonds (resulting in &#8220;upconverted&#8221; highly&#8208;reducing radical&#8208;anions). The benefit of this &#8220;upconversion&#8221; process is in the ability to use milder oxidants (e.&#8201;g., O2) and to avoid high&#8208;energy intermediates. Comparison of the two&#8208; and three&#8208;electron pathways using quantum mechanical calculations reveals that not only does the absence of a strong oxidant shut down two&#8208;electron pathways in favor of a three&#8208;electron path but, paradoxically, weaker oxidants react faster with the upconverted reductants by avoiding the inverted Marcus region for electron transfer.

&lt;p&gt;Traditionally, cross-dehydrogenative coupling (CDC) leads to C&#8722;N bond formation under basic and oxidative conditions and is proposed to proceed via a two-electron bond formation mediated by carbenium ions. However, the formation of such high-energy intermediates is only possible in the presence of strong oxidants, which may lead to undesired side reactions and poor functional group tolerance. In this work we explore if oxidation under basic conditions allows the formation of three-electron bonds (resulting in &#8220;upconverted&#8221; highly-reducing radical-anions). The benefit of this &#8220;upconversion&#8221; process is in the ability to use milder oxidants (e.&#8201;g., O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and to avoid high-energy intermediates. Comparison of the two- and three-electron pathways using quantum mechanical calculations reveals that not only does the absence of a strong oxidant shut down two-electron pathways in favor of a three-electron path but, paradoxically, weaker oxidants react faster with the upconverted reductants by avoiding the inverted Marcus region for electron transfer.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Effective method for TfOH&#8208;catalyzed construction of spiroindanes and spirotetralines containing an all&#8208;carbon quaternary stereocenter was developed, and the reaction was applied to the first total synthesis of (&#177;)&#8208;misrametine.







Abstract
An effective method was developed for TfOH&#8208;catalyzed construction of spiroindanes and spirotetralines containing an all&#8208;carbon quaternary stereocenter. Intramolecular Friedel&#8208;Crafts&#8208;type 1,4&#8208;addition of the substrates which were di&#8208; or trimethoxybenzene and 2&#8208;cyclohexenone linked by an alkyl chain proceeded smoothly in the presence of 30&#8197;mol&#8201;% of TfOH. A variety of spiroindanes and spirotetralines were obtained with moderate to excellent yield by this method. The reaction was successfully applied in the first total synthesis of the unusual proaporphine alkaloid (&#177;)&#8208;misrametine, which included the gram&#8208;scale spirocyclization and selective O&#8208;demethylation used KCN in DMSO condition as key steps.

         <title>Ethylene&#8208;Coordinative Chain&#8208;Transfer Polymerization&#8208;Induced Self&#8208;Assembly (CCTPISA)</title>

Unchaining ways: Ethylene&#8208;coordinative chain&#8208;transfer polymerization&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly is performed by chain extending poly(ethylene&#8208;co&#8208;butadiene) living chains in toluene in the presence of ethylene and a Nd&#8208;based catalyst.







Abstract
Block copolymers based on ethylene (E) and butadiene (B) were prepared using the ansa&#8208;bis(fluorenyl) complex {Me2Si(C13H8)2Nd(BH4)2Li(THF)}2 in combination with (n&#8208;Bu)(n&#8208;Oct)Mg (BOMAG) as a chain&#8208;transfer agent. The diblock copolymers incorporating a soft poly(ethylene&#8208;co&#8208;butadiene) segment, called ethylene butadiene rubber (EBR), and a hard polyethylene (PE) one were obtained by simply adjusting the different feeds of monomers during the polymerization. The soluble EBR block was formed first by feeding the catalytic system dissolved in toluene at 70&#8201;&#176;C with a mixture of ethylene and butadiene (E/B molar ratio 80&#8201;:&#8201;20). Then the feeding was stopped leading to the consumption of a large part of the residual monomers. The reactor was finally fed with ethylene to form the PE block. By varying the molar mass of the latter, it is shown that the resulting soft&#8208;b&#8208;hard block copolymers can self&#8208;assemble simultaneously to the growth of the PE block in agreement with a polymerization&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly (PISA) mechanism. The self&#8208;assembly is discussed considering the reaction conditions, the crystallization of the PE block, and the polymerization mechanism involved.

         <title>Catalysis by [Ga4L6]12&#8722; Metallocage on the Nazarov Cyclization: The Basicity of Complexed Alcohol is Key</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 60, October 26, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Nazarov cyclization process performed inside a metallocage is much faster than in solution. This is mainly due to the change of basicity of the substrate (an alcohol) once encapsulated.







Abstract
The Nazarov cyclization is investigated in solution and within K12[Ga4L6] supramolecular organometallic cage by means of computational methods. The reaction needs acidic condition in solution but works at neutral pH in the presence of the metallocage. The reaction steps for the process are analogous in both media: (a) protonation of the alcohol group, (b) water loss and (c) cyclization. The relative Gibbs energies of all the steps are affected by changing the environment from solvent to the metallocage. The first step in the mechanism, the alcohol protonation, turns out to be the most critical one for the acceleration of the reaction inside the metallocage. In order to calculate the relative stability of protonated alcohol inside the cavity, we propose a computational scheme for the calculation of basicity for species inside cavities and can be of general use. These results are in excellent agreement with the experiments, identifying key steps of catalysis and providing an in&#8208;depth understanding of the impact of the metallocage on all the reaction steps.

         <title>Enantiodivergent Chemoenzymatic Dynamic Kinetic Resolution: Conversion of Racemic Propargyl Alcohols into Both Enantiomers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 60, October 26, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Choosing the outcome: A silyl group at the alkyne terminal of secondary propargyl alcohols temporarily inverted the enantio&#8208;recognition of natural lipases. Using this phenomenon, the lipase/oxovanadium co&#8208;catalyzed dynamic kinetic resolution (DKR) of racemic alcohols achieved enantiodivergent production of R and S enantiomers in high yield and with high enantiomeric excess.







Abstract
Natural lipases typically recognize enantiomers of alcohols based on the size differences of substituents near the carbinol moiety and selectively react with the R enantiomers of secondary alcohols. Therefore, lipase&#8208;catalyzed dynamic kinetic resolution (DKR) of racemic secondary alcohols produces only R enantiomers. We report herein a method for obtaining S enantiomers by DKR of secondary 3&#8208;(trialkylsilyl)propargyl alcohols by using a well&#8208;known R&#8208;selective Pseudomonas fluorescens lipase in combination with a racemization catalyst VMPS4, in which the silyl group reverses the size relationship of substituents near the carbinol moiety. We have already reported R&#8208;selective DKR of the corresponding propargyl alcohols without substituents on the ethynyl terminal carbon, and the presence of an easily removable silyl group has enabled us to produce both enantiomers of propargyl alcohols in high chemical yields and with high enantiomeric excess. In addition, immobilization of the lipase on Celite was found to be important for achieving a high efficiency of the DKR.

We report herein a method for obtaining &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt; enantiomers by DKR of secondary 3-(trialkylsilyl)propargyl alcohols by using a well-known &lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;-selective &lt;i&gt;Pseudomonas fluorescens&lt;/i&gt; lipase in combination with a racemization catalyst VMPS4, in which the silyl group reverses the size relationship of substituents near the carbinol moiety. We have already reported &lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;-selective DKR of the corresponding propargyl alcohols without substituents on the ethynyl terminal carbon, and the presence of an easily removable silyl group has enabled us to produce both enantiomers of propargyl alcohols in high chemical yields and with high enantiomeric excess. In addition, immobilization of the lipase on Celite was found to be important for achieving a high efficiency of the DKR.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Interplay and Competition Between Two Different Types of Redox&#8208;Active Ligands in Cobalt Complexes: How to Allocate the Electrons?</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 60, October 26, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Molecular transition metal complexes with two different types of redox&#8208;active ligands are uncommon. Herein, the synthesis of the first mono&#8208; and dinuclear cobalt complexes is reported which exhibit redox&#8208;active oxolene&#8208;type ligands in combination with redox&#8208;active bisguanidine/urea azine ligands, representing four or six center redox systems. Radical ligands are present in all complexes; the differences in the electronic structures lead to characteristic magnetic and optical properties.







Abstract
The field of molecular transition metal complexes with redox&#8208;active ligands is dominated by compounds with one or two units of the same redox&#8208;active ligand; complexes in which different redox&#8208;active ligands are bound to the same metal are uncommon. This work reports the first molecular coordination compounds in which redox&#8208;active bisguanidine or urea azine (biguanidine) ligands as well as oxolene ligands are bound to the same cobalt atom. The combination of two different redox&#8208;active ligands leads to mono&#8208; as well as unprecedented dinuclear cobalt complexes, being multiple (four or six) center redox systems with intriguing electronic structures, all exhibiting radical ligands. By changing the redox potential of the ligands through derivatisation, the electronic structure of the complexes could be altered in a rational way.

         <title>High&#8208;fidelity Recognition of Organotrifluoroborate Anions (R&#8722;BF3&#8722;) as Designer Guest Molecules</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 60, October 26, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Organic trifluoroborate anions (R&#8722;BF3&#8722;) are found to be competent size&#8208;matched binding partners for cyanostar macrocycles. Binding involves the BF3&#8722; headgroups and is modulated by the sterics of the substituent. Small vinyl and methyl substituents bind equally well and lay a foundation for the guest&#8208;design of self&#8208;assembled architectures.







Abstract
The recognition of boron compounds is well developed as boronic acids but untapped as organotrifluoroborate anions (R&#8722;BF3&#8722;). We are exploring the development of these and other designer anions as anion&#8208;recognition motifs by considering them as substituted versions of the parent inorganic ion. To this end, we demonstrate strong and reliable binding of organic trifluoroborates, R&#8722;BF3&#8722;, by cyanostar macrocycles that are size&#8208;complementary to the inorganic BF4&#8722; progenitors. We find that recognition is modulated by the substituent's sterics and that the affinities are retained using the common K+ salts of R&#8722;BF3&#8722; anions.

         <title>Improving the Electrocatalytic Activity of a Nickel&#8208;Organic Framework toward the Oxygen Evolution Reaction through Vanadium Doping</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 60, October 26, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The spherical structure V&#8208;doped Ni&#8208;MOF was successfully constructed on nickel foam by a facile two&#8208;step hydrothermal method. The V0.09&#8722;Ni0.91MOF/NF catalyst demonstrates extraordinary OER performance in alkaline. Studies showed that the three&#8208;dimensional structure of V&#8208;doped Ni&#8208;MOF/NF can provide more catalytically active sites and adjust the binding energy with intermediates, thereby enhancing the OER catalytic activity.







Abstract
Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) have been considered as potential oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts owning to their ultra&#8208;thin structure, adjustable composition, high surface area, and high porosity. Here, we designed and fabricated a vanadium&#8208;doped nickel organic framework (V1&#8722;x&#8722;NixMOF) system by using a facile two&#8208;step solvothermal method on nickel foam (NF). The doping of vanadium remarkably elevates the OER activity of V1&#8722;x&#8722;NixMOF, thus demonstrating better performance than the corresponding single metallic Ni&#8208;MOF, NiV&#8208;MOF and RuO2 catalysts at high current density (&gt;400&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2). V0.09&#8722;Ni0.91MOF/NF provides a low overpotential of 235&#8197;mV and a small Tafel slope of 30.3&#8197;mV&#8201;dec&#8722;1 at a current density of 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. More importantly, a water&#8208;splitting device assembled with Pt/C/NF and V0.09&#8722;Ni0.91MOF/NF as cathode and anode yielded a cell voltage of 1.96&#8197;V@1000&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, thereby outperforming the&#8208;state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art RuO2(+)||Pt/C(&#8722;). Our work sheds new insight on preparing stable, efficient OER electrocatalysts and a promising method for designing various MOF&#8208;based materials.

         <title>Fe&#8208;Catalyzed Amidation of Allylic Alcohols by Borrowing Hydrogen Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 60, October 26, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The amidation of allylic alcohols with chiral tert&#8208;butylsulfinamide catalyzed by an Earth&#8208;abundant Fe complex via a borrowing hydrogen pathway has been developed. With water as the only by&#8208;product, a range of synthetically useful chiral sulfinamide olefin derivatives were obtained under mild reaction conditions with exclusive linear selectivity and retention of enantioselectivity.







Abstract
Allylic amines are useful building blocks in organic synthesis, so the development of green and efficient methods for the preparation of allylic amines are of great importance. An Fe&#8208;catalyzed amidation of allylic alcohols with chiral tert&#8208;butylsulfinamide has been developed. With water as the only by&#8208;product, a range of synthetically useful chiral sulfinamide olefin derivatives (30 examples) were obtained under mild reaction conditions. The reaction can be performed on a gram&#8208;scale, and the products could serve as chiral ligands for asymmetric catalysis. Mechanistic studies suggest that the reaction proceeds by an Fe&#8208;catalyzed borrowing hydrogen process, which is different from most of the reported allylic amination reactions.

         <title>Rational Tuning of the Reactivity of Three&#8208;Membered Heterocycle Ring Openings via SN2 Reactions</title>

It's a trap! Our quantum chemical analyses reveal that ring&#8208;opening reaction barriers decrease in the order aziridines&gt;phosphiranes&gt;epoxides&gt;thiiranes, and thus do not simply follow the order of C&#8722;Y leaving&#8208;group bond strength. We illustrate that orbital interaction (HOMONu&#8211;LUMOSubstrate is an all&#8208;important factor for these reactions. The high reactivity of aziridines and phosphiranes substituted with electron&#8208;withdrawing groups is mainly caused by a diminished steric repulsion between the reactants.







Abstract
The development of small&#8208;molecule covalent inhibitors and probes continuously pushes the rapidly evolving field of chemical biology forward. A key element in these molecular tool compounds is the &#8220;electrophilic trap&#8221; that allows a covalent linkage with the target enzyme. The reactivity of this entity needs to be well balanced to effectively trap the desired enzyme, while not being attacked by off&#8208;target nucleophiles. Here we investigate the intrinsic reactivity of substrates containing a class of widely used electrophilic traps, the three&#8208;membered heterocycles with a nitrogen (aziridine), phosphorus (phosphirane), oxygen (epoxide) or sulfur atom (thiirane) as heteroatom. Using quantum chemical approaches, we studied the conformational flexibility and nucleophilic ring opening of a series of model substrates, in which these electrophilic traps are mounted on a cyclohexene scaffold (C6H10Y with Y=NH, PH, O, S). It was revealed that the activation energy of the ring opening does not necessarily follow the trend that is expected from C&#8722;Y leaving&#8208;group bond strength, but steeply decreases from Y=NH, to PH, to O, to S. We illustrate that the HOMONu&#8211;LUMOSubstrate interaction is an all&#8208;important factor for the observed reactivity. In addition, we show that the activation energy of aziridines and phosphiranes can be tuned far below that of the corresponding epoxides and thiiranes by the addition of proper electron&#8208;withdrawing ring substituents. Our results provide mechanistic insights to rationally tune the reactivity of this class of popular electrophilic traps and can guide the experimental design of covalent inhibitors and probes for enzymatic activity.

         <title>Dihydrogen Activation with a Neutral, Intermolecular Silicon(IV)&#8208;Amine Frustrated Lewis Pair</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 60, October 26, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A silicon Lewis superacid with a novel perfluorinated ortho&#8208;aminophenol ligand is designed and used in FLP type H2 activation, enabling for the first time the formation of an hydridosilicate directly from H2. The narrow choice of the Lewis base and the reaction conditions emphasize the commonly encountered difficulties in this challenging hallmark FLP reaction.







Abstract
The heterolytic cleavage of dihydrogen constitutes the hallmark reaction of frustrated Lewis pairs (FLP). While being well&#8208;established for planar Lewis acids, such as boranes or silylium ions, the observation of the primary H2 splitting products with non&#8208;planar Lewis acid FLPs remained elusive. In the present work, we report bis(perfluoro&#8208;N&#8208;phenyl&#8208;ortho&#8208;amidophenolato)silane and its application in dihydrogen activation to a fully characterized hydridosilicate. The strict design of the Lewis acid, the limited selection of the Lewis base, and the distinct reaction conditions emphasize the narrow tolerance to achieve this fascinating process with a tetrahedral Lewis acid.

         <title>Mechanistic Insights about the Ligand&#8208;Enabled Oxy&#8208;arylation/vinylation of Alkenes via Au(I)/Au(III) Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 60, October 26, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
DFT calculations provide valuable insights into the mechanism of the oxy&#8208;arylation/vinylation of akenes catalyzed by gold. The way alkenols coordinate to (MeDalphos)Au(R&#8217;)2+ (R&#8217;=phenyl, vinyl) was found to significantly depend on their substitution pattern (terminal, Z/E internal) and to play a major role in the 5&#8208;exo/6&#8208;endo regioselectivity.







Abstract
The mechanism of oxy&#8208;arylation/vinylation of alkenes catalyzed by the (MeDalphos)AuCl complex was comprehensively investigated by DFT. (P,N)Au(Ph)2+ and (P,N)Au(vinyl)2+ are key intermediates accounting for the activation of the alkenols and for their cyclization by outer&#8208;sphere nucleophilic attack of oxygen. The 5&#8208;exo and 6&#8208;endo paths have been computed and compared, reproducing the peculiar regioselectivity difference observed experimentally between 4&#8208;penten&#8208;1&#8208;ol, (E) and (Z)&#8208;4&#8208;hexen&#8208;1&#8208;ols. Examining the way the alkenol coordinates to gold (more &#951;2 or &#951;1) can offer, in some cases, a simple way to predict the favored path of cyclization.

         <title>Construction of C&#8208;N Atropisomers by Aminocatalytic Enantioselective Addition of Indole&#8208;2&#8208;carboxaldehydes to o&#8208;Quinone Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 60, October 26, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
You (don't) spin me right &#8216;round, baby, right &#8216;round. A new organocatalytic atroposelective method for the construction of C&#8722;N atropisomers is presented. The newly developed F&#8208;substituted aminocatalyst, with an increased outer&#8208;sphere steric control, enables the atroposelective formation of the desired product, which feature interesting biological motifs.







Abstract
The first atroposelective aminocatalytic methodology for the construction of C&#8722;N atropisomers is presented. The synthesis of this class of axially chiral molecules typically encompasses substrates in which the C&#8722;N bond is pre&#8208;formed.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;You (don't) spin me right &#8216;round, baby, right &#8216;round&lt;/b&gt;. A new organocatalytic atroposelective method for the construction of C&#8722;N atropisomers is presented. The newly developed F-substituted aminocatalyst, with an increased outer-sphere steric control, enables the atroposelective formation of the desired product, which feature interesting biological motifs.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first atroposelective aminocatalytic methodology for the construction of C&#8722;N atropisomers is presented. The synthesis of this class of axially chiral molecules typically encompasses substrates in which the C&#8722;N bond is pre-formed. In contrast, this work presents the direct coupling of indole-2-carboxaldehydes to &lt;i&gt;ortho&lt;/i&gt;-quinones, to form the stereogenic C&#8722;N axis in an atroposelective way. Application of typical secondary amine catalysts furnished the desired product, however, in low yields and as a complex mixture arising from poor regiocontrol among the C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;- and N&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;-sites of the indole core. A new aminocatalyst was designed and synthesized with increased outer-sphere steric bulk to address these challenges thereby providing good levels of regio- and enantioselectivity. A novel library of functionalized and enantioenriched C&#8722;N atropisomers was obtained and their synthetic utility was demonstrated by various transformations.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Eu&#8208;ETTB and Gd&#8208;ETTB were obtained with the same topology by self&#8208;assembly. Both materials showed extremely high proton conductivity: the proton conductivity of Eu&#8208;ETTB was 1.53&#215;10&#8722;2&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 98&#8201;% relative humidity (RH) and 85&#8201;&#176;C, while Gd&#8208;ETTB had a proton conductivity value of 2.63&#215;10&#8722;2&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 98&#8201;% RH and 75&#8201;&#176;C. Furthermore, both materials had excellent performance both in terms of stability and durability.







Abstract
In this work, the two example rare earth&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic frameworks (LaIII&#8208;based MOFs), Eu&#8208;ETTB and Gd&#8208;ETTB, were obtained by self&#8208;assembly. Both materials showed extremely high proton conductivity, with the proton conductivity of Eu&#8208;ETTB being 1.53&#215;10&#8722;2&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 98&#8201;% relative humidity (RH) and 85&#8201;&#176;C and that of Gd&#8208;ETTB being 2.63&#215;10&#8722;2&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 98&#8201;% RH and 75&#8201;&#176;C. This was almost the best performance observed for three&#8208;dimensional porous MOFs without post&#8208;synthetic modification and was based on milder conditions than for most materials. Furthermore, cycle test experiments and continuous work tests showed that both materials had excellent performance both in terms of stability and durability. Water vapor adsorption experiments showed that a large number of water molecules are adsorbed the hydrogen&#8208;bond network's being rebuilt by the adsorbed water molecules in the pore channel and thus optimizing the channels for proton transfer explained the MOF's high performance.

         <dc:description>
f&#8208;Block elements exhibit unique coordination chemistry in molten salts, which arouse increasing research efforts due to the demands for separation and recovery of these elements via molten salt&#8208;based pyrochemical approaches. Although challenging, with the assistance of advanced high&#8208;temperature characterization techniques and theoretical calculations, coordination behaviors of f&#8208;block elements, such as chemical species, coordination structures, and their evolutions in molten salt, can be understood in a clearer manner.

Eu&#8208;ETTB and Gd&#8208;ETTB were obtained by self&#8208;assembly; their three&#8208;dimensional frameworks provide a channel for proton conduction. Under high humidity, water molecules are adsorbed in the channel and form complex hydrogen bond networks, shown as lightning. Astronauts moving easily along the channel represent the effective transport of protons: proton conductivity reached a maximum value of 2.63&#215;10&#8722;2&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1.

         <title>Cover Feature: Enantiodivergent Chemoenzymatic Dynamic Kinetic Resolution: Conversion of Racemic Propargyl Alcohols into Both Enantiomers (Chem. Eur. J. 60/2022)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 60, October 26, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A method for enantiodivergent production of S and R propargylic alcohols from their racemates by using commercial lipase&#8208;based dynamic kinetic resolution achieves quantitative conversion of the racemates into optically pure substances. The right and left hands, wearing jeweled rings indicating individual reaction steps, lead to opposite enantioselection, producing S and R alcohols, respectively. The order of the jewels is key to the enantioswitch. More information can be found in the Research Article by S. Akai and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202202437).

         <title>Chemistry of Pentafluorosulfanyl Derivatives and Related Analogs: From Synthesis to Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 60, October 26, 2022. </description>

SF6 building blocks: This review article summarizes the recent synthetic methodology dedicated to pentafluorosulfanyl derivatives and their related analogs. The properties and up&#8208;to&#8208;date applications in materials sciences and medicinal chemistry of SF5&#8208;containing compounds are also discussed here.







Abstract
Pentafluorosulfanyl (SF5)&#8208;containing compounds and corresponding analogs are a highly valuable class of fluorine&#8208;containing building blocks owing to their unique properties. The reason for that is the set of peculiar and tremendously beneficial characteristics they can impart on molecules once introduced onto them. Despite this, their application in distinct scientific fields remains modest, given the extremely harsh reaction conditions needed to access such compounds. The recent synthetic approaches via S&#8722;F, and C&#8722;SF5 bond formation as well as the use of SF5&#8208;containing building blocks embody a &#8220;stairway&#8208;to&#8208;heaven&#8221; loophole in the synthesis of otherwise&#8208;inaccessible chemical scaffolds only a few years ago. Herein, we report and evaluate the properties of the SF5 group and analogs, by summarizing synthetic methodologies available to access them as well as following applications in material science and medicinal chemistry since 2015.

         <dc:description>
The coordination chemistry of f&#8208;block elements in molten salts has become a resounding topic owing to fundamental interests and potential applications in molten salt reactors and pyroprocessing. This concept paper highlights the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art in the coordination chemistry of f&#8208;block elements in molten salts, which may advance understanding of the nature of molten salt fuels, coolants and electrolytes.







Abstract
The coordination chemistry of f&#8208;block elements (lanthanide and actinide) in molten salts has become a resounding topic in view of its great importance to the research and development (R&amp;D) of molten salt reactors and pyroprocessing. In this Review article, a general overview of the coordination chemistry of f&#8208;block elements in molten salts is provided including past achievements and recent advances. Particular emphases are placed on the oxidation state, speciation, and solution structure of f&#8208;block metal ions in molten salts, as well as their relationships with the salt composition. Furthermore, this review briefly discusses the spectroscopic and theoretical methods that complement each other in revealing the coordination properties.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A novel benign synthetic strategy towards soluble tetra( peri &#8208;naphthylene)anthracene (TPNA) decorated with triisopropylsilylethynyl substituents has been established. The compound is perfectly stable under ambient conditions in air and features intense and strongly bathochromically shifted UV/vis absorption and emission bands reaching to near&#8208;IR region beyond 900&#160;nm. Cyclic voltammetry measurements revealed four facilitated reversible redox events comprising two oxidations and two reductions. These remarkable experimental findings were corroborated by theoretical studies to identify the TPNA platform a particularly useful candidate for the development of functional near&#8208;IR fluorophores upon appropriate functionalization.</dc:description>

         <title>Optimization of G&#8208;Quadruplex Ligands through a SAR Study by Combining Parallel Synthesis and Screening of Cationic Bis(acylhydrazones)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>G&#8208;quadruplexes (G4s), secondary structures adopted by guanine&#8208;rich DNA and RNA sequences, are implicated in numerous biological processes and have been suggested as potential drug targets. Accordingly, there is an increasing interest in developing high&#8208;throughput methods allowing the generation of congeneric series of G4&#8208;targeting molecules (&#8220;ligands&#8221;) and investigation of their interaction with the targets. Here, we developed an operationally simple method of parallel synthesis to generate &#8220;ready&#8208;to&#8208;screen&#8221; libraries of cationic acylhydrazones, a motif that we have previously identified as a promising scaffold for potent, biologically active G4 ligands. Combined with well&#8208;established screening techniques, such as fluorescence melting, this method enables rapid synthesis and screening of combinatorial libraries of potential G4 ligands. Following this protocol, we synthesized a combinatorial library of 90 bis(acylhydrazones) and screened it against five different nucleic acid structures. This way, we were able to analyze the structure&#8211;activity relationships within this series of G4 ligands, and identified three novel promising ligands whose interaction with G4&#8208;DNA of different topologies was carefully studied by a combination of several biophysical techniques, including native mass spectrometry, and molecular modeling.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrostatic CH&#8208;&#960; Interactions Can Override Fluorine Gauche Effects to Exert Conformational Control</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fluorine gauche effects are conformational properties of 2fluoroethanes often applied in modern molecular designs. However, the physical origins of fluorine gauche effects are not well understood, with the consensus favoring the established hyperconjugation theory over an emerging electrostatic model. Using a series of model systems, we show that a shift to fluorine gauche effects can be influenced by intramolecular CH&#960; aromatic interactions, a throughspace event. Modulating the &#960;&#8208;ring (forming the aromatic interaction) with substituent groups resulted in a linear Hammett relationship, indicating the CH&#960; interaction has electrostatic features. For instance, attaching a nitro group (an electron&#8208;withdrawing substituent) to the &#960;&#8208;ring weakened the CH&#960; interaction and led to a gauche preference, whereas an anti conformer is preferred with amine as substituent. The experimental results performed using proton NMR spectroscopy are corroborated by gas&#8208;phase DFT calculations and solid&#8208;state X&#8208;ray crystallography</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Polysubstituted Symmetrical BODIPYs via Fischer Carbene Complexes: Theoretical, Photophysical and Electrochemical Evaluation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pyrrole polyfunctionalized core is obtained from Fischer alkynyl carbenes and oxazolones and used to obtain highly functionalized symmetric BODIPYs with modulating optoelectronic properties.







Abstract
A series of new symmetrical highly substituted BODIPYs 6&#8201;a&#8211;l was synthesized through a prefunctionalization approach in 35&#8201;%&#8211;89&#8201;% yields from the pyrrole core. This strategy allowed modulation of the substituents at the different positions based on the choice of Fischer's alkynyl carbenes, oxazolones and aldehydes used as precursors. The substituent variation at positions 2, 6, 3 and 5 had the greatest effect on the modulation of their photophysical properties such as absorption (&#955;abs) and emission (&#955;em) wavelengths, extinction coefficient (&#1013;), quantum yields (&#981;), Stokes shifts (&#916;&#957;), fluorescence decay, radiative (krad) and non&#8208;radiative (knr) constants and the CIE 1931 coordinates. Theoretical calculations allowed to corroborate the effect of the substituents of meso&#8208;position on the modification of the dihedral angles. Cyclic voltammetry studies revealed that the BODIPY series presents similar redox potential behavior, being electrochemically active even in successive cycles, which suggests that transport by diffusion is the dominant process.

         <title>Efficient Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Highly Stereoselective Synthesis of Unprotected C&#8208;Acyl Manno&#8208;, Rhamno&#8208; and Lyxopyranosides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Just a pinch of copper iodide promotes the reaction of manno&#8208;type glycosyl iodides with lithiated dithianes. Herein, we report an efficient and highly &#945;&#8208;selective four&#8208;step one&#8208;pot method for the synthesis of unprotected manno&#8208;type C&#8208;acyl pyranosides. The crucial role of the catalyst was proven by mechanistic studies and DFT calculations, suggesting a copper&#8208;radical mechanism over a SN&#8208;type mechanism.







Abstract
Due to their high stability towards enzymatic hydrolysis C&#8208;acyl glycosidic compounds are useful synthetic intermediates for potential candidates in drug discovery. Syntheses for C&#8208;acyl mannosides have remained scarce and usually employ donors obtained from lengthy syntheses. Furthermore, syntheses of unprotected C&#8208;acyl mannosides have not been reported so far, due to the incapability of the C&#8208;acyl mannoside motif with deprotection conditions for protective groups commonly used in carbohydrate chemistry. Herein, we report an efficient and highly &#945;&#8208;selective four&#8208;step one&#8208;pot method for the synthesis of C&#8208;acyl &#945;&#8208;d&#8208;manno&#8208;, l&#8208;rhamno&#8208; and d&#8208;lyxopyranosides from easily accessible persilylated monosaccharides and dithianes requiring only trace amounts of a copper source as catalyst and explain the crucial role of the catalyst by mechanistic studies. Furthermore, the C&#8208;acyl &#945;&#8208;glycosides were easily isomerized to give rapid access to their &#946;&#8208;anomers.

         <title>Mitochondrial Targeting and Imaging with Small Organic Conjugated Fluorophores: A Review</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A comprehensive overview on reported small molecule fluorophores exploited as mitochondrial imaging materials is carried out, with particular focus on the synthetic approaches used for the different chemistries, the photophysical characteristics of the probes and their cell biology evaluation.







Abstract
The last decade has seen an increasingly large number of studies reporting on the development of novel small organic conjugated systems for mitochondrial imaging exploiting optical signal transduction pathways. Mitochondria are known to play a critical role in a number of key biological processes, including cellular metabolism. Importantly, irregularities on their working function are nowadays understood to be intimately linked to a range of clinical conditions, highlighting the importance of targeting mitochondria for therapeutic benefits. In this work we carry out an in&#8208;depth evaluation on the progress to date in the field to pave the way for the realization of superior alternatives to those currently existing. The manuscript is structured by commonly used chemical scaffolds and comprehensively covers key aspects factored in design strategies such as synthetic approaches as well as photophysical and biological characterization, to foster collaborative work among organic and physical chemists as well as cell biologists.

         <title>Effective Iodine Capture Behavior by a Censer&#8208;shaped Macrocycle in Vapor Phase and Aqueous Solution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cyclotrixylohydroquinoylene (CTX) derivative, CTX[P(O)Ph], was reported as an efficient iodine adsorbent here. The CTX[P(O)Ph] powder exhibited high performance in both of iodine vapor adsorption and iodine aqueous solution adsorption. More importantly, two types of iodine loading crystal structures were obtained under different conditions to reveal the adsorption mechanism.







Abstract
Iodine capture is of great significance for disposal of the hazardous radioactive iodine. CTX[P(O)Ph], one kind of censer&#8208;shaped macrocycle cyclotrixylohydroquinoylene (CTX) derivatives, was applied as an efficient iodine adsorbent. It showed satisfactory iodine adsorption capacity in vapor phase and could be reused without obvious adsorption capacity loss. Besides, the adsorbent could also uptake iodine in water. Fortunately, two iodine loading CTX[P(O)Ph] crystal structures were obtained under different conditions to explore the mechanism of iodine adsorption. This work provides a relatively rare example of iodine adsorption by macrocycle. It is promising that the results with crystal information might be meaningful for exploring and designing new kinds of iodine adsorbents.

         <title>Revealing Phosphorus Nitrides up to the Megabar Regime: Synthesis of &#945;&#8242;&#8208;P3N5, &#948;&#8208;P3N5 and PN2</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>

For the last 30&#8197;years, the lack of a binary phosphorus nitride containing PN6 octahedra formed a scientific chasm between carbon&#8208;group and oxygen&#8208;group nitrides, both featuring a variety of solids with XN6 units (X being a non&#8208;metal element). Now, the discovery of the &#948;&#8208;P3N5 and PN2 phosphorus nitrides&#8212;formed under high pressure and both composed of the elusive PN6 octahedron&#8212;builds a long&#8208;sought&#8208;after bridge between these two groups of nitrides. More information can be found in the Research Article by D. Laniel, F. Trybel, and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202201998).

         <title>Gold&#8208;Catalyzed Divergent Ring&#8208;Opening Rearrangement of Cyclopropenes Enabled by Dichotomous Gold&#8722;Carbenes</title>

         <dc:description>
Two in One: A gold&#8208;catalyzed divergent ring&#8208;opening rearrangement of cyclopropenes has been developed for concise synthesis of structurally important polysubstituted naphthols and furans enabled by the dichotomous gold&#8722;carbenes. The use of different gold&#8208;catalysts allows for successful tuning of gold carbene reactivity or gold carbenoid reactivity in organic synthesis.







Abstract
The gold&#8208;catalyzed ring&#8208;opening rearrangement of cyclopropenes affords an efficient route to either polysubstituted naphthols or aryl&#8208;substituted furans. Owing to the unique dichotomy of gold&#8722;carbenes, this protocol provides a switchable reaction selectivity between naphthols and furans enabled by the use of TFP&#8722;Au(MeCN)SbF6 (tri(2&#8208;furyl) phosphine) or PNP(AuNTf2)2 (bis(diphenylphosphino)(isopropyl) amine) as catalysts respectively. It is proposed that the gold&#8722;carbene intermediate might be involved in the cyclopropene&#8594;naphthol rearrangement while the gold&#8208;carbocation is more likely to be involved in the cyclopropene&#8594;furan rearrangement.

         <title>Peri&#8208;Functionalized Tetraazaperylenes: Strong Emitters for Molecular Polaritonics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polaritonics with Peri Functionalized Tetraazaperylenes. Functionalization with electron donating groups leads to a class of highly fluorescent dyes, containing a tetraazaperylene core, which are excellent materials in strong light&#8208;matter coupling in resonant optical microcavities. This new class of functional dyes, whose properties can be simply tuned, showed fascinating behavior in molecular polaritonics.







Abstract
The functionalization of the peri position of the bay chlorinated tetraazaperylene was investigated by varying the donor behavior of the substituents to assess the resulting photophysical and electrochemical properties. To accomplish this, electron donating alkyl&#8208; and arylsulfido substituents, methoxy and methyl groups were selectively introduced into the peri position via a nucleophilic aromatic substitution of the perchlorinated tetraazaperylene. Both the alkylated and benzylated thioethers displayed high fluorescence quantum yields of up to 80&#8201;%. Compounds from the latter group were integrated in resonant optical microcavities to achieve strong light&#8208;matter coupling. The formation of exciton&#8208;polaritons was observed by angle&#8208;dependent reflectivity and photoluminescence that could be tuned by variation of the concentration of the fluorophores and of the thickness of the cavity.

         <title>Pushing the Limits of Nucleic Acid Function</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
DNA and RNA molecules are capable of a wide range of functions. Here I provide an overview of how nucleic acids with interesting and useful properties can be identified and optimized using artificial evolution. I also describe motifs that push the limits of DNA and RNA function in various ways. These examples highlight the remarkable functional potential of nucleic acids.







Abstract
For many decades it was thought that information storage and information transfer were the main functions of nucleic acids. However, artificial evolution experiments have shown that the functional potential of DNA and RNA is much greater. Here I provide an overview of this technique and highlight recent advances which have increased its potency. I also describe how artificial evolution has been used to identify nucleic acids with extreme functions. These include deoxyribozymes that generate unusual products such as light, tiny motifs made up of fewer than ten nucleotides, ribozymes that catalyze complex reactions such as RNA polymerization, information&#8208;rich sequences that encode overlapping ribozymes, motifs that catalyze reactions at rates too fast to be followed by manual pipetting, and functional nucleic acids which are active in extreme conditions. Such motifs highlight the limits of our knowledge and provide clues about as of yet undiscovered functions of DNA and RNA.

         <title>Fused Bis(hemi&#8208;indigo): Broad&#8208;Range Wavelength&#8208;Independent Photoswitches</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bis(hemi&#8208;indigo) derivatives are introduced as unique photoswitches with wavelength&#8208;independent isomeric ratios in photostationary states. The wavelength&#8208;independent photoswitching, high bistability and significant overlap between the photoswitch absorption and the solar spectrum make bis(hemi&#8208;indigo) derivatives interesting candidates for MOST applications.







Abstract
Wavelength&#8208;independent conversion of organic photoswitches in the photostationary state is a rare phenomenon that opens up a way for many practical applications. In this work, three fused bis(hemi&#8208;indigo) derivatives with different substitution patterns were synthesized and their photoswitching was investigated by optical spectroscopy, real&#8208;time NMR spectroscopy and TD&#8208;DFT calculations. We disclosed that the Z&#8208;E photoisomerization of the meta&#8208;bis(hemi&#8208;indigo) derivative was remarkably independent of the irradiation wavelength from UV up to yellow light. The wavelength&#8208;independent forward photoswitching together with the inhibited backward photoisomerization, high thermal stability of the photoinduced isomers as well as significant overlap between the photoswitch absorption and the solar spectrum allows to suggest bis(hemi&#8208;indigo) derivatives as promising candidates for molecular solar thermal energy storage (MOST) systems.

         <title>Labile Base&#8208;Stabilized Silyliumylidene Ions. Non&#8208;Metallic Species Capable of Activating Multiple Small Molecules</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Various base&#8208;stabilized silyliumylidene ions with different ligands were synthesized. Their behaviour appeared strongly dependent on the type of ligand. Indeed, in contrast to the poorly reactive silyliumylidenes stabilized by strongly donating ligands (DMAP, NHC), the sulfide&#8208;supported one (SMe2) exhibits higher reactivity toward various small molecules. Furthermore, their capability to successively activate multiple small molecules was clearly demonstrated by processes involving successive reactions with silane/formamide, CO2 and H2. Of particular interest, the silyliumylidene&#8208;silylene complex is one of the rare species able to activate two H2 molecules.







Abstract
Several base&#8208;stabilized silyliumylidene ions (2 and 3) with different ligands were synthesized. Their behaviour appeared strongly dependent on the nature of ligand. Indeed, in contrast to the poorly reactive silyliumylidene ions 3&#8201;c,d stabilized by strongly donating ligands (DMAP, NHC), the silylene&#8208; and sulfide&#8208;supported one (2&#8208;H and 3&#8201;a) exhibits higher reactivity toward various small molecules. Furthermore, their capability to successively activate multiple small molecules was clearly demonstrated by processes involving successive reactions with silane/formamide, CO2 and H2. Moreover, HBPin adduct of 3&#8201;a (8&#8208;C) catalyzes the hydroboration of pyridine. Of particular interest, silylene&#8208;supported silyliumylidene complex 2&#8208;H is one of the rare species able to activate two H2 molecules.

&lt;p&gt;Several base-stabilized silyliumylidene ions (&lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt;) with different ligands were synthesized. Their behaviour appeared strongly dependent on the nature of ligand.

         <title>A Piezo&#8208;Fenton System with Rapid Iron Cycling and Hydrogen Peroxide Self&#8208;Supply Driven by Ultrasound</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of g&#8208;C3N4&#8208;Fe was synthesized with varied Fe amount to construct a piezo&#8208;Fenton system driven by ultrasound, achieving the coupling of piezoelectric processes and Fenton reactions without exogenous hydrogen peroxide. Electrons generated in the piezoelectric process takes part in hydrogen peroxide production and accelerate the Fe2+/Fe3+ cycle. The piezo&#8208;Fenton system exhibited excellent and stable hydroxyl radical generating capacity in pH&#8197;2&#8211;9 without iron leaking, and the hydroxyl radicals mainly contributed to the degradation of MB and the sterilization process.







Abstract
The piezo&#8208;Fenton system has attracted attention not only because it can enhance the Fenton reaction activity by mechanical energy input, but also because it is expected to realize a class of stimuli&#8208;responsive advanced oxidation systems by regulating energy input and hydrogen peroxide self&#8208;supply, thus greatly enriching the application possibilities of Fenton chemistry. In this work, a series of Fe&#8208;doped g&#8208;C3N4 (g&#8208;C3N4&#8208;Fe) as a piezo&#8208;Fenton system were synthesized where the iron stably immobilized through Fe&#8722;N interaction. The piezo&#8208;induced electrons generate on g&#8208;C3N4 matrix support the conversion of Fe(III) to Fe(II) and promote rate&#8208;limiting step of Fenton reaction. With the optimal Fe loading, g&#8208;C3N4&#8208;0.5Fe can achieve methylene blue (MB) degradation under ultrasonic treatment with first&#8208;order kinetic rate constants of 75&#215;10&#8722;3&#8197;min&#8722;1. Most importantly, the g&#8208;C3N4&#8208;Fe can maintain good catalytic activity in a wide pH range (pH=2.0&#8764;9.0) and be cyclic used without iron leaching to solution (&lt;0.001&#8197;&#956;g&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;L&#8722;1), overcoming the disadvantage of traditional Fe&#8208;based Fenton catalysts that can only be applied under acidic conditions and prone to secondary pollution. In addition, g&#8208;C3N4&#8208;0.5Fe also exhibits antibacterial properties of Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus under ultrasound. Hydroxyl radicals mainly contribute to the degradation of MB and the sterilization process. Our work is an attempt to clarify the role of g&#8208;C3N4&#8208;Fe in the conversion of mechanical energy to ROS and provide inspirations for the piezo&#8208;Fenton system design.

         <title>Binding of Glycans to the SARS CoV&#8208;2 Spike Protein, an Open Question: NMR Data on Binding Site Localization, Affinity, and Selectivity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sweet, but not so sweet. The SARS CoV&#8208;2 spike glycoprotein engages in weak interactions with sialoglycans, but binding to ABO(H) blood group antigens cannot be confirmed by STD NMR experiments. Chemical shift perturbation experiments show that none of the glycans interacts with the receptor binding domain of the spike glycoprotein.







Abstract
We have used NMR experiments to explore the binding of selected glycans and glycomimetics to the SARS CoV&#8208;2 spike glycoprotein (S&#8208;protein) and to its receptor binding domain (RBD). STD NMR experiments confirm the binding of sialoglycans to the S&#8208;protein of the prototypic Wuhan strain virus and yield dissociation constants in the millimolar range. The absence of STD effects for sialoglycans in the presence of the Omicron/BA.1 S&#8208;protein reflects a loss of binding as a result of S&#8208;protein evolution. Likewise, no STD effects are observed for the deletion mutant &#916;143&#8211;145 of the Wuhan S&#8208;protein, thus supporting localization of the binding site in the N&#8208;terminal domain (NTD). The glycomimetics Oseltamivir and Zanamivir bind weakly to the S&#8208;protein of both virus strains. Binding of blood group antigens to the Wuhan S&#8208;protein cannot be confirmed by STD NMR. Using 1H,15N TROSY HSQC&#8208;based chemical shift perturbation (CSP) experiments, we excluded binding of any of the ligands studied to the RBD of the Wuhan S&#8208;protein. Our results put reported data on glycan binding into perspective and shed new light on the potential role of glycan&#8208;binding to the S&#8208;protein.

A single pentagon defect in a single&#8208;layered graphene catalyst is emphasized next to a control structure (pentagon ring passivated by oxygen). The small molecules near the defect represent the reactant and intermediate product of the oxygen reduction reaction. Lightning around the graphene indicates how the pentagon defect was fabricated with electro&#8208;assistance and the oxygen reduction reaction was driven by electrical energy. More information on identifying the catalyst's precise active site can be found in the Research Article by F. Qiu, L. Zhang, and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202202700).

         <dc:description>The concept of preorganization is famous in coordination chemistry for having transformed flexible bidentate 2,2&#8217;&#8208;bipyridine scaffolds into rigid 1,10&#8208;phenanthroline platforms. The resulting boosted affinities for d&#8208;block cations successfully paved the way for the design of a wealth of functional complexes, devices and materials for analysis and optics. Its extension toward terdentate homologues adapted for the selective complexation of f&#8208;block cations with larger coordination numbers remains more confidential. The hereby rigidification of 2,6&#8208;bis(1&#8208;methyl&#8208;1H&#8208;benzo[d]imidazol&#8208;2&#8208;yl)pyridine ligands (  L1&#8208;L7  ) produces the highly preorganized and extended polyaromatic naphthyridines (  L8  &#8208;  L11  ) receptors, which offer some novel and rare opportunities for efficiently complexing trivalent lanthanides with polyaromatic soft terimine ligands. The crystal structures of the stable heteroleptic [  L  k  Ln(hfac)  3  ] adducts show a drastic decrease of the Ln&#8208;N bond valences upon replacement of the flexible ligand  L1  with its preorganized counterparts  L8  and  L9  . This points to an inconveniencing and limited match between the preorganized cavity and the entering [Ln(hfac)  3  ] lanthanide containers. However, thermodynamic studies conducted in dichloromethane reach the opposite conclusion with an improved affinity, by up to three orders of magnitude for catching Ln(hfac)  3  when  L1  is replaced by the preorganized  L8  &#8208;  L9  receptors. The key to the enigma lies in the removal of the energy penalty which accompanies the formation of flexible [  L1  Ln(hfac)  3  ] complexes in solution.&#160; As planned, the rigid, planar and extended  p  &#8208;conjugated system found in  L8  and  L9  shifts the ligand&#8208;centered absorption bands&#160; toward lower energies.</dc:description>

         <title>Going Viral: An Investigation into the Chameleonic Behavior or Antiviral Compounds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The ability to adjust conformations in response to the polarity of the environment, i.e. molecular chameleonicity, is considered to be important for conferring both high aqueous solubility and high cell permeability to drugs in chemical space beyond Lipinski&#8217;s rule of 5. We determined the conformational ensembles populated by the antiviral drugs asunaprevir, simeprevir, atazanavir and daclatasvir in polar (DMSO&#8208;  d  6  ) and non&#8208;polar (chloroform) environments with NMR spectroscopy. Daclatasvir was fairly rigid, whereas the first three showed large flexibility in both environments, that translated into major differences in solvent accessible 3D polar surface area within each conformational ensemble. No significant differences in size and polar surface area were observed between the DMSO&#8208;  d  6  and chloroform ensembles of these three drugs. We propose that such flexible compounds are characterized as &#8220;partial molecular chameleons&#8221; and hypothesize that their ability to adopt conformations with low polar surface area contributes to their membrane permeability and oral absorption.</dc:description>

         <title>Specific Lipid Studies in Complex Membranes by Solid&#8208;State NMR Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Specific lipid interaction in complex membranes: Specific interactions with lipids are critical for proteins and drugs, however, direct structural measurements of interactions with lipids remain difficult, especially in membranes that mimic biological conditions. Here, a broadly applicable solid&#8208;state NMR approach is presented that enables to directly measure specific interactions with lipids such as cardiolipin in complex fluid membranes.







Abstract
Specific interactions with phospholipids are often critical for the function of proteins or drugs, but studying these interactions at high resolution remains difficult, especially in complex membranes that mimic biological conditions. In principle, molecular interactions with phospholipids could be directly probed by solid&#8208;state NMR (ssNMR). However, due to the challenge to detect specific lipids in mixed liposomes and limited spectral sensitivity, ssNMR studies of specific lipids in complex membranes are scarce. Here, by using purified biological 13C,15N&#8208;labeled phospholipids, we show that we can selectively detect traces of specific lipids in complex membranes. In combination with 1H&#8208;detected ssNMR, we show that our approach provides unprecedented high&#8208;resolution insights into the mechanisms of drugs that target specific lipids. This broadly applicable approach opens new opportunities for the molecular characterization of specific lipid interactions with proteins or drugs in complex fluid membranes.

Enabling semiconducting properties in N&#8208;acenoacenes. Reducing the steric demand of N&#8208;acenoacenes tunes the solid&#8208;state packings of N&#8208;acenoacenes in favor of &#960;&#8211;&#960;&#8208;stacking, allowing charge transfer through the crystal lattice. The first utilization of N&#8208;acenoacenes in p&#8208;type organic thin&#8208;film transistors is reported.







Abstract
Four N&#8208;acenoacenes were synthesized and analyzed for their optoelectronic properties and solid&#8208;state packings. Two of the regioisomeric acridinoacridines are TIPS&#8208;ethynylated, whereas the other pair are Boc&#8208; and triflate substituted derivatives. The two TIPS&#8208;ethynyldiazaacenoacenes were processed into organic thin&#8208;film transistors with saturation hole mobilities reaching 2.9&#215;10&#8722;2&#8197;cm2(Vs)&#8722;1.

         <title>Near&#8208;Infrared Electrochromic Behavior of Dibenzothiepin Derivatives Attached with Two Michler's Hydrol Blue Units</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dibenzothiepin&#8208;based redox pair and its analogues exhibit an electrochomic behavior with drastic change in the UV&#8208;Vis&#8208;NIR absorption, thus suitable for developing new bioimaging protocols. The structural change of the central seven&#8208;membered ring was found to be the key to gain electrochemical bistability upon two&#8208;electron transfer nearly at the same potential.







Abstract
10,11&#8208;Bis[bis(4&#8208;dimethylaminophenyl)methylene]dibenzo[bf]thiepin (1) and &#8208;oxepin (2) were prepared as stable yellow crystalline compounds, which are the cyclic analogues of electron&#8208;donating hexaarylbutadienes. Upon two&#8208;electron oxidation, they are reversibly transformed into the title dications (12+ and 22+) exhibiting near&#8208;infrared (NIR) absorptions, which were also isolated as stable salts. These redox pairs can serve as new entries into less well&#8208;explored organic NIR&#8208;electrochromic systems, and the separation of redox peaks (electrochemical bistability) was attained for 1/12+ and 2/22+, thanks to drastic geometrical changes between neutral and dicationic states, as revealed by a series of X&#8208;ray analyses. Thiepin&#8208;S,S&#8208;dioxide analogue (3/32+) exhibits quite similar dynamic redox behavior due to nonaromatic nature of the dibenzothiepin and &#8208;oxepin unit in 12+ and 22+, whereas the thiepin&#8208;S&#8208;oxide derivative (4/42+) does not exhibit bistability due to the smaller change in geometry upon electron transfer, showing that a subtle change of a bridging atom in the central seven&#8208;membered ring can modify the redox properties.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new inhibitor of ATP synthase: Through photoaffinity labelling and chemoproteomics analysis it was discovered, and subsequently validated, that phomoxanthone A is an inhibitor of ATP synthase. This discovery may inspire the design of new inhibitors targeting the beta subunit of ATP synthase.

Phomoxanthone A is a naturally occurring molecule and a powerful anti&#8208;cancer agent, although its mechanism of action is unknown. To facilitate the determination of its biological target(s), we used affinity&#8208;based labelling using a phomoxanthone A probe. Labelled proteins were pulled down, subjected to chemoproteomics analysis using LC&#8208;MS/MS and ATP synthase was identified as a likely target. Mitochondrial ATP synthase was validated in cultured cells lysates and in live intact cells. Our studies show sixty percent inhibition of ATP synthase by 260&#8197;&#956;M phomoxanthone&#8197;A.

         <title>Synthetic Studies towards the Calcium&#8208;Dependent Lipopeptide Antibiotic Cadaside B</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cadaside B is a novel calcium&#8208;dependent lipopeptide antibiotic, bearing multiple rare non&#8208;canonical amino acids and exhibiting potent antimicrobial activity towards multi&#8208;drug resistant Gram&#8208;positive pathogens. Synthetic studies towards cadaside B yielded a compound possessing the desired connectivity of macrocyclic scaffold, but poorly matching 1H NMR spectra and lack of bioactivity. Insights and challenges towards the total synthesis are presented.







Abstract
In the current global crisis of antimicrobial resistance, antimicrobial peptides represent a promising source of alternative antibiotics. Recently discovered cadaside B, a novel calcium&#8208;dependent antibiotic, exhibits potent antimicrobial activity towards Gram&#8208;positive pathogens including multi&#8208;drug resistant strains. These properties, coupled with a novel structure, non&#8208;cytotoxicity, and low likelihood of developing resistance render cadaside B an important synthetic target. Herein, a synthetic strategy towards cadaside B is reported with the key steps involving on&#8208;resin depsipeptide bond formation and solution&#8208;phase macrolactamization. Good agreement of the synthetic cadaside B MS/MS fragmentation pattern was observed with the natural product, but a different 1H NMR spectrum and absence of antimicrobial activity suggest an undetected epimerization event took place during the synthesis. Herein the findings of our synthetic journey and suggestions for future directions are presented.

         <title>Unveiling the Potential of Innovative Gold(I) and Silver(I) Selenourea Complexes as Anticancer Agents Targeting TrxR and Cellular Redox Homeostasis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Innovative Au(I) and Ag(I) NHC&#8208;based selenourea complexes exhibit a prominent anticancer effect by selectively targeting TrxR in human cancer cells, thus hampering cancer cell redox machinery and inducing apoptotic cell death.







Abstract
A series of NHC&#8208;based selenourea Ag(I) and Au(I) complexes were evaluated for their anticancer potential in&#8197;vitro, on 2D and 3D human cancer cell systems. All NHC&#8208;based selenourea complexes possess an outstanding cytotoxic potency, which was comparable or even better than that of the reference metallodrug auranofin, and were also able to overcome both platinum&#8208;based and multi&#8208;drug resistances. Intriguingly, their cytotoxic potency did not correlate with solution stability, partition coefficient or cellular uptake. On the other hand, mechanistic studies in cancer cells revealed their ability to strongly and selectively inhibit the redox&#8208;regulating enzyme Thioredoxin Reductase (TrxR), being even more effective than auranofin, a well&#8208;known TrxR inhibitor, without affecting other redox enzymes such as Glutathione Reductase (GR). The inhibition of TrxR in H157 human cancer cells caused, in turn, the disruption of cellular thiol&#8208;redox homeostasis and of mitochondria pathophysiology, ultimately leading to cancer cell death through apoptosis.

         <title>An Optimized Ni&#8208;catalyzed Chan&#8208;Lam Type Coupling: Enantioretentive Access to Chiral N&#8208;Aryl Sulfinamides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An optimized Ni&#8208;catalyzed Chan&#8208;Lam type coupling reaction was optimized. A series of chiral N&#8208;aryl sulfinamides was prepared with high chemical yield without any racemization. A plausible and novel mechanism was proposed and this method is useful for preparing various C&#8722;X bonds efficiently.







Abstract
C&#8722;N bond formation takes on a critical significance in reactions of organic synthesis, material production and pharmaceutical manufactory. Chan&#8208;Lam has proposed a useful methodology to furnish secondary arylamides under mild conditions. However, when chiral sulfinamides serve as the coupling precursors, the Cu&#8208;catalyzed coupling reaction is found with low efficacy. Complex side&#8208;products are generated under classic conditions. Moreover, it led to the racemization of the coupling product. In this study, an optimized Ni&#8208;catalyzed Chan&#8208;Lam type coupling conditions were proposed, which resulted in clean conversion from chiral sulfinamides and arylboronic acids to offer N&#8208;aryl sulfinamides efficiently and enantioretentively. The trans&#8208;N1,N2&#8208;dimethylcyclohexane&#8208;1,2&#8208;diamine was proven as the most efficient ligand. Under the optimized conditions, a series of chiral N&#8208;aryl sulfinamides was prepared with high chemical yield without racemization. Furthermore, a plausible and novel mechanism was proposed. Interestingly, the method could efficiently furnish a wide variety of C&#8722;X bonds by coupling arylboronic acids with different nucleophiles.

         <title>Electrophotochemical Metal&#8208;Catalyzed Decarboxylative Coupling of Aliphatic Carboxylic Acids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Convergent paired metal electrocatalysis enables the direct use of simple primary and secondary aliphatic acids as coupling partners for C(sp2)&#8722;C(sp3) bond formation by radical decarboxylation. This new electrophotocatalytic method features a broad substrate scope, wide functional&#8208;group tolerance, and could be used for late&#8208;stage functionalization of complex molecules.







Abstract
An electrophotochemical dual metal&#8208;catalyzed protocol for decarboxylative arylation of simple aliphatic carboxylic acids with aryl halides is reported. The relative stabilities of catalytically active metal complexes simultaneously generated at anode and cathode are the key design elements for the success of this convergent paired electrolysis. This new electrophotocatalytic method is mild, robust, and most importantly, capable of accommodating simple primary aliphatic acids including acetic acid &#8211; ubiquitous and variegated structural motifs yet remain oddly challenging substrates &#8211; directly as native functional groups for decarboxylative C(sp2)&#8722;C(sp3) bond formation.

         <title>Pillararene&#8208;Based Supramolecular Vesicles for Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Drug Delivery</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pillararene&#8208;based supramolecular vesicles are self&#8208;assembled from the supra&#8208;amphiphiles, consisting of macrocyclic hosts pillararenes and amphiphilic guests linked together through noncovalent interactions, and are endowed with the stimuli&#8208;responsive controlled release performances for use in smart drug delivery. The background of the graphic matches the120th anniversary of Nanjing University (NJU).







Abstract
Supramolecular vesicles (SMVs) self&#8208;assembled from the supra&#8208;amphiphiles, consisting of two scaffolds linked together through noncovalent interactions, can realize stimuli&#8208;responsive controlled release of encapsulated drugs for enhanced therapeutic efficacy and minimized side effect of drugs. Pillararenes (PAs), an emerging kind of macrocyclic hosts in 2008, are easy to modify with a variety of functionalities. SMVs from PAs and specific guests mainly based on the host&#8211;guest interactions have attracted increasing attention because of their drug delivery and controlled drug release. A great progress in the construction and stimuli&#8208;responsive drug delivery of the PA&#8208;based SMVs has been made since the first work was reported in 2012. This review summarizes the major achievements of the PA&#8208;based SMVs for stimuli&#8208;responsive drug delivery over the past 5&#8197;years, including the microstructures of SMVs, multiple stimuli&#8208;responsive SMVs, prodrug SMVs from prodrug PAs and guests, bola&#8208;type SMVs, multifunctional SMVs, glucose&#8208;responsive SMVs for insulin delivery, novel SMVs from responsive PAs, thermo&#8208;responsive SMVs, and ternary SMVs, for chemotherapy, photothermal therapy, photodynamic therapy, and other biological applications. The future challenges and research directions of PA&#8208;based SMVs are also outlined from the points of views of the fundamental research, biological applications, and clinical applications of PA&#8208;based SMVs.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Pillararene-based supramolecular vesicles&lt;/b&gt; are self-assembled from the supra-amphiphiles, consisting of macrocyclic hosts pillararenes and amphiphilic guests linked together through noncovalent interactions, and are endowed with the stimuli-responsive controlled release performances for use in smart drug delivery. The background of the graphic matches the120&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; anniversary of Nanjing University (NJU).

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Supramolecular vesicles (SMVs) self-assembled from the supra-amphiphiles, consisting of two scaffolds linked together through noncovalent interactions, can realize stimuli-responsive controlled release of encapsulated drugs for enhanced therapeutic efficacy and minimized side effect of drugs. Pillararenes (PAs), an emerging kind of macrocyclic hosts in 2008, are easy to modify with a variety of functionalities. SMVs from PAs and specific guests mainly based on the host&#8211;guest interactions have attracted increasing attention because of their drug delivery and controlled drug release. A great progress in the construction and stimuli-responsive drug delivery of the PA-based SMVs has been made since the first work was reported in 2012. This review summarizes the major achievements of the PA-based SMVs for stimuli-responsive drug delivery over the past 5&#8197;years, including the microstructures of SMVs, multiple stimuli-responsive SMVs, prodrug SMVs from prodrug PAs and guests, bola-type SMVs, multifunctional SMVs, glucose-responsive SMVs for insulin delivery, novel SMVs from responsive PAs, thermo-responsive SMVs, and ternary SMVs, for chemotherapy, photothermal therapy, photodynamic therapy, and other biological applications. The future challenges and research directions of PA-based SMVs are also outlined from the points of views of the fundamental research, biological applications, and clinical applications of PA-based SMVs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

A facile and environmentally friendly electrochemical protocol is herein reported for the C(sp2)&#8722;C(sp3) cross dehydrogenative coupling between imidazopyridines and N,N&#8208;dimethylanilines.







Abstract
A facile and environmentally friendly electrochemical protocol is herein reported for the C(sp2)&#8722;C(sp3) cross dehydrogenative coupling between imidazopyridines and N,N&#8208;dimethylanilines. The broad functional group compatibility includes halogens, ester, alcohol, sulfone as well as thiophene. This methodology is also suitable for benzo[d]imidazo[2,1&#8208;b]thiazole, thiazoimidazole and tetrahydroisoquinoline, and can be scaled up to 5&#8197;mmol. Mechanistic insights are discussed.

         <title>The Radical Anion, Dianion and Electron Transport Properties of Tetraiodotetraazapentacene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Filling the gap in the series of halogenated azaacenes. Tetraiodotetraazapentacene I4TAP is prepared and characterized. Its stable radical anion and high mobilities in organic field&#8208;effect transistors make I4TAP a formidable n&#8208;type semiconductor.







Abstract
Tetraiodotetraazapentacene I4TAP, the last missing derivative in the series of halogenated silylated tetraazapentacenes, was synthesized via condensation chemistry from a TIPS&#8208;ethynylated diaminobenzothiadiazol in three steps. Single and double reduction furnished its air&#8208;stable monoanion and relatively air&#8208;stable dianion, both of which were characterized by crystallography. All three species are structurally and spectroscopically compared to non&#8208;halogenated TAP and Br4TAP. I4TAP is an n&#8208;channel material in thin&#8208;film transistors with average electron mobilities exceeding 1&#8197;cm2 (Vs)&#8722;1.

         <title>Computational Insights into the Catalytic Mechanism of Is&#8208;PETase: An Enzyme Capable of Degrading Poly(ethylene) Terephthalate</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The enzyme is&#8208;PETase degrades poly(ethylene) terephthalate (PET) at mesophilic temperatures. This makes is&#8208;PETase a promising candidate for the biodegradation of this common pollutant. The energy profile for the degradation of a PET substrate mimic by is&#8208;PETase was calculated by using computational quantum&#8208;mechanical/molecular mechanical methods, and the activation energy for this reaction was calculated to be 34.1&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1.







Abstract
Is&#8208;PETase has become an enzyme of significant interest due to its ability to catalyse the degradation of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) at mesophilic temperatures. We performed hybrid quantum mechanics and molecular mechanics (QM/MM) at the DSD&#8208;PBEP86&#8208;D3/ma&#8208;def2&#8208;TZVP/CHARMM27//rev&#8208;PBE&#8208;D3/dev2&#8208;SVP/CHARMM level to calculate the energy profile for the degradation of a suitable PET model by this enzyme. Very low overall barriers are computed for serine protease&#8208;type hydrolysis steps (as low as 34.1&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1). Spontaneous deprotonation of the final product, terephthalic acid, with a high computed driving force indicates that product release could be rate limiting.

         <title>Single&#8208;Metal&#8208;Encapsulated Double&#8208;Cage [Pt@Sn17]4&#8722;: An Exception from Group 14 Endohedral Clusters</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Asymmetrical fusion of two inhomogeneous building units [Pt@Sn9] and [Sn9] leads to the largest group&#8197;14 intermetalloid cluster [Pt@Sn17]4&#8722; encapsulating a single transition metal atom. The unusual double&#8208;cage structure could be seen as a result of the collapse of the capsule&#8208;like Sn17 framework when filled with only one Pt atom.







Abstract
Group&#8197;14 endohedral clusters containing a metal center inside usually possess a single cage topological structure, but here an unexpected single&#8208;metal&#8208;filled double&#8208;cage cluster, [Pt@Sn17]4&#8722; (1&#8201;a) is reported. It can be seen as a combination of the more extended Pt&#8208;filled [Pt@Sn9] cage and hollow [Sn9] cage sharing a central Sn atom, which is offset from the central position. This double&#8208;cage species represents the largest group&#8197;14 intermetalloid cluster encapsulating a single transition metal atom. DFT calculations show that the capsule&#8208;like architecture of [Sn17]4&#8722;, similar to that found in [Pt2@Sn17]4&#8722;, is unstable if filled with a single Pt atom and collapses to the title cluster 1&#8201;a upon geometry optimization. Deviation of the central Sn atom occurs due to the vibronic coupling as a consequence of pseudo&#8208;Jahn&#8208;Teller distortion leading to the bent Cs&#8208;symmetrical structure, in contrast to the more symmetrical D2d cage previously reported in [Ni2@Sn17]4&#8722;.

         <title>Phosphorescent Bimetallic C^C* Platinum(ii) Complexes with Bridging Substituted Diphenylformamidinates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis and characterization of bimetallic C^C* platinum(II) complexes with bridging diphenylformamidinates is presented alongside with two solid&#8208;state structures. The phosphorescent compounds show excellent emissive behavior with quantum yields of up to 90&#8201;% and lifetimes around 2&#8197;&#956;s. The substitution pattern in the bridging ligands influences next to the structural properties (intermetallic distance) also the photophysical characteristics.

A series of phosphorescent bimetallic platinum(II) complexes is presented, which were synthesized by the combination of bidentate cyclometalated N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene ligands and different bridging diphenylformamidinates. The complexes were characterized by standard techniques and additionally two solid&#8208;state structures could be obtained. Photoluminescence measurements revealed the strong emissive behavior of the compounds with quantum yields of up to 90&#8201;% and emission lifetimes of approx. 2&#8197;&#956;s. The effect of the substitution pattern in the bridging ligands on the structural and photophysical properties of the complexes was examined in detail and rationalized by density functional theory calculations (PBE0/6&#8208;311G*).

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The synthesis and characterization&lt;/b&gt; of bimetallic C^C* platinum(II) complexes with bridging diphenylformamidinates is presented alongside with two solid-state structures. The phosphorescent compounds show excellent emissive behavior with quantum yields of up to 90&#8201;% and lifetimes around 2&#8197;&#956;s. The substitution pattern in the bridging ligands influences next to the structural properties (intermetallic distance) also the photophysical characteristics. The observed effects are explained and supported by density functional theory calculations.

What can you give? Reactivity studies of the L(Cl)Ge&#8901;BH3 complex were performed to determine the effect of GeII&#8594;B donation. An unprecedented GeII&#8594;Ga complex L(Cl)Ge&#8901;GaCl3 was isolated. The different strength of the GeII&#8594;E (E=B, Ga) donation was evaluated by using energy decomposition analysis (EDA) and proton affinity.







Abstract
Reactivity studies of the GeII&#8594;B complex L(Cl)Ge&#8901;BH3 (1; L=2&#8208;Et2NCH2&#8208;4,6&#8208;tBu2&#8208;C6H2) were performed to determine the effect on the GeII&#8594;B donation. N&#8208;coordinated compounds L(OtBu)Ge&#8901;BH3 (2) and [LGe&#8901;BH3]2 (3) were prepared. The possible tuning of the GeII&#8594;B interaction was proved experimentally, yielding compounds 1&#8208;PPh2&#8208;8&#8208;(LGe)&#8208;C10H6 (4) and L(Cl)Ge&#8901;GaCl3 (5) without a GeII&#8594;B interaction. In 5, an unprecedented GeII&#8594;Ga coordination was revealed. The experimental results were complemented by a theoretical study focusing on the bonding in 1&#8722;5. The different strength of the GeII&#8594;E (E=B, Ga) donation was evaluated by using energy decomposition analysis. The basicity of different L(X)Ge groups through proton affinity is also assessed.

         <title>Inducing Propeller Chirality in Triaryl Boranes with Chiral Amines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A three&#8208;point interaction between a chiral amine and a triarylborane is shown to suffice to induce a preferential propeller handedness to the borane. Rotation of aryl blades can be avoided by incorporation of naphthyl instead of phenyl and a bulky amine component.







Abstract
Stabilization of chiral propeller conformations in triaryl compounds is challenging due to generally low racemization barriers. Nonetheless, it was recently found that chiral conformational preferences can be induced to triaryl boranes by incorporating point&#8208;chiral alkylether chains to the aryl blades and subsequently locking the structure with ammonia. A four&#8208;point interaction, meaning that the cooperative effects of Lewis&#8208;adduct formation and three hydrogen bonds, was proposed as stabilizing mechanism. Herein, it was shown that three such strong interactions suffice to introduce a preferential propeller handedness. Although DFT calculations predict no noteworthy preferences for either P&#8208; or M&#8208;chiral propellers for some of the investigated triarylborane&#8211;amine adducts that were prepared with chiral primary amines, vibrational circular dichroism (VCD) spectroscopic characterizations revealed that there is indeed a measurable excess of one propeller handedness. Furthermore, the steric demand of the amine was found to play a key role in the induction process and especially in preventing blade rotations.

         <dc:description>A visible light organophotocatalytic [2+2] cycloaddition of electron&#8208;deficient styrenes is described. Photocatalytic [2+2] cycloadditions are typically performed with electron&#8208;rich styrene derivatives or &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated alkenes, and with transition&#8208;metal&#8208;based catalysts. We have discovered that an organic cyanoarene photocatalyst is able to deliver high&#8208;value cyclobutane products bearing electron&#8208;deficient aryl substituents in good yields. A range of electron&#8208;deficient substituents are tolerated and both homodimerizations and intramolecular [2+2] cycloadditions to fused bicyclic systems are available using this methodology.</dc:description>

         <title>Experimentally Calibrated Computational Prediction Enables Accurate Fine&#8208;Tuning of Near&#8208;Infrared Rhodamines for Multiplexing</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A significant barrier inhibiting multiplexed imaging in the near&#8208;infrared (NIR) is the extensive trial and error associated with fine&#8208;tuning NIR dyes. In particular, the need to synthesize and experimentally evaluate dye derivatives in order to empirically identify those that can be used in multiplexing applications, requires a large investment of time. While coarse&#8208;tuning efforts benefit from computational prediction that can be used to identify target dye structures for synthetic campaigns, errors in computational prediction remain too large to accurately parse modifications aimed at fine&#8208;tuning changes in dye absorbance and emission. To address this issue, we screened different levels of theory and identified a time&#8208;dependent density functional theory (TD&#8208;DFT) approach that can rapidly, as opposed to synthesis and experimental evaluation, estimate absorbance and emission. By calibrating these computational estimations of absorbance and emission to experimentally determined parameters for a panel of existing NIR dyes, we obtain calibration curves that can be used to accurately predict the effect of fine&#8208;tuning modifications in new dyes. We demonstrate the predictive power of this calibrated dataset using seven previously unreported dyes, obtaining mean percent errors in absorbance and emission of 2.2 and 2.8%, respectively. This approach provides a significant timesavings, relative to synthesis and evaluation of dye derivatives, and can be used to focus synthetic campaigns on the most promising dye structures. The new dyes described herein can be utilized for multiplexed imaging, and the experimentally calibrated dataset will provide the dye chemistry community with a means to rapidly identify fine&#8208;tuned NIR dyes in silico to guide subsequent synthetic campaigns.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The polarization modulation of deep&#8208;UV light is an important process that incorporates functionality to selectively respond to light&#8208;mater interaction. Typically, optical anisotropy is foremost to the use efficiency of deep&#8208;UV birefringent crystals. Herein, a new congruently melting polyborate with extremely large birefringence (&#916;  n  (001)  = 0.14@589.3 nm) and band gap (6.89 eV) is discovered as a high performance birefringent crystal, which breaks the current deadlock of deep&#8208;UV polyborates that usually show small birefringence. The rigid tetrahedra, including [ZnO  4  ] and edge&#8208;sharing [BO  4  ] tetrahedra, make all the planar [BO  3  ] triangles in the lattice adopt preferential arrangement and thereby lead to an extraordinary large birefringence that is larger than all the deep&#8208;UV borates with experimentally measured values. Structural analyses with the additional theoretical calculations were used to study the origin of strong optical anisotropy in BaZnB  4  O  8  .</dc:description>

         <title>Dioxygen Splitting by a Tantalum(V) Complex Ligated by a Rigid, Redox Non&#8208;innocent Pincer Ligand</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Reaction of TaMe3Cl2 with a rigid acridane&#8208;derived trisamine H3NNN yields the tantalum(V) complex [TaCl2(NNNcat)]. Subsequent reaction with dioxygen results in the full four&#8208;electron reduction of O2 yielding the oxo&#8208;bridged bimetallic complex [{TaCl2(NNNsq)}2O]. This dinuclear complex exhibits an open&#8208;shell ground state due to partial ligand oxidation and was comprehensively characterized by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, LIFDI mass spectrometry, NMR, EPR, IR and UV/VIS/NIR spectroscopy. The mechanism of O2 activation was investigated by DFT calculations revealing initial binding of O2 to the tantalum(V) center followed by complete O2 scission to produce a terminal oxo&#8208;complex.</dc:description>

         <title>Hydrogen Bonded Foldamers with Axial Chirality: Chiroptical Properties and Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Folding phenomenon refers to the formation of specific conformation widely featured by the intramolecular interactions, which widely exists in biomacromolecules, and are closely related to their structures and functions. A variety of oligomeric folded molecules have been designed and synthesized, namely "foldamer", exhibiting potentials in the pharmaceutical and catalysis. Molecular folding is a promising strategy to transfer chirality from substituents to the whole skeleton, when the chirality transfer, amplification, evolution and other behaviors could be achieved. Investigating chirality using foldamer model deepens the understanding of structure&#8208;function correlation in biomacromolecules, and expands the molecular toolbox towards chiroptical and asymmetrical chemistry. Substitutes with abundant hydrogen bonding sites conjugated to a rotatable aryl group afford parallel &#946;&#8208;sheet&#8208;like conformation, which enables the emergence and manipulation of axial chirality. In this concept, we aim to give a brief introduction and summary of the hydrogen bonded foldamers with anchored axial chirality, by taking some recent cases as examples. The design principles, control over axial chirality and applications are also reviewed.</dc:description>

         <title>Optical Manipulation of Gb3 Enriched Lipid Domains: Impact of Isomerization on Gb3&#8208;Shiga Toxin B Interaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The plasma membrane is a complex assembly of proteins and lipids that can self&#8208;assemble in submicroscopic domains commonly termed &#8220;lipid rafts&#8221;, which are implicated in membrane signaling and trafficking. Recently, photo&#8208;sensitive lipids were introduced to study membrane domain organization, and photo&#8208;isomerization was shown to trigger the mixing and de&#8208;mixing of liquid&#8208;ordered (lo) domains in artificial phase&#8208;separated membranes.
Here, we synthesized globotriaosylceramide (Gb3) glycosphingolipids that harbor an azobenzene moiety at different positions of the fatty acid to investigate light&#8208;induced membrane domain reorganization, and that serve as specific receptors for the protein Shiga toxin (STx). Using phase&#8208;separated supported lipid bilayers on mica surfaces doped with four different photo&#8208;Gb3 molecules, we found by fluorescence microscopy and atomic force microscopy that liquid disordered (ld) domains were formed within lo domains upon trans&#8208;cis photo&#8208;isomerization. The fraction and size of these ld domains were largest for Gb3 molecules with the azobenzene group at the end of the fatty acid. We further investigated the impact of domain reorganization on the interaction of the B&#8208;subunits of STx with the photo&#8208;Gb3. Fluorescence and atomic force micrographs clearly demonstrated that STxB binds to the lo phase if Gb3 is in the trans&#8208;configuration, whereas two STxB populations are formed if the photo&#8208;Gb3 is switched to the cis&#8208;configuration highlighting the idea of manipulating lipid&#8208;protein interactions with a light stimulus.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Sterically Encumbered Thiourea S&#8208;Oxides through Direct Thiourea Oxidation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Thiourea  S  &#8208;oxides can be viewed as formal analogs of the currently unknown diamino&#8208;substituted Criegee intermediates (urea  O  &#8208;oxides). However, the preparation of such  S  &#8208;oxides is rather challenging and the direct oxidation of thioureas typically only leads to formation of desulfurized products. Employing the accurate revDSD&#8208;PBEP86&#8208;D4 double hybrid density functional, we find that the peracid mediated oxidation of thiourea  S  &#8208;oxides exhibits a lower reaction barrier than the oxidation of the corresponding thiourea itself in contrast to most other ordinary thioketones. The undesired overoxidation reactivity, which is associated with strong &#960;&#8208;donation from the thiourea&#8217;s nitrogen atoms, can be partially suppressed by introduction of bulky substituents and the utilization of protic solvents. In this regard, we managed to prepare two sterically encumbered thiourea  S  &#8208;oxides in isolated yields of 35&#8722;40%. The  S  &#8208;oxides are stable in the solid state and in alcoholic solutions at room temperature for extended periods of time, but swiftly decompose in aprotic solvents by disproportionation. A dimesityl&#8208;substituted thiourea  S  &#8208;oxide complexed with residual  m  CBA could be characterized by means of X&#8208;ray crystallography, confirming the importance of hydrogen bonding in the stabilization of the amino&#8208;substituted C=S  +  &#8722;O  &#8722;  moiety.</dc:description>

         <title>Boosting Ring Strain and Lewis Acidity of Borirane: Synthesis, Reactivity and Density Functional Theory Studies of an Uncoordinated Arylborirane Fused to o&#8208;Carborane</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Among the parent borirane, benzoborirene and orthodicarbadodecaborane&#8208;fused borirane, the latter possesses the highest ring strain and the highest Lewis acidity according to our density functional theory (DFT) studies. The synthesis of this class of compounds is thus considerably challenging. The existing examples require either a strong &#960;&#8208;donating group or an extra ligand for B&#8208;coordination, which nevertheless suppresses or completely turns off the Lewis acidity. The title compound, which possesses both features, not only allows the 1,2&#8208;insertion of P=O, C=O or C&#8801;N to proceed under milder conditions, but also enables the heretofore unknown dearomative 1,4&#8208;insertion of Ar&#8208;(C=O)&#8208; into a B&#8211;C bond.&#160;The fusion of strained molecular systems to an o&#8208;carborane cage shows great promise for boosting both the ring strain and acidity.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Cation&#8208;tuning engineering has become a new frontier in altering the electronic structure of electrocatalysts, which has been employed to enhance their electrochemical performance. Significant efforts have been made to promote the electrochemical performance of transition metal&#8208;based materials during oxygen electrocatalysis and related energy devices such as Zn&#8208;air batteries. Herein, the advantages of cation&#8208;tuning engineering, including cation vacancies/defects and cation doping, in the modification of the electronic structure of transition metal oxide catalysts are discussed. Additionally, practical applications of the cation&#8208;tuning engineering strategy are reviewed in detail with a special emphasis on oxygen reduction reaction and oxygen evolution reaction. Lastly, challenges and future opportunities in this field are proposed.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Nitrogenase is the enzyme that converts N2&#160;to NH3&#160;under ambient conditions.&#160;&#160;The chemical mechanism of this catalysis at the active site FeMo&#8208;co [Fe7S9CMo(homocitrate)] is unknown.&#160;&#160;An obligatory co&#8208;product is H2, while exogenous H2&#160;is a competitive inhibitor.&#160;&#160;Isotopic substitution using exogenous D2&#160;revealed the N2&#8208;dependent reaction D2&#160;+ 2H+&#160;+ 2e&#8208;&#160; [[EQUATION]] 2HD (the &#8216;HD reaction&#8217;), together with a collection of additional experimental characteristics and requirements.&#160;&#160;In this paper I describe a detailed mechanism for the HD reaction, developed and elaborated using density functional simulations with a 486 atom model of the active site and surrounding protein.&#160;&#160;First D2&#160;binds at one Fe atom (endo&#8208;Fe6 coordination position), where it is flanked by H&#8208;Fe6 (exo&#160;position) and H&#8208;Fe2 (endo&#160;position).&#160;&#160;Then there is synchronous transfer of these two H atoms to bound D2, forming one HD bound to Fe2 and a second HD bound to Fe6.&#160;&#160;These two HD dissociate sequentially.&#160;&#160;The final phase is recovery of the two flanking H atoms.&#160;&#160;The first H atom migrates from S3B to&#160;exo&#8208;Fe6 and the second from S3B to&#160;endo&#8208;Fe2.&#160;&#160;Reaction energies and kinetic barriers are reported for all steps.&#160;&#160;This mechanism accounts for the experimental data: (a) stoichiometry; (b) the N2&#8208;dependence results from promotional N2&#160;bound at&#160;exo&#8208;Fe2; (c) different N2&#160;binding Km&#160;for the HD reaction and the NH3&#160;formation reaction results from involvement of two different sites; (d) inhibition by CO; (e) the non&#8208;occurrence of 2HD&#160; [[EQUATION]] &#160;H2&#160;+ D2&#160;results from the synchronicity of the two transfers of H to D2; (f) inhibition of HD production at high pN2&#160;is by competitive binding of N2&#160;at&#160;endo&#8208;Fe6; (g) the non&#8208;leakage of D to solvent follows from the hydrophobic environment and irreversibility of proton introduction.</dc:description>

         <title>The Insertion of E(II) and E(IV) Chlorides (E = Si, Ge) into the Si&#8211;Si Bond of Disilylene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Reactions of silicon and germanium dichlorides L&#183;ECl2 (E = Si, L = IPr; E = Ge, L = dioxane) with the phosphino&#173;amidinato&#8208;supported disilylene ({&#954;2(N,P)&#8208;NNP}Si)2 resulted in formal tetrylene insertions into the Si&#8211;Si bond. In the case of the reaction with silylene, two products were isolated. The first, kinetic product ({&#954;2(N,P)&#8208;NNP}Si)2SiCl2, is the formal product of direct SiCl2 insertion into the Si&#8211;Si bond of ({&#954;2(N,P)&#8208;NNP}Si)2 and thus features two separated silylamido silylene centers. Over time, migration of the SiCl2 group to a lateral position afforded the second, thermodynamic product, the disilylene {&#954;2(Si,P)&#8208;SiCl2NNP}Si&#8211;Si{&#954;2(N,P)&#8208;NNP}. In contrast, insertion of GeCl2 resulted only in the isolation of the germanium analogue of {&#954;2(Si,P)&#8208;SiCl2NNP}Si&#8211;Si{&#954;2(N,P)&#8208;NNP}, containing a Ge atom in the central position namely, compound {&#954;2(Si,P)&#8208;SiCl2NNP}Ge&#8211;Si{&#954;2(N,P)&#8208;NNP}, which is a rare example of a silylene&#8208;germylene. Finally, reaction of disilylene ({&#954;2(N,P)&#8208;NNP}Si)2 with SiCl4 and SiHCl3 led to the formation of the new bis(silyl)silylene, ({NNP}SiCl2)2Si:. All four new products from these insertion reactions have been characterized by multinuclear NMR and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction studies.</dc:description>

         <title>DOTP versus DOTA as Ligands for Lanthanide Cations: Novel Structurally Characterized CeIV and CeIII Cyclen&#8208;Based Complexes and Clusters in Aqueous Solutions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A group of researchers from NRCN, Ben Gurion University and the CEA show that cyclen&#8208;derived, hard&#8208;bonding ligands facilitate the formation of tetravalent cerium cations bearing oxo/hydroxo clusters in aqueous solutions. The clusters eventually decompose to form the thermodynamically favoured &#8220;in&#8208;cage&#8221; cerric macrocyclic complex. More information can be found in the Research Article by S. Pevzner, E. Maimon, Y. Ben&#8208;Eliyahu, P. Moisy, A. Bettelheim, I. Zilbermann and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202201868).

         <dc:description>
Aroyl&#8208;S,N&#8208;ketene acetals put a novel, promising class of dyes on the stage of AIEgens. Like a puppet on a string, all their photophysical properties like AIE and solid&#8208;state emission properties, the starting point of aggregation and, as shown by Hirshfeld analysis, the solid&#8208;state quantum yield can easily be fine&#8208;tuned and completely controlled by the choice and interplay of substituents at the aroyl&#8208;S,N&#8208;ketene acetal. More information can be found in the Research Article by T.&#8197;J.&#8197;J. M&#252;ller and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202202579).

Like a puppet on a string, all their photophysical properties like AIE and solid-state emission properties, the starting point of aggregation and, as shown by Hirshfeld analysis, the solid-state quantum yield can easily be fine-tuned and completely controlled by the choice and interplay of substituents at the aroyl-&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-ketene acetal.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Directed Atroposelective C&#8211;H Iodination to Synthesize Axial Chiral Biaryl N&#8208;oxides via Enantioselective&#160;Desymmetrization Strategy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The discovery of&#160;enantioselective desymmetrization reactions to provide practical synthesis of enantioenriched atropisomeric biaryls is a challenging topic in the field of asymmetric catalysis. Herein, we reported a highly enantioselective desymmetrization reaction for the synthesis of axially chiral biaryl N&#8208;oxides by atroposelective C&#8208;H iodination using Pd (II) coordinated by N&#8208;benzoyl&#8208;L&#8208;phenylalanine as a chiral catalyst at room temperature. A broad range of products were obtained in high yields (up to 99%) with excellent enantioselectivities (up to 98% ee). The products could be synthesized in gram scale, one of which was proved to be a powerful organocatalyst in asymmetric allylation reaction. Mechanistic evidence as well as DFT calculations point towards the factors that lead to high reactivity and excellent enantiocontrol in this reaction.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Research advance in biomedical applications is inseparable from the development of biofunctional materials. Due to unique sequence programmability and various biological activities, DNA is a promising biological macromolecule for the precise construction of biofunctional materials. This review aims to provide an overview of the assembly of ultralong single&#8208;stranded DNA that is produced by rolling circle amplification into biofunctional materials in recent years. The first part illustrates how to construct cross&#8208;linked DNA hydrogel, during which the key point lays on overcoming electrostatic repulsion and steric hindrance between ultralong DNA through improving assembly force and increasing assembly sites. The second part focuses on how to construct DNA nanocomplex, during which the key point is achieving the structure stability and function integration between different components through rationally designed DNA sequences.</dc:description>

         <title>Terminal Au&#8211;N and Au&#8211;O Units in Organometallic Frames</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Since gold is located well beyond the oxo wall, chemical species with terminal Au&#8211;N and Au&#8211;O units are extremely rare and limited to low coordination numbers. We report here that these unusual units can be trapped within a suitable organometallic frame. Thus, the terminal auronitrene and auroxyl derivatives, [(CF&#8323;)&#8323;AuN]&#8315; and [(CF&#8323;)&#8323;AuO]&#8315; were identified as local minima by calculation. These open&#8208;shell, high&#8208;energy ions were experimentally detected by tandem mass spectrometry (MS&#178;): They respectively arise by N&#8322; or NO&#8322; dissociation from the corresponding precursor species [(CF&#8323;)&#8323;Au(N&#8323;)]&#8315; and [(CF&#8323;)&#8323;Au(ONO&#8322;)]&#8315; in the gas phase. Together with the known fluoride derivative [(CF&#8323;)&#8323;AuF]&#8315; , they form an interesting series of isoleptic and alloelectronic complexes of the highly acidic organogold(III) moiety (CF&#8323;)&#8323;Au with singly charged anions X&#8315; of the most electronegative elements (X = F, O, N). Ligand&#8208;field inversion in all these [(CF&#8323;)&#8323;AuX]&#8315; species results in the localization of unpaired electrons at the N and O atoms.</dc:description>

         <title>Lysosomal Targeting of &#946;&#8208;Cyclodextrin</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>&#946;&#8208;Cyclodextrin (&#946;&#8208;CD) and derivatives are approved therapeutics in &gt;30 clinical settings. &#946;&#8208;CDs have also shown promise as therapeutics for treatment of some lysosomal storage disorders, such as Niemann&#8208;Pick disease type C, and other disease states which involve metabolite accumulation in the lysosome. In these cases, &#946;&#8208;CD activity relies on transport to the lysosome, wherein it can bind hydrophobic substrate and effect extraction. The post&#8208;translational attachment of N&#8208;glycans terminated in mannose&#8208;6&#8208;phosphate (M6P) residues is the predominant method by which lysosomal enzymes are targeted to the lysosome. In this work we covalently attach a synthetic biantennary bis&#8208;M6P&#8208;terminated N&#8208;glycan to &#946;&#8208;CD and study the effect of the added glycans in a mammalian cell line. The formation of a host guest complex with a Cy5 fluorophore allows study of both cellular internalisation and transport to the lysosome by fluorescence microscopy. Results indicate that the rates of both internalisation and lysosomal transport are increased by the attachment of M6P&#8208;glycans to &#946;&#8208;CD, indicating that M6P&#8208;glycan conjugation may improve the therapeutic effectiveness of &#946;&#8208;CD for the treatment of disorders involving hydrophobic metabolite accumulation in the lysosome.</dc:description>

         <title>Integrated Reversible Thermochromism, High Tc, Dielectric Switch and Narrow Band Gap in One Multifunctional Ferroic</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rarely reported multi&#8208;functional ferroelastic shows a high phase transition temperature of 427.7&#8197;K. The coexistence of ferroelastic, narrow band gap, thermochromic, and dielectric properties makes it potentially promising for use in multifunctional smart devices such as nature&#8208;bionic, energy conversion, signal storage and encryption, and switching.







Abstract
Organic&#8208;inorganic Hybrid (OIH) materials for multifunctional switchable applications have attracted enormous attention in recent years due to their excellent optoelectronic properties and good structural tunability. However, it still remains challenging to fabricate one simple OIH compound with multi&#8208;functionals properties, such as dielectric switching, thermochromic properties, semiconductor characteristics and ferroelasticity. Under this context, we successfully synthesized [2&#8208;(2&#8208;fluorophenyl)ethan&#8208;1&#8208; ammonium]2SnBr6 (compound 1), which has a higher phase transition temperature of 427.7&#8197;K. Additionally, it exhibits a semiconducting property with an indirect band gap of 2.36&#8197;eV. Combining ferroelastic, narrow band gap, thermochromic, and dielectric properties, compound 1 can be considered as a rarely reported multi&#8208;functional ferroelastic material, which is expected to give inspiration for broadening the applications in the smart devices field.

         <title>Mechanistic Aspects on [3+2] Cycloaddition (32CA) Reactions of Azides to Nitroolefins: A Computational and Kinetic Study</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A detailed mechanistic study of [3+2] cycloadditions between nitroolefins and azides is described. Combining DFT calculations, kinetic studies, and activation strain analysis, our studies shed new mechanistic insight on the factors controlling reactivity and regioselectivity in this transformation and highlight the role of non&#8208;statistical effects in organocatalyzed and metal&#8208;free dipolar cycloadditions.







Abstract
[3+2] cycloadditions of nitroolefins have emerged as a selective and catalyst&#8208;free alternative for the synthesis of 1,2,3&#8208;triazoles from azides. We describe mechanistic studies into the cycloaddition/rearomatization reaction sequence.

     alt="Mechanistic Aspects on [3+2] Cycloaddition (32CA) Reactions of Azides to Nitroolefins: A Computational and Kinetic Study"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A detailed mechanistic study of [3+2] cycloadditions&lt;/b&gt; between nitroolefins and azides is described. Combining DFT calculations, kinetic studies, and activation strain analysis, our studies shed new mechanistic insight on the factors controlling reactivity and regioselectivity in this transformation and highlight the role of non-statistical effects in organocatalyzed and metal-free dipolar cycloadditions.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[3+2] cycloadditions of nitroolefins have emerged as a selective and catalyst-free alternative for the synthesis of 1,2,3-triazoles from azides. We describe mechanistic studies into the cycloaddition/rearomatization reaction sequence. DFT calculations revealed a rate-limiting cycloaddition step proceeding via an asynchronous TS with high kinetic selectivity for the 1,5-triazole. Kinetic studies reveal a second-order rate law, and &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C kinetic isotopic effects at natural abundance were measured with a significant normal effect at the conjugated olefinic centers of 1.0158 and 1.0216 at the &#945; and &#946;-carbons of &#946;-nitrostyrene. Distortion/interaction-activation strain and energy decomposition analyses revealed that the major regioisomeric pathway benefits from an earlier and less-distorted TS, while intermolecular interaction terms dominate the preference for 1,5- over 1,4-cycloadducts. In addition, the major regioisomer also has more favorable electrostatic and dispersion terms. Additionally, while static DFT calculations suggest a concerted but highly asynchronous &lt;i&gt;Ei&lt;/i&gt;-type HNO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; elimination mechanism, quasiclassical direct-dynamics calculations reveal the existence of a dynamic intermediate.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Correct Identification of the Core&#8208;Shell Structure of Cell Membrane&#8208;Coated Polymeric Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The core&#8208;shell structure of cell membrane&#8208;coated PLGA NPs (poly(lactic&#8208;co&#8208;glycolic acid nanoparticles) observed in some negatively stained transmission electron microscopy (TEM) samples is an artifact caused by the staining of the original PLGA NPs and not due to the actual cell membrane coating.







Abstract
Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) observations of negatively stained cell membrane (CM)&#8208;coated polymeric nanoparticles (NPs) reveal a characteristic core&#8208;shell structure. However, negative staining agents can create artifacts that complicate the determination of the actual NP structure. Herein, it is demonstrated with various bare polymeric core NPs, such as poly(lactic&#8208;co&#8208;glycolic acid) (PLGA), poly(ethylene glycol) methyl ether&#8208;block&#8208;PLGA, and poly(caprolactone), that certain observed core&#8208;shell structures are actually artifacts caused by the staining process. To address this issue, fluorescence quenching was applied to quantify the proportion of fully coated NPs and statistical TEM analysis was used to identify and differentiate whether the observed core&#8208;shell structures of CM&#8208;coated PLGA (CM&#8722;PLGA) NPs are due to artifacts or to the CM coating. Integrated shells in TEM images of negatively stained CM&#8722;PLGA NPs are identified as artifacts. The present results challenge current understanding of the structure of CM&#8208;coated polymeric NPs and encourage researchers to use the proposed characterization approach to avoid misinterpretations.

         <title>Electro&#8208;assisted Molecular Assembly Giving Atomic&#8208;Scale Catalytic Active&#8208;Site Detection</title>

Pinpoint: This work proposes a novel electro&#8208;assisted molecular assembly strategy to obtain a carbon defect with a target structure. More specifically, it identified that the topmost carbon atom on a pentagon carbon defect is the active site for the oxygen reduction reaction from the experimental perspective.







Abstract
The artificially accurate design of nonmetal electrocatalysts&#8217; active site has been a huge challenge because no pure active species with the specific structure could be strictly controlled by traditional synthetic methods. Species with a multiconfiguration in the catalyst hinder identification of the active site and the subsequent comprehension of the reaction mechanism. We have developed a novel electro&#8208;assisted molecular assembly strategy to obtain a pure pentagon ring on perfect graphene avoiding other reconstructed structures. More importantly, the active atom was confirmed by the subtle passivation process as the topmost carbon atom. Recognition of the carbon&#8208;defect electrocatalysis reaction mechanism was first downsized to the single&#8208;atom scale from the experimental perspective. It is expected that this innovative electro&#8208;assisted molecular assembly strategy could be extensively applied in the active structure&#8208;controlled synthesis of nonmetal electrocatalysts and verification of the exact active atom.

         <title>Non&#8208;Covalent Integration of a [FeFe]&#8208;Hydrogenase Mimic to Multiwalled Carbon Nanotubes for Electrocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An original [FeFe]&#8208;hydrogenase mimic integrating two pyrene anchors was successfully synthesized and grafted at the surface of multiwalled carbon nanotube based electrodes. The hybrid molecular cathode could reach high turnover numbers for H2 production in fully aqueous media and sustain activity for 20&#8197;h.







Abstract
Surface integration of molecular catalysts inspired from the active sites of hydrogenase enzymes represents a promising route towards developing noble metal&#8208;free and sustainable technologies for H2 production. Efficient and stable catalyst anchoring is a key aspect to enable this approach. Herein, we report the preparation and electrochemical characterization of an original diironhexacarbonyl complex including two pyrene groups per catalytic unit in order to allow for its smooth integration, through &#960;&#8208;interactions, onto multiwalled carbon nanotube&#8208;based electrodes. In this configuration, the grafted catalyst could reach turnover numbers for H2 production (TONH2) of up to 4&#177;2&#215;103 within 20&#8197;h of bulk electrolysis, operating at neutral pH. Post operando analysis of catalyst functionalized electrodes revealed the degradation of the catalytic unit occurred via loss of the iron carbonyl units, while the anchoring groups and most part of the ligand remained attached onto multiwalled carbon nanotubes.

         <title>One&#8208;step Oxidative Monofluorination of Electron&#8208;Deficient Sulfoxides to Access Highly Lewis Acidic Sulfur(VI) Cations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly Lewis acidic fluorosulfoxonium cations can be prepared in a one&#8208;step, chloride promoter&#8208;free fashion from electron&#8208;deficient sulfoxides using [FXe][OTf]. The latter is prepared by reaction of XeF2 with TMS&#8208;OTf, thus representing an inversion of the previously described Umpolung strategy, which failed to convert the same sulfoxides efficiently. The Lewis acidities of the obtained cations have been probed experimentally and computationally.







Abstract
The strongly oxidizing, powerful electrophilic fluorination reagent [FXe][OTf] is shown to effect direct oxidative monofluorination of sulfoxides. This one&#8208;step, chloride promoter&#8208;free methodology provides access to so far inaccessible, yet highly desirable strongly Lewis acidic fluorosulfoxonium cations from electron&#8208;deficient and/or sterically demanding sulfoxides that are shown to be practically unreactive towards the previously reported XeF2/NEt4Cl system. Experimental and density functional theory studies have been conducted to assess the Lewis acidities of the prepared sulfur(VI) cations. Preliminary results obtained with chiral sulfoxides provide early insights into the mechanism of these fluorination reactions.

         <title>CH&#8208;&#960; Multi&#8208;Interaction&#8208;Driven Recognition and Isolation of Planar Compounds in a Spheroidal Polyaromatic Cavity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A polyaromatic capsule with a spheroidal cavity displays superior binding abilities toward planar compounds through multiple CH&#8208;&#960; interactions (up to 32). In the cavity, one molecule of polyaromatic coronene is exclusively bound from mixtures and one molecule of Cu(II) complexes is bound quantitatively and isolated from bulk phases.







Abstract
&#960;&#8208;&#960; Interactions are established as a powerful supramolecular tool, whereas the usability of CH&#8208;&#960; interactions has been rather limited so far. Here we present (i)&#8197;selective binding of planar polyaromatics and (ii)&#8197;effective isolation of planar metal complexes by a polyaromatic capsule, utilizing multiple CH&#8208;&#960; interactions. In the spheroidal cavity, one molecule of large and medium&#8208;sized polyaromatic molecules (i.&#8201;e., coronene and pyrene) is exclusively bound from mixtures bearing the same number of aromatic CH groups. Theoretical studies reveal that multiple host&#8208;guest CH&#8208;&#960; interactions (up to 32&#8197;interactions) are the predominant driving force for the observed selectivity. In addition, one molecule of planar metal complexes (i.&#8201;e., porphine and bis(acetylacetonato) Cu(II) complexes) is quantitatively bound by the capsule through aromatic and aliphatic CH&#8208;&#960; multi&#8208;interactions, respectively.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A polyaromatic capsule&lt;/b&gt; with a spheroidal cavity displays superior binding abilities toward planar compounds through multiple CH-&#960; interactions (&lt;i&gt;up to 32&lt;/i&gt;). In the cavity, one molecule of polyaromatic coronene is exclusively bound from mixtures and one molecule of Cu(II) complexes is bound quantitatively and isolated from bulk phases.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#960;-&#960; Interactions are established as a powerful supramolecular tool, whereas the usability of CH-&#960; interactions has been rather limited so far. Here we present (i)&#8197;selective binding of planar polyaromatics and (ii)&#8197;effective isolation of planar metal complexes by a polyaromatic capsule, utilizing multiple CH-&#960; interactions. In the spheroidal cavity, one molecule of large and medium-sized polyaromatic molecules (i.&#8201;e., coronene and pyrene) is exclusively bound from mixtures bearing the same number of aromatic CH groups. Theoretical studies reveal that multiple host-guest CH-&#960; interactions (up to 32&#8197;interactions) are the predominant driving force for the observed selectivity. In addition, one molecule of planar metal complexes (i.&#8201;e., porphine and bis(acetylacetonato) Cu(II) complexes) is quantitatively bound by the capsule through aromatic and aliphatic CH-&#960; multi-interactions, respectively. The ESR and theoretical studies demonstrate the isolation capability of the capsular framework and an unusual polar environment in the polyaromatic cavity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Room&#8208;Temperature&#8208;Observable Interconversion Between Si(IV) and Si(II) via Reversible Intramolecular Insertion Into an Aromatic C&#8722;C Bond</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of a new silepin with a sterically encumbered silyl ligand was achieved, which shows a spectral observable equilibrium towards the isomeric acyclic silylene at room temperature. The equilibrium was analyzed by VT&#8197;NMR and UV/Vis measurements supported by DFT calculations. Furthermore, the reactivity of the silepin/silylen towards small molecules was investigated.







Abstract
An easily isolable silacycloheptatriene (silepin) 1&#8201;b was synthesized from the reaction of a N&#8208;heterocyclic imino (IPrN) substituted tribromosilane IPrNSiBr3 with the sterically congested bis(trimethylsilyl)triisopropylsilyl silanide KSi(TMS)2Si(iPr)3 (BTTPS). In solution, the Si(IV) silepin 1&#8201;b is in a thermodynamic equilibrium with the acyclic Si(II) silylene 1&#8201;a. The relative concentration of the Si(II) or Si(IV) isomers can be controlled by temperature variation and observed by variable temperature NMR and UV/Vis spectroscopy. DFT calculations show a small reaction barrier for the Si(II)&#8652;Si(IV) interconversion and a small energy gap between the Si(II) and Si(IV) species. The reactivity of 1&#8201;a/b is demonstrated on a variety of small molecules.

         <title>Phosphoric&#8208;Acid Retention in High&#8208;Temperature Proton&#8208;Exchange Membranes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>

Strategies to improve PA retention: The leakage of phosphoric acid (PA) from PA&#8208;doped proton&#8208;exchange membranes (PEMs) is a key issue for high&#8208;temperature proton&#8208;exchange membrane fuel cells (HT&#8208;PEMFCs). The detailed discussion of the recent progress to mitigate the PA loss in HT&#8208;PEMs is described in this Concept. Moreover, a new idea is provided on how to decrease the leaching of PA in PEMs with a high acid concentration, and how to address the remaining technical issues.







Abstract
Great efforts have been conducted to develop high temperature proton exchange membrane fuel cell (HT&#8208;PEMFC) due to its features of enhanced electrocatalyst reactivity, simplified hydrothermal management system and high CO tolerance of catalysts, and remarkable progress has been achieved. However, the easy leaching of phosphoric acid (PA) from the membranes during operation limits its commercial scale&#8208;up in complicated environments. This concept here mainly focuses on the recent developments for mitigation of PA loss in PEMs. The probable mechanisms of PA loss are proposed. The approaches to improve PA retention for example via introduction of phosphonic acid by covalent bond, using ion&#8208;pairs interaction and siphoning effect, and blending with inorganic nanoparticles are described in detail. Among these strategies, the siphoning effect from the intrinsic microporous PEMs is the most efficient and enables the cell to operate flexibly within a broad temperature range. Therefore, this concept may provide new ideas for the scientists to retain PA, to improve the cell performance and expand the potential applications of PA doped PEMs at elevated humidity and wide temperature range.

         <title>Oligonucleotides Featuring a Covalently Mercurated 6&#8208;Phenylcarbazole Residue as High&#8208;Affinity Hybridization Probes for Thiopyrimidine&#8208;Containing Sequences</title>

Getting back to (nucleo)base: Oligonucleotides incorporating a central 1&#8208; or 8&#8208;mercuri&#8208;6&#8208;phenyl&#8208;1H&#8208;carbazole residue show great promise as high&#8208;affinity hybridization probes, discriminating between all canonical nucleobases as well as 2&#8208; and 4&#8208;thiothymines by melting temperature margins of at least 5&#8201;&#176;C. Duplexes facilitating HgII&#8722;S coordination were particularly stable, with melting temperatures nearly 30&#8201;&#176;C higher than those of respective unmodified duplexes.







Abstract
Short oligonucleotides incorporating either 1&#8208;mercuri&#8208;6&#8208;phenylcarbazole, 8&#8208;mercuri&#8208;6&#8208;phenylcarbazole, or 1,8&#8208;dimercuri&#8208;6&#8208;phenylcarbazole C&#8208;nucleoside in the middle of the chain have been synthesized and studied for their potential as hybridization probes for sequences containing thiopyrimidine nucleobases. All of these oligonucleotides formed very stable duplexes with complementary sequences pairing the organometallic moiety with either 2&#8208; or 4&#8208;thiothymine. The isomeric monomercurated oligonucleotides were also able to discriminate between 2&#8208; and 4&#8208;thiothymine based on the different melting temperatures of the respective duplexes. DFT&#8208;optimized structures of the most stable mononuclear HgII&#8208;mediated base pairs featured a coordinated covalent bond between HgII and either S2 or S4 and a hydrogen bond between the carbazole nitrogen and N3. The dinuclear HgII&#8208;mediated base pairs, in turn, were geometrically very similar to the one previously reported to form between 1,8&#8208;dimercuri&#8208;6&#8208;phenylcarbazole and thymine and had one HgII ion coordinated to a thio and the other one to an oxo substituent.

Spectroscopic and computational examination of a homologous series of rhodium(I) pybox carbonyl complexes has revealed a correlation between the conformation of the flanking aryl&#8208;substituted oxazoline donors and the carbonyl stretching frequency. This relationship is also observed experimentally for octahedral rhodium(III) and ruthenium(II) variants and cannot be explained through the classical, Dewar&#8211;Chatt&#8211;Duncanson, interpretation of metal&#8208;carbonyl bonding. Instead, these findings are reconciled by local changes in the magnitude of the electric field that is projected along the metal&#8208;carbonyl vector: the internal Stark effect.

         <title>Interface Engineering of Conjugated Polymer&#8208;Based Composites for Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Conjugated polymer (CP)&#8208;based composites are potential candidates for solving environmental issues through photocatalysis process. Interface engineering can construct tight interfaces in these composites and further achieve high performance in various photocatalytic applications. In this review, we focus on the characteristics, roles, and regulation methods of different interfacial interactions as well as building methods based on these factors to construct well&#8208;formed interfaces.







Abstract
Photocatalysis can create a green way to produce clean energy resources, degrade pollutants and achieve carbon neutrality, making the construction of efficient photocatalysts significant in solving environmental issues. Conjugated polymers (CPs) with adjustable band structures have superior light&#8208;absorption capacity and flexible morphology that facilitate contact with other components to form advanced heterojunctions. Interface engineering can strengthen the interfacial contact between the components and further enlarge the interfacial contact area, enhance light absorption, accelerate charge transfer and improve the reusability of the composites. In order to throw some new light on heterojunction interface regulation at a molecular level, herein we summarize CP&#8208;based composites with improved photocatalytic performance according to the types of interactions (covalent bonding, hydrogen bonding, electrostatic interactions, &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking, and other polar interactions) between the components and introduce the corresponding interface building methods, identifying techniques. Then the roles of interfaces in different photocatalytic applications are discussed. Finally, we sum up the existing problems in interface engineering of CP&#8208;based composites and look forward to the possible solutions.

         <title>Regiodivergent Asymmetric Pyridinium Additions: Mechanistic Insight and Synthetic Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A regiodivergent asymmetric dearomatization of readily accessible pyridines has enabled the redox&#8208;economic synthesis of both (+)&#8208;N&#8208;Methylaspidospermidine and (&#8722;)&#8208;Paroxetine. A mechanistic rationale for the regiodivergent pyridinium additions and evaluation of their scope was also explored.







Abstract
A practical protocol for the first regiodivergent asymmetric addition of aryl and alkenyl organometallic reagents to substituted N&#8208;alkyl pyridinium heterocycles is described. The couplings proceed with high regiochemical and stereochemical selectivities, and provide access to chiral 1,2,3&#8208; and 1,3,4&#8208;trisubstituted dihydropyridine products, controlled by judicious choice of nitrogen activating agent. To this end, a correlation was found between the parameterized size of the activating group and the C2/C4 regioselectivity in the couplings. The utility of the described chemistry was demonstrated in two concise asymmetric syntheses of (+)&#8208;N&#8208;methylaspidospermidine and (&#8722;)&#8208;paroxetine.

         <dc:description>
A novel La(III)&#8208;based two&#8208;dimensional (2D) metal&#8208;organic framework, [La2/3(qptca)1/2] was successfully synthesized from LaCl3 and 1,1&#8242;&#8201;:&#8201;4&#8242;,1&#8242;&#8201;&#8242;:&#8201;4&#8242;&#8242;,1&#8242;&#8242;&#8242;&#8201;:&#8201;4&#8242;&#8242;&#8242;,1&#8242;&#8242;&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;quinquephenyl]&#8208;2,2&#8242;&#8242;,2&#8242;&#8242;&#8242;&#8242;,5&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;tetracarboxylic acid (H4qptca) by conventional solvothermal method. Initial studies showed that it was an efficient heterogeneous catalyst for the Friedel&#8208;Crafts alkylation of indole and pyrrole with &#946;&#8208;nitrostyrene with a wide substrate scope.







Abstract
In this study, a novel La(III)&#8208;based two&#8208;dimensional (2D) metal&#8208;organic framework, [La2/3(qptca)1/2] (referred to as SLX&#8208;2), from LaCl3 and 1,1&#8242;&#8201;:&#8201;4&#8242;,1&#8242;&#8242;&#8201;:&#8201;4&#8242;&#8242;,1&#8242;&#8242;&#8242;&#8201;:&#8201;4&#8242;&#8242;&#8242;,1&#8242;&#8242;&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;quinquephenyl]&#8208;2,2&#8242;&#8242;,2&#8242;&#8242;&#8242;&#8242;,5&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;tetracarboxylic acid (H4qptca) was synthesized by conventional solvothermal method and thoroughly characterized by using X&#8208;ray single&#8208;crystal diffraction, powder X&#8208;ray diffraction, and thermogravimetric analyses. The 2D SLX&#8208;2 features a unique lanthanum center exposed to the skeleton and was used as an efficient Lewis acid catalyst for the Friedel&#8208;Crafts alkylation of indole and pyrrole with &#946;&#8208;nitrostyrene along with a wide substrate scope, giving the desired products in good&#8208;to&#8208;high yields under the optimal reaction conditions. Furthermore, the catalyst was used for twenty cycles, with nearly no effect on its activity, and the reaction was heterogeneous in nature. Moreover, compared to the previous hydrogen&#8208;bond&#8208;donating MOF catalysts for such alkylation reactions, SLX&#8208;2 showed an excellent stability toward harsh acidic and basic environment, and gave comparable catalytic activities.

         <title>A Plausible Prebiotic Path to Nucleosides: Ribosides and Related Aldosides are Generated from Ribulose, Fructose, and Similar Abiotic Precursors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The prebiotic origins of ribose, nucleosides, and eventually RNA are enduring questions whose answers are central to the RNA World hypothesis. The abiotic synthesis of sugars was first demonstrated over a century ago, but no known prebiotic reaction produces ribose (an aldose sugar) selectively and in good yield. In contrast, ribulose and fructose (ketose sugars) and other monosaccharides are formed in high yield by several robust abiotic reactions. We report here that ketose sugars&#8212;both ketopentoses and ketohexoes&#8212;serve as precursors for the formation of ribosides and other aldosides, as demonstrated by glycoside&#8208;forming reactions involving barbituric acid, a plausibly prebiotic nucleobase. Moreover, we discovered a one&#8208;pot reaction of glyceraldehyde and barbituric acid that under mild conditions, and without special minerals or other catalysts, results in the formation of glycosides. These results reveal that an exclusive or high&#8208;yielding generation of free ribose was not required for its incorporation into processes that provided the foundations for life.</dc:description>

         <title>Recyclable GO&#8208;Arginine Hybrids for CO2 Fixation into Cyclic Carbonates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>New covalently modified GO&#8208;guanidine materials are realized on a gram&#8208;scale synthesis and purified via an innovative microfiltration. The use of these composites in the fixation of CO2 into cyclic carbonates is demonstrated.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;New covalently modified GO-guanidine materials are realized on a gram-scale synthesis and purified via an innovative microfiltration. The use of these composites in the fixation of CO2 into cyclic carbonates is demonstrated. Mild operating conditions, high yields (up to 85%), wide scope (15 examples) and recoverability/reusability (up to 5 cycle) of the material account for the efficiency of the protocol. Dedicated control experiments contributed to shed light on the activation modes exerted by the GO-Arg (Arg: arginine) during the ring-opening/closing synthetic sequence&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Synthesis and Late&#8208;Stage Diversification of BN&#8208;Embedded Dibenzocorannulenes as Efficient Fluorescence Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Diode Emitters.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report the synthesis and late&#8208;stage diversification of a new class of hetero&#8208;buckybowl, BN&#8208;embedded dibenzocorannulenes (  B  2  N  2  &#8208;DBC  s). The synthesis is achieved via one&#8208;shot halogenative borylation, comprising the nitrogen&#8208;directed haloboration of alkyne and an intramolecular bora&#8208;Friedel&#8211;Crafts reaction, which provides BN&#8208;embedded dibenzocorannulene possessing two bromo substituents (  B  2  N  2  &#8208;DBC&#8208;Br  ).  B  2  N  2  &#8208;DBC&#8208;Br  undergoes diversification via coupling reactions to provide a variety of arylated derivatives (  B  2  N  2  &#8208;DBC&#8208;R  ), exhibiting strong blue fluorescence. An organic light&#8208;emitting diode (OLED) employing one of the derivatives as an emitter exhibited a high external quantum efficiency of 6.6% and long operational lifetime of 907 h at an initial luminance of 1000 cd m  &#8211;2  , indicating the significant potential for the development of efficient and stable hetero&#8208;buckybowl&#8208;based OLED materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Water Triggered Chemical Transformation of Perovskite Nanocrystals</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Recently emerged lead&#8208;halide perovskite nanocrystals (PNCs) are promising optoelectronic material due to their easy solution processability, wide range of color tunability as well as very high photoluminescence quantum yield. Despite their significant success in lab&#8208;scale optoelectronic applications, the long&#8208;term stability becomes the main issue, hindering them towards commercialization. The highly ionic nature of such lead&#8208;halide structure makes them extremely unstable in water and air. However, recently a very few groups have taken the advantage of such nature of the crystal structure for water&#8208;triggered chemical transformation towards shape, composition and morphology controlled stable and bright PNCs which are otherwise difficult to obtain via typical direct approach. Furthermore, using polymer as an encapsulating layer for the PNCs, water soluble stable PNCs have been prepared. In this review, we summarize the recent progress on the water&#8208;hexane interface chemistry towards chemical transformation to produce several PNCs. Such method not only ensure to yield several shape controlled perovskites nanocrystals, but also formation of perovskites in aqueous phase that shows promising application towards bio&#8208;imaging.</dc:description>

         <title>Stimulus Response Lanthanide MOF Materials Encapsulated with Viologen Derivatives: Characterization, Photophysical Properties and Sensing on Nitrophenols</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Viologens (1,1&#8217;&#8208;disubstituted&#8208;4,4&#8217;&#8208;bipyridyl) possessing electron&#8208;deficient property and redox activity, are a class of suitable chromophores to assemble metal&#8208;organic hybrid photochromic materials. &#160;Viologen&#8208;functionalized metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) have attracted much attention for their photochromic properties. &#160;However, the syntheses of lanthanide&#8208;viologen hybrid crystalline photochromic materials remain facing with many challenges, for example, the structures and properties of final products are difficult to predict and are limited by molecular configurations and so on.&#160; In this work, host&#8208;guest composite material Ln&#8208;NH2BDC&#8208;pbpy MOFs are constructed by encapsulating viologen derivative pbpyCl2. &#160;The pbpy2+ moieties is uniformly embed by their &#960;&#8208;&#960; conjugation in the pores of the 3D structure with electrostatic interaction. &#160;Due to the encapsulation of the chromophore pbpy2+ moieties, the Ln&#8208;NH2BDC&#8208;pbpy MOFs exhibit reversible photochromic properties which can change color after irradiation, and can restore the original color after being protected from light or heating. &#160;Interestingly, the fluorescence intensity decreases with illumination time and recovers under dark conditions. &#160;As a result, the Ln&#8208;NH2BDC&#8208;pbpy MOFs have the performance of both photochromic and photomodulated fluorescence. &#160;Based on the outstanding fluorescence performance of the Ln&#8208;NH2BDC&#8208;pbpy MOFs, they also show wonderful detection effect on nitrophenols especially for TNP.</dc:description>

         <title>Overclocking nitronyl nitroxide gold derivatives in cross&#8208;coupling reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nitronyl nitroxides are functional building blocks in cutting&#8208;edge research fields, such as the design of molecular magnets, the development of redox and photoswitchable molecular systems and the creation of redox&#8208;active components for organic and hybrid batteries. The key importance of the nitronyl nitroxide function is to translate molecular&#8208;level&#8208;optimized structures into nano&#8208;scale devices and new technologies. In spite of great importance, efficient and versatile synthetic approaches to these compounds still represent a challenge. Particularly, methods for the direct introduction of a nitronyl nitroxide moiety into aromatic systems possess many limitations. Here, we report gold derivatives of nitronyl nitroxide that can enter Pd(0)&#8208;catalysed cross&#8208;coupling reactions with various aryl bromides, affording the corresponding functionalized nitronyl nitroxides. Based on the high thermal stability and enhanced reactivity in catalytic transformation, a new reagent is suggested for the synthesis of radical systems via a universal cross&#8208;coupling approach.</dc:description>

With 2D pore channels in SNNU&#8208;Bai76 and SNNU&#8208;Bai77 being tuned to the 1D pore channel in SNNU&#8208;Bai78, C3H8 and C2H6 adsorption uptakes are apparently improved and&#160;IAST selectivities of C3H8/CH4 and C2H6/CH4 are almost remained, which indicate that SNNU&#8208;Bai78 may be one potential separation material for the pipeline natural gas purification. These were further confirmed by breakthrough experiments for the simulated pipeline natural gas (C3H8/C2H6/CH4:5/10/85 gas mixture) of three isostructural MOFs. Furthermore, GCMC simulations revealed that due to one of the pore channels blocked by Cl atoms in a couple of 3&#8208;chloro isonicotinic acid with the changed conformation as the pillar, the pore wall of the formed 1D pore channel in SNNU&#8208;Bai78 may interact with the adsorbed C3H8 or C2H6 molecule more strongly, for which more atoms of framework at the new adsorption site will interact with the adsorbed gas molecule by more intermolecular interactions. This was also evidenced by the increased binding energies, being consistent with the tuning of adsorption enthalpies for C3H8 and C2H6 gas molecules, and the reduced C3H8 and C2H6 gas diffusion coefficients in SNNU&#8208;Bai78. Very interestingly, this work is the first example of finely tuning the pore connectivity of MOFs toward strengthened host&#8208;guest interactions for the gas adsorption and separation.</dc:description>

         <title>Cobalt Cyclopentadienyl&#8208;Phosphine Dinitrogen Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>By applying the potassium salts of cyclopentadienyl&#8208;phosphine ligands LK to CoCl 2 , the corresponding cobalt chlorides ( 1 , L Co(II)Cl) were prepared. By reducing complexes 1 with KHBEt 3 under N 2 atmosphere, bridging end&#8208;on complexes, L Co(I)&#8208;N 2 &#8208;Co(I) L ( 2a and 2b ), were obtained successfully. 15 N 2 &#8208;labeled 2a &#8208; 15 N 2 was prepared under 15 N 2 / 14 N 2 exchange in THF solution. L Co(I)&#8208;N 2 &#8208;Co(I) L complex 2a could react with P 4 molecules to release N 2 and generate a&#160;Co&#8208;P 4 &#8208;Co moiety 4 . Further reduction of complex 2b led to cleavage of a P&#8208;C bond in the cyclopentadienyl&#8208;phosphine ligand, while novel &#181; &#8208;PCy 2 bridged Co(0)&#8208;N 2 complex 5 was provided. DFT calculations were performed and confirmed the experimental observations.</dc:description>

         <title>Trianionic 1,3,2&#8208;Dioxaborine&#8208;Containing Polymethines: Bright Near&#8208;Infrared Fluorophores</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Very bright NIR polymethines bearing a trianionic chromophore comprising dioxaborine rings (A) and different electron&#8208;accepting end groups (A&#8242;) were synthesized and characterized. The obtained dyes are among the brightest fluorophores in the polymethine family. A single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis unambiguously confirmed the structure of one of the synthesized trianionic dyes.







Abstract
Trianionic polymethines of the A&#8242;&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A&#8242; type comprising dioxaborine rings (A) and different electron&#8208;accepting end groups (A&#8242;) have been synthesized. The obtained dyes absorb and emit light in the near&#8208;infrared region with remarkably high molar attenuation coefficients (&#1013; up to 495&#8201;000&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;1 in DMF) and fluorescence quantum yields (&#934;f up to 0.73 in DMF). Thus, the novel trianionic dyes stand among the brightest individual fluorophores known to date &#8211; with a magnitude of fluorescence brightness (&#1013;&#8901;&#934;f) of 313&#8201;000&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;1 in DMF. The synthesized dyes demonstrate a minor negative solvatochromism and small Stokes shifts. X&#8208;ray data reveal the nearly planar geometry of the trianionic chromophore. All the obtained compounds are stable in the solid state and in a solution, although the relative stability is much higher in polar aprotic than in protic solvents.

         <title>Coordination of Pnictogenylboranes towards Tl(I) salts and a Tl&#8208; mediated P&#8208;P coupling</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The coordination chemistry of only Lewis&#8208;base (LB)stabilized pnictogenylboranes EH2BH2 &#183; NMe 3  (E = P, As) towards Tl(I) salts has been studied. The reaction of Tl[BArCl] (BArCl = [B(3,5C6H3Cl2)4]&#8208;) with the corresponding pnictogenylborane results in the formation of [Tl(EH2BH2&#183;NMe3)][BArCl] (1a: E = P; 1b: E = As). Whereas the Tl ion in 1a/b is monocoordinated, the exchange of the weakly coordinating anion (WCA) in the Tl(I) salt leads to the formation of a trigonal pyramidal coordination mode at the Tl atom by coordination of three equivalents of EH2BH2 &#183; NMe3 in [Tl(EH2BH2 &#183; NMe3)3][WCA] (2a: E = P, WCA = TEFCl; 2b: E = As, WCA = TEF) (TEF = [Al{OC(CF3)3}4]&#8208;, TEFCl = [Al{(OC(CF3)2(CCl3)}4]&#8208;). Furthermore, by using two equivalents of PH2BH2&#183;NMe 3 , a Tl(I)&#8208;mediated P&#8208;P coupling takes place in CH2Cl2 as solvent resulting in [Me3N &#183; BH2PH2PHBH2 &#183; NMe3][WCA] (WCA = TEF, 3a; BArCl, 3b; TEFCl, 3c). In contrast, for the arsenic derivatives 1b and 2b, no coupling reaction is observed. The underlying chemical processes are elucidated by quantum chemical computations.</dc:description>

         <title>New Strategy for Optimizing the Properties of Copper Halide Organic&#8208;Inorganic Hybrid Lighting&#8208;emitting Materials</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aiming to developing high&#8208;performance organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid luminescent materials, a new synthesis strategy has been reported, which can systematically design and synthesis copper(I) halide ionic hybrid structures with coordinated anionic coordinated modules, combining the covalent bonding and ionic bonding between inorganic and organic components into one structure, and use their synergistic effect to prepare high&#8208;performance copper(I) halide hybrid luminescent materials.







Abstract
Copper(I) halide organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid luminescent materials have many advantages, such as diverse structure, facile synthesis, high luminescent efficiency, tunable optical performance, etc., and show a broad application prospect in energy&#8208;saving lighting, display and other fields. However, compared with commercial rare&#8208;earth&#8208;metal&#8208;based phosphors, the reported hybrids generally suffer from poor stability and low luminescent efficiency, which are the bottleneck problem of their practical application. With the aim of developing high&#8208;performance organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid luminescent materials, a new synthesis strategy has been reported. This strategy can systematically design and synthesis copper(I) halide ionic hybrid structures by combining the covalent bonding and ionic bonding between inorganic and organic components into one structure, and use their synergistic effect to optimizing their properties. This design method is expected to develop high&#8208;performance organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid luminescent materials, promote the in&#8208;depth understanding of this field, and provide new ideas for the optimization of other types of hybrid materials.

         <title>Modeling Type&#8208;1 Iodothyronine Deiodinase with Peptide&#8208;Based Aliphatic Diselenides: Potential Role of Highly Conserved His and Cys Residues as a General Acid Catalyst</title>

         <dc:description>Type&#8208;1 iodothyronine deiodinase (ID&#8208;1) catalyzes the reductive elimination of 5'&#8208;I and 5&#8208;I on the phenolic and tyrosyl rings of thyroxine (T4), respectively. Chemically verifying whether I atoms with different chemical properties undergo deiodination through a common mechanism is challenging. Herein, we report the modeling of ID&#8208;1 using aliphatic diselenide (Se&#8211;Se) and selenenylsulfide (Se&#8210;S) compounds. Mechanistic investigations of deiodination using the ID&#8208;1&#8208;like reagents suggested that the 5'&#8208;I and 5&#8208;I deiodinations proceed via the same mechanism through an unstable intermediate containing a Se&#8226;&#8226;&#8226;I halogen bond between a selenolate anion, reductively produced from Se&#8210;Se (or Se&#8210;S) in the compound, and an I atom in T4. Moreover, imidazolium and thiol groups, which may act as general acid catalysts, promoted the heterolytic cleavage of the C&#8210;I bond in the Se&#8226;&#8226;&#8226;I intermediate, which is the rate&#8208;determining step, by donating a proton to the C atom.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is central to modern energy storage and conversion technologies for grid such as fuel cells and electrolysers, but challenges remain due to the lack of reliable, economic, and durable electrocatalysts. Here, we develop single crystal conductive black titanium (Ti  4  O  7  ) nanosheets (NSs) as a new precious metal carrier based on sacrificial hard templates and ultrasonic&#8208;assisted peeling, and deposit Pt clusters on the Ti  4  O  7  NSs induced by wetness impregnation under the irradiation of visible light (VI; 650 nm). Pt/Ti  4  O  7  NSs provide Ti  3+  , Pt  2+  , and Pt  0+  continuous active sites for the ORR multi&#8208;electron process, achieving synergy among them. The assistance of visible light not only makes more uniformly and smaller distribution of Pt nanoclusters, but also strengthens the charge transfer, constructing a strong metal&#8208;support interaction interface. VI&#8208;Pt/Ti  4  O  7  NSs show superior initial oxidation potential and mass activity of 1.61 A mg  &#8208;1  Pt  at a E  1/2  = 0.91 V, which is 9 times higher than that of commercial Pt/C. This work provides an effective strategy for achieving high&#8208;value applications of titanium sub&#8208;oxides and further explores the enhanced&#8208;interface in metals&#8208;Ti  n  O  2n&#8208;1  by light radiation.</dc:description>

         <title>Hijacking the Peptidoglycan Recycling Pathway of Escherichia coli to Produce Muropeptides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Soluble fragments of peptidoglycan called muropeptides are released from the cell wall of bacteria as part of their metabolism or as a result of biological stresses. These compounds trigger immune responses in mammals and plants. In bacteria, they play a major role in the induction of antibiotic resistance. The development of efficient methods to produce muropeptides is therefore desirable both to address their mechanism of action and to design new antibacterial and immunostimulant agents. Here, we engineered the peptidoglycan recycling pathway of Escherichia coli to produce N&#8208;acetyl&#8208;&#946;&#8208;D&#8208;glucosaminyl&#8208;(1&#8594;4)&#8208;1,6&#8208;anhydro&#8208;N&#8208;acetyl&#8208;&#946;&#8208;D&#8208;muramic acid (GlcNAc&#8208;anhMurNAc), a common precursor of Gram&#8208;negative and Gram&#8208;positive muropeptides. Inactivation of the hexosaminidase nagZ gene allowed the efficient production of this key disaccharide, providing access to Gram&#8208;positive muropeptides through subsequent chemical peptide conjugation. E. coli strains deficient in both NagZ hexosaminidase and amidase activities further enabled the in vivo production of Gram&#8208;negative muropeptides containing meso&#8208;diaminopimelic acid, a rarely available amino acid.</dc:description>

         <title>A Small&#8208;Molecule Probe with a Dual Function of miRNA Inhibition and Target identification</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>By virtue of their key roles in&#160;pathologies,&#160;miRNAs&#160;represent a promising class of therapeutic targets.&#160;While high&#8208;fidelity small&#8208;molecule modulators of miRNAs can be identified&#160;via&#160;high&#8208;throughput screening using cellular reporter systems, their modes of action are elusive due to the lack of proper tools. Here, we report a small&#8208;molecule probe, 1a, that is capable of elucidating its biological target along miRNA inhibition. Derived from norathyriol, a nature product, 1a possessed a bioorthogonal alkyne moiety for subsequent labeling&#160;via&#160;copper&#8208;catalyzed azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition chemistry. We demonstrated that 1a inhibited a panel of different miRNAs by blocking their loading onto argonaute 2 (AGO2), which is the key protein responsible for miRNA function. With the alkyne handle, we successfully identified AGO2 as an intracellular target of 1a. Therefore, this work presents a novel small&#8208;molecule tool for suppressing and probing miRNA regulatory pathways.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhancing Auxiliary&#8208;Mediated Native Chemical Ligation at Challenging Junctions with Pyridine Scaffolds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A properly positioned pyridine ring can speed up auxiliary&#8208;mediated native chemical ligation. A methoxy substituent increases auxiliary stability and facilitates rapid syntheses of long and multiphosphorylated multirepeat proteins and of head&#8208;to&#8208;tail cyclized peptides.







Abstract
To expand the scope of native chemical ligation (NCL) beyond reactions at cysteine, ligation auxiliaries are appended to the peptide N&#8208;terminus. After the introduction of a pyridine&#8208;containing auxiliary, which provided access to challenging junctions (proline or &#946;&#8208;branched amino acids), we herein probe the role of the pyridine&#8208;ring nitrogen. We observed side reactions leading to preliminary auxiliary loss. We describe a new easy to attach &#946;&#8208;mercapto&#8208;&#946;&#8208;(4&#8208;methoxy&#8208;2&#8208;pyridinyl)&#8208;ethyl (MMPyE) auxiliary, which 1) has increased stability; 2) enables NCL at sterically encumbered junctions (e.&#8201;g., Leu&#8208;Val); and 3) allows removal under mildly basic (pH&#8197;8.5) conditions was introduced. The synthesis of a 120 aa long peptide containing eight MUC5AC tandem repeats via ligation of two 60mers demonstrates the usefulness. Making use of hitherto unexplored NCL to tyrosine, the MMPyE auxiliary provided access to a head&#8208;to&#8208;tail&#8208;cyclized 21&#8208;mer peptide and a His6&#8208;tagged hexaphosphorylated peptide comprising 6 heptapeptide repeats of the RNA polymerase II C&#8208;terminal domain.

         <title>Analysis of the Magnetic Coupling in a Mn(II)&#8208;U(V)&#8208;Mn(II) Single Molecule Magnet</title>

Magnetization barrier in a {3&#8201;d&#8208;5&#8201;f&#8208;3&#8201;d} trimeric complex. The anisotropic magnetic properties of a {Mn(II)&#8208;U(V)&#8208;Mn(II)} SMM are modelled using ab initio calculations and Spin Hamiltonians.The magnetic coupling is strongly anisotropic and leads to the magnetization barrier.







Abstract
[{Mn(TPA)I}{UO2(Mesaldien)}{Mn(TPA)I}]I formula (here TPA=tris(2&#8208;pyridylmethyl)amine and Mesaldien=N,N&#8217;&#8208;(2&#8208;aminomethyl)diethylenebis(salicylidene imine)) reported by Mazzanti and coworkers (Chatelain et&#8197;al. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 2014, 53, 13434) is so far the best Single Molecule Magnet (SMM) in the {3d&#8211;5f} class of molecules exhibiting barrier height of magnetization reversal as high as 81.0&#8197;K. In this work, we have employed a combination of ab initio CAS and DFT methods to fully characterize this compound and to extract the relevant spin Hamiltonian parameters. We show that the signs of the magnetic coupling and of the g&#8208;factors of the monomers are interconnected. The central magnetic unit [UVO2]+ is described by a Kramers Doublet (KD) with negative g&#8208;factors, due to a large orbital contribution. The magnetic coupling for the {Mn(II)&#8208;U(V)} pair is modeled by an anisotropic exchange Hamiltonian: all components are ferromagnetic in terms of spin moments, the parallel component JZ twice larger as the perpendicular one J&#8869;. The spin density distribution suggests that spin polarization on the U(V) center favors the ferromagnetic coupling. Further, the JZ/J&#8869; ratio, which is related to the barrier height, was found to correlate to the corresponding spin contribution of the g&#8208;factors of the U(V) center. This correlation established for the first time offers a direct way to estimate this important ratio from the corresponding gS&#8208;values, which can be obtained using traditional ab initio packages and hence has a wider application to other {3d&#8211;5f} magnets. It is finally shown that the magnetization barrier height is tuned by the splitting of the [UVO2]+ 5&#8201;f orbitals.

&lt;p&gt;[{Mn(TPA)I}{UO2(Mesaldien)}{Mn(TPA)I}]I formula (here TPA=tris(2-pyridylmethyl)amine and Mesaldien=N,N&#8217;-(2-aminomethyl)diethylenebis(salicylidene imine)) reported by Mazzanti and coworkers (Chatelain et&#8197;al. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. &lt;b&gt;2014&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;i&gt;53&lt;/i&gt;, 13434) is so far the best Single Molecule Magnet (SMM) in the {3d&#8211;5f} class of molecules exhibiting barrier height of magnetization reversal as high as 81.0&#8197;K. In this work, we have employed a combination of ab initio CAS and DFT methods to fully characterize this compound and to extract the relevant spin Hamiltonian parameters. We show that the signs of the magnetic coupling and of the g-factors of the monomers are interconnected. The central magnetic unit [U&lt;sup&gt;V&lt;/sup&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; is described by a Kramers Doublet (KD) with negative g-factors, due to a large orbital contribution. The magnetic coupling for the {Mn(II)-U(V)} pair is modeled by an anisotropic exchange Hamiltonian: all components are ferromagnetic in terms of spin moments, the parallel component &lt;i&gt;J&lt;sub&gt;Z&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt; twice larger as the perpendicular one &lt;i&gt;J&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;&#8869;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt;. The spin density distribution suggests that spin polarization on the U(V) center favors the ferromagnetic coupling. Further, the &lt;i&gt;J&lt;sub&gt;Z&lt;/sub&gt;/J&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;&#8869;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt; ratio, which is related to the barrier height, was found to correlate to the corresponding spin contribution of the g-factors of the U(V) center. This correlation established for the first time offers a direct way to estimate this important ratio from the corresponding &lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sup&gt;-values, which can be obtained using traditional ab initio packages and hence has a wider application to other {3d&#8211;5f} magnets. It is finally shown that the magnetization barrier height is tuned by the splitting of the [U&lt;sup&gt;V&lt;/sup&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; 5&#8201;f orbitals.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Stereocontrol: We have studied the enantioselective transannular aminohalogenation of unsaturated medium&#8208;sized cyclic benzosulfonamides by using both chiral Br&#248;nsted acid and phase&#8208;transfer catalysis. The mechanism of the reaction was also studied by using computational tools; we observed that the key step for stereocontrol involves the participation of an interconverting planar chiral conformer of the nine&#8208;membered cyclic starting material







Abstract
We have studied the enantioselective transannular aminohalogenation reaction of unsaturated medium&#8208;sized cyclic benzosulfonamides by using both chiral Br&#248;nsted acid and phase&#8208;transfer catalysis. Under optimized conditions, a variety of bicyclic adducts can be obtained with good yields and high enantioselectivities. The mechanism of the reaction was also studied by using computational tools; we observed that the reaction involves the participation of a conformer of the nine&#8208;membered cyclic substrate with planar chirality in which the stereochemical outcome is controlled by the relative reactivity of the two pseudorotational enantiomers when interacting with the chiral catalyst.

         <title>Chemical Strategies for Dendritic Magneto&#8208;plasmonic Nanostructures Applied to Surface&#8208;Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dendritic nanoarchitectures allow myriads of chemical strategies for designing hybrid multifunctional materials containing magnetic and plasmonic nanoparticles. Poly(amidoamine) dendrimers are explored in a series of magneto&#8208;plasmonic substrates for surface&#8208;enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) detection of a pesticide dissolved in water. The Fe3O4 particles assist the magnetic separation of the dendritic sorbents from aqueous samples for subsequent SERS analysis of molecular adsorbates on gold.

         <title>Revealing Phosphorus Nitrides up to the Megabar Regime: Synthesis of &#945;&#8242;&#8208;P3N5, &#948;&#8208;P3N5 and PN2</title>

Phase in, phase out: Investigations of the phosphorus&#8211;nitrogen system in a laser&#8208;heated diamond anvil cell resulted in the synthesis of new &#948;&#8208;P3N5 and PN2 phases at 72 and 134&#8197;GPa, respectively. Their structures are composed of PN6 octahedra. Upon decompression, &#948;&#8208;P3N5 transforms into the novel &#945;&#8242;&#8208;P3N5 solid that is stable under ambient conditions.







Abstract
Non&#8208;metal nitrides are an exciting field of chemistry, featuring a significant number of compounds that can possess outstanding material properties. These properties mainly rely on maximizing the number of strong covalent bonds, with crosslinked XN6 octahedra frameworks being particularly attractive. In this study, the phosphorus&#8211;nitrogen system was studied up to 137&#8197;GPa in laser&#8208;heated diamond anvil cells, and three previously unobserved phases were synthesized and characterized by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy measurements and density functional theory calculations. &#948;&#8208;P3N5 and PN2 were found to form at 72 and 134&#8197;GPa, respectively, and both feature dense 3D networks of the so far elusive PN6 units. The two compounds are ultra&#8208;incompressible, having a bulk modulus of K0=322&#8197;GPa for &#948;&#8208;P3N5 and 339&#8197;GPa for PN2. Upon decompression below 7&#8197;GPa, &#948;&#8208;P3N5 undergoes a transformation into a novel &#945;&#8242;&#8208;P3N5 solid, stable at ambient conditions, that has a unique structure type based on PN4 tetrahedra. The formation of &#945;&#8242;&#8208;P3N5 underlines that a phase space otherwise inaccessible can be explored through materials formed under high pressure.

         <title>A Photochemical Macrocyclization Route to Asymmetric Strained [3.2] Paracyclophanes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel synthetic route to strained cyclophanes is reported, which involves the unexpected photochemical fusion of a carboxylic ester and a non&#8208;activated methyl group. Functional experiments suggest that the previously overlooked C&#8722;C bond forming reaction involves an excited triplet state and intramolecular hydrogen abstraction. Using a flow reactor, a series of otherwise difficult&#8208;to&#8208;synthesize cyclophanes with different substitution patterns were prepared







Abstract
The intricate frameworks of paracyclophanes are an important target for synthesis since they are found in various chiral auxiliaries, solar cells, high&#8208;performance plastics, pharmaceuticals, and molecular machines. Whereas numerous methods exist for the preparation of symmetric paracyclophanes, protocols for the efficient synthesis of strained asymmetric scaffolds are limited. Here we report a remarkably simple photochemical route to strained [3.2]paracyclophanes starting from readily available educts. By way of NMR and X&#8208;ray analyses, we discovered that UV&#8208;irradiation of an aromatic carboxylic ester tethered to a toluene moiety leads to the intramolecular formation of a new C&#8722;C bond, with loss of an alcohol. A systematic evaluation of the reaction conditions and substituents, as well as radical starter and triplet quenching experiments, point to a reaction mechanism involving an excited triplet state and hydrogen atom transfer. The new method proved to be robust and versatile enabling the synthesis of a range of cyclophanes with different substitutions, including an unusual diastereoisomer with two planar chiral centers, and thus proved to be a valuable addition to the synthetic toolbox.

         <title>E&#8208;selective Semi&#8208;hydrogenation of Alkynes under Mild Conditions by a Diruthenium Hydride Complex</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two do the job: Diruthenium hydrido carbonyl complexes bound to a PNNP expanded pincer ligand are described. Deprotonation of the methylene linkers enables cooperative activation of H2 allowing for the E&#8208;selective semi&#8208;hydrogenation of internal alkynes under mild conditions. Initial insights into the mechanism and the isolation of a deactivated species with an unusual structure are provided.







Abstract
The synthesis, characterization and catalytic activity of a new class of diruthenium hydrido carbonyl complexes bound to the tBuPNNP expanded pincer ligand is described. Reacting tBuPNNP with two equiv of RuHCl(PPh3)3(CO) at 140&#8201;&#176;C produces an insoluble air&#8208;stable complex, which was structurally characterized as [Ru2(tBuPNNP)H(&#956;&#8208;H)Cl(&#956;&#8208;Cl)(CO)2] (1) using solid&#8208;state NMR, IR and X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopies and follow&#8208;up reactivity. A reaction with KOtBu results in deprotonation of a methylene linker to produce [Ru2(tBuPNNP*)H(&#956;&#8208;H)(&#956;&#8208;OtBu)(CO)2] (3) featuring a partially dearomatized naphthyridine core. This enables metal&#8208;ligand cooperative activation of H2 analogous to the mononuclear analogue, [Ru(tBuPNP*)H(CO)]. In contrast to the mononuclear system, the bimetallic analogue 3 catalyzes the E&#8208;selective semi&#8208;hydrogenation of alkynes at ambient temperature and atmospheric H2 pressure with good functional group tolerance. Monitoring the semi&#8208;hydrogenation of diphenylacetylene by 1H NMR spectroscopy shows the intermediacy of Z&#8208;stilbene, which is subsequently isomerized to the E&#8208;isomer. Initial findings into the mode of action of this system are provided, including the spectroscopic characterization of a polyhydride intermediate and the isolation of a deactivated species with a partially hydrogenated naphthyridine backbone.

         <title>Towards Substrate&#8211;Reagent Interaction of Lochmann&#8211;Schlosser Bases in THF: Bridging THF Hides Potential Reaction Site of a Chiral Superbase</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The isolation of a new THF&#8208;solvated, ferrocene&#8208;based Lochmann&#8211;Schlosser base with all four components lithium, potassium, carbanion, and alkoxide led to the observation of new structural motifs with respect to these superbasic reagents. The &#8220;kick out&#8221; of a THF leads to the detachment, providing the typical Li/K reaction site, whereas the &#8220;smart pass&#8221; leads to the favorable THF&#8208;displacement and the K/K reaction site provided for substrates.







Abstract
The metalation of N,N&#8208;dimethylaminomethylferrocene in THF by the superbasic mixture of nBuLi/KOtBu proceeds readily at low temperatures to afford a bimetallic Li2K2 aggregate containing ferrocenyl anions and tert&#8208;butoxide. Starting from an enantiomerically enriched ortho&#8208;lithiated aminomethylferrocene, an enantiomerically pure superbase can be prepared. The molecular compound exhibits superbasic behavior deprotonating N,N&#8208;dimethylbenzylamine in the &#945;&#8208;position and is also capable of deprotonating toluene. Quantum chemical calculations provide insight into the role of the bridging THF molecule to the possible substrate&#8211;reagent interaction. In addition, a benzylpotassium alkoxide adduct gives a closer look into the corresponding reaction site of the Lochmann&#8211;Schlosser base that is reported herein.

         <title>Transition&#8208;Linker Containing Detergents for Membrane Protein Studies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
T&#8208;DDMs for membrane proteins: A series of &#8220;hydrophobicity&#8208;neutral&#8221; linkers were incorporated between the hydrophobic tail and hydrophilic maltose of the traditional detergent DDM. This remodeling strategy yielded T&#8208;DDMs, among which superior detergents with excellent physical properties and stabilization capability were identified, as illustrated in the NMR study of A2AAR.







Abstract
It is a pressing need, but still challenging to explore the structure and function of membrane proteins (MPs). One of the main obstacles is the limited availability of matched detergents for the handling of specific MPs. We describe herein the design of new detergents by incorporation of a transition linker between the hydrophilic head and the hydrophobic tail. This design allows a gradual change of hydrophobicity between the outside and inside of micelles, in contrast to the abrupt switch in conventional detergents. Notably, many of these detergents assembled into micelles in while retaining low critical micelle concentrations. Meanwhile, thermal stabilizing evaluation identified superior detergents for representative MPs, including G&#8197;protein&#8208;coupled receptors and a transporter protein. Among them, further improved the NMR study of MPs. We anticipate these that results will encourage future detergent expansion through new remodeling on the traditional detergent scaffold.

         <title>Dynamic Interactions between Brilliant Green and MscL Investigated by Solid&#8208;State NMR Spectroscopy and Molecular Dynamics Simulations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The mechanosensitive ion channel of large conductance (MscL) is a promising template for the development of new antibiotics due to its high conservation and uniqueness to microbes. Brilliant green (BG), a triarylmethane dye, has been identified as a new antibiotic targeting MscL. However, the detailed binding sites of BG to MscL and the dynamic pathway of BG through the MscL channel remain unknown. Here, we investigated the dynamic interactions between BG and MscL using solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy and molecule dynamics (MD) simulations. We identified residue site&#8208;specific binding sites of BG to the MscL channel by solid&#8208;state NMR. In addition, MD simulations revealed that BG conducts through the MscL channel via residues along the inner surface of the pore sequentially, in which the strong hydrophobic interactions between BG and hydrophobic residues F23 and I27 in the hydrophobic gate region of the MscL channel are major restrictions. Particularly, we demonstrated that BG activates the MscL channel by reducing the hydrophobicity of the F23 in the gate region by water molecules that are bound to BG. Taken together, these simulations and experimental data provide novel insights into the dynamic interactions between BG and MscL, based on which we can develop new hydrophobic antibiotics and adjuvants targeting MscL.</dc:description>

         <title>Interfacial C&#8722;S bonds of g&#8208;C3N4/Bi19Br3S27 S&#8208;scheme heterojunction for enhanced photocatalytic CO2 reduction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Step&#8208;scheme (S&#8208;scheme) heterojunctions have been extensively studied in photocatalytic carbon dioxide (CO2) reduction due to their excellent charge separation and high redox ability. The built&#8208;in electric field at the interface of S&#8208;scheme heterojunction serves as the driving force for charge transfer, however, the poor interfacial contact greatly restricts the carrier migration rate. Herein, we synthesized g&#8208;C3N4/Bi19Br3S27 S&#8208;scheme heterostructure through in&#8208;situ deposition of Bi19Br3S27 (BBS) on porous g&#8208;C3N4 (P&#8208;CN) nanosheets. The C&#8722;S bonds formed at the interface help to enhance the built&#8208;in electric field, thereby promoting the charge transfer and separation. As a result, the CO2 reduction reaction performance of 10%Bi19Br3S27/g&#8208;C3N4 (BBS/P&#8208;CN) reaches 32.78 &#956;mol g&#8722;1h&#8722;1, which is 341.4 and 18.7 times higher than that of pure BBS and P&#8208;CN, respectively. X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT&#8208;IR) prove the presence of chemical bonds (C&#8722;S) between the P&#8208;CN and BBS. The S&#8208;scheme charge transfer mechanism was analyzed via XPS and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. This work provides a new idea for designing heterojunction photocatalysts with interfacial chemical bonds to achieve high charge transfer and catalytic activity.</dc:description>

         <title>Tuning the Roundabout of Four&#8208;Point&#8208;Star Tiles with the Core Arm Length of Three Half&#8208;Turns for 2D DNA Arrays</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>By rationally adjusting the weaving modes of point&#8208;star tiles, the curvature inherent in the tiles can be changed, and various DNA nanostructures can be assembled, such as planar wireframe meshes, perforated wireframe tubes, and curved wireframe polyhedra. Based on the weaving and tiling architectures for traditional point&#8208;star tiles with the core arm length at two DNA half&#8208;turns, we improved the weaving modes of our newly reported four&#8208;point&#8208;star tiles with the core arm length at three half&#8208;turns to adjust their curvature and rigidity for assembling 2D arrays of DNA grids and tubes. Following our previous terms and methods to analyze the structural details of E&#8208;tiling tubes, we used the chiral indices (n,m) to describe the most abundant tube of typical assemblies; especially, we applied both one&#8208;locus and/or dual&#8208;locus biotin/streptavidin (SA) labeling strategies to define the configurations of two specific tubes, along with the absolute conformations of their component tiles. Such structural details of the DNA tubes composed of tiles with addressable concave and convex faces and packing directions should help us understand their physio&#8208;chemical and biological properties, and therefore promote their applications in drug delivery, biocatalysis, biomedicine, etc.</dc:description>

         <title>Orthogonal Crosslinking: A Strategy to Generate Novel Protein Topology and Function</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Compared to the disulfide bond, other naturally occurring intramolecular crosslinks have received little attention, presumably due to their rarity in vast protein space. Here we presented examples of natural non&#8208;disulfide crosslinks, which we refer to as orthogonal crosslinks, emphasizing their effect on protein topology and function. We summarized recent efforts on expanding orthogonal crosslinks using either the enzymes that catalyze protein circularization or the genetic code expansion strategy to add electrophilic amino acids site&#8208;specifically in proteins. The advantages and disadvantages of each method were discussed, along with their applications to generate novel protein topology and function. In particular, we highlighted our recent work on spontaneous orthogonal crosslinking, in which a carbamate&#8208;based crosslink was generated in situ, and its applications in designing orthogonally crosslinked domain antibodies with their topology mimicking bacterial adhesins.</dc:description>

         <title>Carbonyl&#8208;Containing Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Emitters for Narrowband Electroluminescence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Carbonyl&#8208;containing derivatives show enduring vitality in the field of thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) materials, which can realize high device efficiency by utilizing both singlet and triplet excitons for electroluminescence. And recently, the based on fused ketone/amine system exhibited huge potential for constructing multi resonance TADF (MR&#8208;TADF) emitters, which exhibit higher superiority for narrowband emission compared with conventional TADF emitters with twisted donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;A) structure. Herein, we summarized the current research progress of both traditional and MR types ketone derivatives with TADF characteristics for introducing the involved molecular design strategy of holding high&#8208;device efficiency and keeping narrowband emission profile simultaneously. We hope this review can inspire the emergence of more high&#8208;performance narrowband materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Advanced Covalent Organic Frameworks for Multi Valent Metal Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have received increased interest in recent years as an advanced class of materials. By virtue of the available monomers, multiple conformations and various linkages, COFs offer a wide range of opportunities for complex structural design and specific functional development of materials, which has facilitated the widespread application in many fields, including multi valent metal ion batteries (MVMIBs), described as the attractive candidate replacing lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs). With their robust skeletons, diverse pores, flexible structures and abundant functional groups, COFs are expected to help realize a high performance MVMIBs. In this review, we present an overview of COFs, describe advances in topology design and synthetic reactions, and study the application of COFs in MVMIBs, as well as discuss challenges and solutions in the preparation of COFs electrodes, in the hope of providing constructive insights into the future direction of COFs.</dc:description>

         <title>Tuning the Photocatalytic Performance of Ruthenium (II) Polypyridine Complexes Via Ligand Modification for Visible&#8208;Light Induced Phosphorylation of Tertiary Aliphatic Amines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Tuning the redox potential of commonly available photocatalyst to improve the catalytic performance or expand its scope for challenging synthetic conversions is an ongoing demand in synthetic chemistry. Herein, we tuned the excited state properties and redox potential of commercially available [Ru(bpy)3]2+ photocatalyst by modifying the structure of the bipyridine ligands with electron&#8208;donating/withdrawing units. We demonstrate the visible light&#8208;mediated photoredox phosphorylation of tertiary aliphatic amines under mild conditions. A series of cross&#8208;dehydrogenative coupling reactions were performed employing the RuII complexes as photocatalyst yielding the corresponding &#945;&#8208;aminophosphinoxides and &#945;&#8208;aminophosphonates via C&#8722;P bond formation.</dc:description>

         <title>Interactive Bioconjugation at N&#8208;terminal Cysteines using O&#8209;Salicylaldehyde Esters towards dual site&#8208;selective functionalization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>N&#8208;terminal Cys modification has been intensively studied to produce homogeneous bioconjugates essentially through two modes of reaction: reversible modification with the equilibrium shifted towards the formation of the desired conjugate or stable and irreversible conjugates. Herein, we report a new method of N&#8208;terminal cysteine modification using O&#8208;Salicylaldehyde Esters (OSAEs) through fast conjugation and irreversible deconjugation. These reagents can rapidly react with N&#8208;terminal Cys at low micromolar concentration to form thiazolidines with consequent hydrolysis of the ester moiety into the phenolic derivative. These phenolic thiazolidines can be hydrolyzed under acidic pH (&#8776;4.5) to recover the intact N&#8208;terminal Cys. Bioconjugation reactions using OSAEs offer controlled reversibility to as act as a protecting group for N&#8208;terminal cysteines, allowing the modification of in&#8208;chain residues without perturbing the N&#8208;terminal Cys which can then be deprotected and used as a conjugation site</dc:description>

         <title>Iron&#8208;Catalyzed Borylation of Propargylic Acetates for the Synthesis of Multisubstituted Allenylboronates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A novel iron&#8208;catalyzed borylation of propargylic acetates leading to allenylboronates was developed. The method allows preparation of a variety of di&#8208;, tri&#8208; and tetra&#8208;substituted allenylboronates at room temperature with good functional group compatibility. Stereo&#173;chemical studies show that an anti&#8208;SN2&#8217; displacement of acetate by boron occurs, which also allows chirality transfer to yield enantiomerically enriched allenyl&#173;boronates. The synthetic utility of this protocol is further substantiated by transformations of the obtained allenylboronates including oxidation and propargylation.</dc:description>

         <title>Oxidative Desymmetrization Enables the Concise Synthesis of a trans&#8208;Cyclooctene Linker for Bioorthogonal Bond&#8208;Cleavage</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Modified trans&#8208;cyclooctenes (TCO) are capable of highly efficient molecular manipulations in biological environments, driven by the bioorthogonal reaction with tetrazines (Tz). The development of click&#8208;cleavable TCO has fueled the field of in vivo chemistry and enabled the design of therapeutic strategies that have already started to enter the clinic. A key element for most of these approaches is the implementation of a cleavable TCO linker. So far, only one member of this class has been developed, a compound that requires a high synthetic effort, mainly to fulfill the multi&#8208;layered demands on its chemical structure. To tackle this limitation, we developed a dioxolane&#8208;fused cleavable TCO linker (dcTCO) that can be prepared in only 5 steps, applying an oxidative desymmetrization to achieve diastereoselective introduction of the required functionalities. Based on investigation of the structure, reaction kinetics, stability, and hydrophilicity of dcTCO, we demonstrate its bioorthogonal application in the design of a caged prodrug that can be activated via in situ Tz&#8208;triggered cleavage to achieve a remarkable &gt;1000&#8208;fold increase in cytotoxicity.</dc:description>

         <title>Shining a Light on Photoresponsive Type III Porous Liquids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Porous materials are the subject of extensive research because of potential applications in areas such as gas adsorption and molecular separations. Until recently, most porous materials were solids, but there is now an emerging class of materials known as porous liquids. The incorporation of intrinsic porosity or cavities in a liquid can result in free&#8208;flowing materials that are capable of gas uptakes that are significantly higher than conventional non&#8208;porous liquids. A handful of porous liquids have also been investigated for gas separations. Until now, the release of gas from porous liquids has relied on molecular displacement (e.g., by adding small solvent molecules), pressure or temperature swings, or sonication. Here, we explore a new method of gas release that involves photoisomerisable porous liquids comprising a photoresponsive MOF dispersed in an ionic liquid. This results in the selective uptake of CO  2  over CH  4  , and allows gas release to be controlled by using UV light.</dc:description>

         <title>A Potent Auto&#8208;Umpolung Ligand for Conjugative Radical Stabilization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Carbenes with conjugatively connected redox system act as &#8220;auto&#8208;umpolung&#8221; ligands. Due to their electronic flexibility, they should also be particularly suitable to stabilize open&#8208;shell species Herein, the first neutral radical of such sort is described in form of a dialkylamino&#8208;substituted bis(dicyanomethylen)cyclopropanide. Despite the absence of steric shielding, the radical is stable for an extended amount of time and was consequently characterized in solution via EPR measurements. These data and accompanying X&#8208;ray structural analyses indicate that the radical species is in equilibrium with aggregates (formed via &#960;&#8208;stacking) and dimers (obtained via &#963;&#8208;bond formation between methylene carbons).</dc:description>

         <title>Efficient Synthesis of Diaryl Quaternary Centers by Rh(II)/Xantphos Catalyzed Relay C&#8208;H Functionalization and Allylic Alkylation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A three&#8208;component reaction of  N, N  &#8208;disubstituted aniline, &#945;&#8208;diazo ester, and an allylic electrophile has been realized by [Rh(II)]  2  /Xantphos catalysis, providing a direct access to various aniline derivatives bearing diaryl allylic quaternary centers in good yields. The synthetic utility of this protocol was demonstrated by facile derivatization of the products for preparation of biologically relevant molecules and structural scaffolds, which offers a high potential for increasing the molecular diversity. Mechanistic studies identified &#945;, &#945;&#8208;diarylacetate species as an active intermediate, thereby revealing the presence of a C(  sp  2  )&#8208;H functionalization of aniline derivatives/allylic alkylation cascade in this attractive catalytic transformation.</dc:description>

         <title>Li2Ba4Al2Ta2N8O, the first barium nitridoalumotantalate with BCT&#8208;zeolite type structure</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>

The crystal structure of Li  2  Ba  4  Al  2  Ta  2  N  8  O has been determined by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and it crystallizes in the orthorhombic space group  Pnnm  (no. 58) with the lattice parameters  a  = 1006.71(3),  b  = 1026.58(3),  c  = 607.10(2) pm, and a volume of  V  = 0.62742(3) nm  3  . The compound is built up from AlN  4  and TaN  4  tetrahedra, which form a three&#8208;dimensional network corresponding to the BCT&#8208;zeolite type structure. Li  2  Ba  4  Al  2  Ta  2  N  8  O is homeotypic to Li  2  Sr  4  Si  4  N  8  O and Li  2  Sr  4  Al  2  Ta  2  N  8  O but, additionally, it could be successfully doped with the activator ion Eu  2+  and hence features an experimental observed overall emission at &#120582;  max  = 565 nm (fwhm = 89 nm) consisting of a superposition of two adjusted emission bands at &#120582;  max  = 557 nm (fwhm = 69 nm) and at &#120582;  max  = 604 nm (fwhm = 102 nm).</dc:description>

         <title>Dielectric Relaxation and Dielectric Switching Behaviors in (N,N&#8208;diisopropylethylamine) Tetrachloroantimonate(III)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dielectric switches have drawn renewed attention to the study of their many potential applications with the adjustable switch temperatures (  T  s  ). Herein, a novel antimony&#8208;based halide semiconductor, (  N  ,  N  &#8208;diisopropylethylamine) tetrachloroantimonate (  (DIPEA)SbCl  4  , DIPEA  +  =  N  ,  N  &#8208;diisopropylethylamine), with dielectric relaxation behavior and dielectric switches has been successfully synthesized. This compound consisted of the coordinated anion  [[EQUATION]]  chains and isolated DIPEA  +  cations undergoes an isostructural order&#8208;disorder phase transition and shows a step&#8208;like dielectric anomaly, which can function as a frequency&#8208;tuned dielectric switch with highly adjustable switch temperature (  T  s  ). The variable&#8208;temperature single&#8208;crystal structure analyses and first&#8208;principles molecular dynamics simulations give the information about the general mechanisms of molecular dynamics. This work enriches the dielectric switch family, and proves that hybrid metal halides are promising candidates for the switchable physical or chemical properties.</dc:description>

         <title>Unprecedented Combination of Polyketide Natural Product Fragments Identifies the New Hedgehog Signaling Pathway Inhibitor Grismonone</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The chemical evolution of polyketide natural products leads to the unprecedented combination of biosynthetically related fragments in arrangements not found in Nature. The pseudo&#8208;natural product grismonone was identified to be a potent inhibitor of Hedgehog signaling &#8211; a bioactivity that is not shared by its guiding fragments.







Abstract
Pseudo&#8208;natural products (pseudo&#8208;NPs) are de novo combinations of natural product (NP) fragments that define novel bioactive chemotypes. For their discovery, new design principles are being sought. Previously, pseudo&#8208;NPs were synthesized by the combination of fragments originating from biosynthetically unrelated NPs to guarantee structural novelty and novel bioactivity. We report the combination of fragments from biosynthetically related NPs in novel arrangements to yield a novel chemotype with activity not shared by the guiding fragments. We describe the synthesis of the polyketide pseudo&#8208;NP grismonone and identify it as a structurally novel and potent inhibitor of Hedgehog signaling. The insight that the de novo combination of fragments derived from biosynthetically related NPs may also yield new biologically relevant compound classes with unexpected bioactivity may be considered a chemical extension or diversion of existing biosynthetic pathways and greatly expands the opportunities for exploration of biologically relevant chemical space by means of the pseudo&#8208;NP principle.

         <title>Aluminum&#8208;Catalyzed Selective Hydroboration of Esters and Epoxides to Alcohols: C&#8208;O Bond Activation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this work, the molecular aluminum dihydride complex bearing an N, N&#8217;&#8208;chelated conjugated bis&#8208;guanidinate (CBG) ligand is used as a catalyst for reducing a wide range of aryl and alkyl esters with good tolerance of alkene (C=C), alkyne (C&#8801;C), halides (Cl, Br, I and F), nitrile (C&#8801;N), and nitro (NO2) functionalities. Further, we investigated the catalytic application of aluminum dihydride in the C&#8208;O bond cleavage of alkyl and aryl epoxides into corresponding branched Markovnikov ring&#8208;opening products. In addition, the chemoselective intermolecular reduction of esters over other reducible functional groups, such as amides and alkenes, has been established. Intermediates are isolated and characterized by NMR and HRMS studies, which confirm the probable catalytic cycles for the hydroboration of esters and epoxides.</dc:description>

         <title>Excitation&#8208;Wavelength&#8208;dependent Functionalities of Temporally&#8208;controlled Sensing and Generation of Singlet Oxygen by a Photoexcited State Engineered Rhodamine 6G&#8208;anthracene Conjugate</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The present study provides design guidance for unique multipotent molecules that sense and generate singlet oxygen (  1  O  2  ). A rhodamine 6G&#8208;aminomethylanthracene&#8208;linked donor&#8208;acceptor molecule (  RA  ) is designed and synthesized for demonstrating wavelength&#8208;dependent functionalities as follows; (i)  RA  acts as a conventional fluorogenic  1  O  2  sensor molecule like the commercially available reagent, singlet oxygen sensor green (SOSG), when it absorbs ultraviolet (UV)&#8208;visible light and reacts with  1  O  2  . (ii)  RA  acts as a temporally&#8208;controlled  1  O  2  sensing reagent under the longer wavelength (~700 nm) photosensitization.  RA  enters an intermediate state after capturing  1  O  2  and does not become strongly fluorescent until it is exposed to UV, blue, or green light. (iii)  RA  acts as an efficient photosensitizer to generate  1  O  2  under green light illumination. The spin&#8208;orbit charge transfer mediated intersystem crossing (SOCT&#8208;ISC) process achieves this function, and  RA  shows a potential cancer&#8208;killing effect on pancreatic cancer cells. The wavelength&#8208;switchable functionalities in  RA  offer to promise molecular tools to apply  1  O  2  in a spatiotemporal manner.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Protonated achiral H2TPPS4 spontaneously self&#8208;arranges at acids pH and high ionic strength to build mesoscopic J&#8208;aggregates that are intrinsically chiral. According to the symmetry rule aggregation leads to a racemate that, however, can be unbalanced by chemical (chiral pollutants) or physical stimuli (as vortexing the solution). Vortexing the title racemate, in principle, might either induce chiral separation or chiral enrichment. Indeed, herein it is shown that vortices enable the resolution of this racemic solution exploiting the tendency to deposit, onto the quartz cuvette walls, of the enantiomer favoured by the stirring sense. Simultaneously, over time, it was found that the opposite chiral conformation becomes prevalent in solution realizing a significant enantiomeric resolution. Therefore, after removing all stirring&#8208;favoured chiral J&#8208;aggregate from the solution, the recovering and isolating of the desired enantiomers from the cuvette walls was successfully obtained without complex procedures. In this sense, it has been demonstrated that the stirring forces are executively able to fulfil the chiral separation in H2TPPS4 J&#8208;aggregates, employed as model of a self&#8208;assembled system in aqueous solution.</dc:description>

         <title>An Extremely Stable Interprotein Tetrahedral Hg(Cys)4 Core Formed in the Zinc Hook Domain of Rad50 Protein at Physiological pH</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In nature, thiolate&#8208;based systems are the primary targets of divalent mercury (HgII) toxicity. The formation of Hg(Cys)x cores in catalytic and structural protein centers mediates mercury&#8217;s toxic effects and ultimately leads to cellular damage. Multiple studies have revealed distinct HgII&#8208;thiolate coordination preferences, among which the linear HgII complexes are the most commonly observed in solution at physiological pH. Trigonal or tetrahedral geometries are formed at basic pH or in tight intraprotein Cys&#8208;rich metal sites. So far, no interprotein tetrahedral HgII complex formed at neutral pH has been reported. Rad50 protein is a part of the multiprotein MRN complex, a major player in DNA damage repair processes. Its central region consists of a conserved CXXC motif that enable dimerization of two Rad50 molecules by coordinating ZnII. Dimerized motifs form a unique interprotein zinc hook domain (Hk), which is critical for the biological activity of the MRN. Using a series of length&#8208;differentiated peptide models of the P. furiosus zinc hook domain, we investigated its interaction with HgII. Using UV&#8208;Vis, CD, and PAC spectroscopies as well as anisotropy decay, and 199Hg&#8208;NMR, we discovered that all Rad50 fragments form preferentially homodimeric Hg(Hk)2 species with a distorted tetrahedral HgS4 coordination environment at physiological pH, which is the first example of an interprotein mercury site displaying tetrahedral geometry in solution. At higher HgII content, monomeric HgHk complexes with linear geometry are formed. The Hg(Cys)4 core of Rad50 is extremely stable and does not compete with cyanides, NAC, or DTT. Applying ITC, we found that the stability constant of the Rad50 Hg(Hk)2 complex is approximately three orders of magnitude higher than those of the strongest HgII complexes known to date.</dc:description>

         <title>Divergent Copper&#8208;salt&#8208;controlled Reactions of Donor&#8208;Acceptor Cyclopropanes and N&#8208;Fluorobenzene Sulfonimide: Access to the 1,3&#8208;Haloamines and Aminoindanes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We herein report a method for divergent copper salt controlled reactions of donor&#8208;acceptor cyclopropanes and  N  &#8208;fluorobenzene sulfonimide (NFSI). Specifically, in the presence of CuX  2  (X = Cl, Br), the cyclopropanes underwent  formal  umpolung 1,3&#8208;aminohalogenation bifunctionalization via a free radical mediated ring&#8208;opening process to afford 1,3&#8208;aminochlorination and 1,3&#8208;aminobromination products in moderate to good yields. In addition, by using CuI as a catalyst, we synthesized various aminoindane derivatives via 1,3&#8208;aminoarylation cyclizations of D&#8208;A cyclopropanes, the reactions involved a free radical mediated ring&#8208;opening and subsequent ring expansion via C&#8211;H bond activation.</dc:description>

         <title>Photoredox&#8208;Mediated Deoxygenative Radical Additions of Aromatic Acids to Vinyl Boronic Esters and gem&#8208;Diborylalkenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A new method to access &#946;&#8208;keto&#8208; gem &#8208;diborylalkanes, by direct deoxygenative radical addition of aromatic carboxylic acids to gem &#8208;dibortlalkenes, is described. The reaction proceeds under mild photoredox catalysis and involves the photochemical C&#8211;O bond activation of aromatic carboxylic acids in the presence of PPh 3 . It generates an acyl radical, which further undergoes an additional reaction with gem &#8208;diborylalkenes to form an &#945;&#8208; gem&#8208; diboryl alkyl radical intermediate, which then reduces to the corresponding anion, which after protonation, affords the &#946;&#8208;keto&#8208; gem diborylalkane product. Moreover, the same scenario has been extended to the vinyl boronic esters, e.g., gem &#8208;Ar, Bpin&#8208;alkenes. Importantly, this protocol provides a general platform for the late&#8208;stage functionalization of bio&#8208;active and drug molecules containing a carboxylic acid group.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of an Antimicrobial Enterobactin&#8208;Muraymycin Conjugate for Improved Activity against Gram&#8208;negative Bacteria</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Overcoming increasing antibiotic resistance requires the development of novel antibacterial agents that address new targets in bacterial cells. Naturally occurring nucleoside antibiotics (such as muraymycins) inhibit the bacterial membrane protein MraY, a clinically unexploited essential enzyme in peptidoglycan (cell wall) biosynthesis. Even though a range of synthetic muraymycin analogues has already been reported, they generally suffer from limited cellular uptake and a lack of activity against Gram&#8208;negative bacteria. We herein report an approach to overcome these hurdles: a synthetic muraymycin analogue has been conjugated to a siderophore, i.e. the enterobactin derivative EntKL, to increase the cellular uptake into Gram&#8208;negative bacteria. The resultant conjugate showed significantly improved antibacterial activity against an efflux&#8208;deficient E. coli strain, thus providing a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept of this novel approach and a starting point for the future optimisation of such conjugates towards potent agents against Gram&#8208;negative pathogens.</dc:description>

         <title>Programmable Photocatalytic Activity of Multivariate Covalent Organic Frameworks Used as Metallaphotocatalysts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The multivariate approach allows to incorporate several functionalities into a single covalent organic framework (COF) and consequently allows the construction of bifunctional materials for cooperative catalysis. The well&#8208;defined structure of such multivariate COFs is furthermore ideally suited for structure&#8208;activity relationship studies. We report a series of multivariate COFs that contain acridine&#8208; and 2,2&#8217;&#8208;bipyridine linkers connected through 1,3,5&#8208;benzenetrialdehyde derivatives. The acridine motif is responsible for broad light absorption, while the bipyridine unit enables complexation of nickel catalysts. These features enable usage of the framework materials as catalysts for light&#8208;mediated carbon&#8211;heteroatom cross&#8208;couplings. Variation of the node units shows that the catalytic activity correlates to the keto&#8208;enamine tautomer isomerism. This allows switching between high charge&#8208;carrier mobility and persistent, localized charge&#8208;separated species depending on the nodes, a tool to tailor the materials for specific reactions. Moreover, nickel&#8208;loaded COFs are recyclable and catalyze cross&#8208;couplings even using red light irradiation.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly Cytotoxic Molybdenocenes with&#160;Strong Metabolic Effects Inhibit Tumour Growth in Mice</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A series of six highly lipophilic Cp&#8208;substituted molybdenocenes bearing different bioactive chelating ligands was synthesized and characterized by NMR spectroscopy, mass spectrometry and X&#8208;ray crystallography.  In vitro  experiments showed a greatly increased cytotoxic potency when compared to the non&#8208;Cp&#8208;substituted counterparts.  In vivo  experiments performed with the dichlorido precursor, (Ph2C&#8208;Cp)2MoCl2  and the in vitro most active complex, containing the thioflavone ligand, showed an inhibition of tumour growth. Proteomic studies on the same two compounds demonstrated a significant regulation of tubulin&#8208;associated and mitochondrial inner membrane proteins for both compounds and a strong metabolic effect of the thioflavone containing complex.</dc:description>
