         <dc:description>Mild and inexpensive copper&#8208;catalyzed aromatization&#8208;driven ring&#8208;opening amination and oxygenation of spiro dihydroquinazolinones are presented, respectively. These protocols provide facile and atom&#8208;economical access to the aminated and the carbonyl&#8208;containing quinazolin&#8208;4(3H)&#8208;ones in good yields with good functional group compatibility, which are difficult to obtain by conventional methods. Remarkably, a telescoped procedure involving the condensation and the ring&#8208;opening/functionalization for simple cycloalkanone was found to be accessible. Mechanistic studies suggest a radical pathway for this transformation.</dc:description>

         <title>Solvent&#8208;regulated Formation of Metal/Metal&#8208;oxo Nodes in Two Indium Metal&#8208;organic Frameworks: Syntheses, Structures, Selective Gas Adsorption and Fluorescence Sensor Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two water&#8208;stable indium metal&#8208;organic frameworks, (NH2Me2)3[In3(BTB)4]&#183;12DMA&#183;4.5H2O (In&#8208;MOF&#8208;1) and (NH2Me2)9[In9O6(BTB)8(H2O)4(DMSO)4]&#183;27DMSO&#183;21H2O (In&#8208;MOF&#8208;2) (BTB = 4,4&#162;,4&#162;&#162;&#8208;benzene&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;tribenzoate) with 3D interpenetrate structure has been constructed by regulating solvents. Structure analysis revealed that In&#8208;MOF&#8208;1 has a three&#8208;dimensional (3D) structure with a single metal core, while In&#8208;MOF&#8208;2 features an octahedron cage constructed by three kinds of metal clusters to further form a 3D structure. The fluorescence investigations show that In&#8208;MOF&#8208;1 and In&#8208;MOF&#8208;2 are potential MOF&#8208;based fluorescent sensors to detect acetone and Fe3+ ions in EtOH or water with high sensitivity, excellent selectivity, recyclability and a low detection limit. Moreover, the fluorescence mechanisms of In&#8208;MOF&#8208;1 and In&#8208;MOF&#8208;2 toward acetone and Fe3+ ions were further explained. In addition, In&#8208;MOF&#8208;2 has higher thermal and framework stability than In&#8208;MOF&#8208;1. The activated In&#8208;MOF&#8208;2 presents a high BET surface area of 998.82 m2g&#8208;1 and a pore size distribution of 8 to 16 &#197;. At the same time, In&#8208;MOF&#8208;2 exhibits high selective CO2 adsorption for CO2/CH4 and CO2/N2, respectively. Furthermore, the adsorption sites and adsorption isotherms were predicted using Grand Canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) simulations, and the adsorption energy of the lowest&#8208;energy adsorption configuration was calculated using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations.</dc:description>

         <title>Effects of Ring Functionalization in Anthracene&#8208;Based Cyclophanes on the Binding Properties Toward Nucleotides and DNA</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Supramolecular recognition of nucleobases and short sequences is an emerging research field focusing on possible applications to treat many diseases. Controlling the affinity and selectivity of synthetic receptors to target desired nucleotides or short sequences is a highly challenging task. Herein, we elucidate the effect of substituents in the phenyl ring of the anthracene&#8208;benzene azacyclophane on the recognition of nucleoside triphosphates (NTPs) and double&#8208;stranded DNA. We show that introducing phenyl rings increases the affinity for NTPs 10&#8208;fold and implements groove and intercalation binding modes with double&#8208;stranded DNA. NMR studies and molecular modeling calculations support the ability of cyclophanes to encapsulate nucleobases as part of nucleotides.</dc:description>

         <title>Visible Light&#8208;Mediated Late&#8208;Stage Thioetherification of Mercaptopurine Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
We disclose herein a novel and general radical approach to alkylthiopurines, encompassing 4 types of thiopurines, as well as their corresponding ribosides. This strategy is achieved through visible light&#8208;mediated late&#8208;stage functionalization of the sulfur atoms of mercaptopurines. The in&#8197;situ&#8208;generated disulfide was proposed as the pivotal neutral intermediate for this transformation. We present herein a novel photo&#8208;mediated homolytic C&#8722;S bond formation for the preparation of alkylthiopurines and alkylthiopurine nucleosides. Despite the presence of reactive sites for the Minisci reaction, chemoselective S&#8208;alkylation remained the predominant pathway. This method allows for the late&#8208;stage introduction of a broad spectrum of alkyl groups onto the sulfur atom of unprotective mercaptopurine derivatives, encompassing 2&#8208;, 6&#8208;, and 8&#8208;mercaptopurine rings. Organoborons serve as efficient and eco&#8208;friendly alkylating reagents, providing advantages in terms of readily availability, stability, and reduced toxicity. Further derivatization of the thioetherified nucleosides, together with anti&#8208;tumor assays, led to the discovery of potent anti&#8208;tumor agents with an IC50 value reaching 6.1&#8197;&#956;M (Comp. 31 for Jurkat).

         <title>Quantum Mechanical Cluster Models for Calculations on Enzymatic Reaction Mechanisms: Set&#8208;Up and Accuracy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Enzymes turnover substrates into products with amazing efficiency and selectivity and as such have great potential for use in biotechnology and pharmaceutical applications. However, details of their catalytic cycles and the origins surrounding the regio&#8208; and chemoselectivity of enzymatic reaction processes remain unknown, which makes the engineering of enzymes and their use in biotechnology challenging. Computational modelling can assist experimental work in the field and establish the factors that influence the reaction rates and the product distributions. A popular approach in modelling is the use of quantum mechanical cluster models of enzymes that take the first&#8208; and second coordination sphere of the enzyme active site into consideration. These QM cluster models are widely applied but often the results are dependent on model choice and selection. Herein, we show that QM cluster models can produce highly accurate results that reproduce experimental product distributions and free energies of activation, regarded that large cluster models with &gt;300 atoms are used. In this tutorial review, we give general guidelines on the set&#8208;up and applications of the QM cluster method and discuss its accuracy and reproducibility. Finally, several representative QM cluster model examples on metal&#8208;containing enzymes are presented, which highlight the strength of the approach.</dc:description>

         <title>Structure&#8208;Activity Relationship of Fluorinated Benzenesulfonamides as Inhibitors of Amyloid&#8208;&#946; Aggregation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Amyloid&#8208;beta aggregation is considered one of the factors influencing the onset of the Alzheimer's disease. Early prevention of such aggregation should alleviate disease condition by applying small molecule compounds that shift the aggregation equilibrium toward the soluble form of the peptide or slow down the process. We have discovered that fluorinated benzenesulfonamides of particular structure slowed the amyloid&#8208;beta peptide aggregation process by more than three&#8208;fold. We synthesized a series of ortho&#8208;para and meta&#8208;para double&#8208;substituted fluorinated benzenesulfonamides that inhibited the aggregation process to a variable extent yielding a detailed picture of the structure&#8208;activity relationship. Analysis of compound chemical structure effect on aggregation in artificial cerebrospinal fluid showed the necessity to arrange the benzenesulfonamide, hydrophobic substituent, and benzoic acid in a particular way. The amyloid beta peptide aggregate fibril structures varied in cross&#8208;sectional height depending on the applied inhibitor indicating the formation of a complex with the compound. Application of selected inhibitors increased the survivability of cells affected by the amyloid beta peptide. Such compounds may be developed as drugs against Alzheimer&#8217;s disease.</dc:description>

We have discovered that fluorinated benzenesulfonamides of particular structure slowed the amyloid-beta peptide aggregation process by more than three-fold. We synthesized a series of ortho-para and meta-para double-substituted fluorinated benzenesulfonamides that inhibited the aggregation process to a variable extent yielding a detailed picture of the structure-activity relationship. Analysis of compound chemical structure effect on aggregation in artificial cerebrospinal fluid showed the necessity to arrange the benzenesulfonamide, hydrophobic substituent, and benzoic acid in a particular way. The amyloid beta peptide aggregate fibril structures varied in cross-sectional height depending on the applied inhibitor indicating the formation of a complex with the compound. Application of selected inhibitors increased the survivability of cells affected by the amyloid beta peptide. Such compounds may be developed as drugs against Alzheimer&#8217;s disease.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Low&#8208;temperature Reduction of NOx by NH3 with Unity Conversion on Nanofilament MnO2/Activated Semi&#8208;Coke Catalyst</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Selective catalytic reduction of nitrogen oxides with NH3 at low temperatures remains a key goal for industrial applications. However, effective catalysts operating at 90 oC are rarely reported, limiting SCR scenarios to high&#8208;temperature conditions. Herein, we report a unique MnO2 nanofilament catalyst grown on activated semi&#8208;coke synthesized via a one&#8208;step in situ hydrothermal approach, which exhibits a stable and marked 100% conversion rate of NO to N2 with 100% selectivity at 90 oC, superior to the other prepared structures (nanowires, nanorods, and nanotubes). Temperature&#8208;programmed desorption shows a large number of acid sites on MnO2(NFs)/ASC, benefiting the formation of NH4+ ions. Meanwhile, diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy reveals the activation of NO with O2 to form bidentate nitrate/bridging nitrate NO2 intermediates via bidentate nitrate species, triggering the Fast SCR with NH3 at low temperatures. Such an effective, easy&#8208;to&#8208;prepare, and low&#8208;cost catalyst paves a new pathway for low&#8208;temperature SCR for a wide range of application scenarios.</dc:description>

         <title>Machine Learning Interatomic Potentials for Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Atomistic modeling can provide insights into the design of novel catalysts in modern industries of chemistry, materials science, and biology. Classical force fields and&#160;ab initio&#160;calculations have been widely adopted in molecular simulations. How&#8208; ever, these methods suffer from the drawbacks of either low accuracy or high cost. Recently, the development of machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) has become more and more popular as they can tackle the problems in question and can deliver rather accurate results at significantly lower computational cost. In this review, the atomistic modeling of catalytic systems with the aid of MLIPs is discussed, showcasing recently developed MLIP models and selected applications for the modeling of catalytic systems. We also highlight the best practices, and challenges for MLIPs and give an outlook for future works on MLIPs in the field of catalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Attenuating Nucleophilicity of Titanocene Hydrides beyond Steric Effects en Route to Fatty Alcohols</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Here, we introduce a new class of titanocene catalysts for epoxide hydrosilylation that frustrates their hydridicity and thereby emphasizes their electron transfer reactivity. This unique attenuation of hydridicity is accomplished by introducing Lewis acidic silicon centers to the cyclopentadienyl ligands for an intramolecular coordination of the titanium bound hydride. The superiority of our rationally designed catalysts over classic titanocenes with alkyl substituted cyclopentadienyl ligands is demonstrated in the dramatically improved regioselectivity of the hydrosilylation of monosubstituted epoxides to primary alcohols.</dc:description>

         <title>Tetradentate Pt(II) complexes based on xylenylamino linked dual pyrazolate chelates for organic light emitting diodes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this work, we report the syntheses of three Pt(II) emitters, namely, Pt4N1, Pt4N2, and Pt4N3, to which their tetradentate chelates were assembled by linking two pyrazolate chelates with a single xylenylamino entity. Functionalization of Pt4N1 was achieved upon addition of electronegative CF3 substituent on pyridinyl groups and switching to more electron deficient pyrazinyl groups in giving Pt4N2 and Pt4N3, respectively. The vertical arranged xylenylamino entity has effectively suppressed the inter&#8208;molecular &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking and Pt&#183;&#183;&#183;Pt interaction, as shown by the single crystal X&#8208;ray structural analyses. Upon fabrication of OLED devices, Pt4N2 and Pt4N3 based devices delivered efficient cyan and green emission, with an EQEmax of 15.2% and 11.2%, respectively, affirming the successfulness of the tetradentate chelating strategy.</dc:description>

         <title>Fabrication of&#160;A&#160;Multi&#8208;functional Separator&#160;Incorporating Crown ether&#8208;&#160;Polyoxometalate&#160;Supramolecular Compound&#160;for&#160;Lithium&#8208;Sulfur&#160;Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Recently, research on polyoxometalates (POMs) has gained significant momentum. Owing to their properties as electronic sponges, POMs catalyst&#160;harbor substantial potential in lithium&#8208;sulfur battery research. However, POMs undergo a transformation into reduced heteropoly blue (HPB) during electrochemical reactions, which then dissolve into the electrolyte, resulting in&#160;catalyst loss. In this research, we amalgamated 18&#8208;crown&#8208;6&#160;(CR6)&#160;with K3PW12O40, (KPW), synthesized a novel POM&#8208;based&#160;supramolecular compound, and integrated it with graphene oxide&#160;(GO) to fabricate a multi&#8208;functional composite polypropylene (PP) separator&#160;KPW&#8208;CR6/GO/PP. The crown ether array was employed to immobilize&#160;POM and construct ion transport channels, thereby enhancing the Li+&#160;migration rate and capturing polysulfides. Subsequently, leveraging the stable structure and redox properties of POM, the polysulfide is catalyzed to transform and inhibit the shuttle effect, thereby protecting the Li&#160;anode.&#160;The lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries with the Crown ether&#8208;POM supramolecular compound&#160;separators, exhibit enhanced capacity and stability (1073.3&#160;mAh g&#8208;1&#160;at 1.0&#160;C, and 81.5% retention rate after 250 cycles). The&#160;battery (S&#160;loading:&#160;3.2 mg cm&#8722;2) presents an initial specific discharge capacity of 543.4 mAh g&#8722;1&#160;at 0.5 C, with 89.8% of the capacity retained after 160 cycles.&#160;This&#160;underlines&#160;the practical application potential of Crown ether&#8208;POM supramolecular materials in Li&#8722;S batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Dual aliovalent dopants Cu, Mn engineered eco&#8208;friendly QDs for ultra&#8208;stable anti&#8208;counterfeiting</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Doping in semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) using optically active dopants tailors their optical, electronic, and magnetic properties beyond what is achieved by controlling size, shape, and composition. Herein, we synergistically modulated the optical properties of eco&#8208;friendly ZnInSe2/ZnSe core/shell QDs by incorporating Cu&#8208;doping and Mn&#8208;alloying into their core and shell to investigate their use in anti&#8208;counterfeiting and information encryption. The engineered &#8220;Cu:ZnInSe2/Mn:ZnSe&#8221; core/shell QDs exhibit an intense bright orange photoluminescence (PL) emission centered at 606 nm, with better color purity than controlled QDs. The average PL lifetime is significantly prolonged to 201 ns, making it relevant for complex encryption and anti&#8208;counterfeiting. PL studies reveal that in Cu:ZnInSe2/Mn:ZnSe, the photophysical emission arises from the Cu state via radiative transition from the Mn 4T1 state. Integration of Cu:ZnInSe2/Mn:ZnSe core/shell QDs into poly(methyl methacrylate) serves as versatile smart concealed luminescent inks for both writing and printing patterns. The features of these printed patterns using Cu:ZnInSe2/Mn:ZnSe core/shell QDs persisted after 10 weeks of water&#8208;soaking and retained 70% of their PL emission intensity at 170 &#176;C, demonstrating excellent thermal stability. This work provides an efficient approach to enhance both the emission and stability of eco&#8208;friendly QDs via dopant engineering for fluorescence anti&#8208;counterfeiting applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Lewis Acid Catalyzed Cyclopropane Ring&#8208;Opening&#8208;Cyclization Cascade Using Thioureas as a N,N&#8208;bisnucleophile: Synthesis of Bicyclic Furo&#8208;, Pyrano&#8208;, and Pyrrololactams via a Formal [4+1]&#8208;Addition</title>

         <dc:description>
A formal [4+1]&#8208;cycloaddition of bicyclic D&#8722;A cyclopropanes and thioureas, acting as N,N&#8208;bisnucleophiles, is developed to synthesize analogs of prevalent furolactones, i.&#8201;e. furolactams and related heterocycles.







Abstract
Fused bicyclic cyclopropanes were converted by Lewis acid&#8208;catalysis with thioureas to furo&#8208;, pyrano, and pyrrololactams with yields of up to 99&#8201;% and high diastereoselectivity. The formation of the title compounds, representing a formal [4+1]&#8208;cycloaddition to a donor&#8208;acceptor substituted cyclopropane, follows a cascade reaction involving SN1&#8208;type ring&#8208;opening addition and cyclization. Thiourea, being a cost&#8208;effective and odorless reagent, acts as an N,N&#8208;bis&#8208;nucleophile to generate bicyclic compounds containing an N&#8208;substituted &#947;&#8208;lactam moiety.

         <title>Encapsulation of Cu(II) Terpyridine Complexes into Polymeric Nanoparticles for Enhanced Anticancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, the chemical synthesis and biological evaluation of the encapsulation of a Cu(II) terpyridine complex with the polymer Pluronic F&#8208;127/Poloxamer&#8208;407 into polymeric nanoparticles for anticancer therapy is reported. The nanoparticles were able to overcome the pharmacological shortcomings of the molecular agent and induced a strong therapeutic effect in the nanomolar range.







Abstract
Cancer is one of the deadliest diseases worldwide. One of the most commonly applied therapeutic techniques to combat this disease is chemotherapy. Despite its success, the majority of clinically applied chemotherapeutic agents are associated with strong side effects and drug resistance. To overcome this limitation, much research efforts are devoted toward the development of new anticancer agents. Among the most promising class of compounds, Cu(II) complexes have emerged. Despite their strong cytotoxic effect, these agents are typically associated with low water solubility, low stability, and poor tumor selectivity. To overcome these limitations, herein, we report on the encapsulation of a promising Cu(II) terpyridine complex with the Pluronic F&#8208;127/Poloxamer&#8208;407 polymeric carrier into nanoparticles. Besides overcoming the pharmacological drawbacks, the nanoparticles were able to eradicate human breast adenocarcinoma monolayer cells as well as challenging multicellular tumor spheroids at nanomolar concentrations.

         <title>Supramolecular Complexation&#8208;Enhanced CO2 Chemisorption in Amine&#8208;Derived Sorbents</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A supramolecular complexation approach was developed to improve the CO2 chemisorption performance of water&#8208;lean amine sorbents. Detailed characterizations and theoretical simulation revealed that the supramolecular complexation between the CO2&#8208;integrated products and crown ether could stabilize the carbamic acid products, leading to improved CO2 uptake capacity and diminished energy consumption in CO2 releasing.







Abstract
A supramolecular complexation approach is developed to improve the CO2 chemisorption performance of solvent&#8208;lean amine sorbents. Operando spectroscopy techniques reveal the formation of carbamic acid in the presence of a crown ether. The reaction pathway is confirmed by theoretical simulation, in which the crown ether acts as a proton acceptor and shuttle to drive the formation and stabilization of carbamic acid. Improved CO2 capacity and diminished energy consumption in sorbent regeneration are achieved.

         <title>Synthesis of Sulfilimines via Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Mediated Triplet Energy Transfer to Sulfonyl Azides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a novel reactivity of triplet nitrenes toward sulfides to afford sulfilimines. The use of triplet nitrenes as reactive intermediates circumvented the substrate scope limitations of the prior singlet nitrene approaches, as demonstrated by broad functional group tolerance, water compatibility, and amenability to use for the late&#8208;stage functionalization of drugs.







Abstract
Sulfilimines and their derivatives have garnered considerable interest in both synthetic and medicinal chemistry. Photochemical nitrene transfer to sulfides is known as a conventional synthetic approach to sulfilimines. However, the existing methods have a limited substrate scope stemming from the incompatibility of singlet nitrene intermediates with nucleophilic functional groups. Herein, we report the synthesis of N&#8208;sulfonyl sulfilimines via visible&#8208;light&#8208;mediated energy transfer to sulfonyl azides, uncovering the previously overlooked reactivity of triplet nitrenes with sulfides. This reaction features broad functional group tolerance, water compatibility, and amenability to the late&#8208;stage functionalization of drugs. Thus, this work represents an important example of energy transfer chemistry that overcomes challenges in traditional synthetic methods.

         <title>Adaptation of the BaAl4 Type to Small Cations: The Case of NaGa4</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Single&#8208;phase NaGa4 samples were prepared by annealing stoichiometric element mixtures at 200 &#176;C, 300 &#176;C, and 450 &#176;C in closed tantalum ampoules. No compositional homogeneity range was detected. While single crystals annealed at 200 &#176;C feature a fully ordered crystal structure, a crystal annealed at 300 &#176;C reveals a defect with mutual exchange of Na atoms and Ga2 dumbbells. The structure motif caused by the violation of translational symmetry resembles the CeMg2Si2 type of structure. The NaGa4 structure constitutes a branch of the BaAl4 type distinguished by a notably high c/a ratio (space group I4/mmm; a = 4.2261(1) &#197;, c = 11.2633(6) &#197;, c/a = 2.67). This distortion enables the adaption of the BaAl4&#8208;type to small cations, when the further shortening of the apical&#8211;apical distance d(Ga&#8211;Ga) is not possible any more. Therefore, NaGa4 offers an adaption alternative to the monoclinic distortion observed in the CaGa4 and YbGa4. Conductivity measurements validate the metallic behavior anticipated by NMR measurements in earlier studies.</dc:description>

The structure motif caused by the violation of translational symmetry resembles the CeMg2Si2 type of structure. The NaGa4 structure constitutes a branch of the BaAl4 type distinguished by a notably high c/a ratio (space group I4/mmm; a = 4.2261(1) &#197;, c = 11.2633(6) &#197;, c/a = 2.67). This distortion enables the adaption of the BaAl4-type to small cations, when the further shortening of the apical&#8211;apical distance d(Ga&#8211;Ga) is not possible any more. Therefore, NaGa4 offers an adaption alternative to the monoclinic distortion observed in the CaGa4 and YbGa4. Conductivity measurements validate the metallic behavior anticipated by NMR measurements in earlier studies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

The important role of the cellular microenvironment in maintaining cellular homeostasis. Changes in cell polarity, particularly in organelles, have been found to be strongly linked to inflammation, Alzheimer's disease, cancer, and other illnesses. It is essential to check the polarity of the LDs. A series of arylated naphthalimide derivatives were synthesized using the Suzuki reaction. Modification of synthesized aryl naphthalimides using oligomeric PEG based on intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) mechanism. A series of fluorescent probes were designed to target LDs and detect their polarity. Nap&#8208;TPA&#8208;PEG3 probe exhibited high sensitivity to polarity. The addition of oligomeric polyethylene glycol (PEG) to the probe not only significantly improved its solubility in water, but also effectively reduced its cytotoxicity. In addition, the probe exhibited excellent aggregation&#8208;induced luminescence (AIE) properties and solvent discolouration effects. Nap&#8208;TPA&#8208;PEG3 probe exhibited high Pearson correlation coefficient (0.957163) in lipid droplet co&#8208;localization in cells. Nap&#8208;TPA&#8208;PEG3 could be used as an effective hand tool to monitor cell polarity.</dc:description>

         <title>The Potential of Self&#8208;Activating Au(I) Complexes in Gold Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 44, August 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The multifaceted approaches discussed herein highlight the tremendous potential of self&#8208;activating gold catalysis. Significant contributions have been made in the advancement of these catalysts through innovative ligand design and the discovery of novel modes of autoactivation. This knowledge holds promise for innovating organic transformations, including asymmetric catalysis, while mitigating the risk of reaction poisoning from traditional catalyst&#8208;generating additives.







Abstract
Gold catalysis has emerged as a groundbreaking field in synthetic chemistry, revolutionizing numerous organic transformations. Despite the significant achieved advancements, the mechanistic understanding behind many gold&#8208;catalyzed reactions remains elusive. This Concept article covers the so&#8208;called &#8220;self&#8208;activating&#8221; Au(I) complexes, sorting out their pivotal role in gold catalysis. We comment on how Au(I) complexes can undergo self&#8208;activation, triggering diverse catalytic transformations without the need for external additives. The most important examples reported so far that underlie the catalytic activity of these species are discussed. This intrinsic reactivity represents a paradigm shift in gold catalysis, offering new avenues for the design of efficient and sustainable catalytic systems. Furthermore, we explore the factors influencing the stability, reactivity, and selectivity of these Au(I) complexes, providing insights into their synthetic utility and potential applications. This area of research not only advances our fundamental understanding of gold catalysis but also paves the way for the development of novel catalytic strategies with broad implications in organic synthesis and the chemical industry.

         <title>Solvent&#8208;Free Mechanosynthesis of Oligopeptides by Coupling Peptide Segments of Different Lengths &#8211; Elucidating the Role of Cesium Carbonate in Ball Mill Processes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 44, August 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present a concept inspired by playing with blocks, in which it is possible to construct various objects from segments (blocks) of different sizes and lengths. An attempt is made to explain the mechanism of coupling reaction in a ball mill in the presence of cesium carbonate. The usefulness of the method in the synthesis of oligopeptides has been proven.







Abstract
We report an idea for the synthesis of oligopeptides using a solvent&#8208;free ball milling approach. Our concept is inspired by block play, in which it is possible to construct different objects using segments (blocks) of different sizes and lengths. We prove that by having a library of short peptides and employing the ball mill mechanosynthesis (BMMS) method, peptides can be easily coupled to form different oligopeptides with the desired functional and biological properties. Optimizing the BMMS process we found that the best yields we obtained when TBTU and cesium carbonate were used as reagents. The role of Cs2CO3 in the coupling mechanism was followed on each stage of synthesis by 1H, 13C and 133Cs NMR employing Magic Angle Spinning (MAS) techniques. It was found that cesium carbonate acts not only as a base but is also responsible for the activation of substrates and intermediates. The unique information about the BMMS mechanism is based on the analysis of 2D NMR data. The power of BMMS is proved by the example of different peptide combinations, 2+2, 3+2, 4+2, 5+2 and 4+4. The tetra&#8208;, penta&#8208;, hexa&#8208;, hepta&#8208; and octapeptides obtained under this project were fully characterized by MS and NMR techniques.

         <title>Structure&#8208;Activity Relationship of Benzophenazine Derivatives for Homogeneous and Heterogenized Photooxygenation Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 44, August 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new familly of benzophenazine derivatives was designed as photosensitizers for singlet oxygen generation. Extensive structure activity relationship was carried out using both experimental and theoretical approach. The most promising candidate was immobilized on silica nanoparticles and its photoactivity was evaluated in the citronellol photooxidation.







Abstract
Singlet oxygen is a powerful oxidant used in various applications, such as organic synthesis, medicine, and environmental remediation. Organic and inorganic photosensitizers are commonly used to generate this reactive species through energy transfer with the triplet ground state of oxygen. We describe here a series of novel benzophenazine derivatives as a promising class of photosensitizers for singlet oxygen photosensitization. In this study, we investigated the structure&#8208;activity relationship of these benzophenazine derivatives. Akin to a molecular compass, the southern fragment was first functionalized with either aromatic tertiary amines, alkyl tertiary amines, aromatic sulfur groups, alkyl sulfur groups, or cyclic ethers. Enhanced photophysical properties (in terms of triplet excited&#8208;state lifetime, absorption wavelength, triplet state energy, and O2 quenching capabilities) were obtained with cyclic ether and sulfur groups. Conversely, the presence of an amine moiety was detrimental to the photocatalysts. The western and northern fragments were also investigated and slightly undesirable to negligible changes in photophysical properties were observed. The most promising candidate was then immobilized on silica nanoparticles and its photoactivity was evaluated in the citronellol photooxidation reaction. A high NMR yield of 97&#8201;% in desired product was obtained, with only a slight decrease over several recycling runs (85&#8201;% in the fourth run). These results provide insights into the design of efficient photosensitizers for singlet oxygen generation and the development of heterogeneous systems.

         <title>A Novel Approach of Electrocatalytic Deamination From Aromatic Amide to Diarylimide on Ni&#8208;PTFE Modified Electrode</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 44, August 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ni&#8208;PTFE hydrophobically modified electrodes are employed to perform an electrochemically catalyzed reduction reaction for the conversion of monoaromatic amides to diaromatic imides. The reaction may be a deamination C&#8722;N coupling reaction, which may include an ECC (Electrochemical&#8208;Chemical&#8208;Chemical) process. The process is completed at room temperature without adding any catalysts and redox reagents to maintain an acceptable conversion.







Abstract
A hydrophobic Ni&#8208;PTFE modified electrode has been prepared by constant current and cathodic electroplating with a nickel sheet as substrate in a PTFE suspension. Then the Ni&#8208;PTFE modified electrode was used for electroreduction from aromatic amide to diarylimide. The electrochemical characterizations such as cyclic voltammogram, EIS, polarization curves, and electrode stability have been carried out by electrochemical workstation. The structure of the electroreduction product diarylimide was characterized by 1H&#160;NMR, FT&#8208;IR, MS(Mass Spectrum), and EA(Elemental Analyzer). Based on the hydrophobicity of the electrode, an approach suggested that the phenyl ketone radical may be formed by electroreductive deamination at the cathode. With the construction of C&#8722;N bond by the radical coupling, the electrocatalytic reduction may be comprised of a one&#8208;electron process including an ECC (Electrochemical&#8208;Chemical&#8208;Chemical) process. The electroreduction of aromatic amide to diarylimide may be controlled by both charge migration and concentration polarization. Electrocatalytic reduction of aromatic amides on Ni&#8208;PTFE modified electrodes is all well conversion ratio.

     alt="A Novel Approach of Electrocatalytic Deamination From Aromatic Amide to Diarylimide on Ni-PTFE Modified Electrode"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ni-PTFE hydrophobically modified electrodes are employed to perform an electrochemically catalyzed reduction reaction for the conversion of monoaromatic amides to diaromatic imides. The reaction may be a deamination C&#8722;N coupling reaction, which may include an ECC (Electrochemical-Chemical-Chemical) process. The process is completed at room temperature without adding any catalysts and redox reagents to maintain an acceptable conversion.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A hydrophobic Ni-PTFE modified electrode has been prepared by constant current and cathodic electroplating with a nickel sheet as substrate in a PTFE suspension. Then the Ni-PTFE modified electrode was used for electroreduction from aromatic amide to diarylimide. The electrochemical characterizations such as cyclic voltammogram, EIS, polarization curves, and electrode stability have been carried out by electrochemical workstation. The structure of the electroreduction product diarylimide was characterized by &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H&#160;NMR, FT-IR, MS(Mass Spectrum), and EA(Elemental Analyzer). Based on the hydrophobicity of the electrode, an approach suggested that the phenyl ketone radical may be formed by electroreductive deamination at the cathode. With the construction of C&#8722;N bond by the radical coupling, the electrocatalytic reduction may be comprised of a one-electron process including an ECC (Electrochemical-Chemical-Chemical) process. The electroreduction of aromatic amide to diarylimide may be controlled by both charge migration and concentration polarization. Electrocatalytic reduction of aromatic amides on Ni-PTFE modified electrodes is all well conversion ratio.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Hybrid Ethylcellulose Polymeric Films: Ag(I)&#8208;Based Components and Curcumin as Reinforcing Ingredients for Enhanced Food Packaging Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 44, August 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ethylcellulose films embedding the [(bpy)Ag(OTf)]&#8734; polymer and the binary co&#8208;crystal [(bpy)Ag(OTf)]&#8734;&#8208;curc, as active ingredients, have been prepared through solvent casting. The not innocent role of Ethylcellulose along the film forming process was highlighted by the deep investigation performed on the prepared samples. High antibacterial activity with low Silver release was found for the films incorporating the Ag(I) species.







Abstract
Bio&#8208;active ethylcellulose (EC) polymeric films have been obtained by incorporating curcumin (curc) and Ag(I)&#8208;based compounds, known for their antioxidant and antimicrobial activity, respectively, within the polymeric matrix. The recently reported Ag(I) coordination polymer, in both its structural forms (&#945;&#8208;[(bpy)Ag(OTf)]&#8734; and &#946;&#8208;{[(bpy)Ag][OTf]}&#8734;), and the [(bpy)Ag(OTf)]&#8734;&#8208;curc polymeric co&#8208;crystal (bpy=2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine; OTf=trifluoromethanesulfonate) have been selected as Ag(I) species. The hybrid composite films have been prepared through the simple solvent casting method and characterized through Powder X&#8208;Ray Diffraction (PXRD), Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) and Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM), UV&#8208;vis spectroscopy. The deep investigation of the film samples highlighted the non&#8208;inert behaviour of EC towards these specific active ingredients. Antimicrobial tests showed that EC films embedding the Ag(I)&#8208;based compounds present good antimicrobial performance, in particular against Staphylococcus aureus, used as a model of Gram&#8208;positive bacteria. In addition, Silver migration tests, performed on the Ag(I)&#8208;incorporating EC films, evidenced low values of silver release particularly in the case of the EC films incorporating [(bpy)Ag(OTf)]&#8734;&#8208;curc.

         <title>Dual Role of a Novel Heteroleptic Cu(I) Complex in Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Driven CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 44, August 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel Cu(I) complex based on a benzoquinoxalinone derivative was used in visible&#8208;light driven CO2 reduction. The ability to accumulate charges on the non&#8208;innocent ligand not only enables its role as an excellent photosensitizer, in combination with a an Fe(III) porphyrin, but brings this complex to the next level, as it acts as photocatalyst, achieving selectively the reduction of CO2 to CO.







Abstract
A novel mononuclear Cu(I) complex was synthesized via coordination with a benzoquinoxalin&#8208;2&#8217;&#8208;one&#8208;1,2,3&#8208;triazole chelating diimine and the bis[(2&#8208;diphenylphosphino)phenyl] ether (DPEPhos), to target a new and efficient photosensitizer for photocatalytic CO2 reduction. The Cu(I) complex absorbs in the blue&#8208;green region of the visible spectrum, with a broad band having a maximum at 475&#8197;nm (&#1013; =4500&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;1), which is assigned to the metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge transfer (MLCT) transition from the Cu(I) to the benzoquinoxalin&#8208;2&#8217;&#8208;one moiety of the diimine. Surprisingly, photo&#8208;driven experiments for the CO2 reduction showed that this complex can undergo a photoinduced electron transfer with a sacrificial electron donor and accumulate electrons on the diimine backbone. Photo&#8208;driven experiments in a CO2 atmosphere revealed that this complex can not only act as a photosensitizer, when combined with an Fe(III)&#8208;porphyrin, but can also selectively produce CO from CO2. Thus, owing to its charge&#8208;accumulation properties, the non&#8208;innocent benzoquinoxalin&#8208;2&#8208;one based ligand enabled the development of the first copper(I)&#8208;based photocatalyst for CO2 reduction.

Abstract
A copper&#8208;catalyzed [3+2] annulation reaction of exocyclic enamines/enol ethers with 1,4&#8208;benzoquinone esters has been developed, providing facile access to N,O&#8208;spiroketals and spiroketals under mild conditions with broad substrate scope (26 examples, 71&#8211;94&#8201;% yields). Gram scale synthesis and chemical transformations demonstrated that this method is potentially useful in the synthesis of natural products and drugs containing a N,O&#8208; spiroketal moiety. The chiral N,O&#8208;spiroketal could be obtained with 98&#8201;% ee after recrystallization, when a chiral SaBOX ligand was employed.

         <title>Multiple Pathways in the Triplet States Population for a Naphthalenediimide&#8208;C60 Dyad</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 44, August 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Upon photoexcitation of the antenna (NDI) in the NDI&#8208;C60 dyad, either intramolecular singlet state energy transfer (FRET) or charge separation (CS)/charge recombination (CR) occurs, depending on the solvent polarity. The ultrafast photophysics of the dyad was studied by using nanosecond/femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy, and the electron spin dynamics was studied by using TREPR spectroscopy







Abstract
The link of an antenna dye with an electron spin converter, in this case naphthalenediimide and C60, produces a system with a rich photophysics including the detection of more than one triplet state on the long timescale (tens of &#956;s). Beside the use of optical spectroscopies in the ns and in the fs time scale, we used time&#8208;resolved Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (TREPR) to study the system evolution following photoexcitation. TREPR keeps track of the formation path of the triplet states through specific spin polarization patterns observed in the spectra. The flexibility of the linker and solvent polarity play a role in favouring either electron transfer or energy transfer processes.

         <title>Enantioselective Synthesis of Dihydrobenzofurans, Dihydrobenzosulfones, and Dihydroindoles by Merging One&#8208;pot Intramolecular Heck&#8208;Matsuda Reactions from Anilines with Redox&#8208;Relay Process</title>

A one&#8208;pot tandem protocol is reported for the enantioselective Pd&#8208;catalyzed synthesis of dihydrobenzofuran, dihydroindole, and dihydrobenzosulfone scaffolds by a Heck&#8208;Matsuda reaction under open&#8208;flask conditions with in situ generation of aryldiazonium salt directly from anilines. The enantioenriched heterocycles are synthesized in overall yields up to 78&#8201;% in enantiomeric ratios up to 99&#8201;:&#8201;1 by a sequential 5&#8208;step protocol.







Abstract
A one&#8208;pot tandem process was developed aiming at the concise and expeditious enantioselective synthesis of dihydrobenzofuran, dihydrobenzosulfone, and dihydroindole scaffolds under mild, and open&#8208;flask conditions. This process combines the in&#8197;situ generation of aryldiazonium salt directly from the anilines in methanol telescoped to an intramolecular Heck&#8208;Matsuda reaction linked to a redox relay process to provide the final products as the dimethyl acetals. These Heck products were smoothly converted into the corresponding primary alcohols or esters. The robustness and the efficiency of the protocol are demonstrated by the synthesis of 24 enantioenriched dihydrobenzofurans, dihydrobenzosulfones, and dihydroindoles in overall yields up to 78&#8201;% in enantiomeric ratios up to 99&#8201;:&#8201;1 by a sequential 5&#8208;step protocol.

         <title>Fabrication of Fe/KB Composite as Sulfur Host for Li&#8208;S Battery</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 44, August 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fe/KB composites with the structure of Fe nano particles embedded in KB is used as a sulfur host for Li&#8722;S battery. KB matrix has good absorption ability and high conductivity while Fe nano particles show excellent catalytic effect on lithium polysulfides. Therefore the Li&#8722;S battery using Fe/KB/S cathode shows high discharge capacity and stable cycle stability.







Abstract
Lithium sulfur battery is a novel kind of secondary battery which has high energy density, however its application is greatly affected by the shuttle effect of polysulfides generated in the redox reaction of cathode electrode. Metal active sites are supposed as effective catalysts which can absorb and accelerate the conversion efficiency of lithium polysulfides, thus the shuttle effect will be alleviated. In this work, we conducted a simple way to prepare a metal Fe doped ketjen black to serve as the sulfur host of lithium sulfur battery. Ketjen black has a large specific surface area and rich porous structure, while Fe nanodot is an excellent catalyst for lithium polysulfides. Because of these advantages, the Fe/KB host can effectively confine a large amount of active material and accelerate its, therefore the Fe/KB&#8722;S cathode electrode show an excellent electrochemical performance.

         <title>Can Aromaticity Be Evaluated Using Atomic Partitions Based on the Hilbert&#8208;Space?</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 44, August 6, 2024. </description>

This article introduces Hilbert&#8208;space partitions &#8211; meta&#8208;L&#246;wdin, NAO, and IAO &#8211; as reliable and economical alternatives to real&#8208;space partitions commonly used to measure aromaticity. These new partitions enable the study of larger molecular rings, previously limited by numerical integration errors in real&#8208;space partitions.







Abstract
Aromaticity is a fundamental concept in chemistry that explains the stability and reactivity of many compounds by identifying atoms within a molecule that form an aromatic ring. Reliable aromaticity indices focus on electron delocalization and depend on atomic partitions, which give rise to the concept of an atom&#8208;in&#8208;the&#8208;molecule (AIM). Real&#8208;space atomic partitions present two important drawbacks: a high computational cost and numerical errors, limiting some aromaticity measures to medium&#8208;sized molecules with rings up to 12 atoms. This restriction hinders the study of large conjugated systems like porphyrins and nanorings. On the other hand, traditional Hilbert&#8208;space schemes are free of the latter limitations but can be unreliable for the large basis sets required in modern computational chemistry. This paper explores AIMs based on three robust Hilbert&#8208;space partitions &#8211; meta&#8208;L&#246;wdin, Natural Atomic Orbitals (NAO), and Intrinsic Atomic Orbitals (IAO) &#8211; which combine the advantages of real&#8208;space partitions without their disadvantages. These partitions can effectively replace real&#8208;space AIMs for evaluating the aromatic character. For the first time, we report multicenter index (MCI) and Iring values for large rings and introduce ESIpy, an open&#8208;source Python code for aromaticity analysis in large conjugated rings.

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Tunable Oxygenative Rearrangement of Tetrahydrocarbazoles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 44, August 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A copper&#8208;catalyzed tunable oxygenative rearrangement reaction of tetrahydrocarbazoles by using H2O and O2 as oxygen source has been developed. Accordingly, highly important yet synthetically difficult cyclopentyl&#8208;bearing spiroindolin&#8208;2&#8208;one and spiroindolin&#8208;3&#8208;one products were obtained with excellent chemoselectivity and regioselectivity. Inspired from the unique pathway of 1, 2&#8208;migration rearrangement, a highly controllable hydroxylation of indoles for the construction of C3a&#8208;hydroxyl iminium indolines was also developed.







Abstract
Herein, we report a general copper&#8208;catalyzed method for the tunable oxygenative rearrangement of tetrahydrocarbazoles to cyclopentyl&#8208;bearing spiroindolin&#8208;2&#8208;ones and spiroindolin&#8208;3&#8208;ones. The method demonstrates excellent chemoselectivity, regioselectivity, and product control simply by using the H2O and O2 as oxygen source, respectively. This open&#8208;flask method is safe and simple to operate, and no other chemical oxidants are required. Besides, inspired from the unique pathway of 1, 2&#8208;migration rearrangement, a highly controllable hydroxylation of indoles for the construction of C3a&#8208;hydroxyl iminium indolines was also developed. Mechanistic experiments suggest that a single&#8208;electron transfer&#8208;induced oxidation process is responsible for the tunable selectivity control.

         <title>Aggregation of N&#8208;Heteropolycyclic Aromatic Molecules: The Acridine Dimer and Trimer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 44, August 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The stepwise aggregation of acridine isolated in solid neon is monitored using IR and UV spectroscopy. A theoretical study provides meaningful structures and insight into the special photophysics of the aggregates.







Abstract
Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and their nitrogen&#8208;substituted analogues are of great interest for various applications in organic electronics. The performance of such devices is determined not only by the properties of the single molecules, but also by the structure of their aggregates, which often form via self&#8208;aggregation. Gaining insight into such aggregation processes is a challenging task, but crucial for a fine&#8208;tuning of the materials properties. In this work, an efficient approach for the generation and characterisation of aggregates is described, based on matrix&#8208;isolation experiments and quantum&#8208;chemical calculations. This approach is exemplified for aggregation of acridine. The acridine dimer and trimer are thoroughly analysed on the basis of experimental and calculated UV and IR absorption spectra, which agree well with each other. Thereby a novel structure of the acridine dimer is found, which disagrees with a previously reported one. The calculations also show the changes from excitonic coupling towards orbital interactions between two molecules with decreasing distance to each other. In addition, a structure of the trimer is determined. Finally, an outlook is given on how even higher aggregates can be made accessible through experiment.

&lt;p&gt;Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and their nitrogen-substituted analogues are of great interest for various applications in organic electronics. The performance of such devices is determined not only by the properties of the single molecules, but also by the structure of their aggregates, which often form via self-aggregation. Gaining insight into such aggregation processes is a challenging task, but crucial for a fine-tuning of the materials properties. In this work, an efficient approach for the generation and characterisation of aggregates is described, based on matrix-isolation experiments and quantum-chemical calculations. This approach is exemplified for aggregation of acridine. The acridine dimer and trimer are thoroughly analysed on the basis of experimental and calculated UV and IR absorption spectra, which agree well with each other. Thereby a novel structure of the acridine dimer is found, which disagrees with a previously reported one. The calculations also show the changes from excitonic coupling towards orbital interactions between two molecules with decreasing distance to each other. In addition, a structure of the trimer is determined. Finally, an outlook is given on how even higher aggregates can be made accessible through experiment.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Photocatalyst&#8208;Free Visible Light&#8208;Induced C(sp2)&#8722;H Arylation of Quinoxalin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;ones and Coumarins</title>

We have disclosed a method for obtaining 3&#8208;aryl heterocycles with good yield and excellent regioselectivity without the need for additional photosensitizers or strong oxidants, and have successfully synthesized bioactive compounds using this method. Computational investigations at the CASPT2//CASSC F/PCM level of theory revealed that a single electron transfer has occurred between the excited state of quinoxalin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;one and iodonium ylide.







Abstract
Herein, we describe a visible light&#8208;induced C(sp2)&#8722;H arylation method for quinoxalin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;ones and coumarins using iodonium ylides without the need for external photocatalysts. The protocol demonstrates a broad substrate scope, enabling the arylation of diverse heterocycles through a simple and mild procedure. Furthermore, the photochemical reaction showcases its applicability in the efficient synthesis of biologically active molecules. Computational investigations at the CASPT2//CASSCF/PCM level of theory revealed that the excited state of quinoxalin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;one facilitates electron transfer from its &#960; bond to the antibonding orbital of the C&#8722;I bond in the iodonium ylide, ultimately leading to the formation of an aryl radical, which subsequently participates in the C&#8722;H arylation process. In addition, our calculations reveal that during the single&#8208;electron transfer (SET) process, the C&#8722;I bond cleavage in iodonium ylide and new C&#8722;C bond formation between resultant aryl radical and cationic quinoxaline species take place in a concerned manner. This enables the arylation reaction to efficiently proceed along an energy&#8208;efficient route.

         <title>A Photoredox Thiol&#8208;yne Reaction for the Synthesis of Vinyl Sulfide&#8208;Based Coumarins and its Effect on Fluorescence Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 44, August 6, 2024. </description>

A water&#8208;compatible, photoredox&#8208;based synthesis of fluorescent coumarins, bearing a vinyl sulfide as an electron&#8208;donating group, was developed; subsequently, the photophysical properties of these derivatives were examined.







Abstract
Coumarins still remain one of the most widely explored fluorescent dyes, with a broad spectrum of applications spanning various fields, such as molecular imaging, bioorganic chemistry, materials chemistry, or medical sciences. Their fluorescence is strongly based on a push&#8208;pull mechanism involving an electron&#8208;donating group (EDG), mainly located at the C7 or C8 positions of the dye core. Unfortunately, up to now, these positions have been very limited to hydroxyl or amino groups. In this study, we present in detail the synthesis of the first series of coumarins bearing a vinyl sulfide as the EDG at the C7 position. These derivatives were prepared by thiol&#8208;yne reaction, promoted by ruthenium&#8208; or porphyrin&#8208;based photoredox catalysis, enabling rapid late&#8208;stage diversification. We also functionalized coumarins with short peptides, and BSA protein as a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept study, in a single&#8208;step process. This strategy, capable of proceeding under aqueous conditions, overcomes the protection/deprotection steps usually required by traditional methods, which also use strong bases and organic solvents. Moreover, the photophysical properties such as absorption and emission of obtained coumarins (for 3&#8208;CF3, 3&#8208;benzothiazole, 6&#8211;8&#8208;difluoro derivatives), predominantly exhibited large Stokes shifts (up to 204&#8197;nm) and maintained intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) characteristics.

         <title>Post&#8208;Synthetic Modification of Calix[4]arene Framework by Iridium&#8211;Mediated Alkyne Insertion into an Inert C&#8722;C Bond: A Novel Strategy for Unsymmetrical Macrocycles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 44, August 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel synthetic method for unsymmetrical macrocycles was developed by iridium&#8208;mediated alkyne insertion into an inert C(methylene)&#8722;C(aryl) bond of calix[4]arene framework. This post&#8208;synthetic modification can be applied to various terminal alkynes to enable a facile access to unsymmetrical, monofunctionalized macrocycles with unique structures.







Abstract
As a novel synthetic method for unsymmetrical macrocycles, we herein developed a post&#8208;synthetic modification of calix[4]arenes by insertion of a terminal alkyne into an inert C(methylene)&#8722;C(aryl) bond of the macrocyclic framework. In this transformation, C&#8208;iridated calix[4]arenes, readily synthesized through C&#8722;H bond activation of the parent calix[4]arene, undergoes C(methylene)&#8722;C(aryl) bond cleavage followed by insertion of an alkyne to provide a ring&#8208;expanded calix[4]arene complex. Removal of the iridium metal from the resulting complex was readily accomplished by a simple treatment with an acid. The developed sequential method affords novel unsymmetrical, monofunctionalized macrocyclic compounds via 3 steps from the parent calix[4]arene in good yield. The unique unsymmetrical structures of the alkyne&#8211;inserted macrocycles were evaluated by X&#8208;ray single crystal analyses. On the basis of theoretical calculations, we propose a reaction mechanism involving an uncommon C&#8722;C bond cleavage step through &#948;&#8208;carbon elimination for the ring enlargement process.

         <title>Thiocarbonyl Pseudohalides &#8211; The Curious Case of Thiocarbonyl Dithiocyanate</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 44, August 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The constitutional and rotational isomerism and of two thiocarbonyl pseudohalide compounds are investigated with crystallography, NMR, IR and Raman spectroscopy, as well as DFT calculations. It is shown that solely the kinetic reaction products are isolated. Upon reacting thiocarbonyl dithiocyanate with ethanol, ethoxy substituted dithiobiuret is yielded with acts as a ligand towards Ni2+.







Abstract
Thiocarbonyl dithiocyanate (1) and chlorothiocarbonyl thiocyanate (2) were synthesized from thiophosgene and ammonium or silver thiocyanate, respectivley. Their crystal structures show syn&#8208;anti (1) and syn (2) conformations, which were confirmed in the bulk phases by powder X&#8208;ray diffraction, vibrational spectroscopy and DFT calculations. Further calculations explain the isolation of the kinetic reaction products by a lower transition states opposed to the thermodynamic reaction products. Reaction of 1 with ethanol gave a dithiobiuret derivative (3). In a proof&#8208;of&#8208;principle study we show that it in turn can be used for the complexation of nickel to yield (4).

         <title>Synthesis of (Hetero)biaryls via Nickel Catalyzed Reductive Cross&#8208;Electrophile Coupling Between (Hetero)aryl Iodides and Bromides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 44, August 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The (hetero)biaryls are fundamental to drug discovery and rapid, general access to these motifs is essential for medicinal chemistry. Herein, a nickel catalyzed reductive cross&#8208;electrophile coupling between heteroaryl iodides and bromides is described. We demonstrated that the reaction is chemoselective, scalable, and amenable to library fashion with an array of scaffolds (45 examples).







Abstract
(Hetero)biaryls are fundamental building blocks in the pharmaceutical industry and rapid access to these scaffolds is imperative for the success of numerous medicinal chemistry campaigns. Herein, a highly general, mild, and chemoselective reductive cross&#8208;electrophile coupling between (hetero)aryl iodides and heteroaryl bromides is reported. By employing more reactive (hetero)aryl halides, a broad range of successful substrates (45 examples) were identified. The reaction was also found to be chemoselective for C(sp2)&#8208;C(sp2) bond formation between (hetero)aryl iodides and bromides over (hetero)aryl chlorides, which were generally inert under the described reaction conditions. The efficiency of the procedure is also further demonstrated in parallel synthesis library format, on gram scale, as well as in the formal synthesis of Ruxolitinib, a potent JAK inhibitor. As such, we anticipate this method will find widespread utility in the assembly of (hetero)biaryls for medicinal chemistry efforts.

         <title>Exploiting Hydrophobic Amino Acid Scanning to Develop Cyclic Peptide Inhibitors of the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Main Protease with Antiviral Activity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 44, August 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The urgent need for novel antivirals extends beyond managing current COVID&#8208;19 infections to preparing for future zoonotic outbreaks. The SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 main protease (Mpro) is essential for viral replication and a validated antiviral target. Through optimization of a peptide inhibitor identified via mRNA display, a cyclic peptide with enhanced cell permeability and antiviral activity was developed.







Abstract
The development of novel antivirals is crucial not only for managing current COVID&#8208;19 infections but for addressing potential future zoonotic outbreaks. SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 main protease (Mpro) is vital for viral replication and viability and therefore serves as an attractive target for antiviral intervention. Herein, we report the optimization of a cyclic peptide inhibitor that emerged from an mRNA display selection against the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Mpro to enhance its cell permeability and in&#8197;vitro antiviral activity. By identifying mutation&#8208;tolerant amino acid residues within the peptide sequence, we describe the development of a second&#8208;generation Mpro inhibitor bearing five cyclohexylalanine residues. This cyclic peptide analogue exhibited significantly improved cell permeability and antiviral activity compared to the parent peptide. This approach highlights the importance of optimizing cyclic peptide hits for activity against intracellular targets such as the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Mpro.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 44, August 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This protocol represents an environmentally benign C&#8722;H arylation approach in the heterogeneous phase. Magnetically isolable iron oxide nanoparticles are introduced as a potent photocatalyst for the directed and non&#8208;directed C&#8722;C bond&#8208;forming methods with a broad range of substrates. Thorough catalytic characterization and detailed mechanistic investigations are performed to justify the presented scientific advancements.







Abstract
A magnetically isolable iron oxide nanoparticles is introduced as an efficient heterogeneous photocatalyst for non&#8208;directed C&#8722;H arylation employing aryl diazonium salts as the aryl precursors. This first&#8208;row transition metal&#8208;based photocatalyst revealed versatile activities and is applicable to a wide range of substrates, demonstrating brilliant efficacy and superior recyclability. Detailed catalytic characterization describes the physical properties and redox behavior of the Fe&#8208;catalyst. Adequate control experiments helped to establish the radical&#8208;based mechanism for the C&#8722;H arylation.

         <title>Nitrophenol Reduction with Silver Oxide Nanostructures as a Sustainable Approach to Environmental Remediation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 44, August 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In catalytic reduction of 4&#8208;nitrophenol to 4&#8208;aminophenol, almost complete conversion is achieved within 12&#8197;minutes using green synthesized Ag2O nanostructures as the catalyst. The kinetics follows pseudo&#8208;first order kinetics. The findings (kapp=4.24&#215;10&#8208;3 s&#8208;1) highlight the catalyst as a cost&#8208;effective and sustainable alternative to noble metals for treating recalcitrant nitroarenes.







Abstract
We propose silver oxide as a cost&#8208;effective and sustainable alternative to noble metals for the catalytic reduction of nitroaromatics. In the present investigation, we adopt a facile and green synthetic route for the synthesis of silver oxide nanostructures. The prepared nanostructures were found to crystallize in the cuprite phase and exhibit absorbance across the entire visible range of the electromagnetic spectrum. The catalytic potential of the silver oxide was evaluated by following the kinetics of nitrophenol reduction under ambient conditions and is observed to follow pseudo&#8208;first order kinetics with the apparent rate constant 

kapp=4.24&#215;10-3

 ${{k}_{app}=4.24\ \times {10}^{-3}}$



 s&#8722;1 at minimum concentration of the catalyst. We attribute the observed catalytic activity to the freshly generated catalytic surface featuring a partially reduced form of silver oxide during reaction. The findings highlight the efficacy of silver oxide in mitigating the environmental pollution originating from the recalcitrant nitroarenes.

         <title>Transition Behaviors of Isostructural Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Frameworks Composed of Naphthalene, Quinoxaline, and Pyrazinopyrazine Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 44, August 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Isostructural hydrogen&#8208;bonded frameworks based on naphthalene, quinoxaline, and pyrazinopyrazine cores, have been constructed. Upon removal of guest molecules, these three solvated HOFs underwent transformations through rearrangement of hydrogen bonds. Each transformed structure possesses different intermolecular interactions contributed from atom in the molecular core.







Abstract
A series of isostructural reticular frameworks with systematic differences on chemical structures allows us to disclose correlations between specific structural factors and properties, providing insights for designing novel porous materials. However, even slight differences in the molecular structure often lead to non&#8208;isostructural polymorphic frameworks particularly in the case of hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) because the structures of HOFs are based on a subtle balance of reversible interactions. In this study, we found that three simple analogues of tetracarboxylic acids with naphthalene, quinoxaline, and pyrazinopyrazine cores (NT, QX, and PP, respectively) yielded isostructural solvated HOFs (NT&#8208;1, QX&#8208;1, and PP&#8208;1, respectively), where hydrogen&#8208;bonded sql&#8208;networked sheets were slip&#8208;stacked with closely similar manners. More importantly, these isostructural HOFs underwent structural transformations in different manners upon removal of the guest solvents. Comparison of the crystal structures of the HOFs before and after the transformation revealed that intermolecular interactions of the core significantly affected on rearrangements of hydrogen bonds in the transformation. The results suggest the potential to control the properties and functions of isostructural HOFs by elements in the core.

         <title>Under the Influence of Water: Molecular Recognition of Organic Hydrophilic Molecules in Water with a Prismarene Host Driven by Hydration Effects</title>

A water&#8208;soluble deep cavity prism[5]arene host has the ability to form endo&#8208;cavity complexes with neutral organic and hydrophilic substances in aqueous medium. The stability of these complexes in aqueous environments is largely influenced by water&#8208;mediated hydrogen bonding interactions between the host and guest molecules, as well as the expulsion of frustrated water molecules from the deep cavity of the prism[5]arene.







Abstract
A water&#8208;soluble prism[5]arene host can form endo&#8208;cavity complexes with hydrophilic organic substances in water by displacing frustrated water molecules from its deep cavity. Water molecules structured at both rims of the prismarene host can mediate hydrogen bonding interactions with the guest. Water&#8208;mediated hydrogen bonding interactions were invoked here to elucidate the elevated binding affinities and selectivity of the prismarene host toward hydrophilic organic guests. We show that water at the interface of a host&#8208;guest complex can act as an extension of the host structure, facilitating the accommodation of neutral guests within the binding site. This study highlights the crucial role of water in facilitating supramolecular interactions between a deep&#8208;cavity prismarene host and organic hydrophilic guests in aqueous medium.

         <title>Chiral Diselenophosphoric Acids for Ion Pair Catalysis: A Novel Approach to Enhance Both Proton Donating and Proton Accepting Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 44, August 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present the first BINOL&#8208;based diselenophosphoric acids (DSA) obtained with up to 98&#8201;% NMR yield. DSA provide both very high proton donor and proton acceptor properties. Together with their C2&#8208;symmetry, the single donor and single acceptor situation, the decreased tendency of self&#8208;association, and the straightforward synthesis with potential 3,3&#8217;&#8208;substitution, the DSA provide all features ideal for the further development of ion pair catalysis.







Abstract
The activation of poorly reactive substrates via strong chiral acids is a central topic in asymmetric ion pair catalysis these days. Despite highly successful scaffolds such as N&#8208;triflylphosphoramides, these catalysts either lack C2&#8208;symmetry or provide multiple H&#8208;bond acceptor sites, leading to lower ee values for certain reactions. We present BINOL&#8208;based diselenophosphoric acids (DSA) as an extremely promising alternative. Using an intertwined approach of synthesis and NMR studies, we developed a synthetic approach to DSA with up to 98&#8201;% NMR yield. The obtained acids provide both very high proton donor and proton acceptor properties, a bifunctionality, which is key to catalytic applications. Indeed, first reactivity test proved the much higher acidity of DSA and its ability to initiate Mukaiyama&#8211;Mannich reaction and protodesilylation of silyl ethers. Together with their C2&#8208;symmetry, the single donor and single acceptor situation, the decreased tendency of self&#8208;association, and the straightforward synthesis with potential 3,3&#8217;&#8208;substitution, the DSA provide all features ideal for the further development of ion pair catalysis.

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembled Bis&#8208;Acridinium Tweezer Equilibria Controlled by Multi&#8208;Responsive Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 44, August 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The monomer&#8208;dimer equilibria of multi&#8208;responsive entwined dimers is controlled by both chemical and physical stimuli. Chemical switching allows phase transfer experiments whereas electrochemical switching allows a fine understanding of stabilizing and repulsive forces in these systems. A double mutant analysis exploiting electrochemical data gives a good estimate of the energetic contribution brought by methoxy groups.







Abstract
Protonated and methylated bis&#8208;acridinium tweezers built around a 2,6&#8208;diphenylpyridyl and an electron enriched 2,6&#8208;di(p&#8208;anisyl)pyridyl spacer have been synthesized. These tweezers can self&#8208;assemble in their corresponding homodimers and the associated thermodynamic parameters have been probed in organic solvents. The switching properties of the tweezers have been exploited in biphasic transfer experiments showing the shift of the equilibria towards the homodimers. Moreover, the thermodynamic parameters of the formation of the reduced methylated homodimers investigated by electrochemical experiments revealed the dissociation of the dimers. Thus, in addition to solvent and temperature, the pH and redox responsiveness of the acridinium units of the tweezers make it possible to modulate to a larger extent the monomer&#8208;dimer equilibria.

         <title>Photochemical Aerobic Upcycling of Polystyrene Plastics via Synergistic Indirect HAT Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 44, August 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Upcycling of plastic waste constitutes an excellent solution to the rising problem of plastic waste treatment. Synergistic HAT catalysis from thioxanthone and bromoacetonitrile is introduced for the photochemical aerobic upcycling of polystyrene plastics into benzoic acid.







Abstract
Plastic pollution constitutes an evergrowing urgent environmental problem, since overaccumulation of plastic waste, arising from the immense increase of the production of disposable plastic products, overcame planet's capacity to properly handle them. Chemical upcycling of polystyrene constitutes a convenient method for the conversion of plastic waste into high&#8208;added value chemicals, suggesting an attractive perspective in dealing with the environmental crisis. We demonstrate herein a novel, easy&#8208;to&#8208;perform organocatalytic photoinduced aerobic protocol, which proceeds via synergistic indirect hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) catalysis under LED 390&#8197;nm Kessil lamps as the irradiation source. The developed method employs a BrCH2CN&#8208;thioxanthone photocatalytic system and was successfully applied to a variety of everyday&#8208;life plastic products, leading to the isolation of benzoic acid after simple base&#8208;acid work up in yields varying from 23&#8211;49&#8201;%, while a large&#8208;scale experiment was successfully performed, suggesting that the photocatalytic step is susceptible to industrial application.

         <title>Front Cover: Solvent&#8208;Free Mechanosynthesis of Oligopeptides by Coupling Peptide Segments of Different Lengths &#8211; Elucidating the Role of Cesium Carbonate in Ball Mill Processes (Chem. Eur. J. 44/2024)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 44, August 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The idea of synthesizing oligopeptides by using solvent&#8208;free ball milling is based on the assumption that it is possible to construct different objects using segments (blocks) of different sizes and lengths. It has been shown that by having a &#8220;library&#8221; of short peptides and using the ball mill mechanosynthesis (BMMS) method, peptides can be easily combined to form different products with the desired functional and biological properties. The role of Cs2CO3 in the coupling mechanism was followed at each stage of synthesis using magic angle spinning (MAS) NMR techniques. More information can be found in the Research Article by M.&#8197;J. Potrzebowski and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202400177).

Controlling the equilibria of supramolecular systems is a subtle balance of the conditions used. The first is the related to the interaction between the molecules and the solvent (the solvation shell is represented by the crystalline spheres). Then, equilibria can also be controlled by external stimuli, both physical (temperature and electrons) and chemical (protons), thus perturbating the system in solution (additional spheres with a whitish halo). More information can be found in the Research Article by V. Heitz, H.&#8208;P. Jacquot de Rouville and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202401866).

Can a magician juggle and tame a wild beast simultaneously? In the &#8220;photocatalytic CO2 reduction circus&#8221;, our innovative CuI complex dazzles as it deftly switches roles: acting as a photosensitizer, passing electrons to an iron porphyrin that reduces CO2, and as a photocatalyst, directly converting CO2 to carbon monoxide.

Isostructural hydrogen&#8208;bonded frameworks based on naphthalene, quinoxaline, and pyrazinopyrazine cores have been constructed. Upon the removal of guest molecules, these three solvated HOFs underwent transformation through the rearrangement of hydrogen bonds. Each transformed structure possesses different intermolecular interactions contributed by the atom in the molecular core. More information can be found in the Research Article by I.

         <title>Applications of Metals and Metal Compounds in Improving the Sensitivity of Microfluidic Biosensors &#8211; A Review</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 44, August 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Our review explores the evolution of microfluidic sensors, emphasizing the shift from enzyme&#8208;based to enzyme&#8208;free cascade amplification methods. We address challenges in enzyme&#8208;based reactions and propose metallic nanomaterials as promising alternatives. Highlighting their unique properties like SPR and SERS, we discuss their role in enhancing detection sensitivity. Additionally, we underscore the potential of metal&#8208;based catalytic nanomaterials. This review offers valuable insights and future research directions, contributing to the advancement of microfluidic biosensors.







Abstract
The enhancement of detection sensitivity in microfluidic sensors has been a continuously explored field. Initially, many strategies for sensitivity improvement involved introducing enzyme cascade reactions, but enzyme&#8208;based reactions posed challenges in terms of cost, stability, and storage. Therefore, there is an urgent need to explore enzyme&#8208;free cascade amplification methods, which are crucial for expanding the application range and improving detection stability. Metal or metal compound nanomaterials have gained great attention in the exploitation of microfluidic sensors due to their ease of preparation, storage, and lower cost. The unique physical properties of metallic nanomaterials, including surface plasmon resonance, surface&#8208;enhanced Raman scattering, metal&#8208;enhanced fluorescence, and surface&#8208;enhanced infrared absorption, contribute significantly to enhancing detection capabilities. The metal&#8208;based catalytic nanomaterials, exemplified by Fe3O4 nanoparticles and metal&#8208;organic frameworks, are considered viable alternatives to biological enzymes due to their excellent performance. Herein, we provide a detailed overview of the applications of metals and metal compounds in improving the sensitivity of microfluidic biosensors. This review not only highlights the current developments but also critically analyzes the challenges encountered in this field. Furthermore, it outlines potential directions for future research, contributing to the ongoing development of microfluidic biosensors with improved detection sensitivity.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks (MOFs) As Hydrogen Storage Materials At Near&#8208;Ambient Temperature</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 44, August 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydrogen as is difficult to store in significant quantities via physical methods especially at near&#8208;ambient temperatures (248&#8211;373&#8197;K). Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) have the potential to increase hydrogen storage of conventional methods. This review surveys the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art in advancing hydrogen storage at near&#8208;ambient temperatures, using mechanisms such open metal sites and hydrogen spillover.







Abstract
Hydrogen may play a critical role in our efforts to de&#8208;carbonize by 2050. However, there remain technical challenges in the storage and transport of hydrogen. Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) have shown significant promise for hydrogen storage at cryogenic temperatures. A material that can meet the US department of energy (DOE) ultimate goal of 6.5 wt. % for gravimetric performance and 50&#8197;g/L for volumetric storage at near&#8208;ambient temperatures would unlock hydrogen as a future fuel source for on&#8208;board applications. Metal&#8208;organic frameworks typically have low heat of adsorptions (i.&#8201;e. 4&#8211;7&#8197;kJ/mol), whereas for storing significant quantities of hydrogen at near&#8208;ambient temperatures, 15&#8211;25&#8197;kJ/mol is likely required. In this review we explore the current methods used (i.&#8201;e., open&#8208;metal sites, alkali dopants and hydrogen spillover) for promoting strong adsorption within MOFs. Further we discuss MOF&#8208;based materials with respect to the technical aspects of deliverable capacity, kinetics and stability.

         <title>Phthalocyanines Synthesis: A State&#8208;of&#8208;The&#8208;Art Review of Sustainable Approaches Through Green Chemistry Metrics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 44, August 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review aims to provide an overview of the synthetic methodologies with reduced environmental impact developed over the last 25&#8197;years for phthalocyanine synthesis, relating them to the Environmental factor (E&#8208;factor), a key metric in green chemistry that allows for a rapid, effective, and versatile evaluation of the quantity of waste produced relative to the product obtained.







Abstract
Driven by escalating environmental concerns, synthetic chemistry faces an urgent need for a green revolution. Green chemistry, with its focus on low environmental impacting chemicals and minimized waste production, emerges as a powerful tool in addressing this challenge. Metrics such as the E&#8208;factor guide the design of environmentally friendly strategies for chemical processes by quantifying the waste generated in obtaining target products, thus enabling interventions to minimize it. Phthalocyanines (Pcs), versatile molecules with exceptional physical and chemical properties, hold immense potential for technological applications. This review aims to bridge the gap between green chemistry and phthalocyanine synthesis by collecting the main examples of environmentally sustainable syntheses documented in the literature. The calculation of the E&#8208;factor of a selection of them provides insights on how crucial it is to evaluate a synthetic process in its entirety. This approach allows for a better evaluation of the actual sustainability of the phthalocyanine synthetic process and indicates possible strategies to improve it.

         <title>Photocatalytic Synthesis and Functionalization of Sulfones, Sulfonamides and Sulfoximines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 44, August 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photocatalysis has encouraged chemists to discover new synthetic transformations in a more effective, mild, and safe manner. This Perspective critically analyses the most relevant photocatalytic strategies on the chemistry of sulfur (VI) compounds, with particular emphasis on sulfones, sulfonamides, and sulfoximines. Based on selected examples, future directions within the field are presented. Finally, open synthetic challenges along with possible future solutions are discussed.







Abstract
Sulfur(VI)&#8208;based functional groups are popular scaffolds in a wide variety of research fields including synthetic and medicinal chemistry, as well as chemical biology. The growing interest in sulfur(VI)&#8208;containing molecules has motivated the scientific community to explore new methods to synthesize and modify them. Here, photocatalysis plays a key role granting access to new types of reactivity under mild reaction conditions. In this Perspective, we present a selection of works reported in the last six years focused on the photocatalytic assembly and reactivity of sulfones, sulfonamides, and sulfoximines. We addressed the key synthetic intermediates for each transformation, while discussing limitations and strength points of the protocols. Future directions of the field are finally presented.

         <title>Plenty of Space in the Backbone: Radical Ring&#8208;Opening Polymerization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 44, August 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The last decade has revitalized radical ring&#8208;opening polymerization (rROP), with a primary focus on inserting hydrolytic targets into the otherwise non&#8208;degradable all&#8208;carbon backbone obtained from radical polymerization. This review covers critical developments over the past three years that enable polymer architectures which are not only hydrolytically degradable but also comprise complex chemical main chain architectures.







Abstract
Radical polymerization is the most widely applied technique in both industry and fundamental science. However, its major drawback is that it typically yields polymers with non&#8208;functional, non&#8208;degradable all&#8208;carbon backbones&#8212;a limitation that radical ring&#8208;opening polymerization (rROP) allows to overcome. The last decade has seen a surge in rROP, primarily focused on creating degradable polymers. This pursuit has resulted in the creation of the first readily degradable materials through radical polymerization. Recent years have witnessed innovations in new monomers that address previous design limitations, such as ring strain and reactivity ratios. Furthermore, advances in integrating rROP with reversible deactivation radical polymerization (RDRP) have facilitated the incorporation of complex, customizable chemical payloads into the main polymer chain. This short review discusses the latest developments in monomer design with a focused analysis of their limitations in a broader historical context. Recently evolving strategies for compatibility of rROP monomers with RDRP are discussed, which are key to precision polymer synthesis. The latest chemistry surveyed expands the horizon beyond mere hydrolytic degradation. Now is the time to explore the chemical potential residing in the previously inaccessible polymer backbone.

         <title>Synthesis, Characterization and Photophysical Properties of a New Family of Rare&#8208;earth Cluster&#8208;based Metal&#8211;organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this work, nine new rare&#8208;earth metal&#8211;organic frameworks (RE&#8208;MOFs, where RE = Lu(III), Yb(III), Tm(III), Er(III), Ho(III), Dy(III), Tb(III), Gd(III), and Eu(III)) isostructural to Zr&#8208;MOF&#8208;808 are synthesized, characterized, and studied regarding their photophysical properties. Materials with high crystallinity and surface area are obtained from a reproducible synthetic procedure that involves the use of two fluorinated modulators. At the same time, these new RE&#8208;MOFs display tunable photoluminescent properties due to efficient linker&#8208;to&#8208;metal energy transfer promoted by the antenna effect, resulting in a series of RE&#8208;MOFs displaying lanthanoid&#8208;based emissions spanning the visible and near&#8208;infrared regions of the electromagnetic spectrum.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs) are considered promising candidates for large&#8208;scale energy storage due to their high safety, low cost, and environmental friendliness. As a core component, separator plays a unique yet oftentimes overlooked role in providing electrochemical stability in AZIBs. This concept focuses on the exquisite structure&#8208;property relationship of separators, highlighting three forms of these components and their structural design requirements, i.e., traditional membranes, solid&#8208;state&#160;electrolytes, and electrode coatings. The mechanism by which separators influence the zinc anode and the cathode is discussed. The article also identifies the challenges and potential future directions for functional separators in the development of high&#8208;performance AZIBs.</dc:description>

         <title>Self&#8208;immolative Polymer Hydrogels via In Situ Gelation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Water&#8208;soluble self&#8208;immolative polyglyoxylamides were synthesized with cross&#8208;linkable pendent azides. They were then cross&#8208;linked by copper&#8208;assisted or strain&#8208;promoted azide&#8208;alkyne click cycloadditions to form hydrogels that could be depolymerized on demand.







Abstract
Hydrogels are of interest for a wide range of applications. The ability to control when the hydrogel degrades can provide beneficial properties such as controlled degradation in the environment or the stimulated release of drugs or cells. Self&#8208;immolative polymers are a class of degradable polymers that undergo complete end&#8208;to&#8208;end depolymerization upon the application of a stimulus. They have been explored for hydrogel development, but the ability to prepare and selectively degrade self&#8208;immolative hydrogels under neutral aqueous conditions has so far been limited. We describe here the preparation of water&#8208;soluble polyglyoxylamides with cross&#8208;linkable pendent azides and their cross&#8208;linking to form hydrogels with 4&#8208;arm poly(ethylene glycol)s having unstrained and strained alkynes using copper&#8208;assisted and strain&#8208;promoted azide&#8208;alkyne click chemistry respectively. The influence of pendent azide density and solution polymer content on the resulting hydrogels was evaluated. A polyglyoxylamide with a 70&#8201;:&#8201;30 ratio of pendent hydroxyl:azide successfully provided hydrogels with compressive moduli ranging from 1.3&#8211;6.3&#8197;kPa under copper&#8208;free conditions at 10&#8211;20&#8201;% (w/w) of polymer in phosphate&#8208;buffered saline. Selective depolymerization and degradation of the hydrogels upon irradiation with light was demonstrated, resulting in reductions in the compressive moduli and the release of depolymerization products that were detected by NMR spectroscopy.

The ability to control when the hydrogel degrades can provide beneficial properties such as controlled degradation in the environment or the stimulated release of drugs or cells. Self-immolative polymers are a class of degradable polymers that undergo complete end-to-end depolymerization upon the application of a stimulus. They have been explored for hydrogel development, but the ability to prepare and selectively degrade self-immolative hydrogels under neutral aqueous conditions has so far been limited. We describe here the preparation of water-soluble polyglyoxylamides with cross-linkable pendent azides and their cross-linking to form hydrogels with 4-arm poly(ethylene glycol)s having unstrained and strained alkynes using copper-assisted and strain-promoted azide-alkyne click chemistry respectively. The influence of pendent azide density and solution polymer content on the resulting hydrogels was evaluated. A polyglyoxylamide with a 70&#8201;:&#8201;30 ratio of pendent hydroxyl:azide successfully provided hydrogels with compressive moduli ranging from 1.3&#8211;6.3&#8197;kPa under copper-free conditions at 10&#8211;20&#8201;% (w/w) of polymer in phosphate-buffered saline. Selective depolymerization and degradation of the hydrogels upon irradiation with light was demonstrated, resulting in reductions in the compressive moduli and the release of depolymerization products that were detected by NMR spectroscopy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Semi&#8208;Interpenetrating Polymer Network Anion Exchange Membranes Based on Quaternized Polybenzoxazine and Poly(Vinyl Alcohol&#8208;Co&#8208;Ethylene) for Acid Recovery by Diffusion Dialysis</title>

Semi&#8208;IPN AEMs are prepared by ring&#8208;open cross&#8208;linked quaternized polybenzoxazine with poly(vinyl alcohol&#8208;co&#8208;ethylene) exhibted excellent dimensional stability, high oxidation stability, good acid dialysis coefficient (UH+) and high separation factor (S).







Abstract
Acid recovery from acidic waste is a pressing issue in current times. Chemical methods for recovery are not economically feasible and require significant energy input to save the environment. This study reported a semi&#8208;interpenetrating polymer network (semi&#8208;IPN) anion exchange membranes (AEMs) for acid recovery by diffusion dialysis with excellent dimensional stability, high oxidation stability, good acid dialysis coefficient (UH+) and high separation factor (S). Semi&#8208;IPN AEMs are prepared by ring&#8208;open cross&#8208;linked quaternized polybenzoxazine (AQBZ) with poly(vinyl alcohol&#8208;co&#8208;ethylene), where AQBZ is obtained by Mannich reaction and Menshutkin reaction. All four proportions of semi&#8208;IPNs exhibit clear micro&#8208;phase separation, which is conducive to ion transport. The water uptake (WU) of the four semi&#8208;IPNs ranges from 14.2&#8201;% to 19.2&#8201;%, while the swelling ratio (SR) remains between 8.7&#8201;% and 11.3&#8201;%. These results indicate that the cross&#8208;linked structure in the designed semi&#8208;IPNs effectively control swelling and ensure dimensional stability. The thermal degradation temperature (Td5) of semi&#8208;IPN4:6 to semi&#8208;IPN7:3 varies from 309&#8201;&#176;C to 289&#8201;&#176;C, with an oxidation stability weight loss rate (WOX) ranging from 91.5&#8201;% to 93.5&#8201;%, demonstrating excellent thermal stability and oxidation stability. The semi&#8208;IPNs also show good UH+ values ranging from 11.9&#8211;16.3*10&#8722;3&#8197;m/h and high S values between 38.6 and 45.9, indicating the promising potential of the semi&#8208;IPNs.

         <title>Mechanochemical Diversity in Block Copolymers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Covalent polymer chains are known to undergo mechanochemical events when subjected to mechanical forces. Such force&#8208;coupled reactions, like C&#8208;C bond scission in homopolymers, typically occur in a non&#8208;selective manner but with a higher probability at the mid&#8208;chain. In contrast, block copolymers (BCPs), composed of two or more chemically distinct chains linked by covalent bonds, have recently been shown to exhibit significantly different mechanochemical reactivities and selectivities. These differences may be attributable to the atypical conformations adopted by their chains, compared to the regular random coil. Beyond individual molecules, when BCPs self&#8208;assemble into ordered aggregates in solution, the non&#8208;covalent interactions between the chains lead to meaningful acceleration in the activation of embedded force&#8208;sensitive motifs. Furthermore, the microphase segregation of BCPs in bulk creates periodically dispersed polydomains, locking the blocks in specific conformations which have also been shown to affect their mechanochemical reactivity, with different morphologies influencing reactivity to varying extents. This review summarizes the studies of mechanochemistry in BCPs over the past two decades, from the molecular level to assemblies, and up to bulk materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Boosting the Efficiency of Red Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence via Conjugation Enhancement in Push&#8208;Pull Naphthalimide Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this work, we synthesize a series of push&#8211;pull compounds bearing naphthalimide as the electron acceptor and tetraphenylethylene (TPE)/triphenylamine (TPA)/phenothiazine (PTZ) as the electron rich/electron donor units. These moieties are arranged in highly conjugated quadrupolar structures. The structure&#8211;property relationships are investigated through a joint experimental time&#8211;resolved spectroscopic and computational TD&#8211;DFT study. The femtosecond transient absorption and fluorescence up&#8211;conversion experiments reveal ultrafast photoinduced intramolecular charge transfer. This is likely the key factor leading to efficient spin&#8211;orbit CT&#8211;induced intersystem crossing for the TPA&#8211; and PTZ&#8211;derivatives as well as to small singlet&#8211;to&#8211;triplet energy gap. Consequently, evidence for a delayed fluorescence component is found together with the main prompt emission in the fluorescence kinetics both in solution and in thin film. The weight of the Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence (TADF) is greatly enhanced when these fluorophores are used as guests in solid&#8211;state host matrices. TADF is interestingly revealed in the orange&#8211;red region of the visible. Such long wavelength emission is here observed with surprisingly large fluorescence quantum yields, thanks to the conjugation enhancement achieved in these newly synthesized structures relative to previous studies. Our findings may be thus promising for the future development of efficient third generation TADF&#8211;based OLEDs.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Spent adsorbents for recycling as catalysts have drawn considerable attention due to their environmentally benign chemistry properties. However, traditional thermocatalytic strategies limit their applications. Here, we developed an enhanced photocatalytic strategy to expand the range of their applications. A magnetic chitosan/ZrO2 composites (MZT) for V(V) adsorption, which were prepared using chitosan, ZrO2 and Fe3O4 by one&#8208;pot synthesis. The spent MZT as a catalyst was used to synthesize 2&#8208;phenylbenzimidazole, yielding up to 89.7%. It also was implemented to photocatalysis reactions for recycle. The discolored rates of rhodamine B (RhB) were 72.3% and 97.4% by new and spent MZT, respectively. The new and spent MZT showed the forbidden bands were 251 nm and 561 nm, respectively. The result displayed spent MZT red shifted to the cyan light region. The mechanism of catalysis also has been studied in detail.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Cross&#8208;dehydrogenative couplings (CDC) present an efficient strategy for the assembly of biorelevant heterocycles, but are thus far largely limited to toxic transition metals and rather harsh reaction conditions. In sharp contrast, we, herein report on a mild photoelectrocatalyzed CDC&#8208;[4+2] annulation enabling the synthesis of functionalized isothiochromenes enabled by a proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET) strategy. The transformative photoelectrocatalysis obviated toxic transition&#8208;metal, high reaction temperatures, and stoichiometric chemical redox reagents. This approach was characterized by exceedingly mild conditions, ample substrate scope, and a commercially available catalyst. Gram&#8208;scale reactions and a telescoped synthesis route reflected the unique potential in the green synthesis of important S&#8208;heterocycles.</dc:description>

         <title>N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene Enabled Functionalization of Inert C(Sp3)&#8722;H Bonds via Hydrogen Atom Transfer (HAT) Processes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Developing methods to directly transform C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds is crucial in synthetic chemistry due to its atom&#8208; and step&#8208;economy and the prevalence of C&#8722;H bonds in various organic compounds. This mini&#8208;review summarizes recent advancements of NHC&#8208;catalyzed direct functionalization of &#8220;inert&#8221; C(sp3) &#8722;H bonds for cross C&#8722;C coupling reactions, that were enabled by the hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) processes, aiming to inspire distinct insights on the C&#8722;H functionalization by a distinct organocatalytic approach.







Abstract
Developing methods to directly transform C(sp3) &#8722;H bonds is crucial in synthetic chemistry due to their prevalence in various organic compounds. While conventional protocols have largely relied on transition metal catalysis, recent advancements in organocatalysis, particularly with radical NHC catalysis have sparked interest in the direct functionalization of &#8220;inert&#8221; C(sp3) &#8722;H bonds for cross C&#8722;C coupling with carbonyl moieties. This strategy involves selective cleavage of C(sp3) &#8722;H bonds to generate key carbon radicals, often achieved via hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) processes. By leveraging the bond dissociation energy (BDE) and polarity effects, HAT enables the rapid functionalization of diverse C(sp3)&#8722;H substrates, such as ethers, amines, and alkanes. This mini&#8208;review summarizes the progress in carbene organocatalytic functionalization of inert C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds enabled by HAT processes, categorizing them into two sections: 1) C&#8722;H functionalization involving acyl azolium intermediates; and 2) functionalization of C&#8722;H bonds via reductive Breslow intermediates.

         <title>Organic Reactions Enabled by Mechanical Force&#8208;Induced Single Electron Transfer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mechanochemistry emerges as a sustainable, solvent&#8208;free alternative to traditional synthesis, minimizing hazardous solvents and waste. This innovative field uncovers reaction pathways once considered impossible with solution&#8208;based techniques. This review seeks to encapsulate the advancements in mechanochemically triggered single electron transfer (SET) reactions involving inorganic substances, metals, polymers, and other materials over recent years.







Abstract
Mechanochemical reactions, achieved through milling, grinding, or other mechanical actions, have emerged as a solvent&#8208;free alternative to traditional solution&#8208;based chemistry. Mechanochemistry not only provides the opportunity to eliminate bulk solvent use, reducing waste generation, but also unveils a new reaction strategy which enables the realization of reactions previously inaccessible in solution. While the majority of organic reactions facilitated by mechanical force traditionally follow two&#8208;electron transfer pathways similar to their solution&#8208;based counterparts, the field of mechanochemically induced single&#8208;electron transfer (SET) reactions has witnessed rapid development. This review outlines examples of mechanochemical reactions facilitated by the SET process, focusing on the reagents that initiate SET, thereby positioning mechanochemistry as a burgeoning field within the realm of single&#8208;electron chemistry.

         <title>An In&#8208;Depth Exploration of Six Decades of the Kr&#246;hnke Pyridine Synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The six decades of the so&#8208;called &#8220;Kr&#246;hnke Pyridine Synthesis&#8221; were looked over in detail, charting the reaction set&#8208;up, mechanistic considerations and substitutions patterns, as well as the most common applications of the pyridines synthesized using the Kr&#246;hnke's method. Deviations from the standard approach are showcased, arguing the mechanistic tricks which lead to non&#8208;pyridine compounds.







Abstract
The Kr&#246;hnke Pyridine Synthesis has been discovered about six decades ago (1961), by Fritz Kr&#246;hnke and Wilfried Zecher at the University of Giessen. The original method involved the reaction of &#945;&#8208;pyridinium methyl ketone salts with &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated carbonyl compounds in the presence of a nitrogen source, frequently ammonium acetate. Since its discovery, the Kr&#246;hnke methodology has been demonstrated to be suitable for the preparation of mono&#8208;, di&#8208;, tri&#8208; and tetra&#8208;pyridines, with important applications in several research fields. Over the years, a number of modifications to the original approach have been developed and reported, enabling for the broad applicability of these methods even in modern days, also for the synthesis of non&#8208;pyridine compounds. In this critical and tutorial review, we will thoroughly explore and discuss the potential of the original method, the refinements that have been made over the years, as well as some applications arising from each type of pyridine and/or non&#8208;pyridine compounds produced by Kr&#246;hnke's approach.

         <title>Preparation and Optical and Electrochemical Properties of Boron (III) Octafluorosubphthalocyanines with One Triselenole and One Diselenet Ring</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unsymmetric boron (III) subphthalocyanines with a triselenole ring or a diselenete ring and eight fluoro groups were prepared by the reaction of 5,6&#8208;dicyano&#8208;4,7&#8208;diethylbenzo[1,2,3]triselenole and tetrafluorophthalonitrile with trichloroborane in xylene.

Abstract
Unsymmetric boron (III) subphthalocyanines with a triselenole ring or a diselenete ring and eight fluoro groups were prepared by the reaction of 5,6&#8208;dicyano&#8208;4,7&#8208;diethylbenzo&#8208;[1,2,3]triselenole and tetrafluorophthalonitrile with trichloroborane in xylene. The reaction was accompanied by a contraction of the triselenole ring to the diselenete ring. The substrate, dicyanobenzo[1,2,3]triselenole, was prepared by a new procedure via a photolytic demethylenation reaction of 3,7&#8208;diethyl[1,3]diselenolophthalonitrile using a 10&#8197;W white LED light. While triselenolosubphthalocyanine was treated by triphenylphosphine to give the diselenete derivative, the reaction of diselenetosubphthalocyanine with Woolion's reagent produced the expanded triselenole ring. The diselenete derivative reacted with tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)platinum to yield the corresponding platinum complex with Se&#8722;Pt bonds. Q&#8208;band absorption for the products appeared at around &#955;max=590&#8197;nm in the UV&#8208;vis spectrum and weak emission was observed at about &#955;e=620&#8197;nm. When diselenetosubphthalocyanine was treated with pentachloro antimonate in dichloromethane or sodium metal in hexane/tetrahydrofuran, the solution showed strong ESR signals. The structures of model compounds were optimized using the DFT method with the Gaussian 09 program at the B3LYP/6&#8208;31G (d, p) level.

         <title>Aggregation Mechanisms and Molecular Structures of Amyloid&#8208;&#946; in Alzheimer's Disease</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Amyloid protein aggregation proceeds through two distinct pathways. In one pathway, misfolded proteins undergo nucleation and elongation steps ultimately forming fibrillar aggregates in the bulk solution environment. Alternatively, protein aggregation can be initiated via LLPS and LSPT steps, which further promote amyloid fibrils formation.







Abstract
Amyloid plaques are a major pathological hallmark involved in Alzheimer's disease and consist of deposits of the amyloid&#8208;&#946; peptide (A&#946;). The aggregation process of A&#946; is highly complex, which leads to polymorphous aggregates with different structures. In addition to aberrant aggregation, A&#946; oligomers can undergo liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation (LLPS) and form dynamic condensates. It has been hypothesized that these amyloid liquid droplets affect and modulate amyloid fibril formation. In this review, we briefly introduce the relationship between stress granules and amyloid protein aggregation that is associated with neurodegenerative diseases. Then we highlight the regulatory role of LLPS in A&#946; aggregation and discuss the potential relationship between A&#946; phase transition and aggregation.

     alt="Aggregation Mechanisms and Molecular Structures of Amyloid-&#946; in Alzheimer's Disease"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amyloid protein aggregation proceeds through two distinct pathways. In one pathway, misfolded proteins undergo nucleation and elongation steps ultimately forming fibrillar aggregates in the bulk solution environment. Alternatively, protein aggregation can be initiated via LLPS and LSPT steps, which further promote amyloid fibrils formation.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amyloid plaques are a major pathological hallmark involved in Alzheimer's disease and consist of deposits of the amyloid-&#946; peptide (A&#946;). The aggregation process of A&#946; is highly complex, which leads to polymorphous aggregates with different structures. In addition to aberrant aggregation, A&#946; oligomers can undergo liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) and form dynamic condensates. It has been hypothesized that these amyloid liquid droplets affect and modulate amyloid fibril formation. In this review, we briefly introduce the relationship between stress granules and amyloid protein aggregation that is associated with neurodegenerative diseases. Then we highlight the regulatory role of LLPS in A&#946; aggregation and discuss the potential relationship between A&#946; phase transition and aggregation. Furthermore, we summarize the current structures of A&#946; oligomers and amyloid fibrils, which have been determined using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM). The structural variations of A&#946; aggregates provide an explanation for the different levels of toxicity, shed light on the aggregation mechanism and may pave the way towards structure-based drug design for both clinical diagnosis and treatment.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Arylazo&#8208;3,5&#8208;diphenylpyrazole Derivatives: Molecular Probes Exhibiting Reversible Light&#8208;induced Phase Transitions for Energy Storage and Direct Photolithographic Patterning</title>

Three&#8208;in&#8208;one: Azo&#8208;3,5&#8208;diphenylpyrazole derivatives with a long half&#8208;life of Z isomer exhibiting light&#8208;induced phase transition behaviour and possessing excellent energy storage and release characteristics over a wider temperature range and showing photolithography applications.







Abstract
We report azopyrazole photoswitches decorated with variable N&#8208;alkyl and alkoxy chains (for hydrophobic interactions) and phenyl substituents on the pyrazoles (enabling &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking), showing efficient bidirectional photoswitching and reversible light&#8208;induced phase transition (LIPT). Extensive spectroscopic, microscopic, and diffraction studies and computations confirmed the manifestation of molecular&#8208;level interactions and photoisomerization into macroscopic changes leading to the LIPT phenomena. Using differential scanning calorimetric (DSC) studies, the energetics associated with those accompanying processes were estimated. The long half&#8208;lives of Z isomers, high energy contents for isomerization and phase transitions, and the stability of phases over an extended temperature range (&#8722;60 to 80&#8201;&#176;C) make them excellent candidates for energy storage and release applications. Remarkably, the difference in the solubility of the distinct phases in one of the derivatives allowed us to utilize it as a photoresist in photolithography applications on diverse substrates.

         <title>Azopyridinium Ionic Photoswitches: Tuning Half&#8208;Lives of Z Isomers from Seconds to Days in Water</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present the design and synthesis of water&#8208;soluble heteroaryl azopyridinium ionic photoswitches (HAPIPs). The variations in the substituents of the five&#8208;membered heterocycle part, counterions, and solvent medium allow us to tune the Z isomer stability from seconds to days.







Abstract
Herein, we describe water&#8208;soluble heteroaryl azopyridinium ionic photoswitches (HAPIPs). We aim to combine variations in five&#8208;membered heterocycles, their substitutions, N&#8208;alkyl groups at pyridinium nitrogen, the position of pyridinium center relative to azo group, counterions, and solvents, in achieving better photoswitching. Through these studies, we successfully tuned the half&#8208;life of Z isomers of the resultant HAPIPs between seconds to days in water. Extensive spectroscopic studies and density functional theory (DFT) computations unravelled the factors responsible for thermal relaxation behavior. Considering the versatility of these photoswitches, the tunability of half&#8208;lives and photoswitching in aqueous medium allows the scope of applications in several fields.

         <title>Synthesis, Characterization and Energetic Properties of Hydroxymethyl&#8208;Bishomocubanone Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bishomocubane based energetic materials were designed, synthesized and evaluated for their applications in novel propellant formulations in rocket propulsion. Various performance parameters were assessed based on TGA&#8208;DTG analysis, BDEs, HOMO&#8208;LUMO energy gaps, ESP maps and impact sensitivity (h50). Three derivatives were found to be potential candidates with excellent ballistic performance and good stability for volume limited applications.







Abstract
The present work reports synthesis, characterization and theoretical insights on novel hydroxymethyl&#8208;bishomocubanone derivatives. Twelve new bishomocubanes (BHCs) were synthesized and fully characterized by various spectroscopic techniques and single crystal X&#8208;ray analysis. The densities of the title compounds were in the range of 1.30&#8211;1.59&#8197;g/cm3. Density&#8208;functional theory (DFT) based calculations at B3LYP/6&#8208;311++G(d,p) level of theory were performed on ten selected BHC based cage compounds. Propulsive and ballistic properties of newly synthesized hydroxymethyl&#8208;bishomocubanone derivatives in solid and liquid propulsion systems were calculated, and the results suggested that these compounds are superior to conventional fuel RP1 and binder HTPB. The detonation parameters revealed that these compounds are not explosive in nature and safe to use as solid propellants. Furthermore, kinetic and thermal stabilities of the title compounds were determined by HOMO&#8208;LUMO energy gap, ESP maps, impact sensitivity (h50) and bond dissociation energies (BDEs) followed by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential thermal analysis (DTA). Three compounds, a dinitroazide (Isp,vac=310.98&#8197;s), a dinitrate (Isp,vac=309.51&#8197;s), and a dinitronitrate (Isp,vac=309.20s) were found to be excellent candidates for volume limited applications.

         <title>Functionalization of Alginate Hydrogels with a Multifunctional Peptide Supports Mesenchymal Stem Cell Adhesion and Reduces Bacterial Colonization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work we report on the functionalization of an alginate hydrogel with a tailor&#8208;made multifunctional peptide containing the cell adhesive RGD motif and the LF1&#8211;11 antibacterial peptide. Such novel multifunctional biomaterial ensures the viability of human mesenchymal stem cells, enhances ALP activity and decreases bacterial infections of both Gram&#8208;positive and Gram&#8208;negative models.







Abstract
Hydrogels with cell adhesive moieties stand out as promising materials to enhance tissue healing and regeneration. Nonetheless, bacterial infections of the implants represent an unmet major concern. In the present work, we developed an alginate hydrogel modified with a multifunctional peptide containing the RGD cell adhesive motif in combination with an antibacterial peptide derived from the 1&#8211;11 region of lactoferrin (LF). The RGD&#8208;LF branched peptide was successfully anchored to the alginate backbone by carbodiimide chemistry, as demonstrated by 1H NMR and fluorescence measurements. The functionalized hydrogel presented desirable physicochemical properties (porosity, swelling and rheological behavior) to develop biomaterials for tissue engineering. The viability of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) on the peptide&#8208;functionalized hydrogels was excellent, with values higher than 85&#8201;% at day 1, and higher than 95&#8201;% after 14&#8197;days in culture. Moreover, the biological characterization demonstrated the ability of the hydrogels to significantly enhance ALP activity of MSCs as well as to decrease bacterial colonization of both Gram&#8208;positive and Gram&#8208;negative models. Such results prove the potential of the functionalized hydrogels as novel biomaterials for tissue engineering, simultaneously displaying cell adhesive activity and the capacity to prevent bacterial contamination, a dual bioactivity commonly not found for these types of hydrogels.

Precisely controlling the size of transition metal phosphides (TMPs) is crucial for the development of TMPs&#8208;based efficient host materials for Li&#8722;S batteries. With the help of the spherical polyelectrolyte brush (SPB), ultra&#8208;small CoP nanoparticle&#8208;decorated hollow carbon nanospheres (CoP@C) were synthesized. The CoP@C/S electrode delivered a stable specific discharge capacity due to the suppressed &#8216;&#8216;shuttle&#8217;&#8217; effect and fast reaction kinetics.







Abstract
Designing porous carbon materials with metal phosphides as host materials holds promise for enhancing the cyclability and durability of lithium&#8722;sulfur (Li&#8722;S) batteries by mitigating sulfur poisoning and exhibiting high electrocatalytic activity. Nevertheless, it is urgent to precisely control the size of metal phosphides to further optimize the polysulfide conversion reaction kinetics of Li&#8722;S batteries. Herein, a subtlety regulation strategy was proposed to obtain ultra&#8208;small CoP nanoparticles&#8208;decorated hollow carbon nanospheres (CoP@C) by using spherical polyelectrolyte brush (SPB) as the template with stabilizing assistance from polydopamine coating, which also works as carbon source. Leveraging the electrostatic interaction between SPB and Co2+, ultra&#8208;small Co particles with sizes measuring 5.5&#177;2.6&#8197;nm were endowed after calcination. Subsequently, through a gas&#8208;solid phosphating process, these Co particles were converted into CoP nanoparticles with significantly finer sizes (7.1&#177;3.1&#8197;nm) compared to state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art approaches. By uniformly distributing the electrocatalyst nanoparticles on hollow carbon nanospheres, CoP@C facilitated the acceleration of Li&#8208;ion diffusion and enhanced the conversion reaction kinetics of polysulfides through adsorption&#8208;diffusion synergy. As a result, Li&#8722;S batteries utilizing the CoP@C/S cathode demonstrated an initial specific discharge capacity of 850.0&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 1.0&#8201;C, with a low&#8208;capacity decay rate of 0.03&#8201;% per cycle.

         <title>Direct Access to Benzolactams and Benzolactones via Nickel Catalyzed Carbonylation with CO2</title>

Lactams and lactones are obtained in convenient manner via Ni&#8208;catalyzed carbonylation reaction with CO2. The cross&#8208;electrophile coupling engages AlCl3 as a key additive and its multiple roles are elucidated via a dedicated computational investigation.







Abstract
A new nickel catalyzed cross&#8208;electrophile coupling for accessing &#947;&#8208;lactams (isoindolinones) as well as &#947;&#8208;lactones (isobenzofuranones) via carbonylation with CO2 is documented. The protocol exploits the synergistic role of redox&#8208;active Ni(II) complexes and AlCl3 as a CO2 activator/oxygen scavenger, leading to the formation of a wide range of cyclic amides and esters (28 examples) in good to high yields (up to 87&#8201;%). A dedicated computational investigation revealed the multiple roles played by AlCl3. In particular, the simultaneous transient protection of the pendant amino group of the starting reagents and the formation of the electrophilically activated CO2&#8208;AlCl3 adduct are shown to concur in paving the way for an energetically favorable mechanistic pathway.

         <title>Designing Cobalt(II) Complex for Chemoselective Synthesis of 2&#8208;Aryl&#8208;3&#8208;Formyl Indoles from Amino Alcohols and Alcohols&#8224;</title>

This report describes synthesis of an cobalt (II) complex (C1) of N&#8208;((1&#8208;methyl&#8208;1H&#8208;imidazol&#8208;2&#8208;yl)methyl)&#8208;2&#8208;(phenylselanyl)ethan amine (L1). The cobalt complex was used as catalyst for a one&#8208;pot cascade reaction between 2&#8208;(2&#8208;aminoaryl)ethanols and benzyl alcohols. Interestingly, chemoselective formation of 2&#8208;aryl&#8208;3&#8208;formylindoles was observed instead of N&#8208;alkylated or C&#8208;3 alkylated indoles which was observed in earlier reports. The mechanistic studies suggest that the reaction proceeds through tandem imine formation followed by the cyclization.

         <title>Multicomponent Synthesis of 3(2H)&#8208;Furanones Initiated by Copper(II)&#8208;Catalyzed Alkyne&#8208;Carbonyl Cross Metathesis</title>

         <dc:description>
The cooperative Lewis&#8208; and Br&#248;nsted acid catalysis enables a multicomponent synthesis of 3(2H)&#8208;furanones from 1,3&#8208;diynes, alkyl glyoxylates and water, in which a highly chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208; and stereoselective alkyne&#8208;carbonyl cross metathesis of 1,3&#8208;diynes has been developed and suggested as the initial step of the annulation.







Abstract
The cooperative Lewis and Br&#248;nsted acid catalysis makes convergent synthesis of 3(2H)&#8208;furanones through a three&#8208;component coupling of 1,3&#8208;diynes, alkyl glyoxylates and water. Control experiments support that Lewis acid&#8208;catalyzed highly chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208; and stereoselective alkyne&#8208;carbonyl metathesis of 1,3&#8208;diynes and alkyl glyoxylates might be the initial step of this multicomponent annulation. Further chemo&#8208; and regioselective hydration of the alkyne&#8208;carbonyl metathesis product and subsequent oxa&#8208;Michael addition promoted by Br&#248;nsted acid results in the formation of two C&#8722;O bonds of the five&#8208;membered oxygen heterocycle.

         <title>Synthesis and Application of Robust Spiro [Fluorene&#8208;9] CAAC Ruthenium Alkylidene Complexes for the &#8220;One&#8208;Pot&#8221; Conversion of Allyl Acetate to Butane&#8208;1,4&#8208;diol</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of spiro [fluorene&#8208;9] CAAC Ru complexes was prepared. The dynamic properties and activities of molecular catalysts were tuned with smart design and tailoring. In addition to their high metathesis activity, these new compounds also proved to be excellent hydrogenation catalysts, which allowed the one&#8208;pot production of 1,4&#8208;butanediol, a key compound in the synthesis of biodegradable polymers.







Abstract
A series of a novel CAAC ligands featuring a spiro&#8208;fluorene group have been synthesized and complexed with ruthenium alkylidenes, yielding the corresponding Hoveyda&#8208;type derivatives as a new family of olefin metathesis catalysts. The novel complexes have been characterized by XRD, HRMS and NMR measurements. The synthetised complexes were tested in catalysis and showed good activity in olefin metathesis, as demonstrated on diethyl diallylmalonate and allyl acetate substrates. The unique backbone in the ligand with the large, yet inflexible condensed system renders interesting properties to the catalyst, exemplified by the good catalytic performance and improved Z&#8208;selectivity. In addition, the complex can also serve as a hydrogenation catalyst in a consecutive (one&#8208;pot) reaction. The latter reaction can convert allyl acetate to butane&#8208;1,4&#8208;diol, a valuable chemical intermediate for biodegradable polybutylene succinate (PBS).

         <title>Spatially Resolved Multicolor Luminescence Tuning on the Single 1D Heterogeneous Microrod</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Spatially resolved 1D heterogeneous microrods that emit variable emission on demand in response to excitation pulse width were developed. This kind of well&#8208;designed 1D heterogeneous microrods can carry a variety of optical features and show great potential in fabricating unclonable anti&#8208;counterfeiting tags.







Abstract
The spatially resolvable multicolored microrods have potential applications in many fields. However, achieving spatially resolved multicolor luminescence tuning on the microrod with a fixed composition remains a daunting challenge. Herein, a strategy is proposed that allows for the tuning of spatially resolved, multicolored upconversion (UC) luminescence (UCL) along a 1D heterogeneous microrod by modifying the pulse width of an external laser. NaYbF4:1&#8201;% Ho is identified as an UCL color&#8208;adjustable material, exhibiting pulse width&#8208;dependent multicolored UCL, resulting in a significant regulation of the red/green (R/G) ratio from 0.1 to 10.3 as the pulse width is varied from 0.1 to 10&#8197;ms. Such variability can be ascribed to differences in the number of photons incident upon the microrod throughout the period necessary for the UC process to occur. Additionally, NaYbF4:1&#8201;%Tm and NaYF4:20&#8201;%Yb,1&#8201;%Ho are employed as materials that emit blue and green light, respectively, with their UCL colors largely unaffected by changes in the pulse width. Subsequently, a tip&#8208;modified epitaxial growth method is utilized to integrate both UCL color&#8208;adjustable and non&#8208;adjustable segments within the same microrod. Comparing with single&#8208;color or fixed multicolor microrods, our developed multisegmented emissive color adjustable 1D heterogeneous microrods have unique optical characteristics and can carry more optical information.

         <title>Glyco&#8208;DNA: Enzymatic Synthesis of Base&#8208;Modified and Hypermodified DNA Displaying up to Four Different Monosaccharide Units in the Major Groove</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sugared DNA displaying up to four different glycosides in the major groove has been prepared by DNA polymerase catalyzed primer extension using four different carbohydrate&#8208;linked 2&#8217;&#8208;deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates.







Abstract
A portfolio of six modified 2&#8242;&#8208;deoxyribonucleoside triphosphate (dNTP) derivatives derived from 5&#8208;substituted pyrimidine or 7&#8208;substituted 7&#8208;deazapurine bearing different carbohydrate units (d&#8208;glucose, d&#8208;galactose, d&#8208;mannose, l&#8208;fucose, sialic acid and N&#8722;Ac&#8208;d&#8208;galactosamine) tethered through propargyl&#8208;glycoside linker was designed and synthesized via the Sonogashira reactions of halogenated dNTPs with the corresponding propargyl&#8208;glycosides. The nucleotides were found to be good substrates for DNA polymerases in enzymatic primer extension and PCR synthesis of modified and hypermodified DNA displaying up to four different sugars. Proof of concept binding study of sugar&#8208;modified oligonucleotides with concanavalin A showed positive effect of avidity and sugar units count.

         <title>Synthesis of a Library of Terpenoid Alkaloid&#8211;Like Compounds Containing Medium&#8208;Sized Rings via Reconstruction of the Humulene Skeleton</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We synthesized a library of terpenoid alkaloid&#8208;like compounds with diverse heteroatom&#8208;containing ring systems. Our strategy involves the introduction of a nitrogen atom into a humulene skeleton and subsequent ring reconstruction. A tartrate&#8208;resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) assay using a receptor activator of nuclear factor&#8208;&#954;B ligand (RANKL)&#8208;induced RAW264.7 cells allowed identifying a seed compound for bone&#8208;resorptive diseases.







Abstract
The construction of a chemical library based on natural products is a promising method for the synthesis of natural product&#8208;like compounds. In this study, we synthesized a terpenoid alkaloid&#8208;like compound library based on the humulene skeleton. Our strategy, which enables access to diverse ring systems such as 11&#8208;membered monocyclic, oxabicyclic, and medium&#8208;sized aza ring&#8208;containing scaffolds, involves the introduction of a nitrogen atom, an intermolecular C&#8722;O bond formation via Lewis acid&#8208;mediated epoxide&#8208;opening transannulation, and a ring&#8208;reconstruction strategy based on olefin metathesis. A cheminformatics analysis based on their structural and physicochemical properties revealed that the synthesized compounds have high three&#8208;dimensionality and high natural product likeness scores but with structural novelty. The usefulness of the terpenoid alkaloid&#8208;like compound library for drug discovery and the accessibility to structure&#8208;activity relationship studies were validated by performing an assay for osteoclast&#8208;specific tartrate&#8208;resistant acid phosphatase activity, resulting in the identification of a seed compound for bone&#8208;resorptive diseases such as osteoporosis.

         <title>Cobalt&#8208;Catalyzed Allylic Alkylation at sp3&#8208;Carbon Centers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Catalytic allylations have emerged as versatile processes for assembling C&#8722;C or C&#8722;heteroatom bonds. Traditionally, noble transition metals like Pd, Rh, or Ir have been extensively employed for these processes. However, recent sustainable catalytic strategies have shifted towards utilizing base metals as catalysts. Consequently, this review outlines the breakthroughs in cobalt&#8208;catalyzed allylic alkylations, emphasizing their noteworthy advancements in the field.







Abstract
The rising demand and financial costs of noble transition metal catalysts have emphasized the need for sustainable catalytic approaches. Over the past few years, base&#8208;metal catalysts have emerged as ideal candidates to replace their noble&#8208;metal counterparts because of their abundance and easiness of handling. Despite the significant advancements achieved with precious transition metals, earth&#8208;abundant cobalt catalysts have emerged as efficient alternatives for allylic substitution reactions. In this review, allylic alkylations at sp3&#8208;carbon centers mediated by cobalt will be discussed, with a special focus on the mechanistic features, scope, and limitations.

         <title>Organoboron Polymorphs with Different Molecular Packing Modes for Optical Waveguides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organoboron&#160;compounds offer&#160;a&#160;new strategy to design optoelectronic materials with high fluorescence efficiency. In this paper,&#160;the&#160;organoboron compound B&#8208;BNBP with double B&#8592;N bridged bipyridine bearing four fluorine atoms as core unit is facilely synthesized and exhibits&#160;a&#160;narrowband&#160;emission spectrum and a high photoluminescence quantum yield&#160;(PLQY)&#160;of 86.53% in solution. Its polymorphic&#160;crystals&#160;were controllable prepared by different solution self&#8208;assembly methods. Two microcrystals possess different molecular packing modes, one&#8208;dimensional microstrips (1D&#8208;MSs) for H&#8208;aggregation and two&#8208;dimensional microdisks (2D&#8208;MDs) for J&#8208;aggregation, owing to&#160;abundant intermolecular interactions of four fluorine atoms sticking out conjugated plane. Their structure&#8208;property relationships were investigated by crystallographic analysis and theoretical calculation. Strong emission spectra with the full width at half maximum (FWHM)&#160;of less than 30&#160;nm can also&#160;be&#160;observed in thin film and 2D&#8208;MDs. 1D&#8208;MSs possess thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF)&#160;property and exhibit superior optical waveguide performance with an optical loss of 0.061 dB/&#956;m. This work enriches the diversity of polymorphic microcrystals&#160;and further reveals the structure&#8208;property relationship in organoboron&#160;micro/nano&#8208;crystals.</dc:description>

         <title>N&#8208;Halosuccinimide&#8208;CeCl3 Transient Charge&#8208;Transfer Complexes as Semi Heterogeneous Photocatalyst in Cyclization of N&#8208;Propargylamides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this work, we used photoinert anhydrous cerium(III) chloride, to form a transient charge&#8208;transfer (CT) complex with NXS (N&#8208;bromosuccinimide or NBS and N&#8208;iodosuccinimide or NIS) in acetonitrile. These transient CT complexes acted as a semi&#8208;heterogeneous photocatalyst. These complexes allowed the Ce(III) ions to absorb light, turning them into strong electron donors that transferred electrons to NXS. This created halide radicals from NXS radical anions, helping to turn N&#8208;propargylamides into oxazole aldehydes. Experiments with DMPO and spin&#8208;trapping showed that a radical&#8208;based mechanism followed a single electron transfer (SET) pathway. Notably, CeCl3 was reused after the reaction without much decomposition, as it was regenerated and separated through simple filtration.</dc:description>

         <title>Visible Light&#8208;sensitized CO2 Methanation along a Relaxed Heat Available Route</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In photocatalysis, the resulted heat by the relaxation of most of incident light no longer acts as the industrially favorite driving force back to the target photo&#8208;reaction due to more or less the negative relation between photocatalytic efficiency and temperature. Here, we reported a visible light&#8208;sensitized protocol that completely reversed the negatively temperature&#8208;dependent efficiency in photo&#8208;driven CO2 methanation with saturated water vapor. Uniform Pt/N&#8208;TiO2/PDI self&#8208;assembly material decisively injects the excited electron of PDI sensitizer into N&#8208;TiO2 forming Ti&#8208;H hydride which is crucially temperature&#8208;dependent nucleophilic species to dominate CO2 methanation, rather than conventionally separated and trapped electrons on the conductor band. Meanwhile, the ternary composite lifts itself temperature from room temperature to 305.2 &#176;C within 400s only by the failure excitation upon simulated sunlight of 2.5 W/cm2, and smoothly achieves CO2 methanation with a record number of 4.98 mmol g&#8208;1 h&#8208;1 rate, compared to less than 0.02 mmol g&#8208;1 h&#8208;1 at classic Pt/N&#8208;TiO2/UV photocatalysis without PDI sensitization. This approach can reuse ~53.9% of the relaxed heat energy from the incident light thereby allow high&#8208;intensity incident light as strong as possible within a flowing photo&#8208;reactor, opening the most likely gateways to industrialization.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly Active Immobilized Catalyst for Ethylene Polymerization: Neutral Single Site Y(III) Complex Bearing Bulky Silylallyl Ligand</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Exploring the surface organometallic chemistry on silica of highly electrophilic yttrium complexes is a relatively uncommon endeavor, particularly when focusing on tris&#8208;alkyl complexes characterized by Y&#8208;C &#963;&#8208;alkyl bonds. A drawback with this class of complexes once grafted on silica, is the frequent occurrence of alkyl transfer by ring opening of siloxane groups, resulting in a mixture of species. Herein, we employed a more stable homoleptic yttrium allyl complex bearing bulky &#951;3&#8208;1,3&#8208;bis(trimethylsilyl)allyl ligand to limit this transfer reaction. This strategy has been validated by comparing the reactivity between [Y{&#951;3&#8208;1,3&#8208;C3H3(SiMe3)2}3] and [Y(o&#8208;CH2PhNMe2)3] with SiO2&#8208;700, where the undesired alkyl transfer reaction occurred for [Y(o&#8208;CH2PhNMe2)3] leading to a bipodal [(&#8801;SiO)2Y(o&#8208;CH2PhNMe2)] as major surface species, 2, while [Y{&#951;3&#8208;1,3&#8208;C3H3(SiMe3)2}3] resulted selectively in a monopodal species, [(&#8801;SiO)Y{&#951;3&#8208;1,3&#8208;C3H3(SiMe3)2}2], 1. The materials obtained were characterized by DRIFT, solid state NMR, mass balance analysis and EXAFS. Catalyst 1 showed high activity compared to 2 in ethylene polymerization. The catalytic performance of this neutral catalyst 1 was extended to pre&#8208;industrial scale in the presence of hydrogen and 1&#8208;hexene. An unprecedented activity, up to 7400 gPE&#183;gcat&#8208;1&#183;h&#8208;1 was obtained even with very low concentration of scavenger AliBu3 (TIBA/Y = 1.2).

         <title>Electronic&#8208;Structure Interpretation: How Much Do We Understand Ce L3 XANES?</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This article provides a brief overview of how Ce L3 XANES spectroscopy, especially in HERFD mode, can be utilized to investigate the electronic structure in cerium systems in a highly sophisticated manner. It addresses key questions relevant to chemists, material scientists and physicists, particularly regarding the oxidation state, ground&#8208;state configuration, electron occupation, and local structure near the Ce atom.







Abstract
Historically, cerium has been attractive for pharmaceutical and industrial applications. The cerium atom has the unique ability to cycle between two chemical states (Ce(III) and Ce(IV)) and drastically adjust its electronic configuration: [Xe] 4f15d16s2 in response to a chemical reaction. Understanding how electrons drive chemical reactions is an important topic. The most direct way of probing the chemical and electronic structure of materials is by X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) or X&#8208;ray absorption near&#8208;edge structure (XANES) in high energy resolution fluorescence detection (HERFD) mode. Such measurements at the Ce L3 edge have the advantage of a high penetration depth, enabling in&#8208;situ reaction studies in a time&#8208;resolved manner and investigation of material production or material performance under specific conditions. But how much do we understand Ce L3 XANES? This article provides an overview of the information that can be extracted from experimental Ce L3 XAS/XANES/HERFD data. A collection of XANES data recorded on various cerium systems in HERFD mode is presented here together with detailed discussions on data analysis and the current status of spectral interpretation, including electronic structure calculations.

One&#8208;pot hydrothermal strategy is developed to produce rGO/MXene/sulfur composite aerogels where sulfur is in&#8197;situ trapped in the 3D rGO/MXene conductive skeleton. The optimized composite aerogels as free&#8208;standing cathodes delivery a specific capacity of 951&#8197;mAhg&#8722;1 after 100 cycles at 0.2&#8197;C with a low fading rate of 0.062&#8201;% per cycle.







Abstract
The confinement and high utilization of sulfur in the cathodes is critical for improved cycling performance of lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries. In this case one&#8208;pot hydrothermal strategy is developed to produce rGO/MXene/sulfur composite aerogels where sulfur is in&#8197;situ trapped in the 3D rGO/MXene conductive skeleton. The optimized composite aerogels as free&#8208;standing cathodes delivery a specific capacity of 951&#8197;mAhg&#8722;1 after 100 cycles at 0.2&#8197;C with a low fading rate of 0.062&#8201;% per cycle. The excellent cycling performance is correlated with highly oxidized MXene and in&#8197;situ formed sulfate/thiosulfate complex layer in the long&#8208;term cycles.

A simply&#8208;synthesized small molecule solution system with repeatable and instantaneous force&#8208;related discoloration response (from yellowish to dark green) is attributed to accelerated generation of ortho&#8208;OH phenoxyl radical under shaking.







Abstract
Force&#8208;related discoloration materials are highly valuable because of their characteristics of visualization, easy operation, and environment friendliness. Most force&#8208;related discoloration materials focus on polymers and depend on bond scission, which leads to insensitivity and unrecoverable. Small&#8208;molecule systems based on well&#8208;defined molecular structures and simple composition with high sensitivity would exhibit considerable mechanochromic potential. However, to date, researches about force&#8208;related discoloration materials based on small molecule solution remain limited and are rarely reported. In this study, we developed a repeatable and instantaneous discoloration small molecule solution system by simple one&#8208;pot synthesis method. It exhibited an instantaneous chromic change from yellowish to dark green under shaking and reverting back to yellow within 1&#8197;minute after removal of the shaking. Experimental results confirmed that the discoloration mechanism is attributed to the oscillation accelerating the production of unstable ortho&#8208;OH phenoxyl radical. The newly developed shaking&#8208;induced discoloration small molecule system (SDSMS) promises in field of mechanical force sensing and optical encryption.

         <title>Facile Preparation and Study of Self&#8208;healing Water&#8208;absorbing Expanding Elastomers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The absorbent expansion elastomer plays a crucial role in engineering sealing and holds a promising future in this field as infrastructure continues to develop. Traditional materials have their limitations, especially when used in large construction projects where the integrity and reliability of the material are of utmost importance. In this work, a self&#8208;healing water&#8208;absorbing expansion elastomer was developed for continuous production at a large scale to monitor the sealing conditions of massive infrastructure projects. At room temperature, the material exhibited a repairing efficiency of 57.77% within 2 h, which increased to 84.02% after 12 h. This extended reaction time allowed for effective repairs when defects were detected. The material's strength reached approximately 3 MPa, making it suitable for a wide range of applications. The volume expansion rate of the material reached 200&#8208;400% for effective sealing, and the fictionalization of the packing made it have a good external force sensing effect and prevent heat build&#8208;up effect. The conductive detection performance of the absorbent expansion elastomer was improved by utilizing triple self&#8208;healing strategies, including dipole&#8208;dipole interaction, ion cross&#8208;linked network, and externally&#8208;aided restoration materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Sulfonamide&#8208;Sulfonimide Copolymers as Novel, Fluorine&#8208;Lean Type of Proton Exchange Membranes for Fuel Cell Application</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this work, a novel type of fluorine&#8208;lean proton exchange membranes is presented, using sulfonamide&#8208;sulfonimide functional groups for ion conduction. These groups are constructed on a polystyrene backbone for simple and cost&#8208;efficient usage as well as rapid scalability. The polymer is further tailored by adjusting the sulfonamide functionality with various end&#8208;groups, namely pentafluorophenyl, 4&#8208;fluorophenyl, butyl and octyl groups. These groups affect the pKa, leading to pKa values of 5.7 for the pentafluorophenyl substitution and pKa 10.5 for the alkyl chain. The glass transition temperature of the sulfonamide homopolymers can be reduced from Tg = 151&#176;C (Pentafluorophenyl) to 49&#176;C (Octyl), making the ionomer more flexible at room temperature. The combination of the non&#8208;swelling sulfonamide further mitigates the high water uptake of the sulfonimide while maintaining the nominal ion exchange capacity. This combination leads to extremely high proton conductivities with up to &#963; = 283 mS cm&#8208;1 at room temperature, which is clearly outperforming Nafion and approaches values for acid doped systems. This approach can pave the way to a novel type of ion conducting class in proton exchange membrane fuel cells.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Photo&#8208;regulated transmembrane ionophores enable spatial and temporal control over activity, offering promise as targeted therapeutics. Key to such applications is control using bio&#8208;compatible visible light. Herein, we report red&#8208;shifted azobenzene&#8208;derived synthetic anionophores that use amber or red light to trigger (E)&#8208;(Z) photoisomerisation and activation of transmembrane chloride transport. We demonstrate that by tuning the thermal half&#8208;life of the more active, but thermodynamically unstable, Z isomer to relax on the timescale of minutes, transient activation of ion transport can be achieved by activating with solely with visible light and deactivating by thermal relaxation.</dc:description>

         <title>The Diversity and Evolution of Chiral Br&#248;nsted Acid Structures</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The number and complexity of chiral Br&#248;nsted acids are dramatically increasing, ultimately leading to unique generations of catalysts with enhanced reaction capabilities. In this concept article, we discuss how the approach to optimizing these structures have transitioned from foundational structural tuning to a function&#8208;driven approach.







Abstract
The chemical space of chiral Br&#248;nsted acid catalysts is defined by quantity and complexity, reflecting the diverse synthetic challenges confronted and the innovative molecular designs introduced. Here, we detail how this successful outcome is a powerful demonstration of the benefits of utilizing both local structure searches and a comprehensive understanding of catalyst performance for effective and efficient exploration of Br&#248;nsted acid properties. In this concept article we provide an evolutionary overview of this field by summarizing the approaches to catalyst optimization, the resulting structures, and functions.

Various silanes as well as organosilicon polymer PHMS can react smoothly with HDDA&#8208;derived benzyne to give the arylation products. Lewis acid such as boron trifluoride etherate can accelerate these hydrosilylation reactions. Mechanism research showed that the hydrosililation reaction probably underwent a synergistic pathway.







Abstract
Benzyne derived from hexadehydrogenated Diels Alder (HDDA) reactions was found to be an efficient hydrosilylation acceptors. Various silanes can react smoothly with HDDA&#8208;derived benzyne to give the arylation products. Lewis acid such as boron trifluoride etherate can accelerate these hydrosilylation reactions. Polyhydromethylsiloxane (PHMS), a widely used organosilicon polymer, was also successfully modified using our method. About 5&#8201;% of Si&#8722;H bonds in the polymer were inserted by benzynes, giving a functional PHMS with much more solubility in methanol and with a blue&#8208;emitting fluorescence behavior. Mechanism research shows that the insertion of benzyne into the Si&#8722;H bond probably undergoes a synergistic pathway, which is quite different from the traditional radical&#8208;initiated hydrosilylation or transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed hydrosilylation.

         <title>Pyridinethiolate&#8208;Capped CdSe Quantum Dots for Red&#8208;Light&#8208;Driven H2 Production in Water</title>

         <dc:description>
This paper describes the first example of metal chalcogenide quantum dots that show the feasibility of harvesting red&#8208;light for H2 production. The noble&#8208;metal&#8208;free system lasts over 240&#8197;hour and realizes a turnover number of 43910. Triplet quantum yield of quantum dot is a key factor promoting the catalysis.







Abstract
The utilization of low&#8208;energy sunlight to produce renewable fuels is a subject of great interest. Here we report the first example of metal chalcogenide quantum dots (QDs) capped with a pyridinethiolate carboxylic acid (pyS&#8208;COOH) for red&#8208;light&#8208;driven H2 production in water. The precious&#8208;metal&#8208;free system is robust over 240&#8197;h, and achieves a turnover number (TON) of 43910&#177;305 (vs Ni) with a rate of 31570&#177;1690&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 for hydrogen production. In contrast to the inactive QDs capped with other thiolate ligands, the CdSe&#8208;pyS&#8208;COOH QDs give a significantly higher singlet oxygen quantum yield [&#934;&#916; (1O2)] in solution.

         <title>Co(II) Macrocyclic Complexes with Amide&#8208;Glycinate Pendants as ParaCEST and Liposomal CEST Agents</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Macrocyclic Co(II) complexes with appended amide&#8208;glycinate groups are paramagnetic chemical exchange saturation transfer (CEST) agents with highly shifted and intense CEST peaks due, in part, to the trans&#8208;orientation about the amide C&#8722;N bond. These Co(II) paramagnetic shift agents have reduced overall charge for higher loading into liposomes for lipoCEST studies.







Abstract
Macrocyclic Co(II) complexes with appended amide&#8208;glycinate groups were prepared to develop paramagnetic Co(II) chemical exchange saturation transfer (CEST) agents of reduced overall charge. Complexes with reduced charge and lowered osmolarity are important for their loading into liposomes and to provide complexes that are highly water soluble and well tolerated in animals. Co(L1) has two non&#8208;coordinating benzyl groups and two amide&#8208;glycinate pendants, whereas Co(L2) has two unsubstituted amide pendants and two amide&#8208;glycinate pendants on cyclam (1,4,8,11&#8208;tetraazacyclododecane). The 1H NMR spectrum of Co(L1) is consistent with a single cis&#8208;pendant isomer with both amide protons in the trans&#8208;configuration, as supported by an X&#8208;ray crystal structure. Co(L2) has a mixture of different isomers in solution, including the trans&#8208;1,4 and 1,8 pendant isomers. The Z&#8208;spectrum of Co(L1) shows one highly&#8208;shifted CEST peak, whereas Co(L2) exhibits six CEST peaks. Encapsulation of 40&#8197;mM Co(L1) in a liposome with osmotically&#8208;induced shrinking at 300 mOsm/L produces a liposomal CEST agent with saturation frequency offset of 3&#8197;ppm. Addition of the amphiphilic 1,4,7&#8208;triazacyclononane&#8208;based complex Co(L5) to the liposomal bilayer at 18&#8197;mM with Co(L1) encapsulated in the liposome at 50&#8197;mM changes the sign and increases the magnitude of the saturation frequency offset to &#8722;7.5&#8197;ppm at 300 mOsm/L.

MOFs are good precursors for active mixed&#8208;metal oxide/hydroxide electrocatalysts, with a uniform distribution of metals at the nanoscale. The catalytic properties of materials from monometallic Ni&#8208;, Co&#8208; and Zn&#8208;MOFs and bimetallic NiCo&#8208;, NiZn&#8208; and CoZn&#8208;MOFs with benzene&#8208;1,4&#8208;dicarboxylate (BDC) and 1,4&#8208;diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane (DABCO) are investigated in direct comparison. A MOF nanosheet was for the first time obtained on Ni foam through microwave&#8208;heating.







Abstract
Herein, a series of monometallic Ni&#8208;, Co&#8208; and Zn&#8208;MOFs and bimetallic NiCo&#8208;, NiZn&#8208; and CoZn&#8208;MOFs of formula M2(BDC)2DABCO and (M,M&#8217;)2(BDC)2DABCO, respectively, (M, M&#8217;=metal) with the same pillar and layer linkers 1,4&#8208;diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane (DABCO) and benzene&#8208;1,4&#8208;dicarboxylate (BDC) were prepared through a fast microwave&#8208;assisted thermal conversion synthesis method (MW) within only 12&#8197;min. In the bimetallic MOFs the ratio M:M&#8217; was 4&#8201;:&#8201;1. The mono&#8208; and bimetallic MOFs were selected to systematically explore the catalytic&#8208;activity of their derived metal oxide/hydroxides for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Among all tested bimetallic MOF&#8208;derived catalysts, the NiCoMOF exhibits superior catalytic activity for the OER with the lowest overpotentials of 301&#8197;mV and Tafel slopes of 42&#8197;mV&#8201;dec&#8722;1 on a rotating disk glassy carbon electrode (RD&#8208;GCE) in 1&#8197;mol&#8201;L&#8722;1 KOH electrolyte at a current density of 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. In addition, NiCoMOF was insitu grown in just 25&#8197;min by the MW synthesis on the surface of nickel foam (NF) with, for example, a mass loading of 16.6 mgMOF/gNF, where overpotentials of 313 and 328&#8197;mV at current densities of 50 and 300&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, respectively, were delivered and superior long&#8208;term stability for practical OER application. The low Tafel slope of 27&#8197;mV&#8201;dec&#8722;1, as well as a low reaction resistance from electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurement (Rfar=2 &#937;), confirm the excellent OER performance of this NiCoMOF/NF composite. During the electrocatalytic processes or even before upon KOH pre&#8208;treatment, the MOFs are transformed to the mixed&#8208;metal hydroxide phase &#945;&#8208;/&#946;&#8208;M(OH)2 which presents the active species in the reactions (turnover frequency TOF=0.252&#8197;s&#8722;1 at an overpotential of 320&#8197;mV). Compared to the TOF from &#946;&#8208;M(OH)2 (0.002&#8197;s&#8722;1), our study demonstrates that a bimetallic MOF improves the electrocatalytic performance of the derived catalyst by giving an intimate and uniform mixture of the involved metals at the nanoscale.

         <title>Disulfide Bonds as Functional Tethers in Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review details the state of the art of MOF applications in which appended disulfide bonds play a critical role in the functions of the materials. The installation of the disulfide bonds in and on the MOFs is also highlighted, and the installation methods are assigned to one of three categories.







Abstract
The functionality of metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) is often encoded by specific chemical moieties found within these architectures. As such, new techniques to install increasingly more complex functionalities in MOFs are regularly being reported in the literature. One such functional group is the disulfide bond. The redox behavior of this covalent linkage renders MOFs responsive to stimuli, often under reducing conditions. Here, we review examples in which disulfide&#8208;containing MOFs are deployed in applications including drug delivery, therapeutic ferroptosis, exfoliation, energy storage, sensing, and others.

         <title>Rational Molecular Design of Diketopyrrolopyrrole&#8208;Based n&#8208;Type and Ambipolar Polymer Semiconductors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recent advancements in molecular design strategies towards enhancing the n&#8208;type/ambipolar transporting properties of DPP&#8208;based polymer semiconductors have been thoroughly reviewed, especially focusing on copolymerization of DPP with different acceptors and weak donors, DPP flanked aromatic ring modification, DPP&#8208;core ring expansion and DPP dimerization.







Abstract
Diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP)&#8208;based polymer semiconductors have drawn great attention in the field of organic electronics due to the planar structure, decent solubilizing capability, and high crystallinity. However, the electron&#8208;deficient capacity of DPP derivatives are not strong enough, leading to relatively high&#8208;lying lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels of the corresponding polymers. As a result, n&#8208;type and ambipolar DPP&#8208;based polymers are rare and their electron mobilities also lag far behind the p&#8208;type counterparts, which limits the development of important p&#8208;n&#8208;junction&#8208;based electronic devices. Therefore, new design strategies have been proposed recent years to develop n&#8208;type/ambipolar DPP&#8208;based polymers with improved performances. In this view, these molecular design strategies are summarized, including copolymerization of DPP with different acceptors and weak donors, DPP flanked aromatic ring modification, DPP&#8208;core ring expansion and DPP dimerization. The relationship between the chemical structures and organic thin&#8208;film transistor performances is intensively discussed. Finally, a perspective on future trends in the molecular design of DPP&#8208;based n&#8208;type/ambipolar polymers is also proposed.

         <title>Silver&#8208;Catalyzed Olefination of Aryl Aldehydes Using Propiolates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Propiolates have been demonstrated as olefinating agents in the silver&#8208;catalyzed olefination of aryl and cinnamyl aldehydes to make &#945;,&#946;&#8208; and &#945;,&#946;,&#947;,&#948;&#8208;unsaturated esters with excellent E&#8208;selectivity. Trimethyl orthoformate plays a dual role by generating nucleophilic allenolate from propiolate and more electrophilic oxocarbenium ion from aldehyde to effect the reaction.







Abstract
Olefination of aldehydes is one of the fundamental reactions in organic synthesis. The commonly used Wittig olefination reaction however uses stoichiometric quantities reagents under basic conditions resulting in stoichiometric amounts of byproducts. Known catalytic alternate to the Wittig reaction requires stoichiometric amounts of silane reducing agents and high temperature. Herein, we report a base&#8208;free olefination of aryl aldehydes using propiolates as a surrogate for the Witting reagent under silver catalysis. Trimethyl orthoformate, in the presence of a silver catalyst adds to the alkynoate to form the nucleophilic silver allenolate which reacts with the reactive oxocarbenium ion formed from aldehyde under the reaction conditions. Subsequently, decarbonylation occurs to form the olefin. Trans olefin is formed exclusively from simple aryl aldehydes and cinnamaldehydes. Such a silver allenolate is conceptually novel and has not been explored so far.

         <title>The Excited State Dynamics of a Mutagenic Guanosine Etheno Adduct Investigated by Femtosecond Fluorescence Spectroscopy and Quantum Mechanical Calculations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The mutagenic etheno adduct of guanine exhibits a peculiar behavior of its lowest singlet excited state. The two independent and short&#8208;lived emission bands revealed by femtosecond upconversion fluorescence are associated with two strongly coupled bright minima of different geometry. Overall, the presence of the extra etheno ring on guanine slows down the efficient relaxation pathways, which are essential for the DNA photostability.







Abstract
Femtosecond fluorescence upconversion experiments were combined with CASPT2 and time dependent DFT calculations to characterize the excited state dynamics of the mutagenic etheno adduct 1,N2&#8208;etheno&#8208;2&#8217;&#8208;deoxyguanosine (&#1013;dG). This endogenously formed lesion is attracting great interest because of its ubiquity in human tissues and its highly mutagenic properties. The &#1013;dG fluorescence is strongly modified with respect to that of the canonical nucleoside dG, notably by an about 6&#8208;fold increase in fluorescence lifetime and quantum yield at neutral pH. In addition, femtosecond fluorescence upconversion experiments reveal the presence of two emission bands with maxima at 335&#8197;nm for the shorter&#8208;lived and 425&#8197;nm for the longer&#8208;lived. Quantum mechanical calculations rationalize these findings and provide absorption and fluorescence spectral shapes similar to the experimental ones. Two different bright minima are located on the potential energy surface of the lowest energy singlet excited state. One planar minimum, slightly more stable, is associated with the emission at 335&#8197;nm, whereas the other one, with a bent etheno ring, is associated with the red&#8208;shifted emission.

         <title>Visible Light&#8208;promoted C(sp3)&#8208;H &#945;&#8208;Carbamoylation of Cyclic Ethers with Isocyanides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
C(sp3)&#8208;H carbamoylation of cyclic ethers has been achieved via a domino sequence of Hydrogen Atom Transfer/Radical Polar Crossover pathways, finally enabling the nucleophilic addition of isocyanides to oxocarbenium ions. The current method features mild reaction conditions to generate oxocarbenium ions from non&#8208;activated ethers, along with good substrate scope and functional group compatibility.







Abstract
A protocol exploiting isocyanides as carbamoylating agents for the &#945;&#8208;C(sp3)&#8208;H functionalization of cyclic ethers has been optimized via a combined visible light&#8208;driven hydrogen atom transfer/Lewis acid&#8208;catalyzed approach. The isocyanide substrate scope revealed an exquisite functional group compatibility (18 examples, with yields up to 99&#8201;%). Both radical and polar trapping, kinetic isotopic effect and real&#8208;time NMR studies support the mechanistic hypothesis and provide insightful details for the design of new chemical processes involving the generation of oxocarbenium ions.

         <title>Bipyramidal Nanocrystals of Noble Metals: From Synthesis to Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Shape control has been a major theme of nanocrystal research in terms of synthesis, property tailoring, and optimization of performance in a variety of applications. Among the possible shapes, bipyramids are unique owing to their symmetry, planar defects, and exposed facets. In this article, we focus on the colloidal synthesis of noble&#8208;metal nanocrystals featuring a triangular bipyramidal shape, together with highlights of their properties and applications. We start with a brief discussion of the general classification and requirements for the nucleation and growth of bipyramidal nanocrystals, followed by specific aspects regarding the synthetic methods with a focus on the roles of reduction, etching, and capping, as well as controls of facet, size, aspect ratio, and corner truncation. In the end, we illustrate how these aspects affect the properties of bipyramidal nanocrystals for plasmonic and catalytic applications, together with future perspectives.</dc:description>

         <title>Neptunyl Pyrrophen Complexes: Exploring Schiff base chemistry with multidentate acyclic ligands and transuranics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>. We report the synthesis, structure, and characterization of two novel neptunyl complexes (NpO2L1 and NpO2L2) constructed from phenylene&#8208;substituted benzyl ester bis(pyrrole)phenylenediamine (named &#8220;pyrrophen&#8221;) ligands. In both cases, the neptunium center exists in the +6 oxidation state, . As our specific interest is in exploring the chemistry of neptunium compounds containing the linear neptunyl ion (NpO22+) through equatorially coordinating the metal by multidentate organic ligands, we have identified the differences that are likely to cause discrepancy between the two complexes by examining the ions and their coordinative environments through single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray crystallography, diffuse reflectance,, and Raman spectroscopy. This is the first time pyrrophen has been utilized in Np chemistry and demonstrates a new platform to study 5f electron participation and coordination.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrochemical reactions are very complex and involve a variety of physicochemical processes. Accurate and systematic monitoring of intermediate process changes during the reaction is essential for understanding the mechanism of electrochemical reactions and is the basis for rational design of new electrochemical reactions. On&#8208;line electrochemical analysis based on mass spectrometry (MS) has become an important tool for studying electrochemical reactions. This technique is based on different ionization and sampling means and realizes on&#8208;line analysis of electrochemical reactions by establishing electrochemistry&#8208;MS (EC&#8208;MS) coupling devices. In particular, it provides key evidence for elucidating the reaction mechanism by capturing and identifying the reactive reaction intermediates. This review will categorize various EC&#8208;MS devices and the organic electrochemical reaction systems they study, highlighting the latest research progress in recent years. It will also analyze the properties of various devices and look forward to the future development of EC&#8208;MS.</dc:description>

         <title>Expanding the &#960;&#8208;system of Fatty Acid&#8208;Anion Transporter Conjugates Modulates Their Mechanism of Proton Transport and Mitochondrial Uncoupling Activity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this paper we introduce a second phenyl substituent to the aryl urea scaffold and evaluate the proton transport mechanisms and mitochondrial uncoupling actions of these compounds against their monoarylated analogues. Notably, incorporation of meta&#8208; but not para&#8208;linked proximal rings enhanced proton transport and mitochondrial uncoupling actions in MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;231 cells, consistent with improved charge delocalisation by the urea anion binding group to produce membrane&#8208;permeable complexes.







Abstract
Mitochondrial uncoupling by small molecule protonophores is a promising strategy for developing novel anticancer agents. Recently, aryl urea substituted fatty acids (aryl ureas) were identified as a new class of protonophoric anticancer agents. To mediate proton transport these molecules self&#8208;assemble into membrane&#8208;permeable anionic dimers in which intermolecular hydrogen bonds between the carboxylate and aryl&#8208;urea anion receptor delocalise the negative charge across the aromatic &#960;&#8208;system. In this work, we extend the aromatic &#960;&#8208;system by introducing a second phenyl substituent to the aryl urea scaffold and compare the proton transport mechanisms and mitochondrial uncoupling actions of these compounds to their monoaryl analogues. It was found that incorporation of meta&#8208;linked phenyl substituents into the aryl urea scaffold enhanced proton transport in vesicles and demonstrated superior capacity to depolarise mitochondria, inhibit ATP production and reduce the viability of MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;231 breast cancer cells. In contrast, diphenyl ureas linked through a 1,4&#8208;distribution across the phenyl ring displayed diminished proton transport activity, despite both diphenyl urea isomers possessing similar binding affinities for carboxylates. Mechanistic studies suggest that inclusion of a second aryl ring changes the proton transport mechanism, presumably due to steric factors that impose higher energy penalties for dimer formation.

         <title>What determines the Lewis acidity of a bismuthane? Towards Bi&#8208;based FLPs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aiming at intramolecular frustrated Lewis pairs (FLPs) based on soft Lewis acidic bismuth centers, a phosphine function was combined with a dichloridobismuthane unit on a phenylene backbone utilizing a scrambling approach. The reaction between two equivalents of BiCl3 and (o&#8208;(Ph2P)C6H4)3Bi yielded (o&#8208;(Ph2P)C6H4)BiCl2(THF), the structure of which indicated Bi&#8230;P interactions and thus a pronounced Lewis acidity at the bismuth center that was confirmed by the Gutmann&#8208;Beckett method. However, the system turned out to be insufficient to be utilized for FLP reactivity. Hence, the chloride ligands were exchanged by iodide and C2F5 substituents, respectively. Despite a lower electronegativity the iodide compound exhibits a shorter Bi&#8230;P contact, while the C2F5 substituents led to a further decrease of the Lewis acidity, despite their high group electronegativity. DFT calculations rationalized this by a quenching of the Lewis acidity inherent to the &#963;*(Bi&#8213;C) orbital by negative hyperconjugation from occupied p&#8208;orbitals at the F atoms. Furthermore, it turned out that the strength of the covalent Bi&#8208;X &#963;&#8208;bond is a more important factor than the charge at Bi in determining the energetic accessibility and thus Lewis acidity of the antibonding &#963;*(Bi&#8213;C) orbital.</dc:description>

         <title>Benzodifuranone Crystals with Solid&#8208;State Emission Arising from the Introduction of Bulky Substituents</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Upon introducing bulky aromatic groups into benzodifuranone derivatives, crystals with unprecedented solid&#8208;state emission were obtained. A crystallographic analysis revealed that the emissive properties should most likely be attributed to the absence of stacking between the dye scaffolds. In addition to the solid&#8208;state emission, the compound showed responsivity to external stimuli, i.e., luminescent mechanochromism and thermosalient effect.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The creation of complex hollow nanostructures with precise control over size and shape represents a great challenge in supramolecular soft materials.

         <title>Phosphorous and Nitrogen Dual&#8208;Doped Carbon as a Highly Efficient Electrocatalyst for Sodium&#8208;Oxygen Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sodium&#8208;oxygen batteries have been regarded as promising energy storage devices due to their low overpotential and high energy density. Its applications, however, still face formidable challenges due to the lack of understanding about the influence of electrocatalysts on the discharge products. Here, a phosphorous and nitrogen dual&#8208;doped carbon (PNDC) based cathode is synthesized to increase the electrocatalytic activity and to stabilize the NaO2 superoxide nanoparticle discharge products, leading to enhanced cycling stability when compared to the nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon (NDC). The PNDC air cathode exhibits a low overpotential (0.36 V) and long cycling stability (120 cycles). The reversible formation/decomposition and stabilization of the NaO2 discharge products are clearly proven by in&#8208;situ synchrotron X&#8208;ray diffraction and ex&#8208;situ X&#8208;ray diffraction. Based on the density functional theory calculation, the PNDC has much stronger adsorption energy (&#8208;2.85 eV) for NaO2 than that of NDC (&#8208;1.80 eV), which could efficiently stabilize the NaO2 discharge products.</dc:description>

         <title>Sequential H/D Exchanges Resulting from Rollover&#8208;Cyclometallation during Photoirradiation of Rhodium(III) Complex in Methanol&#8208;d4</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We present the photoreaction of newly prepared bis(6,6&#8242;&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine)(oxalato)rhodium(III) ([Rh(N^N)2(ox)]+) in CD3OD. Photoirradiation of this complex causes the dissociation of ox, followed by the formation of the unprecedented Rh(III) complex with Rh&#8211;H and Rh&#8211;C s bonds, [Rh(N^N)(C^N)(H)(CD3OD)]+ (C^N = [6,6&#8242;&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine]&#8208;3&#8208;yl&#8208;&#954;C3,&#954;N1&#8242;). This hydride formation and cyclometallation spontaneously proceed owing to the conflict between the steric hindrance arising from the methyl groups of N^N and the driving force for the structural change due to [Rh(N^N)2]+ formation. Although [Rh(N^N)(C^N)(H)(CD3OD)]+ is initially converted to [Rh(N^N)2]+ by photoirradiation, it is immediately regenerated by the rollover cyclometallation of the [Rh(N^N)2]+ complex. [Rh(N^N)(C^N)(H)(CD3OD)]+ undergoes H/D exchange for the H atoms in the Rh&#8211;H bond and at the 3, 3&#8242;&#8208;positions of the N^N ligand during the photoirradiation. DFT calculations predict with reasonable certainty the spontaneous structural change of [Rh(N^N)2]+ to [Rh(N^N)(C^N)(H)(CD3OD)]+ and the subsequent photodriven Rh&#8211;C bond rupture leading to the formation of [Rh(N^N)2]+ accompanied by H/D exchange reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Advanced Synthesis, Structural Characterization, and Functional Applications of Precision Polymers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In the realm of biological macromolecules, entities such as nucleic acids and proteins are distinguished by their homochirality, consistently defined chain lengths, and integral sequence&#8208;dependent functionalities. Historically, these refined attributes have eluded traditional synthetic polymers, which often exhibit wide variabilities in chain lengths, limited batch&#8208;to&#8208;batch reproducibility, and stochastic monomer arrangements. Bridging this divide represents a pivotal challenge within the domain of polymer science&#8212;a challenge that the burgeoning discipline of precision polymer chemistry is poised to address. Recent advancements have yielded precision polymers that boast prescribed monomer sequences and narrow molecular weight distributions, heralding a new era for developing model systems to decipher structure&#8208;property correlations within functional polymers, analogous to those within biological matrices. This review discusses the innovative liquid&#8208;phase and solid&#8208;phase synthesis techniques for creating precision polymers and the advanced characterization tools essential for dissecting their structure and properties. We highlight potential applications in self&#8208;assembly, catalysis, data storage, imaging, and therapy, and provide insights into the future challenges and directions of precision polymers.</dc:description>

         <title>Bisphosphonium Benzene Diimides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The incorporation of cationic groups onto electron&#8208;poor compounds is a viable strategy for achieving potent electron acceptors, as evidenced by reports of air&#8208;stable radical forms of large aromatic diimides such as naphthalene and perylene diimides. These ions have also been observed to exhibit anion&#8208;&#960; interaction tendencies of interest in molecular recognition applications. The benefits of phosphonium incorporation, however, have not yet been extended to the smallest benzene diimides. Here, we report that dibrominated pyromellitic diimide and mellophanic diimide both readily undergo substitution reactions with phosphine sources to yield bisphosphonium compounds. In the single crystalline form, these dications display anion&#8208;&#960; interactions and, in the case of mellophanic diimide, the stabilization of a bromide&#8208;water H&#8208;bonding ring pattern. The reaction of these dications with chemical reductants readily provides the singly and doubly reduced redox states, which were characterized by UV&#8208;vis spectroscopy and found to exhibit intense absorptions extending into the near&#8208;IR region. Taken together, this work demonstrates that phosphonium incorporation onto congested aromatic diimide scaffolds is synthetically viable and produces unusual electron&#8208;poor compounds.</dc:description>

         <title>Versatile Metal&#8208;Free Arylation of BODIPY and Bis(BF2) Chromophores by Using Arylazosulfones in a Sunflow System</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>BODIPYs have a well&#8208;established role in biological sciences as chemosensors and versatile biological markers due to their chemical reactivity, which allows for fine&#8208;tuning of their photophysical characteristics. In this work, we combined the unique reactivity of arylazo sulfones with the advantages of a &#8220;sunflow&#8221; reactor to develop a fast, efficient, and versatile method for the photochemical arylation of BODIPYs and other chromophores. This approach resulted in red&#8208;shifted emitting fluorophores due to extended electronic delocalization at the 3&#8208; and 5&#8208;positions of the BODIPY core. This method represents an advantageous approach for BODIPY functionalization compared to existing strategies.</dc:description>

         <title>Is the E/Z Iminium Ratio a Good Enantioselectivity Predictor in Iminium Catalysis?</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The article describes using mass spectrometry and ion mobility to determine the isomer ratio of organocatalyst iminium ions. These ions are involved in the enantioselective addition of nucleophiles to &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated aldehydes. The isomer ratio, referred to as the &#8242;enantioselective potential&#8242;, is then compared with two reactions to evaluate its ability to predict enantioselectivity.







Abstract
Developing new enantioselective reactions is an important part of chemical discovery but requires time and resources to test large arrays of potential reaction conditions. New techniques are required to analyse many different reactions quickly and efficiently. Mass spectrometry is a high&#8208;throughput method; when combined with ion&#8208;mobility spectrometry, this technique can monitor diastereomeric reaction intermediates and thus be a handle to study enantioselective reactions. Through this technique and others, it was noted before that in the organocatalytic 1,4&#8208;addition to &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated aldehydes, the abundance of initial diastereomeric intermediates correlates strongly to that of the final enantiomeric products. This work determines isomeric abundance for various catalysts and aldehydes and uses it to predict the enantiomeric excess of two control reactions. The prediction matches well for one reaction but does not predict the obtained results for the second. This finding confirms that the E/Z ratio of the iminium intermediates can be used as a predictor for some reactions, but the kinetics of the following steps can dramatically change the true enantioselectivity.

&lt;p&gt;Developing new enantioselective reactions is an important part of chemical discovery but requires time and resources to test large arrays of potential reaction conditions. New techniques are required to analyse many different reactions quickly and efficiently. Mass spectrometry is a high-throughput method; when combined with ion-mobility spectrometry, this technique can monitor diastereomeric reaction intermediates and thus be a handle to study enantioselective reactions. Through this technique and others, it was noted before that in the organocatalytic 1,4-addition to &#945;,&#946;-unsaturated aldehydes, the abundance of initial diastereomeric intermediates correlates strongly to that of the final enantiomeric products. This work determines isomeric abundance for various catalysts and aldehydes and uses it to predict the enantiomeric excess of two control reactions. The prediction matches well for one reaction but does not predict the obtained results for the second. This finding confirms that the E/Z ratio of the iminium intermediates can be used as a predictor for some reactions, but the kinetics of the following steps can dramatically change the true enantioselectivity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Dioxygen Activation by Gold(I)&#8208;Distorted Porphyrin Dinuclear Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of dinuclear gold(I) porphyrin complexes that could activate dioxygen (O2) in polar protic solvents was synthesized and their reactivities were evaluated. The revealed mechanistic insights indicate the coordination of O2 to a gold center and the importance of hydrogen bonding of an NH proton in a porphyrin ligand.







Abstract
Interactions between gold&#8208;based materials and dioxygen (O2) have motivated researchers to understand reaction mechanisms for O2 activation by homo&#8208; and heterogeneous gold catalysts. In this work, gold(I) porphyrin dinuclear complexes were synthesized with a saddle&#8208;distorted porphyrin ligand. The gold(I) porphyrin complexes showed unprecedented O2 activation in the presence of protic solvents to form gold(III) tetradentate porphyrin complexes. Mechanistic insights into the O2 activation by the gold(I) center were elucidated by spectroscopic measurements and theoretical calculations, revealing that dissociation of halides on the gold(I) center by alcohol solvents and hydrogen bonding of an N&#8722;H proton in the distorted porphyrin with dioxygen played important roles in establishing the unique reactivities of gold(I) complexes.

         <title>Diastereoselective Synthesis of Sulfoxide&#8208;Functionalized N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene Ruthenium Complexes: An Experimental and Computational Study</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Diastereoselective synthesis: A new family of sulfoxide&#8208;functionalized NHCs was created by a simple oxidation protocol from thioether&#8208;NHC. Associated with Ru(p&#8208;cymene), these NHC&#8208;SO ligands allow the formation of a single diastereomer in the form of an enantiomeric couple. This interesting selectivity is discussed by means of DFT calculations and experiments.







Abstract
The synthesis of sulfoxide&#8208;functionalized NHC ligand precursors were carried out by direct and mild oxidation from corresponding thioether precursors with high selectivity. Using these salts, a series of cationic [Ru(II)(&#951;6&#8208;p&#8208;cymene)(NHC&#8208;SO)Cl]+ complexes were obtained in excellent yields by the classical Ag2O transmetallation route. NMR analyses suggested a chelate structure for the metal complexes, and X&#8208;ray diffractometry studies of complexes 4&#8201;b, 4&#8201;c, 4dBArF and 4&#8201;e unambiguously confirmed the preference for the bidentate (&#954;2&#8208;C,S) coordination mode of the NHC&#8208;SO ligands. Interestingly, only one diastereomer, in the form of an enantiomeric pair, was observed both in 1H NMR and in the solid state for the complexes. DFT calculations showed a possible intrinsic energy difference between the two pairs of diastereomer. The calculated energy barriers suggested that inversion of the sulfoxide is only plausible from the higher energy diastereomer together with bulky substituents. Inverting the configuration at the Ru center instead shows a lower and accessible activation barrier to provide the most stable diastereomer through thermodynamic control, consistent with the observation of a single species by 1H NMR as a pair of enantiomers. All these complexes catalyse the &#946;&#8208;alkylation of secondary alcohols. Complex 4dPF6 bearing an NHC&#8208;functionalised S&#8208;Ad group has been further studied with different primary and secondary alcohols as substrates, showing high reactivity and high to moderate &#946;&#8208;ol&#8208;selectivities.

         <title>A Comprehensive Review of Solar Photocatalysis &amp; Photothermal Catalysis for Hydrogen Production from Biomass: from Material Characteristics to Engineering Application</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review summarizes solar photo/photothermal catalysis (PPTC) H2 production from biomass to promote its engineering applications. It reviews design strategies and mechanisms for catalytic reforming. It presents the contribution of the reactor to H2 production performance and analyzes the effects of heat mass transfer and radiation. Finally, it concludes and outlooks PPTC for H2 production.







Abstract
Biomass photoreforming is a promising way of producing sustainable hydrogen thanks to the abundant sources of biomass feedstocks. Solar energy provides the heat and driven force to initial biomass oxidation coupled with H2 evolution. Currently, biomass photoreforming is still far from plant&#8208;scale applications due to the lower solar energy utilization efficiencies, the low H2 yield, and the lack of appropriate photoreactors. The production of H2 from photoreforming of native biomass and platform molecules was summarized and discussed with particular attention to the prospects of scaling up the catalysis technology for mass hydrogen production. The types of photoreforming, including photocatalysis and photothermal catalysis, were discussed, consequently considering the different requirements for photoreactors. We also reviewed the photoreactors that support biomass photoreforming. Numerical simulation methods were implemented for the solid&#8208;liquid two&#8208;phase flow and inter&#8208;particle radiative transfer involved in the reaction process. Developing concentrated photothermal catalytic flowed reactors is beneficial to scale&#8208;up catalytic hydrogen production from biomass.

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective Carbonyl Addition of Aryl Chlorides and Bromides to Aldehydes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Ni&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective addition of aryl halides to aldehydes has been studied with cyanobis(oxazoline) as chiral ligands and Mn as reductant. Aryl and heteroaryl bromides react with phenyl aldehyde to produce dibenzyl alcohols in 16&#8211;99&#8201;% yields with 53&#8211;92&#8201;% ees. Morever, phenyl chloride with aryl, heteroaryl and alkyl aldehydes synthesize dibenzyl alcohols in high yields with moderate enantioselectivities.







Abstract
The Ni&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective addition reaction of aryl halides to aldehydes was studied with cyanobis(oxazoline) as chiral ligands and Mn as reductant. Aryl and heteroaryl bromides reacted with phenyl aldehyde at room temperature to produce dibenzyl alcohols in 16&#8211;99&#8201;% yields with 53&#8211;92&#8201;% ees. Moreover, the coupling of phenyl chloride with a variety of aryl, heteroaryl and alkyl aldehydes was demonstrated in the presence of cyanobis(oxazoline)/Ni(II) at 60&#8201;&#176;C in generally high yields with moderate enantioselectivities.

         <title>Dual pH and Ca2+&#8208;Responsive PEG&#8208;Modified Pillar[5]arene&#8208;Based Supramolecular Nanodrug Delivery System: Excellent Cargo Encapsulation and Minimal Drug Toxicity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A pillar[5]arene&#8208;based nano&#8208;drug carrier WP5&#8835;EV has been formed by host&#8208;guest assembly. The carrier shows excellent cargo encapsulation properties and effectively prolongs the half&#8208;life and bioavailability of the drug. Importantly, WP5&#8835;EV can minimize the toxicity of the drug and enhance the antitumor activity.







Abstract
Chemotherapy is one of the most employed strategies in clinical treatment of cancer. However, reducing medication adverse effects and improving the biological activity remains a significant issue for chemotherapy. We developed a pH and Ca2+&#8208;responsive pillar[5]arene&#8208;based supramolecular nanodrug delivery system (NDDS) WP5&#8835;EV@DOX to address the aforementioned challenges. The formation of this NDDS began with the spontaneous formation of supramolecular nanodrug carrier WP5&#8835;EV in water from PEG&#8208;modified pillar[5]arene and the bipyridilium salt derivative EV through simple host&#8208;guest interaction. Then the antitumor drug doxorubicin DOX was efficiently loaded with a high encapsulation rate of 84.6&#8201;%. Cytotoxicity results indicated that the constructed nanoplatform not only reduced DOX toxicity and side effects on normal cell (293T), but also significantly enhanced the antitumor activity on cancer cell (HepG2). Moreover, in&#8197;vivo experiments showed that WP5&#8835;EV@DOX had a longer half&#8208;life and higher bioavailability in the blood of mice compared to the nake drug DOX, with increases to 212&#8201;% and 179&#8201;%, respectively. Therefore, WP5&#8835;EV@DOX has great potential in tumor therapy and provides a new idea for host&#8208;guest drug delivery system.

         <title>Oxygen&#8208;Promoted on&#8208;Surface Synthesis of Polyboroxine Molecules</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The on&#8208;surface formation of a novel B&#8722;O&#8722;B bond is promoted by oxygen atoms on the Au(111) surface upon breaking of the B&#8722;C bond in tri&#8208;naphthyl boroxine molecules. As a result, the synthesis of polyboroxine species is obtained and monitored by X&#8208;ray core spectroscopy.







Abstract
We present a protocol for the on&#8208;surface synthesis of polyboroxine molecules derived from boroxine molecules precursors. This process is promoted by oxygen species present on the Au(111) surface: oxygen atoms facilitate the detachment of naphthalene units of trinaphthyl&#8208;boroxine molecules and bridge two unsaturated boroxine centers to form a boroxine&#8208;O&#8208;boroxine chemical motif. X&#8208;ray spectroscopic characterization shows that, as the synthesis process proceeds, it progressively tunes the electronic properties of the interface, thus providing a promising route to control the electron level alignment.

         <title>Semisynthetic Glycoconjugates as Potential Vaccine Candidates Against Haemophilus influenzae Type a</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of the protein conjugates of Haemophilus influenzae type a (Hia) capsular polysaccharide oligomers is reported. The obtained neoglycoconjugates, comprising from one to five well&#8208;defined disaccharide repeating units, were employed in immunization studies, showing their ability to induce a specific immune response.







Abstract
Glycoconjugate vaccines are based on chemical conjugation of pathogen&#8208;associated carbohydrates with immunogenic carrier proteins and are considered a very cost&#8208;effective way to prevent infections. Most of the licensed glycoconjugate vaccines are composed of saccharide antigens extracted from bacterial sources. However, synthetic oligosaccharide antigens have become a promising alternative to natural polysaccharides with the advantage of being well&#8208;defined structures providing homogeneous conjugates. Haemophilus influenzae (Hi) is responsible for a number of severe diseases. In recent years, an increasing rate of invasive infections caused by Hi serotype a (Hia) raised some concern, because no vaccine targeting Hia is currently available. The capsular polysaccharide (CPS) of Hia is constituted by phosphodiester&#8208;linked 4&#8208;&#946;&#8208;d&#8208;glucose&#8208;(1&#8594;4)&#8208;d&#8208;ribitol&#8208;5&#8208;(PO4&#8594;) repeating units and is the antigen for protein&#8208;conjugated polysaccharide vaccines. To investigate the antigenic potential of the CPS from Hia, we synthesized related saccharide fragments containing up to five repeating units. Following the synthetic optimization of the needed disaccharide building blocks, they were assembled using the phosphoramidite approach for the installation of the phosphodiester linkages. The resulting CPS&#8208;based Hia oligomers were conjugated to CRM197 carrier protein and evaluated in&#8197;vivo for their immunogenic potential, showing that all glycoconjugates were capable of raising antibodies recognizing Hia synthetic fragments.

         <title>Ring Rearrangement Reactions of 4&#8208;Alkenylisocoumarins and Photophysical Evaluation of Multi&#8208;Substituted Anthracene Products</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Several &#960;&#8208;extended homophthalates have been synthesised by novel ring&#8208;opening/ring&#8208;closing cascade reaction of lactol silyl ethers bearing acrylate moiety. Thus obtained homophthalates can be used as effective C4 building blocks for polycyclic aromatic systems.







Abstract
Herein we report that readily available 4&#8208;alkenylisocoumarins can be regarded as potent dienolate equivalents. For example, lactol silyl ethers derived from 4&#8208;alkenylisocoumarins were selectively converted to the corresponding benzo&#8208;homophthalates through a fluoride&#8208;induced ring opening step that was followed by a ring closure through a vinylogous intramolecular aldol condensation. Likewise, nucleophilic activation of 4&#8208;alkenylisocoumarins directly yields diversely poly&#8208;substituted naphthalenes and anthracenes without formation of any regioisomer. Photophysical evaluation of a set of thus obtained 1,3&#8208;di&#8208; and 1,3,4&#8208;trisubstituted anthracenes reveals their distinct intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) character during light absorption in polar solutions and excimer emission from the solid state when a face&#8208;to&#8208;face &#960;&#8208;stacked molecular assembly is present in the crystal packing.

         <title>Modulating Helix&#8208;Preference of an Axially&#8208;Twisted Molecular Scaffold Through Diastereomeric Salt Formation with Tartaric Acid Stereoisomers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A chiral, axially&#8208;twisted molecular scaffold (ATMS) undergoes subtle differences in the stereochemical orientations on enantioselective interaction with stereoisomers of tartaric acid (TA), generating diverse spectroscopic outcomes to permit naked&#8208;eye enantio&#8208;discrimination.







Abstract
Herein, we designed a chiral, axially&#8208;twisted molecular scaffold (ATMS) using pyridine&#8208;2,6&#8208;dicarboxamide (PDC) unit as pivot, chiral trans&#8208;cyclohexanediamine (CHDA) residues as linkers, and pyrene residues as fluorescent reporters. R,R&#8208;ATMS exclusively adopted M&#8208;helicity and produced differential response in UV&#8208;vis, fluorescence, and NMR upon addition of tartaric acid (TA) stereoisomers allowing naked&#8208;eye detection and enantiomeric content determination. Circular dichroism (CD) profile of R,R&#8208;ATMS underwent unique changes during titration with TA stereoisomers &#8208; while loss of CD signal at 345&#8197;nm was observed with equimolar D&#8208;TA and meso&#8208;TA, inversion was seen with equimolar L&#8208;TA. Temperature increase weakened these interactions to partially recover the original CD signature of R,R&#8208;ATMS. 2D NMR studies also indicated the significant structural changes in R,R&#8208;ATMS in the solution state upon addition of L&#8208;TA. Single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (SCXRD) studies on the crystals of the R,R&#8208;ATMS&#8835;D&#8208;TA salt revealed the interacting partners stacked in arrays and ATMS molecules stabilized by &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking between its PDC and pyrene residues. Contrastingly, tightly&#8208;packed supramolecular cages comprised of four molecules each of R,R&#8208;ATMS and L&#8208;TA were seen in R,R&#8208;ATMS&#8835;L&#8208;TA salt, and the ATMS molecules contorted to achieve CH&#8208;&#960; interactions between its pyrene residues. These results may have implications in modulating the helicity of topologically&#8208;similar larger biomolecules.

         <title>Chromium Complexes with Benzanellated N&#8208;Heterocyclic Phosphenium Ligands&#8211;Synthesis, Reactivity and Application in Catalytic CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Benzanellation of the N&#8208;heterocyclic phosphenium (NHP) ligands in chromium complexes has impact on their reactivity, facilitating reduction to a radical anion, hydrogenation to a &#963;&#8208;H2&#8208;complex, and Cr&#8208;to&#8208;P hydride mobility in a NHP&#8208;phosphine&#8208;hydride&#8208;complex formed by isomerization of the H2&#8208;complex. The latter reduces CO2 with formation of a formato complex, which is a key to mediate the transfer hydrogenation of CO2 to methanol with NH3BH3.







Abstract
A chromium complex carrying two benzanellated N&#8208;heterocyclic phosphenium (bzNHP) ligands was prepared by a salt metathesis approach. Spectroscopic studies suggest that the anellation enhances the &#960;&#8208;acceptor ability of the NHP&#8208;units, which is confirmed by the facile electrochemical reduction of the complex to a spectroscopically characterized radical anion. Co&#8208;photolysis with H2 allowed extensive conversion into a &#963;&#8208;H2&#8208;complex, which shows a diverse reactivity towards donors and isomerizes under H&#8722;H bond fission and shift of a hydride to a P&#8208;ligand. The product carrying phosphenium, phosphine and hydride ligands was also synthesized independently and reacts reversibly with CO and MeCN to yield bis&#8208;phosphine complexes under concomitant Cr&#8208;to&#8208;P&#8208;shift of a hydride. In contrast, CO2 was not only bound but reduced to give an isolable formato complex, which reacted with ammonia borane under partial recovery of the metal hydride and production of formate. Further elaboration of the reactions of the chromium complexes with CO2 and NH3BH3 allowed to demonstrate the feasibility of a Cr&#8208;catalyzed transfer hydrogenation of CO2 to methanol. The various complexes described were characterized spectroscopically and in several cases by XRD studies. Further insights in reactivity patterns were provided through (spectro)electrochemical studies and DFT calculations.

         <title>Pegylated Phosphine Ligands in Iridium(I) Catalyzed Hydrogen Isotope Exchange Reactions in Aqueous Buffers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pegylated phosphine as water&#8208;soluble ligand in iridium(i) catalyzed hydrogen isotope exchange (HIE) reactions. The new catalyst was studied in HIE reactions in buffers and protic solvents. We found that solvent and pH had a strong impact on the two occurring HIE processes.







Abstract
The synthesis of a water&#8208;soluble, phosphine&#8208;pegylated iridium(I) catalyst and its application in hydrogen isotope exchange (HIE) reactions in buffer is reported. The longer polyethylene glycol side chains on the phosphine increased the water solubility independently from the pH. HIE reactions of polar substrates in protic solvents were studied. DFT calculations gave further insights into the catalytic processes. The scope and limitation of the pegylated catalyst was studied in HIE reactions of several complex compounds in borax buffer at pH&#8197;9 and the best conditions were applied in a tritium experiment with the drug telmisartan.

         <title>Multi Stimuli Responsive Dual Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission and Photochromic Behavior of a Tetraphenyl Substituted Triphenylamine Derivative and its Application as Anti&#8208;counterfeiting Agent</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Twisted polyaromatic luminescent systems are well known for their AIE behavior and this AIE feature is exploited for a wide variety of applications. In this work, a new tetraphenyl substituted triphenylamine moiety is coupled with spiropyran and the final compound furnished both photochromism, acidochromism, and AIE behavior which was used to afford anti&#8208;counterfeiting ink for versatile response under different wavelength of light.







Abstract
A multi&#8208;stimuli responsive tetraphenyl substituted tripehnylamine&#8208;based aggregation induced emissive (AIE) material coupled with spiropyran was prepared. Owing to the presence of AIE and photochromic moiety, the molecule exhibits emissive aggregates, photochromism, and acidochromism. The multiple stimuli sensitive behavior of the molecule was explored for anti&#8208;counterfeiting behavior on TLC plate and commercial banknotes. The fluorogenic and photogenic response under UV and visible light established the potential of the candidate as a new generation encryption material.

         <title>A Prebiotic Pathway to Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photochemical activation is the key in the prebiotic synthesis of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide: NAD+ is obtained under prebiotic conditions by formation of nicotinamide riboside from ammonia, cyanoacetaldehyde, prop&#8208;2&#8208;ynal, glycol aldehyde and glyceraldehyde. Regioselective phosphorylation and use of light activated AMP yields NAD+ in a continuous formation process.







Abstract
Enzymes play a fundamental role in cellular metabolism. A wide range of enzymes require the presence of complementary coenzymes and cofactors to function properly. While coenzymes are believed to have been part of the last universal ancestor (LUCA) or have been present even earlier, the syntheses of crucial coenzymes like the redox&#8208;active coenzymes flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) or nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) remain challenging. Here, we present a pathway to NAD+ under prebiotic conditions starting with ammonia, cyanoacetaldehyde, prop&#8208;2&#8208;ynal and sugar&#8208;forming precursors, yielding in&#8197;situ the nicotinamide riboside. Regioselective phosphorylation and water stable light activated adenosine monophosphate derivatives allow for topographically and irradiation&#8208;controlled formation of NAD+. Our findings indicate that NAD+, a coenzyme vital to life, can be formed non&#8208;enzymatically from simple organic feedstock molecules via photocatalytic activation under prebiotically plausible early Earth conditions in a continuous process under aqueous conditions.

Here, we present a pathway to NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; under prebiotic conditions starting with ammonia, cyanoacetaldehyde, prop-2-ynal and sugar-forming precursors, yielding in&#8197;situ the nicotinamide riboside. Regioselective phosphorylation and water stable light activated adenosine monophosphate derivatives allow for topographically and irradiation-controlled formation of NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;. Our findings indicate that NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, a coenzyme vital to life, can be formed non-enzymatically from simple organic feedstock molecules via photocatalytic activation under prebiotically plausible early Earth conditions in a continuous process under aqueous conditions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>The Journey for the Synthesis of Large Acenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Acenes, the group of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) with linearly fused benzene rings, possess distinctive electronic properties with potential applicability in material science. Hexacene was the largest acene obtained and characterized in the last century, followed by heptacene in 2006. Since then, a race for obtaining the largest acene resulted in the development of several members of this family as well as diverse innovative synthetic strategies, from solid&#8208;state chemistry to the promising on&#8208;surface chemistry. This last technique allows the obtention of higher acenes, up to tridecacene, the largest acene so far. This review presents the different methodologies employed for the synthesis of acenes, highlighting the newest studies, to provide a much more thorough understanding of the essence of the electronic structure of this captivating group of organic compounds.</dc:description>

         <title>Why Are Some Pnictogen(III) Pincer Complexes Planar and Others Pyramidal?</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Geometrically&#8208;constrained pnictogen pincer complexes have emerged in recent years as platforms for unique stoichiometric and catalytic chemical transformations. These complexes feature dynamic conformations ranging from fully planar at the pnictogen centre to distorted&#8208;pyramidal geometries, as well as variation between phases. Although the valued reactivity of pnictogen pincer complexes is ascribed to their geometries, there is no unified model to explain the observed conformational outcomes across different ligands and pnictogen centres. Here we propose such a model through computational analysis of more than 1300 structures across 64 complexes (16 ligands and 4 heavy pnictogens), explaining the experimental observations and making new predictions. By looking at signatures of bond stability (bond lengths, Wiberg bond indices) and delocalization (NPA charges, Hirshfeld charges), our framework posits a pnictogen&#8208;based &#963;&#8208;bonding effect that favours pyramidalization and exists in competition with a ligand&#8208;based &#960;&#8208;bonding effect that favours planarity. Variations in structure as a function of pnictogen identity, ligand tethering, electronics, and aromaticity can be reconciled with reference to a balance between these two opposing forces. Careful consideration of the &#963;/&#960;&#8208;bonding effects may aid in the rational design of future pnictogen pincer complexes with predictable geometries and reactivities.</dc:description>

         <title>Chemical Predictive Modelling and Natural Product&#8208;based Divergent Synthesis &#8211; Design of Type B PPAPs with Nanomolar Activities against MRSA</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In response to antibiotic resistance, a late&#8208;stage divergent synthesis approach was used to synthesize 30 new type B PPAPs for SAR studies against MRSA. AI&#8208;trained 3D&#8208;QSAR models based on cellular assay data, were used to screen a virtual compound, and the 20 most promising candidates were synthesized. Significant anti&#8208;MRSA activity at nanomolar concentration was demonstrated by these novel PPAPs.







Abstract
In response to the pressing global challenge of antibiotic resistance, time efficient design and synthesis of novel antibiotics are of immense need. Polycyclic polyprenylated acylphloroglucinols (PPAP) were previously reported to effectively combat a range of gram&#8208;positive bacteria. Although the exact mode of action is still not clear, we conceptualized a late&#8208;stage divergent synthesis approach to expand our natural product&#8208;based PPAP library by 30 additional entities to perform SAR studies against methicillin&#8208;resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Although at this point only data from cellular assays are available and understanding of molecular drug&#8208;target interactions are lacking, the experimental data were used to generate 3D&#8208;QSAR models via an artificial intelligence training and to identify a common pharmacophore model. The experimentally validated QSAR model enabled the estimation of anti&#8208;MRSA activities of a virtual compound library consisting of more than 100,000 in&#8208;silico generated B PPAPs, out of which the 20 most promising candidates were synthesized. These novel PPAPs revealed significantly improved cellular activities against MRSA with growth inhibition down to concentrations less than 1&#8197;&#956;m.

         <title>A Schottky/Z&#8208;Scheme Hybrid for Augmented Photocatalytic H2 and H2O2 Production</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The MCNRBO Schottky/Z&#8208;scheme ternary hybrid possessing shortened charge transfer resistance along with improved separation efficiency and abundant charged species demonstrated stupendous photocatalytic H2 and H2O2 production.







Abstract
The prodigious employment of fossil fuels to conquer the global energy demand is becoming a dreadful threat to the human society. This predicament is appealing for a potent photocatalyst that can generate alternate energy sources via solar to chemical energy conversion. With this interest, we have fabricated a ternary heterostructure of Ti3C2 nanosheet modified g&#8208;C3N4/Bi2O3 (MCNRBO) Z&#8208;scheme photocatalyst through self&#8208;assembly process. The morphological analysis clearly evidenced the close interfacial interaction between g&#8208;C3N4 nanorod, Bi2O3 and Ti3C2 nanosheets. The oxygen vacancy created on Bi2O3 surface, as suggested by XPS and EPR analysis, supported the Z&#8208;scheme heterojunction formation between g&#8208;C3N4 nanorod and Bi2O3 nanosheets. The collaborative effect of Z&#8208;scheme and Schottky junction significantly reduced charge transfer resistance promoting separation efficiency of excitons as indicated from PL and EIS analysis. The potential of MCNRBO towards photocatalytic application was investigated by H2O2 and H2 evolution reaction. A superior photocatalytic H2O2 and H2 production rate for MCNRBO is observed, which are respectively around 5 and 18 folds higher as compared to pristine CNR nanorod. The present work encourages for the development of a noble, eco&#8208;benign and immensely efficient dual heterojunction based photocatalyst, which can acts as saviour of human society from energy crisis.

It provides selective access to 5&#8208;, 6&#8208; and 7&#8208;membered cyclic allyl ethers, scaffolds found in a large variety of pharmaceutical interesting and bioactive (natural) products. The gram scale preparation and functionalizations of the thus obtained product were demonstrated. Finally, we applied our novel method in a 2nd generation total synthesis of (R,R,R)&#8208;&#945;&#8208;tocopherol improving the overall efficiency significantly (9 steps in total and 38&#8201;% yield for chiral chromane building block).







Abstract
We report herein of a novel, enantioselective and rhodium&#8208; catalyzed cyclisation of allenyl alcohols towards chiral &#945;&#8208;vinylic, cyclic ethers employing a rhodium/(R,R)&#8208;Me&#8208;ferrocelane catalyst. The corresponding chiral cyclic products were obtained in general high yields and enantioselectivities. The synthetic value of our obtained products was further exemplified by transformations of the allylic ether function. Furthermore, applying our newly developed method in our previously reported route towards the total synthesis of (R,R,R)&#8208;&#945;&#8208;tocopherol, we accomplished a significantly improved 2nd generation synthesis of the chromane building providing a total number of 13 steps and an overall total yield of 27&#8201;%.

&lt;p&gt;The rhodium/Me-ferrocelane-catalyzed asymmetric intramolecular hydroalkoxylation of allenyl alcohols is reported. It provides selective access to 5-, 6- and 7-membered cyclic allyl ethers, scaffolds found in a large variety of pharmaceutical interesting and bioactive (natural) products.

         <title>In situ reconstructured alloy nanosheets heterojunction for highly selective electrochemical CO2 reduction to formate</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Tin (Sn)&#8208;based materials are expected to realize efficient CO2 electroreduction into formate. Herein, we constructed a heterojunction by depositing Cu on Cu&#8208;doped SnS2 nanosheets. During the electrochemical reaction, this heterojunction evolves to a highly active phase of Cu2O@Cu6Sn5 while maintaining its two&#8208;dimensional morphology. Specifically, a partial current density of 35 mA cm&#8208;2 with an impressive faradaic efficiency of 93% for formate production was achieved over the evolved heterojunction. In situ and ex situ experiments elucidated the formation mechanism of the Cu2O@Cu6Sn5 heterojunction. Cu6Sn5 nanosheets were formed via a stepwise desulfurization process, while Cu2O was generated through its reaction with hydroxyl radicals. This evolved heterojunction with a high electrochemically active surface area synergistically stabilized the *OCHO intermediate, thereby significantly enhancing the selectivity and activity. Our findings provide insight into the structural evolution process and guide the development of selective electrocatalysts for CO2 reduction.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Ce(IV) Heteroleptic Double&#8208;Decker Complex with a New Helical Naphthalocyanine as a Potential Gearing Subunit</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This paper describes the synthesis of a cerium(IV)&#8208;based molecular gear composed of a thioether functionalized phthalocyanine anchoring ligand, and a helical naphthalocyanine rotating cogwheel functionalized with four carbazoles. The naphthalocyanine ligand 9 was obtained after eleven steps (overall yield of 0.2%) as a mixture of three geometrical isomers, two of which are chiral and exhibit high levels of steric hindrance, as shown by DFT calculations. Their attributions have been made using 1H&#8208;NMR based on their different symmetry groups. The ratio of isomers was also determined and the prochiral C4h naphthalocyanine shown to be the major compound (55%). Its heteroleptic complexation with cerium (IV) and the anchoring phthalocyanine ligand 10 gave the targeted molecular gear in a 16% yield.</dc:description>

         <title>One&#8208;pot Functionalization for the Preparation of Cobaltocene&#8208;Modified Redox&#8208;Responsive Porous Microparticles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Porous organic cobaltocenium&#8208;containing particles are scarce in literature but highly interesting for their electrochemical properties and reusability in, for example, catalysis or magnetic systems. In this work, we present a scalable one&#8208;pot strategy to introduce tailorable amounts of cobaltocenium on a porous substrate, adjusting the electrochemical switching capability. For this purpose, 3&#8208;(triethoxysilyl)propan&#8208;1&#8208;amine (APTES) and ethynyl cobaltocenium hexafluorophosphate is used as functionalization agents for in&#8208;situ catalyst&#8208;free hydroamination, followed by silane condensation at the particles&#8217; surface. Functionalized particles are characterized by attenuated total reflection infrared spectroscopy (ATR&#8208;IR), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), laser scanning confocal microscopy (LSCM), scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive X&#8208;ray spectroscopy, inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP&#8208;MS), powder X&#8208;ray diffraction (PXRD) and cyclic voltammetry (CV) showing excellent control over the degree of functionalization, i.e., the added cobaltocenium reagents. The electrochemical stability and good addressability while preserving the porous structure are shown. By utilizing higher amounts of APTES, the overall cobaltocenium amount can be reduced in favor of additional amine groups, strongly affecting the electrochemical behavior, making this functionalization strategy a good platform for metallopolymer immobilization and tailored functionalization. Additionally, thermal treatment of the synthesized metallopolymer microparticles paves the way to magnetic properties with tailorable microporous architectures for end&#8208;of&#8208;life and upcycling aspects.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrolytes for Aluminum&#8208;Ion Batteries: Progress and Outlook</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aluminum&#8208;ion batteries (AIBs), as electrochemical energy storage technologies, are advantageous because of their high theoretical specific capacity, lightweightness, zero pollution, safety, inexpensiveness, and abundant resources, which make them recent research hot spots. However, their electrolyte issues significantly limit their commercialization. The electrolyte choices for AIBs are significantly limited, and most of the available choices do not facilitate the three&#8208;electron&#8208;transfer reaction of Al3+/Al. Thus, this review presents an overview of recent advances in electrolytes, as well as modification strategies for AIBs, to clarify the limitations of existing AIB electrolytes and offer guidance for improving their performances. Furthermore, the advantages as well as limitations and possible solutions for each electrolyte are discussed, after which the future of AIB electrolytes is envisioned.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Triphenylene derivatives are highly investigated for their electronic, supramolecular and photophysical properties, but the direct modification of the central aromatic core is particularly challenging especially in the internal positions 1, 4, 5, 8, 9, and 12.

         <title>[5]Molecular Necklaces Formed Through Zn2+&#8208;Templated Binding of Macrocycles to Dynamically Formed Imines as Guest Recognition Sites</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein we demonstrate an &#8220;in&#8208;ring establishing&#8221; strategy for assembling interlocked molecules through dynamic imine formation, &#8220;establishing&#8221; the host recognition sites in situ. Using Zn2+ ions to template the assembly of a pyridine&#8208;containing macrocycle with semidumbbell&#8208;shaped triazole&#8208;containing aldehyde and amine derivatives, we obtained the corresponding [2]rotaxane in high yield (85%) after subsequent imine reduction (NaBH4) and amine protonation (NH4PF6). We performed the same three steps (assembly, reduction, protonation) to prepare a stable and highly symmetrical [5]molecular necklace ([5]MN) from 12 components (two almost&#8208;90&#176;&#8208;oriented dialdehydes, two almost&#8208;90&#176;&#8208;oriented diamines, four macrocycles, four Zn2+ ions) in an overall yield of 69%.</dc:description>

         <title>Cooperative NHC and Photoredox Catalyzed Radical Aminoacylation of Alkenes to Tetrahydropyridazines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Tetrahydropyridazines constitute an important structural motif found in numerous natural products and pharmaceutical compounds. Herein, we report an&#160;aminoacylation reaction of alkenes that enables the synthesis of&#160;1,4,5,6&#8208;tetrahydropyridazines through cooperative N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) and photoredox catalysis. This approach involves the&#160;6&#8208;endo&#8208;trig&#160;cyclization of&#160;N&#8208;centered&#160;hydrazonyl radicals, generated via single&#8208;electron oxidation of hydrazones, followed by a radical&#8211;radical coupling step.&#160;The mild process tolerates a wide range of common functional groups and affords a variety of&#160;tetrahydropyridazines&#160;in moderate to high yields. Preliminary investigations using chiral NHC catalysts demonstrate the potential of this protocol for asymmetric radical reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly Selective Boron&#8208;Wittig Reaction: a Practical Method to Synthesize Trans&#8208;Aryl Alkenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Olefins play an essential role in synthetic chemistry, serving not only as important synthons but also as key functional groups in numerous bio&#8208;active molecules. Consequently, there has been considerable interest in the development of more powerful methods for olefins. While the Wittig reaction stands as a prominent choice for olefin synthesis due to its simplicity and the ready availability of raw materials, its limitation lies in the challenge of controlling cis&#8208;trans selectivity, hampering its broader application. In this study, a novel Boron&#8208;Wittig reaction has been developed utilizing gem&#8208;bis(boryl)alkanes and aldehydes as starting materials. This method enables creating favourable intermediates, which possess less steric hindrance, and leading to trans&#8208;olefins via intramolecular O&#8211;B bonds elimination. Notably, synthesis studies have validated its good efficacy in modifying bioactive molecules and synthesizing drug molecules with great trans&#8208;selectivity. Furthermore, the reaction mechanism was elucidated based on intermediate trapping experiments, isotope labelling studies, and kinetic analyses.</dc:description>

         <title>Stacking Transformation&#8208;Triggered Circularly Polarized Luminescence Reversion in &#947;&#8208;Cyclodextrins&#8208;Pyrene Co&#8208;assembly</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>&#8203;Considerable attention has been directed towards cyclodextrins (CDs) in the creation of co&#8208;assembled CPL&#8208;active materials, owing to their intrinsic chiral host cavities and synergistic host&#8208;guest interactions. However, achieving reversed CPL emission regulation with single&#8208;handedness CDs moiety poses a significant challenge. In this study, we have devised a series of &#947;&#8208;CD&#8208;based host&#8208;guest complexes comprising dual pyrene imidazolium derivatives with multiple linkers, which exhibit reversed circularly polarized emission. We have uncovered that the transformation of excimer stacking within &#947;&#8208;CD/pyrene complexes contributes to the inverted CPL emissions originating from a single&#8208;handed chiral host. This research elucidates the phenomenom of (+)&#8208; and (&#8208;)&#8208;circularly polarized excimer emission (CPEE) within &#947;&#8208;CD, arising from right&#8208; and left&#8208;handed stacking conformations, respectively.</dc:description>

         <title>Indole Nucleophile Triggers Mechanistic Divergence in Ni&#8208;Photoredox N&#8211;Arylation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This study presents a Ni&#8208;photoredox method for indole N&#8208;arylation, broadening the range of substrates to include indoles with unprotected C3&#8208;positions and base&#8208;sensitive groups. Through detailed mechanistic inquiries, a Ni(I/III) mechanism was uncovered, distinct from those commonly proposed for Ni&#8208;catalyzed amine, thiol, and alcohol arylation, as well as from the Ni(0/II/III) cycle identified for amide arylation under almost identical conditions. The key finding is the formation of a Ni(I) intermediate bearing the indole nucleophile as a ligand prior to oxidative addition, which is rare for Ni&#8208;photoredox carbon&#8208;heteroatom coupling and has a profound impact on the reaction kinetics and scope. The pre&#8208;coordination of indole renders a more electron&#8208;rich Ni(I) intermediate, which broadens the scope by enabling fast reactivity even with challenging electron&#8208;rich aryl bromide substrates. Thus, this work highlights the often&#8208;overlooked influence of X&#8208;type ligands on Ni oxidative addition rates and illustrates yet another mechanistic divergence in Ni&#8208;photoredox C&#8211;heteroatom couplings.</dc:description>

         <title>Assessing Solid Catalysts with Ionic Liquid Layers (SCILL) from Molecular Dynamics Simulations:

On the role of local charge polarization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Recent developments in molecular mechanics modelling of metal catalyst surfaces with interfaces to complex ad&#8208;layers or bulk liquids enable the study of 10 nm scale systems by molecular dynamics simulations of up to microseconds. Therein, electronic polarization as otherwise benchmarked by quantum calculations is mimicked via atom&#8208;centered partial charges that are adjusted dynamically to account for changes in local environment. Apart from thermal fluctuations, this encompasses molecule association and dissociation processes as well as externally applied voltage. Here, we elaborate the concept of employing the charge equilibration method to the molecular dynamics simulation of solid catalysts, namely metal surfaces and substrate&#8208;supported metal nanoparticles. This showcases the association of reactants and their interplay with local charge polarization upon co&#8208;adsorption of ionic liquids or application of external voltage &#8211; thus paving the way to understanding complex interfaces in (electro&#8208;)catalysis from molecular dynamics simulation.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhanced electrochemical performance of NiMn layered double hydroxides/graphene oxide composites synthesized by one&#8208;step hydrothermal method for supercapacitors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This study aims to enhance the performance of supercapacitors, focusing particularly on optimizing electrode materials. While pure NiMn layered double hydroxides (LDHs) exhibit excellent electrochemical properties, they have limitations in achieving high specific capacitance. Therefore, this paper successfully synthesized composite materials of NiMn LDHs with varying loadings of graphene oxide (GO) using a hydrothermal method. Systematic physicochemical characterization of the synthesized materials, such as powder X&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD), X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), field&#8208;emission scanning electron microscopy (FE&#8208;SEM), and Raman spectroscopy, revealed the influence of GO doping on the microstructure and electrochemical performance of NiMn LDHs. Electrochemical tests demonstrated that the NiMn LDHs/GO electrode material exhibited optimal electrochemical performance with a specific capacitance of 2096 F g&#8208;1 at 1 A g&#8208;1 current density and 1471 F g&#8208;1 at 10 A g&#8208;1, when GO doping level was 0.45 wt%. Furthermore, after 1000 cycles of stability testing, the material retained 53.3% capacitance at 5 A g&#8208;1, indicating good cyclic stability. This study not only provides new directions for research on supercapacitor electrode materials but also offers new strategies for developing low&#8208;cost and efficient electrode materials.</dc:description>

Systematic physicochemical characterization of the synthesized materials, such as powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), and Raman spectroscopy, revealed the influence of GO doping on the microstructure and electrochemical performance of NiMn LDHs. Electrochemical tests demonstrated that the NiMn LDHs/GO electrode material exhibited optimal electrochemical performance with a specific capacitance of 2096 F g-1 at 1 A g-1 current density and 1471 F g-1 at 10 A g-1, when GO doping level was 0.45 wt%. Furthermore, after 1000 cycles of stability testing, the material retained 53.3% capacitance at 5 A g-1, indicating good cyclic stability. This study not only provides new directions for research on supercapacitor electrode materials but also offers new strategies for developing low-cost and efficient electrode materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Data&#8208;driven Approach&#160;for Enhanced CO2 Capture&#160;with Ruthenium Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>To attain carbon neutrality, significant efforts have been made to capture and use CO2. The homogeneous hydrogenation of CO2 catalyzed by transition metal complexes, particularly ruthenium complexes, has demonstrated significant advantages and is regarded as a viable approach for practical application. Insertion of CO2 into the Ru&#8208;H bond, producing the Ru&#8208;formate product, is the key step in the hydrogenation of CO2. In order to parameterize the catalytic activities in the CO2 insertion into the Ru&#8211;H bond, the concept of simplified mechanism&#8208;based approach with data&#8208;driven practice (SMADP) has been introduced in this paper. The results showed that the hydricity of the Ru&#8211;H complex (&#916;GH&#8208;) might serve as a single active descriptor in the process of CO2 insertion, and that a novel Ru complex in CO2 catalysis may not be easily obtained by mere modification of the auxiliary ligand at the ruthenium metal site.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Benzene is one of the most ubiquitous structural motifs in chemistry. The valence isomers of benzene have also attracted synthetic chemists&#8217; attention due to their unique structures, bonding, and reactivity. We have been investigating boron&#8208;nitrogen&#8208;containing benzene valence isomers via photoisomerization of 1,2&#8208;azaborines. In this contribution, we summarize recent developments of these highly strained BN&#8208;heterocyclic compounds including their synthesis, characterization, proposed mechanism of formation, and their potential applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Surface Plasmon Resonance Allows to Correlate Molecular Properties with Diffusion Coefficients of Linear Chain Alcohols</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Every biological and physicochemical process occurring in a fluid phase depends on the diffusion coefficient (D) of the species in solution. In the present work, a model to describe and fit the behaviour of D as a function of structure and extensive thermodynamics parameters in binary solutions of linear chain organic molecules is developed. Supporting experimental and computational evidences for this model are obtained by measuring D for a series of n&#8208;alcohols through a novel surface plasmon resonance method and molecular dynamics simulations. This allows to propose a kind of combined analysis to explain the dependence of D on various thermodynamic and structural parameters. The results suggest that for small linear systems in the range from 0 to 200 g mol&#8208;1 and under the assumption that the diffusive activation energy is a linear function of mass, D is strictly dependent on the molecular shape and on the relative strength of the solute&#8208;solvent intermolecular forces represented by a parameter named R. The newly proposed approach can be utilized to characterize and monitor progressive changes in physicochemical properties for any investigated species upon increasing the dimension of the aggregate/molecule along a certain direction.</dc:description>

         <title>The Effect of Reactive Oxygen Species on Respiratory Complex I Activity in Liposomes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Respiratory complex I (R&#8208;CI) is an essential enzyme in the mitochondrial electron transport chain but also a major source of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which are implicated in neurodegenerative diseases and ageing. While the mechanism of ROS production by R&#8208;CI is well&#8208;established, the feedback of ROS on R&#8208;CI activity is poorly understood. Here, we perform EPR spectroscopy on R&#8208;CI incorporated in artificial membrane vesicles to reveal that ROS (particularly hydroxyl radicals) reduce R&#8208;CI activity by making the membrane more polar and by increasing its hydrogen bonding capability. Moreover, the mechanism that we have uncovered reveals that the feedback of ROS on R&#8208;CI activity via the membrane is transient and not permanent; lipid peroxidation is negligible for the levels of ROS generated under these conditions. Our successful use of modular proteoliposome systems in conjunction with EPR spectroscopy and other biophysical techniques is a powerful approach for investigating ROS effects on other membrane proteins.</dc:description>
