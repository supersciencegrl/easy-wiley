         <title>Design and Synthesis of a Medium&#8208;Pore Aluminosilicate Zeolite SCM&#8208;53</title>

ABSTRACT
Designing and synthesizing condensed, thermally stable zeolites by inverse sigma expansion of open&#8208;framework zeolites has been well achieved. However, creating thermally stable open&#8208;framework zeolites through sigma expansion of condensed&#8208;frameworks remains rare. Herein, we present the rational design and synthesis of a thermally stable medium&#8208;pore aluminosilicate zeolite SCM&#8208;53, which possesses a 2D 10&#160;&#215; 10&#8208;ring channel system. The framework of SCM&#8208;53 was theoretically predicted by sigma expansion of the framework of SCM&#8208;51, a small&#8208;pore aluminosilicate zeolite featuring a 2D 8&#160;&#215; 8&#8208;ring channel system prepared by calcination of the layered precursor SCM&#8208;50. SCM&#8208;53 was rationally synthesized by successive interlayer silylation and calcination treatments of SCM&#8208;50. The structure of SCM&#8208;53 was validated by powder X&#8208;ray diffraction (PXRD), scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, and N2 absorption measurement. Our results demonstrate that SCM&#8208;53 possesses accessible micropores (5.9&#160;&#215; 4.9 &#197;), an ultrathin nanosheet morphology (&#8764;15&#160;nm), and high thermal stability (up to 800 &#176;C), suggesting its potential for adsorption and catalytic applications. We anticipate that sigma expansion offers a promising approach for the rational design and synthesis of targeted novel zeolite structures.

&lt;p&gt;Designing and synthesizing condensed, thermally stable zeolites by inverse sigma expansion of open-framework zeolites has been well achieved. However, creating thermally stable open-framework zeolites through sigma expansion of condensed-frameworks remains rare. Herein, we present the rational design and synthesis of a thermally stable medium-pore aluminosilicate zeolite SCM-53, which possesses a 2D 10&#160;&#215; 10-ring channel system. The framework of SCM-53 was theoretically predicted by sigma expansion of the framework of SCM-51, a small-pore aluminosilicate zeolite featuring a 2D 8&#160;&#215; 8-ring channel system prepared by calcination of the layered precursor SCM-50. SCM-53 was rationally synthesized by successive interlayer silylation and calcination treatments of SCM-50. The structure of SCM-53 was validated by powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD), scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, and N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; absorption measurement. Our results demonstrate that SCM-53 possesses accessible micropores (5.9&#160;&#215; 4.9 &#197;), an ultrathin nanosheet morphology (&#8764;15&#160;nm), and high thermal stability (up to 800 &#176;C), suggesting its potential for adsorption and catalytic applications.

         <title>Rectifying Contact&#8208;induced Electronic Regulation of Fe Within Nitrogen&#8208;doped Carbon for Enhanced Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The rectifying contact between Fe nanoparticles and N&#8208;doped 3D honeycomb&#8208;like carbon can induce a built&#8208;in electric field (BIEF) for optimizing charge redistribution of activity center, thereby endowing Fe&#8208;NPs@N&#8208;HC with excellent oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity in alkaline medium and zinc air battery performance.








ABSTRACT
Developing efficient and durable oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) electrocatalysts from earth&#8208;abundant elements is of great significance for the advancement of sustainable energy technologies such as rechargeable zinc&#8208;air batteries. Herein, we present a 3D honeycomb&#8208;like nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon matrix decorated to in&#8208;situ form Fe nanoparticles (denoted as Fe&#8208;NPs@N&#8208;HC) via an ice&#8208;templating method. Theoretical calculations and experimental analyses collectively reveal that the work function mismatch between metallic Fe and the N&#8208;doped carbon host drives spontaneous charge transfer, establishing a built&#8208;in electric field at the heterointerface to form the rectifying contact. This interfacial effect fine tunes electronic structure and optimizes the adsorption of oxygen intermediates, thereby accelerating the ORR kinetics. Benefiting from these synergistic effects, Fe&#8208;NPs@N&#8208;HC achieves a half&#8208;wave potential of 0.86&#160;V, superior tolerance to methanol, and excellent long&#8208;term durability in alkaline media. When integrated into a liquid zinc&#8208;air battery, Fe&#8208;NPs@N&#8208;HC also delivers a high peak power density of 126.4&#160;mW cm&#8722;2 and outstanding cycling stability exceeding 482 cycles, surpassing the benchmark Pt/C&#8208;based system. This work demonstrates that tailoring the electronic structure through interfacial engineering, coupled with rational 3D framework design, provides a promising strategy for the development of next&#8208;generation nonprecious metal catalysts for practical energy conversion applications.

         <title>Supramolecular Host&#8208;Guest Complexation Dynamics by Cost&#8208;Efficient Electronic Structure Methods</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present a cost&#8208;effective multilevel workflow for the kinetic profiling of host&#8211;guest systems, illustrated with cucurbit[6]uril and alkylammonium cations. The method combines rapid docking and reaction path searches at the semi&#8208;empirical level, with refinement of the results using modern density functional theory, accurately reproducing experiment and enabling routine analysis of supramolecular host&#8211;guest association mechanisms.








ABSTRACT
Multilevel computational approaches based on electronic structure methods currently enable the accurate structural and thermodynamic characterization of medium to large&#8208;sized host&#8211;guest systems, but have been scarcely used to systematically study their kinetics. Here, we show how this type of protocol can be easily applied for the task, using the well&#8208;known complexation reaction between the cucurbit[6]uril host and alkylammonium cations as a test case. To this end, the recently reported aISS docking workflow is used for the fast exploration of the coconformational space of a set of nine host&#8211;guest aggregates, at the robust and fast semiempirical GFN2&#8208;xTB(ALPB) level of theory. After identification of appropriate intermediates and reaction products, those can be in turn efficiently connected by the Nudged Elastic Band method, enabling fast screening of different potential reaction mechanisms, and the identification of the corresponding transition states. Further refinement of the equilibrium geometries and a better energetic description of the stationary points is nevertheless mandatory, for instance with the state of the art and efficient &#969;B97X&#8208;3c(COSMO&#8208;RS)//r2SCAN&#8208;3c(CPCM) density functional&#8208;based protocol, which not only accurately reproduces the experimental reference values of the free energy of association (MAE = 1.4&#160;kcal/mol), but also the kinetic in/out barriers reported for the processes (MAE = 2.0 and 2.9&#160;kcal/mol, respectively). Overall, this work presents a robust and cost&#8208;effective multilevel workflow for the routine kinetic profiling of supramolecular association processes.

         <title>Cobalt(II) Single&#8208;Chain Magnet with Strong Anisotropy and Ferromagnetic IntraChain Coupling</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new high&#8208;performance single&#8208;chain magnet (Ueff = 560 K) exhibits strong magnetic anisotropy and ferromagnetic intrachain interactions using redox&#8208;active bridging ligands.








ABSTRACT
Co(II)&#8208;based coordination polymer is reported as a new benchmark single&#8208;chain magnet (SCM), exhibiting an energy barrier (Ueff) of 560 K and a blocking temperature (TB) of 21.5 K&#8210;both the highest values observed for SCM systems. The magnetic behavior originates from the synergistic balance between strong axial anisotropy (DCo = &#8211;83 cm&#8722;1) and moderate ferromagnetic exchange (JCo&#8208;Co = +17.7 K), promoting long&#8208;range spin correlation over thousands of magnetic ions. Detailed analysis of the correlation length and domain&#8208;wall energy reveals a wide SCM regime and a 1D&#8208;to&#8208;3D magnetic crossover at low temperature. Unlike previously reported radical&#8208;bridged SCMs, this work demonstrates a clean, intrinsic design strategy for realizing extreme single&#8208;chain magnetism, offering new principles for developing robust molecular spin materials.

         <title>Covalent Organic Frameworks as Efficient Photocatalysts for Sustainable Ammonia Production</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
COFs are an emerging class of porous materials that exhibit excellent photocatalytic and electrocatalytic properties. Photocatalytic sustainable ammonia synthesis is a new research hotspot in the field of photocatalysis, holding significant importance for reducing global carbon emissions. New materials are being employed to address new challenges in emerging fields, demonstrating captivating characteristics. Perhaps, sustainable ammonia synthesis will become the most promising application direction in the coming years, with COFs serving as a key enabler in advancing this process.








ABSTRACT
Ammonia is one of the most important industrial products. The Haber&#8208;Bosch process has enabled large&#8208;scale ammonia production but also results in substantial carbon emissions. Amid growing environmental concerns, there is an urgent need to transform this highly energy&#8208;intensive process and develop ammonia synthesis technologies under mild conditions.

&lt;p&gt;COFs are an emerging class of porous materials that exhibit excellent photocatalytic and electrocatalytic properties. Photocatalytic sustainable ammonia synthesis is a new research hotspot in the field of photocatalysis, holding significant importance for reducing global carbon emissions. New materials are being employed to address new challenges in emerging fields, demonstrating captivating characteristics. Perhaps, sustainable ammonia synthesis will become the most promising application direction in the coming years, with COFs serving as a key enabler in advancing this process.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ammonia is one of the most important industrial products. The Haber-Bosch process has enabled large-scale ammonia production but also results in substantial carbon emissions. Amid growing environmental concerns, there is an urgent need to transform this highly energy-intensive process and develop ammonia synthesis technologies under mild conditions. Covalent organic frameworks (COFs), as one of the most prominent emerging materials in recent years, have demonstrated exceptional application potential and advantages in various fields such as photocatalysis and electrocatalysis. The modular structural design of COFs allows for tunable band gaps according to practical requirements, their permanent porosity endows the materials with excellent adsorption capabilities for reactants, and the abundant heteroatoms provide numerous reactive sites. Currently, COFs-based catalysts have achieved high performance in various photocatalytic applications, and sustainable ammonia synthesis is highly likely to become the next research focus. This review summarizes the fundamental principles of photocatalytic ammonia synthesis, methods for ammonia detection, and the research progress in COFs-based materials for ammonia synthesis. Finally, it analyzes and discusses the future challenges and prospects of this emerging field of sustainable ammonia synthesis using COFs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Helicene&#8208;Based Chiral Macrocycles and Molecular Cages: Synthetic Strategies, Chiroptical Modulation, and Emerging Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This minireview provides a concise overview of recent progress in the design and synthesis of helicene&#8208;based covalent and coordination macrocycles and cages, focusing on advances in synthetic strategies, modulation of chiroptical properties, and emerging opportunities in next&#8208;generation chiral technologies.








ABSTRACT
Macrocycles and molecular cages possess enzyme&#8208;like cavities whose size, shape, and functionality can be precisely engineered.&#160;Helicenes, characterized by rigid &#960;&#8208;conjugated backbones and inherent helical chirality, serve as exceptional scaffolds for constructing highly distorted chiral macrocycles and cages.&#160;These supramolecular architectures demonstrate enhanced circularly polarized luminescence (CPL), enantioselective recognition, and efficient guest adsorption.&#160;This minireview provides a comprehensive overview of recent advances in helicene&#8208;based coordination and covalent strategies, highlighting synthetic methodologies, chiroptical modulation, and emerging applications.&#160;Key challenges&#8212;including fluorescence quenching in metallacages, synthetic complexity, and limited structural diversity&#8212;are critically discussed. We also highlight potential opportunities involving high&#8208;emission linkages, dynamic covalent strategies, and stimuli&#8208;responsive designs.&#160;Collectively, these insights establish a framework for the rational design of helicene&#8208;derived macrocycles and three&#8208;dimensional cages, paving the way toward the development of advanced chiral functional materials.

         <title>Investigating N2 Fixation Using a Bulky Fe(bisphosphine)2 Framework</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The bulky Fe(0) N2 complex Fe(N2)(dibpe)2 has been prepared and efficiently produces NH3/N2H4 upon treatment with acid, similarly to previously investigated Fe(N2)(depe)2. However, it performs much less effectively during attempted catalytic N2 fixation, allowing investigation of the crucial role of steric hindrance in steps such as N2 binding and protonation.








ABSTRACT
An iron(0) dinitrogen complex incorporating highly sterically encumbered bisphosphine ligands, Fe(N2)(dibpe)2 (dibpe&#160;= iBu2PCH2CH2PiBu2), iBu1&#183;N2, has been prepared and thoroughly characterized, and its N2 fixation reactivity assessed. iBu1&#183;N2 is a more hindered analogue of Fe(N2)(depe)2 (depe&#160;= Et2PCH2CH2PEt2), Et1&#183;N2, which has previously been shown to be an efficient N2 reduction catalyst with unusual selectivity for N2H4, and it was anticipated that greater bulk might make iBu1&#183;N2 less prone to deleterious side reactivity, improving performance. The N2 ligand in iBu1&#183;N2 displays a similar degree of activation to Et1&#183;N2, and the two complexes can stoichiometrically fix N2 with similarly high efficiency upon treatment with suitable acids, giving mixtures of NH3 and N2H4. However, attempts to catalytically fix N2 via treatment of iBu1&#183;N2 with mixtures of excess acids and reductants led to poor results. Mechanistic investigations implicate a combination of more sluggish reaction kinetics and weaker binding of N2 to the intermediate Fe(I) cation [Fe(dibpe)2]+, [iBu1]+, whose study was aided by isolation as its BArF4&#8722; salt (ArF&#160;= 3,5&#8208;bis(trifluoromethyl)phenyl), and which has also been fully characterized. This weak interaction hinders regeneration of the initial iBu1&#183;N2 via reduction of [iBu1&#183;N2]+, which appears to be necessary to close the catalytic cycle.

         <title>Evaluation of a New Methylimidazole&#8208;Containing Thiosemicarbazone as a Cu+/Cu2+&#8208;Targeting Ligand in the Context of Alzheimer's Disease</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>

HXE modulates Cu(A&#946;) interaction, reducing ROS production and shifting peptide aggregation in the presence of Cu from toxic amorphous aggregates to less harmful fibrillar structures. These findings highlight HXE potential to interfere with Cu&#8208;induced oxidative stress and aggregation pathways relevant to AD.








ABSTRACT
The binding of copper ions to amyloid&#8208;&#946; (A&#946;) peptide leads to reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation and toxic soluble oligomers, contributing to oxidative stress in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Thus, studying compounds with moderate copper affinity is a promising strategy to prevent its interaction with A&#946; and reduce toxicity. Here, we evaluated a new tri&#8208;coordinating thiosemicarbazone (HXE) with chelating properties to regulate cuprotoxicity in AD. The ligand was nontoxic against HT&#8208;22 hippocampal neuronal cells and bound Cu+ and Cu2+ at pH 7.4, with affinity constants (log Kcond) of 8.7 and 12.3, respectively, showing high selectivity over Zn2+ (log Kapp = 5.0). In the presence of A&#946; and Cu2+, HXE formed stable ternary complexes at physiological pH. Ascorbate consumption and coumarin&#8208;3&#8208;carboxylic acid fluorescence assays showed that the ligand significantly reduces Cu(A&#946;16)&#8208;mediated ROS production. It also prevented Cu2+&#8208;induced modulation of A&#946;40 self&#8208;assembly and restored the typical fibrillar structure of apo&#8208;A&#946;40 aggregates. Overall, HXE effectively modulates metal&#8208;associated A&#946; toxicity and emerges as a promising candidate for AD bioinorganic management.

         <title>Titanium&#8208;Catalyzed Intermolecular Hydrothiomethylation of Alkenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hermetically sealable, inexpensive 42&#8208;well aluminum reactor blocks are used to explore new reactivities of air&#8208; and moisture&#8208;sensitive titanium catalysts. As a result, methyl sulfides undergo efficient &#945;&#8208;alkylation with alkenes in the presence of a titanium catalyst precursor, a formamidinato ligand, and a Lewis acid, yielding branched hydrothiomethylation products with excellent regioselectivity. Graphical design by Melissa Schl&#252;schen.








ABSTRACT
A catalyst screening for six different &#945;&#8208;alkylation reactions of methyl sulfides with unsaturated substrates performed in hermetically sealable and inexpensive 42&#8208;well aluminum reactor blocks is described. As a result, a new titanium&#8208;catalyzed hydrothiomethylation reaction of alkenes, which takes place under C&#9472;H bond activation at the &#945;&#8208;carbon atom of simple methyl sulfides, is presented. The best catalyst is prepared in situ from the readily available titanium catalyst precursor Ti(CH2SiMe3)4, a formamidinato ligand precursor, and the Lewis acid [Ph3C][B(C6F5)4]. Although selected 1,2&#8208;disubstituted alkenes, for example, cyclohexene and cyclopentene, undergo successful hydrothiomethylation reactions, the best results are obtained with monosubstituted 1&#8208;alkenes. In these cases, the reactions take place with excellent regioselectivity and give branched hydrothiomethylation products exclusively (23 examples). When dimethyl sulfide is used as a substrate, either the monohydrothiomethylation product or the dihydrothiomethylation product can be obtained with very good selectivity.

         <title>Acridane[4]Arenes: Scope of the Macro&#8208;Tetramerization, Derivatization Options, and Water&#8208;Soluble Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Acridane[4]arenes (A4As) are introduced as a versatile, conformationally restricted macrocyclic platform accessible in six steps and good yields. Expanded lower&#8208;rim scope, selective upper&#8208;rim functionalization, and N&#8208;Boc modification enable controlled self&#8208;assembly into a dimeric cage that binds tetrabutylammonium salts. Further Buchwald&#8211;Hartwig diversification and ionic substituents afford water&#8208;soluble derivatives, establishing A4As as a broadly modular scaffold for supramolecular applications.








ABSTRACT
Macrocycles are essential scaffolds in supramolecular chemistry, offering versatile platforms for functionalization. Here, we report the optimization, expanded scope, and comprehensive derivatization strategies for acridane[4]arenes (A4A), a large macrocyclic platform featuring a conformationally restricted bowl shape analogous to resorcin[4]arene. The scope of the macrocyclization was expanded with four distinct &#8216;feet&#8217; substituents at the lower rim. Strategies for selective functionalization at the upper rim were developed, including&#160;N&#8208;Boc protection at each acridane subunit. This modification induced self&#8208;assembly into a dimeric cage in apolar solvents, which form stable host&#8211;guest complexes with tetrabutylammonium salts. Further functionalization of the acridane nitrogen via Buchwald&#8211;Hartwig cross&#8208;coupling allowed installation of aromatic groups bearing diverse functional handles. Finally, water&#8208;soluble A4A derivatives were achieved by introducing charged ionic &#8216;feet&#8217; substituents, such as 1&#8208;methylimidazolium. These results establish A4As as a highly modular macrocyclic platform with broad potential for supramolecular applications.

         <title>A BODIPY/Coumarin Hybrid Probe for Dual&#8208;Mode Fluorescent/FLIM Imaging of Endoplasmic Reticulum Micro&#8208;Polarity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We designed an ER&#8208;targeted probe&#160;MBDP&#160;via hybridizing coumarin and BODIPY fluorophores, by introducing a benzene to reduce dihedral angles and a methyl group to inhibit intramolecular rotation, enabling specific polarity response. It has a broad linear response and strong anti&#8208;interference, quantifies ER micro&#8208;polarity via dual&#8208;channel and lambda mode imaging, captures ER micro&#8208;polarity changes under stress and hippocampal regional differences, and its notable lifetime variations with micro&#8208;polarity changes endow MBDP with FLIM capability.








ABSTRACT
Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) micro&#8208;polarity, with its spatial heterogeneity and dynamic changes, regulates key physiological processes like protein folding and lipid metabolism. Its abnormal alterations under pathological conditions, such as oxidative stress are closely linked to metabolic diseases and tumors. Capturing these subtle dynamics to reveal connections with organelle dysfunction remains a critical challenge. Existing traditional physical approaches are complex and cannot achieve real&#8208;time spatial imaging. Fluorescent probes for polarity sensing could provide spatiotemporal resolution, nevertheless, suffer from unstable signals due to nonfixed dual channels, narrow response ranges, interference from viscosity, and nonlinear responses, hindering quantitative monitoring. We designed an ER&#8208;targeted probe MBDP via hybridizing coumarin and BODIPY fluorophores, by introducing a benzene to reduce dihedral angles and a methyl group to inhibit intramolecular rotation, enabling specific polarity response. It shows a broad linear response, strong anti&#8208;interference ability, which quantifies ER micro&#8208;polarity via dual&#8208;channel and lambda mode imaging. It captures ER micro&#8208;polarity changes under stress and hippocampal regional differences. Moreover, the remarkable lifetime variations upon polarity change endow MBDP capability under fluorescence lifetime imaging microscope (FLIM). This probe provides a powerful tool with ratiometric imaging and FLIM dual&#8208;modal monitoring for ER micro&#8208;polarity, aiding in revealing ER&#8208;related physiological/pathological mechanisms and disease research.

Syntheses and base pairing properties of halogenated hypoxanthine nucleosides with 8&#8208;aza&#8208;7&#8208;deazapurine skeleton (dI*) are reported. Single X&#8208;ray analyses disclosed unit cells connected by a wobble base pair and consisting of two conformers in high&#8208;anti conformation with N&#8208;type or E&#8208;type sugar puckering. For single incorporations, duplex stability followed the order dI*&#8208;dC = dI*&#8208;dA &gt; dI*&#8208;dT &gt; dI*&#8208;dG. Consecutive incorporations of halogenated dI*&#8208;dC, dI*&#8208;dG, and dI*&#8208;dA base pairs gave stable duplexes, whereas hybridization of dI* with dT failed.








ABSTRACT
Syntheses and base pairing properties of halogenated and nonhalogenated hypoxanthine nucleosides with 8&#8208;aza&#8208;7&#8208;deazapurine skeleton (dI*) are reported. Modified hypoxanthine nucleosides were accessed from 6&#8208;alkoxy precursors. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray analyses disclosed unit cells consisting of two conformers adopting high&#8208;anti conformation around the glycosylic bond with N&#8208;type C3&#8217;&#8208;endo (3T2) or E&#8208;type, O4&#8217;&#8208;endo (0E) sugar puckering. Crystal packing is stabilized by inosine/inosine wobble base pairs as well as intermolecular and intramolecular hydrogen bonds. Hirshfeld surface analyses confirmed these findings. Halogenated and nonhalogenated dI* nucleosides were converted to phosphoramidites and applied to solid&#8208;phase oligonucleotide synthesis. Single and consecutive incorporations were accomplished and Watson&#8211;Crick and purine&#8211;purine base pairing was investigated. Single incorporations opposite to canonical nucleosides afforded stable duplexes in all cases. Tm values revealed the following order of stability dI*&#8208;dC = dI*&#8208;dA &gt; dI*&#8208;dT &gt; dI*&#8208;dG. Consecutive incorporations furnished more distinguished results. Double helices with halogenated dI*&#8208;dC base pairs were the most stable ones, whereas hybridization for dI* opposite to dT was hindered. Halogenated dI*&#8208;dG and dI*&#8208;dA purine&#8208;purine base pairs gave stable duplexes, whereas hybridization of nonhalogenated dI*&#8208;dA pairs failed. From CD spectra, helical changes for duplexes with three dI*&#8208;dG purine&#8208;purine base pairs were detected. All other duplexes showed the typical shape of a B&#8208;DNA.

         <title>Synthesis and Isolation of Bismuth Scorpionate Complexes: Toward Bond Activation via Bismuth&#8208;Ligand Cooperation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
ABSTRACT
Over the past twenty years, main group chemistry has significantly expanded its scope to include reactivities once considered the exclusive domain of transition metals. Among the emerging concepts, element&#8208;ligand cooperation has proven to be a powerful strategy for enabling bond activation reactions but remains relatively unexplored for heavier group 15 elements. In this study, we present a novel class of ylide ligands incorporating additional amino donor sites, specifically designed to promote bismuth&#8208;ligand cooperativity. We successfully isolated a series of well&#8208;defined bismuth scorpionate complexes supported by these dianionic N,Cylide,N ligands, each bearing different substituents at the ylide moiety. These variations modulate the degree of negative charge stabilization, thereby tuning the extent of electron donation to the bismuth center. Halide abstraction generated cationic bismuth complexes, which exhibited enhanced ligand&#8208;to&#8208;bismuth electron donation, resulting in low Lewis acidities and reduced reactivity. In contrast, deprotonation of the ylide ligand bearing an electron&#8208;withdrawing ArF substituent enabled the synthesis and NMR characterization of a rare bismuth yldiide complex. This yldiide underwent a [2 + 2] addition with a carbodiimide across the formal Bi = C double bond, demonstrating that bismuth yldiides can engage in bond activation through bismuth&#8208;ligand cooperativity.

&lt;h2&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the past twenty years, main group chemistry has significantly expanded its scope to include reactivities once considered the exclusive domain of transition metals. Among the emerging concepts, element-ligand cooperation has proven to be a powerful strategy for enabling bond activation reactions but remains relatively unexplored for heavier group 15 elements. In this study, we present a novel class of ylide ligands incorporating additional amino donor sites, specifically designed to promote bismuth-ligand cooperativity. We successfully isolated a series of well-defined bismuth scorpionate complexes supported by these dianionic &lt;i&gt;N,C&lt;sub&gt;ylide&lt;/sub&gt;,N&lt;/i&gt; ligands, each bearing different substituents at the ylide moiety. These variations modulate the degree of negative charge stabilization, thereby tuning the extent of electron donation to the bismuth center. Halide abstraction generated cationic bismuth complexes, which exhibited enhanced ligand-to-bismuth electron donation, resulting in low Lewis acidities and reduced reactivity. In contrast, deprotonation of the ylide ligand bearing an electron-withdrawing Ar&lt;sup&gt;F&lt;/sup&gt; substituent enabled the synthesis and NMR characterization of a rare bismuth yldiide complex. This yldiide underwent a [2 + 2] addition with a carbodiimide across the formal Bi = C double bond, demonstrating that bismuth yldiides can engage in bond activation through bismuth-ligand cooperativity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Effective and Selective Hydrogenation of Methyl Acrylate to Methyl Propionate on Single&#8208;Atom Nickel Catalyst</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
Development of highly efficient, selective, and stable single&#8208;atom catalyst (SAC) is an important research hotspot in the field of hydrogenation, due to the atomic utilization of active component. In this study, an effective single&#8208;atom nickel catalyst with a specific coordination structure of Ni&#9472;N4 was constructed using Ni&#8208;containing ZIF&#8208;8 as precursor for efficient hydrogenation of methyl acrylate to methyl propionate in the fixed&#8208;bed reactor. Multiple characterization techniques including HAADF&#8208;STEM, H2&#8208;TPR, XRD, and XAFS were utilized to systematically analyze the structure and physicochemical properties of as&#8208;prepared catalyst series. The effects of catalyst preparation and hydrogenation conditions on the catalytic performance were evaluated and further optimized. As a result, the turn of frequency (TOF) could reach up to 200.8 h&#8722;1 for methyl propionate production, with catalytic selectivity of 100%. In situ IR experiments were performed to monitor the hydrogenation mechanism on the catalyst surface, as well as kinetic studies for confirmation of reaction order and activation barrier. This study will provide a new strategy for the design and of non&#8208;noble metal SAC for the hydrogenation of methyl acrylate.

         <title>Light&#8208;controlled 1D to 2D 2,3&#8208;Diaminophenazine Self&#8208;assembly Transformation on Cu(111) Surface</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel on&#8208;surface transformation from 1D to 2D self&#8208;assembly is achieved. This work demonstrates the feasibility of a series of reactions that are conventionally thermally prohibited due to their entropy&#8208;driven amorphization tendency. The specific stimuli&#8208;selective pathway enables precise molecular control in the field of self&#8208;assembly.








Abstract
Controlled molecular self&#8208;assembly enables precise engineering of nanomaterials with programmable dimensionality and functionality. Conventional thermal&#8208;driven approaches, however, often struggle to achieve structural complexity due to weak intermolecular interactions and entropy&#8208;driven disorder at elevated temperatures. Here, we introduce a light&#8208;controlled methodology to realize a dimensionality transformation of carbon nitride&#8208;based architectures on a Cu(111) surface, bypassing the limitations of thermal processing. By applying ultraviolet (UV) light irradiation, we achieve the controlled conversion of 1D self&#8208;assembled nanoribbons of 2,3&#8208;diaminophenazine (DAP), a carbon nitride precursor, into ordered 2D extended frameworks. This light&#8208;driven 1D&#8208;to&#8208;2D structural evolution starkly contrasts with thermal treatments, which exclusively produce disordered aggregates under comparable conditions. Remarkably, this transformation proceeds without requiring light&#8208;reactive chemicals, underscoring the unique capability of UV light to direct molecular reorganization at interfaces. The work establishes a paradigm for manipulating nanoscale dimensionality in carbon nitride systems, circumventing conventional entropy limitations and offering a versatile platform for designing advanced 2D functional materials with applications in photocatalysis, nanoelectronics, and surface&#8208;supported molecular engineering.

         <title>Eco&#8208;Friendly Synthesis of Cobalt Phthalocyanine for High&#8208;Efficiency CO2${\rm CO}_{2}$ Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A sustainable synthesis of cobalt phthalocyanine (CoPc) using low&#8208;impact solvents yields high&#8208;performance electrocatalysts with reduced waste (E&#8208;factor 18.6). When integrated into gas diffusion electrodes, CoPc achieves up to 12% Faradays efficiency for CO2&#8208;to&#8208;methanol and 65% CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion, aligning with state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art materials and enabling greener CO2 reduction (CO2RR).








ABSTRACT
We report a sustainable and cost&#8208;effective synthesis of cobalt phthalocyanine (CoPc) using low&#8208;impact solvents and a streamlined purification procedure, achieving an 85% yield with limited waste generation, as indicated by an environmental factor (E&#8208;factor) of 18.6. This route provides an eco&#8208;friendly approach to producing a molecular electrocatalyst for CO2${\rm CO}_{2}$ reduction. The catalytic activity of the synthesized CoPc is validated by its integration into a gas diffusion electrode with carbon nanotube supports, exhibiting methanol production with a Faradaic efficiency up to 12%, matching the values reached with the conventionally synthesized counterparts. Notably, under high loading (micrometric crystallites of CoPc), CO2${\rm CO}_{2}$&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion reached 65%, in fair alignment with literature benchmarks. Our work shows that green synthesis can yield high&#8208;performance catalysts for CO2${\rm CO}_{2}$ electrochemical reduction (CO2RR${\rm CO}_{2}{\rm RR}$), enabling sustainable methanol&#160;production.

         <title>Azulene in a Bowl: A Nonalternant Buckybowl With 5/7 Topology, Azulene&#8208;Derived Properties, and Fullerene Complexation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first azulene&#8208;based buckybowl with a distinctive 5/7 ring topology has been synthesized and thoroughly characterized, demonstrating the ability to assemble with fullerene C60 or C70. The incorporation of the nonalternant azulene unit endows this novel buckybowl with unique electronic and photophysical properties, including a narrow HOMO&#8208;LUMO gap, red&#8208;shifted UV&#8208;vis absorption, anti&#8208;Kasha emission, and reversible proton&#8208;responsive behavior.








ABSTRACT
Despite the intriguing potential of azulene&#8208;embedded nanocarbons, their integration into curved buckybowl architectures has remained unexplored due to synthetic and stability challenges. Herein, we report an azulene&#8208;containing buckybowl 6, synthesized via a concise four&#8208;step route where the azulene core remains stable without rearrangement to naphthalene. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray analysis revealed that 6 adopts a nonalternant, bowl&#8208;shaped geometric configuration. Unlike classical buckybowls (e.g., corannulene, dibenzo[a,g]corannulene, and summane), 6 exhibits distinct azulene&#8208;derived properties: red&#8208;shifted UV&#8208;vis absorption, anti&#8208;Kasha photoluminescence, and reversible proton&#8208;responsive behavior. Theoretical studies reveal unique aromaticity in its central pentagon, diverging from known pentagon&#8208;containing buckybowls. Furthermore, it was found that buckybowl 6 can assemble with fullerene C60 or C70 in a 1:1 stoichiometry. This work establishes 6 as the unique azulene&#8208;based buckybowl and pioneers a design strategy for nonalternant, positively curved &#960;&#8208;systems with 5/7 ring topologies and tunable optoelectronic properties.

         <title>Carbon and Heteroatom Activation via N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene&#8208;Bound Dearomative Intermediates for Stereoselective Annulation Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 66, November 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Use of N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) to activate carbon and heteroatoms in aromatic compounds is reviewed based on key dearomative NHC&#8208;bound intermediates, i.e., ortho&#8208;quinodimethanes (o&#8208;QDMs), ortho&#8208;quinone methides (o&#8208;QMs) and aza&#8208;analogs (aza&#8208;o&#8208;QMs), aza&#8208;fulvene and triaza&#8208;diene intermediates. Their formation and reactivity in stereoselective annulation reactions for the synthesis of enantioenriched (hetero)cyclic molecules are discussed.








Abstract
N&#8208;Heterocyclic carbene (NHC) organocatalysis has long been recognized as a powerful and versatile method for the implementation of (asymmetric) transformations enabling the formation of C&#9472;C and C&#8211;heteroatom bonds. A number of NHC&#8208;bound active ionic species have been classically established for activation of carbon atoms as either nucleophiles or electrophiles at diverse positions, such as (aza)Breslow intermediates, homoenolate equivalents, azolium (di)enolates, simple acyl (imidoyl) azoliums, and &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated/alkynyl acyl azoliums. Within this realm, the past decade has witnessed a blossoming interest in the deployment of NHC&#8208;tethered dearomative intermediates for the activation of both carbon atoms and heteroatoms in aromatic compounds. Accordingly, functionalization of benzylic carbon atoms was made possible through catalyst&#8208;bound o&#8208;quinodimethanes (o&#8208;QDMs), while remote activation of oxygen and nitrogen atoms was effectively achieved through NHC&#8208;bound o&#8208;quinone methides (o&#8208;QMs) and aza&#8208;analogs (aza&#8208;o&#8208;QMs), along with aza&#8208;fulvene type intermediates and triaza&#8208;diene species. Aim of this review is to provide an overview of the most relevant literature on the development of NHC&#8208;bound dearomative intermediates for carbon and heteroatom activation since 2013, with emphasis on their applications for stereoselective annulation reactions.

         <title>Effects of Isomorphous Substitution on Photophysical and Magnetic Properties of Complexes [Ln1&#8208;xDyx(MeDPQ)2Cl3] (Ln&#160;=&#160;Y3+, Ho3+, and Er3+)</title>

         <dc:description>
We present the research on the coordination compounds [Ln(MeDPQ)2Cl3] with Dy3+, Ho3+, and Er3+ ions and the solid solutions [Ln1&#8208;xDyx(MeDPQ)2Cl3] based on them. The investigated materials exhibited multifunctionality: they absorb light in the UV, visible, and NIR range; emit in the visible and NIR range; demonstrate weak magnetic interactions; and possess exceptional thermal stability.








Abstract
This work encompasses the study of magnetic, optical, and structural properties of the coordination compounds [Ln(MeDPQ)2Cl3] (Ln &#9472; Ho3+, Er3+, Dy3+, and Y3+; MeDPQ &#8722; 2&#8208;methyldipyrido&#8208;[3,2&#8208;f:2&#8242;,3&#8242;&#8208;h]&#8208;quinoxaline) and substituted complexes [Ln1&#8208;xDyx(MeDPQ)2Cl3] (Ln&#160;=&#160;Ho3+, Er3+, and Y3+) based on them. Magnetic measurements within the range 5&#8211;300&#160;K revealed single ion anisotropy in [Dy(MeDPQ)2Cl3], with the Curie&#8208;Weiss temperature &#952; being &#8722;3.69&#160;&#177;&#160;0.03&#160;K. Complexes of Ho3+ and Er3+ exhibited f&#8211;f emission in the visible range, while the latter was also emissive in the NIR. Dilution of the Dy3+ complex with diamagnetic Y3+ ions resulted in alterations of magnetic and photophysical properties. The substituted complexes Y0.5Dy0.5 and Y0.9Dy0.1 demonstrated paramagnetic behavior, with &#952; being 3.06&#160;&#177;&#160;0.12&#160;K and 9.64&#160;&#177;&#160;0.23&#160;K, respectively. In both cases, the emission decay times of Dy3+ changed insignificantly, 21.02&#160;&#177;&#160;0.41 &#181;s and 14.56&#160;&#177;&#160;0.22 &#181;s, respectively, compared to the value (18.92&#160;&#177;&#160;0.03 &#181;s) of the individual Dy3+ complex. Additional ligand&#8208;based emission bands were observed in the Ho3+ and Er3+ complexes at room temperature and 77&#160;K and in the substituted complexes Ho0.5Dy0.5 and Er0.5Dy0.5 at room temperature, which were assigned to the exciplex states. The thermal stability of [Er0.5Dy0.5(MeDPQ)2Cl3] was determined to be the same as for the individual complexes, starting to oxidize at 410&#176;C.

Find the path! The present paper points out the potentialities of chemometrics tools to design selective BF3&#183;OEt2 catalyzed procedures for the preparation of &#916;&#8313;&#8208;THC, &#916;&#8312;&#8208;THC, &#916;&#8312;&#8208;iso&#8208;THC, &#916;&#8308;&#8208;iso&#8208;THC, &#916;&#8308;(&#8312;)&#8208;iso&#8208;THC, by simply tuning the initial concentration of CBD, the amount of the Lewis acid, the reaction time as well as the nature of the solvent employed.








Abstract
The acid&#8208;catalyzed conversion of cannabidiol (CBD) to tetrahydrocannabinol and iso&#8208;tetrahydrocannabinol derivatives is a well&#8208;established synthetic strategy. However, since the reaction outcome is strongly dependent on the conditions, a careful investigation is always required to achieve the optimal chemoselectivity. Chemometrics recently emerged as an effective approach for improving synthetic methods, especially when multiple parameters are involved. The present paper aims to apply chemometrics tools to the optimization of the procedures for the preparation of &#916;&#8313;&#8208;THC, &#916;&#8312;&#8208;THC, &#916;&#8312;&#8208;iso&#8208;THC, &#916;&#8308;&#8208;iso&#8208;THC, and &#916;&#8308;(&#8312;)&#8208;iso&#8208;THC. All the reactions have been performed at room temperature by tuning the initial concentration of CBD, the equivalents of the model Lewis acid considered (BF3&#183;OEt2), the reaction time, and the nature of the media to achieve the desired products. The kinetics of the process, followed over the course of 1 to 48 hours, were analyzed by means of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to initially simplify the multidimensional dataset and help identify the best media for &#916;&#8313;&#8208;THC and &#916;&#8312;&#8208;THC. In order to optimize the conditions needed for &#916;&#8308;&#8208;iso&#8208;THC, &#916;&#8308;(&#8312;)&#8208;iso&#8208;THC, and &#916;&#8312;&#8208;iso&#8208;THC, multiple Design of Experiment (DoE) were employed, leading to the successful isolation of the target compounds. During the investigation, cannabinoid derivatives incorporating a portion of the reaction medium were also identified.

The present paper points out the potentialities of chemometrics tools to design selective BF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&#183;OEt&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; catalyzed procedures for the preparation of &#916;&#8313;-THC, &#916;&#8312;-THC, &#916;&#8312;-&lt;i&gt;iso&lt;/i&gt;-THC, &#916;&#8308;-&lt;i&gt;iso&lt;/i&gt;-THC, &#916;&#8308;&lt;sup&gt;(&lt;/sup&gt;&#8312;&lt;sup&gt;)&lt;/sup&gt;-&lt;i&gt;iso&lt;/i&gt;-THC, by simply tuning the initial concentration of CBD, the amount of the Lewis acid, the reaction time as well as the nature of the solvent employed.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The acid-catalyzed conversion of cannabidiol (CBD) to tetrahydrocannabinol and iso-tetrahydrocannabinol derivatives is a well-established synthetic strategy. However, since the reaction outcome is strongly dependent on the conditions, a careful investigation is always required to achieve the optimal chemoselectivity. Chemometrics recently emerged as an effective approach for improving synthetic methods, especially when multiple parameters are involved. The present paper aims to apply chemometrics tools to the optimization of the procedures for the preparation of &#916;&#8313;-THC, &#916;&#8312;-THC, &#916;&#8312;-&lt;i&gt;iso&lt;/i&gt;-THC, &#916;&#8308;-&lt;i&gt;iso&lt;/i&gt;-THC, and &#916;&#8308;&lt;sup&gt;(&lt;/sup&gt;&#8312;&lt;sup&gt;)&lt;/sup&gt;-&lt;i&gt;iso&lt;/i&gt;-THC. All the reactions have been performed at room temperature by tuning the initial concentration of CBD, the equivalents of the model Lewis acid considered (BF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&#183;OEt&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), the reaction time, and the nature of the media to achieve the desired products. The kinetics of the process, followed over the course of 1 to 48 hours, were analyzed by means of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to initially simplify the multidimensional dataset and help identify the best media for &#916;&#8313;-THC and &#916;&#8312;-THC. In order to optimize the conditions needed for &#916;&#8308;-&lt;i&gt;iso&lt;/i&gt;-THC, &#916;&#8308;(&#8312;)-&lt;i&gt;iso&lt;/i&gt;-THC, and &#916;&#8312;-&lt;i&gt;iso&lt;/i&gt;-THC, multiple Design of Experiment (DoE) were employed, leading to the successful isolation of the target compounds. During the investigation, cannabinoid derivatives incorporating a portion of the reaction medium were also identified.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Steric Restraints in Redox&#8208;Active Guanidine Ligands and Their Impact on Coordination Chemistry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 66, November 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
One carbon makes the difference; a diguandine with an ethylene bridge does not coordinate metals, while a diguanidine with a propylene bridge coordinates to a variety of metals. In this work, we report the synthesis and coordination chemistry of the first cyclic diguanidino&#8208;benzene ligands and compare their coordination chemistry with that of open diguanidino&#8208;benzene ligands.








Abstract
The introduction of redox&#8208;active ligands into coordination compounds is attractive for a number of applications; intramolecular electron transfer between a redox&#8208;active ligand and a metal is the basis for applications in switchable devices and advanced redox catalysis for multielectron substrate activations. A fine&#8208;tuning of the properties of redox&#8208;active ligands focusses on the redox potential and frontier orbital energies, as well as the steric demand and coordination mode. In this work, we report the first synthesis of new o&#8208;diguanidino&#8208;benzene ligands in which the two guanidino groups are connected through an alkyl chain of different length. The introduction of an ethylene bridge between the two guanidino groups turns a strongly coordinating ligand into a noncoordinating molecule, while keeping its strong Br&#248;nsted basicity. These features qualify the ethylene&#8208;bridged compound as a powerful alternative to Huenig's base, diisopropyl&#8208;ethyl&#8208;amine. The change from an ethylene to a propylene bridge switches back on the coordination ability. It is also possible to introduce a methyl group to the central C atom of the propylene bridge without loss of nucleophilic properties. The analysis, based on a variety of metal complexes, identifies three structural parameters to assay the structural restraint. Macrocyclic tetraguanidines are also formed.

         <title>Substitution of CH3 by CH2F in 2&#8208;Methylerythritol Cyclodiphosphate Triggers Potent Inhibition of IspG with Concomitant Fluoride Ion Expulsion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 66, November 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The fluoromethyl analogue of MEcPP was identified as a very potent inhibitor of the oxygen&#8208;sensitive [4Fe&#8208;4S] metalloenzyme IspG. In the course of the IspG&#8208;catalyzed transformation, this novel compound undergoes fluoride elimination, offering additional evidence for the involvement of a carbanionic intermediate in the mechanism of this enzyme.








Abstract
IspG (also known as GcpE) is a key [4Fe&#8208;4S] metalloenzyme that catalyzes the penultimate step of the methylerythritol phosphate (MEP) pathway, a well&#8208;established target for the development of new antimicrobials. This oxygen&#8208;sensitive enzyme mediates the reductive dehydroxylation of 2&#8208;C&#8208;methyl&#8208;d&#8208;erythritol 2,4&#8208;cyclodiphosphate (MEcPP) to (E)&#8208;4&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;3&#8208;methylbut&#8208;2&#8208;en&#8208;1&#8208;yl diphosphate (HMBPP), requiring electron transfer proteins to deliver two electrons needed for catalysis. To probe the mechanism of IspG and access new mechanism&#8208;based inhibitors, we synthesized a substrate analogue, monofluoromethyl&#8208;d&#8208;erythritol cyclodiphosphate, in which the natural methyl group of MEcPP is replaced by a CH2F group. This analogue proved to be a potent inhibitor of IspG. This study also demonstrates that electron capture is a prerequisite for inhibition and that the inhibitor leads to fluoride release in the IspG&#8208;catalyzed reaction. Together, these results provide further support for the involvement of a carbanionic intermediate in the IspG mechanism.

         <title>Enantioselective Route to Terminal 2,3&#8208;Epoxy Tosylates Enabled by Cooperative Organocatalytic Desymmetrization of 2&#8208;Substituted Glycerol Derivatives</title>

A desymmetrization strategy from bis tosylated 2&#8208;substituted glycerols to challenging 2,2&#8208;disubstituted 2,3&#8208;epoxy tosylates has been developed using commercial L&#8208;diphenyl prolinol/(R,R)&#8208;TADDOL system or the enantiomeric catalytic couple. (R)&#8208; or (S)&#8208; epoxides are obtained in moderate to good yield and up to 76% ee. Useful elaborations to functionalized products and remarkably to privileged eight&#8208; and four&#8208;membered aza&#8208;heterocycles, were demonstrated.








Abstract
A first enantioselective synthesis of challenging 2,2&#8208;disubstituted 2,3&#8208;epoxy tosylates has been developed via an organocatalytic desymmetrization reaction of bis tosylated 2&#8208;substituted glycerols. The intramolecular nucleophilic substitution has been cooperatively catalyzed by commercially available mixtures of L&#8208;diphenyl prolinol and (R,R)&#8208;&#945;,&#945;,&#945;&#8217;,&#945;&#8217;&#8208;tetraphenyl&#8208;2,2 disubstituted 1,3&#8208;dioxolane&#8208;4,5&#8208;dimethanol (TADDOL) or the enantiomeric couple, leading to (R)&#8208; and (S)&#8208;epoxides in up to 87% yield and 76% ee. Reaction monitoring highlighted the double role of leaving group and nucleophile played by the p&#8208;toluensulfonate anion, which was found to be responsible of epoxide ring&#8208;opening back to the reagent. The latter process affects the conversion to the epoxide, but marginally the enantioselectivity. These uncommon epoxides, bearing a quaternary stereocenter, demonstrated to be versatile intermediates to prepare functionalized products and remarkably, privileged eight&#8208; and four&#8208; membered N&#8208;heterocycles.

         <title>Effects of Peripheral Substituents on the Optical and Electrochemical Properties of Dibenzo&#8208;5,10,15&#8208;triazaporphyrins</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 66, November 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
New derivatives of dibenzo&#8208;5,10,15&#8208;triazaporphyrin (DBTriAP) with substituents on the meso and/or &#946;&#8208;pyrrolic carbons were prepared, and their optical and electrochemical properties were revealed. The peripheral substituents were found to exert significant impacts on the fluorescence property and aggregation behavior of the DBTriAP chromophore in solution.








Abstract
In contrast to the great advances of phthalocyanine&#8208;based materials, the potential of 5,10,15&#8208;triazaporphyrins has not been realized because of the lack of fundamental information about their structure&#8208;property relationships. Here, we report new derivatives of dibenzo&#8208;5,10,15&#8208;triazaporphyrin (DBTriAP) with aryl or alkyl substituents at the meso and/or &#946; positions. Freebases of DBTriAP were prepared by the condensation of two types of 1,9&#8208;dibromodipyrrins with 1,3&#8208;diiminoisoindoline and subsequent functionalization of the &#946;&#8208;pyrrolic carbons. Zinc(II) complexes of DBTriAP were obtained by complexation of the corresponding freebases with zinc(II) acetate.

     alt="Effects of Peripheral Substituents on the Optical and Electrochemical Properties of Dibenzo-5,10,15-triazaporphyrins"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New derivatives of dibenzo-5,10,15-triazaporphyrin (DBTriAP) with substituents on the &lt;i&gt;meso&lt;/i&gt; and/or &#946;-pyrrolic carbons were prepared, and their optical and electrochemical properties were revealed. The peripheral substituents were found to exert significant impacts on the fluorescence property and aggregation behavior of the DBTriAP chromophore in solution.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In contrast to the great advances of phthalocyanine-based materials, the potential of 5,10,15-triazaporphyrins has not been realized because of the lack of fundamental information about their structure-property relationships. Here, we report new derivatives of dibenzo-5,10,15-triazaporphyrin (DBTriAP) with aryl or alkyl substituents at the &lt;i&gt;meso&lt;/i&gt; and/or &#946; positions. Freebases of DBTriAP were prepared by the condensation of two types of 1,9-dibromodipyrrins with 1,3-diiminoisoindoline and subsequent functionalization of the &#946;-pyrrolic carbons. Zinc(II) complexes of DBTriAP were obtained by complexation of the corresponding freebases with zinc(II) acetate. The optical and electrochemical properties of the DBTriAP derivatives were studied by steady-state and transient ultraviolet/visible absorption/emission spectroscopy, magnetic circular dichroism spectroscopy, cyclic voltammetry (CV), and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Replacing the &#946;-pyrrolic hydrogens of the 5-mesityl-DBTriAP derivatives with aryl groups resulted in substantial red shifts of the low-energy absorption band because of the effective &#960;-delocalization and/or charge-transfer interaction with the DBTriAP chromophore. The 2,3,17,18-tetraethyl-DBTriAP freebase exhibited split redox processes in its cyclic voltammogram, suggesting the rapid formation of a &#960;-stacked dimer radical cation facilitated by the highly planar structure. Most of the DBTriAP derivatives emitted red fluorescence with quantum yields of 0.07&#8211;0.31, indicating their potential as luminescent materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Advancing Bidirectional Photoswitching of Norbornadienes: Exclusively Light&#8208;Induced Interconversion of Imide&#8208; and Ortho&#8208;Connected Norbornadiene&#8208;Perylene Diimide Hybrids</title>

Bidirectional Photoswitching: We report norbornadiene&#8208;perylene diimide (NBD&#8208;PDI) dyads with diverse connectivities, enabling exclusively photoinduced NBD/QC switching. Our findings reveal high conversion yields in both directions, paired with good thermal&#8208; and photo&#8208;stability. Rapid back&#8208;isomerization to NBD occurs upon visible light irradiation, highlighting the potential for on&#8208;demand energy release in energy storage applications.








Abstract
The norbornadiene/quadricyclane (NBD/QC) photoswitch is a promising candidate for molecular solar energy storage. Isomerization to the energy&#8208;storing, metastable QC occurs upon UV light irradiation, while the back&#8208;switching can be triggered in various ways. However, inducing complete, on&#8208;demand energy release across multiple switching cycles remains a significant challenge in molecular solar thermal (MOST) research. We demonstrate the implementation of perylene diimide (PDI) as covalently connected, photoactive redox&#8208;catalyst to enable NBD regeneration upon 475&#160;nm irradiation. We investigated the NBD/QC interconversion of several imide&#8208; and ortho&#8208;connected NBD&#8208;PDI hybrids upon irradiation at 310&#160;nm and 475&#160;nm, revealing that the connection position on PDI only minimally affects the interconversion efficiency. Concentration&#8208;dependent studies identified an alternative intermolecular back&#8208;isomerization mechanism in addition to the previously known intramolecular pathway, for which adequate flexibility of the linker proved crucial for effective back&#8208;isomerization to NBD. This study advances the exclusively photoinduced isomerization of the NBD/QC system within novel NBD&#8208;PDI dyads, establishing a framework for the targeted manipulation of NBD hybrids with potential application in energy storage. The presented switches operate independently, without the need for further additives to facilitate interconversion, which renders them promising candidates for molecular solar energy storage research.

         <title>Reversible and Massive Structural Transformation in Meltable Cyanido&#8208;bridged Coordination Polymer Crystals</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 66, November 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Melting crystals containing separated domains of KCd[Cu(CN)2]3 and K2Cu3(CN)5 were obtained via simple dehydration of K2Cd(H2O)Cu4(CN)8&#183;1.5H2O. Their low melting point of 559&#160;K resulted from the combined effects of strong crystal&#8208;interface interactions and low&#8208;coordinate Cu nodes.








Abstract
Cyanido (CN&#8722;)&#8208;bridged coordination polymers (CP) have been extensively studied as molecular&#8208;based functional materials. However, synthesizing 3D compounds composed only of metal ions and CN&#8722;&#8212;without bulky organic groups&#8212;and that melt before decomposing remains a considerable challenge. This difficulty arises because CN&#8722; strongly interconnect metal ions, forming rigid, dense frameworks with high melting points. In this study, we successfully synthesized a melting composite consisting of 3D KCd[Cu(CN)2]3 and 2D K2Cu3(CN)5 by dehydrating K2Cd(H2O)Cu4(CN)8&#183;1.5H2O. Remarkably, nanodomains of these two compounds coexisted within single particles, allowing their crystal structures to be independently determined by 3D electron diffraction (MicroED) of the resulting powders. Each compound melted at its respective melting point, around 559&#160;K. Notably, the melting point of KCd[Cu(CN)2]3 is unusually low for a 3D dense coordination framework. This atypically low melting point results from a combination of crystalline surface effects, and the entropy contribution of the dynamic, labile two&#8208;coordinate Cu centers in the framework. Additionally, we demonstrated a reversible transformation between the dehydrated mixture and the hydrated parent compound through exposure to water vapor, highlighting the dynamic and responsive nature of these CN&#8722;&#8208;based solid&#8208;state materials.

         <title>London Dispersion versus Intramolecular Hydrogen Bond in Bis&#8208;Pyridines: How Accurate Is DFT for Competing Noncovalent Interactions in the Condensed Phase?</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 66, November 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A test system of 14 singly protonated bis&#8209;pyridine salts, with varying H&#8209;bonded and London dispersion interactions, was designed to systematically study non&#8209;covalent interactions across the gas, solution, and solid phases. A good correlation between the 1H chemical shift and the N&#8208;H&#8211;N angle from the crystal structures was established. We observed systematic discrepancies in the treatment of these interactions by DFT&#8209;D3/D4 across the phases.








Abstract
We report a systematic investigation of noncovalent interactions&#8212;particularly an intramolecular hydrogen bond and London Dispersion forces&#8212;in singly protonated bis&#8208;pyridines, studied across solution and crystalline states. Building on our previous gas&#8208;phase study, we combine variable&#8208;temperature 1H NMR spectroscopy, single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The measured 1H NMR chemical shifts of the acidic proton serve as a solution&#8208;phase structural readout, which we correlate with an independent crystallographic metric. By systematically varying the linker (&#8211;CH2&#8211;, &#8211;O&#8211;, and &#8211;CH2CH2&#8211;) and the pendant substituents (H, methyl, tert&#8208;butyl), we examine how increasingly bulky &#8220;dispersion energy donors&#8221; affect both the intramolecular hydrogen bond and the accessible conformational states. In reference systems, where a single noncovalent interaction governs the geometry, even relatively simple computational models correctly reproduce the experimentally observed structures. However, for molecules featuring two competing noncovalent interactions, the tested, dispersion&#8208;corrected, DFT often fails to predict the relative energies of accessible conformers accurately, highlighting current limitations in predictive accuracy. We briefly discuss broader implications of currently achievable predictive accuracy for homogeneous catalysis.

         <title>Hybrid Nanostructures by Covalent Functionalization of MoS2 and WS2 with C60 Undergoing Excited Electron Transfer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 66, November 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reports the synthesis and characterization of MoS2&#8211;C60 and WS2&#8211;C60 nanohybrids via rapid covalent functionalization with a modified C60. The nanohybrids exhibit excellent solubility in various solvents and enable efficient electron transfer, forming MoS2&#8226;+&#8211;C60&#8226;&#8208; and WS2&#8226;+&#8211;C60&#8226;&#8208; species, thus highlighting their potential for light energy harvesting.








Abstract
In this contribution, we report the formation, characterization, and photophysical assessment of hybrid nanostructures realized via a rapid and straightforward covalent functionalization reaction between MoS2 or WS2 and a modified C60 bearing a 1,2&#8208;dithiolane chain. Transmission electron microscopy imaging analysis confirmed that the resulting hybrids are homogeneous at the nanoscale level, effectively suppressing undesired fullerene&#8211;fullerene aggregation. X&#8208;ray photoelectron and Raman spectroscopy evidenced the covalent connection between the two species, and thermogravimetry determined the loading of C60 onto MoS2 or WS2. The MoS2&#8211;C60 and WS2&#8211;C60 hybrids were stable in liquid media, forming homogeneous inks, which enabled the investigation of thermodynamically feasible, excitonic electron transfer resulting in the formation of MoS2&#8226;+&#8211;C60&#8226;&#8208; and WS2&#8226;+&#8211;C60&#8226;&#8208; radical ion pairs by femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy. The measured rates were found to be 1.92&#160;&#215;&#160;107 s&#8722;1 for MoS2&#8211;C60 and 3.50&#160;&#215;&#160;107 s&#8722;1, respectively, revealing their potential as light energy harvesting materials.

         <title>Tuning the Excited State Character of Amine/Carbonyl Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Emitters with Ring Fusion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 66, November 25, 2025. </description>

Ring fusion in MR&#8208;TADF emitters can affect the charge transfer excited state and therefore the photophysical properties. Here we investigate the effect of ring fusion in two structurally similar molecules to identify the advantages and disadvantages of this strategy.








Abstract
Multiple resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) emitters exhibit short&#8208;range charge transfer (SRCT) and have narrow emission, whereas donor&#8208;acceptor TADF emitters show long&#8208;range charge transfer (LRCT) and rapid reverse intersystem crossing (RISC). While some work has been done to create intermediate&#8208;type materials with narrow emission and rapid RISC simultaneously, no studies of structurally comparable donor&#8208;acceptor versus MR&#8208;TADF systems have been described. Here we report two TADF emitters, Acr&#8208;DiKTa and Iso&#8208;DiDiKTa, to examine the effect of ring fusion on LRCT and SRCT character. Acr&#8208;DiKTa appends an acridone moiety to quinolino[3,2,1&#8208;de]acridine&#8208;5,9&#8208;dione to create a donor&#8208;acceptor&#8208;type structure, while a carbonyl bridge fuses these moieties in Iso&#8208;DiDiKTa to give an MR&#8208;TADF structure. Acr&#8208;DiKTa emits blue&#8208;green in toluene with a full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 38&#160;nm whereas Iso&#8208;DiDiKTa emits green&#8208;yellow with a FWHM of 34&#160;nm. Calculated orbital distributions show SRCT in the first excited state for both compounds. Both compounds are TADF active in doped films, and derived rate constants show that RISC is four times more rapid in Acr&#8208;DiKTa. This study shows that while ring fusion enhances color purity, donor&#8208;acceptor structures can achieve comparable FWHMs and rapid RISC through dominant SRCT supported by LRCT for best performance in TADF materials.

ABSTRACT
The development of highly efficient remediation technologies for heavy metal pollution has attracted widespread attention. Due to the &#8220;trade&#8208;off&#8221; effect arising from the different occurrence states and physical&#8208;chemical properties of heavy metal cations and anions in the different pH environments, the remediation of coexisting multiple heavy metal contamination is significantly complex and challenging. As such, the investigation of highly selective and efficient adsorbents for multiple heavy metals removal is the present focus of the scientific and industrial community. Under such circumstances, we report the latest progress on multiple heavy metals removal in this review. Firstly, we summarize the current situation of heavy metal contamination and the corresponding remediation methods. Secondly, we divide the discussion into three sections, including the heavy metal cation removal, heavy metal anion removal, and the coexisting multiple heavy metal removal from the perspective of removal mechanisms and the used adsorbents. Finally, we highlight the future challenges and opportunities in the development of promising adsorbents for multiple heavy metals removal.

         <title>A Versatile System of Solvent, Catalyst, and Ligand for Challenging Biphenyl Synthesis Through Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling reactions with electron&#8208;deficient haloarenes and electron&#8208;deficient areneboronic acids proceed with moderate to excellent yields in N&#8208;methylpyrrolidone as solvent, Pd(dba)3 as catalyst, CuI as cocatalyst, and Davephos as ligand.








ABSTRACT
Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling reactions are difficult when both reaction partners (boronic acid and halide) are electron&#8208;poor. We describe here a system of solvent, catalyst, and ligand with which also electron&#8208;poor substrates react, without the necessity to try several conditions. The system consists of N&#8208;methylpyrrolidone as solvent, tris(dibenzylidenaceton)dipalladium(0) as catalyst, CuI as cocatalyst, and Davephos as ligand. This combination yields little or no Ullmann product, and the desired cross&#8208;coupling product is in moderate to excellent yields.

         <title>Facile Synthesis of 2D Metal&#8208;Organic Framework as an Efficient Heterogeneous Catalyst for the Epoxidation of Olefin With H2O2</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using the sacrificial template method, metal porphyrin was attached in situ to the ZnO surface to prepare surfactant&#8208;free, highly dispersed Zn&#8208;TCPP(Mn)/ZnO, which had a positive effect on the stability and activity of the catalyst. Notably, styrene underwent complete conversion within 20 min, with an impressive epoxide selectivity reaching 97%, and exhibits a remarkable conversion frequency of 1980 h&#8722;1. More significantly, the composite catalyst Zn&#8208;TCPP(Mn)/ZnO exhibits a structurally stable framework and maintains a substantial level of catalytic activity even after undergoing five consecutive cycles. Meanwhile, other substrates exhibited varying degrees of selectivity, ranging from moderate to commendable.








ABSTRACT
The 2D ultrathin MOF nanosheets, which effectively integrate metals and functional ligands, possess the advantageous features of molecular catalysts and exhibit remarkable catalytic activity in multiphase catalysis. Herein, we employed the sacrificial template method to achieve in situ attachment of metalloporphyrin onto a ZnO substrate, resulting in the formation of surfactant&#8208;free 2D dispersed structures of Zn&#8208;TCPP(Mn)/ZnO. The multilayered stacked B&#8208;Zn&#8208;TCPP(Mn) (3D) blocks were prepared by growing Zn2+ mixed with metalloporphyrin as a comparison. The novel composite catalyst Zn&#8208;TCPP(Mn)/ZnO was employed for the efficient epoxidation of various alkenes using H2O2 as an oxidant at ambient temperatures. Notably, alkenes conversion within 20 min achieves a high yield and impressive 1980 h&#8722;1 turnover frequency. The composite catalyst can still maintain its structural integrity after undergoing five consecutive cycles, and the total yield of oxidized styrene is slightly reduced. This was confirmed by a series of characterization analyses and other assessments. Additionally, comparative experiments revealed that the B&#8208;Zn&#8208;TCPP(Mn) blocks underwent partial exfoliation into 2D nanosheets following the catalytic reaction, thereby enhancing the catalytic conversion efficiency in subsequent epoxidation reactions. This finding provides compelling evidence for the heightened catalytic activity of 2D materials.

&lt;p&gt;The 2D ultrathin MOF nanosheets, which effectively integrate metals and functional ligands, possess the advantageous features of molecular catalysts and exhibit remarkable catalytic activity in multiphase catalysis. Herein, we employed the sacrificial template method to achieve in situ attachment of metalloporphyrin onto a ZnO substrate, resulting in the formation of surfactant-free 2D dispersed structures of Zn-TCPP(Mn)/ZnO. The multilayered stacked B-Zn-TCPP(Mn) (3D) blocks were prepared by growing Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; mixed with metalloporphyrin as a comparison. The novel composite catalyst Zn-TCPP(Mn)/ZnO was employed for the efficient epoxidation of various alkenes using H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; as an oxidant at ambient temperatures. Notably, alkenes conversion within 20 min achieves a high yield and impressive 1980 h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; turnover frequency. The composite catalyst can still maintain its structural integrity after undergoing five consecutive cycles, and the total yield of oxidized styrene is slightly reduced. This was confirmed by a series of characterization analyses and other assessments. Additionally, comparative experiments revealed that the B-Zn-TCPP(Mn) blocks underwent partial exfoliation into 2D nanosheets following the catalytic reaction, thereby enhancing the catalytic conversion efficiency in subsequent epoxidation reactions. This finding provides compelling evidence for the heightened catalytic activity of 2D materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Enantioselective Assembly of Si&#8208;Stereogenic Sila&#8208;[1,4]oxazines via Sequential Si&#9472;O/Si&#9472;C Dehydrocoupling</title>

         <dc:description>
An iridium&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective dehydrogenative coupling for synthesizing silicon&#8208;stereogenic sila&#8208;[1,4]oxazines is reported. This method directly constructs Si&#8208;stereogenic centers with high enantioselectivity, offering new avenues for silicon&#8208;containing heterocycles.








ABSTRACT
Silacycles have shown great promise in medicinal chemistry, agrochemistry, and materials science. In this study, we report an efficient iridium&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective dehydrogenative coupling of pyrrolo&#8208;phenol derivatives with dihydrosilanes, which leads to the synthesis of Si&#8208;stereogenic sila&#8208;[1,4]oxazines with excellent enantioselectivity. This method successfully integrates silicon into the bioactive [1,4]oxazine framework, broadening the application scope of silicon&#8208;containing heterocycles. Mechanistic studies indicate a two&#8208;step sequence: an enantioselective Ir&#8208;catalyzed Si&#9472;O dehydrocoupling, followed by an intramolecular Si&#9472;C coupling.

         <title>Observation of Quinoxalinyl Radical Produced by Muonium Addition to 1,2&#8208;Diisocyanobenzene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This muon spectroscopic study analyzed a 1,2&#8208;diisocyanobenzene derivative, which led to the isocyanide insertion process. The transverse&#8208;field muon spin rotation (TF&#8208;&#181;SR) measurements observed the quinoxalinyl radical, and the imidoyl radical did not appear due to the prompt cyclization occurring faster than the muon timescale. The &#181;SR&#8208;characterized paramagnetic species was an aryl &#963; radical, exhibiting the corresponding high reactivity in the THF (tetrahydrofuran) solution.








ABSTRACT
Radical isocyanide (isonitrile) insertion reactions have advanced considerably, yet the nature of the underlying paramagnetic intermediates remains poorly understood. We previously studied the isocyanide insertion of muonium (Mu), a light isotope of hydrogen, into 2&#8208;isocyano&#8208;1,1&#8242;&#8208;biphenyls by transverse field muon spin rotation (TF&#8208;&#181;SR) spectroscopy and characterized the resulting radical, which was identified as an imidoyl radical. The cyclized product was not observed on the microsecond timescale. To gain deeper insight, we now report TF&#8208;&#181;SR spectra of 1,2&#8208;diisocyano&#8208;3,4,5,6&#8208;tetramethylbenzene in both THF solution and the crystalline state. A single muoniated radical species was observed, displaying an unusually small muon hyperfine coupling constant (hfc). Guided by density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we identified this species as a quinoxalinyl radical, formed via intramolecular cyclization of the imidoyl intermediate. This observation implies that the imidoyl radical survives only on the nanosecond timescale before cyclization.

         <title>Rational Construction and Design of CoTi&#8208;NiTi/TNO Species by Pulsed&#8208;Laser Irradiation for Efficient Electrocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>

ABSTRACT
Hydrogen is a renewable and environmentally friendly energy carrier and is regarded a viable alternative to fossil fuels. Consequently, developing electrodes with excellent hydrogen evolution electrocatalysis is a top priority in research. In this regard, the CoTi&#8208;NiTi/TNO electrode was synthesized through a single&#8208;step laser method in a nitrogen atmosphere utilizing precursors infused with Co and Ni. Importantly, the CoTi&#8208;NiTi/TNO||IrO2 electrolyzer demonstrated excellent water&#8208;splitting efficiency, reaching a voltage of 1.5&#160;V at a current density of 50&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 in 0.5&#160;M H2SO4, surpassing the commercial Pt/C||IrO2 configuration, which only achieved 1.5&#160;V at a current density of 22&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. Importantly, the CoTi&#8208;NiTi/TNO||IrO2 displayed a remarkable stability that operated at 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 for over 48&#160;h without significant decay. The laser&#8208;induced annealing approach offers several advantages. These include the prevention of particle aggregation, an increase in yield, a reduction in processing time, and potentially lower energy consumption.

Planar (D5h) and pyramidal (C5v) dianionic clusters, SeM5X52&#8722; (M = LiK; X = FBr), showcase pentacoordinate selenium atoms stabilized by geometric confinement and electrostatic interactions with surrounding alkali and halogen atoms.








Abstract
A systematic computational exploration of the dianionic systems SeM5X52&#8722; (M&#160;=&#160;Li&#9472;Cs; X&#160;=&#160;F&#9472;I) was conducted to evaluate the viability of planar pentacoordinate selenium (ppSe). Of the twenty combinations considered, 10 adopt planar or pyramidal structures, with four corresponding to true global minima containing a ppSe center. Bonding analysis and magnetic response calculations show that the stabilization of ppSe arrangements in these dianions results mainly from geometric confinement and strong electrostatic interactions between selenium and the surrounding alkali metal and halogen atoms. Unlike planar hypercoordinate systems stabilized by delocalized bonding or aromaticity, the dianions studied here display highly localized electronic structures, expanding the scope of nonclassical bonding motifs in main&#8208;group chemistry.

         <title>Proton Conductive Supramolecular Architectures Based on a Cobalt Terpyridine&#8211;Biimidazole Complex: Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Hexamer and Mixed&#8208;Valence 1D Chain</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydrogen&#8208;bonded cobalt(II/III) coordination complexes incorporating 2,2&#8242;&#8208;biimidazole and COOH&#8208;terpyridine ligands were synthesized, forming a hexameric cluster [1]6 and a rare mixed&#8208;valence 1D chain [2]n. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction revealed hydrogen&#8208;bonding networks and 1D channels. [1]6 exhibited high proton conductivity (1.0 &#215; 10&#8722;2 S cm&#8722;1, 358 K, 100% RH), showing promise as a proton&#8208;conducting material.








ABSTRACT
Despite extensive research on hydrogen&#8208;bonded frameworks, cobalt&#8208;based coordination complexes with biimidazole ligands remain largely unexplored, and their potential as proton&#8208;conducting materials has not been comprehensively investigated. Therefore, this paper reports the synthesis, crystal structures, and proton conduction properties of novel hydrogen&#8208;bonded cobalt(II/III) coordination complexes incorporating 2,2&#8242;&#8208;biimidazole (H2bim) and 4&#8242;&#8208;carboxyl&#8208;2,2&#8242;:6&#8242;,2&#8243;&#8208;terpyridine (COOH&#8208;terpy) ligands. Two supramolecular architectures were obtained via ligand exchange reactions in methanol: a hydrogen&#8208;bonded hexamer, {CoIII(COO&#8208;terpy)(H2bim)(SCN)}6 ([1]6), and a mixed&#8208;valence 1D hydrogen&#8208;bonded chain, {[CoII(COO&#8208;terpy)(H2bim)(NCS)][CoIII(COO&#8208;terpy)(H2bim)(SCN)]}n ([2]n). Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction revealed that both structures feature extensive hydrogen&#8208;bonding networks involving carboxylate and H2bim ligands, leading to unique porous architectures with 1D channels accommodating lattice solvents. Thermogravimetric and variable&#8208;temperature powder X&#8208;ray diffraction analyses demonstrated the thermal stability and reversible hydration behavior of [1]6. AC impedance measurements under 100% relative humidity revealed high proton conductivity in [1]6, reaching 1.0 &#215; 10&#8722;2 S cm&#8722;1 at 358 K, attributable to proton transport facilitated by hydrogen&#8208;bonded networks and lattice water molecules. Activation energy analysis suggested a vehicle mechanism for proton conduction. Overall, this study highlights the potential of hydrogen&#8208;bonded cobalt complexes incorporating biimidazole ligands as promising proton&#8208;conducting materials with tunable supramolecular architectures.

&lt;p&gt;Hydrogen-bonded cobalt(II/III) coordination complexes incorporating 2,2&#8242;-biimidazole and COOH-terpyridine ligands were synthesized, forming a hexameric cluster [&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; and a rare mixed-valence 1D chain [&lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;. Single-crystal X-ray diffraction revealed hydrogen-bonding networks and 1D channels. [&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; exhibited high proton conductivity (1.0 &#215; 10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; S cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, 358 K, 100% RH), showing promise as a proton-conducting material.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite extensive research on hydrogen-bonded frameworks, cobalt-based coordination complexes with biimidazole ligands remain largely unexplored, and their potential as proton-conducting materials has not been comprehensively investigated. Therefore, this paper reports the synthesis, crystal structures, and proton conduction properties of novel hydrogen-bonded cobalt(II/III) coordination complexes incorporating 2,2&#8242;-biimidazole (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;bim) and 4&#8242;-carboxyl-2,2&#8242;:6&#8242;,2&#8243;-terpyridine (COOH-terpy) ligands. Two supramolecular architectures were obtained via ligand exchange reactions in methanol: a hydrogen-bonded hexamer, {Co&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt;(COO-terpy)(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;bim)(SCN)}&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; ([&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;), and a mixed-valence 1D hydrogen-bonded chain, {[Co&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt;(COO-terpy)(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;bim)(NCS)][Co&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt;(COO-terpy)(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;bim)(SCN)]}&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; ([&lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;). Single-crystal X-ray diffraction revealed that both structures feature extensive hydrogen-bonding networks involving carboxylate and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;bim ligands, leading to unique porous architectures with 1D channels accommodating lattice solvents. Thermogravimetric and variable-temperature powder X-ray diffraction analyses demonstrated the thermal stability and reversible hydration behavior of [&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;. AC impedance measurements under 100% relative humidity revealed high proton conductivity in [&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;, reaching 1.0 &#215; 10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; S cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 358 K, attributable to proton transport facilitated by hydrogen-bonded networks and lattice water molecules. Activation energy analysis suggested a vehicle mechanism for proton conduction. Overall, this study highlights the potential of hydrogen-bonded cobalt complexes incorporating biimidazole ligands as promising proton-conducting materials with tunable supramolecular architectures.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Advanced Microsphere and Hydrogel Platforms for Precision Interventional Therapy of Hepatocellular Carcinoma</title>

ABSTRACT
Interventional management of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains hindered by profound tumor heterogeneity and an immunosuppressive microenvironment. While transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) constitutes the current standard of care, its therapeutic efficacy is compromised by burst drug release, incomplete vascular occlusion, and systemic toxicity. Emerging advanced biomaterial platforms&#8212;microspheres and hydrogels&#8212;are redefining this paradigm by enabling precise spatial and temporal control over embolization and drug delivery. Microspheres provide hierarchical vascular occlusion and sustained release through tunable size and mechanical properties, addressing the limitations of conventional lipiodol formulations. Hydrogels offer exceptional injectability, high payload capacity, and conformal filling of irregular cavities, thereby facilitating controlled intratumoral release and microenvironment modulation. Beyond embolization, these systems integrate seamlessly with multimodal therapies&#8212;including magnetic hyperthermia, radiotherapy, and immunotherapy&#8212;delivering synergistic &#8220;embolization&#8211;therapy&#8211;diagnosis&#8221; functionality. Incorporation of stimuli&#8208;responsive motifs, imaging agents, and immunomodulators further enables localized ablation, reversal of immunosuppression, and induction of systemic antitumor immunity to suppress metastasis and recurrence. Despite encouraging preclinical outcomes, clinical translation faces challenges in biocompatibility, scalable fabrication, and standardized evaluation. This review highlights design strategies for next&#8208;generation embolic materials that integrate precision embolization, multimodal imaging, and immune reprogramming, thereby advancing interventional HCC therapy toward intelligent and personalized solutions.

         <title>Synthetic Mimics of Serine Proteases via Covalent Imprinting of Photo&#8208;Protected Template Molecules for Aryl Amide Hydrolysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
2&#8208;Aminobenzyl alcohol in solution uses its more nucleophilic amino group to react with an activated ester in the transacylation. Only inside a custom&#8208;designed active site do the same functional groups mimic serine protease by catalytically hydrolyzing not only activated esters but also aryl amides with substrate selectivity.








ABSTRACT
The rational design of enzyme&#8208;mimicking catalysts remains in its early stages. Beyond the controversies surrounding the origin of the catalytic efficiency found in enzyme catalysis, a large challenge lies in the synthetic construction of multifunctional active sites with precisely positioned binding and catalytic groups. Here, we present a rational strategy to create serine protease&#8208;mimicking molecularly imprinted nanoparticles (MINPs) via covalent imprinting within cross&#8208;linkable micelles, followed by photo&#8208;deprotection of the polymerized template molecules. Unlike previously reported protease mimics that work on activated ester substrates, the MINP&#8208;based catalysts are able to hydrolyze aryl amides under mild conditions. In addition, substrate selectivity can be finely tuned through the modular design of the template molecules.

         <title>Enhancing G&#8208;Quadruplex Binding: Rational Design and Biophysical Evaluation of Dimeric Ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fluorescence thermal shift assays, electrospray ionization&#8208;mass spectrometry, CD spectroscopy, molecular modeling and cytotoxicity assays were enrolled to study the binding of a rationally designed anthraquinone&#8208;based G&#8208;quadruplex binder interacting with the nucleic acid as a molecular tweezer.








ABSTRACT
G&#8208;quadruplexes (G4s) are non&#8208;canonical nucleic acid structures formed by guanine&#8208;rich sequences. Within the human genome, beyond telomeres, G4 motifs have also been found in promoters, implying a potential role in gene regulation that could be achieved through interactions with small&#8208;molecule ligands. In this field, anthraquinone represented a privileged scaffold for the design of G4&#8208;targeting molecules. Additionally, emerging evidence proved that compounds bearing two aromatic cores can offer enhanced affinity and selectivity toward G4s due to cooperative binding in a tweezer&#8208;like fashion. This study reports the rational design and synthesis of anthraquinone&#8208;based building blocks conceived to generate a dimeric ligand connected through a flexible polyethylene glycol (PEG) linker to potentially recognize G4 as molecular tweezers. The interaction of the synthesized compounds with G4 structures has been investigated by biophysical techniques, including fluorescence thermal shift assays, electrospray ionization&#8208;mass spectrometry and circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy, supported by molecular modeling studies. Finally, cytotoxicity assays were performed to evaluate the antiproliferative effects of the new ligands.

         <title>Biocatalytic Strategies for the Synthesis of Atropisomers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Atropisomeric scaffolds are important building blocks in natural products, organocatalysts, metal ligands, and functional materials. This review introduces current developments for synthesizing atropisomers employing biocatalytic kinetic resolution, dynamic kinetic resolution, and desymmetrization strategies.








ABSTRACT
The asymmetric synthesis of atropisomers has garnered extensive attention in recent years. Atropisomers constitute a key structural motif in natural products, chiral ligands, organocatalysts, and functional materials. Despite progress driven by transition&#8208;metal and organocatalysis, inherent limitations in enantioselectivity and sustainability have hampered further development in this field. Alternatively, biocatalysis offers a promising solution employing strategies including (dynamic) kinetic resolution, desymmetrization, and other strategies. These biocatalytic processes operate under mild, environmentally friendly conditions, achieving high stereoselectivity that is often difficult to attain with traditional methods. This review highlights recent advances in the biocatalytic synthesis of atropisomers and offer insights in the development of the relevant field.

         <title>Delivery Routes of Topical Eyedrops Reaching the Posterior Segment of the Eye&#8208;Recent Advances</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review summarizs recent advances in topical eyedrop therapies for ocular fundus diseases, with a focus on their delivery routes and mechanisms by which they reach the posterior segment of eye.The formulations based on the corneal route include emulsomes and dual&#8208;transmembrane peptides, those based on the conjunctival route include PepT&#8208;1 ligands and cell&#8208;penetrating peptides, and those based on dual routes include chitosan, polymer micelles and supramolecular peptides.








ABSTRACT
Current topical eyedrop treatments for posterior segment diseases face significant challenges, including rapid tear clearance and ocular barrier limitations, which hinder effective drug delivery to target tissues in the posterior segment. To date, no eyedrop formulation has been clinically approved for the treatment of ocular fundus diseases. Eyedrops reach the posterior segment via two primary routes: the corneal route and the conjunctival routes, the latter comprising the conjunctival&#8211;vasculature route and the conjunctival&#8211;scleral route. This review summarizes recent advances in topical eyedrop therapies for ocular fundus diseases, with a focus on their delivery routes and the mechanisms by which they reach the posterior segment of eye. The cell&#8208;penetrating homing peptides and lipid nanoparticle&#8208;encapsulated eyedrops primarily reach the posterior segment via the corneal route; cell&#8208;penetrating peptides and PepT&#8208;1&#8208;targeting ligands mainly utilize the conjunctival route; whereas chitosan nanoparticles, polymeric micelles, and supramolecular peptide&#8208;based eyedrops can access the posterior segment via both routes. By systematically clarifying the pathways and mechanisms by which eyedrops formulations traverse ocular barriers, this review aims to provide a rational foundation for future research and development in posterior segment drug delivery.

This review summarizes recent advances in topical eyedrop therapies for ocular fundus diseases, with a focus on their delivery routes and the mechanisms by which they reach the posterior segment of eye. The cell-penetrating homing peptides and lipid nanoparticle-encapsulated eyedrops primarily reach the posterior segment via the corneal route; cell-penetrating peptides and PepT-1-targeting ligands mainly utilize the conjunctival route; whereas chitosan nanoparticles, polymeric micelles, and supramolecular peptide-based eyedrops can access the posterior segment via both routes. By systematically clarifying the pathways and mechanisms by which eyedrops formulations traverse ocular barriers, this review aims to provide a rational foundation for future research and development in posterior segment drug delivery.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Structural Control of RNA Demethylation: G&#8208;Quadruplex Proximity Suppresses ALKBH5 Activity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
RNA G&#8208;quadruplex structures significantly affected the m6A demethylation activity of the RNA demethylase, ALKBH5. The suppression was apparent when m6A was near G&#8208;tetrad cores, and not within the flexible loops. The G&#8208;quadruplex ligand induced G&#8208;quadruplex structure to RNA and suppressed ALKBH5 demethylation activity to nearby m6A. These results suggest that G&#8208;quadruplex RNA serves as a regulatory element in epitranscriptome regulation.








ABSTRACT
RNA modifications and higher&#8208;order structures function as regulatory layers of RNA metabolism beyond sequence context. However, their interplay remains largely unexplored. Among RNA modifications, N6&#8208;methyladenosine (m6A) is the most abundant internal modification in mRNAs, regulated by writer, reader, and eraser proteins; the AlkB family dioxygenases, AlkB homolog 5 (ALKBH5), and fat mass&#8208; and obesity&#8208;associated protein (FTO). In addition, G&#8208;quadruplex RNA is a representative structure involved in key biological processes. This study investigated how G&#8208;quadruplex structures influence the demethylation efficiency of m6A erasers. Using RNAs with m6A positioned adjacent to the G&#8208;tetrad core or within a flexible loop of G&#8208;quadruplex structures, we showed that G&#8208;quadruplex formation markedly suppressed ALKBH5 activity compared with FTO, particularly when m6A was near the G&#8208;tetrad core, such as the HIV&#8208;1 U3&#8208;region G&#8208;quadruplex&#8208;forming sequence. Conversely, m6A within a long, flexible loop, remained accessible to ALKBH5. The G&#8208;quadruplex&#8208;specific ligand BRACO19, which stabilizes G&#8208;quadruplex structures, further confirmed the structural sensitivity of ALKBH5. To our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate a direct link between G&#8208;quadruplex structures and m6A eraser protein activity. These findings highlight the importance of the RNA structural context in regulating m6A erasers and suggest that G&#8208;quadruplexes may serve as regulatory elements in epitranscriptomic control.

         <title>Site&#8208;Specific OaAEP1 Mediated Functional Proteins Immobilization on Magnetic Nanoparticles and the Recyclings</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
ABSTRACT
Precise and stable immobilization of proteins on nanoparticle surfaces is essential for advancing applications in biocatalysis, biosensing, and synthetic biology. However, conventional immobilization strategies often suffer from nonspecific binding, random orientation, and loss of biological activity. Here, a chemically defined, site&#8208;specific protein conjugation strategy is developed using the peptide ligase OaAEP1 to catalyze ligation between N&#8208;terminal Gly&#8208;Leu (GL) and C&#8208;terminal Asn&#8208;Gly&#8208;Leu (NGL) motifs. This approach enables controlled&#8208;orientation and high&#8208;efficiency immobilization of functional proteins and enzymes on Fe3O4 and Fe3O4@SiO2 magnetic nanoparticles. Fluorescent proteins and catalytically active enzymes, including TEV (Tobacco Etch Virus) protease and Taq polymerase, retain activity and recyclability following conjugation. Sequential ligation permits programmable multimeric assembly. This enzymatic platform provides a robust, reusable, and modular route to construct functional protein&#8208;nanoparticle interfaces with broad implications for nanobiotechnology and protein engineering.

         <title>Porous Organic Polymer Constructed From Thiazolo&#8208;Thiazole and Cyclophosphazene as a Heterogeneous Photocatalyst for Visible Light&#8208;Mediated Synthesis of Isatins, Thiocyanoindoles, and Thiocyanoanilines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A porous organic polymer (POP), constructed based on hexaaryloxycyclophosphazene and thiazolo[5,4&#8208;d]thiazole building blocks, is demonstrated as a visible light&#8211;driven, metal&#8208;free heterogeneous photocatalyst for oxidation of indoles to isatins and thiocyanation of indoles and anilines under mild conditions.








Abstract
A porous organic polymer (POP) based on hexakis(4&#8208;formylphenoxy)cyclophosphazene (HFCP), that is, HFCPTzPOP, was synthesized by condensation reaction with dithiooxamide. The polymer is shown to exhibit excellent visible light absorption, enabling its application as a heterogeneous photocatalyst for the conversion of indoles to isatins and 3&#8208;thiocyanoindoles, and selective thiocyanation of anilines at the para position. The photocatalytic reactions occur under mild conditions in oxygen atmosphere without the addition of any toxic metal or oxidizing agent. HFCPTzPOP acts as a photoredox catalyst in oxidative transformations, converting molecular oxygen into singlet oxygen (1O2) and superoxide radical anion (O2&#8226;&#8211;) through energy transfer and electron transfer processes, respectively. It is shown that the photocatalyst can be easily recycled up to 10 cycles without any loss of catalytic activity.

The family of template&#8208;assembled synthetic G&#8208;quartets, or TASQs, comprises different molecular tools that have been successfully used to decipher G&#8208;quadruplex (G4) biology (via optical imaging and/or affinity precipitation). The synthetic access to the different TASQs has been thoroughly revisited herein to make it simpler and more efficient thanks to a convergent strategy that relies on an unprecedented key common intermediate.








ABSTRACT
Precise insights into the biology of DNA and RNA G&#8208;quadruplexes (G4s) were obtained thanks to the use of ever more versatile G4&#8208;interacting molecules (or G4 ligands), which bear additional moieties making them functionalizable in situ (i.e., while in interaction with cellular G4s) thanks to bioorthogonal chemistry. We recently reported on a series of biomimetic G4 ligands known as TASQs (for template&#8208;assembled synthetic G&#8208;quartets) whose multifunctionality was exploited to visualize (pre&#8208;targeted and in situ click imaging) and identify cellular G4s (G4omics and Chem&#8208;CLIP). We report herein on a novel synthetic strategy that makes multivalent TASQs readily accessible and opens brand new perspectives for the design of ever smarter molecular tools to unravel the quite complex G4 biology in a more accurate, straightforward, and simpler manner.

         <title>New Phosphoranylideneketenes and Phosphoranylidenethioketenes&#8208;Synthesis, Structure, Spectroscopy, and Lewis Base Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of structurally and electronically diverse phosphoranylideneketenes (R3PCCO) and phosphoranylidenethioketenes (R3PCCS) were synthesized and comprehensively characterized by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray&#8208;crystallography, 13C NMR, and IR spectroscopy. Despite acting as relatively weak ambidentate Lewis donors, these compounds readily form stable adducts with strong Lewis acids.








Abstract
Posphoranylideneketene Ph3PCCO and its sulfur analogue, Ph3PCCS, are cumulated ylides that exhibit diverse reactivity and distinct structural features. Herein, we present the first systematic study of substituent effects on the structures and bonding of a series of aryl&#8208; and alkyl&#8208;substituted phosphoranylideneketenes, R3PCCO [R = Et, cyclohexyl, NMe2, 4&#8208;Me2N&#8208;C6H4, 4&#8208;MeO&#8208;C6H4, 4&#8208;CF3&#8208;C6H4, 3,5&#8208;(CF3)2&#8208;C6H3], prepared from the corresponding phosphonium salts, [R3PCH2COOEt]X (X = Br, I) and two equivalents of Na[N(SiMe3)2]. Multinuclear NMR and IR spectroscopy, supported by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, revealed that the bond strength within the central P&#9552;C&#9552;C&#9552;O fragment increases with the electron&#8208;deficiency of the aryl substituents at phosphorus. The corresponding phosphoranylidenethioketenes, R3PCCS (R = Et, cyclohexyl, NMe2, 4&#8208;Me2N&#8208;C6H4, 4&#8208;MeO&#8208;C6H4, 4&#8208;CF3&#8208;C6H4), were obtained by reactions of R3PCCO with CS2. The rate of conversion of R3PCCO into R3PCCS decreases with increasing electron deficiency at phosphorus. Both R3PCCO and R3PCCS act as relatively weak ambidentate Lewis donors, yet they form stable acid&#8208;base adducts with strong Lewis acids such as B(C6F5)3 and Al(C6F5)3.

&lt;p&gt;A series of structurally and electronically diverse phosphoranylideneketenes (R&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;PCCO) and phosphoranylidenethioketenes (R&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;PCCS) were synthesized and comprehensively characterized by single-crystal X-ray-crystallography, &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C NMR, and IR spectroscopy. Despite acting as relatively weak ambidentate Lewis donors, these compounds readily form stable adducts with strong Lewis acids.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Posphoranylideneketene Ph&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;PCCO and its sulfur analogue, Ph&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;PCCS, are cumulated ylides that exhibit diverse reactivity and distinct structural features. Herein, we present the first systematic study of substituent effects on the structures and bonding of a series of aryl- and alkyl-substituted phosphoranylideneketenes, R&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;PCCO [R = Et, cyclohexyl, NMe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, 4-Me&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;N-C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, 4-MeO-C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, 4-CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, 3,5-(CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;], prepared from the corresponding phosphonium salts, [R&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;PCH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;COOEt]X (X = Br, I) and two equivalents of Na[N(SiMe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]. Multinuclear NMR and IR spectroscopy, supported by single-crystal X-ray diffraction, revealed that the bond strength within the central P&#9552;C&#9552;C&#9552;O fragment increases with the electron-deficiency of the aryl substituents at phosphorus. The corresponding phosphoranylidenethioketenes, R&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;PCCS (R = Et, cyclohexyl, NMe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, 4-Me&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;N-C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, 4-MeO-C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, 4-CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;), were obtained by reactions of R&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;PCCO with CS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. The rate of conversion of R&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;PCCO into R&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;PCCS decreases with increasing electron deficiency at phosphorus. Both R&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;PCCO and R&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;PCCS act as relatively weak ambidentate Lewis donors, yet they form stable acid-base adducts with strong Lewis acids such as B(C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and Al(C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Facile Synthesis of the Tricyclic Core of Daphniphyllum Alkaloid Daphnilongeranin B via Oxidative Nazarov Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Employing the oxidative Nazarov reaction, the [7,5,5]&#8208;tricyclic core of the&#160;Daphniphyllum&#160;alkaloid daphnilongeranin B was facilely synthesized from cycloheptenone in seven steps.








ABSTRACT
Daphniphyllum alkaloid daphnilongeranin B presents synthetic challenges due to its congested hexacyclic skeleton, seven stereogenic centers, and two vicinal quaternary centers. Recently, we discovered a series of TEMPO+BF4&#8722;&#8208;promoted Nazarov reactions and demonstrated their value in the synthesis of five&#8208;membered ring&#8208;containing small molecules and structurally complex natural products. Herein, we report a concise synthesis of its [7&#8208;5&#8208;5] tricyclic core via a 7&#8208;step approach, using commercially available, inexpensive cycloheptenone as the starting material. Key transformations include a Babler&#8208;Dauben rearrangement, an intramolecular aldol condensation, and a pivotal TEMPO&#8314;BF4&#8722;&#8208;mediated oxidative Nazarov reaction via an easily synthesized, unfunctionalized tertiary divinyl carbinol (TDC). These results showcase the utility of our mild Nazarov methodology and lay the foundation for the total synthesis of daphnilongeranin B.

         <title>Red and Orange&#8208;Light&#8208;Accelerated Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed Oxidative Olefination of Arenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Long&#8208;wavelength visible&#8208;light&#8208;accelerated Rh(III)&#8208;catalyzed olefination of arenes bearing anilides is reported. The method operates without an external photosensitizer or short&#8208;wavelength blue light. Rh(III) hydride intermediate is oxidized with oxygen in the excited state by absorbing long&#8208;wavelength visible light, improving catalytic efficiency.








ABSTRACT
Transition metal (TM)&#8208;catalyzed photoreactions have emerged as powerful tools for synthesizing products that are challenging to obtain under conventional thermal conditions. However, most protocols rely on short&#8208;wavelength visible light, such as purple or blue light (&lt;500&#160;nm). Although long&#8208;wavelength light (&gt;500&#160;nm) allows for milder conditions, higher chemical selectivity, and deep light penetration, its application in single TM&#8208;catalyzed photocatalytic systems is rare. Herein, we present the long&#8208;wavelength visible&#8208;light&#8208;accelerated Rh(III)&#8208;catalyzed olefination of arenes bearing an anilide moiety as a directing group. This methodology circumvents the use of external photosensitizers and short&#8208;wavelength blue light, owing to the use of a cationic Rh(III) complex. Experimental and computational analyses suggest that the Rh(III) complex initially acts as a C&#9472;H activation catalyst, and oxidation of the generated Rh(III) hydride intermediate by oxygen is accelerated by absorption of long&#8208;wavelength visible light (&gt; 500&#160;nm).

         <title>Diastereoselective Access to 3&#8208;Aminoindanones Through Domino Approach</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>









ABSTRACT
A unique intermolecular approach for stereoselective synthesis of 3&#8208;aminoindanones bearing a &#946;&#8208;quaternary carbon from 2&#8208;alkynylacetophenones and anilines has been reported. The catalytic system comprised of silver salt and phosphoric acid effectively transformed a range of 2&#8208;alkynylacetophenones and anilines to corresponding 3&#8208;aminoindanones in moderate to good yields with excellent diastereoselectivity and broad functional group tolerance. Furthermore, scale up and synthetic transformations were carried out to demonstrate the synthetic utility of the developed protocol.

         <title>Effective Strategies on Fabricating Photoelectrode Materials for Enhancing Photoelectrochemical Sensing</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Designing and constructing highly active photoelectrodes is key to improving the performance of PEC sensor. A variety of signal enhancement strategies have been employed on fabricating effective photoelectrode materials, including constructing heterojunctions, modifying cocatalysts, doping elements, and surface sensitization to achieve excellent sensing performance of PEC analysis platforms.








Abstract
Photoelectrochemical (PEC) sensors, as a rapidly developing and highly promising method for detection and analysis, show the advantages of low background noise and high sensitivity by virtue of the separate &#8220;photoexcitation&#8208;electrical detection signal&#8221; mode. It is attracting increasing attention in fields such as environmental monitoring and pharmaceutical analysis. The working mechanism of PEC sensor is recording the change of electrical signals caused by the recognition reaction between the measured substance and the photoelectrode. The photoresponsive materials on electrodes play a central role in the conversion of light into electrical signal, and it can directly affect the sensitivity of the sensor element. Designing and constructing highly active photoelectrode is key to improve the performance of PEC sensor, but it also presents significant challenges. Based on the above, this paper reviews a variety of electrical signal enhancement strategies through fabricating effective photoelectrode materials, such as constructing heterojunctions, modifying cocatalysts, doping elements, and sensitization of quantum dots, etc., aiming to provide valuable solutions to achieving excellent sensing performance of PEC analysis platforms. Finally, some future opportunities and challenges of PEC sensors are also discussed.

         <title>Synthesis and Electrolyte Study of Lithium Bis(perfluorinated pinacolato)Borate for Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work showcases the synthesis of lithium bis(perfluorinated pinacolato)borate and investigates its application as an electrolyte salt for lithium&#8208;ion batteries. The synthesized salts give improved air and thermal stability compared to conventionally used lithium hexafluorophosphate. Long&#8208;term battery cycling followed by an electrolyte degradation study has been performed.








Abstract
Lithium&#8208;ion batteries are the leading rechargeable battery technology. 1 M lithium hexafluorophosphate (LiPF6) dissolved in carbonate solvents is commonly used as the electrolyte; however, LiPF6 is hygroscopic and forms toxic HF in the presence of water. This work presents the synthesis of lithium bis(perfluorinated pinacolato)borate salts Li[B(pp)2]&#183;xDME (x&#160;=&#160;0 or 1, pp&#160;=&#160;perfluorinated pinacolato, O2C2(CF3)4), which exhibit superior air tolerance and have higher thermal stability than LiPF6. Lithium&#8208;ion cycling using 1 M Li[B(pp)2]&#183;DME and 0.2 M Li[B(pp)2] electrolyte salts was performed, where 0.2 M Li[B(pp)2] cycled with higher capacity than 1 M Li[B(pp)2]&#183;DME. X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy on the post&#8208;cycled NMC cathode found a thicker cathode electrolyte interphase with less LiF when using Li[B(pp)2]&#183;DME than for LiPF6 based electrolyte.

&lt;p&gt;This work showcases the synthesis of lithium bis(perfluorinated pinacolato)borate and investigates its application as an electrolyte salt for lithium-ion batteries. The synthesized salts give improved air and thermal stability compared to conventionally used lithium hexafluorophosphate. Long-term battery cycling followed by an electrolyte degradation study has been performed.

         <title>Deazaalloxazines &#8211; Flavin Derivatives That Provide Reductive Photoredox Catalysis with Inert Substrates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
7,8&#8208;Dimethoxy&#8208;5&#8208;aryl&#8208;5&#8208;deazaalloxazines (dAll) are new class of photostable, visible&#8208;light&#8208;absorbing flavin derivatives which are strongly reducible upon excitation with 400&#160;nm light. It was demonstrated on difficult&#8208;to&#8208;reduce aryl halides like bromo&#8208;, chloro&#8208; and fluoroanisoles which were transformed to phosphonates by reductive cross&#8208;coupling with trimethyl phosphite or on desulfonylation of sulfonamides to free amines by S&#9472;N bond cleavage.








Abstract
Reductive transformations of substances that are difficult to reduce continue to pose challenges for photoredox catalysis. Promising photoreduction catalysts include flavin and deazaflavin derivatives; however, even their reductive abilities are limited for the range of substrates considered &#8220;inert&#8221;. In this work, we present 5&#8208;deazaalloxazines, a new group of deazaflavin analogues that are predisposed to catalyze reductions due to their low reduction potential (down to &#8722;1.65&#160;V vs. SCE) even in the ground state. We studied three series of 5&#8208;deazaalloxazines ([i] 5&#8208;unsubstituted, [ii] 5&#8208;aryldeazaalloxazines, and [iii] 5&#8208;trifluoromethyl&#8208;5&#8208;deazaalloxazines) to determine their photophysical and electrochemical properties and their ability to participate in model photoreduction reactions. From 31 compounds, we selected 1,3&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;7,8&#8208;dimethoxy&#8208;5&#8208;(o&#8208;tolyl)&#8208;5&#8208;deazaalloxazine [3a(o&#8208;MePh)], as it showed, among other things, the highest efficiency in photodehalogenation of p&#8208;fluoroanisole and was photostable and absorbed in the visible light region, thereby allowing photoreactions using a 400&#160;nm LED. Practical applicability was demonstrated in the C&#9472;P coupling reaction of electron&#8208;rich aryl halides (including chloroanisoles and p&#8208;fluoroanisole) with trimethyl phosphite, providing an arylation reaction to form dimethyl arylphosphonates, and in the release/deprotection of amines from the corresponding tosyl and triflylamides.

         <title>Intertwined Processes in the Pummerer&#8208;Type Rearrangement Affording &#945;&#8208;Trifluoromethoxylated Thioethers and the Corresponding Highly Enantioenriched Sulfoxides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly stereoenriched &#945;&#8208;trifluoromethoxylated sulfoxides were accessed from racemic aryl methyl sulfoxides, by means of a trifluoromethoxylative Pummerer rearrangement and a highly enantioselective sulfoxidation. The 2&#8208;step procedure could be performed in one pot. The mechanism of the rearrangement and the properties of the desired sulfoxides were studied, paving the way for an alternative access to controlled trifluoromethoxylated stereocenters.








Abstract
A method to access racemic or highly stereoenriched &#945;&#8208;trifluoromethoxylated sulfoxides through the Pummerer rearrangement of aryl methyl sulfoxides followed by the oxidation of the resulting trifluoromethoxylated sulfides is described. Among the three reagents selected as both rearrangement activators and F3CO&#8211; anion sources, 2,4&#8208;dinitro&#8208;1&#8208;(trifluoromethoxy)benzene (DNTFB) was found to be the most effective. In each case, the OCF3&#8208;source was shown to play diverse key roles in the rearrangement. Enantioenriched trifluoromethoxy&#8208;sulfoxides (up to 95% enantiomeric excess) were obtained using an oxaziridinium salt derived from cholesterol.&#160;The configurational stability of these sulfoxides was investigated by thermal enantiomerization followed by enantioselective chromatography. Finally, the acidity of the protons in &#945;&#8208;position of the sulfinyl group was determined in DMSO (pKa value 20.3) suggesting the potency of this new scaffold for preparing trifluoromethoxylated trisubstituted C&#8208;sp3 centers via a deprotonation/alkylation sequence.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An environmentally benign and general protocol for intermolecular benzylic C(sp3)&#9472;H amination under mild, catalyst&#8208;free, and cost&#8208;effective conditions is reported, eliminating the long&#8208;standing reliance on transition metals, photoelectrochemical systems, and stoichiometric oxidants.








Abstract
We present an environmentally benign and efficient strategy for the direct amination of benzylic C(sp3)&#9472;H bonds. This method operates under metal&#8208;free, photocatalyst&#8208;free, and oxidant&#8208;free conditions. Notably, the protocol demonstrates exceptional functional group tolerance and scalability, enabling gram&#8208;scale synthesis and late&#8208;stage functionalization of complex drug&#8208;like molecules.

         <title>Nanocatalysis for Green Synthesis of Functionalized Benzofurans</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanocatalysis has been emerged as a sustainable green synthetic approach for the synthesis of organic compounds. The present manuscript demonstrates the development of functionalized benzofuran by using various NPs. Moreover, the mechanistic part of nanocatalysis also have been discussed.








Abstract
Due to vivid challenges for the synthesis of heterocyclic compounds such as maximizing efficiency, high yield, controlled&#8208; stereochemistry, high purity, and ecofriendly synthetic methods, nanomaterials, and nanocatalysis have gained much attention as highly efficient alternatives to conventional materials. Herein, the development of functionalized benzofuran by using sustainable green synthetic approaches, for instance, nanomaterial&#8208;based catalysis in presence of novel metal nanoparticles (NPs), bimetallic NPs, graphene&#8208;supported metals, metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs), and porous organic polymers (POPs) have been demonstrated. Moreover, the role of nanomaterials, mechanistic approaches during the catalysis and advantages of nanocatalysis over conventional methods have also been discussed.

         <title>Cyclic Tetraindoles With a Cyclooctatetraene Core: Controlling Planarity and Antiaromatic Character via N&#8208;Alkylation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report cyclic tetraindole derivatives incorporating a central cyclooctatetraene (COT) ring, where molecular distortion is tuned by N&#8208;alkylation. Increasing planarity through ethylene linkers enhances &#960;&#8208;conjugation and antiaromaticity, accompanied by red&#8208;shifted absorption, lower oxidation potentials, and a reduced HOMO&#8211;LUMO gap, providing insights into structure&#8208;property relationships in antiaromatic &#960;&#8208;systems.








Abstract
Cyclooctatetraene (COT), a representative 4n &#960;&#8208;electronic system, typically exhibits nonaromatic character in highly twisted structures, but planarization significantly alters its electronic properties, increasing antiaromaticity. Therefore, investigations on the structure&#8208;property relationships of COT derivatives are essential for the development of future functional materials. In this study, we have developed a series of cyclic tetraindoles possessing a central COT ring. The degree of molecular distortion can be controlled by N&#8208;alkylation. Specifically, substitution of the N&#8208;butyl groups increased the distortion, while the structural fixation by ethylene linkers enhanced its planarity. As planarity increased, a noticeable red&#8208;shift in the absorption wavelength, a decrease in oxidation potential, and a reduction in the HOMO&#8208;LUMO gap were observed. These results can be attributed to the more effective conjugation of the COT ring with increased planarity, which led to an enhancement of the antiaromaticity.

         <title>Enhanced i&#8208;Motif Stability through Consecutive 2&#8242;,2&#8242;&#8208;Difluorocytidine Incorporation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Gemcitabine (dFdC) is a unique nucleoside containing two fluorine atoms at the 2&#8242;&#8208;position. Using circular dichroism (CD) and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, we discovered that consecutive dFdC confer remarkable thermal and pH i&#8208;motif stability. In particular, the molecular surface of the fully modified human vertebrate i&#8208;motif structure shows the confluence of the fluorine atoms in green, which contributes to the overall stabilisation.








Abstract
Chemical modifications of nucleic acids are widely used to tune stability and functionality in therapeutic and nanotechnological applications. Among these, fluorinated cytidine derivatives such as 2&#8242;&#8208;fluoro&#8208;arabinocytidine (2&#8242;F&#8208;araC) and 2&#8242;&#8208;fluoro&#8208;ribocytidine (2&#8242;F&#8208;riboC) have been shown to influence i&#8208;motif structures differently, with 2&#8242;F&#8208;araC strongly stabilizing and 2&#8242;F&#8208;riboC exerting a mildly deleterious effect. In this study, we investigate the impact of gemcitabine (2&#8242;&#8208;deoxy&#8208;2&#8242;,2&#8242;&#8208;difluorocytidine, dFdC) on i&#8208;motif stability. dFdC exhibits small effects in single or double substituted sequences, but a pronounced stabilization when multiple consecutive residues are incorporated. Thermal and pH&#8208;dependent analyses demonstrate that sequences containing fully substituted dFdC maintain i&#8208;motif folding at neutral pH and show enhanced thermal stability. Structural insights suggest that this stabilization arises from a combination of factors, such as hyperconjugative interactions, hydrogen bonding, and dipole alignment, while the adaptable sugar conformation mitigates destabilizing minor groove contacts observed in other more rigid modifications, such as 2&#8242;&#8208;F&#8208;riboC. Cooperative interactions among adjacent dFdC residues and potential changes in hydration may play a key factor in reinforcing stability. These results highlight the unique capacity of dFdC to enhance i&#8208;motif robustness and suggest that strategically placed difluoro substitutions can be exploited to design i&#8208;motifs with improved stability, expanding their potential in biotechnology and therapeutic applications.

         <title>To What Extent a Synthetic Strategy Can Influence the Structure, Molecular Dynamics, and Biological Properties of Cyclic Tryptophan Cage Miniproteins</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cyclic peptides are a powerful class of compounds with significant applications in both bio&#8208;logical research and medical therapy. Most of the known cyclic peptides of therapeutic importance are isolated from natural sources. In this paper, we show how the first&#8208;order structure of a precursor containing exactly the same amino acids sequence, but organized in the opposite order after macrocyclization, can alter the physicochemical properties.








Abstract
This paper presents structural and biological studies of two cyclic oligopeptides obtained as a result of macrocyclization of linear precursors containing the same amino acid composition, but arranged in reverse order. The first of them with an amino acid sequence (G1D2A3Y4A5Q6W7L8A9D10G11G12P13S14S15G16R17P18P19P20S21G22&#8208;) belongs to a group of oligopeptides known in the literature as Tryptophan Cage (Trp_C), often used as models to test and understand the mechanism of protein folding. The knowledge about second precursor (&#8208;G1S2P3P4P5R6G7S8S9P10G11G12D13A14L15W16Q17A18 Y19A20D21G22&#8208;) is not so extensive. The cyclic forms of both compounds labeled as cTrp_C and Inv&#8208;cTrp_C were studied by mass spectrometry (ESI MS and ESI MS/MS), electronic circular dichroism (ECD) and 1D and 2D NMR spectroscopy. ECD and NMR measurements were performed in a different solvents and a wide temperature range. The experimental data clearly demonstrated differences in thermal stability and conformational changes for the two samples. The nature and mechanism of these changes were investigated by means of Molecular Dynamics calculations. Theoretical studies have shown that for cTrp_C and Inv&#8208;cTrp_C the length and structure of the &#945;$\alpha$&#8208;helix, which is the core stabilizing the geometry of cyclic oligopeptides, are different. In the case of Inv&#8208;cTrp_C, two edge models with a indole ring of tryptophan (W16) inside the cage (Inv&#8208;cTrp_C1) and outside the cage (Inv&#8208;cTrp_C2) are postulated. Based on theoretical calculations, it is speculated that the formation of these two structures is due to the large&#8208;amplitude reorientation of the unstructured chain around the &#945;$\alpha$&#8208;helix.

         <title>Sc(III) Complexes of Pyclen Derivative Ligands as Probes for Hypoxia: Synthesis, Chemical Characterization, 44Sc&#8208;Radiolabeling, and Preclinical Assessment</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hypoxia&#8208;sensitive nitroimidazole&#8208;functionalized pyclen derivatives were successfully synthesized and radiolabeled with 44Sc(III), affording stable and inert scandium complexes. Remarkable Sc(III)&#8208;binding capabilities of the PC2A&#8208;mono(amide) platform enabled excellent radiolabeling performance, with &#8805;92&#8211;99% yields and &#8805;99% radiochemical purity. MicroPET studies confirmed efficient tumor accumulation, with the PC2A&#8208;Ph&#8208;NI derivative exhibiting superior biodistribution and tumor&#8208;to&#8208;background ratios, highlighting its potential as a diagnostic radiopharmaceutical.








Abstract
Rigid pyclen derivative ligands bearing hypoxia&#8208;sensitive nitroimidazole (NI) pendants, PC2A&#8208;Ph&#8208;NI (hexadentate) and PC2AM&#8208;NI (heptadentate), were synthesized, radiolabeled with 44Sc(III), and evaluated under preclinical circumstances. Physicochemical characterization was carried out using the structurally related model ligand, PC2AMnBu, by multinuclear NMR, UV&#8208;Vis spectroscopy, and pH&#8208;potentiometry. Sc(III) ion was found to form a stable complex with PC2AMnBu (log KScL&#160;=&#160;19.53(4); pSc&#160;=&#160;19.32), in a reasonably fast reaction, with outstanding inertness (t1/2 = 529&#160;hours in 1&#160;M HClO4). The [Sc(PC2AMnBu)]+ complex can coordinate fluoride (log KScLF&#160;=&#160;2.5(2)), and the ternary complex is remarkably inert against fluoride exchange. Based on these results, the PC2A&#8208;mono(amide) platform seems to be a promising Sc(III)&#8208;binder, paving the way for the labeling of NI&#8208;containing ligands with 44Sc(III). Followed by successful radiolabeling with the positron&#8208;emitting 44Sc isotope, labeling yields of 92% and over 99% were evidenced for [44Sc][Sc(PC2AM&#8208;NI)]+ and [44Sc][Sc(PC2A&#8208;Ph&#8208;NI)]+; respectively, at 95 &#176;C and 15&#160;minutes; moreover, after purification, the radiochemical purity exceeded 99%. Both radiocomplexes remained stable in rat blood serum for at least 4 hours and exhibited high resistance toward transmetalation and transchelation processes. MicroPET imaging with preclinical models of B16&#8208;F10 mouse melanoma was conducted to assess the tumor targeting capability and the in vivo biodistribution pattern of [44Sc][Sc(PC2AM&#8208;NI)] and [44Sc][Sc(PC2A&#8208;Ph&#8208;NI)]+ radiopharmaceuticals. Given the higher tumor uptakes of [44Sc][Sc(PC2A&#8208;Ph&#8208;NI)]+ with decreasing off&#8208;target activity and related better tumor/noise ratios, we may conclude that the diagnostic potential of the PC2A&#8208;Ph&#8208;NI derivative outperforms that of the [44Sc][Sc(PC2AM&#8208;NI)]+.

Sc(III) ion was found to form a stable complex with PC2AM&lt;sup&gt;nBu&lt;/sup&gt; (log &lt;i&gt;K&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;ScL&lt;/sub&gt;&#160;=&#160;19.53(4); pSc&#160;=&#160;19.32), in a reasonably fast reaction, with outstanding inertness (&lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;1/2&lt;/sub&gt; = 529&#160;hours in 1&#160;M HClO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;). The [Sc(PC2AM&lt;sup&gt;nBu&lt;/sup&gt;)]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; complex can coordinate fluoride (log &lt;i&gt;K&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;ScLF&lt;/sub&gt;&#160;=&#160;2.5(2)), and the ternary complex is remarkably inert against fluoride exchange. Based on these results, the PC2A-mono(amide) platform seems to be a promising Sc(III)-binder, paving the way for the labeling of NI-containing ligands with &lt;sup&gt;44&lt;/sup&gt;Sc(III). Followed by successful radiolabeling with the positron-emitting &lt;sup&gt;44&lt;/sup&gt;Sc isotope, labeling yields of 92% and over 99% were evidenced for [&lt;sup&gt;44&lt;/sup&gt;Sc][Sc(PC2AM-NI)]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and [&lt;sup&gt;44&lt;/sup&gt;Sc][Sc(PC2A-Ph-NI)]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;; respectively, at 95 &#176;C and 15&#160;minutes; moreover, after purification, the radiochemical purity exceeded 99%. Both radiocomplexes remained stable in rat blood serum for at least 4 hours and exhibited high resistance toward transmetalation and transchelation processes. MicroPET imaging with preclinical models of B16-F10 mouse melanoma was conducted to assess the tumor targeting capability and the in vivo biodistribution pattern of [&lt;sup&gt;44&lt;/sup&gt;Sc][Sc(PC2AM-NI)] and [&lt;sup&gt;44&lt;/sup&gt;Sc][Sc(PC2A-Ph-NI)]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; radiopharmaceuticals. Given the higher tumor uptakes of [&lt;sup&gt;44&lt;/sup&gt;Sc][Sc(PC2A-Ph-NI)]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; with decreasing off-target activity and related better tumor/noise ratios, we may conclude that the diagnostic potential of the PC2A-Ph-NI derivative outperforms that of the [&lt;sup&gt;44&lt;/sup&gt;Sc][Sc(PC2AM-NI)]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Selective Recognition of Physiological Phosphates by Luminescent Europium(III) Probes via Analyte&#8208;Specific Energy&#8208;Transfer Pathways</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synopsis: Time&#8208;resolved luminescent Eu(III) probes, [Eu.L1] and [Eu.L2], can discriminate Pi and NPPs in H2O based on their differential binding interaction triggered by analyte&#8208;specific energy&#8208;transfer pathways.








Abstract
The physiological phosphates (PPs) are crucial in various biochemical pathways and bioenergetics. Their dysregulation is associated with multiple cellular dysfunctions and life&#8208;threatening diseases. Designing sensitive and selective bioresponsive probes capable of differentiating Pi/NPPs levels is crucial for diagnostics and therapy. Developing probes for selective discrimination of phosphates faces intrinsic challenges due to their high hydration energy (&#916;Ghyd) barrier and structural similarity. The hard Ln(III) ions can overcome the high &#916;Ghyd barrier and are ideal for the detection and discrimination of PPs due to their longer lifetimes, using time&#8208;resolved luminescence (TRL) assays. Herein, two water&#8208;soluble luminescent Eu(III) probes, [Eu.L1] and [Eu.L2], can discriminate physiological inorganic (Pi) and nucleoside polyphosphates (NPPs) in H2O based on their differential binding interaction with the respective probe, triggering analyte&#8208;specific energy&#8208;transfer pathways. We established the involvement of coordinative unsaturation and &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking interaction between the [Eu.L] probes and PPs, which modulates the nonradiative vibrational energy transfer (VET) and photo&#8208;induced electron transfer (PeT) pathways, responsible for their specific luminescence response and selectivity. The interaction of phosphates with the Eu(III) probes were monitored by TRL spectroscopy, lifetime (&#964;) and hydration state (q) measurements, and 31P NMR spectroscopy. These results connect the intricate molecular interactions of the [Eu.L] probes with PPs with concomitant TRL&#8208;responses.

         <title>One&#8208;pot Modular Synthesis of Hydroquinolines, Hydrofluorenones, and Aryl Fluorenones</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fundamentally unique method for building the fluorenone skeleton via a one&#8208;pot, stereo&#8208; and regio&#8208;selective multi&#8208;bond&#8208;forming reaction of abundant starting materials is reported. Up to 8 new (C&#8208;C, and C&#8208;N) bonds, 3 cycles, and up to 4 stereocenters were built in a single operation with exclusive stereo and regioselectivity. The resulting aryl fluorenone was transformed to spirobifluorenes, which exhibit high potential as host materials for PhOLEDs.








Abstract
Many natural products and bioactive molecules are built on hydroquinolines, hydrofluorenones, and fluorenones. In addition, aryl fluorenones and their derivatives, such as spirobifluorene, are widely used as a key molecular framework for the development of organic electronic materials. The synthesis of aryl fluorenones relies on multiple steps involving at least two transition metal&#8208;catalyzed C(sp2)&#8208;C(sp2) coupling reactions to build the fluorenone ring, which impede the easy accessibility of these materials for academic research and follow&#8208;up practical applications. Herein, we report a fundamentally unique method to build the fluorenone skeleton via a one&#8208;pot reaction under metal&#8208;free conditions. The method relies on the formation of hydroquinolines and hydrofluorenones via a diastereo&#8208; and regio&#8208;selective multi&#8208;bond forming reaction of feedstock chemicals. Up to 8 new (C&#8208;C, C&#8208;N, and C&#8208;O) bonds, 3 cycles, and up to 4 stereocenters were built in a single operation with exclusive diastereo and regioselectivity. DFT studies provided insights into the diastereo&#8208; and regioselectivity of this reaction. The aryl groups of aryl fluorenones, which are generally installed via transition metal&#8208;catalyzed coupling reaction of pre&#8208;functionalized arene moiety, are incorporated from readily available aryl aldehyde under metal&#8208;free conditions. The spirobifluorenes derived from these arylated fluorenones showed to have appropriate triplet energy, HOMO/LUMO levels, and thermal stability which indicate their potential as a host material for PhOLED.

         <title>A Redox&#8208;Tunable Carborane Crown: Toward Highly Selective Electrochemical Lithium Capture</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrochemical reduction transforms a new carborane&#8211;crown into a potent 2e&#8722; reduced nido anion with a redox&#8208;tunable cavity that captures Li&#8314; selectively over Na&#8314; and K&#8314;. The coupling of electronic control and size&#8208;matched binding offers a blueprint for selective, rapid lithium recovery for next&#8208;generation direct lithium extraction.








Abstract
Lithium is a critical element with a projected exponential rise in demand due to its widespread use in battery energy storage. New methods to extract Li+, such as through membrane adsorption&#8208;based direct Li+ extraction (DLE) technologies, are at various stages of development and aim to separate Li+ from brine and even seawater. In this report, we present a fundamentally new class of highly selective Li+&#8208;capture agent, the carborane&#8208;crown compound, 1,2&#8208;((6,6,7,7&#8208;Me4)14&#8208;crown&#8208;4)&#8208;ortho&#8208;carborane (14C4Cb), which is electrochemically activated for strong, selective Li+ binding over Na+ and K+. This newly synthesized extractant features a redox&#8208;tunable cavity size, giving rise to tunable binding constants for Li+ capture, favorable coulombic interactions between the reduced anionic capture agent and the Li+ cations, and boasts the benefit of rapid, electrochemically driven capture kinetics. Weak, negligible binding to Li+ was observed in the neutral &#8220;closo&#8221; carborane state (14C4Cb), whereas strong binding was observed in the cage&#8208;opened reduced nido state (14C4Cb2&#8722;). Equilibrium (K) binding constants were measured through experimental and simulated voltammetry, yielding the following log Kmetal (experimental; simulation) values: log KLi (6.8&#160;&#177;&#160;0.6; 8.0), log KNa (3.7&#160;&#177;&#160;0.2; 4.9), log KK (1.7&#160;&#177;&#160;0.2; 2.2). Rapid mass transport of Li+ to the electrode surface resulted in the simulated value (log KLi&#160;=&#160;8.0) representing a lower&#8208;limit value for log KLi as described herein. The observed strong binding to Li+ over Na+ and K+ is attributed to both the favorable redox&#8208;tunable crown cavity size of the 14C4Cb/14C4Cb2&#8722; couple, combined with strong coulombic interactions in the reduced nido state. This platform offers a potential new, rapid, and highly selective technique for Li+ capture in next&#8208;generation electrochemical DLE technologies.

         <title>Monosaccharide&#8208;Derived Enantioselectivity in SWCNT Chemoresistive VOC Sensing</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enantioselective sensing of minimally functionalized chiral VOCs with common recognition layers remains challenging. A chemoresistive sensor based on semiconducting single&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes modified with multichiral and multifunctional substituted monosaccharides displays intriguing chiral preference toward (&#8211;)&#8208;limonene and (&#8211;)&#8208;carvone enantiomers. A novel class of tunable substituted monosaccharide&#8208;based eNoses is envisioned.








Abstract
Semiconducting single&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes (sc&#8208;SWCNTs) are of great potential for vapor sensing. However, sc&#8208;SWCNTs lack recognition features for discriminating between sparsely functionalized moieties, molecules with similar structural features, and enantiomer pairs. This becomes a major setback in discriminating between volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Here, we used two galactosides decorated with aromatic groups as a recognition layer in chemoresistive sc&#8208;SWCNT sensors to produce chiral preference toward six terpenoid enantiomers. The multichirality and multifunctionality of a monosaccharide scaffold were exploited to maximize the limited interacting features associated with VOCs. The developed system establishes a robust and tunable platform for enantioselective gas sensing.

         <title>In Situ Observation of Polyoxometalate Formation by Vibrational Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In&#8208;situ IR and Raman spectroscopy were employed to observe the formation of polyoxometalates (POMs) in aqueous solution. Thereby key intermediates were identified, and better understanding of POM formation enabled the development of an improved method for the synthesis of vanadium&#8208;substituted phosphomolybdates, which are important catalysts for sustainable applications. The findings streamline POM synthesis procedures by reducing energy input and shortening reaction times.








Abstract
Polyoxometalates (POMs) are multinuclear clusters of transition metals and oxo&#8208;ligands. They have a long history and are still gaining an increased relevance for diverse applications, such as sustainable catalysis. Although the first examples were discovered over a century ago, little is known about the process of their formation. We have now employed modern in situ IR and Raman techniques to gain insights into the processes of the formation of different POM structures in aqueous solution. Thereby, we were able to identify intermediates and optimize reaction conditions. We found that POM formation proceeds very rapidly even at low temperatures, making it unnecessary to reflux the synthesis solutions for multiple hours. With this knowledge, we developed an improved synthetic method for vanadium&#8208;substituted phosphomolybdates, which are of high relevance for sustainable catalysis.

         <title>Bio&#8208;Based Amphiphilic Farnesyl Glycidyl Ether Block Copolymers: Aqueous Self&#8208;Assembly and Solubilization Boosting</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bio&#8208;derived amphiphilic poly(ethylene glycol)&#8208;b&#8208;poly(terpenyl glycidyl ether) diblock copolymers (mPEG114&#8208;b&#8208;PTGEm) were synthesized via AROP from farnesyl glycidyl ether (FarGE) and its hexahydrogenated derivative (HHFarGE). Block copolymer amphiphilicity is easily tunable via the TGE block size m and systematically affects the critical micelle concentration. Adding even small amounts of mPEG114&#8208;b&#8208;PTGEm to microemulsions leads to a significant increase of the solubilization efficiency.








Abstract
Sustainability has become essential in addressing the substitution of depleting fossil&#8208;based resources with bio&#8208;renewable alternatives, including products active at interfaces, such as surfactants. Enhancing their efficiency reduces both ecological and economic impact. Here, we present amphiphilic poly(ethylene glycol)&#8208;b&#8208;poly(terpenyl glycidyl ether) diblock copolymers synthesized via anionic ring&#8208;opening polymerization from two terpenyl glycidyl ethers (TGE) based on the naturally occurring terpenoid farnesol, farnesyl glycidyl ether (FarGE), and its hydrogenated derivative hexahydrofarnesyl glycidyl ether (HHFarGE). Using poly(ethylene glycol) monomethyl ether (mPEG114) as a macroinitiator resulted in controlled molecular weights (5600 &#8211; 8400 g&#183;mol&#8722;1) with low dispersities&#160;&#272; (1.04&#8211;1.07). Fluorescence spectroscopy and light scattering revealed low critical micelle concentrations with a systematic decrease with increasing TGE block size due to the hydrophobic effect. The addition of small amounts of mPEG114&#8208;b&#8208;PTGEm to microemulsions leads to a significant increase of the solubilization efficiency not limited to conventional H2O/NaCl &#8211; n&#8208;decane &#8211; tetraethylene glycol monodecyl ether microemulsions, but also in sustainable H2O &#8211; isopropyl myristate &#8211; n&#8208;octyl &#946;&#8208;D&#8208;glucopyranoside &#8211; farnesol formulations, serving as model systems for cosmetic applications. Using SANS, we observed that adsorption of the copolymer at the amphiphilic film leads to an increased structural order of bicontinuous microemulsions due to a higher film bending rigidity.

         <title>Synthesis and Characterization of [MF5(terpy)]+ (M&#160;=&#160;Mo, W) Salts: Autoionization of MF6 Induced by a Tridentate Ligand</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The hexafluorides MoF6 and WF6 autoionize in the presence of the tridentate terpyridine ligand, yielding [MF5(terpy)]+[MF7]&#8211; (M&#160;=&#160;Mo, W). The octacoordinated [MF5(terpy)]+ cations adopt bicapped trigonal prismatic geometries. The [WF7]&#8211; can be substituted for [SbF6]&#8211; using SbF5SO2, whereas the reaction was unsuccessful for displacing the [MoF7]&#8211; anion. The M&#9472;N bond has substantial covalent character, with the Wiberg bond indices (WBIs) being more than half of those of the M&#9472;F bonds.








Abstract
The reactions of the hexafluorides MoF6 and WF6 with the tridentate ligand terpyridine (terpy) result in autoionization forming [MF5(terpy)][MF7] (M&#160;=&#160;Mo, W) salts. Displacement of [WF7]&#8211; utilizing SbF5, yielded [WF5(terpy)][SbF6]. The octacoordinate [MF5(terpy)]+ cations adopt a bicapped trigonal prismatic geometry based on X&#8208;ray crystallography and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, which is different than the geometry of previously reported fluorido WVI cations. The [MoF5(terpy)]+ cation represents the first fluorido MoVI cation.

         <title>High&#8208;Affinity Peptide&#8208;Drug Conjugate Ligands for the TRIM24 PHD and Bromodomain</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a series of bivalent peptide&#8208;drug conjugate (PDC) ligands for tripartite motif&#8208;containing protein 24 (TRIM24). These ligands simultaneously engage the PHD and BRD of TRIM24 through an intramolecular (in cis) binding mode, resulting in high affinity binding. By incorporating a trimethyllysine (KMe3) mimic and a BRD ligand, these PDCs can disrupt the multivalent chromatin interactions of TRIM24, resulting in complete inhibition of its epigenetic reader function.








Abstract
TRIM24 is an epigenetic transcriptional coregulator that &#8220;reads&#8221; KMe3 and KAc histone modifications via its tandem plant homeodomain (PHD) and bromodomain (BRD), respectively. The PHD and BRD are potential therapeutic targets due to the roles of TRIM24 in breast cancer progression. However, there are currently no small&#8208;molecule ligands for the PHD, and existing TRIM24 BRD inhibitors lack selectivity over the main off&#8208;target, BRPF1. Here, we report the development of the first bivalent tool molecules capable of simultaneously engaging both the TRIM24 PHD and BRD. Key to this strategy was the identification of effective KMe3 bioisosteres that enhance H3 peptide binding to the TRIM24 PHD.

     alt="High-Affinity Peptide-Drug Conjugate Ligands for the TRIM24 PHD and Bromodomain"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We report a series of bivalent peptide-drug conjugate (PDC) ligands for tripartite motif-containing protein 24 (TRIM24). These ligands simultaneously engage the PHD and BRD of TRIM24 through an intramolecular (&lt;i&gt;in cis&lt;/i&gt;) binding mode, resulting in high affinity binding. By incorporating a trimethyllysine (KMe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) mimic and a BRD ligand, these PDCs can disrupt the multivalent chromatin interactions of TRIM24, resulting in complete inhibition of its epigenetic reader function.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TRIM24 is an epigenetic transcriptional coregulator that &#8220;reads&#8221; KMe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and KAc histone modifications via its tandem plant homeodomain (PHD) and bromodomain (BRD), respectively. The PHD and BRD are potential therapeutic targets due to the roles of TRIM24 in breast cancer progression. However, there are currently no small-molecule ligands for the PHD, and existing TRIM24 BRD inhibitors lack selectivity over the main off-target, BRPF1. Here, we report the development of the first bivalent tool molecules capable of simultaneously engaging both the TRIM24 PHD and BRD. Key to this strategy was the identification of effective KMe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; bioisosteres that enhance H3 peptide binding to the TRIM24 PHD. The most promising of these was incorporated into a nine amino acid H3-mimicking peptide, and linked to a TRIM24 BRD ligand. The resulting peptide-drug conjugates (PDCs) bind to TRIM24 with picomolar affinity and a slow dissociation rate (&lt;i&gt;k&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;off&lt;/sub&gt;), which is driven by an &lt;i&gt;in cis&lt;/i&gt; bivalent binding mode. Although the PDCs showed limited effects on breast cancer cell proliferation in vitro, this work underscores their potential as tools for studying previously unliganded reader domains and consequently advancing our understanding of multivalent epigenetic regulation in disease.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Systematic Determination of Structure&#8208;Activity&#8208;Selectivity Correlations for the Catalytic Oxidation of Glucose to Acetic Acid Depending on the Structure Type of the Used Polyoxometalate Catalyst</title>

Herein, we investigate in detail the influence of different polyoxometalate structure types on the reaction pathways and kinetics for the selective catalytic oxidation of glucose to acetic acid.








Abstract
The BioValCat (Enhanced Biomass Valorization by Engineering of Polyoxometalate Catalysts) project aims for developing homogeneously catalyzed, selective biomass transformation techniques toward an industrially viable biomass valorization process. The present study sets out the foundations for a scalable, safe, and economic procedure for the oxidation of biomass to valuable products. The extension of the product scope to higher carboxylic acids is of great interest. Herein, we investigate in detail the influence of different polyoxometalate (POM) structure types on the reaction pathways and kinetics for the selective catalytic oxidation of glucose to acetic acid (AA). The results have shown severe structure&#8208;selectivity relationships depending on the used POM structure type. Whereas Lindqvist and Anderson&#8208;Evans structures promote the [C3&#160;+&#160;C3] pathway leading to high AA yields above 20%, Keggin and Wells&#8208;Dawson structures are more inclined to follow the [C1&#160;+&#160;C5] pathway, resulting mainly in levulinic acid formation. With respect to kinetics, the Anderson&#8208;type Na9TeV3W3O24 catalyst showed the highest reaction rate amongst all POMs with 32.62&#160;mmol L&#8722;1 min&#8722;1, followed by the Lindqvist&#8208;type Na5V3W3O19 with 27.26&#160;mmol L&#8722;1 min&#8722;1, the Keggin&#8208;type Na6PV3W9O40 with 21.50&#160;mmol L&#8722;1 min&#8722;1 and the Wells&#8208;Dawson&#8208;type Na9P2V3W15O62 with a reaction rate of only 14.50&#160;mmol L&#8722;1 min&#8722;1. Overall, the results demonstrate that the reaction pathways and efficiencies in the catalytic oxidation of glucose vary significantly among POMs with different structure types. These findings provide a basis for optimizing the application of POMs in biomass valorization reactions and suggest potential directions for developing more efficient catalysts in the near future.

         <title>Nb&#8208;Promoted Pt/MoOx/TiO2 Catalysts for Low&#8208;Temperature CO2 Hydrogenation to Methanol</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nb&#8208;promoted Pt/MoOx/TiO2 catalysts displayed enhanced methanol formation from CO2 hydrogenation at low temperature (STYMeOH&#160;=&#160;3.8&#160;mmol gcat&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 at 150&#160;&#176;C). Mechanistic study revealed that all components are essential for methanol production.








Abstract
The catalytic hydrogenation of carbon dioxide (CO2) to methanol under mild conditions presents a sustainable route for carbon recycling and chemical energy storage. However, the inert nature of CO2 and high activation energy barrier for methanol formation remain major challenges. In this study, we developed a series of Nb&#8208;promoted Pt/MoOx/TiO2 catalysts for efficient CO2 hydrogenation at temperatures below 200&#160;&#176;C. Among these, Pt(5)/Mo(10)&#8208;Nb(1)/TiO2 exhibited superior performance, achieving a high methanol productivity of 3.8&#160;mmol gcat&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 at 150&#160;&#176;C, outperforming the commercial Cu&#8208;ZnO/Al2O3 catalyst under comparable conditions. The catalyst showed stable performance during a 400&#160;h long&#8208;term reaction. Detailed in situ and operando spectroscopic studies revealed that Pt sites were primarily responsible for H2 activation, while partially reduced MoOx species facilitated the formation of oxygenated intermediates. The incorporation of highly dispersed Nb species promoted methanol desorption and inhibited its decomposition, thereby contributing to the overall catalytic efficiency. This study outlines a rational design approach for constructing robust low&#8208;temperature catalysts and provides mechanistic insights into the synergistic roles of the metal and oxide components in CO2&#8208;to&#8208;methanol conversion.

         <title>Size&#8208;Controlled Cobalt Nanoplates and Their Impact on Oxygen Evolution Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cobalt nanoplate nanoparticles with controlled diameter size are presented to enhance catalytic activity for the oxygen evolution reaction. This improvement is attributed to a high proportion of {101&#175;$\bar 1$1} surface facets and the presence of defects such as step&#8208;edges and stacking faults.








Abstract
Controlling the size of nanoparticles is important in catalytic reactions, not only for tuning the surface area but also for modifying the electronic structure. However, achieving precise size control in 2D structures remains challenging. In this work, we demonstrate precise size control of cobalt nanoplates, ranging from 19&#160;nm to 80&#160;nm, which is achieved by tuning the ratio of two surfactants used in the synthesis. The 19&#160;nm of Co nanoplates exhibit higher oxygen evolution reaction activity due to a higher proportion of {101&#175;$\bar 1$1} to {0001} facets. This size control allows systematic investigation into how nanoplate dimensions influence catalytic performance in the oxygen evolution reaction, offering new insights into structure&#8208;activity relationships of cobalt nanocatalysts.

         <dc:description>

Abstract
The sulfenylative N&#8208;glycosylation of glycals, which exhibits high &#946;&#8208;stereoselectivity, has been successfully developed for the first time under the facilitating effect of hexafluoroisopropanol (HFIP). This method is broadly applicable to four classes of nitrogen nucleophiles, including sulfamides, carbamates, ureas, and azoles. Furthermore, various glycal derivatives, such as D&#8208;galactal, D&#8208;arabinal, L&#8208;fucal, and D&#8208;glucal, can be effectively employed in this reaction system. A range of 2&#8208;phenylthio&#8208;N&#8208;glycosides were obtained in moderate to good yields with consistently high &#946;&#8208;selectivity (&#946;:&#945; &gt; 20:1). Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal the origin of the observed stereoselectivity and highlight the critical role of HFIP in promoting the glycosylation process.

A range of 2-phenylthio-&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-glycosides were obtained in moderate to good yields with consistently high &#946;-selectivity (&#946;:&#945; &amp;gt; 20:1). Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal the origin of the observed stereoselectivity and highlight the critical role of HFIP in promoting the glycosylation process.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>
