      <title>In situ growth of ultrafine Pt nanoparticles onto hierarchical Co3O4 nanosheet&#8208;assembled microflowers for efficient electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution</title>
      <dc:description>The development of Pt&#8208;based electrocatalysts with high Pt utilization efficiency toward the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is of great significance for the future sustainable hydrogen economy. For rational design of high&#8208;performance HER electrocatalyst, the simultaneous consideration of both thermodynamic and kinetic aspects remains greatly challenging.

The elaborate preparation of such intriguing hierarchical architecture with well&#8208;dispersed tiny Pt nanoparticles, abundant metal/oxide heterointerfaces and open configuration endows the formed Pt/Co3O4 microflowers with high Pt utilization efficiency, rich active sites, lowered energy barrier for water dissociation and expedited reaction kinetics. Consequently, the Pt/Co3O4 microflowers exhibit superior HER activity with a relatively low overpotential of 34 mV to deliver a current density of 10 mA cm&#8208;2, small Tafel slope (34 mV dec&#8208;1) and outstanding electrochemical stability, representing an attractive electrocatalyst for practical water splitting.

      <title>Symmetry Effects in Photoinduced Electron Transfer in Chlorin&#8208;Quinone Dyads: Adiabatic Suppression in the Marcus Inverted Region</title>
      <dc:description>In donor acceptor dyads undergoing photoinduced electron transfer (PET), a direction or pathway for electron movement is usually dictated by the redox properties and the separation distance between the donor and acceptor subunits, while the effect of symmetry is less recognized. We have designed and synthesized two isomeric donor&#8208;acceptor assemblies in which electronic coupling between donor and acceptor is switched on/off by the orbital symmetry control with the reorganization energy and charge transfer exothermicity being kept unchanged. Analysis of the optical absorption and luminescence spectra, supported by the DFT and TD&#8208;DFT calculations, showed that PET in these assemblies corresponds to the Marcus inverted region (MIR) and has larger rate for isomer with weaker electronic coupling. This surprising observation provides the first experimental evidence for theoretically predicted adiabatic suppression of PET in MIR.</dc:description>

      <title>Functionalization of N2&#160;via Formal 1,3&#8208;Haloboration of a Tungsten(0) &#963;&#8208;Dinitrogen Complex</title>
      <dc:description>Boron tribromide and aryldihaloboranes were found to undergo 1,3&#8208;haloboration across one W&#8211;N&#8801;N moiety of a group 6 end&#8208;on dinitrogen complex (  i.e. trans  &#8208;[W(N2)2(dppe)2]). The N&#8208;borylated products consist of a reduced diazenido unit sandwiched between a W(II) center and a trivalent boron substituent (W&#8211;N=N&#8211;BXAr), and have all been fully characterized by NMR and IR spectroscopy, elemental analysis, and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. Both the terminal N atom and boron center in the W&#8211;N=N&#8211;BXAr unit can be further derivatized using electrophiles and nucleophiles/Lewis bases, respectively. This mild reduction and functionalization of a weakly activated N  2  ligand with boron halides is unprecedented, and hints at the possibility of generating value&#8208;added nitrogen compounds directly from molecular dinitrogen.</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Boron tribromide and aryldihaloboranes were found to undergo 1,3&#8208;haloboration across one W&#8211;N&#8801;N moiety of a group 6 end&#8208;on dinitrogen complex (  i.e. trans  &#8208;[W(N2)2(dppe)2]). The N&#8208;borylated products consist of a reduced diazenido unit sandwiched between a W(II) center and a trivalent boron substituent (W&#8211;N=N&#8211;BXAr), and have all been fully characterized by NMR and IR spectroscopy, elemental analysis, and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. Both the terminal N atom and boron center in the W&#8211;N=N&#8211;BXAr unit can be further derivatized using electrophiles and nucleophiles/Lewis bases, respectively. This mild reduction and functionalization of a weakly activated N  2  ligand with boron halides is unprecedented, and hints at the possibility of generating value&#8208;added nitrogen compounds directly from molecular dinitrogen.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Highlights on the binding of cobalta&#8208;bis&#8208;(dicarbollide) with glucose units</title>
      <dc:description>Metalla&#8208;bis&#8208;dicarbollides, such as the COSAN anion [Co(C 2  B 9  H 11  ) 2  ] &#8208;  , have attracted much attention in biology but there is a lack of understanding of their interactions with cell&#8208;components. For this purpose, we studied the interactions of COSAN with carbohydrate moieties that are ubiquitous in biological processes in bulk media and at interfaces. Octyl&#8208;glucopyranoside surfactant (C8G1) has been chosen as a sugar based model that self&#8208;assembles into micelles creating a glucose covered interface with water. COSAN was found to adsorb onto C8G1 micelles at low COSAN contents and to disrupt C8G1 micelles into mixed COSAN&#8208;C8G1 aggregates at high COSAN contents. COSAN interact mainly through (i) the hydrophobic effect with C8G1 monomers and (ii) the superchaotropic effect, i.e. with a thermodynamically favorable dehydration of the sugar moieties and of the COSAN, with sugars in a collective manner at the micellar surface and with linear&#8208;oligosaccharides with possible di&#8208;hydrogen bond formation.</dc:description>

      <title>Engineering Boron Hot Spots for the Site&#8208;Selective Installation of Iminoboronates on Peptide Chains</title>
      <dc:description>Boronic acids (BAs) are a promising bioconjugation function to design dynamic materials as they can establish reversible covalent bonds with oxygen/nitrogen nucleophiles that respond to different pH, ROS, carbohydrates and glutathione levels. However, the dynamic nature of these bonds also limits the control over the stability and site&#8208;selectivity of the bioconjugation, which ultimately leads to heterogeneous conjugates with poor stability under physiological conditions. Here we disclose a new strategy to install BAs on peptide chains. In this study, a &#8220;Boron Hot Spot&#8221; based on the 3&#8208;hydroxyquinolin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;one scaffold was developed and upon installation on a peptide N&#8208;terminal cysteine, enables the site&#8208;selective formation of iminoboronates with 2&#8208;formyl&#8208;phenyl boronic acids (Ka of 58128 &#177; 2 M&#8208;1). The reaction is selective in the presence of competing lysine &#949;&#8208;amino groups, and the resulting iminoboronates, displayed improved stability in buffers solutions and a cleavable profile in the presence of glutathione. Once developed, the methodology was used to prepare cleavable fluorescent conjugates with a laminin fragment, which enabled the validation of the 67LR receptor as a target to deliver cargo to cancer HT29 cells.</dc:description>

      <title>Carnoquinolines Target Copper Dyshomeostasis, Aberrant Protein&#8208;Protein Interactions, and Oxidative Stress</title>
      <dc:description>Metal dysregulation, oxidative stress, protein modification, and aggregation are factors strictly interrelated and associated with neurodegenerative pathologies. As such, all these aspects represent valid targets to counteract neurodegeneration and, therefore, the development of metal&#8208;binding compounds with other properties to combat multifactorial disorders is definitely on the rise. Here, we report the synthesis and in&#8208;depth analysis of the first hybrids of carnosine and 8&#8208;hydroxyquinoline, Carnoquinolines (CarHQs), that combine the properties of the dipeptide with those of 8&#8208;hydroxyquinoline. CarHQs and their copper complexes were characterized through several techniques such as ESI&#8208;MS, NMR, UV&#8208;vis, and CD spectroscopy. CarHQs can modulate self&#8208; and copper&#8208;induced amyloid&#8208;&#946; aggregation. These hybrids combine the antioxidant activity of their parent compounds. Therefore, they can simultaneously scavenge free radicals and reactive carbonyl species thanks to the phenolic group and imidazole ring. These results indicate that CarHQs are promising multifunctional candidates for neurodegenerative disorders and, they are worthy of further studies.</dc:description>

      <title>In&#8208;situ self&#8208;polymerization to form hollow graphitized carbon nanocages embedded cobalt nanoparticles for high performance lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries</title>
      <dc:description>Lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries, stemming from the multi&#8208;electron participation in redox reaction, possess enormous energy density, which has aroused much attentions. Nevertheless the disgusting shuttle effect, volume expansion and electrical insulation of sulfur, have hindered their applications. To improve cyclability, a functional host consist of Co nanoparticles and N&#8208;doped hollow graphitized carbon(Co&#8208;NHGC) material are elaborated, which has advantages: (i) the graphitized carbon material works as electronic matrix improving the utilization rate of sulfur; (ii) hollow structure relieve the stress change caused by volume expansion ; (iii) the rich active sites catalyze the electrochemical reaction of sulfur and entrap polysulfides. These advantages significantly improve the performance of the lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries. Accordingly, the S@Co&#8208;NHGC cathode exhibits excellent initial specific capacity, high coulomb efficiency and excellent rate performance. This work utilize a novel method by dopamine in situ etching metal&#8208;organic&#8208;framework to synthetize the Co&#8208;NHGC host of sulfur, which will provide an idea for energy materials.</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries, stemming from the multi&#8208;electron participation in redox reaction, possess enormous energy density, which has aroused much attentions. Nevertheless the disgusting shuttle effect, volume expansion and electrical insulation of sulfur, have hindered their applications. To improve cyclability, a functional host consist of Co nanoparticles and N&#8208;doped hollow graphitized carbon(Co&#8208;NHGC) material are elaborated, which has advantages: (i) the graphitized carbon material works as electronic matrix improving the utilization rate of sulfur; (ii) hollow structure relieve the stress change caused by volume expansion ; (iii) the rich active sites catalyze the electrochemical reaction of sulfur and entrap polysulfides. These advantages significantly improve the performance of the lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries. Accordingly, the S@Co&#8208;NHGC cathode exhibits excellent initial specific capacity, high coulomb efficiency and excellent rate performance. This work utilize a novel method by dopamine in situ etching metal&#8208;organic&#8208;framework to synthetize the Co&#8208;NHGC host of sulfur, which will provide an idea for energy materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Silver(I) coordination in silver(I)&#8208;mediated homo base pairs of 6&#8208;pyrazolylpurine in DNA duplexes involves the Watson&#8208;Crick edge</title>

In 6PP and  7D  6PP, the Ag  I  ion can coordinate to the nucleobase via the endocyclic N1 nitrogen atom, i.e. via the Watson&#8208;Crick edge. In contrast, this nitrogen atom is not available in  1D  6PP and  1,7D  6PP, so that in  1D  6PP an Ag  I  coordination is only possible via the Hoogsteen edge (N7). Reference duplexes with either adenine:adenine mispairs or canonical adenine:thymine base pairs were used to investigate the impact of the pyrazolyl moiety on the Ag  I  &#8208;binding properties. To determine the thermal and structural duplex stabilities in the absence or presence of Ag  I  , all duplexes were examined by UV and circular dichroism spectroscopic studies. These investigations shed light on the question of whether N1&#8208; or N7&#8208;coordination is preferred in purine&#8208;based metal&#8208;mediated base pairs.</dc:description>

      <title>Ancillary Ligand Effects on Heteroleptic Ir(III) Dye in Dye&#8208;Sensitized Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction: Photoaccumulation of Charges on Arylated Bipyridine Ligand and Its Control on Catalytic Performance</title>
      <dc:description>Herein, we report the synthesis, and photochemical and &#8208;physical properties, as well as the catalytic performance, of a series of heteroleptic Ir(III) photosensitizers (IrPSs), [Ir(C^N)  2  (N^N  Aryl  )]  +  , possessing ancillary ligands that are varied with aryl&#8208;substituents on bipyridyl unit [C^N = (2&#8208;pyridyl)benzo[  b  ]thiophen&#8208;3&#8208;yl (btp); N^N  Aryl  = 4,4&#8242;&#8208;Y  2  &#8208;bpy (Y = &#8208;Ph or &#8208;PhSi(Ph)  3  ]. We found that the  &#960;  &#8210;extension of bipyridyl ligand by aryl&#8210;substitution put bipyridyl ligand in use as an electron relay unit that performed charge accumulation before delivering to the catalytic center, greatly improving the overall CO  2  &#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion activities. In a typical run, the aryl&#8210;substituted IrPS (  t  Bu  IrP&#8208;Ph  Si  )&#8208;sensitized homogeneous systems (IrPS + Re(I) catalyst) gave a turnover number of 1340 (&#934;  CO  = 24.2%) at the early stage of photolysis (&lt;5 h).

      <title>Nanoparticulate Conjugated Microporous Polymer with Post&#8208;Modified Benzils for Enhanced Pseudocapacitor Performance</title>
      <dc:description>Conjugated microporous polymer (CMP)&#8208;based energy storage materials were developed for pseudocapacitors. Nanoparticulate CMP (N&#8208;CMP) with an average diameter of 41 &#177; 4 nm was prepared through kinetic growth control in the Sonogashira coupling of 1,3,5&#8208;triethynylbenzene with 1,4&#8208;diiodobzene.

Through the FeCl3&#8208;catalyzed oxidation of diphenylacetylene moieties, N&#8208;CMP with benzil moieties (N&#8208;CMP&#8208;BZ) was prepared and showed enhanced electrochemical performance as an electrode material of pseudocapacitors, compared with CMP, CMP&#8208;BZ, and N&#8208;CMP&#8208;BZ. In model studies, the benzil was redox active and showed two&#8208;electron reduction behavior. The excellent electrochemical performance of N&#8208;CMP&#8208;BZ is attributable to the enhanced utilization of functional sites by a nanosize effect and the additional redox contribution of benzil moieties.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Charge&#8208;separated metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) are a unique class of MOFs that can possess added properties originating from the exposed ionic species. We report a new charge&#8208;separated MOF, namely UNM&#8208;6, synthesized from a tetrahedral borate ligand and Co 2+ cation. UNM&#8208;6 crystalizes into the highly symmetric P&#8208;43n space group with four&#8208;fold interpenetration, despite the stoichiometric imbalance between the B and Co atoms, which also leads to loosely bound NO 3 &#8722; anions within the crystal structure. These NO 3 &#8722; ions can be quantitatively exchanged with various other anions, leading to Lewis acid (Co 2+ ) and Lewis base (anions) pairs within the pores and potentially cooperative catalytic activities. For example, UNM&#8208;6&#8208;Br, the MOF after anion exchange with Br &#8722; anions, displays high catalytic activity and stability in reactions of CO 2 chemical fixation into cyclic carbonates.</dc:description>

      <title>Long&#8208;range LMCT coupling in Eu(III) coordination polymers for an effective molecular luminescent thermometer</title>
      <dc:description>A design for an effective molecular luminescent thermometer based on long&#8208;range electronic coupling in lanthanide coordination polymers is proposed. The coordination polymers are composed of lanthanide ions Eu(III) and Gd(III), three anionic ligands (hexafluoroacetylacetonate), and a chrysene&#8208;based phosphine oxide bridges (6,12&#8208;bis(diphenylphosphoryl)chrysene). The zig&#8208;zag orientation of the single polymer chains induces the formation of packed coordination structures containing multiple sites for CH&#8208;F intermolecular interactions, resulting in thermal stability above 350 &#730;C. The electronic coupling is controlled by changing the concentration of the Gd(III) ion in the Eu(III)&#8208;Gd(III) polymer. The emission quantum yield and the maximum relative temperature sensitivity (  S  m  ) of emission lifetimes for the Eu(III)&#8208;Gd(III) polymer (Eu:Gd = 1:1,  &#934;  tot  = 52%,  S  m  = 3.73% K  &#8208;1  ) were higher than those for the pure Eu(III) coordination polymer (  &#934;  tot  = 36%,  S  m  = 2.70% K  &#8208;1  ), respectively.

      <dc:description>We describe multimodal imaging probes for gastrin&#8208;releasing peptide receptor (GRPR)&#8208;specific targeting suited for positron emission tomography and optical imaging (PET/OI), consisting of PESIN (PEG3&#8208;BBN7&#8208;14) dimers connected to multimodal imaging subunits.

Special focus was put on the influence of the used dyes on the properties of the whole bioconjugates. For this, several compounds with different fluorescent dyes and non&#8208;dye carrying subunits were synthesized and investigated. As fluorescent dyes, Dansyl, NBD, derivatives of fluorescein, coumarin and rhodamine as well as three pyrilium&#8208;based dyes were employed. Considerable influence of the charge of the colored unit on hydrophilicity as well as in vitro target receptor binding was observed and classified. High radiochemical yields and purities were found during radiolabeling of the multimodal imaging subunits as well as their GRPR&#8208;specific bioconjugates with 68Ga. Examinations of the photophysical properties of both molecule species displayed no loss or alteration of fluorescence characteristics.</dc:description>

      <title>New reactivity patterns in 3H&#8208;phosphaallene chemistry [Aryl&#8208;P=C=C(H)&#8208;tBu] &#8211; hydroboration of the C=C bond, deprotonation and trimerisation</title>
      <dc:description>3H&#8208;Phosphaallenes, R&#8208;P=C=C(H)&#8208;R&#8217; (  3  ), are accessible in a multigram scale on a new and facile route and show a fascinating chemical reactivity. BH  3  (SMe  2  ) and  3a  (R = Mes*, R&#8217; =  t  Bu) afforded by hydroboration of the C=C bonds of two phosphaallene molecules an unprecedented borane (  7  ) with the B atom bound to two P=C double bonds. This compound represents a new FLP based on a B and two P atoms. The increased Lewis acidity of the B atom led to a different reaction course upon treatment of  3a  with H  2  B&#8208;C  6  F  5  (SMe  2  ). Hydroboration of a C=C bound of a first phosphaallene is followed in a typical FLP reaction by the coordination of a second phosphaallene molecule via B&#8208;C and P&#8208;B bond formation to yield a BP  2  C  2  heterocycle (  8  ). Its B&#8208;P bond is short and the B bound P atom has a planar surrounding. Treatment of  3a  with  t  BuLi resulted in deprotonation of the &#946;&#8208;C atom of the phosphaallene (  9  ). The Li atom is bound to the P atom as demonstrated by crystal structure determination, quantum chemical calculations and reactions with HCl, Cl&#8208;SiMe  3  or Cl&#8208;P  t  Bu  2  . The thermally unstable phosphaallene Ph&#8208;P=C=C(H)&#8208;  t  Bu gave a unique trimeric secondary product by P&#8208;P, P&#8208;C and C&#8208;C bond formation. It contains a P  2  C  4  heterocycle and was isolated as a W(CO)  4  complex with two P atoms coordinated to W (  15  ).</dc:description>

Enantiomerically pure tetravalent neptunium amidinate complexes possessing unprecedented neptunium&#8211;halide bonds have been prepared by salt metathesis and subsequent (pseudo)halide exchange reactions. Structural characterization in solid state (SC&#8208;XRD) and in solution (NMR) showed the preservation of the chirality&#8208;at&#8208;metal throughout the series of heteroleptic fluoro, chloro, bromo, and azido complexes.

      <title>Hexayne Amphiphiles and Bolaamphiphiles</title>
      <dc:description>
Surfactants worth the sacrifice: Amphiphilic and bolaamphiphilic functional hexaynes were synthesized using the Egliton&#8211;Galbraith reaction and a sacrificial monomer. The novel carbon&#8208;rich surfactants form aggregates in water, monolayers on surfaces, and stabilize the liquid&#8211;liquid interface.







Abstract
Oligoynes with two or more conjugated carbon&#8211;carbon triple bonds are useful precursors for carbon&#8208;rich nanomaterials. However, their range of applications has so far been severely limited by the challenging syntheses, particularly in the case of oligoynes with functional groups. Here, we report a universal synthetic approach towards both symmetric and unsymmetric, functionalized hexaynes through the use of a modified Eglinton&#8211;Galbraith coupling and a sacrificial building block. We demonstrate the versatility of this approach by preparing hexaynes functionalized with phosphonic acid, carboxylic acid, ammonium, or thiol head groups, which serve as neutral, cationogenic, or anionogenic interfacially active groups. We show that these hexaynes are carbon&#8208;rich amphiphiles or bolaamphiphiles that self&#8208;assemble at liquid&#8211;liquid interfaces, on solid surfaces, as well as in aqueous media.

      <dc:description>Helicenes and extended helical &#960;&#8208;conjugated molecules have been widely studied, but most of the systems contain aromatic benzene or heterocyclic rings only, showing local aromatic character. Herein, we report a new S&#8208;shaped double [6]helicene molecule 1 which possesses two embedded para&#8208;quinodimethane (p&#8208;QDM) units. Due to the existence of proaromatic quinoidal substructure, the molecule exhibits unique open&#8208;shell diradical character. Its model compound, a C&#8208;shaped single [6]helicene 2 containing one p&#8208;QDM unit, was also synthesized and compared. Their ground&#8208;state structures and electronic properties were systematically studied by a combination of various experimental methods assisted by theoretical calculations. Compound 1 has a double helical structure in crystal, with the two terminal [6]helicene units bent to opposite directions (i.e., anti&#8208; form). However, an anti&#8208;/syn&#8208; isomerization process was observed on NMR time scale, with a moderate interconversion energy barrier. Compound 1 shows amphoteric redox behaviour. It also exhibits open&#8208;shell diradical character (y0 = 12.1%) and a small singlet&#8208;triplet gap. On the other hand, compound 2 displays typical closed&#8208;shell nature.&#160; The dication and dianion of 1 also show open&#8208;shell diradical character. The dianion of 2 and the tetranion of 1 exhibit similar electronic structures to their respective isoelectronic structures, the [6]helicene and a double [6]helicene. This work provides some insights into the design and synthesis of stable helical &#960;&#8208;systems with unique open&#8208;shell diradical character and magnetic activity.</dc:description>

      <title>Light Runs Across Iron Catalysts in Organic Transformations</title>
      <dc:description>Over the past decades, organometallic complexes with precious elements, such as ruthenium and iridium, were widely used as visible&#8208;light photoredox catalysts. Recently, more and more complexes based on earth&#8208;abundant and inexpensive elements have been used as sensitizers in photochemistry. Although the photoexcited state lifetimes of iron complexes are typically shorter than those of traditional photosensitizers, the utilization of iron catalysts in photochemistry has sprung up due to their abundance, low price, nontoxicity and novel properties, including exhibiting ligand to metal charge transfer states. This concept focuses on recent advance of light&#8208;driven iron&#8208;catalysis in organic transformations, including iron/photoredox dual catalysis, light&#8208;induced iron photoredox catalysis and light&#8208;induced generation of active iron catalysts. The prospect for future of this field is also discussed.</dc:description>

Recently, more and more complexes based on earth&#8208;abundant and inexpensive elements have been used as sensitizers in photochemistry. Although the photoexcited state lifetimes of iron complexes are typically shorter than those of traditional photosensitizers, the utilization of iron catalysts in photochemistry has sprung up due to their abundance, low price, nontoxicity and novel properties, including exhibiting ligand to metal charge transfer states. This concept focuses on recent advance of light&#8208;driven iron&#8208;catalysis in organic transformations, including iron/photoredox dual catalysis, light&#8208;induced iron photoredox catalysis and light&#8208;induced generation of active iron catalysts. The prospect for future of this field is also discussed.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Total Synthesis of Mallotusinin</title>
      <dc:description>We describe the total synthesis of mallotusinin that bears a tetrahydroxydibenzofuranoyl (THDBF) bridge between the 2&#8208;oxygen and 4&#8208;oxygen of glucose on corilagin with a 3,6&#8208;  O  &#8208;(  R  )&#8208;hexahydroxydiphenoyl (HHDP) bridge. The key features of the total synthesis are: (1) improvements of our previously reported method to synthesize corilagin; (2) an establishment of forming the THDBF skeleton via an unusual intramolecular S  N  Ar reaction of an HHDP analog, and (3) the application of two&#8208;step bislactonization strategy for an HHDP bridge construction into the 2,4&#8208;  O  &#8208;THDBF bridge construction. Oxidative phenol coupling of 1,2,4&#8208;orthoacetyl&#8208;3,6&#8208;di&#8208;(4&#8208;  O  &#8208;benzylgalloyl)&#8208;&#945;&#8208;D&#8208;glucopyranose and the orthoester cleavage of the coupling product without the pyranose&#8211;furanose ring transformation are key reactions for the improvement synthesis of corilagin, which enabled the adequate supplement of a corilagin precursor for developing the mallotusinin synthesis.

      <title>Polymer&#8208;assisted electrophoretic synthesis of N&#8208;doped graphene&#8208;polypyrrole demonstrating oxygen reduction reaction with excellent methanol crossover impact and durability</title>
      <dc:description>The design and synthesis of the metal&#8208;free catalysts having superior electrocatalytic activity, high durability, low cost and under mild conditions is extremely desirable but remains challenging. To address this problem, we report a polymer assisted electrochemical exfoliation technique of graphite in the presence of aqueous acidic medium. This simple, cost&#8208;effective and mass scale production approach could open a possibility for the synthesis of high&#8208;quality nitrogen doped graphene&#8208;polypyrrole (NG&#8208;PPy). The NG&#8208;PPy catalyst displays an improved half wave potential (E1/2 = 0.77 V) in alkaline medium than G&#8208;PPy (E1/2 = 0.66 V). Most importantly, this catalyst demonstrating excellent stability with high methanol tolerance, which is outperforming the commercial Pt/C catalyst and few other previously reported metal&#8208;free catalysts. The content of graphitic nitrogen atoms is the key factor for the enhancement of electrocatalytic activity towards oxygen reduction reactions (ORR). Interestingly, the NG&#8208;PPy catalyst is used as a cathode material in a zinc&#8722;air battery, which demonstrates a higher peak power density (59 mW cm&#8722;2) than G&#8208;PPy (36.6 mW cm&#8722;2), which is broadcasting the importance of the low&#8208;cost material synthesis approach towards the development of metal&#8208;free efficient ORR catalysts for fuel cell and metal air battery applications. Remarkably, the polymer assisted electrophoretic exfoliation of graphite with high yield (~88 wt %) of few layers of graphene flakes could pave the path towards mass production of high&#8208;quality graphene for a variety of applications</dc:description>

      <title>Construction of Rich Conductive Pathways from Bottom to Up: a Highly&#8208;Efficient Charge&#8208;Transfer System Used in Durable Li/Na&#8208;Ion Batteries at &#8208;20 oC</title>
      <dc:description>Constructing potential electrode materials with a wide temperature property for high energy density second batteries has attracted huge interests in recent years. Herein, a hybrid electrode, consisting of nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon/&#945;&#8208;MnS/flake graphite composite (&#945;&#8208;MnS@N&#8208;C/FG), was prepared via a post&#8208;sulfurization route.

As&#8208;obtained &#945;&#8208;MnS@N&#8208;C/FG shows excellent lithium/sodium storage performance, with a specific capacity of 712 mAh g&#8208;1 in the 700th cycle at 1.0 A g&#8208;1 or 186.4 mAh g&#8208;1 in the 100th cycle at 100 mA g&#8208;1 using lithium or sodium foil as the counter electrode, respectively. Moreover, even operated at stern temperature of &#8208;20 oC, the &#945;&#8208;MnS@N&#8208;C/FG can still attain high specific capacity of 350&#8239;mAh g&#8722;1 after 50 cycles at 100&#8239;mA&#8239;g&#8722;1 for LIBs. This exceptional electrochemical response is endorsed to the synergetic effect of the smart design of a hybrid nanofoam structure, in which the FG skeleton and N&#8208;C coating layer can significantly enhance the conductivity of the whole electrode from bottom to up. Accordingly, the enhanced redox kinetics endow the electrode with pseudocapacitive&#8208;dominated electrochemical behaviors, thus bringing fast electrode reactions and robust structural stability to the whole electrode.</dc:description>

      <title>Using Native Chemical Ligation for Site&#8208;specific Synthesis of Hetero&#8208;bis&#8208;lanthanide Peptide Conjugates: Application to Ratiometric Visible or Near&#8208;infrared Detection of Zn2+</title>
      <dc:description>The interest for ratiometric luminescent probes that detect and quantify a specific analyte is growing. Due to their special luminescence properties, lanthanide(III) cations offer attractive opportunities for the design of dual&#8208;color ratiometric probes. Here, we describe the design principle of hetero&#8208;bis&#8208;lanthanide peptide conjugates using native chemical ligation for a perfect control of the localization of each lanthanide cation within the molecule. Two zinc&#8208;responsive probes, r&#8208;LZF1Tb|Cs124|Eu and r&#8208;LZF1Eu|Cs124|Tb are described on the basis of a zinc finger peptide and two DOTA complexes of terbium and europium. Both display dual&#8208;color ratiometric emission responding to the presence of Zn2+. Using a screening approach, anthracene was identified for the sensitization of the luminescence of two near infrared&#8208;emitting lanthanides, Yb3+ and Nd3+. Thus, two novel zinc&#8208;responsive hetero&#8208;bis&#8208;lanthanide probes, r&#8208;LZF3Yb|Anthra|Nd and r&#8208;LZF3Nd|Anthra|Yb were assembled, the former offering a neat ratiometric response to Zn2+ with emission in the near&#8208;infrared around 1000 nm, which is unprecedented.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Three novel donor&#8208;&#960;&#8208;bridge&#8208;donor (D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;D) hole&#8208;transporting materials (HTMs) featuring triazatruxene electron&#8208;donating units bridged by different 3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene (EDOT) &#960;&#8208;conjugated linkers have been synthesized, characterized, and implemented in mesoporous perovskite solar cells (PSCs). The opto&#8208;electronic properties of the new dumbbell&#8208;shaped derivatives (DTTXs) are highly influenced by the chemical structure of the EDOT&#8208;based linker. Red&#8208;shifted absorption and emission and a stronger donor ability were observed in passing from DTTX&#8208;1 to DTTX&#8208;2 due to the extended &#960;&#8208;conjugation. DTTX&#8208;3 featured an intramolecular charge transfer between the external triazatruxene units and the azomethine&#8208;EDOT central scaffold, resulting in a more pronounced red shift. The three new derivatives have been tested in combination with the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art triple&#8208;cation perovskite [(FAPbI3)0.87(MAPbBr3)0.13]0.92[CsPbI3]0.08 in standard mesoporous PSCs. Remarkable power conversion efficiencies of 17.48% and 18.30% were measured for DTTX&#8208;1 and DTTX&#8208;2, respectively, close to that measured for the benchmarking HTM spiro&#8208;OMeTAD (18.92%). PSCs with DTTX&#8208;3 reached a PCE value of 12.68%, which is attributed to the poorer film&#8208;formation in comparison to DTTX&#8208;1 and DTTX&#8208;2. These PCE values are in perfect agreement with the conductivity and hole mobility values determined for the new compounds and spiro&#8208;OMeTAD. Steady&#8208;state photoluminescence further confirm the potential of DTTX&#8208;1 and DTTX&#8208;2 for hole&#8208;transport applications as an alternative to spiro&#8208;OMeTAD.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Based on recent examples and initiatives reported in the literature, this concept article discusses how chemistry can contribute to the circular economy approach in order to improve our current and future economical, societal and environmental system. Through five proposed levels of contribution, chemists can take a significant part in this global approach via the consideration of green chemistry principles, the simplification of syntheses, the limitation of complex products preparation, the efficient utilization of resources but also the novel ways of waste valorization. A more systematic and generalized environmental and economic assessment from the lab&#8208;scale is also recommended.

      <dc:description>The oxidative dearomatization of phenols with the addition of nucleophiles to the aromatic ring induced by hypervalent iodine(III) reagents and catalysts has emerged as a highly useful synthetic approach. However, experimental mechanistic studies of this important process have been extremely scarce. In this report, we describe systematic investigations of the dearomatizing hydroxylation of phenols using an array of experimental techniques. Kinetics, EPR spectroscopy, and reactions with radical probes demonstrate that the transformation proceeds via a radical&#8208;chain mechanism, with a phenoxyl radical being the key chain&#8208;carrying intermediate. Moreover, UV and NMR spectroscopy, high&#8208;resolution mass spectrometry, and cyclic voltammetry show that before reacting with the phenoxyl radical, water molecule becomes activated by the interaction with the iodine(III) center, causing the  Umpolung  of this formally nucleophilic substrate. The radical&#8208;chain mechanism allows to rationalize all existing observations regarding the iodine(III)&#8208;promoted oxidative dearomatization of phenols.</dc:description>

      <title>Tuning the cell uptake and subcellular distribution in BODIPY&#8208;carboranyl dyads: An experimental and theoretical study.</title>
      <dc:description>A set of BODIPY&#8208;carboranyl dyads synthesized by a Sonogashira cross&#8208;coupling reaction, where different C&#8208;substituted ortho&#8208; and meta&#8208;carboranyl fragments have been linked to a BODIPY fluorophore is described. Chemical, photophysical and physicochemical analyses are presented, including NMR and SXRD experiments, optical absorption/emission studies and log P measurements. These studies, supported by DFT computations (M06&#8208;2X/6&#8208;31G**) provide an explanation to the largely divergent cell income that these fluorescent carboranyl&#8208;based fluorophores display, for which a structural or physicochemical explanation remains elusive. By studying the cell uptake efficiency and subcellular localization for our set of dyads on living HeLa cells, we tracked the origins of these differences to significant variations in their static dipole moments and partition coefficients, which tune their ability to interact with lipophilic microenvironments in cells. Remarkably, m&#8208;carboranyl&#8208;BODIPY derivatives with a higher lipophilicity are much better internalised by cells than their homologous with o&#8208;carborane, suggesting that m&#8208;isomers are potentially better theranostic agents for in vitro bioimaging and boron carriers for BNCT.</dc:description>

      <title>On the Structure and Chiral Aggregation of Liquid Crystalline Star&#8208;Shaped Triazines H&#8208;Bonded to Benzoic Acids</title>
      <dc:description>The ability of a star&#8208;shaped tris(triazolyl)triazine derivative to hierarchically build supramolecular chiral columnar organizations through the formation of 1:3 H&#8208;bonded complexes with benzoic acids was studied from a theoretical and experimental point of view. Although the star&#8208;shaped triazine core crystallizes in a non&#8208;  C  3  conformation, the  C  3  &#8208;symmetric conformation is theoretically predicted to be more stable and gives rise to a favourable  C  3  supramolecular 1:3 complex upon the interaction with three benzoic acids in their voids. In addition, calculations at different levels (DFT, PM7, and MM3) for the 1:3 host&#8208;guest complex predict the formation of large stable columnar helical aggregates stabilized by the compact packing of the interstitial acids by &#960;&#8208;&#960; and CH&#183;&#183;&#183;&#960; interactions.

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The ability of a star&#8208;shaped tris(triazolyl)triazine derivative to hierarchically build supramolecular chiral columnar organizations through the formation of 1:3 H&#8208;bonded complexes with benzoic acids was studied from a theoretical and experimental point of view.

      <dc:description>Here we investigate&#160;the structural and biological effects ensuing form the disulfide bond replacement of a potent and selective C&#8208;X&#8208;C chemokine receptor type 4 (CXCR4) peptide antagonist, with 1,4&#8208; and 1,5&#8208; disubstituted 1,2,3&#8208;triazole moieties. Both strategies produced candidates that showed high affinity and selectivity against CXCR4. Notably, when assessed for their ability to modulate the CXCL12&#8208;mediated cell migration, the 1,4&#8208;triazole variant conserved the antagonistic effect in the low&#8208;mid nanomolar range, while the 1,5&#8208;triazole one displayed the ability to activate the migration, becoming the first in class low&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight CXCR4 peptide agonist. By combining NMR and computational studies, we provided a valuable model that highlighted differences in the interactions of the two peptidomimetics with the receptor that could account for their different functional profile.

      <title>A bis&#8208;chelating (O^N^O)/(N^N) ligand for the synthesis of heterobimetallic Pt(II)/Re(I) complexes: tools for the optimization of a new class of Pt(II) anticancer agents.</title>
      <dc:description>The two independent (O^N^O) and (N^N) coordination sites of a newly synthesized bis 2&#8208;(hydroxyphenyl)&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;triazole platform have been exploited to prepare four monometallic neutral (O^N^O)Pt(II) complexes carrying DMSO, pyridine, triphenylphosphine or N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) as fourth ligand. Then the second (N^N) coordination site was used to introduce an IR&#8208;active rhenium tricarbonyl entity, affording the four corresponding heterobimetallic neutral Pt(II)/Re(I) complexes as well as a cationic Pt(II)/Re(I) derivative. X&#8208;ray crystallographic studies showed that distortion of the organic platform occurred to accommodate the coordination geometry of both metal centers. No ligand exchange and no transchelation occurred upon incubation of the Pt(II) complexes in aqueous environment or in the presence of Fe(III), respectively. The ligand and the complexes antiproliferative activity was first screened on the triple negative breast cancer cell line MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;231. Then the IC  50  of the most active candidates was determined on a wider panel of human cancer cells (MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;231, MCF&#8208;7 and A2780) as well as on a non&#8208;tumorigenic cell line (MCF&#8208;10F). Low micromolar activities were reached for the complexes carrying a DMSO ligand, making them the first examples of highly active though hydrolytically stable Pt(II) complexes.

      <title>The Coordination Chemistry of the N&#8208;Donor Substituted Phosphazanes Alex J. Plajer,a* Andrew D. Bond a and Dominic S. Wright a*</title>
      <dc:description>Phosph(III)azanes, featuring the heterocyclobutane P  2  N  2  ring, have now been established as building blocks in main group coordination and supramolecular compounds. Previous studies have largely involved their use as neutral P&#8208;donor ligands or as anionic N&#8208;donor ligands, derived from deprotonation of amido&#8208;phosphazanes [RNHP(&#956;&#8208;NR)]  2  . The use of neutral amido&#8208;phosphazanes themselves as chelating, H&#8208;bond donors in anion receptors has also been an area of recent interest because of the ease by which the proton acidity and anion binding constants can be modulated, by the incorporation of electron withdrawing  exo  &#8208; and  endo  &#8208;cyclic groups (R) and by the coordination of transition metals to the ring P atoms. We observed recently that the effect of P,N&#8208;chelation of metal atoms to the P atoms of  cis  &#8208;[(2&#8208;py)NHP(&#181;&#8208;N  t  Bu)]  2  (2&#8208;py = 2&#8208;pyridyl) not only pre&#8208;organises the N&#8208;H functionality for optimum H&#8208;bonding to anions but also results in a large increase in anion binding constants, well above those for traditional organic receptors like squaramides and ureas. Here we report a broader investigation of ligand chemistry of [(2&#8208;py)NHP(&#181;&#8208;  t  NBu)]  2  (2&#8208;py = 2&#8208;pyridyl) and of the new quinolyl derivative [(8&#8208;Qu)NHP(&#956;&#8208;N  t  Bu)]  2  (8&#8208;Qu = 8&#8208;quinolyl). The additional N&#8208;donor functionality of the heterocyclic substituents and its position has a marked effect on the anion and metal coordination chemistry of both species, leading to novel structural behaviour and reactivity compared to unfunctionalized counterparts.</dc:description>

      <title>Easy Access to Phosphine&#8208;Borane Building Blocks</title>
      <dc:description>In this paper, we highlight the synthesis of a variety of primary phosphine&#8211;boranes (RPH  2  &#183;BH  3  ) from the corresponding dichlorophosphines, simply by using Li[BH  4  ] as reductant and provider of the BH  3  protecting group. The method offers facile access not only to alkyl&#8208; and arylphosphine&#8211;boranes, but also to aminophosphine&#8211;boranes (R  2  NPH  2  &#183;BH  3  ) that are convenient building blocks but without the protecting BH  3  moiety thermally labile and notoriously difficult to handle. The borane&#8208;protected primary phosphines can be doubly deprotonated using  n  &#8208;butyllithium to provide soluble phosphanediides Li  2  [RP&#183;BH  3  ] of which the phenyl&#8208;derivative Li  2  [PhP&#183;BH  3  ] was structurally characterized in the solid state.</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In this paper, we highlight the synthesis of a variety of primary phosphine&#8211;boranes (RPH  2  &#183;BH  3  ) from the corresponding dichlorophosphines, simply by using Li[BH  4  ] as reductant and provider of the BH  3  protecting group. The method offers facile access not only to alkyl&#8208; and arylphosphine&#8211;boranes, but also to aminophosphine&#8211;boranes (R  2  NPH  2  &#183;BH  3  ) that are convenient building blocks but without the protecting BH  3  moiety thermally labile and notoriously difficult to handle. The borane&#8208;protected primary phosphines can be doubly deprotonated using  n  &#8208;butyllithium to provide soluble phosphanediides Li  2  [RP&#183;BH  3  ] of which the phenyl&#8208;derivative Li  2  [PhP&#183;BH  3  ] was structurally characterized in the solid state.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>The Aggregation Regularity Effect of Multiarylpyrroles on Their Near&#8208;Infrared Aggregation&#8208;Enhanced Emission Property</title>
      <dc:description>Increasing the quantum yield of near&#8208;infrared (NIR) emissive dyes is critical for biological applications because these fluorescent dyes generally show decreased emission efficiency under aqueous conditions. In this work, we designed and synthesized several multiarylpyrrole (MAP) derivatives, in which a furanylidene (FE) group at the 3&#8208;position of the pyrrole forms donor&#8208;&#960;&#8208;acceptor molecules, MAP&#8208;FE, with a NIR emissive wavelength and aggregation&#8208;enhanced emission (AEE) features. Different alkyl chains of MAP&#8208;FEs linked to phenyl groups at the 2,5&#8208;position of the pyrrole ring resulted in different emissive wavelengths and quantum yields in aggregated states, such as powders or single crystals. Powder XRD data and single crystal analysis elucidated that the different lengths of alkyl chains had a significant impact on the regularity of MAP&#8208;FEs when they were forced to aggregate or precipitate, which affected the intermolecular interaction and the restriction degree of the rotating parts, which are essential components. Therefore, an increasing number of NIR dyes could be developed by this design strategy to produce efficient NIR dyes with AEE. Moreover, this method can provide general guidance for other related fields, such as organic solar cells and organic light&#8208;emitting materials, because they are all applied in the aggregated state.</dc:description>

      <title>Molecular Chirality in Classical Spacetime: Solving the Controversy about the Spinning Cone Model of Rotating Molecules</title>
      <dc:description>
Re&#8208;examining chirality: The disagreement between Barron and Mislow regarding the potential chirality of a spinning cone is settled. The controversy comes from an ambiguity in the spinning cone model and a new definition of chirality, which encompasses the one introduced by Lord Kelvin, is used to prove that both authors were right.







Abstract
The spinning cone is a model of rotating molecules used by Barron in 1986 in relation to asymmetric synthesis and to parity violation. He considered that the non&#8208;translating cone spinning about its symmetry axis has false chirality (i.e., it is not chiral), whereas Mislow concluded in 1999 that it is indeed chiral and severely criticized the true versus false chirality nomenclature introduced by Barron, who still disagreed in 2013 with the conclusion of Mislow. Here, it is shown that this controversy comes from an ambiguity in the spinning cone model and that in fact both authors were right. Light is thrown on the true chirality versus false chirality controversy with a very recently published result, which was thus unavailable to both authors: this is a new definition of chirality that encompasses the one introduced by Lord Kelvin at the end of the 19th century.

      <title>LGBTQ+ in STEM: Visibility and Beyond</title>
      <dc:description>
&#8220;Out and Proud&#8221; goes beyond slogans and efforts to make scientific workplaces more diverse and inclusive to LGBTQ+ scientists are being felt in Europe.







Abstract
Lesbian, gay, bisexual, trans, queer (LGBTQ+, &#8220;+&#8221;=plus other sexes, gender identities, and sexual orientation) people in the STEM fields (STEM=science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) continue to experience discrimination in their workplace. In the last decade, the clamor for safe and diverse spaces continue to rise. Indeed, social media plays a huge part on increasing visibility of the LGBTQ+ community in STEM. LGBTQ+ scientists have not only promoted discourse and raised concerns to the online community, but more importantly, supported each other in platforms such as Twitter. Beyond social media, work at the institutes by LGBTQ+ individuals are also bearing fruit. This piece explores the grassroots work of scientists as they work hand&#8208;in&#8208;hand with their institute staff and leadership to promote diversity and inclusivity within and beyond their community.

      <title>Ambident Reactivity of Imidazolium Cations as Evidence of the Dynamic Nature of N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene&#8208;Mediated Organocatalysis</title>
      <dc:description>
Ambident nucleophilic reactivity of imidazolium cations at the C2 and C4 carbene centers indicated the dynamic nature of imidazolium&#8208;based organocatalysis proceeding by means of a covalent interaction of imidazolium carbenes with carbonyl substrates and was explained by the generation of the H&#8208;bonded ditopic carbanionic carbenes along with the classical C2 carbenes.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ambident nucleophilic reactivity &lt;/b&gt; of imidazolium cations at the C2 and C4 carbene centers indicated the dynamic nature of imidazolium&#8208;based organocatalysis proceeding by means of a covalent interaction of imidazolium carbenes with carbonyl substrates and was explained by the generation of the H&#8208;bonded ditopic carbanionic carbenes along with the classical C2 carbenes. Based on these findings, covalent bonding of imidazolium carbenes with carbonyl group of enolizable ketones was investigated. More information can be found in the Full Paper by K. Galkin, B.

      <title>Female Faculty: Why So Few and Why Care?</title>
      <dc:description>
Diversity in academia: Data shows that there are few female faculty in academia today, with the percentage decreasing the higher the rank. There are many common responses to gender equality efforts that hamper progress of women in academia. Herein, we counteract such comments and discuss possible solutions along with concerns about how the COVID&#8208;19 pandemic may affect diversity in academia.







Abstract
Despite slow ongoing progress in increasing the representation of women in academia, women remain significantly under&#8208;represented at senior levels, in particular in the natural sciences and engineering. Not infrequently, this is downplayed by bringing forth arguments such as inherent biological differences between genders, that current policies are adequate to address the issue, or by deflecting this as being &#8220;not my problem&#8221; among other examples. In this piece we present scientific evidence that counters these claims, as well as a best&#8208;practice example, Genie, from Chalmers University of Technology, where one of the authors is currently employed. We also highlight particular challenges caused by the current COVID&#8208;19 pandemic. Finally, we conclude by proposing some possible solutions to the situation and emphasize that we need to all do our part, to ensure that the next generation of academics experience a more diverse, inclusive, and equitable working environment.

      <title>Synthesis, Structure, Reactivity and Catalytic Implications of a Cationic, Acetylide&#8208;Bridged Trigold&#8211;JohnPhos Species</title>
      <dc:description>
Multinuclear gold: A new family of tri&#8208;AuI complexes have been characterised as intermediates during the [AuIL][SbF6] catalytic preparation of acetaldehyde acetals. These well&#8208;characterised cationic AuI intermediates lend support to the proposed reaction mechanism. An analogous copper complex revealed different behaviour, leading to a vinylphosphonium and copper nanoparticles.







Abstract
The cationic complex [(JohnPhos&#8211;Au)3(acetylide)][SbF6] (JohnPhos=(2&#8208;biphenyl)di&#8208;tert&#8208;butylphosphine, L1) has been characterised structurally and features an acetylide&#8211;trigold(I)&#8211;JohnPhos system; the trinuclear&#8211;acetylide unit, coordinated to the monodentate bulk phosphines, adopts an unprecedented &#956;,&#951;1,&#951;2,&#951;1 coordination mode with an additional interaction between distal phenyl rings and gold centres. Other cationic &#963;,&#960;&#8208;[(gold(I)L1)2] complexes have also been isolated. The reaction of trimethylsilylacetylene with various alcohols (iPrOH, nBuOH, n&#8208;HexOH) catalysed by cationic [AuIL1][SbF6] complexes in CH2Cl2 at 50&#8201;&#176;C led to the formation of acetaldehyde acetals with a high degree of chemo&#8208; and regioselectivity. The reaction mechanism was studied, and several organic and inorganic intermediates have been characterised. A comparative study with the analogous cationic [CuIL1][PF6] complex revealed different behaviour; the copper metal is lost from the coordination sphere leading to the formation of cationic vinylphosphonium and copper nanoparticles. Additionally, a new catalytic approach for the formation of this high&#8208;value cationic vinylphosphonium has been established.

      <title>Activity&#8208;Based Sensing of Ascorbate by Using Copper&#8208;Mediated Oxidative Bond Cleavage</title>
      <dc:description>
Probing ascorbate: A new, activity&#8208;based sensing strategy was developed for the highly selective detection of ascorbate. A copper(II) complex was designed to be activated by ascorbate to effect an oxidative bond cleavage and release an emissive fluorophore for a turn&#8208;on signal. The new ascorbate probes can be applied in complex matrix including food, plasma, and live cells.







Abstract
Ascorbate is an important biological reductant and enzyme cofactor. Although direct detection through ascorbate&#8208;mediated reduction is possible, this approach suffers from poor selectivity due to the wide range of cellular reducing agents. To overcome this limitation, we leverage reduction potential of ascorbate to mediate a copper&#8208;mediated oxidative bond cleavage of ether&#8208;caged fluorophores. The copper(II) complexes supported by a {bis(2&#8208;pyridylmethyl)}benzylamine or a {bis(2&#8208;pyridylmethyl)}(2&#8208;methoxybenzyl)amine ligand were identified as an ascorbate responsive unit and their reaction with ascorbate yields a copper&#8208;based oxidant that enables rapid benzylic oxidation and the release of an ether&#8208;caged dye (coumarin or fluorescein). The copper&#8208;mediated bond cleavage is specific to ascorbate and the trigger can be readily derivatized for tuning photophysical properties of the probes. The probes were successfully applied for the fluorometric detection of ascorbate in commercial food samples, human plasma, and serum, and within live cells by using confocal microscopy and flow cytometry.

      <title>Engineering Bifunctional Host Materials of Sulfur and Lithium&#8208;Metal Based on Nitrogen&#8208;Enriched Polyacrylonitrile for Li&#8211;S Batteries</title>
      <dc:description>
Polyacrylonitrile (PAN) is delicately engineered as a bifunctional host material to simultaneously solve the problems of the shuttle effect in the cathode and lithium dendrite in the anode, which leads to improved electrochemical performances of both electrodes. Due to excellent bifunctional host characteristics, the full cell demonstrates an outstanding long&#8208;term cycling capability.







Abstract
Lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries (LSBs) still suffer from the shuttle effect on the cathode and the lithium dendrite on the anode. Herein, polyacrylonitrile (PAN) is developed into a bifunctional host material to simultaneously address the challenges faced on both the sulfur cathode and lithium anode in LSBs. For the sulfur cathode, PAN is bonded with sulfur to produce sulfurized PAN (SPAN) to avoid the shuttle effect. The SPAN is accommodated into a conductive 3D CNTs&#8208;wrapped carbon foam to prepare a self&#8208;supporting cathode, which improves the electronic and ionic conductivity, and buffers the volume expansion. Thereby, it delivers reversible capacity, superb rate capability, and outstanding cycling stability. For the Li&#8208;metal anode, PAN aerogel is carbonized to give macroporous N&#8208;doped cross&#8208;linked carbon nanofiber that behaves as a lithiophilic host to regulate Li plating and suppress the growth of Li dendrite. Combining the improvements for both the cathode and anode realizes a remarkable long&#8208;term cyclability (765&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 300&#8197;cycles) in a full cell. It provides new opportunity to propel the practical application of advanced LSBs.

      <title>A Lacunary Polyoxovanadate Precursor and Transition&#8208;Metal&#8208;Sandwiched Derivatives for Catalytic Oxidation of Sulfides</title>
      <dc:description>
New topology of polyoxovanadates: A rare example of lacunary Keggin&#8208;type vanadoselenite [SeV10O28(SeO3)3]8&#8722; ({Se4V10}) was readily obtained, which shows sufficient reactivity with divalent transition metals (TMs) to form a new series of TM&#8208;sandwiched complexes {(Se4V10)2M} (M=Mn, Co, Zn). Such new TM&#8208;derivatives can efficiently catalysis heterogeneous oxidation of sulfides in high conversion and selectivity under mild conditions.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;New topology of polyoxovanadates &lt;/b&gt;: A rare example of lacunary Keggin&#8208;type vanadoselenite [SeV&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;28&lt;/sub&gt;(SeO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;8&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; ({Se&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;V&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;}) was readily obtained, which shows sufficient reactivity with divalent transition metals (TMs) to form a new series of TM&#8208;sandwiched complexes {(Se&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;V&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;M} (M=Mn, Co, Zn). Such new TM&#8208;derivatives can efficiently catalysis heterogeneous oxidation of sulfides in high conversion and selectivity under mild conditions.
