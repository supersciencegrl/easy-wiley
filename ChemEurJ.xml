         <title>Water&#8208;Based Synthesis of &#946;&#8208;Sheet&#8208;Like Supramolecular Metallohydrogel Organized by Using a Native Ultrashort Peptide Sequence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
l&#8208;His&#8208;l&#8208;Ile&#8208;l&#8208;Thr (HIT), a short unmodified &#8220;native&#8221; tripeptide, reacts selectively with Cu2+ ions in pure water to form a transparent supramolecular metallohydrogel. This is a rare phenomenon in which a tripeptide forms a metallohydrogel without any protective group. HIT is transformed from a random coil&#8208;like structure to a &#946;&#8208;sheet&#8208;like structure by the Cu2+ ions, thereby forming a hydrogel.







Abstract
Designing supramolecular hydrogels using short peptides is challenging. To control self&#8208;assembly, a certain amount of organic solvent is typically added to the system, or the short peptide is modified with a functional group that is hydrophobic, hydrophilic, or highly coordinative. We discovered that l&#8208;His&#8208;l&#8208;Ile&#8208;l&#8208;Thr (HIT), a very short unmodified &#8220;native&#8221; tripeptide, selectively responds to Cu2+ ions in pure water to form a transparent supramolecular metallohydrogel. Circular dichroism analysis revealed that Cu2+ ions, but no other metal species, caused HIT to change from a random&#8208;coil&#8208;like to a &#946;&#8208;sheet&#8208;like structure. Other spectroscopic methods were used to characterize the properties of the supramolecular metallohydrogel. These results are expected to facilitate the development of native short peptides as advanced functional biomaterials.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Free, Hindered, Regioselective Access to Multifunctional Groups Diarylamines via SNAr Substitution of P&#8208;Nitroso Aromatic Methyl Ether by Arylamines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multifunctional groups diarylamines efficiently produced from arylamines and p&#8208;nitrosoanisole derivatives by intermolecular SNAr under weak acid conditions. Relying on the catalysis of hydrogen protons, the SNAr reaction, which is endowed with resistance to space crowding, tolerance to halogen and nitroso groups, and high regioselectivity, can be carried out under mild conditions, even if the substrates involved do not have strong electron&#8208;withdrawing groups.







Abstract
Multifunctional groups diarylamines, an innovative product, efficiently produced from arylamines and p&#8208;nitrosoanisole derivatives by intermolecular SNAr under weak acid conditions. This SNAr proceeds under mild reaction conditions, and more significantly, the substrates involved do not necessarily require strong electron&#8208;withdrawing groups. Moreover, this SNAr is characterized by resistance to space crowding, tolerance to halogen and nitroso functional groups, and high regioselectivity. Mechanistic observations suggest that the SNAr is the result of the transfer of the positive charge center of the protonated nitroso group to the p&#8208;methoxy group.

         <title>An Electrochemical Oxo&#8208;amination of 2H&#8208;Indazoles: Synthesis of Symmetrical and Unsymmetrical Indazolylindazolones</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An environmentally benign supporting electrolyte&#8208;free oxo&#8208;amination of 2H&#8208;indazole has been developed for the synthesis of symmetrical indazolylindazolones via electrochemical reduction of aerial oxygen. Simultaneously, unsymmetrical coupling products were efficiently produced by cross&#8208;dehydrogenative coupling between indazolone and 2H&#8208;indazole derivatives through electrochemical C&#8722;N bond formation.







Abstract
We have established a supporting&#8208;electrolyte free electrochemical method for the synthesis of indazolylindazolones through oxygen reduction reaction (eORR) induced 1,3&#8208;oxo&#8208;amination of 2H&#8208;indazoles where 2H&#8208;indazole is used as both aminating agent as well as the precursor of indazolone. Moreover, we have merged indazolone and indazole to get unsymmetrical indazolylindazolones through direct electrochemical cross&#8208;dehydrogenative coupling (CDC). This exogenous metal&#8208;, oxidant&#8208; and catalyst&#8208;free protocol delivered a number of multi&#8208;functionalized products with high tolerance of diverse functional groups.

         <title>Tuning the Topology of Two&#8208;Dimensional Covalent Organic Frameworks through Site&#8208;Selective Synthetic Strategy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Tuning the topology of two&#8208;dimensional (2D) covalent organic frameworks (COFs) is of paramount scientific interest but remains largely unexplored. Herein, we present a site&#8208;selective synthetic strategy that enables the tuning of 2D COF topology by simply adjusting the molar ratio of an amine&#8208;functionalized dihydrazide monomer (NH2&#8208;Ah) and 4,4',4''&#8208;(1,3,5&#8208;triazine&#8208;2,4,6&#8208;triyl)tribenzaldehyde (Tz). This approach resulted in the formation of two distinct COFs: a clover&#8208;like 2D COF with free amine groups (NH2&#8208;Ah&#8208;Tz) and a honeycomb&#8208;like COF without amine groups (Ah&#8208;Tz). Both COFs exhibited good crystallinity and moderate porosity. Remarkably, the clover&#8208;shaped NH2&#8208;Ah&#8208;Tz COF, with abundant free amine groups, displayed significantly enhanced adsorption capacities toward crystal violet (CV, 261 mg/g) and congo red (CR, 1560 mg/g) compared to the nonfunctionalized honeycomb&#8208;like Ah&#8208;Tz COF (123 mg/g for CV and 1340 mg/g for CR), underscoring the pivotal role of free amine functional groups in enhancing adsorption capacities for organic dyes. This work highlights that the site&#8208;selective synthetic strategy paves a new avenue for manipulating 2D COF topology by adjusting the monomer feeding ratio, thereby modulating their adsorption performances toward organic dyes.</dc:description>

         <title>Pyridine Iodine(I) Cations: Kinetic Trapping as a Sulfonate Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Seven pyridine iodine(I) sulfonate complexes were prepared and isolated at low temperatures and characterized by X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis. The inherently instable pyridine iodine(I) cations are stabilized by an oxygen of sulfonate anions via the I&#183;&#183;&#183;O halogen bond. In these complexes, the iodine atom of the pyridine iodine(I) cation acts as an electron acceptor and the sulfonate oxygen as the electron donor. These complexes are stable enough in the crystalline state, yet decompose rapidly under ambient conditions, also being unstable in solution. The (pyridine)N&#8211;I bond lengths [2.140(3) &#8208; 2.197(2) &#197;] and the I&#183;&#183;&#183;O halogen bonds [2.345(6) &#8208; 2.227(3) &#197;] are analogous to (imide)N&#8211;I&#183;&#183;&#183;O&#8211;N&#8208;pyridine uncharged halogen&#8208;bonded complexes formed from N&#8208;haloimides and pyridine N&#8208;oxides, thus confirming the existence of elusive pyridine iodine(I) cation.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Using CBr4 as a mild oxidant, the direct C&#8208;H bond oxidation of N&#8208;aryltetrahydroisoquinolines was achieved, giving a series of the corresponding iminium salts in high yields under metal&#8208; and photo&#8208;free reaction conditions. This reaction is superior in high yields and good functional group tolerance, and the late&#8208;stage derivatization showed that these iminium&#160;salts can readily be applied to the synthesis of the functionalized THIQs.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhancing the Features of DNA Mimic Foldamers for Structural Investigations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>DNA mimic foldamers based on aromatic oligoamide helices bearing anionic phosphonate side chains have been shown to bind to DNA&#8208;binding proteins sometimes orders of magnitude better than DNA itself. Here, we introduce new features in the DNA mimic foldamers to facilitate structural investigations of their interactions with proteins. Thirteen new foldamer sequences have been synthesized and characterized using NMR, circular dichroism, molecular modeling, and X&#8208;ray crystallography. The results show that foldamer helix handedness can be quantitatively biased by means of a single stereogenic center, that the foldamer structure can be made C2&#8208;symmetrical as in palindromic B&#8208;DNA sequences, and that associations between foldamer helices can be promoted utilizing dedicated C&#8208;terminal residues that act as sticky ends in B&#8208;DNA structures.</dc:description>

         <title>Photoinduced Dual C&#8210;F Bond Activation of Hexafluorobenzene Mediated by Boron Atom</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The reaction of laser&#8208;ablated boron atoms with hexafluorobenzene (C6F6) was investigated in neon and argon matrices, and the products are identified by matrix&#8208;isolation infrared spectroscopy and quantum&#8208;chemical calculations. The reaction is triggered by a boron atom insertion into one C&#8210;F bond of hexafluorobenzene on annealing, forming a fluoropentafluorophenyl boryl radical (A). UV&#8208;Vis light irradiation of the &#160;fluoropentafluorophenyl boryl radical causes generation of a 2&#8208;difluoroboryl&#8208;tetrafluorophenyl radical (B) via a second C&#8210;F bond activation. A perfluoroborepinyl radical (C) generated from the C&#8210;C bond insertion reaction is also observed upon deposition and under UV&#8208;Vis light irradiation. These findings reveal the first example of a double C&#8211;F bond activation of hexafluorobenzene mediated by a nonmetal and provides a possible route for synthesis of new perfluorinated organo&#8208;boron compounds.</dc:description>

         <title>DNA&#8208;Targeted Complexes of Tc and Re for Biomedical Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recent progress on DNA targeting Re/Tc complexes and their biomedical relevance, highlighting different types of homometallic and heterobimetallic complexes and different modes of DNA interactions. Future directions and contribution of DNA&#8208;targeted Re/Tc complexes for the development and success of anticancer agents and cancer theranostic radiopharmaceuticals are discussed.







Abstract
Due to their favorable chemical features, Re and Tc complexes have been widely used for the development of new therapeutic agents and imaging probes to solve problems of biomedical relevance. This review provides an update of the most relevant research efforts towards the development of novel cancer theranostic agents using Re and Tc&#8208;based compounds interacting with specific DNA structures. This includes a variety of homometallic complexes, namely those containing M(CO)3 (M=Re, Tc) moieties, that exhibit different modes of interaction with DNA, such as covalent binding, intercalation, groove binding or G&#8208;quadruplex DNA binding. Additionally, heterometallic complexes, designed to potentiate synergistic effects of different metal centers to improve DNA&#8208;targeting, cytotoxicity and fluorescence properties, are also reviewed. Particular attention is also given to 99mTc&#8208; and 188Re&#8208;labeled oligonucleotides that have been widely explored to develop imaging and therapeutic radiopharmaceuticals through the in&#8197;vivo hybridization with a specific complementary DNA or RNA target sequence to provide useful molecular tools in precision medicine for cancer diagnosis and treatment. Finally, the need for further improvement of DNA&#8208;targeted Re and Tc&#8208;based compounds as potential therapeutic and diagnostic agents is highlighted, and future directions are discussed.

         <title>Diindolocarbazole&#8208;based Rigid Donor&#8208;acceptor TADF Molecules for Energy and Electron Transfer Photocatalysis
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Four twisted D&#8208;A TADF molecules based on diindolocarbazole and phenyl carbazole as donor and indoloquinoxalines as acceptor were synthesized, characterized and utilized for photocatalytic E&#8722;Z isomerization of stilbene and C&#8722;H arylation of heteroarenes.







Abstract
The design and synthesis of four twisted donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;A) thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) molecules CBZ&#8208;IQ, CBZ&#8208;2FIQ, DI&#8208;IQ and DI&#8208;2FIQ is reported in this work based on diindolocarbazole (DI) and phenyl carbazole as donor and indoloquinoxalines as acceptor. These compounds serve as photocatalysts for organic transformations. Theoretical calculations and experimental data showed reasonable singlet and triplet energy gaps of 0.17&#8208;0.26&#8197;eV for all compounds. All molecules showed increase in fluorescence quantum yields after degassing the solution and the transient photoluminescence decay showed two components: shorter prompt components (11.4&#8197;ns to 31&#8197;ns) and longer delayed components (36.4&#8197;ns to 1.5 &#956;s) which further indicate the occurrence of TADF process. Cyclic voltammetry studies indicated well&#8208;suited excited state redox potentials of all compounds to catalyze organic transformations such as heteroarene arylation. Accordingly, photocatalytic C&#8722;H arylation of heteroarenes were performed using these compounds with excellent isolated yields of upto 80&#8201;%. Due to their suitable efficient triplet energy levels, all the emitters were also employed as energy transfer photocatalysts in E to Z isomerization of stilbene with the excellent conversion of ~90&#8201;%.

         <title>Template Assisted Formation of 32&#8201;and 34&#960; Octaphyrins Embedded with Dithienopyrrole Cores: A New Scaffold to Unravel Proton Coupled Redox Switching and (Anti)Aromaticity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The fourfold meso&#8208;substituted 32&#960; antiaromatic octaphyrin 1 embedded with dithieno[3,2&#8208;b:2&#8217;,3&#8217;&#8208;d]pyrrole undergoes facile proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET) to its 34&#960; aromatic congener H21&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2H+. Such a conversion was effective even in the presence of weak acids as well as small organic molecules like alcohols and amines. The stable aromatic freebase H21 exhibits near&#8208;planar conformation with colorimetric sensing for fluoride and hydroxide anions.







Abstract
Herein, we report two distinct octaphyrins obtained by the condensation of new dithieno[3,2&#8208;b:2&#8217;,3&#8217;&#8208;d]pyrrole based tetrapyrrane under two different acidic conditions. Fourfold meso&#8208;substituted octaphyrin was the major product when the reaction was performed in the presence of an aryl aldehyde using trifluoroacetic acid. Whereas, the sixfold meso&#8208;substituted octaphyrin was obtained when the precursor was condensed with pentafluorobenzaldehyde using para&#8208;toluenesulfonic acid. Such a template effect of aryl aldehydes in oxidative coupling reactions is realized for the first time in literature. Experimental and theoretical studies suggested that the oxidized form of fourfold meso&#8208;substituted octaphyrin is 32&#960; antiaromatic and undergoes proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET) to the protonated form of 34&#960; aromatic congener upon treatment with protic acids. Furthermore, small organic molecules such as alcohols and amines were also found to promote chemical reduction. Single crystal X&#8208;ray structure revealed that the aromatic counterpart is highly planar and stabilized by several intermolecular H&#8208;bonding and F&#8722;F interactions, leading to a large 3D supramolecular arrangement and exhibited colorimetric sensing for fluoride and hydroxide anions. On the other hand, sixfold meso&#8208;substituted octaphyrin did not show (anti)aromatic features, PCET or anion sensing, but its intriguing absorption features associated with protonation could make it an ideal candidate for pH&#8208;dependent bioimaging.

&lt;p&gt;The fourfold &lt;i&gt;meso&lt;/i&gt;-substituted 32&#960; antiaromatic octaphyrin &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; embedded with dithieno[3,2-&lt;i&gt;b&lt;/i&gt;:2&#8217;,3&#8217;-&lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt;]pyrrole undergoes facile proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) to its 34&#960; aromatic congener &lt;b&gt;H21&lt;/b&gt;&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;&lt;b&gt;2H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;. Such a conversion was effective even in the presence of weak acids as well as small organic molecules like alcohols and amines. The stable aromatic freebase &lt;b&gt;H21&lt;/b&gt; exhibits near-planar conformation with colorimetric sensing for fluoride and hydroxide anions.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Herein, we report two distinct octaphyrins obtained by the condensation of new dithieno[3,2-&lt;i&gt;b&lt;/i&gt;:2&#8217;,3&#8217;-&lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt;]pyrrole based tetrapyrrane under two different acidic conditions. Fourfold &lt;i&gt;meso&lt;/i&gt;-substituted octaphyrin was the major product when the reaction was performed in the presence of an aryl aldehyde using trifluoroacetic acid. Whereas, the sixfold &lt;i&gt;meso&lt;/i&gt;-substituted octaphyrin was obtained when the precursor was condensed with pentafluorobenzaldehyde using &lt;i&gt;para&lt;/i&gt;-toluenesulfonic acid. Such a template effect of aryl aldehydes in oxidative coupling reactions is realized for the first time in literature. Experimental and theoretical studies suggested that the oxidized form of fourfold &lt;i&gt;meso&lt;/i&gt;-substituted octaphyrin is 32&#960; antiaromatic and undergoes proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) to the protonated form of 34&#960; aromatic congener upon treatment with protic acids. Furthermore, small organic molecules such as alcohols and amines were also found to promote chemical reduction. Single crystal X-ray structure revealed that the aromatic counterpart is highly planar and stabilized by several intermolecular H-bonding and F&#8722;F interactions, leading to a large 3D supramolecular arrangement and exhibited colorimetric sensing for fluoride and hydroxide anions. On the other hand, sixfold &lt;i&gt;meso&lt;/i&gt;-substituted octaphyrin did not show (anti)aromatic features, PCET or anion sensing, but its intriguing absorption features associated with protonation could make it an ideal candidate for pH-dependent bioimaging.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Actuate Acyl Azolium and Acetone with violet Aurora!! The transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free photoinduced methodology is highly desirable to access thermodynamically less favoured (Z)&#8208;&#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated ketones. We demonstrate that acetone acts as a reactant as well as a solvent, acyl azolium salt acts as an aroyl surrogate, and the triplet state of acyl azolium promotes intermolecular hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) from acetone under violet LED irradiation. This mild and environmentally friendly protocol does not require any metals, ligands, or oxidants.







Abstract
Mono &#945;&#8208;acylation of acetone has been achieved for the first time by reacting with bench&#8208;stable acyl azolium salts under violet&#8208;LED light at room temperature. The intermolecular hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) from acetone to triplet state of azolium salts under violet LED irradiation resulted in thermodynamically less favourable (Z)&#8208;&#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated ketones with up to 99&#8201;:&#8201;1 selectivity via C&#8722;C bond formation. This compelling protocol access the desired &#945;&#8208;C(sp3)&#8722;H acylation product under metal&#8208;, ligand&#8208; and oxidant&#8208;free conditions on a wide range of substrates.

         <title>Formation and Reactivity of heavy Group 14&#8208;15&#8201;bonds</title>

Heavy group 14&#8208;15&#8201;compounds: Various low&#8208;valent group 14&#8211;15 compounds of the type [(Dipp2NacNac)ME(SiMe3)2] (M=Ge&#8722;Pb, E=As&#8722;Bi) were obtained by salt elimination reactions. The focus of these investigations is on the heavy representatives of both groups, on the structures and the reactivity.







Abstract
A series of low&#8208;valent Group 14&#8211;15 compounds were obtained starting from [(Dipp2NacNac)MCl] (M=Ge&#8208;Pb) (I&#8211;III) (Dipp2NacNac=HC{C(Me)N(Dipp)}2) and M'E(SiMe3)2 (M&#8217;=Li, E=As; M&#8217;=K, E=Sb, Bi) (IV&#8211;VI). In the course of this investigations we were able to fully characterize all permutations except Pb&#8722;Bi for compounds of the composition [(Dipp2NacNac)ME(SiMe3)2] (1E: M=Ge, 2E: M=Sn, 3E: M=Pb). Thus, we report the first low valent tetrelene with Sn&#8722;Bi bond. All isolated compounds, were examined by NMR spectroscopy, IR spectroscopy and except compound 1As by X&#8208;ray structure analysis. Moreover, were examined UV&#8208;Vis spectroscopy and investigated the reactivity of these compounds towards different substrates in more detail. Starting with the compound [(Dipp2NacNac)SnAs(SiMe3)2] (2As), the reaction with red selenium yields [(Dipp2NacNac)Sn&#8722;Se&#8208;As(SiMe3)2] (4) which exhibits a Sn&#8722;Se&#8722;As chain.

         <title>Catalytic Asymmetric Synthesis of N&#8722;N Biaryl Atropisomers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 2, January 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Although N&#8722;N Biaryl atropisomers has emerged into valuable scaffolds in natural products, drug design and asymmetric synthesis, its asymmetric synthesis is scare until recently. This concept will focus on the asymmetric synthesis of the divergent N&#8722;N biaryl atropisomers scaffolds including N&#8722;N bipyrroles atropisomers, N&#8722;N pyrrole&#8722;indole atropisomers, N&#8722;N bisindoles atropisomers, N&#8722;N indole&#8722;carbazole atropisomers.







Abstract
Atropisomers have emerged as important structural scaffolds in natural products, drug design, and asymmetric synthesis. Recently, N&#8722;N biaryl atropisomers have drawn increasing interest due to their unique structure and relatively stable axes. However, its asymmetric synthesis remains scarce compared to its well&#8208;developed C&#8722;C biaryl analogs. In this concept, we summarize the asymmetric synthesis of N&#8722;N biaryl atropisomers including N&#8722;N pyrrole&#8722;pyrrole, N&#8722;N pyrrole&#8722;indole, N&#8722;N indole&#8722;indole, and N&#8722;N indole&#8722;carbazole, during which a series synthetic strategies are highlighted. Also, a synthetic evolution is briefly reviewed and an outlook of N&#8722;N biaryl atropisomers synthesis is offered.

         <title>Chiral and Achiral Crystal Structures of Au25(PET)180 Reveal Effects of Ligand Rotational Isomerization on Optoelectronic Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 2, January 8, 2024. </description>

Analysis of all Au25(phenylethanethiol)18 crystal structures, including 2 novel clusters, reveals that ligand rotational angles are interdependent and constrained to a narrow range of values.







Abstract
The crystal structures of 4 ligand&#8208;rotational isomers of Au25(PET)18 are presented. Two new ligand&#8208;rotational isomers are revealed, and two higher&#8208;quality structures (allowing complete solution of the ligand shell) of previously solved Au25(PET)18 clusters are also presented. One of the structures lacks an inversion center, making it the first chiral Au25(SR)18 structure solved. These structures combined with previously published Au25(SR)18 structures enable an analysis of the empirical ligand conformation landscape for Au25(SR)18 clusters. This analysis shows that the dihedral angles within the PET ligand are restricted to certain observable values, and also that the dihedral angle values are interdependent, in a manner reminiscent of biomolecule dihedral angles such as those in proteins and DNA. The influence of ligand conformational isomerism on optical and electronic properties was calculated, revealing that the ligand conformations affect the nanocluster absorption spectrum, which potentially provides a way to distinguish between isomers at low temperature.

These structures combined with previously published Au&lt;sub&gt;25&lt;/sub&gt;(SR)&lt;sub&gt;18&lt;/sub&gt; structures enable an analysis of the empirical ligand conformation landscape for Au&lt;sub&gt;25&lt;/sub&gt;(SR)&lt;sub&gt;18&lt;/sub&gt; clusters. This analysis shows that the dihedral angles within the PET ligand are restricted to certain observable values, and also that the dihedral angle values are interdependent, in a manner reminiscent of biomolecule dihedral angles such as those in proteins and DNA. The influence of ligand conformational isomerism on optical and electronic properties was calculated, revealing that the ligand conformations affect the nanocluster absorption spectrum, which potentially provides a way to distinguish between isomers at low temperature.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Integrating Benzoxazine&#8208;PDMS 3D Networks with Carbon Nanotubes for flexible Pressure Sensors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 2, January 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Our study focuses on preparing benzoxazine&#8208;terminated poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PH&#8208;PDMS) and developing elastomeric nanocomposites by incorporating multi&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs). Through thermally curing, these nanocomposites demonstrate excellent electrical conductivity and mechanical stability, attributed to favorable MWCNT&#8208;matrix interactions which enable efficient dispersion of MWCNTs. These findings highlight the potential of these materials for pressure&#8208;sensing applications.







Abstract
Shapeable and flexible pressure sensors with superior mechanical and electrical properties are of major interest as they can be employed in a wide range of applications. In this regard, elastomer&#8208;based composites incorporating carbon nanomaterials in the insulating matrix embody an appealing solution for designing flexible pressure sensors with specific properties. In this study, PDMS chains of different molecular weight were successfully functionalized with benzoxazine moieties in order to thermally cure them without adding a second component, nor a catalyst or an initiator. These precursors were then blended with 1 weight percent of multi&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes (CNTs) using an ultrasound probe, which induced a transition from a liquid&#8208;like to a gel&#8208;like behavior as CNTs generate an interconnected network within the matrix. After curing, the resulting nanocomposites exhibit mechanical and electrical properties making them highly promising materials for pressure&#8208;sensing applications.

         <title>From One&#8208;Dimensional Disordered Racemate to Ordered Racemic Conglomerates through Metal&#8208;Coordination&#8208;Driven Self&#8208;Assembly at the Liquid&#8208;Solid Interface</title>

Metal&#8208;driven transformation of a 1D disordered racemate self&#8208;assembled molecular network into a 2D racemic conglomerate metal&#8208;organic coordinated network at the solution&#8208;solid interface is described.







Abstract
In recent years, there has been significant focus on investigating and controlling chiral self&#8208;assembly, specifically in the context of enantiomeric separation. This study explores the self&#8208;assembly behavior of 4&#8208;dodecyl&#8208;3,6&#8208;di(2&#8208;pyridyl)pyridazine (DPP&#8722;C12) at the interface between heptanoic acid (HA) and highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG) using a combination of scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and multiscale molecular modeling. The self&#8208;assembled monolayer structure formed by DPP&#8722;C12 is periodic in one direction, but aperiodic in the direction orthogonal to it. These structures resemble 1D disordered racemic compounds. Upon introducing palladium [Pd(II)] ions, complexing with DPP&#8722;C12, these 1D disordered racemic compounds spontaneously transform into 2D racemic conglomerates, which is rationalized with the assistance of force&#8208;field simulations. Our findings provide insights into the regulation of two&#8208;dimensional chirality.

         <title>A Discrete, Boron&#8208;Containing Triangular Triradical</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 2, January 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A neutral boron&#8208;containing triangular triradical based on a triptycene derivative has been synthesized. The triradical has isosceles triangle geometry due to Jahn&#8208;Teller distoration, leading to a doublet ground state. The work represents a rare example of an isolable neutral through&#8208;space triangular triradical.







Abstract
A neutral boron&#8208;containing triangular triradical based on a triptycene derivative has been designed and synthesized. Its structure, bonding and physical property have been studied by EPR spectroscopy, SQUID magnetometry and single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, as well as theoretical calculations. The triradical has a series of isosceles triangle conformations in the solution due to the Jahn&#8208;Teller distortion, leading to the splitting of the two low&#8208;lying doublet states. This factor together with negligible spin&#8208;orbit coupling (SOC) of composing light atoms quenches the spin frustration. The work represents a rare example of a neutral through&#8208;space triangular triradical.

         <title>Harnessing the Peterson Reaction for the Stereospecific Synthesis of Z&#8208;Vinyl Ethers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 2, January 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Near exclusive formation of a Z vinyl ether: A variant of the Peterson reaction generates Z vinyl ethers of the type RCH=CHOR&#8217; with very high stereoselectivity, a functionality found in natural plasmalogens. (R,R)/(S,S)&#8208;1&#8208;alkoxy&#8208;2&#8208;hydroxyalkylsilanes, obtained from terminal alkynes, via 2&#8208;trimethylsilyl&#8208;3&#8208;substituted epoxides by regioselective, BF3&#8208;catalysed epoxide ring opening with an alcohol, were treated with KH in &#945;,&#945;,&#945;&#8208;trifluorotoluene to give Z vinyl ethers (Z/E ratio: 99&#8201;:&#8201;1).







Abstract
Vinyl ethers are valuable synthetic intermediates which are also found as natural products, including aflatoxins, rifamycins and plasmalogens. The latter are ubiquitous phospholipids in human cells and contain a vinyl ether moiety with specifically Z configuration. Although numerous methods are available for synthesis of vinyl ethers, there is a lack of methods for obtaining Z isomers of molecules of the type RCH=CHOR&#8217; that are applicable to plasmalogens. A variant of the Peterson reaction is described that generates such molecules with very high stereoselectivity (Z/E ratio: 99&#8201;:&#8201;1). (R,R)/(S,S)&#8208;1&#8208;alkoxy&#8208;2&#8208;hydroxyalkylsilanes were synthesized from 1&#8208;trimethylsilylalkynes by a sequence of reduction with di&#8208;isobutylaluminium hydride to a (Z)&#8208;1&#8208;trimethylsilylalkene, epoxidation of the alkene to a 2&#8208;trimethylsilyl&#8208;3&#8208;substituted epoxide and regioselective, boron&#8208;trifluoride catalyzed ring&#8208;opening of the epoxide by reaction with an alcohol. Conversion of the (R,R)/(S,S)&#8208;1&#8208;alkoxy&#8208;2&#8208;hydroxyalkylsilanes to vinyl ethers (RCH=CHOR&#8217;) was achieved under basic conditions as in a standard Peterson reaction. However, near exclusive formation of a Z vinyl ether was only achieved when the reaction was performed using potassium hydride in the non&#8208;polar solvent &#945;,&#945;,&#945;&#8208;trifluorotoluene, more polar solvents giving increasing amounts of the E isomer. The sequence described embraces a variety of substituents and precursors, proceeds in overall high yield and is readily scalable.

         <title>Exploration of the Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Sydnone and Sydnonimine&#8208;Alkyne Cycloaddition Reactions by High&#8208;Throughput Experimentation</title>

High&#8208;Throughput&#8208;Experimentation has been used to revisit the Cu&#8208;catalyzed Sydnone&#8208;Alkyne Cycloaddition reaction. The reaction has been improved and a new click&#8208;and&#8208;release reaction has been discovered.







Abstract
The reactivity of sydnones and sydnonimines toward terminal alkynes under copper catalysis has been explored using High&#8208;Throughput&#8208;Experimentation. A large panel of ligands and reaction conditions have been tested to optimize the copper&#8208;catalyzed sydnone click reaction discovered by our group ten years ago. This screening approach led to the identification of new ligands, which boosted the catalytic properties of copper and allowed the discovery of a new copper&#8208;catalyzed click&#8208;and&#8208;release reaction involving sydnonimines. This reaction allowed chemoselective ligation of terminal alkynes with sydnonimines and, simultaneously, the release of an isocyanate fragment molecule that can be used for further transformations.

         <title>Nucleophilicity of 4&#8208;(Alkylthio)&#8208;3&#8208;imidazoline Derived Enamines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 2, January 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enamine activation is a key method to enhance the reactivity of carbonyl compounds in &#945;&#8208;alkylation reactions. In spite of their possible role in prebiotic chemistry, enamines derived from aldehydes and 4&#8208;(alkylthio)&#8208;3&#8208;imidazolines (TIMs) have scarcely been studied. Their reactivities have now been classified on the Mayr nucleophilicity scale by kinetic measurements. In addition, their Lewis basicities have been determined by DFT calculations and equilibrium measurements.







Abstract
Imidazolidine&#8208;4&#8208;thiones (ITOs) are cyclic, secondary amines that were considered as potential prebiotic organocatalysts for light&#8208;driven &#945;&#8208;alkylations of aldehydes by bromoacetonitrile (BAN). Recent studies showed that the initially supplied ITOs represent the pre&#8208;catalyst because they undergo S&#8208;alkylation with BAN to give 4&#8208;(alkylthio)&#8208;3&#8208;imidazolines (TIMs). Given that the same reagent mix that undergoes light&#8208;driven &#945;&#8208;alkylations is also effective in the dark, we synthesized ten ITO&#8208; or TIM&#8208;derived enamines of aldehydes and characterized their nucleophilic reactivities by kinetic studies in acetonitrile. The experimental second&#8208;order rate constants k2 for reactions of enamines with benzhydrylium ions (reference electrophiles) were evaluated by the Mayr&#8208;Patz equation, lg k2(20&#8201;&#176;C)=sN(N+E). The determined nucleophilicities N (and sN) reveal the reactivity profiles of these enamines under prebiotically relevant conditions as well as their potential for use in organocatalytic synthesis.

         <title>Halogen Bonding Tripodal Metallo&#8208;Receptors for Phosphate Recognition and Sensing in Aqueous&#8208;Containing Organic Media</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 2, January 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of tris(iodotriazole)&#8208;containing halogen bonding (XB) tripodal ZnII metallo&#8208;receptors, strategically designed for tetrahedral anion guest binding, are demonstrated to selectively recognise inorganic phosphate over more basic, mono&#8208;charged oxoanions and the halides in aqueous solvent media. The XB metallo&#8208;receptors display augmented anion affinities compared to their tris(prototriazole)&#8208;containing hydrogen bonding (HB) counterparts. The attachment of redox&#8208;active ferrocene moieties at the XB and HB tripodal receptor termini facilitated complementary electrochemical anion sensing capability.







Abstract
The anion recognition and electrochemical anion&#8208;sensing properties of halogen&#8208;bonding (XB) tripodal zinc(II) receptors strategically designed and constructed for tetrahedral anion guest binding are described. The XB tris(iodotriazole)&#8208;containing hosts exhibit high affinities and selectivities for inorganic phosphate over other more basic, mono&#8208;charged oxoanions such as acetate and the halides in a competitive CD3CN/D2O (9&#8201;:&#8201;1 v/v) aqueous solvent mixture. 1H&#8197;NMR anion binding and electrochemical voltammetric anion sensing studies with redox&#8208;active ferrocene functionalised metallo&#8208;tripodal receptor analogues, reveal each of the XB tripods as superior anion complexants when compared to their tris(prototriazole)&#8208;containing, hydrogen bonding (HB) counterparts, not only exemplifying the halogen bond as a strong alternative interaction to the traditional hydrogen bond for molecular recognition but also providing rare evidence of the ability of XB receptors to preferentially bind the &#8220;harder&#8221; phosphate oxoanion over the &#8220;softer&#8221; and less hydrated halides in aqueous containing media.

         <title>Fluorinated Benzimidazole&#8208;Linked Highly Conjugated Polymer Enabling Covalent Polysulfide Anchoring for Stable Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 2, January 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Economical sulfur in p&#8208;block is valuable for charge storage, but dissolves in electrolytes, limiting battery use. Fluorine&#8208;substituted benzimidazole polymer, treated with S8 via SNAr, anchors polysulfides for electrochemical redox&#8208;activity. Sulfurized polymer electrodes mitigate polysulfide shuttle in Li&#8722;S batteries and enable eco&#8208;friendly Al&#8722;S batteries. The strategy involves the chemistry of p&#8208;block elements such as C, N, S, Al, F, and Cl.







Abstract
Sulfur is one of the most abundant and economical elements in the p&#8208;block family and highly redox active, potentially utilizable as a charge&#8208;storing electrode with high theoretical capacities. However, its inherent good solubility in many electrolytes inhibits its accessibility as an electrode material in typical metal&#8208;sulfur batteries. In this work, the synthetically designed fluorinated porous polymer, when treated with elemental sulfur through a well&#8208;known nucleophilic aromatic substitution mechanism (SNAr), allows for the covalent integration of polysulfides into a highly conjugated benzimidazole polymer by replacing the fluorine atoms. Chemically robust benzimidazole linkages allow such harsh post&#8208;synthetic treatment and facilitate the electronic activation of the anchored polysulfides for redox reactions under applied potential. The electrode amalgamated with sulfurized polymer mitigates the so&#8208;called polysulfide shuttle effect in the lithium&#8208;sulfur (Li&#8722;S) battery and also enables a reversible, more environmentally friendly, and more economical aluminum&#8208;sulfur (Al&#8722;S) battery that is configured with mostly p&#8208;block elements as cathode, anode, and electrolytes. The improved cycling stabilities and reduction of the overpotential in both cases pave the way for future sustainable energy storage solutions.

         <title>Customized Synthesis of MOF Nanoplates via Molecular Scalpel Strategy for Efficient Oxygen Reduction in Zn&#8722;Air Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 2, January 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The 2D MOF nanoplates from a layer&#8208;pillared 3D MOF is achieved, via a molecular scalpel strategy, by utilizing pyridine to replace 4,4&#8217;&#8208;bipyridine. The morphology can be modified from hexagonal nanorods to nanoplates with controllable thickness tuned by the amounts of pyridine. The annealed nanoplates display high ORR activity (0.88&#8197;V).







Abstract
The production of metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) nanoplates with well&#8208;defined geometric morphology is remarkable for expanding their applications. Herein, the cobalt&#8208;based MOF nanoplates with hexagonal channels from a layer&#8208;pillared MOF are accomplished, via a molecular scalpel strategy, utilizing monodentate pyridine to replace the bidentate 4,4&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine. The morphology can be modified from nanorods to nanoplates with controllable thickness tuned by the amounts of pyridine. Succeeding carbonization treatment transforms the MOF nanoplates into Co particles homogeneously encapsulated in the nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon layers.

     alt="Customized Synthesis of MOF Nanoplates via Molecular Scalpel Strategy for Efficient Oxygen Reduction in Zn&#8722;Air Batteries"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 2D MOF nanoplates from a layer-pillared 3D MOF is achieved, via a molecular scalpel strategy, by utilizing pyridine to replace 4,4&#8217;-bipyridine. The morphology can be modified from hexagonal nanorods to nanoplates with controllable thickness tuned by the amounts of pyridine. The annealed nanoplates display high ORR activity (0.88&#8197;V).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The production of metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) nanoplates with well-defined geometric morphology is remarkable for expanding their applications. Herein, the cobalt-based MOF nanoplates with hexagonal channels from a layer-pillared MOF are accomplished, via a molecular scalpel strategy, utilizing monodentate pyridine to replace the bidentate 4,4&#8242;-bipyridine. The morphology can be modified from nanorods to nanoplates with controllable thickness tuned by the amounts of pyridine. Succeeding carbonization treatment transforms the MOF nanoplates into Co particles homogeneously encapsulated in the nitrogen-doped carbon layers. The prepared catalyst with a unique platelike morphology displays a high half-wave potential of 0.88&#8197;V in oxygen reduction reaction. When used in primary Zn&#8722;air batteries, it delivers a high peak power density of 280&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;. This work clarifies the structure-morphology-reactivity connection of MOF nanoplates.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Temperature&#8208;Modulated Reversible Clustering of Gold Nanorods Driven by Small Surface Ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 2, January 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In thermoresponsive plasmonics, size does matter: This study presents a strategy for preparing thermosensitive gold nanorods clustering reversibly over a broad temperature range and reaching interparticle gaps as small as 1&#8197;nm in the clustered state. This enables the possibility to exploit the full promise of plasmonic coupling and the generation of dynamic hotspots.







Abstract
Temperature&#8208;modulated colloidal phase of plasmonic nanoparticles is a convenient playground for resettable soft&#8208;actuators or colorimetric sensors. To render reversible clustering under temperature change, bulky ligands are required, especially if anisotropic morphologies are of interest. This study showcases thermoresponsive gold nanorods by employing small surface ligands, bis (p&#8208;sulfonatophenyl) phenyl&#8208;phosphine dihydrate dipotassium salt (BSPP) and native cationic surfactant. Temperature&#8208;dependent analysis in real&#8208;time allowed to describe the structural features (interparticle distance and cluster size) as well as thermal parameters, melting and freezing temperatures. These findings suggest that neither covalent Au&#8722;S bonds nor bulky ligands are required to obtain a robust thermoresponsive system based on anisotropic gold nanoparticles, paving the way to stimuli&#8208;responsive nanoparticles with a wide range of sizes and geometries.

         <title>Field&#8208;Assisted Regulation Induced by Cobalt&#8208;Doped ZnO for Dendrite&#8208;Free Lithium Metal Anodes</title>

The incorporation of Co doping induces a local electric field and built&#8208;in magnetic field, thereby facilitating electron transfer and modulating the dynamic trajectory of Li+ ions, ultimately resulting in homogeneous Li deposition.







Abstract
Lithium metal batteries are deemed as an optimal candidate for the next generation of durable energy storage devices. However, the growth of lithium dendrite and significant volume expansion pose as obstacles that impede the application of lithium metal batteries. In this work, a functional copper current collector was designed by coating it with Co&#8208;doped ZnO (Co/ZnO) to enhance the lithiophilicity through local electric fields and built&#8208;in magnetic fields induced by the ferromagnetic material. The incorporation of Co not only induces a local electric field and thus accelerating electron transfer, but also imparts the ferromagnetic behavior to ZnO, resulting in an internal magnetic field to regulate the dynamic trajectory. Profiting from the above advantages, the symmetric cells have excellent cycle stability in 1&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and 1&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2, maintaining ultra&#8208;low voltage for over 2000&#8197;h. This study provides a realizable pathway for next&#8208;generation current collector of copper modification.

         <title>Probing Radical Addition to 1&#8208;Phosphabutadienes by Employing Muonium as a &#8220;Light Isotope&#8221; of Hydrogen</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 2, January 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The radical addition to 1&#8208;phosphabutadienes, Mes*P=CMe&#8722;CR=CH2 (R=H, Me) using muonium (Mu) as an H&#8208;atom analogue affords unprecedented, delocalized phosphaallylic radicals: Mes*P&#8901;&#8722;CMe=CR(CMuH2)&#8596;Mes*P=CMe&#8722;&#8901;CR(CMuH2). Structural elucidation was accomplished using muon spin spectroscopy (&#956;SR) which takes advantage of the nuclear spin properties of the Mu (Mu=&#956;++e&#8722;). This study provides important insights into the radical reactivity of low&#8208;coordinate phosphorus species, which are actively being investigated for their uses in functional macromolecule formation.







Abstract
Understanding free radical addition to multiple bonds is important to elucidating the mechanistic details of addition polymerization reactions, albeit the fleeting radical intermediates are very difficult to detect by conventional methodologies. Muon spin spectroscopy (&#956;SR) is a highly sensitive method that can detect radical species at 106 spins (cf. EPR: 1012 spins, NMR: 1018 spins). Herein, we employ &#956;SR to detect the radical&#8208;addition products from three 1&#8208;phosphabutadiene monomers, P&#8208;analogues of isoprene. We show that muonium (Mu), a &#8220;light&#8221; H&#8208;atom surrogate, adds predominantly at the C4 position of the P1=C2&#8722;C3=C4 moiety to give unprecedented 1&#8208;phosphaallyl radicals as the major products. Our structural assignments are supported by assignment of muon, phosphorus and proton hyperfine coupling constants using DFT&#8208;calculations. A minor radical product is also detected that is tentatively assigned to an PC3&#8208;heterocyclic free radical. On the basis of DFT&#8208;predictions, we speculate that its formation may involve initial addition of Mu+ at the C3 position followed by electron capture. These studies provide rare insights into the prospective radical (or cationic) polymerization of 1&#8208;phosphabutadienes, which have previously been polymerized using anionic initiation.

         <title>Bimetallic Manganese Catalysts: A Route to Controlled and Switchable Polymerization of Lactones</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 2, January 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bimetallic Salen&#8208;Mn catalysts with biaryl&#8208;linkers were developed for ring&#8208;opening polymerization of lactide and &#1013;&#8208;caprolactone. Advanced activity and the iso&#8208;selective tendency towards lactide are determined by catalyst conformation and Mn&#8722;Mn separation. Finally, the CO2&#8208;controlled switchable polymerization succeeded in this catalytic system, in which the on&#8208;off reversibility is related to the combination between active species and CO2 molecules.







Abstract
The sustainable solution to the environmental problem of polymeric materials calls for efficient and well&#8208;controlled ring&#8208;opening polymerization catalytic systems. Inspired by the highly reactive and stereospecific bimetallic catalysts, three kinds of bimetallic Salen&#8208;Mn catalysts supported by biaryl linking moieties are synthesized and applied to polymerization catalysis of lactide (LA) and &#1013;&#8208;caprolactone (&#1013;&#8208;CL) in this work. The polymerization is initiated in&#8197;situ by the ring&#8208;opening of epoxide compounds, in which the ionic cocatalyst could accelerate the reaction process. The Mn&#8722;Mn coordination effect contributes to the higher activity and iso&#8208;selectivity towards LA compared to the mononuclear Salen&#8208;Mn catalyst. The reactivity and stereoselectivity are determined by the conformation of catalysts, specifically the Mn&#8722;Mn separation and dihedral angle. Finally, the CO2&#8208;controlled switchable polymerizations are carried out with LA and &#1013;&#8208;CL. The reversibility of the on&#8208;off switching operation is influenced by the combination between CO2 molecules and active species. The success in binuclear Salen&#8208;Mn catalysts not only expands the range of bimetallic catalyst analogues but also claims the promising potential of Mn&#8208;based catalysts in practical and theoretical research.

The reactivity and stereoselectivity are determined by the conformation of catalysts, specifically the Mn&#8722;Mn separation and dihedral angle. Finally, the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-controlled switchable polymerizations are carried out with LA and &#1013;-CL. The reversibility of the on-off switching operation is influenced by the combination between CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; molecules and active species. The success in binuclear Salen-Mn catalysts not only expands the range of bimetallic catalyst analogues but also claims the promising potential of Mn-based catalysts in practical and theoretical research.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Sheet&#8208;Isolated MoS2 Used for Dispersing Pt Nanoparticles and its Application in Methanol Fuel Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 2, January 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The isolation of NMWCNTs weakens the &#960;&#8722;&#960; stacking, improves the conductivity, and activates basal planes of the MoS2 sheets. Consequently, the prepared Pt/NWMCNTs&#8208;solated&#8208;MoS2 realizes excellent bifunctional catalytic performance for MOR and ORR.







Abstract
It is highly challenging to activate the basal plane and minimize the &#960;&#8722;&#960; stacking of MoS2 sheets, thus enhancing its catalytic performance. Here, we display an approach for making well&#8208;dispersed MoS2. By using the N&#8208;doped multi&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes (NMWCNTs) as an isolation unit, the aggregation of MoS2 sheets was effectively reduced, favoring the dispersion of Pt nanoparticles (noted as Pt/NMWCNTs&#8208;isolated&#8208;MoS2). Excellent bifunctional catalytic performance for methanol oxidation and oxygen reduction reaction (MOR/ORR) were demonstrated by the produced Pt/NMWCNTs&#8208;isolated&#8208;MoS2. In comparison to Pt nanoparticles supported on MoS2 (Pt/MoS2), the MOR activity (2314.14&#8197;mA&#8201;mgpt&#8722;1) and stability (317.69&#8197;mA&#8201;mgpt&#8722;1 after 2&#8197;h of operation) on Pt/NMWCNTs&#8208;isolatedMoS2 were 24 and 232 times higher, respectively. As for ORR, Pt/NMWCNTs&#8208;isolated&#8208;MoS2 holds large half&#8208;wave potential (0.88&#8197;V) and high stability (92.71&#8201;% after 22&#8197;h of operation). This work presents a tactic for activating the basal planes and reducing the &#960;&#8722;&#960; stacking of 2D materials to satisfy their applications in electrocatalysis. In addition, the proposed sheet&#8208;isolation method can be used for fabricating other 2D materials to promote the dispersion of nanoparticles, which assist its application in other fields of energy as well as the environment.

         <title>2&#8208;Pyridone Formation: An Efficient Method for the Solid&#8208;Phase Synthesis of Homodimers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 2, January 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly efficient and operationally simple method is presented for the solid&#8208;phase synthesis of homodimeric protein ligands from a single precursor through acid&#8208; or I2/acetone&#8208;mediated formation of a 2&#8208;pyridone linkage.







Abstract
This study presents an efficient method for on&#8208;resin dimer generation through self&#8208;condensation of 3,3&#8208;dimethoxypropionic acid&#8208;modified molecules, resulting in 2&#8208;pyridones. The approach demonstrated remarkable versatility by producing homodimers of peptides, peptoids, and non&#8208;peptidic ligands. Its ease of application, broad utility, and mild reaction conditions not only hold significance for peptide and peptoid research but also offer potential for the on&#8208;resin development of a wide range of bivalent ligands.

         <title>Extremely Stable Perylene Bisimide&#8208;Bridged Regioisomeric Diradicals and Their Redox Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 2, January 8, 2024. </description>

The partially conjugated connection via C&#8722;C single bonds between a PBI bridge and TTM segments can restrain the formation of closed&#8208;shell quinone resonance structures to obtain pure diradicals. The three building blocks not only keep their inherent characteristics but also exist electronic communication that causes distinct and reversible multistep redox processes and contributes to extremely high stability under ambient conditions.







Abstract
Excellent stability is an essential premise for organic diradicals to be used in organic electronic and spintronic devices. We have attached two tris(2,4,6&#8208;trichlorophenyl)methyl (TTM) radical building blocks to the two sides of perylene bisimide (PBI) bridges and obtained two regioisomeric diradicals (1,6&#8208;TTM&#8208;PBI and 1,7&#8208;TTM&#8208;PBI). Both of the isomers show super stability rather than the monomeric TTM under ambient conditions, due to the increased conjugation and the electron&#8208;withdrawing effects of the PBI bridges. The diradicals show distinct and reversible multistep redox processes, and a spectro&#8208;electrochemistry investigation revealed the generation of organic mixed&#8208;valence (MV) species during reduction processes. The two diradicals have singlet ground states, very small singlet&#8211;triplet energy gaps (&#916;ES&#8208;T) and a pure open&#8208;shell character (with diradical character y0=0.966 for 1,6&#8208;TTM&#8208;PBI and 0.967 for 1,7&#8208;TTM&#8208;PBI). This work opens a window to developing very stable diradicals and offers the opportunity of their further application in optical, electronic and magnetic devices.

         <title>Calamitic Liquid Crystals for Reversible Light&#8208;Modulated Phase Regulation Based on Arylazopyrazole Photoswitches</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 2, January 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of light responsive arylazopyrazole mesogens and their light&#8208;controlled liquid&#8208;crystalline phase regulation are reported. These compounds can act as a dopant in commercially available liquid crystals to provide fast and microscale optical responses at ambient temperatures.







Abstract
The design of responsive liquid crystals enables a diversity of technological applications. Especially photochromic liquid crystals gained a lot of interest in recent years due to the excellent spatiotemporal control of their phase transitions. In this work we present calamitic light responsive mesogens based on a library of arylazopyrazole photoswitches. These compounds show liquid&#8208;crystalline behavior as shown by differential scanning calorimetry, grazing incidence X&#8208;ray diffraction and polarized optical microscopy. UV&#8208;vis spectroscopy and NMR analysis confirmed the excellent photophysical properties in solution and thin film. Additionally, polarized optical microscopy studies of the pristine compounds show reversible phase transition upon irradiation with light. Moreover, as a dopant in the commercially available liquid crystal 4&#8208;cyano&#8208;4&#8242;&#8208;pentylbiphenyl (5CB), the temperature range was reduced to ambient temperatures while preserving the photophysical properties. Remarkably, this co&#8208;assembled system shows reversible liquid&#8208;crystalline to isotropic phase transition upon irradiation with light of different wavelengths. The spatiotemporal control of the phase transition of the liquid crystals offers opportunities in the development of optical devices.

A new purely organic supramolecular framework based on hexakis[60]fullerene is capable of absorbing and releasing chloroform through internal structural reorganization.







Abstract
The design of dynamic structures with high recognition host&#8208;guest materials capable to host selectively small volatile molecules is an emergent field of research with both fundamental and applied implications. The challenge of exploring novel materials with advanced functionalities has led to the development of dynamic crystalline structures promoted by soft interactions. Here, a new pure organic dynamic framework based on hexakis[60]fullerene that are held together by weak van der Waals interactions is described. This crystalline structure is capable of absorbing and releasing chloroform, through internal structural reorganization. This research provides new insight into the design of organic molecular crystals for selective adsorption applications.

         <title>Advancing Gold Redox Catalysis: Mechanistic Insights, Nucleophilicity&#8208;Guided Transmetalation, and Predictive Frameworks for the Oxidation of Aryl Gold(I) Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 2, January 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study (1) resolved a longstanding query in the field of gold redox catalysis concerning the reaction between PhICl2 and [(Ar)Au(PR3)] by unveiling the mechanism for transmetallation between gold(I) and gold(III) complexes, (2) utilized this insight to develop a predictive conceptual framework for this reaction, and (3) experimentally validated the reliability of the prediction, establishing a foundation for advancements in this field.







Abstract
Gold redox catalysis, often facilitated by hypervalent iodine(III) reagents, offers unique reactivity but its progress is mainly hindered by an incomplete mechanistic understanding. In this study, we investigated the reaction between the gold(I) complexes [(aryl)Au(PR3)] and the hypervalent iodine(III) reagent PhICl2, both experimentally and computationally and provided an explanation for the formation of divergent products as the ligands bonded to the gold(I) center change. We tackled this essential question by uncovering an intriguing transmetalation mechanism that takes place between gold(I) and gold(III) complexes. We found that the ease of transmetalation is governed by the nucleophilicity of the gold(I) complex, [(aryl)Au(PR3)], with greater nucleophilicity leading to a lower activation energy barrier. Remarkably, transmetalation is mainly controlled by a single orbital &#8211; the gold dx2&#8722;y2 orbital. This orbital also has a profound influence on the reactivity of the oxidative addition step. In this way, the fundamental mechanistic basis of divergent outcomes in reactions of aryl gold(I) complexes with PhICl2 was established and these observations are reconciled from first principles. The theoretical model developed in this study provides a conceptual framework for anticipating the outcomes of reactions involving [(aryl)Au(PR3)] with PhICl2, thereby establishing a solid foundation for further advancements in this field.

         <title>Cage Match: Comparing the Anion Binding Ability of Isostructural Versus Isofunctional Pairs of Metal&#8208;Organic Nanocages</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 2, January 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three Pt&#8208;linked porphyrin nanocages were used to examine how the structure and functionality of hosts influence their anion binding ability. Two isostructural M6L312+ cages exhibit similar high affinities (&gt;107&#8197;M&#8722;1) for aryl carboxylates and sulfonates despite the hosts differing greatly in hydrogen&#8208;bonding ability. Proton&#8208;responsive behavior was used to toggle between binding the benzoate guests and a weaker binding perfluorooctanoate anion.







Abstract
Affinities of six anions (mesylate, acetate, trifluoroacetate, p&#8208;toluenecarboxylate, p&#8208;toluenesulfonate, and perfluorooctanoate) for three related Pt2+&#8208;linked porphyrin nanocages were measured to probe the influence of different noncovalent recognition motifs (e.&#8201;g., hydrogen bonding, electrostatics, &#960; bonding) on anion binding. Two new hosts of M6L312+ (1b) and M4L28+ (2) composition (M=(en)Pt2+, L=(3&#8208;py)4porphyrin) were prepared in a one&#8208;pot synthesis and allowed comparison of hosts that differ in structure while maintaining similar N&#8722;H hydrogen&#8208;bond donor ability. Comparisons of isostructural hosts that differ in hydrogen&#8208;bonding ability were made between 1b and a related M6L312+ nanoprism (1a, M=(tmeda)Pt2+) that lacks N&#8722;H groups. Considerable variation in association constants (K1=1.6&#215;103&#8197;M&#8722;1 to 1.3&#215;108&#8197;M&#8722;1) and binding mode (exo vs. endo) were found for different host&#8211;guest combinations. Strongest binding was seen between p&#8208;toluenecarboxylate and 1b, but surprisingly, association of this guest with 1a was only slightly weaker despite the absence of NH&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O interactions. The high affinity between p&#8208;toluenecarboxylate and 1a could be turned off by protonation, and this behavior was used to toggle between the binding of this guest and the environmental pollutant perfluorooctanoate, which otherwise has a lower affinity for the host.

         <title>High&#8208;Mannose Oligosaccharide Hemimimetics that Recapitulate the Conformation and Binding Mode to Concanavalin A, DC&#8208;SIGN and Langerin</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 2, January 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The &#8220;carbohydrate chemical mimicry&#8221; of sp2&#8208;iminosugars enables the synthesis of high&#8208;mannose&#8208;type oligosaccharide analogs whose solution and lectin bound conformations match those of the natural partners. Upon multivalent presentation, enhanced affinities towards ConA, DC&#8208;SIGN and langerin are achieved, with distinct selectivity profiles.







Abstract
The &#8220;carbohydrate chemical mimicry&#8221; exhibited by sp2&#8208;iminosugars has been utilized to develop practical syntheses for analogs of the branched high&#8208;mannose&#8208;type oligosaccharides (HMOs) Man3 and Man5. In these compounds, the terminal nonreducing Man residues have been substituted with 5,6&#8208;oxomethylidenemannonojirimycin (OMJ) motifs. The resulting oligomannoside hemimimetic accurately reproduce the structure, configuration, and conformational behavior of the original mannooligosaccharides, as confirmed by NMR and computational techniques. Binding studies with mannose binding lectins, including concanavalin A, DC&#8208;SIGN, and langerin, by enzyme&#8208;linked lectin assay and surface plasmon resonance revealed significant variations in their ability to accommodate the OMJ unit in the mannose binding site. Intriguingly, OMJMan segments demonstrated &#8220;in line&#8221; heteromultivalent effects during binding to the three lectins. Similar to the mannobiose (Man2) branches in HMOs, the binding modes involving the external or internal monosaccharide unit at the carbohydrate binding&#8208;domain exist in equilibrium, facilitating sliding and recapture processes. This equilibrium, which influences the multivalent binding of HMOs, can be finely modulated upon incorporation of the OMJ sp2&#8208;iminosugar caps. As a proof of concept, the affinity and selectivity towards DC&#8208;SIGN and langerin were adjustable by presenting the OMJMan epitope in platforms with diverse architectures and valencies.

         <title>Revealing the Origin of Fast Delayed Fluorescence in a Donor Functionalized Bisterpyridine</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 2, January 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two different, extremely short fluorescence lifetimes were found for a new carbazole&#8208;substituted bisbipyridine. Various methods, including tempered TCSPC, DFT and NMR spectroscopy were used to show the presence of two rotamers. These can transition into each other after optical excitation, causing two temporally different fluorescence events.







Abstract
A new carbazole&#8208;substituted bisterpyridine with pronounced delayed fluorescence is presented. While the molecular donor&#8208;acceptor&#8208;donor design suggests the origin of this to be thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF), results from various photophysical characterizations, OLED characteristics, temperature&#8208;dependent NMR spectroscopy, and DFT calculations all point against the involvement of triplet states. The molecule exhibits blue emission at about 440&#8197;nm with two or more fast decay channels in the lower nanosecond range in both solution and thin films. The delayed emission is proposed to be caused by rotational vibrational modes. We suggest that these results are generally applicable, especially for more complex molecules, and should be considered as alternative or competitive emissive relaxation pathways in the field of organic light emitting materials.

An electrochemical synthesis of gold(I)&#8208;N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (Au&#8208;NHC) complexes has been developed in which the only by&#8208;product is hydrogen gas. This enables the clean Au&#8208;NHC complexes to be transferred directly to subsequent catalytic reactions without extra work&#8208;up. This telescoped methodology has been showcased for several mononuclear and dinuclear Au&#8208;NHC complexes in a catalytic vinylcyclopropanation reaction, delivering high yields and demonstrating procedural simplicity.







Abstract
An electrochemical synthesis of gold(I)&#8208;N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (Au&#8208;NHC) complexes has been developed. The electrochemical methodology uses only imidazolium salts, gold metal electrodes, and electricity to produce these complexes with hydrogen gas as the only by&#8208;product. This high&#8208;yielding and operationally simple procedure has been used to produce eight mononuclear and three dinuclear Au&#8208;NHC complexes. The electrochemical procedure facilitates a clean reaction with no by&#8208;products. As such, Au&#8208;NHC complexes can be directly transferred to catalytic reactions without work&#8208;up or purification. The Au&#8208;NHC complexes were produced on&#8208;demand and tested as catalysts in a vinylcyclopropanation reaction. All mononuclear Au&#8208;NHC complexes performed similarly to or better than the isolated complexes.

         <title>CoFe Alloys Dispersed on Se, N Co&#8208;Doped Graphitic Carbon as Efficient Bifunctional Catalysts for Zn&#8208;Air Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 2, January 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
CoFe/Se@CN with abundant porous structure was obtained through a self&#8208;sacrificing template method. The large specific surface area and the mesopores of CoFe/Se@CN provide rich active sites and facilitate the transport and transfer of protons and electrons. The abundant defects formed by doping Se enhance the oxygen adsorption/activation of carbon surfaces and increase active sites. Under the synergistic effect of CoFe alloys and Se, N co&#8208;doped graphitic carbon, CoFe/Se@CN exhibits excellent ORR and OER properties with an ultralow potential gap of 0.625&#8197;V.







Abstract
The development of a stable and efficient non&#8208;noble metal catalyst with both oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is paramount to achieving the widespread application of Zn&#8208;air batteries (ZABs) but remains a great challenge. Herein, a novel Co3Fe7 alloy nanoparticle dispersed on Se, N co&#8208;doped graphitic carbon (denoted as CoFe/Se@CN) was prepared through a facile hydrothermal and pyrolysis process. The synthesized CoFe/Se@CN exhibits outstanding ORR and OER properties with an ultralow potential gap of 0.625&#8197;V, which is mainly attributed to the abundant porous structure, the rich structural defects formed by doping Se atoms, and the strong synergistic effects between the CoFe alloys and graphitic carbon nanosheet. Furthermore, the ZAB fabricated by CoFe/Se@CN shows a high peak power density of 160&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and a large specific capacity of 802&#8197;mA&#8201;h&#8201;g&#8722;1 with favorable cycling stability, outperforming that of Pt/C+RuO2. Our study offers a plausible strategy to explore bifunctional carbon&#8208;based materials with efficient electrocatalytic properties for rechargeable ZABs.

         <title>Visible Light Activates Coumarin&#8208;Caged mRNA for Cytoplasmic Cap Methylation in Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 2, January 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A 5&#8242; cap with coumarin at the N7G was prepared in two different ways. It can be used to make mRNAs and to activate the process of cytoplasmic cap methylation in cells by visible light.







Abstract
Protein synthesis is important and regulated by various mechanisms in the cell. Translation initiation in eukaryotes starts at the 5&#8242; cap and is the most complex of the three phases of mRNA translation. It requires methylation of the N7 position of the terminal guanosine (m7G). The canonical capping occurs in the nucleus, however, cytoplasmic recapping has been discovered. It functions in switching mRNAs between translating and non&#8208;translating states, but the individual steps are difficult to dissect. We targeted cytoplasmic cap methylation as the ultimate step of cytoplasmic recapping. We present an N7G photocaged 5&#8242; cap that can be activated for cytoplasmic methylation by visible light. We report chemical and chemo&#8208;enzymatic synthesis of this 5&#8242; cap with 7&#8208;(diethylamino)&#8208;4&#8208;methyl&#8208;coumarin (DEACM) at the N7G and validate that it is not bound by translation initiation factor 4E (eIF4E). We demonstrate incorporation into mRNA, the release of unmethylated cap analog and enzymatic remethylation to functional cap 0 after irradiation at 450&#8197;nm. In cells, irradiation triggers translation of mRNAs with the N7G photocaged 5&#8242; cap via cytoplasmic cap methylation.

         <title>Generation and Application of Homoallylic &#945;,&#945;&#8208;Diboryl Radicals via Diboron&#8208;Promoted Ring&#8208;Opening of Vinyl Cyclopropanes: cis&#8208;Diastereoselective Borylative Cycloaddition
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 2, January 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A versatile access to homoallylic &#945;,&#945;&#8208;diboryl radicals has been developed by using geminal diboryl group as an activator of vinyl cyclopropane (VCP) ring opening. These boron&#8208;stabilized radicals participated in [3+2] cycloaddition reaction with a variety of alkenes to provide diboryl&#8208;cyclopentanes in a cis&#8208;diastereoselective fashion which was confirmed and rationalized by quantitative NOE and DFT studies.







Abstract
Carbon&#8208;centered radicals stabilized by adjacent boron atoms are underexplored reaction intermediates in organic synthesis. This study reports the development of vinyl cyclopropyl diborons (VCPDBs) as a versatile source of previously unknown homoallylic &#945;,&#945;&#8208;diboryl radicals via thiyl radical catalyzed diboron&#8208;directed ring opening. These diboryl stabilized radicals underwent smooth [3+2] cycloaddition with a variety of olefins to provide diboryl cyclopentanes in good to excellent diastereoselectivity. In contrast to the trans&#8208;diastereoselectivity observed with most of the dicarbonyl activated VCPs, the cycloaddition of VCPDBs showed a remarkable preference for formation of cis&#8208;cyclopentane diastereomer which was confirmed by quantitative NOE and 2D NOESY studies. The cis&#8208;stereochemistry of cyclopentane products enabled a concise intramolecular Heck reaction approach to rare tricyclic cyclopentanoid framework containing the diboron group. The mild reaction conditions also allowed a one&#8208;pot VCP ring&#8208;opening, cycloaddition&#8208;oxidation sequence to afford disubstituted cyclopentanones. Control experiments and DFT analysis of reaction mechanism support a radical mediated pathway and provide a rationale for the observed diastereoselectivity. To the authors&#8217; knowledge, these are the first examples of the use of geminal diboryl group as an activator of VCP ring opening and cycloaddition reaction of &#945;&#8208;boryl radicals.

     alt="Generation and Application of Homoallylic &#945;,&#945;-Diboryl Radicals via Diboron-Promoted Ring-Opening of Vinyl Cyclopropanes: cis-Diastereoselective Borylative Cycloaddition**&amp;#xA;"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A versatile access to homoallylic &#945;,&#945;-diboryl radicals&lt;/b&gt; has been developed by using geminal diboryl group as an activator of vinyl cyclopropane (VCP) ring opening. These boron-stabilized radicals participated in [3+2] cycloaddition reaction with a variety of alkenes to provide diboryl-cyclopentanes in a &lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt;-diastereoselective fashion which was confirmed and rationalized by quantitative NOE and DFT studies.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carbon-centered radicals stabilized by adjacent boron atoms are underexplored reaction intermediates in organic synthesis. This study reports the development of vinyl cyclopropyl diborons (VCPDBs) as a versatile source of previously unknown homoallylic &#945;,&#945;-diboryl radicals via thiyl radical catalyzed diboron-directed ring opening. These diboryl stabilized radicals underwent smooth [3+2] cycloaddition with a variety of olefins to provide diboryl cyclopentanes in good to excellent diastereoselectivity. In contrast to the &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;-diastereoselectivity observed with most of the dicarbonyl activated VCPs, the cycloaddition of VCPDBs showed a remarkable preference for formation of &lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt;-cyclopentane diastereomer which was confirmed by quantitative NOE and 2D NOESY studies. The &lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt;-stereochemistry of cyclopentane products enabled a concise intramolecular Heck reaction approach to rare tricyclic cyclopentanoid framework containing the diboron group. The mild reaction conditions also allowed a one-pot VCP ring-opening, cycloaddition-oxidation sequence to afford disubstituted cyclopentanones. Control experiments and DFT analysis of reaction mechanism support a radical mediated pathway and provide a rationale for the observed diastereoselectivity. To the authors&#8217; knowledge, these are the first examples of the use of geminal diboryl group as an activator of VCP ring opening and cycloaddition reaction of &#945;-boryl radicals.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Proof&#8208;of&#8208;Principle Design for Through&#8208;Space Transmission of Unidirectional Rotary Motion by Molecular Photogears

A stereochemical approach to transmitting the directional double&#8208;bond rotary motion of light&#8208;driven molecular motors through space onto a remote single&#8208;bond axis is put forth and successfully tested by means of quantum&#8208;chemical modeling. A key result in the assessment of the approach is that the desired photogearing process is favorable compared to the undesired, free&#8208;standing single&#8208;bond rotation process (&#8220;slippage&#8221;) with which it competes.







Abstract
The construction of molecular photogears that can achieve through&#8208;space transmission of the unidirectional double&#8208;bond rotary motion of light&#8208;driven molecular motors onto a remote single&#8208;bond axis is a formidable challenge in the field of artificial molecular machines. Here, we present a proof&#8208;of&#8208;principle design of such photogears that is based on the possibility of using stereogenic substituents to control both the relative stabilities of two helical forms of the photogear and the double&#8208;bond photoisomerization reaction that connects them. The potential of the design was verified by quantum&#8208;chemical modeling through which photogearing was found to be a favorable process compared to free&#8208;standing single&#8208;bond rotation (&#8220;slippage&#8221;). Overall, our study unveils a surprisingly simple approach to realizing unidirectional photogearing.

         <dc:description>
A birefringent thin film of liquid crystals based on photoswitchable arylazopyrazoles has been created. The typical schlieren structure is indicative of calamitic liquid crystals. Upon irradiation with UV light, the mesogen photoisomerizes from E to Z, and the liquid crystal instantaneously forms an isotropic liquid. Upon irradiation with green light, the mesogen photoisomerizes from Z to E, and the liquid crystal reassembles. The phase transition can be induced locally using an optical fiber.

         <dc:description>
Demand for structurally diverse organosilanols has been increasing, and thus this Review summarized the progress in the catalyzed synthesis of silanols via hydroxylation of hydrosilanes in the last decade, with a particular emphasis on the latest elegant developments in the desymmetrization strategy for the enantioselective synthesis of silicon&#8208;stereogenic silanols from dihydrosilanes.







Abstract
As a crucial class of functional molecules in organosilicon chemistry, silanols are found valuable applications in the fields of modern science and will be a potentially powerful framework for biologically active compounds or functional materials. It has witnessed an increasing demand for non&#8208;natural organosilanols, as well as the progress in the synthesis of these structural features. From the classic preparative methods to the catalytic selective oxidation of hydrosilanes, electrochemical hydrolysis of hydrosilanes, and then the construction of the most challenging silicon&#8208;stereogenic silanols. This review summarized the progress in the catalyzed synthesis of silanols via hydroxylation of hydrosilanes in the last decade, with a particular emphasis on the latest elegant developments in the desymmetrization strategy for the enantioselective synthesis of silicon&#8208;stereogenic silanols from dihydrosilanes.

         <title>Recent Developments of Dual Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts for Nitrogen Reduction Reaction</title>

In recent years, DSACs for ENRR have been developed rapidly. We give essential characterization and detection methods after reviewing DSACs&#8242; coordination environments, support materials, the N2 molecule, and NRR mechanism configuration. Finally, we suggested electrochemical NRR research issues, answers, and future directions.







Abstract
Ammonia is vital for fertilizer production, hydrogen storage, and alternative fuels. The conventional Haber&#8208;Bosch process for ammonia production is energy&#8208;intensive and environmentally harmful. Designing environmentally friendly and low&#8208;energy consumption strategies for electrocatalytic N2 reduction reaction (ENRR) in mild conditions is meaningful. Single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) have been studied extensively for NRR due to their high atomic utilization and unique electronic structure but are limited by their poor faradic efficiency and low ammonia formation yield. Dual single&#8208;atom catalysts (DSACs) have recently emerged as a promising solution for the effective activation of molecular N2, providing diverse active sites and synergistic interactions between adjacent atoms. In this review, we summarize the latest advances in metal DSACs for electrochemical ENRR based on both theoretical calculations and experimental studies, including aspects such as their variety, coordination, support, N2 adsorption and activity mechanisms, the characterization of NRR and electrochemical cell Configuration.

     alt="Recent Developments of Dual Single-Atom Catalysts for Nitrogen Reduction Reaction"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In recent years, DSACs for ENRR have been developed rapidly. We give essential characterization and detection methods after reviewing DSACs&#8242; coordination environments, support materials, the N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; molecule, and NRR mechanism configuration. Finally, we suggested electrochemical NRR research issues, answers, and future directions.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ammonia is vital for fertilizer production, hydrogen storage, and alternative fuels. The conventional Haber-Bosch process for ammonia production is energy-intensive and environmentally harmful. Designing environmentally friendly and low-energy consumption strategies for electrocatalytic N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction reaction (ENRR) in mild conditions is meaningful. Single-atom catalysts (SACs) have been studied extensively for NRR due to their high atomic utilization and unique electronic structure but are limited by their poor faradic efficiency and low ammonia formation yield. Dual single-atom catalysts (DSACs) have recently emerged as a promising solution for the effective activation of molecular N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, providing diverse active sites and synergistic interactions between adjacent atoms. In this review, we summarize the latest advances in metal DSACs for electrochemical ENRR based on both theoretical calculations and experimental studies, including aspects such as their variety, coordination, support, N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; adsorption and activity mechanisms, the characterization of NRR and electrochemical cell Configuration. We also address challenges and prospects in this rapidly evolving field, providing a comprehensive overview of DSACs for ENRR.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Energy transfer on cytoskeleton of red blood cell ghosts and&#160;their efficiency control by KCl concentration&#8208;induced cell shrinkage</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lipid bilayer membranes such as liposomes have been utilized as reactors to construct bioinspired artificial photosynthesis. Embedding functional compounds, including chromophores and catalysts, into two&#8208;dimensional lipid membranes allows their high local concentration and proximity, resulting in enhanced reactivity compared to that of homogeneous solutions. The control of photoreactions by the physical and chemical properties of membranes, such as fluidity and phase separation, has also been well studied in recent years. In contrast, it remains difficult to control chemical reactions via dynamic membrane deformation. Here, we report on the control of excitation energy transfer reaction utilizing red blood cell ghosts (RBCGs), which have asymmetric lipid membranes and inherent and unique deformability, as reactors. RBCGs, in which donor and acceptor molecules were chemically conjugated to a two&#8208;dimensional cytoskeleton located beneath the inner membrane, exhibited energy transfer, and their efficiency varied depending on the amount and ratio of donor and acceptor modifications, as confirmed by experimental and theoretical analysis. Furthermore, the KCl concentration&#8208;induced RBCG shrinkage enhanced the energy transfer efficiency. Our proposed method is expected to facilitate the construction of photoreaction systems that can be controlled via membrane deformation.</dc:description>

         <title>Assessing the Role of BN&#8208;Embedding Position in B2N2&#8208;Perylenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Incorporating heteroatoms can effectively modulate the molecular optoelectronic properties. However, the fundamental understanding of BN doping effects in BN&#8208;embedded polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) is underexplored, lacking rational guidelines to modulate the electronic structures through BN units for advanced materials. Herein, a concise synthesis of novel B2N2&#8208;perylenes with BN doped at the bay area is achieved to systematically explore the doping effect of BN position on the photophysical properties of PAHs. The shift of BN position in B2N2&#8208;perylenes alters the &#960; electron conjugation, aromaticity and molecular rigidness significantly, achieving substantially higher electron transition abilities than those with BN doped in the nodal plane. It is further clarified that BN position dominates the photophysical properties over BN orientation. The revealed guideline here may apply generally to novel BN&#8208;PAHs, and aid the advancement of BN&#8208;PAHs with highly&#8208;emissive performance.</dc:description>

         <title>A New Look at the Mechanism of Cocrystal Formation and Coformers Exchange in Processes Forced by Mechanical and/or Thermal Stimuli &#8211; ex situ and in&#8197;situ Studies of Low&#8208;Melting Eutectic Mixtures</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first attempt to explain in&#8197;situ with atomic resolution the multi&#8208;stage mechanism of cocrystals formation in various devices used for their preparation (ball mills, hot stage melting, MAS rotors).







Abstract
Three different devices: ball mill, hot stage melting, and magic angle spinning (MAS) NMR rotor were used for the preparation of ethenzamide (ET) cocrystals with glutaric acid (GLU), ethylmalonic acid (EMA) and maleic acid (MAL) as coformers. In each case, well&#8208;defined binary systems (ET:EMA, ET:GLU, ET:MAL) were obtained. The common features of the two solvent free methods of cocrystal formation (grinding, melting) are presented on the basis of arguments obtained by solid state NMR spectroscopy. Thermal analysis (Differential Scanning Calorimetry) proved that the eutectic phase arises over a wide range of molar ratios of components for each of the binary systems. NMR techniques, supported by theoretical calculations, allowed to provide details about the pathway of the reaction mechanism with atomic accuracy. It was found that the formation of ET cocrystals is a complex process that requires five steps. Each step has been recognized and described. Variable temperature 1D and 2D MAS NMR experiments allowed to track physicochemical processes taking place in a molten state. Moreover, it was found that in a multicomponent mixture consisting of all four components, ET, EMA, GLU, and MAL, ET in the molten phase behaves as a specific selector choosing only one partner to form binary cocrystals according to energy preferences. The process of exchange of coformers in binary systems during grinding, melting, and NMR measurements is described. The stabilization energies (Estab) and molecular electrostatic potential (MEP) maps computed for the cocrystals under discussion and their individual components rationalize the selection rules and explain the relationships between individual species.

         <title>Covalent Organic Frameworks as Electrode Materials for Alkali Metal&#8208;ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Covalent organic framework (COFs) is a promising electrode material, which has the advantages of strong covalent bond network, adjustable pore structure, large specific surface area, excellent thermal stability. The effective strategies (introducing active sites, constructing conjugated structures, carbon composites, etc.) for improving the conductivity and stability of COFs materials are summarized, and the current challenges and future design directions of COFs electrodes are discussed.







Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are a class of porous crystalline polymeric materials constructed by linking organic small molecules through covalent bonds. COFs have the advantages of strong covalent bond network, adjustable pore structure, large specific surface area and excellent thermal stability, and have broad application prospects in various fields. Based on these advantages, rational COFs design strategies such as the introduction of active sites, construction of conjugated structures, and carbon material composite, etc. can effectively improve the conductivity and stability of the electrode materials in the field of batteries. This paper introduces the latest research results of high&#8208;performance COFs electrode materials in alkali metal&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs, SIBs, PIBs and LSBs) and other advanced batteries. The current challenges and future design directions of COFs&#8208;based electrode are discussed. It provides useful insights for the design of novel COFs structures and the development of high&#8208;performance alkali metal&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>Rational Design and Biological Application of Hybrid Fluorophores</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this review, we primarily summarized the hybridizations between four classical fluorophores, namely xanthene, cyanine, coumarin and BODIPY. We provided an overview of the connection modes between conjugated and non&#8208;conjugated hybrid fluorophores. Hybrid fluorophores have played an irreplaceable role in the fields of biological detection, diagnosis and treatment.







Abstract
Fluorophores are considered powerful tools for not only enabling the visualization of cell structures, substructures, and biological processes, but also making for the quantitative and qualitative measurement of various analytes in living systems. However, most fluorophores do not meet the diverse requirements for biological applications in terms of their photophysical and biological properties. Hybridization is an important strategy in molecular engineering that provides fluorophores with complementarity and multifunctionality. This review summarizes the basic strategies of hybridization with four classes of fluorophores, including xanthene, cyanine, coumarin, and BODIPY with a focus on their structure&#8208;property relationship (SPR) and biological applications. This review aims to provide rational hybrid ideas for expanding the reservoir of knowledge regarding fluorophores and promoting the development of newly produced fluorophores for applications in the field of life sciences.

         <title>On Demand Synthesis of C3&#8722;N1&#8217; Bisindoles by a Formal Umpolung Strategy: First Total Synthesis of (&#177;)&#8208;Rivularin A</title>

On Demand Synthesis of C3&#8722;N1&#8217; Bisindoles!!: Unified synthesis of C3&#8722;N1&#8217; bisindolines, indole/indolines, and bisindoles was accomplished by a formal umpolung strategy. Good functional group tolerance enabled the first total synthesis of polybrominated C3&#8722;N1&#8217; bisindole alkaloid rivularin A.







Abstract
In this work, a straightforward synthesis of C3&#8722;N1&#8217; bisindolines is achieved by a formal umpolung strategy. The protocols were tolerant of a wide variety of substituents on the indole and indoline ring. In addition, the C3&#8722;N1&#8217; bisindolines could be converted to C3&#8722;N1&#8217; indole&#8208;indolines and C3&#8722;N1&#8217;&#8208;bisindoles. Also, we have successfully synthesized (&#177;)&#8208;rivularin A through a biomimetic late&#8208;stage tribromination as a key step.

         <title>Visible&#8208;light driven control over oligomerization of triple and quadruply hydrogen&#8208;bonded ditopic self&#8208;assemblies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Supramolecular polymers offer tremendous potential to produce new &#8220;smart&#8221; materials however, there remains a need to develop systems that are responsive to external stimuli. In this work visible&#8208;light responsive hydrogen&#8208;bonded supramolecular polymers comprising photoresponsive supramolecular synthons (I&#8208;III) consisting of two hydrogen bonding motifs (HBMs) connected by a central ortho&#8208;tetrafluorinated azobenzene have been characterized by DOSY NMR and viscometry. Comparison of different hydrogen&#8208;bonding motifs reveals that assembly in the low and high concentration regimes is strongly influenced by the strength of association between the HBMs. I, Incorporating a triply hydrogen&#8208;bonded heterodimer, was found to exhibit concentration dependent switching between a monomeric pseudo&#8208;cycle and supramolecular oligomer through intermolecular hydrogen bonding interactions between the HBMs. II, Based on the same photoresponsive scaffold, and incorporating a quadruply hydrogen&#8208;bonded homodimer was found to form a supramolecular polymer which was dependent upon the ring&#8208;chain equilibrium and thus dependent upon both concentration and photochemical stimulus. Finally, III, incorporating a quadruply hydrogen&#8208;bonded heterodimer represents the first photoswitchable AB type hydrogen&#8208;bonded supramolecular polymer. Depending on the concentration and photostationary state, four different assemblies dominate for both monomers II and III, demonstrating the ability to control supramolecular assembly and physical properties triggered by light.</dc:description>

         <title>Tuning Reactivities of tert&#8208;Butyllithium by the Addition of Stoichiometric Amounts of Tetrahydrofuran</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In alkyllithium chemistry the highest reactivity has historically been linked to the smallest degree of aggregation possible. Since tert&#8208;butyllithium is known to form a monomer in tetrahydrofuran solution, using just stoichiometric amounts of the lewis base to selectively form a dimeric species seemed irrational. In this study, we showed a considerable increase of the reactivity of t&#8208;BuLi when using stoichiometric amounts of THF in the non&#8208;polar solvent n&#8208;pentane in order to enable the deprotonation of simple methyl silanes and other low C&#8211;H&#8208;acidic substrates. In this context, we were able to obtain the corresponding aggregates of t&#8208;BuLi with the ligand THF in suspension and as crystalline solids and investigate them by single crystal X&#8208;ray structural analysis, in situ FTIR spectroscopy and quantum chemical calculations. Furthermore, we were able to explain the enhanced reactivity of t&#8208;BuLi with stoichiometric amounts of THF on the basis of structural features of the bridged dimer obtained under these conditions. With these findings, we present a new target in the aggregation of alkyllithium reagents: the selectively formed &#8220;frustrated&#8221; aggregates!</dc:description>

         <title>Design Strategies toward High&#8208;Utilization Zinc Anodes for Practical Zinc&#8208;Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aqueous Zn&#8208;metal batteries (AZMBs) hold a promise as the next&#8208;generation energy storage devices due to their higher specific capacity. However, the actual capacity falls far below the requirements of commercial AZMBs due to the inevitable dendritic growth and side reactions on the surface of Zn anode. Reducing the N/P ratio (negative capacity/positive capacity) is an effective method to achieve high energy density. A significant amount of research has been devoted to increasing the cathode loading and specific capacity to achieve the goal of low N/P batteries. Nevertheless, there is currently a lack of comprehensive overview regarding how to enhance the utilization of the Zn anode to balance the cycle life and energy density of AZMBs. In this review, we summarize the challenges faced in achieving high&#8208;utilization Zn anodes and elaborate on the modifying strategies for the Zn anode to lower the N/P ratio. The current research status and future prospects for the practical application of high&#8208;performance AZMBs are proposed at the end of the review.</dc:description>

         <title>Donor&#8208;Acceptor Interactions Enhanced Colorimetric Sensors for Both Acid and Base Vapor Based on Two&#8208;Dimensional Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Imine&#8208;based COFs with spatial&#8208;distribution&#8208;defined D&#8208;A structures are successfully synthesized and exhibit simultaneous sensing ability towards both acidic and alkaline vapors.







Abstract
Due to the high surface area and uniform porosity of covalent organic frameworks (COFs), they exhibit superior properties in capturing and detecting even trace amounts of gases in the air. However, the COFs materials that possess dual detected functionality are still less reported. Here, an imine&#8208;based COF containing thiophene as a donor and triazine as an acceptor to form spatial&#8208;distribution&#8208;defined D&#8208;A structures was prepared. D&#8208;A system between thiophene and triazine facilitates the charge transfer process during the protonation process of the imine and the triazine units. The obtained COF exhibits simultaneous sensing ability toward both acidic and alkaline vapors with obvious colorimetric sensing functionality.

         <title>A Green Environmental Protection Photocatalytic Molecular Reactor for Aerobic Oxidation of Sulfide to Sulfoxide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, we designed a novel PDI&#8208;based Zr&#8208;MOF as a photocatalytic molecular reactor for the solid&#8208; and liquid&#8208;phase photocatalytic oxidation of sulfur ethers to sulfoxides. High yields and excellent selectivity and recyclability were demonstrated, which provide a basis for further investigation of the mechanism of action of PDI&#8208;MOF in other photocatalytic reactions.







Abstract
The design and synthesis of metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) as photocatalytic molecular reactors for varied reactions have drawn great attention. In this work, we designed a novel photoactive perylenediimides&#8208;based (PDI) carboxylate ligand N,N&#8217;&#8208;di(3&#8217;,3&#8221;,5&#8217;,5&#8221;&#8208;tetrakis(4&#8208;carboxyphenyl))&#8208;1,2,6,7&#8208;tetrachloroperylene&#8208;3,4,9,10&#8208;tetracarboxylic acid diimide (Cl&#8208;PDI&#8208;TA) and use it to successfully synthesize a novel Zr(IV)&#8208;based MOF 1 constructed from [Zr6O8(H2O)8]8+ clusters bridged by Cl&#8208;PDI&#8208;TA ligands. Structural analysis revealed that Zr&#8208;MOF 1 manifests a 3D framework with (4,8)&#8208;connected csq topology and possesses triangular channels of ~17&#8197;&#197; and mesoporous hexagonal channels of ~26&#8197;&#197; along c&#8208;axis. Moreover, the synthesized Zr&#8208;MOF 1 exhibits visible&#8208;light absorption and efficient photoinduced free radical generation property, making it a promising photocatalytic molecular reactor. When Zr&#8208;MOF 1 was used as a photocatalyst for the aerobic oxidation of sulfides under irradiation of visible light, it could afford the corresponding sulfoxides with high yield and selectivity. Experimental results demonstrated that the substrate sulfides could be fixed in the pores of 1 and directly transformed to the products sulfoxides in the solid state. Furthermore, the mechanism for the photocatalytic transformation was also investigated and the results revealed that the singlet oxygen (1O2) and superoxide radical (O2&#8901;&#8722;) generated by the energy transfer and electron transfer from the photoexcited Zr&#8208;MOF to oxidants were the main active species for the catalytic reactions. This work offers a perceptive comprehension of the mechanism in PDI&#8208;based MOFs for further study on photocatalytic reactions.

         <title>NHC&#8208;Stabilized Mixed Group 13/14/15 Element Hydrides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>

Reactions of the NHC&#8208;stabilized compound IDipp&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;GeH2BH2OTf with NaPH2 were carried out. Hereby, mixtures of isomers of the unprecedented parent hydride adducts IDipp&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;GeH2BH2PH2 and IDipp&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;BH2GeH2PH2 were isolated in different ratios in favour of the latter isomer, depending on the reaction conditions. Subsequent reactions of these isomers yielded the borane adducts IDipp&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;GeH2BH2PH2BH3 and IDipp&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;BH2GeH2PH2BH3 as well as the cyclohexyl&#8208;like anion [PHGeH2BH2PH2BH2GeH2]&#8211;.







Abstract
The syntheses of novel N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) adducts of group 13, 14 and 15 element hydrides are reported. Salt metathesis reactions between NaPH2 and IDipp&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;GeH2BH2OTf (1) (IDipp=1,3&#8208;bis(2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl)imidazol&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene) led to mixtures of the two isomers IDipp&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;GeH2BH2PH2 (2&#8201;a) and IDipp&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;BH2GeH2PH2 (2&#8201;b); by altering the reaction conditions an almost exclusive formation of 2&#8201;b was achieved. Attempts to purify mixtures of 2&#8201;a and 2&#8201;b by re&#8208;crystallization from THF afforded a salt [IDipp&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;GeH2BH2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;IDipp][PHGeH2BH2PH2BH2GeH2] (4) that contains the novel anionic cyclohexyl&#8208;like inorganic heterocycle [PHGeH2BH2PH2BH2GeH2]&#8722;. In addition, the borane adducts IDipp&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;GeH2BH2PH2BH3 (3&#8201;a) and IDipp&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;BH2GeH2PH2BH3 (3&#8201;b) as even longer chain compounds were obtained from reactions of 2&#8201;a/2&#8201;b with H3B&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;SMe2 and were studied by NMR spectroscopy. Accompanying DFT computations give insight into the mechanism and energetics associated with 2&#8201;a/2&#8201;b isomerization as well as their decomposition pathways.

         <title>Constructing Lanthanide&#8208;Organic Complexes for X&#8208;ray Scintillation and Imaging</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The judicious synergy between lanthanide cations and organic ligands affords two photoluminescent and radioluminescent organic&#8208;inorganic hybrids, Eu&#8208;bppCOO&#8208;1 and Tb&#8208;bppCOO&#8208;2. Owing to its lower detection limit of 4.06&#8197;&#956;Gy&#8201;s&#8722;1 and excellent radiation stability, Tb&#8208;bppCOO&#8208;2 was fabricated into a flexible scintillation film featuring a high spatial image resolution of 7&#8197;lp&#8201;mm&#8722;1.







Abstract
The photoluminescent properties of lanthanide complexes have been thoroughly investigated; however, there have been much fewer studies showcasing their potential use in ionizing radiation detection. In this work, we delve into the photo&#8208; and radio&#8208;induced luminescence of a series of lanthanide&#8208;bearing organic&#8208;inorganic hybrids and their potential as a platform for X&#8208;ray scintillation and imaging. The judicious synergy between lanthanide cations and 2,6&#8208;di(1H&#8208;pyrazol&#8208;1&#8208;yl)isonicotinate (bppCOO&#8722;) ligands affords six new materials with three distinct structures. Notably, Eu&#8208;bppCOO&#8208;1 and Tb&#8208;bppCOO&#8208;2 display sharp fingerprint X&#8208;ray&#8208;excited luminescence (XEL), the intensities of which can be linearly correlated with the X&#8208;ray dose rates over a broad dynamic range (0.007&#8211;4.55&#8197;mGy&#8201;s&#8722;1). Moreover, the X&#8208;ray sensing efficacies of Eu&#8208;bppCOO&#8208;1 and Tb&#8208;bppCOO&#8208;2 were evaluated, showing that Tb&#8208;bppCOO&#8208;2 features a lower detection limit of 4.06&#8197;&#956;Gy&#8201;s&#8722;1 compared to 14.55&#8197;&#956;Gy&#8201;s&#8722;1 of Eu&#8208;bppCOO&#8208;1. Given the higher X&#8208;ray sensitivity and excellent radiation stability of Tb&#8208;bppCOO&#8208;2, we fabricated a flexible scintillator film for X&#8208;ray imaging by embedding finely ground Tb&#8208;bppCOO&#8208;2 in the polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) polymer. The resulting scintillator film can be utilized for high&#8208;resolution X&#8208;ray imaging with a spatial resolution of approximately 7&#8197;lp&#8201;mm&#8722;1.

         <title>Investigating the Structure&#8208;property Relationships of Two Cd&#8208;based Hybrid Multifunctional Compounds with High Tc, Bright Fluorescence and Wide Band&#8208;gap</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two Cd&#8208;based hybrid multifunctional compounds with dual&#8208;stable behavior in dielectric, high transition temperature and bright fluorescence were reported. Then, investigated the impact of substituent carbon chain length (methyl to butyl), structural rigidity (C&#8722;C to C&#8722;F), and halide framework (Cl to I) on fluorescent properties.







Abstract
Organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid multifunctional materials have shown significant application in lighting and sensor fields, owing to their prominent performance and diversity structures. Herein, we synthesized two multifunctional compounds: (propyl&#8208;quinuclidone)2CdBr4 (1) and (F&#8208;butyl&#8208;quinuclidone)2CdBr4 (2). By introducing light&#8208;emitting organic cation with flexible long chain, 1 and 2 exhibit excellent transition properties and bright blue&#8208;white fluorescence. Then, combine fluorescence lifetime and first&#8208;principal calculation, providing evidence for the electron transfer emission. Subsequently, investigated the impact of substituent carbon chain length (methyl to butyl), structural rigidity (C&#8722;C to C&#8722;F) and halide framework (Cl to I) on the fluorescence properties. Results indicate that Cd&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Cd distance and structural rigidity play an important role in fluorescence. Overall, our research provides valuable insight and example for chemical modifications enhance compound performance.

         <title>Synthesis and Modular Reactivity of Low Valent Al/Zn Heterobimetallics Supported by Common Monodentate Amides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Recent advances on low valent main group metal chemistry have shown the excellent potential of heterobimetallic complexes derived from Al(I) to promote cooperative small molecule activation processes. A signature feature of these complexes is the use of bulky chelating ligands which act as spectators providing kinetic stabilization to their highly reactive Al&#8208;M bonds. Breaking new ground in this field, here we report the synthesis of novel unsupported Al/Zn bimetallics prepared by the selective formal insertion of AlCp* into the Zn&#8208;N bond of the utility zinc amides ZnR2&#160;(R = HMDS, hexamethyldisilazide; or TMP, 2,2,6,6&#8208;tetramethylpiperidide). By systematically assessing the reactivity of the new [(R)(Cp*)AlZn(R)] bimetallics towards carbodiimides, structural and mechanistic insights have been gained on their ability to undergo insertion in their Zn&#8208;Al bond. Disclosing a dramatic ligand effect, when R = TMP, an isomerization process can be induced giving [(TMP)2AlZn(Cp*)] which displays a special reactivity towards carbodiimides and carbon dioxide involving both its Al&#8208;N bonds, leaving its Al&#8208;Zn bond untouched.</dc:description>

         <title>Monomeric gold hydrides for carbon dioxide reduction: ligand effect on the reactivity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We analyzed the ligand electronic effect in the reaction between a [LAu(I)H]0/&#8208; hydride species and CO2, leading to a coordinated formate [LAu(HCOO)]0/&#8208;. We explored 20 different ligands, such as carbenes, phosphines and others, carefully selected to cover a wide range of electron&#8208;donor and &#8208;acceptor properties. We included in the study the only ligand, an NHC&#8208;coordinated diphosphene, that, thus far, experimentally demonstrated facile and reversible reaction between the monomeric gold(I) hydride and carbon dioxide. We elucidated the previously unknown reaction mechanism, which resulted to be concerted and common to all the ligands: the gold&#8208;hydrogen bond attacks the carbon atom of CO2 with one oxygen atom coordinating to the gold center. A correlation between the ligand &#963; donor ability, which affects the electron density at the reactive site, and the kinetic activation barriers of the reaction has been found. This systematic study offers useful guidelines for the rational design of new ligands for this reaction, while suggesting a few promising and experimentally accessible potential candidates for the stoichiometric or catalytic CO2 activation.</dc:description>

         <title>In&#8208;situ construction of poly(tetraisopentyl acrylate) based gel polymer electrolytes with LixLa2&#8208;xTiO3 for high energy density lithium&#8208;metal batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>As promising alternatives to liquid electrolytes, polymer electrolytes attract much research interest recently, but their widespread use is limited by the low ionic conductivity. In this study, we use electrostatic spinning to introduce particles of an ionic conductor into polyacrylonitrile (PAN) fibers to prepare a porous membrane as the host of gel polymer electrolytes (GPEs). The relevant in&#8208;situ produced GPE performs a high ionic conductivity of 6.0&#215;10&#8208;3 S cm&#8208;1, and a high lithium transfer number of 0.85 at 30 &#176;C, respectively. A symmetrical Li cell with this GPE can cycle stably for 550 h at a current density of 0.5 mA/cm2. While the capacity retention of the NCM|GPE|Li cell is 79.84% after 500 cycles at 2C. Even with an increased cut&#8208;off voltage of 4.5 V, the 1st coulomb efficiency reaches 91.58% with a specific discharge capacity of 213.4 mAh/g. This study provides a viable route for the practical application of high energy density lithium metal batteries.</dc:description>

Compound 1 not only possesses strong light&#8208;harvesting ability, but also exhibits high carrier separation efficiency and lower charge transfer resistance. Under visible light irradiation, compound 1 displayed excellent catalytic activity and circularity in the conversion of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde (yield = 94%; turnover number = 500; turnover frequency = 20.8 h&#8208;1). Finally, the electron paramagnetic resonance measurement and energy level matching analysis provide theoretical basis for the derivation of the reaction mechanism.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hydroxytrifluoroethyl and trifluoroacetyl groups are of utmost importance in biologically active compounds, but methods to tether these motifs to organic architectures have been limited. Typically, the preparation of these compounds relied on the use of strong bases or multistep routes. The renaissance of radical chemistry in photocatalytic, transition metal mediated, and hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) processes have allowed the installation of these medicinally relevant fluorinated motifs. This review provides an overview of the methods available for the direct synthesis of hydroxytrifluoroethyl&#8208; and trifluoroacetyl&#8208;derived compounds governed by single&#8208;electron transfer processes.</dc:description>

         <title>Insights into the Mechanism of Neptunium Oxidation to the Heptavalent State</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Neptunium can exist in multiple oxidation states, including the rare and poorly understood heptavalent form.&#160;&#160; In this work, we monitored the formation of heptavalent neptunium [Np(VII)O4(OH)2]3&#8208; during ozonolysis of aqueous MOH (M = Li, Na, K) solutions using a combined experimental and theoretical approach. All experimental reactions were closely monitored via absorption and vibrational spectroscopy to follow both the oxidation state and the speciation of neptunium guided by the calculated vibrational frequencies for various neptunium species. The mechanism of the reaction partly involves oxidative dissolution of transient Np(VI) oxide/hydroxide solid phases, the identity of which are dependent on the co&#8208;precipitating counter&#8208;cation Li+/Na+/K+. Additional calculations suggest that the most favorable energetic pathway occurs through the reaction of a [Np(V)O2(OH)4]3&#8208; with the hydroxide radical to form [Np(VI)O2(OH)4]2&#8208;, followed by an additional oxidation with HO&#9679; to create [Np(VII)O4(OH)2]3&#8208;.</dc:description>

         <title>Type&#8208;I photodynamic therapy induced by Pt&#8208;coordination of type&#8208;II photosensitizers into supramolecular complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Platinum supramolecular complexes based on photosensitizers have garnered great interest in photodynamic therapy (PDT) due to Pt (II) centers as chemotherapeutic agents to eliminate tumor cells completely, which greatly improve the antitumor efficacy of PDT. However, in comparison to precursor photosensitizer ligand, the formed platinum supramolecular complexes typically exhibit inferior outcomes in terms of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. How to boost ROS generation in the formed platinum supramolecular complexes for enhanced PDT is an enticing yet highly challenging task. Here we report a Pt&#8208;coordination&#8208;based dimeric photosensitizer complex (Cz&#8208;BTZ&#8208;Py)2Pt(OTf)2. It is found that comparing with photosensitizer ligand Cz&#8208;BTZ&#8208;Py, the formed supramolecular complex exhibit redshifts of absorption wavelength as well as enhanced ROS generation efficiency. Moreover, type&#8208;I ROS generation (O2&#8226;&#8208;) is produced in the formed platinum supramolecular complexes mainly due to a reduced energy gap &#916;EST resulting from exciton coupling between two photosensitizer ligands. And type&#8208;I ROS (O2&#8226;&#8208;) generation significantly amplifies the photodynamic therapy (PDT) outcomes. In vitro evaluation shows excellent photochemotherapy performance of (Cz&#8208;BTZ&#8208;Py)2Pt(OTf)2 nanoparticles. We anticipate this work would provide a novel approach to design type&#8208;I photosensitizers for efficient PDT.</dc:description>

         <title>Metal&#8208;organic framework&#8208;derived two&#8208;dimensional in&#8208;plane Janus catalysts promoting oxygen electroreduction to hydrogen peroxide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) materials were used as the precursor to synthesize carbon based two&#8208;dimensional (2D) Janus architecture composed of In2S3&#8722;In2O3 (In&#8722;S&#8722;O) nanoparticles. The 2D in&#8208;plane Janus catalysts has exhibited excellent electrochemical performances promoting oxygen electroreduction to hydrogen peroxide, owning to its abundant electrochemical active sites and large specific surface area.







Abstract
We use MOFs material as precursor to synthesize carbon based two&#8208;dimensional (2D) materials loaded with In2S3&#8722;In2O3 (In&#8722;S&#8722;O) nanoparticles. The In&#8722;S&#8722;O nanoparticles have exhibited Janus architecture composed of two compounds with different crystal structures that are combined in&#8208;plane on 2D carbon material surface. The excellent properties of this in&#8208;plane Janus material include 2D nanoarchitecture and its Janus properties formed by combining two different crystal structures. It has exhibited excellent electrochemical performances due to its abundant electrochemical active sites and large specific surface area. According to experiments, the electron transfer number of the material for two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction is about 2.4, and the hydrogen peroxide yield is 32&#8197;mg/h&#8201;cm2. In the further test of liquid flow electrolytic cell, the yield can reach up to 172&#8197;mg/h&#8201;cm2.

         <title>Hole&#8208;Transporting Materials based on Oligo(hetero)aryls with a Naphthodithiophene Core &#8211; Succinct Synthesis by Twofold Direct C&#8722;H Olefination</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
For the first time, C&#8722;H/C&#8722;H cross&#8208;dehydrogenative couplings (direct C&#8722;H olefinations) are used as key step to access small&#8208;molecule hole&#8208;transporting materials (HTMs). NDT core&#8208;based HTMs incorporating additional olefins as &#960;&#8208;spacers substantially improve the PCE of perovskite solar cells of up to 17.2&#8201;%.







Abstract
This work demonstrated the first synthetic application of direct C&#8722;H olefinations in the step&#8208;saving preparation of various hole&#8208;transporting materials (HTM) for efficient perovskite solar cells (PSC). Cross&#8208;dehydrogenative couplings of naphthodithiophene (NDT) with vinyl arenes under palladium&#8208;catalysis facilely generated various new oligo(hetero)aryls with internal alkenes. Reaction conditions were optimized, which gave the product isolated yields of up to 71&#8201;% with high (E)&#8208;stereoselectivity. These readily accessible NDT core&#8208;based small molecules involving olefin as &#960;&#8208;spacers displayed immediate power conversion efficiencies of up to 17.2&#8201;% without a device oxidation process that is required for the commercially available spiro&#8208;OMeTAD and most other existing HTMs while fabricated in corresponding PSC devices.

         <dc:description>
Extensive DFT calculations show that both radical HCAr2&#8901; and carbocation HCAr2+ are thermally accessible from the bulky phosphonium Mes3P&#8722;CHAr2+, which are further kinetically favored by HCAr2&#8901; radical self&#8208;dimerization and by nucleophilic alkene trapping, respectively.







Abstract
Recent reports of radical formation within frustrated Lewis pairs (FLPs) suggested that single&#8208;electron transfer (SET) could play an important role in their chemistry especially for C&#8722;C coupling. In sharp contrast, our extensive dispersion&#8208;corrected DFT calculations show that although reactive benzhydryl radical along with phosphine radical cation species can be kinetically generated from bulky phosphines and benzhydryl cation, direct P&#8722;C hetero&#8208;coupling may lead to bulky phosphonium cation as reactive carbocation transfer reagents to styrene substrates, which is kinetically much more favorable than the recently proposed radical C&#8722;C coupling between benzhydryl radical and styrene. Similarly, meta&#8208;stable radical cation Mes3P+&#8901; salt is also kinetically accessible via SET reactions of Mes3P and B(C6F5)3 with 0.5 equivalent of p&#8208;O2C6Cl4.

         <title>Construction of Multifunctional Covalent Organic Frameworks for Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photoactive TAPA&#8722;BPy&#8722;COF and its metalated Pd@TAPA&#8722;BPy&#8722;COF, which can both serve as the efficient reusable photocatalysts for photocatalytic applications, are reported.







Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have recently drawn intense attention due to their potential applications in photocatalysis. Herein, we report a multifunctional COF which consists of triphenylamine (TPA) and 2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine (2, 2&#8242;&#8208;bipy) entities. The obtained TAPA&#8722;BPy&#8722;COF is a heterogeneous photocatalyst and can efficiently catalyze the oxidative coupling of thiols to disulfides. In addition, TAPA&#8722;BPy&#8722;COF can be further metalated by Pd(II) via 2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipy&#8722;metal coordination. The generated Pd@TAPA&#8722;BPy&#8722;COF can highly promote photocatalytic synthesis of 3&#8208;cyanopyridines via cascade addition/cyclization of arylboronic acids with &#947;&#8208;ketodinitriles in heterogeneous way. This work has demonstrated the way for the rational design and preparation of more efficient photoactive COFs for photocatalysis.

         <title>A Torquoselective Thermal 6&#960;&#8208;Electrocyclization Approach to 1,4&#8208;Cyclohexadienes via Solvent&#8208;Aided Proton Transfer: Experimental and Theoretical Studies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The thermal 6&#960;&#8208;electrocyclization of hexatriene typically delivers 1,3&#8208;cyclohexadiene (1,3&#8208;CHD). However, there is only limited success in directly synthesizing 1,4&#8208;cyclohexadiene (1,4&#8208;CHD) using such an approach, probably due to the difficulty in realizing thermally&#8208;forbidden 1,3&#8208;hydride shift after electrocyclic ring closure. The present study shows that by heating (2E,4E,6E)&#8208;hexatrienes bearing ester or ketone substituents at the C1&#8208;position in a mixture of toluene/MeOH or EtOH (2:1) solvents at 90&#8208;100 &#176;C, 1,4&#8208;CHDs can be selectively synthesized. This is achieved through a torquoselective disrotatory 6&#960;&#8208;electrocyclic ring closure followed by a proton&#8208;transfer process. The success of this method depends on the polar protic solvent&#8208;assisted intramolecular proton transfer from 1,3&#8208;CHD to 1,4&#8208;CHD, which has been confirmed by deuterium&#8208;labeling experiments. There are no reports to date for such a solvent&#8208;assisted isomerization. Density functional theory (DFT) studies have suggested that forming 1,3&#8208;CHD and subsequent isomerization is a thermodynamically feasible process, regardless of the functional groups involved. Two possible successive polar solvent&#8208;assisted proton&#8208;transfer pathways have been identified for isomerization.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthetic control of atropoisomerism along C&#9472;N bonds is a major challenge, and methods that allow C&#9472;N atroposelective bond formation are rare. This is a problem because each atropoisomer can feature starkly differentiated biological properties. Yet, among the three most practical and applicable classical amination methods available: 1) the Cu&#8208;catalyzed Ullmann&#8208;Goldberg reaction, 2) the Pd&#8208;catalyzed Buchwald&#8208;Hartwig reaction, and 3) the Cu&#8208;catalyzed Chan&#8208;Evans&#8208;Lam reaction, none has truly been rendered atroposelective at the newly formed C&#9472;N bond. The first ever Chan&#8208;Evans&#8208;Lam atroposelective amination is herein described with a simple copper catalyst and newly designed PyrOx chiral ligand. This method should find important applications in asymmetric synthesis, in particular for medicinal chemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhanced Orientation of Liquid Crystals Inside Micropores of Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks Having Thermoresponsivity</title>

         <dc:description>With the aim of controlling the orientation of liquid crystals (LCs) toward realizing external stimuli&#8211;responsive materials with tunable functionalities, we synthesized a composite of LCs and metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) by filling LCs into the pores of MOFs (LC@MOFs) for the first time. The included LCs interact with the MOFs through coordination bonds between the cyano groups of the LCs and the metal ions of the MOFs, enabling the orientation of the LC molecules inside the pores of the MOFs and the realization of birefringence of LC@MOFs. The three&#8208;dimensional nanometer interstice frameworks maintained the LC orientation even at temperatures much higher than the isotropic phase transition temperature of bulk LCs. Furthermore, the orientational state changed upon heating or cooling, inducing temperature&#8208;dependent birefringence. This study provides a new approach to the development of stimuli&#8211;responsive optical materials and stimuli&#8211;responsive MOFs.</dc:description>

         <title>Charge&#8208;Assisted Ionic Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Frameworks: Designable and Stabilized Multifunctional Materials</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) are a class of crystalline framework materials assembled by hydrogen bonds. HOFs have the advantages of high crystallinity, mild reaction conditions, good solution processability, and reproducibility. Coupled with the reversibility and flexibility of hydrogen bonds, HOFs can be assembled into a wide diversity of crystalline structures. Since the bonding energy of hydrogen bonds is lower than that of ligand and covalent bonds, the framework of HOFs is prone to collapse after desolventisation and the stability is not high, which limits the development and application of HOFs. In recent years, numerous stable and functional HOFs have been developed by &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking, highly interpenetrated networks, charge&#8208;assisted, ligand&#8208;bond&#8208;assisted, molecular weaving, and covalent cross&#8208;linking. Charge&#8208;assisted ionic HOFs introduce electrostatic attraction into HOFs to improve stability while enriching structural diversity and functionality. In this paper, we review the development, the principles of rational design and assembly of charge&#8208;assisted ionic HOFs, introduces the different building block construction modes of charge&#8208;assisted ionic HOFs. Highlight the applications of charge&#8208;assisted ionic HOFs in gas adsorption and separation, proton conduction, biological applications, etc., and prospects for the diverse design of charge&#8208;assisted ionic HOFs structures and multifunctional applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Aerobic Asymmetric Allylic C&#8208;H Alkylation by Synergistic Chiral Primary Amine&#8208;Palladium&#8208;Hydroquinone Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A synergistic chiral primary amine/palladium /p&#8208;hydroquinone catalysis was developed to facilitate oxidative asymmetric allylic C&#8208;H alkylation under aerobic conditions. The ternary synergistic catalysis enables a facile allylic C&#8208;H activation and alkylation with oxygen so that stoichiometric utilization of benzoquinone can be avoided. The identified optimal catalytic system allows for terminal addition to allyl arenes with &#945;&#8208;branched &#946;&#8208;ketocarbonyls to afford allylic adducts bearing all&#8208;carbon quaternary centers with high regio&#8208; and enantioselectivity. This work provides new insights for further studies on the aerobically oxidative C&#8208;H alkylation reaction.</dc:description>

         <title>&#8220;Covalent&#8208;Disassembly&#8221;&#8208;Based Approaches For Sensing Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The detection of analytes with small molecular probes is crucial for the analysis and understanding of chemical, medicinal, environmental and biological situations as well as processes. Classic detection approaches rely on the concept of molecular recognition and bond formation reactions. Bond breakage reactions have been less explored in similar contexts. This concept article introduces metal&#8208;salen and metal&#8208;imine complexes as &#8220;covalent&#8208;disassembly&#8221;&#8208;based (DB)&#8208;probes for detecting polyoxophosphates, thiols, amino acids, HCN and changes in pH. It discusses the roles, importance and combinations of structurally functionalized molecular building blocks in the construction of DB&#8208;probes. Applications of optimized DB&#8208;probes for analyte detection in live cells and foodstuff are also discussed. Furthermore, the mechanism of the disassembly of a Fe(III)&#8208;salen probe upon pyrophosphate binding is presented. Extraordinary selectivity for this analyte was achieved by a multistep disassembly sequence including an unprecedented structural change of the metal complex (i.e. &#8220;induced&#8208;fit&#8221; principle). Design principles of probes for sensing applications following the &#8220;covalent&#8208;disassembly&#8221; approach are summarized, which will help improving current systems, but will also facilitate the development of new DB&#8208;probes for challenging analytic targets.</dc:description>

         <title>Conformational Preferences at the Glycosidic Linkage of Saccharides in Solution as Deduced from NMR Experiments and MD Simulations: Comparison to Crystal Structures</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Glycans are central to information content and regulation in biological systems. These carbohydrate molecules are active either as oligo&#8208; or polysaccharides, often as glycoconjugates. The conformational preferences and population distributions at the glycosidic torsion angles &#981; and &#968; have been investigated for O&#8208;methyl glycosides of three disaccharides where the substitution takes place at a secondary alcohol. Stereochemical differences at or adjacent to the glycosidic linkage were explored by solution state NMR spectroscopy using one&#8208;dimensional 1H,1H&#8208;NOESY NMR experiments to obtain transglycosidic proton&#8208;proton distances and one&#8208; and two&#8208;dimensional heteronuclear NMR experiments to obtain 3JCH transglycosidic coupling constants related to torsion angles &#981; and &#968;. Computed effective proton&#8208;proton distances from molecular dynamics (MD) simulations showed excellent agreement to experimentally derived distances for the &#945;&#8208;(1&#8594;3)&#8208;linked disaccharides and revealed that for the bimodal distribution at the &#968; torsion angle for the &#945;&#8208;(1&#8594;4)&#8208;linked disaccharide experiment and simulation were at variance with each other, calling for further force field developments. The MD simulations disclosed a highly intricate inter&#8208;residue hydrogen bonding pattern for the &#945;&#8208;(1&#8594;4)&#8208;linked disaccharide, including a nonconventional hydrogen bond between H5' in the glucosyl residue and O3 in the galactosyl residue, supported by a large downfield 1H NMR chemical shift displacement compared to &#945;&#8208;d&#8208;Glcp&#8208;OMe.</dc:description>

         <title>Thermochromic Afterglow from Benzene&#8208;1,4&#8208;diboronic Acid&#8208;doped Co&#8208;crystals</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The accurate thermosensing requires a minimum impact of autofluorescence and light scattering from the samples. In this study, we discovered that benzene&#8208;1,4&#8208;diboronic acid (BDBA) doped co&#8208;crystals with trimethylolpropane (TMP) exhibit excellent thermochromic dual phosphorescence properties over a wide temperature range from &#8210;132 to 40&#176;C, despite its simple structure that does not have any donor&#8208;acceptor linkage. The dual phosphorescence was consisted of monomeric benzene&#8208;1,4&#8208;diboronate (BDBA ester) and aggregation&#8208;stabilized species. With an increase in temperature, the emission intensity from the monomeric state significantly decreased, whereas that originating from the aggregated state remained almost constant owing to the difference in their thermal stabilities. Further investigation revealed that molecular distortions in singlet excited states enable efficient intersystem crossing, causing efficient phosphorescence from the monomeric state of BDBA ester.</dc:description>

         <title>Nickel Carbide Nanoparticle Catalyst for Selective Hydrogenation of Nitriles to Primary Amines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Despite its unique physicochemical properties, the catalytic application of nickel carbide (Ni3C) in organic synthesis is rare. In this study, we report well&#8208;defined nanocrystalline Ni3C (nano&#8208;Ni3C) as a highly active catalyst for the selective hydrogenation of nitriles to primary amines. The activity of the aluminum&#8208;oxide&#8208;supported nano&#8208;Ni3C (nano&#8208;Ni3C/Al2O3) catalyst surpasses that of Ni nanoparticles. Various aromatic and aliphatic nitriles and dinitriles were successfully converted to the corresponding primary amines under mild conditions (1 bar H2 pressure). Furthermore, the nano&#8208;Ni3C/Al2O3 catalyst was reusable and applicable to gram&#8208;scale experiments. Density functional theory calculations suggest the formation of polar hydrogen species on the nano&#8208;Ni3C surface, which were attributed to the high activity of nano&#8208;Ni3C towards nitrile hydrogenation. This study demonstrates the utility of metal carbides as a new class of catalysts for liquid&#8208;phase organic reactions.</dc:description>

This study demonstrates the utility of metal carbides as a new class of catalysts for liquid-phase organic reactions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Starfruit&#8208;shaped Zirconium metal&#8208;organic frameworks (SMOF), with edge&#8208;sharing two&#8208;dimensional (2D) nanosheet petals, can form spontaneously from the transformation of three&#8208;dimensional (3D) MOF crystals in a solvothermal synthesis. The distinct morphology of SMOF showcases superior catalytic activity in detoxifying G&#8208;type nerve agent and blister agent simulants, surpassing that of its 3D counterparts.







Abstract
We present the fabrication of a novel Starfruit&#8208;shaped metal&#8208;organic framework (SMOF) composed of zirconium and Tetra(4&#8208;carboxyphenyl)porphine linkers. The SMOF exhibits a unique morphology with edge&#8208;sharing two&#8208;dimensional (2D) nanosheet petals. Our investigation unravels a captivating transformation process, wherein three&#8208;dimensional (3D) shuttle&#8208;shaped MOFs form initially and subsequently evolve into 2D nanosheet&#8208;based SMOF structures. The distinct morphology of SMOF showcases superior catalytic activity in detoxifying G&#8208;type nerve agent and blister agent simulants, surpassing that of its 3D counterparts. This discovery of the 3D&#8208;to&#8208;2D transition growth pathway unlocks exciting opportunities for exploring novel strategies in advanced MOF nanostructure development, not only for catalysis but also for various other applications.

         <title>Hybrid Membrane Composed of Nickel Diselenide Nanosheets with Carbon Nanotubes for Catalytic Conversion of Polysulfides in Lithium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hybrid membrane composed of nickel diselenide nanosheets (NSN) modified carbon nanotubes (CNTs) has been succeeded in preparing via hydrothermal and vacuum filtration technology. The three&#8208;dimensional networks of CNTs facilitate the transport of electrons and ions. In this process, NSN acts as catalytic centers, thereby accelerating the redox conversion of polysulfide species remarkably elevating the cycle performance of the battery.







Abstract
Lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries demonstrate enormous energy density are promising forms of energy storage. Unfortunately, the slow redox kinetics and polysulfides shuttle effect are some of the factors that prevent the its development. To address these issues, the hybrid membrane with combination of nickel diselenide nanosheets modified carbon nanotubes (NSN@CNTs) and utilized Li2S6 catholyte for lithium sulfur battery. The conductive CNTs facilitates fast electronic/ionic transport, while the polarity of NSN as a strong affinity to lithium polysulfides, effectively anchoring them, facilitating the redox conversion of polysulfide species, and effectively diminishing reaction barriers. The cell with NSN@CNTs delivers the first discharge capacity of 1123.8&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 and maintains 786.5&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 300&#8197;cycles (0.2&#8197;C) at the sulfur loading 5.4&#8197;mg. Its rate capability is commendable, enabling it to sustain a capacity of 559.8&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 even at a high discharge rate of 2&#8197;C. In addition, its initial discharge capacity can remain 8.33&#8197;mAh even at 10.8&#8197;mg for duration of 100&#8197;cycles. This research indicates the potential application of NSN@CNTs hybrid materials in lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries.

         <title>Aerobic Catalytic Cross&#8208;Dehydrogenative Coupling of Furans with Indoles Provides Access to Fluorophores with Large Stokes Shift</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a general cross&#8208;dehydrogenative coupling between furans and indoles using earth&#8208;abundant metal catalyst FeCl3.6H2O in presence of oxygen. The reaction displayed scalability and aqueous compatibility, thus making it practical, operationally simple, and sustainable. The products were found to possess fluorescence properties with remarkable Stokes&#8217; shift of upto 205&#8197;nm.







Abstract
Sustainability in chemical processes is a crucial aspect in contemporary chemistry with sustainable catalysis as a vital parameter of the same. There has been a renewed focus on utilizing earth&#8208;abundant metal catalysts to expand the repertoire of organic reactions. Furan is a versatile heterocycle of natural origin used for multiple applications. However, it has scarcely been used in cross&#8208;dehydrogenative coupling. In this work, we have explored the cross&#8208;dehydrogentive coupling of furans with indoles using commonly available, inexpensive FeCl3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;6H2O (&lt;0.25&#8197;$/g) as catalyst in the presence of so called &#8216;ultimate oxidant&#8217; &#8211; oxygen, without the need for any external ligand or additive. The reactions were found to be scalable and to work even under partially aqueous conditions. This makes the reaction highly economical, practical, operationally simple and sustainable. The methodology provides direct access to &#960;&#8208;conjugated short oligomers consisting of furan, thiophene and indole. These compounds were found to show interesting fluorescence properties with remarkably large Stokes shift (up to 205&#8197;nm). Mechanistic investigations reveal that the reaction proceeds through chemoselective oxidation of indole by the metal catalyst followed by nucleophilic trapping by furan.

         <title>Soft multi&#8208;layer actuators integrated with the functions of electrical energy harvest and storage</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Integrating functions such as energy harvesting and storage with actuators to create intelligent actuators has emerged as a growing trend in development. By functionalizing actuation materials, they can take on a range of capabilities including energy harvesting, conversion, and storage. We provide a detailed introduction to smart actuators equipped with these functions, covering design concepts, typical applications, and future prospects.







Abstract
Soft multi&#8208;layer actuators are smart, lightweight, and flexible, which can be used in a wide range of fields such as artificial muscles, advanced medical devices, and wearable devices. The research on the actuation property of the soft actuators has made significant progress, paving the way for the controllable motions of the actuators. However, compared with the intelligence and adaptability of life in nature, these actuators still have the problem of insufficient intelligence. The phenomenon is reflected in a lack of continuous supply of energy. Therefore, it has become a development trend to combine functions such as energy harvesting, storage, and conversion with actuators to build intelligent actuators. This concept presents a synopsis of the advancements made in soft actuators that have been coupled with the capabilities of electrical energy harvesting and storage. The design concepts and typical applications of this soft smart actuators are introduced in detail.

     alt="Soft multi-layer actuators integrated with the functions of electrical energy harvest and storage"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Integrating functions such as energy harvesting and storage with actuators to create intelligent actuators has emerged as a growing trend in development. By functionalizing actuation materials, they can take on a range of capabilities including energy harvesting, conversion, and storage. We provide a detailed introduction to smart actuators equipped with these functions, covering design concepts, typical applications, and future prospects.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soft multi-layer actuators are smart, lightweight, and flexible, which can be used in a wide range of fields such as artificial muscles, advanced medical devices, and wearable devices. The research on the actuation property of the soft actuators has made significant progress, paving the way for the controllable motions of the actuators. However, compared with the intelligence and adaptability of life in nature, these actuators still have the problem of insufficient intelligence. The phenomenon is reflected in a lack of continuous supply of energy. Therefore, it has become a development trend to combine functions such as energy harvesting, storage, and conversion with actuators to build intelligent actuators. This concept presents a synopsis of the advancements made in soft actuators that have been coupled with the capabilities of electrical energy harvesting and storage. The design concepts and typical applications of this soft smart actuators are introduced in detail. Finally, the future research directions and applications of smart actuators are prospected from our perspective.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Tumor Targeted Cuprous&#8208;Based Nanocomposite as Responsive Cascade Nanocatalyst for Efficient Tumor Synergistic Therapy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cascade nanocatalytic reaction system is fabricated. The reasonable combination of the high catalytic efficiency derived from Cu+, in&#8197;situ generation of endogenous H2O2 and consumption of intratumoral glucose induced by GOx, and the upregulation of ROS level evoked by selenocompounds has resulted in the excellent synergistic therapeutic effect in cancer treatment.







Abstract
The single&#8208;functionality of traditional chemodynamic therapy (CDT) reagents usually limits the therapeutic efficacy of cancer treatment. Synergistic nanocomposites that involve cascade reaction provide a promising strategy to achieve satisfactory anticancer effects. Herein, a cuprous&#8208;based nanocomposite (CCS@GOx@HA) is fabricated, which owns the tumor targeting ability and can undergo tumor microenvironment responsive cascade reaction to enhance the tumor therapeutic efficiency significantly. Surface modification of nanocomposite with hyaluronic acid enables the targeted delivery of the nanocomposite to cancer cells. Acid&#8208;triggered decomposition of nanocomposite in cancer cell results in the release of Cu+, Se2&#8722; and GOx. The Cu+ improves the Fenton&#8208;like reaction with endogenous H2O2 to generate highly toxic &#8226;&#8201;OH for CDT. While GOx can not only catalyze the in&#8197;situ generation of endogenous H2O2, but also accelerate the consumption of intratumoral glucose to reduce nutrient supply in tumor site. In addition, Se2&#8722; further improves the therapeutic effects of CDT by upregulating the reactive oxygen species (ROS) in tumor cells. Meanwhile, the surface modification endows the nanocomposite the good water dispersibility and biocompatibility. Moreover, in&#8197;vitro and in&#8197;vivo experiments demonstrate satisfactory anti&#8208;cancer therapeutic performance by the synergistic cascade function of CCS@GOx@HA than CDT alone.

         <title>[3+2] Cycloaddition of Alkynyl Boronates and in&#8197;situ Generated Azomethine Ylide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
[3+2] cycloaddition of alkynyl boronates and in&#8197;situ generated azomethine ylide is used for the selective scalable synthesis of pyrroline&#8208; and diazabicyclo[3.3.0]octane&#8208;derived boronates (i.&#8201;e., 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 and 1&#8201;:&#8201;2 cycloadducts). The C&#8722;C and C&#8722;heteroatom bond&#8208;forming reactions of the obtained building blocks illustrate their utility for organic synthesis and drug discovery.







Abstract
Scalable [3+2] cycloaddition of alkynyl boronates and in&#8197;situ generated unstabilized azomethine ylide is reported for the first time. The selective formation of either 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 or 1&#8201;:&#8201;2 cycloaddition products was achieved by carefully optimizing the reaction conditions, mainly by controlling the reactant stoichiometry, catalyst loading, and internal temperature. The developed protocol tolerated many valuable functional groups, including TMS, protected alcohol (as ether or THP derivatives), or aldehyde (as acetal). Further common C&#8722;C and C&#8722;heteroatom bond&#8208;forming reactions, as well as scaled&#8208;up procedures demonstrate the utility of the prepared compounds as building blocks for organic synthesis and drug discovery.

         <title>Enhancing Fluorescence in Both Solution and Solid States Induced by Imine Cage Formation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The imine&#8208;bonded TPE&#8208;cage exhibits a remarkable enhancement (~520&#8208;fold) in fluorescence emission compared to the building block TPE&#8208;TA in both solution and solid states, highlighting the effect of rigidification&#8208;induced fluorescence enhancement.







Abstract
Developing luminescent materials that exhibit strong emissions in both solution and solid phases is highly desirable and challenging. Herein, we report imine&#8208;bond directed formation of a rigid organic cage (TPE&#8208;cage) that was synthesized by [2+4] imine condensation of a TPE&#8208;cored tetra&#8208;aldehyde (TPE&#8208;TA) with a clip&#8208;like diamine (XA) to illustrate confinement&#8208;induced fluorescence enhancement. Compared to the non&#8208;emissive TPE&#8208;TA (&#981;F=0.26&#8201;%) in the dichloromethane (DCM) solution, the TPE&#8208;cage achieved a remarkable (~520&#8208;fold) emission enhancement (&#981;F=70.38&#8201;%). In contrast, a monomeric tetra&#8208;imine model compound (TPE&#8208;model) showed only a minor enhancement (&#981;F=0.56&#8201;%) in emission compared to the parent tetra&#8208;aldehyde TPE&#8208;TA. The emission of TPE&#8208;cage was further enhanced by ~1.5&#8208;fold (&#981;F=80.96&#8201;%) in the aggregated state owing to aggregation&#8208;induced emission enhancement (AIEE). This approach establishes the potential for synthesizing luminescent materials with high emission in both solution and solid&#8208;state by employing a single&#8208;step imine condensation reaction.

         <title>Construction of Oligorotaxanes with Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Aramide Macrocycles through Threaded Host&#8208;Guest Complexation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This concept article presents the use of two&#8208;dimensional hydrogen&#8208;bonded aramide macrocycles for the synthesis of main&#8208;chain [n]rotaxanes through host&#8208;guest complexation. The shape&#8208;persistency, self&#8208;assembly, and modular units of macrocycles dictate the molecular recognition and synthetic efficiency of these interlocked structures, highlighting the uniqueness of hydrogen&#8208;bonded macrocycles in forming oligorotaxanes.







Abstract
The development of efficient and selective organic synthetic approaches for complex molecules has garnered significant attention due to the need for precise control over molecular structures and functions. Rotaxanes, a type of mechanically interlocked molecules (MIMs), have shown promising applications in various fields including sensing, catalysis, and material science. However, the highly selective synthesis of oligo[n]rotaxanes (mostly n&#8805;3) through controlling host&#8208;guest complexation and supramolecular threading assembly process still remains an ongoing challenge. In particular, the utilization of two&#8208;dimensional (2D) macrocycles with structural shape&#8208;persistency for the synthesis of oligo[n]rotaxanes is rare. In this concept, research on cooperatively threaded host&#8208;guest complexation with hydrogen&#8208;bonded (H&#8208;bonded) aramide macrocycles and selective synthetic protocols of oligo[n]rotaxanes has been summarized. The high efficiency and selectivity in synthesis are ascribed to the synergistic interplay of multiple non&#8208;covalent bonding interactions such as hydrogen bonding and intermolecular &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking of macrocycles within the unique supramolecular structure of threaded host&#8208;guest complexes. This review focuses on the latest progress in the concepts, synthesis, and properties of H&#8208;bonded aramide macrocycle&#8208;based oligorotaxanes, and presents an in&#8208;depth outlook on challenges in this emerging field.

         <title>Skeletal Editing through Molecular Recombination of 2H&#8208;Indazoles to Azo&#8208;Linked&#8208;Quinazolinones</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient and environmentally benign single step methodology has been established for selectfluor mediated single atom skeletal manipulation of 2H&#8208;indazoles through internal C&#8208;atom insertion. Water&#8208;O18 labelling experiment confirms the carbonyl oxygen source is H2O.







Abstract
A new protocol by the combinatory use of two equivalent of indazoles starting material with one being the carbon source via its C3&#8208;reactivity and the other, the coupling partner has been developed for the selectfluor&#8208;mediated single atom skeletal editing of 2H&#8208;indazoles. The azo&#8208;linked&#8208;2,3&#8208;disubstituted quinazolin&#8208;4&#8208;one derivatives were obtained through a carbon atom insertion between the two nitrogens of the indazole ring and simultaneous oxidation at C3 position of both indazole moieties. Mechanistic investigations reveal that the amidic carbonyl oxygen of the product is derived from water and the reaction proceeds through in&#8208;situ generated N&#8208;centred indazolone radical intermediate.

         <title>Photo&#8208;controllable Ultralong Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence: State of the Art</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The text for Table of Contents: Dynamic persistent luminescence would endow optoelectronic devices with revolutionary performance. In this concept, we have highlighted the recent progress in the photo&#8208;switchable room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) of a series of materials and their potential applications. We also provided a perspective on the future challenges and opportunities for the materials with dynamic phosphorescence.







Abstract
In this concept, we showcase the upsurge in the studies of dynamic ultralong room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) materials containing inorganic and/or organic components as versatile photo&#8208;responsive platforms. The goal is to provide a comprehensive analysis of photo&#8208;controllable RTP, and meanwhile delve into the underlying RTP properties of various classes of photochromic materials including metal&#8208;organic complexes, organic&#8208;inorganic co&#8208;crystals, purely organic small molecules and organic polymers. In particular, the design principles governing the integration of the photochromic and RTP moieties within a single material system, and the tuning of dynamic RTP in response to light are emphasized. As such, this concept sheds light on the challenges and opportunities of using these tunable RTP materials for potential applications in optoelectronics, particularly highlighting their use of reversible information encryption, erasable light printing and rewritable smart paper.

         <title>Sn Bulk Phase Doping and Surface Modification on Ti4O7 for Oxygen Reduction to Hydrogen Peroxide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
D&#8722;Sn&#8722;Ti4O7 was obtained by simple polymerization post&#8208;calcination method as a high&#8208;efficiency 2e&#8208; ORR electrocatalyst to produce H2O2. For the D&#8722;Sn&#8722;Ti4O7, the doping of Sn not only improves the conductivity but also leads to Ti4O7 lattice distortion, which further forms more oxygen vacancies and Ti3+, This can reduce the binding energy of *OOH, which is conducive to the production of H2O2 by 2e&#8722; ORR. It exhibits a starting potential of 0.769&#8197;V in 0.1&#8197;M KOH solution, which is close to the theoretical starting potential of 2e&#8722; ORR (0.764&#8197;V), and H2O2 selectivity is as high as 95.7&#8201;%.







Abstract
Developing stable and highly selective two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction (2e&#8722; ORR) electrocatalysts for producing hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is considered a major challenge to replace the anthraquinone process and achieve a sustainable green economy. Here, we doped Sn into Ti4O7 (D&#8722;Sn&#8722;Ti4O7) by simple polymerization post&#8208;calcination method as a high&#8208;efficiency 2e&#8722; ORR electrocatalyst. In addition, we also applied plain calcination after the grinding method to load Sn on Ti4O7 (L&#8722;Sn&#8722;Ti4O7) as a comparison. However, the performance of L&#8722;Sn&#8722;Ti4O7 is far inferior to that of the D&#8722;Sn&#8722;Ti4O7. D&#8722;Sn&#8722;Ti4O7 exhibits a starting potential of 0.769&#8197;V (versus the reversible hydrogen electrode, RHE) and a high H2O2 selectivity of 95.7&#8201;%. Excitingly, the catalyst can maintain a stable current density of 2.43&#8197;mA&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;cm&#8722;2 for 3600&#8197;s in our self&#8208;made H&#8208;type cell, and the cumulative H2O2 production reaches 359.2&#8197;mg&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;L&#8722;1 within 50,000&#8197;s at 0.3&#8197;V. The performance of D&#8722;Sn&#8722;Ti4O7 is better than that of the non&#8208;noble metal 2e&#8722; ORR catalysts reported so far. The doping of Sn not only improves the conductivity but also leads to the lattice distortion of Ti4O7, further forming more oxygen vacancies and Ti3+, which greatly improves its 2e&#8722; ORR performance compared with the original Ti4O7. In contrast, since the Sn on the surface of L&#8722;Sn&#8722;Ti4O7 displays a synergistic effect with Tin+ (3&#8804;n&#8804;4) of Ti4O7, the active center Tin+ dissociates the O=O bond, making it more inclined to 4e&#8722; ORR.

         <title>Chiral 4&#8208;MeO&#8208;Pyridine (MOPY) Catalyst for Enantioselective Cyclopropanation: Attenuation of Lewis Basicity Leads to Improved Catalytic Efficiency</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rational design of Lewis base catalyst by fine&#8208;tuning of pyridine Lewis basicity has allowed for the development of chiral 4&#8208;MeO&#8208;pyridine (MOPY) catalyst for enantioselective cyclopropanation.







Abstract
The design of pyridine&#8208;derived organocatalysts aims at the increase of their Lewis basicity, however such an approach is not always efficient. For example, strongly Lewis basic DMAP is completely inefficient as catalyst in the cyclopropanation reaction. Herein we disclose an alternative approach that relies on attenuation of DMAP Lewis basicity. Specifically, the replacement of 4&#8208;dimethylamino substituent in DMAP for 4&#8208;MeO group delivered a highly efficient catalyst for cyclopropanation of electron&#8208;deficient olefins with &#945;&#8208;bromoketones. Kinetic studies provide compelling evidence that the superior catalytic efficiency of 4&#8208;MeO pyridine (MOPY) is to be attributed to the favorable balance between Lewis basicity and leaving group ability. The use of chiral, enantiomerically pure MOPY catalyst has helped to achieve high enantioselectivities (up to 91&#8201;:&#8201;9 er) in the previously unreported pyridine&#8208;catalyzed cyclopropanation reaction.

Pt complexes could be developed into chemoimmunotherapeutic agents as inducers of immunogenic cell death, inhibitors of immune checkpoint, stimulators of immune response, relievers of immunosupression, or modulators of immune signal. They reshape the tumor microenvironment and reinforce the antitumor activity.







Abstract
Platinum complexes are potential antitumor drugs in chemotherapy. Their impact on tumor treatment could be greatly strengthened by combining with immunotherapy. Increasing evidences indicate that the antitumor activity of platinum complexes is not limited to chemical killing effects, but also extends to immunomodulatory actions. This review introduced the general concept of chemoimmunotherapy and summarized the progress of platinum complexes as chemoimmunotherapeutic agents in recent years. Platinum complexes could be developed into inducers of immunogenic cell death, blockers of immune checkpoint, regulators of immune signaling pathway, and modulators of tumor immune microenvironment, etc. The synergy between chemotherapeutic and immunomodulatory effects reinforces the antitumor activity of platinum complexes, and helps them circumvent the drug resistance and systemic toxicity. The exploration of platinum complexes for chemoimmunotherapy may create new opportunities to revive the discovery of metal anticancer drugs.

         <title>Rhodium&#8208;Mediated Dehydrogenation of Hydroboranes and Group 14 Compounds: Base&#8208;Stabilized Silylene and Germylene Complexes vs. Transmetalation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dehydrogenation of Group 13 and 14 substrates has been explored by using a rhodium pincer complex. While primary and secondary silanes and germanes are able to release H2 (blast off!), generating silylene and germylene compounds, the grounded boron and tin symbolize synthetic challenges with respect to this process. The same rhodium complex is able to catalyze the dehydrogenative coupling of silanes/germanes with pinacol; an example product is illustrated as a constellation in the night sky. More information can be found in the Research Article by S.&#8208;J. Hsiang and P.&#8197;G. Hayes (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202302925).

         <title>Preparation of carbon&#8208;coated Fe2O3@Ti3C2Tx composites by mussel&#8208;like modifications as high&#8208;performance anodes for lithium&#8208;ion batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Carbon&#8208;coated Fe2O3@Ti3C2Tx composites as high&#8208;performance anode were synthesized by a mussel&#8208;like modification method, where electronegative group (&#8722;OH) on polydopamine can easily coordinate with Fe3+ ions as well as form hydrogen bonds with the &#8722;OH terminal group on the Ti3C2Tx surface, which induces a uniform distribution of Fe2O3 on the Ti3C2Tx surface. Meanwhile, the polydopamine&#8208;derived carbon layer protects Ti3C2Tx from oxidation.







Abstract
Fe2O3 with high theoretical capacity (1007&#8197;mA&#8201;h&#8201;g&#8722;1) and low cost is a potential anode material for lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs), but its practical application is restricted by its low electrical conductivity and large volume changes during lithiation/delithiation. To solve these problems, Fe2O3@Ti3C2Tx composites were synthesized by a mussel&#8208;like modification method, which relies on the self&#8208;polymerization of dopamine under mild conditions. During polymerization, the electronegative group (&#8722;OH) on dopamine can easily coordinate with Fe3+ ions as well as form hydrogen bonds with the &#8722;OH terminal group on the surface of Ti3C2Tx, which induces a uniform distribution of Fe2O3 on the Ti3C2Tx surface and mitigates self&#8208;accumulation of MXene nanosheets. In addition, the polydopamine&#8208;derived carbon layer protects Ti3C2Tx from oxidation during the hydrothermal process, which can further improve the electrical conductivity of the composites and buffer the volume expansion and particle agglomeration of Fe2O3. As a result, Fe2O3@Ti3C2Tx anodes exhibit ~100&#8201;% capacity retention with almost no capacity loss at 0.5&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 250 cycles, and a stable capacity of 430&#8197;mA&#8201;h&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 2&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 500 cycles. The unique structural design of this work provides new ideas for the development of MXene&#8208;based composites in energy storage applications.

         <title>Synthesis of Trifluoromethylated Monoterpenes by an Engineered Cytochrome P450</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The carbene transfer reaction was realized in the biosynthetic pathway. Using L&#8208;limonene as the precursor, L&#8208;carveol was biotransformed by P411&#8208;PFA to generate unnatural terpenoid derivatives with trifluoromethyl group.







Abstract
Protein engineering of cytochrome P450s has enabled these biocatalysts to promote a variety of abiotic reactions beyond nature&#8216;s repertoire. Integrating such non&#8208;natural transformations with microbial biosynthetic pathways could allow sustainable enzymatic production of modified natural product derivatives. In particular, trifluoromethylation is a highly desirable modification in pharmaceutical research due to the positive effects of the trifluoromethyl group on drug potency, bioavailability, and metabolic stability. This study demonstrates the biosynthesis of non&#8208;natural trifluoromethyl&#8208;substituted cyclopropane derivatives of natural monoterpene scaffolds using an engineered cytochrome P450 variant, P411&#8208;PFA. P411&#8208;PFA successfully catalyzed the transfer of a trifluoromethyl carbene from 2&#8208;diazo&#8208;1,1,1&#8208;trifluoroethane to the terminal alkenes of several monoterpenes, including L&#8208;carveol, carvone, perilla alcohol, and perillartine, to generate the corresponding trifluoromethylated cyclopropane products. Furthermore, integration of this abiotic cyclopropanation reaction with a reconstructed metabolic pathway for L&#8208;carveol production in Escherichia coli enabled one&#8208;step biosynthesis of a trifluoromethylated L&#8208;carveol derivative from limonene precursor. Overall, amalgamating synthetic enzymatic chemistry with established metabolic pathways represents a promising approach to sustainably produce bioactive natural product analogs.

         <title>Stepwise Functionalization of a Pillar[5]arene&#8208;Containing [2]Rotaxane with Pentafluorophenyl Ester Stoppers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The pillar[5]arene acts as an umbrella to protect the axle of the rotaxane from nucleophiles. Indeed, reaction of a nucleophile with the first activated ester stopper of a symmetrical rotaxane building block affords a mono&#8208;acylated intermediate in which the pillar[5]arene moiety is preferentially located close to the remaining pentafluorophenyl ester stopper. As a result, the accessibility of the second reactive carbonyl group by the nucleophilic reagent is limited, and selective mono&#8208;functionalization is very efficient. More information can be found in the Research Article by I. Nierengarten, J.&#8208;F. Nierengarten and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202303501).

         <title>Orbital Analysis Captures the Existence of a Mixed&#8208;Valent CuIII&#8722;O&#8722;CuII Active&#8208;Site and its Role in Water&#8208;Assisted Aliphatic Hydroxylation</title>

         <dc:description>The Cu&#8722;O&#8722;Cu core has been proposed as a potential site for methane oxidation in particulate methane monooxygenase. In this work, we used density functional theory (DFT) to design a mixed&#8208;valent CuIII&#8722;O&#8722;CuII species from an experimentally known peroxo&#8208;dicopper complex supported by N&#8208;donor ligands containing phenolic groups. We found that the transfer of two&#8208;protons and two&#8208;electrons from phenolic groups to peroxo&#8208;dicopper core takes places, which results to the formation of a bis&#8208;&#956;&#8208;hydroxo&#8208;dicopper core. The bis&#8208;&#956;&#8208;hydroxo&#8208;dicopper core converts to a mixed&#8208;valent CuIII&#8722;O&#8722;CuII core with the removal of a water molecule. The orbital and spin density analyses unravel the mixed&#8208;valent nature of CuIII&#8722;O&#8722;CuII. We further investigated the reactivity of this mixed&#8208;valent core for aliphatic C&#8722;H hydroxylation. Our study unveiled that mixed&#8208;valent CuIII&#8722;O&#8722;CuII core follows a hydrogen atom transfer mechanism for C&#8722;H activation. An in&#8208;situ generated water molecule plays an important role in C&#8722;H hydroxylation by acting as a proton transfer bridge between carbon and oxygen. Furthermore, to assess the relevance of a mixed&#8208;valent CuIII&#8722;O&#8722;CuII core, we investigated aliphatic C&#8722;H activation by a symmetrical CuII&#8722;O&#8722;CuII core. DFT results show that the mixed&#8208;valent CuIII&#8722;O&#8722;CuII core is more reactive toward the C&#8722;H bond than the symmetrical CuII&#8722;O&#8722;CuII core.</dc:description>

         <title>A Two&#8208;dimensional Metal&#8722;Organic Framework as Promising Cathode for Advanced Lithium Storage</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Anthraquinone electrode materials are promising candidates for lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) due to the abundance,&#160;high theoretical capacity, and good reversibility of&#160; anthraquinone electrodes. However, the active anthraquinone materials are soluble in organic electrolytes, resulting in a sharp decay of capacity during the charge and discharge processes. Herein, we report on a two&#8208;dimensional calcium anthraquinone 2,3&#8208;dicarboxy metal&#8208;organic framework (2D CaAQDC MOF) fabricated using a simple hydrothermal method. The 2D CaAQDC MOF not only effectively inhibits the dissolution of active electrode substances into the electrolyte, but also promotes the diffusion of lithium ions into the pores of the MOF. When used as a cathode for the LIBs, the resulting CaAQDC electrode delivers a high specific capacity of ~100 mAh&#183;g&#8208;1 at a current density of 50 mA&#183;g&#8208;1 after 200 cycles, demonstrating its good cycle stability. Even at a high current density of 200 mA&#183;g&#8208;1, the CaAQDC electrode exhibits a specific capacity of ~60 mAh&#183;g&#8208;1. The fabricated 2D coordination polymers effectively restrains the dissolution of anthraquinone into the organic electrolyte and enhances the structural stability, which greatly improves the electrochemical performance of anthraquinone. These research results offer a rational molecular design strategy to address the dissolution of this and other active organic electrode materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Cu&#8208;Catalyzed Coupling of Aliphatic Amines with Alkylboronic Esters</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report a Cu&#8208;catalyzed oxidative coupling of aliphatic amines with benzylic and aliphatic boronic esters to give high value alkyl amines, products found widely in applications from medicinal chemistry to materials science. This operationally simple reaction, which can be performed on gram scale, runs under mild conditions and exhibits broad functional group tolerance. The terminal oxidant of the reaction is O2 from the air, avoiding the need for additional chemical oxidants. Investigation into the reaction mechanism suggests that the boronic ester is activated by an aminyl radical, formed through oxidation of the amine by the Cu catalyst, to give a key alkyl radical intermediate. To demonstrate its utility and potential for late&#8208;stage functionalization, we showcase the method as the final step in the total synthesis of a TRPV1 antagonist.</dc:description>

         <title>Polar covalent apex&#8208;base bonding in borapyramidanes probed by solid&#8208;state NMR and DFT calculations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy has been applied to probe the bonding properties of borapyramidane molecules. Combining the spectroscopic and quantum&#8208;chemical data, the bonding scenario is best described as covalent with a high degree of polarity. The study highlights the high sensitivity of NMR in probing bonding properties.







Abstract
Pyramidane molecules have attracted chemists for many decades due to their regular shape, high symmetry and their correspondence in the macroscopic world. Recently, experimental access to a number of examples has been reported, in particular the rarely reported square pyramidal bora[4]pyramidanes. To describe the bonding situation of the nonclassical structure of pyramidanes, we present solid&#8208;state Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) as a versatile tool for deciphering such bonding properties for three now accessible bora[4]pyramidane and dibora[5]pyramidane molecules. 11B solid&#8208;state NMR spectra indicate that the apical boron nuclei in these compounds are strongly shielded (around &#8722;50&#8197;ppm vs. BF3&#8208;Et2O complex) and possess quadrupolar coupling constants of less than 0.9&#8197;MHz pointing to a rather high local symmetry. 13C&#8722;11B spin&#8208;spin coupling constants have been explored as a measure of the bond covalency in the borapyramidanes. While the carbon&#8208;boron bond to the &#8722;B(C6F5)2 substituents of the base serves as an example for a classical covalent 2&#8208;center&#8208;2&#8208;electron (2c&#8211;2e) sp2&#8208;carbon&#8208;sp2&#8208;boron &#963;&#8208;bond with 1J(13C&#8208;11B) coupling constants in the order of 75&#8197;Hz, those of the boron(apical)&#8208;carbon(basal) bonds in the pyramid are too small to measure. These results suggest that these bonds have a strongly ionic character, which is also supported by quantum&#8208;chemical calculations.

         <title>Synthesis of 'Impossible' Rotaxanes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>'Impossible' rotaxanes, which are constituted by interlocked components without obvious binding motifs, have attracted the interest of the mechanically interlocked molecules (MIMs) community.

         <title>Synthesis of 3&#8208;Phenylserine by a Two&#8208;enzyme Cascade System with PLP Cofactor</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel cascade system was first proposed for the synthesis of 3&#8208;Phenylserine with transaminase and threonine aldolase. This cascade reaction system can not only facilitate the in&#8197;situ removal of the co&#8208;product benzaldehyde, enhancing the economic viability of the reaction, but also the PLP is utilized as the only cofactor in these reaction system.







Abstract
A two&#8208;enzyme cascade system containing &#969;&#8208;transaminase (&#969;&#8208;TA) and L&#8208;threonine aldolase (L&#8208;ThA) was reported for the synthesis of 3&#8208;Phenylserine starting from benzylamine, and PLP was utilized as the only cofactor in these both two enzymes reaction system. Based on the transamination results, benzylamine was optimized as an advantageous amino donor as confirmed by MD simulation results. This cascade reaction system could not only facilitate the in&#8197;situ removal of the co&#8208;product benzaldehyde, enhancing the economic viability of the reaction, but also establish a novel pathway for synthesizing high&#8208;value phenyl&#8208;serine derivatives. In our study, nearly 95&#8201;% of benzylamine was converted, yielding over 54&#8201;% of 3&#8208;Phenylserine under the optimized conditions cascade reaction.

         <title>&#8220;Bubble&#8208;Diode&#8221; Breathable Electrodes for Fast Gas Transport</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bubbles arising from wild gas evolution commonly exist in electrochemical systems. Herein, the concept of a &#8220;bubble&#8208;diode&#8221; breathable electrode to promote gaseous molecules to the external environment with high efficiency while avoiding bubble accumulation has been introduced from the original conception to the current state of maturation.







Abstract
Bubbles arising from wild gas evolution commonly exist in electrochemical systems, particularly in water electrolysis and rechargeable aqueous batteries (e.&#8201;g., Zn&#8208;air batteries). Substantial energy dissipation occurs due to the obstruction of active sites and ion&#8208;conducting pathways by evolving bubbles. Efforts are made to elucidate effective strategies for fast gas transport, most of which focus on minimizing bubble size and facilitating their timely detachment through complex techniques such as constructing super&#8208;hydrophilic nano&#8208;structure electrodes, flowing electrolytes, and ultrasonic oscillation. Recently, an innovative, facile, and highly efficient method utilizing a breathable electrode design to promote gaseous molecules to the external environment emerges as a promising approach since it avoids remarkable bubble accumulation while remaining free of additional accessories. This paper highlights the origin and evolution of this promising design. Starting with introducing the basic concept of traditional breathable electrodes based on hydrophobic polymer networks and discussing the current progress made in underlying mechanisms, a detailed description of the advanced design inspired by a &#8220;bubble&#8208;diode&#8221; concept with superior breathability follows. This Concept aims to contribute to a deep understanding of this technology and paves the way for further advancements in this renewable energy era.

         <title>Substrate Selectivity Imparted by Self&#8208;Assembled Molecular Containers and Catalysts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Substrate selectivity is the property of catalysts like enzymes to pick up one substrate among many others in solution. To implement substrate selectivity in artificial homogeneous catalysts, an emerging approach in homogeneous catalysis consists in exploiting self&#8208;assembled nano&#8208;catalysts and nanocontainers. The confinement effects provide supramolecular substrate recognition before the catalytic step. This review covers recent achievements in this challenging field of research.







Abstract
Recent trends in catalysis are devoted to mimicking some peculiar features of enzymes like site selectivity, through functional group recognition, and substrate selectivity, through recognition of the entire surface of the substrate. The latter is a specific feature of enzymes that is seldomly present in homogeneous catalysis. Supramolecular catalysis, thanks to the self&#8208;assembly of simple subunits, enables the creation of cavities and surfaces whose confinement effects drive the preferential binding of a substrate among others with consequent substrate selectivity. The topic is an emerging field that exploits recognition phenomena to discriminate the reagents based on their size and shape. This review deals this cutting&#8208;edge field of research covering examples of supramolecular self&#8208;assembled molecular containers and catalysts operating in organic as well as aqueous media, with special emphasis for catalytic systems dealing with direct competitive experiments involving two or more substrates.

         <title>Hierarchical Porous Aerogels With Multiple Adsorptive Interactions for Dye Wastewater Purification</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A composite aerogel composed of carboxymethyl chitosan, gelatin and tannic acid&#8208;reduced graphene oxide was successfully fabricated by the freeze&#8208;drying method, which could achieve the adsorption of multiple types of dye (such as methylene blue and methyl orange) due to the generation of hydrogen bonds, electrostatic interactions and &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacks with dyes.







Abstract
Aerogels present a huge potential for removing organic dyes from printing and dyeing wastewater (PDW). However, the preparation of aerogels with multiple dye adsorption capabilities remains a challenge, as many existing aerogels are limited to adsorbing only a single type of dye. Herein, a composite aerogel (CG/T&#8208;rGO) with the addition of carboxymethyl chitosan, gelatin and tannic acid reduced graphene oxide (T&#8208;rGO) was synthesized by freeze&#8208;drying technology. The electrostatic interactions between dye molecular and GEL/CMCS (CG) networks, as well as the supramolecular interactions (H&#8208;bonds, electrostatic interactions and &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacks) between T&#8208;rGO, have endowed the aerogel with the ability to adsorb multiple types of dye, such as methylene blue (MB) and methyl orange (MO). Results exhibited that the prepared CG/T&#8208;rGO aerogel possessed strong mechanical strength and a porous 3D network structure with a porosity of 96.33&#8201;%. Using MB and MO as adsorbates, the adsorption capacity (88.2&#8197;mg/g and 66.6&#8197;mg/g, respectively) and the mechanism of the CG/T&#8208;rGO aerogel were investigated. The adsorption processes of aerogel for MB and MO were shown to follow the pseudo&#8208;second&#8208;order kinetic model and Langmuir isotherm model, indicating the chemical adsorption of a monolayer. The proposed aerogel in this work has promising prospects for dye removal from PDW.

         <title>Temperature&#8208;dependent Electrochemical Performance of Ta&#8208;substituted SrCoO3 perovskite for Supercapacitors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing new electrode materials with good temperature&#8208;dependent electrochemical performance has become a great issue for the deployment of hybrid supercapacitors with wide temperature tolerance.&#160;&#160;In this work, a series of Ta&#8208;substituted SrCo1&#8208;xTaxO3&#8208;&#948; (x = 0.05, 0.10, 0.15, 0.20) perovskites have been studied as positive electrodes for hybrid supercapacitors in&#160;terms of their structures, elemental valence states and electrochemical performances. Incorporating Ta into SrCoO3&#8208;&#948; perovskite not only stabilizes the crystallite structure but also notably improves electrochemical activities. The SrCo0.95Ta0.05O3&#8208;&#948;@CC delivers the highest specific capacity (Qsp) of 227.91 C g&#8208;1 at 1 A g&#8208;1, which is attributed to the highest oxygen vacancy content and the fastest oxygen diffusion kinetics. The hybrid supercapacitor SrCo0.95Ta0.05O3&#8208;&#948;@CC//AC@CC exhibits a high energy density of 22.82 Wh kg&#8208;1@775.09 W kg&#8208;1 and a stable long&#8208;term cycle life (5000 cycles) with 90.7% capacity retention. As temperature increases from 25 to 85 &#8451;, the capacitance properties are improved at elevated temperatures for both electrode and device due to the increased electrolyte conductivity. The outstanding electrochemical results present that SrCo1&#8208;xTaxO3&#8208;&#948; perovskite holds good prospects for hybrid supercapacitors with wide temperature tolerance.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Fluorine, the tiny robust atom, with its unique features has captured the attention of scientists in recent times, especially in drug discovery with its integration in small molecules, peptides, and proteins. However, studies to understand the &#8216;fluorine effects&#8217; (&#8216;fluorine magic&#8217;) on the conformation of molecules that follow &#8216;beyond the rule of 5&#8217; are in the infancy yet significant in molecular design and function. For the first time, using short hybrid peptide sequence as an appropriate model, we examined the substitution effect (size, stereoelectronic effect, and hydrogen bonding) using X&#8208;ray diffraction 2D&#8208;NMR, and CD studies. The comparative study on their folding patterns with hydrogen&#8208;substituted analogs can provide valuable insights into &#8216;flustrates&#8217; fluorinated substrates&#8217; design.</dc:description>

         <title>Polyoxometalate&#8208;dependent photocatalytic activity of radical&#8208;doped perylenediimide&#8208;based hybrid materials</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Four radical&#8208;doped PDI&#8208;based crystalline hybrid materials, Cl4&#8208;PDI&#183;SiW12O40 (1), Cl4&#8208;PDI&#183;SiMo12O40 (2), Cl4&#8208;PDI&#183;PW12O40 (3), and Cl4&#8208;PDI&#183;PMo12O40 (4), were attainedby slow diffusion of polyoxometalates (POMs) into acidified Cl4&#8208;PDI solutions. The obtained PDI&#8208;based crystalline hybrid materials not only exhibited prominent photochromism, but also possessed reactive organic radicals under ambient conditions. Furthermore, all hybrid materials could be easily photoreduced to their radical anions (Cl4&#8208;PDI&#8226;&#8210;), and then underwent a second photoexcitation to form energetic excited state radical anions (Cl4&#8208;PDI&#8226;&#8210;*). However, experiments and theoretical calculations demonstrated that the formed energetic Cl4&#8208;PDI&#8226;&#8210;* showed unusual POM&#8208;dependent photocatalytic efficiencies toward the oxidative coupling of amines and the iodoperfluoroalkylation of alkenes; higher photocatalytic efficiencies were found for hybrid materials 1 and 2 compared to 3 and 4. The photocatalytic efficiencies of these hybrid materials are mainly controlled by the energy differences between the SOMO&#8208;2 level of Cl4&#8208;PDI&#8226;&#8210;* and the LUMO level of the POMs.</dc:description>

         <title>Elevating Lithium&#8208;Sulfur Battery Durability through Samarium Oxide/Ketjen Black Modified Separator</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries have garnered significant attention as a promising next&#8208;generation battery technology due to their potential for high energy density. However, their practical application is hampered by slow reaction kinetics and the shuttle effect of lithium polysulfide intermediates. In this context, the authors introduce a pioneering solution in the form of a novel porous carbon nanostructure modified with samarium oxide, denoted as Sm2O3/KB. The material has a highly polar surface, allowing lithium polysulfide to be chemisorbed efficiently. The unsaturated sites provided by the oxygen vacancies of Sm2O3 promote Li2S nucleation, lowering the reaction energy barrier and accelerating Li2S dissolution. The porous structure of Ketjen Black provides a highly conductive channel for electron transport and effectively traps polysulfides. Meanwhile, the batteries with Sm2O3/KB/PP spacers exhibited remarkable electrochemical performances, including a low&#8208;capacity decay rate of only 0.046% for 1000 cycles at 2 C and an excellent multiplicative performance of 624 mAh g&#8208;1 at 3 C. This work opens up a new avenue for the potential use of rare earth&#8208;based materials in lithium&#8208; sulfur batteries.</dc:description>

Abstract
The fluorobasic character of the strong oxidative fluorinator, XeF6, and the oxidative resistance of the [XeF5]+ and [Xe2F11]+ cations have been exploited for the syntheses of several novel Cr(VI) dianion salts. The reactions of XeF6 and CrO2F2 in anhydrous HF and by direct fusion of the reactants in melts have yielded the first dinuclear Cr(VI) oxyfluoro&#8208;dianion salts, [XeF5]2[Cr2O4F6], [XeF5]2[Cr2O4F6]&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;4HF, [XeF5]2[Cr2O4F6]&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2XeOF4, and mononuclear Cr(VI) oxyfluoro&#8208;dianion salt, [XeF5][Xe2F11][CrO2F4]. The salts were structurally characterized by low&#8208;temperature (LT) single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (SCXRD) and LT Raman spectroscopy. The [CrO2F4]2&#8722; and [Cr2O4F6]2&#8722; dianions have distorted octahedral cis&#8208;dioxo Cr(VI) coordination spheres in which two F&#8208;atoms are trans to one another and two F&#8208;atoms are trans to O&#8208;atoms, where the [Cr2O4F6]2&#8722; dianion is the fluorine&#8208;bridged dimer of the [CrO2F3]&#8722; anion. Quantum&#8208;chemical calculations were used to obtain the energy&#8208;minimized, gas&#8208;phase geometries, and the calculated vibrational spectra of the gas&#8208;phase dianions and their ion&#8208;pairs, which were used to aid in the vibrational frequency assignments of the crystalline salts. NBO and MEPS analyses and SCXRD show these salts are comprised of intimate ion&#8208;pairs in which their cations and anions interact through primarily electrostatic Xe&#8208;&#8201;&#8208;&#8201;&#8208;F &#963;&#8208;hole bonds.

The reactions of XeF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; and CrO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in anhydrous HF and by direct fusion of the reactants in melts have yielded the first dinuclear Cr(VI) oxyfluoro-dianion salts, [XeF&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;[Cr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;], [XeF&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;[Cr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;4HF, [XeF&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;[Cr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2XeOF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, and mononuclear Cr(VI) oxyfluoro-dianion salt, [XeF&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;][Xe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt;][CrO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]. The salts were structurally characterized by low-temperature (LT) single-crystal X-ray diffraction (SCXRD) and LT Raman spectroscopy. The [CrO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; and [Cr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; dianions have distorted octahedral &lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt;-dioxo Cr(VI) coordination spheres in which two F-atoms are trans to one another and two F-atoms are trans to O-atoms, where the [Cr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; dianion is the fluorine-bridged dimer of the [CrO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; anion. Quantum-chemical calculations were used to obtain the energy-minimized, gas-phase geometries, and the calculated vibrational spectra of the gas-phase dianions and their ion-pairs, which were used to aid in the vibrational frequency assignments of the crystalline salts. NBO and MEPS analyses and SCXRD show these salts are comprised of intimate ion-pairs in which their cations and anions interact through primarily electrostatic Xe-&#8201;-&#8201;-F &#963;-hole bonds.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Separator Design Strategies to Advance Rechargeable Aqueous Zinc Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The quality of separators is thoroughly assessed by systematically analyzing and scrutinizing aspects such as cost, functionality, safety, and environmental sustainability in their preparation. This comprehensive evaluation serves as a guide for the objectives and future directions for separators research of zinc ion batteries.







Abstract
With the increasing demand for low&#8208;cost and high&#8208;safety portable batteries, aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs) have been regarded as a potential alternative to the lithium&#8208;ion batteries, bringing about extensive research dedicated in the exploration of high&#8208;performance and highly reversible ZIBs. Although separators are generally considered as non&#8208;active components in conventional research on ZIBs, advanced separators designs seem to offer effective solutions to the majority of issues within ZIBs system. These issues encompass concerns related to the zinc anode, cathode, and electrolyte. Initially, we delve into the origins and implications of various inherent problems within the ZIBs system. Subsequently, we present the latest research advancements in addressing these challenges through separators engineering. This includes a comprehensive, detailed exploration of various strategies, coupled with instances of advanced characterizations to provide a more profound insight into the mechanisms that influence the separators. Finally, we undertake a multi&#8208;criteria evaluation, based on application standards for diverse substrate separators, while proposing guiding principles for the optimal design of separators in zinc batteries. This review aims to furnish valuable guidance for the future development of advanced separators, thereby nurturing progress in the field of ZIBs.

         <title>Electrochemical Redox Conversion of Formate to CO via Coupling Fe&#8208;Co Layered Double Hydroxides and Au Catalysts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Formate has been considered an inactive molecule and thus cannot be further reduced under CO2 reduction conditions, which limits its widespread application as feedstock. Here we present an electrochemical redox conversion of formate to CO through the potential&#8208;dependent generation of carbon dioxide radical anions (CO2&#8226;&#8208;) on Fe&#8208;Co layered double hydroxides (Fe&#8208;Co LDHs) and the subsequent reduction of CO2&#8226;&#8208; to CO on Au catalysts. We present an electrodeposition protocol for the synthesis of Fe&#8208;Co LDHs with precise composition control and find that Fe1Co4 exhibits a promising potential window for CO2&#8208;&#8226; formation between 1.14 and 1.4 V and an optimized potential at 1.24 V at a neutral pH condition. We further determined the formation of CO2&#8226;&#8208; at 1.24 V via electron paramagnetic resonance and CO2 at &gt; 1.4 V through differential electrochemical mass spectrometry. This work provides a redox chemistry route for converting formate into CO through a coupled slit parallel&#8208;plate electrode system.</dc:description>

         <title>Solution and Solvent&#8208;Free Stopper Exchange Reactions for the Preparation of Pillar[5]arene&#8208;containing [2] and [3]Rotaxanes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Diamine reagents have been used to functionalize a [2]rotaxane building block bearing an activated pentafluorophenyl ester stopper. Upon a first acylation, an intermediate host&#8208;guest complex with a terminal amine function is obtained. Dissociation of the intermediate occurs in solution and acylation of the released axle generates a [2]rotaxane with an elongated axle subunit. In contrast, the corresponding [3]rotaxane can be obtained if the reaction conditions are appropriate to stabilize the inclusion complex of the mono&#8208;amine intermediate and the pillar[5]arene. This is the case when the stopper exchange is performed under mechanochemical solvent&#8208;free conditions. Alternatively, if the newly introduced terminal amide group is large enough to prevent the dissociation, the second acylation provides exclusively a [3]rotaxane. On the other hand, detailed conformational analysis has been also carried out by variable temperature NMR investigations. A complete understanding of the shuttling motions of the pillar[5]arene subunit along the axles of the rotaxanes reported therein has been achieved with the help of density functional theory calculations.</dc:description>

         <title>Investigation of the Chemisorption&#8208;Catalysis Behavior of Sulfur Species on the Electrocatalysts Designed by Co&#8208;regulation Strategy of Anions and Cations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Li&#8208;S batteries possess high energy density and have been one of the most promising energy storage systems. For sulfur cathodes, the electrochemical performance is still seriously hindered by the polysulfide shuttling and sluggish conversion kinetics. It has been demonstrated to be one effective strategy to address the above issues via designing electrocatalysts with robust affinity and catalytic capacity towards polysulfides. However, it is still a great challenge to rapidly and economically discover high&#8208;performance electrocatalysts. Herein, using density functional theory calculation, we studied the chemisorption&#8208;catalysis behavior of sulfur species on a series of electrocatalysts (MCo2X4, M = Co, Zn, Cu, Ni, Fe, and Mn, X = O, S, and Se) to assess the effect of the anions and cations co&#8208;regulation on their electronic structure, chemisorption behavior, and catalytic property. FeCo2Se4 and CuCo2Se4 combined appropriate chemisorption with superior electronic conductivity and sulfur reduction catalytic capacity have been predicted as novel electrocatalysts for high&#8208;performance Li&#8208;S batteries. This study gives theoretical guidance for repaid discovery of high&#8208;efficient electrocatalyst to boost the electrochemical performance of sulfur cathodes.</dc:description>

         <title>Direct Band Gap Semiconductors with Two&#8208; and Three&#8208;Dimensional Triel&#8208;Phosphide Frameworks (Triel = Al, Ga, In)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Recently, several ternary phosphidotrielates and &#8208;tetrelates have been investigated with respect to their very good ionic conductivity, while less focus was pointed towards their electronic structures. Here, we report on a novel series of compounds, in which several members possess direct band gaps. We investigated the known compounds Li3AlP2, Li3GaP2, Li3InP2, and Na3InP2 and describe the synthesis and the crystal structure of novel Na3In2P3. For all mentioned phosphidotrielates reflectance UV&#8208;Vis measurements reveal direct band gaps in the visible light region with decreasing band gaps in the series: Li3AlP2 (2.45 eV), Li3GaP2 (2.18&#160;eV), Li3InP2 (1.99 eV), Na3InP2 (1.37&#160;eV), and Na3In2P3 (1.27&#160;eV). All direct band gaps are confirmed by quantum chemical calculations. The unexpected property occurs despite different structure types. As a common feature all compounds contain EP4 tetrahedra, which share exclusively vertices for E = In and vertices as well as edges for E = Al and Ga. The structure of the novel Na3In2P3 is built up by a polyanionic framework of six&#8208;membered rings of corner&#8208;sharing InP4 tetrahedra. As a result, the newly designed semiconductors with direct band gaps are suitable for optoelectronic applications, and they can provide significant guidance for the design of new functional semiconductors.</dc:description>

         <title>Photoelectrocatalytic Utilization of CO2: A Big Show of Si&#8208;based Photoelectrodes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>CO2 is a greenhouse gas that contributes to environmental deterioration; however, it can also be utilized as an abundant C1 resource for the production of valuable chemicals. Solar&#8208;driven photoelectrocatalytic (PEC) CO2 utilization represents an advanced technology for the resourcing of CO2. The key to achieving PEC CO2 utilization lies in high&#8208;performance semiconductor photoelectrodes. Si&#8208;based photoelectrodes have attracted increasing attention in the field of PEC CO2 utilization due to their suitable band gap (1.1 eV), high carrier mobility, low cost, and abundance on Earth. There are two pathways to PEC CO2 utilization using Si&#8208;based photoelectrodes: direct reduction of CO2 into small molecule fuels and chemicals, and fixation of CO2 with organic substrates to generate high&#8208;value chemicals. The efficiency and product selectivity of PEC CO2 utilization depends on the structures of the photoelectrodes as well as the composition, morphology, and size of the catalysts. In recent years, significant and influential progress has been made in utilizing Si&#8208;based photoelectrodes for PEC CO2 utilization. This review summarizes the latest research achievements in Si&#8208;based PEC CO2 utilization, with a particular emphasis on the mechanistic understanding of CO2 reduction and fixation, which will inspire future developments in this field.</dc:description>

         <title>Revisiting Peri&#8208;Aryloxyquinones: From a Forgotten Photochromic System to a Promising Tool for Emerging Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Peri&#8208;AryloxyQuinones (PAQs) undergo a reversible light&#8208;induced arylotropy between para&#8208; and ana&#8208;quinone states. The structure&#8208;switch relationships, mechanism of molecular photochromism as well as potential applications and prospects of PAQs in optically switchable materials and devices are discussed.







Abstract
Emerging applications of photochromic compounds demand new molecular designs that can be inspired by some long&#8208;known yet currently forgotten classes of photoswitches. In the present review, we remind the community about Peri&#8208;AryloxyQuinones (PAQs) and their unique photoswitching behavior originally discovered more than 50&#8197;years ago. At the heart of this phenomenon is the light&#8208;induced migration of an aromatic moiety (arylotropy) in peri&#8208;aryloxy&#8208;substituted quinones resulting in ana&#8208;quinones. PAQs feature absorbance of both isomers in the visible spectral region, photochromism in the amorphous and crystalline state, and thermal stability of the photogenerated ana&#8208;isomer. Particularly noticeable is the high sensitivity of the ana&#8208;isomer towards nucleophiles in solution. In addition to the mechanism of molecular photochromism and the underlaying structure&#8208;switch relationships, we analyze potential applications and prospects of aryloxyquinones in optically switchable materials and devices. Due to their ability to efficiently photoswitch in the solid state, PAQs are indeed attractive candidates for such materials and devices, including electronics (optically controllable circuits, switches, transistors, memories, and displays), porous crystalline materials, crystalline actuators, photoactivated sensors, and many more. This review is intended to serve as a guide for researchers who wish to use photoswitchable PAQs in the development of new photocontrollable materials, devices, and processes.

         <title>Borirenes and Boriranes: Development and Perspectives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Borirenes and boriranes, both featuring a BC2 three&#8208;membered ring, represent a class of compounds that combine substantial ring strain with Lewis acidity. Further fusion with benzene and o&#8208;carborane through a shared CC bond leads to benzoborienes and carborane&#8208;fused boriranes, which exhibit even higher ring strain. This minireview summarizes their synthesis and reactivity and offers perspectives.







Abstract
Strained compounds constitute a highly topical area of research in chemistry. Borirene and borirane both feature a BC2 three&#8208;membered ring. They can be viewed as the structural analogues of cyclopropane and cyclopropene, where a CH2 unit of the carbonaceous counterparts is replaced with BH, respectively. Indeed, this structural variation introduces numerous intriguing aspects. For instance, borirane and borirene are both Lewis acidic due to the presence of a tricoordinate borane center. In addition, borirene is 2&#960; aromatic according to H&#252;ckel's rule. In addition to their ability to form adducts with Lewis bases and the capacity of borirenes to act as ligands in coordination with metals, both borirenes and boriranes exhibit ring&#8208;opening reactivity due to the considerable ring strain. Under specific conditions, coordinated boriranes can even cleave two BC bonds to serve as formal borylene sources (although the reaction mechanisms are quite complex). On the other hand, recent successful syntheses of benzoborienes and their carborane&#8208;based three&#8208;dimensional analogues (also referred to as carborane&#8208;fused boriranes) have introduced novel perspectives to this field. For instance, they display excellent ring&#8208;expanding reactivity, possibly attributed to the boosted ring strain arising from the fusion of borirenes with benzene and boriranes with o&#8208;carborane. Importantly, their applications as valuable &#8220;BC2&#8221; synthons have become increasingly evident along with the newly disclosed reactivity. Additionally, the boosted Lewis acidity of carborane&#8208;fused boriranes, thanks to the potent electron&#8208;withdrawing effect of o&#8208;carborane, combined with their readiness for ring enlargement, makes them promising candidates as electron&#8208;accepting building blocks in the construction of chemically responsive luminescent materials. This review provides a summary of the synthesis and reactivity of borirene and borirane derivatives, with the aim of encouraging the design of new borierene&#8208; and borirane&#8208;based molecules and inspiring further exploration of their potential applications.

         <title>Structural Impact of N&#8208;terminal Pyroglutamylate in an Amyloid&#8208;&#946;(3&#8208;42) Fibril Probed by Solid&#8208;State NMR Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Solid state NMR spectroscopy on fibrils of recombinant, pyroglutamylated [U&#8208;13C,15N]&#8208; pEA&#946;(3&#8208;42) show highly similar &#946;&#8208;strand positions and a conserved turn region around V24 comparable to LS&#8208;shaped A&#946;(1&#8208;42) fibrils. Due to missing D1&#8208;A2 and pE3 formation a salt bridge of K28&#8208;D1' is absent in pEA&#946;(3&#8208;42) fibrils. G37&#8208;G38 act as sensors for the N&#8208;terminal modifications in pEA&#946;(3&#8208;42) fibrils.







Abstract
Extracellular amyloid&#8208;&#946; (A&#946;) plaques, primarily formed by A&#946;(1&#8208;40) and A&#946;(1&#8208;42) fibrils, are a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease. The A&#946; peptide can undergo a high variety of different post&#8208;translational modifications including formation of a pyroglutamate (pGlu, pE) at N&#8208;terminal Glu3 or Glu11 of truncated A&#946;(3&#8208;x) or A&#946;(11&#8208;x), respectively. Here we studied structural similarities and differences between pEA&#946;(3&#8208;42) and LS&#8208;shaped A&#946;(1&#8208;42) fibrils grown under identical conditions (pH&#8197;2) using solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy. We show that the central region of pEA&#946;(3&#8208;42) fibrils including the turn region around V24 is almost identical to A&#946;(1&#8208;42) showing similar &#946;&#8208;strands also at the N&#8208;terminus. The missing N&#8208;terminal residues D1&#8208;A2 along with pE3 formation in pEA&#946;(3&#8208;42) preclude a salt bridge between K28&#8208;D1' as in A&#946;(1&#8208;42) fibrils. G37 and G38 act as highly sensitive internal sensors for the modified N&#8208;terminus, which remains rigid over ~five pH units.

         <title>The Fluoride Method: Access to Silver(III) NHC Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We have synthesized the first silver(III) carbene complexes, (CF3)3Ag(NHC), by direct reaction of the silver(III) fluoride precursor complex [PPh4][(CF3)3AgF] with different imidazolium salts. This novel methodology circumvents the use of free NHC molecules. The silver(III) carbene complexes thus prepared are unprecedented and show remarkable thermal stabilities. They display square&#8208;planar or square&#8208;pyramidal geometry. Following our calculations, the electronic structure of a model representative complex exhibits Inverse Ligand Field (ILF).

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;We have synthesized the first silver(III) carbene complexes, (CF3)3Ag(NHC), by direct reaction of the silver(III) fluoride precursor complex [PPh4][(CF3)3AgF] with different imidazolium salts. This novel methodology circumvents the use of free NHC molecules. The silver(III) carbene complexes thus prepared are unprecedented and show remarkable thermal stabilities. They display square-planar or square-pyramidal geometry. Following our calculations, the electronic structure of a model representative complex exhibits Inverse Ligand Field (ILF). The compounds reported herein are synthetic analogues of the elusive difluorocarbene and carbonyl species proposed as intermediates in the acidic decomposition of [Ag(CF3)4]&#8722;. The synthetic procedure reported is envisaged to enable access to carbene complexes of other late transition-metals in high oxidation states.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Binding of Acetylated Lysine by Using a Water Soluble Aryl Extended Calix[4]pyrrole</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Post&#8208;translational modifications of lysine in histones, as methylation and acetylation, have well established functions in epigenetics and are emerging as important actors in broader biological regulation. Currently, the detection of acetylated lysine (Kac) in water solution as free amino acid or protein residue remains challenging. Acetylated lysine is a neutral amino acid, and the lack of ion&#8211;dipole interactions causes the decrease in binding affinity displayed by synthetic molecular receptors with respect to the other lysine modifications. Here, we report molecular modeling calculations and 1H NMR experiments to investigate the binding properties of two different calix[4]pyrrole receptors towards Kac. Computational analyses reveal that tetra&#8208;aryl&#8208;extended calix[4]pyrrole (1) preferentially binds the cis&#8208;Kac conformer over the trans one due to steric considerations and more favorable interactions. Experimental 1H NMR titration experiments confirm the formation of a 1:1 complex between receptor 1 and cis&#8208;Kac, with a Ka exceeding 103 M&#8208;1. Conversely, the super&#8208;aryl&#8208;extended calix[4]pyrrole 2 is less efficient in binding Kac, due to unfavorable solvation/desolvation effects, as proven by 1H NMR experiments. Moreover, receptor 1 showed a higher affinity for Kac over other lysine modifications, such as methylated lysines.</dc:description>

         <title>Pyrrole &#946;C&#8208;B&#8208;N Fused Porphyrins: Molecular Structures and Opto&#8208;Electrochemical Studies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we report the design, synthesis, structure, and electrochemical study of doubly &#946;C&#8208;B&#8208;N fused Ni(II) porphyrins (1&#8208;trans, 1&#8208;cis, 2&#8208;trans, and 2&#8208;cis). These compounds were synthesized from A2B2 type dipyridyl Ni(II) porphyrins (Ar = Ph for 1a; Ar = C6F5 for 2a) via Lewis base&#8208;directed electrophilic aromatic borylation reactions. The solution state structures of these compounds were established using 1H NMR, 11B NMR, 1H&#8208;1H COSY, 1H&#8208;13C HSQC, and 19F&#8208;13C HSQC NMR techniques. Single crystal X&#8208;ray analysis revealed that 1&#8208;trans, 1&#8208;cis, and 2&#8208;trans adopt ruffled conformations, with alternate meso&#8208;carbons on the opposite sides of the mean porphyrin plane. The Soret bands in the absorption spectra of the B&#8208;N fused molecules are ~40 nm redshifted compared to unfused Ni(II) porphyrin precursors. The B&#8208;N fusion diminishes the redox potential of fused porphyrins. Although 1&#8208;trans and 1&#8208;cis, show four oxidation processes, 2&#8208;trans and 2&#8208;cis showed only three oxidation processes. DFT studies revealed that the tetrahedral geometry of the boron induces a twist in the &#960;&#8208;conjugation, which destabilizes the HOMO and stabilizes the LUMO in 1&#8208;trans, 1&#8208;cis, 2&#8208;trans, and 2&#8208;cis.</dc:description>

         <title>Conformations and Rearrangements of Collinolactone &#8211; Experiments and Theory on a Dynamic Cyclodecatriene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a series of new isomers of collinolactone A which were obtained from thermal, and acid promoted rearrangements of the natural product. We are able to rationalize these findings through detailed quantum chemical computations of the involved conformers and their reactions.







Abstract
Collinolactone A is a microbial specialized metabolite with a unique 6&#8208;10&#8208;7 tricyclic bislactone skeleton which was isolated from Streptomyces bacteria. The unusual cyclodecatriene motif features dynamic interconversions of two rotamers. Given the biological profiling of collinolactone A as neuroprotective agent, semisynthetic modifications represent an invaluable strategy to enhance its efficacy. Since understanding conformations and reactions of bioactive substances is crucial for rational structure&#8208;based design and synthesis of derivatives, we conducted computational studies on conformational behavior as well as experiments on thermal and acid induced rearrangements of the cyclodecatriene. Experimental conformer ratios of collinolactone A and its biosynthetic ketolactone precursor are well reproduced by computations at the PW6B95&#8208;D3/def2&#8208;QZVPP//r2SCAN&#8208;3c level. Upon heating collinolactone A in anhydrous dioxane at 100&#8201;&#176;C, three collinolactone B stereoisomers exhibiting enollactone structures form via Cope rearrangements. Our computations predict the energetic preference for a boat&#8208;like transition state in agreement with the stereochemical outcome of the main reaction pathway. Constriction of the ten&#8208;membered ring forms collinolactone C with four annulated rings and an exocyclic double bond. Computations and semisynthetic experiments demonstrate strong preference for an acid&#8208;catalyzed reaction pathway over an alternative Alder&#8208;ene route to collinolactone C with a prohibitive reaction barrier, again in line with stereochemical observations.

         <dc:description>
The covalent anchoring of electron acceptors derived of [6,6]&#8208;phenyl&#8208;fullerene&#8208;methyl butyrate (PC61BM and PC71BM) to carbon dots (CD) was carried out successfully and the obtained hybrid nanomaterials characterized by means of AFM microscopy, and FTIR and XPS spectroscopies. Electrochemical and photophysical studies confirmed the electronic communication between the covalently connected units and their promise for further photo&#8208; and electronic applications.







Abstract
The covalent incorporation of C60 and C70 derivatives of the well&#8208;known n&#8208;type organic semiconductor PCBM ([6,6]&#8208;phenyl&#8208;C61&#8208;butyric acid methyl ester) onto carbon dots (CD) is described. Morphological and structural characterization reveal combined features of both pristine starting materials (CD and PCBM). Electrochemical investigations evidenced the existence of additional reduction processes to that of CD or PCBM precursors, showing rich electron&#8208;acceptor capabilities, with multistep processes in an affordable and narrow electrochemical window (ca. 1.5&#8197;V). Electronic communication in the obtained nanoconjugated species were derived from steady&#8208;state absorption and emission spectroscopies, which showed bathochromically shifted absorptions and emissions well entering the red region. Finally, the lower fluorescence quantum yield of CD&#8208;PCBM nanoconjugates, compared with CD, and the fast decay of the observed emission of CD, support the existence of an electronic communication between both CD and PCBM units in the excited state.

         <title>Bottom&#8208;Up Construction of Ni(II)&#8208;Incorporated Covalent Organic Framework for Metallaphotoredox Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a facile bottom&#8208;up strategy to synthesize Ni(II)&#8208;incorporated covalent organic framework (LZU&#8208;713@Ni) as heterogeneous all&#8208;in&#8208;one metallaphotoredox catalyst. LZU&#8208;713@Ni showed excellent activity and recyclability in photoredox/nickel&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;O, C&#8722;S, and C&#8722;P cross&#8208;coupling reactions. The superiority of bottom&#8208;up strategy was exemplified by the increased activity of LZU&#8208;713@Ni compared to both the dual catalyst system and LZU&#8208;713/Ni prepared via post&#8208;synthetic modification.







Abstract
The construction of an all&#8208;in&#8208;one catalyst, in which the photosensitizer and the transition metal site are close to each other, is important for improving the efficiency of metallaphotoredox catalysis. However, the development of convenient synthetic strategies for the precise construction of an all&#8208;in&#8208;one catalyst remains a challenging task due to the requirement of precise installation of the catalytic sites. Herein, we have successfully established a facile bottom&#8208;up strategy for the direct synthesis of Ni(II)&#8208;incorporated covalent organic framework (COF), named LZU&#8208;713@Ni, as a versatile all&#8208;in&#8208;one metallaphotoredox catalyst. LZU&#8208;713@Ni showed excellent activity and recyclability in the photoredox/nickel&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;O, C&#8722;S, and C&#8722;P cross&#8208;coupling reactions. Notably, this catalyst displayed a better catalytic activity than its homogeneous analogues, physically mixed dual catalyst system, and, especially, LZU&#8208;713/Ni which was prepared through post&#8208;synthetic modification. The improved catalytic efficiency of LZU&#8208;713@Ni should be attributed to the implementation of bottom&#8208;up strategy, which incorporated the fixed, ordered, and abundant catalytic sites into its framework.

     alt="Bottom-Up Construction of Ni(II)-Incorporated Covalent Organic Framework for Metallaphotoredox Catalysis"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We developed a facile bottom-up strategy to synthesize Ni(II)-incorporated covalent organic framework (LZU-713@Ni) as heterogeneous all-in-one metallaphotoredox catalyst. LZU-713@Ni showed excellent activity and recyclability in photoredox/nickel-catalyzed C&#8722;O, C&#8722;S, and C&#8722;P cross-coupling reactions. The superiority of bottom-up strategy was exemplified by the increased activity of LZU-713@Ni compared to both the dual catalyst system and LZU-713/Ni prepared via post-synthetic modification.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The construction of an all-in-one catalyst, in which the photosensitizer and the transition metal site are close to each other, is important for improving the efficiency of metallaphotoredox catalysis. However, the development of convenient synthetic strategies for the precise construction of an all-in-one catalyst remains a challenging task due to the requirement of precise installation of the catalytic sites. Herein, we have successfully established a facile bottom-up strategy for the direct synthesis of Ni(II)-incorporated covalent organic framework (COF), named LZU-713@Ni, as a versatile all-in-one metallaphotoredox catalyst. LZU-713@Ni showed excellent activity and recyclability in the photoredox/nickel-catalyzed C&#8722;O, C&#8722;S, and C&#8722;P cross-coupling reactions. Notably, this catalyst displayed a better catalytic activity than its homogeneous analogues, physically mixed dual catalyst system, and, especially, LZU-713/Ni which was prepared through post-synthetic modification. The improved catalytic efficiency of LZU-713@Ni should be attributed to the implementation of bottom-up strategy, which incorporated the fixed, ordered, and abundant catalytic sites into its framework. This work sheds new light on the exploration of concise and effective strategies for the construction of multifunctional COF-based photocatalysts.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Responsive Polyoxometalate@Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks Involving Ir Metalloligands for Highly Selective Photocatalytic Oxidation of Sulfides to Sulfoxide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have synthesized a crystalline POM@MOF (Ir&#8722;SiW) by assembling Ir metalloligands and POMs for the first time. Ir&#8722;SiW has high activity for selective oxidation sulfide to sulfoxide, with a yield of 99.5&#8201;% within 2.5&#8197;h, which is higher than the currently known POM&#8208;based photocatalysts.







Abstract
The synthesis of highly efficient visible&#8208;light&#8208;responsive photocatalysts is fundamental to solving the problems of low efficiency and poor selectivity in photocatalytic organic synthesis reactions. We synthesized a crystalline polyoxometalate @metal&#8208;organic framework material {Zn4(H2O)8[Ir(ppy)2(dcbpy)]4[SiW12O40]}&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;4H2O (Ir&#8722;SiW) by self&#8208;assembly of Ir metalloligands with POMs. The introduction of Ir metalloligands extends the light absorbing range to visible light, improving the efficient utilization of solar energy. The transfer of photogenerated electrons from Ir metalloligands to SiW12 was observed under visible light irradiation, which boosted the carrier separation efficiency. The synergistic effect of the two components increased the photocatalytic thioether oxidation activity, and the product methyl phenyl sulfoxide for 2.5&#8197;h under visible light irradiation (&#955; &gt;400&#8197;nm) reached 99.5&#8201;%, which was higher than those of other POM&#8208;based photocatalysts. Meanwhile, the yield of methyl phenyl sulfoxide was still higher than 97&#8201;% after three cycles, demonstrating the high stability and reusability of Ir&#8722;SiW.

         <title>Unveiling the Anomaly of Reduction of Carborane&#8208;bis&#8208;silylene&#8208;Stabilised Silylone/Germylone Leading to Unusual Oxidation of Si0/Ge0 to SiI/GeI with EDA&#8208;NOCV Analyses</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The most favourable bonding scenario in carborane&#8208;bis&#8208;silylene stabilized silylone and germylone has been uncovered by density functional calculations and EDA&#8208;NOCV analyses. The interactions between the negatively charged carborane and positively charged bis&#8208;silylene fragments in their doublet states are likely to form one covalent electron&#8208;sharing bond and one covalent dative bond. These findings provide a detailed understanding of the bonding interactions within these species, helping us to infer why the carborane fragment undergoes intramolecular electronic rearrangements, and shed light on the fragments&#8217; stability, distribution of electron densities and often unusual reactivity.







Abstract
Researchers have successfully isolated Si0/Ge0 species, termed silylone and germylone, with two lone pairs of electrons on them. These elusive compounds have been stabilised in singlet ground states by using different donor base ligands. Driess et&#8197;al. in particular have made strides in this area, isolating carborane&#8208;bis&#8208;silylene&#8208;stabilised silylone/germylone and their N+/Pb analogues. Carborane (C2B10H10) plays a pivotal role as a redox&#8208;active ligand, converting from closo&#8208;carborane to nido&#8208;carborane with the addition of two electrons. Notably, anomalous oxidation of Si0/Ge0 centres in carborane&#8208;bis&#8208;silylene&#8208;stabilised species to SiI/GeI has been reported, resulting in the formation of dimeric SiI&#8722;SiI/GeI&#8722;GeI di&#8208;cationic units. The energy decomposition analysis coupled with natural orbital for chemical valence (EDA&#8208;NOCV) study focuses on the carborane&#8208;bis&#8208;silylene ligand in the free state, and its three other species, including silylone/germylone species. Interestingly, it reveals that the carborane unit in an anionic doublet state tends to form one electron&#8208;sharing bond and one dative bond with the counter fragment in its cationic doublet state. This helps us to rationalise why the carborane unit undergoes intramolecular electronic rearrangements leading to the formation of a di&#8208;anionic carborane unit with a significantly elongated C&#8722;C bond (2.38&#8211;2.68&#8197;&#197;) and undergoes unusual oxidation of Si0/Ge0 to SiI/GeI.

         <title>Pertechnetate/perrhenate&#8208;capped Zr/Hf&#8208;Dihydroxide Dimers: Elucidating Zr&#8722;TcO4 Co&#8208;Mobility in the Nuclear Fuel Cycle</title>

         <dc:description>
The well&#8208;known Zr/Hf4&#8208;tetramer is cleaved in aqueous solutions by perrhenate/pertechnetate to yield a dihydroxide dimer capped by these oxoanions. Structure and solution characterization of this complex along with solvent extraction studies elucidates 93Zr&#8208;99Tc co&#8208;extraction (two of the most abundant and problematic 235U fission products) during nuclear fuel reprocessing.







Abstract
Spent nuclear fuel contains heavy element fission products that must be separated for effective reprocessing for a safe and sustainable nuclear fuel cycle. 93Zr and 99Tc are high&#8208;yield fission products that co&#8208;transport in liquid&#8208;liquid extraction processes. Here we seek atomic&#8208;level information of this co&#8208;extraction process, as well as fundamental knowledge about ZrIV (and HfIV) aqueous speciation in the presence of topology&#8208;directing ligands such as pertechnetate (TcO4&#8722;) and non&#8208;radioactive surrogate perrhenate (ReO4&#8722;). In this context, we show that the flat tetrameric oxyhydroxyl&#8208;cluster [MIV4(OH)8(H2O)16]8+ (and related polymers) is dissociated by perrhenate/pertechnetate to yield isostructural dimers, M2(OH)2(XO4&#8722;)6(H2O)6&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;3H2O (M=Zr/HfIV; X=Re/TcVII), elucidated by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. We used these model compounds to understand the pervasive 93Zr&#8208;99Tc coextraction with further speciation studies in water, nitric acid, and tetrabutylphosphate (TBP) &#8208;kerosene; where the latter two media are relevant to nuclear fuel reprocessing. SAXS (small angle X&#8208;ray scattering), compositional evaluation, and where experimentally feasible, ESI&#8208;MS (electrospray ionization mass spectrometry) showed that perrhenate/pertechnetate influence Zr/HfIV&#8208;speciation in water. In Zr&#8208;XO4 solvent extraction studies to simulate fuel reprocessing, we provide evidence that TcO4&#8722; enhances extraction of ZrIV, and compositional analysis of the extracted metal&#8208;complexes (Zr&#8208;ReO4 study) is consistent with the crystallized ZrIV2(OH)2(ReVIIO4&#8722;)6(H2O)6&#8901;dimer.

         <title>Synthesis and Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction of a Cyclic Zinc(II) Porphyrin Trimer with an Encapsulated Rhenium(I) Bipyridine Tricarbonyl Complex</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We introduced a [Re(CO)3Br] fragment into the trimer to create a new heterobimetallic photocatalyst. The presence of ester groups in the Zn porphyrin trimer significantly deactivated CO2 reduction. After converting the ester groups to acetoxymethyl groups, the photocatalytic activity was remarkably enhanced. The modified trimer exhibited Re&#8208;induced phosphorescence, which was quenched by an electron donor, indicating efficient electron transfer during CO2 reduction.







Abstract
We previously reported a cyclic Zn(II) porphyrin trimer in which three Zn porphyrins are alternately bridged by three 2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine (bpy) moieties, enabling the encapsulation of metal complexes within the nanopore formed by the Zn porphyrins. In this study, we introduced a [Re(CO)3Br] fragment into one of the bpy moieties of the cyclic trimer to form the catalytic Re(4,4&#8217;&#8208;R2&#8208;bpy)(CO)3Br center (R=methyl ester). The ester groups (R) play an important role in the synthesis of the cyclic structure. However, it was observed that these ester groups significantly deactivated the photocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction. Therefore, we converted the ester groups with a suitable reducing reagent into hydroxymethyl groups, followed by acetylation to form acetoxymethyl groups. This modification remarkably enhanced the photocatalytic activity of the cyclic trimer=Re complex system for CO2 reduction. Moreover, in the modified system, the presence of the Re complex induced room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence of the Zn porphyrin. The phosphorescence was significantly quenched by 1,3&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;2&#8208;phenyl&#8208;2,3&#8208;dihydro&#8208;1H&#8208;benzo[d]imidazole, indicating that efficient electron transfer mediated by the excited triplet state of the Zn porphyrin occurs during the photocatalytic CO2 reduction.

         <title>Electrophilic Fluorination of Silyl Dienol Ethers: a General and Selective Access to &#947;&#8208;Fluoro Enals</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first general synthesis of &#947;&#8208;fluoro &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated aldehydes was achieved from the corresponding silyl dienol ethers and N&#8208;fluorobenzenesulfonimide (NFSI). The complete selectivity towards the &#947; position was rationalized thanks to DFT calculations.







Abstract
We describe the direct synthesis of &#947;&#8208;fluoro enals from the corresponding silyl dienol ethers. This simple process operates under mild conditions and is compatible with a wide range of functionalities. The high &#947; regioselectivity of this protocol was rationalized by means of theoretical calculations.

         <title>Photophysical Analysis of Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission (AIE) Luminogens Based on Triphenylamine and Thiophene: Insights into Emission Behavior in Solution and PMMA Films</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photophysical analysis of the Triphenylamine&#8722;Thiophene Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission luminogen was conducted in solution and PMMA films. In a solution, emission can arise from either the locally excited (LE) or twisted intramolecular charge transfer (TICT) state, depending on the solvent. In PMMA films, only LE state emission occurs, but excimer&#8208;like formations reduce emission intensity. This effect was probe in Luminescent Solar Concentrator.







Abstract
Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission (AIE) luminogens have garnered significant interest due to their distinctive applications in different applications. Among the diverse molecular architectures, those based on triphenylamine and thiophene hold prominence. However, a comprehensive understanding of the deactivation mechanism both in solution and films remains lacking. In this study, we synthesized and characterized spectroscopically two AIE luminogens: 5&#8208;(4&#8208;(bis(4&#8208;methoxyphenyl)amino)phenyl)thiophene&#8208;2&#8208;carbaldehyde (TTY) and 5&#8242;&#8208;(4&#8208;(bis(4&#8208;methoxyphenyl)amino)phenyl)&#8208;[2,2&#8242;&#8208;bithiophene]&#8208;5&#8208;carbaldehyde (TTO). Photophysical and theoretical analyses were conducted in both solution and PMMA films to understand the deactivation mechanism of TTY and TTO. In diluted solutions, the emission behavior of TTY and TTO is influenced by the solvent, and the deactivation of the excited state can occur via locally excited (LE) or twisted intramolecular charge transfer (TICT) state. In PMMA films, rotational and translational movements are constrained, necessitating emission solely from the LE state. Nevertheless, in the PMMA film, excimers&#8208;like structures form, resulting in the emergence of a longer wavelength band and a reduction in emission intensity. The zenith of emission intensity occurs when molecules are dispersed at higher concentrations within PMMA, effectively diminishing the likelihood of excimer&#8208;like formations. Luminescent Solar Concentrators (LSC) were fabricated to validate these findings, and the optical efficiency was studied at varying concentrations of luminogen and PMMA.

         <title>Cucurbit[7]uril&#8208;mediated Histidine Dimerization: Exploring the Structure and Binding Mechanism</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Histidine amino acid forms a 2&#8201;:&#8201;1 complex with cucurbit[7]uril (CB7), as confirmed using X&#8208;ray diffraction experiments. The affinity of histidine in oligopeptides strongly depends on the neighbouring residues in the sequence, with the strongest binding observed for Tyr&#8208;His and Leu&#8208;His.







Abstract
Cucurbit[7,8]urils are known to form inclusion complexes with hydrophobic amino acids such as Trp, Tyr, Phe, and Met, as well as peptides containing these residues at the N&#8208;terminus. Despite their widespread use in protein purification, the affinity of histidine (His) for cucurbit[7,8]urils has not been extensively explored. In this study, X&#8208;ray diffraction experiments were conducted to investigate the binding of two histidine moieties to the cucurbit[7]uril (CB7) cavity, resulting in a network of &#960;&#8211;&#960; and hydrogen bonds. This assembly was found to induce a His pKa shift of &#916;pKa=&#8722;4. Histidine weakly bound to CB7 or CB8; however, isothermal titration calorimetry revealed micromolar equilibrium dissociation constant values for CB7 and CB8 when bound to dipeptides containing His at the C&#8208;terminus. Conversely, dipeptides with His at the N&#8208;terminus exhibited millimolar values. Additionally, the His&#8208;Gly&#8208;Gly tripeptide formed a 2&#8201;:&#8201;1 complex with CB7. These findings suggest the potential use of histidine and histidine&#8208;containing tags in conjunction with CB7 for various biological applications.

         <title>Anthraquinone&#8208;Modified Silica Nanoparticles as Heterogeneous Photocatalyst for the Oxidative Hydroxylation of Arylboronic Acids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this work, the synthesis and characterization of a heterogeneous photocatalyst based on spherical silica nanoparticles superficially modified with anthraquinone 2&#8208;carboxylic acid (AQ&#8208;COOH) are presented. The nanomaterial was characterized by TEM, SEM, FT&#8208;IR, diffuse reflectance, fluorescence, NMR, DLS, XRD and XPS. These analyses confirm the covalent linking of AQ&#8208;COOH with the NH2 functionality in the nanomaterial and, more importantly, the photocatalyst retains its photophysical properties once bound. The heterogeneous photocatalyst was successfully employed in the aerobic hydroxylation of arylboronic acids to phenols under sustainable reaction conditions. Phenols were obtained in high yields (up to 100 %) with low catalyst loading (3.5 mol %), reaching TOF values of 3.7 h&#8208;1. Using 2&#8208;propanol as solvent at room temperature, the visible light photocatalysis produced H2O2 as a key intermediate to promote the aerobic hydroxylation of arylboronic acids. The heterogeneous photocatalyst was reused at least 5 times, without modification of the nanomaterial structure and morphology. This simple heterogeneous system showed great catalytic activity under sustainable reaction conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>A functional electrolyte containing P&#8208;phenyl diisothiocyanate (PDITC) additive achieves the interphase stability of high nickel cathode in a wide temperature range</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) with high nickel cathode have high specific energy, but as the nickel content in the cathode active material increases, batteries are suffering from temperature limitations, unstable performance, and transition metal dissolution during long cycling. In this work, a functional electrolyte with P&#8208;phenyl diisothiocyanate (PDITC) additive is developed to stabilize the performance of LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 (NCM811)/graphite LIBs over a wide temperature range. Compared to the batteries without the additive, the capacity retention of the batteries with PDITC&#8208;containing electrolyte increases from 23% to 74% after 1400 cycles at 25 &#176;C, and from 15% to 85% after 300 cycles at 45 &#176;C. After being stored at 60 &#176;C, the capacity retention rate and capacity recovery rate of the battery are also improved. In addition, the PDITC&#8208;containing battery has a higher discharge capacity at &#8208;20 &#176;C, and the capacity retention rate increases from 79% to 90% after 500 cycles at 0 &#176;C. Both theoretical calculations and spectroscopic results demonstrate that PDITC is involved in constructing a dense interphase, inhibiting the decomposition of the electrolyte and reducing the interfacial impedance. The application of PDITC provides a new strategy to improve the wide&#8208;temperature performance of the NCM811/graphite LIBs.</dc:description>

         <title>Hydride&#8208;Containing Pt&#8208;doped Cu&#8208;rich Nanoclusters: Synthesis, Structure, and Electrocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A structurally precise hydride&#8208;containing Pt&#8208;doped Cu&#8208;rich nanocluster [PtH2Cu14{S2P(OiPr)2}6(CCPh)6] (1) has been synthesized. It consists of a bicapped icosahedral Cu14 cage that encapsulates a linear PtH2 unit. Upon the addition of two equivalents of CF3COOH to 1, two hydrido clusters are isolated. These clusters are [PtHCu11{S2P(OiPr)2}6(CCPh)4] (2), which is a vertex&#8208;missing Cu11 cuboctahedron encaging a PtH moiety, and [PtH2Cu11{S2P(OiPr)2}6(CCPh)3] (3), a distorted 3,3,4,4,4&#8208;pentacapped trigonal prismatic Cu11 cage enclosing a PtH2 unit. The electronic structure of 2, analyzed by Density Functional Theory, is a 2e superatom. The electrocatalytic activities of 1&#8208;3 for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) were compared. Notably, Cluster 2 exhibited an exceptionally excellent HER activity within metal nanoclusters, with an onset potential of &#8211;0.03&#8197;V (at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2), a Tafel slope of 39&#8197;mV&#8201;dec&#8722;1, and consistent HER activity throughout 3000&#8197;cycles in 0.5&#8197;M H2SO4. Our study suggests that the accessible central Pt site plays a crucial role in the remarkable HER activity and may provide valuable insights for establishing correlations between catalyst structure and HER activity.</dc:description>

         <title>Anthraquinodimethane&#8208;Based Molecular Switches Tethered by Four&#8208;Arm Star&#8208;like Polymers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Molecular switches that reversibly change their structures and physical properties are important for applications such as sensing and information processing at molecular scales. In order to avoid the intermolecular aggregation that is often detrimental to the stimuli&#8208;responses of molecular switches, previous studies of molecular switches have been often conducted in dilute solutions which are difficult for applications in solid&#8208;state devices. Here we report molecular design and synthesis that integrates anthraquinodimethane as molecular switching units into polymers with amenable processibility in solid states. Optical and electron spin resonance characterizations indicate that the four&#8208;arm polymers of poly(&#949;&#8208;caprolactone) or poly(D,L&#8208;lactide) tethered from anthraquinodimethane slow down the dynamics of the conformational switching between the folded and the twisted conformations, enhance the photoluminescence in solid states and impart materials with a small energy gap from singlet ground state to thermally accessible triplet state.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhancing Polymer Electrolyte Membrane Fuel Cells with Ionic Liquids: A Review</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) represent a promising clean energy solution. However, their widespread adoption faces hurdles related to component optimization. This review explores the pivotal role of ionic liquids (ILs) in enhancing PEMFC performance, focusing on their role in polymer electrolyte membranes, catalyst modification, and other components. By addressing key obstacles, ILs provide a pathway towards the widespread commercialization of PEMFCs. In the realm of PEMFC membranes, ILs have shown great potential in improving proton conductivity, mechanical strength, and thermal stability. Additionally, the utilization of ILs as catalyst modifiers has shown promise in enhancing the electrocatalytic activity of electrodes and reduce their agglomeration, thereby augmenting catalytic performance. Furthermore, ILs can be tailored to optimize the catalyst&#8208;support interaction, ultimately enhancing the overall fuel cell efficiency. Their unique properties, such as high oxygen solubility and low volatility, offer advantages in terms of reducing mass transport and water management issues. This review not only underscores the promising advancements achieved thus far but also outlines the challenges that must be addressed to unlock the full potential of ILs in PEMFC technology, offering a valuable resource for researchers and engineers working toward the realization of efficient and durable PEMFCs.</dc:description>

         <title>Bicyclo[m.n.k]alkane Building Blocks as Promising Benzene and Cycloalkane Isosteres: Multigram Synthesis, Physicochemical and Structural Characterization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrophilic double bond functionalization &#8211; intramolecular enolate alkylation sequence was used to obtain a series of bridged and fused bicyclo[m.n.k]alkane derivatives (i.e., bicyclo[4.1.1]octanes, bicyclo[2.2.1]heptanes, bicyclo[3.2.1]octanes, bicyclo[3.1.0]hexanes, and bicyclo[4.2.0]heptanes). The scope and limitations of the method were established, and applicability to the multigram synthesis of target bicyclic compounds was illustrated. Using the developed protocols, over 50 mono&#8208; and bifunctional building blocks relevant to medicinal chemistry were prepared. The synthesized compounds are promising isosteres of benzene and cycloalkane rings, which is confirmed by their physicochemical and structural characterization (pKa, LogP, and exit vector parameters (EVP)). &#8220;Rules of thumb&#8221; for the upcoming isosteric replacement studies were proposed.</dc:description>

         <title>Cu(I) Complexes Comprising tetrahedral Mo2E2 or Mo2PE units (E = P, As, Sb) as Chelating Ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Novel isomorphous tetranuclear complexes, [(dppf)Cu( &#956;  3  , &#951;  2:2:2  &#8208;E2{CpMo(CO)2}2]BF4 [E = P (1), As (4), Sb (5), (dppf = 1,1&#8242;&#8208;bis&#8208;(diphenylphosphino)&#8208;ferrocene)] and [(dppf)Cu( &#956;  3  , &#951;  2:2:2  &#8208;PE{CpMo(CO)2}2]BF4 [E = As (2), Sb(3)] were synthesized from the reactions between [(dppf)Cu(MeCN)2][BF4] and tetrahedral molybdenum complexes containing unsubstituted homo&#8208; and hetero&#8208;diatomic group&#8208;15 elements [( &#956; , &#951;  2:2  &#8208;E2{CpMo(CO)2}2] [E = P (A), As (D), Sb (E)] and [( &#956; , &#951;  2:2  &#8208;PE{CpMo(CO)2}2] [E = As (B), Sb (C)], respectively. In all these products, the {Mo2E2} or {Mo2PE} moieties coordinate the Cu(I) center via a rare side&#8208;on  &#951;  2  &#8208;coordination mode. The X&#8208;ray structure analyses of [(dppf)Cu(&#956;3,&#951;2:2:1&#8208;PSb{CpMo(CO)2}2][BF4] demonstrate, for the first time, the utilization of an  &#951;  1  &#8208;coordination mode for the ligand complex C to coordinate to the Cu(I) center.

In all these products, the {Mo2E2} or {Mo2PE} moieties coordinate the Cu(I) center via a rare side-on  &#951;  2  -coordination mode. The X-ray structure analyses of [(dppf)Cu(&#956;3,&#951;2:2:1-PSb{CpMo(CO)2}2][BF4] demonstrate, for the first time, the utilization of an  &#951;  1  -coordination mode for the ligand complex C to coordinate to the Cu(I) center. All the products were characterized by X-ray crystallography, NMR and IR spectroscopy, mass spectrometry and elemental analysis. Electrochemical studies also revealed the formation of 1-5, and, further, to understand the structure and bonding of the products, theoretical calculations using density functional theory (DFT) were conducted.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Oligo&#8208;Condensation Reactions of Silanediols with Conservation of Solid&#8208;State&#8208;Structural Features</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Oligo&#8208; and polysiloxanes are usually prepared by condensation reactions in solvents without control of stereochemistry. Here we present a solventless thermal condensation of stable organosilanols which act as precursors in a thermal condensation reaction. We investigated the condensation reactions of organosilanediols with different organic substituents, having in common at least one aromatic group. The condensation kinetics of the precursors observed by NMR spectroscopy revealed a strong dependence on temperature, time, and substitution pattern at the silicon atom. SEC measurements showed that chain length increases with increasing condensation temperature and time and lower steric demand of the substituents, which also influences the glass transition temperatures (Tg). X&#8208;ray diffraction studies of the crystalline silanediols and their condensation products revealed a structural correlation between the substituent location in the crystalline precursors and the formed polysiloxanes induced by the hydrogen bond pattern. In certain cases, it is possible to carry out topotactic polymerization in the solid&#8208;state, which has its origin in the crystal structure.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Supramolecular polymers built from stimuli&#8208;responsive host&#8208;guest interactions represent an attractive way of tailoring smart materials. Herein, we exploit the chaotropic effect of polyoxometalates and related host&#8208;guest properties to design unconventional polymer systems with reversible redox and thermo&#8208;responsive sol&#8208;gel transition. These supramolecular networks result from the association of cyclodextrin&#8208;based oligomers and Keggin&#8208;type POMs acting as electro&#8208;active crosslinking agents. The structure and the dynamics of such self&#8208;assembly systems have been investigated using a multiscale approach involving MALDI&#8208;TOF, viscosity measurements, cyclic voltammetry, 1H&#8208;NMR (1D and DOSY), and Small&#8208;Angle X&#8208;ray Scattering. Our results reveal that the chaotropic effect corresponds to a powerful and efficient force that can be used to induce responsiveness in hybrid supramolecular oligomeric systems.</dc:description>

         <title>The Phosphidosilicates AE2Li4SiP4 (AE = Ca, Sr, Eu) and Ba4Li16Si3P12</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The quaternary phosphidosilicates AE2Li4SiP4 (AE = Ca, Sr, Eu) and Ba4Li16Si3P12 were synthesized by heating the elements and Li3P under argon atmosphere. Their crystal structures were determined by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. AE2Li4SiP4 crystallize in a new layered structure type (P21/m, Z = 2) with CdI2&#8208;analoguos layers. Edge sharing CaP6 octahedra are separated by layers of vertex&#8208;sharing SiP4 and LiP4 tetrahedra, which contain additional chains of LiP6 octahedra. Ba4Li16Si3P12 forms likewise a new structure type (P21/c, Z = 16) with a three&#8208;dimensional network of SiP4, Si2P6 and LiP4 entities as well as one phosphorus site not bonded to silicon. Barium is located in capped trigonal prisms of phosphorus which form strongly corrugated layers. 31P and 29Si solid&#8208;state NMR spectra confirm the crystal structures of the compounds AE2Li4SiP4. 7Li spectra show only one signal in spite of quite different crystallographic positions, which indicate possible Li+ mobility. However, this signal is much broader compared to the known Li+ conducting phosphidosilicates. Accordingly, electrochemical impedance measurements show low Li+ conductivities.</dc:description>

         <title>Single&#8208;ion spin qubits of Cu(II) doped in Zn(II) metal&#8208;organic frameworks above microsecond phase memory time</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>With the aim of creating single&#8208;ion Cu(II) spin qubits in a rigid metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF), this work demonstrates a doping of 5%, 2%, 1%, and 0.1% mol of Cu(II) ions into a perovskite&#8208;type MOF [CH6N3][Zn(HCOO)3]. The presence of dopant Cu(II) sites are confirmed with anisotropic g&#8208;factors (gx = 2.07, gy = 2.12, and gz = 2.44) in the S = 1/2 system by experimentally and theoretically. Magnetic dynamics indicate the occurrence of a slow magnetic relaxation via the direct and Raman processes under an applied field, with a relaxation time (&#964;) of 3.5 ms (5%Cu), 9.2 ms (2%Cu), and 15 ms (1%Cu) at 1.8 K. Furthermore, pulse&#8208;ESR spectroscopy reveals spin qubit properties with a spin&#8208;spin relaxation (phase memory) time (T2) of 0.21 &#956;s (2%Cu), 0.39 &#956;s (1%Cu), and 3.0 &#956;s (0.1%Cu) at 10 K as well as Rabi oscillation between MS = &#177;1/2 spin sublevels. T2 above microsecond is achieved for the first time in the Cu(II)&#8208;doped MOFs. It can be observed at submicrosecond around 50 K. These spin relaxations are very sensitive to the spin&#8211;spin interactions relating with cross&#8208;relaxation between the Cu(II) sites and can be tuned by adjusting the dopant concentration.</dc:description>

         <title>In vitro Production of Hemin&#8208;Based Artificial Metalloenzymes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing enzyme alternatives is pivotal to improving and enabling new processes in biotechnology and industry. Artificial metalloenzymes (ArMs) are combinations of protein scaffolds with metal elements, such as metal nanoclusters or metal&#8208;containing molecules with specific catalytic properties, which can be customized. Here, we engineered an ArM based on the consensus tetratricopeptide repeat (CTPR) scaffold by introducing a unique histidine residue to coordinate the hemin cofactor. Our results show that this engineered system exhibits robust peroxidase&#8208;like catalytic activity driven by the hemin. The expression of the scaffold and subsequent coordination of hemin was achieved by recombinant expression in bulk and through in vitro transcription and translation systems in water&#8208;in&#8208;oil drops. The ability to synthesize this system in emulsio paves the way to improve its properties by means of droplet microfluidic screenings, facilitating the exploration of the protein combinatorial space to discover improved or novel catalytic activities.</dc:description>

         <title>One&#8208;pot Construction of Metal Nanoparticles Loaded COF Catalysts for Aqueous Hydrogenation Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The catalysis performance of metal nanoparticles (NPs) will be significantly deteriorated because of their spontaneous agglomeration during practical applications. Covalent&#8208;organic frameworks (COFs) materials with functional groups and well&#8208;defined channels benefit for the dispersion and anchor of metal ions and the confined growth of metal NPs, working as an ideal platform to compose catalytic systems. In this article, we report a one&#8208;pot strategy for the preparation of metal NPs loaded COFs without the need of post&#8208;modification. During the polymerization process, the pre&#8208;added metal ions were stabilized by the rapidly formed COF oligomers and hardly disturb the construction of COFs. After reduction, metal NPs are uniformly anchored on the COF matrix. Eventually, a wide spectrum of metal NPs, including Au, Pd, Pt, AuPd, CuPd, CuPt and CuPdPt, loaded COFs are successfully prepared. The versatility and metal ions anchoring mechanism are verified with four different COF matrixes. Taking AuPd NPs as example, the resultant AuPd NPs loaded COF materials can selectively decompose ammonium formate and produce hydrogen in&#8208;situ, exhibiting over 99% conversion of hydrodechlorination for chlorobenzenes and nitro&#8208;reduction reaction for nitroaromatic compounds under ambient temperature in aqueous solution.</dc:description>

In this article, we report a one-pot strategy for the preparation of metal NPs loaded COFs without the need of post-modification. During the polymerization process, the pre-added metal ions were stabilized by the rapidly formed COF oligomers and hardly disturb the construction of COFs. After reduction, metal NPs are uniformly anchored on the COF matrix. Eventually, a wide spectrum of metal NPs, including Au, Pd, Pt, AuPd, CuPd, CuPt and CuPdPt, loaded COFs are successfully prepared. The versatility and metal ions anchoring mechanism are verified with four different COF matrixes. Taking AuPd NPs as example, the resultant AuPd NPs loaded COF materials can selectively decompose ammonium formate and produce hydrogen in-situ, exhibiting over 99% conversion of hydrodechlorination for chlorobenzenes and nitro-reduction reaction for nitroaromatic compounds under ambient temperature in aqueous solution.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>
