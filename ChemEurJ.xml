         <title>Asymmetric Ligand Field Effects in Electron&#8208;Rich Heterometallic Extended Metal Atom Chain Compounds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synthesis of multimetallic compounds with modifiable scaffolding ligands raises questions about the distribution of electronic effects in heterometallic systems. Here we investigate the asymmetry of the substituent effects in a modified 2,2&#8242;&#8208;dipyradylamine ligand applied to a heterotrimetallic extended metal atom chain (HEMAC) framework. We find that the Mo2 core experiences a stronger effect than the heterometal, counter to expectations based on metal atom electronegativity.








Abstract
In heterometallic systems, electron donation from the ligands may influence the metal atoms in either a symmetric or asymmetric way, with the expected case being that the more electronegative metal is favored. Here, we describe a systematic study of heterometallic compounds where this expectation is not observed. In this study, we use a modification of the symmetric 2,2&#8242;&#8208;dipyridylamine (dpa) ligand with electron donating ethyl groups, the 4,4&#8242;&#8208;diethyl&#8208;2,2&#8242;&#8208;dipyridylamine ligand (dedpa), to prepare heterometallic extended metal atom chain (HEMAC) complexes with formula Mo2M&#8242;(dedpa)4Cl2 (M&#8242; = Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni). The effects of the electron donating substituents were studied through techniques including crystallography, magnetometry, cyclic voltammetry, EPR, M&#246;ssbauer, electronic absorption spectroscopy, and DFT calculations. We find that the new HEMACs are indeed more electron rich, easier to oxidize, and, most interestingly, the impact of the ethyl substituents is not applied equally to all the metals in the chain. The ligand field is stronger at the Mo2 site, but is surprisingly weaker at the M&#8242; center when compared to Mo2M&#8242;(dpa)4Cl2 complexes. We also find that changing the ligand field allows for previously unassigned electronic transitions to become visible, including excitations tentatively assigned to a triplet &#948;&#8208;&#948;* state within the Mo2 unit.

An ionic liquid consisting of 7,7,8,8&#8208;tetracyanoquinodimethane and tetra&#8208;n&#8208;octylphosphonium ions undergoes a room&#8208;temperature transformation from a paramagnetic liquid to a diamagnetic solid.

Abstract
An ionic liquid consisting of a 7,7,8,8&#8208;tetracyanoquinodimethane (TCNQ) radical anion and a tetra&#8208;n&#8208;octylphosphonium ion, 1+&#8226;TCNQ&#8226;&#8722;, undergoes a transformation near room temperature from paramagnetic liquid to diamagnetic solid accompanied by significant changes in photophysical properties. A blue solid of 1+&#8226;TCNQ&#8226;&#8722; melts upon heating above 328&#160;K, yielding a green liquid. The green liquid exhibits a magnetic susceptibility of 5&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;4 emu mol&#8722;1. Upon cooling, the liquid retains its paramagnetic properties until the temperature reaches approximately 300&#160;K. Upon further cooling below 300&#160;K, the paramagnetic liquid reverts to the initial blue solid. The solid form of 1+&#8226;TCNQ&#8226;&#8722; exhibits near&#8208;zero magnetic susceptibility. The thermal hysteresis loop with magnetic bistability is observed without decomposition over the temperature range from 300 to 328&#160;K. Crystal structure analysis, electron spin resonance (ESR), and electronic spectra indicate that the drastic changes in magnetic properties are attributable to the reversible &#960;&#8208;dimerization of TCNQ&#8226;&#8722; species during the solid&#8211;liquid/liquid&#8211;solid phase transitions. Additionally, the association/dissociation behaviors of the TCNQ&#8226;&#8722; dimers also induce significant changes in photophysical properties, especially in the short&#8208;wave infrared region (1000&#8211;2500&#160;nm), suggesting the potential application of 1+&#8226;TCNQ&#8226;&#8722; as a bifunctional material.

         <title>Substitution of CH3 by CH2F in 2&#8208;Methylerythritol Cyclodiphosphate Triggers Potent Inhibition of IspG with Concomitant Fluoride Ion Expulsion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The fluoromethyl analogue of MEcPP was identified as a very potent inhibitor of the oxygen&#8208;sensitive [4Fe&#8208;4S] metalloenzyme IspG. In the course of the IspG&#8208;catalyzed transformation, this novel compound undergoes fluoride elimination, offering additional evidence for the involvement of a carbanionic intermediate in the mechanism of this enzyme.








Abstract
IspG (also known as GcpE) is a key [4Fe&#8208;4S] metalloenzyme that catalyzes the penultimate step of the methylerythritol phosphate (MEP) pathway, a well&#8208;established target for the development of new antimicrobials. This oxygen&#8208;sensitive enzyme mediates the reductive dehydroxylation of 2&#8208;C&#8208;methyl&#8208;d&#8208;erythritol 2,4&#8208;cyclodiphosphate (MEcPP) to (E)&#8208;4&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;3&#8208;methylbut&#8208;2&#8208;en&#8208;1&#8208;yl diphosphate (HMBPP), requiring electron transfer proteins to deliver two electrons needed for catalysis. To probe the mechanism of IspG and access new mechanism&#8208;based inhibitors, we synthesized a substrate analogue, monofluoromethyl&#8208;d&#8208;erythritol cyclodiphosphate, in which the natural methyl group of MEcPP is replaced by a CH2F group. This analogue proved to be a potent inhibitor of IspG. This study also demonstrates that electron capture is a prerequisite for inhibition and that the inhibitor leads to fluoride release in the IspG&#8208;catalyzed reaction. Together, these results provide further support for the involvement of a carbanionic intermediate in the IspG mechanism.

         <title>Helical Polymer&#8208;Based Polycarboxylate as Chiral Ligands in Cu&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective Diels&#8211;Alder Reaction in Water</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Helical poly(quinoxaline&#8208;2,3&#8208;diyl) bearing chiral carboxylic acid side chains forms a polycarboxylate that provides an asymmetric and hydrophobic environment in basic water. The polycarboxylate serves as an efficient ligand for copper&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric Diels&#8211;Alder reactions in water, affording chiral products with up to 99% ee. Control experiments suggest the formation of dicarboxylate&#8211;copper complexes via inter&#8208;unit carboxylate coordination.








Abstract
Water&#8208;soluble poly(quinoxaline&#8208;2,3&#8208;diyl)s (PQXlac) bearing chiral carboxylic acid side chains derived from l&#8208;lactic acid were used for Cu&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective Diels&#8211;Alder reaction in water. The reaction of azachalcone with cyclopentadiene in the presence of PQXlac (1000mer, 1 mol% monomer unit) and Cu(NO3)2 (1 mol% Cu) proceeded at 5&#160;&#176;C in good yield with high enantioselectivity up to 99% ee. The utilization of the corresponding oligomers shorter than 10mer resulted in low chemical yield with low enantioselectivity, suggesting that a tight helical structure is essential for the formation of an effective catalyst. A comparison of the random and block copolymer of PQXlac and PQXteg, which has achiral tetra(ethylene glycol) side chains, indicated that block copolymer, in which the carboxylate groups are more densely packed, showed higher chemical yields along with higher enantioselectivity. These results suggest that the active catalyst has a copper dicarboxylate structure in which two carboxylate groups on every other monomer unit coordinate to the Cu center to form an effective chiral reaction environment.

The reaction of azachalcone with cyclopentadiene in the presence of &lt;b&gt;PQXlac&lt;/b&gt; (1000mer, 1 mol% monomer unit) and Cu(NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (1 mol% Cu) proceeded at 5&#160;&#176;C in good yield with high enantioselectivity up to 99% ee. The utilization of the corresponding oligomers shorter than 10mer resulted in low chemical yield with low enantioselectivity, suggesting that a tight helical structure is essential for the formation of an effective catalyst. A comparison of the random and block copolymer of &lt;b&gt;PQXlac&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;PQXteg&lt;/b&gt;, which has achiral tetra(ethylene glycol) side chains, indicated that block copolymer, in which the carboxylate groups are more densely packed, showed higher chemical yields along with higher enantioselectivity. These results suggest that the active catalyst has a copper dicarboxylate structure in which two carboxylate groups on every other monomer unit coordinate to the Cu center to form an effective chiral reaction environment.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Simple Design of UV&#8208;curable Covalent Adaptive Networks Operated by Thiourea Bond Exchange</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple covalent adaptable network with a thiourea bond exchange mechanism is demonstrated. A feature is the use of thiol&#8208;ene UV&#8208;curing, realized through the synthesis of a diallyl monomer bearing thiourea units. The curing behavior, rheological properties, stress relaxation, and recyclability are evaluated, providing insights for straightforward yet versatile CAN design strategies.








Abstract
Using the concept of covalent adaptive networks (CANs), or vitrimers, sustainable and reprocessable cross&#8208;linked polymer materials can be developed. Advances in molecular design and understanding of the underlying physics are essential for translating such bond exchange concepts into practical applications. In this study, we demonstrate the design of a simple CAN system via UV&#8208;curing of a thiol&#8208;ene click reaction, where the network is formed by reacting telechelic allyl monomers with tri&#8208;functional thiol cross&#8208;linkers. The telechelic allyl monomer, containing thiourea bonds, is synthesized specifically for this purpose, with thiourea units acting as dynamic bond exchange sites within the network. Notably, this design offers broad tunability in the topological and chemical features, highlighting an important principle in the development of model CANs for physical property investigation. Here, we evaluate curing behavior, temperature&#8208;sweep rheological properties, stress relaxation, and recyclability for a representative formulation, providing insights into simple yet versatile design strategies.

         <title>Supramolecular 3D Polymers Created via Chalcogen Bonding Using Benzotellurazoles as Planar Recognition Units</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Starting with small planar benzotellurazoles, it is possible to create 3D supramolecular architectures. These exhibit a high degree of cross&#8208;linking, which is caused by various chalcogen bonding (ChB) motifs. Introducing electron&#8208;withdrawing substituents onto the benzotellurazole makes the ChB motifs more apparent and results in more complex superstructures.








Abstract
In addition to hydrogen and halogen bonds, chalcogen bonds (ChBs) are gaining significance in the domain of crystal engineering. Nitrogen&#8208;containing tellurium compounds are well&#8208;suited for this purpose, as they form a variety of solid&#8208;state structures through ChBs. Despite prior studies addressing substituent effects in benzotellurazoles, the influence of fluorine atoms on the benzene backbone of 1,3&#8208;benzotellurazoles remains to be investigated in the context of solid&#8208;state arrangement. Here, we demonstrate that the incorporation of fluorine atoms can impact the nature and quantity of ChBs in the solid state. The electron&#8208;withdrawing properties of the introduced substituents result in alterations to the ChB donor (Te) and acceptor (N) properties, leading to a preferential interaction with competing Lewis bases such as carbonyl groups. A noteworthy exception was noticed for the derivatives with a nitrile group at position 2. Regardless of the number of fluorine atoms, a high degree of 3D cross&#8208;linking can be observed via a 5&#8208;ChBs&#8208;5&#8208;neighbors motif, including a characteristic two&#8208;lone&#8208;pair/one&#8208;&#963;&#8208;hole interaction. These findings offer valuable design principles for supramolecular materials, particularly in the context of crystal engineering.

         <title>NIR&#8208;II Organic Phototheranostics: Matching Rotatable Donors and Shielding Acceptors for Enhanced Imaging and Phototherapy by Stabilized Triplet Excitons and Optimized Radiative Decay</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) organic phototheranostic agents (OPTAs) were constructed by molecular engineering of acceptor shielding and donor rotation. Notably, BPN&#8208;P nanoparticles (NPs) showed high NIR&#8208;II emission, good radical reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, and a photothermal conversion efficiency (PCE) of 63%, achieving superior efficacy in NIR&#8208;II imaging&#8208;guided synergistic photodynamic/photothermal cancer therapy.








Abstract
Second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) organic phototheranostic agents (OPTAs) have received significant interests in cancer treatment by enabling precise positioning of deep&#8208;seated lesions and highly efficient ablation of tumors. However, competition between radiative and nonradiative pathways of the excitons sets great obstacles for obtaining robust OPTAs. Herein, we propose to fabricate high&#8208;performance NIR&#8208;II OPTAs through molecular engineering of acceptor shielding units as well as manipulating molecular conformations by donor rotation. Accordingly, two series of OPTAs (BPN series: 4,4&#8242;&#8208;(ethene&#8208;1,1&#8208;diyl)bis(N,N&#8208;dimethylaniline) as rotatable donor and butadiene as &#960;&#8208;bridge, BPTQ series: julolidine as donor and 2&#8208;vinylthiophene as &#960;&#8208;bridge) with different acceptor shielding units were designed. Photophysical data and theoretical calculations verified the introduction of rotatable donors can help to realize highly twisted molecular conformations, resulting in enhanced NIR&#8208;II emission and photothermal conversion efficiency (PCE). Moreover, the adoption of acceptor shielding units is advantageous for stabilizing triplet excitons for radical reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. As a result, a balance was achieved for BPN&#8208;P nanoparticles (NPs) in the BPN series, which exhibited high NIR&#8208;II emission, good radical ROS generation and highest PCE of 63%. BPN&#8208;P NPs achieved both high&#8208;resolution NIR&#8208;II angiography and imaging&#8208;guided synergistic photodynamic/photothermal cancer treatment in live mice model, showcasing the effectiveness of the strategy.

A green synthetic approach to planar hexacyclic indenoisoquinolinoquinolinamides was successfully accomplished via the [3&#160;+&#160;3] and [4&#160;+&#160;2] intramolecular cyclization between ene&#8208;yne&#8208;oxazolones and dihydroisoquinoline under neutral conditions, yielding products in good to excellent quantities.

Abstract
A cascade cyclization of polycyclic indenoisoquinolinoquinolinamides has been realized via metal&#8208;free [3&#160;+&#160;3] and [4&#160;+&#160;2] intramolecular cyclization of ene&#8208;yne&#8208;oxazolones and dihydroisoquinoline under neutral conditions in good to excellent yield. In this process, three rings and four bonds are formed with high atom economy under reaction conditions that comply with green chemistry principles. The biological activity of the indenoisoquinolinoquinolinamide analogs, which mimic the structure of lamellarins&#8212;a group of marine natural products&#8212;was evaluated. The results indicated that these indenoisoquinolinoquinolinamide analogs exhibited notable anti&#8208;cancer activity, with cytotoxicity profiles comparable to those of their lamellarin counterparts.

         <title>Photo&#8208;enabled &#945;&#8208;C(sp3)&#8208;H Functionalization of Sulfides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photochemical strategies have emerged as powerful solutions for enabling &#945;&#8208;C(sp3)&#8208;H functionalization of sulfides. This review comprehensively surveys photo&#8208;enabled sulfide &#945;&#8208;C&#160;&#9472;&#160;H functionalization methodologies, with particular focus on HAT and ET/PT mechanisms.








Abstract
Sulfides hold significant value in fine chemicals and pharmaceuticals.

         <title>Dual Excited&#8208;State Charge&#8208;Transfer Process in Luminescent Radicals with Spatially Folded Arrangement</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report four donor&#8211;acceptor structured luminescent radicals in which spatial folding between carbazole and radical units induces a unique dual excited&#8208;state CT process involving both TBCT and TSCT. Systematic photophysical studies combined with theoretical calculations elucidate how these two CT pathways influence the emissive behaviors of the radicals.








Abstract
The through&#8208;space charge transfer (TSCT) mechanism has attracted significant attention in closed&#8208;shell organic luminescent materials due to its strong environmental sensitivity, small singlet&#8211;triplet energy gap, and high exciton utilization efficiency. However, open&#8208;shell luminescent radicals mostly adopt D&#8211;A or D&#8211;&#960;&#8211;A skeletons to overcome the dark&#8208;state limitations of radicals, relying solely on a through&#8208;bond charge transfer (TBCT) process. To date, TSCT excited states in radical systems remain largely unexplored. In this study, we report the coexistence of TSCT and TBCT mechanisms in radical molecules. Four luminescent radicals (TB&#8208;MR, TB&#8208;DR, TBS&#8208;MR, and TBS&#8208;DR) were systematically investigated using absorption and fluorescence spectroscopy combined with theoretical calculations. The results reveal that the spatially folded conformation between carbazole units and radical centers in the TBS series induces abnormal photophysical behaviors deviating from conventional paradigms. Further electron&#8211;hole analysis indicates that the TBS series exhibits a dual excited&#8208;state charge transfer (CT) mechanism, with TSCT and TBCT contributions of approximately 70% and 30%, respectively. This discovery not only elucidates the influence of multiple CT processes on the excited&#8208;state behaviors of luminescent radicals but also establishes a novel excited&#8208;state engineering strategy for tuning the luminescence of open&#8208;shell systems.

         <title>Toward Non&#8208;Isocyanate Polyurethanes: Green Synthesis Routes and Recycling Technologies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In light of increasing environmental and regulatory pressures to minimize the use of isocyanates due to their toxicity, this paper comprehensively reviews current advances and future prospects in the synthesis and recycling of NIPUs, focusing on sustainable and environmentally friendly approaches. The review delves into innovative synthesis methodologies for NIPUs, highlighting green pathways while also addressing challenges related to end&#8208;of&#8208;life polyurethane management, with a focus on advancements in chemical recycling technologies.








Abstract
Polyurethanes (PUs) are extensively utilized polymers known for their excellent properties. However, the conventional synthesis of PUs heavily depends on toxic isocyanates, creating significant environmental and health risks. To mitigate these issues, research has increasingly focused on synthesizing non&#8208;isocyanate polyurethanes (NIPUs). This review systematically discusses the primary green synthesis routes for NIPUs: (1) Bis(dialkyl carbonate) route, (2) Transurethanization route, (3) Cyclic carbonate route, and (4) Ring&#8208;opening polymerization (ROP) route. While PUs exhibit superior mechanical and chemical performance, their disposal at the end of life remains a major challenge. Currently, the main recovery methods include chemical degradation (or raw material recycling) and mechanical recycling, with chemical recycling offering potential for a closed&#8208;loop process. This review briefly summarizes these disposal strategies, aiming to encourage sustainable practices. It highlights recent advancements in green synthesis and recycling technologies, focusing on pathways for creating environmentally friendly and recyclable NIPUs. In light of increasing environmental and regulatory pressures to minimize the use of isocyanates due to their toxicity, this paper comprehensively reviews current advances and future prospects in the synthesis and recycling of NIPUs, focusing on sustainable and environmentally friendly approaches. The review delves into innovative synthesis methodologies for NIPUs, highlighting green pathways while also addressing challenges related to end&#8208;of&#8208;life polyurethane management, with a focus on advancements in chemical recycling technologies.

         <title>&#947;&#8208;Cyclodextrin&#8211;Imidazolium Salt&#8208;Based Bioinspired Nanoreactor: Enantioselective Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed Arylation of Unprotected Isatin with Arylboronic Acids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The &#947;&#8208;CD&#8211;NHC&#8211;Rh catalyst system was demonstrated to promote the arylation of unprotected isatins with arylboronic acids in aqueous ethanol with high efficiency and enantioselectivity. The enantioselectivity was largely independent of the H2O/ethanol solvent composition ratio, indicating a reaction mechanism involving intramolecular self&#8208;inclusion of the NHC&#8211;Rh complex intermediate within the &#947;&#8208;CD cavity tethered to the NHC ligand.








Abstract
The optically active 3&#8208;aryl&#8208;3&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;2&#8208;oxindole skeleton is a promising pharmacophore in drug design and has led to the development of metal&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric reactions using designed chiral ligands for synthesizing 3&#8208;aryl&#8208;3&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;2&#8208;oxindoles from isatins (2,3&#8208;oxindoles), 3&#8208;aryl&#8208;2&#8208;oxindoles, and &#945;&#8208;ketoamides. Although the arylation of isatins is vital for convergent synthesis, most studies have used N&#8208;protected isatins, requiring the removal of protecting groups to obtain the desired bioactive products. Despite limited success in the direct high&#8208;enantioselective arylation of unprotected isatins (NH isatins), such arylation holds significant potential for improving atomic and synthetic efficiencies. In aqueous media, cyclodextrins (CDs) with hydrophobic and chiral cavities can selectively include organic compounds, making them potential nanoreactors for asymmetric reactions. In this study, imidazolium salts bearing a &#160;&#947;&#8208;CD were applied as N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) ligands for the Rh&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric arylation of NH isatins in environmentally benign aqueous ethanol. The arylation was successfully achieved in high yield and enantioselectivity using our &#947;&#8208;CD&#8211;NHC&#8211;Rh catalyst. This suggests that the arylation proceeds in the &#947;&#8208;CD cavity (host) through the self&#8208;inclusion of NHC&#9472;Rh complex intermediates (guests). These bio&#8208;inspired transition metal catalysts based on host&#8211;guest linkage systems are expected to contribute significantly to the development of efficient organic synthesis reactions with high enantioselectivity.

Abstract
The efficient development of electrocatalysts for the nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) under ambient conditions has been greatly challenging due to the high stability of the N&#8801;N bond and the competitive interference from the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). This work innovatively designs a graphitic carbon nitride substrate (g&#8208;C16N19) with a super&#8208;large pore structure based on the self&#8208;doping strategy and first&#8208;principles calculations, and constructs TM@g&#8208;C16N19 (TM&#160;=&#160;Ti &#8764; Au) single&#8208;atom catalyst systems. By establishing a &#8220;Four&#8208;Step&#8221; screening model, it is found that W@g&#8208;C16N19 exhibits the best NRR catalytic performance, with an ultralow limiting potential (UL) of &#8208;0.23&#160;V. Combining electron structure analyses such as charge density difference, ICOHP value, Bader charge, and spin magnetic moment, the micro&#8208;mechanism of W@g&#8208;C16N19 effectively activating the &#963;/&#960; bonds of N2 molecules through strong d&#8208;p orbital hybridization is revealed. Furthermore, based on the pH&#8208; and potential&#8208;dependent adsorption&#8208;free energy results calculated by the constant potential model, pH&#8208;potential coupling analysis shows that the configuration has a decisive influence on activity: the E&#8208;I/S&#8208;V mode dominates in alkaline media, while the E&#8208;O/S&#8208;O pathway is predominant under acidic conditions. In the E&#8208;I configuration, the energy barrier of the rate&#8208;determining step (PDS) of NRR decreases with the decrease of the electrode potential; conversely, the energy barrier of the PDS of NRR in the E&#8208;O/S&#8208;V/S&#8208;O configuration increases with the decrease of the electrode potential.

By establishing a &#8220;Four-Step&#8221; screening model, it is found that W@g-C&lt;sub&gt;16&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;19&lt;/sub&gt; exhibits the best NRR catalytic performance, with an ultralow limiting potential (U&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;) of -0.23&#160;V. Combining electron structure analyses such as charge density difference, ICOHP value, Bader charge, and spin magnetic moment, the micro-mechanism of W@g-C&lt;sub&gt;16&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;19&lt;/sub&gt; effectively activating the &#963;/&#960; bonds of N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; molecules through strong d-p orbital hybridization is revealed. Furthermore, based on the pH- and potential-dependent adsorption-free energy results calculated by the constant potential model, pH-potential coupling analysis shows that the configuration has a decisive influence on activity: the E-I/S-V mode dominates in alkaline media, while the E-O/S-O pathway is predominant under acidic conditions. In the E-I configuration, the energy barrier of the rate-determining step (PDS) of NRR decreases with the decrease of the electrode potential; conversely, the energy barrier of the PDS of NRR in the E-O/S-V/S-O configuration increases with the decrease of the electrode potential.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Exploring 4&#8208;Amino&#8208;1,8&#8208;Naphthalimides: Lifetime&#8208;Based Sensing of Chemical Micro&#8208;Environments</title>

         <dc:description>
We present a library of 4&#8208;amino&#8208;1,8&#8208;naphthalimides and evaluate their fluorescence lifetime responses to polarity and viscosity. Using fluorescence lifetime, we report polarity changes in rat serum during acute pancreatitis. These probes offer new tools for microenvironment sensing.








Abstract
Fluorescence lifetime offers a powerful approach to probe chemical microenvironments in biological systems, yet suitable fluorophores remain limited. Here, we report the synthesis and photophysical characterisation of a library of fifteen 4&#8208;amino&#8208;substituted 1,8&#8208;naphthalimides, incorporating diverse aliphatic and aromatic amines. These compounds exhibit strong solvatochromism and varied fluorescence lifetimes in response to polarity and viscosity. Notably, compound&#160;13&#160;demonstrates high brightness and pronounced fluorescence lifetime sensitivity to polarity, while compound&#160;17&#160;shows strong viscosity&#8208;dependent lifetime changes. We apply compound&#160;13&#160;to rat serum samples, revealing significant differences in fluorescence lifetime between healthy and acute pancreatitis conditions, consistent with polarity changes. In contrast, compound&#160;17&#160;showed no lifetime variation, suggesting limited viscosity changes in serum. These findings highlight the potential of 4&#8208;amino&#8208;1,8&#8208;naphthalimides as environment&#8208;sensitive probes, particularly for polarity sensing in complex biological samples. More generally, this work expands the photophysical understanding of naphthalimide derivatives and supports their application in fluorescence lifetime&#8208;based sensing of disease&#8208;related microenvironmental changes.

         <title>Enantiospecific Syntheses of Bicyclic Fragrance Molecules From Verbenone: Enhancing Odour Profiles and Stability</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A 6&#8208;step synthetic route has been developed for the synthesis of trans&#8208;fused bicyclic, nor&#8208;polywood derivatives using a ring&#8208;closing metathesis as the key step. These newly synthesized trans&#8208;decalin derivatives exhibited the characteristic woody odor of this class of compounds. The corresponding [6,7] and [6,5] derivatives have also been synthesized to compare their properties with the trans&#8208;decalin derivatives. All the products were obtained with a high degree of chirality starting from (&#8211;)&#8208;verbenone as the chiral pool starting material.








Abstract
Fragrances derived from terpenoid scaffolds continue to play a central role in the design of synthetic odorants, with trans&#8208;fused decalin system providing particularly valuable ambergris like woody notes. Inspired by the structural and stereochemical features of polywood and its analogues, we report herein a concise and versatile synthetic approach to novel bicyclic frameworks from the chiral pool precursor (&#8211;)&#8208;verbenone. An efficient, enantiospecific synthesis of trans&#8208;fused bicyclic fragrance molecules, including nor&#8208;polywood and novel [6,7]&#8208; and [6,5]&#8208;fused analogues, is reported. This six&#8208;step synthetic sequence utilized a powerful combination of conjugate addition, cyclobutane ring&#8208;opening, and a key Ring&#8208;Closing Metathesis (RCM) reactions. Subsequent stereoselective reductions, acetylations, and hydrogenations yield a diverse range of bicyclic frameworks in good overall yields with excellent stereocontrol. Importantly, olfactory evaluation confirms that all synthesized products retain the characteristic woody, amber&#8208;like notes of premium ambergris substitutes. These findings demonstrate the critical influence of ring&#8208;size variation on fragrance properties, providing new insights for the rational design of sophisticated odorants. This work not only provides an efficient synthesis of structurally diverse bicyclic systems but also expands the chemical space of ambergris&#8208;type odorants, offering new insights into structure&#8211;odour relationships for the development of next&#8208;generation woody fragrance ingredients.

         <title>Unlocking Diversity of Biologically Relevant Quinoline Scaffolds by Leveraging the Readily Available Feedstocks Under Cobalt&#8208;NHC Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study showcases a rare cobalt&#8208;catalyzed one&#8208;pot green protocol that enables divergent open&#8208;air synthesis and functionalization of two quinoline frameworks starting from the simple, nonhalogenated, biomass&#8208;derived precursors to deliver six different quinoline derivatives, promising candidates for medicinal and material science applications.








Abstract
Quinolines are privileged heterocycles with widespread applications in pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, and materials science. However, sustainable and efficient one&#8208;pot methods for synthesizing and functionalizing quinolines, e.g., 2&#8208;methyl/aminoquinoline derivatives remained scarce. Herein, we report a unified, green, and operationally simple one&#8208;pot strategy, which is enabled by a multitasking Co&#8208;NHC catalyst (Co3). Starting from 2&#8208;aminobenzyl alcohol and acetone or benzyl nitrile as reactant, the present method achieves selective cyclization under open&#8208;air conditions to afford 2&#8208;methyl or 2&#8208;aminoquinolines, respectively. Remarkably, the same catalytic system enables divergent C(sp3)&#8208;H functionalization's, including alkenylation, alkylation, dimerization, and N&#8208;alkylation in a single pot, yielding six structurally distinct quinoline classes. The protocol features broad substrate scope, excellent chemoselectivity, and high step economy, generating water and/or H2 as byproducts. Detailed mechanistic investigations, supported by control experiments, intermediate isolation, NMR/HRMS analysis, and DFT studies, reveal the dual catalytic role of the Co&#8208;NHC complex in both cyclization and subsequent transformations. Overall, the current cobalt&#8208;catalyzed platform paves the way for sustainable access to diverse quinoline architectures under mild and green conditions, relevant to drug discovery and advanced functional materials.

         <title>Toward Ultra&#8208;Narrowband Long&#8208;Wavelength Multiple&#8208;Resonance Emitters: Mechanistic Insights and Design Principles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Due to the narrowband emission with high efficiency, multiple&#8208;resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence materials are crucial for organic light&#8208;emitting diodes. This review provides an overview of the principles behind spectral narrowing in these emitters and also discusses the challenges and future prospects for achieving ultra&#8208;narrowband emission across the full visible spectrum.








Abstract
Multiple&#8208;resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) material represents a groundbreaking advancement in organic electronics, enabling ultra&#8208;narrowband emission with the enhanced efficiency and spectral accuracy. Leveraging the MR effect, MR&#8208;TADF materials inherently achieve narrow emission profiles that are crucial for High&#8208;definition display. These materials offer a significant advantage over traditional phosphorescence and TADF emitters, which enable high&#8208;performance organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) with intrinsically narrow emission spectra. However, realizing full&#8208;color ultra&#8208;narrowband emission is hindered by the intrinsic conflict between spectral tunability and narrowing of the emission bandwidth. Overcoming these challenges requires a deep understanding of the spectral narrowing mechanisms and the integration of precise molecular design strategies that balance efficiency, tunability, and emission purity. This review provides an overview of the principles behind spectral narrowing in boron/nitrogen&#8208;doped MR emitters, including the fundamental mechanisms, quantitative metrics, and recent breakthroughs. It also discusses the challenges and future prospects for achieving ultra&#8208;narrowband emission across the full visible spectrum, offering strategic guidance for the future development of OLED materials with enhanced color purity and performance.

         <title>Coping with the Blues: Simple and Photo&#8208;Stable Dye for Long&#8208;Term Live&#8208;Cell Imaging</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>

PyPe is a fluorescent emitter with low photobleaching thanks to its vinyl moiety serving as a radiationless relaxation group. This favors the configuration flip between E&#8208; and Z&#8208;isomers at excited states and promotes photostability. Then, photodimers form in various kinetics and proportions depending on temperature and complexation. Low toxicity makes it a blue photostable dye, readily taken up by cells, and suitable for bioimaging experiments.








Abstract
Dyes for long&#8208;term imaging of live cells are rare, especially in the blue region, as they need to be nontoxic and photo&#8208;stable. New simple pyrene&#8208;derived dyes have been synthesized and fully characterized, showing good cellular uptake, intense emission, and excellent stability. Their unusual stability secret lies in their flexible conformation, evidenced by the solid&#8208;state structures of coordination compounds obtained from the dyes and by 1H&#8208;NMR solution studies. Results show that under irradiation, the pyrene&#8208;based dye undergoes intersystem crossing (ISC) that leads to a configurational switching occurring at time scales that are faster than the formation of possible photobleaching products. Irradiation of these dyes over 24&#160;hours shows great photostability that was evaluated in different solvents. The possible mechanism of the stability of these dyes is discussed here. Being nontoxic and emitting at only a specific wavelength, these compounds are perfect for staining the cytosol of live cells and long&#8208;term imaging in parallel with other dyes of different colors.

         <title>Synthesis of Dithienylcycloalkene Molecular Switches Enabled by a Bench&#8208;Stable Ti&#8208;Complex</title>

Herein we report a set of cycloalkene&#8208;bridged DTEs with ring sizes ranging from 4&#8208; to 7&#8208;membered rings. The synthesis of these analogs was performed via a key McMurry coupling step, which was enabled by a practical, bench&#8208;stable Ti(IV)&#8208;complex. Remarkably, it is shown that the strained cyclobutene bridge outperforms other rings, even the most commonly featured cyclopentene, in terms of reversibility and fatigue resistance.








Abstract
Herein, we report a set of cycloalkene&#8208;bridged dithienylethene (DTE) molecular switches with ring sizes ranging from 4&#8208; to 7&#8208;membered rings. These analogs were accessed via McMurry carbonyl coupling using a bench&#8208;stable Ti(IV)&#8208;complex reagent instead of the generally applied fuming, liquid TiCl4, making the synthesis more practical and reproducible. The efficiency of the reaction was dependent on the ring size, providing the lowest yield for the largest, 7&#8208;membered ring. Structures having 3&#8208;membered cyclopropene bridges were prepared using an alternative strategy. Remarkably, the comparison of the photoswitching properties of the series showed that molecules bearing a strained cyclobutene bridge outperform the other switches in terms of reversibility and fatigue resistance.

         <title>Front Cover: Thorium Bis&#8208;Salophen Trimers as Anion Detectors and Binding Agents</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 58, October 16, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Front Cover illustrates the formation of a thorium three&#8208;to&#8208;one metal complex with a bis&#8208;salophen ligand to form a trimer with a &#916;,&#916;,&#916; chirality in the rare trigonal P3&#773;c1 space group, as confirmed by X&#8208;ray crystallography of a racemic single crystal. The extended structure then stacks on itself to form snowflake&#8208;like structures. The electropositive central core was characterized in anion binding and found to be selective for chloride ions.

LMCT&#8208;driven iron photocatalysis: This review discusses recent developments in ligand&#8208;to&#8208;metal charge transfer (LMCT)&#8208;driven iron photocatalysis, emphasizing mechanistic insights and diverse synthetic applications. By classifying Fe(III)&#8211;L bond homolysis pathways, it highlights iron's potential as a sustainable alternative to precious metals for radical&#8208;mediated reactions under mild conditions.








Abstract
Iron&#8208;based photocatalysis has emerged as a sustainable and versatile platform for facilitating a wide range of chemical transformations, offering an appealing alternative to precious metal photocatalysts. Among the various activation modes, ligand&#8208;to&#8208;metal charge transfer (LMCT)&#8208;driven homolysis of Fe(III)&#8211;L(ligand) bonds has garnered considerable attention due to its ability to generate reactive radical species under mild conditions, without requiring the matching of substrates&#8217; redox potentials. In this review, we present a comprehensive overview of recent developments in LMCT&#8208;driven iron photocatalysis, with a particular focus on both mechanistic insights and synthetic applications published in the last five years. We classify Fe(III)&#8211;L homolysis into four major categories based on the nature of the coordinated ligand: halides, carboxylates, alkoxides, and azide. For a few cases, mechanistic understanding derived from spectroscopic studies, computational modeling, and kinetic investigations is discussed in more detail. We further highlight the expanding repertoire of synthetic transformations enabled by LMCT&#8208;driven iron photocatalysis, including C&#9472;H functionalization, alkene functionalization, cross&#8208;coupling, oxidation, and radical&#8208;mediated bond formation. Finally, we provide future perspectives on the continued development of LMCT&#8208;based iron photocatalysis as a broadly applicable platform for sustainable organic synthesis. This review aims to serve as a valuable resource for researchers interested in leveraging the full potential of LMCT&#8208;mediated iron photocatalysis in modern organic chemistry.

This review aims to serve as a valuable resource for researchers interested in leveraging the full potential of LMCT-mediated iron photocatalysis in modern organic chemistry.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Directing Effects of Silyl and Germyl Groups in Transition&#8208;Metal&#8208;Catalyzed Allylic Substitution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 58, October 16, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Despite the maturity of transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed allylic substitution, unsymmetrical 1,3&#8208;disubstituted electrophiles remain underexplored due to inherent regioselectivity challenges. This Concept highlights the strategic use of silyl and germyl groups to overcome this limitation, steering bond formation with high regiocontrol and serving as linchpins for further molecular diversification.








Abstract
Transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed allylic substitution is a well&#8208;established strategy for the formation of carbon&#8211;carbon and carbon&#8211;heteroatom bonds. However, most methods remain incompatible with unsymmetrical 1,3&#8208;disubstituted allylic electrophiles as regioselectivity becomes difficult to control when the substituents are electronically and sterically similar. Achieving simultaneous control over the enantio&#8208; and regioselectivity as well as the alkene geometry poses an even greater challenge. To address this, sterically and electronically influential main&#8208;group elements such as carbon's heavier homologues silicon and germanium have been strategically incorporated. These metalloids can steer the bond formation away from their proximity enabling the formation of a single regioisomer while also serving as versatile linchpins for further functionalization. This Concept summarizes the key advancements made in the field since the discovery of the allylic substitution with a particular focus on silyl&#8208; and germyl&#8208;directed strategies that have expanded the synthetic utility of this highly valuable transformation.

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Doped Copper Oxide Nanorods for Efficient Biomass Electro&#8208;Oxidation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 58, October 16, 2025. </description>

In this work, we have demonstrated that Ni doping improved the activity of HMFOR by optimizing the electronic structure of Cu sites and enhancing the adsorption of HMF. The Ni&#8208;CuOx exhibits a large current density of 199.7 mA cm&#8722;2 at 1.4 V, which is 2.8&#8208;fold higher than that of pure CuOx. Moreover, it achieves a high FDCA yield of 90.1% and a Faraday efficiency of 98.5%.








Abstract
Cu&#8208;based catalysts are regarded as promising materials for the electro&#8208;oxidation of biomass. However, developing effective strategies to improve the intrinsic activity of Cu&#8208;based catalysts is still challenging and rarely reported. Herein, we synthesized a nickel&#8208;doped copper oxide catalyst (Ni&#8208;CuOx) for 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) electro&#8208;oxidation to 2,5&#8208;furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA). The Ni&#8208;CuOx exhibited a large current density of 199.7&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 at 1.4&#160;V, which is 2.8&#8208;fold higher than that of pure CuOx, and exceeds most of the reported Cu&#8208;based catalysts. Moreover, the Ni&#8208;CuOx also showed high FDCA yield (90.1%) and Faradaic efficiency (98.5%). Physical characterizations and electrochemical analyses demonstrated that Ni doping optimizes the electronic structure of Cu sites, and promoting the adsorption of HMF, contributing to enhanced electrocatalytic activity. This work provides insights into the rational design of copper&#8208;based catalysts for biomass electro&#8208;oxidation.

This study develops an eco&#8208;friendly method to enhance the mechanical properties of carbon fiber reinforced composites for structural batteries. Hydrogen peroxide&#8208;based oxidation is optimized by varying concentration, temperature, and time, achieving effective interfacial adhesion without damaging fibers. FTIR, XPS, and SEM confirm functionalization and uniform surface roughness, while tensile tests show &#8764;80% strength improvement under 30 wt% H2O2 at 60 &#176;C for 45 min. The approach reduces environmental impact and supports multifunctional, lightweight composites for electric vehicle and aerospace applications.








Abstract
Batteries and environmental processes are essential for the progress of contemporary technology from two distinct considering a sustainable future. Environmental processes aim for minimizing material and energy usage while regulating systems do not release dangerous gasses. The presented work demonstrates the modification of carbon fiber (CF) to enhance the strength of the outer case of structural batteries, a novel form of battery. Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), an eco&#8208;friendly compound, has been utilized for this purpose. The strength of the carbon fiber enhances with the formation of the interface. The experimental results indicate that carbon fibers treated in a 30&#160;wt.% H2O2 solution at 60 &#176;C for 45 minutes exhibited an 80% enhancement in strength than pristine CF and a 35% improvement relative to the desized CF.

         <title>Cage Amine Superbases: Synthesis and Studies of Nona(ethylene)Hexamine and Dodeka(ethylene)Octamine</title>

The strongest known cage&#8208;amine bases, nona(ethylene)hexamine and dodeka(ethylene)octamine have been prepared and characterized using experimental and theoretical methods.








Abstract
The cage&#8208;amine molecules nona(ethylene)hexamine and dodeka(ethylene)octamine, have been prepared by coupling 1,4,7&#8208;triazacyclononane (tacn) or 1,4,7,10&#8208;tetraazacyclododecane (cyclen) to the corresponding &#945;&#8208;chloroacetamide derivatives of these macrocycles. The formed tri&#8208; or tetra&#8208;amide cryptands were then reduced to the corresponding hexamine and octamine with borane. In all cases, the amide and amine cryptands were isolated as protonated ammonium salts, with the proton oriented to the inside of the cage molecules (i.e., endohedral). Deprotonation studies on the hexamine and octamine showed the encapsulated protons are highly inert, with no evidence of deprotonation or deuterium exchange. Detailed theoretical studies predict very high proton affinity and basicity of 1118.7 and 1086.7&#160;kJ mol&#8722;1, respectively, for dodeka(ethylene)octamine, and 1108.3 and 1083.7&#160;kJ mol&#8722;1, respectively, for nona(ethylene)hexamine, placing them among the strongest amine bases ever prepared and firmly within the realm of &#8220;superbases&#8221;.

         <title>Reactivity of a Substituted Aryloxenium Cation with a Triplet Ground State</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 58, October 16, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A substituted aryloxenium cation with a triplet electronic ground state is not a strong electrophile like the analogous singlet aryloxenium cations. It undergoes only radical reactions that are remarkably fast for a delocalized &#960;&#8208;type biradical.








Abstract
Aryloxenium cations contain a formally positively charged, monovalent oxygen atom. In spite of this unusual structural element, they are key intermediates in many important processes, such as biological oxidation reactions and the industrial generation of thermoplastics. However, the development of new applications is hindered by the lack of knowledge on their fundamental chemical properties. While most past studies have focused on aryloxenium cations with singlet electronic ground states, minor structural modifications can produce aryloxenium cations that have a triplet ground state. Unfortunately, examination of the reactivity of triplet aryloxenium cations is limited to just two studies that reported the detection of H atom abstraction from solvents by the same cation. A detailed kinetic reactivity study involving cyclohexane, allyl iodide, and dimethyl disulfide reagents is reported here for a substituted aryloxenium cation with a triplet electronic ground state, the 2&#8208;amino&#8208;4&#8208;pyridyloxenium cation.

     alt="Reactivity of a Substituted Aryloxenium Cation with a Triplet Ground State"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A substituted aryloxenium cation with a triplet electronic ground state is not a strong electrophile like the analogous singlet aryloxenium cations. It undergoes only radical reactions that are remarkably fast for a delocalized &#960;-type biradical.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aryloxenium cations contain a formally positively charged, monovalent oxygen atom. In spite of this unusual structural element, they are key intermediates in many important processes, such as biological oxidation reactions and the industrial generation of thermoplastics. However, the development of new applications is hindered by the lack of knowledge on their fundamental chemical properties. While most past studies have focused on aryloxenium cations with &lt;i&gt;singlet&lt;/i&gt; electronic ground states, minor structural modifications can produce aryloxenium cations that have a &lt;i&gt;triplet&lt;/i&gt; ground state. Unfortunately, examination of the reactivity of triplet aryloxenium cations is limited to just two studies that reported the detection of H atom abstraction from solvents by the same cation. A detailed kinetic reactivity study involving cyclohexane, allyl iodide, and dimethyl disulfide reagents is reported here for a substituted aryloxenium cation with a triplet electronic ground state, the 2-amino-4-pyridyloxenium cation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Injectable Hyaluronic Acid Hydrogel Integrated with Hybrid Nanovesicles for Synergistic Enhancement of Transdermal Drug Delivery</title>

A versatile Hybrid&#8208;Gel platform combining CoQ10&#8208;loaded hybrid nanovesicles with an injectable, pH&#8208;responsive hydrogel network significantly enhances transdermal drug delivery efficiency, offering a robust strategy for localized therapy.








Abstract
Plant&#8208;derived nanovesicles offer promising potential for transdermal drug delivery due to their inherent biocompatibility and low immunogenicity, yet face limitations in drug loading, structural stability, and functional optimization. This study presents a versatile Hybrid&#8208;Gel platform that integrates CoQ10&#8208;loaded hybrid vesicles with an injectable, pH&#8208;responsive hydrogel to enhance localized drug delivery. High&#8208;purity nanovesicles are isolated using an optimized ultracentrifugation (UC) and size&#8208;exclusion chromatography (SEC) method, then hybridized with liposomes to improve encapsulation and skin penetration. To further optimize localized delivery performance, an injectable binary hydrogel system is then introduced. This hydrogel, formed via Schiff base crosslinking between hyperbranched polyethylene glycol and aldehyde&#8208;modified hyaluronic acid (A&#8208;HA), exhibits mild gelation conditions, excellent injectability, and strong tissue adhesion. The hydrogel effectively encapsulates hybrid nanovesicles, ensuring enhanced stability, ease of administration, and controlled, pH&#8208;responsive release. As a proof of concept, an in vitro permeation test with porcine skin model demonstrates that the hydrogel significantly improves CoQ10 penetration, achieving a more than fourfold increase in transdermal efficiency compared to free CoQ10, suggesting superior bioavailability. This synergistic approach, combining hybrid nanovesicle&#8208;mediated drug transport with a dynamic hydrogel matrix, offers a robust and versatile platform for localized transdermal therapy, with potential applications in precision medicine, regenerative treatments, and chronic disease management.

Syneresis behavior of an amino acid (Fmoc&#8208;hPhe&#8208;OH, hF)&#8208;based bioactive hydrogel has been portrayed with the potential for purifying industrial wastewater through a sustainable and green platform.








Abstract
This study investigates the unique syneresis (self&#8208;shrinking) behavior of N&#8208;Terminally Fmoc&#8208;protected amino acid, Fmoc&#8208;hPhe&#8208;OH (Fmoc&#8208;homo&#8208;L&#8208;phenylalanine, abbreviated in this work as hF)&#8208;based hydrogel, and its potential in environmental remediation applications. Fmoc&#8208;hPhe&#8208;OH (hF) forms a hydrogel in 50&#160;mM phosphate buffer (PB) of pH 7.4. Interestingly, hF&#8208;based hydrogel shows syneresis behavior with controlled release of residual water from the hydrogel matrix. Moreover, this hydrogelator can form co&#8208;assembled hydrogels with various dyes, including Congo Red and Rhodamine B; natural water samples, including natural mud water and sea water; and heavy metal ions aqueous solutions, including CdII, PbII, and HgII separately in 50&#160;mM PB of pH 7.4. Interestingly, after 2 to 3 hours for shake gel and 5&#8211;6 hours for nonshake gel, the released waters have been tested and it has been found that these co&#8208;assembled hydrogels are capable of retaining almost all the contaminants within the shrink hydrogels matrix and releasing almost pure water along with the presence of hydrogel nanofibers. Syneresis is augmented to purify the contaminated water with dyes, mud, dissolved salts, and toxic heavy metal ions. These co&#8208;assembled hydrogels, leading to distinct structural and functional changes, which have been characterized by using Fourier&#8208;Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR), X&#8208;ray Diffraction (XRD), and Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy (FE&#8208;SEM), suggesting various supramolecular interactions including &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking, hydrogen bonding, and electrostatic interactions are responsible for stable hydrogelations. The rheological study evaluates the hydrogel's mechanical and thixotropic properties and spectroscopic techniques, including UV&#8208;visible spectroscopy and fluorescence spectroscopy, to monitor structural transition. This novel class of amino acid&#8208;based hydrogel shows antibacterial activity against both Gram&#8208;positive and Gram&#8208;negative bacteria, likely through membrane&#8208;disruptive mechanisms, and also shows promising antioxidant properties. The native hF hydrogel is biocompatible and shows anticancer activity toward the pancreatic cancer cell line. The research finding bestows the biomedically relevant hydrogel's potential use in green and sustainable environmental remediation.

Cooperativity wins: Judiciously designed heterobimetallic conjugates of Ru(II) and Fe(II) metal centers have shown remarkable redox cooperativity to achieve living and well&#8208;defined acrylate polymers.








Abstract
Employing heterobimetallic complexes (HBCs) offers an exciting and powerful strategy for various catalytic applications. Here, we present an unorthodox synthetic route to synthesize a novel RuII&#8208;FeII heterobimetallic complex by implementing the strategy of &#8220;metalation with functionalization.&#8221; This complex utilizes a redox&#8208;assisted concerted strategy to facilitate the controlled radical polymerization (CRP) of acrylate monomers with significantly low catalyst loading. To understand the efficiency of the bimetallic catalyst over the other corresponding monometallic complexes, controlled polymerization experiments on acrylate monomers have been carried out. The redox cooperativity for efficient living CRP is very much pronounced and established in the RuII&#8208;FeII heterobimetallic dyad as evidenced by multiple orthogonal experimental results and the interesting rearrangement in the frontier molecular orbitals during catalysis steps. A plausible mechanistic pathway is proposed based on insights from electroparamagnetic resonance spectroscopy, cyclic voltametry, UV&#8208;Vis spectroscopy, rigid potential energy scans (PES), and the Fukui function. A modified atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) mechanism is offered by RuII&#8208;FeII conjugate, where redox&#8208;cooperativity and intramolecular electron transfer (IET) between the metal centers play a crucial role. This study investigates the potential of redox cooperativity in heterobimetallic systems, highlighting their efficacy as adaptable catalytic platforms.

The first example of a thorium trimer 3:3 with &#916;,&#916;,&#916;&#8208;chirality and a pore in the center for anion binding.








Abstract
Bis&#8208;salophen ligands are the condensation product of a tetramine and a salicylaldehyde derivative. They feature two binding sites, both of which are tetradentate with mixed O/N donor atoms. Reaction with the ligand precursor and thorium nitrate tetrahydrate forms a 3:3 metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand trimer with a &#916;&#916;&#916;&#8208;chirality confirmed by X&#8208;ray crystallography of a racemic single crystal. The structure has a pore in the center of the triangular structure measuring 6.22&#160;&#197; at its narrowest point. This compound is air&#8208; and water&#8208;stable as well as soluble in organic solvents. This compound was screened with a series of tetrabutyl ammonium halide salts, and tetrabutylammonium (TBA) chloride showed the strongest binding to the complex. After the addition of 2 equivalents of TBACl, the complex and salt precipitate out of solution.

This compound was screened with a series of tetrabutyl ammonium halide salts, and tetrabutylammonium (TBA) chloride showed the strongest binding to the complex. After the addition of 2 equivalents of TBACl, the complex and salt precipitate out of solution.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>High Shear Conversion of Elemental Bismuth in Water Under Air to 2D Bismuth Oxycarbonate</title>

Powdered elemental bismuth in water forms 2D bismuth oxycarbonate nanosheets under high shear in a rapidly rotating tube housed in a vortex fluidic device, without the need of surfactants or other excipients, with uptake of atmospheric carbon dioxide.








Abstract
2D Bismuth oxycarbonate (2D BOC) nanosheets have a unique layered structure with many applications, including capture and reduction of carbon dioxide. Processing powdered elemental bismuth in water under ambient air conditions using a vortex fluidic device (VFD) results in the formation of 2D BOC without the need of surfactants or other excipients. The induced high shear mechanical energy in the form of micron/submicron topological typhoon like spinning top (ST) fluid flow drives the conversion, which we propose initially melts the metal particles which are spontaneously oxidised at the liquid&#8208;quartz tube interface to form 2D bismuth oxide (Bi2O3). Then it reacts with atmospheric CO2 to form 2D BOC. These sheets, &#8804; 15.7&#160;nm thick, are in the orthorhombic phase with a lattice spacing of 0.29&#160;nm, which is converted to Bi2O3 monoclinic phase as an exothermic process at 269 &#176;C.

         <title>Photoswitchable Pseudorotaxanes with Dual Chromism and Tunable Fluorescence for Multilevel Information Encryption</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 58, October 16, 2025. </description>

Two photoswitchable pseudorotaxanes were constructed through supramolecular host&#8208;guest interactions, exhibiting distinct photochromic, vapochromic, and fluorescent properties in the solid state, which enables their application in multilevel information encryption systems.








Abstract
The design and construction of mechanically interlocked molecules (MIMs) displaying distinct physical/chemical properties under different states is highly desirable due to their multifunctional applications. Herein, we report a photoswitchable pseudorotaxane system constructed through host&#160;&#8722;&#160;guest interactions between a vinyl&#8208;bipyridinium axle and cucurbit[7]uril (Q[7]) macrocycle. Upon light irradiation, the [3]pseudorotaxane E&#8208;G2+@Q[7]2 in aqueous solution undergoes E&#8594;Z photoisomerization, converting to the [2]pseudorotaxane Z&#8208;G2+@Q[7], where Q[7] selectively encircles the central Z&#8208;vinyl&#8208;bipyridinium unit. Notably, E&#8208;G2+@Q[7]2 displays dual photochromic and vapochromic (NH3) activity, whereas Z&#8208;G2+@Q[7] is optically and vapor&#8208;responsively inert. Additionally, both E&#8208;G2+@Q[7]2 and Z&#8208;G2+@Q[7] exhibit distinct solid&#8208;state fluorescence emissions due to macrocyclic confinement effects. By leveraging these stimuli&#8208;responsive properties, we developed a multilevel information encryption system with three decryption states controlled by wavelength&#8208;specific irradiation (365&#160;nm, 430&#160;nm, or xenon lamp), enabling programmable message display via fluorescence and color changes. This work provides a paradigm for designing smart materials with integrated photoswitching, chromic, and fluorescent functionalities for advanced security applications.

         <title>Molecule&#8208;Induced Radical Formation (MIRF) Reaction of Et2BOOEt with Et3B is Key to the Et3B/O2 Radical Initiation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 58, October 16, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Open to air Et3B is a common radical initiator. Contrary to previous suggestions, most initiating Et&#8226; radicals in this system are formed in a molecule&#8208;induced radical formation (MIRF) reaction of Et2BOOEt with Et3B, and not in Et3B autoxidation. This reaction of Et2BOOEt with Et3B could be used as a radical initiator in its own right, providing higher radical flux than Et3B/O2, as demonstrated in several model reactions.








Abstract
Open&#8208;to&#8208;air triethylborane (Et3B) is a well&#8208;known room&#8208;temperature initiator of free radical reactions. Current consensus is that the initiating species in this system are ethyl radicals formed in the triethylborane autoxidation cycle, although some early studies suggested that reactions of the oxidation products can also contribute to the initiation. We report a quantitative mechanistic study which demonstrates that most ethyl radicals in the triethylborane initiator system are not formed in the autoxidation cycle but instead are generated by a Molecule&#8208;Induced Radical Formation (MIRF) reaction between triethylborane and its main oxidation product, ethylperoxyborane Et2BOOEt (secondary initiation). A simplified kinetic model allowed us to predict optimal conditions for the initiation, and propose the MIRF reaction as an alternative, homogeneous initiator system. The high efficiency of this initiator has been demonstrated in several model radical reactions.

         <title>Spatially Resolved 2D Laser Writing on Graphene Using Diazonium Salts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 58, October 16, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A comprehensive investigation of laser&#8208;induced covalent patterning, defunctionalization, and refunctionalization of single&#8208;layer graphene with aryl diazonium salts is reported. Scanning Raman microscopy verifies spatial control, while systematic variation of laser parameters and substituent effects highlights the versatility of the method. The demonstrated &#8220;write&#8208;erase&#8208;rewrite&#8221; capability establishes a robust platform for micrometer&#8208;scale fabrication of complex, functionalized graphene architectures.








Abstract
We present the first investigation of precise laser&#8208;guided patterning, functionalization, defunctionalization, and refunctionalization of single&#8208;layer graphene (SLG) with three different aryl diazonium salts. Using scanning Raman microscopy (SRM) we confirmed the spatially resolved nature of the functionalization. We systematically investigated the influence of key laser parameters (power, irradiation time, and wavelength) and the electronic effects of the substituents on both the functionalization efficiency and integrity of graphene. Our solid&#8208;phase approach unequivocally demonstrates that laser&#8208;triggered covalent attachment can achieve high functionalization levels comparable to solution&#8208;based methods. We also unveil a novel laser&#8208;induced defunctionalization pathway at high laser powers and prolonged irradiation times, which allows for the precise, patterned functional group &#8220;erasure&#8221; &#8211; a significant advantage over nonselective thermal annealing. Furthermore, we successfully demonstrate the successful readdressing and refunctionalization of these laser &#8220;erased&#8221; areas, enabling a complete &#8220;write&#8208;erase&#8208;rewrite&#8221; cycle. This work establishes a robust and highly adaptable platform for creating complex, mixed&#8208;functionalized graphene architectures with micrometer precision.

         <title>Nitrogen Donor Ligand (&#945;&#8208;Diamine vs. &#945;&#8208;Diimine) Makes Big Differences in Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Ethylene (Co)Polymerization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of &#945;&#8208;diamine palladium complexes with two sp3 hybridized N donors has been synthesized and characterized. In comparision to classic &#945;&#8208;diimine palladium analogues, the variation from imine donor to amine donor makes big differences in complex configuration and catalytic properties toward ethylene (co)polymerization.








Abstract
The nitrogen donor atom is widely used in the design and synthesis of olefin polymerization catalysts, while the amine donor featured sp3 hybridized N is less applied in the ligand design than the imine donor featured sp2 hybridized N. We have herein reported the synthesis and characterization of &#945;&#8208;diamine palladium complexes with two sp3 hybridized N donors and their catalytic properties toward homopolymerization of ethylene and copolymerization of ethylene with methyl acrylate (MA). The X&#8208;ray crystallographic analyses identify that the &#945;&#8208;diamine palladium complexes have a significantly distorted chelate ring (N&#9472;C&#9472;C&#9472;N&#9472;Pd), which is distinct from conventional &#945;&#8208;diimine palladium complexes with a planar chelate ring. Ethylene polymerization results elucidate that bulky steric hindrance of the &#945;&#8208;diamine palladium catalyst is required to achieve high activity and high molecular weight polymer. Comparisons of ethylene (co)polymerization results between the &#945;&#8208;diamine palladium catalyst and the classic &#945;&#8208;diimine palladium analogue disclose that the variation from imine donor to amine donor makes a decreasing change in catalytic activity and polymer molecular weight but an increase in the degree of linearity of polymeric product and MA incorporation in EMA copolymer.

         <title>Pharmaceuticals Made with Hydrogen: A Sustainable and Efficient Approach Using Flow Synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We demonstrate a sustainable strategy for pharmaceutical manufacturing by combining hydrogen, heterogeneous catalysis, and continuous flow synthesis. The development of novel catalysts and their application in a multi&#8208;step synthesis of donepezil enabled a highly productive process with no intermediate purification. This work establishes a new, greener pathway for a hydrogen&#8208;powered, carbon&#8208;neutral future.








Abstract
Conventional pharmaceutical manufacturing relies on fossil fuels and inefficient batch processes, creating significant waste. This review presents a strategy using hydrogen, heterogeneous catalysts, and continuous&#8208;flow synthesis for a more sustainable and efficient approach to pharmaceutical manufacturing. We detail two key innovations: first, highly efficient catalysts (Pt/C and polysilane&#8208;modified Pd) for atom&#8208;economical C&#9472;N bond formation. Our flow systems offered superior performance and broad functional group tolerance. Second, we developed a robust polysilane&#8208;immobilized Rh&#8208;Pt bimetallic catalyst for selective arene hydrogenation under mild conditions. We successfully integrated these technologies into a seamless, multi&#8208;step continuous&#8208;flow synthesis of donepezil. By successfully integrating these technologies and overcoming challenges like catalyst inhibition, this work demonstrates a highly productive and sustainable process. This approach represents a significant step toward a greener, hydrogen&#8208;powered future for chemical manufacturing.

         <dc:description>
In this study, chiral spiro[furo[2,3&#8208;d]pyrimidines] are synthesized by integrating two biologically active heterocyclic scaffolds, furo[2,3&#8208;d]pyrimidines and oxindoles, in a single molecule in the presence of quinine&#8208;derived squaramide through Cascade Michael&#8208;Cyclopropanation&#8208;Rearrangement. Structurally diverse spiro[furo[2,3&#8208;d]pyrimidines] with excellent yield and selectivity demonstrating the efficacy and versatility of the protocol. 1H NMR and HRMS titrations support the proposed mechanism.








Abstract
An unprecedented organocatalytic enantioselective methodology has been unlocked to access oxindole&#8208;fused spiro[furo[2,3&#8208;d]pyrimidines] with high bond efficiency (two new C&#8208;C bonds and one C&#8208;O bond) and two contiguous stereocenters via Cascade Michael&#8208;Cyclopropanation&#8208;Rearrangement. A series of spiro[furo[2,3&#8208;d]pyrimidines] has been synthesized in excellent yield (up to 90%) and stereoselectivity (dr up to 99:1, er up to 97:3) from 3&#8208;chlorooxindoles and 5&#8208;alkylidene barbituric acids at room temperature. 1H NMR and HRMS studies have been conducted to define the reaction pathway.

         <title>Total Synthesis and Analysis of Phenolic Phytoprostanes, Oxidized Derivatives of Lipophenols</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The total synthesis of four hydroxytyrosol&#8208;phytoprostanes (PhytoPs&#8208;HT) was achieved in 20 steps, enabling their first identification as HT&#8208;&#945;&#8208;linolenate oxidation products. This work revealed new oxidized derivatives of lipophenols via UHPLC&#8208;MS/MS analysis, offering a strategy to trace HT&#8208;derived compounds in complex matrices, aiding food and biomedical research.








Abstract
Lipophenols, or phenolipids, are compounds that combine polyphenols with fatty acids, offering the antioxidant properties of polyphenols alongside the neuroprotective and cardioprotective benefits of omega&#8208;3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs). Hydroxytyrosol (HT)&#8208;based lipophenols have recently been identified in olive oil. Depending on their structure, these compounds were differently affected by storage conditions. While the concentrations of HT&#8208;oleate and HT&#8208;linoleate increase with higher storage temperatures, HT&#8208;&#945;&#8208;linolenate (HT&#8208;ALA) did not follow the same trend. Given the high oxidative susceptibility of &#945;&#8208;linolenic acid (ALA), which leads to oxidation products known as phytoprostanes (PhytoPs), we hypothesize that HT&#8208;ALA may be oxidized into covalently bound PhytoP conjugates of HT (PhytoPs&#8208;HT) under various oxidative conditions, including, for example, suboptimal storage. This study aims to develop the first total synthesis of two series of PhytoPs&#8208;HT as analytical standards to explore the oxidative transformation of HT&#8208;ALA lipophenols into potential oxylipin metabolites. The synthesis of four ALA&#8208;derived PhytoPs&#8208;HT and their identification during in vitro oxidation of HT&#8208;ALA by UHPLC&#8208;HRMS/MS are presented here. These synthetic standards are essential for the reliable identification and quantification of HT&#8208;PhytoPs within complex mixtures of regio&#8208; and stereoisomers generated during oxylipin formation.

         <title>Methyl on the Bridge: 2&#8208;Methyl Propellane as Precursor for 1,3&#8208;Substituted 2&#8208;Methylated Bicyclo[1.1.1]Pentanes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of 2&#8208;methyl propellane and its conversion to various 1,2&#8208; and 1,2,3&#8208;di&#8208; and trisubstituted bicyclopentanes is reported.








Abstract
Bicyclo[1.1.1]pentanes (BCPs) have emerged as isosteric replacements for mono&#8208; and para&#8208;substituted benzene rings in medicinal and materials applications, involving substitution at the BCP bridgehead (1,3&#8208;positions). BCP functionalization at the 2&#8208;position is much less straightforward and currently under intense investigation. Herein, we report a synthetic route to 2&#8208;methyl BCPs allowing for functionalization at the 1,3&#8208;positions, with the novel 2&#8208;methyl[1.1.1]propellane as a key intermediate. Next to an optimization for the synthesis of 2&#8208;Me&#8208;propellane, this work contains an investigation of its reactivity leading to 1,2&#8208;disubstituted and 1,2,3&#8208;trisubstituted BCP derivatives. Compared to nonsubstituted propellane, the synthesis of 2&#8208;methyl propellane was lower&#8208;yielding, and its ring&#8208;opening reactions proceeded in similar or lower yields, with radical&#8208;based reactions generally giving the best results. A preliminary study of selected physicochemical properties was conducted to assess the impact of the introduction of a bridge&#8208;methyl group, showing an expected increase of about 0.5 logP units and featuring lower melting points.

         <title>Narrowband Tetradentate Pt(II) Complexes&#8208;Based Deep&#8208;Blue OLEDs with Low Efficiency Roll&#8208;Off</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Efficient deep&#8208;blue OLEDs using two tetradentate Pt(II) complexes as emitters are fabricated, which exhibit narrow emission spectra with full&#8208;width at half maximum (FWHM) of 25 and 26&#160;nm, respectively, resulting in small CIEy values &lt; 0.15. The OELDs also show low efficiency roll&#8208;off of 8.3% and 8.0% at 1000&#160;cd/m2, respectively.








Abstract
This study designed and synthesized two tetradentate Pt(II) complexes featured with aryl&#8208; modified N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) ligands, PtTJ&#8208;Ph and PtTJ&#8208;bPh, which exhibited narrow emission spectra with full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximum (FWHM) of 19.0 and 19.8&#160;nm in dichloromethane, respectively. They also showed remarkably high photoluminescence quantum yields of 99% and 93%, along with short excited&#8208;state lifetimes of 2.72 &#181;s and 2.34 &#181;s in poly(methyl methacrylate (PMMA) films, respectively. Deep&#8208;blue OLED device using PtTJ&#8208;Ph as emitter exhibited narrowband emission spectrum peaking at 458&#160;nm with a small FWHM value of 25&#160;nm, resulting in a small Commission Internationale de l'&#201;clairage (CIE) y coordinate of 0.138. The device also achieved a maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 22.7%, and maintained an EQE of 20.8% at 1000&#160;cd/m2 with a low efficiency roll&#8208;off of only 8.3%, demonstrating excellent electroluminescent properties for deep&#8208;blue OLED application.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Free Carbon Dots as Photon&#8208;Triggered Pyroptosis Inducers for Enhanced Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This concept article highlights the recent developments in the field of PTP using nonmetallic nanomaterials that have photocatalytic properties and can generate reactive oxygen species (ROS). In addition, it aims to offer a systematic overview of the progression and utilization of nonmetallic carbon dots in PTP, thereby contributing to the renewed comprehension of their applications and potential in cancer immunotherapy.








Abstract
Pyroptosis, a highly immunogenic form of programmed cell death, is characterized by the release of proinflammatory cytokines. Recently, researchers have focused on the use of light to control pyroptosis induction, an approach that holds great promise as being relatively noninvasive and allows for precise spatiotemporal control. Photon&#8208;triggered pyroptosis (PTP) has made great progress in cancer immunotherapy. This concept article highlights the recent developments of metal&#8208;free nanomaterials (especially carbon dots) mediated&#8208;PTP, including the synthetic routes, their photophysical properties and applications in the area of cancer immunotherapy.

The phosphorus compounds bearing a NCN&#8208;type pincer ligand, the 4&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;2,6&#8208;bis(benzimidazol&#8208;2&#8208;yl)benzene ligand (BZIMB), were synthesized and characterized using spectroscopic methods. Compared with the P&#9472;N bond in topologically related compounds bearing an NNN&#8208;type pincer ligand, the robust P&#9472;C bond allows reactions with various reagents, leading to phosphorus compounds in different oxidation states without dissociation of the phosphorus atom.








Abstract
A series of phosphorus compounds bearing the 4&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;2,6&#8208;bis(benzimidazol&#8208;2&#8208;yl)benzene ligand (BZIMB) were prepared and fully characterized using spectroscopic methods, including X&#8208;ray crystallography. Reaction of the PIII compounds with electrophilic reagents led to PV compounds. Reaction with reducing reagents led to PI phosphinidenes. The phosphinidenes react with electrophilic reagents to generate new PIII compounds. In contrast to topologically related compounds featuring labile P&#9472;N bonds, the robust P&#9472;C bond between the phosphorus center and the ligand prevents dissociation of the phosphorus atom during oxidation and reduction, showing the potential for small molecule activation and opening the door for future catalytic studies.

         <title>A General Synthesis Approach to Double&#8208;Guanidinium Stapled Peptides and Foldamers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Our previous guanidinium stapling strategy has been extended to the generation of bis&#8208;guanidinium stapled peptides and foldamers. This rapid and efficient approach, developed on solid&#8208;support, allows for easy modulation of the ring size and the nature of the linker to reach high affinity hDM2 binders.








Abstract
In the broader context of peptide macrocyclization, methods enabling the formation of specific crosslinks between orthogonally protected, amino&#8208;functionalized side chains (e.g., Lys&#8211;Lys crosslinks) are of potential interest for expanding molecular diversity and stabilizing peptide secondary structures. We recently introduced a solid&#8208;phase synthesis approach for the rapid generation of guanidinium stapled helical peptides and have shown their utility for inhibition of protein&#8211;protein interactions. Whereas our previous work concentrated on the formation of mono&#8208;guanidinium crosslinks, we show here that we can expand this approach to prepare bis&#8208;guanidinium stapled peptides and foldamers on&#8208;resin. The methodology similarly uses two orthogonally protected amino&#8208;functionalized side chains and features the use of a diamino connector. The two guanidinium groups are introduced sequentially, the first one intermolecularly and the second intramolecularly. The method is compatible with the i,i&#160;+&#160;4 and i,i&#160;+&#160;7 cyclization schemes and tolerates a diversity of diamino linkers. We applied the strategy to the synthesis of macrocyclic inhibitors of hDM2 and hDMX and identified several high affinity binders for the two proteins.

         <title>T&#189; Tuning in a Synergistic BODIPY&#8208;Tetrazole Fe(II) Spin&#8208;Crossover&#8208;Photoluminescence System via Co&#8208;Ligand Variation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a modular spin crossover&#8208;photoluminescence (SCO&#8208;PL) system: heteroleptic, mononuclear Fe(II) coordination compounds bearing equatorial BODIPY fluorophores that exhibit synergistic PL response upon spin state switching. Exchanging apical nitrile co&#8208;ligands tunes electronic and structural properties, giving precise control over the SCO and PL response. This versatile SCO&#8208;PL platform offers bifunctional behavior for photonic applications.








Abstract
Bifunctional materials combining spin crossover (SCO) and photoluminescence (PL), offering noncontact and highly sensitive spin&#8208;state detection, are promising candidates for application in photonic devices. However, independently tuning the SCO and PL properties to achieve synergistic SCO&#8208;PL behavior remains challenging. Herein, we present a series of heteroleptic Fe(II) coordination compounds with the general formula [Fe(L)4(RCN)2](ClO4)2&#8226;nRCN, bearing four BODIPY&#8208;derived fluorophores L (L&#160;=&#160;4,4&#8208;difluoro&#8208;1,3,5,7&#8208;tetramethyl&#8208;8&#8208;[(1H&#8208;tetrazol&#8208;1&#8208;yl)methyl]&#8208;4&#8208;bora&#8208;3a,4a&#8208;diaza&#8208;s&#8208;indacene) in the equatorial positions and variable RCN co&#8208;ligands (CH3CH2CN, CH2CHCN, CH3(CH2)2CN, PhCN) in the apical positions. The systematic variation of the co&#8208;ligand modulates steric and/or electronic effects, thereby influencing the SCO behavior without perturbing the PL characteristics. Magnetic susceptibility measurements revealed T1/2 =&#160;220&#160;K and 270&#160;K for R&#160;=&#160;CH3CH2 and R&#160;=&#160;CH2CH, respectively, indicating that electronic effects modulate T1/2. Conversely, for R&#160;=&#160;Ph and R&#160;=&#160;CH3(CH2)2 the SCO capability is progressively lost, with the latter showing no spin&#8208;switching at all. Temperature&#8208;dependent PL studies display an increase in emission upon the SCO, most pronounced for [Fe(L)4(CH3CH2CN)2](ClO4)2&#8226;2CH3CH2CN, which can be attributed to electronic coupling between the SCO center and the fluorophore. This work establishes a single&#8208;molecule SCO&#8208;PL platform, in which the SCO behavior can be tuned independently from the PL response, paving the way for tailored molecular sensors and optical switches.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bifunctional materials combining spin crossover (SCO) and photoluminescence (PL), offering noncontact and highly sensitive spin-state detection, are promising candidates for application in photonic devices. However, independently tuning the SCO and PL properties to achieve synergistic SCO-PL behavior remains challenging. Herein, we present a series of heteroleptic Fe(II) coordination compounds with the general formula [Fe(&lt;b&gt;L&lt;/b&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;(&lt;b&gt;R&lt;/b&gt;CN)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;](ClO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8226;n&lt;b&gt;R&lt;/b&gt;CN, bearing four BODIPY-derived fluorophores &lt;b&gt;L&lt;/b&gt; (&lt;b&gt;L&#160;&lt;/b&gt;=&#160;4,4-difluoro-1,3,5,7-tetramethyl-8-[(1&lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;-tetrazol-1-yl)methyl]-4-bora-3a,4a-diaza-&lt;i&gt;s&lt;/i&gt;-indacene) in the equatorial positions and variable &lt;b&gt;R&lt;/b&gt;CN co-ligands (CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CN, CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CHCN, CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CN, PhCN) in the apical positions. The systematic variation of the co-ligand modulates steric and/or electronic effects, thereby influencing the SCO behavior without perturbing the PL characteristics. Magnetic susceptibility measurements revealed T&lt;sub&gt;1/2&lt;/sub&gt; =&#160;220&#160;K and 270&#160;K for &lt;b&gt;R&#160;&lt;/b&gt;=&#160;CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and &lt;b&gt;R&#160;&lt;/b&gt;=&#160;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH, respectively, indicating that electronic effects modulate T&lt;sub&gt;1/2&lt;/sub&gt;. Conversely, for &lt;b&gt;R&#160;&lt;/b&gt;=&#160;Ph and &lt;b&gt;R&#160;&lt;/b&gt;=&#160;CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; the SCO capability is progressively lost, with the latter showing no spin-switching at all. Temperature-dependent PL studies display an increase in emission upon the SCO, most pronounced for [Fe(&lt;b&gt;L&lt;/b&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;(CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CN)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;](ClO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8226;2CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CN, which can be attributed to electronic coupling between the SCO center and the fluorophore. This work establishes a single-molecule SCO-PL platform, in which the SCO behavior can be tuned independently from the PL response, paving the way for tailored molecular sensors and optical switches.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Proton Conductivities of Stepwise Protonated Imidazole&#8208;Fused Tetraphenylene Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Proton conducting tetraphenylene molecules (ImTP) containing a imidazole group were controlled by the degree of protonation. By controlling the degree of protonation from neutral ImTP to H1ImTP&#8314;, H2ImTP2&#8314;, and H4ImTP&#8308;&#8314;, we demonstrated that the balance between intermolecular hydrogen bonding and electrostatic interactions affects structural stability and proton conductivity.








Abstract
The control of crystal structure and proton conductivity was evaluated by stepwise protonation of tetraphenylene molecules (ImTP) containing a imidazole group. By controlling the degree of protonation from neutral ImTP to H1ImTP&#8314;, H2ImTP2&#8314;, and H4ImTP&#8308;&#8314;, we demonstrated that the balance between intermolecular hydrogen bonding and electrostatic interactions affects structural stability and proton conductivity. X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis revealed that neutral ImTP forms a 2D hydrogen bond network, while H1ImTP&#8314; exhibits enhanced structural stability due to N&#9472;H&#8314;&#183;&#183;&#183;Cl&#8722; electrostatic interactions. H2ImTP2&#8314; forms a 3D network, and H4ImTP&#8308;&#8314; becomes amorphous. Under 40% relative humidity conditions, these compounds adsorb H2O to form proton conduction pathways, exhibiting conductivities of 3.20&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;7, 3.38&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;6, 1.35&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;6, and 6.20&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;6 S cm&#8722;1 at &#8764;363&#160;K for n&#160;=&#160;0, 1, 2, and 4 of HnImTPn&#8314;Cl&#8722;n system, respectively. In particular, H1ImTP&#8314; exhibits an optimal balance between hydrogen bonding and electrostatic interactions, resulting in high structural stability, reversible H2O adsorption, and proton conductivity.

         <title>Unique Phase Evolution and Multielemental Effects in Natural Rhodochrosite for Methane Oxidation</title>

Natural rhodochrosite as a catalyst with unique activity in methane oxidation.








Abstract
Rhodochrosite, a naturally occurring MnCO3${\rm MnCO}_3$&#8208;based mineral with inherent compositional complexity, is investigated as a catalyst for methane oxidation. The material exhibits distinctive catalytic behavior, including enhanced C2${\rm C}_2$ hydrocarbon formation and selective CO production, attributed to its multielemental composition and dynamic phase transformations under reaction conditions. In particular, rhodochrosite suppresses CO formation while enhancing C2H4${\rm C}_2{\rm H}_4$ production compared to pure MnCO3${\rm MnCO}_3$, the primary component of rhodochrosite. Thermal treatment converts rhodochrosite into mixed manganese oxide phases (Mn2O3${\rm Mn}_2{\rm O}_3$, Mn3O4${\rm Mn}_3{\rm O}_4$), while trace elements and mineral impurities are retained and may influence oxide phase evolution and catalytic behavior. These findings highlight the potential of natural multicomponent minerals as compositionally diverse, phase&#8208;adaptive platforms for selective methane&#160;conversion.

         <title>Substituent Effects on Sulfur Phenolate Exchange Reactions: Reactivity and Bonding Analysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Orbital interactions, and to smaller effect: solvent effects, dominate over Pauli repulsions to determine the success of the SuPhenEx click reaction.








Abstract
The Sulfur Phenolate Exchange reaction (SuPhenEx) provides a fluorine&#8208;free alternative S(VI) exchange chemistry by substituting nitrophenolate as the leaving group instead of fluoride (as in SuFEx reactions), offering a synthetically appealing and environmentally friendly approach in click chemistry. Despite its significance, the reaction mechanism and the underlying electronic interactions in the course of the reaction have yet to be thoroughly explored at the molecular level. Here, we elucidate the electronic interactions of a series of SuPhenEx model reactions between various para&#8208;substituted phenolates (p&#8208;R&#8208;Ph&#8208;O&#8211;) as nucleophiles and PhSO2&#8208;OPh&#8211;p&#8208;NO2 as an electrophile, in both gas and solvent (acetonitrile) phases. As tools, we apply the Activation Strain Model based on density functional theory. We identified the HOMO&#8211;LUMO interaction as the key determinant of reactivity in the gas phase, which shifts to include (HOMO&#8208;1)&#8211;(LUMO&#160;+&#160;1) contributions in the solvent phase, and showed how these interactions can be tuned through the choice of the substituent in the para&#8208;substituted phenolate nucleophiles. The resulting insights, consistent across both phases, facilitate steering future experiments in these and related S(VI) substitution reactions.

         <title>Hybridization on DNA&#8208;Coated Ultrasmall Gold Nanoparticles (2&#160;nm)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
DNA&#8208;conjugated ultrasmall gold nanoparticles (2&#160;nm) hybridize with complementary DNA strands to form dimers. Covalent attachment via click chemistry preserves the DNA functionality, creating building blocks for supramolecular chemistry and controlled nanoparticle assembly.








Abstract
Ultrasmall gold nanoparticles were functionalized with covalently attached DNA strands of 20 or 30 nucleotides. This was achieved via click chemistry with alkyne&#8208;terminated DNA and azide&#8208;terminated gold nanoparticles. The particles were characterized by high&#8208;resolution transmission electron microscopy, UV&#8208;Vis spectroscopy, fluorescence spectroscopy, and small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering. The DNA strands were fluorescently labelled with either FAM or Cy3, permitting their detection and quantification on the nanoparticle surface. Complementary DNA strands were attached to the nanoparticles via hybridization. The connection of gold nanoparticles by complementary DNA strands was also demonstrated. In&#8208;situ fluorescence spectroscopy confirmed the hybridization at ambient temperature and the melting of the DNA strands at elevated temperature. The hybridization was confirmed by fluorescence spectroscopy with the FRET effect. This opens broad possibilities for the noncovalent functionalization of ultrasmall nanoparticles.

In-situ fluorescence spectroscopy confirmed the hybridization at ambient temperature and the melting of the DNA strands at elevated temperature. The hybridization was confirmed by fluorescence spectroscopy with the FRET effect. This opens broad possibilities for the noncovalent functionalization of ultrasmall nanoparticles.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Metal Chloride&#8208;Iodate Nonlinear Optical Materials via Direct Chlorination of Centrosymmetric Metal Iodate Crystals</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new simple method that structural directing agents anion could effectively regulate the orientation of polar basic building units to achieve centrosymmetric to noncentrosymmetric transformation is presented. The resultant three excellent NLO crystals of crystals RbAl(IO3)3Cl, CsAl(IO3)3Cl, and CsGa(IO3)3Cl were discovered.








Abstract
Noncentrosymmetric (NCS) crystals may show many interesting and important physical properties and wide applications in science and technology but they are rare in contrast to centrosymmetric crystals. The development of NCS crystals from known centrosymmetric (CS) crystals is of fundamental and applied importance. Herein, a simple and effective strategy that by addition of appropriate diluted HCl into CS crystals to react directly was proposed for the reversal of the CS to NCS structure by utilizing the structural directing agents Cl&#8722; anion to break the symmetry and then to regulate orientation and arrangement of anionic moieties. The resultant a family of NCS iodates AM(IO3)3Cl (A&#160;=&#160;Rb, Cs; M&#160;=&#160;Al, Ga, Fe) were successfully developed via Cl&#8722; anion&#8208; induced transformation from parent CS A2M(IO3)4(H0.5IO3)2 and Cs2Fe(HIO3)(IO3)5. Remarkably, Al&#8208; and Ga&#8208;based compounds RbAl(IO3)3Cl, CsAl(IO3)3Cl, and CsGa(IO3)3Cl exhibit the strong second harmonic generation (SHG) responses (11.0&#8211;12.5&#160;&#215;&#160;KDP), large band&#8211;gaps (4.00&#8211;4.17&#160;eV), high laser damage thresholds (LDTs), wide transparent wavelength regions, and easiness of growing up large crystal. This work provides a new perspective to develop important NCS crystals from CS crystals.

         <title>Mechanisms of Chiral Induction to Foldamer Backbones</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Helical foldamers are often built from achiral components and thus have no inherent bias to their twist sense. This review describes mechanisms for controlling their handedness using appended stereocenters. It examines how point chirality directs the twist sense through a combination of short&#8208;range interactions to the directly attached repeat unit and long&#8208;range interactions with groups farther along the backbone.








Abstract
Foldamers, oligomers that adopt well&#8208;defined conformations, represent an efficient strategy toward nanoscale structural complexity. While most foldamers fold into helices, many abiotic foldamers are built from achiral repeat units and therefore do not have a preferred twist sense. Their handedness can, however, be controlled by attaching groups with chirality centers to the foldamer backbone. This process allows chiral information from readily available compounds to be amplified into larger&#8208;scale structural asymmetry and translated into functional behavior. This review describes mechanisms whereby the point chirality of chiral &#8220;controller&#8221; groups directs foldamer twist sense. We highlight examples of aromatic oligoamides, oligohydrazides, oligoindoles, oligo(ortho&#8208;phenylenes), oligooxymethylenes, and oligo(aminoisobutyric acids), examining cases where the controller groups are attached at either the helices&#8217; termini or sides. Our emphasis is on applying intuitive concepts from conformational analysis and, where appropriate, computational modeling of small substructures. In each case, we consider first short&#8208;range interactions that orient the controller group relative to its direct point of attachment to the foldamer, and then its long&#8208;range interactions with more&#8208;distant parts of the oligomer. Together, these interactions allow the twist sense to be predicted (or at least rationalized). Understanding these mechanisms should facilitate the design of systems with dynamic control over helicity.

         <title>Syntheses and Reactivity of Yb and Sm Inverse Sandwich Arene Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reactivity of inverse sandwich&#160;lanthanide benzene complexes depends strongly on the metal oxidation states and consequently, the charge on the bridging benzene anion. Whereas the YbII complex reacted as a 2e donor with biphenyl, naphthalene, anthracene and COT, the strongly bound SmIII complex only reacted with anthracene and COT. 








Abstract
Inverse sandwich arene complexes of rare earth metals have gained notable interest due to their unique electronic properties. In these complexes, an arene ligand bridges two metal centres, storing 0, 2, or 4 electrons, which is the basis for unique reactivity. Herein, we report on the reactivity of [(DIPePBDI)Ln]2(&#951;6,&#951;6&#8208;benzene) (II&#8208;Ln, Ln&#160;=&#160;Yb or Sm) and in situ reduced [(DIPePBDI)SmI]2 (V) (DIPePBDI&#160;=&#160;HC[C(Me)N&#8208;DIPeP]2, DIPeP&#160;=&#160;2,6&#8208;CHEt2&#8208;phenyl). The YbII&#8208;benzene2&#8722;&#8208;YbII complex (II&#8208;Yb) reacted smoothly with biphenyl, naphthalene, anthracene, and COT, giving a range of new YbII complexes with bridging arene or COT ligands. However, due to much stronger Sm&#8208;arene bonding in II&#8208;Sm, which should be regarded as a SmIII&#8208;benzene4&#8722;&#8208;SmIII complex, this reagent only reacted with substrates that can be reduced easily (anthracene and COT). Interestingly, reaction with anthracene gave a SmII&#8208;anthracene2&#8722;&#8208;SmII complex, showing that the benzene4&#8722; is able to reduce SmIII to SmII. In situ reduced [(DIPePBDI)SmI]2 (V) can be considered a (DIPePBDI)SmI synthon, which reacted smoothly with toluene, biphenyl, or 1,3,5&#8208;triphenyl&#8208;benzene and affords a series of SmIII&#8208;arene4&#8722;&#8208;SmIII complexes. However, reaction with pyrene gave an SmII&#8208;pyrene2&#8722;&#8208;SmII product. All complexes have been fully characterized with X&#8208;ray diffraction.

         <title>Pitch&#8208;derived Soft and Hard Carbon Materials for Practical Sodium&#8208;ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review provides a comprehensive overview of pitch&#8208;based soft and hard carbons for sodium&#8208;ion batteries from a practical viewpoint. It covers their preparation, structure, sodium storage mechanisms, and applications, while also discussing critical points such as safety and volumetric energy density. From an industrial perspective, we analyze technical hurdles and propose that combining advanced characterization with artificial intelligence is key to clarifying structure&#8208;property relationships for practical application.








Abstract
Sodium&#8208;ion battery (SIB) shows great potential for large&#8208;scale energy storage, high&#8208;power and low&#8208;temperature supplies. Pitch is a promising precursor for preparing carbon anode materials for SIBs owing to its low cost, high carbon yield, and structural tunability. In this review, the preparation and application of pitch&#8208;derived soft&#8208; and hard&#8208;carbons for SIBs are discussed from a practical perspective. We first introduce the full&#8208;slope sodium storage behavior of soft carbon, mainly focused on the storage mechanism, high&#8208;rate feature, modification strategies, application scenario, and existing challenges. Thereafter, we present the preparation of pitch&#8208;derived hard carbon mainly through pre&#8208;oxidation and carbonization. The crucial influencing factors, including pitch property, pre&#8208;oxidation temperature, holding time, heating rate, atmosphere, and carbonization conditions, as well as the underlying mechanisms, are discussed. From scientific and industrial points of view, we also propose the challenges for application of pitch&#8208;derived carbon materials. Future efforts should be paid on clarifying the sodium storage mechanisms and electrochemical kinetics of carbon, revealing the screening criteria of pitch and the &#8220;preparation&#8208;structure&#8208;performance&#8221; relationships through a combination of experiments, artificial intelligence, and big data techniques. Material design and preparation guidance should be obtained to push forward pitch&#8208;based carbon for practical SIBs.

         <title>Moisture&#8208;enabled Electricity Generation From a Single&#8208;layer Composite CNT&#8208;Polymer Membrane</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work focuses on the development of single&#8208;layer composite membranes containing a hydrophilic polymeric matrix enriched with various types of carbon nanotubes (single&#8208;, double&#8208;, and multi&#8208;walled CNTs), through an environmentally benign process. The membranes hold potential as low&#8208;budget and self&#8208;sustaining energy systems in the field of moisture&#8208;enabled electricity generators (MEGs).








Abstract
Clean and renewable power sources are crucial toward the development of sustainable energy technologies, to address the global energy demand. Moisture&#8208;enabled electricity generators (MEGs) have emerged as promising candidates to harness ambient low&#8208;grade energy stored in the humidity of the atmosphere. In this study, single&#8208;layer composite membranes were developed, consisting of a hydrophilic cross&#8208;linked polymeric matrix of sodium poly(4&#8208;styrene sulfonate&#8208;co&#8208;glycidyl methacrylate) (P(SSNa&#8208;co&#8208;GMA)) and polyacrylic acid (PAA), and incorporating various types of carbon nanotubes (single&#8208;, double&#8208;, and multi&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes). These composite membranes can spontaneously absorb humidity and display mixed conductivity in a range of relative humidity (RH) environments. The combination of high swelling capacity, hydrophilic surface, and interconnected nanoscale pathways facilitates the formation of a strong ion concentration gradient under humid conditions, leading to higher and more stable voltage output. For example, MEGs based on MWCNTs reaches &#8764;0.65&#160;V. These findings indicate the importance of fine&#8208;tuned morphology and nanotube dispersion in designing efficient MEG devices, as low&#8208;cost and self&#8208;sustaining energy systems.

         <title>Biodegradation of Benzene&#8208;Dicarboxylic Acid Ester Isomers by a Thermally Activated Esterase from Desulfurellaceae Bacterium</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The newly identified esterase DeEst catalyzes the hydrolysis of three regioisomers of benzene&#8208;dicarboxylic acid esters. In particular, phthalic acid esters (PAEs) can be converted into phthalic acid (PA). DeEst exhibits thermostability and an uncommon thermal activation effect.








Abstract
Esterases play a crucial role in the degradation of phthalic acid esters (PAEs), the common persistent organic pollutants and endocrine disrupting chemicals. However, only a few esterases for PAEs degradation have been characterized. In this study, a novel esterase from Desulfurellaceae bacterium (DeEst) has been identified. We found its hydrolytic activity toward three regioisomers of benzene&#8208;dicarboxylic acid esters (i.e., diethyl phthalate, diethyl isophthalate, and diethyl terephthalate). Notably, DeEst is capable of hydrolyzing diethyl phthalate and other PAEs to phthalic acid (PA). The biochemical characterization of DeEst was also investigated. DeEst exhibited strong thermal stability and demonstrated an uncommon thermal activation effect, highlighting its considerable potential for practical applications.

The Michael donor and the Michael acceptor are activated via hydrogen bonding interactions within the second&#8208;sphere coordination of europium complexes.








Abstract
The efficient binding of receptors Lk (Lk&#160;=&#160;L5&#8208;L8) to [Eu(hfac)3] (H&#8208;hfac&#160;=&#160;1,1,1,5,5,5&#8208;hexafluoropentane&#8208;2,4&#8208;dione) allows (i) to gather the basic unit&#8208;containing tridentate ligands Lk and the acidic unit&#8208;bearing bidentate hfac&#8722; co&#8208;ligands into a stable single molecular [LkEu(hfac)3] adduct working as a catalyst for Michael C&#9472;C bond formations, (ii) to enhance the acidity of the N&#8208;H units connected to the benzimidazole side arms of the bound ligands L5 and L7, and (iii) to reorganize their geometries into cis&#8208;cis conformation for activating Michael substrates 1 and 2 through H&#8208;bonding interactions on the second&#8208;sphere coordination to provide the target product 3 (up to 92% yield). A maximum enantiomeric excess of 21% could be achieved due to the long distance between the chiral sources and the catalytic sites in the europium complexes. Stepwise distortions from planarity of the terdentate Lk ligands in the yttrium complexes [LkY(hfac)3] (Lk&#160;=&#160;L2, L3, and L5&#8208;L10) can be tuned by addition of specific substituent into the benzimidazole side arms, thus realizing some control over their dual fluorescence and phosphorescence emission properties. All [LkEu(hfac)3] (Lk&#160;=&#160;L2, L3, and L5&#8208;L10) complexes display europium&#8208;centered photoluminescence properties induced by the antenna effect and modulated by the specific design of the light&#8208;harvesting aromatic ligand located in the first coordination sphere.

         <title>Enantioselective Desymmetrization by Chiral Bifunctional H&#8208;Bonding Organocatalysts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enantioselective desymmetrization has emerged as a highly efficient and conceptually elegant strategy for the construction of chiral molecules from readily available prochiral substrates. This review focuses on recent developments in organocatalytic desymmetrization reactions, with particular emphasis on approaches involving bifunctional activation through hydrogen bonding.








Abstract
Enantioselective desymmetrization has emerged as an effective method for generating highly enriched chiral molecules from achiral compounds. In recent years, organocatalysis has played an increasingly prominent role in this field, offering metal&#8208;free and environmentally benign alternatives to traditional asymmetric catalysis. This review focuses on organocatalytic approaches in desymmetrization reactions that utilize bifunctional hydrogen activation of the substrate by a chiral organocatalyst. The most common types of chiral bifunctional organocatalysts include cinchona alkaloids and their derivatives, such as thioureas, sulfonamides, and squaramides. The following text provides an overview of the enantioselective desymmetrization methods that have been described to date for meso&#8208;anhydrides, meso&#8208;diols, amines, small heterocyclic rings, and various carbonyl compound derivatives.

         <title>Tailoring Pore Size in Anionic MOFs Toward Enhanced Selective Adsorption of Organic Dye Pollutants</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The pore size of MOFs can be successfully adjusted by altering the solvent and temperature of the reaction. The adsorption isotherm results of the cationic dye methylene blue show that the maximum adsorption capacity of the optimized MOF increased by approximately 2.45 times.








Abstract
Organic dye pollutants pose a serious threat to ecosystems and human health, whereas there still exist challenges in efficient and selective adsorption of them due to the difficulty in structure tunability of traditional adsorption materials. Based on the tailorable pore structure of anionic metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs), the pore size can be optimized to match the dye molecules through a solvothermal control strategy, thereby achieving efficient adsorption. Herein, the pore size of anionic MOFs was modulated by varying solvents and temperature, facilitating high&#8208;performance selective adsorption of cationic dye via a large&#8208;pore size effect. The optimized MOF (Bio&#8208;MOF&#8208;100) of large pore size achieved a methylene blue adsorption capacity is high to 443.01&#160;mg/g, which is approximately 2.45 times higher than that of the MOF (Bio&#8208;MOF&#8208;1) before pore regulation. Using a mixed matrix membrane (MMM) strategy, the optimized MOF was mixed with polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) to form a membrane. The membrane is not only portable and recyclable, but also inherits the characteristics of MOFs, enabling selective adsorption of cationic dyes. Its maximum adsorption capacity for methylene blue is 141.78&#160;mg/g. These results provide an example for the design and utility of largely&#8208;pore MOFs for targeted pollutants adsorption.

         <title>Low&#8208; Temperature Transformations in Amorphous Silica Bilayers on Ru(0001) After Crystal&#8208;Glass Transition: Closer Look</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work we report on the ring opening of the silica film as studied by fast&#8208;scanning scanning tunneling microscopy together with density functional calculations. The results reveal the influence of the metal support on the transformation energetics.








Abstract
The crystal&#8208;glass transition concerning silicon dioxide has been a topic of intense research. It has been possible to prepare a bilayer silica film on a metal substrate and study the corresponding transition in real space using scanning tunneling microscopy (STM). While the initial trigger of the transition has been identified as a so&#8208;called Stone&#8211;Wales ring&#8208;opening process, which requires rather high energies/temperatures, a question has been, whether there are similar follow&#8208;up processes, which require much less energy and thus rather moderate temperatures. Although observations have been reported using electron microscopy, it remains unclear whether, in this case, the modifications were initiated by the measurement itself. Here, we report on a fast&#8208;scanning STM study, allowing a study in real space and indicating structural transformations at room temperature. The experimental results are supported by demanding density functional calculations, which allow for an understanding of the involved ring structure modifying processes. The calculations also reveal the influence of the metal support on the transformation energetics.

Abstract
Metal&#8208;catalyzed C&#9472;H activation has been linked to amino acids for decades. Peptides and &#945;$\alpha $&#8208;amino acids (&#945;&#8208;AAs) have been used as substrates, directing groups (DGs) and ligands, significantly expanding and broadening the definition of metallo&#8208; and organo&#8208;catalysis. This mini&#8208;review focuses on strategies for &#946;&#8208;arylation of &#945;&#8208;AAs involving Pd(II)&#8208;mediated activation of the &#946;&#8208;C(sp3)&#8208;H sigma bond. After a brief introduction in Section 1, strategies exploiting auxiliary bidentate DGs to address the Pd(II)&#8208;mediated C&#9472;H activation are discussed in Section 2. The related Ligand&#8208;controlled processes are treated in Section 3 and Section 4 highlight the most recent atom&#8208;economic developments in peptide late&#8208;stage functionalization (LSF) proceeding via Pd(II)&#8208;mediated &#946;&#8208;C(sp3)&#8208;H activation of a precise &#945;$\alpha $&#8208;AA residue along the peptide sequence.

         <title>Enantioselective Catalytic 1,2&#8208;Benzoxazolyl Migration for Tertiary &#945;&#8208;Hydroxy Ester Synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A chiral Lewis acid and bifunctional squaramide&#8208;catalyzed enantioconvergent benzilic ester rearrangement of &#945;&#8208;diketones has been developed, enabling the construction of optically active tertiary &#945;&#8208;hydroxy esters with high enantioselectivity and functional group versatility, along with the synthesis of a novel chiral Boox ligand for asymmetric electrocatalysis, while DFT calculations elucidated the hemiketal&#8208;initiated mechanism and key transition states governing enantioselectivity.








Abstract
Asymmetric catalytic rearrangement, particularly the enantioselective benzilic ester rearrangement of &#945;&#8208;diketones, represents a potent synthetic tool for cleaving C&#9472;C bonds to generate optically active tertiary &#945;&#8208;hydroxy esters. However, enantioselective benzilic ester rearrangement involving a 1,2&#8208;heterocycle shift presents significant challenges owing to inadequate enantiomeric differentiation and steric hindrance associated with tertiary alcohols. In this study, we employed chiral Lewis acid and bifunctional squaramide catalysts for enantioconvergent benzilic ester rearrangement, achieving high enantioselectivity in the construction of tertiary alcohols with chemically versatile functional groups and the synthesis of a novel chiral benzoxazole&#8211;oxazoline (Boox) ligand for asymmetric electrocatalysis. DFT calculations elucidated a hemiketal&#8208;initiated reaction mechanism, pivotal 1,2&#8208;heterocycle shift transition states, and catalytic interactions that govern the increased enantioselectivity of the enantioconvergent benzilic ester rearrangement, furnishing crucial insights into the underlying mechanism.

         <title>Double&#8208;Network Soy Protein Adhesives with Enhanced Water Retention and Bonding Strength</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hierarchical dual&#8208;network soy protein adhesive combines chitosan's compliant supramolecular network (hydrogen bonding/electrostatic interactions) for 430% enhanced precure water retention with a stiff covalent crosslinked network formed during curing for 445% improved postcure bonding strength, successfully resolving the traditional trade&#8208;off between these properties in bio&#8208;based adhesives.








Abstract
Developing soy protein adhesives with high water retention and strong bonding strength is essential. Such materials can serve as a sustainable alternative to petroleum&#8208;based formaldehyde adhesives in wood panel manufacturing. However, a trade&#8208;off between precure water retention and postcure bonding strength remains a major challenge, and current strategies rarely achieve simultaneous enhancement of both properties. Inspired by the multi&#8208;enhancement mechanisms of double&#8209;network systems, we established a hierarchical dual&#8209;network adhesive system. It involves the self&#8208;assembly of chitosan into a compliant supramolecular framework via dynamic hydrogen bonding and electrostatic interactions, along with the additional formation of a stiff covalent crosslinked network during curing. This design achieves synergistic optimization of water retention and bonding strength. The &#8220;skeleton&#8211;tentacle&#8221; structure formed by functionalized chitosan significantly enhanced water retention by 430% and was crucial to forming the dual&#8208;network structure, improving wet shear strength by 445% and work of adhesion by 2133%. Additionally, the adhesive exhibited excellent mildew resistance and flame retardancy. The global warming potential was only 1.4&#160;kg CO2 eq, significantly lower than urea&#8211;formaldehyde and phenol&#8211;formaldehyde resins. This design provides a novel approach for developing high&#8208;performance bio&#8208;based adhesives and is expected to advance its practical application.

         <title>Variability of a Non&#8208;Centrosymmetric Tecto&#8208;Borosulfate: Introduction of Various Molecular Cations into BiX[B(SO4)2]4 (X&#160; = &#160;H3O+, NO2+, NH4+, NO+)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
To date, Bi(H3O)[B(SO)2]4 is only the second structure type containing a 3D anion within borosulfate chemistry. In this contribution three more representatives were synthesized, formally replacing oxonium by the molecular cations nitrosonium, nitronium, and ammonium. The structures crystallize homeotypically to the very first compound. A careful adjustment of the educts even allows mixed representatives.








Abstract
Although the number of borosulfates increased strongly over the past years, structures comprising a 3D anionic framework are still scarce. Herein, with BiX[B(SO4)2]4 (X&#160; = &#160;NH4+, NO2+, NO+) we present three new representatives. The bismuth borosulfates were synthesized under solvothermal condition and crystallize homeotypically to Bi(H3O)[B(SO4)2]4 in the tetragonal space group I4&#175;$\bar 4$ (Nr.82) (a&#160;=&#160;11.827(6) &#8211; 11.908(1) &#197;, c&#160;=&#160;8.1160(2) &#8211; 8.1315(6) &#197;, Z&#160;=&#160;2). Via all vertices connected BS4 supertetrahedra reveal a zeolite type like structure like its found for the tectosilicate K1.14[Mg0.57Si1.43O4] emphasizing their close relationship. Underlining the weak coordination behavior, for the first&#8208;time nitrosonium and nitrosylium cations are introduced into borosulfate chemistry. SHG measurements confirm the absence of an inversion center and show a nonlinear optical response with intensities up to 1.4 times higher than KDP. Furthermore, the titled compounds were characterized thoroughly by both single&#8208;crystal and powder X&#8208;ray diffraction, infrared spectroscopy, density functional theory (DFT) calculations, and thermal analysis.

         <title>Cyclopenta&#8208;Fused Polyaromatic Hydrocarbon (CP&#8208;PAH) Radicals: Synthesis, Characterization, and Quantum Chemical Calculations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Extending the &#960; system of a fully conjugated framework composed of alternating five&#8208; and six&#8208;membered rings led to further rare examples of bench&#8208;stable carbon&#8208;centered hydrocarbon radicals. Spectroscopic analysis allowed extensive characterization, which was further supported by computational methods.








Abstract
Two air&#8208; and moisture&#8208;stable cyclopenta&#8208;fused polyaromatic hydrocarbon (CP&#8208;PAH) radicals with six six&#8208; and three five&#8208;membered rings alternately fused to nonacycles were obtained by ortho fusion in suitably ortho,ortho&#8217;&#8208;substituted dinaphthylfluorenes and subsequent establishment of the conjugation. The radicals were obtained in five consecutive steps with total yields of 38 and 16%, respectively; key steps are Suzuki couplings and cyclizing SEAr reactions. Mesityl substituents at the five&#8208;membered rings ensure the kinetic stability of the radicals. They were characterized by EPR and UV/Vis spectroscopy. Quantum chemical calculations led to simulated UV/Vis/NIR spectra and disclosed further properties like spin densities, aromaticity, and orbital energies. Both radicals are best described with the unpaired electron centered in the outer five&#8208;membered rings. The respective resonance formulas show the largest number of fully intact benzene rings. A possible triradical character was computed to be small in both compounds. The five&#8208;membered rings, especially the central rings show significant antiaromatic character.

         <title>An Improved Cysteine&#8208;Based Labeling Strategy for GPCR Structural Dynamics Studies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present a strategy to achieve high specificity cysteine&#8208;based labeling of GPCRs by employing phenylarsine oxide to reversibly protect extracellular labile disulfides. This method efficiently reduces nonspecific labeling and enables receptor sample preparations with controllable disulfide redox states, facilitating further spectroscopic studies on GPCR structural dynamics.








Abstract
Spectroscopic investigations of the dynamic signaling process of G protein&#8208;coupled receptors (GPCRs) often require cysteine&#8208;based labeling. However, the presence of a highly conserved but labile disulfide bond in the receptor extracellular domain could result in strong background signals, hindering the application of spectroscopic methods in studying GPCR dynamics. Herein we report an improved strategy for site&#8208;specific labeling of muscarinic acetylcholine receptors by using phenylarsine oxide (PAO) to reversibly protect the conserved disulfide bond. This method can efficiently reduce background signals while maintaining receptor functionality, enabling both fluorophore and 19F labeling for structural dynamics studies of the M2 muscarinic receptor (M2R) by single&#8208;molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer (smFRET) and 19F nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). This improved strategy is anticipated to broaden the applicability of cysteine&#8208;based spectroscopic methods for structural dynamics studies of a wider range of GPCRs facing similar challenges.

         <title>Unraveling an Organic Soluble Precursor&#8208;Based Low&#8208;Temperature Synthetic Strategy to Impurity&#8208;Free Pristine and Transition Metal Doped Lead Apatites</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a mild, one&#8208;step, low&#8208;temperature hydrothermal synthesis of lead hydroxyapatite (Pb&#8208;HA) and transition&#8208;metal&#8208;doped Pb&#8208;HA using [Pb(&#956;&#8208;dtbp)2]n as the molecular precursor. This method prevents impurity formation, ensures selectivity, and yields paramagnetic TM&#8208;doped Pb&#8208;HA, offering a more efficient alternative to existing approaches.








Abstract
Doping of hydroxyapatites has garnered considerable interest, as it enables the tuning of the material's intrinsic properties. However, synthesizing hydroxyapatites and their doped variants is highly challenging, as the synthesis demands high temperature and complex, multi&#8208;step reaction conditions. Hence, we propose a soft, one&#8208;step synthetic approach to develop single&#8208;phase lead hydroxyapatite (Pb&#8208;HA), Pb10(PO4)6(OH)2, and transition metal&#8208;doped lead hydroxyapatites (TM&#8208;doped Pb&#8208;HA), Pb10&#8208;xMx(PO4)6(OH)2 (x &#8771; 0.5 to 1.0) (M&#160;=&#160;Cu, Co, or Mn) through a low&#8208;temperature hydrothermal decomposition route under neutral conditions. A newly synthesized 1D lead phosphate polymer [Pb(&#956;&#8208;dtbp)2]n (1) (dtbp&#160;=&#160;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butylphosphate) has been used as the metal&#8208;organic precursor for different lead phosphate phases by employing both solvothermal and solid&#8208;state thermal decomposition pathways. Hydrothermal decomposition of 1 in the presence of required stoichiometric amounts of an additional lead precursor, PbO, and transition phosphates/metal oxides (MO) at 140 &#176;C gave phase&#8208;pure Pb&#8208;HA and TM&#8208;doped Pb&#8208;HA. The associated magnetic and electronic property analysis revealed that all the synthesized materials display paramagnetic behavior, and they are wide&#8208;gap n&#8208;type semiconductors.

&lt;p&gt;We report a mild, one-step, low-temperature hydrothermal synthesis of lead hydroxyapatite (&lt;b&gt;Pb-HA&lt;/b&gt;) and transition-metal-doped &lt;b&gt;Pb-HA&lt;/b&gt; using [Pb(&#956;-dtbp)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; as the molecular precursor. This method prevents impurity formation, ensures selectivity, and yields paramagnetic TM-doped &lt;b&gt;Pb-HA&lt;/b&gt;, offering a more efficient alternative to existing approaches.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doping of hydroxyapatites has garnered considerable interest, as it enables the tuning of the material's intrinsic properties. However, synthesizing hydroxyapatites and their doped variants is highly challenging, as the synthesis demands high temperature and complex, multi-step reaction conditions. Hence, we propose a soft, one-step synthetic approach to develop single-phase lead hydroxyapatite (&lt;b&gt;Pb-HA&lt;/b&gt;), Pb&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;(PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2,&lt;/sub&gt; and transition metal-doped lead hydroxyapatites (TM-doped &lt;b&gt;Pb-HA&lt;/b&gt;), Pb&lt;sub&gt;10-x&lt;/sub&gt;M&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;(PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (x &#8771; 0.5 to 1.0) (M&#160;=&#160;Cu, Co, or Mn) through a low-temperature hydrothermal decomposition route under neutral conditions. A newly synthesized 1D lead phosphate polymer [Pb(&#956;-dtbp)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; (&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;) (dtbp&#160;=&#160;di-tert-butylphosphate) has been used as the metal-organic precursor for different lead phosphate phases by employing both solvothermal and solid-state thermal decomposition pathways. Hydrothermal decomposition of &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; in the presence of required stoichiometric amounts of an additional lead precursor, PbO, and transition phosphates/metal oxides (MO) at 140 &#176;C gave phase-pure &lt;b&gt;Pb-HA&lt;/b&gt; and TM-doped &lt;b&gt;Pb-HA&lt;/b&gt;. The associated magnetic and electronic property analysis revealed that all the synthesized materials display paramagnetic behavior, and they are wide-gap n-type semiconductors. More pertinently, this mild, versatile route offers improved control over the metal-to-ligand ratio compared to existing methods and can be adapted to introduce other divalent transition metals into hydroxyapatite frameworks.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Glutathione&#8208;Triggered Nitrite Release From Organic Nitrites Enhances Nitric Oxide Bioavailability in Mammalian Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study provides a three&#8208;in&#8208;one strategy for the generation of nitrite under physiological conditions, measurement of glutathione levels, and determination of the relative amounts of nitric oxide derived from endogenous and exogenous sources.








Abstract
The conversion of nitrite (NO2&#8722;) to nitric oxide (NO) represents a key pathway for NO generation under ischemic conditions. Therefore, organic nitro compounds capable of releasing nitrite under physiological environments have attracted considerable attention. Here, we demonstrate that simple 4&#8208;nitro&#8208;1,8&#8208;naphthalimide derivatives efficiently and almost quantitatively liberate nitrite upon reaction with biological thiols, particularly glutathione (GSH). These compounds function as NO prodrugs, enhancing NO bioavailability in mammalian cells through intracellular nitrite&#8211;to&#8211;NO conversion. Notably, their selectivity toward GSH and the intrinsic fluorescence of the resulting glutathione adducts enable their use as probes for monitoring intracellular GSH levels. Furthermore, cotreatment of endothelial cells with these naphthalimide derivatives and the NO probe DAF&#8208;FM diacetate provides a valuable strategy to distinguish between endogenously produced NO and NO generated via synthetic nitro compound&#8211;derived nitrite release. Together, these findings highlight 4&#8208;nitro&#8208;1,8&#8208;naphthalimides as a promising platform for both NO delivery and real&#8208;time cellular redox sensing.

         <title>Shedding Light on Synthetic Autocatalysis: From Conventional Closed&#8208;Shell Chemistries to Overlooked Open&#8208;Shell Occurrences</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Why add another catalyst when the product itself holds the power to catalyze its own formation? Autocatalysis in synthetic chemistry enhances reaction efficiency and uncovers novel catalytic behavior across both closed&#8208;shell and open&#8208;shell systems, expanding reactivity and enabling innovative design strategies.








Abstract
Autocatalysis is a kinetic phenomenon where a reaction product catalyzes its own formation, often leading to sigmoidal reaction profiles and exponential rate acceleration. This process plays a fundamental role in biological systems, for example, in chemistry of the origins of life. Although synthetic reactions are not as widely reported as the biological studies, autocatalysis offers a unique mechanism and high efficiency to organic synthesis. This review highlights diverse synthetic examples in various autocatalytic mechanistic paradigms, including well&#8208;studied examples such as the Soai reaction. We also explore emerging examples in radical&#8208; and photochemistry&#8208;based systems, emphasizing recent advances in auto&#8208;photocatalysis. By exploring examples from different fields, this review aims to highlight the variety and potential of autocatalytic reactions for synthesis. We aim to encourage further research into autocatalysis as a powerful strategy for improving reaction efficiency, revealing new reaction pathways, and inspiring innovative catalytic methodologies.

         <title>Water&#8208;Soluble Squaraine&#8208;Based NIR Chromofluorogenic Probe for HClO/ClO&#8722; Detection in Environmental Waters and Live&#8208;Cell Bioimaging</title>

         <dc:description>
A near&#8208;infrared (696/725&#160;nm), water&#8208;soluble squaraine dye SO3SQ was presented for the chromofluorogenic detection of HClO/ClO&#8722;. SO3SQ detects HClO/ClO&#8722; in 100% PBS system and exhibits visible colorimetric change, high selectivity, pH&#8208;independence and negligible cytotoxicity. SO3SQ is successfully used to detect HClO/ClO&#8722; in environmental water and enables fluorescence imaging of exogenous/endogenous HClO/ClO&#8722; in live HepG2 cells.








Abstract
Hypochlorous acid/hypochlorite (HClO/ClO&#8722;), as critical biological reactive oxygen species (ROS), plays essential roles in numerous physiological and pathological processes. To enable sensitive detection of HClO/ClO&#8722; in environmental water samples and living cells, a near&#8208;infrared (NIR) water&#8208;soluble squaraine&#8208;based chromofluorogenic probe SO3SQ was developed. SO3SQ exhibits good water solubility, NIR detection wavelength (696&#160;nm/725&#160;nm), high selectivity, rapid response time (within seconds), visible colorimetric response, and minimal cytotoxicity. Furthermore, SO3SQ achieved quantitative HClO/ClO&#8722; detection in environmental water samples and realized real&#8208;time fluorescence imaging of exogenous/endogenous HClO/ClO&#8722; in HepG2 cells. This work provides new ideas for the future design of NIR water&#8208;soluble HClO/ClO&#8722; probes, while expanding the application of squaraine dyes as HClO/ClO&#8722; probes.

         <title>Modular Assembly of Macrocyclic Sulfonamides via Consecutive Cascade Ring Expansion Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Methods for the efficient synthesis of macrocyclic sulfur(IV) compounds are rare. In this manuscript, a versatile strategy for the synthesis of macrocyclic sulfonamides is described using a modular three&#8208;stage protocol, including two consecutive cascade ring expansion reactions. The utility of this modular approach is showcased via the synthesis of a library of 42 diversely functionalized 13&#8208; and 14&#8208;membered macrocyclic sulfonamides.








Abstract
Sulfur(IV) groups and macrocycles are both important motifs in bioactive molecules of significant current interest in medicinal chemistry, but methods for the efficient synthesis of macrocyclic sulfur(IV) compounds are rare. In this manuscript, a modular, versatile strategy for the synthesis of macrocyclic sulfonamides is described, using consecutive ring expansion reactions. First, linear starting materials are assembled from simple building blocks. This is followed by two distinct cascade ring expansion reaction steps performed in sequence. The utility of this modular approach is showcased via the synthesis of a library of 42 diversely functionalized 13&#8208; and 14&#8208;membered macrocyclic sulfonamides. The use of consecutive ring expansions is key to the success of the protocol, ensuring the products are formed in overall good yields without requiring high&#8208;dilution conditions.

We report the synthesis of extended hybrid organic&#8208;inorganic rotaxanes based on (pyCH2NH2CH2CH2py)[TiIV7GaIIIO8(O2CtBu)16] (1) and (pyCH2NH2CH2py)[TiIV7GaIIIO8(O2CtBu)16] (3) building blocks, containing an anionic macrocycle and doubly pyridyl&#8208;terminated secondary ammonium threads. Reaction of 1 and 3 with [Cu(hfac)2] (hfac&#160;=&#160;1,1,1,5,5,5&#8208;hexafluoroacetylacetonate) gives {[Cu(hfac)2]3[1]2} (2) and {[Cu(hfac)2]2[3]} (4), respectively, which are characterized by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray crystallography. The products are controlled by the differing steric demands imposed by the two arms of the thread. The structure of 2 is an extended [3]rotaxane, with two molecules of 1 binding to a central [Cu(hfac)2] molecule via the longer arm of the thread, and two [Cu(hfac)2] units terminating the structure at the shorter arm. The structure of 4, where both arms of the thread are short, is an extended [2]rotaxane terminated by two molecules of [Cu(hfac)2]. The Cu&#8230;Cu&#8230;Cu fragment in 2 is linear, with the central Cu lying on an inversion center and with a separation between the terminal copper ions of 31.3&#160;&#197;. Double Electron&#8208;Electron Resonance (DEER; also known as PELDOR) spectroscopy proves that the [3]rotaxane structure remains intact in solution, detecting both terminal&#8230;center and terminal&#8230;terminal Cu&#8230;Cu interactions, with orientation&#8208;selective measurements demonstrating that there is a rearrangement of the structure at the terminal positions on dissolution.

         <title>Unraveling the Ruthenium(VIII)&#8208;Mediated Oxidation of N&#8208;Hydroxy Pyrrolidines to Cyclic Nitrones</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The oxidation of N&#8208;hydroxy pyrrolidines to cyclic nitrones with ruthenium tetroxide proceeds via a concerted mechanism with a defined two&#8208;electron transfer direction. In 3&#8208;substituted derivatives, regioselectivity is mainly controlled by the steric hindrance of the substituent. Radical or stepwise pathways are ruled out by calculations.








Abstract
The oxidation of N&#8208;hydroxypyrrolidines to cyclic nitrones represents a valuable transformation in organic synthesis due to the synthetic utility of such nitrones. In this work, we present a detailed computational study of the oxidation of five&#8208;membered N&#8208;hydroxylamines using ruthenium tetroxide. Through density functional theory (DFT) calculations complemented by topological analyses of the electron localization function (ELF), we reveal a concerted yet highly asynchronous two&#8208;electron transfer mechanism. No intermediates as energy minima are identified, but the reaction trajectory lies near the borderline between stepwise and concerted pathways. Our findings indicate that regioselectivity in the oxidation process does not correlate with the electronic nature of the substituent at position 3, but is instead governed by steric hindrance effects that modulate the approach of the ruthenium tetroxide moiety. This steric control provides a rational explanation for the modest regioselectivity observed experimentally. Notably, the computational predictions align closely with experimental product distributions, lending strong support to the proposed mechanistic model.

         <title>Balgacyclamide A: Structural Revision of the First Reported Total Synthesis and Evaluation of Oxazoline Synthesis via &#946;&#8208;Hydroxy Amides Dehydrative Cyclization Conditions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A synthetic pathway for balgacyclamide A has been developed over 21 synthetic steps with an overall 5% yield. In this route, the absolute stereochemistry via the dehydrative cyclization is established, which helps to shed insight into errors within a previous groups claim of the total synthesis of balgacyclamide A. An epimer was also constructed to further our route via the dehydrative cyclization.








Abstract
A total synthesis of balgacyclamide A was reported for the first time in 2020, however, after multiple epimerization studies of &#946;&#8208;hydroxy amides dehydrative cyclization to access oxazolines, we proposed a configurational reassignment from the previous synthetic pathway. Balgacyclamide A is a macrocyclic hexapeptide with antiparasitic activity against Plasmodium falciparum and Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense. Chemically, its core contains six amino acids that undergo heterocyclization to form one thiazole and two oxazoline rings. Two of the six amino acids are L&#8208;threonines that play an important role in their synthetic pathway to achieve oxazolines with the right configuration upon epimerization at the &#946;&#8208;carbon. Thus, we investigated the effect of L&#8208;threonine and L&#8208;allothreonine &#946;&#8208;carbon epimerization via the Burgess reagent, diethylaminosulfur trifluoride (DAST), and (NH4)6Mo7O24&#8226;4H2O catalyst to support previous oxazoline synthetic studies. Furthermore, the first total synthesis of balgacyclamide A and an epimer is reported via multiple synthetic key steps that involve a tandem sulfur incorporation, cyclization, and aromatization of the thiazole, and a late&#8208;stage &#946;&#8208;hydroxy amide Walden inversion to access both oxazolines.

         <title>Ion&#8208;Pairing&#8208;Modulated Diradical Properties in Partially Conjugated Negatively Charged &#960;&#8208;Electronic Systems</title>

         <dc:description>
A quinonoidal dipyrrolyldiketone boron complex with an orthogonally arranged catechol unit in the dianionic form exhibited diradical properties, as observed from the singlet&#8211;triplet energy gaps (&#916;EST) that were modulated by coexisting countercations. &#916;EST values were controlled by the bridging boron moieties in the dianion diradicals.








Abstract
A quinonoidal dipyrrolyldiketone catecholate&#8208;boron complex, with two pyrrole&#8208;quinonemethide moieties bridged by a six&#8208;membered cross&#8208;conjugated unit, was synthesized to modulate the diradical character of the dianion formed upon deprotonation. The dianionic species exhibited near&#8208;infrared absorption and electron spin resonance (ESR) signals, confirming the diradical properties. Variable&#8208;temperature (VT) ESR spectra suggest the thermal excitation from the ground&#8208;state singlet diradical to the triplet diradical, providing singlet&#8211;triplet energy gaps modulated by coexisting cations and bridging boron moieties.
