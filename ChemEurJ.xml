         <title>Facile Synthesis of Platinum Right Bipyramids by Separating and Controlling the Nucleation Step in a Continuous Flow System</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Colloidal synthesis of metal nanocrystals with controlled shapes and internal structures calls for a tight control over both the nucleation and growth processes. Here we report a method for the facile synthesis of Pt right bipyramids (RBPs) by separating nucleation from growth and controlling the nucleation step in a continuous flow reactor. Specifically, homogeneous nucleation was thermally triggered by introducing the reaction solution into a tubular flow reactor held at an elevated temperature to generate singly&#8208;twinned seeds. At a lower temperature, the singly&#8208;twinned seeds were protected from oxidative etching to allow their slow growth and evolution into RBPs while additional nucleation of undesired seeds could be largely suppressed to ensure RBPs as the main product. Further investigation indicated that the internal structure and growth pattern of the seeds were determined by the temperatures used for the nucleation and growth steps, respectively. The Br  &#8208;  ions involved in the synthesis also played a critical role in the generation of RBPs by serving as a capping agent for the Pt{100} facets while regulating the reduction kinetics through coordination with the Pt(IV) ions.</dc:description>

         <title>Efficient entropy&#8208;driven inhibition of dipeptidyl peptidase III by hydroxyethylene transition state peptidomimetics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dipeptidyl peptidase III (DPP3) is a ubiquitously expressed Zn&#8208;dependent protease, which plays an important role in regulating endogenous peptide hormones, such as enkephalins or angiotensins. In previous biophysical studies, we could show that substrate binding is driven by a large entropic contribution due to the release of water molecules from the closing binding cleft. Here, we report the design, synthesis and biophysical characterization of peptidomimetic inhibitors using for the first time an hydroxyethylene transition&#8208;state mimetic for a metalloprotease. Efficient routes for the synthesis of both stereoisomers of the pseudopeptide core were developed, which allowed the synthesis of peptidomimetic inhibitors mimicking the VVYPW&#8208;motif of tynorphin. The best inhibitors inhibit DPP3 in the low &#181;M range. Biophysical characterization by means of ITC measurement and X&#8208;ray crystallography confirm the unusual entropy&#8208;driven mode of binding. Stability assays demonstrated the desired stability of these inhibitors, which efficiently inhibited DPP3 in mouse brain homogenate.</dc:description>

         <title>Carbon dioxide capture enhanced by pre&#8208;adsorption of water and methanol in UiO&#8208;66</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The rapidly rising level of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere resulting from human activity is one of the greatest environmental problems facing our civilization today. Most technologies are not yet sufficiently developed to move existing infrastructure to cleaner alternatives. Therefore, techniques for capturing carbon dioxide from emission sources may play a key role at the moment. The structure of the UiO&#8208;66 material not only meets the requirement of high stability in contact with water vapor but through the water pre adsorbed in the pores, the selectivity of carbon dioxide adsorption is increased. We successfully applied the recently developed methodology for water adsorption modelling. It allowed to elucidate the influence of water on CO  2  adsorption and study the mechanism of this effect. We showed that water is adsorbed in octahedral cage and stands for promotor for CO  2  adsorption in less favorable space than tetrahedral cages. Water plays a role of a mediator of adsorption, what is a general idea of improving affinity of adsorbate. On the basis of pre&#8208;adsorption of methanol as another polar solvent, we have shown that the adsorption sites play a key role here, and not, as previously thought, only the interaction between the solvent and quadrupole carbon dioxide. Overall, we explained the mechanism of increased CO  2  adsorption in the presence of water and methanol, as polar solvents, in the UiO&#8208;66 pores for a potential post&#8208;combustion carbon dioxide capture application.</dc:description>

         <title>Diphenylalanine Motif Drives Self&#8208;assembling in Hybrid PNA&#8208;peptide Conjugates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Peptides and nucleic acids can self&#8208;assemble to give supramolecular structures that find application in different fields, ranging from the delivery of drugs to the obtainment of materials endowed with optical properties. Forces that stabilize the &#8220;suprastructures&#8221; typically are hydrogen bonds or aromatic interactions; in case of nucleic acids, Watson&#8208;Crick pairing drives self&#8208;assembly while, in case of peptides, backbone hydrogen bonds and interactions between aromatic side chains trigger the formation of structures, such as nanotubes or ribbons. Molecules containing both aromatic peptides and nucleic acids could in principle exploit different forces to self&#8208;assemble. In this work we meant to investigate the self&#8208;assembly of mixed systems, with the aim to understand which forces play a major role and determine formation/structure of aggregates. We therefore synthesized conjugates of the peptide FF to the Peptide Nucleic Acid dimer &#8220;gc&#8221; and characterized their aggregates by different spectroscopic techniques, including NMR, CD and fluorescence.</dc:description>

         <title>The Impact of C2&#8208;Insertion into Carbazole Donor on Physicochemical Properties of Dibenzo[a,j]phenazine&#8208;Cored Donor&#8211;Acceptor&#8211;Donor Triads</title>

         <dc:description>Novel electron&#8208;donor&#8211;acceptor&#8208;donor (D&#8211;A&#8211;D) compounds comprising of dibenzo[a,j  ]phenazine as the central acceptor core and two 7&#8208;membered diarylamines (i.e., iminodibenzyl and iminostilbene) as the donors have been designed and synthesized. The investigation of their physicochemical properties revealed the impact of C2&#8208;insertion into well&#8208;known carbazole electron&#8208;donors on the properties of previously reported twisted dibenzo[  a,j]phenazine&#8208;cored D&#8211;A&#8211;D triads. Slight structural modification caused a drastic change in conformational preference, allowing unique photophysical behavior of dual emission derived from room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence and triplet&#8208;triplet annihilation. Furthermore, the electrochemical analysis suggested the sigma&#8208;dimer formation and electrochemical polymerization on the electrode. Quantum chemical calculations have also rationalized the experimental results.</dc:description>

         <title>Aminotroponiminates: Impact of the NO2 Functional Group on Coordination, Isomerisation, and Backbone Substitution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aminotroponiminate (ATI) ligands are a versatile class of redox&#8208;active and potentially cooperative ligands with a rich coordination chemistry, which have consequently found a wide range of applications in synthesis and catalysis. While backbone substitution of these ligands has been investigated in some detail, the impact of electron&#8208;withdrawing groups on the coordination chemistry and reactivity of ATIs is only little investigated. We report here Li, Na, and K salts of an ATI ligand with a nitro&#8208;substituent in the backbone. It is demonstrated that the NO  2  group actively contributes to the coordination chemistry of these complexes, effectively competing with the  N  ,  N  &#8208;binding pocket as a coordination site. This results in an unprecedented  E  /  Z  &#8208;isomerisation of an ATI imino group and culminates in the isolation of the first &#8220;naked&#8221; ATI anion (i.e. without directional bonding to a metal atom). Reactions of sodium ATIs with silver(I) and tritylium salts gave the first  N,N  coordinated silver ATI complexes and unprecedented backbone substitution reactions. Analytical techniques applied in this work include multinuclear (VT&#8208;)NMR spectroscopy, single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis, and DFT calculations.</dc:description>

         <title>Ternary Conductance Switching Realized by a Pillar[5]arene&#8208;Functionalized Two&#8208;dimensional Imine Polymer Film</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nowadays, most manufacturing memory devices are based on materials with electrical bistability (i.e., &#8220;0&#8221; and &#8220;1&#8221;) in response to an applied electric field. Memory devices with multilevel states are highly desired to produce high&#8208;density and efficient memory devices. Herein, we report for the first time a multichannel strategy to realize ternary state memristor. We make use of the intrinsic subnanometer channel of pillar[5]arene and nanometer channel of two&#8208;dimensional imine polymer to construct an active layer with muiltilevel channels for ternary memory devices. Low threshold voltage, long retention time, clearly distinguishable resistance states, high ON/OFF ratio (OFF/ON1/ON2 = 1:10:10  3  ), and high ternary yield (75%) were obtained. In addition, the flexible memory device based on 2DP  TPAZ+TAPB  can maintain its stable ternary memory performance after bending for 500 times. The device also exhibits excellent thermal stability and can tolerate a high temperature of 300 &#176;C. The results in this work are envisioned to open up possibilities for multistate, flexible resistive memories with good thermal stability and low energy consumption and broaden the application of pillar[n]arene.</dc:description>

         <title>Static Retention of Dynamic Chiral Arrangement for Achiral Shear Thinning Metal Organic Colloids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chiral compounds are known to be important not only because it is the fundamental component of living organism, but also for its unique chiroptical properties. In recent years, scientists have fabricated several chiral organic supramolecular aggregates by utilizing chiral physical field, such as vortex flow. Herein, the relationship between this dynamic chiroptical property and the rheological nature was discussed, suggesting the shear thinning property of non&#8208;Newton fluid may help the colloidal particles adopt the chiral arrangement in the vortex. Further, the storage modulus of colloids was increased by adding linking agent, which successfully kept the dynamic chiroptical property in the static state. Besides, the salt effect on the host&#8208;guest interaction involved in the colloids was studied, suggesting the significant enhancement of the transferred dynamic circular dichroism for the achiral guest molecule.</dc:description>

Opening the way to densely functionalized natural products: We report the first anion&#8208;accelerated, thermally allowed, 2&#960;&#8208;electrocyclic ring opening as a novel route to substituted phenols 6&#8201;a&#8211;r and prove its efficacy in the total synthesis of the densely functionalized phenolic natural product caramboxin (isolated as the lactam dehydrate).







Abstract
Disrotatory &#8211; thermally allowed &#8211; 2&#960;&#8208;electrocyclic ring&#8208;opening reactions require high temperatures to proceed. Herein, we report the first anion&#8208;accelerated 2&#960;&#8208;electrocyclic ring opening of 6,6&#8208;dihalobicyclo[3.1.0]hexan&#8208;2&#8208;ones at low temperature to give the corresponding meta&#8208;halophenols in good to high yields (18 examples, 29&#8211;92&#8201;% yield, average: 65&#8201;%). Many of the phenols have unconventional substitution patterns and are reported here for the first time. Furthermore, the strength of the methodology was shown by the total synthesis of the densely functionalized phenolic natural product caramboxin (isolated as the lactam dehydrate). The reaction mechanism underlying the anion&#8208;acceleration was investigated in an ab initio study, which concluded that base&#8208;mediated proton abstraction anti to the concurrently departing endo&#8208;bromine was the initiating step in an overall concerted reaction mechanism leading directly to the meta&#8208;halophenol.

         <title>Tailoring Valence Tautomerism by Using Redox Potentials: Studies on Ferrocene&#8208;Based Triarylmethylium Dyes with Electron&#8208;Poor Fluorenylium and Thioxanthylium Acceptors</title>

Going radical: Valence tautomerism between diamagnetic ferrocene&#8208;triarylmethylium and ferrocenium&#8208;triarylmethyl diradical species was purposefully introduced by carefully selecting the organic tritylium&#8208;type substituent so that its reduction potential was reasonably close to that for oxidation of the ferrocenyl constituent. The diradical valence tautomer and the paramagnetic reduced ferrocenyl&#8208;triarylmethyl complexes were found to dimerize extensively, as verified by spin counting via quantitative EPR spectroscopy.







Abstract
Three new electrochromic ferrocenyl triarylmethylium dyes with fluorenylium (1&#8201;a+, 1&#8201;b+) or thioxanthylium (1&#8201;c+) residues were selected in order to keep the intrinsic differences of redox potentials for ferrocene oxidation and triarylmethylium reduction small and to trigger valence tautomerism (VT). UV/Vis/NIR and quantitative EPR spectroscopy identified paramagnetic diradical isomers 1&#8201;a..+&#8211;1&#8201;c..+ alongside diamagnetic forms 1&#8201;a+&#8211;1&#8201;c+, which renders these complexes magnetochemical switches. The diradical forms 1&#8201;a..+&#8211;1&#8201;c..+ as well as the one&#8208;electron&#8208;reduced triarylmethyl forms of the complexes were found to dimerize in solution. For radical 1&#8201;a., dimerization occurs on the timescale of cyclic voltammetry; this allowed us to determine the kinetics and equilibrium constant for this process by digital simulation. M&#246;&#223;bauer spectroscopy indicated that 1&#8201;a+ and 1&#8201;b+ retain VT even in the solid state. UV/Vis/NIR spectro&#8208;electrochemistry revealed the poly&#8208;electrochromic behaviour of these complexes by establishing the distinctly different electronic absorption profiles of the corresponding oxidized and reduced forms.

         <title>Structure and Reactivity of N&#8208;Heterocyclic Alkynyl Hypervalent Iodine Reagents</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 42, Page 10979-10986, July 26, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Four new N&#8208;heterocyclic alkynyl hypervalent iodine reagents have been synthesized. Their structures and reactivity are described and compared to already reported cyclic hypervalent iodine reagents, showing less extended &#963; holes for tosylated reagents. Good alkyne transfer properties towards strong nucleophiles were observed, but applications in radical and metal&#8208;catalyzed processes were more limited.







Abstract
Ethynylbenziodoxol(on)e (EBX) cyclic hypervalent iodine reagents have become popular reagents for the alkynylation of radicals and nucleophiles, but only offer limited possibilities for further structure and reactivity fine&#8208;tuning. Herein, the synthesis of new N&#8208;heterocyclic hypervalent iodine reagents with increased structural flexibility based on amide, amidine and sulfoximine scaffolds is reported. Solid&#8208;state structures of the reagents are reported and the analysis of the I&#8722;Calkyne bond lengths allowed assessing the trans&#8208;effect of the different substituents. Molecular electrostatic potential (MEP) maps of the reagents, derived from DFT computations, revealed less pronounced &#963;&#8208;hole regions for sulfonamide&#8208;based compounds. Most reagents reacted well in the alkynylation of &#946;&#8208;ketoesters. The alkynylation of thiols afforded more variable yields, with compounds with a stronger &#963;&#8208;hole reacting better. In metal&#8208;mediated transformations, the N&#8208;heterocyclic hypervalent iodine reagents gave inferior results when compared to the O&#8208;based EBX reagents.

Solid-state structures of the reagents are reported and the analysis of the I&#8722;C&lt;sub&gt;alkyne&lt;/sub&gt; bond lengths allowed assessing the &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;-effect of the different substituents. Molecular electrostatic potential (MEP) maps of the reagents, derived from DFT computations, revealed less pronounced &#963;-hole regions for sulfonamide-based compounds. Most reagents reacted well in the alkynylation of &#946;-ketoesters. The alkynylation of thiols afforded more variable yields, with compounds with a stronger &#963;-hole reacting better. In metal-mediated transformations, the N-heterocyclic hypervalent iodine reagents gave inferior results when compared to the O-based EBX reagents.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>The Role of Nitrogen&#8208;doping in the Catalytic Transfer Hydrogenation of Phenol to Cyclohexanone with Formic Acid over Pd supported on Carbon Nanotubes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 42, Page 10948-10956, July 26, 2021. </description>

Pd/OCNT is deactivated during the transfer hydrogenation of phenol with formic acid to cyclohexanone because of the full coverage of formate on Pd. By comparison, Pd/NCNT is highly active and selective in the transfer hydrogenation and deactivation does not occur. The nonplanar adsorption of phenol on NCNTs via weak O&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;N interactions enables the transfer hydrogenation with the adsorbed formate on Pd.







Abstract
Highly selective one&#8208;step hydrogenation of phenol to cyclohexanone, an important intermediate in the production of nylon 6 and nylon 66, is desirable but remains a challenge. Pd nanoparticles supported on nitrogen&#8208; and oxygen&#8208;functionalized carbon nanotubes (NCNTs, OCNTs) were prepared, characterized, and applied in the hydrogenation of phenol to cyclohexanone to study the effect of N&#8208;doping. Almost full conversion of phenol with high selectivity to cyclohexanone was achieved over Pd/NCNT under mild reaction conditions using either H2 or formic acid (FA) as a hydrogen source. The effects of reaction temperature and FA/phenol ratio and the reusability were investigated. Separate FA decomposition experiments without and with the addition of phenol were performed to investigate the reaction mechanism, especially the deactivation behavior. Deactivation was observed for both catalysts during the FA decomposition, while only Pd/OCNT rather than Pd/NCNT was deactivated in the transfer hydrogenation with FA and the FA decomposition in the presence of phenol, indicating the unique role of N&#8208;doping. Therefore, we assume that deactivation is caused by the strongly bound formates on the active Pd sites, suppressing further FA decomposition and/or transfer hydrogenation on Pd. The nonplanar adsorption of phenol on NCNTs via weak O&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;N interactions enables the occurrence of the subsequent hydrogenation by adsorbed formate on Pd.

         <title>Methyl&#8208;Induced Polarization Destabilizes the Noncovalent Interactions of N&#8208;Methylated Lysines</title>

Methylation of ammonium weakens its electrostatic attraction with protein functional groups &#8208; salt bridges, hydrogen bonds and cation&#8208;&#960; interactions weaken by as much as 10.3, 7.9 and 3.5&#8201;kT, respectively. The weakened electrostatics is due to altered inductive effects that overcome increased attraction from methyl&#8208;enhanced polarizability and dispersion. Due to their fundamental nature, these effects are expected to be widely present.







Abstract
Lysine methylation can modify noncovalent interactions by altering lysine's hydrophobicity as well as its electronic structure. Although the ramifications of the former are documented, the effects of the latter remain largely unknown. Understanding the electronic structure is important for determining how biological methylation modulates protein&#8722;protein binding, and the impact of artificial methylation experiments in which methylated lysines are used as spectroscopic probes and protein crystallization facilitators. The benchmarked first&#8208;principles calculations undertaken here reveal that methyl&#8208;induced polarization weakens the electrostatic attraction of amines with protein functional groups &#8211; salt bridges, hydrogen bonds and cation&#8208;&#960; interactions weaken by as much as 10.3, 7.9 and 3.5&#8201;kT, respectively. Multipole analysis shows that weakened electrostatics is due to the altered inductive effects, which overcome increased attraction from methyl&#8208;enhanced polarizability and dispersion. Due to their fundamental nature, these effects are expected to be present in many cases. A survey of methylated lysines in protein structures reveals several cases in which methyl&#8208;induced polarization is the primary driver of altered noncovalent interactions; in these cases, destabilizations are found to be in the 0.6&#8211;4.7&#8201;kT range. The clearest case of where methyl&#8208;induced polarization plays a dominant role in regulating biological function is that of the PHD1&#8208;PHD2 domain, which recognizes lysine&#8208;methylated states on histones. These results broaden our understanding of how methylation modulates noncovalent interactions.

         <title>Solvent&#8208;Dependent Stabilization of a Charge Transfer State is the Key to Ultrafast Triplet State Formation in an Epigenetic DNA Nucleoside</title>

The ultrafast excited&#8208;state relaxation mechanisms of the epigenetic nucleoside 5fdCyd are revealed. Upon exposure to UV light, solvent&#8208;dependent charge transfer state&#8208;induced intersystem crossing is direct observed by TRIR and QM calculation.







Abstract
2&#8217;&#8208;Deoxy&#8208;5&#8208;formylcytidine (5fdCyd), a naturally occurring nucleoside found in mammalian DNA and mitochondrial RNA, exhibits important epigenetic functionality in biological processes. Because it efficiently generates triplet excited states, it is an endogenous photosensitizer capable of damaging DNA, but the intersystem crossing (ISC) mechanism responsible for ultrafast triplet state generation is poorly understood. In this study, time&#8208;resolved mid&#8208;IR spectroscopy and quantum mechanical calculations reveal the distinct ultrafast ISC mechanisms of 5fdCyd in water versus acetonitrile. Our experiment indicates that in water, ISC to triplet states occurs within 1&#8197;ps after 285&#8197;nm excitation. PCM&#8208;TD&#8208;DFT computations suggest that this ultrafast ISC is mediated by a singlet state with significant cytosine&#8208;to&#8208;formyl charge&#8208;transfer (CT) character. In contrast, ISC in acetonitrile proceeds via a dark 1n&#960;* state with a lifetime of &#8764;3&#8197;ps. CT&#8208;induced ISC is not favored in acetonitrile because reaching the minimum of the gateway CT state is hampered by intramolecular hydrogen bonding, which enforces planarity between the aldehyde group and the aromatic group. Our study provides a comprehensive picture of the non&#8208;radiative decay of 5fdCyd in solution and new insights into the factors governing ISC in biomolecules. We propose that the intramolecular CT state observed here is a key to the excited&#8208;state dynamics of epigenetic nucleosides with modified exocyclic functional groups, paving the way to study their effects in DNA strands.

         <title>Stable and Storable N(CF3)2 Transfer Reagents</title>

Stable storage solutions: Copper(I) and silver(I) complexes with the bis(trifluoromethyl)amido ligand stabilized by pyridine and phosphane ligands have become accessible. These complexes are thermally stable and can be stored under inert conditions; in contrast to the behavior of other metal salts such as M{N(CF3)2} (M=Cu, Ag). The complexes were found to be convenient reagents for nucleophilic substitution and Sandmeyer reactions, thereby providing access to a series of organic substrates with the bis(trifluoromethyl)amino group.







Abstract
Fluorinated groups are essential for drug design, agrochemicals, and materials science. The bis(trifluoromethyl)amino group is an example of a stable group that has a high potential. While the number of molecules containing perfluoroalkyl, perfluoroalkoxy, and other fluorinated groups is steadily increasing, examples with the N(CF3)2 group are rare. One reason is that transfer reagents are scarce and metal&#8208;based storable reagents are unknown. Herein, a set of CuI and AgI bis(trifluoromethyl)amido complexes stabilized by N&#8208; and P&#8208;donor ligands with unprecedented stability are presented. The complexes are stable solids that can even be manipulated in air for a short time. They are bis(trifluoromethyl)amination reagents as shown by nucleophilic substitution and Sandmeyer reactions. In addition to a series of benzylbis(trifluoromethyl)amines, 2&#8208;bis(trifluoromethyl)amino acetate was obtained, which, upon hydrolysis, gives the fluorinated amino acid N,N&#8208;bis(trifluoromethyl)glycine.

In addition to a series of benzylbis(trifluoromethyl)amines, 2-bis(trifluoromethyl)amino acetate was obtained, which, upon hydrolysis, gives the fluorinated amino acid &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-bis(trifluoromethyl)glycine.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Advanced Acceptor&#8208;Substituted S,N&#8208;Heteropentacenes for Application in Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 42, Page 10913-10924, July 26, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Functionalized S,N&#8208;heteropentacenes SN5&#8217; comprising annulated thiophene and pyrrole rings with the heteroatom sequence SSNSS in the ladder&#8208;type backbone were developed with systematically varied structural motifs. Tunable frontier orbital energies allowed their application either as donor or as nonfullerenic acceptor in solution&#8208;processed bulk&#8208;heterojunction solar cells.







Abstract
Ambifunctional heterpentacenes with the heteroatom sequence SSNSS in the ladder&#8208;type backbone were used either as donor or as nonfullerenic acceptor in solution&#8208;processed bulk&#8208;heterojunction solar cells. Different acceptor moieties and side chains were inserted. Synthesis and characterization of the systematically varied structural motifs provided insight in structure&#8208;property relationships. Moreover, a dimeric heteroacene was synthesized, and the optoelectronic properties were compared to those of its monomeric counterpart.

         <title>Anthrathiadiazole Derivatives: Synthesis, Physical Properties and Two&#8208;photon Absorption</title>

Here, by using a simple [4+2] cycloaddition reaction between a,a,a&#8217;,a&#8217;&#8208;tetrabromo o&#8208;xylenes derivatives and benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole&#8208;4,7&#8208;dione, the substituted anthrathiadiazoles with &#8722;Br, &#8722;CN, and &#8722;OCH3 groups could be easily constructed. The as&#8208;obtained compounds display the two&#8208;photon absorption, where their cross&#8208;section values are strongly affected by the nature, position and strength of the substituted groups.







Abstract
Anthrathiadiazole is a key synthon for the construction of large azaacenes, however, the attachment of different substituents onto the skeleton of anthrathiadiazole is difficult but highly desirable because it could be easy to enrich the structures of azaacenes. Here, it is demonstrated that anthrathiadiazole derivatives with &#8722;Br, &#8722;CN, and &#8722;OCH3 groups could be easily constructed through a simple [4+2] cycloaddition reaction between a,a,a&#8217;,a&#8217;&#8208;tetrabromo&#8208;o&#8208;xylenes derivatives and benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole&#8208;4,7&#8208;dione. The structures of the as&#8208;prepared compounds with different substituents were carefully characterized. Moreover, the basic physical properties of the as&#8208;prepared anthrathiadiazole derivatives were fully investigated, where the cyano&#8208;substituted derivative (BTH&#8208;CN) has the highest stability and the methoxy&#8208;substituted derivative (BTH&#8208;OCH3) is easy to be oxidized. Moreover, the two&#8208;photon absorption (TPA) characteristics of different anthrathiadiazoles are also studied by using the femtosecond Z&#8208;scan technique. The results show that the fused anthrathiadiazole skeletons possess large TPA cross&#8208;section values &#948;2 in the range of 3000&#8211;5000&#8197;GM, where the nature, position and strength of the substituted groups have strong effect on these values.

         <title>Radiochromic Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Frameworks for X&#8208;ray Detection</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 42, Page 10957-10965, July 26, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydrogen bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) were explored as radiochromic materials responsive to X&#8208;ray irradiation, opening a new avenue for their application. The HOFs reported here have the same building block yet different radiochromic behaviors: one is sensitive to both X&#8208;ray and UV light, while the other one is specifically responsive to X&#8208;ray light. These phenomena provide a precious chance to understand the vital factors that account for the detection specificity of radiochromic materials.







Abstract
Porous materials have been investigated as efficient photochromic platforms for detecting hazardous radiation, while the utilization of hydrogen bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) in this field has remained intact. Herein, two HOFs were synthesized through self&#8208;assembly of tetratopic viologen ligand and formic acid (PFC&#8208;25, PFC&#8208;26), as a new class of &#8220;all&#8208;organic&#8221; radiochromic smart material, opening a gate for HOFs in this field. PFC&#8208;26 is active upon both X&#8208;ray and UV irradiation, while PFC&#8208;25 is only active upon X&#8208;ray irradiation. The same building block yet different radiochromic behaviors of PFC&#8208;25 and PFC&#8208;26 allow us to gain a deep mechanistic understanding of the factors that control the detection specificity. Theoretical and experimental studies reveal that the degree of &#960;&#8208;conjugation of viologen ligand is highly related to the threshold energy of triggering a charge transfer, therefore being a vital factor for the particularity of radiochromic materials. Thanks to its convenient processibility, nanoparticle size, and UV silence, PFC&#8208;25 can be further fabricated into a portable naked&#8208;eye sensor for X&#8208;ray detection, which shows obvious color change with the merits of high transmittance contrast, good sensitivity (reproducible dose threshold of 3.5&#8197;Gy), and excellent stability. The work exhibits the promising practical potentials of HOF materials in photochromic technology.

         <title>Novel WS2/Fe0.95S1.05 Hierarchical Nanosphere as a Highly Efficient Electrocatalyst for Hydrogen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 42, Page 10998-11004, July 26, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
WS2/Fe0.95S1.05 hierarchical nanospheres were prepared via a one&#8208;pot synthetic route, with great hydrogen evolution reaction activities. The unique plate of WS2 and the complex solid&#8208;phase structure of Fe0.95S1.05 exposes more active sites for the HER reaction, which helps to improve the accessibility and diffusibility of the electrolyte, and hence the WS2/Fe0.95S1.05 hybrid catalysts display favorable catalytic for HER.







Abstract
Fe0.95S1.05 with high reactivity and stability was incorporated into WS2 nanosheets via a one&#8208;step solvothermal method for the first time. The resulted hybrid catalyst has much higher catalytic activity than WS2 and Fe0.95S1.05 alone, and the optimal WS2/Fe0.95S1.05 hybrid catalyst was found by adjusting the feed ratio. The addition of Fe0.95S1.05 was proven to be able to enhance the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity of WS2, and vice versa. At the same time, it was found that the catalytic effect of the hybrid catalyst was the best when the feed ratio was W&#8201;:&#8201;Fe=2&#8201;:&#8201;1. In other words, we confirmed that there is a synergistic effect between W&#8208; and Fe&#8208;based sulfide hybrid catalysts, and validated that the reason for the improved HER performance is the strong interaction between the two in the middle sulfur. WS2/Fe0.95S1.05&#8208;2 hybrid catalyst leads to enhanced HER activity, which shows a low overpotential of &#8764;0.172&#8197;V at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, low Tafel slope of &#8764;53.47&#8197;mV/decade. This study supplies innovative synthesis of a highly active WS2/Fe0.95S1.05 hybrid catalyst for HER.

At the same time, it was found that the catalytic effect of the hybrid catalyst was the best when the feed ratio was W&#8201;:&#8201;Fe=2&#8201;:&#8201;1. In other words, we confirmed that there is a synergistic effect between W- and Fe-based sulfide hybrid catalysts, and validated that the reason for the improved HER performance is the strong interaction between the two in the middle sulfur. WS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/Fe&lt;sub&gt;0.95&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;1.05&lt;/sub&gt;-2 hybrid catalyst leads to enhanced HER activity, which shows a low overpotential of &#8764;0.172&#8197;V at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, low Tafel slope of &#8764;53.47&#8197;mV/decade. This study supplies innovative synthesis of a highly active WS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/Fe&lt;sub&gt;0.95&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;1.05&lt;/sub&gt; hybrid catalyst for HER.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Alkali&#8208;induced Transformation of Ni&#8208;MOF into Ni(OH)2 Nanostructured Flowers for Efficient Electrocatalytic Methanol Oxidation Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 42, Page 10966-10972, July 26, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple ex situ wet chemical transformation method of alkali treatment was proposed to prepare Ni(OH)2 nanostructured flowers with large specific surface areas from Ni&#8208;MOF&#8208;74. The relationship between concentration of alkali and the structure properties of corresponding Ni(OH)2 was uncovered. As the results, the catalyst of Ni(OH)2&#8208;0.25 performed remarkably catalytic properties with lower potential, higher current density and excellent durability towards MOR among various samples.







Abstract
Post treatment of metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) is widely employed to develop efficient electrocatalysts with better catalytic properties. But the complex processes of post treatment generally led to the collapse of the original structures of MOFs, making the preservation of their pristine hierarchical porous structure a great challenge. Herein, we propose the strategy of alkali treatment of Ni&#8208;MOF to transform it into Ni(OH)2 with similar morphology and enhanced electrocatalytic properties for methanol oxidation reaction (MOR). The structure and electrocatalytic properties of as&#8208;obtained Ni(OH)2 nanostructured flowers were seriously depended on the alkali concentrations. As the result, Ni(OH)2 obtained from Ni&#8208;MOF treated by 0.25&#8197;M NaOH (noted as Ni(OH)2&#8208;0.25) performs 1.5 and 2.5 times larger current density than those of Ni(OH)2&#8208;0.025 and Ni(OH)2&#8208;0.5 for MOR. Moreover, the electrocatalytic process and mechanism of MOR on the catalyst of Ni(OH)2&#8208;0.25 are also revealed. Hence, this ex situ conversion strategy of alkali treatment for Ni&#8208;MOF uncovered the transformation of MOFs in alkaline solution and develops robust electrocatalyst for practical application of methanol fuel cells.

         <title>Experimental and Computational Models for Side Chain Discrimination in Peptide&#8211;Protein Interactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 42, Page 10883-10897, July 26, 2021. </description>

A model system to study interactions between aromatic cavities and non&#8208;polar side chains was developed and studied by different NMR methods, where a weak but evident side&#8208;chain discrimination was observed. The experimental quantitative and qualitative data was used to evaluate different computational methods, with the conclusion that for this system, molecular mechanics gave more accurate results than density functional theory calculations.







Abstract
A bis(18&#8208;crown&#8208;6) Tr&#246;ger's base receptor and 4&#8208;substituted hepta&#8208;1,7&#8208;diyl bisammonium salt ligands have been used as a model system to study the interactions between non&#8208;polar side chains of peptides and an aromatic cavity of a protein. NMR titrations and NOESY/ROESY NMR spectroscopy were used to analyze the discrimination of the ligands by the receptor based on the substituent of the ligand, both quantitatively (free binding energies) and qualitatively (conformations). The analysis showed that an all&#8208;anti conformation of the heptane chain was preferred for most of the ligands, both free and when bound to the receptor, and that for all of the receptor&#8208;ligand complexes, the substituent was located inside or partly inside of the aromatic cavity of the receptor. We estimated the free binding energy of a methyl&#8208; and a phenyl group to an aromatic cavity, via CH&#8208;&#960;, and combined aromatic CH&#8208;&#960; and &#960;&#8208;&#960; interactions to be &#8722;1.7 and &#8722;3.3&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1, respectively. The experimental results were used to assess the accuracy of different computational methods, including molecular mechanics (MM) and density functional theory (DFT) methods, showing that MM was superior.

         <title>Asymmetric Spirobiacridine&#8208;based Delayed Fluorescence Emitters for High&#8208;performance Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Devices</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 42, Page 10869-10874, July 26, 2021. </description>

Three types of asymmetric spirobiacridine&#8208;based delayed fluorescent emitters are developed and investigated. The triphenyltriazine&#8208;based emitter exhibited a unity photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY), high horizontal orientation ratio (&#920;) of over 80&#8201;%, and an external quantum efficiency (EQE) of over 30&#8201;%. The substituents on the triazine electron&#8208;acceptor unit drastically affects the photophysical property and device performance.







Abstract
Recently, researchers have focused on thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) for efficient future lighting and displays. Among TADF emitters, a combination of triazine and acridine is a promising candidate for realizing high&#8208;efficiency organic light&#8208;emitting devices (OLEDs). However, simultaneous development of perfect horizontal orientation (&#920;=100&#8201;%) and an external quantum efficiency (EQE) of over 40&#8201;% is still challenging. Here, to obtain insights for further improvements of a triazine/acridine combination, various asymmetric spirobiacridine (SBA)&#8208;based TADF emitters with a unity photoluminescence quantum yield and high &#920; ratio of over 80&#8201;% were developed. Furthermore, the substitution effects of the triazine acceptor unit on the photophysical properties were studied, including molecular orientations and OLED performance. The corresponding OLED exhibited sky&#8208;blue emission with a high EQE of over 30&#8201;%.

         <title>Easy Access to Versatile Catalytic Systems for C&#8722;H Activation and Reductive Amination Based on Tetrahydrofluorenyl Rhodium(III) Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 42, Page 10903-10912, July 26, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A versatile rhodium catalystfor the formation C&#8722;N and C&#8722;C bonds was synthesized based on easily available 1,2,3,4&#8208;tetrahydrofluorene. The catalyst efficiently works for the reductive amination of carbonyl compounds via elimination of the tetrahydrofluorenyl ligand as well as for CH activation of aromatic compounds with the retention of this ligand.







Abstract
On the basis of the 1,2,3,4&#8208;tetrahydrofluorenyl ligand, a simple approach was developed to new effective rhodium catalysts for the construction of C&#8722;C and C&#8722;N bonds. The halide compounds [(&#951;5&#8208;tetrahydrofluorenyl)RhX2]2 (2&#8201;a: X=Br; 2&#8201;b: X=I) were synthesized by treatment of the bis(ethylene) derivative (&#951;5&#8208;tetrahydrofluorenyl)Rh(C2H4)2 (1&#8201;a) with halogens. An analogous reaction of the cyclooctadiene complex (&#951;5&#8208;tetrahydrofluorenyl)Rh(cod) (1&#8201;b) with I2 is complicated by the side formation of [(cod)RhI]2. The reaction of 2&#8201;b with 2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridyl leads to cation [(&#951;5&#8208;tetrahydrofluorenyl)Rh(2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridyl)I]+ (3). The halide abstraction from 2&#8201;a,b with thallium or silver salts allowed us to prepare sandwich compounds with incoming cyclopentadienyl, dicarbollide and mesityleneligands [(&#951;5&#8208;tetrahydrofluorenyl)RhCp]+ (4), (&#951;5&#8208;tetrahydrofluorenyl)Rh(&#951;&#8208;7,8&#8208;C2B9H11) (5), and [(&#951;5&#8208;tetrahydrofluorenyl)Rh(&#951;&#8208;mesitylene)]2+ (6). The structures of 1&#8201;b, 2&#8201;b&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2I2, 3PF6, 4TlI4, 5, and [(cod)RhI]2 were determined by X&#8208;ray diffraction. Compounds 2&#8201;a,b efficiently catalyze the oxidative coupling of benzoic acids with alkynes to selectively give isocoumarins or naphthalenes, depending on the reaction temperature. Moreover, they showed moderate catalytic activity in other annulations of alkynes with aromatic compounds (such as benzamide, acetanilide, etc.) which proceed through CH activation. Compound 2&#8201;b also effectively catalyzes the reductive amination of aldehydes and ketones in the presence of carbon monoxide and water via water&#8208;gas shift reaction, giving amines in high yields (67&#8211;99&#8201;%).

The catalyst efficiently works for the reductive amination of carbonyl compounds via elimination of the tetrahydrofluorenyl ligand as well as for CH activation of aromatic compounds with the retention of this ligand.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the basis of the 1,2,3,4-tetrahydrofluorenyl ligand, a simple approach was developed to new effective rhodium catalysts for the construction of C&#8722;C and C&#8722;N bonds. The halide compounds [(&#951;&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;-tetrahydrofluorenyl)RhX&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (&lt;b&gt;2&#8201;a&lt;/b&gt;: X=Br; &lt;b&gt;2&#8201;b&lt;/b&gt;: X=I) were synthesized by treatment of the bis(ethylene) derivative (&#951;&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;-tetrahydrofluorenyl)Rh(C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (&lt;b&gt;1&#8201;a&lt;/b&gt;) with halogens. An analogous reaction of the cyclooctadiene complex (&#951;&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;-tetrahydrofluorenyl)Rh(cod) (&lt;b&gt;1&#8201;b&lt;/b&gt;) with I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is complicated by the side formation of [(cod)RhI]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. The reaction of &lt;b&gt;2&#8201;b&lt;/b&gt; with 2,2&#8242;-bipyridyl leads to cation [(&#951;&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;-tetrahydrofluorenyl)Rh(2,2&#8242;-bipyridyl)I]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; (&lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt;). The halide abstraction from &lt;b&gt;2&#8201;a&lt;/b&gt;,&lt;b&gt;b&lt;/b&gt; with thallium or silver salts allowed us to prepare sandwich compounds with incoming cyclopentadienyl, dicarbollide and mesityleneligands [(&#951;&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;-tetrahydrofluorenyl)RhCp]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; (&lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt;), (&#951;&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;-tetrahydrofluorenyl)Rh(&#951;-7,8-C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;B&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt;) (&lt;b&gt;5&lt;/b&gt;), and [(&#951;&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;-tetrahydrofluorenyl)Rh(&#951;-mesitylene)]&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; (&lt;b&gt;6&lt;/b&gt;). The structures of &lt;b&gt;1&#8201;b&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;2&#8201;b&lt;/b&gt;&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, &lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt;PF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;, &lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt;TlI&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, &lt;b&gt;5&lt;/b&gt;, and [(cod)RhI]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; were determined by X-ray diffraction. Compounds &lt;b&gt;2&#8201;a&lt;/b&gt;,&lt;b&gt;b&lt;/b&gt; efficiently catalyze the oxidative coupling of benzoic acids with alkynes to selectively give isocoumarins or naphthalenes, depending on the reaction temperature. Moreover, they showed moderate catalytic activity in other annulations of alkynes with aromatic compounds (such as benzamide, acetanilide, etc.) which proceed through CH activation. Compound &lt;b&gt;2&#8201;b&lt;/b&gt; also effectively catalyzes the reductive amination of aldehydes and ketones in the presence of carbon monoxide and water via water-gas shift reaction, giving amines in high yields (67&#8211;99&#8201;%).&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Triangular Rhodamine Triads and Their Intrinsic Photophysics Revealed from Gas&#8208;Phase Ion Fluorescence Experiments</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 42, Page 10875-10882, July 26, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Communication between ionic dyes: New triangular rhodamine triads were synthesized and spectroscopically characterized as isolated trications in the gas phase. Fluorescence spectra reveal efficient energy transfer from one dye (rhodamine 575) to another (rhodamine 640) despite of electrostatic screening by the &#960;&#8208;spacer. No spectral shift due to the internal Coulomb repulsion between the dyes was observed.







Abstract
When ionic dyes are close together, the internal Coulomb interaction may affect their photophysics and the energy&#8208;transfer efficiency. To explore this, we have prepared triangular architectures of three rhodamines connected to a central triethynylbenzene unit (1,3,5&#8208;tris(buta&#8208;1,3&#8208;diyn&#8208;1&#8208;yl)benzene) based on acetylenic coupling reactions and measured fluorescence spectra of the isolated, triply charged ions in vacuo. We find from comparisons with previously reported monomer and dimer spectra that while polarization of the &#960;&#8208;system causes redshifted emission, the separation between the rhodamines is too large for a Stark shift. This picture is supported by electrostatic calculations on model systems composed of three linear and polarizable ionic dyes in D3h configuration: The electric field that each dye experiences from the other two is too small to induce a dipole moment, both in the ground and the excited state. In the case of heterotrimers that contain either two rhodamine 575 (R575) and one R640 or one R575 and two R640, emission is almost purely from R640 although the polarization of the &#960;&#8208;system expectedly diminishes the dipole&#8208;dipole interaction.

         <title>Tune the Fluorescence and Electrochemiluminescence of Graphitic Carbon Nitride Nanosheets by Controlling the Defect States</title>

The effects of defect states on the fluorescence (FL) and electrochemiluminescence (ECL) properties of g&#8208;CN are systematically investigated for the first time. It is found that the luminescence properties of g&#8208;CN are determined by its band gap and two kinds of defects (CN&#8208;defect and C&#8208;defect). The results provide a deep insight into the FL and ECL mechanisms of g&#8208;CN, and are of significance in tuning the FL and ECL properties of g&#8208;CN.







Abstract
The effects of defect states on the fluorescence (FL) and electrochemiluminescence (ECL) properties of graphite phase carbon nitride (g&#8208;CN) are systematically investigated for the first time. The g&#8208;CN nanosheets (CNNSs) obtained at different condensation temperatures are used as the study models. It can be found that all the CNNSs have two kinds of defect states, one is originated from the edge of CNNSs (labeled as CN&#8208;defect) and the other is attributed to the partially carbonization regions (labeled as C&#8208;defect). Both two kinds of defect states substantially affect the luminescent properties of CNNSs. Both the FL and ECL signals of CNNSs contain a band gap emission and two defect emissions. For the FL of CNNSs, decreasing the density of defect states can increase efficiently the FL quantum yield, while increasing the density of defect states can make the FL spectra red shift. For the ECL of CNNSs, increasing the density of CN&#8208;defect states and decreasing the density of C&#8208;defect states are greatly important to improve the ECL activity. This work provides a deep insight into the FL and ECL mechanisms of g&#8208;CN, and is of significance in tuning the FL and ECL properties of g&#8208;CN. Also, it will greatly promote the applications of CNNSs based on the FL and ECL properties.

Formidable fibers: A gelatin&#8208;derived 1D hybrid electrocatalyst with highly dispersed Fe/Fe3C nanoparticles encapsulated into Fe,N co&#8208;doped carbon nanofibers was synthesized. Owing to the distinct 1D nanofiber structure and the synergistic effect of Fe/Fe3C and Fe&#8722;Nx sites, the electrocatalyst is highly active for ORR with a half&#8208;wave potential of 0.885&#8197;V (outperforming commercial Pt/C) and a superior electrochemical stability in alkaline electrolyte. Similarly, it also shows a high power density and a superior stability in Zn&#8208;air battery.







Abstract
Exploring high&#8208;performance non&#8208;precious&#8208;metal electrocatalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is critical. Herein, a scalable and cost&#8208;effective strategy is reported for the construction of one&#8208;dimensional carbon nanofiber architectures with simultaneous decoration of single Fe&#8722;Nx sites and highly dispersed Fe/Fe3C nanoparticles for efficient ORR, through the FeIII&#8208;complex&#8208;assisted electrospinning of gelatin nanofibers with subsequent pre&#8208;oxidation and carbonization. Results show that the presence of a FeIII complex enables the 1D gelatin nanofibers to be well retained during the pre&#8208;oxidation process. Owing to the distinct 1D nanofiber structure and the synergistic effect of Fe/Fe3C and Fe&#8722;Nx sites, the resulting electrocatalyst is highly active for ORR with a half&#8208;wave potential of 0.885&#8197;V (outperforming commercial Pt/C) and a superior electrochemical stability in alkaline electrolytes. Similarly, it also shows a high power density (144.7&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2) and a superior stability in Zn&#8208;air batteries. This work opens a path for the design and synthesis of 1D carbon electrocatalyst for efficient ORR catalysis.

         <title>Cover Feature: Experimental and Computational Models for Side Chain Discrimination in Peptide&#8211;Protein Interactions (Chem. Eur. J. 42/2021)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 42, Page 10778-10778, July 26, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A model system to study interactions between aromatic cavities and non&#8208;polar side chains was developed and studied by different NMR methods, where a weak but evident side&#8208;chain discrimination was observed. The experimental quantitative and qualitative data was used to evaluate different computational methods, with the conclusion that, for this system, molecular mechanics gave more accurate results than density functional theory calculations. More information can be found in the Full Paper by P.&#8208;O. Norrby, K. W&#228;rnmark, et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202100890).

         <title>Frontispiece: Donor&#8208;Acceptor Type Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>

         <dc:description>
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) can be mediated with various geometry&#8208; and property&#8208;tailored building blocks, where donor (D) and acceptor (A) segments can be finely arranged to form highly ordered networks (namely D&#8722;A COFs). The unique structural features of D&#8722;A COFs render the formation of segregated D&#8722;A stacks, thus provides pathways and channels for effective charge carrier transport. This review highlights the significant progress on D&#8722;A COFs over the past decade with emphasis on design principles, growing structural diversities, and promising application potentials. For more information, see the Review by Z. Zhao, L. Chen et&#8197;al. on page&#8197;10781

         <dc:description>
The preservation of Cultural Heritage calls for tailored solutions to prevent the loss of this inheritance. Answering this call, materials and colloids sciences have been providing valid solutions. We review here the milestones and latest innovations in the development of advanced and nanomaterials for the remedial conservation of artifacts, illustrating successful case studies on classic and modern art, from archaeological sites and Renaissance frescos to Pablo Picasso and others. For more information, see the Minireview by D. Chelazzi and P. Baglioni on page&#8197;10798&#8201;ff.

         <dc:description>
Forged in fire. Flaming phosphorus is the hottest element of current Lewis and Br&#248;nsted superbase design. The electron abundancy makes these compounds highly important tools as ligands or as auxiliary bases in chemical catalysis and thus enables a great variety of so far unimagined chemical transformations. This synthetically informed minireview gives insight into the recent development of phosphorus&#8208;containing superbases, with especial focus on the past five years. For more information, see the Minireview by R.&#8197;F. Weitkamp and B. Hoge on page&#8197;10807&#8201;ff.

Ferrocenyl&#8208;substituted triarylmethylium dyes with electron&#8208;poor fluorenylium or thioxanthylium substituents go (di)radical: Judicious choice of the aryl substituents renders the redox potentials for ferrocenyl oxidation and triarylmethylium reduction so similar as to allow 4&#8208;Fc&#8208;C6H4&#8208;C+Ar2 cations to equilibrate with their paramagnetic valence isomers 4&#8208;FcC.+&#8208;C6H4&#8208;C.Ar2. These equilibria were studied by quantitative spin&#8208;counting methods and by M&#246;&#223;bauer spectroscopy. Our studies revealed that the diradicals and one&#8208;electron&#8208;reduced complexes 4&#8208;Fc&#8208;C6H4&#8208;CC.Ar2 dimerize to sizable or nearly quantitative extents.

Horizontally oriented thermally activated delayed fluorescent (TADF) emitters realizing high&#8208;performance sky&#8208;blue organic light&#8208;emitting devices (OLEDs) are reported in this work. The cover image represents that triphenyltriazine&#8208;based TADF emitters maximize the potential of sky&#8208;blue TADF OLEDs. The small structural differences in acceptor units makes a significant differences to device performance. More information can be found in the Full Paper by H. Sasabe, J. Kido et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.20101188).

Functional nanomaterials are indispensable to modern technologies and their low&#8208;temperature synthesis is a key&#8208;step to their incorporation in technologically advanced areas. In our pursuit to identify the reagents that are reactive at low temperature, we exploit here the inherent facile decomposition mechanism in the di&#8208;tertiary&#8208;butyl sulfide ligand as a strategy to obtain molecular complexes with ultra&#8208;low decomposition temperature and explore their application as facile precursors to highly crystalline metal sulfide or metallic nanoparticles. More information can be found in the Communication by S. Mishra et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202101471).

         <title>Donor&#8208;Acceptor Type Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>

Geometric structural and functional design of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) has been demonstrated as a powerful tool to construct various COFs with tailor&#8208;made properties. Regular arrangements of donor (D) and acceptor (A) moieties in D&#8722;A COFs render the formation of segregated D&#8722;A stacks, thus provides abundant pathways and channels for effective charge carriers transport. This review highlights the significant progress on D&#8722;A COFs over the past decade with emphasis on the design principles, growing structural diversities, and promising application potentials.







Abstract
Intermolecular charge transfer (ICT) effect has been widely studied in both small molecules and linear polymers. Covalently&#8208;bonded donor&#8208;acceptor pairs with tunable bandgaps and photoelectric properties endow these materials with potential applications in optoelectronics, fluorescent bioimaging, and sensors, etc. However, owing to the lack of charge transfer pathway or effective separation of charge carriers, unfavorable charge recombination gives rise to inevitable energy loss. Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) can be mediated with various geometry&#8208; and property&#8208;tailored building blocks, where donor (D) and acceptor (A) segments are connected by covalent bonds and can be finely arranged to form highly ordered networks (namely D&#8722;A COFs). The unique structural features of D&#8722;A COFs render the formation of segregated D&#8722;A stacks, thus provides pathways and channels for effective charge carriers transport. This review highlights the significant progress on D&#8722;A COFs over the past decade with emphasis on design principles, growing structural diversities, and promising application potentials.

         <title>Phosphorus&#8208;Containing Superbases: Recent Progress in the Chemistry of Electron&#8208;Abundant Phosphines and Phosphazenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 42, Page 10807-10825, July 26, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The hunt is still on for the most powerful neutral superbase. The steadily growing scope of applications has resulted in a renaissance of highly electron&#8208;rich phosphorus&#8208;containing Lewis and Br&#248;nsted bases. Strongly &#960;&#8208;donating substituents at the center of basicity can be employed to increase the proton affinity and the &#963;&#8208;donation ability. This minireview highlights recently published achievements focusing especially on the past five years.







Abstract
The renaissance of Br&#248;nsted superbases is primarily based on their pronounced capacity for a large variety of chemical transformations under mild reaction conditions. Four major set screws are available for the selective tuning of the basicity: the nature of the basic center (N, P, &#8230;), the degree of electron donation by substituents to the central atom, the possibility of charge delocalization, and the energy gain by hydrogen bonding. Within the past decades, a plethora of neutral electron&#8208;rich phosphine and phosphazene bases have appeared in the literature. Their outstanding properties and advantages over inorganic or charged bases have now made them indispensable as auxiliary bases in deprotonation processes. Herein, an update of the chemistry of basic phosphines and phosphazenes is given. In addition, due to widespread interest, their use in catalysis or as ligands in coordination chemistry is highlighted.

         <title>How Science Can Contribute to the Remedial Conservation of Cultural Heritage</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 42, Page 10798-10806, July 26, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Our society needs resilience to stand against social and environmental challenges. Cultural heritage assets are crucial as they foster socio&#8208;economical improvements; however, they are threatened by degradation. We summarize here some of the most valuable solutions science has provided to systematically tackle degradation and re&#8208;valorize our cultural patrimony, overcoming the serendipitous approach of past conservation practices.







Abstract
Colloid science is contributing solutions to counteract the degradation of artifacts, favoring their transfer to future generations. Advanced materials such as nanoparticles, coatings, gels and microemulsions have been assessed in conservation, spanning from archeological sites to modern and contemporary art. We give an overview of the fundamental milestones and latest innovations in conservation science, targeting solutions and tools for remedial conservation based on green nanomaterials and hybrid systems. Future perspectives and outstanding challenges in this exciting field are then outlined.

Concave concept: A helical metal&#8211;organic framework was prepared by using conformationally rigid tetratopic benzoic acid ligands with binding units pointing toward each other. To avoid intramolecular interactions between binding units, matching spacing groups were applied to introduce atropic repulsion, thus forming extended frameworks. With this new ligand design, a helical MOF with significantly improved air and moisture stability was prepared, thereby providing a new strategy for ligand design for the construction of porous materials.







Abstract
A helical metal&#8208;organic framework was prepared by using a conformationally rigid tetratopic benzoic acid ligand with binding units pointing toward each other (concave ligand). To avoid the obvious intramolecular interactions between binding units, matching spacing groups were applied to introduce atropic repulsion, thereby allowing the formation of extended frameworks for the first time. With this new ligand design, a helical&#8208;shaped MOF with significantly improved air and moisture stability was successfully prepared, thus providing a new strategy for ligand design toward porous material constructions.

         <title>Coinage Metal Complexes with Di&#8208;tertiary&#8208;butyl Sulfide as Precursors with Ultra&#8208;Low Decomposition Temperature</title>

Simple, but efficient: Inherent facile decomposition mechanism in the tBu2S ligand is exploited to obtain molecular precursors that decompose at low&#8208; or even room temperature to afford metal sulfide or metallic nanoparticles. Easily extendable to other systems, this strategy can be used to obtain metastable or compositionally complex nanomaterials with greater control and incorporate them in technologies that are sensitive to harsh conditions.







Abstract
We report here the synthesis of [Cu2(TFA)4(tBu2S)2] (1), [Ag4(TFA)4(tBu2S)4] (2) and [AuCl(tBu2S)] (3) (TFA=trifluoroacetate), which decompose in solution medium at ultra&#8208;low temperature (e.&#8201;g., in boiling toluene) to afford phase&#8208;pure and highly crystalline Cu9S5, Ag2S and metallic Au nanoparticles, respectively. The low decomposition temperature of these precursors is attributed to the facile decomposition mechanism in the di&#8208;tertiary&#8208;butyl sulfide ligand. These results are a significant step in the direction of establishing a general low&#8208;temperature strategy spanning a range of systems including thermodynamically metastable materials and incorporate them in technologies that are sensitive to the harsh conditions.

         <title>Stereoretentive N&#8208;Arylation of Amino Acid Esters with Cyclohexanones Utilizing a Continuous&#8208;Flow System</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 42, Page 10844-10848, July 26, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stereoretentive N&#8208;arylation of chiral amino acid esters with cyclohexanones as halogen&#8208;free aryl sources was performed under continuous&#8208;flow conditions. The designed flow system, comprising a coil reactor and a packed&#8208;bed reactor containing a Pd(OH)2/C catalyst, efficiently afforded the desired N&#8208;arylated amino acid products without significant racemization, accompanied by only small amounts of easily removable co&#8208;products. This method allowed for the continuous synthesis of the desired product in very high yield and enantiopurity for at least 3&#8197;days.







Abstract
The N&#8208;arylation of chiral amino acid esters with minimal racemization is a challenging transformation because of the sensitivity of the &#945;&#8208;stereocenter. A versatile synthetic method was developed to prepare N&#8208;arylated amino acid esters using cyclohexanones as aryl sources under continuous&#8208;flow conditions. The designed flow system, which consists of a coil reactor and a packed&#8208;bed reactor containing a Pd(OH)2/C catalyst, efficiently afforded the desired N&#8208;arylated amino acids without significant racemization, accompanied by only small amounts of easily removable co&#8208;products (i.&#8201;e., H2O and alkanes). The efficiency and robustness of this method allowed for the continuous synthesis of the desired product in very high yield and enantiopurity with high space&#8208;time yield (74.1&#8197;g&#8201;L&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1) and turnover frequency (5.9&#8197;h&#8722;1) for at least 3&#8197;days.

The production of synthetically valuable ArCF2X and ArCX3 compounds from ArCF3 using catalytic iron(III)halides is described, which constitutes the first iron&#8208;catalyzed halogen exchange of non&#8208;aromatic C&#8722;F bonds. Theoretical calculations suggest direct activation of C&#8722;F bonds by iron coordination. To optimize for mono&#8208;exchange, a statistical analysis called Design of Experiments was used. Optimized parameters were successfully applied to both electron&#8208;rich and electron&#8208;deficient aromatic substrates, and to the late&#8208;stage diversification of flufenoxuron, a commercial insecticide.

         <title>Competing Effects of Chlorination on the Strength of Te&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O Chalcogen Bonds Select the Structure of Mixed Supramolecular Macrocyclic Aggregates of Iso&#8208;Tellurazole N&#8208;Oxides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 42, Page 10849-10853, July 26, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chlorination of tellurium has opposing effects on the formation of chalcogen bonds (ChBs) by iso&#8208;tellurazole N&#8208;oxides, enhancing their strength as ChB donors but weakening their role as ChB acceptors. The net effect is that the fully chlorinated tetramer is barely more stable than the non&#8208;halogenated macrocycle. In contrast, partial halogenation results in a more stable alternating structure.







Abstract
Chlorination of 3&#8208;methyl&#8208;5&#8208;phenyl&#8208;1,2&#8208;tellurazole&#8208;2&#8208;oxide yielded the &#955;4Te dichloro derivative.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Chlorination of tellurium&lt;/b&gt; has opposing effects on the formation of chalcogen bonds (ChBs) by iso-tellurazole &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-oxides, enhancing their strength as ChB donors but weakening their role as ChB acceptors. The net effect is that the fully chlorinated tetramer is barely more stable than the non-halogenated macrocycle. In contrast, partial halogenation results in a more stable alternating structure.

&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Structure and functional differences of cysteine and 3&#8208;mercaptopropionate dioxygenases. A computational study.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Thiol dioxygenases are important enzymes for human health involved in the detoxification and catabolism of toxic thiol&#8208;containing natural products such as cysteine, which has relevance to the development of Alzheimer&#8217;s and Parkinson&#8217;s diseases in the brain. Recent crystal structure coordinates of cysteine and 3&#8208;mercaptopropionate dioxygenase (CDO and MDO) showed major differences in the second&#8208;coordination spheres of the two enzymes. To understand the difference in activity between these two analogous enzymes, we created large active site cluster models. We show that CDO and MDO have different iron(III)&#8208;superoxo bound structures due to differences in ligand coordination. Furthermore, our studies show that the differences in the second&#8208;coordination sphere and particularly the position of a positively charged Arg residue results in changes of substrate positioning, mobility and enzymatic turnover. Furthermore, the substrate scope of MDO is explored with cysteinate and 2&#8208;mercaptosuccinic acid and their reactivity is predicted.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly Sensitive Fluorescent pH Microsensors Based on the Ratiometric Dye Pyranine Immobilized on Silica Microparticles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In a one&#8208;step synthesis, silica microparticles with efficiently immobilized pyranine (HPTS) dye gave extremely sensitive fluorescent ratiometric pH sensors. Immobilizing dye molecules on oppositely charged silica microparticles by using a positively charged silica shell preserves HPTS&#8242;S pH sensitivity, and also enhances the stability of the sensor particles. The effect of microparticle surface charge manipulation on enhancing the pH sensitivity without perturbing the stability and cytocompatibility is explored.







Abstract
Pyranine (HPTS) is a remarkably interesting pH&#8208;sensitive dye that has been used for plenty of applications. Its high quantum yield and extremely sensitive ratiometric fluorescence against pH change makes it a very favorable for pH&#8208;sensing applications and the development of pH nano&#8208;/microsensors. However, its strong negative charge and lack of easily modifiable functional groups makes it difficult to use with charged substrates such as silica. This study reports a methodology for noncovalent HPTS immobilization on silica microparticles that considers the retention of pH sensitivity as well as the long&#8208;term stability of the pH microsensors. The study emphasizes the importance of surface charge for governing the sensitivity of the immobilized HPTS dye molecules on silica microparticles. The importance of the immobilization methodology, which preserves the sensitivity and stability of the microsensors, is also assessed.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed C&#8722;H Bond Arylation of Cyclometalated Difluorinated 2&#8208;Arylisoquinolinyl Iridium(III) Complexes</title>

         <dc:description>
Catalysis&#8208;on&#8208;the&#8208;complex was developed to incorporate diversely substituted aryl group on the ligands of neutral cyclometalated Ir(III) complexes. The regioselectivity of Pd&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H bond arylation is not affected by C&#8722;Ir bond, as the reaction occurred at the C&#8722;H bond flanked by the two&#8208;fluorine atoms. All post&#8208;functionalized Ir(III) exhibit red phosphorescence with moderate to good efficiency.







Abstract
The utility of C&#8722;H bond functionalization of metalated ligands for the elaboration of aryl&#8208;functionalized difluorinated&#8208;1&#8208;arylisoquinolinyl Ir(III) complexes has been explored. Bis[(3,5&#8208;difluorophenyl)isoquinolinyl](2,2,6,6&#8208;tetramethyl&#8208;3,5&#8208;heptanedionato) iridium(III) undergoes Pd&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H bond arylation with aryl bromides. The reaction regioselectively occurred at the C&#8722;H bond flanked by the two fluorine atoms of the difluoroaryl unit, and on both cyclometalated ligands. This post&#8208;functionalization gives a straightforward access to modified complexes in only one manipulation and allows to introduce thermally sensitive functional groups, such as trifluoromethyl, nitrile, benzoyl, or ester. The X&#8208;ray crystallography, photophysical, and electrochemical properties of the diarylated complexes were investigated. Whatever the nature of the incorporated substituted aryl groups is, all obtained complexes emit red phosphorescence (622&#8211;632&#8197;nm) with similar lifetimes (1.9&#8211;2&#8197;&#956;s).

         <title>Controlling Site&#8208;Directed RNA Editing by Chemically Induced Dimerization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
RNA editing: Site&#8208;directed adenosine&#8208;to&#8208;inosine RNA editing was engineered to be under control of the plant hormone gibberellic acid, applying the mechanism of chemically induced dimerization. Tight control and editing yields up to 44&#8201;% where achieved on endogenous targets in human cell culture.







Abstract
Various RNA&#8208;targeting approaches have been engineered to modify specific sites on endogenous transcripts, breaking new ground for a variety of basic research tools and promising clinical applications in the future. Here, we combine site&#8208;directed adenosine&#8208;to&#8208;inosine RNA editing with chemically induced dimerization. Specifically, we achieve tight and dose&#8208;dependent control of the editing reaction with gibberellic acid, and obtain editing yields up to 20&#8201;% and 44&#8201;% in the endogenous STAT1 and GAPDH transcript in cell culture.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;RNA editing&lt;/b&gt;: Site-directed adenosine-to-inosine RNA editing was engineered to be under control of the plant hormone gibberellic acid, applying the mechanism of chemically induced dimerization. Tight control and editing yields up to 44&#8201;% where achieved on endogenous targets in human cell culture.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Various RNA-targeting approaches have been engineered to modify specific sites on endogenous transcripts, breaking new ground for a variety of basic research tools and promising clinical applications in the future. Here, we combine site-directed adenosine-to-inosine RNA editing with chemically induced dimerization. Specifically, we achieve tight and dose-dependent control of the editing reaction with gibberellic acid, and obtain editing yields up to 20&#8201;% and 44&#8201;% in the endogenous STAT1 and GAPDH transcript in cell culture. Furthermore, the disease-relevant MECP2 R106Q mutation was repaired with editing yields up to 42&#8201;%. The introduced principle will enable new applications where temporal or spatiotemporal control of an RNA-targeting mechanism is desired.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>C&#8722;C Cross&#8208;couplings from a Cyclometalated Au(III) C^N complex: Mechanistic Insights and Synthetic Developments</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In recent years, the reactivity of gold complexes was shown to extend well beyond&#160; p &#8208;activation and to holds promises to achieve selective cross&#8208;couplings in several C&#8211;C and C&#8211;E (E = heteroatom) bond forming reactions. Here, with the aim of exploiting new organometallic species for cross&#8208;coupling reactions, we report on the Au(III)&#8208;mediated C(sp  2  )&#8211;C(sp) occurring upon reaction of the cyclometalated complex [Au(C  CH2  N)Cl  2  ] (1, C  CH2  N = 2&#8208;benzylpyridine) with AgPhCC. The reaction progress has been monitored by NMR spectroscopy, demonstrating the involvement of a number of key intermediates, whose structures have been unambiguously ascertained&#160;  via  &#160;1D and 2D NMR analyses as well as by HR&#8208;ESI&#8208;MS and X&#8208;ray diffraction studies. Furthermore, crystallographic studies have serendipitously resulted in the authentication of zwitterionic Au(I) complexes as side&#8208;products arising from cyclization of the coupling product in the coordination sphere of gold. The experimental work has been paralleled and complemented by DFT calculations of the reaction profiles, providing valuable insight into the structure and energetics of the key intermediates and transition states, as well as on the coordination sphere of gold along the whole process. Of note, the broader scope of the cross&#8208;coupling at the Au(III) C  CH2  N centre has also been demonstrated studying the reaction of&#160;1&#160;with C(sp  2  )&#8208;based nucleophiles, namely vinyl and heteroaryl tin and zinc reagents.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein we describe a gold&#8208;catalyzed cascade cyclization of Boc&#8208;protected benzylamines bearing two tethered alkyne moieties via a domino reaction initiated by a 6&#8208; endo&#8208;dig  cyclization. The reaction was screened intensively and the scope was explored, resulting in nine new Boc&#8208;protected dihydrobenzo[ c  ]phenanthridines with yields of up to 98%; even a &#960;&#8208;extension and two bidirectional approaches were successful. Furthermore, a thermal cleavage of the Boc&#8208;group and subsequent oxidation was possible to obtain substituted benzo[ c  ]phenanthridines in up to quantitative yields. Two bidirectional approaches were successful using the optimized conditions and the resulting &#960;&#8208;extended molecules were tested as organic semiconductors in organic thin&#8208;film transistors.</dc:description>

         <title>Mapping the Electronic Structure and the Reactivity Trends for Stabilized &#945;&#8208;Boryl Carbanions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Carbanion cartography: This study maps the stability/reactivity space for &#945;&#8208;boryl carbanions leading to the prediction of novel species. Free carbanionic intermediates can be described as borata&#8208;alkene species with a C&#8722;B &#960;&#8208;interaction strongly polarized towards the carbon, whereas multi&#8208;boryl species have very polar C&#8722;B bonds. Extensive analysis of &#945;&#8208;boryl alkylidene metal precursors identifies three structural patterns that can be related to reactivity.







Abstract
The chemistry of stabilized &#945;&#8208;boryl carbanions shows remarkable diversity, and can enable many different synthetic routes towards efficient C&#8722;C bond formation. The electron&#8208;deficient, trivalent boron center stabilizes the carbanion facilitating its generation and tuning its reactivity. Here, the electronic structure and the reactivity trends of a large dataset of &#945;&#8208;boryl carbanions are described. DFT&#8208;derived parameters were used to capture their electronic and steric properties, computational reactivity towards model substrates, and crystallographic analysis within the Cambridge Structural Dataset. This study maps the reactivity space by systematically varying the nature of the boryl moiety, the substituents of the carbanionic center, the number of &#945;&#8208;boryl motifs, and the metal counterion. In general, the free carbanionic intermediates are described as borata&#8208;alkene species with C&#8722;B &#960; interactions polarized towards the carbon. Furthermore, it was possible to classify the &#945;&#8208;boryl alkylidene metal precursors into three classes directly related to their reactivity: 1)&#8197;nucleophilic borata&#8208;alkene salts with alkali and alkaline earth metals, 2)&#8197;nucleophilic &#951;2&#8208;(C&#8722;B) borata&#8208;alkene complexes with early transition metals, Cu and Ag, and 3)&#8197;&#945;&#8208;boryl alkyl complexes with late transition metals. This trend map aids selection of the appropriate reactive synthon depending on the reactivity sought.

         <title>Peptide Cyclization Mediated by Metal&#8208;Free S&#8208;Arylation: S&#8208;Protected Cysteine Sulfoxide as an Umpolung of Cysteine Nucleophile</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Covalent linking of side chains provides a method to produce cyclic or stapling peptides that are important in developing peptide&#8208;based drugs. A variety of crosslinking formats contribute to fixing the active conformer and prolonging its biological activity under physiological conditions. One format uses the cysteine (Cys) thiol to participate in crosslinking through nucleophilic thiolate anions or thiyl radicals to form thioether and disulfide bonds. Removal of the S&#8208;protection from an S&#8208;protected Cys derivative generates the thiol which functions as a nucleophile. S&#8208;Oxidation of a protected Cys allows the formation of a sulfoxide that operates as an umpolung electrophile. Herein, the applicability of S&#8208;  p  &#8208;methoxybenzyl Cys sulfoxide (Cys(MBzl)(O)) to the formation of thioether linkage between tryptophan (Trp) and Cys has been investigated. The reaction of peptides containing Cys(MBzl)(O) and Trp with trifluoromethanesulfonic acid (TFMSA) or methanesulfonic acid (MSA) in TFA in the presence of guanidine hydrochloride (Gn&#183;HCl) proceeded to give cyclic or stapling peptides possessing the Cys&#8211;Trp thioether linkage. In this reaction, strong acids such as TFMSA or MSA are necessary to activate the sulfoxide. Additionally, Gn&#183;HCl plays a critical role in producing an electrophilic Cys derivative that combines with the indole by aromatic electrophilic substitution. The findings led us to conclude that the less electrophilic Cys(MBzl)(O) serves as an acid&#8208;activated umpolung of Cys nucleophile and is useful for S&#8208;arylation&#8208;mediated peptide cyclization.</dc:description>

         <title>Stepwise stress&#8208;induced transformations of metal&#8208;organic polyhedral cluster&#8208;based assemblies: Where conformational and supramolecular features meet</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The understanding of factors governing the formation of supramolecular structures and phase transitions between various forms of molecular crystals is pivotal for developing dynamic, stimuli&#8208;responsive materials and polymorph&#8208;controlled syntheses. Here, we investigate the pressure&#8208;induced dynamic of both the intrinsic molecular structure and the supramolecular network of a predesigned polyhedral oxo&#8208;centered zinc cluster incorporating monoanionic N,N&#8217;&#8208;diphenylformamidinate and featuring the N&#8208;bonded phenyl groups in close proximity of the primary coordination sphere. We demonstrate that the model oxo cluster is prone to undergo pressure&#8208;induced conformational transformations of the secondary coordination sphere and simultaneous stepwise (initially every second polyhedral molecule undergoes the conformational transformations) and reversible transitions from an ambient phase &#945; to high&#8208;pressure phases &#946; and &#947;, as single crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single crystal events. The observed phase transitions nicely illustrate the key role of an interplay between low&#8208;energy conformational perturbations and cooperative intra&#8208; and intermolecular noncovalent interactions.</dc:description>

The observed phase transitions nicely illustrate the key role of an interplay between low-energy conformational perturbations and cooperative intra- and intermolecular noncovalent interactions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>New Ideas for Understanding the Structure and Magnetism in AgF2: Prediction of Ferroelasticity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In the search for new high&#8208;temperature superconductors it has been proposed that there are strong similarities between the fluoroargentate AgF2  and the cuprate La2CuO4. As a novelty we explore the origin of the possible layered structure of AgF2  by studying its parent high&#8208;symmetry phase and comparing these results with those of a seemingly analogous cuprate, CuF2  . Our findings first stress the large differences between CuF2  and AgF2  . Indeed, the parent structure of AgF2  is found to be cubic, naturally devoid of any layering, even though Ag2+  ions occupy trigonal sites which, nevertheless, allow the existence of a Jahn&#8208;Teller effect. The observed Pbca orthorhombic phase is found when the system is cooperatively distorted by a local Exe trigonal Jahn&#8208;Teller effect around the silver sites that creates both the geometrical and magnetic layering. While the distortion implies that two Ag2+  &#8208;F&#8208;  bonds increase their distance by 15% and become softer, our simulations indicate that covalent bonding and interlayer electron hopping is strong, unlike the situation in cuprate superconductors and that, in fact, exfoliation of individual planes may be a harder task than previously suggested. As a salient feature, the present results prove that the actual magnetic structure in AgF2  is a direct consequence of vibronic contributions involved in the Jahn&#8208;Teller effect. Finally, our findings show that, due to the multiple minima intrinsic to the Jahn&#8208;Teller energy surface, the system is ferroelastic, a property that is strongly coupled to magnetism in this argentate.</dc:description>

         <title>Labeling and Probing the Silica Surface Using Mechanochemistry and 17O&#8197;NMR Spectroscopy**
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fast, user&#8208;friendly 17O enrichment approach by ball milling was developed to selectively enrich the surface of fumed silica. A variety of high&#8208;resolution solid&#8208;state 17O&#8197;NMR experiments (ultra&#8208;high magnetic field (35.2&#8197;T), 17O&#8197;MQMAS, 2D&#8197;17O&#8722;1H&#8197;D&#8208;HMQC, 17O&#8197;DNP), demonstrate that siloxane and different silanol bonds present at the surface, including H&#8208;bonded and isolated silanols, can be labeled and characterized in detail.







Abstract
In recent years, there has been increasing interest in developing cost&#8208;efficient, fast, and user&#8208;friendly 17O enrichment protocols to help to understand the structure and reactivity of materials by using 17O&#8197;NMR spectroscopy. Here, we show for the first time how ball milling (BM) can be used to selectively and efficiently enrich the surface of fumed silica, which is widely used at industrial scale. Short milling times (up to 15&#8197;min) allowed modulation of the enrichment level (up to ca. 5&#8201;%) without significantly changing the nature of the material. High&#8208;precision 17O compositions were measured at different milling times by using large&#8208;geometry secondary&#8208;ion mass spectrometry (LG&#8208;SIMS). High&#8208;resolution 17O&#8197;NMR analyses (including at 35.2&#8197;T) allowed clear identification of the signals from siloxane (Si&#8722;O&#8722;Si) and silanols (Si&#8722;OH), while DNP analyses, performed by using direct 17O polarization and indirect 17O{1H}&#8197;CP excitation, agreed with selective labeling of the surface. Information on the distribution of Si&#8722;OH environments at the surface was obtained from 2D 1H&#8722;17O D&#8208;HMQC correlations. Finally, the surface&#8208;labeled silica was reacted with titania and using 17O DNP, their common interface was probed and Si&#8722;O&#8722;Ti bonds identified.

         <title>Humins with Efficient Electromagnetic Wave Absorption: A By&#8208;Product of Furfural Conversion to Isopropyl Levulinate via a Tandem Catalytic Reaction in One&#8208;Pot</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The by&#8208;product (called humins) is accompanied by a one&#8208;pot catalytic conversion reaction of furfural (FAL) to isopropyl levulinate (PL), which is carbonized (Humins&#8208;700) and applied to a new experiment of electromagnetic wave absorption, showing superior electromagnetic wave absorption performance. The minimum reflection loss (RLmin) value is &#8722;47.3 dB at 13.0 GHz with a thickness of 2.0&#8197;mm. This provides inspiration that humins can be applied to electromagnetic wave absorption.







Abstract
Both one&#8208;pot catalytic conversion of furfural (FAL) to isopropyl levulinate (PL) and carbonization of by&#8208;product (humins) for electromagnetic wave absorption are discussed, which provides inspiration that humins can be applied to electromagnetic wave absorption. In the former, phosphotungstic acid (PW) is employed as a homogeneous catalyst to convert FAL to PL via a tandem reaction in one pot, with the formation of a vast amount of humins. With FAL and various intermediates as substrates, it was found that humins was a polymerization product of FAL, furfuryl alcohol (FOL) and furfuryl ester (FE) with furan rings. In addition, the in&#8197;situ attenuated total reflection infrared (ATR&#8208;IR) spectra also provided a basis for the proposed reaction route. In the latter, with the humins as raw material, P species and WO3 doped nano&#8208;porous carbon (Humins&#8208;700) platform formed after high&#8208;temperature annealing is used for electromagnetic wave absorption and manifests desirable absorption performance. The minimum reflection loss (RLmin) value is &#8722;47.3 dB at 13.0 GHz with a thickness of 2.0&#8197;mm and the effective absorption bandwidth reaches 4.5 GHz (11.2&#8211;5.7 GHz).

Look both ways after crossing: A pyrrolopyrrole azadipyrrin with a Janus duality (Janus&#8208;PPAD) resulting from the hydrogen&#8208;bonding ketopyrrole and metal&#8208;coordinating azadipyrrin moieties was synthesized by a Schiff base&#8211;forming reaction of diketopyrrolopyrrole and azaarylamine. In addition to the self&#8208;complementary assembly, the cobalt complex functions as a single&#8208;molecule magnet in the presence of a static magnetic field.







Abstract
A novel pyrrolopyrrole azadipyrrin (Janus&#8208;PPAD) with Janus duality was synthesized by a Schiff base&#8211;forming reaction of diketopyrrolopyrrole. The orthogonal interactions of the hydrogen&#8208;bonding ketopyrrole and metal&#8208;coordinating azadipyrrin moieties in Janus&#8208;PPAD enabled the metal ions to be arranged at regular intervals: zinc(II) and cobalt(II) coordination provided metal&#8208;coordinated Janus&#8208;PPAD dimers, which can subsequently form hydrogen&#8208;bonded one&#8208;dimensional arrays both in solution and in the solid state. The supramolecular assembly of the zinc(II) complex in solution was investigated by 1H NMR spectroscopy based on the isodesmic model, in which a binding constant for the elongation of assemblies is constant. Owing to the tetrahedral coordination, in the solid state, the cobalt(II) complex exhibited a slow magnetic relaxation due to the negative D value of &#8722;27.1&#8197;cm&#8722;1 with an effective relaxation energy barrier Ueff of 38.0&#8197;cm&#8722;1. The effect of magnetic dilution on the relaxation behavior is discussed. The relaxation mechanism at low temperature was analyzed by considering spin lattice interactions and quantum tunneling effects. The easy&#8208;axis magnetic anisotropy was confirmed, and the relevant wave functions were obtained by ab initio CASSCF calculations.

         <title>Photoredox Catalysis Using Heterogenized Iridium Complexes**
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Heterogenized iridium catalysts were synthesized to generate reusable, robust photoredox catalysts. The catalyst architecture, in nanopowder or thin film forms, was studied to see how it affected the catalytic performance on three different metal oxide surfaces. Reductive dehalogenation of bromoacetophenone to acetophenone was studied as the model photoredox reaction, and all catalysts showed successful product generation. Al2O3&#8208;based catalysts were found to be the most robust and reusable catalysts in both architectures, with at least &#8764;1000 turnovers and reusable three times.







Abstract
Heterogenized photoredox catalysts provide a path for sustainable chemical synthesis using highly tunable, reusable constructs. Here, heterogenized iridium complexes as photoredox catalysts were assembled via covalent attachment to metal oxide surfaces (ITO, ZrO2, Al2O3) in thin film or nanopowder constructs. The goal was to understand which materials provided the most promising constructs for catalysis. To do this, reductive dehalogenation of bromoacetophenone to acetophenone was studied as a test reaction for system optimization. All catalyst constructs produced acetophenone with high conversions and yields with the fastest reactions complete in fifteen minutes using Al2O3 supports. The nanopowder catalysts resulted in faster and more efficient catalysis, while the thin film catalysts were more robust and easily reused. Importantly, the thin film constructs show promise for future photoelectrochemical and electrochemical photoredox setups. Finally, all catalysts were reusable 2&#8211;3 times, performing at least 1000 turnovers (Al2O3), demonstrating that heterogenized catalysts are a sustainable catalyst alternative.

         <title>Factors Controlling the Aluminum(I)&#8208;meta&#8208;Selective C&#8722;H Activation in Arenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The factors controlling the so&#8208;far poorly understood complete meta&#8208;selectivity observed in the C&#8722;H activation reactions of alkylarenes promoted by different aluminyl anions are revealed by state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art computational methods.







Abstract
The so far poorly understood factors controlling the complete meta&#8208;selectivity observed in the C&#8722;H activation reactions of alkylarenes promoted by aluminyl anions have been explored in detail by means of Density Functional Theory calculations. To this end, a combination of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art computational methods, namely the activation strain model of reactivity and energy decomposition analysis, has been applied to quantitatively unveil the origin of the selectivity of the transformation as well as the influence of the associated potassium cation. It is found that the selectivity takes place during the initial nucleophilic addition step where the key LP(Al)&#8594;&#960;*(C=C) molecular orbital interaction is more stabilizing for the meta&#8208;pathway, which results in a stronger interaction between the reactants along the entire transformation.

         <title>Structural Transformation of Surface&#8208;Confined Porphyrin Networks by Addition of Co Atoms</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The structural transformation of a porphyrin&#8208;based two&#8208;dimensional network from its H&#8208;bonded phase to a porous metal&#8208;coordinated phase after the addition of Co&#8208;atoms on Au(111) under ultra&#8208;high vacuum conditions was inverstigated. The networks were characterized by scanning tunneling microscopy, low&#8208;energy electron diffraction and X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy.







Abstract
The self&#8208;assembly of a nickel&#8208;porphyrin derivative (Ni&#8208;DPPyP) containing two pyridyl coordinating sites and two pentyl chains at trans meso positions was studied with scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and low energy electron diffraction (LEED) on Au(111). Deposition of Ni&#8208;DPPyP onto Au(111) gave rise to a close&#8208;packed network for coverages smaller or equal to one monolayer as revealed by STM and LEED. The molecular arrangement of this two&#8208;dimensional network is stabilized via hydrogen bonds formed between the pyridyl's nitrogen and hydrogen atoms from the pyrrole groups of neighboring molecules. Subsequent deposition of cobalt atoms onto the close&#8208;packed network and post&#8208;deposition annealing at 423&#8197;K led to the formation of a Co&#8208;coordinated hexagonal porous network. As confirmed by XPS measurements, the porous network is stabilized by metal&#8208;ligand interactions between one cobalt atom and three pyridyl ligands, each pyridyl ligand coming from a different Ni&#8208;DPPyP molecule.

         <title>Controlling Antibacterial Activity Exclusively with Visible Light: Introducing a Tetra&#8208;ortho&#8208;Chloro&#8208;Azobenzene Amino Acid</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel photoswitchable amino acid has provided access to tyrocidine&#8197;A analogues fully operated under visible light. This has led to linear analogues that have shown good photoswitchability and strain selectivity against A. baumannii and S. pyogenes clinical strains by using different analogues. Activated cis compounds turn back to their deactivated trans form upon short exposure times to sunlight, paving the way to self&#8208;deactivating antibacterials with minor evolutionary pressure on the environment.







Abstract
The introduction of a novel tetra&#8208;ortho&#8208;chloroazobenzene amino acid (CEBA) has enabled photoswitching of the antimicrobial activity of tyrocidine&#8197;A analogues by using exclusively visible light, granting spatiotemporal control under benign conditions. Compounds bearing this photoswitchable amino acid become active upon irradiation with red light, but quickly turn&#8208;off upon exposure to other visible light wavelengths. Critically, sunlight quickly triggers isomerisation of the red light&#8208;activated compounds into their original trans form, offering an ideal platform for self&#8208;deactivation upon release into the environment. Linear analogues of tyrocidine&#8197;A were found to provide the best photocontrol of their antimicrobial activity, leading to compounds active against Acinetobacter baumannii upon isomerisation. Exploration of their N&#8208; and C&#8208;termini has provided insights into key elements of their structure and has allowed obtaining new antimicrobials displaying excellent strain selectivity and photocontrol.

Fine tunable Pd8 chains supported by linear tetraphosphine (meso&#8208;dpmppm), [Pd8(meso&#8208;dpmppm)4(L)2]4+ (L=none (1), solvent (2), RNC (3)) and [Pd8(meso&#8208;dpmppm)4(X)2]2+ (X&#8722;=(pseudo)halide (4)) were systematically synthesized and exhibited wide range redox behaviors from {Pd4}4+ to {Pd4}0 through {Pd8}4+, {Pd8}3+, and {Pd8}2+ strings and led by treatment with bisisocyanide (BI) in CH3CN to dynamical 1D assembly of {[Pd8(meso&#8208;dpmppm)4(BI)](BF4)4}n.







Abstract
A series of the octapalladium chains supported by meso&#8208;Ph2PCH2P(Ph)CH2P(Ph)CH2PPh2 (meso&#8208;dpmppm) ligands, [Pd8(meso&#8208;dpmppm)4(L)2](BF4)4 (L=none (1), solvents: CH3CN (2&#8201;a), dmf (2&#8201;b), dmso (2&#8201;c), RN&#8801;C: R=Xyl (3&#8201;a), Mes (3&#8201;b), Dip (3&#8201;c), tBu (3&#8201;d), Cy (3&#8201;e), CH3(CH2)7 (3&#8201;f), CH3(CH2)11 (3&#8201;g), CH3(CH2)17 (3&#8201;h)) and [Pd8(meso&#8208;dpmppm)4(X)2](BF4)2 (X=Cl (4&#8201;a), N3 (4&#8201;b), CN (4&#8201;c), SCN (4&#8201;d)), were synthesized by using 2&#8201;a as a stable good precursor, and characterized by spectroscopic (IR, 1H and 31P&#8197;NMR, UV&#8208;vis&#8208;NIR, ESI&#8208;MS) measurements and X&#8208;ray crystallographic analyses (for 1, 2&#8201;a,&#8201;b, 3&#8201;a,&#8201;b,&#8201;e,&#8201;f, 4&#8201;a&#8211;d). On the basis of DFT calculations on the X&#8208;ray determined structure of 2&#8201;b ([2b&#8208;Pd8]4+) and the optimized models [Pd8(meso&#8208;Ph2PCH2P(H)CH2P(H)CH2PH2)4(CH3CN)2]4+ ([Pd8Ph8]4+) and [Pd8(meso&#8208;H2PCH2P(H)CH2P(H)CH2PH2)4(CH3CN)2]4+ ([Pd8H8]4+), with and without empirically calculating dispersion force stabilization energy (B3LYP&#8208;D3, B3LYP), the formation energy between the two Pd4 fragments is assumed to involve mainly noncovalent interactions (ca. &#8722;70&#8197;kcal/mol) with four sets of interligand C&#8722;H/&#960; interactions and Pd&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Pd metallophilic one, while electron shared covalent interactions are almost canceled out within the Pd8 chain. All the compounds isolated are stable in solution and exhibit characteristic absorption at &#8764;900&#8197;nm, which is assignable to a spin allowed HOMO to LUMO transition, and shows temperature dependent intensity change with variable absorption coefficients presumably due to coupling with some thermal vibrations. The structures and electronic states of the Pd8 chains are found finely tunable by varying the terminal capping ligands. In particular, theoretical calculations elucidated that the HOMO&#8208;LUMO energy gap is systematically related to the central Pd&#8722;Pd distance (2.7319(6)&#8211;2.7575(6)&#8197;&#197;) by two ways with neutral ligands L (1, 2, 3) and with anionic ligands X (4), which are reflected on the NIR absorption energy of 867&#8211;954&#8197;nm. The isocyanide terminated Pd8 complexes (3) further reacted with excess of RNC (6 eq) to afford the Pd4 complexes, [Pd4(meso&#8208;dpmppm)2(RNC)2](BF4)2 (13), and the cyclic voltammograms of 2&#8201;a (L=CH3CN), 3, and 13 (R=Xyl, Mes, tBu, Cy) demonstrated wide range redox behaviors from 2{Pd4}4+ to 2{Pd4}0 through 2{Pd4}2+&#8596;{Pd8}4+, {Pd8}3+, and {Pd8}2+ strings. The oxidized complexes, [Pd4(meso&#8208;dpmppm)2(RNC)3](BF4)4 (16), were characterized by X&#8208;ray analyses, and the two&#8208;electron reduced chain of [Pd8(meso&#8208;dpmppm)4](BF4)2 (7) was analyzed by spectroscopic and electrochemical techniques and DFT calculations. Reactions of 2&#8201;a with 1&#8197;equiv. of aromatic linear bisisocyanide (BI) in CH2Cl2 deposited insoluble coordination polymers, {[Pd8(meso&#8208;dpmppm)4(BI)](BF4)4}n (5), and interestingly, they were soluble in acetonitrile, 31P{1H} and 1H&#8197;DOSY NMR spectra as well as SAXS curves suggesting that the coordination polymers may exist in acetonitrile as dynamically 1D self&#8208;assembled coordination polymers comprising ca. 50&#8197;units of the Pd8 rod averaged within the timescale.

Tracking your delivery: Molecular constructs are able to combine light&#8208;regulated release of nitric oxide (NO) with fluorescent reporting functionality to track and quantify in real time the amount of NO delivered, even in complex biological environments, are described, highlighting the logical design and their potential therapeutic applications.







Abstract
Nitric oxide (NO) plays a multifaceted role in human physiology and pathophysiology, and its controlled delivery has great prospects in therapeutic applications. The light&#8208;activated uncaging of NO from NO caging compounds allows this free radical to be released with accurate control of site and dosage, which strictly determine its biological effects. Molecular constructs able to activate fluorescence concomitantly to NO release offer the important advantage of easy and real&#8208;time tracking of the amount of NO uncaged in a non&#8208;invasive fashion even in the cell environment. This contribution provides an overview of the advances in photoactivatable NO releasers bearing fluorescent reporting functionalities achieved in our and other laboratories, highlighting the rationale design and their potential therapeutic applications.

         <title>Remodeling of the Fibrillation Pathway of &#945;&#8208;Synuclein by Interaction with Antimicrobial Peptide LL&#8208;III</title>

Avoiding fibrils: The cationic antimicrobial peptide LL&#8208;III stabilizes droplet condensates formed by &#945;&#8208;synuclein, thereby impeding their transformation to the fibrillar amyloid state.







Abstract
Liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation (LLPS) has emerged as a key mechanism for intracellular organization, and many recent studies have provided important insights into the role of LLPS in cell biology. There is also evidence that LLPS is associated with a variety of medical conditions, including neurodegenerative disorders. Pathological aggregation of &#945;&#8208;synuclein, which is causally linked to Parkinson's disease, can proceed via droplet condensation, which then gradually transitions to the amyloid state. We show that the antimicrobial peptide LL&#8208;III is able to interact with both monomers and condensates of &#945;&#8208;synuclein, leading to stabilization of the droplet and preventing conversion to the fibrillar state. The anti&#8208;aggregation activity of LL&#8208;III was also confirmed in a cellular model. We anticipate that studying the interaction of antimicrobial&#8208;type peptides with liquid condensates such as &#945;&#8208;synuclein will contribute to the understanding of disease mechanisms (that arise in such condensates) and may also open up exciting new avenues for intervention.

         <title>Asymmetric Synthesis of Multi&#8208;Substituted Tetrahydrofurans via Palladium/Rhodium Synergistic Catalyzed [3+2] Decarboxylative Cycloaddition of Vinylethylene Carbonates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multimetallic cooperative catalysis represents one of the most efficient method for asymmetric C&#8722;C and C&#8208;heteroatom bond forming transformations. An enantioselective [3+2] cycloaddition reaction catalyzed synergistically by the combination of an achiral palladium catalyst and a chiral&#8208;at&#8208;metal rhodium(III) complex has been developed, generating a series of 1,2,3,3&#8208;tetrasubstituted tetrahydrofurans in high yields and stereoselectivities (&gt;20&#8201;:&#8201;1 d.r., up to 99&#8201;% ee).







Abstract
Unlike the comprehensive development of tandem multi&#8208;metallic catalysis, bimetallic synergistic catalysis has been challenging to achieve high stereoselectivity with the generation of multi&#8208;stereogenic centers. Herein, an efficient synergistic catalysis for the diastereo&#8208; and enantioselective synthesis of multi&#8208;substituted tetrahydrofuran derivatives has been developed. Under mild reaction conditions, a series of target molecules with three consecutive stereocenters were synthesized by a palladium(0)/rhodium(III) bimetal&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric decarboxylative [3+2]&#8208;cycloaddition of vinylethylene carbonates with &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated carbonyl compounds. The corresponding adducts were obtained with moderate to high yields (67&#8201;%&#8764;98&#8201;%) and excellent stereoselectivities (&gt;20&#8201;:&#8201;1 d.r., up to 99&#8201;% ee).

         <dc:description>
A versatile approach towards 2,9&#8208;diazadibenzoperylenes (DDPs) and related 2,9&#8208;dimethyldibenzoperylenes (DBPs) with various C, O, and N substituents in 1,3,8,10&#8208;positions is presented. It comprises reductive aromatization of PTCDI via O&#8208;silylation and O&#8208;trifylation steps. DDP&#8208;tetratriflate is the strategic key to (hetero)aryl, alkynyl, aminyl or O&#8208;phosphanyl DDPs characterized by UV/Vis/PL spectra, XRD and CV methods and (TD&#8208;)DFT calculations.







Abstract
The synthesis of 2,9&#8208;diaza&#8208;1,3,8,10&#8208;tetratriflato&#8208;dibenzoperylene (DDP 3&#8201;a) and corresponding 2,9&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;1,3,8,10&#8208;tetratriflato&#8208;dibenzoperylene (DBP 3&#8201;b) has been developed at multigram scale via reduction of one of the industrially most important high&#8208;performance dyes, perylene&#8208;3,4,9,10&#8208;tetracarboxylic diimide (PTCDI), and of the corresponding dihydroxy peropyrenequinone precursor. The focus of this paper is on the reactivity pattern of 3&#8201;a as key intermediate towards highly functionalized 2,9&#8208;diazadibenzopyrelenes (DDPs) obtained via catalytic substitution of four triflate by aryl, heteroaryl, alkynyl, aminyl, and O&#8208;phosphanyl substituents. The influence of electron&#8208;donating substituents (OSiMe3, OPt&#8208;Bu2, N&#8208;piperidinyl), electron&#8208;withdrawing (OTf, 3,5&#8208;bis&#8208;trifluoromethyl&#8208;phenyl), and of electron&#8208;rich &#960;&#8208;conjugated (2&#8208;thienyl, 4&#8208;tert&#8208;butylphenyl, trimethylsilyl&#8208;ethynyl) substituents on optoelectronic and structural properties of these functionalized DDPs has been investigated via XRD analyses, UV/Vis, PL spectroscopy, and by electroanalytical CV. These results were correlated to results of DFT and TD&#8208;DFT calculations. Thus, functionalized DPPs with easily tunable HOMO and LUMO energies and gap became available via a new and reliable synthetic strategy starting from readily available PTCDI.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A low&#8208;temperature aminolytic route was designed to synthesize sub&#8208;10&#8197;nm CoFe2O4 nanoparticles (CFO NPs) with good dispersion through carefully exploiting the reaction of acetates and oleylamine (OAm). The well&#8208;dispersed 9.1&#8197;nm CFO NPs prepared by the aminolytic method exhibited excellent reversible capacity and superior cycling stability compared with those prepared by co&#8208;precipitation method, and the performance could be further enhanced when the size of nanoparticles decreased to 3.4&#8197;nm.







Abstract
Spinel ferrites are promising anode materials for lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) owing to their high theoretical specific capacities. However, their practical application is impeded by inherent low conductivity and severe volume expansion, which can be surpassed by increasing the surface&#8208;to&#8208;volume ratio of nanoparticles. Currently, most methods produce spinel ferrite nanoparticles with large size and severe aggregation, degrading their electrochemical performance. In this study, a low&#8208;temperature aminolytic route was designed to synthesize sub&#8208;10&#8197;nm CoFe2O4 nanoparticles with good dispersion through carefully exploiting the reaction of acetates and oleylamine. The performance of CoFe2O4 nanoparticles obtained by a traditional co&#8208;precipitation method was also investigated for comparison. This work demonstrates that CoFe2O4 nanoparticles synthesized by the aminolytic route are promising as anode materials for LIBs. Besides, this method can be extended to design other spinel ferrites for energy storage devices with superior performance by simply changing the starting material, such as MnFe2O4, MgFe2O4, ZnFe2O4, and so on.

         <title>Impact of Pore Size and Defects on the Selective Adsorption of Acetylene in Alkyne&#8208;Functionalized Nickel(II)&#8208;Pyrazolate&#8208;Based MOFs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
As a consequence of specific interactions between acetylene molecules and alkyne, aromatic and hydroxide residues of metal clusters, two isoreticular nickel(II) pyrazolate&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic frameworks bearing alkyne moieties on the ligand backbones are suitable for the selective separation of the challenging acetylene over CO2 gas mixture. Moreover, a post&#8208;synthetic treatment of these materials with ethanolic KOH solution gives rise to linker vacancy defects and the incorporation of extra&#8208;framework potassium ions, which are responsible for a further modulation of the interactions with the adsorbate molecules.

         <title>Bifunctional Polyene Cyclizations: Synthetic Studies on Pimarane Natural Products</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The biosynthesis of pimaranes is based on two consecutive cyclization reactions of the linear polyene geranylgeranyl diphosphate. In contrast, our synthetic studies on pimaranes involve a tetracyclization reaction of a dual nucleophilic aryl enol ether. The modified isoprene enabled a transannular endo&#8208;termination step and rapid assembly of the natural product pimara&#8208;15&#8208;en&#8208;3&#945;&#8208;8&#945;&#8208;diol.







Abstract
Polyene cyclizations generate molecular complexity from a linear polyene in a single step. While methods to initiate these cyclizations have been continuously expanded and improved over the years, the majority of polyene substrates are still limited to simple alkyl&#8208;substituted alkenes. In this study, we took advantage of the unique reactivity of higher&#8208;functionalized bifunctional alkenes. The realization of a polyene tetracyclization of a dual nucleophilic aryl enol ether involving a transannular endo&#8208;termination step enabled the total synthesis of the tricyclic diterpenoid pimara&#8208;15&#8208;en&#8208;3&#945;&#8208;8&#945;&#8208;diol. The highly flexible and modular route allowed for the preparation of a diverse library of cyclization precursors specifically designed for the total synthesis of the tetracyclic nor&#8208;diterpenoid norflickinflimiod C. The tetracyclization of three diversely substituted allenes enabled access to complex pentacyclic products and provided a detailed insight into the underlying reaction pathways.

         <title>Highly Efficient Trityl&#8208;Nitroxide Biradicals for Biomolecular High&#8208;Field Dynamic Nuclear Polarization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
New trityl&#8208;nitroxide biradicals, dubbed SNAPols, show maximal dynamic nuclear polarization enhancement factors at 18.8 T of &gt;100 in small molecules and globular proteins and also exhibit strong enhancements in membrane proteins and cellular preparations. Thus, SNAPols show great application potential in high&#8208;field DNP/ssNMR spectroscopy, especially for complex biomolecules.







Abstract
Dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) is a powerful method to enhance the sensitivity of solid&#8208;state magnetic nuclear resonance (ssNMR) spectroscopy. However, its biomolecular applications at high magnetic fields (preferably&gt;14&#8197;T) have so far been limited by the intrinsically low efficiency of polarizing agents and sample preparation aspects. Herein, we report a new class of trityl&#8208;nitroxide biradicals, dubbed SNAPols that combine high DNP efficiency with greatly enhanced hydrophilicity. SNAPol&#8208;1, the best compound in the series, shows DNP enhancement factors at 18.8 T of more than 100 in small molecules and globular proteins and also exhibits strong DNP enhancements in membrane proteins and cellular preparations. By integrating optimal sensitivity and high resolution, we expect widespread applications of this new polarizing agent in high&#8208;field DNP/ssNMR spectroscopy, especially for complex biomolecules.

         <title>Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Dimeric Capsules with Appended Spiropyran Units: Towards Controlled Cargo Release</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Controlled uptake and release: We investigate the photo&#8208; and acid&#8208;induced isomerization of monomeric and homo&#8208;dimeric tetra&#8208;spiropyran tetra&#8208;urea calix[4]arene and calix[4]pyrrole derivatives. The acid&#8208;induced isomerization of the switches was coupled to the homo&#8208;dimeric calix[4]arene capsule's disassembly and the release of the cationic guest to the bulk solution. The neutralization of the acidified solution with Et3N completely restored the original encapsulation complex.







Abstract
We report the synthesis of unprecedented tetra&#8208;urea derivatives of calix[4]arene and calix[4]pyrrole containing four spiropyran (SP) units at their upper rim. We investigate the photo&#8208; and acid&#8208;induced isomerization of the monomeric and homo&#8208;dimeric tetra&#8208;ureas derivatives using UV&#8208;Vis and 1H NMR spectroscopies. At micromolar concentration, irradiation of the samples with 365&#8197;nm light induces changes in their absorption spectra that are consistent with SP&#8594;merocyanine (MC) isomerization. However, analogous experiments at millimolar concentration do not produce noticeable changes in the 1H NMR spectra. The addition of triflic acid to micromolar and millimolar solutions of the tetra&#8208;ureas produces the quantitative isomerization of the SP units to the protonated merocyanine form (E&#8208;MCH+) and the simultaneous disassembly of the capsular dimers to form ill&#8208;defined aggregates. The neutralization of the acid solutions resets the SP form. Under these acid/base treatment conditions, the controlled release of the included guest and the reassembly of the all&#8208;SP tetra&#8208;urea dimers occurs at different extents depending on its calix[4]arene or calix[4]pyrrole scaffold.

         <title>Synthesis and Surface Behaviour of NDI Chromophores Mounted on a Tripodal Scaffold: Towards Self&#8208;Decoupled Chromophores for Single&#8208;Molecule Electroluminescence</title>

Three&#8208;legged race: The efficient synthesis, optical and electrochemical properties of a series of 2,6&#8208;disubstituted naphthalene&#8208;1,4,5,8&#8208;tetracarboxdiimides (NDIs) mounted on a tripodal platform are reported. Moreover, their surface behaviour after spraying on Au(111) was studied. In a STML setup, such NDI tripods show electroluminescence photon spectra with high electroluminescence yields and thus demonstrate their potential for optoelectronic devices.







Abstract
This paper reports the efficient synthesis, absorption and emission spectra, and the electrochemical properties of a series of 2,6&#8208;disubstituted naphthalene&#8208;1,4,5,8&#8208;tetracarboxdiimide (NDI) tripodal molecules with thioacetate anchors for their surface investigations. Our studies showed that, in particular, the pyrrolidinyl group with its strong electron&#8208;donating properties enhanced the fluorescence of such core&#8208;substituted NDI chromophores and caused a significant bathochromic shift in the absorption spectrum with a correspondingly narrowed bandgap of 1.94&#8197;eV. Cyclic voltammetry showed the redox properties of NDIs to be influenced by core substituents. The strong electron&#8208;donating character of pyrrolidine substituents results in rather high HOMO and LUMO levels of &#8208;5.31 and &#8208;3.37 eV when compared with the parental unsubstituted NDI. UHV&#8208;STM measurements of a sub&#8208;monolayer of the rigid tripodal NDI chromophores spray deposited on Au(111) show that these molecules mainly tend to adsorb flat in a pairwise fashion on the surface and form unordered films. However, the STML experiments also revealed a few molecular clusters, which might consist of upright oriented molecules protruding from the molecular island and show electroluminescence photon spectra with high electroluminescence yields of up to 6&#215;10&#8722;3. These results demonstrate the promising potential of the NDI tripodal chromophores for the fabrication of molecular devices profiting from optical features of the molecular layer.

         <title>Effect of a &#8220;Zn Bridge&#8221; on the Consecutively Tunable Retention Characteristics of Volatile Random Access Memory Materials</title>

Committing zinc to memory: A prominent &#8220;zinc bridge&#8221; effect with extending feature could endow porphyrinated polyimide information memory materials with volatility. The electronic excitation processes and memory behavior of porphyrinated co&#8208;polyimides could be flexibly regulated by simply altering the zinc ion content in the porphyrin core. By strengthening the stability of the &#8220;zinc bridge&#8221;, the retention characteristics of porphyrinated polyimides could be precisely and successively tuned.







Abstract
Polyimide memory materials with a donor&#8211;acceptor structure based on a charge&#8208;transfer mechanism exhibit great potential for next&#8208;generation information storage technology due to their outstanding high&#8208;temperature resistance and good dimensional and chemical stability. Precisely controlling memory performance by limited chemical decoration is one of core challenges in this field. Most reported work mainly focuses on designing novel and elaborate electron donors or acceptors for the expected memory behavior of polyimides; this takes a lot of time and is not always efficacious. Herein, we report a series of porphyrinated copolyimides coPI&#8722;Znx (x=5, 10, 20, 50, 80), where x represents the mole percentage of Zn ion in the central core of the porphyrin. Experimental and theoretical analysis indicate that the Zn ion could play a vital bridge role in promoting the formation and stabilization of a charge&#8208;transfer complex by enhancing the hybridization of local and charge transfer (HLCT) excitations of porphyrinated polyimides, endowing coPI&#8722;Znx with volatile random access memory performance and continuously tunable retention time. This work could provide one simple strategy to precisely regulate memory performance merely by altering the metal content in porphyrinated polyimides.

         <title>First Synthesis of the Inherently Chiral Trans&#8208;4' Bisadduct of C59N Azafullerene Using Cyclo&#8208;[2]&#8208;dodecylmalonate as Tether</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Multiaddition chemistry of azafullerene C  59  N has been scarcely explored and the isolation of pure bisadducts is in its infancy. Encouraged by the recent regioselective synthesis of the inherently chiral  equatorial  face  bisadduct of C  59  N, we focused on the isolation of the first  trans&#8208;  4 bisadduct, via a simple two&#8208;step approach. The first regioselective synthesis of the  trans&#8208;  4 bisadduct of C  59  N utilizing  cyclo&#8208;  [2]&#8208;dodecylmalonate as tether is now reported. The newly synthesized bisadduct has a  C  1  symmetry as evidenced by  13  C NMR, while X&#8208;ray crystallography validated the  trans&#8208;  4' addition pattern. Furthermore, the inherently chiral  trans&#8208;  4' C  59  N bisadduct was enantiomerically resolved and the mirror&#8208;image relation of the two enantiomers was probed by circular dichroism spectroscopy. Finally, UV&#8208;Vis and redox assays suggested that the addition pattern has a reflection in the light&#8208;harvesting and redox properties of the bisadduct.</dc:description>

         <title>Canopy Catalysts for Alkyne Metathesis: Investigations into a Bimolecular Decomposition Pathway and the Stability of the Podand Cap</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Molybdenum alkylidyne complexes with a trisilanolate podand ligand framework (&#8220;canopy catalysts&#8221;) are the arguably most selective catalysts for alkyne metathesis known to date. Among them, complex  1a  endowed with a fence of lateral methyl substituents on the silicon linkers is most reactive, although fairly high loadings are required in certain applications.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Molybdenum alkylidyne complexes with a trisilanolate podand ligand framework (&#8220;canopy catalysts&#8221;) are the arguably most selective catalysts for alkyne metathesis known to date. Among them, complex  1a  endowed with a fence of lateral methyl substituents on the silicon linkers is most reactive, although fairly high loadings are required in certain applications. It is now shown that this catalyst decomposes readily via a bimolecular pathway, which engages the Mo&#186;CR entities in a stoichiometric triple bond metathesis event to furnish RC&#186;CR and the corresponding dinuclear complex  8  with a Mo&#186;Mo core.

         <title>Determining the Diastereoselectivity of the Formation of Dipeptidonucleotides by NMR Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Proteins are composed of l&#8208;amino acids, but nucleic acids and most oligosaccharides contain d&#8208;sugars as building blocks. It is interesting to ask whether this is a coincidence or a consequence of the functional interplay of these biomolecules. One reaction that provides an opportunity to study this interplay is the formation of phosphoramidate&#8208;linked peptido RNA from amino acids and ribonucleotides in aqueous condensation buffer. Here we report how the diastereoselectivity of the first peptide coupling of the peptido RNA pathway can be determined in situ by NMR spectroscopy. When a racemic mixture of an amino acid ester was allowed to react with an 5'&#8208;aminoacidyl nucleotide, diastereomeric ratios of up to 72:28 of the resulting dipeptido nucleotides were found by integration of 31P&#8208; or 1H&#8208;NMR peaks. The highest diastereomeric excess was found for the homochiral coupling product d&#8208;Ser&#8208;d&#8208;Trp, phosphoramidate&#8208;linked to adenosine 5'&#8208;monophosphate with its d&#8208;ribose ring. When control reactions with an N&#8208;acetyl amino acid and valine methyl ester were run in organic solvent, the diastereoselectivity was found to be lower, with diastereomeric ratios &#8804; 62:38. The results from the exploratory study thus indicate that the ribonucleotide residue not only facilitates the coupling of lipophilic amino acids in aqueous medium but also the formation of a homochiral dipeptide. The methodology described here may be used to search for other stereoselective reactions that shed light on the origin of homochirality.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Achieving high efficiency at high luminance is one of the most important prerequisites towards practical application for any kinds of light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs). Herein, we report highly emissive organic fluorescent molecules based on phenanthroimidazole&#8208;benzothiadiazole derivatives capable of maintaining high external quantum efficiency (EQE) at high luminance enabled by triplet&#8208;triplet fusion (TTF) in doped organic LEDs. The PIBzP, PIBzPCN and PIBzTPA based devices showed EQE of 8.27%, 9.15% and 8.64%, respectively, at luminance of higher than 1000 cd m  &#8208;2  , with little efficiency roll&#8208;off.</dc:description>

         <title>Combined Chemical Modification and Collision Induced Unfolding Using Native Ion Mobility&#8208;mass Spectrometry Provides Insights into Protein Gas&#8208;phase Structure</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Native mass spectrometry is now an important tool in structural biology. Thus, the nature of higher protein structure in the vacuum of the mass spectrometer is an area of significant interest. One of the major goals in the study of gas&#8208;phase protein structure is to elucidate the stabilising role of interactions at the level of individual amino acid residues. A strategy combining protein chemical modification together with collision induced unfolding (CIU) was developed and employed to probe the structure of compact protein ions produced by native electrospray ionisation. Tractable chemical modification was used to alter the properties of amino acid residues, and&#160; ion mobility&#8208;mass spectrometry (IM&#8208;MS) utilised to monitor the extent of unfolding as a function of modification. From these data the importance of specific intramolecular interactions for the stability of compact gas&#8208;phase protein structure can be inferred. Using this approach, and aided by molecular dynamics simulations, an important stabilising interaction between K6 and H68 in the protein ubiquitin was identified, as was a contact between the N&#8208;terminus and E22 in a ubiquitin binding protein UBA2.</dc:description>

         <title>A Water Molecule Triggers Guest Exchange at a Mono&#8208;zinc Centre Confined in a Biomimetic Calixarene Pocket: a Model for Understanding Ligand Stability in Zn Proteins</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this study, the ligand exchange mechanism at a biomimetic Zn  II  centre, embedded in a pocket mimicking the possible constrains induced by a proteic structure, is explored. The residence time of different guest ligands (dimethylformamide, acetonitrile and ethanol) inside the cavity of a calix[6]arene&#8208;based tris(imidazole) tetrahedral zinc complex was probed using 1D EXchange SpectroscopY NMR experiments. A strong dependence of residence time on water content was observed with no exchange occurring under anhydrous conditions, even in the presence of a large excess of guest ligand. These results advocate for an associative exchange mechanism involving the transient exo&#8208;coordination of a water molecule, giving rise to 5&#8208;coordinate Zn  II  intermediates, and inversion of the pyramid at the Zn  II&#160;  centre. Theoretical modelling by DFT confirmed that the associative mechanism is at stake. These results are particularly relevant in the context of the understanding of kinetic stability/lability in Zn proteins and highlight the key role that a single water molecule can play in catalysing ligand exchange and controlling the lability of Zn.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The direct C2&#8208;functionalization of pyridines via a transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free protocol using aryne multicomponent coupling is demonstrated.

Activated keto esters could also be employed as the third component in this formal 1,2&#8208;di(hetero)arylation of ketones.

         <title>Dicyano&#8208;imidazole: A Facile Generation of Pure Blue TADF Materials for OLEDs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A series of dicyano&#8208;imidazole&#8208;based molecules with thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) properties were synthesized to obtain pure blue&#8208;emitting organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs). The targeted molecules used dicyano&#8208;imidazole with a short&#8208;conjugated system as the electron acceptor to strong intermolecular &#960;&#8208;&#960; interactions, and provide a relatively shallow energy level of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO). The cyano group was selected to improve imidazole as an electron acceptor due to its prominent electron&#8208;transporting characteristics. The crowded molecular structure in space makes the electron donor and acceptor almost orthogonal, reducing the energy gap (&#916;EST) between the first excited singlet (S1) and the triplet (T1) states and introducing significant TADF property. The efficiencies of the blue&#8208;emissive devices with imM&#8208;SPAC and imM&#8208;DMAC obtained in this work are the highest among the reported imidazole&#8208;based TADF&#8208;OLEDs, which are 13.8% and 13.4%, respectively. Both of Commission Internationale de l'Eclairage (CIE) coordinates are close to the saturated blue region at (0.17, 0.18) and (0.16, 0.19), respectively. Combining these tailor&#8208;made TADF compounds with specific device architectures, electroluminescent (EL) emission from sky&#8208;blue to deep&#8208;blue could be achieved, proving their great potential in EL applications.</dc:description>

The crowded molecular structure in space makes the electron donor and acceptor almost orthogonal, reducing the energy gap (&#916;EST) between the first excited singlet (S1) and the triplet (T1) states and introducing significant TADF property. The efficiencies of the blue-emissive devices with imM-SPAC and imM-DMAC obtained in this work are the highest among the reported imidazole-based TADF-OLEDs, which are 13.8% and 13.4%, respectively. Both of Commission Internationale de l'Eclairage (CIE) coordinates are close to the saturated blue region at (0.17, 0.18) and (0.16, 0.19), respectively. Combining these tailor-made TADF compounds with specific device architectures, electroluminescent (EL) emission from sky-blue to deep-blue could be achieved, proving their great potential in EL applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Matrix Isolation Spectroscopic and Relativistic Quantum Chemical Study on Molecular Platinum Fluorides PtFn (n = 1&#8211;6) Reveals Magnetic Bistability of PtF4</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Molecular platinum fluorides PtF  n  ,  n  = 1&#8211;6, are prepared by two different routes, the photo&#8208;initiated fluorine elimination from PtF  6  embedded in solid noble&#8208;gas matrices, and the reaction of elemental fluorine with laser ablated platinum atoms. IR spectra of the reaction products isolated in rare&#8208;gas matrices at cryogenic conditions provide for the first time experimental vibrational frequencies of molecular PtF  3  , PtF  4  and PtF  5  . Photolysis of PtF  6  enabled a highly efficient and almost quantitative formation of molecular PtF  4  , while both PtF  5  and PtF  3  were formed simultaneously by subsequent UV irradiation of PtF  4  . The vibrational spectra of these molecular platinum fluorides were assigned with the help from one&#8208; and two&#8208;component quasirelativistic DFT computations to account for scalar relativistic and spin&#8208;orbit coupling effects. Competing Jahn&#8208;Teller and spin&#8208;orbit coupling effects result in a magnetic bistability of PtF  4  , for which a spin&#8208;triplet (  3  B  2g  ,  D  2h  ) coexists with an electronic singlet state (  1  A  1g  ,  D  4h  ) in solid neon matrices.</dc:description>

         <title>Fluorescent Supramolecular Organic Frameworks Constructed by Amidinium&#8208;Carboxylate Salt Bridges</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report here a set of fluorescent supramolecular organic frameworks (SOFs) that incorporate aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) units within their frameworks. The fluorescent SOFs of this study were constructed by linking the tetraphenylethylene (TPE)&#8208;based tetra(amidinium) cation  TPE  4+  and aromatic dicarboxylate anions through amidinium&#8208;carboxylate salt bridges. The resulting self&#8208;assembled structures are characterized by fluorescence quantum yields in the range of 4.6%~14%. This emissive behavior is ascribed to a combination of electrostatic and hydrogen bonding interactions that operate in concert to impede motions that would otherwise lead to excited state energy dissipation. Single crystal X&#8208;ray di&#64256;raction analyses revealed that the length of dicarboxylate anion bridges has a considerable impact on the structural features of the resulting frameworks. Nevertheless all SOFs prepared in the context of the present study were found display emissive features characteristic of TPE&#8208;based AIE luminogens with only a modest dependence on the structural specifics being seen. The SOFs reported here could be reversibly &#8220;broken up&#8221; and &#8220;reformed&#8221; in response to acid/base stimuli.</dc:description>

         <title>Midkine Interaction with Chondroitin Sulfate Model Synthetic Tetrasaccharides and Their Mimetics: The Role of Aromatic Interactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The spatial structures of the active complex of midkine and synthetic chondroitin sulfate tetrasaccharides have been solved by NMR spectroscopy and molecular dynamics simulations. The rigid ligand is enclosed by a flexible receptor, with an intrinsically disordered region. The 3D structure of the ligands remains as a helical, almost lineal structure, independently of the aromatic substituents introduced.







Abstract
Midkine (MK) is a neurotrophic factor that participates in the embryonic central nervous system (CNS) development and neural stem cell regulation, interacting with sulfated glycosaminoglycans (GAGs). Chondroitin sulfate (CS) is the natural ligand in the CNS. In this work, we describe the interactions between a library of synthetic models of CS&#8208;types and mimics. We did a structural study of this library by NMR and MD (Molecular Dynamics), concluding that the basic shape is controlled by similar geometry of the glycosidic linkages. Their 3D structures are a helix with four residues per turn, almost linear. We have studied the tetrasaccharide&#8208;midkine complexes by ligand observed NMR techniques and concluded that the shape of the ligands does not change upon binding. The ligand orientation into the complex is very variable. It is placed inside the central cavity of MK formed by the two structured beta&#8208;sheets domains linked by an intrinsically disordered region (IDR). Docking analysis confirmed the participation of aromatics residues from MK completed with electrostatic interactions. Finally, we test the biological activity by increasing the MK expression using CS tetrasaccharides and their capacity in enhancing the growth stimulation effect of MK in NIH3T3 cells.

         <title>Aromatic Trifluoromethylselenolation via Pd&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H functionalization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Trifluoromethylselenolation of arenes was performed through a metal&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H functionalization. This pallado&#8208;catalyzed reaction was based on the use of 5&#8208;methoxy&#8208;8&#8208;amino&#8208;quinoline as directing group and trifluoromethyl tolueneselenosulfonate as trifluoromethylselenolating reagent. This method was also extended to fluoroalkylselenolation reactions.







Abstract
The synthesis of trifluoromethylselenolated aromatic molecules via an auxiliary&#8208;assisted, palladium catalyzed, C&#8722;H bonds functionalization with trifluoromethyl tolueneselenosulfonate as reagent is described. The mono&#8208; or bis&#8208;products can be preferentially formed. Some mechanistic investigations were realized to better understand the reaction. This methodology was also extended to fluoroalkylselenyl groups.

         <title>Magnesium Deintercalation From the Spinel&#8208;Type MgMn2&#8208;yFeyO4 (0.4&#8804;y&#8804;2.0) by Acid&#8208;Treatment and Electrochemistry</title>

         <dc:description>
Nanostructured MgxMn2&#8208;yFeyO4 with cubic spinel structures are studied. According to the DFT calculations, the intermediate compositions can be stable, and the voltage could be tailored with the composition. Partial replacement of Mn by Fe could improve the electrochemical cyclability, whereas the Fe would also induce a disorder of the spinel structure, thereby reducing the electrode capacity. The reactions for the acid&#8208;treatment are different for MgMn2O4 and MgFe2O4. The intermediate composition with low iron&#8208;content and acid&#8208;treatment exhibits a good electrochemical behavior.







Abstract
Rechargeable magnesium batteries attract lots of attention because of their high safety and low cost compared to lithium batteries, and it is needed to develop more efficient electrode materials. Although MgMn2O4 is a promising material for the positive electrode in Mg rechargeable batteries, it usually exhibits poor cyclability. To improve the electrochemical behavior, we have prepared nanoparticles of MgMn2&#8208;yFeyO4. The XRD results have confirmed that when Mn3+ (Jahn&#8208;Teller ion) ions are replaced by Fe3+ (non&#8208;Jahn&#8208;Teller ion), the resulting MgMn2&#8208;yFeyO4 is a cubic phase. The structure and theoretical voltage are theoretically calculated by using the DFT method. The obtained samples have been chemically treated in acid solution for partial demagnesiation, and it is observed that the presence of iron inhibits the deinsertion of Mg through disproportionation and favors the exchange reaction. The electrochemical behavior in non&#8208;aqueous magnesium cells has been explored.

         <title>PtM/MxBy (M=Ni, Co, Fe) Heterostructured Nanobundles as Advanced Electrocatalyst for Hydrogen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
PtM/MxBy (M=Ni, Co, Fe) heterostructured nanobundles have been synthesized by a hydrothermal method and subsequent boride doping. The synergistic effect of heterostructured electrocatalysts facilitates electron transfer and hydrogen adsorption ensure the catalysts to possess excellent catalytic activity and stability for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). In addition, from the point of view of morphology, the PtM/MxBy NBs with 1D nanowire structure possess abundant active sites, high aspect ratios, which would undoubtedly boom the HER catalytic activity.







Abstract
Optimizing the electronic and synergistic effect of hybrid electrocatalysts based on Pt and Pt&#8208;based nanocatalysts is of tremendous importance towards a superior hydrogen evolution performance under both acidic and alkaline conditions. However, developing an ideal Pt&#8208;based hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) electrocatalyst with moderated electronic structure as well as strong synergistic effect is still a challenge. Herein, we fabricated boron (B)&#8208;doped PtNi nanobundles by a two&#8208;step method using NaBH4 as the boron source to obtain PtNi/Ni4B3 heterostructures with well&#8208;defined nanointerfaces between PtNi and Ni4B3, achieving an enhanced catalytic HER performance. Especially, the PtNi/Ni4B3 nanobundles (PtNi/Ni4B3 NBs) can deliver a current density of 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at the overpotential of 14.6 and 26.5&#8197;mV under alkaline and acidic media, respectively, as well as outstanding electrochemical stability over 40&#8197;h at the current density of 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Remarkably, this approach is also universal for the syntheses of PtCo/Co3B and PtFe/Fe49B with outstanding electrocatalytic HER performance.

         <title>Promotion of Proton Conductivity by Encapsulation of Metal&#8208;Organic Polyhedra in Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks</title>

Protons get a move on: A Zr&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic polyhedron (MOP&#8208;1) was self&#8208;assembled in a porous MOF host, DUT&#8208;68, to synthesize MOP&#8208;1@DUT&#8208;68. The migration and leaching of MOP could be effectively prohibited if MOP&#8208;1 was encapsulated in the MOF&#8242;s cavities. Incorporation of MOP&#8208;1 makes the proton conductivity of MOP&#8208;1@DUT&#8208;68 reach 1.14&#215;10&#8722;3&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 (at 80&#8201;&#176;C under 98&#8201;% RH), which is three orders of magnitude higher than that of DUT&#8208;68.







Abstract
A Zr&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic polyhedron (MOP) was self&#8208;assembled in a porous MOF host, DUT&#8208;68, successfully to synthesize MOP&#8208;1@DUT&#8208;68. The MOP guest (MOP&#8208;1) has a diameter of about 20&#8197;&#197;, larger than that of the square windows (pore sizes of &#8764;14&#8197;&#197;) of DUT&#8208;68 but smaller than that of the rhombicuboctahedral cage (27.7&#8197;&#197;), which means that the migration and leaching of MOP&#8208;1 could be effectively prohibited if MOP&#8208;1 is encapsulated in the MOF&#8242;s cavities. The proton conductivity of MOP&#8208;1@DUT&#8208;68 is 1.14&#215;10&#8722;3&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 (at 80&#8201;&#176;C under 98&#8201;% relative humidity), which is three orders of magnitude higher than that of DUT&#8208;68. Compared with MOP&#8208;1&#8834;DUT&#8208;68, which was synthesized by impregnation, MOP&#8208;1@DUT&#8208;68 is more prone to form faster proton&#8208;conduction pathways and thus provides higher proton conductivity.

         <title>Low&#8208;Concentration C2H6 Capture Enabled by Size Matching in the Ultramicropore</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recorded C2H6adsorption at low concentration was achieved by precisely size matching in an ultramicroporous metal&#8211;organic framework. Low&#8208;Concentration Ethane Capture Enabled by Size Matching in the Ultramicropore (Chen et&#8197;al.).







Abstract
Low&#8208;concentration ethane capture is crucial for environmental protection and natural gas purification. The ideal physisorbent with strong C2H6 interaction and large C2H6 uptake at low&#8208;concentration level has rarely been reported, due to the large pKa value and small quadrupole moment of C2H6. Herein, we demonstrate the perfectly size matching between the ultramicropore (pore size of 4.6&#8197;&#197;) and ethane (kinetic diameter of 4.4&#8197;&#197;) in a nickel pyridine&#8208;4&#8208;carboxylate metal&#8211;organic framework (IISERP&#8208;MOF2), which enables the record&#8208;breaking performance for low concentration C2H6 capture. IISERP&#8208;MOF2 exhibits the large C2H6 adsorption enthalpy of 56.7&#8197;kJ/mol, and record&#8208;high C2H6 uptake at low pressure of 0.01&#8211;0.1&#8197;bar and 298&#8197;K (1.8&#8197;mmol/g at 0.01&#8197;bar). Molecule simulations and C2H6&#8208;loading crystal structure analysis revealed that the maximized interaction sites in IISERP&#8208;MOF2 with ethane molecule originates the strong C2H6 adsorption. The dynamic breakthrough experiments for gas mixtures of C2H6/N2(1/999, v/v) and C2H6/CH4 (5/95, v/v) proved the excellent low&#8208;concentration C2H6 capture performance.

         <title>G&#8208;Quadruplex Formation by DNA Sequences Deficient in Guanines: Two Tetrad Parallel Quadruplexes Do Not Fold Intramolecularly</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A lesson on less: There are multiple ways a sequence with a reduced number of guanines can form a G&#8208;quadruplex. Parallel topology is unstable, unless stabilized by suitable capping sequences or dimerization.







Abstract
Guanine quadruplexes (G4s) are noncanonical forms of nucleic acids that are frequently found in genomes. The stability of G4s depends, among other factors, on the number of G&#8208;tetrads. Three&#8208; or four&#8208;tetrad G4s and antiparallel two&#8208;tetrad G4s have been characterized experimentally; however, the existence of an intramolecular (i.&#8201;e., not dimeric or multimeric) two&#8208;tetrad parallel&#8208;stranded DNA G4 has never been experimentally observed. Many sequences compatible with two&#8208;tetrad G4 can be found in important genomic regions, such as promoters, for which parallel G4s predominate. Using experimental and theoretical approaches, the propensity of the model sequence AATGGGTGGGTTTGGGTGGGTAA to form an intramolecular parallel&#8208;stranded G4 upon increasing the number of GGG&#8208;to&#8208;GG substitutions has been studied. Deletion of a single G leads to the formation of intramolecular G4s with a stacked G&#8208;triad, whose topology depends on the location of the deletion. Removal of another guanine from another G&#8208;tract leads to di&#8208; or multimeric G4s. Further deletions mostly prevent the formation of any stable G4. Thus, a solitary two&#8208;tetrad parallel DNA G4 is not thermodynamically stable and requires additional interactions through capping residues. However, transiently populated metastable two&#8208;tetrad species can associate to form stable dimers, the dynamic formation of which might play additional delicate roles in gene regulation. These findings provide essential information for bioinformatics studies searching for potential G4s in genomes.

Removal of another guanine from another G-tract leads to di- or multimeric G4s. Further deletions mostly prevent the formation of any stable G4. Thus, a solitary two-tetrad parallel DNA G4 is not thermodynamically stable and requires additional interactions through capping residues. However, transiently populated metastable two-tetrad species can associate to form stable dimers, the dynamic formation of which might play additional delicate roles in gene regulation. These findings provide essential information for bioinformatics studies searching for potential G4s in genomes.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Multilevel Chirality Transfer from Amino Acid Derivatives to Circularly Polarized Luminescence&#8208;Active Nanoparticles in Aqueous Medium</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Based on the supramolecular self&#8208;assembly of a water&#8208;soluble pillar[5]arene (WP5), and l&#8208;/d&#8208;PyLys hydrochlorides, two&#8208;step chirality&#8208;transferring systems have been successfully fabricated in aqueous solution. The chirality originated from the point chirality of amino acid derivatives l&#8208;/d&#8208;PyLys hydrochloride, and transferred to the planar conformational chirality of water&#8208;soluble pillar[5]arene pR&#8208;/pS&#8208;WP5. Then, two kinds of chiral nanoparticle were formed that exhibited L&#8208;/R&#8208;handed circularly polarized luminescence.







Abstract
Chirality at different levels is widely observed in nature, but the clue to connect it all together, and the way chirality transfers among different levels are still obscure. Herein, a l&#8208;/d&#8208;lysine&#8208;based self&#8208;assembly system was constructed, in which two&#8208;step chirality transfer among three different levels was observed in aqueous solution. The chirality originated from the point chirality of amino acid derivatives l&#8208;/d&#8208;PyLys hydrochloride, and was transferred to the planar conformational chirality of water&#8208;soluble pillar[5]arene pR&#8208;/pS&#8208;WP5. Then, with the aid of pR&#8208;/pS&#8208;WP5, nanoparticles were formed that exhibited L&#8208;/R&#8208;handed circularly polarized luminescence with a dissymmetry factor of up to &#177;0.001, arising from pyrene chiral excimers. This multilevel chirality transfer not only provides a perspective to trace potential clues, and to pursue certain ways by which the chirality transfers, but also offers a strategy to create controllable CPL emission in aqueous media.

         <title>Photo&#8208;Initiated Cobalt&#8208;Catalyzed Radical Olefin Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Radical hydrogenation of olefins via stepwise hydrogen atom transfer (HAT&#8208;OH) is a complementary approach to alkene reduction that has attracted considerable interest in recent years. Blue light photolysis of a cobalt(II) monohydride pincer complex enabled olefin hydrogenation via photo&#8208;initiated HAT&#8208;OH. Femtosecond pump&#8208;probe spectroscopy confirmed Co&#8211;H homolysis to a three&#8208;coordinate cobalt(I) complex, which binds H2 and catalyzes thermal HAT&#8208;OH even of unactivated alkenes.







Abstract
Outer&#8208;sphere radical hydrogenation of olefins proceeds via stepwise hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) from transition metal hydride species to the substrate. Typical catalysts exhibit M&#8722;H bonds that are either too weak to efficiently activate H2 or too strong to reduce unactivated olefins. This contribution evaluates an alternative approach, that starts from a square&#8208;planar cobalt(II) hydride complex. Photoactivation results in Co&#8722;H bond homolysis. The three&#8208;coordinate cobalt(I) photoproduct binds H2 to give a dihydrogen complex, which is a strong hydrogen atom donor, enabling the stepwise hydrogenation of both styrenes and unactivated aliphatic olefins with H2 via HAT.

         <title>Chiral Resolution of Spin&#8208;Crossover Active Iron(II) [2x2] Grid Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The trans&#8208;type ligand wrapping around the metal centers in an inter&#8208;woven style makes the complex to be in chiral. This separation of &#923; and &#916; forms of spin&#8208;crossover isomers was successfully achieved by appending the chiral moiety onto the parent ligand. The presence of spin&#8208;crossover and chirality makes these multifunctional complexes intriguing for the study of magneto&#8208;optical effects.







Abstract
Chiral magnetic materials are proposed for applications in second&#8208;order non&#8208;linear optics, magneto&#8208;chiral dichroism, among others. Recently, we have reported a set of tetra&#8208;nuclear Fe(II) grid complex conformers with general formula C/S&#8208;[Fe4L4]8+ (L: 2,6&#8208;bis(6&#8208;(pyrazol&#8208;1&#8208;yl)pyridin&#8208;2&#8208;yl)&#8208;1,5&#8208;dihydrobenzo[1,2&#8208;d&#8201;:&#8201;4,5&#8208;d&#8242;]diimidazole). In the grid complexes, isomerism emerges from tautomerism and conformational isomerism of the ligand L, and the S&#8208;type grid complex is chiral, which originates from different non&#8208;centrosymmetric spatial organization of the trans type ligand around the Fe(II) center. However, the selective preparation of an enantiomerically pure grid complex in a controlled manner is difficult due to spontaneous self&#8208;assembly. To achieve the pre&#8208;synthesis programmable resolution of Fe(II) grid complexes, we designed and synthesized two novel intrinsically chiral ligands by appending chiral moieties to the parent ligand. The complexation of these chiral ligands with Fe(II) salt resulted in the formation of enantiomerically pure Fe(II) grid complexes, as unambiguously elucidated by CD and XRD studies. The enantiomeric complexes exhibited similar gradual and half&#8208;complete thermal and photo&#8208;induced SCO characteristics. The good agreement between the experimentally obtained and calculated CD spectra further supports the enantiomeric purity of the complexes and even the magnetic studies. The chiral resolution of Fe(II)&#8208; [2&#215;2] grid complexes reported in this study, for the first time, might enable the fabrication of magneto&#8208;chiral molecular devices.

         <title>Synthesis and Absorption Properties of Long Acenoacenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple general synthesis of a new family of angularly fused acenoacenes was developed. The presented strategy is general enough to be employed also for the construction of substituted analogues and potentially their heteroanalogues. The structure of these acenoacenes represent, in fact, formal stitching of two acene units that share one double bond in the final product. This angular topology significantly improves their stability compared to their isoelectronic linear counterparts.







Abstract
Acenes, polyaromatic hydrocarbons composed of linearly fused benzene rings have received immense attention due to their performance as semiconductors in organic optoelectronic applications. Their appealing physicochemical properties, such as extended delocalization, high charge carrier mobilities, narrow HOMO&#8208;LOMO gaps and partially radical character in the ground state make them very attractive targets for many potential applications. However, the intrinsic synthetic challenges of unsubstituted members such as high reactivity and poor solubility are still limiting factors for their wider exploitation. Herein, we report a simple general synthesis of a new family of angularly fused acenoacenes with improved stability compared to their isoelectronic linear counterparts. The synthesis and comprehensive characterization of pentacenopentacene, pentacenohexacene and hexacenohexacene, with lengths between decacene and dodecacene, are disclosed.

         <title>Analyzing anisotropic exchange in a pentanuclear Os2Ni3 complex</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Spin Hamiltonian parameters of a pentanuclear Os  III  2  Ni  II  3  cyanometallate complex are derived from ab initio wave function based calculations, namely valence&#8208;type configuration interaction calculations with a complete active space including spin&#8208;orbit interaction (CASOCI) in a singlestep procedure. While fits of experimental data performed so far could reproduce the data but the resulting parameters were not satisfactory, the parameters derived in the present work reproduce experimental data and at the same time have a reasonable size.&#160; Exchange interactions (both isotropic and anisotropic) obtained from CASOCI have to be scaled by a factor of 2.5 to obtain agreement with experiment, a known deficiency of such types of calculation. After scaling the parameters, the isotropic Os&#8208;Ni exchange coupling constant is  J  = &#8722;4.2 cm  &#8722;1  and the  D  parameter of the (nearly axial) anisotropic Os&#8208;Ni exchange is  D  =  J  k  &#8722;  J  &#8869;  = 18.8 cm  &#8722;1  , so anisotropic exchange is larger in absolute size than isotropic exchange. The negative value of the isotropic  J  (indicating antiferromagnetic coupling) seemingly contradicts the large&#8208;temperature behaviour of the temperature dependent susceptibility curve, but this is caused by the negative  g  value of the Os centres. This negative  g  value is a universal feature of a pseudo&#8208;octahedral coordination with configuration and strong spin&#8208;orbit interaction. Knowing the size of these exchange interactions is important because Os(CN) is a versatile building block for the synthesis of 5  d  /3  d  magnetic materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Mo&#8208;catalyzed One&#8208;pot Synthesis of N&#8208;polyheterocycles from

Nitroarenes and Glycols with Recycling of the Waste Reduction

         <dc:description>A catalytic domino reduction&#8722;imine formation&#8722;intramolecular cyclization&#8722;oxidation for the general synthesis of a wide variety of biologically relevant N&#8208;polyheterocycles, such as quinoxaline&#8208; and quinoline&#8208;fused derivatives, and phenanthridines, is reported. A simple, easily available, and environmentally friendly dioxomolybdenum(VI) complex has proven to be a highly efficient and versatile catalyst for transforming a broad range of starting nitroarenes involving several redox processes. Not only is this a sustainable, step&#8208;economical as well as air&#8208; and moisture&#8208;tolerant method, but also it is worth highlighting that the waste byproduct generated in the first step of the sequence is recycled and incorporated in the final target molecule, improving the overall synthetic efficiency. Moreover, selected indoloquinoxalines have been photophysically characterized in cyclohexane and toluene with exceptional fluorescence quantum yields above 0.7 for the alkyl derivatives.</dc:description>

         <title>In&#8208;Fjord Substitution in Expanded Helicenes: Effects of the Insert in the Inversion Barrier and Helical Pitch</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A series of expanded helicenes of different sizes and shapes incorporating phenyl&#8208; and biphenyl&#8208;substituents at the inner part of their fjord have been synthesized via sequential Au&#8208;catalyzed hydroarylation of appropriately designed diynes, and their racemization barriers have been calculated employing electronic structure methods. These show that the overall profile of the inversions (energies, number of transition states and intermediates, and their relative position) is intensively affected by the interplay of steric and attractive London dispersion interactions. Hence, in&#8208;fjord substitution constitutes an additional tool to handle the mechanical properties in helicenes of uncommonly large diameter. The photochemical characterization of the newly prepared helical structures is also reported.</dc:description>

         <title>Multi&#8208;Functional Metal Phosphides as Superior Host Materials for Advanced Lithium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>For the past few years, a new generation of energy storage system with large theoretical specific capacity is urgently needed because of the rapid development of the society. Lithium&#8208;sulfur (Li&#8208;S) batteries are regarded as one of the most promising candidates of novel battery systems, when resurged at the end of the 21st century. Li&#8208;S batteries have attracted more and more attention, attributed to their notably high theoretical energy density of 2600 W h kg  &#8208;1  which almost quintuple larger than that of commercial lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs). One of the most determined factors in Li&#8208;S batteries is how to design/prepare the sulfur cathode. As for the sulfur host, the major technical challenge is avoiding the shuttling effect which caused by soluble polysulfides during the reaction. In the past decades, though the sulfur cathode has made great development, there are also some enormous challenges needing to conquered, such as low utilization of S, rapid decay of capacity and poor cycle life. This article spotlights the recent progress and foremost findings in improving the battery performance of Li&#8208;S batteries by employing multi&#8208;functional metal phosphides as host materials. The nowadays state of development of sulfur electrode of Li&#8208;S batteries is summarized by emphasizing the relationship between essential properties of metal phosphide&#8208;based hybrid nanomaterials, chemical reaction with lithium polysulfides and the latterly influence on electrochemical performance. Finally, the development trend and practical application of Li&#8208;S batteries are also pointed out in the review.</dc:description>

         <title>Insights from Binding on Quadruplex Selective Carbazole Ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A summary is provided of the most promising carbazole ligands that have been established as effective G&#8208;quadruplex binders. The focus is made on the structural design of carbazole ligands and on NMR analysis of carbazole&#8208;G4 interactions with particular attention to the variety in binding modes shown by the carbazole ligands. Further, a brief view on biophysical and biological data of their molecular interactions with G&#8208;quadruplexes has been discussed.







Abstract
Polymorphic G&#8208;quadruplex (G4) secondary DNA structures have received increasing attention in medicinal chemistry owing to their key involvement in the regulation of the maintenance of genomic stability, telomere length homeostasis and transcription of important proto&#8208;oncogenes. Different classes of G4 ligands have been developed for the potential treatment of several human diseases. Among them, the carbazole scaffold with appropriate side chain appendages has attracted much interest for designing G4 ligands. Because of its large and rigid &#960;&#8208;conjugation system and ease of functionalization at three different positions, a variety of carbazole derivatives have been synthesized from various natural or synthetic sources for potential applications in G4&#8208;based therapeutics and biosensors. Herein, we provide an updated close&#8208;up of the literatures on carbazole&#8208;based G4 ligands with particular focus given on their detailed binding insights studied by NMR spectroscopy. The structure&#8208;activity relationships and the opportunities and challenges of their potential applications as biosensors and therapeutics are also discussed. This review will provide an overall picture of carbazole ligands with remarkable G4 topological preference, fluorescence properties and significant bioactivity; portraying carbazole as a very promising scaffold for assembling G4 ligands with a range of novel functional applications.

         <title>Azo&#8208;Functionalized Zirconium Based Metal&#8722;Organic Polyhedron as an Efficient Catalyst for CO2 Fixation with Epoxides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chemical fixation of CO  2  as C1 source at ambient temperature and low pressure is an energy&#8208;saving way to make use of the green&#8208;house gas, but it still remains a challenge since efficient catalyst with high catalytic active sites is required. Here a novel monoclinic azo&#8208;functionalized Zr based metal organic polyhedron (Zr&#8208;AZDA) has been prepared and applied in CO  2  fixation with epoxides. The inherent azo groups not only endow Zr&#8208;AZDA with good solubilization, but also act as basic sites to enrich CO  2  showing efficient synergistic catalysis as confirmed by TPD&#8208;CO  2  analysis. XPS results demonstrate the Zr active sites in Zr&#8208;AZDA possess suitable Lewis acidity, which satisfies both substrates activation and products desorption. DFT calculation indicates the energy barrier of the rate&#8208;determining step in CO  2  cycloaddition could be reduced remarkably (by ca. 60.9%) in the presence of Zr&#8208;AZDA, which may rationalize the mild and efficient reaction condition employed (80  o  C and 1 atm of CO  2  ). The work provides an effective multi&#8208;functional cooperative method for improvement of CO  2  cycloaddition.</dc:description>

         <title>Progress and Perspectives on Covalent Organic Frameworks (COFs) and Composites for Various Energy Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Covalent organic frameworks (COFs), being a new member of crystalline porous materials&#8217; family, have emerged as important materials for energy storage/conversion/generation devices. They possess high surface areas, ordered micro/mesopores, designable structures and an ability to precisely control electro&#8208;active groups in their pores, which broaden their application window. Thanks to their low weight density, long range crystallinity, reticular nature and tunable synthesis approach towards two and three dimensional (2D and 3D) networks, they have been found suitable for a range of challenging electrochemical applications. Our review focuses on the progress made on the design, synthesis and structure of COFs and their composites for various&#160;energy applications, such as metal&#8208;ion batteries, supercapacitors, water&#8208;splitting and solar cells. Additionally, attempts have been made to correlate the structural and mechanistic characteristics of COFs with their applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Effect of Heterometal&#8208;Functionalization and Template Exchange on the Redox Chemistry of Molecular Vanadium Oxides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polyoxometalates (POMs) have emerged as material of interest in many applications such as energy storage and conversion due to their redox activity and molecularly defined structure. However, especially for polyoxovanadates a lack of understanding between structural modifications and physicochemical properties remains. The present study leverages a lacunary dodecavanadate to systematically investigate the electronic effect of heterometal functionalization. While structural distortion affects the stability of the cluster, the redox potentials correlate with the overall cluster charge. Furthermore, we report the first bromide&#8208;templated analogue of this cluster family. While the halide anion is crucial for the formation of the cluster, no major effect on the electrochemical properties is observed. By improving the understanding of structure&#8208;property&#8208;relationship in this work, we hope to enable a more predictable tuning of redox&#8208;properties of polyoxovandates.</dc:description>

         <title>Transient Directing Groups in Metal&#8208;Organic Cooperative Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The direct functionalization of C&#8211;H bonds is among the most fundamental chemical transformations in organic synthesis. However, when the innate reactivity of the substrate cannot be utilized for the functionalization of a given single C&#8211;H bond, this selective C&#8211;H bond functionalization mostly relies on the use of directing groups that allow bringing the catalyst in close proximity to the C&#8211;H bond to be activated and these directing groups need to be installed before and cleaved after the transformation, which involves two additional undesired synthetic operations. These additional steps dramatically reduce the overall impact and the attractiveness of C&#8211;H bond functionalization techniques since classical approaches based on substrate pre&#8208;functionalization are still more straightforward and appealing. During the past decade, a different approach involving both the  in situ  installation and removal of the directing group, which can then often be used in a catalytic manner, has emerged: the transient directing group strategy. In addition to its innovative character, this strategy has brought C&#8211;H bond functionalization to an unprecedented level of usefulness and has enabled the development of remarkably efficient processes for the direct and selective introduction of functional groups onto both aromatic and aliphatic substrates. The processes unlocked by the development of these transient directing groups will be comprehensively overviewed in this review article.</dc:description>

         <title>Redox Isomerism in the S3 State of the Oxygen&#8208;Evolving Complex Resolved by Coupled Cluster Theory</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The electronic and geometric structures of the water oxidizing complex of Photosystem II in the steps of the catalytic cycle that precede dioxygen evolution remain hotly debated. Recent structural and spectroscopic investigations support contradictory redox formulations for the active&#8208;site Mn4CaO x  cofactor in the final metastable S3 state. These range from the widely accepted Mn(IV)4 oxo&#8208;hydroxo model, which presumes O&#8211;O bond formation to occur in the ultimate transient intermediate (S4) of the catalytic cycle, to a Mn(III)2Mn(IV)2 peroxo model representative of the contrasting &#8220;early&#8208;onset&#8221; O&#8211;O bond formation hypothesis. Density functional theory energetics of suggested S3 redox isomers are inconclusive because of extreme functional dependence. Here we leverage the power of the domain&#8208;based local pair natural orbital approach to coupled cluster theory, DLPNO&#8208;CCSD(T), to present the first correlated wave function theory calculations of relative stabilities for distinct redox&#8208;isomeric forms of the S3 state. Our results enable us to evaluate conflicting models for the S3 state of the OEC and to quantify the accuracy of lower&#8208;level theoretical approaches. Our assessment of the relevance of distinct redox&#8208;isomeric forms for the mechanism of biological water oxidation strongly disfavors the scenario of early&#8208;onset O&#8211;O formation advanced by literal interpretations of certain crystallographic models. The present work serves as a case study in the application of modern coupled cluster implementations to redox isomerism problems in oligonuclear transition metal systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Chemistry platform for the ultrafast continuous synthesis of high quality III&#8208;V quantum dots</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A chemistry platform for the fast continuous synthesis of III&#8208;V quantum dots is demonstrated. III&#8208;nitride QDs are prepared using short residence times (less than 30 s) in a one&#8208;step continuous process with supercritical solvents. GaN QDs prepared via this route exhibit strong UV photoluminescence with a structuring of the emission signal at low temperature (5K), confirming their high quality. An example of metal site substitution is given with the synthesis of InxGa1&#8208;xN solid solution. A continuous bandgap shift towards lower energies is demonstrated when increasing indium content with strong photoluminescence signals from UV to visible. The chemistry platform proposed could be easily extrapolated to binary and ternary III phosphides or arsenides with the homologous V source.</dc:description>

         <title>Photoelectrochemical Reduction of Carbon Dioxide with a Copper Graphitic Carbon Nitride Photocathode</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Research on the photoreduction of CO  2  &#160;has been often dominated by the use of sacrificial reducing agents. A pathway that avoids this problem would be the development of photocathodes for CO  2  &#160;reduction that could then be coupled to a photoanodic oxygen evolution reaction. Here, we present the use of copper substituted graphitic carbon nitride (Cu&#8208;CN) on a fluorinated tin oxide (FTO) electrode for the photoelectrochemical two&#8208;electron reduction of CO  2  &#160;to CO as a major product (&gt;95%) and formic acid (&lt;5%). The results show that at a potential of &#8208;2.5 V versus Fc\Fc  +  &#160;the CO  2  &#160;reduction activity of Cu&#8208;CN on FTO electrode improves by 25% upon illumination by visible light with a faradaic efficiency of nearly 100%. Independently, X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy conclusively shows a pronounced increase in the electrical conductivity of the Cu&#8208;CN upon white light illumination under vacuum and a contactless measuring configuration. This photo&#8208;assisted charge mobility is shown to play a key role in the increased reactivity and faradaic efficiency for the reduction of CO  2  .</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Gold (I) catalyzed formal [4+2] cycloaddition of O &#8208;aryl ynol ethers 1 and enol ethers 2 is described. This intermolecular reaction between two electron&#8208;rich unsaturated systems takes place, under mild conditions, in the presence of 5 mol% [IPrAu(CH 3 CN)]SbF 6 as catalyst giving chromene derivatives with good yields. The cycloaddition is completely regio&#8208; and stereoselective, as well as versatile for both reactives. Silyl enol ethers also can react in the same way and in the same reaction conditions with quantitative yields. A plausible mechanism through a selective addition of the enol ether to the alkyne gold activated complex followed by an intramolecular aromatic electrophilic substitution is proposed. Several experimental results support the presence of a cationic oxonium intermediate prior to the aromatic substitution. The reaction represents a new entry to the chromene core,</dc:description>

         <title>Spectroscopic and Computational Study of Boronium Ionic Liquids and Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Boronium cation&#8208;based ionic liquids (ILs) have demonstrated high thermal stability and a &gt;5.8 V electrochemical stability window. Additionally, IL&#8208;based electrolytes containing the salt LiTFSI have shown stable cycling against the Li metal anode, the &#8220;Holy grail&#8221; of rechargeable lithium batteries. However, the basic spectroscopic characterisation needed for further development and effective application is missing for these promising ILs and electrolytes. In this work, attenuated total reflection Fourier transform infrared (ATR&#8208;FTIR) spectroscopy and density functional theory (DFT) calculations are used in combination to characterise four ILs and electrolytes based on the [NNBH2]+  and [(TMEDA)BH2] &#160;boronium cations and the [FSI]&#8211;  and [TFSI]&#8211;  anions. Using this combined experimental and computational approach, proper understanding of the role of different ion&#8208;ion interactions for the Li cation coordination environment in the electrolytes was achieved. Furthermore, the calculated vibrational frequencies assisted in the proper mode assignments for the ILs and in providing insights into the spectroscopic features expected at the interface created when they are adsorbed on a Li(001) surface. A reproducible synthesis procedure for [(TMEDA)BH2]+  is also reported. The fundamental findings presented in this work are beneficial for any future studies that utilise IL based electrolytes in next generation Li metal batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Design of Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Dynamic Covalent Delivery Systems for Volatile Compounds&#160;(Part 1): Controlled Hydrolysis of Micellar Amphiphilic Imines in Water</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Despite their intrinsic hydrolysable character, imine bonds can become remarkably stable in water when self&#8208;assembled in amphiphilic micellar structures. In the present article, we systematically study some of these structures and the influence of various parameters that can be used to take control over their hydrolysis, including pH, concentration, position of the imine function in the amphiphilic structure, relative lengths of the linked hydrophilic and hydrophobic moieties. Thermodynamic and kinetic data lead us to the rational design of stable imines in water, partly based on the location of the imine function within the hydrophobic part of the amphiphile and on a predictable quantitative term that we define as the total hydrophilic&#8208;lipophilic balance (HLB). In addition, we show that such stable systems are also stimuli&#8208;responsive and therefore, of potential interest in trapping and releasing micellar components on demand.</dc:description>

         <title>Design of Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Dynamic Covalent Delivery Systems for Volatile Compounds (Part 2): Fragrance&#8208;Releasing Cleavable Surfactants in Functional Perfumery Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Amphiphilic imines prepared by condensation of a hydrophobic fragrance aldehyde with a hydrophilic amine derived from a hydrophilic poly(propylene oxide) and poly(ethylene oxide) diblock copolymer were investigated as cleavable surfactant profragrances in applications of functional perfumery. In water, the cleavable surfactants assemble into micelles that allow solubilization of perfume molecules that are not covalently attached to the surfactant. Dynamic headspace analysis on a glass surface showed that solubilized perfume molecules evaporated in a similar manner in the presence of the cleavable surfactant as compared with a non&#8208;cleavable reference surfactant. Under application conditions, the cleavable surfactant imine hydrolysed to release the covalently linked fragrance aldehyde. The profragrances were stable during storage in aqueous media and upon dilution showed a blooming effect for the hydrolytical fragrance release and a more balanced performance of a solubilized perfume by retaining the more volatile fragrances and boosting the evaporation of the less volatile fragrances.</dc:description>

         <title>Perylene&#8208;Cy3 FRET System to Analyze Photoactive DNA Structures</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report a new FRET system for structural analyses of DNA duplexes using perylene and Cy3 as donor and acceptor, respectively, linked at the termini of a DNA duplex via D&#8208;threoninol. Experimentally obtained FRET efficiencies were in good agreement with theoretical values calculated based on canonical B&#8208;form DNA. Due to the relatively long F&#246;rster radius, this system can be used to analyze large DNA structures, and duplexes containing photo&#8208;reactive molecules can be analyzed since perylene can be excited with visible light. The system was used to analyze a DNA duplex containing stilbene, demonstrating that in the region of the stilbene cluster the duplex adopts a ladder&#8208;like structure rather than helical one. Upon photodimerization between stilbene residues, FRET efficiencies indicated the reaction does not disturb DNA duplex. This FRET system will be useful for analysis of photoreactions of nucleobases as well as a wide range of nucleic acid structures.</dc:description>

         <title>Frustrated Lewis&#8208;Pair Neighbors at the Xanthene Framework: Epimerization at Phosphorus and Cooperative Formation of Macrocyclic Adduct Structures</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The meso and rac diastereoisomers of two P&#8208;stereogenic 4,5&#8208;bis(mesityl,alkynylphosphanyl)dimethylxanthenes underwent slow thermally induced interconversion. The activation barrier of the P&#8208;propynyl derivative was determined experimentally and by DFT calculation. Adding HB(C6F5)2 to the tert&#8208;butylethynyl&#8208;P&#8208;containing system gave intramolecular pairs of geminal frustrated P/B Lewis pairs at the xanthene&#8208;derived backbone. This reaction also proceeded with epimerization of the P&#8208;stereogenic phosphanyl units. The new FLP pairs at the xanthene backbone formed bridged macrocyclic adducts with a variety of bifunctional Lewis base donors.







Abstract
Attachment of a pair of P&#8208;stereogenic mesityl(alkynyl)phosphanyl groups at the 4&#8208; and 5&#8208;positions of a 9,9&#8208;dimethylxanthene framework gave mixtures of the respective rac&#8208; and meso&#8208;bisphosphanyl diastereoisomers. They slowly epimerized in a thermally induced reaction with Gibbs activation barriers of about 25&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1 at room temperature (measured and DFT calculated). The reaction of the meso&#8208;mesityl(tert&#8208;butylethynyl)phosphanyl derivative with two molar equivalents of Piers&#8242; borane [HB(C6F5)2] led to the formation of the alkylidene&#8208;bridged geminal bisphosphane/borane&#8208;frustrated Lewis pair system. The compound was obtained enriched (&gt;85&#8201;%) in the rac diastereoisomer. With a variety of bifunctional donor substrates, the rac&#8208;bis&#8208;P/B FLP formed macrocyclic compounds. They were all formally derived from meso&#8208;configurated diastereoisomers of the bisphosphanylxanthene backbone.

         <title>Polymerization of Allenes by Using an Iron(II) &#946;&#8208;Diketiminate Pre&#8208;Catalyst to Generate High Mn Polymers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rare example of transition metal&#8208;catalyzed polymerization of aryl allenes is presented. Reactions are mild and generate very high Mn polymers with narrow polydispersity by using a well&#8208;defined Fe(II) pre&#8208;catalyst and a hydride additive. [2+2] cycloaddition to form cyclobutanes is also viable using the same catalytic system.







Abstract
Herein, we report an iron(II)&#8208;catalyzed polymerization of arylallenes. This reaction proceeds rapidly at room temperature in the presence of a hydride co&#8208;catalyst to generate polymers of weight up to Mn=189 000&#8197;Da. We have determined the polymer structure and chain length for a range of monomers through a combination of NMR, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and gel permeation chromatography (GPC) analysis. Mechanistically, we postulate that the co&#8208;catalyst does not react to form an iron(II) hydride in&#8197;situ, but instead the chain growth is proceeding via a reactive Fe(III) species.

     alt="Polymerization of Allenes by Using an Iron(II) &#946;-Diketiminate Pre-Catalyst to Generate High Mn Polymers"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A rare example&lt;/b&gt; of transition metal-catalyzed polymerization of aryl allenes is presented. Reactions are mild and generate very high &lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; polymers with narrow polydispersity by using a well-defined Fe(II) pre-catalyst and a hydride additive. [2+2] cycloaddition to form cyclobutanes is also viable using the same catalytic system.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Herein, we report an iron(II)-catalyzed polymerization of arylallenes. This reaction proceeds rapidly at room temperature in the presence of a hydride co-catalyst to generate polymers of weight up to &lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;=189 000&#8197;Da. We have determined the polymer structure and chain length for a range of monomers through a combination of NMR, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and gel permeation chromatography (GPC) analysis. Mechanistically, we postulate that the co-catalyst does not react to form an iron(II) hydride in&#8197;situ, but instead the chain growth is proceeding via a reactive Fe(III) species. We have also performed kinetic and isotopic experiments to further our understanding. The formation of a highly unusual 1,3-substituted cyclobutane side-product is also investigated.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Upgrading Octane Number of Naphtha by a Robust and Easily Attainable Metal&#8208;Organic Framework through Selective Molecular Sieving of Alkane Isomers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Time for an upgrade: The separation of alkane isomers is investigated on a simple, easily available metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF), Co3(HCOO)6. The compound is capable of splitting monobranched and dibranched alkanes through selective molecular exclusion. In addition, the material exhibits excellent separation of naphtha, outperforming benchmark zeolites and MOFs, making it a promising candidate for naphtha separation and RON upgrading.







Abstract
The separation of alkanes, particularly monobranched and dibranched isomers, is of paramount importance in the petrochemical industry for optimizing the feedstock of ethylene production as well as for upgrading the octane number of gasoline. Here, we report the full separation of linear/monobranched alkanes from their dibranched isomers by a robust and easily scalable metal&#8208;organic framework material, Co3(HCOO)6. The compound completely excludes dibranched alkanes but adsorbs their linear and monobranched isomers, as evidenced by single&#8208;component and multicomponent adsorption measurements. More importantly, the material exhibits excellent performance in separating naphtha and is capable of providing high quality feedstock for the production of ethylene and gasoline components with high octane number, making it a promising candidate for naphtha separation in petrochemical industry.

         <title>Walter Reppe Revival &#8211; Identification and Genesis of Copper Acetylides Cu2C2 as Active Species in Ethynylation Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>More than six decades after proposing copper acetylide, Cu  2  C  2  , as catalytically active species in ethynylation reactions by Walter Reppe, the explosive species have been experimentally identified and investigated during catalysis in detail now. Taking into account specific safety precautions, unequivocal qualitative characterization was achieved by Raman spectroscopy and X&#8208;ray powder diffraction of supported copper catalysts Cu/Bi/SiO  2  during and after activation and catalysis in comparison to bulk Cu  2  C  2  materials. Quantification of Cu  2  C  2  succeeded by thermal analysis and Raman spectroscopy. Its formation in aqueous suspension is studied starting from copper(II) oxide catalysts including dissolution, reduction and precipitation steps. Copper acetylide formation can be correlated with catalytic performance in the ethynylation of formaldehyde to 1,4&#8208;butynediol.</dc:description>

         <title>Quadruple Role of Pd Catalyst in Domino Reaction Involving Aryl to Alkyl 1,5&#8208;Pd Migration to Access 1,9&#8208;Bridged Triptycenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Pd&#8208;catalyzed domino reaction of 1,8,13&#8208;tribromo&#8208;9&#8208;methoxytriptycenes is reported. Under conventional Suzuki coupling conditions, the triptycenes underwent multiple transformations to give 1,9&#8208;bridged triptycenes. Based on mechanistic investigations, a single Pd catalyst functions as Pd0, PdII and PdIV species to catalyze four distinct processes: 1)&#8197;aryl&#8208;to&#8208;alkyl 1,5&#8208;Pd migration, 2)&#8197;intramolecular arylation, 3)&#8197;homocoupling of phenylboronic acid and 4)&#8197;Suzuki coupling.

         <title>Monitoring the Structure Evolution of Titanium Oxide Photocatalysts: From the Molecular Form via the Amorphous State to the Crystalline Phase</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Titanium oxide photocatalysts with ordered domains of less than 7 &#197; in size were synthesized from titanium(IV) ethoxide as molecular precursor. UV light induces a color change from white to dark, corresponding to a change in the oxidation state of Ti. Upon heating, the structural order in the core of the as&#8208;synthesized particle extends. During transformation to anatase, the changes in the local structure were investigated by in situ total scattering experiments and subsequent pair distribution function (PDF) analysis. More information can be found in the Full Paper by C. Weidenthaler et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202101117).

         <title>C=C Bond Oxidative Cleavage of BODIPY Photocages by Visible Light</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Contrary to the cleavage of C&#8722;X single bonds, the photoreaction of the C=C bonds of electron&#8208;rich oxidative alkenes remains a challenge. This work presents a novel photoactivation of dialkenyl&#8208;substituted BODIPY photocages to release para&#8208;hydroxy benzaldehyde under visible light illumination in an aqueous environment through a formal [2+2] cycloaddition of singlet oxygen and a double bond. A real&#8208;time monitoring assay revealed that a mannose&#8208;functionalized photocage can target HepG2 cancer cells and release an aldehyde and a biothiol probe under illumination. More information can be found in the Communication by J. Geng et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202101833).

         <title>The CdIn2S4/WO3 Nanosheet Composite Has a Significantly Enhanced Photo&#8208;electrochemical Cathodic Protection Performance and Excellent Electron Storage Capability</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photoelectrochemical cathodic protection technology is considered to be a green technology that protects metals from corrosion as it uses solar energy for corrosion protection and does not consume any anode materials.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Photoelectrochemical cathodic protection&lt;/b&gt; technology is considered to be a green technology that protects metals from corrosion as it uses solar energy for corrosion protection and does not consume any anode materials.

         <title>Mechanistic Aspects of the Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura Cross&#8208;Coupling Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The story of C&#8208;C bond formation includes several reactions, and surely Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura is among the most outstanding ones. Herein, a brief historical overview of insights regarding the reaction mechanism is provided. In particular, the formation of the catalytically active species is probably the main concern, thus the preactivation is in competition with, or even assumes the role of the rate determining step (rds) of the overall reaction. Computational chemistry is key in identifying the rds and thus leading to milder conditions on an experimental level by means of predictive catalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Osteosarcoma stem cell potent gallium(III)&#8208;polypyridyl complexes bearing diflunisal</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report the anti&#8208;osteosarcoma stem cell (OSC) properties of a series of gallium(III)&#8208;polypyridyl complexes (5&#8208;7) containing diflunisal, a non&#8208;steroidal anti&#8208;inflammatory drug. The most effective complex within the series,  6  (containing 3,4,7,8&#8208;tetramethyl&#8208;1,10&#8208;phenanthroline) displayed similar potency towards bulk osteosarcoma cells and OSCs, in the nanomolar range. Remarkably,  6  exhibited significantly higher monolayer and sarcosphere OSC potency (up to three orders of magnitude) than clinically approved drugs used in frontline (cisplatin and doxorubicin) and secondary (etoposide, ifosfamide, and carboplatin) osteosarcoma treatments. Mechanistic studies show that  6  downregulates cyclooxygenase&#8208;2 (COX&#8208;2) and kills osteosarcoma cells in a COX&#8208;2 dependent manner. Furthermore,  6  induces genomic DNA damage and caspase&#8208;dependent apoptosis. To the best of our knowledge,  6  is the first metal complex to kill osteosarcoma cells by simultaneously inhibiting COX&#8208;2 and damaging nuclear DNA.</dc:description>

         <title>Type&#8208;II clathrate Na24&#8211;&#948;Ge136 from a Redox&#8208;Preparation Route</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The metastable type&#8208;II clathrate Na  24&#8208;  &#948;  Ge  136  was obtained from Na  12  Ge  17  by applying a two&#8208;step procedure. At first, Na  12  Ge  17  was reacted at 70&#160;&#176;C with a solution of benzophenone in the ionic liquid (IL) 1,3&#8208;dibutyl&#8208;2&#8208;methylimidazolium&#8208;bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl) azanide. The IL was inert towards Na  12  Ge  17  , but capable of dissolving the sodium salts formed in the redox reaction. By annealing at 340&#160;&#176;C in argon atmosphere, the X&#8209;ray amorphous intermediate product was transformed to crystalline Na  24&#8208;  &#948;  Ge  136  (  d  &#8776; 2) and a&#8209;Ge in an about 1:1 mass ratio. The product was characterized by X&#8209;ray powder diffraction, chemical analysis, and  23  Na solid&#8208;state NMR. Metallic properties of Na  24&#8211;  &#948;  Ge  136  were revealed by a significant Knight shift of the  23  Na NMR signals and by a Pauli&#8208;paramagnetic contribution to the magnetic susceptibility. At room temperature, Na  24&#8208;  &#948;  Ge  136  slowly ages, with a tendency to volume decrease and sodium loss.</dc:description>

         <title>A Comprehensive Study on the Full Series of Alkali Metal Selenocyanates AI[SeCN] (AI = Li &#8211; Cs)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The full series of quasibinary alkali metal selenocyanates was synthesized either by oxidation of the respective cyanides (  A  = Li&#8211;Rb) or by metathesis (  A  = Cs). For Li[SeCN] only ball&#8208;milling and subsequent annealing led to the isolation of the quasibinary selenocyanate. Their structures were refined from single&#8208;crystal and powder X&#8208;ray data. The respective solid&#8208;state IR and Raman spectra were interpreted with the aid of solid&#8208;state quantum&#8208;mechanical calculations and DSC&#8208;TGA measurements allowed for extraction of melting points. Only for Li[SeCN] a possible phase transition was observed that is discussed on the basis of VT&#8208;PXRD experiments.

         <title>Solid&#8208;State Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Techniques for the Structural Characterization of Geminal Alane&#8208;Phosphane Frustrated Lewis Pairs and Secondary Adducts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The first comprehensive solid&#8208;state Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) characterization of geminal alane&#8208;phosphane Frustrated L  ewis  Pairs (Al/P FLPs) is reported. Their relevant NMR parameters (isotropic chemical shifts, direct and indirect  27  Al&#8208;  31  P spin&#8208;spin coupling constants, and  27  Al nuclear electric quadrupole coupling tensor components) have been determined by numerical analysis of the experimental NMR lineshapes and compared with values computed from the known crystal structures using density functional theory (DFT) methods. Our work demonstrates that the  31  P NMR chemical shifts for the studied Al/P FLPs are very sensitive to slight structural inequivalences. The  27  Al NMR central transition signals are spread out over a broad frequency range (&gt;200 kHz), owing to the presence of strong nuclear electric quadrupolar interactions that can be well&#8208;reproduced by the static  27  Al Wideband Uniform Rate Smooth Truncation (WURST) Carr&#8722;Purcell&#8722;Meiboom&#8722;Gill (WCPMG) NMR experiment.  27  Al chemical shifts and quadrupole tensor components offer a facile and clear distinction between three&#8208; and four&#8208;coordinate aluminum environments. For measuring internuclear Al  &#8230;.  P distances a new Resonance&#8208;Echo Saturation&#8208;Pulse Double&#8208;Resonance (RESPDOR) experiment was developed using efficient saturation via frequency&#8208;swept WURST pulses. The successful implementation of this widely applicable technique indicates that internuclear Al  &#8230;.  P distances in these compounds can be measured within a precision of &#177;0.1 &#197;.</dc:description>

         <title>The Role of Alkali Cation Intercalates on the Electrochemical Characteristics of Nb2CTX Mxene for Energy Storage</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The intercalation of cations into layered structure electrode materials has long been studied in depth in energy storage applications. In particular, Li  +  , Na  +  , and K  +  alkali metal&#8208;based cation transports in energy storage devices such as batteries and electrochemical capacitors are closely related to the capacitance behavior. Herein, we exploited different sizes of cations from aqueous salt electrolyte intercalating into layered Nb  2  CT  x  electrode in a supercapacitor for the first time. As a result, we demonstrated that capacitive performance was dependent on cation intercalation behavior. The interlayer spacing expansion of the electrode material can be observed in Li  2  SO  4  , Na  2  SO  4  , and K  2  SO  4  electrolytes with the increased  d  &#8208;spacing. Additionally, our results showed that the Nb  2  CT  x  electrode exhibited higher electrochemical performance in the presence of Li  2  SO  4  than in that of Na  2  SO  4  and K  2  SO  4  . This is partly because smaller size Li  +  transports fast and intercalates between the layers of Nb  2  CT  x  easily. Poor ion transport in the Na  2  SO  4  electrolyte limited the electrode capacitance and presented the lowest electrochemical performance, although the cation radius is following Li  +  &gt;Na  +  &gt;K  +  .

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The intercalation of cations into layered structure electrode materials has long been studied in depth in energy storage applications. In particular, Li  +  , Na  +  , and K  +  alkali metal-based cation transports in energy storage devices such as batteries and electrochemical capacitors are closely related to the capacitance behavior. Herein, we exploited different sizes of cations from aqueous salt electrolyte intercalating into layered Nb  2  CT  x  electrode in a supercapacitor for the first time. As a result, we demonstrated that capacitive performance was dependent on cation intercalation behavior. The interlayer spacing expansion of the electrode material can be observed in Li  2  SO  4  , Na  2  SO  4  , and K  2  SO  4  electrolytes with the increased  d  -spacing. Additionally, our results showed that the Nb  2  CT  x  electrode exhibited higher electrochemical performance in the presence of Li  2  SO  4  than in that of Na  2  SO  4  and K  2  SO  4  . This is partly because smaller size Li  +  transports fast and intercalates between the layers of Nb  2  CT  x  easily. Poor ion transport in the Na  2  SO  4  electrolyte limited the electrode capacitance and presented the lowest electrochemical performance, although the cation radius is following Li  +  &amp;gt;Na  +  &amp;gt;K  +  . Our experimental studies provide direct evidence for the intercalation mechanism of Li  +  , Na  +  , and K  +  on the 2D layered Nb  2  CT  x  electrode, which provides a new path for exploring the relationship between intercalated cations and other MXene electrodes&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>DNA&#8208;Triggered Enhancement of Singlet Oxygen Production by Pyridinium Alkynylanthracenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>There is an ongoing interest in  1  O  2  sensitizers, whose activity is selectively controlled by their interaction with DNA. To this end, we synthesized three isomeric pyridinium alkynylanthracenes  2  o  &#9472;  p  and a water&#8208;soluble trapping reagent for  1  O  2  . In water and in the absence of DNA, these dyes show a poor efficiency to sensitize the photooxygenation of the trapping reagent as they decompose due to electron transfer processes. In contrast, in the presence of DNA  1  O  2  is generated from the excited DNA&#8208;bound ligand. The interactions of  2  o  &#8211;  p  with DNA were investigated by various analytical methods. Our studies revealed an intercalative binding with an orientation of the long pyridyl&#8208;alkynyl axis parallel to the main axis of the DNA base pairs. In the presence of poly(dA:dT), all three isomers show an enhanced formation of singlet oxygen, as indicated by the reaction of the latter with the trapping reagent. With green light irradiation of isomer  2  o  in poly(dA:dT), the conversion rate of the trapping reagent is enhanced by a factor &gt;10. The formation of  1  O  2  was confirmed by control experiments under anaerobic conditions, in deuterated solvents, or by addition of  1  O  2  quenchers. When bound to poly(dG:dC), the opposite effect was observed only for isomers  2  o  and  2  m  , namley the trapping reagent reacted significantly slower. Overall, we showed that pyridinium alkynylanthracenes are very useful intercalators, that exhibit an enhanced photochemical  1  O  2  generation in the DNA&#8208;bound state.</dc:description>

         <title>Construction of Single&#8208;Atom Nanozyme for Enhanced Chemodynamic Therapy and Chemotherapy of Tumor</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>To fulfill the demand of precision and personalized medicine, single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) have been emerged as a frontier in the biomedical fields due to the enzyme&#8208;mimic catalysis. Herein, we present a biocompatible and versatile nanoagent consisting of single&#8208;atom iron&#8208;containing nanoparticles (SAF NPs), DOX and A549 cell membrane (CM). The designed porous Iron&#8208;based SACs was originally served as a drug&#8208;carrying nanoplatform to release DOX selectively in tumor microenvironment (TME) for tumor chemotherapy (CT) due to the high loading capacity (155%) for DOX, which signifies SACs are a promising candidate for universal delivery cargo. Besides, the designed single&#8208;atom nanoagent can perform like peroxidase, which effectively trigger in situ tumor&#8208;specific Fenton reaction to generate abundant toxic hydroxyl radicals (&#183;OH) selectively under the acidic TME for chemodynamic therapy (CDT). With the combination of CDT and CT, the constructed SAF NPs@DOX@CM nanoagent demonstrate better in vivo therapeutic performance than single&#8208;pathway therapy. In the meantime, after modified with CM, SAF NPs@DOX@CM can achieve homologous binding to target tumor tissues and avoid early clearance. This study presents a type of multifunctional SACs for enhanced cancer treatment via the capacity of drug carrier combined with enzymatic therapies of single&#8208;atom catalytic sites.</dc:description>

         <title>Rational Design of Semiconductor Heterojunctions for Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electronic structure calculations provide a useful complement to experimental characterization tools in the atomic&#8208;scale design of semiconductor heterojunctions for photocatalysis. The band alignment of the heterojunction is of fundamental importance to achieve an efficient charge carriers separation, so as to reduce electron/hole recombination and improve photoactivity. The accurate prediction of the offsets of valence and conduction bands in the constituent units is thus of key importance but poses several methodological and practical problems. In this Minireview we address some of these problems by considering selected examples of binary and ternary semiconductor heterojunctions and how these are determined at the level of density functional theory (DFT). The atomically precise description of the interface, the consequent charge polarization, the role of quantum confinement, the possibility to use facet engineering to determine a specific band alignment, are among the effects discussed, with particular attention to pros and cons of each one of these aspects. This analysis shows the increasingly important role of accurate electronic structure calculations to drive the design and the preparation of new interfaces with desired properties.</dc:description>

         <title>Binding sites, vibrations and spin&#8208;lattice relaxation times in europium(II)&#8208;based metallofullerene spin qubits</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>To design molecular spin qubits with enhanced quantum coherence, a control of the coupling between the local vibrations and the spin states is crucial, which could be realized in principle by engineering molecular structures via coordination chemistry. To this end, understanding the underlying structural factors that govern the spin relaxation is a central topic. Here, we report the investigation of the spin dynamics in a series of chemically&#8208;designed europium(II)&#8208;based endohedral metallofullerenes (EMFs). By introducing a unique structural difference, i.e. metal&#8208;cage binding site, while keeping other molecular parameters constant between different complexes, these manifest the key role of the three low energy metal&#8208;based vibrations in mediating the spin&#8208;lattice relaxation times (  T  1  ). The temperature dependence of  T  1  can thus be normalized by the frequencies of these low energy vibrations to show an unprecedentedly universal behavior for EMFs in frozen CS  2  solution. Our theoretical analysis indicates that this structural difference determines not only the vibrational rigidity but also spin&#8208;vibration coupling in these EMF&#8208;based qubit candidates.</dc:description>

         <title>Ionization and Photofragmentation of Isolated Metalloporphyrin Cations Investigated by VUV Action Spectroscopy**
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The isolated metalloporphyrin cations FePPIX+, CoPPIX+ and ZnPPIX+ have been studied in the gas phase by action spectroscopy in the vacuum&#8208;ultraviolet (VUV) range using electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry and synchrotron radiation. The ionization energy of each compound has been measured. Photoexcitation and photoionization lead to strikingly different fragmentation pathways. Evidence for non&#8208;statistical dissociation processes including water losses were identified. Fragment assignments have been supported by additional high&#8208;resolution collision&#8208;induced dissociation experiments on a hybrid quadrupole&#8208;orbital mass spectrometer.







Abstract
We investigated the photoionization and fragmentation of isolated metal protoporphyrin IX cations (MPPIX+ with M=Fe, Co, Zn) by means of vacuum&#8208;ultraviolet (VUV) action spectroscopy in the energy range of 8.5&#8211;35&#8197;eV. Experiments were carried out in the gas phase by interfacing an electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometer with a synchrotron beamline. The mass spectra and partial ion yields show that photoexcitation of the precursor ions predominantly leads to .CH2COOH radical side&#8208;chain losses of the macrocycle with additional methyl radical (.CH3) side&#8208;chain losses. Ionization, in contrast, leads to the formation of the intact ionized precursor and various doubly charged fragments which are mostly due to side&#8208;chain cleavages. Although statistical fragmentation dominates, we found evidence for non&#8208;statistical processes such as new fragments involving for example single and double H2O losses, indicating that different relaxation mechanisms are at play upon photoionization compared to photoexcitation. The measured ionization energies were 9.6&#177;0.2&#8197;eV, 9.4&#177;0.2&#8197;eV and 9.6&#177;0.2&#8197;eV for FePPIX+, CoPPIX+ and ZnPPIX+, respectively.

         <title>Design Strategies of Si/C Composite Anode for Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Various Si/C materials by different synthetic methods are reviewed along with their respective advantages and disadvantages. In addition, Si/C materials formed by Si and different carbon&#8208;based materials is summarized, where the influences of carbons on the electrochemical performance of Si are emphasized. Lastly, future research direction in the material design and optimization of Si/C materials is proposed to fill the current gap in the development of efficient Si/C anode for lithium&#8208;ion batteries.







Abstract
Silicon&#8208;based materials that have higher theoretical specific capacity than other conventional anodes, such as carbon materials, Li2TiO3 materials and Sn&#8208;based materials, become a hot topic in research of lithium&#8208;ion battery (LIB). However, the low conductivity and large volume expansion of silicon&#8208;based materials hinders the commercialization of silicon&#8208;based materials. Until recent years, these issues are alleviated by the combination of carbon&#8208;based materials. In this review, the preparation of Si/C materials by different synthetic methods in the past decade is reviewed along with their respective advantages and disadvantages. In addition, Si/C materials formed by silicon and different carbon&#8208;based materials is summarized, where the influences of carbons on the electrochemical performance of silicon are emphasized. Lastly, future research direction in the material design and optimization of Si/C materials is proposed to fill the current gap in the development of efficient Si/C anode for LIBs.

         <title>The Effect of Interlayer Anion Grafting on Water Oxidation Electrocatalysis: A Comparative Study of Ni&#8208; and Co&#8208;Based Brucite&#8208;Type Layered Hydroxides, Layered Double Hydroxides and Hydroxynitrate Salts</title>

         <dc:description>
Grafting of interlayer anions to brucite&#8208;type layered structures impacts electrocatalytic performance. Three Ni and Co compounds are investigated: (i) brucite&#8208;type M(OH)2 (no interlayer anions), (ii) LDHs (free interlayer anions), and (iii) hydroxynitrate salts (grafted interlayer anions). Substitution of OH&#8722; by NO3&#8722; allows for larger layer separation and reduced electron density at the metal center contributing to earlier onset of OER activity.







Abstract
The urge for carbon&#8208;neutral green energy conversion and storage technologies has invoked the resurgence of interest in applying brucite&#8208;type materials as low&#8208;cost oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts in basic media. Transition metal layered hydroxides belonging to the brucite&#8208;type structure family have been shown to display remarkable electrochemical activity. Recent studies on the earth&#8208;abundant Fe3+ containing m&#246;ssbauerite and Fe3+ rich Co&#8722;Fe layered oxyhydroxide carbonates have suggested that grafted interlayer anions might play a key role in OER catalysis. To probe the effect of such interlayer anion grafting in brucite&#8208;like layered hydroxides, we report here a systematic study on the electrocatalytic performance of three distinct Ni and Co brucite&#8208;type layered structures, namely, (i) brucite&#8208;type M(OH)2 without any interlayer anions, (ii) LDHs with free interlayer anions, and (iii) hydroxynitrate salts with grafted interlayer anions. The electrochemical results indeed show that grafting has an evident impact on the electronic structure and the observed OER activity. Ni&#8208; and Co&#8208;hydroxynitrate salts with grafted anions display notably earlier formations of the electrocatalytically active species. Particularly Co&#8208;hydroxynitrate salts exhibit lower overpotentials at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 (&#951;=0.34&#8197;V) and medium current densities of 100&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 (&#951;=0.40&#8197;V) compared to the corresponding brucite&#8208;type hydroxides and LDH materials.

         <dc:description>
Single&#8208;molecule magnets (SMMs) have great potential application in a range of pioneering areas, such as quantum computing, spintronics, and high&#8208;density information storage. The properties of the molecules presented here are based on the molecular total spin and the magnetic anisotropy created by the lanthanides in a particular crystal field. An important element in SMMs&#8217; optimization is the ligand design. Poly imido sulfur ligands are perfectly suited as the polar S+&#8722;N&#8722;&#8208;bond facilitates electronic and geometric adaptability to various f&#8208;metals. Particularly the acute N&#8211;Dy&#8211;N bite angle generates advantageous magnetic properties. More information can be found in the Full Paper by S. Demir, D. Stalke et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202101076).

         <title>A Novel Reactivity of Phosphanylalumane (&gt;P&#8722;Al&lt;): Reversible Addition of a Saturated Interelement Bond to Olefins</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A P&#8722;Al single&#8208;bond species, phosphanylalumane, was found to bind relatively small terminal alkenes (ethylene, propylene, and hex&#8208;1&#8208;ene). Although the ethylene adduct did notundergo any elimination of ethylene even under vacuum conditions, heating the terminal alkene adducts resulted in the release of the corresponding alkenes and regenerated the P&#8722;Al bond. Theethylene adduct can work as a new saturated C2 vicinal P/Al&#8208;based frustrated Lewis pair (FLP), showing characteristic reactivity through the elimination of ethylene. More information can be found in the Communication by Y. Mizuhata, N. Tokitoh, and T. Yanagisawa (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202101649).

         <title>Crystal Structures of AlCr2 and MoSi2: Same Structure Type vs. Different Bonding Pattern</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The quite &#8216;hidden&#8217; compound AlCr2 was isolated for the first time as micro&#8208;fabricated single crystals. Crystal structure and chemical bonding analyses reveal largely different interactions as a consequence of the inverted coloring pattern with respect to prototypical MoSi2. More information can be found in the Full Paper by H. Borrmann et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202100817).

         <title>In Situ Synchrotron X&#8208;ray Diffraction Studies of the Mechanochemical Synthesis of ZnS from its Elements</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The mechanism of the mechanochemical synthesis of cubic ZnS from its elements via ball milling was studied by in situ synchrotron diffraction experiments coupled with gas pressure measurements inside the milling vessel. The combination of both techniques reveals a heterogeneous reaction mechanism including gaseous sulfur and solid zinc. Moreover, the reaction kinetics of the phase transition from cubic to hexagonal ZnS was determined from the in situ synchrotron diffraction experiments. More information can be found in the Full Paper by C.&#8197;Weidenthaler et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202101260).

         <title>Imidazolium Functionalized Chemically Robust Ionic Porous Organic Polymers (iPOPs) toward Toxic Oxo&#8208;pollutants Capture from Water</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fabricating new and efficient materials aimed at containment of water contamination, in particular removing toxic heavy metal based oxo&#8208;anions (for example CrO  4  2&#8208;  , TcO  4  &#8208;  ) holds paramount importance. In this work, we report two new highly stable imidazolium based ionic porous organic polymers (  i  POPs) decorated with multiple interaction sites along with electrostatics driven adsorptive removal of such oxo&#8208;anions from water. Both the  i  POPs (namely,  i  POP&#8208;3 and  i  POP&#8208;4) exhibited rapid sieving kinetics and very high saturation uptake capacity for CrO  4  2&#8208;  anions (170 and 141 mg g  &#8208;1  for  i  POP&#8208;3 and  i  POP&#8208;4 respectively) and ReO  4  &#8208;  (515.5 and 350.3 mg g  &#8208;1  for  i  POP&#8208;3 and  i  POP&#8208;4 respectively), where ReO  4  &#8208;  anions being the non&#8208;radioactive surrogative counterpart of radioactive TcO  4  &#8208;  ions. Noticeably, both  i  POPs showed exceptional selectivity towards CrO  4  2&#8208;  and ReO  4  &#8208;  even in presence of several other concurrent anions such as Br  &#8208;  , Cl  &#8208;  , SO  4  2&#8208;  , NO  3  &#8208;  etc. The theoretical binding energy calculations via DFT method further confirmed the preferencial interaction sites as well as binding energies of both  i  POPs towards CrO  4  2&#8208;  and ReO  4  &#8208;  over all other competing anions which corroborates with the experimental high capacity and selectivity of  i  POPs towards such oxo&#8208;anions.</dc:description>

         <title>KCs2[Pb2Br5(HCOO)2]: A Polar 3D Lead&#8208;Bromide Framework Exhibiting Strong Second&#8208;Harmonic Generation Response</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The discovery of new nonlinear optical (NLO) crystals with excellent properties is in urgently demand because of their ability to generate coherent light. Herein, we report an unique NLO lead bromide formate, KCs  2  [Pb  2  Br  5  (HCOO)  2  ], which has been synthesized by a mix&#8208;solvothermal method.  KCs  2  [Pb  2  Br  5  (HCOO)  2  ] exhibits strong phase&#8208;matching second&#8208;harmonic generation (SHG) response (6.5 &#215; KDP), large birefringence (0.16  @ 1064 nm), and wide transparent window in most visible light and mid&#8208;IR region. Interestingly, KCs  2  [Pb  2  Br  5  (HCOO)  2  ] features a polar 3D lead&#8208;bromide framework in which adjacent Pb&#8208;Br layers containing coplanar Pb  6  Br  6  rings not only parallel to each other, but also orient in the same direction. These oriented arrangements are responsible for the strong SHG response and large birefringence that are elucidated by both local dipole moment and theoretical calculations. This research provides a new strategy to explore subsequent NLO crystals.</dc:description>

         <title>How to Prepare Kinetically Stable Self&#8208;assembled Pt12L24 Nanocages while Circumventing Kinetic Traps</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Avoiding the unwanted: Robust Pt12L24 assemblies were selectively formed by a combination of thermodynamic tuning, achieved by rigidifying the ligands, and kinetic tuning with catalytic amounts of additives. The described methodology can be applied to prepare a variety of functionalised platinum assemblies that were shown to be kinetically stable against biologically and catalytically relevant substrates.







Abstract
Supramolecular coordination&#8208;based self&#8208;assembled nanostructures have been widely studied, and currently various applications are being explored. For several applications, the stability of the nanostructure is of key importance, and this strongly depends on the metal used in the self&#8208;assembly process. Herein, design strategies and synthetic protocols to access desirable kinetically stable Pt12L24 nanospheres are reported, and it is demonstrated that these are stable under conditions under which the palladium counterparts decompose. Descriptors previously used for palladium nanospheres are insufficient for platinum analogues, as the stronger metal&#8211;ligand bond results in a mixture of kinetically trapped structures. We report that next to the dihedral angle, the rigidity of the ditopic ligand is also a key parameter for the controlled formation of Pt12L24 nanospheres. Catalytic amounts of coordinating additives to labilise the platinum&#8208;pyridyl bond to some extent are needed to selectively form Pt12L24 assemblies. The formed Pt12L24 nanospheres were demonstrated to be stable in the presence of chloride, amines and acids, unlike the palladium analogues.

         <title>Coordinate reaction model:&#160;an obstacle for interpreting the emergence of chemical complexity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In order to be correctly simulated and understood, the chemical behavior of complex systems, requires time&#8208;dependent models ,&#160; otherwise the irreversibility of natural phenomena is overlooked. Micro reversible models based on the reaction coordinate model are time invariant and are therefore unable to explain the evolution of open dissipative systems. The important points necessary for improving the modelling and simulations of chemical complex systems are: a) The understanding of the physical potential related to the entropy production rate, which is in general a non&#8208;exact differential of a state function, and b) The interpretation and application of the so&#8208;called general evolution criteria (GEC) which is the general thermodynamic constraint for the evolution of dissipative chemical systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Ytterbium(II) Hydride as a Powerful Multielectron Reductant</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A dimeric &#946;&#8208;diketiminato ytterbium(II) hydride affects both the two&#8208;electron aromatization of 1,3,5,7&#8208;cyclooctatetraene (COT) and the more challenging two&#8208;electron reduction of polyaromatic hydrocarbons, including naphthalene (E  0  = &#8211;2.60 V). Confirmed by Density Functional Theory calculations, these reactions proceed via consecutive polarized Yb&#8208;H/C=C insertion and deprotonation steps to provide the respective ytterbium(II) inverse sandwich complexes and hydrogen gas. These observations highlight the ability of a simple ytterbium(II) hydride to act as a powerful two&#8208;electron reductant at room temperature without the necessity of an external electron to initiate the reaction and avoiding radicaloid intermediates.</dc:description>

         <title>Trapping of Terminal Platinapolyynes by Copper(I) Catalyzed Click Cycloadditions; Probes of Labile Intermediates in Syntheses of Complexes with Extended sp Carbon Chains, and Crystallographic Studies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The title reactions are, by analogy to a coal miner&#8216;s canary, employed to detect unstable transient species LyPt(C&#8801;C)nH with n up to 9. These are valuable building blocks for still longer polyynes, and all of the precursors LyPt(C&#8801;C)nSiR3 and trapping products can be crystallographically characterized.







Abstract
The silylated hexatriynyl complex trans&#8208;(C6F5)(p&#8208;tol3P)2Pt(C&#8801;C)3SiEt3 (PtC6TES) is converted in&#8197;situ to PtC6H (wet n&#8208;Bu4N+ F&#8722;, THF) and cross coupled with the diyne H(C&#8801;C)2SiEt3 (HC4TES; CuCl/TMEDA, O2) to give PtC10TES (71&#8201;%). This sequence is repeated twice to afford PtC14TES (65&#8201;%) and then PtC18TES (27&#8201;%). An analogous series of reactions starting with PtC8TES gives PtC12TES (60&#8201;%), then PtC16TES (43&#8201;%), and then PtC20TES (17&#8201;%). Similar cross couplings with H(C&#8801;C)2Si(i&#8208;Pr)3 (HC4TIPS) give PtC12TIPS (68&#8201;%), PtC14TIPS (68&#8201;%), and PtC16TIPS (34&#8201;%). The trialkylsilyl species (up to PtC18TES) are converted to 3+2 &#8220;click&#8221; cycloadducts or 1,4&#8208;disubstituted 1,2,3&#8208;triazoles trans&#8208;(C6F5)(p&#8208;tol3P)2Pt(C&#8801;C)n&#8208;1C=CHN(CH2C6H5)N=N (29&#8211;92&#8201;% after workups). The most general procedure involves generating the terminal polyynes PtCxH (wet n&#8208;Bu4N+ F&#8722;, THF) in the presence of benzyl azide in DMF and aqueous CuSO4/ascorbic acid. All of the preceding complexes are crystallographically characterized and the structural and spectroscopic properties analyzed as a function of chain length. Two pseudopolymorphs of PtC20TES are obtained, both of which feature molecules with parallel sp carbon chains in a pairwise head/tail packing motif with extensive sp/sp van der Waals contacts.

         <title>Decoding Directing Groups and Their Pivotal Role in C&#8722;H Activation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The role of directing groups in guiding C&#8722;H activation reactions are described with a detailed picture of the various directing groups that have become prominent in carrying out functionalizations at different sites of aromatic scaffolds. The review encompasses all the relevant works that have been conducted by different groups from all over the world and this provides sufficient information for readers who wish to carry out research in this domain.







Abstract
Synthetic organic chemistry has witnessed a plethora of functionalization and defunctionalization strategies. In this regard, C&#8722;H functionalization has been at the forefront due to the multifarious applications in the development of simple to complex molecular architectures and holds a brilliant prospect in drug development and discovery. Despite been explored tremendously by chemists, this functionalization strategy still enjoys the employment of novel metal catalysts as well metal&#8208;free organic ligands. Moreover, the switch to photo&#8208; and electrochemistry has widened our understanding of the alternative pathways via which a reaction can proceed and these strategies have garnered prominence when applied to C&#8722;H activation. Synthetic chemists have been foraging for new directing groups and templates for the selective activation of C&#8722;H bonds from a myriad of carbon&#8208;hydrogen bonds in aromatic as well as aliphatic systems. As a matter of fact, by varying the templates and directing groups, scientists found the answer to the challenge of distal C&#8722;H bond activation which remained an obstacle for a very long time. These templates have been frequently harnessed for selectively activating C&#8722;H bonds of natural products, drugs, and macromolecules decorated with multiple C&#8722;H bonds. This itself was a challenge before the commencement of this field as functionalization of a site other than the targeted site could modify and hamper the biological activity of the pharmacophore. Total synthesis and pharmacophore development often faces the difficulty of superfluous reaction steps towards selective functionalization. This obstacle has been solved by late&#8208;stage functionalization simply by harnessing C&#8722;H bond activation. Moreover, green chemistry and metal&#8208;free reaction conditions have seen light in the past few decades due to the rising concern about environmental issues. Therefore, metal&#8208;free catalysts or the usage of non&#8208;toxic metals have been recently showcased in a number of elegant works. Also, research groups across the world are developing rational strategies for directing group free or non&#8208;directed protocols that are just guided by ligands. This review encapsulates the research works pertinent to C&#8722;H bond activation and discusses the science devoted to it at the fundamental level. This review gives the readers a broad understanding of how these strategies work, the execution of various metal catalysts, and directing groups. This not only helps a budding scientist towards the commencement of his/her research but also helps a matured mind searching out for selective functionalization. A detailed picture of this field and its progress with time has been portrayed in lucid scientific language with a motive to inculcate and educate scientific minds about this beautiful strategy with an overview of the most relevant and significant works of this era. The unique trait of this review is the detailed description and classification of various directing groups and their utility over a wide substrate scope. This allows an experimental chemist to understand the applicability of this domain and employ it over any targeted substrate.

In this review, a profound revision on the latest advances on the organocatalytic asymmetric inverse&#8208;electron demand hetero&#8208;Diels&#8208;Alder reaction is shown.







Abstract
Cycloaddition reactions, in particular Diels&#8208;Alder reactions, have attracted a lot of attention from organic chemists since they represent one of the most powerful methodologies for the construction of carbon&#8208;carbon bonds. In particular, inverse&#8208;electron&#8208;demand hetero&#8208;Diels&#8208;Alder reactions have been an important breakthrough for the synthesis of heterocyclic compounds. Among all their variants, the organocatalytic enantioselective version has been widely explored since the asymmetric construction of diversely functionalized scaffolds under reaction conditions encompassed within the green chemistry field is of great interest. In this review, a profound revision on the latest advances on the organocatalytic asymmetric inverse&#8208;electron demand hetero&#8208;Diels&#8208;Alder reaction is shown.

         <title>Inclusion Complexes of Gold(I)&#8208;Dithiocarbamates with &#946;&#8208;Cyclodextrin: A Journey from Drug Repurposing towards Drug Discovery</title>

         <dc:description>
Inclusion complex of a complex: The two drugs disulfiram and aurothiomalate react to produce a gold(I)&#8208;dithiocarbamate complex, which selectively kills cancer cells. Hydroxy&#8208;substituted derivatives of this complex form inclusion complexes with &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin in a rare &#8220;tail&#8208;to&#8208;tail&#8221; arrangement. Formulation of one gold complex with a &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin derivative prevents formation of reactive oxygen species in mitochondria.







Abstract
The gold(I)&#8208;dithiocarbamate (dtc) complex [Au(N,N&#8208;diethyl)dtc]2 was identified as the active cytotoxic agent in the combination treatment of sodium aurothiomalate and disulfiram on a panel of cancer cell lines. In addition to demonstrating pronounced differential cytotoxicity to these cell lines, the gold complex showed no cross&#8208;resistance in therapy&#8208;surviving cancer cells. In the course of a medicinal chemistry campaign on this class of poorly soluble gold(I)&#8208;dtc complexes, &gt;35 derivatives were synthesized and X&#8208;ray crystallography was used to examine structural aspects of the dtc moiety. A group of hydroxy&#8208;substituted complexes has an improved solubility profile, and it was found that these complexes form 2&#8201;:&#8201;1 host&#8211;guest inclusion complexes with &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin (CD), exhibiting a rarely observed &#8220;tail&#8208;to&#8208;tail&#8221; arrangement of the CD cones. Formulation of a hydroxy&#8208;substituted gold(I)&#8208;dtc complex with excess sulfobutylether&#8208;&#946;&#8208;CD prevents the induction of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species, which is a major burden in the development of metallodrugs.

         <title>Taming the Antiferromagnetic Beast: Computational Design of Ultrashort Mn&#8722;Mn Bonds Stabilized by N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Mn2 survival guide. DFT calculations were used to design synthetically achievable compounds featuring ultrashort Mn&#8722;Mn bonds stabilized by N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs). We investigated the nature of the metal&#8211;carbene interaction and the role of the ancillary &#951;6 coordination in the generation of ultrashort Mn2 bonds in organometallic platforms featuring closed&#8208;shell singlet multiplicities and positive adiabatic singlet&#8211;triplet gaps. Our analysis identified two classes of potential synthetic targets, whose electrostructural properties were thoroughly examined.







Abstract
The development of complexes featuring low&#8208;valent, multiply bonded metal centers is an exciting field with several potential applications. In this work, we describe the design principles and extensive computational investigation of new organometallic platforms featuring the elusive manganese&#8208;manganese bond stabilized by experimentally realized N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs). By using DFT computations benchmarked against multireference calculations, as well as MO&#8208; and VB&#8208;based bonding analyses, we could disentangle the various electronic and structural effects contributing to the thermodynamic and kinetic stability, as well as the experimental feasibility, of the systems. In particular, we explored the nature of the metal&#8208;carbene interaction and the role of the ancillary &#951;6 coordination to the generation of Mn2 systems featuring ultrashort metal&#8208;metal bonds, closed&#8208;shell singlet multiplicities, and positive adiabatic singlet&#8208;triplet gaps. Our analysis identifies two distinct classes of viable synthetic targets, whose electrostructural properties are thoroughly investigated.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The development of complexes featuring low-valent, multiply bonded metal centers is an exciting field with several potential applications. In this work, we describe the design principles and extensive computational investigation of new organometallic platforms featuring the elusive manganese-manganese bond stabilized by experimentally realized N-heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs). By using DFT computations benchmarked against multireference calculations, as well as MO- and VB-based bonding analyses, we could disentangle the various electronic and structural effects contributing to the thermodynamic and kinetic stability, as well as the experimental feasibility, of the systems. In particular, we explored the nature of the metal-carbene interaction and the role of the ancillary &lt;i&gt;&#951;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; coordination to the generation of Mn&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; systems featuring ultrashort metal-metal bonds, closed-shell singlet multiplicities, and positive adiabatic singlet-triplet gaps. Our analysis identifies two distinct classes of viable synthetic targets, whose electrostructural properties are thoroughly investigated.&lt;/p&gt;

Giving directions: A rhodium(III)&#8208;catalyzed C6&#8208;selective dehydrogenative cross&#8208;coupling of 2&#8208;pyridones with thiophenes was developed for the synthesis of 6&#8208;thiophenyl pyridin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;one derivatives. In this reaction, the excellent site selectivity was directed by the 2&#8208;pyridyl on the nitrogen of the pyridone ring.

Abstract
A rhodium(III)&#8208;catalyzed C6&#8208;selective dehydrogenative cross&#8208;coupling of 2&#8208;pyridones with thiophenes was developed for the synthesis of 6&#8208;thiophenyl pyridin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;one derivatives. In this reaction, the excellent site selectivity was controlled by the 2&#8208;pyridyl directing group on the nitrogen of the pyridone ring. Control experiments indicated that the N&#8208;pyridyl was essential for the transformation. To the best of our knowledge, this procedure is the first successful example of the direct C6 heteroarylation of 2&#8208;pyridones with electron&#8208;rich thiophene derivatives. 4&#8208;Pyridone was also used as substrate to generate the corresponding C2 heteroarylated product. Moreover, this pyridyl directing group was readily removable to generate the biheteroaryl structures with a free N&#8722;H group.

         <title>Selective Oxygen and Hydrogen Functionalization of the h&#8208;BN/Rh(111) Nanomesh</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We present detailed studies on the covalent adsorption of molecular oxygen and atomic hydrogen on the hexagonal boron nitride (  h  &#8209;BN) nanomesh on Rh(111). The functionalization of this two&#8208;dimensional (2D) material was investigated under ultra&#8208;high vacuum conditions using synchrotron radiation&#8208;based  in situ  high&#8208;resolution X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy, temperature&#8208;programmed X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy and ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy. We are able to provide a deep insight into the adsorption behavior and thermal stability of oxygen and hydrogen on  h  &#8209;BN/Rh(111). Oxygen functionalization was achieved via a supersonic molecular beam while hydrogen functionalization was realized using an atomic hydrogen source. Adsorption of the respective species was observed to occur selectively in the pores of  h  &#8208;BN leading to spatially defined modification of the 2D&#160;layer. The adsorption of the observed molecular oxygen species was found to be an activated process that requires high&#8208;energy oxygen molecules. Upon heating to 700&#160;K, oxygen functionalization was observed to be almost reversible except for small amounts of boron oxides evolving due to the reaction of oxygen with the 2D&#160;material. Hydrogen functionalization of  h  &#8209;BN/Rh(111) was fully reversed upon heating to about 640&#160;K.</dc:description>

         <title>Driving the Emission Towards Blue by Controlling the HOMO&#8208;LUMO Energy Gap in BF2&#8208;Functionalized 2&#8208;(Imidazo[1,5&#8208;a]pyridin&#8208;3&#8208;yl)phenols</title>

Blue emissive materials: boron containing fluorescent compounds have been prepared starting from imidazo[1,5&#8208;a]pyridine phenols. Large Stokes shift, high absolute quantum yields and good photostability are observed in solution. TD&#8208;DFT calculations allowed to find a linear correlation between the HOMO&#8208;LUMO energy gap of these compounds and the Hammett constants of substituents R para to the hydroxyl group of the phenols.







Abstract
Several boron compounds with 2&#8208;(imidazo[1,5&#8208;a]pyridin&#8208;3&#8208;yl)phenols, differentiated by the nature of the substituent (R) in the para position of the hydroxy group, have been synthesized and thoroughly characterized both in solution (1H, 13C, 11B, 19F NMR) and in the solid state (X&#8208;ray). All derivatives displayed attractive photophysical properties like very high Stokes shift, high fluorescence quantum yields and a good photostability in solution. Time&#8208;Dependent Density Functional Theory (TD&#8208;DFT) calculations allowed to define the main electronic transitions as intra ligand transitions (1ILT), which was corroborated by the Natural Transition Orbitals (NTOs) shapes. The HOMO&#8208;LUMO energy gap was correlated to the electronic properties of the substituent R on the phenolic ring, as quantified by its &#963;p Hammett constant.
