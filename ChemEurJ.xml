         <title>Green synthesis and analytical characterization of core&#8208;shell copper sub&#8208;microparticles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This study demonstrates a simple and reproducible approach to synthesize green core&#8208;shell copper sub&#8208;microparticles stabilized by poly(n&#8208;vinyl)pyrrolidone (PVP). Cu@PVP colloids were here prepared using copper sulfate pentahydrate as precursor and glucose as reducing agent. The presence of PVP in the synthetic medium eliminates the need for an inert atmosphere during the process, thus simplifying the whole method. Both the morphology and the spectroscopic properties of Cu@PVP were investigated by transmission electron microscopy, and infrared, UV&#8208;Vis and X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopies. Size distributions and average shell thickness were obtained by statistical analysis on TEM micrographs, and spectroscopies demonstrated the formation of a PVP layer around the copper core. The produced colloids were employed in composite thin films for potential antimicrobial application, in association with a highly&#8208;recyclable polymer: polycarbonate (4,4'&#8208;(1&#8208;methylethylidene)bis(phenol)).</dc:description>

         <title>Dendrite&#8208;Free Engineering toward Efficient Zinc Storage: Recent Progress and Future Perspectives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Zinc&#8208;based energy storage has lately gained popularity due to natural abundance, operational safety, high energy density. Unfortunately, dendrite growth is a common and intractable issue faced in existing zinc&#8208;ion batteries to shorten cycle lifespan/stability. This review summarizes recent progress in assembly component (e. g., anode, electrolyte, separator) engineering for dendrite&#8208;free zinc&#8208;ion batteries. First, diversiform strategies of Zn surface modification and Zn host design are presented to shield the fundamental adverse effect aroused by uneven zinc deposition on the anode. Then, subtle deployments of electrolyte constituents are illustrated to optimize the Zn2+ solvation structure for ultimate dendrite control and Coulombic efficiency elevation in aqueous systems and beyond (e.g., eutectic electrolytes). Furthermore, rational manipulation of advanced separators and the upgrade of zinc metal&#8208;free Zn2+&#8208;storage devices are briefly discussed to explore the dendrite&#8208;free and high&#8208;level Zn2+&#8208;storage. Finally, challenges and perspectives are proposed to offer research inspirations toward safe, high&#8208;efficiency and long&#8208;lifespan zinc storage.</dc:description>

         <title>Process Engineering and Glycosyltransferase Improvement for Short Route Chemoenzymatic Total Synthesis of GM1 Gangliosides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Large&#8208;scale synthesis of GM1, an important ganglioside in mammalian cells especially those in the nervous system, is needed to explore its therapeutic potential. Biocatalytic production is a promising platform for such a purpose. We report herein the development of process engineering and glycosyltransferase improvement strategies to advance chemoenzymatic total synthesis of GM1. Firstly, a new short route was developed for chemical synthesis of lactosylsphingosine from the commercially available Garner&#8217;s aldehyde. Secondly, two glycosyltransferases including Campylobacter jejuni &#946;1&#8211;4GalNAcT (CjCgtA) and &#946;1&#8211;3&#8208;galactosyltransferase (CjCgtB) were improved on their soluble expression in E. coli and enzyme stability by fusing with an N&#8208;terminal maltose binding protein (MBP). Thirdly, the process for enzymatic synthesis of GM1 sphingosines from lactosylsphingosine was engineered by developing a multistep one&#8208;pot multienzyme (MSOPME) strategy without isolating intermediate glycosphingosines and by adding a detergent, sodium cholate, to the later enzymatic glycosylation steps. Installation of a desired fatty acyl chain to GM1 glycosphingosines led to the formation of target GM1 gangliosides. The combination of glycosyltransferase improvement with chemical and enzymatic process engineering represents a significant advance in obtaining GM1 gangliosides containing different sialic acid forms by total chemoenzymatic synthesis in a short route and with high efficiency.</dc:description>

         <title>Live monitoring of anionic living polymerizations by electrospray&#8208;ionization mass spectrometry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Anionic polymerizations are of exceptional practical importance, but difficult to analyze due to the high reactivity of the growing polymer chains. Here, we demonstrate that electrospray&#8208;ionization mass spectrometry (ESI&#8208;MS) permits the direct observation of the active carbanionic intermediates formed in the anionic ring&#8208;opening polymerization of 1&#8209;cyanocyclopropane&#8208;carboxylate in tetrahydrofuran. This includes the identification of a side product, as well as the real&#8208;time analysis of the polymerization reaction. From the obtained mass spectra, we can derive not only the mean molar mass and the polydispersity, but also the rate constants for the initiation and the individual propagation steps. The initation proceeds significantly faster than the propagation steps. Accordingly, the examined reaction corresponds to a living polymerization, as we also confirmed by additional control experiments. Besides giving detailed insight into the reaction system probed here, we expect the presented methodology to make possible the in&#8208;situ analysis of further anionic polymerizations as well.</dc:description>

         <title>Pillar[5]arene Derivatives Embedded with AIE Luminogens and Their Fluorescence Regulation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Through McMurry coupling reaction, three meso&#8208;position functionalized pillar[5]arene derivatives (H&#8208;1, H&#8208;2, and H&#8208;3) have been successfully prepared by embedding aggregation&#8208;induced emission luminogens (AIEgens, diphenyldibenzofulvene (DPDBF) and tetraphenylethylene (TPE)) into the skeleton of supramolecular macrocycles. H&#8208;1, bearing [15]paracyclophane ([15]PCP) and DPDBF moiety, exhibits yellow emission and demonstrates obvious AIE effect. In order to further improve the host&#8208;guest properties of this type of structure, H&#8208;2 and H&#8208;3 are prepared by replacing the [15]PCP moiety with pillar[5]arene backbone, both of which show significant AIE effect and excellent host&#8208;guest complexation properties with pyrazine salt guest G&#8208;1 and 1,4&#8208;dicyanobutane G&#8208;2. Our findings indicate that G&#8208;1 can decrease the fluorescence intensity of the AIE macrocycles, while G&#8208;2 can increase their fluorescence intensity in solution.</dc:description>

         <title>Plenates: Anion&#8208;Dependent Self&#8208;Assembly of the Pyrrole Cage Encapsulating Silver(I) Clusters</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The self&#8208;assembly of 2,5&#8208;diformylpyrrole, tris(2&#8208;aminoethyl)amine, and silver(I) yielded, depending on the size and basicity of the anion, new cascade complexes or plenates, i.e., cryptates incorporating Agnn+ clusters. The nature of the product was counterion&#8208;dependent, and its formation was either driven by the cascade anion binding or by the argentophilic interactions stabilizing the cluster within the cavity. The reaction of plenates with tetrabutylammonium halides resulted in the protonation&#8208;coupled replacement of the Ag33+ with anion(s), yielding cascade cryptates.</dc:description>

         <title>Destruction of a Cu metal&#8211;organic framework&#160;to induce CuPt growth as a heterojunction&#160;catalyst for hydrogen peroxide sensing</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>ABSTRACT: Assembling bimetallic alloys (BAs) with metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) to form heterojunctions has emerged as a promising strategy for the construction of highly active electrocatalysts. However, the current approaches to prepare BA@MOF heterojunctions suffer from poor controllability. In this work, we report a fascinating method involving partial thermal reduction and galvanic replacement to induce CuPt growth on a CuHHTP MOF (HHTP= 2,3,6,7,10,11&#8208;hexahydroxytriphenylene) to construct a CuPt@CuHHTP heterojunction. The size of the CuPt nanoparticles can be effectively regulated by modifying the reduction temperature. The resultant CuPt NP@CuHHTP heterojunction nanoarrays exhibit high electrocatalytic activity and potential as an electrochemical H2O2 sensor with a low detection limit (5 nM), high sensitivity (6.942 mA&#183;mM&#8208;1&#183;cm&#8208;2), and outstanding selectivity. This in situ approach provides not only new insights into the preparation of BA@MOF&#8208;based heterojunctions but also an effective approach for the optimization of the catalytic performance of MOFs and related materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Site&#8208;Specific Labeling of RNAs with Modified and 19F&#8208;Labelled Nucleotides by Chemo&#8208;Enzymatic Synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>More than 170 post&#8208;transcriptional modifications of RNAs have currently been identified. Detailed biophysical investigations of these modifications have been limited since large RNAs containing these post&#8208;transcriptional modifications are difficult to produce. Further, adequate readout of spectroscopic fingerprints are important, necessitating additional labeling procedures beyond the naturally occurring RNA modifications. Here, we report the chemo&#8208;enzymatic synthesis of RNA modifications and several structurally similar fluorine&#8208;modified analogs further optimizing a recently developed methodology.[1] This chemo&#8208;enzymatic method allows synthesis of also large RNAs. We were able to incorporate 16 modified nucleotides and 6 19F&#8208;labeled nucleotides. To showcase the applicability of such modified large RNAs, we incorporated a 19F&#8208;labelled cytidine into the aptamer domain of the 2&#8217;dG sensing riboswitch (2&#8217;dG&#8208;sw) from Mesoplasma florum, enabling characterizing RNA fold, ligand binding and kinetics. Thanks to the large chemical shift dispersion of 19F, we can detect previously postulated but difficult to detect conformational heterogeneity in the apo state of the riboswitch.</dc:description>

         <title>Promoted Photothermal Catalytic CO Hydrogenation by Using TiC&#8208;Supported Co&#8722;Fe5C2 Catalysts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Co&#8208;Fe5C2/TiC catalysts absorb light from the visible to near&#8208;infrared regions for efficient photo&#8208;to&#8208;thermal conversion. Plasmonic hot&#8208;electron injection from TiC to Fe5C2 further modulates the chemical states of Fe on the Fe5C2 surfaces, enabling a 7.2&#8208;fold increase in C2+ yield in photothermal CO hydrogenation.







Abstract
Photothermal catalytic CO hydrogenation offers the potential to synthesize light hydrocarbons by using solar energy. However, the selectivity and activity of the reaction are still far below those achieved in conventional thermal catalytic processes. Herein, we report that the Co&#8208;modified Fe5C2 on TiC catalyst promotes photothermal catalytic CO hydrogenation with a 59&#8201;% C2+ selectivity in the produced hydrocarbons and a 30&#8201;% single&#8208;pass CO conversion at a high gas hourly space&#8211;time velocity of 12&#8201;000&#8197;mL&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1. Using in&#8208;situ&#8208;irradiated XPS, we show that light&#8208;induced hot electron injection from TiC to Fe5C2 modulates the chemical state of Fe, thereby increasing the CO&#8208;to&#8208;C2+ conversion. This work suggests that it is possible for plasmon&#8208;mediated surface chemistry to enhance the activity and selectivity of photothermal catalytic reactions.

         <title>Stirring&#8208;Free Scalable Electrosynthesis Enabled by Alternating Current</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Alternating current (AC) electrolysis is receiving increased interest as a versatile tool for mild and selective electrochemical transformations. In this work, we demonstrate that AC can enable the concept of a stirring&#8208;free electrochemical reactor where the periodic switch of electrode polarity, inherent to AC, provides uniform electrolysis across the whole volume of the reactor. Such design implies a straightforward approach for scaling up electrosynthesis. This was demonstrated on the range of electrochemical transformations performed in three different RVC&#8208;packed reactors on up to a 50&#8208;mmol scale. Redox&#8208;neutral, oxidative, and reductive processes were successfully implemented using the suggested design and the applicable frequency ranges were further investigated for different types of reactions. The advantages of the AC&#8208;enabled design &#8211; such as the absence of stirring and a maximized surface area of the electrodes &#8211; provide the possibility for its universal application both for small&#8208;scale screening experimentation and large&#8208;scale preparative electrosynthesis without significant optimization needed in between.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The reduction of the boryl&#8208;substituted SnII bromide {(HCDippN)2B}Sn(IPrMe)Br with 1.5 equivalents of potassium graphite leads to the generation of the cyclic tetra&#8208;tin tetra&#8208;boryl system K2[Sn4{B(NDippCH)2}4], a homo&#8208;metallic heavier analogue of the cyclobutadiene dianion.

Experimental and computational studies suggest that nitroarenes may be substituted via an electron-catalysed radical-nucleophilic substitution (SRN1) chain mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>An Improved Spectrophotometric Method for Toluene&#8208;4&#8208;Monooxygenase Activity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Monooxygenases, an important class of enzymes, have been the subject of enzyme engineering due to their high activity and versatile substrate scope. Reactions performed by these biocatalysts have long been monitored by a colorimetric method involving the coupling of a dye precursor to naphthalene hydroxylation products generated by the enzyme. Despite the popularity of this method, we found the dye product to be unstable, preventing quantitative readout. By incorporating an extraction step to solubilize the dye produced, we have improved this assay to the point where quantitation of enzyme activity is possible. Further, by incorporating spectral deconvolution, we have, for the first time, enabled independent quantification of the two possible regioisomeric products: 1&#8208;naphthol and 2&#8208;naphthol. Previously, such analysis was only possible with chromatographic separation, increasing the cost and complexity of analysis. The efficacy of our improved workflow was evaluated by monitoring the activity of a toluene&#8208;4&#8208;monooxygenase enzyme from Pseudomonas mendocina KR&#8208;1. Our colorimetric regioisomer quantification was found to be consistent with chromatographic analysis by HPLC. The development and validation of a quantitative colorimetric assay for monooxygenase activity that enables regioisomeric distinction and quantification represents a significant advance in analytical methods to monitor enzyme activity. By maintaining facile, low&#8208;cost, high&#8208;throughput readout while incorporating quantification, this assay represents an important alternative to more expensive chromatographic quantification techniques.</dc:description>

         <title>A molecular insight into the dehydration of metal&#8208;organic framework and its impact on the CO2 capture</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) are porous material formed by the self&#8208;assembly of metallic ligands and organic linkers. They are a good candidate for CO2 gas capture because they have large surface areas and the metal or linker can be tuned to improve CO2 uptake. In the quest for water and acid stable MOFs, a phosphonate&#8208;based organic linker has recently been designed by Glavinovic et al. (Chem. Eur. J. 2022, e202200874). By combining ionic calcium nodes, water and methanol molecules, they formed a microporous network, CALF&#8208;37. This network has been shown to be robust and can maintain its pore shape even in absence of water molecules or by the inclusion of gas molecules, such as CO2. The network can be heated to release the water and methanol molecules and form a dehydrated MOF, which retains its shape with the imprinted pore within. Herein, we perform molecular dynamics (MD) simulations in order to provide insight into the CO2 capture and sequestration ability of the CALF&#8208;37. We model the dehydration of the inactivated MOF (HCALF&#8208;37) in the absence and in the presence of methanol molecules by progressively withdrawing water molecules from the MOF networks. We determine the crystal structure of the intermediate states from HCALF&#8208;37 to CALF&#8208;37 and shed light on the critical role of water molecules in the mediation of metal&#8208;linker bonds. Our calculations also reveal that the favorable interactions between the CO2 molecules and the aromatic core of the linkers and metallic ions are responsible for the efficient sequestration of the gas in the CALF&#8208;37.</dc:description>

         <title>Small Molecule Tools to Study Cellular Target Engagement for the Intracellular Allosteric Binding Site of GPCRs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 1, January 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A druggable intracellular allosteric binding site (IABS) has recently been identified at several GPCRs. Ligands targeting the IABS are promising drugs and currently evaluated in several clinical trials. Herein, we review small molecule tools that enable an unambiguous identification and characterization of cellular target engagement for intracellular allosteric GPCR ligands.







Abstract
A conserved intracellular allosteric binding site (IABS) has recently been identified at several G protein&#8208;coupled receptors (GPCRs). Ligands targeting the IABS, so&#8208;called intracellular allosteric antagonists, are highly promising compounds for pharmaceutical intervention and currently evaluated in several clinical trials. Beside co&#8208;crystal structures that laid the foundation for the structure&#8208;based development of intracellular allosteric GPCR antagonists, small molecule tools that enable an unambiguous identification and characterization of intracellular allosteric GPCR ligands are of utmost importance for drug discovery campaigns in this field. Herein, we discuss recent approaches that leverage cellular target engagement studies for the IABS and thus play a critical role in the evaluation of IABS&#8208;targeted ligands as potential therapeutic agents.

Calcium hydride cation dimer catalysis: Dispersion&#8208;corrected DFT calculations reveal that the same double Ca&#8722;H&#8722;Ca bridged calcium hydride cation dimer catalyst [LCaH2CaL]2+&#8901;THF shows a novel substrate&#8208;dependent catalytic activity, involving cooperative Ca&#8722;H&#8722;Ca bridges for efficient H2 isotope exchange, terminal Ca&#8722;H bond for the Markovnikov addition of conjugation&#8208;activated styrene, and competitive Ca&#8722;H&#8722;Ca bridges and terminal Ca&#8722;H bonds for the anti&#8208;Markovnikov addition of unactivated 1&#8208;alkenes.







Abstract
Recently, it was shown that the double Ca&#8722;H&#8722;Ca bridged calcium hydride cation dimer complex [LCaH2CaL]2+ (macrocyclic ligand L=NNNN&#8208;tetradentate Me4TACD) exhibited remarkable activity in catalyzing the hydrogenation of unactivated 1&#8208;alkenes as well as the H2 isotope exchange under mild conditions, tentatively via the terminal Ca&#8722;H bond of cation monomer LCaH+. In this DFT mechanistic work, a novel substrate&#8208;dependent catalytic mechanism is disclosed involving cooperative Ca&#8722;H&#8722;Ca bridges for H2 isotope exchange, competitive Ca&#8722;H&#8722;Ca bridges and terminal Ca&#8722;H bonds for anti&#8208;Markovnikov addition of unactivated 1&#8208;alkenes, and terminal Ca&#8722;H bonds for Markovnikov addition of conjugation&#8208;activated styrene. THF&#8208;coordination plays a key role in favoring the anti&#8208;Markovnikov addition while strong cation&#8208;&#960; interactions direct the Markovnikov addition to terminal Ca&#8722;H bonds.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 1, January 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal nodes of various robust metal&#8208;organic frameworks activate H2. The catalytic activity is a function of the composition of the metal node and the organic linker. It is proposed that the reaction mechanism is based on the operation of frustrated Lewis acid/base pairs.







Abstract
Hydrogenation of multiple bonds are among the most general and important organic reactions. Typical heterogeneous catalysts are based on transition metal nanoparticles, including noble metals. Data are presented here showing that metal nodes of MIL&#8208;101(Cr) and UiO&#8208;66 in the absence of occluded metal nanoparticles can promote hydrogenation of polarized X=Y double bonds of nitro and carbonyl groups. The catalytic activity is a function of the composition of the metal node and the organic linker. It is proposed that the reaction mechanism is based on the operation of frustrated Lewis acid/base pairs.

Vinylene&#8208;linked thiopyrylium&#8208;based covalent organic frameworks (COFs) were synthesized from 2,4,6&#8208;trimethylpyrylium tetrafluoroborate and other common reagents by means of acid&#8208;catalyzed Aldol condensation. Besides, pyrylium&#8208;, and pyridinium&#8208;based COFs also can be prepared from the same monomer under slightly different reaction conditions.







Abstract
The development of new vinylene&#8208;linked covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with special ionic structure and high stability is challenging. Herein, we report a facile, general method for constructing ionic vinylene&#8208;linked thiopyrylium&#8208;based COFs from 2,4,6&#8208;trimethylpyrylium tetrafluoroborate and other common reagents by means of acid&#8208;catalyzed Aldol condensation. Besides, pyrylium&#8208;, and pyridinium&#8208;based COFs also can be prepared from the same monomer under slightly different reaction conditions. The COFs exhibited uniform nanofibrous morphologies with excellent crystallinities, special ionic structures, well&#8208;defined nanochannels, and high specific surface areas.

         <title>Organocatalyzed Phospha&#8208;Michael Addition: A Highly Efficient Synthesis of Customized Bis(acyl)phosphane Oxide Photoinitiators</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 1, January 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The phospha&#8208;Michael addition of bis(mesitoyl)phosphine to a variety of activated C&#8722;C bonds was investigated. Simple amine bases were employed as catalysts, with tetramethylguanidine showing an outstanding performance and allowing the preparation of bis(acyl)phosphines under very mild conditions in excellent yields and short time. Oxidation of the bis(acyl)phosphines led to bis(acyl)phosphane oxides, a substance class belonging to the most potent photoinitiators.







Abstract
Addition of the P&#8722;H bond in bis(mesitoyl)phosphine, HP(COMes)2 (BAPH), to a wide variety of activated carbon&#8211;carbon double bonds as acceptors was investigated. While this phospha&#8208;Michael addition does not proceed in the absence of an additive or catalyst, excellent results were obtained with stoichiometric basic potassium or caesium salts. Simple amine bases can be employed in catalytic amounts, and tetramethylguanidine (TMG) in particular is an outstanding catalyst that allows the preparation of bis(acyl)phosphines, R&#8722;P(COMes)2, under very mild conditions in excellent yields after only a short time. All phosphines RP(COMes)2 can subsequently be oxidized to the corresponding bis(acyl)phosphane oxides, RPO(COMes)2, a substance class belonging to the most potent photoinitiators for radical polymerizations known to date. Thus, a simple and highly atom economic method has been found that allows the preparation of a broad range of photoinitiators adapted to their specific field of application even on a large scale.

         <title>Protonated Porphyrins: Bifunctional Catalysts for the Metal&#8208;Free Synthesis of N&#8208;Alkyl&#8208;Oxazolidinones</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 1, January 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
CO2 cycloaddition to N&#8208;alkyl aziridines was efficiently promoted by economic and easy&#8208;to&#8208;synthesize protonated forms of porphyrin ligands. The metal&#8208;free procedure does not require the addition of any Lewis base or additive and allows N&#8208;alkyl oxazolidinones to be obtained in high yields and regioselectivities. A catalytic mechanism for the procedure is proposed on the basis of a DFT study.







Abstract
The protonation of commercially available porphyrin ligands yields a class of bifunctional catalysts able to promote the synthesis of N&#8208;alkyl oxazolidinones by CO2 cycloaddition to corresponding aziridines. The catalytic system does not require the presence of any Lewis base or additive, and shows interesting features both in terms of cost effectiveness and eco&#8208;compatibility. The metal&#8208;free methodology is active even with a low catalytic loading of 1&#8201;% mol, and the chemical stability of the protonated porphyrin allowed it to be recycled three times without any decrease in performance. In addition, a DFT study was performed in order to suggest how a simple protonated porphyrin can mediate CO2 cycloaddition to aziridines to yield oxazolidinones.

         <title>Efficient Photoredox Cycles to Control Perylenediimide Self&#8208;Assembly
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 1, January 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photoreduction can be used to disassemble perylenediimide&#8208;based supramolecular structures by creating repulsive dianions. Typically, photoreductions are done in oxygen&#8208;free conditions. Here we show that &#8216;indirect photoreduction&#8217; by acetone ketyl radicals is very efficient and can be done in open air. Repeated photoreduction/disassembly followed by oxidation/assembly cycles can in this way be performed by simple UV&#8722;C LED light.







Abstract
Photoreduction of perylenediimide (PDI) derivatives has been widely studied for use in photocatalysis, hydrogen evolution, photo&#8208;responsive gels, and organic semiconductors. Upon light irradiation, the radical anion (PDI&#8901;&#8722;) can readily be obtained, whereas further reduction to the dianion (PDI2&#8722;) is rare. Here we show that full 2&#8208;electron photoreduction can be achieved using UVC light: 1) in anaerobic conditions by &#8216;direct photoreduction&#8217; of PDI aggregates, or 2) by &#8216;indirect photoreduction&#8217; in aerobic conditions due to acetone ketyl radicals. The latter strategy is also efficient for other dyes, such as naphthalenediimide (NDI) and methylviologen (MV2+). Efficient photoreduction on the minute time&#8208;scale using simple LED light in aerobic conditions is attractive for use in dissipative light&#8208;driven systems and materials.

         <title>Photoinduced Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Carbon&#8211;Heteroatom Coupling

         <dc:description>
Exogenous photocatalyst&#8208;free, single nickel&#8208;catalyzed carbon&#8211;heteroatom coupling under visible&#8208;light irradiation is reported. Over 15&#8197;classes of nucleophile can efficiently couple with aryl/alkene halides to afford valuable heteroatomic arenes/alkenes. The unprecedentedly broad substrate scope and late&#8208;stage modification of valuable molecules fully demonstrate the benefits of the method.







Abstract
Herein, we report visible light&#8208;promoted single nickel catalysis for diverse carbon&#8211;heteroatom couplings under mild conditions. This mild, general, and robust method to couple diverse nitrogen, oxygen, and sulfur nucleophiles with aryl(heteroaryl)/alkenyl iodides/bromides exhibits a wide functional group tolerance and is applicable to late&#8208;stage modification of pharmaceuticals and natural products. On the base of preliminary mechanistic studies, a NiI/NiIII cycle via the generation of active NiI complexes that appear from homolysis of NiII&#8722;I rather than NiII&#8722;aryl bond was tentatively proposed.

         <title>Synthesis of Isomeric Tb3+&#8208;Phthalocyanine Double&#8208;Decker Complexes Depending on the Difference in the Direction of Coordination Plane and Their Magnetic Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 1, January 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A C4h symmetrically substituted phthalocyanine was employed to synthesize Tb3+&#8208;phthalocyanine double&#8208;decker complexes. (S,S), (R,R), and meso isomers were obtained depending on the difference in the direction of the coordination plane of the two C4h&#8208;type phthalocyanines with respect to a central Tb3+ ion. It was demonstrated that the meso isomer showed higher energy for spin reversal (Ueff) than those of the enantiomers (S,S and R,R).







Abstract
A C4h symmetrically substituted phthalocyanine, 1,8,15,22&#8208;tertrakis(2,4&#8208;dimethylpent&#8208;3&#8208;oxy)phthalocyanine (H2TdMPPc), was used to synthesize Tb3+&#8208;phthalocyanine double&#8208;decker complexes ([Tb(TdMPPc)2]s). Because H2TdMPPc has C4h symmetry, S,S, R,R, and meso isomers of [Tb(TdMPPc)2] were obtained depending on the difference in the direction of the coordination plane of two C4h&#8208;type phthalocyanines with respect to a central Tb3+ ion. We investigated the physical properties of these [Tb(TdMPPc)2] isomers, including their single&#8208;ion magnetic properties, and found that the spin&#8208;reversal energy barrier (Ueff) of the meso isomer was apparently higher than that of the enantiomers. Detailed crystal structural analyses indicated that the meso isomer has a more symmetrical structure than do the enantiomers, thereby suggesting that the higher Ueff of the meso isomer originated from the more highly symmetrical structure.

         <title>Stereoconvergent Synthesis of Z&#8208;1,3&#8208;Disubstituted&#8208;1,3&#8208;Dienes by Uphill Photocatalysis</title>

         <dc:description>
Isomeric mixtures of 1,3&#8208;dienes were selectively isomerized to their Z&#8208;isomers by uphill photocatalysis using blue LEDs and a catalytic amount of Ru(bpy)32+(PF6&#8722;)2 as the triplet sensitizer. It proved possible to directly convert alkyne and 1&#8208;alkene to Z&#8208;1,3&#8208;dienes by a one&#8208;pot procedure, offering a practical approach to Z&#8208;1,3&#8208;dienes which cannot be made directly by ene&#8208;yne metathesis.







Abstract
A variety of 1&#8208;aryl&#8208;1,3&#8208;dienes were isomerized from E to Z isomers by photocatalysis using Ru(bpy)3[PF6]2 and blue LED light. Enrichment of the Z&#8208;isomer is thought to occur by selective triplet energy transfer from the photocatalyst to the stereoisomeric mixture. The 1,3&#8208;diene starting materials are easily made by catalytic ene&#8208;yne metathesis (EYM). To access 1,3&#8208;diene Z&#8208;stereoisomers directly, a one pot procedure was developed. Additional 1,3&#8208;dienes were investigated for both isomerization and Z&#8208;enrichment. The combination of cross EYM with photocatalysis allows for the stereoconvergent synthesis of Z&#8208;1,3&#8208;dienes.

         <title>Constructing Netlike Nanosheets of ZnO/BiOCl with Heterojunction as Robust Material for Electrochemical Amine Detection</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 1, January 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
ZnO/BiOCl heterojunction material is fabricated by constructing netlike ZnO and BiOCl nanosheets. It exhibits high selectivity to ammonia and detection limit is 0.25&#8197;&#956;M, which is suitable to detect volatile amines quantitatively. The synergetic effects of the heterojunction and netlike structures contribute to boosting electrochemical activity. The ZnO/BiOCl hybrid could be an promising candidate for detection and analysis.







Abstract
The electrochemical sensing is a potential method for detection of trace toxic substance. Herein, the heterojunction of netlike ZnO/BiOCl nanosheets was constructed for the enhanced electrochemical detection of ammonia. Cyclic voltammetry and linear sweep voltammetry were used to investigate the electrochemical performance. The results show that the ZnO/BiOCl&#8208;modified electrode exhibits higher sensitivity towards ammonia compared with the ZnO and BiOCl&#8208;based electrodes, which is ascribed to band structure and fast electron transfer. The high response of 11.8&#8197;&#956;A&#8201;mM&#8722;1 and a low detection limit (LOD) of 0.25&#8197;&#956;M are achieved. In addition, the ZnO/BiOCl material exhibits high selectivity, repeatability and stability. The better linear relationship between concentration and current (R2=0.99) is significant for quantitative detection of ammonia, implying that netlike ZnO/BiOCl nanosheets can serve as electrochemical sensing platform for detecting toxic substance. This research provides a strategy for fabricating two&#8208;dimensional netlike materials and regulating heterojunctions used for electrochemical application.

         <title>Robust Spirobifluorene Core Based Hole Transporters with High Mobility for Long&#8208;Life Green Phosphorescent Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Devices</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 1, January 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A green phosphorescent OLED with a high external quantum efficiency of 22&#8201;% and a long lifetime (LT50) of 89,000&#8197;h at 1000&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2 has been successfully developed by a spirobifluorene&#8208;based multifunctional hole transporter referred to as TDBFSBF1.







Abstract
Using a tailored high triplet energy hole transport layer (HTL) is a suitable way to improve the efficiency and extend the lifetime of organic light&#8208;emitting devices (OLEDs), which can use all molecular excitons of singlets and triplets. In this study, dibenzofuran (DBF)&#8208;end&#8208;capped and spirobifluorene (SBF) core&#8208;based HTLs referred as TDBFSBF1 and TDBFSBF2 were effectively developed. TDBFSBF1 exhibited a high glass transition temperature of 178&#8201;&#176;C and triplet energy of 2.5&#8197;eV. Moreover, a high external quantum efficiency of 22.0&#8201;%, long operational lifetime at 50&#8201;% of the initial luminance of 89,000&#8197;h, and low driving voltage at 1000&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2 of 2.95&#8197;V were achieved in green phosphorescent OLEDs using TDBFSBF1. Further, a high&#8208;hole mobility &#956;h value of 1.9&#215;10&#8722;3&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1 was recorded in TDBFSBF2. A multiscale simulation successfully reproduced the experimental &#956;h values and indicated that the reorganization energy was the primary factor in determining the mobility differences among these SBF core based HTLs.

         <title>Tuning the Photocatalytic Performance of Ruthenium(II) Polypyridine Complexes Via Ligand Modification for Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Induced Phosphorylation of Tertiary Aliphatic Amines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 1, January 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The redox potential of ruthenium(II) complexes were tuned with the aim to expand their applicability as photocatalyst for synthetic conversion. This resulted in an extended scope of the photoredox phosphorylation of tertiary aliphatic amines using a new ruthenium complex as photocatalyst.







Abstract
Tuning the redox potential of commonly available photocatalyst to improve the catalytic performance or expand its scope for challenging synthetic conversions is an ongoing demand in synthetic chemistry. Herein, the excited state properties and redox potential of commercially available [Ru(bpy)3]2+ photocatalyst were tuned by modifying the structure of the bipyridine ligands with electron&#8208;donating/withdrawing units. The visible&#8208;light&#8208;mediated photoredox phosphorylation of tertiary aliphatic amines was demonstrated under mild conditions. A series of cross&#8208;dehydrogenative coupling reactions were performed employing the RuII complexes as photocatalyst giving the corresponding &#945;&#8208;aminophosphinoxides and &#945;&#8208;aminophosphonates via carbon&#8208;phosphorus (C&#8722;P) bond formation.

         <title>Neutral Boryl Radicals in Mixed&#8208;Valent B(III)Br&#8208;B(II) Adducts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 1, January 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two neutral boryl radicals containing intramolecular mixed&#8208;valent B(II)Br&#8208;B(III) adducts were prepared by one&#8208;electron reduction of biphenylene and 9,9&#8208;dimethylxanthene substituted haloboranes. The radical features a large spin density on the boron center and its stabilization is assisted by a weak B(III)Br&#8208;B(II) &#963; interaction.







Abstract
The general strategies to stabilize a boryl radical involve single electron delocalization by &#960;&#8208;system and the steric hinderance from bulky groups. Herein, a new class of boryl radicals is reported, with intramolecular mixed&#8208;valent B(III)Br&#8208;B(II) adducts ligated by a cyclic (alkyl)(amino)carbene (CAAC). The radicals feature a large spin density on the boron center, which is ascertained by EPR spectroscopy and DFT calculations. Structural and computational analyses revealed that the stability of radical species was assisted by the CAAC ligand and a weak but significant B(III)Br&#8208;B(II) interaction, suggesting a cooperative avenue for stabilization of boryl radicals. Two&#8208;electron reduction of these new boryl radicals provides C&#8722;H insertion products via a borylene intermediate.

         <title>Introduction of Ferrocene as a Facilitator for the Construction of Supramolecular Polymers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 1, January 2, 2023. </description>

Ferrocene assistant: The central ferrocene unit facilitates the designed monomer (1,n&#8242;&#8208;disubstituted ferrocene&#8208;azobenzene&#8208;long alkyl chains) to form supramolecular polymer (SP) by supporting higher enthalpy gain. The restricted rotational flexibility of ferrocene allows two azobenzene&#8208;dendritic arms to rotate freely, generating the best possible molecular conformation required for effective intermolecular interactions towards SP formation.







Abstract
Proper monomer design is the key to enhancing the strength of noncovalent interactions between the molecules toward the efficient formation of supramolecular polymers (SPs). We have designed and synthesized 1,n&#8242;&#8208;disubstituted ferrocene&#8208;azobenzene&#8208;long alkyl chains, Fc(CONH&#8208;Azo&#8208;TDP)2, to afford SPs with a high probability. The design exploits the &#8216;&#8216;molecular ball&#8208;bearing&#8217;&#8217; property of the ferrocene core, which allows two azobenzene arms to rotate in the planes of cyclopentadienyl rings, generating the most suitable molecular conformation required for SP formation. This ferrocene monomer formed a supergel consisting of SPs supported by strong intermolecular (H&#8208;bonding and &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking) interactions and higher enthalpy gain than the reference molecules, where the central ferrocene core was replaced by flexible aliphatic as well as rigid benzene linkers. The molecular conformation involved in SPs, the strength of noncovalent interactions, and the process of supramolecular polymerization were investigated through NMR, UV&#8208;Vis, XRD and TEM studies. The results demonstrate that ferrocene may act as a good modulator for constructing efficient SPs.

         <title>Evidence for Multiple Binding Modes in the Initial Contact Between SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Spike S1 Protein and Cell Surface Glycans
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 1, January 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
More than one way to get in: A hexasaccharide bound to site&#8197;I of the spike protein in two binding modes (orange and green tubes) shows that multiple binding modes between heparan sulfate (HS) and S1 (electrostatic potential map on the surface) are allowed. The hypothetical macromolecular complex HS&#8722;S1 does not interfere with the interaction involving S1&#8208;RBD and ACE2, thus supporting the co&#8208;receptor role of HS in the activation of the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 S protein.







Abstract
Infection of host cells by SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 begins with recognition by the virus S (spike) protein of cell surface heparan sulfate (HS), tethering the virus to the extracellular matrix environment, and causing the subunit S1&#8208;RBD to undergo a conformational change into the &#8216;open&#8217; conformation.

     alt="Evidence for Multiple Binding Modes in the Initial Contact Between SARS-CoV-2 Spike S1 Protein and Cell Surface Glycans**&amp;#xA;"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;More than one way to get in&lt;/b&gt;: A hexasaccharide bound to site&#8197;I of the spike protein in two binding modes (orange and green tubes) shows that multiple binding modes between heparan sulfate (HS) and S1 (electrostatic potential map on the surface) are allowed. The hypothetical macromolecular complex HS&#8722;S1 does not interfere with the interaction involving S1-RBD and ACE2, thus supporting the co-receptor role of HS in the activation of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Infection of host cells by SARS-CoV-2 begins with recognition by the virus S (spike) protein of cell surface heparan sulfate (HS), tethering the virus to the extracellular matrix environment, and causing the subunit S1-RBD to undergo a conformational change into the &#8216;open&#8217; conformation. These two events promote the binding of S1-RBD to the angiotensin converting enzyme&#8197;2 (ACE2) receptor, a preliminary step toward viral-cell membrane fusion. Combining ligand-based NMR spectroscopy with molecular dynamics, oligosaccharide analogues were used to explore the interactions between S1-RBD of SARS CoV-2 and HS, revealing several low-specificity binding modes and previously unidentified potential sites for the binding of extended HS polysaccharide chains. The evidence for multiple binding modes also suggest that highly specific inhibitors will not be optimal against protein S but, rather, diverse HS-based structures, characterized by high affinity and including multi-valent compounds, may be required.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Chiral Naphthalenediimides with High&#8208;Efficiency Fluorescence and Circularly Polarized Luminescence in the Solid State for the Application in Organic Optoelectronics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 1, January 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chiral non&#8208;core substituted naphthalenediimides (NDIs) exhibit an L&#8208;shape conformation and self&#8208;assemble into discrete dimers in the solid state. The unique discrete dimeric stacking significantly promoted the fluorescence quantum yields and chiroptical properties via the formation of pre&#8208;associated excimers. The findings disrupt the general idea that non&#8208;core substituted NDIs cannot exhibit strong fluorescence in the solid state.







Abstract
Naphthalenediimides (NDIs) have been extensively studied due to their tunable luminescent properties. However, generally, the monomers or aggregates of non&#8208;core substituted NDIs exhibit low fluorescence quantum yields (&#934;FL&lt;10&#8201;%) in the solid state, which limit their applications as light&#8208;emitting materials and render their chiral species unsuitable for circularly polarized luminescence (CPL). Herein, a series of non&#8208;core substituted chiral NDIs that exhibit high luminous efficiencies (&#934;FL up to 56.8&#8201;% for racemate and 36.5&#8201;% for enantiomer) and a strong CPL behavior in the solid state is reported. These significant improvements are attributed to the unique molecular conformation of the chiral NDIs and the formation of distinctive discrete dimers. The structures of the NDIs were significantly simpler and more accessible than those of other NDIs. The findings evidence that non&#8208;core substituted NDIs can exhibit strong fluorescence in the solid state and provide a new pathway to improve photophysical properties of NDIs.

Abstract
A highly unusual solid&#8208;state epitaxy&#8208;induced phase transformation of Na4SnS4&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;14H2O (I) into Na4Sn2S6&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;5H2O (II) occurs at room temperature. Ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations indicate an internal acid&#8208;base reaction to form [SnS3SH]3&#8722; which condensates to [Sn2S6]4&#8722;. The reaction involves a complex sequence of O&#8722;H bond cleavage, S2&#8722; protonation, Sn&#8722;S bond formation and diffusion of various species while preserving the crystal morphology. In&#8197;situ Raman and IR spectroscopy evidence the formation of [Sn2S6]4&#8722;. DFT calculations allowed assignment of all bands appearing during the transformation. X&#8208;ray diffraction and in&#8197;situ 1H&#8197;NMR demonstrate a transformation within several days and yield a reaction turnover of &#8776;0.38&#8201;%/h. AIMD and experimental ionic conductivity data closely follow a Vogel&#8208;Fulcher&#8208;Tammann type T dependence with D(Na)=6&#215;10&#8722;14&#8197;m2&#8201;s&#8722;1 at T=300&#8197;K with values increasing by three orders of magnitude from &#8722;20 to +25&#8201;&#176;C.

         <title>A Silicon&#8208;Stereogenic Silanol &#8208; 18O&#8208;Isotope Labeling and Stereogenic Probe Reveals Hidden Stereospecific Water Exchange Reaction</title>

         <dc:description>
Silanols are important industrial building blocks for the functionalization of surfaces. In this research, one silicon&#8208;stereogenic silanol was selectively synthesized and analyzed. By using an innovative combination of this stereochemical probe and isotope labeling, a configurationally stable chiral silanol was studied, providing new insights into mechanistic studies.







Abstract
A silicon&#8208;stereogenic aminosilanol was isolated in excellent diastereomeric ratio and the absolute configuration was determined. The silanol is configurative and condensation stable in solution and shows stereoselective transformations with a clean stereospecific pathway in follow&#8208;up reactions, which leads to the isolation of a silicon&#8208;stereogenic zinc complex and siloxane compounds. Investigations with 18O&#8208;labelled water and mass spectrometry analysis revealed an otherwise hidden exchange of oxygen atoms of silanol and water in solution that proceeds with retention of the configuration at the silicon center. This novel combination of a stereochemical probe and isotopic labeling in a silicon&#8208;stereogenic compound opens new analytic possibilities to study stereochemical courses of reactions with the aid of chiral silanols mechanistically.

         <title>Probing Cell&#8208;Surface Interactions in Fungal Cell Walls by High&#8208;Resolution 1H&#8208;Detected Solid&#8208;State NMR Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 1, January 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
How 1H&#8208;detected fast MAS ssNMR spectroscopy can be applied for in&#8208;depth characterization of the Schizophyllum commune cell wall architecture and composition, as well as the elucidation of cell surface&#8208;level interactions. The obtained results reveal the relative abundance and arrangement of the polysaccharide and polypeptide layers and their significance in the binding of ligands to the fungal cell wall.







Abstract
Solid&#8208;state NMR (ssNMR) spectroscopy facilitates the non&#8208;destructive characterization of structurally heterogeneous biomolecules in their native setting, for example, comprising proteins, lipids and polysaccharides. Here we demonstrate the utility of high and ultra&#8208;high field 1H&#8208;detected fast MAS ssNMR spectroscopy, which exhibits increased sensitivity and spectral resolution, to further elucidate the atomic&#8208;level composition and structural arrangement of the cell wall of Schizophyllum commune, a mushroom&#8208;forming fungus from the Basidiomycota phylum. These advancements allowed us to reveal that Cu(II) ions and the antifungal peptide Cathelicidin&#8208;2 mainly bind to cell wall proteins at low concentrations while glucans are targeted at high metal ion concentrations. In addition, our data suggest the presence of polysaccharides containing N&#8208;acetyl galactosamine (GalNAc) and proteins, including the hydrophobin proteins SC3, shedding more light on the molecular make&#8208;up of cells wall as well as the positioning of the polypeptide layer.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;How&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;
   &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;b&gt;H-detected fast MAS ssNMR spectroscopy&lt;/b&gt; can be applied for in-depth characterization of the &lt;i&gt;Schizophyllum commune&lt;/i&gt; cell wall architecture and composition, as well as the elucidation of cell surface-level interactions. The obtained results reveal the relative abundance and arrangement of the polysaccharide and polypeptide layers and their significance in the binding of ligands to the fungal cell wall.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Solid-state NMR (ssNMR) spectroscopy facilitates the non-destructive characterization of structurally heterogeneous biomolecules in their native setting, for example, comprising proteins, lipids and polysaccharides. Here we demonstrate the utility of high and ultra-high field &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H-detected fast MAS ssNMR spectroscopy, which exhibits increased sensitivity and spectral resolution, to further elucidate the atomic-level composition and structural arrangement of the cell wall of &lt;i&gt;Schizophyllum commune&lt;/i&gt;, a mushroom-forming fungus from the Basidiomycota phylum. These advancements allowed us to reveal that Cu(II) ions and the antifungal peptide Cathelicidin-2 mainly bind to cell wall proteins at low concentrations while glucans are targeted at high metal ion concentrations. In addition, our data suggest the presence of polysaccharides containing N-acetyl galactosamine (GalNAc) and proteins, including the hydrophobin proteins SC3, shedding more light on the molecular make-up of cells wall as well as the positioning of the polypeptide layer. Obtaining such information may be of critical relevance for future research into fungi in material science and biomedical contexts.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Pnictogen&#8208;Bridged Diphenyl Sulfones as Photoinduced Pnictogen Bond Forming Emission Motifs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 1, January 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, we investigated pnictogen&#8208;bridged diphenyl sulfones as a new class of luminophores with photoinduced dynamic rearrangement. Experimental and theoretical studies revealed that their emission dynamics could be ascribed to the photoinduced Pn&#8722;bond formation between a lone O pair in the sulfonyl moiety and the antibonding orbital of the Pn&#8722;C bond.







Abstract
In this study, pnictogen (Pn)&#8208;bridged diphenyl sulfones were synthesized as motifs for photoinduced dynamic rearrangement. The newly synthesized sulfones exhibited dual fluorescence at 298&#8197;K. Density functional theory calculations revealed that the longer&#8208;wavelength fluorescence was derived from the geometries after structural relaxation through photo&#8208;driven pnictogen bond formation between the O atom lone pair of the sulfonyl moiety and the antibonding orbital of the Pn&#8722;C bond. This is the first report on emission dynamics driven by pnictogen bond formation upon photoexcitation.

         <title>Organic Crystals with Response to Multiple Stimuli: Mechanical Bending, Acid&#8208;Induced Bending and Heating&#8208;Induced Jumping</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 1, January 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two polymorphs (Form O and Form R) of a Schiff base compound were found, which could respond reversibly to multiple stimuli (external force, acid, heat) by elastic bending, rolling and jumping.







Abstract
Multiple stimuli&#8208;responsive molecular crystals are attracting extensive attentions due to their potential as smart materials, such as molecular machines, actuators, and sensors. However, the task of giving a single crystal multiple stimuli&#8208;responsive properties remains extremely challenging. Herein, we found two polymorphs (Form O and Form R) of a Schiff base compound, which could respond to multiple stimuli (external force, acid, heat). Form O and Form R have different elastic deformability, which can be attributed to the differences in the molecular conformation, structural packing and intermolecular interactions. Moreover, both polymorphs exhibit reversible bending driven by volatile acid vapor, which we hypothesize is caused by reversible protonation reaction of imines with formic acid. In addition, jumping can be triggered by heating due to the significant anisotropic expansion. The integration of reversible bending and jumping into one single crystal expands the application scope of stimuli&#8208;responsive crystalline materials.

         <dc:description>
New catalysts pave the way to new bioplastics with tailor&#8208;made properties. The explorer has experience with homopolymers, packs his saddlebags with various bioderived monomers, and sees multiple options for copolymers on the horizon. This review summarizes copolymer options for polylactide (PLA) with an emphasis on catalysts applicable under industrially relevant conditions or distinguished by their reaction mechanism. Combining lactide with others lactones is covered as well as multimechanistic copolymerizations with non&#8208;lactone monomers. For more details, see the Review by R.&#8197;D. Rittinghaus and S. Herres&#8208;Pawlis (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202202222).

         <title>Frontispiece: Small Molecule Tools to Study Cellular Target Engagement for the Intracellular Allosteric Binding Site of GPCRs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 1, January 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A druggable intracellular allosteric binding site has recently been identified at several G protein&#8208;coupled receptors (GPCRs). Herein, we review small molecule tools, including radioligands, covalent ligands, fluorescent tracers, and PROTACs that enable an unambiguous identification and characterization of target engagement for intracellular allosteric GPCR ligands.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 1, January 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three isomers of a terbium(III) phthalocyanine double&#8208;decker complex have been synthesized and isolated, and their single&#8208;ion magnetic properties have been investigated. S,S, R,R, and meso isomers of [Tb(TdMPPc)2] were generated because of the difference in the direction of the coordination of two C4h&#8208;type phthalocyanines to the central Tb3+ ion. More information can be found in the Research Article by K. Tanaka and co&#8208;workers. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202203272).

         <title>Functional Nanomaterial&#8208;Modified Anodes in Microbial Fuel Cells: Advances and Perspectives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 1, January 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Profiting from superior electrical properties, porosity, specific surface area and biocompatibility, nanomaterials show tremendous potential in promoting the power supply of microbial fuel cells. This Review provides an outline of recent progress on anode modification nanomaterials in microbial fuel cells from the viewpoint of different binding modes of bacteria and materials.







Abstract
Microbial fuel cell (MFC) is a promising approach that could utilize microorganisms to oxidize biodegradable pollutants in wastewater and generate electrical power simultaneously. Introducing advanced anode nanomaterials is generally considered as an effective way to enhance MFC performance by increasing bacterial adhesion and facilitating extracellular electron transfer (EET). This review focuses on the key advances of recent anode modification materials, as well as the current understanding of the microbial EET process occurring at the bacteria&#8208;electrode interface. Based on the difference in combination mode of the exoelectrogens and nanomaterials, anode surface modification, hybrid biofilm construction and single&#8208;bacterial surface modification strategies are elucidated exhaustively. The inherent mechanisms may help to break through the performance output bottleneck of MFCs by rational design of EET&#8208;related nanomaterials, and lead to the widespread application of microbial electrochemical systems.

         <title>Catalysts as Key Enablers for the Synthesis of Bioplastics with Sophisticated Architectures</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 1, January 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly active and selective catalysts pave the way for the production of bioplastics with tailor&#8208;made properties. Comonomers can be used to alter the properties of the prominent bioplastic PLA. Besides the variation in the microstructure, a treasure not yet fully uncovered lies within the combination of different monomer classes in multimechanistic polymerizations.







Abstract
Bioplastics are one of the answers to environmental pollution and linear material flows. The most promising bioplastic polylactide (PLA) is already replacing conventional plastics in a number of applications. The properties of PLA, however, do not fit for all potential application areas, but they can be altered by the introduction of comonomers. The copolymerization of lactide (LA) with other lactones like &#1013;&#8208;caprolactone (CL) has been established for several years. Nevertheless, controlling copolymerizations remains a challenge due to the high complexity of the system. Copolymerization of LA with other monomer classes is much less investigated, but has the chance to overcome the limitations in material properties that occur when only lactones are used. The crucial factor for all copolymerizations is the catalyst. It dominates the reaction kinetics and determines the resulting microstructure. In this review, copolymerization catalysts for LA are presented divided into catalysts for the synthesis of lactone block copolymers, lactone random copolymers, and multimechanistically synthesized copolymers. The selected catalysts are highlighted either owing to their industrially applicable polymerization conditions or their non&#8208;standard mechanism.

         <title>Higher&#8208;order Cycloaddition Reactions for the Construction of Polycyclic Aromatic and Polycyclic Heteroaromatic Compounds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cycloadditions are an important class of reactions in materials science for the construction of polycyclic aromatic and polycyclic heteroaromatic compounds. Recently, cycloadditions have been expanded beyond the &#8220;classical&#8221; group of cycloadditions involving 6&#960;&#8208;electrons, and it is now possible to control cycloadditions for an extended number of &#960;&#8208;electrons by applying organocatalysis. This novel field of cycloadditions&#8212;termed higher&#8208;order cycloadditions&#8212;allows for new synthetic methodologies to construct polycyclic carbo&#8208; and heteroaromatic compounds in two or three dimensions. This Perspective presents higher&#8208;order cycloadditions as a method for accessing two and three dimensional azulenes and cyclazines, as well as, three dimensional indenes, as polycyclic aromatic and polycyclic heteroaromatic compounds.</dc:description>

         <title>Guanidine functionalized fluorescent sp2 carbon&#8208;conjugated covalent organic framework for sensing and capture of Pd(II) and Cr(VI) ions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Palladium is a key element in fuel cells, electronic industries, and organic catalysis. At the same time, chromium is essential in leather, electroplating, and metallurgical industries. However, their unpremeditated leakage into aquatic systems has caused human health and environmental apprehensions. Herein, we reported the development of an sp2 carbon&#8208;conjugated fluorescent covalent organic framework with a guanidine moiety (sp2c&#8208;gCOF) that showed excellent thermal and chemical stability. The sp2c&#8208;gCOF showed effective sensing, capture, and recovery/removal of Pd(II) and Cr(VI) ions which could be due to the highly accessible pore walls decorated with guanidine moieties. The fluorescent sp2c&#8208;gCOF showed higher selectivity for Pd(II) and Cr(VI) ions, with an ultra&#8208;low detection limit of 2.7 and 3.2 nM, respectively. The analysis of the adsorption properties with a pseudo&#8208;second&#8208;order kinetic model showed that sp2c&#8208;gCOF could successfully and selectively remove both Pd(II) and Cr(VI) ions from aqueous solutions. The polymer also showed excellent capture efficacy even after seven consecutive adsorption&#8208;desorption cycles. Hence, this study reveals the potential of fluorescent sp2c&#8208;gCOF for detecting, removing, and recovering valuable metals and hazardous ions from wastewater which would be useful for economic benefit, environmental safety, human health, and sustainability. The post&#8208;synthetic modification of sp2c&#8208;COF with suitable functionalities could also be useful for sensing and extracting other water pollutants and valuable materials from an aqueous system</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Radical&#8208;based reactions usually exhibit excellent functional group compatibilities&#160;due to their mild initiation conditions. Glycosyl radical involved C&#8208;glycosylated modifications are important strategies to achieve highly regio&#8208; and chemoselective constructions of C&#8208;glycosidic bonds or C&#8208;glycoside linkages of peptides and proteins. In this concept, we cover recent developments in glycosyl radicals based synthesis of unnatural amino acids and late&#8208;stage modification of peptides and proteins, and provide a preliminary outlook on the possible development of this direction in the future.</dc:description>

         <title>Asymmetrical Platinum and Rhodium Dinuclear Complex Strongly Bound to Filled dz2 Complexes by Unbridged Pt&#8211;metal Bonds Toward Heterometallic&#8208;Extended Metal Atom Chains</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Heterometallic extended metal atom chains (EMACs) aligned with three types of metals were rationally synthesized by forming unbridged metal&#8211;metal bonds based on the interactions between highest and lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals at the dz2 orbital. These chains form pentanuclear structures aligned as Rh&#8211;Pt&#8211;M&#8211;Pt&#8211;Rh with relatively large formation constants of 5.0 &#215; 1013 M&#8722;2 for M = Pt and 6.3 &#215; 1011 M&#8722;2 for M = Pd, while retaining their backbones in solution. In the case of M = Cu, the original Cu(+2) atoms were reduced to be Cu(+1) during the synthetic process. Cu(+1) has an unprecedented trigonal bipyramidal coordination geometry. The reported synthesis based on asymmetrical dinuclear complexes provides a guideline for the synthesis of hetero&#8208;EMACs to allow several analogs via judicious combinations realized by tuning the number of metal nuclei and metal species.</dc:description>

         <title>Nonmetallic nitrogen doped MnO2 as highly efficient oxygen electrocatalyst for rechargeable zinc&#8208;air batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Zinc&#8208;air batteries (ZABs) have been considered as one of the most promising energy storage devices to solve the problem of energy crisis and environmental pollution. In this work, we reported the synthesis of nitrogen doped MnO2 (N&#8208;MnO2) to replace the noble metal electrocatalysts for air cathode in ZABs. The doped N atoms here introduced more Mn3+ and oxygen vacancies for MnO2, enhancing charge transfer property and accelerating surface intermediate product during the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR).&#160;&#160;Hence, the best N&#8208;MnO2 achieved remarkable electrocatalytic activities towards ORR&#160;(half&#8208;wave potential of 0.797 V vs. RHE), and reversible oxygen overpotential of around 0.842 V, which is better than or comparable to the Pt/C and Mn&#8208;based catalysts reported recently. Moreover, the homemade ZABs based on N&#8208;MnO2 showed the maximum power density of 132.8 mW cm&#8208;2 and excellent cyclic stability.</dc:description>

         <title>Donor&#8208;Acceptor Tribenzotriquinacene&#8208;Based Molecular Wizard Hats Bearing Three ortho&#8208;Benzoquinone Units</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two &#960;&#8208;extended bay&#8208;bridged tribenzotriquinacenes (&#8220;TBTQ wizard hats&#8221;) 12 and 16 bearing three mutually conjugated, alternating veratrole&#8208;type and ortho&#8208;benzoquinone units were synthesized. The electronic properties of these complementarily arranged, nonplanar push&#8208;pull systems are affected by the fusion with the rigid, C3&#8209;symmetric TBTQ core to a different extent, as revealed by X&#8208;ray structural analysis, UV&#8208;vis spectroscopy and cyclovoltammetry. The combination of three quinone units within the original TBTQ core and three veratrole&#8208;type bay bridging units in 12 gives rise to a more efficiently &#960;&#8208;conjugated chromophore, as reflected by the shallower shape of wizard hat and its absorption in the visible up to 750 nm in comparison to 16. Congener 12 contains an aromatic 18&#8208;&#960; electron system in contrast to the cross&#8208;conjugated analog 16. X&#8208;ray structure analysis of the precursor dodecaether 15 revealed the formation of a cage&#8208;like supramolecular dimer, in which the peripheral dioxane&#8208;type ether groups interlace by twelve noncovalent C&#8208;H&#8230;..O bonds.</dc:description>

         <title>New Fields, New Opportunities and New Challenges: Circularly Polarized Multiple Resonance Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Materials</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) materials that concurrently exhibit high efficiency and narrowband emission are extremely attractive due to their promising applications in 3D and wide color gamut display. By merging the CPL optical property and multiple resonance (MR) induced thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) characteristic into one molecule, a new strategy, namely CP&#8208;MR&#8208;TADF, is proposed to generate organic emitters with CPL activity, TADF and narrowband emission. Following this strategy, high&#8208;performance red, green and blue CP&#8208;MR&#8208;TADF emitters have been developed. Herein, we summarized the present status and progress of CP&#8208;MR&#8208;TADF materials in the field of organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs). Finally, for this rapidly growing new research field, the future opportunities are forecasted and the present challenges are discussed.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Two Novel Optically Active #&#8208;Shaped Cyclic Tetramers Based on Planar Chiral [2.2]Paracyclophanes</title>

         <title>Maytansinol Functionalization: Towards Useful Probes for Studying Microtubule Dynamics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The design and synthesis as well as biochemical and structural characterization of long&#8208;chain maytansinoids and maytansinoid conjugates is reported. The results show the prospects of maytansinoids as probes to study microtubule dynamics and lead towards the design of new maytansine&#8208;based derivatives.







Abstract
Maytansinoids are a successful class of natural and semisynthetic tubulin binders, known for their potent cytotoxic activity. Their wider application as cytotoxins and chemical probes to study tubulin dynamics has been held back by the complexity of natural product chemistry. Here we report the synthesis of long&#8208;chain derivatives and maytansinoid conjugates. We confirmed that bulky substituents do not impact their high activity or the scaffold's binding mode. These encouraging results open new avenues for the design of new maytansine&#8208;based probes.

         <title>C&#8722;C Coupling through Nitrogen Deletion: Application to Library Synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A good chemistry, like a great music, sometimes needs a good collaboration. The Cover Picture shows a combination of nitrogen&#8208;deleting anomeric amide power (discovered by Levin's group from the University of Chicago) and parallel synthesis capabilities of Ukrainian chemists, which resulted in a combinatorial library obtained through formal C(sp3)&#8211;C(sp3) coupling and a unique synthetically accessible chemical space of nearly 600&#8197;K representatives. Background photo by Kristina Krynytska. More information can be found in the Research Article by O.&#8197;O.&#8197;Grygorenko and co&#8208;workers. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202203470).

         <title>The Buoy Effect: Surface Enrichment of a Pt Complex in IL Solution by Ligand Design</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fluorinated side chains of a functionalized Pt complex in an ionic liquid act as buoys, leading to pronounced enrichment of the complex at the IL/gas interface, as is evidenced by strongly enhanced Pt signals in angle&#8208;resolved photoelectron spectroscopy. For complexes without these side chains no such effect is observed. More information can be found in the Research Article by H.&#8208;P.&#8197;Steinr&#252;ck and co&#8208;workers. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202203325).

         <title>Carbonylmetallates as versatile 2&#8208;, 4&#8208; or 6&#8208;Electron Donor Metalloligands in Transition&#8208;Metal Complexes and Clusters: A Global Approach</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Carbonylmetallates [m]&#8208;, such as [MoCp(CO)3]&#8208;, [Mn(CO)5]&#8208;, [Co(CO)4]&#8208;, have long been successfully used in the preparation of hundreds of metal carbonyl complexes and clusters, in particular of the heterometallic type. We focus here on situations where [m]&#8208; can be viewed as a terminal, doubly&#8208; or even triply&#8208;bridging metalloligand, developing metal&#8208;metal interactions with one, two or three metal centres M, respectively. With metals M from the groups 10&#8208;12, is not straightforward or even impossible to rationalize the structure of the resulting clusters by applying the well&#8208;known Wade&#8208;Mingos rules. A very simple but global approach is presented to rationalize structures not obeying usual electron&#8208;counting rules by considering the anionic building blocks [m]&#8208; as metalloligands behaving formally as potential 2, 4 or 6 electron donors, similarly to what is typically encountered with e.g. halido ligands. Qualitative and theoretical arguments using DFT calculations highlight similarities between seemingly unrelated metal complexes and clusters and also entails a predicting power with high synthetic potential.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Thioesters from Aldehydes via N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene (NHC) Catalyzed Radical Relay</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We have developed an efficient N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC)&#8208;catalyzed thioesterification of aldehydes using N&#8208;thiosuccinimides as the thiolation reagent. This organocatalyzed transition involves the generation of sulfur radicals by single electron transfer of the Breslow enolate (generated from aldehyde and NHC catalyst) with N&#8208;thiosuccinimides. This method offers facile access to various highly functionalized thioesters and exhibits good chemical yields and functional group tolerance.</dc:description>

         <title>Stabilization&#160;of 2D Imine&#8208;linked Covalent Organic Frameworks: From Linkage Chemistry to Interlayer Interaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Imine&#8208;linked covalent organic frameworks (imine&#8208;COFs) represent the most sought&#8208;after class of COFs due to their broad monomer scope and ease of synthesis. Owing to the reversible nature of imine linkages, however, the chemical stability of the most imine&#8208;COFs is still far from adequate. In this context, emerging strategies ranging from linkage chemistry to interlayer interaction have been employed to construct stable imine&#8208;COFs for their applications in electronics, sensing, and energy storage devices. This concept article summarizes the latest advances aimed at tuning the structural stability of imine&#8208;COFs. Furthermore, this concept provides a prospective for the precise design of stable imine&#8208;COFs based on the characteristics of structure, physical properties, and chemical functions, as well as the mechanism of structure locking and stabilization during crystal growth.</dc:description>

         <title>Microporous metal&#8208;phosphonates with a novel orthogonalized linker and complementary guests: Insights for trivalent metal complexes from divalent metal complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Microporous metal&#8208;phosphonate materials can offer greater stability but are challenging to crystallize.&#160; Here, a novel orthogonalized aryl&#8208;phosphonate linker, 1,3,5&#8208;tris(4&#8217;&#8208;phosphono&#8208;2&#8217;,6&#8217;&#8208;dimethylphenyl) benzene (H6L3) is&#160;used to direct formation of open frameworks. The peripheral aryl rings of H6L3 are orthogonalized relative to the central aromatic ring giving a tri&#8208;cleft conformation of the linker in which aromatic molecules can nest. When coordinated to magnesium ions, a series of porous crystalline metal&#8208;organic, and hydrogen&#8208;bonded metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs, HMOFs) are formed (CALF&#8208;41 (Mg), HCALF&#8208;42 (Mg), &#8208;43 (Mg)). While most MOFs&#160;are tailored based on choice of metal and linker, here, the network structures are highly dependent on the inclusion and structure of the guest&#160;compounds. Larger guests, and a higher stoichiometry of metal, result in increased solvation of the metal ion, resulting in networks with connectivities increasingly involving H&#8208;bonds rather than direct phosphonate coordination. Upon thermal activation, the materials exhibit surface areas ranging from 400&#8208;600 m2/g. Self&#8208;assembly in the absence of aromatic guests yields mixtures of phases, frequently co&#8208;producing a dense structure (1). Interestingly, a series of both more porous (525&#8208;900 m2/g), and more robust solids is formed by complexing with trivalent metal ions (Al, Ga, In) with aromatic guest; however, these are only attainable as microcrystalline powders. The polyprotic nature of phosphonates enables structural analogy to the divalent CALF&#8208;41 analogues. Finally, insights to the structural transformations during metal ion desolvation&#160;are gained by considering structurally related Co materials, whose hydrogen&#8208;bonded (HCALF&#8208;44 (Co)) and desolvated (CALF&#8208;44 (Co)) coordination networks were structurally characterized.</dc:description>

         <title>Reconstructured Electrocatalysts during Oxygen Evolution Reaction under Alkaline Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reconstruction of transition metal&#8208;based electrocatalysts during water oxidation has become a common understanding. The obtained metal (oxy)hydroxide layers derived from surface reconstruction process usually show much higher electrocatalytic performance than the directed synthesized (oxy)hydroxide counterparts, highlighting the key role of interaction between substrate materials and surface reconstructed active species. Read more about reconstructed chemistry and substrate effect in transition metal&#8208;based OER electrocatalysts in the Review article by W. Luo et&#8197;al.







Abstract
The development of electrocatalysts with high&#8208;efficiency and clear structure&#8208;activity relationship towards the sluggish oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is essential for the wide application of water electrolyzers. Recently, the dynamic reconstruction phenomenon of the catalysts&#8217; surface structures during the OER process has been discovered. With the help of various advanced ex situ and in situ characterization, it is demonstrated that such surface reconstruction could yield actual active species to catalyze the water oxidation process. However, the attention and studies of potential interaction between reconstructed species and substrate are lacking. This review summarizes the recent development of typical reconstructed electrocatalysts and the substrate effect. First, the advanced characterization for electrocatalytic reconstruction is briefly discussed. Then, typical reconstructed electrocatalysts are comprehensively summarized and the key role of substrate effects during the OER process is emphasized. Finally, the future challenges and perspectives of surface reconstructed catalysts for water electrolysis are discussed.

         <title>Preparation and Functionalization of Mono&#8208; and Polyfluoroepoxides via Fluoroalkylation of Carbonyl Electrophiles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a new synthetic methodology that allows tandem 1,2&#8208;addition and ring closure reactions between fluoroalkyl anion synthons and carbonyl electrophiles to form fluorinated epoxides. We clarify the generality of the reaction sequence by examining the fluoroalkyl requiremements. This approach enabled access to unique compounds that can be diversified through either ring opening or ring opening defluorinative functionalization reactions.







Abstract
We outline a new synthetic method to prepare mono&#8208; and polyfluoroepoxides from a diverse pool of electrophiles (ketones, acyl chlorides, esters) and fluoroalkyl anion equivalents. The initially formed &#945;&#8208;fluoro alkoxides undergo subsequent intramolecular ring closure when heated. We demonstrated the versatility of the method through the isolation of 16 mono&#8208; and polyfluoroepoxide products. These compounds provide unique entry points for further diversification via either fluoride migration coupled with ring opening, or defluorinative functionalization reactions, the latter of which can be used as a late&#8208;stage method to install select bioactive moieties. The reaction sequences described herein provide a pathway to functionalize the commonly observed products formed from 1,2&#8208;addition into carbonyl electrophiles

         <title>Edge&#8208;Decorated Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons by an Oxidative Coupling Approach</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Alkoxy highly edge&#8208;decorated polycylic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) have been formed. Oxidative cross coupling of phenols constructs frameworks without any need for the prefunctionalization required by conventional methods. Moreover, smaller optical gaps can be achieved relative to systems of similar size.







Abstract
Oxidative phenol coupling reduces reliance on halo/metalated substrates used in conventional redox neutral couplings. A new strategy for constructing polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) that incorporates oxidative phenol coupling is outlined in a three&#8208;stage approach: oxidative fragment coupling, linking of the two resultant units, and oxidative cyclization. The protocol allows rapid assembly of both planar and helical systems with a high degree of edge functionalization. The incorporation of 12 alkoxy groups on systems with 12 rings gave rise to lower optical gaps compared to systems with a lesser degree of edge functionalization.

Diastereoisomer separation: Through the use of a well&#8208;defined enantiopure &#960;&#8208;allylic ruthenium(IV) precatalyst, facile access to enantioenriched indolin&#8208;3&#8208;one emitters was achieved. Facile separation of diastereoisomers demonstrated mirror image chiroptical responses.







Abstract
A novel enantiopure &#960;&#8208;allylruthenium(IV) precatalyst allowed the enantioselective and stereospecific allylations of indoles and gave access to indolin&#8208;3&#8208;ones, containing vicinal stereogenic centers. Facile separation of diastereoisomers exhibiting opposite circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) activities in diverse solvents, including water, demonstrated the potential of these sustainable transformations and of the newly prepared molecules.

         <title>Acceleration Effect of Bowl&#8208;Shaped Structure in Aerobic Oxidation Reaction: Synthesis of Homosumanene ortho&#8208;Quinone and Azaacene&#8208;Fused Homosumanenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The intrinsic strain in the molecule considerably accelerates the oxidation rate of peripheral carbons in aromatic compounds. The aerobic oxidation of hydroxyhomosumanene proceeds much faster than for the planar analogue because of their unusual keto&#8208;enol tautomerization caused by the curved structure. The homosumanene ortho&#8208;quinone was converted to several azaacene&#8208;fused homosumanenes, and their crystal structures, photophysical properties, and charge transport properties were investigated.







Abstract
An oxidation reaction of hydroxyhomosumanene on silica gel providing homosumanene ortho&#8208;quinone and its synthetic application for azaacene&#8208;fused homosumanenes is described. Hydroxyhomosumanene is photochemically oxidized by air, when it is coated on silica gel; this aerobic oxidation proceeds faster than that of planar analogues. The difference of such reactivity was attributed to the unusual keto&#8208;enol tautomerization due to structural difference between planar and curved &#960;&#8208;system. The homosumanene ortho&#8208;quinone was used in the synthesis of several azaacene&#8208;fused homosumanenes, azaacenohomosumanenes. X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis of the single crystals revealed their columnar stacking structures due to the interactions between each bowl. Azaacenohomosumanenes exhibited high electron affinity due to the combination of buckybowl and electron&#8208;deficient azaacene moieties.

         <title>Assembly of Helical Nanostructures: Solvent&#8208;Induced Morphology Transition and Its Effect on Cell Adhesion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Just add water: Self&#8208;assembled intermediates were thoroughly modulated from an minimal model phenylalanine&#8208;based derivative (LPFM) featuring a C2 structure with single l&#8208;Phe conjugated on para&#8208;benzene. By altering the ratio of ethanol/H2O co&#8208;solvents, a dynamic morphological evolution of nanofibers from right&#8208; to left&#8208;handedness was successively revealed. The left&#8208;handed nanostructures were found to be favorable for cell adhesion and proliferation.







Abstract
Being able to precisely manipulate both the morphology and chiroptical signals of supramolecular assemblies will help to better understand the natural biological self&#8208;assembly mechanism. Two simple l/d&#8208;phenylalanine&#8208;based derivatives (L/DPFM) have been designed, and their solvent&#8208;dependent morphology evolutions are illustrated. It was found that, as the content of H2O in aqueous ethanol solutions was increased, LPFM self&#8208;assembles first into right&#8208;handed nanofibers, then flat fibrous structures, and finally inversed left&#8208;handed nanofibers. Assemblies in ethanol and H2O exhibit opposite conformations and circular dichroism (CD) signals even though they are constructed from the same molecules. Thus, the morphology&#8208;dependent cell adhesion and proliferation behaviors are further characterized. Left&#8208;handed nanofibers are found to be more favorable for cell adhesion than right&#8208;handed nanostructures. Quantitative AFM analysis showed that the L929&#8197;cell adhesion force on left&#8208;handed LPFM fibers is much higher than that on structures with inversed handedness. Moreover, the value of cell Young's modulus is lower for left&#8208;handed nanofibrous films, which indicates better flexibility. The difference in cell&#8208;substrate interactions might lead to different effects on cell behavior.

Finding out the angles: Flow chemistry using microreactors makes it possible to obtain 5&#8208;diethylboryl&#8208;2,3&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine, which cannot be synthesized in batch processes. The observation of equilibrium processes under 1&#8197;min is feasible by using flow NMR spectroscopy, which also reveals that a slight change in the angle of the constituent molecule affects the dynamic equilibrium in solution and crystal structure.







Abstract
5&#8208;Diethylboryl&#8208;2,3&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine (1), which is inaccessible by conventional batch methods, was synthesized by using a flow microreactor. Compound 1 was obtained as an equilibrium mixture of a cyclic trimer and a cyclic tetramer in solution, the latter of which was crystallized in benzene by vapor diffusion of hexane at 7&#8201;&#176;C. The dynamic nature of this system was confirmed by solvent&#8208; and concentration&#8208;dependent experiments. Notably, the dynamics was verified by using flow NMR spectroscopy, which revealed that the time required to reach equilibrium was influenced by the solvent ratio (&lt;18&#8197;s, 24&#8211;28&#8197;s, and 34&#8211;42&#8197;s in 2&#8201;:&#8201;1, 1&#8201;:&#8201;1, and 1&#8201;:&#8201;2 mixtures of [D6]acetone and C6D6, respectively). Compound 1 and 3&#8208;[4&#8242;&#8208;(diethylboryl)phenyl]pyridine (2) exhibited different self&#8208;assembly behavior in solution and crystals. Density functional theory calculations suggested that this difference was largely due to enhanced planarity between two consecutive aromatic rings.

         <title>Molecular Rotational Correlation Times and Nanoviscosity Determined by 111mCd Perturbed Angular Correlation (PAC) of &#947;&#8208;rays Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Brownian molecular tumbling rates in solution have been measured by using 111mCd perturbed angular correlation of &#947;&#8208;rays (PAC) spectroscopy and a de novo designed molecular probe (a trimeric coiled&#8208;coil protein). Most materials are relatively transparent to &#947;&#8208;rays, and PAC spectroscopy might find applications where conventional methods probing rotational correlation times, for example, NMR and fluorescence spectroscopy, cannot be applied&#8212;from the physics of liquids to in&#8208;vivo biochemistry.







Abstract
The nanoviscosity experienced by molecules in solution may be determined through measurement of the molecular rotational correlation time, &#964;c, for example, by fluorescence and NMR spectroscopy. With this work, we apply PAC spectroscopy to determine the rate of rotational diffusion, &#955;=1/&#964;c, of a de novo designed protein, TRIL12AL16C, in solutions with viscosities, &#958;, from 1.7 to 88&#8197;mPa&#8901;s. TRIL12AL16C was selected as molecular probe because it exhibits minimal effects due to intramolecular dynamics and static line broadening, allowing for exclusive elucidation of molecular rotational diffusion. Diffusion rates determined by PAC data agree well with literature data from fluorescence and NMR spectroscopy, and scales linearly with 1/&#958; in agreement with the Stokes&#8211;Einstein&#8211;Debye model. PAC experiments require only trace amounts (&#8764;1011) of probe nuclei and can be conducted over a broad range of sample temperatures and pressures. Moreover, most materials are relatively transparent to &#947;&#8208;rays. Thus, PAC spectroscopy could find applications under circumstances where conventional techniques cannot be applied, spanning from the physics of liquids to in&#8208;vivo biochemistry.

         <title>Resolving the Chemical Formula of Nesquehonite via NMR Crystallography, DFT Computation, and Complementary Neutron Diffraction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
NMR crystallography and neutron diffraction can settle a longstanding debate regarding the chemical formula for the CO2 mineralization target species, nesquehonite, through examination of the effects of H on 13C tensors. It is a hydrated magnesium carbonate [MgCO3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;3H2O], and not a hydroxy&#8208; hydrated&#8208; magnesium bicarbonate.







Abstract
Nesquehonite is a magnesium carbonate mineral relevant to carbon sequestration envisioned for carbon capture and storage of CO2. Its chemical formula remains controversial today, assigned as either a hydrated magnesium carbonate [MgCO3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;3H2O], or a hydroxy&#8208; hydrated&#8208; magnesium bicarbonate [Mg(HCO3)OH&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2H2O]. The resolution of this controversy is central to understanding this material&#8216;s thermodynamic, phase, and chemical behavior. In an NMR crystallography study, using rotational&#8208;echo double&#8208;resonance 13C{1H} (REDOR), 13C&#8722;1H distances are determined with precision, and the combination of 13C static NMR lineshapes and density functional theory (DFT) calculations are used to model different H atomic coordinates. [MgCO3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;3H2O] is found to be accurate, and evidence from neutron powder diffraction bolsters these assignments. Refined H positions can help understand how H&#8208;bonding stabilizes this structure against dehydration to MgCO3. More broadly, these results illustrate the power of NMR crystallography as a technique for resolving questions where X&#8208;ray diffraction is inconclusive.

         <title>How Research Data Management Plans Can Help in Harmonizing Open Science and Approaches in the Digital Economy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The integration of open science into a digital economy, while considering legal European regulations, is a balancing act. Here research data management plans play a key role and has the potential to combine the interests of researchers as data producers and the public as data users in publicly funded projects.







Abstract
Within this perspective article, we intend to summarise definitions and terms that are often used in the context of open science and data&#8208;driven R&amp;D and we discuss upcoming European regulations concerning data, data sharing and handling. With this background in hand, we take a closer look at the potential connections and permeable interfaces of open science and digital economy, in which data and resulting immaterial goods can become vital pieces as tradeable items. We believe that both science and the digital economy can profit from a seamless transition and foresee that the scientific outcomes of publicly funded research can be better exploited. To close the gap between open science and the digital economy, and to serve for a balancing of the interests of data producers, data consumers, and an economy around services and the public, we introduce the concept of generic research data management plans (RDMs), which have in part been developed through a community effort and which have been evaluated by academic and industry members of the NFDI4Cat consortium. We are of the opinion that in data&#8208;driven research, RDMs do need to become a vital element in publicly funded projects.

         <dc:description>One dimensional (1D) organic&#8208;inorganic halide hybrid perovskite has the advantages of excellent organic cation modifiability and diversity of inorganic framework structures, which cannot be ignored in the development of multi&#8208;functional phase transition materials in photoelectric and photovoltaic devices. Here, we have successfully modified and synthesized an organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid perovskite photoelectric multifunctional phase transition material: [C7H13ONCH2F] PbBr3 (1). The synergistic effect of the order double disorder transition of organic cations and the change of the degree of distortion of the inorganic framework leads to its high temperature reversible phase transition point of Tc=374 K/346 K and its ultra&#8208;low loss high&#8208;quality dielectric switch response. Through in&#8208;depth research and calculation, compound 1 also has excellent semiconductor characteristics with a band gap of 3.06 eV and the photoluminescence characteristics of STE broadband emission. Undoubtedly, this modification strategy provides a new choice for the research field of organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid perovskite reversible phase transition photoelectric multifunctional materials with rich coupling properties.</dc:description>

         <title>Fast Motions Dominate Dynamics of Intrinsically Disordered Tau Protein at High Temperatures</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Reorientational dynamics of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) contain multiple motions often clustered around three motional modes: ultrafast librational motions of amide groups, fast local backbone conformational fluctuations and slow chain segmental motions. This dynamic picture is mainly based on 15N NMR relaxation studies of IDPs at relatively low temperatures where the amide&#8208;water proton exchange rates are sufficiently small. Less is known, however, about the dynamics of IDPs at more physiological temperatures. Here, we investigate protein dynamics in a 441&#8208;residue long IDP, tau protein, in the temperature range from 0&#8208;25 &#176;C, using 15N NMR relaxation rates and spectral density analysis. While at these temperatures relaxation rates are still better described in terms of amide group librational motions, local backbone dynamics and chain segmental motions, the temperature&#8208;dependent trend of spectral densities suggests that the timescales of fast backbone conformational fluctuations and slower chain segmental motions might become inseparable at higher temperatures. Our data demonstrate the remarkable dynamic plasticity of this prototypical IDP and highlight the need for dynamic studies of IDPs at multiple temperatures.</dc:description>

         <title>Recognizing the Minimum Structural Units Driving the Crystallization of SAPO&#8208;34 from a Top&#8208;Down Process</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Recognizing the structure and nature of the nuclei for zeolites crystallization at an atomic level is of great importance, which can provide guidance on the control of crystallization kinetics and the rational synthesis of zeolites. However, it remains a long&#8208;standing challenge due to the difficulty in characterization of amorphous precursor with limited crystal nuclei. Herein, a top&#8208;down synthesis system was designed for SAPO&#8208;34 molecular sieve and well investigated. A clear precursor solution with abundant SAPO&#8208;34 crystal nuclei was obtained under a depolymerization&#8208;dominant condition. The species in liquid precursor were identified by FT&#8208;ICR MS, solid&#8208;state MAS NMR and atomic pair distribution function analyses. In combination with various designed experiments, it is revealed that the formation of small species containing Si&#8208;O&#8208;Al bonds and reaching certain concentration, rather than structural units with specific spatial conformation, is crucial for driving the crystallization of SAPO&#8208;34. This work provides important understanding on the (pre)nucleation of SAPO&#8208;34 and will shed lights on the synthesis control of SAPO molecular sieves.</dc:description>

         <title>Reagent&#8208;Controlled Regioselective Intramolecular [2+2] Cycloaddition between Vinylsilanes and Allenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This paper provides the first report of the intramolecular [2+2] cycloaddition of vinylsilane. The [2+2] cycloaddition of allenes is a useful reaction that can synthesize cyclobutanes. However, no previous works have attempted to control the regioselectivity between the two double bonds of allenes only by changing the reaction conditions, although there have been some reports of the regioselective [2+2] cycloaddition of allenes by changing the substrate. In this study, we have succeeded in controlling intramolecular [2+2] cycloaddition reactions at the proximal and distal positions of allenes simply by changing the reaction conditions. We found that the atomic radius of silicon is very important for perfect control of the reaction&#8217;s sites. The structures of all key compounds were determined by the crystal sponge method which could identify the structures of liquid compounds.</dc:description>

         <title>AIE&#8208;doped Poly(Ionic Liquid) Photonic Spheres for the Discrimination of Psychoactive Substances</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Drugs of abuse has drawn intense attention due to increasing concerns to public health and safety. The construction of a sensing platform with the capability to identify them remains a big challenge because of the limitations of synthetic complexity, sensing scope and receptor extendibility. Here a kind of poly(ionic liquid) (PIL) photonic crystal spheres doped with aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) luminogens was developed. As diverse noncovalent interactions involve in PIL moieties, the single sphere shows different binding affinity to a broad range of psychoactive substances. Furthermore, the dual&#8208;channel signals arising from photonic crystal structures and sensitive AIE&#8208;luminogens provide high&#8208;dimensional information for discriminative detection&#160;of targets, even for molecules with slight structural differences. More importantly, such single sphere sensing platform could be flexibly customized through ion&#8208;exchange, showing great extendibility to fabricate high&#8208;efficiency/high&#8208;throughput sensing arrays without tedious synthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>Dispersibility of TiO2 Nanoparticles in Less Polar Solvents: Role of Ligand Tail Structures</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nanoparticles (NPs) are inherently prone to aggregation and loss of their size&#8208;derived properties, thus it is essential to enhance their dispersibility for applications. In less polar solvents, organic ligands containing oleyl groups are known as good dispersants due to their inefficient shell packing and inhibition of chain&#8208;chain crystallization and interdigitation between adjacent NPs. However, reagents with oleyl structures, such as oleic acid and oleylamine, may contain trans double bonds and saturated impurities, which may affect the chemical and/or physical properties of the NPs. Nevertheless, the effect of slight differences in surface ligand structure, including isomers, on the dispersibility of NPs has been little studied. Here, we synthesize five phosphonic acid ligands to investigate the structure&#8211;dispersibility relationship in detail. Dynamic light scattering and visible light transmittance reveal that not only regio&#8208; but stereochemistries of the C=C double bond in the ligand molecule, as well as choice of solvent, are key factors to enhance dispersibility.</dc:description>

         <title>Electroreduction of Carbon Dioxide to Acetate using Heterogenized Hydrophilic Manganese Porphyrins</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide (CO2) to value&#8208;added chemicals is a promising strategy to mitigate climate change. Metalloporphyrins have been used as a promising class of stable and tunable catalysts for the electrochemical reduction reaction of CO2 (CO2RR) but have been primarily restricted to single&#8208;carbon reduction products. Here we utilize functionalized earth&#8208;abundant manganese tetraphenylporphyrin&#8208;based (Mn&#8208;TPP) molecular electrocatalysts that have been immobilized via electrografting onto a glassy carbon electrode (GCE) to convert CO2 with overall 94% Faradaic efficiencies, with 62% being converted to acetate. Tuning of Mn&#8208;TPP with electron&#8208;withdrawing sulfonate groups (Mn&#8208;TPPS) introduced mechanistic changes arising from the electrostatic interaction between the sulfonate groups and water molecules, resulting in better surface coverage which facilitated higher conversion rates than the non&#8208;functionalized Mn&#8208;TPP. For Mn&#8208;TPP only carbon monoxide and formate were detected as CO2 reduction products. Density&#8208;functional theory (DFT) calculations confirm that the additional sulfonate groups could alter the C&#8208;C coupling pathway from *CO&#8208;&gt;*COH&#8208;&gt;*COH&#8208;CO to *CO&#8208;&gt;*CO&#8208;CO&#8208;&gt;*COH&#8208;CO, reducing the free energy barrier of C&#8208;C coupling in the case of Mn&#8208;TPPS. This opens a new approach to designing metalloporphyrin catalysts for two carbon products in CO2RR.</dc:description>

         <title>Co&#8208;based Catalysts for Selective H2O2 Electroproduction via 2&#8208;electron Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In recent years, more and more attention has been paid to the production of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) by 2&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Among them, Co&#8722;based catalysts have been widely studied for the selective production of H2O2 by 2&#8208;electron ORR. Here, this review focuses on the mechanism of 2&#8208;electron ORR from the perspective of kinetics and thermodynamics and summarizes the research progress of Co&#8722;based catalysts including Co molecular catalysts, Co nanoparticles, Co compounds, and Co single atom catalysts. It was demonstrated that Co&#8722;based catalysts had exhibited great selectivity towards 2&#8208;electron ORR. Finally, we also discuss the challenges faced by various types of catalysts.







Abstract
Electrochemical production of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) via two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) process is emerging as a promising alternative method to the conventional anthraquinone process. To realize high&#8208;efficiency H2O2 electrosynthesis, robust and low cost electrocatalysts have been intensively pursued, among which Co&#8722;based catalysts attract particular research interests due to the earth&#8208;abundance and high selectivity. Here, we provide a comprehensive review on the advancement of Co&#8722;based electrocatalyst for H2O2 electroproduction. The fundamental chemistry of 2&#8208;electron ORR is discussed firstly for guiding the rational design of electrocatalysts. Subsequently, the development of Co&#8722;based electrocatalysts involving nanoparticles, compounds and single atom catalysts is summarized with the focus on active site identification, structure regulation and mechanism understanding. Moreover, the current challenges and future directions of the Co&#8722;based electrocatalysts are briefly summarized in this review.

Here, this review focuses on the mechanism of 2-electron ORR from the perspective of kinetics and thermodynamics and summarizes the research progress of Co&#8722;based catalysts including Co molecular catalysts, Co nanoparticles, Co compounds, and Co single atom catalysts. It was demonstrated that Co&#8722;based catalysts had exhibited great selectivity towards 2-electron ORR. Finally, we also discuss the challenges faced by various types of catalysts.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Electrochemical production of hydrogen peroxide (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) via two-electron oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) process is emerging as a promising alternative method to the conventional anthraquinone process. To realize high-efficiency H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; electrosynthesis, robust and low cost electrocatalysts have been intensively pursued, among which Co&#8722;based catalysts attract particular research interests due to the earth-abundance and high selectivity. Here, we provide a comprehensive review on the advancement of Co&#8722;based electrocatalyst for H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; electroproduction. The fundamental chemistry of 2-electron ORR is discussed firstly for guiding the rational design of electrocatalysts. Subsequently, the development of Co&#8722;based electrocatalysts involving nanoparticles, compounds and single atom catalysts is summarized with the focus on active site identification, structure regulation and mechanism understanding. Moreover, the current challenges and future directions of the Co&#8722;based electrocatalysts are briefly summarized in this review.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Enhancing the Resistive Switching Behavior of WORM Memory Devices Using D&#8722;&#960;&#8722;A Based Ester&#8208;Flanked Quinolines

Organic memory devices: Ester&#8208;flanked quinoline&#8208;based triarylamines in a donor&#8208;acceptor architecture attributed to a facile intramolecular charge transfer which contributes to a WORM (Write&#8208;Once Read&#8208;Many times) memory characteristic. The structural integrity and stability of the device gives new dimensions to the organic memristors with a balanced charge carrier concept.







Abstract
Donor&#8208;Acceptor systems are highly appreciated in the field of organic memory devices due to their efficient charge transport within the systems. In this work, we have designed and synthesized a D&#8722;&#960;&#8722;A system constituting ester&#8208;flanked quinolines and functionalized triarylamines (TAA) through a single&#8208;step cross&#8208;coupling reaction to fabricate memory devices via Write&#8208;Once Read&#8208;Many times (WORM) non&#8208;volatile memory. Structure&#8208;property relationships are reconnoitered for these conjugated D&#8722;&#960;&#8722;A systems through a series of UV, fluorescence, XRD, DFT, and memory characterizations. The UV and CV data show efficient charge transfer with intramolecular charge transfer occurring at 407&#8211;417&#8197;nm and a short band gap of 2.56&#8211;2.65&#8197;eV. An enhancement in the resistive switching behavior of the memory devices is observed for the compounds with simple TAA&#8208;quinoline and tert&#8208;butylphenyl substituted TAA and fluorophenyl substituted quinoline due to balanced charge distribution in the compounds. This enhanced switching induces an on/off ratio of 103 by generating a highly ordered arrangement in the thin films. The HOMO, LUMO levels, and the ESP images together estimate a charge transfer and charge trapping as the plausible mechanism for the solution&#8208;processable WORM memory devices. The longer retention time (103&#8197;s) and lower threshold voltages (&#8722;1.21&#8211;&#8722;2.12&#8197;V) of the devices makes them intriguing compounds for memory applications.

         <title>Structural and Functional Insight into the Mechanism of the Fe&#8722;S Cluster&#8208;Dependent Dehydratase from Paralcaligenes ureilyticus</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fe&#8208;S cluster&#8208;dependent dehydratases (DHTs) from the ilvD/EDD superfamily play an central role in enzyme cascades for the biomanufacture of the platform chemical isobutanol. Here, functional data for the DHT from Paralcaligenes ureilyticus have provided unprecedented insight into the catalytic mechanism of these enzymes that may inform bioengineering approaches to optimise the cascade.







Abstract
Enzyme&#8208;catalyzed reaction cascades play an increasingly important role for the sustainable manufacture of diverse chemicals from renewable feedstocks. For instance, dehydratases from the ilvD/EDD superfamily have been embedded into a cascade to convert glucose via pyruvate to isobutanol, a platform chemical for the production of aviation fuels and other valuable materials. These dehydratases depend on the presence of both a Fe&#8722;S cluster and a divalent metal ion for their function. However, they also represent the rate&#8208;limiting step in the cascade. Here, catalytic parameters and the crystal structure of the dehydratase from Paralcaligenes ureilyticus (PuDHT, both in presence of Mg2+ and Mn2+) were investigated. Rate measurements demonstrate that the presence of stoichiometric concentrations Mn2+ promotes higher activity than Mg2+, but at high concentrations the former inhibits the activity of PuDHT. Molecular dynamics simulations identify the position of a second binding site for the divalent metal ion. Only binding of Mn2+ (not Mg2+) to this site affects the ligand environment of the catalytically essential divalent metal binding site, thus providing insight into an inhibitory mechanism of Mn2+ at higher concentrations. Furthermore, in silico docking identified residues that play a role in determining substrate binding and selectivity. The combined data inform engineering approaches to design an optimal dehydratase for the cascade.

         <title>Base&#8208;Stabilized Neutral Oxoborane and Thioxoborane Supported by a Bis(oxazolinyl)(phenyl)methanide Ligand</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Base&#8208;stabilized neutral oxoborane and thioxoborane supported by a bis(oxazolinyl)(phenyl)methanide ligand have been synthesized and structurally characterized. While previous synthetic attempts of oxoborane ligated by &#946;&#8208;diketiminate (NacNac) did not allow for its isolation in acid&#8208;free form, oxoborane supported by a bis(oxazolinyl)(phenyl)methanide ligand is isolable, due to the absence of imine &#593;&#8208;protons and steric protection of enamine carbon. The utility of bis(oxazolinyl)(phenyl)methanide ligand suggests further applications of the scaffold as a synthetically viable yet chemically inert substitute of the prototypical NacNac ligands.

Organic photoreactions &#8220;on water&#8221;, namely in aqueous suspension or emulsion, are significantly accelerated in this ecologically favorable medium.







Abstract
Two representative organic photoreactions, namely a bimolecular photocycloaddition and a monomolecular photorearrangement, are presented that are accelerated when the reaction is performed &#8220;on&#8208;water&#8221;, that is, at the water&#8208;substrate interface with no solvation of the reaction components. According to the established models of ground&#8208;state reactions &#8220;on&#8208;water&#8221;, the enhanced efficiency of the photoreactions is explained by hydrophobic effects (Patern&#243;&#8208;B&#252;chi reaction) or specific hydrogen bonding (di&#8208;&#960;&#8208;methane rearrangement) at the water&#8208;substrate interface that decrease the energy of the respective transition state. These results point to the potential of this approach to conduct photoreactions more efficiently in an ecologically favorable medium.

         <title>A Simple Substitution on Thyroid Hormones Remarkably Alters the Regioselectivity of Deiodination by a Deiodinase Mimic</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The deiodination of L&#8208;thyroxine (T4) plays key roles in the thyroid hormone homeostasis. This chemical model study reveals that the modulation of the electronic properties of the iodine atoms in T4 through the phenolic group has a remarkable influence on the regioselectivity of the deiodination.







Abstract
The regioselective deiodinations of L&#8208;thyroxine (T4) play key roles in the thyroid hormone homeostasis. These reactions are catalyzed by three isoforms of the selenoenzymes, iodothyronine deiodinases (Dio1, Dio2 and Dio3), which are highly homologous in nature. Dio1 mediates 5&#8242;&#8208; or 5&#8208;deiodinations of T4 to produce T3 and rT3, respectively. In contrast, Dio2 and Dio3 are selective to 5&#8242;&#8208; or 5&#8208;deiodination to produce T3 and rT3, respectively. Understanding of the regioselectivity of deiodination at the molecular level is important as abnormal levels of thyroid hormone have been implicated in various clinical conditions, such as hypoxia, myocardial infarction, neuronal ischemia and cancer. In this paper, we report that the electronic properties of the iodine atoms in thyroxine (T4) can be modulated through a simple substitution in the 4&#8242;&#8208;phenolic moiety. This leads to the change in the regioselectivity of deiodination by different small molecule mimics of Dio enzymes. By using this chemical approach, we also show that the substitution of a strong electron withdrawing group facilitates the removal of all four iodine atoms in the T4 derivative. Theoretical investigations on the hydrogen bonded adducts of T4 with imidazole indicate that the charge on the iodine atoms depend on the nature of hydrogen bond between the &#8722;OH group of T4 and the imidazole moiety. While the imidazole can act as either hydrogen bond acceptor (HBA) or hydrogen bond donor (HBD), the protonated imidazole acts exclusively as HBD in T4&#8208;imidazole complex. These studies support the earlier observations that the histidine residue at the active sites of the deiodinases play an important role not only in the substrate binding, but also in altering the regioselectivity of the deiodination reactions.

         <title>Di&#8208;Iron(II) [2+2] Helicates of Bis&#8208;(Dipyrazolylpyridine) Ligands: The Influence of the Ligand Linker Group on Spin State Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This diiron(II) complex has been crystallized in three different helicate conformations, which differ in the torsions of the butane&#8208;1,4&#8208;diyl ligand linker groups. The crystals exhibit a range of spin state properties, including stepwise spin&#8208;crossover of the two iron atoms. A related ligand with a rigid pyrid&#8208;2,6&#8208;diyl spacer forms more a distorted, high&#8208;spin diiron(II) helicate structure.







Abstract
Four bis[2&#8208;{pyrazol&#8208;1&#8208;yl}&#8208;6&#8208;{pyrazol&#8208;3&#8208;yl}pyridine] ligands have been synthesized, with butane&#8208;1,4&#8208;diyl (L1), pyrid&#8208;2,6&#8208;diyl (L2), benzene&#8208;1,2&#8208;dimethylenyl (L3) and propane&#8208;1,3&#8208;diyl (L4) linkers between the tridentate metal&#8208;binding domains. L1 and L2 form [Fe2(&#956;&#8722;L)2]X4 (X&#8722;=BF4&#8722; or ClO4&#8722;) helicate complexes when treated with the appropriate iron(II) precursor. Solvate crystals of [Fe2(&#956;&#8722;L1)2][BF4]4 exhibit three different helicate conformations, which differ in the torsions of their butanediyl linker groups. The solvates exhibit gradual thermal spin&#8208;crossover, with examples of stepwise switching and partial spin&#8208;crossover to a low&#8208;temperature mixed&#8208;spin form. Salts of [Fe2(&#956;&#8722;L2)2]4+ are high&#8208;spin, which reflects their highly twisted iron coordination geometry. The composition and dynamics of assembly structures formed by iron(II) with L1&#8722;L3 vary with the ligand linker group, by mass spectrometry and 1H NMR spectroscopy. Gas&#8208;phase DFT calculations imply the butanediyl linker conformation in [Fe2(&#956;&#8722;L1)2]4+ influences its spin state properties, but show anomalies attributed to intramolecular electrostatic repulsion between the iron atoms.

         <title>Br&#248;nsted Acid/Base Site Isolated in a Pentanuclear Scaffold</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In the traditional framework of acid&#8208;base chemistry, H+ always locates at a position that can provide a thermodynamically stable state. Here, we report the first example of H+ that exists in its thermodynamically metastable state using steric isolation of Br&#248;nsted acid/base sites within a heterometallic multinuclear complex. The current study offers a novel strategy for controlling the location of H+ within materials.







Abstract
The concept of Br&#248;nsted&#8208;Lowry acids and bases is long and widely recognized as the most reasonable theory to explain the behavior of H+ ions. Here, we report a Br&#248;nsted acid/base pair that does not follow this theory. Two heteronuclear metal complexes, in which Br&#248;nsted acid/base sites are sterically isolated, were synthesized and characterized. These sterically isolated sites exhibited anomalous behavior, wherein the H+ species encapsulated in the Br&#248;nsted acid site did not undergo a deprotonation reaction, and the corresponding protonation reaction at the Br&#248;nsted base site failed to proceed. As a result, two states that are in a relationship of a Br&#248;nsted acid/base pair stably exist over a wide pH range without any interconversion, generating a thermodynamically metastable state. Additionally, these two states exhibited distinct electron transfer abilities and reactivities. The system presented in this study is in sharp contrast with the traditional concept of Br&#248;nsted&#8211;Lowry acids and bases.

Two switches, three components, quadruple switchability: Tying together two types of anionic molecular switches with cationic macroions by self&#8208;assembly in an aqueous solution results in stable nano&#8208;objects, the size and shape of which can be changed by irradiation with two wavelengths, pH alteration, and darkness.







Abstract
Multi&#8208;switchable supramolecular nano&#8208;objects that respond to irradiation of different wavelengths with changes in size and shape have been built from two different water&#8208;soluble molecular switches, joined by attachment to the same polyelectrolyte. Accordingly, two wavelength&#8208;specific reactions, namely the excited&#8208;state proton dissociation of a photoacid and the cis&#8211;trans isomerization of an azo dye, are combined in one supramolecular nano&#8208;object that is stable in aqueous solution. The concept has potential in the fields of sensors, molecular motors, and transport.

         <title>Woven Polymer Networks: From Crystalline to Elastomeric Materials</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Warp and weft: The duplication of macroscopic woven structures at the molecular level is always an attractive and promising research field. Herein, we summarize the latest advances in constructing woven polymer networks, and further exhibit the structural superiority of woven topology in regulating physical properties of polymeric materials.







Abstract
Weaving technology has been extensively used for manufacturing macroscopic fabrics and satisfying the artistic demands of humans through the ages. Integrating woven geometries into molecular structures is a persistent pursuit, and yet a significant challenge to chemists, owing to the lack of effective methodologies to guide the regular mutual interlacing of molecular strands. In this Concept article, recent progress and related strategies in constructing woven polymer networks (WPNs) are summarized and discussed.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Warp and weft&lt;/b&gt;: The duplication of macroscopic woven structures at the molecular level is always an attractive and promising research field. Herein, we summarize the latest advances in constructing woven polymer networks, and further exhibit the structural superiority of woven topology in regulating physical properties of polymeric materials.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Weaving technology has been extensively used for manufacturing macroscopic fabrics and satisfying the artistic demands of humans through the ages. Integrating woven geometries into molecular structures is a persistent pursuit, and yet a significant challenge to chemists, owing to the lack of effective methodologies to guide the regular mutual interlacing of molecular strands. In this Concept article, recent progress and related strategies in constructing woven polymer networks (WPNs) are summarized and discussed. An outlook is then given to highlight the future opportunities and challenges in the development of both molecularly woven structures and molecularly woven functional materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Structure Determination of the Crystalline LiPON Model Structure Li5+xP2O6&#8722;xN1+x with x&#8776;0.9</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Li5+xP2O6&#8722;xN1+x (x&#8776;0.9) is a crystalline compound suitable as model compound for the understanding of structural traits within amorphous LiPON materials. A plethora of analytical methods, including diffraction methods, NMR, vibration spectroscopy and elemental analyses, was employed for elucidation of structure and composition of this substance. Ionic conductivity was measured using impedance spectroscopy.







Abstract
Non&#8208;crystalline lithium oxonitridophosphate (LiPON) is used as solid electrolyte in all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries. Crystalline lithium oxonitridophosphates are important model structures to retrieve analytical information that can be used to understand amorphous phases better. The new crystalline lithium oxonitridophosphate Li5+xP2O6&#8722;xN1+x was synthesized as an off&#8208;white powder by ampoule synthesis at 750&#8211;800&#8201;&#176;C under Ar atmosphere. It crystallizes in the monoclinic space group P21/c with a=15.13087(11)&#8197;&#197;, b=9.70682(9)&#8197;&#197;, c=8.88681(7)&#8197;&#197;, and &#946;=106.8653(8)&#176;. Two P(O,N)4 tetrahedra connected by an N atom form the structural motif [P2O6&#8722;xN1+x](5+x)&#8722;. The structure was elucidated from X&#8208;ray diffraction data and the model corroborated by NMR and infrared spectroscopy, and elemental analyses. Measurements of ionic conductivity show a total ionic conductivity of 6.8&#215;10&#8722;7&#8201;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 75&#8201;&#176;C with an activation energy of 0.52&#177;0.01&#8197;eV.

         <title>Conformationally Restricted &#946;&#8208;Sheet Breaker Peptides Incorporating Cyclic &#945;&#8208;Methylisoserine Sulfamidates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The use of a cyclic sulfamidate moiety as a &#946;&#8208;sheet breaker element is proposed for the first time. The sulfamidate effectively locks the peptide secondary structure in a novel rigid turn both in the gas phase and solid state, which is also maintained in solution. Peptides bearing this motif show moderate amyloid&#8208;&#946; inhibition activity.







Abstract
Peptides containing variations of the &#946;&#8208;amyloid hydrophobic core and five&#8208;membered sulfamidates derived from &#946;&#8208;amino acid &#945;&#8208;methylisoserine have been synthesized and fully characterized in the gas phase, solid state and in aqueous solution by a combination of experimental and computational techniques. The cyclic sulfamidate group effectively locks the secondary structure at the N&#8208;terminus of such hybrid peptides imposing a conformational restriction and stabilizing non&#8208;extended structures. This conformational bias, which is maintained in the gas phase, solid state and aqueous solution, is shown to be resistant to structure templating through assays of in&#8197;vitro &#946;&#8208;amyloid aggregation, acting as &#946;&#8208;sheet breaker peptides with moderate activity.

         <title>Photoinduced Dehydrogenative Borylation via Dihydrogen Bond Bridged Electron Donor and Acceptor Complexes
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
For the first time, amine&#8208; and phosphine&#8208;boranes are discovered as donors to integrate with pyridinium acceptors for generating photoactive electron&#8208;donor&#8208;acceptor (EDA) complexes bridged by a dihydrogen bond. Irradiating the EDA complex enables an intra&#8208;complex SET to give a boron&#8208;centered radical with no need of external photosensitizer and radical initiator for effective pyridine borylation.







Abstract
Air&#8208;stable amine&#8208; and phosphine&#8208;boranes are discovered as donors to integrate with pyridinium acceptor for generating photoactive electron&#8208;donor&#8208;acceptor (EDA) complexes. Experimental results and DFT calculations suggest a dihydrogen bond bridging the donor and acceptor. Irradiating the EDA complex enables an intra&#8208;complex single electron transfer to give a boron&#8208;centered radical for dehydrogenative borylation with no need of external photosensitizer and radical initiator. The deprotonation of Wheland&#8208;like radical intermediate rather than its generation is believed to determine the good ortho&#8208;selectivity based on DFT calculations. A variety of &#945;&#8208;borylated pyridine derivatives have been readily synthesized with good functional group tolerance.

         <title>Interplay Between Hydrogen Bonding and Electron Transfer in Mixed Valence Assemblies of Triarylamine Trisamides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Not only hydrogen bonds but also a specific packing arrangement are necessary to get fast electron transfer in mixed valence assemblies of triarylamine trisamides. Defects in the hydrogen bonding network are detected upon increasing the number of radical species in the mixed valence assemblies present in the film state without impeding the delocalization of the unpaired electrons.







Abstract
Hydrogen&#8208;bonding interactions are assumed to play a critical role in the long&#8208;range transport of light or charge recently observed in supramolecular assemblies of C3&#8208;symmetrical discotic molecules. Herein, the structure of mixed valence assemblies formed by irradiating triarylamine trisamide (TATA) molecules was determined by multifarious techniques under various conditions with the aim of probing the interplay between the hydrogen bonding network and the rate of electron transport in different states (solution, gel, film). Irradiation was performed under initial states that vary by the degree of association of TATA monomers through hydrogen bonds. Firstly, a significant shift of the N&#8722;H and C=O stretching frequencies was observed by FTIR upon irradiation thus revealing an overlooked signature of TATA&#8901;+ species and interacting mixed valence aggregates. Secondly, gels and films both mostly consist of hydrogen&#8208;bonded TATA polymers but their EPR spectra recorded at 293&#8197;K reveal very different behaviors: localized electrons in the gels versus fully delocalized electrons in the films. Hydrogen bonding thus appears as a necessary but not sufficient condition to get fast electron transfer rates and a packing of the TATA monomers particularly suitable for charge transport is assumed to exist in the solid state. Finally, defects in the hydrogen bonding network are detected upon increasing the number of radical species in the mixed valence assemblies present in the film state without impeding the delocalization of the unpaired electrons. A delicate balance between hydrogen bonds and packing is thus necessary to get supramolecular polarons in mixed valence TATA assemblies.

         <title>Direct Coupling of Methane and Carbon Dioxide on Tantalum Cluster Cations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
How the tantalum cluster cations catalyze: The cationic tantalum atom and the cationic tetramer exhibit a strong size&#8208;dependent reactivity with methane and carbon dioxide: The monomer yields products from C&#8722;C coupling reactions, while the tetramer enables the formation of formaldehyde or syngas.







Abstract
Understanding molecular&#8208;scale reaction mechanisms is crucial for the design of modern catalysts with industrial prospect. Through joint experimental and computational studies, we investigate the direct coupling reaction of CH4 and CO2, two abundant greenhouse gases, mediated by Ta1,4+ ions to form larger oxygenated hydrocarbons. Coherent with proposed elementary steps, we expose products of CH4 dehydrogenation [Ta1,4CH2]+ to CO2 in a ring electrode ion trap. Product analysis and reaction kinetics indicate a predisposition of the tetramers for C&#8722;O coupling with a conversion to products of CH2O, whereas atomic cations enable C&#8722;C coupling yielding CH2CO. Selected experimental findings are supported by thermodynamic computations, connecting structure, electronic properties, and catalyst function. Moreover, the study of bare Ta1,4+ compounds indicates that methane dehydrogenation is a significant initial step in the direct coupling reaction, enabling new, yet unknown reaction pathways.

         <title>Dichromic Allophycocyanin Trimer Covering a Broad Spectral Range (550&#8211;660&#8197;nm)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
When exploring the role of chromophores in phycobilisome assembly, a novel dichromic allophycocyanin was obtained that greatly extends the spectral range for light&#8208;harvesting. A linker contained in the structure is successfully used for template&#8208;assisted assembly in&#8197;vitro. This approach would also allow for targeting, in artificial photosynthetic systems or fluorescence labeling.







Abstract
Phycobilisomes, the light&#8208;harvesting complexes of cyanobacteria and red algae, are a resource for photosynthetic, photonic and fluorescence labeling elements. They cover an exceptionally broad spectral range, but the complex superstructure and assembly have been an obstacle. By replacing in Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 the biliverdin reductases, we studied the role of chromophores in the assembly of the phycobilisome core. Introduction of the green&#8208;absorbing phycoerythrobilin instead of the red&#8208;absorbing phycocyanobilin inhibited aggregation. A novel, trimeric allophycocyanin (Dic&#8208;APC) was obtained. In the small (110&#8197;kDa) unit, the two chromophores, phycoerythrobilin and phytochromobilin, cover a wide spectral range (550 to 660&#8197;nm). Due to efficient energy transfer, it provides an efficient artificial light&#8208;harvesting element. Dic&#8208;APC was generated in&#8197;vitro by using the contained core&#8208;linker, LC, for template&#8208;assisted purification and assembly. Labeling the linker provides a method for targeting Dic&#8208;APC.

         <title>Ab Initio Metadynamics Simulations of Hexafluoroisopropanol Solvent Effects: Synergistic Role of Solvent H&#8208;Bonding Networks and Solvent&#8208;Solute C&#8211;H/&#960; Interactions</title>

         <dc:description>The solvent effects in Friedel&#8211;Crafts cycloalkylation of epoxides and Cope rearrangement of aldimines were investigated by using ab initio molecular dynamics simulations. Explicit molecular treatments were applied for both reactants and solvents. The reaction mechanisms were elucidated via free energy calculations based on metadynamics simulations. The results reveal that both reactions proceed in a concerted fashion. Key solvent&#8208;substrate interactions are identified from the structures of transition states with explicit solvent molecules. The remarkable promotion effect of hexafluoroisopropanol solvent is ascribed to the synergistic effect of H&#8208;bonding networks and C&#8211;H/&#960; interactions with substrates.</dc:description>

         <title>Tin Active Sites Confined in Zeolite Framework as a Promising Shape&#8208;Selective Catalyst for Ethylene Oxide Hydration</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Shape&#8208;selective stannosilicates have been post&#8208;synthesized for the hydration of epoxide to diols. A simple acid treatment has been employed to remove extensively the interlayer double four ring units, converting the three&#8208;dimensional (3D) UTL germanosilicate into a 2D layered IPC&#8208;1P intermediate. Isomorphous incorporation of tetrahedrally coordinated Sn active centers was realized via solid&#8208;liquid treatment of IPC&#8208;1P with diammonium hexachlorostannate aqueous solution, which was accompanied by the spontaneous condensation of neighboring silica&#8208;rich cfi layers upon calcination and structural construction of a 3D PCR structure. Sn&#8208;PCR stannosilicates with tunable Sn contents were thus prepared. With Sn&#8208;derived robust Lewis acidity confined in the intersecting 10&#8208; and 8&#8208;ring channels, the Sn&#8208;PCR (Si/Sn molar ratio of 77) catalyst served as a shape&#8208;selective nanoreactor for the hydration of ethylene oxide (EO) into ethylene glycol (EG), exhibiting a remarkable EO conversion (99.5%) as well as a steady EG selectivity (&gt;98.4%) at greatly reduced H2O/EO molar ratio and near&#8208;ambient reaction temperature.</dc:description>

         <title>Theoretical and Experimental Investigations of Stable Arylfluorene&#8208;based Radical&#8208;type Mechanophores</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Radical&#8208;type mechanophores (RMs) can undergo homolytic cleavage of their central C&#8211;C bonds upon exposure to mechanical forces, which affords radical species. Understanding the characteristics of these radical species allows designing and developing bespoke mechanoresponsive materials. The thermal stability of the central C&#8211;C bonds and the oxygen tolerance of the generated radical species are crucial characteristics that determine the functions and applicability of such RM&#8208;containing mechanoresponsive materials. In this paper, we report the synthesis and characterization of two series of arylfluorene&#8208;based RM derivatives, i.e., 9,9&#8217;&#8208;bis(5&#8208;methyl&#8208;2&#8208;pyridyl)&#8208;9,9&#8217;&#8208;bifluorene (BPyF) and 9,9&#8217;&#8208;bis(4,6&#8208;diphenyl&#8208;2&#8208;triazyl)&#8208;9,9&#8217;&#8208;bifluorene (BTAF). The synthesis of BPyF and BTAF derivatives was accomplished without generating any peroxides initially, albeit that BPyF slowly converted to the corresponding peroxide in solution. DFT calculations revealed the importance of the thermodynamic stability and the values of the a&#8208;SOMO levels of the corresponding radical species for their thermal stability and oxygen tolerance. Furthermore, the mechanochromism of BTAF was demonstrated by ball&#8208;milling a BTAF&#8208;centered polymer, which was synthesized via atom&#8208;transfer radical polymerization (ATRP).</dc:description>

         <title>Effect of mesogenic corona on type and anisotropy of gold nanoparticle superlattice: When can tail wag the dog?</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The correlation between size of nanoparticles and structure and shape of mesogenic ligands and the ensuing assembly behaviour is not really understood and closer inspection shows very surprising features. Here 2 and 4 nm gold nanoparticles (NP) were synthesized, grafted with a forked ligand containing two rod&#8208;like mesogens in its two branches: one with cholesterol and the other with azobenzene. The 4 nm NPs also contained n&#8208;hexylthiol as co&#8208;ligand. They were found to form an FCC cubic superlattice, while the 2 nm NPs form hexagonal HCP with weak birefringence, hence with partially oriented ligands. The structures were compared with those of related systems containing a range of different azobenzene&#8208;to&#8208;cholesterol ratios, all giving body&#8208;centered tetragonal superlattices with various degrees of anisotropy. Geometric analysis is presented in terms of asphericity of NP surrounding, requirement for space&#8208;filling and structural anisotropy. Some general rules are derived to help design the soft corona around the NPs in order to obtain superlattices with desired structure and anisotropy.</dc:description>

         <title>One&#8208;pot Tandem Coupling Method for the Short Step Formal Synthesis of Riccardin C</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>One&#8208;pot reactions reduce reagent amounts and circumvent process treatments, such as work&#8208;up and purifications in multi&#8208;step reactions. In this study, we achieved the formal total synthesis of riccardin C through a one&#8208;pot reaction by simultaneously linking four units through two Sonogashira coupling reactions and one Suzuki coupling reaction, followed by reduction and deprotection. Thus, this one&#8208;pot method comprised five steps and did not require the purification of intermediate reaction mixtures, which saves resources, such as reagents and solvents, and expedites the work process.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>

         <title>Fabricating Robust Pt Clusters on Sn&#8208;Doped CeO2 for CO Oxidation: A Deep Insight into Support Engineering and Surface Structural Evolution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The size effect on nanoparticles, which affects the catalysis performance in a significant way, is crucial. The tuning of oxygen vacancies on metal&#8208;oxide support can help reduce the size of the particles in active clusters of Pt, thus improving catalysis performance of the supported catalyst. Herein, Ce&#8208;Sn solid solutions (CSO) with abundant oxygen vacancies have been synthesized. Activated by simple CO reduction after loading Pt species, the catalytic CO oxidation performance of Pt/CSO was significantly better than that of Pt/CeO2. The reasons for the elevated activity were further explored regarding ionic Pt single sites being transformed into active Pt clusters after CO reduction. Due to more exposed oxygen vacancies, much smaller Pt clusters were created on CSO (ca. 1.2 nm) than on CeO2 (ca. 1.8 nm). Consequently, more exposed active Pt clusters significantly improved the ability to activate oxygen and directly translated to the higher catalytic oxidation performance of activated Pt/CSO catalysts in vehicle emission control applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Pd/Co Catalyst with High Pd Atom Utilization Efficiency for Nitrobenzene Hydrogenation at Room Temperature: Experimental and DFT Studies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Enhancing catalytic performance as well as reducing catalyst cost are the eternal pursuit for the catalysis community. Herein, a simple and effective palladium&#8208;doped cobalt (Pd/Co) catalyst with high Pd atom utilization efficiency was synthesized via galvanic replacement reaction for the selective hydrogenation of nitrobenzene with H2 at room temperature, delivering &gt;99% yield of aniline with up to 158 times higher catalytic activity than commercial palladium powder. Detailed characterizations and DFT calculations revealed that Co&#8208;Pd interaction leads to a decrease in electron density of Pd and the distance between Pd atoms that results in the enhanced catalytic performance. Further experiments indicated that the Pd/Co catalyst serves as a highly efficient, selective, and recyclable catalyst for a range of nitroarene substrates. This work might provide a green and sustainable methodology to design and synthesize highly active catalysts with high utilization efficiency of the noble metals in fundamental and applied research.</dc:description>

         <title>Conjugation Extension and Halochromic Behaviors of S&#8208;Fused Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons Bearing Cyclopenta[b]thiopyran Moieties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three S&#8208;fused polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons bearing cyclopenta[b]thiopyran moieties show intriguing halochromic properties in both solution and solid states. Upon alternative treatments by trifluoroacetic acid and triethylamine, the absorption and the fluorescence can be reversibly switched. It is revealed that the introduced proton is on the cyclopentadiene ring while the positive charge is localized on the thiopyrylium ring.







Abstract
Three S&#8208;fused polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) bearing cyclopenta[b]thiopyran moieties have been designed and successfully synthesized. With the conjugation extension, the absorption onset of the longest PAH reaches 1110&#8197;nm. All the three S&#8208;fused PAHs exhibit significant halochromic properties in both solution and solid states. Upon protonation, the proton is incorporated on the cyclopentadiene ring while the positive charge is localized on the thiopyrylium ring. Moreover, no significant difference can be found for the two shorter PAHs upon the protonation by different organic acids, such as trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) and trifluoromethanesulfonic acid (TfOH), while the longest PAH can be only mono&#8208;protonated by TFA but di&#8208;protonated by stronger TfOH. Furthermore, after protonation, the non&#8208;emissive S&#8208;fused PAHs exhibit strong fluorescence and can be regenerated by simply neutralization with triethylamine. The enhanced emission of mono&#8208;protonated products stem from S2&#8594;S0 transitions, which disobey the Kasha's rule.

         <title>Organometallic Platinum(II) Photosensitisers that Demonstrate Ligand&#8208;Modulated Triplet&#8208;Triplet Annihilation Energy Upconversion Efficiencies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of substituted 2&#8208;phenylquinoxaline ligands have been explored to finely tune the electronic properties of cyclometalated platinum(II) complexes. The complexes were successfully applied as photosensitisers in triplet&#8211;triplet annihilation upconversion experiments, demonstrating tuneable upconversion quantum yields of up to 14&#8201;%.







Abstract
A series of 2&#8208;phenylquinoxaline ligands have been synthesised that introduce either CF3 or OCF3 electron&#8208;withdrawing groups at different positions of the phenyl ring. These ligands were investigated as cyclometalating reagents for platinum(II) to give neutral complexes of the form [Pt(C^N)(acac)] (in which C^N=cyclometalating ligand; acac=acetyl acetonate). X&#8208;ray crystallographic studies on three examples showed that the complexes adopt an approximate square planar geometry. All examples revealed strong Pt&#8722;Pt linear contacts of 3.2041(6), 3.2199(3) and 3.2586(2)&#8197;&#197;. The highly coloured complexes display efficient visible absorption at 400&#8211;500&#8197;nm (&#1013; &#8776;5000&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8197;cm&#8722;1) and orange red photoluminescent characteristics (&#955;em=603&#8211;620&#8197;nm; &#934;em &#8804;37&#8201;%), which were subtly tuned by the ligand. Triplet emitting character was confirmed by microsecond luminescence lifetimes and the photogeneration of singlet oxygen with quantum efficiencies up to 57&#8201;%.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A series of substituted 2-phenylquinoxaline ligands&lt;/b&gt; have been explored to finely tune the electronic properties of cyclometalated platinum(II) complexes. The complexes were successfully applied as photosensitisers in triplet&#8211;triplet annihilation upconversion experiments, demonstrating tuneable upconversion quantum yields of up to 14&#8201;%.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A series of 2-phenylquinoxaline ligands have been synthesised that introduce either CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; or OCF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; electron-withdrawing groups at different positions of the phenyl ring. These ligands were investigated as cyclometalating reagents for platinum(II) to give neutral complexes of the form [Pt(C^N)(acac)] (in which C^N=cyclometalating ligand; acac=acetyl acetonate). X-ray crystallographic studies on three examples showed that the complexes adopt an approximate square planar geometry. All examples revealed strong Pt&#8722;Pt linear contacts of 3.2041(6), 3.2199(3) and 3.2586(2)&#8197;&#197;. The highly coloured complexes display efficient visible absorption at 400&#8211;500&#8197;nm (&#1013; &#8776;5000&#8197;M&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8197;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) and orange red photoluminescent characteristics (&lt;i&gt;&#955;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;em&lt;/sub&gt;=603&#8211;620&#8197;nm; &lt;i&gt;&#934;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;em&lt;/sub&gt; &#8804;37&#8201;%), which were subtly tuned by the ligand. Triplet emitting character was confirmed by microsecond luminescence lifetimes and the photogeneration of singlet oxygen with quantum efficiencies up to 57&#8201;%. Each complex was investigated as a photosensitiser for triplet&#8211;triplet annihilation energy upconversion using 9,10-diphenylanthracene as the annihilator species: a range of good upconversion efficiencies (&lt;i&gt;&#934;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;UC&lt;/sub&gt; 5.9&#8211;14.1&#8201;%) were observed and shown to be strongly influenced by the ligand structure in each case.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Homogeneous Dearomative Hydrogenation with a Co/P4N2 Catalyst: A Nucleophilic Approach</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Co(P4N2)H species that has been demonstrated to be a strong hydride donor could deliver a hydride ion to less electron&#8208;rich arenes and heteroarenes in a nucleophilic manner. Deuterium labeling experiments supported a Michael&#8208;type reaction pathway. Theoretical analyses have been conducted to investigate the hydricity of the CoH species and the electrophilicity of the arenes.







Abstract
Arene hydrogenation is the most straightforward method to prepare carbo&#8208; and heterocycles. However, the high resonance energy prevents aromatic substrates from hydrogenation. Herein the homogeneous, nucleophilic hydrogenation of less electron&#8208;rich arenes and heteroarenes is reported. The Co(P4N2)H species that has been demonstrated to be a strong hydride donor could deliver a hydride ion to the cyano (hetero)arene substrates. Deuterium labeling experiments supported a Michael&#8208;type reaction pathway. Theoretical analyses have been conducted to investigate the hydricity of the catalytically active CoH species and the electrophilicity of the arene substrates. An outlook for the synthesis of more challenging substituted benzenes was proposed based on the in&#8197;silico modification of the CoH species.

         <title>Boron&#8208;Mediated Regioselective Aromatic C&#8722;H Functionalization via an Aryl BF2 Complex</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Regioselective functionalization of 2&#8208;aryl&#8208;azaarenes N&#8208;heteroarenes and aryl aldehydes has been achieved. The reaction proceeds via a BBr3 promoted 5 and 6&#8208;membered boracycle that undergoes a ligand exchange promoted by Selectfluor to give a previously scarce aryl BF2 species. The aryl BF2 is a bench stable intermediate that can be used for the deborylative functionalization of the 2&#8208;aryl&#8208;azaarenes scaffold.







Abstract
An efficient regioselective functionalization of 2&#8208;aryl&#8208;heteroarenes and aryl aldehydes via an azaaryl BF2 complex has been developed. Mechanistically the reaction comprises fluoride to bromide ligand exchange on an aryl boron species and consecutive C&#8722;B bond cleavage to deliver a broad range of functionalized products. The reaction is high yielding, has a broad substrate scope where several different heteroarenes can be functionalized with chloro, bromo, iodo, hydroxyl, amine and BF2 in a highly regioselective fashion. The method can be applied for late&#8208;stage functionalization or for rapid skeleton remodeling with for instance cross&#8208;couplings.

         <title>Synthesis and Characterization of Hypervalent Pentacoordinate Carbon Compounds Bearing a 7&#8208;6&#8208;7&#8208;Ring Skeleton</title>

         <dc:description>
Electronic tuning of ground&#8208;state structures for tetra&#8208; and penta&#8208;coordinate carbon species has been achieved by changing electronic properties of the equatorial aryl groups on the central carbon, confirmed by a correlation between Hammett para&#8208;substituent constant and solid&#8208;state structures of a series of cationic species based on a 7&#8208;6&#8208;7 tricyclic framework.







Abstract
To stabilize SN2 transition state&#8208;like penta&#8208;coordinate carbon species, triaryl&#8208;substituted cationic carbon compounds bearing a moderately flexible 7&#8208;6&#8208;7&#8208;ring skeleton with sulfur donors were synthesized and characterized. Electronic effects of para substituents (R=Cl, F, H, CH3, SMe, OMe) of the two equatorial aryl groups bound to the cationic central carbon were investigated systematically along with a planar bidentate thioxanthene derivative. X&#8208;ray analysis on their solid&#8208;state structures showed that the parent (R=H), chloro&#8208;, fluoro&#8208; and methyl&#8208;derivatives were tetracoordinate carbon (sulfonium) structures, while the p&#8208;MeO and thioxanthenyl system were pentacoordinate carbocation structures. The Hammett substituent constants for the para substituents (&#963;p+) correlates well with the bonding in these compounds. The methylthio&#8208;derivative with intermediate Hammett substituent constants (p&#8208;MeS; &#963;p+=&#8722;0.60) showed a tetracooridnate solid&#8208;state structure, though solution UV&#8208;Vis properties suggested the presence of a penta&#8208;coordinate structure. These findings amount to the first unambiguous solution evidence of the hypervalent apical 3c&#8211;4e interactions in pentacoordinate carbon compounds.

         <title>Probing the Importance of Host Symmetry on Carbohydrate Recognition</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple switch from formic acid to HFIP allows the formation of the C3 symmetrical hemicryptophane cage analogue of the previously reported C1 symmetrical one. The cage with low symmetry exhibits higher binding constants towards carbohydrates than the C3 analogue. The receptors showed remarkable high substrate selectivity and stereoselectivity towards &#945;&#8208;glucoside and &#946;&#8208;galactoside.







Abstract
The design of molecular cages with low symmetry could allow for more specific tuning of their properties and better mimic the unsymmetrical and complex environment of protein pockets. However, the added value of lowering symmetry of molecular receptors has been rarely demonstrated. Herein, C3&#8208; and C1&#8208;symmetrical cages, presenting the same recognition sites, have been synthesized and investigated as hosts for carbohydrate recognition. Structurally related derivatives of glucose, galactose and mannose were found to have greater affinity to the receptor with the lowest symmetry than to their C3&#8208;symmetrical analogue. According to the host cavity modelling, the C1 symmetry receptor exhibits a wider opening than its C3&#8208;symmetrical counterpart, providing easier access and thus promoting guest proximity to binding sites. Moreover, our results show the high stereo&#8208; and substrate selectivity of the C1 symmetry cage with respect to its C3 counterpart in the recognition of sugars.

         <title>Phosphorus&#8211;Boron Multiple Bonding in the &#960; Radical HBP</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The HBP radical was generated via the reaction of laser ablated boron atom with PH3 in a solid neon matrix, which is identified via IR spectroscopy with isotopic substitutions and quantum chemical calculations. The results show that HBP has a 2&#928; electronic ground state with a short B&#8722;P bond. Bonding analysis indicates that besides an electron&#8208;sharing &#963; bond, there are two degenerate &#960; bonding orbitals that are occupied by three electrons, resulting in a bond order of two and half between P and B. This is in sharp contrast to the bonding properties of the isovalent HNB, which was characterized to be a N&#8801;B triply bonded &#963; radical with the unpaired electron locating on the B atom.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhancing the Magnetization Blocking Energy of Biradical&#8208;Metal System by Merging Discrete Complexes into One&#8208;Dimensional Chains</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The reaction of nitronyl nitroxide biradical NITPhMeImbis [5&#8208;(2&#8208;methylimidazole)&#8208;1,3&#8208;bis(1&#8242;&#8208;oxyl&#8208;3&#8242;&#8208;oxido&#8208;4&#8242;,4&#8242;,5&#8242;,5&#8242;&#8208;tetramethyl&#8208;4,5&#8208;hydro&#8208;1H&#8208;imidazol&#8208;2&#8208;yl)&#8208;benzene] with Ln(hfac)3&#183;2H2O and Cu(hfac)2 (hfac = hexafluoroacetylacetonate), led to two series of 2p&#8208;3d&#8208;4f complexes, namely, nona&#8208;spin clusters, [Ln2Cu3(hfac)12(NITPhMeImbis)2] (Ln = Gd 1, Dy 2), or one&#8208;dimensional chains [LnCu2(hfac)7(NITPhMeImbis)] (Ln = Y 3, Dy 4, Tb 5) depending on the temperature of the reaction. All five complexes contain a biradical&#8208;Ln unit in which the biradical chelates the LnIII ion by the means of one aminoxyl (i.e. NO) group of each NIT unit. For the discrete complexes, a Cu(hfac)2 links two biradical&#8208;Ln units via one of the remaining NO groups, while for the chain compounds, the two remaining NO groups of the biradical&#8208;Ln moiety are each coordinated to a Cu(hfac)2 unit to form a 1D coordination polymer. Moreover, in the chains a terminal Cu(hfac)2 unit is coordinated to imidazole&#8208;N atom of the NITPhMeImbis ligand. Spin dynamics investigations evidenced the onset of slow relaxation of the magnetization for 2, whereas 4 and 5 exhibit a typical single&#8208;chain magnet behavior. This highlights the vital role of the 1D spin correlation in the blocking of the magnetization. These results illustrate that from the same basic building blocks, magnetic relaxation can be carefully modulated by structural adjustments.</dc:description>

         <title>Guided Isolation of An Uncommon Cembranoid Orthoester, Sarcotortin A, and Three Skeletal Diverse Terpenoids from the Hainan Soft Coral Sarcophyton tortuosum Based on Molecular Networking Strategy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Applying the emerging molecular networking strategy, an uncommon cembranoid orthoester, sarcotortin A (1), featuring a 3/14/8/5&#8208;fused scaffold, an unusual eunicellane&#8208;type diterpenoid, sarcotorolide A (2), and two new biscembranoids, ximaolides M and N (7 and 8), along with nine known terpenoids 3&#8722;6 and 9&#8722;13 were isolated from the Hainan soft coral Sarcophyton tortuosum. The structure and absolute configuration of all new compounds were established by a combination of spectroscopic data, X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis, and/or quantum chemical computational approaches. The plausible biogenetic relationship among these skeletally different terpenoids was proposed and discussed. In in vitro bioassay, new compound 7 exhibited a remarkable inhibitory activity against protein tyrosine phosphatases 1B (PTP1B) with the IC50 value of 8.06 &#956;M. In addition, compounds 4 and 10 displayed significant inhibitory effects on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)&#8208;induced inflammatory responses in RAW264.7 macrophages cells with the IC50 values of 19.13 and 16.45 &#956;M, respectively. Compound 9 showed interesting&#160;cytotoxicity against H1975, MDA&#8208;MB231, A549, and H1299 cancer cell lines with IC50 values of 31.59, 34.96, 43.87, and 27.93 &#956;M, respectively.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis and Structure&#8208;Property Relationships in Regioisomeric Alternating Borane&#8208;Terthiophene Polymers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Main&#8208;chain boron&#8208;containing &#960;&#8208;conjugated polymers are attractive for organic electronic, sensing, and imaging applications. Alternating terthiophene&#8208;borane polymers were prepared and the effects of regioisomeric attachment of the conjugated linker and variations in the electronic effect of the pendent aryl groups (2,4,6&#8208;tritert&#8208;butylphenyl, Mes*; 2,4,6&#8208;tris(trifluoromethyl)phenyl, FMes) examined. Pd2dba3/P(t&#8208;Bu)3&#8208;catalyzed Stille polymerization of arylbis(2&#8208;thienyl)borane and arylbis(3&#8208;thienylborane) with 2,5&#8208;bis(trimethylstannyl)thiophene at 120 &#186;C gave polymers with appreciable molecular weight but MALDI&#8208;TOF MS analyses showed evidence of unusually prominent homocoupling. These defects could be suppressed by using brominated rather than iodinated monomers, more hindered 2,5&#8208;bis(tri&#8208;n&#8208;butylstannyl)thiophene as comonomer, and Pd2dba3/P(o&#8208;tol)3 as the catalyst at 100 &#186;C. Under these conditions, macrocyclic species with n = 3 &#8211; 10 repeating units formed preferentially according to MALDI&#8208;TOF MS analyses. Photophysical studies revealed a prominent effect of the regiochemistry and the nature of the pendent aryl groups on the absorption and emission, giving rise to orange, yellow&#8208;green, blue&#8208;green, and blue emissive materials respectively. The electronic effects were rationalized through DFT calculations on bis(terthiophene) model systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of a B&#8208;Antigen Hexasaccharide, a B&#8208;Lewis b Heptasaccharide and Glycoconjugates Thereof to Investigate Binding Properties of Helicobacter pylori</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Infecting the stomach of almost 50% of people, Helicobacter pylori is a causative agent of gastritis, peptic ulcers and stomach cancers. Interactions between bacterial membrane&#8208;bound lectin, Blood group Antigen Binding Adhesin (BabA), and human blood group antigens are key in the initiation of infection. Herein, we report the synthesis of a B&#8208;antigen hexasaccharide (B6) and a B&#8208;Lewis b heptasaccharide (BLeb7) and Bovine Serum Albumin glycoconjugates thereof to assess the binding properties and preferences of BabA from different strains. From a previously reported trisaccharide acceptor a versatile key Lacto&#8208;N&#8208;tetraose tetrasaccharide intermediate was synthesized, which allowed us to explore various routes to the final targets, either via initial introduction of fucosyl residues followed by introduction of the B&#8208;determinant or vice versa. The first approach proved unsuccessful, whereas the second afforded the target structures in good yields. Protein conjugation using isothiocyanate methodology allowed us to reach high glycan loadings (up to 23 per protein) to mimic multivalent displays encountered in Nature. Protein glycoconjugate inhibition binding studies were performed with H. pylori strains displaying high or low affinity for Lewis b hexasaccharide structures showing that the binding to the high affinity strain was reduced due to the presence of the B&#8208;determinant in the Bleb7&#8208;conjugates and further reduced by the absence of the Lewis fucose residue in the B6&#8208;conjugate.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>We present a system of two coumarin&#8208;based caging groups &#8211; one absorbing in the blue (400 &#8211; 450 nm) and the other absorbing in the green (480 &#8211; 550 nm) part of the visible spectrum.

         <title>C&#8210;C and C&#8210;N Bond Activation, Lewis&#8208;Base Coordination and One&#8208; and Two&#8208;Electron Oxidation at a Linear Aminoborylene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A cyclic alkyl(amino)carbene (CAAC)&#8208;stabilized dicoordinate aminoborylene is synthesized by the twofold reduction of a [(CAAC)BCl2(TMP)] (TMP = 2,6&#8208;tetramethylpiperidyl) precursor. NMR&#8208;spectroscopic, X&#8208;ray crystallographic and computational analyses confirm the cumulenic nature of the central C=B=N moiety. Irradiation of [(CAAC)B(TMP)] (2) resulted in an intramolecular C&#8208;C bond activation, leading to a doubly&#8208;fused C10BN heterocycle, while the reaction with acetonitrile resulted in an aryl migration from the CAAC to the acetonitrile nitrogen atom, concomitant with tautomerization of the latter to a boron&#8208;bound allylamino ligand. One&#8208;electron oxidation of 2 with CuX (X = Cl, Br) afforded the corresponding amino(halo)boryl radicals, which were characterized by EPR spectroscopy and DFT calculations. Placing 2 under an atmosphere of CO afforded the tricoordinate (CAAC,CO)&#8208;stabilized aminoborylene. Finally, the twofold oxidation of 2 with chalcogens led, in the case of N2O and sulfur, to the splitting of the B&#8210;CCAAC bond and formation of the 2,4&#8208;diamino&#8208;1,3,2,4&#8208;dichalcogenadiboretanes and CAAC&#8208;chalcogen adducts, whereas with selenium a monomeric boraselenone was isolated, which showed some degree of B&#8210;Se multiple bonding.</dc:description>

         <title>Probing peptidylprolyl bond&#160;cis/trans&#160;status using distal&#160;19F NMR reporters</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A method for measuring peptidylprolyl bond cis&#8208;trans conformational status in peptide models is described, using 4&#8208;fluorophenylalanine (4FPhe) as a distal reporter for 19F NMR. The %cis&#8208;Pro population was measured for peptides of the general structure Ac&#8208;X&#8208;Pro&#8208;Z&#8208;Ala&#8208;Ala&#8208;4FPhe (X and Z are proteinogenic amino acids) at pH 7.4, and provided conformational populations consistent with literature values obtained by more complex methods. This approach was applied to probe the prolyl bond status in pentapeptide models of the intrinsically disordered C&#8208;terminal region of &#945;&#8208;synuclein, which mirrored the preferences in the Ac&#8208;X&#8208;Pro&#8208;Z&#8208;Ala&#8208;4FPhe models. Advantageously, the 19F reporter group does not need to be adjacent to or attached to proline to provide quantifiable signals and distal 4&#8208;fluorophenylalanines can be placed so as not to influence prolyl bond conformation. Finally, we demonstrated that the prolyl bond status is not significantly affected by pH when there are ionisable amino acid residues at the carboxyl side of proline, which makes 19F NMR an invaluable tool with which to study proline isomerism at a range of pHs and in different solvents and buffers.</dc:description>

         <title>Spin Crossover Induced by Changing the Identity of the Secondary Metal Ion from PdII&#173; to NiII in a Face&#8208;Centered FeII8MII6 Cubic Cage</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Discrete spin crossover (SCO) heteronuclear cages are a rare class of material which have potential use in next&#8208;generation molecular transport and catalysis. Previous investigations of cubic cage [Fe8Pd6L8]28+ constructed using semi&#8208;rigid metalloligands, found that Fe(II) centers of the cage did not undergo spin transition. In this work, substitution of the secondary metal center at the face of the cage resulted in SCO behavior, evidenced by magnetic susceptibility, M&#246;ssbauer and single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. Structural comparisons of these two cages shed light on the possible interplay of inter&#8208; and intramolecular interactions associated with SCO in the Ni(II) analogue, 1. The distorted octahedral coordination environment, as well as the occupation of the CH3CN in the Ni(II) axial positions of 1, prevented close packing of cages observed in the Pd(II) analogue. This led to offset, distant packing arrangements whereby important areas within the cage underwent dramatic structural changes with the exhibition of SCO.</dc:description>

         <title>Thermoresponse of Odd&#8208;Even Effect in n&#8208;Alkanethiolate Self&#8208;Assembled Monolayers on Gold Substrates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This paper examines thermoresponse of odd&#8208;even effect in self&#8208;assembled monolayers (SAMs) of n&#8208;alkanethiolates (SCn, n = 3 &#8211; 18) formed on template&#8208;stripped gold (AuTS) using macro&#8208; and microscopic analytical techniques, contact angle goniometry (CAG) and vibrational sum frequency generation (VSFG) spectroscopy, respectively. Both CAG and VSFG analyses showed that the odd&#8208;even effect in liquid&#8208;like SAMs (n = 3 &#8211; 9) disappeared upon heating at 50 &#8211; 70 &#176;C, indicating that the heating led to increased structural disorder regardless of odd and even carbon numbers. In contrast, the opposite thermoresponse was observed for odd and even SCn molecules in wax&#8208; and solid&#8208;like SAMs (n = 10 &#8211; 18). Namely, temperature&#8208;dependent orientational change of terminal CH3 relative to the surface normal was opposite for the odd and even molecules, thereby leading to mitigated odd&#8208;even effect. Our work offers important insights into thermoresponse of supramolecular structure in condensed organic matter.</dc:description>

         <title>Mechanistic Insights into the Metal&#8208;Free Deoxygenative Borylation of Ketones and Aldehydes with Bis(Catecholato)Diborane</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The mechanisms of direct deoxygenative borylation of acetone and benzaldehyde with bis(catecholato)diborane (B2cat2) in the solvent DMA (N,N&#8208;dimethylacetamide) are investigated through detailed density functional theory calculations. Our calculations show that the isomer 1,2&#8208;B2cat2in situ generated from 1,1&#8208;B2cat2 induced by DMA is the reactive boron intermediate for the reactions. The addition of the B&#8208;B bond of 1,2&#8208;B2cat2 to the C=O bond of acetone or benzaldehyde via a concerted [2&#963;+2&#960;]&#8208;cycloaddition&#8208;like transition state is the rate&#8208;limiting step for both the triboration reaction of acetone and the monoboration reaction of benzaldehyde. DMA not only acts as the solvent but also promotes the structural isomerization of B2cat2, the deoxygenation of acetone to form the vinyl boronate intermediate and subsequent diboration of vinyl boronate with 1,2&#8208;B2cat2, as well as the protodeboronation of the gem&#8208;diboronate intermediate in the deoxygenative borylation of benzaldehyde. Our computational results can explain the observed experimental facts and provide insight into the roles of the isomeric 1,2&#8208;B2cat2 and the solvent DMA in related reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>In Search of Hosts for Blue OLEDs:&#160;Computational Design and Experimental Validation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Considering the difficulties associated with the traditional &#8216;trial and error&#8217; approach for a complete analysis of a giant molecular space, we took the aid of computational pathway (DFT) in screening a large space search of 780 (12&#215;13&#215;5) molecules to search for a host for the blue emitter. The selection process was completed in three Tiers with the conditions of highest theoretical triplet energy (&gt;2.81 eV), aligned HOMO/LUMO levels w.r.t blue dopant (FIrpic), and position of substituents to meet the optimal requirements as host materials. &#160;Tier 1 screened twelve different imidazole heterocycle derivatives as base space groups which resulted in the selection of 4,5&#8208;diphenyl&#8208;1H&#8208;imidazole. Tier 2 process converged the search to mCN&#8208;CZ having the highest triplet energy and appropriate HOMO/LUMO level relative to FIrpic and ETL. Further, the carbazole of mCN&#8208;CZ was replaced with different aromatic hydrocarbons to find the other best compound in terms of triplet energy and HOMO/LUMO. Tier 3 resulted in another promising candidate (mCN&#8208;FL) as possible host materials. The band alignment with guest predicted mCN&#8208;FL and mCN&#8208;CZ to have optimal device performances compared to CZ&#8208;CZ and the experimentally observed device performance was in accordance with virtual screening results when TAPC was utilized as the hole transporter.

The selection process was completed in three Tiers with the conditions of highest theoretical triplet energy (&amp;gt;2.81 eV), aligned HOMO/LUMO levels w.r.t blue dopant (FIrpic), and position of substituents to meet the optimal requirements as host materials. &#160;Tier 1 screened twelve different imidazole heterocycle derivatives as base space groups which resulted in the selection of 4,5-diphenyl-1H-imidazole. Tier 2 process converged the search to mCN-CZ having the highest triplet energy and appropriate HOMO/LUMO level relative to FIrpic and ETL. Further, the carbazole of mCN-CZ was replaced with different aromatic hydrocarbons to find the other best compound in terms of triplet energy and HOMO/LUMO. Tier 3 resulted in another promising candidate (mCN-FL) as possible host materials. The band alignment with guest predicted mCN-FL and mCN-CZ to have optimal device performances compared to CZ-CZ and the experimentally observed device performance was in accordance with virtual screening results when TAPC was utilized as the hole transporter. The device results of mCN-CZ and mCN-FL were better than the reference host TCTA. &#160;The obtained results thus proved that a virtual screening process will be a useful tool for synthetic chemists in designing task-specific materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Full&#8208;Color Emissive D&#8208;D&#8208;A Carbazole Luminophores: Red to Near&#8208;Infrared Mechanofluorochromism, Aggregation&#8208;Induced Near&#8208;Infrared Emission, and Photodynamic Therapy Application</title>

         <dc:description>The preparation of multi&#8208;functionalized luminophores with full&#8208;color emission based on an identical core skeleton is a significative but challenging research topic. In this work, eight donor&#8208;donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;D&#8208;A) type luminogens based on a central carbazole core bearing a hydrocarbon chain of six carbon atoms are designed by using different kinds of donor and acceptor units on the left and on the right and synthesized in good yields. These D&#8208;D&#8208;A carbazole derivatives display deep&#8208;blue, sky&#8208;blue, blue&#8208;green, green, yellow&#8208;green, yellow, orange and red fluorescence in the solid state, respectively, achieving full&#8208;color emission covering the whole visible light range under UV light illumination. Notably, dicyano&#8208;functionalized triphenylamine&#8208;containing carbazole derivative exhibits rare aggregation&#8208;induced near&#8208;infrared emission and red to near&#8208;infrared mechanofluorochromism with high contrast beyond 100 nm. Furthermore, red emissive luminogen can serve as a potential candidate for cell imaging and photodynamic therapy (PDT). The present work not only provides reference for the construction of full&#8208;color emissive systems but also opens a new avenue to the preparation of multi&#8208;functionalized luminophores capable of simultaneously applying in near&#8208;Infrared mechanical&#8208;force sensors and PDT fields.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Direct and selective C&#8208;H methylation is a powerful tool with which to install methyl groups into organic molecules, and is particularly useful in pharmaceutical chemistry. However, practical methods for such modification of biologically interesting targets have been rarely developed. We here report an iron&#8208;catalyzed C(sp3)&#8208;H methylation reaction of glycine derivatives, peptides and drug&#8208;like molecules in an alcohol in the presence of di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl peroxide. A readily available iron catalyst plays multiple roles in the transformation, which accelerates oxidation of C&#8208;N bonds to C=N double bonds, activates imine intermediates as Lewis acids by bidentate chelation, and at the same time facilitates cleavage of the peroxide to generate methyl radicals. A variety of methylated N&#8208;aryl glycine derivatives and peptides were obtained in good yield and with excellent chemo&#8208; and site&#8208;selectivity. This reaction is scalable, easily managed, and can be completed within 1&#8722;2 h. It features an economic, bio&#8208;friendly catalyst, a green solvent and low toxic reagents, and will provide effective access to precise C&#8208;H modification of biomolecules and nature products.</dc:description>

         <title>Recent Advances on High&#8208;Capacity Sodium Manganese&#8208;Based Oxide Cathodes for Sodium&#8208;ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this paper, the structure and sodium storage mechanism for typical phases of P2, P3, O3, tunnel&#8208;type and spinel&#8208;type NaxMnO2 (NMO) are reviewed. High&#8208;capacity NMOs and strategies to improve capacity are introduced and discussed in detail. The future opportunities and challenges for high&#8208;capacity NMO&#8208;based cathode are prospected.







Abstract
Sodium manganese&#8208;based oxides (NMO) are attracting huge attention as safe and cost&#8208;effective cathode materials for sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs). To date, one of the most important challenges of NMO&#8208;based cathodes is the relatively low capacity. Therefore, it is of great significance to develop high&#8208;capacity NMO&#8208;based cathodes. Great efforts have been made to enhance the reversible capacity of NMO&#8208;based cathodes, achieving considerable progress not only on electrochemical performance, but also the mechanism of massive sodium ion storage. In this paper, the structure and sodium storage mechanism for typical phases of NMO are reviewed, including P2, P3, O3, tunnel&#8208;type, and spinel&#8208;type NMO&#8208;based cathodes. Strategies for high&#8208;capacity NMO&#8208;based cathodes, such as cationic substitution, anion redox activation, etc are introduced in detail. Last but not least, the future opportunities and challenges for high&#8208;capacity NMO&#8208;based cathode are prospected.

         <title>Siderophore&#8208;Linked Ruthenium Catalysts for Targeted Allyl Ester Prodrug Activation within Bacterial Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ganging up on bacteria: Siderophore&#8208;linked ruthenium catalysts were investigated for the activation of an antibacterial prodrug within cells. A fluoroquinolone prodrug was developed and shown to be compatible with the catalysts under micro&#8208;aerobic, biologically relevant conditions. The co&#8208;addition of the catalysts and prodrug to E.&#8197;coli showed a combinative effect, with the dihydroxybenzoic acid&#8208; and azotochelin&#8208;linked catalysts showing most promise for cellular uptake and thus intracellular prodrug activation.







Abstract
Due to rising resistance, new antibacterial strategies are needed, including methods for targeted antibiotic release. As targeting vectors, chelating molecules called siderophores that are released by bacteria to acquire iron have been investigated for conjugation to antibacterials, leading to the clinically approved drug cefiderocol. The use of small&#8208;molecule catalysts for prodrug activation within cells has shown promise in recent years, and here we investigate siderophore&#8208;linked ruthenium catalysts for the activation of antibacterial prodrugs within cells. Moxifloxacin&#8208;based prodrugs were synthesised, and their catalyst&#8208;mediated activation was demonstrated under anaerobic, biologically relevant conditions. In the absence of catalyst, decreased antibacterial activities were observed compared to moxifloxacin versus Escherichia coli K12 (BW25113). A series of siderophore&#8208;linked ruthenium catalysts were investigated for prodrug activation, all of which displayed a combinative antibacterial effect with the prodrug, whereas a representative example displayed little toxicity against mammalian cell lines. By employing complementary bacterial growth assays, conjugates containing siderophore units based on catechol and azotochelin were found to be most promising for intracellular prodrug activation.

         <title>Stabilization of Potent Co(II)&#8208;based Lewis Acids with Weakly Basic Ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tame, but not too much. Complexation of Co(II) with weakly Lewis&#8208;basic ligands yields complexes with calculated Fluoride Ion Affinity in CH2Cl2 solution comparable to SbF5 &#8208; a benchmark for Lewis superacidity. Stabilization with weakly coordinating anion {Al[OC(CF3)3]4}&#8722; allows isolation of such complexes in the form of easily storable salts and their thorough characterization.







Abstract
Pairing cations with weakly coordinating anions (WCAs) often renders them highly Lewis&#8208;acidic and extremely reactive. Although these features are often desirable, excessive reactivity of a cation may lead to decomposition of solvents or WCAs, hindering isolation, storage and practical use of such species. In an attempt to mitigate the problem, we introduce a series of readily available novel Co(II)&#8208;WCA salts with the metal center stabilized by weakly bound ligands: SO2, halogenated acetonitriles and nitromethane with comprehensive characterization including structural, magnetic and spectral (IR) properties as well as thermal stability assessment. The use of these simple yet rarely encountered ligands yields mostly stable and highly Lewis&#8208;acidic complexes, in some cases comparable to SbF5 according to calculated Fluoride Ion Affinities. Highly acidic character of the species is also reflected in observed reactivity. Since the most convenient route towards the Co(II) complexes leads through silver salts, the results are complemented with characterization of a series of novel Ag(I) complexes with abovementioned ligands. Experimental part is backed with DFT calculations which gives insight into the structure and energetics of presented Co(II) complexes and shows that Co(II) center is available for substrates like olefins. This makes them good candidates for catalysts in reactions requiring the presence of Lewis acids.

&lt;p&gt;Pairing cations with weakly coordinating anions (WCAs) often renders them highly Lewis-acidic and extremely reactive. Although these features are often desirable, excessive reactivity of a cation may lead to decomposition of solvents or WCAs, hindering isolation, storage and practical use of such species. In an attempt to mitigate the problem, we introduce a series of readily available novel Co(II)-WCA salts with the metal center stabilized by weakly bound ligands: SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, halogenated acetonitriles and nitromethane with comprehensive characterization including structural, magnetic and spectral (IR) properties as well as thermal stability assessment. The use of these simple yet rarely encountered ligands yields mostly stable and highly Lewis-acidic complexes, in some cases comparable to SbF&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; according to calculated Fluoride Ion Affinities. Highly acidic character of the species is also reflected in observed reactivity. Since the most convenient route towards the Co(II) complexes leads through silver salts, the results are complemented with characterization of a series of novel Ag(I) complexes with abovementioned ligands. Experimental part is backed with DFT calculations which gives insight into the structure and energetics of presented Co(II) complexes and shows that Co(II) center is available for substrates like olefins. This makes them good candidates for catalysts in reactions requiring the presence of Lewis acids.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Towards Luminescent Vanadium(II) Complexes with Slow Magnetic Relaxation and Quantum Coherence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Towards qubits with optical read&#8208;out: Metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge transfer (4MLCT) states account for the color of the vanadium(II) complex isomers cis&#8208;fac&#8208; and mer&#8208;[V(ddpd)2]2+ in spite of the electron&#8208;rich pyridines. 2MLCT states mix with the lowest spin&#8208;flip states, contracting the V&#8722;N bonds in the excited state and preventing ruby&#8208;like spin&#8208;flip emission. Both isomers possess spin&#8208;lattice relaxation times of around 300&#8197;&#956;s and a phase memory time of around 1&#8197;&#956;s at 5&#8197;K.The mer isomer shows slow magnetic relaxation in an external magnetic field. These results pave the way for qubits with optical read&#8208;out based on vanadium(II) complexes.







Abstract
Molecular entities with doublet or triplet ground states find increasing interest as potential molecular quantum bits (qubits). Complexes with higher multiplicity might even function as qudits and serve to encode further quantum bits. Vanadium(II) ions in octahedral ligand fields with quartet ground states and small zero&#8208;field splittings qualify as qubits with optical read out thanks to potentially luminescent spin&#8208;flip states. We identified two V2+ complexes [V(ddpd)2]2+ with the strong field ligand N,N&#8217;&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;N,N&#8217;&#8208;dipyridine&#8208;2&#8208;yl&#8208;pyridine&#8208;2,6&#8208;diamine (ddpd) in two isomeric forms (cis&#8208;fac and mer) as suitable candidates. The energy gaps between the two lowest Kramers doublets amount to 0.2 and 0.5&#8197;cm&#8722;1 allowing pulsed EPR experiments at conventional Q&#8208;band frequencies (35&#8197;GHz). Both isomers possess spin&#8208;lattice relaxation times T1 of around 300&#8197;&#956;s and a phase memory time TM of around 1&#8197;&#956;s at 5&#8197;K. Furthermore, the mer isomer displays slow magnetic relaxation in an applied field of 400&#8197;mT. While the vanadium(III) complexes [V(ddpd)2]3+ are emissive in the near&#8208;IR&#8208;II region, the [V(ddpd)2]2+ complexes are non&#8208;luminescent due to metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge transfer admixture to the spin&#8208;flip states.

         <title>C&#8722;C Coupling through Nitrogen Deletion: Application to Library Synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A reductive amination&#8208;&#8220;nitrogen deletion&#8221; reaction sequence employing (hetero)aromatic aldehydes and (het)arylmethyl amines as the building blocks, and anomeric amide as the reagent was implemented for the parallel synthesis of compound libraries. The method gave access to a chemical space of over half a million compounds relevant to early drug&#8208;discovery initiatives.







Abstract
A protocol for parallel C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp3) coupling of (hetero)aromatic aldehydes and (hetero)arylmethyl amines based on a reductive amination &#8211; &#8220;nitrogen deletion&#8221; reaction sequence has been developed. After preliminary validation experiments, an illustrative compound library of 25&#8197;members was prepared with 76&#8201;% synthetic efficiency. The estimated chemical space accessible by the proposed approach covers almost 600&#8201;000&#8197;representatives that are scarcely represented in current compound databases.

         <title>Coupling Value&#8208;Added Anodic Reactions with Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Coupling value&#8208;added anodic reactions with CO2 electroreduction is a promising strategy to enhance the full&#8208;cell energy efficiency and produce valuable chemicals. In this review, recent advances in the coupled electrolysis of CO2 and potential anodic reactions are summarized. Current challenges and future opportunities for the coupled electrolysis systems are also proposed.







Abstract
Electrocatalytic CO2 reduction features a promising approach to realize carbon neutrality. However, its competitiveness is limited by the sluggish oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at anode, which consumes a large portion of energy. Coupling value&#8208;added anodic reactions with CO2 electroreduction has been emerging as a promising strategy in recent years to enhance the full&#8208;cell energy efficiency and produce valuable chemicals at both cathode and anode of the electrolyzer. This review briefly summarizes recent progresses on the electrocatalytic CO2 reduction, and the economic feasibility of different CO2 electrolysis systems is discussed. Then a comprehensive summary of recent advances in the coupled electrolysis of CO2 and potential value&#8208;added anodic reactions is provided, with special focus on the specific cell designs. Finally, current challenges and future opportunities for the coupled electrolysis systems are proposed, which are targeted to facilitate progress in this field and push the CO2 electrolyzers to a more practical level.

         <title>The Buoy Effect: Surface Enrichment of a Pt Complex in IL Solution by Ligand Design</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ligand design has a strong impact on the surface activity of organometallic complexes. Complementing the ligand system of a Pt complex with fluorinated groups triggers strong enrichment at the IL/vacuum interface in IL solution in a buoy&#8208;like fashion, which was studied by ARXPS.







Abstract
The targeted enrichment of a Pt complex with an ionic liquid (IL)&#8208;derived ligand system in IL solution is demonstrated by using angle&#8208;resolved X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy. When the ligand system is complemented with fluorinated side chains, the complex accumulates strongly at the IL/gas interface, while in an equivalent solution of a complex without these substituents no such effect could be observed. This buoy&#8208;like behavior induces strong population of the complex at the outermost molecular layer close to surface saturation, which was studied over a range from 5 to 30&#8201;%mol. The surface enrichment was found to be most efficient at the lowest concentration, which is particularly favorable for catalytic applications such as supported ionic&#8208;liquid&#8208;phase (SILP) catalysis.

         <title>Palladium(0)&#8208;Catalyzed Anti&#8208;Selective Addition&#8208;Cyclizations of Alkynyl Electrophiles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Palladium(0)/monophosphine complexes catalyze anti&#8208;selective arylative cyclizations of alkynyl electrophiles with organometallic reagents. Remarkably, the regioselectivity in the cyclization of conjugated diyne&#8208;aldehydes can be controlled by a choice of the phosphine ligand, with triphenylphosphine and tricyclohexylphosphine leading to the exclusive formation of 2&#8208;alkylidene&#8208;cyclopentanol and 2&#8208;cyclohexen&#8208;1&#8208;ol derivatives, respectively.







Abstract
Palladium(0)/monophosphine complexes catalyze anti&#8208;selective alkylative, arylative, and alkynylative cyclizations of alkynyl electrophiles with organometallic reagents. The remarkable anti&#8208;selectivity results from novel oxidative addition, that is, the nucleophilic attack of electron&#8208;rich palladium(0) on the electrophile across the alkyne followed by transmetalation and reductive elimination (&#8220;anti&#8208;Wacker&#8221;&#8208;type cyclization). With regard to 5&#8208;alkynals, triphenylphosphine (PPh3)&#8208;ligated palladium(0) catalyzes the cyclization of terminal alkynes and conjugated alkenyl&#8208; or alkynyl&#8208;substituted ones to afford 2&#8208;cyclohexen&#8208;1&#8208;ol and 2&#8208;alkylidene&#8208;cyclopentanol derivatives, respectively. For 6&#8208;alkyl&#8208; or 6&#8208;aryl&#8208;5&#8208;alkynals, the cyclization does not proceed with the palladium/PPh3 catalyst; however, it does proceed with palladium/tricyclohexylphosphine (PCy3), to yield the former products predominantly. Remarkably, the latter catalyst completely switches the regioselectivity in the cyclization of the conjugated diyne&#8208;aldehydes. Notably, palladium/PPh3&#8208;catalyzed cyclizations also proceed with other organometallics or even without them.

Remarkably, the regioselectivity in the cyclization of conjugated diyne-aldehydes can be controlled by a choice of the phosphine ligand, with triphenylphosphine and tricyclohexylphosphine leading to the exclusive formation of 2-alkylidene-cyclopentanol and 2-cyclohexen-1-ol derivatives, respectively.

         <title>Iron&#8208;Catalysed Carbene Transfer to Isocyanides as a Platform for Heterocycle Synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The readily available low&#8208;valent iron complex [Fe(CO)3NO]&#8722; catalyzes the efficient transfer of carbenes to isocyanides. The resulting ketenimines undergo in&#8197;situ cyclocondensation with various bisnucleophiles to give a broad range of medicinally relevant heterocycles. A plausible mechanism for the carbene transfer is proposed based on DFT calculations.







Abstract
An iron&#8208;catalysed carbene transfer reaction of diazo compounds to isocyanides has been developed. The resulting ketenimines are trapped in&#8197;situ with various bisnucleophiles to access a range of densely functionalized heterocycles (pyrimidinones, dihydropyrazolones, 1H&#8208;tetrazoles) in a one&#8208;pot process. The electron&#8208;rich Hieber anion ([Fe(CO)3NO]&#8722;) facilitates efficient catalytic carbene transfer from acceptor&#8208;type &#945;&#8208;diazo carbonyl compounds to isocyanides, providing a cost&#8208;efficient and benign alternative to similar noble metal&#8208;catalysed processes. Based on DFT calculations a plausible reaction mechanism for activation of the &#945;&#8208;diazo carbonyl carbene precursor and ketenimine formation is provided.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Functional Hosts for Polysulfides Conversion and Lithium Plating/Stripping towards Lithium&#8208;Sulfur Full Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Adopting one type of effective host with dual&#8208;functions including both inhibiting polysulfide dissolution and regulating Li plating/stripping, is recently an emerging research highlight in Li&#8722;S battery. This review focuses on such dual&#8208;functional hosts and systematically summarizes the recent research progress and application scenarios and several sound perspectives are also rationally proposed for fundamental research and practical development as guidelines.







Abstract
The practical application of lithium&#8208;sulfur (Li&#8722;S) batteries is greatly hindered by the shuttle effect of dissolved polysulfides in the sulfur cathode and the severe dendritic growth in the lithium anode. Adopting one type of effective host with dual&#8208;functions including both inhibiting polysulfide dissolution and regulating Li plating/stripping, is recently an emerging research highlight in Li&#8722;S battery. This review focuses on such dual&#8208;functional hosts and systematically summarizes the recent research progress and application scenarios. Firstly, this review briefly describes the stubborn issues in Li&#8722;S battery operations and the sophisticated counter measurements over the challenges by dual&#8208;functional behaviors. Then, the latest advances on dual&#8208;functional hosts for both cathode and anode in Li&#8722;S full cells are catalogued as species, including metal chalcogenides, metal carbides, metal nitrides, heterostuctures, and the possible mechanisms during the process. Besides, we also outlined the theoretical calculation tools for the dual&#8208;functional host based on the first principles. Finally, several sound perspectives are also rationally proposed for fundamental research and practical development as guidelines.

         <title>Bimetallic Organic Framework&#8208;Decorated Leaf&#8208;like 2D Nanosheets as Flexible Air Cathode for Rechargeable Zn&#8208;air Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bimetallic self&#8208;supporting electrode with 3D structure was synthesized. The electrode was composed of Cu, Co nanoparticles co&#8208;modified with nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon nanosheet (Cu, Co NPs@NCNSs/CC) on a carbon cloth. The dual&#8208;metal CuCo sites provide efficient ORR and OER electrocatalytic activity by the synergistic effect, thus reducing the energetic barrier.







Abstract
Exploring highly active and robust self&#8208;supporting air electrodes is the key for flexible Zn&#8208;air batteries (FZABs). Therefore, we report a novel 3D structural bimetal&#8208;based self&#8208;supporting electrode consisting of hybrid Cu, Co nanoparticles co&#8208;modified nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon nanosheets on carbon cloth (Cu, Co NPs@NCNSs/CC), which displays excellent electrochemical activity and durability of the oxygen reduction/evolution reaction (ORR/OER). The Cu, Co NPs@NCNSs/CC exhibits a half&#8208;wave potential of 0.863&#8197;V toward ORR and an overpotential of 225&#8197;mV at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 toward OER, owing to its exposed bimetallic sites accelerating the kinetic reaction. In addition, the density functional theory calculation proves that the synergistic effect of CuCo sites favors ORR and OER. Hence, the FZABs based on Cu, Co NPs@NCNSs/CC achieve a larger open&#8208;circuit potential (1.45&#8197;V), higher energy density (130.10&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2), and outstanding cycling stability. All remarkable results demonstrate valuable enlightenment for seeking advanced energy materials of portable and wearable electronics.

         <title>Smart Phototheranostics based on Carbon Nanohorns for Precise Imaging&#8208;Guided Post&#8208;PDT toward Residual Tumor Cells after Initial Phototherapy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Taking advantage of the multi&#8208;stimulus response to exogenous laser and endogenous hyaluronidase, the HA&#8722;Ce6@SWNHs inhibited the growth of residual tumor cells after photodynamic therapy (PDT)/photothermal therapy (PTT) through activatable imaging&#8208;guided PDT. This work provides a rational strategy to develop smart SWNHs&#8208;based phototheranostics for the programmable design of multiple stimulus responses in precision medicine.







Abstract
As promising photonic material, phototheranostics can be activated in the laser irradiation range of tumor with sensitivity and spatiotemporal precision. However, it is difficult to completely eradicate solid tumors due to their irregularity and limited laser irradiation area. Herein, multi&#8208;stimulus responsive HA&#8722;Ce6@SWNHs were constructed with single&#8208;walled carbon nanohorns (SWNHs) and chlorine e6 (Ce6) modified hyaluronic acid (HA) via non&#8208;covalent binding. This SWNHs&#8208;based phototheranostics not only exhibited water dispersion but also could target tumor and be activated by near&#8208;infrared light for photodynamic therapy (PDT) and photothermal therapy (PTT). Additionally, HA&#8722;Ce6@SWNHs could be degraded by hyaluronidase in residual tumor cells, causing HA&#8722;Ce6 to fall off the SWNHs surfaces to restore autofluorescence, thus precisely guiding the programmed photodynamic treatments for residual tumor cells after the initial phototherapy. Thus, this work provides a rationally designed multiple&#8208;stimulus&#8208;response strategy to develop smart SWNHs&#8208;based phototheranostics for precise PDT/PTT and post&#8208;treatment imaging&#8208;guided PDT of residual tumor cells.

         <title>Probing a General Strategy to Break the C&#8722;C Bond of Benzene by a Cyclic (Alkyl)(Amino)Aluminyl Anion</title>

Breaking the benzene ring by cyclic (alkyl)(amino)aluminyl anion could become favourable both kinetically and thermodynamically via a general strategy by introducing electron&#8208;withdrawing groups, demonstrated by density functional theory calculations.







Abstract
The oxidative addition of C&#8722;C bonds in aromatic hydrocarbons by low valent main group species has attracted considerable attention from both theoretical and experimental chemists due to the big challenge in breaking their aromaticity. Herein, a general strategy to break the C&#8722;C bonds in benzene by cyclic (alkyl)(amino)aluminyl anion is demonstrated via density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The results suggest that the activation of the C&#8722;C bond of benzene by this anion is both kinetically and thermodynamically unfavorable whereas introducing electron&#8208;withdrawing groups makes such C&#8722;C bond activation becomes favorable both kinetically and thermodynamically. Such a sharp change on the kinetics and thermodynamics could be rationalized by the frontier molecular orbital theory by decreasing the lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals of the mono&#8208; and disubstituted benzenes. Aromaticity is found to stabilize the transition state for the ring open step. All these findings can help develop the chemistry of small&#8208;molecule activation.

         <title>Differences in the Reactivity of Geminal Si&#8722;O&#8722;P and Al&#8722;O&#8722;P Frustrated Lewis Pairs</title>

Variations in reactivity are observed for the geminal Si&#8722;O&#8722;P and Al&#8722;O&#8722;P Frustrated Lewis Pairs tBu2P&#8722;O&#8722;Si(C2F5)3 and tBu2P&#8722;O&#8722;Al(CH(SiMe3)2)2 towards CO2, nitriles and alkynes regarding regioselectivity, structure and stability of the corresponding adducts.







Abstract
The new oxygen&#8208;bridged geminal Si/P Frustrated Lewis Pair (FLP) tBu2P&#8722;O&#8722;Si(C2F5)3 (2) is able to reversibly bind carbon dioxide at ambient temperature. We compared its reactivity towards benzil, but&#8208;3&#8208;en&#8208;2&#8208;one, nitriles and phenylacetylene to that of the Al/P FLP tBu2P&#8722;O&#8722;AlBis2 (Bis=&#8722;CH(SiMe3)2) (1). When reacted with benzil, both, 1 and 2, form the 1,2&#8208;addition product, but in the Si/P FLP 2, the second carbonyl function additionally binds to the silicon atom. With but&#8208;3&#8208;en&#8208;2&#8208;one 2 forms the 1,2&#8208;addition product, while 1 binds in 1,4&#8208;position. The reaction with acetonitrile yielded an unexpected etheneimine adduct for both systems, while only 1 reacted with tert&#8208;butylnitrile. With benzonitrile and acrylonitrile, 2 showed reversible addition to the C&#8801;N bond and 1 forms a stable adduct with benzonitrile. Solely 1 shows reactivity towards phenylacetylene affording a mixture of the CH deprotonation adduct tBu2P(H)&#8722;O&#8722;AlBis2(CCPh) and the FLP &#8722;C&#8801;C 1,2&#8208;addition adduct under ring formation. All compounds were characterized by multinuclear NMR spectroscopy, XRD and elemental analysis.

         <title>Erythrose and Threose: Carbonyl Migrations, Epimerizations, Aldol, and Oxidative Fragmentation Reactions under Plausible Prebiotic Conditions</title>

Prebiotic sugars: An investigation of carbonyl migration and epimerization, proceeding down the entire carbon chain of tetrose sugars (d&#8208;erythrose and d&#8208;threose) in aqueous media, and ultimately leading to a mixture of d&#8208;erythrulose, rac&#8208;erythrulose and rac&#8208;tetroses arising from the above reactions, is presented in this study.







Abstract
The prebiotic generation of sugars in the context of origins of life studies is of considerable interest. Among the important intramolecular processes of sugars are carbonyl migrations and accompanying epimerizations. Herein we describe the carbonyl migration&#8208;epimerization process occurring down the entire carbon chain of chirally pure d&#8208;tetroses sugars under mild conditions. Employing chirally pure 1&#8208;13C&#8208;erythrose, 4&#8208;13C&#8208;erythrose and 1&#8208;13C&#8208;threose, we (1) identify all the species formed as the carbonyl migrates down the four&#8208;carbon chain and (2) assess the rates associated with the production of each of these species. Competing aldol reactions and oxidative fragmentation processes were also observed. Further observations of self&#8208;condensation of glycolaldehyde mainly yielding 2&#8208;keto&#8208;hexoses (sorbose and tagatose) and tetrulose also provides a basis for understanding the effect of carbonyl migrations on the product distribution in plausible prebiotic scenarios.

         <title>Complexation Preferences of Dynamic Constitutional Frameworks as Adaptive Gene Vectors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dynamic constitutional frameworks: 40 different amphiphilic dynamic constitutional frameworks were prepared in a stepwise covalent self&#8208;assembly process and their DNA complexation preferences revealed marked differences, not only as a function of the number and type of cationic headgroups, but also as a function of the type of DNA, yielding distinct polyplex architectures.







Abstract
The growing applications of therapeutic nucleic acids requires the concomitant development of vectors that are optimized to complex one type of nucleic acid, forming nanoparticles suitable for further trafficking and delivery. While fine&#8208;tuning a vector by molecular engineering to obtain a particular nanoscale organization at the nanoparticle level can be a challenging endeavor, we turned the situation around and instead screened the complexation preferences of dynamic constitutional frameworks toward different types of DNAs. Dynamic constitutional frameworks (DCF) are recently&#8208;identified vectors by our group that can be prepared in a versatile manner through dynamic covalent chemistry. Herein, we designed and synthesized 40 new DCFs that vary in hydrophilic/hydrophobic balance, number of cationic headgroups. The results of DNA complexation obtained through gel electrophoresis and fluorescent displacement assays reveal binding preferences of different DCFs toward different DNAs. The formation of compact spherical architectures with an optimal diameter of 100&#8211;200&#8197;nm suggests that condensation into nanoparticles is more effective for longer PEG chains and PEI groups that induce a better binding performance in the presence of DNA targets.

         <title>Multistimuli&#8208;Responsive Chromism of Vinylene&#8208;Linked Bisflavin Based on the Aggregation and Redox Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bisflavin 1&#8201;a exhibits multi&#8208;stimuli responsive chromism: The fluorescent color of 1&#8201;a can be controlled upon variation of concentration, temperature, solvent, and additives based on the specific aggregation and redox properties arising from highly &#960;&#8208;conjugated platform. The utility is demonstrated by multi&#8208;colored drawing with 1&#8201;a inks with various concentrations.







Abstract
Multistimuli&#8208;responsive chromism was observed for vinylene&#8208;linked bisflavin 1&#8201;a with an extended &#960;&#8208;conjugated platform. The yellow emission of a dilute solution of 1&#8201;a in CHCl3 (0.2&#8197;mM) observed at 298&#8197;K under UV excitation was changed to orange or red emission upon (1) an increase of concentration, (2) a decrease of temperature, and (3) variation of the solvent. This is in contrast to the almost non stimuli&#8208;responsive chromism of the N&#8208;methylated bisflavin analogue 1&#8201;b and monoflavin 2&#8201;a. Mechanistic investigation by 1H NMR analysis under various conditions revealed that the extended &#960;&#8208;conjugation platform and imide moiety of 1&#8201;a generate controllability in the formation of lower&#8208; and higher&#8208;ordered aggregates, which induce variation of the emission color upon change. Bisflavin 1&#8201;a also exhibited redox&#8208;induced chromism, where the orange emission of 1&#8201;a was quenched by the addition of hydrazine under anaerobic conditions, and changed back to the original emission upon subsequent bubbling of O2 gas.

     alt="Multistimuli-Responsive Chromism of Vinylene-Linked Bisflavin Based on the Aggregation and Redox Properties"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Bisflavin 1&#8201;a exhibits multi-stimuli responsive chromism&lt;/b&gt;: The fluorescent color of &lt;b&gt;1&#8201;a&lt;/b&gt; can be controlled upon variation of concentration, temperature, solvent, and additives based on the specific aggregation and redox properties arising from highly &#960;-conjugated platform. The utility is demonstrated by multi-colored drawing with &lt;b&gt;1&#8201;a&lt;/b&gt; inks with various concentrations.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Multistimuli-responsive chromism was observed for vinylene-linked bisflavin &lt;b&gt;1&#8201;a&lt;/b&gt; with an extended &#960;-conjugated platform. The yellow emission of a dilute solution of &lt;b&gt;1&#8201;a&lt;/b&gt; in CHCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (0.2&#8197;mM) observed at 298&#8197;K under UV excitation was changed to orange or red emission upon (1) an increase of concentration, (2) a decrease of temperature, and (3) variation of the solvent. This is in contrast to the almost non stimuli-responsive chromism of the &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-methylated bisflavin analogue &lt;b&gt;1&#8201;b&lt;/b&gt; and monoflavin &lt;b&gt;2&#8201;a&lt;/b&gt;. Mechanistic investigation by &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H NMR analysis under various conditions revealed that the extended &#960;-conjugation platform and imide moiety of &lt;b&gt;1&#8201;a&lt;/b&gt; generate controllability in the formation of lower- and higher-ordered aggregates, which induce variation of the emission color upon change. Bisflavin &lt;b&gt;1&#8201;a&lt;/b&gt; also exhibited redox-induced chromism, where the orange emission of &lt;b&gt;1&#8201;a&lt;/b&gt; was quenched by the addition of hydrazine under anaerobic conditions, and changed back to the original emission upon subsequent bubbling of O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; gas.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Two&#8208;Factor Fluorogenicity of Tetrazine&#8208;Modified Cyanine&#8208;Styryl Dyes for Bioorthogonal Labelling of DNA</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fast and bright! The inverse electron demand Diels&#8208;Alder reactions of the synthetic tetrazine&#8208;modified dyes with bicyclononyne&#8208;modified DNA follow the new concept of the two&#8208;factor fluorescence fluorogenicity which improves the signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio such that washing procedures prior to cell imaging are not needed. The labelling reactions proceed also extremely fast.







Abstract
Two green fluorescent tetrazine&#8208;modified cyanine&#8208;styryl dyes were synthesized for bioorthogonal labelling of DNA by means of the Diels&#8208;Alder reaction with inverse electron demand. With DNA as target biopolymer the fluorescence of these dyes is released by two factors: (i) sterically by their interaction with DNA, and (ii) structurally via the conjugated tetrazine as quencher moiety. As a result, the reaction with bicyclononyne&#8208;modified DNA is significantly accelerated up to &#8805;284,000&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1, and the fluorescence turn&#8208;on is enhanced up to 560 by the two&#8208;factor fluorogenicity. These dyes are cell permeable even in low concentrations and undergo fluorogenic reactions with BCN&#8208;modified DNA in living HeLa cells. The two&#8208;factor fluorescence release improves the signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio such that washing procedures prior to cell imaging are not needed, which is a great advantage for live cell imaging of DNA and RNA in the future.

         <title>Total Synthesis, Absolute Configuration, and Phytotoxic Activity of Foeniculoxin</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Foeniculoxin is a major phytotoxin produced by Italian strains of Phomopsis foeniculi. In this study, the first total synthesis, absolute configuration, and phytotoxic activity are described. Foeniculoxin and hygromycin B caused similar agglomeration of mitochondria around chloroplasts, highlighting this event as a common component in the early stages of plant cell death.







Abstract
Foeniculoxin is a major phytotoxin produced by Italian strains of Phomopsis foeniculi. The first total synthesis is described utilizing the ene reaction and Sonogashira cross&#8208;coupling reaction as key steps. The absolute configuration of the C6&#8217; was determined using chiral separation and an advanced Mosher's method. The phytotoxicity of the synthesized compound was demonstrated via syringe&#8208;based infiltration into Chenopodium album and Arabidopsis thaliana leaves. Synthetic foeniculoxin induced various defects in A.&#8197;thaliana leaf cells before lesion formation, including protein leakage into the cytoplasm from both chloroplasts and mitochondria and mitochondrial rounding and swelling. Furthermore, foeniculoxin and the antibiotic hygromycin B caused similar agglomeration of mitochondria around chloroplasts, highlighting this event as a common component in the early stages of plant cell death.

         <title>Terminal Au&#8722;N and Au&#8722;O Units in Organometallic Frames</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Landscape beyond the oxo&#8208;wall. The terminal auronitrene and auroxyl species [(CF3)3AuN]&#8722; and [(CF3)3AuO]&#8722; are identified as local minima by calculation and experimentally detected by tandem mass spectrometry (MS2) in the gas phase. These open&#8208;shell species defy the standard rules to assign oxidation states since the unpaired electrons are located on the terminal monoatomic ligand (N and O) rather than on the metal.







Abstract
Since gold is located well beyond the oxo wall, chemical species with terminal Au&#8722;N and Au&#8722;O units are extremely rare and limited to low coordination numbers. We report here that these unusual units can be trapped within a suitable organometallic frame. Thus, the terminal auronitrene and auroxyl derivatives [(CF3)3AuN]&#8722; and [(CF3)3AuO]&#8722; were identified as local minima by calculation. These open&#8208;shell, high&#8208;energy ions were experimentally detected by tandem mass spectrometry (MS2): They respectively arise by N2 or NO2 dissociation from the corresponding precursor species [(CF3)3Au(N3)]&#8722; and [(CF3)3Au(ONO2)]&#8722; in the gas phase. Together with the known fluoride derivative [(CF3)3AuF]&#8722;, they form an interesting series of isoleptic and alloelectronic complexes of the highly acidic organogold(iii) moiety (CF3)3Au with singly charged anions X&#8722; of the most electronegative elements (X=F, O, N). Ligand&#8208;field inversion in all these [(CF3)3AuX]&#8722; species results in the localization of unpaired electrons at the N and O atoms.

Synthesis of 4&#8208;organoselanyl oxazinoindolones by the cascade cyclization of N&#8208;(alkoxycarbonyl)&#8208;2&#8208;alkynylindoles using iron(III) chloride and diorganyl diselenides as promoters was developed.







Abstract
A method for the synthesis of 4&#8208;organoselanyl oxazinoindolone derivatives by the cascade cyclization of N&#8208;(alkoxycarbonyl)&#8208;2&#8208;alkynylindoles using iron(III) chloride and diorganyl diselenides as promoters was developed. This protocol was applied to a series of N&#8208;(alkoxycarbonyl)&#8208;2&#8208;alkynylindoles containing different substituents. The reaction conditions also tolerated a variety of diorganyl diselenides having both electron donating and electron withdrawing groups. However, the reaction did not work for diorganyl disulfides and ditellurides. The reaction mechanism seems to proceed via an ionic pathway and the cooperative action between iron(III) chloride and diorganyl diselenides is crucial for successful cyclization. We also found that using the same starting materials, by simply changing the electrophilic source to iodine, led to the formation of 4&#8208;iodo&#8208;oxazinoindolones. The high reactivity of Csp2&#8722;Se and Csp2&#8722;I bonds were tested under cross&#8208;coupling conditions leading to the preparation of a new class of functionalized indole derivatives. In addition, the absorption, emission and electrochemical properties of 4&#8208;organoselanyl oxazinoindolones showed an important relationship with the substituents of the aromatic rings. The advantages of the methodology include the use of electrophilic to promote the cyclization reaction and functionalization of the indole ring, and the electronic properties presented by the prepared compounds can be exploited as probes, analyte detectors and optical materials.

In addition, the absorption, emission and electrochemical properties of 4-organoselanyl oxazinoindolones showed an important relationship with the substituents of the aromatic rings. The advantages of the methodology include the use of electrophilic to promote the cyclization reaction and functionalization of the indole ring, and the electronic properties presented by the prepared compounds can be exploited as probes, analyte detectors and optical materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Bis(amidophenolato)phosphonium: Si&#8722;H Hydride Abstraction and Phosphorus&#8208;Ligand Cooperative Activation of C&#8722;C Multiple Bonds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first donor&#8208;free bis(amidophenolato)phosphonium ions were prepared, and their reactivity was investigated. The compounds possess extreme Lewis acidity up to the strongest monocationic phosphonium&#8208;based fluoride ion acceptor isolable to date. Numerous novel phosphorus&#8208;ligand cooperative reaction modes were observed toward silanes and unsaturated carbon&#8208;carbon bonds.







Abstract
The first bis(amidophenolato)phosphonium salts are prepared and fully characterized. The perfluorinated derivative represents the strongest monocationic phosphorus Lewis acid on the fluoride and hydride ion affinity scale isolable to date. This affinity enables new reactions, such as hydride abstraction from Et3SiH, the first phosphaalkoxylation of an alkyne or a phosphorus catalyzed intramolecular hydroarylation. All properties and reactions are scrutinized by theory and experiment. Substantial &#963;&#8208; and &#960;&#8208;acidity provides the required affinity for substrate activation, while phosphorus&#8208;ligand cooperativity substantially enriches the reactivity portfolio of phosphonium ions.

         <title>Roles that Organic Ammoniums Play on the Surface of the Perovskite Film: A Review</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review article summarizes recent research progresses about the surface treatment of the perovskite film using organic ammonium salts (OASs) for improved performances of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Diverse roles of OASs and their working principles are discussed, and key factors that influence the roles of OASs are proposed to suggest how to further promote efficiency and stability of PSCs.







Abstract
The roles of organic ammonium salts (OASs) which are widely used for the surface treatment of the perovskite film, including formation of 2D perovskites, direct surface passiviation, and other effects, have been reviewed. The influencing factors for these roles of OASs are also discussed, which are important for improved efficiency and stability of perovskite solar cells. More information can be found in the Review article by X. Guo and co&#8208;workers. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202203001)
