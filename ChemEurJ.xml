         <title>Fe&#8208;ZIF8 Coating Cu Foil Derived Carbon as A pH&#8208;Universal Electrocatalyst for Efficient Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 2, January 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A pH&#8208;universal electrocatalyst (Cu/Fe&#8722;NC) with excellent oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) performance is fabricated by pyrolyzing Fe&#8208;ZIF8 coated commercial Cu foil. Profiting from the synergistic effect of electronic distribution (such as Cu&#8594;Fe) and textual structure, the prepared Cu/Fe&#8722;NC exhibits superior half&#8208;cell (positive onset and half&#8208;wave potential) and zinc&#8208;air battery (high discharge voltage and good stability) performances to commercial Pt/C electrodes.







Abstract
It is a great challenge to fabricate highly efficient pH&#8208;universal electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Herein, a facile strategy, which includes coating the Fe modified ZIF8 on Cu foil and in&#8197;situ pyrolysis to evaporate and dope Cu into the MOF derived carbon, is developed to fabricate Fe/Cu&#8722;N co&#8208;doped carbon material (Cu/Fe&#8722;NC). Profiting from the modulated electron distribution and textual properties, well&#8208;designed Cu/Fe&#8722;NC exhibits superior half&#8208;wave potential (E1/2) of 0.923&#8197;V in alkaline, 0.757&#8197;V in neutral and comparable 0.801&#8197;V in acid electrolytes, respectively. Furthermore, the ultralow peroxides yield of ORR demonstrates the high selectivity of Cu/Fe&#8722;NC in full pH scale electrolytes. As expected, the self&#8208;made alkaline and neutral zinc&#8208;air batteries equipped with Cu/Fe&#8722;NC cathode display excellent discharge voltages, outstanding peak power densities and remarkable stability. This work opens a new way to fabricate highly efficient and pH&#8208;universal electrocatalysts for ORR through strategy of Fe/Cu&#8722;N co&#8208;doping, Cu foil evaporation and carbon defects capture.

         <title>Molecular Scissors for Tailor&#8208;Made Modification of Siloxane Scaffolds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 2, January 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A synthetic methodology for a tailored design of functional siloxanes is presented. We show that by incorporating molecular scissors into the siloxane framework, the Si&#8722;O&#8722;Si linkage can easily be cleaved at a desired position and siloxy groups exchanged for one another. The method allows also for a direct one&#8208;step cleavage of chlorosiloxanes and shows broad substrate scope, high variability of functional siloxy units, and excellent selectivity.







Abstract
The controlled design of functional oligosiloxanes is an important topic in current research. A consecutive Si&#8722;O&#8722;Si bond cleavage/formation using siloxanes that are substituted with 1,2&#8208;diaminobenzene derivatives acting as molecular scissors is presented. The method allows to cut at certain positions of a siloxane scaffold forming a cyclic diaminosilane or &#8208;siloxane intermediate and then to introduce new functional siloxy units. The procedure could be extended to a direct one&#8208;step cleavage of chlorooligosiloxanes. Both siloxane formation and cleavage proceed with good to excellent yields, high regioselectivity, and great variability of the siloxy units. Control of the selectivity is achieved by the choice of the amino substituent. Insight into the mechanism was provided by low temperature NMR studies and the isolation of a lithiated intermediate.

         <title>Afterglow Implant for Arterial Embolization and Intraoperative Imaging</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 2, January 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Glowing implant: The study developed a photochemical afterglow implant displaying more than one order of magnitude enhancement in afterglow emission compared with its nanoparticle counterparts. This implant exhibits a long lifetime, the ability to quickly transform into gel, and the ability to eliminate background interference. These features make the implant an excellent candidate for embolic agents and monitoring the effect of embolization.







Abstract
Transcatheter arterial embolization (TAE) is wildly used in clinical treatments. However, the online monitoring of the thrombosis formation is limited due to the challenges of the direct visualization of embolic agents and the real&#8208;time monitoring of dynamic blood flow. Thus, we developed a photochemical afterglow implant with strong afterglow intensity and a long lifetime for embolization and imaging. The liquid pre&#8208;implant injected into the abdominal aorta of mice was rapidly transformed into a hydrogel in&#8197;situ to embolize the blood vessel. The vascular embolism position can be observed by the enhanced afterglow of the fixed implant, and the long lifetime of afterglow can also be used to monitor the effect of embolization. This provides an excellent candidate in bio&#8208;imaging to avoid the autofluorescence interference from continuous light excitation. The study suggests the potential usefulness of the implant as an embolic agent in TAE and artery imaging during a surgical procedure.

Forced into proximity: The 4&#8208;anilino&#8208;5&#8208;fluoroquinazoline scaffold is introduced as a model system for the characterization of the weak NH&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;F hydrogen bonding interaction. A combination of experimental (NMR spectroscopy, X&#8208;ray crystallography) and theoretical (DFT with NBO, NCI) techniques, together with systematic structural variations, provides insights into the nature of this interaction. Selective modulation of the strength of the intramolecular NH&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;F interaction is demonstrated through electronic substituent effects.







Abstract
The 4&#8208;anilino&#8208;6,7&#8208;ethylenedioxy&#8208;5&#8208;fluoroquinazoline scaffold is presented as a novel model system for the characterization of the weak NH&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;F hydrogen bonding (HB) interaction. In this scaffold, the aniline NH proton is forced into close proximity with the nearby fluorine (dH,F&#8764;2.0&#8197;&#197;, &#8736;&#8764;138&#176;), and a through&#8208;space interaction is observed by NMR spectroscopy with couplings (1hJNH,F) of 19&#177;1&#8197;Hz. A combination of experimental (NMR spectroscopy and X&#8208;ray crystallography) and theoretical methods (DFT calculations) were used for the characterization of this weak interaction. In particular, the effects of conformational rigidity and steric compression on coupling were investigated. This scaffold was used for the direct comparison of fluoride with methoxy as HB acceptors, and the susceptibility of the NH&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;F interaction to changes in electron distribution and resonance was probed by preparing a series of molecules with different electron&#8208;donating or &#8208;withdrawing groups in the positions para to the NH and F. The results support the idea that fluorine can act as a weak HB acceptor, and the HB strength can be modulated through additive and linear electronic substituent effects.

         <title>Developing Efficient Small Molecule Acceptors with sp2&#8208;Hybridized Nitrogen at Different Positions by Density Functional Theory Calculations, Molecular Dynamics Simulations and Machine Learning</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 2, January 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multidimensional modelling is performed to envision the structural changes at atomic and molecular level. sp2&#8208;hybridized nitrogen is substituted at the inner or the outmost position of central core, side chain, and terminal group of ITIC for improving the device performance. It is found that nitrogen substitution at end&#8208;capping group is a better strategy to design efficient small molecule acceptors.







Abstract
Chemical structure of small molecule acceptors determines their performance in organic solar cells. Multiscale simulations are necessary to avoid trial&#8208;and&#8208;error based design, ultimately to save time and resources. In current study, the effect of sp2&#8208;hybridized nitrogen substitution at the inner or the outmost position of central core, side chain, and terminal group of small molecule acceptors is investigated using multiscale computational modelling. Quantum chemical analysis is used to study the electronic behavior. Nitrogen substitution at end&#8208;capping has significantly decreased the electron&#8208;reorganization energy. No big change is observed in transfer integral and excited state behavior. However, nitrogen substitution at terminal group position is good way to improve electron&#8208;mobility. Power conversion efficiency (PCE) of newly designed acceptors is predicted using machine learning. Molecular dynamics simulations are also performed to explore the dynamics of acceptor and their blends with PBDB&#8208;T polymer donor. Florgy&#8208;Huggins parameter is calculated to study the mixing of designed small molecule acceptors with PBDB&#8208;T. Radial distribution function has indicated that PBDB&#8208;T has a closer packing with N3 and N4. From all analysis, it is found that nitrogen substitution at end&#8208;capping group is a better strategy to design efficient small molecule acceptors.

         <title>Screening of Minimalist Noncanonical Sites in Duplex DNA and RNA Reveals Context and Motif&#8208;Selective Binding by Fluorogenic Base Probes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 2, January 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A semi&#8208;rational approach to detect low affinity binding to noncanonical pair (NCP) sites in duplex DNA and RNA has been developed. A set of fluorogenic thiazole orange probes bearing abiotic (triazines, pyrimidines) and native RNA bases was screened against dsDNAs and dsRNAs with single abasic, single NCP and tandem NCP sites. Fluorogenic probe engagement revealed novel and selective base interactions with NCPs, setting the stage for a new strategy of targeting noncanonical motifs in RNA.







Abstract
We hypothesize that programmable hybridization to noncanonical nucleic acid motifs may be achieved by macromolecular display of binders to individual noncanonical pairs (NCPs). As each recognition element may individually have weak binding to an NCP, we developed a semi&#8208;rational approach to detect low affinity interactions between selected nitrogenous bases and noncanonical sites in duplex DNA and RNA. A set of fluorogenic probes was synthesized by coupling abiotic (triazines, pyrimidines) and native RNA bases to thiazole orange (TO) dye. This probe library was screened against duplex nucleic acid substrates bearing single abasic, single NCP, and tandem NCP sites. Probe engagement with NCP sites was reported by 100&#8211;1000&#215; fluorescence enhancement over background. Binding is strongly context&#8208;dependent, reflective of both molecular recognition and stability: less stable motifs are more likely to bind a synthetic probe. Further, DNA and RNA substrates exhibit entirely different abasic and single NCP binding profiles. While probe binding in the abasic and single NCP screens was monotonous, much richer binding profiles were observed with the screen of tandem NCP sites in RNA, in part due to increased steric accessibility. In addition to known binding interactions between the triazine melamine (M) and T/U sites, the NCP screens identified new targeting elements for pyrimidine&#8208;rich motifs in single NCPs and 2&#215;2 internal bulges. We anticipate that semi&#8208;rational approaches of this type will lead to programmable noncanonical hybridization strategies at the macromolecular level.

         <title>An H2O2 Molecule Stabilized inside Open&#8208;Cage C60 Derivatives by a Hydroxy Stopper</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 2, January 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydroxylated open&#8208;cage fullerene derivatives enabled the complete isolation of a single H2O2 molecule as the stable peroxosolvate in the solid state. Crystallographic and computational analyses revealed that the arrangement of the hydroxy group and intramolecular hydrogen&#8208;bonding contribute to the kinetic and thermodynamic stabilization of the H2O2 molecule.







Abstract
An H2O2 molecule was isolated inside hydroxylated open&#8208;cage fullerene derivatives by mixing an H2O2 solution with a precursor molecule followed by reduction of one of carbonyl groups on its orifice. Depending on the reduction site, two structural isomers for H2O2@open&#8208;fullerenes were obtained. A high encapsulation ratio of 81&#8201;% was attained at low temperature. The structures of the peroxosolvate complexes thus obtained were studied by 1H NMR spectroscopy, X&#8208;ray analysis, and DFT calculations, showing strong hydrogen bonding between the encapsulated H2O2 and the hydroxy group located at the center of the orifice. This OH group was found to act as a kinetic stopper, and the formation of the hydrogen bonding caused thermodynamic stabilization of the H2O2 molecule, both of which prevent its escape from the cage. One of the peroxosolvates was isolated by HPLC, affording H2O2@open&#8208;fullerene with 100&#8201;% encapsulation ratio, likely due to the intramolecular hydrogen&#8208;bonding interaction.

         <title>Mn12&#8208;Acetate Complexes Studied as Single Molecules</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 2, January 10, 2022. </description>

Mn12O12(RCOO)16 complexes have been the guinea pigs of research on single molecular magnets in the bulk and on surfaces before. Here, novel XMCD studies of isolated ionic samples with same Mn12 scaffolds yield magnetic fingerprints much like bulk samples. Advanced computations of single ion tensors find high anisotropies only on the outer MnIII8 ring. Intrinsic magnetic properties of the Mn12 scaffold seem robust against the environment.







Abstract
The phenomenon of single molecule magnet (SMM) behavior of mixed valent Mn12 coordination clusters of general formula [MnIII8MnIV4O12(RCOO)16(H2O)4] had been exemplified by bulk samples of the archetypal [MnIII8MnIV4O12(CH3COO)16(H2O)4] (4) molecule, and the molecular origin of the observed magnetic behavior has found support from extensive studies on the Mn12 system within crystalline material or on molecules attached to a variety of surfaces. Here we report the magnetic signature of the isolated cationic species [Mn12O12(CH3COO)15(CH3CN)]+ (1) by gas phase X&#8208;ray Magnetic Circular Dichroism (XMCD) spectroscopy, and we find it closely resembling that of the corresponding bulk samples. Furthermore, we report broken symmetry DFT calculations of spin densities and single ion tensors of the isolated, optimized complexes [Mn12O12(CH3COO)15(CH3CN)]+ (1), [Mn12O12(CH3COO)16] (2), [Mn12O12(CH3COO)16(H2O)4] (3), and the complex in bulk geometry [MnIII8MnIV4O12(CH3COO)16(H2O)4] (5). The found magnetic fingerprints &#8211; experiment and theory alike &#8211; are of a remarkable robustness: The MnIV4 core bears almost no magnetic anisotropy while the surrounding MnIII8 ring is highly anisotropic. These signatures are truly intrinsic properties of the Mn12 core scaffold within all of these complexes and largely void of the environment. This likely holds irrespective of bulk packing effects.

&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; ring is highly anisotropic. These signatures are truly intrinsic properties of the Mn&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; core scaffold within all of these complexes and largely void of the environment. This likely holds irrespective of bulk packing effects.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>PTFE/EP Reinforced MOF/SiO2 Composite as a Superior Mechanically Robust Superhydrophobic Agent towards Corrosion Protection, Self&#8208;Cleaning and Anti&#8208;Icing</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 2, January 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The robust, highly durable and multi&#8208;functional superhydrophobic surfaces were fabricated by spray coating technique on various substrates, including metals and non&#8208;metals such as steel 304, steel 306&#8197;L, fiber, cardboard, and glass.







Abstract
Organic resin cross&#8208;linking ZIF&#8208;67/SiO2 superhydrophobic (SHPB) multilayer coating was successfully fabricated on metal substrate. The perfluoro&#8208;octyl&#8208;triethoxy silane (POTS) modified ZIF&#8208;67 and SiO2 coating was applied on primary coated polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) and epoxy resin (EP) via spray coating method. Here, we present that the robust superhydrophobicity can be realized by structuring surfaces at two different length scales, with a nanostructure design to provide water repellence and a microstructure design to provide durability. The as&#8208;fabricated multilayer coating displayed superior water&#8208;repellence (CA=167.4&#176;), chemical robustness (pH=1&#8211;14) and mechanical durability undergoing 120th linear abrasion or 35th rotatory abrasion cycle. By applying different acidic and basic corrosive media and various weathering conditions, it can still maintain superior&#8208;hydrophobicity. To get a better insight of interaction between inhibitor molecules and metal surface, density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed, showing lower energy gap and increased binding energy of ZPS/SiO2/PTFE/EP (ZPS=ZIF&#8208;67+POTS) multilayer coating compared to the ZIF&#8208;67/SiO2/PTFE/EP, thereby supporting the experimental findings. Additionally, such coatings may be useful for applications such as anti&#8208;corrosion, self&#8208;cleaning, and anti&#8208;icing multi&#8208;functionalities.

         <title>Direct Near Infrared Light&#8211;Activatable Phthalocyanine Catalysts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 2, January 10, 2022. </description>

Going in for infra red: The development of phthalocyanine catalysts directly activated by NIR light to transform small organic molecules is described. The choice of solvent is important to promote cross&#8208;dehydrogenative coupling under irradiation with 810&#8197;nm NIR light. A combined experimental and computational mechanistic analysis revealed that this NIR reaction involves a singlet&#8208;oxygen&#8208;mediated mechanism with energy transfer.







Abstract
The high penetration of near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light makes it effective for use in selective reactions under light&#8208;shielded conditions, such as in sealed reactors and deep tissues. Herein, we report the development of phthalocyanine catalysts directly activated by NIR light to transform small organic molecules. The desired photocatalytic properties were achieved in the phthalocyanines by introducing the appropriate peripheral substituents and central metal. These phthalocyanine photocatalysts promote cross&#8208;dehydrogenative&#8208;coupling (CDC) under irradiation with 810&#8197;nm NIR light. The choice of solvent is important, and a mixture of a reaction&#8208;accelerating (pyridine) and &#8208;decelerating (methanol) solvents was particularly effective. Moreover, we demonstrate photoreactions under visible&#8208;light&#8208;shielded conditions through the transmission of NIR light. A combined experimental and computational mechanistic analysis revealed that this NIR reaction does not involve a photoredox&#8208;type mechanism with electron transfer, but instead a singlet&#8208;oxygen&#8208;mediated mechanism with energy transfer.

         <title>Maytansinol Derivatives: Side Reactions as a Chance for New Tubulin Binders</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 2, January 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Exploring the maytansinol acylation reaction, we have discovered previously unreported structural modifications of the maytansine scaffold. This permitted the synthesis and full characterization of a series of novel maytansinoids. A comprehensive biochemical evaluation and X&#8208;ray crystallography structure determinations of tubulin&#8208;maytansinoids identified potent tubulin binders. Moreover, our investigation allowed us to evaluate the impact of the structural modifications described.







Abstract
Maytansinol is a valuable precursor for the preparation of maytansine derivatives (known as maytansinoids). Inspired by the intriguing structure of the macrocycle and the success in targeted cancer therapy of the derivatives, we explored the maytansinol acylation reaction. As a result, we were able to obtain a series of derivatives with novel modifications of the maytansine scaffold. We characterized these molecules by docking studies, by a comprehensive biochemical evaluation, and by determination of their crystal structures in complex with tubulin. The results shed further light on the intriguing chemical behavior of maytansinoids and confirm the relevance of this peculiar scaffold in the scenario of tubulin binders.

Nickel&#8208;catalyzed reductive cross&#8208;coupling of allylic difluorides with aryl iodides was achieved via allylic C&#8722;F bond activation. Based on this protocol, a series of &#947;&#8208;arylated monofluoroalkenes were synthesized in moderate to high yields. Mechanistic studies suggest that the C&#8722;I bonds of the aryl iodides and the C&#8722;F bonds of the allylic difluorides were cleaved via oxidative addition and &#946;&#8208;fluorine elimination, respectively.

New [&#8722;2, &#8722;1, 0] charged&#8208;ligand based iridium(III) complexes with simple chemical structures, good thermal stability and easy sublimability were designed and synthesized for the construction of novel phosphorescent iridium(III) complex materials. Deep red/near&#8208;infrared emissions were observed both in their photoluminescence and electroluminescence. This work provides a new idea for the construction of new type phosphorescent Ir(III) emitters with different charged ligands, thus offering new opportunities and challenges for their optoelectronic applications.







Abstract
A series of [&#8722;2, &#8722;1, 0] charged&#8208;ligand based iridium(III) complexes of [Ir(bph)(bpy)(acac)] (1), [Ir(bph)(2MeO&#8208;bpy)(acac)] (2), [Ir(bph)(2CF3&#8208;bpy)(acac)] (3), [Ir(bph)(bpy)(2tBu&#8208;acac)] (4) and [Ir(bph)(bpy)(CF3&#8208;acac)] (5), which using biphenyl as dianionic ligand [&#8722;2], acetylacetone (or its derivatives) as monoanionic ligand [&#8722;1], and 2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine (or its derivatives) as neutral ligand [0] were designed and synthesized. The chemical structures were well characterized. All of the ligands have simple chemical structures, thus further making the complexes have excellent thermal stability and are easy to sublimate and purify. Phosphorescent characteristics with short emission lifetime were demonstrated for these emitters. Notably, all of the complexes exhibit remarkable deep red/near infrared emission, which is quite different from the reported [&#8722;1, &#8722;1, &#8722;1] charged&#8208;ligand based iridium(III) complexes. The photophysical properties of these complexes are regularly improved by introducing electron&#8208;donating or &#8208;withdrawing groups into [&#8722;1] or [0] charged&#8208;ligand. The related organic light&#8208;emitting diodes exhibited deep red/near infrared emission with acceptable external quantum efficiency and low turn&#8208;on voltage (&lt;2.6&#8197;V). This work provides a new idea for the construction of new type phosphorescent iridium(III) emitters with different valence states of [&#8722;2, &#8722;1, 0] charged ligands, thus offering new opportunities and challenges for their optoelectronic applications.

         <title>A Series of Polyoxometalate&#8208;Viologen Photochromic Materials for UV Probing, Amine Detecting and Inkless and Erasable Printing</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 2, January 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three polyoxometalate&#8208;viologen Compounds&#8197;were designed and constructed by using two viologen ligands. Compounds&#8197;1&#8211;3 show excellent photochromic features with fast photoresponse under irradiation of ultraviolet light with different degrees of color changes. These Compounds&#8197;exhibit amine detecting and inkless and erasable printing properties, and they can be prepared into a mixed matrix film as a good UV detector.







Abstract
In this work, by using two kinds of viologen ligands three POM&#8208;based Compounds&#8197;were obtained under hydrothermal conditions, namely [AgI(bmypd)0.5(&#946;&#8208;Mo8O26)0.5] (1) (bmypd&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2Cl=1,1&#8242;&#8208;[Biphenyl&#8208;4,4&#8242;&#8208;bis(methylene)]bis(4,4&#8242;&#8208;bipyridyinium)dichloride), [AgI2(bypy)4(HSiW12O40)2]&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;14H2O (2) and [AgI(bypy)(&#947;&#8208;Mo8O26)0.5] (3) (bypy&#8901;Cl=1&#8208;Benzyl&#8208;4,4&#8242;&#8208;bipyridyinium chloride). The structures were characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT&#8211;IR), Powder X&#8208;ray diffraction (PXRD), X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. Compounds&#8197;1&#8211;3 show excellent photochromic ability with fast photoresponse under the irradiation of ultraviolet light with different degrees of color changes. So compounds&#8197;1&#8211;3 can be used as visible ultraviolet detectors. Compounds&#8197;1&#8211;3 also possess photoluminescence properties with fast and excellent fluorescence quenching effect. Compounds&#8197;1&#8211;3 also can be used as inkless and erasable printing materials with suspensions of 1&#8211;3 applied to filter paper. Compounds&#8197;1&#8211;3 can also produce color changes in amine vapor environment, especially in an NH3 atmosphere. Compounds&#8197;1&#8211;3 can be used as organic amine detectors.

         <title>Dinuclear Zinc Catalyzed Enantioselective Dearomatization [3+2] Annulation of 2&#8208;Nitrobenzofurans and 2&#8208;Nitrobenzothiophenes</title>

         <dc:description>
Enantioselective dearomatization [3+2] annulation of 2&#8208;nitrobenzofurans and 2&#8208;nitrobenzothiophenes is realized by a dinuclear zinc catalyst, giving structurally diverse polycyclic pyrrolidinyl spirooxindoles with high enantioselectivity. This work represents the first application of a dinuclear zinc catalyst in an asymmetric dearomatization reaction.







Abstract
The application of dinuclear zinc catalysts in a dearomatization reaction has been developed. Catalytic asymmetric dearomatization [3+2] annulations of 2&#8208;nitrobenzofurans or 2&#8208;nitrobenzothiophenes with CF3&#8208;containing N&#8208;unprotected isatin&#8208;derived azomethine ylides catalyzed by dinuclear zinc catalysts are realized with excellent diastereomer ratios (dr) of &gt;20&#8201;:&#8201;1 and enantiomeric excess (ee) of up to 99&#8201;%. This protocol provides a practical, straightforward access to structurally diverse pyrrolidinyl spirooxindoles containing a 2,3&#8208;fused&#8208;dihydrobenzofuran (or dihydrobenzothiphene) moiety, and four contiguous stereocenters. Reactions can be performed on a gram scale. The absolute configuration of products is confirmed by X&#8208;ray single crystal structure analysis, and a possible mechanism is proposed.

The synthesis and properties of indeno[1,2,3,4&#8208;pqra]perylene are described. Indenoperylene is a medium&#8208;sized aromatic hydrocarbon with the composition C24H12 that is isomeric to coronene. Nevertheless, its absorption covers the entire visible region owing to its small HOMO&#8208;LUMO gap. Furthermore, indenoperylene exhibits high stability despite the absence of peripheral substituents.







Abstract
We report the synthesis and properties of indeno[1,2,3,4&#8208;pqra]perylene, which was prepared by the fusion of one anthracene unit with one naphthalene unit via three carbon&#8208;carbon bonds. The synthetic route through two&#8208;fold C&#8722;H arylation enabled not only the synthesis of unsubstituted indenoperylene, but also rapid access to its arylated derivatives on the gram scale. Indenoperylene is a medium&#8208;sized aromatic hydrocarbon with the composition C24H12 that is isomeric to coronene. Nevertheless, its absorption covers the entire visible region owing to its small HOMO&#8208;LUMO gap. Furthermore, indenoperylene exhibits high stability despite the absence of peripheral substituents. We propose that the unique electronic structure of indenoperylene originates from the coexistence of an electron&#8208;withdrawing subunit (benzoaceanthrylene) and an electron&#8208;donating subunit (perylene). The electronic properties of indenoperylene were modulated via post&#8208;functionalization through regioselective bromination. The current research demonstrates that indenoperylene is a promising candidate as a main skeleton for near&#8208;infrared&#8208;responsive and redox&#8208;active materials.

         <title>Monitoring the Thiol/Thiophenol Molecule&#8208;Modulated Plasmon&#8208;Mediated Silver Oxidation with Dark&#8208;Field Optical Microscopy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 2, January 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thiol/thiophenol molecules can modulate the plasmon&#8208;mediated silver oxidation. Compared with molecules having electron donating groups, molecules having electron accepting groups accelerate the silver oxidation dramatically. The modulation of silver oxidation is attributed to the modulation of the charge separation between the Ag NPs and the adsorbed thiol or thiophenol molecules.







Abstract
Surface plasmon can trigger or accelerate many photochemical reactions, especially useful in energy and environmental industries. Recently, molecular adsorption has proven effective in modulating plasmon&#8208;mediated photochemistry, however the realized chemical reactions are limited and the underlying mechanism is still unclear. Herein, by using in&#8197;situ dark&#8208;field optical microscopy, the plasmon&#8208;mediated oxidative etching of silver nanoparticles (Ag NPs), a typical hot&#8208;hole&#8208;driven reaction, is monitored continuously and quantitatively. The presence of thiol or thiophenol molecules is found essential in the silver oxidation. In addition, the rate of silver oxidation is modulated by the choice of different thiol or thiophenol molecules. Compared with the molecules having electron donating groups, the ones having electron accepting groups accelerate the silver oxidation dramatically. The thiol/thiophenol modulation is attributed to the modulation of the charge separation between the Ag NPs and the adsorbed thiol or thiophenol molecules. This work demonstrates the great potential of molecular adsorption in modulating the plasmon&#8208;mediated photochemistry, which will pave a new way for developing highly efficient plasmonic photocatalysts.

         <title>Frontispiece: Insights on Luminescent Micro&#8208; and Nanospheres of Infinite Coordination Polymers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 2, January 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Infinite coordination polymers (ICPs) are compounds similar to metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs), but with distinct particle morphologies. Micro&#8208; or nanospheres of ICPs are the most reported, which are frequently synthesized by using rare&#8208;earth ions. This article covers the growth mechanisms of spherical ICP particles and the main applications related to luminescent properties, including chemical sensing, light emission, bioimaging and templating. Read more in the Minireview by R. C. G. Frem, G. Arroyos et&#8197;al. on page&#8197;5&#8197;ff.

         <title>Frontispiece: Metal Centers as Nucleophiles: Oxymoron of Halogen Bond&#8208;Involving Crystal Engineering</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 2, January 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
This minireview highlights recent examples of nucleophilicity of metal centers toward the noncovalent interaction &#8211; even today this property is likely to be perceived as an oxymoron by most chemists. The unconventional halogen bonding (HaB) involves positively charged metal centers, that provide their filled d&#8208;orbitals for HaB, and thus behave as nucleophilic components toward the noncovalent interaction. For more information, see the Review by Ivanov et&#8197;al. on page&#8197;24&#8208;&#8208;35.

         <title>Cover Feature: Maytansinol Derivatives: Side Reactions as a Chance for New Tubulin Binders (Chem. Eur. J. 2/2022)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 2, January 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The interdisciplinary character of the Horizon2020&#8208;MSCA&#8208;EJD TubInTrain project allowed a challenging study of the peculiarity of maytansinoids as tubulin binders. The enthusiasm of PhD students proved fundamental for productively merging synthesis, biological evaluation, X&#8208;ray crystallography and docking studies. The good agreement of computational and experimental sheds further light on the intriguing chemical behavior of maytansinoids and provides a solid foundation for the future design, synthesis and analysis of next&#8208;generation maytansinoids. More information can be found in the Full Paper by D. Passarella et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202103520).

         <dc:description>
Selective photoreaction under shielded conditions. We have developed near&#8208;infrared light&#8208;activatable phthalocyanine catalysts. In this image, the colors of the cars show the kind of light. The visible wavelengths (rainbow colors) are blocked (traffic cones); only NIR light (the gray vehicle) can pass to interact with the phthalocyanine catalyst. After this photoreaction, singlet oxygen (as 1O2) and product are generated. More information can be found in the Full Paper by T. Furuyama, H. Nakai, et&#8197;al.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Selective photoreaction under shielded conditions&lt;/b&gt;. We have developed near-infrared light-activatable phthalocyanine catalysts. In this image, the colors of the cars show the kind of light. The visible wavelengths (rainbow colors) are blocked (traffic cones); only NIR light (the gray vehicle) can pass to interact with the phthalocyanine catalyst. After this photoreaction, singlet oxygen (as &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and product are generated. More information can be found in the Full Paper by T. Furuyama, H.

         <title>Metal Centers as Nucleophiles: Oxymoron of Halogen Bond&#8208;Involving Crystal Engineering</title>

Metal centers provide their filled d&#8208;orbitals for halogen bonding, and behave as nucleophilic components toward the noncovalent interaction.







Abstract
This review highlights recent studies discovering unconventional halogen bonding (HaB) that involves positively charged metal centers. These centers provide their filled d&#8208;orbitals for HaB, and thus behave as nucleophilic components toward the noncovalent interaction. This role of some electron&#8208;rich transition metal centers can be considered an oxymoron in the sense that the metal is, in most cases, formally cationic; consequently, its electron donor function is unexpected. The importance of Ha&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;d&#8208;[M] (Ha=halogen; M is Group 9 (Rh, Ir), 10 (Ni, Pd, Pt), or 11 (Cu, Au)) interactions in crystal engineering is emphasized by showing remarkable examples (reported and uncovered by our processing of the Cambridge Structural Database), where this Ha&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;d&#8208;[M] directional interaction guides the formation of solid supramolecular assemblies of different dimensionalities.

         <title>Insights on Luminescent Micro&#8208; and Nanospheres of Infinite Coordination Polymers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 2, January 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The formation and growth mechanisms of spherical particles of infinite coordination polymers (ICPs) is discussed. Main reported applications for micro&#8208; and nanospheres of ICPs exhibiting luminescent behavior are presented, including chemical sensing, light emission, bioimaging and templating by using topotactic transformations. Additional insights on the challenges for future applications are also given.







Abstract
Coordination polymers have been extensively studied in recent years. Some of these materials can exhibit several properties such as permanent porosity, high surface area, thermostability and light emission, as well as open sites for chemical functionalization. Concerning the fact that this kind of compounds are usually solids, the size and morphology of the particles are important parameters when an application is desired. Inside this context, there is a subclass of coordination polymers, named infinite coordination polymers (ICPs), which auto&#8208;organize as micro&#8208; or nanoparticles with low crystallinity. Specifically, the particles exhibiting spherical shapes and reduced sizes can be better dispersed, enter cells much easier than bulk crystals and be converted to inorganic materials by topotactic transformation. Luminescent ICPs, in particular, can find applications in several areas, such as sensing probes, light&#8208;emitting devices and bioimaging. In this review, we present the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art of ICP&#8208;based spherical particles, including the growth mechanisms, some applications for luminescent ICPs and the challenges to overcome in future commercial usage of these materials.

1,7&#8208;Di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;substituted aza&#8208;BODIPYs (tBu&#8208;azaBDPs) were successfully prepared for the first time. Although the low&#8208;barrier rotation of the distal &#8208;tBu groups in tBu&#8208;azaBDPs results in low quantum yield, photothermal conversion efficiency and single oxygen generation ability of tBu&#8208;azaBDPs are effective than those of Ph&#8208;azaBDP, which is highly desirable for a photothermal&#8208;photodynamic therapy agent.







Abstract
1,7&#8208;Di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;substituted aza&#8208;BODIPYs (tBu&#8208;azaBDP) were successfully obtained for the first time. The structures of tBu&#8208;azaBDP and Ph&#8208;azaBDP were confirmed by X&#8208;ray crystal analysis, and tBu&#8208;azaBDP 2 is more twisted than Ph&#8208;azaBDP 5. tBu&#8208;azaBDPs have significant photo&#8208;stability and enhanced water solubility. tBu&#8208;azaBDPs possess excellent optical properties, such as high molar extinction coefficients, broad full width half maxima, and large Stokes shifts, which is comparable to those of the parent dye Ph&#8208;azaBDP. Although the low&#8208;barrier rotation of the distal &#8208;tBu groups in tBu&#8208;azaBDPs results in low quantum yield, photothermal conversion efficiency and singlet oxygen generation ability of tBu&#8208;azaBDPs are more effective than those of Ph&#8208;azaBDP, which is highly desirable for a photothermal&#8208;photodynamic therapy agent.

         <title>Electroreductive Cross&#8208;Coupling of Trifluoromethyl Alkenes and Redox Active Esters for the Synthesis of Gem&#8208;Difluoroalkenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 2, January 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electroreductive decarboxylative/defluorinative cross&#8208;coupling between redox&#8208;active esters and &#945;&#8208;trifluoromethyl styrenes enabled the access to a wide range of gem&#8208;difluoroalkenes. The transformation can be conducted efficiently under simple metal&#8208;free reaction conditions and features a broad scope with high yields.







Abstract
An electroreductive access to gem&#8208;difluoroalkenes has been developed through the decarboxylative/defluorinative coupling of N&#8208;hydroxyphtalimides esters and &#945;&#8208;trifluoromethyl alkenes. The electrolysis is performed under very simple reaction conditions in an undivided cell using cheap carbon graphite electrodes. This metal&#8208;free transformation features broad scope with good to excellent yields. Tertiary, secondary as well as primary alkyl radicals could be easily introduced. &#945;&#8208;aminoacids L&#8208;aspartic and L&#8208;glutamic acid&#8208;derived redox active esters were good reactive partners furnishing potentially relevant gem&#8208;difluoroalkenes. In addition, it has been demonstrated that our electrosynthetic approach toward the synthesis of gem&#8208;difluoroalkenes could use an easily prepared Kratitsky salt as alkyl radical precursor via a deaminative/defluorinative carbofunctionalization of trifluoromethylstyrene.

         <title>Halogen Bonding Adsorbent Pyridine N&#8208;oxides for Iodine Capture in Water</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 2, January 10, 2022. </description>

Nonporous crystal materials from one&#8208;step synthesized single component pyridine N&#8208;oxides (2&#8208;((naphthalen&#8208;2&#8208;ylmethyl)thio)pyridine 1&#8208;oxide: NTPO) for iodine capture in water driven by halogen bond between oxygen atom of NTPO and iodine molecule, along with a single&#8208;crystal to single&#8208;crystal transformation process of crystal NTPO to binary cocrystals combined with NTPO and iodine. Besides, the nonporous material NTPO also have great potential in the adsorption of iodine in vapor state and organic solvents (cyclohexane and n&#8208;hexane).







Abstract
Rapid capture of 129I with high volatility and toxicity in the environment has attracted much attention. Herein we reported a firstly synthesized nonporous material: pyridine N&#8208;oxides (NTPO and ATPO) as iodine adsorbent. Both of NTPO and ATPO exhibit remarkable performance on the adsorption of iodine in aqueous solution, vapor state and organic solvents. Upon the capture of iodine, pyridine N&#8208;oxides were transformed to binary cocrystals combined with the pyridine N&#8208;oxides and iodine which is driven by halogen bond between iodine and oxygen atoms. Moreover, pyridine N&#8208;oxides shows high chemical, thermal and moisture stability.

         <title>Comprehensive Structural Analysis of the Bitter Components in Beer by the HPLC&#8208;Assisted Crystalline Sponge Method</title>

Beer taste of your favorite is blendable! Comprehensive identification of derivatives from trans&#8208;iso&#8208;&#945;&#8208;acid, derived from one of the most abundant secondary metabolites in hops, was achieved by the HPLC&#8208;assisted crystalline sponge method. Thirteen components, including previously unknown eight, were fully characterized, promising the development of new, advanced brewing technology for controlling the bitter components of beer.







Abstract
Trans&#8208;iso&#8208;&#945;&#8208;acid is one of the main contributors to the bitter taste of fresh beer and is known to transform into various derivatives during beer aging. However, structural characterization of the derivatives has been a challenging task because of the formation of too many components. Herein, we report that most of the transformation products of trans&#8208;iso&#8208;&#945;&#8208;acid, isolated in this study in only small quantities by HPLC, can be structurally analyzed with the crystalline sponge method. Thirteen compounds, including eight that were previously unreported, have been successfully isolated and analyzed with complete assignment of their absolute configuration. This provides an improved understanding of the chemical transformations that occur during beer aging.

         <title>Carrier Protein&#8208;Free Enzymatic Biaryl Coupling in Arylomycin A2 Assembly and Structure of the Cytochrome P450 AryC**
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 2, January 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The arylomycins are antibiotic natural products that inhibit bacterial signal peptidase. Within this work, the biaryl&#8208;bond forming cytochrome P450 of arylomycin biosynthesis, AryC, is structurally and functionally characterized. Convergent preparation of the linear lipopeptide precursor followed by enzymatic installation of the biaryl structural element by AryC results in a streamlined chemo&#8208;enzymatic access to arylomycin A2. Unlike oxidative cross&#8208;coupling enzymes in glycopeptide biosynthesis, AryC accepts carrier protein&#8208;free peptide substrates, a tremendous advantage for future biocatalytic applications in complex peptide synthesis.







Abstract
The arylomycin antibiotics are potent inhibitors of bacterial type I signal peptidase. These lipohexapeptides contain a biaryl structural motif reminiscent of glycopeptide antibiotics. We herein describe the functional and structural evaluation of AryC, the cytochrome P450 performing biaryl coupling in biosynthetic arylomycin assembly. Unlike its enzymatic counterparts in glycopeptide biosynthesis, AryC converts free substrates without the requirement of any protein interaction partner, likely enabled by a strongly hydrophobic cavity at the surface of AryC pointing to the substrate tunnel. This activity enables chemo&#8208;enzymatic assembly of arylomycin A2 that combines the advantages of liquid&#8208; and solid&#8208;phase peptide synthesis with late&#8208;stage enzymatic cross&#8208;coupling. The reactivity of AryC is unprecedented in cytochrome P450&#8208;mediated biaryl construction in non&#8208;ribosomal peptides, in which peptidyl carrier protein (PCP)&#8208;tethering so far was shown crucial both in&#8197;vivo and in&#8197;vitro.

Masked amino systems: The design of a molecular entity for the auto&#8208;immolative release of fluorophores and its application for the synthesis of two turn&#8208;on fluorophore probes both responding to physiological conditions of H2S is reported (see scheme).







Abstract
Masked trimethyl lock (TML) systems as molecular moieties enabling the bioresponsive release of compounds or dyes in a controlled temporal and spatial manner have been widely applied for the development of drug conjugates, prodrugs or molecular imaging tools. Herein, we report the development of a novel amino trimethyl lock (H2N&#8208;TML) system as an auto&#8208;immolative molecular entity for the release of fluorophores. We designed Cou&#8208;TML&#8208;N3 and MURh&#8208;TML&#8208;N3, two azide&#8208;masked turn&#8208;on fluorophores. The latter was demonstrated to selectively release fluorescent MURh in the presence of physiological concentrations of the redox&#8208;signaling molecule H2S in&#8197;vitro and was successfully applied to image H2S in human cells

         <title>Structural and Electronic Properties of Boranes Containing Boron&#8208;Chalcogen Multiple Bonds and Stabilized by&#160;Amido Imidazoline&#8208;2&#8208;imine Ligands</title>

         <dc:description>The stabilization of elusive monomeric species containing multiple boron&#8208;chalcogen bonds has motivated the investigation of sophisticated ligand systems in the past few years. Recently, a series of neutral, Lewis acid&#8208;free chalcogenboranes were prepared by incorporation of an amido imidazoline&#8208;2&#8208;imine as the supporting ligand (  Frank et al., Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 2021, 60, 4633  ), resulting in well&#8208;defined molecular entities with pronounced multiple bond character, B=X (X = O, S, Se, Te). In view of the potential use of N&#8208;heterocyclic boranes (NHB=X) as ligands in catalysis and fine chemistry, we evaluated in this work the bonding properties of the new B=X compounds based on a&#160;&#960;&#8208;backdonation model. The electronic properties of systems in question were modulated via systematic modifications of the NHB ring with respect to ligand variation, saturation, size, and heteroatom substitutions. Investigations on the B=X bond length and order, calculated by means of density functional theory methods, reveal enhanced B=X bonding properties for NHB rings with high electron delocalization in the NHB ring and bearing electron&#8208;withdrawing substituents; a fact that was also confirmed by computational assessment of electron interactions of the B=X species with a dicarbonyl manganese complex. We expect that the analysis will contribute to the rational optimization of existing ligands as well as the development of new moieties, which would further allow for exploration of new boron chemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>Add a Pinch of Tetrel: The Transformation of a Centrosymmetric Metal into a Nonsymmorphic and Chiral Semiconductor</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The substitution of a small amount of silicon to the known composition of RhP3 (centrosymmetric space group Im
) yields novel RhSi0.3P2.7 (space group P212121) which has a noncentrosymmetric, nonsymmorphic, and chiral crystal structure. We hypothesize that a combination of M&#8722;Tt and M&#8722;Pn bonding favors noncentrosymmetric structures. Therefore, by adding a &#8220;pinch&#8221; of tetrel to known centrosymmetric metal pnictide compositions, new noncentrosymmetric structures may be realized.







Abstract
Centrosymmetric skutterudite RhP3 was converted to a nonsymmorphic and chiral compound RhSi0.3P2.7 (space group P212121) by means of partial replacement of Si for P. The structure, determined by a combination of X&#8208;ray crystallography and solid state 31P&#8197;NMR, exhibits branched polyanionic P/Si chains that are unique among metal phosphides. A driving force to stabilize the locally noncentrosymmetric cis&#8208;RhSi2P4 and fac&#8208;RhSi3P3 fragments is &#960;&#8208;electron back&#8208;donation between the Rh t2g&#8208;type orbitals and the unoccupied antibonding Si/P orbitals, which is more effective for Si than for P. In situ studies and total energy calculations revealed the metastable nature of RhSi0.3P2.7. Electronic structure calculations predicted centrosymmetric cubic RhP3 to be metallic which was confirmed by transport properties measurements. In contrast, the electronic structure for chiral orthorhombic RhSi0.3P2.7 contained a bandgap, and this compound was shown to be a narrow gap semiconductor.

         <title>Spin States, Bonding and Magnetism in Mixed&#8208;Valence Iron(0)&#8208;Iron(II) Complexes**
</title>

         <dc:description>
The nature of metal&#8208;metal bonding between two different kinds of metal sites is essential for understanding these &#8220;xenophilic&#8221; complexes. We used M&#246;ssbauer spectroscopy, SQUID magnetometry and computational analysis on a pair of related diiron complexes; they indicated that the bond order is roughly one&#8208;half. The best electronic structure description is LFeII&#8722;Fe0(CO)2Cp, in which the Fe(CO)2Cp is low&#8208;spin iron(0) and acts as an X&#8208;type ligand toward the high&#8208;spin iron(II) of the LFe fragment.







Abstract
&#8220;Xenophilic&#8221; complexes offer metal&#8208;metal bonds between disparate metal sites, but the nature of the metal&#8208;metal bonding is often unclear. Here, we describe two novel complexes with unsupported Fe&#8722;Fe bonds, LxFe&#8722;Fp (LX = &#946;&#8208;aldiminate or &#946;&#8208;diketiminate; Fp = Fe(CO)2Cp), that offer insight into Fe&#8722;Fe bonding. M&#246;ssbauer, magnetism, and DFT analysis indicate that the most accurate electronic structure description is LFeII&#8592;Fe0(CO)2Cp, in which the Fe(CO)2Cp is low&#8208;spin iron(0) and acts as an X&#8208;type ligand toward the high&#8208;spin iron(II) of the LFe fragment. This largely electrostatic interaction has a bond order of only 0.5. The three&#8208;coordinate high&#8208;spin iron(II) site has large zero&#8208;field splitting, and in addition its M&#246;ssbauer parameters can be used to rank the Fp&#8722; &#8220;metalloligand&#8221; as a donor; it is nearly as strong a donor as phosphides and alkyls.

         <title>Doubly&#8208;Reduced Pentacene in Different Coordination Environments: X&#8208;ray Crystallographic and Theoretical Insights into Structural and Electronic Changes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chemical reduction of pentacene with alkali metals ranging from Li to Cs readily affords the doubly&#8208;reduced anion that shows different binding preference for the lightest Li+ ion vs. heavier Group 1 congeners. DFT calculations provide full support for the X&#8208;ray crystallographic data by following changes in aromaticity and electronic structure of pentacene upon reduction.







Abstract
Chemical reduction of pentacene (C22H14, 1) with Group 1 metals ranging from Li to Cs revealed that 1 readily undergoes a two&#8208;fold reduction to afford a doubly&#8208;reduced 12&#8722; anion in THF. With the help of 18&#8208;crown&#8208;6 ether used as a secondary coordinating agent, five &#960;&#8208;complexes of 12&#8722; with different alkali metal counterions have been isolated and fully characterized. This series of complexes enables the first evaluation of alkali&#8208;metal ion binding patterns and structural changes of the 12&#8722; dianion based on the crystallographically confirmed examples. The difference in coordination of the smallest Li+ ion vs. heavier Group 1 congeners has been demonstrated. In addition, the use of benzo&#8208;15&#8208;crown&#8208;5 in the reaction of 1 with Na metal allowed the isolation of the unique solvent&#8208;separated ion product with a &#8220;naked&#8221; dianion, 12&#8722;. The detailed structural analyses of the series revealed the C&#8722;C bond alteration and core deformation of pentacene upon two&#8208;fold reduction and complexation. The negative charge localization at the central six&#8208;membered ring of 12&#8722; identified by theoretical calculations corroborates with the X&#8208;ray crystallographic results. Subsequent in&#8208;depth theoretical analysis provided a detailed description of changes in the electronic structure and aromaticity of pentacene upon reduction.

     alt="Doubly-Reduced Pentacene in Different Coordination Environments: X-ray Crystallographic and Theoretical Insights into Structural and Electronic Changes"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Chemical reduction&lt;/b&gt; of pentacene with alkali metals ranging from Li to Cs readily affords the doubly-reduced anion that shows different binding preference for the lightest Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ion vs. heavier Group 1 congeners. DFT calculations provide full support for the X-ray crystallographic data by following changes in aromaticity and electronic structure of pentacene upon reduction.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chemical reduction of pentacene (C&lt;sub&gt;22&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;14&lt;/sub&gt;, &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;) with Group 1 metals ranging from Li to Cs revealed that &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; readily undergoes a two-fold reduction to afford a doubly-reduced &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; anion in THF. With the help of 18-crown-6 ether used as a secondary coordinating agent, five &#960;-complexes of &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; with different alkali metal counterions have been isolated and fully characterized. This series of complexes enables the first evaluation of alkali-metal ion binding patterns and structural changes of the &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; dianion based on the crystallographically confirmed examples. The difference in coordination of the smallest Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ion vs. heavier Group 1 congeners has been demonstrated. In addition, the use of benzo-15-crown-5 in the reaction of &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; with Na metal allowed the isolation of the unique solvent-separated ion product with a &#8220;naked&#8221; dianion, &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;. The detailed structural analyses of the series revealed the C&#8722;C bond alteration and core deformation of pentacene upon two-fold reduction and complexation. The negative charge localization at the central six-membered ring of &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; identified by theoretical calculations corroborates with the X-ray crystallographic results. Subsequent in-depth theoretical analysis provided a detailed description of changes in the electronic structure and aromaticity of pentacene upon reduction.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>&#945;&#8208;Amino&#8208;iso&#8208;Butyric Acid Foldamers Terminated with Rhodium(I) N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene Catalysts</title>

Another twist: &#945;&#8208;Amino&#8208;iso&#8208;butyric acid foldamers terminated with rhodium(I) N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene complexes have been shown to possess point, helical and axial chirality. Communication from chiral residues at the N&#8208;termini of these 1&#8197;nm long foldamers to rhodium(I) complexes at the C&#8208;termini led to unequal ratios of diastereoisomers, although this did not alter the stereoselectivity of hydrosilylation reactions catalyzed by these foldamers.







Abstract
To investigate how remotely induced changes in ligand folding might affect catalysis by organometallic complexes, dynamic &#945;&#8208;amino&#8208;iso&#8208;butyric acid (Aib) peptide foldamers bearing rhodium(I) N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) complexes have been synthesized and studied. X&#8208;ray crystallography of a foldamer with an N&#8208;terminal azide and a C&#8208;terminal Rh(NHC)(Cl)(diene) complex showed a racemate with a chiral axis in the Rh(NHC) complex and a distorted 310 helical body. Replacing the azide with either one or two chiral L&#8208;&#945;&#8208;methylvaline (L&#8208;&#945;MeVal) residues gave diastereoisomeric foldamers that each possessed point, helical and axial chirality. NMR spectroscopy revealed an unequal ratio of diastereoisomers for some foldamers, indicating that the chiral conformational preference of the N&#8208;terminal residue(s) was relayed down the 1&#8197;nm helical body to the axially chiral Rh(NHC) complex. Although the remote chiral residue(s) did not affect the stereoselectivity of hydrosilylation reactions catalysed by these foldamers, these studies suggest a potential pathway towards remote conformational control of organometallic catalysts.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single&#8208;atom nanozymes (SAzymes) possess evenly dispersed atomic active centers and well&#8208;defined coordination structure, which provide high enzyme catalytic activity, and clear experimental model for mechanism study. Hence, the enhanced antitumor therapeutic approaches by utilizing tumor microenvironment (TME)&#8208;responsive enzyme activities of SAzymes are revealed. And the corresponding therapeutic mechanisms are also analyzed.







Abstract
Single&#8208;atom nanozymes (SAzymes) with specific response to the unique tumor microenvironment (TME) feature providing 100&#8201;% metal atoms utilization for high&#8208;efficient enzyme&#8208;catalyzed therapy and accurate template for the study of therapeutic mechanisms. In this review, we first introduce the various synthetic strategies of SAzymes, and the TME&#8208;responsive SAzymes activities. Next, the TME&#8208;responsive enhanced antitumor therapeutic approaches based on the enzymatic activities of SAzymes are summarized, and the corresponding therapy mechanisms are elaborated. Subsequently, a concise but concentrated summary, and the challenges and opportunities for the future design and engineering of SAzyme are outlined. As a new discipline, SAzymes have vast space for development in enhanced antitumor therapy. This timely review provides guidance and constructive suggestions for the future of SAzymes.

         <title>Tuning Peptide Structure and Function through Fluorobenzene Stapling</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A catalyst&#8208;free peptide stapling method based on SNAr reactions of fluorobenzene derivatives led to a library of constrained cyclic peptides with a controlled ortho, meta or para relationship between two cysteine residues. The method is compatible with solid&#8208;phase synthesis by which a single linear peptide can be cyclized with different degrees of constraint. New potent agonists of melanocortin receptors were synthesized by using this method, and the effect of the cyclization on the secondary structure was studied by NMR and CD spectroscopy.







Abstract
Cyclic peptides are promising next&#8208;generation therapeutics with improved biological stability and activity. A catalyst&#8208;free stapling method for cysteine&#8208;containing peptides has been developed that enables fine&#8208;tuning of the macrocycle by using the appropriate regioisomers of fluorobenzene linkers. Stapling was performed on the unprotected linear peptide or, more conveniently, directly on&#8208;resin after peptide synthesis. NMR spectroscopy and circular dichroism studies demonstrate that the type of stapling can tune the secondary structures of the peptides. The method was applied to a set of potential agonists for melanocortin receptors, generating a library of macrocyclic potent ligands with ortho, meta or para relationships between the thioethers. Their small but significant differences in potency and efficacy demonstrate how the method allows facile fine&#8208;tuning of macrocyclic peptides towards biological targets from the same linear precursor.

         <title>Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission Leading to White Light Emission in Diphenylbenzofulvene Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Even though the aggregation&#8208;induced emission phenomena have been described for diphenylbenzofulvene derivatives for about 15&#8197;years, their solid&#8208;state emission in films has not been previously studied. Hereby, their solid&#8208;state emission is characterized and the white light emission of a thin film made of mixture of the derivatives DPBFMe and DPMF(Me)2 is deciphered.







Abstract
The search for a unique molecular system able to efficiently emit in the total visible range of the electromagnetic spectra, i.&#8201;e., white light emission (WLE), is a topic of intense research. We here show that aggregates formed by diphenylbenzofulvene (DPBF) derivatives are from two to four orders of magnitude more emissive than their monomers. From a simple strategy, involving structural modification of a DPBF propelled shape core, a close match with the pure white light emission coordinates is obtained with a combination of two derivatives in films, with featured solid&#8208;state emission, without involvement of D&#8722;A groups or energy transfer processes.

         <title>MOF&#8208;Stabilized Perfluorinated Palladium Cages Catalyze the Additive&#8208;Free Aerobic Oxidation of Aliphatic Alcohols to Acids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fluorinated pyridine&#8208;Pd2+ coordinate cages have been synthesized and characterized with atomic resolution within the channels of a metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF), and used as catalysts during the aerobic oxidation of aliphatic alcohols to carboxylic acids without any additive. These results illustrate a rare example of stable per&#8208;fluorinated cationic metal complex, with potential implications in the future design of catalytic organometallic complexes.







Abstract
Extremely high electrophilic metal complexes, composed by a metal cation and very electron poor &#963;&#8208;donor ancillary ligands, are expected to be privileged catalysts for oxidation reactions in organic chemistry. However, their low lifetime prevents any use in catalysis. Here we show the synthesis of fluorinated pyridine&#8208;Pd2+ coordinate cages within the channels of an anionic tridimensional metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF), and their use as efficient metal catalysts for the aerobic oxidation of aliphatic alcohols to carboxylic acids without any additive. Mechanistic studies strongly support that the MOF&#8208;stabilized coordination cage with perfluorinated ligands unleashes the full electrophilic potential of Pd2+ to dehydrogenate primary alcohols, without any base, and also to activate O2 for the radical oxidation to the aldehyde intermediate. This study opens the door to design catalytic perfluorinated complexes for challenging organic transformations, where an extremely high electrophilic metal site is required.

         <title>Molecular Design Strategy for Orange Red Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Emitters in Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes (OLEDs)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this comprehensive review, orange red thermally activated delayed fluorescence emitters are discussed in detail based on various molecular designs. The heteroaromatic&#8208;type emitters possessing high rigid core reveal better efficiency enhancement compared to low rigid cores. Moreover, this review focuses on how to achieve high color purity in orange red emitters while maintaining good OLED device performances.







Abstract
Pure organic molecules based thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters have been successfully developed in recent years for their propitious application in highly efficient organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs). In the case of orange red emitters, the non&#8208;radiative process is known to be a serious issue due to its lower lying singlet energy level. However, recent studies indicate that there are tremendous efforts put to develop efficient orange red TADF emitters. In addition, the external quantum efficiency (EQE) of heteroaromatic based orange red TADF OLEDs surpassed 30&#8201;%. Such heteroaromatic type emitters showed wide emission spectra; therefore, more attention is being paid to develop highly efficient orange red TADF emitters along with good color purity. Herein, the recent progress of orange red TADF emitters based on molecular structures, such as cyanobenzene, heteroaromatic, naphthalimide, and boron&#8208;based acceptors, are reviewed. Further, our insight on these acceptors has been provided by their photophysical studies and device performances. Future perspectives of orange red TADF emitters for real practical applications are discussed.

         <title>Chemically Synthesized, Self&#8208;Assembling Small Interfering RNA&#8208;Prohead RNA Molecules Trigger Dicer&#8208;Independent Gene Silencing</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chimeric molecules fusing small interfering RNA (siRNA) duplexes to prohead RNA (pRNA) three&#8208;way junctions (3WJs) were designed. The siRNA&#8208;3WJs self&#8208;assembled in&#8197;vitro. siRNA&#8208;3WJs transfected into Dicer&#8208;deficient cell lines triggered potent gene silencing. siRNA&#8208;3WJs are most efficient when the antisense strand of the siRNA duplex is positioned 5&#8242; of the 3WJ (5&#8242;&#8208;siRNA&#8208;3WJ) relative to 3&#8242; of the 3WJ (3&#8242;&#8208;siRNA&#8208;3WJ).







Abstract
RNA interference (RNAi) mediated by small interfering RNA (siRNA) duplexes is a powerful therapeutic modality, but the translation of siRNAs from the bench into clinical application has been hampered by inefficient delivery in&#8197;vivo. An innovative delivery strategy involves fusing siRNAs to a three&#8208;way junction (3WJ) motif derived from the phi29 bacteriophage prohead RNA (pRNA). Chimeric siRNA&#8208;3WJ molecules are presumed to enter the RNAi pathway through Dicer cleavage. Here, we fused siRNAs to the phi29 3WJ and two phylogenetically related 3WJs. We confirmed that the siRNA&#8208;3WJs are substrates for Dicer in&#8197;vitro. However, our results reveal that siRNA&#8208;3WJs transfected into Dicer&#8208;deficient cell lines trigger potent gene silencing. Interestingly, siRNA&#8208;3WJs transfected into an Argonaute 2&#8208;deficient cell line also retain some gene silencing activity. siRNA&#8208;3WJs are most efficient when the antisense strand of the siRNA duplex is positioned 5&#8242; of the 3WJ (5&#8242;&#8208;siRNA&#8208;3WJ) relative to 3&#8242; of the 3WJ (3&#8242;&#8208;siRNA&#8208;3WJ). This work sheds light on the functional properties of siRNA&#8208;3WJs and offers a design rule for maximizing their potency in the human RNAi pathway.

Nanoscale particles (NPs) are ubiquitous in our daily life, ranging from ambient particulate matter, microplastics to theranostic nanoparticles. Recent research endeavors in laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry imaging (LDI&#8208;MSI) have enriched the toolbox for evaluation of NPs&#8217; behaviors in biological tissues. Practical applications of LDI MSI for NPs have been verified in sub&#8208;organ bio&#8208;distribution, drug release evaluation and surface chemical analysis. Here we summarized previous studies in anticipation of more innovations in this field.







Abstract
Understanding the fate of nanoscale particles (NPs) in biological systems is significant with the increasing risk for human exposure. Recent research endeavors in laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry imaging (LDI&#8208;MSI) have enriched the toolbox for evaluation of NPs&#8217; behavior in biological tissues, especially in aspects including sub&#8208;organ bio&#8208;distribution, clearance, quantification and surface chemistry variation analysis. In recognition of the potential for advancement in LDI MSI, this concept provides a brief overview of recent research works in LDI MSI for NPs, illustrates new applications that demonstrate the superiority of this technique, and highlights a series of perspectives and directions to move the field forward.

         <title>Cu2O/CeO2 Photo&#8208;electrochemical Water Splitting: A Nanocomposite with an Efficient Interfacial Transmission Path under the Co&#8208;action of a p&#8211;n Heterojunction and Micro&#8208;mesocrystals</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Improving your PECs: A Cu2O/CeO2 composite with a unique structure has been fabricated, in which a p&#8211;n heterojunction and a micro&#8208;mesocrystal (m&#8208;MC) structure work together. Under their synergistic effect, an optimal Cu2O/CeO2 photocathode provides a decisive pathway for the rapid separation and transfer of electron&#8211;holes, thereby facilitating the separation/transfer of carriers. As a result, the optimal Cu2O/CeO2 shows the best photo&#8208;electrochemical (PEC) water splitting performance and excellent stability.







Abstract
Cu2O is an ideal p&#8208;type material for photo&#8208;electrochemical (PEC) hydrogen evolution, although serious electron&#8211;hole recombination and photocorrosion restrict its further improvement for PEC activity. In this work, CeO2 nanoparticles (NPs) self&#8208;assemble on the surface of Cu2O octahedra, thus successfully forming a Cu2O/CeO2 structure in which p&#8211;n heterojunctions and micro&#8208;mesocrystals (m&#8208;MCs) work together. The optimum Cu2O/CeO2 composite, without the use of any cocatalyst, exhibits a fivefold higher photocurrent density (4.63&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 0&#8197;V vs. the reversible hydrogen electrode) than that of Cu2O octahedra, which is better than most Cu2O&#8208;based photocathodes without cocatalyst and even comparable with advanced Cu2O&#8208;based photocathodes. The hydrogen production of the optimal Cu2O/CeO2 (Faradaic efficiency of &#8764;100&#8201;%) is 17.5&#8197;times higher than that of pure Cu2O octahedra, and the photocurrent shows almost no decay under the 12&#8197;h stability test. The delicately designed Cu2O/CeO2 structure in this work provides reference and inspiration for the design of cathodes materials.

In this work, CeO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; nanoparticles (NPs) self-assemble on the surface of Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O octahedra, thus successfully forming a Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O/CeO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; structure in which p&#8211;n heterojunctions and micro-mesocrystals (m-MCs) work together. The optimum Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O/CeO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; composite, without the use of any cocatalyst, exhibits a fivefold higher photocurrent density (4.63&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; at 0&#8197;V vs. the reversible hydrogen electrode) than that of Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O octahedra, which is better than most Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O-based photocathodes without cocatalyst and even comparable with advanced Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O-based photocathodes. The hydrogen production of the optimal Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O/CeO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (Faradaic efficiency of &#8764;100&#8201;%) is 17.5&#8197;times higher than that of pure Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O octahedra, and the photocurrent shows almost no decay under the 12&#8197;h stability test. The delicately designed Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O/CeO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; structure in this work provides reference and inspiration for the design of cathodes materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Light&#8208;Assisted Ullmann Coupling of Phenols and Aryl Halides: The Synergetic Effect Between Plasmonic Copper Nanoparticles and Carbon Nanotubes from Various Sources</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, plasmonic copper nanoparticles (Cu NPs) were loaded onto carbon nanotubes (CNTs) from various sources including commercial CNTs and those directly derived from plastic wastes. Under visible&#8208;light irradiation, the synergetic effect between Cu NPs and CNTs could efficiently promote Ullmann coupling of phenols and aryl halides, achieving high yields of diaryl ethers.







Abstract
Utilizing light and plastic wastes as resources to turn the wasted phenols and hazardous aryl halides into value added chemicals seems to be an attractive idea for alleviating the energy crisis and environmental problems. In this work, plasmonic copper nanoparticles (Cu NPs) were loaded onto carbon nanotubes (CNTs) from various sources including commercial CNTs and those derived from plastic wastes. Under visible&#8208;light irradiation, the catalyst could efficiently convert phenols and aryl halides to diaryl ethers. Similar with commercial CNTs, excellent activity is also achieved when utilizing CNTs derived from different kinds of plastic wastes as support for the system. Further investigation shows that the visible&#8208;light irradiation and light&#8208;excited plasmonic Cu NPs are necessary to inhibit the phenol degradation on CNTs and in turn promote the cross&#8208;coupling of phenol and aryl halides. Compared with metal oxides and other carbon materials, the excellent capability of CNTs to absorb light, to convert light to heat, and to adsorb both two reactants simultaneously are critical to enhance the activity of Cu NPs, achieving high yields of diaryl ethers. This study could provide a novel strategy for catalyst design and generate a more economically sustainable process.

         <title>Transition&#8208;Metal&#8208;Mediated Glycosylation with Thioglycosides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Methods for thioglycoside activation that rely on transition metal catalysis is summarized in this review.







Abstract
Thioglycosides are among the most common glycosyl donors that find broad application in the synthesis of glycans and glycoconjugates. However, the requirement for toxic and/or large access of activators needed for common glycosylations with thioglycosides remains a notable drawback. Due to the increased awareness of the chemical waste impact on the environment, synthetic studies have been driven by the goal of finding non&#8208;toxic reagents. The main focus of this review is to highlight recent methods for thioglycoside activation that rely on transition metal catalysis.

IF2.&#8722;Li+, which is featuring a unique semiconductor. Compound IF.&#8722;K+(18&#8208;c&#8208;6) is a 1D magnetic chain; [IF.&#8722;K+(15&#8208;c&#8208;5)]2 is a radical anionic dimer with an open&#8208;shell ground state; and IF.&#8722;Na+(15&#8208;c&#8208;5) and IF.&#8722;K+(cryptand) are monoradical anion salts.







Abstract
The one&#8208;electron reduction of indeno[2,1&#8208;a]fluorene&#8208;11,12&#8208;dione (IF) with various alkali metals prepare the radical anion salts. The data about different structures, properties, and characterization was obtained by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy, superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) measurements, and physical property measurement system (PPMS). Compound IF.&#8722;K+(18&#8208;c&#8208;6) is regarded as a one&#8208;dimensional magnetic chain through C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;C interaction. Theoretical calculations and magnetic results showed that [IF.&#8722;K+(15&#8208;c&#8208;5)]2 is a dimer with an open&#8208;shell ground state. Compounds IF.&#8722;Na+(15&#8208;c&#8208;5) and IF.&#8722;K+(cryptand) are monoradical anion salts: IF2.&#8722;Li+ possesses unique &#960;&#8208;stack structure with an interplanar separation less than 3.46&#8197;&#197;, making it a semiconductor (&#948;RT=1.9&#215;10&#8722;4&#8197;S&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;cm&#8722;1). This work gives insights into multifunctional radical anions, and describes the design and development of different functional radicals.

         <title>Tunable Surface Electric Field of Electrocatalysts via Constructing Schottky Heterojunctions for Selective Conversion of Trash Ions to Treasures</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A conceptually new method is proposed to tune the surface electric field of electrocatalysts by adjusting the number and density of heterojunctions inside. The well&#8208;designed surface electric field of an electrocatalyst plays a key role in facilitating pre&#8208;adsorption and/or activation of reactants for selective conversion of trash ions to useful products.







Abstract
Surface electric field of catalyst is widely recognized as one of the key points to boost catalytic activity. However, there is still a lack of convenient ways to tune the surface electric field to selectively boost the catalytic conversions of different types of reactants in specific catalytic reactions. Here, we introduce a conceptually new method to tune the surface electric field of electrode materials by adjusting the number and density of heterojunctions inside. Both theoretical and experimental results prove that the well&#8208;designed surface electric field of an electrocatalyst plays a key role in facilitating pre&#8208;adsorption and/or activation of reactants for selective conversion of trash ions to useful products in hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions as well as NOx&#8722; reduction reactions.

         <title>Pd(II)&#8208;Mediated C&#8722;H Activation for Cysteine Bioconjugation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Out of the box: A highly efficient bioconjugation strategy is reported utilising Pd(II) complexes prepared via C&#8722;H activation, which enable selective S&#8208;arylation of cysteine. These C&#8722;H activation complexes were prepared using common Pd(II) sources and without the need for a glovebox. A wide substrate scope is enabled by in&#8197;situ generation of these complexes, which produce excellent conversions of a model tripeptide and are able to arylate surface cysteine on an intact protein.







Abstract
Selective bioconjugation remains a significant challenge for the synthetic chemist due to the stringent reaction conditions required by biomolecules coupled with their high degree of functionality. The current trailblazer of transition&#8208;metal mediated bioconjugation chemistry involves the use of Pd(II) complexes prepared via an oxidative addition process. Herein, the preparation of Pd(II) complexes for cysteine bioconjugation via a facile C&#8722;H activation process is reported. These complexes show bioconjugation efficiency competitive with what is seen in the current literature, with a user&#8208;friendly synthesis, common Pd(II) sources, and a more cost&#8208;effective ligand. Furthermore, these complexes need not be isolated, and still achieve high conversion efficiency and selectivity of a model peptide. These complexes also demonstrate the ability to selectively arylate a single surface cysteine residue on a model protein substrate, further demonstrating their utility.

         <title>Selective Para&#8208;C&#8722;H Alkynylation of Aniline Derivatives by Pd/S,O&#8208;Ligand Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
para&#8208;Alkynylated aromatic amines are obtained without the need to prefunctionalize the starting aniline by Pd/S,O&#8208;ligand catalyzed C&#8722;H alkynylation reactions.







Abstract
Herein, we report a nondirected para&#8208;selective C&#8722;H alkynylation of aniline derivatives by a Pd/S,O&#8208;ligand&#8208;based catalyst. The reaction proceeds under mild conditions and is compatible with a variety of substituted anilines. The scalability and further derivatizations of the alkynylated products have been also demonstrated.

         <dc:description>
A new anti&#8208;SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 compound, developed in this joint study, is shown in front of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 viruses. The ongoing pandemic of human SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 infections (COVID&#8208;19) creates a high demand for antiviral drug development. The shown quinoline&#8211;morpholine hybrid and other new quinoline&#8208;based compounds were synthesized and investigated for their in vitro activity against SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2. They exerted an anti&#8208;SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 activity similar to or stronger than that of the reference drug. More information can be found in the Research Article by M. Marschall, S.&#8197;B. Tsogoeva et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202103861).

A simple, radially arranged, highly anthracene congested 1,2,3&#8208;tri(9&#8208;anthryl)benzene has been synthesized in a Negishi coupling reaction with a PdI catalyst. This beautiful three&#8208;anthracene clustered structure shows unique behavior in both the solid and excited states, but work is still in progress. There are three more anthracenes on the wooden desk for construction of the final target: hexa(9&#8208;anthryl)benzene. More information can be found in the Research Article by T. Nishiuchi, H. Sotome, K. Shimizu, H. Miyasaka, and T. Kubo (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202104245).

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A heavy&#8208;atom&#8208;free BOPHY&#8208;based photosensitizer (PS) has been obtained as a mixture of two atropisomers. The BOPHY core works as a visible light&#8208;harvesting center and donor antenna, while a fullerene C60 acceptor acts as an effective spin converter and triggers photodynamic action. The dyad is capable of producing reactive oxygen species (ROS) by both photodynamic mechanisms. In&#8208;vitro studies indicate that the dyad photokills microorganisms after visible light irradiation. More information can be found in the Research Article by D.&#8197;A. Heredia et&#8197;al.

         <title>Spectroscopic and Crystallographic Characterization of the R3N+&#8722;C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;X Interaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Despite recent studies that have demonstrated the importance of R3N+&#8722;C&#8722;H hydrogen bonds in synthesis, biology and medicine, these noncovalent interactions remain undercharacterized. Herein, we present crystallographic, computational and for the first time, spectroscopic evidence for these weak hydrogen bonds.







Abstract
As appreciation for nonclassical hydrogen bonds has progressively increased, so have efforts to characterize these interesting interactions.

     alt="Spectroscopic and Crystallographic Characterization of the R3N+&#8722;C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;X Interaction"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Despite recent&lt;/b&gt; studies that have demonstrated the importance of R&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;&#8722;C&#8722;H hydrogen bonds in synthesis, biology and medicine, these noncovalent interactions remain undercharacterized. Herein, we present crystallographic, computational and for the first time, spectroscopic evidence for these weak hydrogen bonds.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As appreciation for nonclassical hydrogen bonds has progressively increased, so have efforts to characterize these interesting interactions. Whereas several kinds of C&#8722;H hydrogen bonds have been well-studied, much less is known about the R&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;&#8722;C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;X variety. Herein, we present crystallographic and spectroscopic evidence for the existence of these interactions, with special relevance to Selectfluor chemistry. Of particular note is the propensity for Lewis bases to engage in nonclassical hydrogen bonding over halogen bonding with the electrophilic F atom of Selectfluor. Further, the first examples of &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H NMR experiments detailing R&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;&#8722;C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;X (X=O, N) hydrogen bonds are described.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Tuning the (Chir)optical Properties and Squeezing out the Inherent Chirality in Polyphenylene&#8208;Locked Helical Carbon Nanorings</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Distorting linear polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) out of planarity affects their physical properties and breaks their symmetry to induce inherent chirality. However, the chirality cannot be achieved in large distorted PAHs&#8208;based macrocycles due to low racemization barrier for isomerization. Herein we report the precise synthesis and tuning size&#8208;dependent (chir)optical properties of a new class of chiral PAHs&#8208;containing conjugated macrocycles (cyclo[n]paraphenylene&#8208;2,6&#8208;anthrylene, [n]CPPAn2,6; n = 6&#8208;8). Their inherent chiralities were squeezed out in small anthrylene&#8208;based macrocycles. Efficient resolutions for chiral enantiomers with (P)/(M)&#8208;helicity of small [6&#8208;7]CPPAns were achieved by HPLC. Interestingly, these macrocycles showed enriched size&#8208;dependent physical, chiral, and (chir)optical properties. Theoretical calculations indicate that these macrocycles have high strain energy (Estrain = 60.8 to 73.4 kcal/mol) and very small Egap (~3.0 eV). Notably, these enantiomers showed strong chiroptical properties and dissymmetry factors (|gabs| and |glum| ~0.01 for an enantiomer of [6]CPPAn2,6), which can give them potential applications in optically active materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Cationic Iridium&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Decarbonylative Aryl Addition of Aromatic Aldehydes to Bicyclic Alkenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report an unprecedented catalytic protocol for the enantioselective decarbonylative transformation of aryl aldehydes. In this process, the decarbonylation of aldehydes catalyzed by chiral iridium complexes enable the formation of asymmetric C&#8211;C bonds&#160; via &#160;the formation of an aryl&#8208;iridium intermediate. The decarbonylative aryl addition to bicyclic alkenes was fluidly performed without using a stoichiometric aryl&#8208;metal reagent, such as aryl boronic acid, with a cationic iridium complex generated in situ from Ir(cod)2(BArF4) and the sulfur&#8208;linked bis(phosphoramidite) ligand ((R,R)&#8208;S&#8208;Me&#8208;BIPAM). This reaction has broad functional group compatibility, and no waste is generated, except carbon monoxide.</dc:description>

         <title>The Potential of Micellar Media in the Synthesis of DNA&#8208;Encoded Libraries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>DNA&#8208;encoded library (DEL) technology has become widely used in drug discovery research. The construction of DELs require robust organic transformations which proceed in aqueous media under mild conditions. Unfortunately, the application of water as reaction media for organic synthesis is not evident due to generally limited solubility of organic reagents. However, the use of surfactants can offer a solution to this issue. Oil&#8208;in&#8208;water microemulsions formed by surfactant micelles are able localize hydrophobic reagents inside them, resulting in high local concentration of the organic substances in an otherwise poorly solvated environment. This review provides a conceptual and critical summary of micellar synthesis possibilities that are well&#8208;suited for DEL synthesis. Existing examples on micellar DEL approaches, together with a selection of micellar organic transformations fundamentally suitable for DEL are discussed.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The nitridoberylloaluminate Ba  2  [BeAl  3  N  5  ]:Eu  2+  and solid solutions Sr  2&#8722;  x  Ba  x  [BeAl  3  N  5  ]:Eu  2+  (  x  = 0.5, 1.0, 1.5) were synthesized in a hot isostatic press (HIP) under 50 MPa N  2  atmosphere at 1200 &#176;C. Ba  2  [BeAl  3  N  5  ]:Eu  2+  crystallizes in triclinic space group (no. 2) (  Z  = 2,  a  = 6.1869(10),  b  = 7.1736(13),  c  = 8.0391(14) &#197;,  &#945;  = 102.754(8),  &#946;  = 112.032(6),  &#947;  = 104.765(7)&#176;), which was determined from single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction data. The lattice parameters of the solid solution series have been obtained from Rietveld refinements and show a nearly linear dependence on the atomic ratio Sr:Ba. The electronic properties and the band gaps of  M  2  [BeAl  3  N  5  ] (  M  = Sr, Ba) have been investigated by a combination of soft X&#8208;ray spectroscopy and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Upon irradiation with blue light (440&#8211;450 nm), the nitridoberylloaluminates exhibit intense orange to red luminescence, which can be tuned between 610 and 656 nm (fwhm = 1922&#8211; 2025 cm  &#8722;1  (72&#8211;87 nm)). In contrast to the usual trend, the substitution of the smaller Sr  2+  by larger Ba  2+  leads to an inversetunable luminescence to higher wavelengths. Low&#8208;temperature luminescence measurements have been performed to exclude anomalous emission.</dc:description>

         <title>A New Variant of Emissive RNA Alphabets</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A new fluorescent ribonucleoside alphabet (  mth  N) consisting of pyrimidines and purines analogues, all derived from methylthieno[3,4&#8208;  d  ]pyrimidine as the heterocyclic core, is described.&#160; Large bathochromic shifts and high microenvironmental susceptibility of their emission relative to previous alphabets derived from thieno[3,4&#8208;  d  ]pyrimidine (  th  N) and isothiazole[4,3&#8208;  d  ]pyrimidine (  tz  N) scaffolds are observed. Subjecting the purine analogues to adenosine deaminase, guanine deaminase and T7 RNA Polymerase indicate that, while varying, all but one enzyme tolerate the corresponding  mth  N/  mth  NTP substrates. The robust emission quantum yields, high photophysical responsiveness and enzymatic accommodation suggest that the  mth  N alphabet is a biophysically viable tool and can be used to probe the tolerance of nucleoside/tide&#8208;processing enzymes to structural perturbations of their substrates.</dc:description>

         <title>Mechanistic Insight into Hydroboration of Imines from Combined Computational and Experimental Studies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Boron Lewis acid&#8208;catalyzed and catalyst&#8208;free hydroboration reactions of imines are attractive due to the mild reaction conditions. In this work, the mechanistic details of the hydroboration reactions of two different kinds of imine with pinacolborane (HBpin) are investigated by combining density functional theory calculations and experimental studies. For the hydroboration reaction of  N  &#8208;(&#945;&#8208;methylbenzylidene)aniline catalyzed by tris[3,5&#8208;bis(trifluoromethyl)phenyl]borane (BAr  F  3  ), our calculations show that the reaction proceeds through a boron Lewis acid&#8208;promoted hydride transfer mechanism rather than the classical Lewis acid&#8208;activation mechanism. For the catalyst&#8208; and solvent&#8208;free hydroboration reaction of imine,  N  &#8208;benzylideneaniline, our calculations and experimental studies indicate that this reaction is difficult to occur under the reaction conditions reported previously. With a combination of computational and experimental studies, we have established that the commercially available BH  3  &#183;SMe  2  can serve as an efficient catalyst for the hydroboration reaction of  N  &#8208;benzylideneaniline. The hydroboration reaction catalyzed by BH  3  &#183;SMe  2  is most likely to proceed through a hydroboration/B&#8208;H/B&#8208;N &#963;&#8208;bond metathesis pathway, which is very different from that of the reaction catalyzed by BAr  F  3  .</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The triptycene scaffold has been ring&#8208;opened using a retro&#8208;Friedel&#8211;Crafts&#8208;type reaction under acidic conditions to give its corresponding anthrone product. 9&#8208;Hydroxytriptycenes and unsubstituted triptycene undergo a ring&#8208;opening reaction under strongly acidic conditions, such as TfOH. An investigation of the substitution effect has revealed that the electron&#8208;donating group on the arene moiety allows the reaction to proceed in the presence of a weaker acid, such as TFA. In addition, the reaction has been successfully applied toward the synthesis of tetracene.</dc:description>

         <title>Nonaqueous Emulsion Polycondensation enabled by a Self&#8208;Assembled Cage&#8208;like Surfactant</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nonaqueous emulsions are crucial for a range of applications based on water&#8208;sensitive systems such as controlled polymerizations requiring anhydrous reaction conditions and the stabilization of readily hydrolyzable reagents or pharmacologically active components. However, defined molecular surfactants to stabilize such nonaqueous emulsions are scarce. We introduce a self&#8208;assembled coordination cage, decorated with cholesterol functionalities, to serve as a molecular surfactant for various oil&#8208;in&#8208;oil emulsions of immiscible organic solvents. While the positively charged cage forms the amphiphile&#8217;s polar moiety, the non&#8208;polar cholesterol appendices can bend in a common direction to stabilize the emulsion. Templated by the droplets, polycondensation reactions were carried out to produce microstructured polyurethane and polyurea materials of different particle sizes and morphologies. Further, the amphiphilic cage can encapsulate a guest molecule and the resulting host&#8208;guest assembly was also examined as a surfactant. In addition, the aggregation behavior of the amphiphilic cage in an aqueous medium was examined.</dc:description>

         <title>Iridium&#8208;Catalyzed Domino Hydroformylation/Hydrogenation of Olefins to Alcohols: Synergy of Two Ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Going to plan: Olefins have been hydroxymethylated by using an iridium catalyst and the synergy of two ligands. DFT calculations provided a chance to develop new catalytic systems before empirical studies were undertaken. Then the iridium&#8208;catalyzed domino hydroformylation/reduction of olefins to alcohols under water&#8211;gas shift reaction conditions was studied as an example. Two different ligands (L1 and L10) applied at the same time improved alcohol yields and verified the computational model.







Abstract
A novel one&#8208;pot iridium&#8208;catalyzed domino hydroxymethylation of olefins, which relies on using two different ligands at the same time, is reported. DFT computation reveals different activities for the individual hydroformylation and hydrogenation steps in the presence of mono&#8208; and bidentate ligands. Whereas bidentate ligands have higher hydrogenation activity, monodentate ligands show higher hydroformylation activity. Accordingly, a catalyst system is introduced that uses dual ligands in the whole domino process. Control experiments show that the overall selectivity is kinetically controlled. Both computation and experiment explain the function of the two optimized ligands during the domino process.

         <title>Competition for Hydride Between Silicon and Boron: Synthesis and Characterization of a Hydroborane&#8208;Stabilized Silylium Ion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Silylium against borenium&#8230;who wins when tugging on opposite &#8220;ends&#8221; of hydride? A cationic system based on a naphtalene&#8208;1,8&#8208;diyl platform has been designed for probing the competition for hydride between silicon and boron. The hydroborane&#8208;stabilized silylium ion with a delocalized three&#8208;center, two&#8208;electron B&#8722;H&#8722;Si bond and more silylium than borenium ion character is the winner (see Scheme; [B(C6F5)4]&#8722; omitted for clarity).







Abstract

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Silylium against borenium&lt;/b&gt;&#8230;who wins when tugging on opposite &#8220;ends&#8221; of hydride? A cationic system based on a naphtalene-1,8-diyl platform has been designed for probing the competition for hydride between silicon and boron. The hydroborane-stabilized silylium ion with a delocalized three-center, two-electron B&#8722;H&#8722;Si bond and more silylium than borenium ion character is the winner (see Scheme; [B(C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; omitted for clarity).

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Potent main-group Lewis acids are capable of activating element-hydrogen bonds. To probe the rivalry for hydride between silylium- and borenium-ion centers, a neutral precursor with the hydrosilane and hydroborane units in close proximity on a naphthalene-1,8-diyl platform was designed. Abstraction of one hydride leads to a hydroborane-stabilized silylium ion rather than a hydrosilane-coordinated borenium ion paired with [B(C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; or [HCB&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; as counteranions. Characterization by multinuclear NMR spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction supported by DFT calculations reveals a cationic, unsymmetrical open three-center, two-electron (3c2e) Si&#8722;H&#8722;B linkage.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Definite role&#8208;sharing and exact cooperation of the functional groups and hydrophobic cavity enable the regio&#8208;specific sulfonyl transfer reaction.







Abstract
Miniature models of acyl&#8208;transfer systems in cells, which were composed by replacing the protein, coenzyme, and substrate with CD, functional group, and CD, respectively, and combining them all together in one, displayed definite role&#8208;sharing and exact cooperation of the functional groups and hydrophobic cavity, and thus enabled the regio&#8208;specific reaction.

         <title>Total Synthesis of Mycinamicin IV as Integral Part of a Collective Approach to Macrolide Antibiotics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Final act: While a &#8220;collective&#8221; total synthesis of complex macrolide antibiotics illustrates the power of catalysis, it also shows that the glycosylation of elaborate targets remains far from routine. The success critically hinged on the development of robust new approaches to the peripheral (di)deoxy sugars and the proper choice amongst a set of only seemingly equivalent promoters.







Abstract
The total synthesis of the 16&#8208;membered macrolide mycinamicin IV is outlined, which complements our previously disclosed, largely catalysis&#8208;based route to the aglycone. This work must also be seen in the context of our recent conquest of aldgamycin N, a related antibiotic featuring a similar core but a distinctly different functionalization pattern. Taken together, these projects prove that the underlying blueprint is integrative and hence qualifies for a collective approach to this prominent class of natural products. In both cases, the final glycosylation phase mandated close attention and was accomplished only after robust de novo syntheses of the (di)deoxy sugars of the desosamine, chalcose, mycinose and aldgarose types had been established. Systematic screening of the glycosidation promoter was also critically important for success.

         <title>Reaching New Biocatalytic Reactivity Using Continuous Flow Reactors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Continuous flow is a mainstay in the synthetic chemist's toolbox. It has also begun to see increasing application in biocatalysis. This manuscript discusses some of the challenges that continuous flow has contributed solutions to for the improvement of biocatalysis. It also poses how the future of continuous flow biocatalysis will change with new technologies such as automation, in&#8208;line analysis and AI.







Abstract
The use of flow reactors in biocatalysis has increased significantly in recent years. Chemists have begun to design flow systems that even allow new biocatalytic reactions to take place. This concept article will focus on the design of flow systems that have allowed enzymes to go beyond their limits in batch. The case is made for moving towards fully continuous systems. With flow chemistry increasingly seen as an enabling technology for automated synthesis, and with advancements in AI&#8208;assisted enzyme design, there is a real possibility to fully automate the development and implementation of a continuous biocatalytic processes. This will lead to significantly improved enzyme processes for synthesis.

         <title>Evidence for Charge Delocalization in Diazafluorene Ligands Supporting Low&#8208;Valent [Cp*Rh] Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ligands based upon the 4,5&#8208;diazafluorene core are an important class of emerging ligands in organometallic chemistry, but the structure and electronic properties of these ligands have received less attention than they deserve. Here, we show that 9,9&#8242;&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;4,5&#8208;diazafluorene (Me  2  daf) can stabilize low&#8208;valent complexes through charge delocalization into its conjugated &#960;&#8208;system. Using a new platform of [Cp*Rh] complexes with three accessible formal oxidation states (+III, +II, and +I), we show that the methylation in Me  2  daf is protective, blocking Br&#248;nsted acid&#8208;base chemistry commonly encountered with other daf&#8208;based ligands. Electronic absorption spectroscopy and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis of a family of eleven new compounds, including the unusual Cp*Rh(Me  2  daf), reveal features consistent with charge delocalization driven by &#960;&#8208;backbonding into the LUMO of Me  2  daf, reminiscent of behavior displayed by the workhorse 2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridyl ligand. Taken together with spectrochemical data demonstrating clean conversion between oxidation states, our findings show that 9,9&#8242;&#8208;dialkylated daf&#8208;type ligands are promising building blocks for applications in reductive chemistry and catalysis.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>In this combined computational and experimental study, we performed studies on the C&#8208;H functionalization of 2&#8208;phenyl pyridine with diazoalkanes. Initial evaluation by computational methods allowed the evaluation of different metal catalysts and diazoalkanes and their compatibility in this C&#8208;H functionalization reaction. With these findings we were able to then quickly identify suitable reaction conditions for the C&#8208;H methylation reactions using highly reactive TMS diazomethane and C&#8208;H alkylation reactions with donor/acceptor diazoalkanes, which is applied to a broad scope on alkylation reactions of 2&#8208;aryl pyridines with TMS diazomethane and donor/acceptor diazoalkane (51 examples, up to 98% yield).</dc:description>

         <title>A Modular Synthesis of Substituted Cycloparaphenylenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein we report a modular synthesis providing access to substituted cycloparaphenylenes (CPPs) of different size. A key synthon introducing two geminal ester units was efficiently prepared via [2+2+2] cycloaddition reaction. This building block can be conveniently converted to macrocyclic precursors controlling the ring size of the final CPP. Efficient reductive aromatization  via  single&#8208;electron transfer provided the substituted nanohoops in a straight&#8208;forward manner. The  t&#8208;  Bu&#8208;ester substitution pattern enables a tube&#8208;like arrangement in the solid&#8208;state governed by van&#8208;der&#8208;Waals interactions exhibiting one of the tightest packings of CPPs in tube&#8208;direction known opening new avenues in crystal design of CPPs.</dc:description>

         <title>Thermodynamically favourable states in the reaction of nitrogenase without dissociation of any sulfide ligand</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We have used combined quantum mechanical and molecular mechanical (QM/MM) calculations to study the reaction mechanism of nitrogenase, assuming that none of the sulfide ligands dissociate. To avoid the problem that there is no consensus regarding the structure and protonation of the E&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;state, we start from a state where N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;is bound to the cluster and is protonated to N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, after dissociation of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. We show that the reaction follows an alternating mechanism with HNNH (possibly protonated to HNNH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;NNH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;as intermediates and the two NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;products dissociate at the E&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;and E&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;levels. For all intermediates, coordination to Fe6 is preferred, but for the E&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;and E&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;intermediates, binding to Fe2 is competitive. For the E&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, E&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;and E&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;intermediates we find that the substrate may abstract a proton from the hydroxy group of the homocitrate ligand of the FeMo cluster, thereby forming HNNH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;NNH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;and NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;intermediates. This may explain why homocitrate is a mandatory component of nitrogenase. All steps in the suggested reaction mechanism are thermodynamically favourable compared to protonation of the nearby His&#8208;195 group and in all cases, protonation of the NE2 atom of the latter group is preferred</dc:description>

         <title>Origin of the different reactivity of the high&#8208;valent coinage&#8208;metal complexes [RCuiiiMe3]&#8722; and [RAgiiiMe3]&#8722; (R=allyl)**

Gas&#8208;phase fragmentation experiments reveal a contrasting reactivity of the high&#8208;valent coinage&#8208;metal complexes [RCuiiiMe3]&#8722; and [RAgiiiMe3]&#8722; (R=allyl). Using DFT, coupled&#8208;cluster and multi&#8208;configurational calculations together with kinetic modeling, the reactivity difference is traced back to different C&#8722;C coupling propensities of the two complexes. For [RAgMe3]&#8722;, an outer&#8208;sphere cross&#8208;coupling transition state featuring a large multi&#8208;configurational character plays a key role for the understanding of its reactivity.







Abstract
High&#8208;valent tetraalkylcuprates(iii) and &#8208;argentates(iii) are key intermediates of copper&#8208; and silver&#8208;mediated C&#8722;C coupling reactions. Here, we investigate the previously reported contrasting reactivity of [RMiiiMe3]&#8722; complexes (M=Cu, Ag and R=allyl) with energy&#8208;dependent collision&#8208;induced dissociation experiments, advanced quantum&#8208;chemical calculations and kinetic computations. The gas&#8208;phase fragmentation experiments confirmed the preferred formation of the [RCuMe]&#8722; anion upon collisional activation of the cuprate(iii) species, consistent with a homo&#8208;coupling reaction, whereas the silver analogue primarily yielded [AgMe2]&#8722;, consistent with a cross&#8208;coupling reaction. For both complexes, density functional theory calculations identified one mechanism for homo coupling and four different ones for cross coupling. Of these pathways, an unprecedented concerted outer&#8208;sphere cross coupling is of particular interest, because it can explain the formation of [AgMe2]&#8722; from the argentate(iii) species. Remarkably, the different C&#8722;C coupling propensities of the two [RMiiiMe3]&#8722; complexes become only apparent when properly accounting for the multi&#8208;configurational character of the wave function for the key transition state of [RAgMe3]&#8722;. Backed by the obtained detailed mechanistic insight for the gas&#8208;phase reactions, we propose that the previously observed cross&#8208;coupling reaction of the silver complex in solution proceeds via the outer&#8208;sphere mechanism.

         <title>Combined in silico and in vitro approaches to uncover the oxidation and Schiff base reaction of baicalein as an inhibitor of amyloid protein aggregation.</title>

         <dc:description>The oxidized form of&#160;baicalein&#160;(  BA  )&#160;leads to covalent binding with human amyloid proteins. Such adducts hamper&#160;the aggregation&#160;and deposition of fibrils. A novel reaction of&#160;  BA  &#160;with pentylamine (  PA  ) as a model for the lysine side chain is described. This is the first study addressing&#160;the&#160;atomistic details of a Schiff base reaction with the tri&#8208;hydroxylated moiety of&#160;  BA  .&#160;Nuclear magnetic resonance and mass spectrometry approaches&#160;clearly&#160;indicate the formation of dehydrobaicalein in solution as well as its condensation reaction with&#160;  PA  &#160;under aerobic conditions, yielding regioselective C6&#8208;substituted products. The combined results suggest initial ion pair formation between&#160;  BA  &#160;and&#160;  PA  , followed by a redox chain reaction: the initiation by oxygen/air; the&#160;  o  &#8208;quinone&#8208;based chain involving oxidation and reduction steps; and extra off&#8208;chain formation of a doubly oxidized product.&#160;These mechanistic details support the anti&#8208;amyloid activity of&#160;  BA  &#160;and endorse its trihydroxyphenyl&#8208;moiety as a pharmacophore for drug design studies.</dc:description>

         <title>Sandacrabins &#8211; Structurally unique antiviral RNA polymerase inhibitors from a rare myxobacterium</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report structure elucidation and total synthesis of five unprecedented terpenoid&#8208;alkaloids, the sandacrabins, alongside with the first description of their producing organism  Sandaracinus  defensii  MSr10575, which expands the  Sandaracineae  family by only its second member. The genome sequence of  S. defensii  as presented in this study was utilized to identify enzymes responsible for sandacrabin formation, whereby dimethylbenzimidazol, deriving from cobalamin biosynthesis, was identified as key intermediate. Biological activity profiling revealed that all sandacrabins except congener A exhibit potent antiviral activity against the human pathogenic coronavirus HCoV229E in the three digit nanomolar range. Investigation of the underlying mode of action discloses that the sandacrabins inhibit the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 RNA&#8208;dependent RNA polymerase complex, highlighting them as structurally distinct non&#8208;nucleoside RNA synthesis inhibitors. The observed segregation between cell toxicity at higher concentrations and viral inhibition opens the possibility for their medicinal chemistry optimization towards selective inhibitors.</dc:description>

         <title>Indoloquinoline Ligands Favor Intercalation at Quadruplex&#8208;Duplex Interfaces</title>

Quadruplex&#8208;duplex junctions: A quadruplex&#8208;duplex interface outcompetes an exposed 5&#8217;&#8208;outer tetrad of a parallel quadruplex as favored binding site for indoloquinoline ligands. The ligands intercalate between the G&#8208;tetrad and the neighboring Watson&#8208;Crick base pair located at the interface. High&#8208;affinity binding associated with a large exothermicity is driven by maximizing &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking and electrostatic interactions of the positively charged indoloquinoline moiety.







Abstract
Quadruplex&#8208;duplex (Q&#8208;D) junctions are increasingly considered promising targets for medicinal and technological applications. Here, a Q&#8208;D hybrid with a hairpin&#8208;type snapback loop coaxially stacked onto the quadruplex 3&#8217;&#8208;outer tetrad was designed and employed as a target structure for the indoloquinoline ligand SYUIQ&#8208;5. NMR spectral analysis demonstrated high&#8208;affinity binding of the ligand at the quadruplex&#8208;duplex interface with association constants determined by isothermal titration calorimetry of about 107&#8197;M&#8722;1 and large exothermicities &#916;H&#176; of &#8722;14&#8197;kcal/mol in a 120&#8197;mM K+ buffer at 40&#8201;&#176;C. Determination of the ligand&#8208;bound hybrid structure revealed intercalation of SYUIQ&#8208;5 between 3&#8217;&#8208;outer tetrad and the neighboring CG base pair, maximizing &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking as well as electrostatic interactions with guanine carbonyl groups in close vicinity to the positively charged protonated quinoline nitrogen of the tetracyclic indoloquinoline. Exhibiting considerable flexibility, the SYUIQ&#8208;5 sidechain resides in the duplex minor groove. Based on comparative binding studies with the non&#8208;substituted N5&#8208;methylated indoloquinoline cryptolepine, the sidechain is suggested to confer additional affinity and to fix the alignment of the intercalated indoloquinoline aromatic core. However, selectivity for the Q&#8208;D junction mostly relies on the geometry and charge distribution of the indoloquinoline ring system. The presented results are expected to provide valuable guidelines for the design of ligands specifically targeting Q&#8208;D interfaces.

         <title>Biodegradation of Herbicides by a Plant Nonheme Iron Dioxygenase: Mechanism and Selectivity of Substrate Analogues</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Density functional theory calculations show how plant enzymes can initiate the biodegradation of herbicide molecules efficiently. However, the reactivity of substituted substrate analogues is slowed down and in some cases encounters a large rebound barrier.







Abstract
Aryloxyalkanoate dioxygenases are unique herbicide biodegrading nonheme iron enzymes found in plants and hence, from environmental and agricultural point of view they are important and valuable. However, they often are substrate specific and little is known on the details of the mechanism and the substrate scope. To this end, we created enzyme models and calculate the mechanism for 2,4&#8208;dichlorophenoxyacetic acid biodegradation and 2&#8208;methyl substituted analogues by density functional theory. The work shows that the substrate binding is tight and positions the aliphatic group close to the metal center to enable a chemoselective reaction mechanism to form the C2&#8208;hydroxy products, whereas the aromatic hydroxylation barriers are well higher in energy. Subsequently, we investigated the metabolism of R&#8208; and S&#8208;methyl substituted inhibitors and show that these do not react as efficiently as 2,4&#8208;dichlorophenoxyacetic acid substrate due to stereochemical clashes in the active site and particularly for the R&#8208;isomer give high rebound barriers.

         <title>Sterically Crowded Tris(2&#8208;(trimethylsilyl)phenyl)phosphine &#8211; Is it Still a Ligand?</title>

P(o&#8208;TMSC6H4)3: A phosphine with selective reactivity. The steric bulk (represented by the security guard) shields the phosphorus from most external influences &#8211; but not from all. Spectroscopy and diffraction reveal the structural diversity of this molecule and its hand picked reaction products.







Abstract
Tris(2&#8208;(trimethylsilyl)phenyl)phosphine, P(o&#8208;TMSC6H4)3, was synthesised and characterised in solution and in the solid state. The large steric bulk prevents most reactions of the phosphorus donor and makes the compound air stable both in the solid state as well as in solution. This shielded phosphine can still undergo three reactions, namely protonation, oxidation to the phosphine oxide under harsh conditions and complexation to AuI, thus forming a complex with linear coordination. Unexpectedly, complexation was unsuccessful with a range of other metal cations. Neither PdII, PtII, ZnII nor HgII reacted and even the remaining coinage metal cations CuI and AgI could not be coordinated. Both the parent molecule as well as the reaction products were structurally characterised by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, and the conformational change of geometry required to accommodate the additional atoms was analysed in detail. Apart from chemical oxidation with H2O2, P(o&#8208;TMSC6H4)3 displays reversible electrochemical oxidation with a potential not unlike the one of sterically unencumbered phosphines for which the oxidation is usually not reversible. P(o&#8208;TMSC6H4)3 can thus be considered a model compound for the investigation of the electronic properties of sterically unencumbered phosphines.

Pre&#8208;existing conditions play a critical role in disease progression after infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. In this study, we sought to unravel the underlying mechanisms related to the interactions between peptides relevant to type II diabetes mellitus and Parkinson's disease and the G&#8208;quadruplex&#8208;forming sequence RG&#8208;1 of the viral RNA.







Abstract
Given the emergence of the severe acute respiratory syndrome&#8208;coronavirus&#8208;2 (SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2), which particularly threatens older people with comorbidities such as diabetes mellitus and dementia, understanding the relationship between Covid&#8208;19 and other diseases is an important factor for treatment. Possible targets for medical intervention include G&#8208;quadruplexes (G4Qs) and their protein interaction partners. We investigated the stability and conformational space of the RG&#8208;1 RNA&#8208;G&#8208;quadruplex of the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 N&#8208;gene in the presence of salts, cosolutes, crowders and intrinsically disordered peptides, focusing on &#945;&#8208;Synuclein and the human islet amyloid polypeptide, which are involved in Parkinson's disease (PD) and type&#8208;II diabetes mellitus (T2DM), respectively. We found that the conformational dynamics of the RG&#8208;1 G4Q is strongly affected by the various solution conditions. Further, the amyloidogenic peptides were found to strongly modulate the conformational equilibrium of the RG&#8208;1. Considerable changes are observed with respect to their interaction with human telomeric G4Qs, which adopt different topologies. These results may therefore shed more light on the relationship between PD as well as T2DM and the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 disease and their molecular underpinnings. Since dysregulation of G4Q formation by rationally designed targeting compounds affects the control of cellular processes, this study should contribute to the development of specific ligands for intervention.

Opening up possibilities: The reaction of &#946;&#8208;propiolactam in the superacidic systems HF/MF5 and SO2/HF/MF5 (M=Sb, As) leads exclusively to previously unknown open&#8208;chain compounds. With HF as the solvent, salts of monoprotonated 3&#8208;aminopropanoyl fluoride and diprotonated &#946;&#8208;alanine are obtained, depending on the reaction conditions. Interestingly, the change of the solvent to SO2 leads to the formation of a salt containing a thionylimide moiety.







Abstract
The reaction of &#946;&#8208;propiolactam in the superacidic systems HF/MF5 (M=Sb, As) led to the formation of monoprotonated 3&#8208;aminopropanoyl fluoride in the form of [C(O)F(CH2)2NH3][SbF6] and [C(O)F(CH2)2NH3][AsF6]. In the presence of traces of water, the diprotonated species &#946;&#8208;alanine [C(OH)2(CH2)2NH3][AsF6]2 was synthesized for the first time. All salts were characterized by low&#8208;temperature infrared and Raman spectroscopy. Additionally, single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray analyses were conducted in the case of [C(O)F(CH2)2NH3][SbF6] and [C(OH)2(CH2)2NH3][AsF6]2. By using SO2 instead of HF as the solvent, the salt [C(OH)2(CH2)2NHSO][SbF6]2 was obtained, and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray analysis of this salt containing a thionylimide moiety was conducted. For the formation of these open&#8208;chain compounds, an acyl cationic species as intermediate is assumed, which is formed from N&#8208;protonated &#946;&#8208;propiolactam. Quantum chemical calculations at the B3LYP/aug&#8208;cc&#8208;pVTZ and MP2/aug&#8208;cc&#8208;pVTZ levels of theory were carried out to gain a better understanding of the formation and the structural properties of protonated &#946;&#8208;propiolactam.

         <title>Coordination&#8208;Induced Band Gap Reduction in a Metal&#8211;Organic Framework</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Coordination&#8208;induced band gap reduction. Experimental Tauc plots indicate that TUB1 possesses indirect and direct band gaps of 2.4&#8197;eV and 2.7&#8197;eV, respectively. DFT calculations reveal two spin&#8208;dependent gaps of 2.60&#8197;eV and 0.48&#8197;eV for the alpha and beta spins, respectively, with the lowest unoccupied crystal orbital for both gaps predominantly residing on the square planar copper atoms. This results in a lower overall band gap, as the beta&#8208;gap for the trigonal bipyramidal copper atoms is 3.72&#8197;eV.







Abstract
Herein, we report on the synthesis of a microporous, three&#8208;dimensional phosphonate metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) with the composition Cu3(H5&#8208;MTPPA)2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2 NMP (H8&#8208;MTPPA=methane tetra&#8208;p&#8208;phenylphosphonic acid and NMP=N&#8208;methyl&#8208;2&#8208;pyrrolidone). This MOF, termed TUB1, has a unique one&#8208;dimensional inorganic building unit composed of square planar and distorted trigonal bipyramidal copper atoms. It possesses a (calculated) BET surface area of 766.2&#8197;m2/g after removal of the solvents from the voids. The Tauc plot for TUB1 yields indirect and direct band gaps of 2.4&#8197;eV and 2.7&#8197;eV, respectively. DFT calculations reveal the existence of two spin&#8208;dependent gaps of 2.60&#8197;eV and 0.48&#8197;eV for the alpha and beta spins, respectively, with the lowest unoccupied crystal orbital for both gaps predominantly residing on the square planar copper atoms. The projected density of states suggests that the presence of the square planar copper atoms reduces the overall band gap of TUB1, as the beta&#8208;gap for the trigonal bipyramidal copper atoms is 3.72&#8197;eV.

         <title>Bimodal Fluorescence/Magnetic Resonance Molecular Probes with Extended Spin Lifetimes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Long&#8208;lived nuclear singlet states have been shown to be a viable tool in many different areas of research, from material sciences over the investigation of catalytic cycles to applications in biochemistry. The synthesis of four compounds, in which a nuclear singlet state in pairs of 13C and 15N nuclei can be populated is shown. Furthermore, bimodal fluorescence/singlet&#8208;state NMR application for the determination of water concentration has been investigated, which can be useful in a variety of fields.







Abstract
Bimodal molecular probes combining nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and fluorescence have been widely studied in basic science, as well as clinical research. The investigation of spin phenomena holds promise to broaden the scope of available probes allowing deeper insights into physiological processes. Herein, a class of molecules with a bimodal character with respect to fluorescence and nuclear spin singlet states is introduced. Singlet states are NMR silent but can be probed indirectly. Symmetric, perdeuterated molecules, in which the singlet states can be populated by vanishingly small electron&#8208;mediated couplings (below 1&#8197;Hz) are reported. The lifetimes of these states are an order of magnitude longer than the longitudinal relaxation times and up to four&#8197;minutes at 7 T. Moreover, these molecules show either aggregation induced emission (AIE) or aggregation caused quenching (ACQ) with respect to their fluorescence. In the latter case, the existence of excited dimers, which are proposed to use in a switchable manner in combination with the quenching of nuclear spin singlet states, is observed

         <title>Injectable Micromotor@Hydrogel System for Antibacterial Therapy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An injectable micromotor@hydrogel drug delivery system which can be injected directly into lesions to release micromotors in response to the environment has been developed to reduce external influence on micromotors and improve the sustained&#8208;release effect. Micromotors underwent enhanced diffusion in the surroundings of bacteria without addition of exogenous hydrogen peroxide, which was manifested by their appearance in edge of the inhibition zone. The proposed micromotor@hydrogel drug delivery system offers a new strategy for the treatment of bacterial infections.







Abstract
The drug delivery system based on nano/micromotors has become a research hot spot in recent years. However, naked micromotors may be ruptured or passivated under the complex biological environment, which will result in the leakage of drugs in advance or limited self&#8208;propulsion performance. Herein, an injectable micromotor@hydrogel drug delivery system to protect micromotors from the external environment is proposed. The micromotors were prepared through layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer assembly technology. The asymmetric decomposition of hydrogen peroxide catalyzed by the locally distributed platinum nanoparticles enabled efficient propulsion of the micromotors in low concentration of hydrogen peroxide. In order to protect micromotors, they were loaded into the Schiff base hydrogel. The micromotor@hydrogel system can be injected directly into the lesion to release micromotors in response to the environment, reducing external influence on micromotors and improving the sustained&#8208;release effect. Erythromycin (Ery) loaded into the micromotors and the micromotor@hydrogel system demonstrated excellent antibacterial effect. Micromotors released from the hydrogel underwent enhanced diffusion in the surroundings of bacteria without addition of exogenous hydrogen peroxide, which was manifested by their appearance in edge of the inhibition zone. The proposed micromotor@hydrogel drug delivery system offers a new strategy for the treatment of bacterial infections.

Surface Rh species with three iodine atoms showed a high catalytic activity for the hydrosilylation of terminal olefins. The picture indicates three iodides with an ammonium cation &#8220;tent&#8221; coordinate to Rh, and the hydrosilylation reaction occurs at the electron&#8208;rich Rh site. Next, the intermediate reacts with CO2 coming from the factory with the assistance of an iodide, then the final product silyl carbonate is formed.

         <title>Olefin Metathesis in Confinement: Towards Covalent Organic Framework Scaffolds for Increased Macrocyclization Selectivity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A biomimetic confinement and precise spatial arrangement of catalysts in porous media can provide increased selectivity for reactions compared to homogeneous catalysis. Herein, a covalent organic framework for molecular heterogeneous olefin metathesis is presented that utilizes spatial confinement of substrates in its pores for a substrate&#8208;size dependent and increased macro(mono)cyclization selectivity.







Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) offer vast structural and chemical diversity enabling a wide and growing range of applications. While COFs are well&#8208;established as heterogeneous catalysts, so far, their high and ordered porosity has scarcely been utilized to its full potential when it comes to spatially confined reactions in COF pores to alter the outcome of reactions. Here, we present a highly porous and crystalline, large&#8208;pore COF as catalytic support in &#945;,&#969;&#8208;diene ring&#8208;closing metathesis reactions, leading to increased macrocyclization selectivity. COF pore&#8208;wall modification by immobilization of a Grubbs&#8208;Hoveyda&#8208;type catalyst via a mild silylation reaction provides a molecularly precise heterogeneous olefin metathesis catalyst. An increased macro(mono)cyclization (MMC) selectivity over oligomerization (O) for the heterogeneous COF&#8208;catalyst (MMC:O=1.35) of up to 51&#8201;% compared to the homogeneous catalyst (MMC:O=0.90) was observed along with a substrate&#8208;size dependency in selectivity, pointing to diffusion limitations induced by the pore confinement.

         <title>Lights and Shadows of DMSO as Solvent for Tin Halide Perovskites</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dead&#8208;end for DMSO? The crystallization of tin halide perovskites into thin&#8208;films is uncontrolled. The strongly&#8208;binding solvent DMSO and its tolerance to additives helped here. However, device performance stagnates around 10&#8211;15&#8201;%. The oxidation of tin by DMSO could explain this. Efforts to substitute it are promising, but still lag behind. Addressing solution properties from a fundamental perspective will allow developing DMSO&#8208;free systems.







Abstract
In 2020 dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), the ever&#8208;present solvent for tin halide perovskites, was identified as an oxidant for SnII. Nonetheless, alternatives are lacking and few efforts have been devoted to replacing it. To understand this trend it is indispensable to learn the importance of DMSO on the development of tin halide perovskites. Its unique properties have allowed processing compact thin&#8208;films to be integrated into tin perovskite solar cells. Creative approaches for controlling the perovskite crystallization or increasing its stability to oxidation have been developed relying on DMSO&#8208;based inks. However, increasingly sophisticated strategies appear to lead the field to a plateau of power conversion efficiency in the range of 10&#8211;15&#8201;%. And, while DMSO&#8208;based formulations have performed in encouraging means so far, we should also start considering their potential limitations. In this concept article, we discuss the benefits and limitations of DMSO&#8208;based tin perovskite processing.

         <title>Ylide&#8208;Stabilized Phosphenium Cations: Impact of the Substitution Pattern on the Coordination Chemistry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Switching selectivity: The isolation and coordination chemistry of a series of ylide&#8208;substituted phosphenium cations is reported. The monoylidyl cations exhibit a distinctly higher reactivity and electrophilicity, thus yielding a chlorophosphine gold cation via chloride shift from gold to phosphorus. In contrast, the diylidyl cation formed the phosphenium AuCl complex, demonstrating the tunability of the phosphenium cation reactivity.







Abstract
Although N&#8208;heterocyclic phosphenium (NHP) cations have received considerable research interest due to their application in organocatalysis, including asymmetric synthesis, phosphenium cations with other substitution patterns have hardly been explored. Herein, the preparation of a series of ylide&#8208;substituted cations of type [YPR]+ (with Y=Ph3PC(Ph), R=Ph, Cy or Y) and their structural and coordination properties are reported. Although the diylide&#8208;substituted cation forms spontaneous from the chlorophosphine precursor, the monoylidylphosphenium ions required the addition of a halide&#8208;abstraction reagent. The molecular structures of the cations reflected the different degrees of electron donation from the ylide to the phosphorus center depending on the second substituent. Molecular orbital analysis confirmed the stronger donor properties of the ylide systems compared to NHPs with the mono&#8208;ylide substituted cations featuring a more pronounced electrophilicity. This was mirrored by the reaction of the cations towards gold chloride, in which only the diylide&#8208;substituted cation [Y2P]+ formed the expected LAuCl]+ complex, while the monoylide&#8208;substituted compounds reacted to the chlorophosphine ligands by transfer of the chloride from gold to the phosphorus center. These results demonstrate the tunability of ylide&#8208;functionalized phosphorus cations, which should allow for further applications in coordination chemistry in the future.

         <title>Alkaline Stability of Low Oxophilicity Metallopolymer Anion&#8208;Exchange Membranes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metallopolymers can address many of the challenges of anion&#8208;exchange membranes in electrochemical devices, especially those requiring high alkaline stability. Using the same polymer backbone and NHC ligand, membranes are prepared using low oxophilicity metals such as Cu, Zn, Ni and Au, and their relative alkaline stabilities are compared. The Au(III) metallopolymer demonstrates unparalleled alkaline stability and good ion&#8208;conductivity.







Abstract
Anion&#8208;exchange membrane fuel cells (AEMFCs) are promising energy conversion devices due to their high efficiency. Nonetheless, AEMFC operation time is currently limited by the low chemical stability of their polymeric anion&#8208;exchange membranes. In recent years, metallopolymers, where the metal centers assume the ion transport function, have been proposed as a chemically stable alternative. Here we present a systematic study using a polymer backbone with side&#8208;chain N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) ligands complexed to various metals with low oxophilicity, such as copper, zinc, nickel, and gold. The golden metallopolymer, using the metal with the lowest oxophilicity, demonstrates exceptional alkaline stability, far superior to state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art quaternary ammonium cations, as well as good in situ AEMFC results. These results demonstrate that judiciously designed metallopolymers may be superior to purely organic membranes and provides a scientific base for further developments in the field.

         <title>Properties of the reactants and their interactions within and with the enzyme binding
cavity determine reaction selectivities. The case of Fe(II)/2&#8208;oxoglutarate dependent enzymes.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fe(II)/2&#8208;oxoglutarate dependent dioxygenases (ODDs) share a double stranded beta helix (DSBH) fold and utilise a common reactive intermediate, ferryl species, to catalyse oxidative transformations of substrates. Despite the structural similarities, ODDs accept a variety of substrates and facilitate a wide range of reactions, i.e. hydroxylations, desaturations, (oxa)cyclisations and ring rearrangements. In this review we present and discuss the factors contributing to the observed (regio)selectivities of ODDs. They span from inherent properties of the reactants, i.e. substrate molecule and iron cofactor, to the interactions between the substrate and the enzyme&#8217;s binding cavity; the latter can counterbalance the effect of the former. Based on results of both experimental and computational studies dedicated to ODDs, we also line out the properties of the reactants which promote reaction outcomes other than the &#8220;default&#8221; hydroxylation. It turns out that the reaction selectivity depends on a delicate balance of interactions between the components of the investigated system.</dc:description>

         <title>Influence of the Flexibility of Nickel PCP&#8208;Pincer Complexes on C&#8211;H and P&#8211;C Bond Activation and Ethylene Reactivity: A Combined Experimental and Theoretical Investigation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Using a pincer platform based on a bridgehead NHC donor with functional side arms, we examined the combined effect of increased flexibility in six&#8208;membered pyrimidine&#8208;type heterocycles compared to the more often studied five&#8208;membered imidazole, and rigidity of phosphane side arms. The unique features observed include (i) the reaction of the azolium Csp2&#8211;H bond with [Ni(cod)2] affording a carbanionic ligand in [NiCl(PCsp3HP)] (8) rather than a carbene, (ii) its transformation into the NHC, hydrido complex [NiH(PCNHCP)]PF6&#160;(9) upon halide abstraction, (iii) ethylene insertion into the Ni&#8211;H bond of the latter and ethyl migration to the N&#8211;C&#8211;N carbon atom of the heterocycle in [Ni(PCEtP)]PF6&#160;(10) and (iv) an unprecedented C&#8211;P bond activation transforming the P&#8211;CNHC&#8211;P pincer ligand of&#160;8&#160;in a C&#8211;CNHC&#8211;P pincer and a terminal phosphanido ligand in [Ni(PPh2)(CCNHCP)] (15). The data are supported by 9 crystal structure determinations and theoretical calculations provided insights into the mechanisms of these transformations, which are relevant to stoichiometric and catalytic steps of general interest.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Polyoxygenated Tropolones and their Antiviral Activity Against Hepatitis B Virus and Herpes Simplex Virus&#8208;1</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polyoxygenated tropolones possess a broad range of biological activity, and as a result are promising lead structures or fragments for drug&#8208;development. However, structure&#8208;function studies and subsequent optimization have been challenging, in part due to the limited number of readily available tropolones and the obstacles to their synthesis.&#160; The oxidopyrylium [5+2] cycloaddition reaction can effectively generate a diverse array of 7&#8208;membered ring carbocycles, and as a result can provide a highly general strategy for tropolone synthesis.&#160; Here, we describe the use of 3&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;4&#8208;pyrone&#8208;based oxidopyrylium cycloaddition chemistry in synthesis of functionalized 3,7&#8208;dimethoxytropolones, 3,7&#8208;dihydroxytropolones, and isomeric 3&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;7&#8208;methoxytropolones through complementary benzyl alcohol&#8208;incorporating procedures. Antiviral activity of these molecules against herpes simplex virus&#8208;1 and hepatitis B virus is also described, highlighting the value of this approach and providing new structure&#8208;function insight relevant to their antiviral activity.</dc:description>

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Arylative Cyclizations of Alkyne&#8208; and Allene&#8208;Tetethered Electrophiles using Arylboron Reagents</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The use of arylboron reagents in metal&#8208;catalyzed domino addition&#8722;cyclization reactions is a well&#8208;established strategy for the preparation of diverse, highly functionalized carbo&#8208; and heterocyclic products. Although rhodium&#8208; and palladium&#8208;based catalysts have been commonly used for these reactions, more recent work has demonstrated nickel catalysis is also highly effective, in many cases offering unique reactivity and access to products that might otherwise not be readily available. This review gives an overview of nickel&#8208;catalyzed arylative cyclizations of alkynyl and allenyl electrophiles using arylboron reagents. The scope of the reactions is discussed in detail, and general mechanistic concepts underpinning the processes are described.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Coinage metal&#8208;promoted 5&#8208;  exo  and 6&#8208;  endo  selective cyclization of 2&#8208;(1&#8208;alkynyl)benzaldimines have been studied. It was found that, under gold catalysis, 2&#8208;(1&#8208;alkynyl)benzaldimines underwent exclusive 5&#8208;  exo  &#8208;dig cyclization processes, followed by oxidation to form  N  &#8208;aryl 3&#8208;methyleneisoindolin&#8208;1&#8208;ones. In contrast, in the presence of base and under activation of AgOTf, switching of 5&#8208;  exo  into 6&#8208;  endo  cyclizations of 2&#8208;(1&#8208;alkynyl)benzaldimines was observed, exclusively giving  N  &#8208;aryl or  N  &#8208;alkyl substituted isoquinolinium salts. The two key reaction intermediates, exocyclic vinyl&#8208;Au and the endocyclic vinyl&#8208;Ag species have been isolated and characterized, and the study of their reactivities confirms the plausible mechanisms. Moreover, reacting the resultant 3&#8208;methyleneisoindolin&#8208;1&#8208;ones with benzyne could afford structurally important isoindolinone&#8208;based benzocyclobutenes. Additionally, several interesting transformations of the resultant isoquinolinium salts have been also investigated.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aqueous self&#8208;assembly of short peptides has attracted growing attention for the construction of supramolecular materials for various bioapplications. Herein, we describe that the thermolysin&#8208;assisted biocatalytic construction of a dipeptide hydrazide from an  N  &#8208;protected amino acid and an amino acid hydrazide leads to the formation of thermally stable supramolecular hydrogels. In addition, we demonstrate the post&#8208;assembly modification of the  in situ  constructed supramolecular architectures tethering hydrazide groups as a chemical handle by means of fluorescence imaging.</dc:description>

         <title>Abnormal Association between Metal&#8208;organic cages and counterions regulated by the Hydration Shells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We observed a unique trend in the binding affinity between cationic metal&#8208;organic cages (MOCs) and external counter&#8208;anions in aqueous media. Behaving like many macroions, two MOCs, sharing similar structures but carrying different number of charges, self&#8208;assembled into hollow spherical single&#8208;layered blackberry&#8208;type structures via counterion&#8208;mediated attraction. Dynamic and static light scattering, and isothermal titration calorimetry measurements confirm the stronger interactions among less charged MOCs and counter&#8208;anions than that of highly charged MOCs, leading to larger assembly sizes. DOSY NMR measurements suggest the significance of thick hydration shells of highly charged MOCs, inhibiting the MOC&#8208;counterion binding and weakening the interaction between them. This study demonstrates that the greater role played by hydration shell on ion&#8208;pair formation comparing with charge density of MOCs.</dc:description>

         <title>An Adaptive Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Framework for the Exclusive Recognition of p&#8208;Xylene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Separation of xylene isomers is one of the most important but most challenging and energy&#8208;intensive separation processes in the petrochemical industry. Here, we report an adaptive hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework (HOF&#8208;28) constructed from a porphyrin based organic building block 4,4',4'',4'''&#8208;(porphyrin&#8208;5,10,15,20&#8208;tetrayl) tetrabenzonitrile (PTTBN), exhibiting the exclusive molecular recognition of p&#8208;xylene (pX) over its isomers of o&#8208;xylene (oX) and m&#8208;xylene (mX), as clearly demonstrated in the single crystal structure transformation and 1H NMR studies. Single crystal structure studies show that single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal transformation from the as&#8208;synthesized HOF&#8208;28 to the pX exclusively included HOF&#8208;28&#201;pX is triggered by the encapsulation of pX molecules, accompanied by sliding of the 2D layers and local distortion of the ligand, which provides multiple C&#8722;H&#183;&#183; &#960; interactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Tunable excimer circularly polarized luminescence in isohexide derivatives from renewable resources</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic compounds showing circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) are at the forefront of novel applications and technologies. Here we show the synthesis and chiroptical properties of pyrene and perylene derivatives of inexpensive chiral scaffolds: isomannide and isosorbide. Low&#8208;intensity ECD spectra were obtained, suggesting the absence of chromophore interaction in the ground state, except in the case of isomannide bis&#8208;perylenecarboxylate, whose ECD spectrum showed a positive exciton couplet. All isomannide derivatives, with the only exception of the one containing a pyrenecarboxylate and a perylenecarboxylate, exhibited excimer CPL spectra, whereas isosorbide derivatives did not show any CPL. Isomannide derivatives bearing two pyrenecarboxylate or two pyrenylacetate groups showed positive CPL emission with dissymmetry factors up to 10  &#8208;2  , which depends on the conformational freedom of the appended units. The CPL sign, Stokes shift and order of magnitude of dissymmetry factor were reproduced by excited&#8208;state calculations on a representative compound. Interestingly, the mixed derivative containing pyrenic units with different spacing from the isomannide scaffold showed an oppositely signed excimer band with respect to the homo&#8208;substituted derivatives.</dc:description>

         <title>1,2,3&#8208;Tri(9&#8208;anthryl)benzene: Photophysical Properties and Solid&#8208;State Intermolecular Interactions of Radially Arranged, Congested Aromatic &#960;&#8208;Planes**

Anthracene congestion: 1,2,3&#8208;Tri(9&#8208;anthryl)benzene derivatives containing radially shaped &#960;&#8208;clusters were constructed by using PdI&#8208;catalyzed Negishi coupling reactions. The presence of &#960;&#8208;congestion as well as intermolecular &#960;&#8211;&#960; and CH&#8211;&#960; interactions between anthracene units in the crystalline state gives these substances unique electronic properties. The excited&#8208;state dynamics associated with the radially arranged &#960;&#8208;system were elucidated by using transient absorption measurements.







Abstract
We report the Negishi coupling based synthesis of 1,2,3&#8208;tri(9&#8208;anthryl)benzene derivatives containing three radially arranged anthracenes in a &#960;&#8208;cluster. In the crystalline state of the unsubstituted derivative, intermolecular &#960;&#8211;&#960; and CH&#8211;&#960; interactions between the anthracene units drive the formation of the two&#8208;dimensional packing structure. Owing to though&#8208;space &#960;&#8208;conjugation between anthracene units, the substances have unique electronic properties. The excited&#8208;state dynamic behavior occurring between the three anthracene moieties, such as exciton localization/delocalization, was elucidated by means of transient absorption measurements and quantum chemical calculations. Interestingly, even though the three anthracenes are closely oriented with approximately 3.0&#8197;&#197; between their C&#8208;9 positions, exciton localization on two anthracene units is energetically favorable because of the flexible nature of the radially arranged aromatic rings.

         <title>Chiral Dinuclear EuIII, TbIII, and YIII Complexes Supported by P&#8208;Stereogenic Linear Tetraphosphine Tetraoxide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>

A new P&#8208;stereogenic linear tetraphosphine tetraoxide, (R,R)/(S,S)&#8208;Ph2P(=O)CH2P(=O)(Ph)CH2P(=O)(Ph)CH2P(=O)Ph2 abbreviated as (R,R)/(S,S)&#8208;dpmppm(=O)4 (L4RR/SS), was synthesized to prepare C2 dinuclear M(hfa)3 complexes, [M2((R,R)/(S,S)&#8208;dpmppm(=O)4)(hfa)6] (M=Y, Eu, Tb: M2L4RR/SS), which revealed significant chiral induction from the P&#8208;chiral centers on the achiral M(hfa)3 units through intramolecular &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking constraint in the dinuclear system on the basis of circular dichroism (CD) and circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) measurements.







Abstract
A P&#8208;stereogenic linear tetraphosphine tetraoxide, (R,R)&#8208; or (S,S)&#8208;dpmppm(=O)4, was synthesized to prepare C2 dinuclear M(hfa)3 complexes (M=Eu, Tb, Y) as the first example of lanthanide(III) complexes with P&#8208;chiral multidentate phosphine oxides. The mononuclear M(hfa)3 complexes (M=Eu, Y) with a P&#8208;chiral diphosphine dioxide, tpdpb(=O)2, were also prepared, and comparison of their photophysical properties for the EuIII complexes revealed that significant chiral induction from the P&#8208;chiral centers arises on the achiral M(hfa)3 units through intramolecular &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking constraint in the dinuclear system.

&lt;p&gt;A &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;-stereogenic linear tetraphosphine tetraoxide, (&lt;i&gt;R,R&lt;/i&gt;)- or (&lt;i&gt;S,S&lt;/i&gt;)-dpmppm(=O)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, was synthesized to prepare &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; dinuclear M(hfa)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; complexes (M=Eu, Tb, Y) as the first example of lanthanide(III) complexes with &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;-chiral multidentate phosphine oxides. The mononuclear M(hfa)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; complexes (M=Eu, Y) with a &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;-chiral diphosphine dioxide, tpdpb(=O)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, were also prepared, and comparison of their photophysical properties for the Eu&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt; complexes revealed that significant chiral induction from the &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;-chiral centers arises on the achiral M(hfa)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; units through intramolecular &#960;-&#960; stacking constraint in the dinuclear system.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Introducing the Chiral Constrained &#945;&#8208;Trifluoromethylalanine in Aib Foldamers to Control, Quantify and Assign the Helical Screw&#8208;Sense**
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The chiral &#945;&#8208;trifluoromethylalanine is shown to induce and control the screw&#8208;sense preference of short Aib oligomers. Due to the electronic properties of the CF3 group, the screw&#8208;sense is inversed compared to that induced by its non&#8208;fluorinated isosteric l&#8208;&#945;&#8208;MeVal analogue. It also plays the role of 19F NMR reporter allowing the easy determination of both the magnitude of the screw&#8208;sense preference and the assignment of its sign.







Abstract
Oligomers of &#945;&#8208;aminoisobutyric acid (Aib) are achiral peptides that adopt 310 helical structures with equal population of left&#8208; and right&#8208;handed conformers. The screw&#8208;sense preference of the helical chain may be controlled by a single chiral residue located at one terminus. 1H and 19F NMR, X&#8208;ray crystallography and circular dichroism studies on new Aib oligomers show that the incorporation of a chiral quaternary &#945;&#8208;trifluoromethylalanine at their N&#8208;terminus induces a reversal of the screw&#8208;sense preference of the 310&#8208;helix compared to that of a non&#8208;fluorinated analogue having an l&#8208;&#945;&#8208;methyl valine residue. This work demonstrates that, among the many particular properties of introducing a trifluoromethyl group into foldamers, its stereo&#8208;electronic properties are of major interest to control the helical screw sense. Its use as an easy&#8208;to&#8208;handle 19F NMR probe to reliably determine both the magnitude of the screw&#8208;sense preference and its sign assignment is also of remarkable interest.

         <title>d&#8208;Orbital Reconstructions Forced by Double Bow&#8208;Shaped Deformations and Second Coordination Sphere Effects of Cu(II) Heme Analogs in HER**
</title>

         <dc:description>
The electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution performance of copper heme analogs has been modulated by geometric deformation. The work not only provides a new perspective on the function of natural heme distortion but also contributes a practical strategy to improve the catalytic performance of hemes through ligand geometric modulation.







Abstract
Both geometric architecture and electronic configurations of heme proteins contribute to its activity. In this work we designed and synthesized a series of four copper(II) porphyrin complexes (4&#8208;, 3&#8208;, 2&#8208; and 1&#8208;Cu) where the molecular conformations are modulated by a pair of stepwise shortened straps on the same porphyrin side (cis&#8208;ortho) to give double bow&#8208;shaped skeletons. Single crystal structures demonstrate that the straps gradually increase the saddle deformation and the deviation of the metal centers, which is in accordance with two, unusual d&#8208;orbital reconstructions of two different ground states, as revealed by 4&#8197;K EPR and DFT calculations. In the study of the electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), 1&#8208;Cu, with the shortest straps, showed the most apparent improvement of activity. Second coordination sphere (SCS) effects created by the double bow&#8208;shaped architecture and the strong saddle porphyrin core in 1&#8208;Cu are found to play key roles in proton trapping during the catalytic process. The work contributes a novel strategy to improve the catalytic performance of heme analogs through ligand geometric modulation.

         <title>Surface&#8208;Bonding&#8208;Enhanced Self&#8208;Co&#8208;Reactant Electrogenerated Chemiluminescence for Sensitive and Selective Detection of Thioglycolic Acid in Cosmetics</title>

         <dc:description>
Au&#8722;S bonding&#8208;amplified, highly sensitive electrochemiluminescence (ECL) sensing method for Thioglycolic acid (TGA) detection using tris(2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridyl)ruthenium(II) (Ru(bpy)32+) as a luminophore and TGA as a self&#8208;co&#8208;reactant, via an anodic reaction at the Au electrode surface was reported.







Abstract
Thioglycolic acid (TGA) is an organic compound widely used in cosmetics that cause a variety of health problems when overexposed to it. So far many attempts have been made to develop methods for TGA detection, but most of them need sophisticated instrumentations and are a little bit complicated. Therefore, a simple, cheap and sensitive detection method of TGA is highly desired. Herein, we demonstrated for the first time an Au&#8722;S bonding amplified, highly sensitive electrochemiluminescence (ECL) sensing method for TGA detection using tris(2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridyl)ruthenium(II) (Ru(bpy)32+) as a luminophore and TGA as a self&#8208;co&#8208;reactant, via an anodic reaction at the Au electrode surface. Due to different molecular coordination environments of the TGA at the electrode surface, the ECL signal intensity of the developed ECL system gives much higher ECL signal in borate buffer than phosphate buffer of the same pH. Under the optimized experimental conditions, the ECL intensity has a direct relationship with the concentration of TGA in the range of 0.03&#8197;&#956;M to 300&#8197;&#956;M and a limit of detection of 0.013&#8197;&#956;M (3&#963;/m). The reported ECL system has further been applied for the detection of TGA in cosmetics with acceptable recoveries.

         <title>Electronic Circular Dichroism Imaging (ECDi) Casts a New Light on the Origin of Solid&#8208;State Chiroptical Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thanks to the concept of synchrotron radiation ECD imaging (SR&#8208;ECDi) applied to the active pharmaceutical ingredient Finasteride, we obtained an exclusive insight into the critical role played by the anisotropy of local domains in solid&#8208;state ECD spectra. Our findings open a new way to interpret solid&#8208;state chiroptical measurements and will broaden their application to probing and mapping solid chiral materials. More information can be found in the Research Article by M. G&#243;recki, L. Di&#8197;Bari, et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202103632).

         <title>Linked Rotaxane Structure Restricts Local Molecular Motions in Solution to Enhance Fluorescence Properties of Tetraphenylethylene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A method to enhance the performance of fluorophores, with regards to properties such as fluorescence quantum yield and photostability, is reported in this work, using the fluorescent dye tetraphenylethylene. A linked rotaxane structure effectively prevents the local molecular motions of the fluorophore, leading to the enhancement of the performance.







Abstract
The restriction of local molecular motions is critical for improving the fluorescence quantum yields (FQYs) and the photostability of fluorescent dyes. Herein, we report a supramolecular approach to enhance the performance of fluorescent dyes by incorporating a linked rotaxane structure with permethylated &#945;&#8208;cyclodextrins. Tetraphenylethylene (TPE) derivatives generally exhibit low FQYs in solution due to the molecular motions in the excited state. We show that TPE with linked rotaxane structures on two sides displays up to 15&#8208;fold higher FQYs. Detailed investigations with variable temperature 1H NMR, UV&#8208;Vis, and photoluminescence spectroscopy revealed that the linked rotaxane structure rigidifies the TPE moiety and thus suppresses the local molecular motions and non&#8208;radiative decay. Moreover, the linked rotaxane structure enhances the FQY of the dye in various solvents, including aqueous solutions, and improves the photostability through the inhibition of local molecular motions in the excited TPE.

         <title>Regioselective Fluorination of Acenes: Tailoring of Molecular Electronic Levels and Solid&#8208;State Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Controlling energy levels: Partial fluorination of tetracenes allows the precise adjustment of the HOMO and LUMO energy levels. By applying regioselective synthetic strategies, such functionalized tetracenes can be obtained, as demonstrated for the unilaterally fluorinated F3TET, F4TET and F5TET. The solid&#8208;state packing and optoelectronic properties of these materials are compared to the properties of their parental acenes.







Abstract
Optoelectronic properties of molecular solids are important for organic electronic devices and are largely determined by the adopted molecular packing motifs. In this study, we analyzed such structure&#8208;property relationships for the partially regioselective fluorinated tetracenes 1,2,12&#8208;trifluorotetracene, 1,2,10,12&#8208;tetrafluorotetracene and 1,2,9,10,11&#8208;pentafluorotetracene that were further compared with tetracene and perfluoro&#8208;tetracene. Quantum chemical DFT calculations in combination with optical absorption spectroscopy data show that the frontier orbital energies are lowered with the degree of fluorination, while their optical gap is barely affected. However, the crystal structure changes from a herringbone packing motif of tetracene towards a planar stacking motif of the fluorinated tetracene derivatives, which is accompanied by the formation of excimers and leads to strongly red&#8208;shifted photoluminescence with larger lifetimes.

         <title>Rhodium and Iridium Complexes of Anionic Thione and Selone Ligands Derived from Anionic N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Anionic N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes that bear a weakly coordinating fluoroborate moiety have been used to prepare a new class of anionic imidazolin&#8208;2&#8208;thione and &#8208;selone ligands; their coordination chemistry towards rhodium and iridium was explored to reveal their ability to develop secondary arene&#8211;metal interactions with the &#8220;wings&#8221; of the carbene ligands. More information about these new additions to the family of chalcogenolate ligands and their potential future application in coordination chemistry, bioinorganic chemistry and homogeneous catalysis can be found in the Research Article by M. Tamm et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202104139).

         <title>Lanthanide luminescent nanocomposite for non&#8208;invasive temperature monitoring in vivo</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The temperature monitoring  in vivo  plays a vital role in the investigation of biological processes of organisms and the improvement of disease theranostic methods. The development of lanthanide luminescent nanocomposite&#8208;derived temperature probes  in vivo  allows accurate and reliable interrogation of biological thermodynamic processes due to their superior photostability, high sensitivity, and non&#8208;invasive sensing fashion. This concept presented an overview of the recent development of lanthanide luminescent nanocomposite which are suitable for  in vivo  temperature monitoring, including the thermometric principles, key features, materials designs as well as their potential biomedical applications for non&#8208;invasive temperature detection in the living body. The perspectives of these lanthanide luminescent nanocomposite thermometers for the optimization of temperature monitoring performance and potential future development are also discussed.</dc:description>

         <title>Continuous Flow Bioconjugations of NIR&#8208;AZA Fluorophores via Strained Alkyne Cycloadditions with Intra&#8208;chip Fluorogenic Monitoring</title>

         <dc:description>The importance of bioconjugation reactions continues to grow for cell specific targeting and dual therapeutic plus diagnostic medical applications.&#160; This necessitates the development of new bioconjugation chemistries, in&#8208;flow synthetic and analytical methods.&#160; With this goal, continuous flow bioconjugations were readily achieved with short residence times for strained alkyne substituted carbohydrate and therapeutic peptide biomolecules in reaction with azide and tetrazine substituted fluorophores.&#160; The strained alkyne substrates included substituted 2&#8208;amino&#8208;2&#8208;deoxy&#8208;&#945;&#8208;D&#8208;glucopyranose, and the linear and cyclic peptide sequences QIRQQPRDPPTETLELEVSPDPAS&#8208;OH and c(RGDfK) respectively.&#160; The catalyst and reagent&#8208;free inverse electron demand tetrazine cycloadditions proved more favourable than the azide 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloadditions. Reaction completion was achieved with residence times of 5 min at 40 &#176;C for tetrazine versus 10 min at 80 &#176;C for azide cycloadditions.&#160; The use of a fluorogenic tetrazine fluorophore, in a glass channelled reactor chip, allowed for intra&#8208;chip reaction monitoring by recording fluorescence intensities at various positions throughout the chip.

         <title>Revisiting the Fundamental Nature of&#160;Metal&#8208;Ligand Bonding: An Impartial and&#160;Automated&#160;Fitting Procedure for Angular&#160;Overlap Model Parameters</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The properties and reactivities of transition metal complexes are often discussed&#160;in terms of Ligand Field Theory (LFT), and with  ab initio  LFT a direct connection&#160;to quantum chemical wavefunctions was recently established. The Angular&#160;Overlap Model (AOM) is a widely used, ligand&#8208;specific parameterization scheme&#160;of the ligand field splitting which has however been restricted by the availability&#160;and resolution of experimental data. Using  ab initio  LFT, we present here a generalised,&#160;symmetry&#8208;independent and automated fitting procedure for AOM parameters&#160;that is even applicable to formally underdetermined or experimentally&#160;inaccessible systems. This method allows quantitative evaluations of assumptions&#160;commonly made in AOM applications, e.g. transferability or relative magnitudes&#160;of AOM parameters, and the response of the ligand field to structural&#160;or electronic changes. A two&#8208;dimensional spectrochemical series of tetrahedral&#160;halido metalates ([M  II  X  4  ]  2&#8208;  , M=Mn&#8211;Cu) served as a case study. A previously&#160;unknown linear relationship between the halide ligands&#8217; chemical hardness and&#160;their AOM parameters was found. The impartial and automated procedure for&#160;identifying AOM parameters introduced here can be used to systematically improve&#160;our understanding of ligand&#8208;metal interactions in coordination complexes.</dc:description>

         <title>Structural insights into pixatimod (PG545) inhibition of heparanase, a key enzyme in cancer and viral infections</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Pixatimod (PG545), a heparan sulfate (HS) mimetic and anticancer agent currently in clinical trials, is a potent inhibitor of heparanase. Heparanase is an endo &#8208;&#946;&#8208;glucuronidase that degrades HS in the extracellular matrix and basement membranes and is implicated in numerous pathological processes such as cancer and viral infections, including SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2. To understand how PG545 interacts with heparanase, we firstly carried out a conformational analysis through a combination of NMR experiments and molecular modelling which showed that the reducing end &#946;&#8208;D&#8208;glucose residue of PG545 adopts a distorted conformation. This was followed by docking and molecular dynamics simulations to study the interactions of PG545 with heparanase, revealing that PG545 is able to block the active site by binding in different conformations, with the cholestanol side&#8208;chain making important hydrophobic interactions. While PG545 blocks its natural substrate HS from binding to the active site, small synthetic heparanase substrates are only partially excluded, and thus pentasaccharide or larger substrates are preferred for assaying this class of inhibitor. This study provides new insights for the design of next&#8208;generation heparanase inhibitors and substrates.</dc:description>

         <title>Hydrogen&#8208;Bridged Oligosilanylsilyl Mono&#8208; and Oligosilanylsilyl Dications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The presence of multiple Si&#8722;H functionalities in one molecule is used to generate at low temperatures oligosilane&#8208;based mono&#8208; and dications that are stabilized by intramolecular 3c2e Si&#8722;H&#8722;Si bridges. For the oligosilanylsilyl monocation, a rapid intramolecular Si&#8722;H group exchange is monitored by NMR spectroscopy at low temperatures. This dynamic process is not observed for the corresponding dication. According to the obtained NMR data, both cationic Si&#8722;H&#8722;Si bridges are electronically isolated by the trisilanyl backbone.







Abstract
Hydrogen&#8208;bridged oligosilanylsilyl borates 8&#8201;[B(C6F5)4], 9[B(C6F5)4] and diborates 10&#8201;[B(C6F5)4]2 have been prepared by hydride transfer between &#945;&#8208;&#969;&#8208;dihydrido&#8208; (11) and branched tetrahydrido&#8208;oligosilanes (13) and trityl cation. The obtained cyclic intramolecularly stabilized silylium ions 8, 9 and bissilylium ion 10 were characterized by low temperature NMR spectroscopy supported by the results of density functional calculations. The branched Si&#8722;H&#8722;Si monocation 9 undergoes at low temperatures a fast degenerate rearrangement, which exchanges the Si&#8722;H groups with a barrier of 31&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1 via an antarafacial transition state. Reaction of the branched monocation 9 with a second equivalent of trityl cation or of the branched oligosilane 13 with two equivalents of trityl cation, gives at &#8722;80&#8201;&#176;C the corresponding bissilylium ion 10, an example for a new class of highly reactive poly&#8208;Lewis acids.

The branched Si&#8722;H&#8722;Si monocation &lt;b&gt;9&lt;/b&gt; undergoes at low temperatures a fast degenerate rearrangement, which exchanges the Si&#8722;H groups with a barrier of 31&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; via an &lt;i&gt;antarafacial&lt;/i&gt; transition state. Reaction of the branched monocation &lt;b&gt;9&lt;/b&gt; with a second equivalent of trityl cation or of the branched oligosilane &lt;b&gt;13&lt;/b&gt; with two equivalents of trityl cation, gives at &#8722;80&#8201;&#176;C the corresponding &lt;i&gt;bis&lt;/i&gt;silylium ion &lt;b&gt;10&lt;/b&gt;, an example for a new class of highly reactive poly-Lewis acids.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Calixarenes Incorporating Sulfonamide Moieties: Versatile Ligands for Carbonic Anhydrases Inhibition</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Calixarene derivatives bearing arms terminating with primary benzensulfonamides demonstrated their ability of inhibiting human Carbonic Anhydrases with significant efficiency and selectivity among different isoforms of the enzymes. A mode of binding where the benzensulfonamide arm penetrates into the funnel of the enzyme active site and interacts with the protein Zn2+ ion is supported by X&#8208;ray diffraction data and MD calculations.







Abstract
Carbonic anhydrases (CAs) continue to represent a relevant pharmaceutical target. The need of selective inhibitors and the involvement of these metalloenzymes in many multifaceted diseases boost the search for new ligands able to distinguish among the different CA isoforms, and for multifunctional systems simultaneously able to inhibit CAs and to interfere with other pathological events by interacting with additional targets. In this work, we successfully explored the possibility of preparing new CAs ligands by combining calixarenes with benzensulfonamide units. Inhibition tests towards three human CA isoforms evidenced, for some of the ligands, Ki values in the nanomolar range and promising selectivity. X&#8208;ray and molecular modeling studies provided information on the mode of binding of these calixarene derivatives. Thanks to the encouraging results and the structural features typical of the calixarene scaffold, it is then possible to plan for the future the design of multifunctional inhibitors for this class of widely spread enzymes.

         <title>BOPHY&#8208;Fullerene C60 Dyad as a Photosensitizer for Antimicrobial Photodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photosensitizer: The first BOPHY&#8211;fullerene C60 dyad (BP&#8208;C60) has been synthesized and obtained as two atropisomers. The presence of the BOPHY light&#8208;harvesting antenna in the dyad increases the absorption of the fullerene moiety in the visible region and improves its photodynamic action. Photoinduced energy/electron transfer processes (EnT/PeT) take place from BOPHY to fullerene C60. The dyad exhibits an efficient production of reactive oxygen species. BP&#8208;C60 is a promising heavy&#8208;atom&#8208;free photosensitizer with potential application in photodynamic treatments..







Abstract
A novel BOPHY&#8211;fullerene C60 dyad (BP&#8208;C60) was designed as a heavy&#8208;atom&#8208;free photosensitizer (PS) with potential uses in photodynamic treatment and reactive oxygen species (ROS)&#8208;mediated applications. BP&#8208;C60 consists of a BOPHY fluorophore covalently attached to a C60 moiety through a pyrrolidine ring. The BOPHY core works as a visible&#8208;light&#8208;harvesting antenna, while the fullerene C60 subunit elicits the photodynamic action. This fluorophore&#8211;fullerene cycloadduct, obtained by a straightforward synthetic route, was fully characterized and compared with its individual counterparts. The restricted rotation around the single bond connecting the BOPHY and pyrrolidine moieties led to the formation of two atropisomers. Spectroscopic, electrochemical, and computational studies disclose an efficient photoinduced energy/electron transfer process from BOPHY to fullerene C60. Photodynamic studies indicate that BP&#8208;C60 produces ROS by both photomechanisms (type&#8197;I and type&#8197;II). Moreover, the dyad exhibits higher ROS production efficiency than its individual constitutional components. Preliminary screening of photodynamic inactivation on bacteria models (Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli) demonstrated the ability of this dyad to be used as a heavy&#8208;atom&#8208;free PS. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that not only a BOPHY&#8211;fullerene C60 dyad is reported, but also that a BOPHY derivative is applied to photoinactivate microorganisms. This study lays the foundations for the development of new BOPHY&#8208;based PSs with plausible applications in the medical field.

         <dc:description>
Label&#8208;free electrochemiluminescence imaging of single cells has been achieved through a bipolar nanoelectrode array. The picture is divided into two parts by a strip of film, indicating that the bipolar nanoelectrode array separates cells and imaging. Oxygen is shown as the electrochemical probe and Ru(bpy)32+ as the luminescence molecule. More information can be found in the Research Article by X.&#8208;H. Xia et&#8197;al.

The reaction features in situ protection and activation of an &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated carboxylic acid by a hydrosilane. The copper enolate formed in situ reacts with a ketone to afford the &#946;&#8208;hydroxy carboxylic acid with excellent enantioselectivity (up to 99% ee). The corresponding gram&#8208;scale reaction with a low catalyst loading and the derivatization of the &#946;&#8208;hydroxy carboxylic acids highlight the practicality of this transformation.</dc:description>

         <title>Rh&#8208;Catalyzed Coupling of Aldehydes with Allylboronates Enables Facile Access to Ketones</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We present herein a novel strategy for the preparation of ketones from aldehydes and allylic boronicesters. This reaction involves the allylation of aldehydes with allylic boronicesters and the Rh&#8208;catalyzed chain&#8208;walking of homoallylic alcohols. The key to this successful development is the protodeboronation of alkenyl borylether intermediate via a tetravalent borate anion species in the presence of KHF  2  and MeOH. This approach features mild reaction conditions, broad substrate scope, and excellent functional group tolerance. Mechanistic studies also supported that the tandem allylation and chain&#8208;walking process was involved.</dc:description>

This approach features mild reaction conditions, broad substrate scope, and excellent functional group tolerance. Mechanistic studies also supported that the tandem allylation and chain-walking process was involved.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

The bonding character, electron delocalization, and aromaticity of C18&#8208;(CO)n (n=6, 4, and 2) were studied by advanced theoretical means. The difference of electron delocalization between two sets of &#960;&#8208;conjugated systems and significant influence of the number of &#8208;CO groups on them were focused on, and the essential reason for the distinct difference in molecular aromaticity was elucidated.







Abstract
The bonding character, electron delocalization, and aromaticity of the cyclo[18]carbon (C18) precursors, C18&#8208;(CO)n (n=6, 4, and 2), have been studied by combining quantum chemical calculations and various electronic wavefunction analyses with different physical bases. It was found that C18&#8208;(CO)n (n=6, 4, and 2) molecules exhibit alternating long and short C&#8722;C bonds, and have out&#8208;of&#8208;plane and in&#8208;plane dual &#960; systems (&#960;out and &#960;in) perpendicular to each other, which are consistent with the relevant characteristics of C18. However, the presence of carbonyl (&#8208;CO) groups significantly reduced the global electron conjugation of C18&#8208;(CO)n (n=6, 4, and 2) compared to C18. Specifically, the &#8208;CO group largely breaks the extensive delocalization of &#960;in system, and the &#960;out system is also affected by it but to a much lesser extent; as a consequence, C18&#8208;(CO)n (n=6, 4, and 2) with larger n shows weaker overall aromaticity. Mostly because of the decreased but still apparent &#960;out electron delocalization in the C18&#8208;(CO)n (n=6, 4, and 2), a notable diatropic induced ring current under the action of external magnetic field is observed, demonstrating the clear aromatic characteristic in the molecules. The correlation between C18&#8208;(CO)n (n=6, 4, and 2) and C18 in terms of the gradual elimination of &#8208;CO from the precursors showed that the direct elimination of two CO molecules in C18&#8208;(CO)n (n=6, 4, and 2) has a synergistic mechanism, but it is kinetically infeasible under normal conditions due to the high energy barrier.

         <title>Borane Adducts of Aromatic Phosphorus Heterocycles: Synthesis, Crystallographic Characterization and Reactivity of a Phosphinine&#8208;B(C6F5)3 Lewis Pair</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthesis and crystallographic characterization of a phosphinine&#8208;borane adduct was achieved for the first time by using a Me3Si&#8208;functionalized phosphinine and the Lewis acid B(C6F5)3. This reaction strongly depends on the nature of the substituents in the &#945;&#8208;position of the phosphorus heterocycle. In contrast, the reaction of B2H6 with various substituted phosphinines leads to an equilibrium between the starting materials and the phosphinine&#8208;borane adducts, which is determined by the Lewis&#8208;basicity of the phosphinine. The novel phosphinine borane adduct (6&#8208;B(C6F5)3) shows rapid and facile insertion and [4+2] cycloaddition reactivity towards phenylacetylene. With styrene a hitherto unknown dihydro&#8208;1&#8208;phosphabarrelene is formed. The reaction with an ester provides a new, facile and selective route to 1&#8208;R&#8208;phosphininium salts. These salts then undergo a [4+2] cycloaddition in the presence of Me3Si&#8208;C&#8801;CH and styrene, respectively, to cleanly form unprecedented derivatives of 1&#8208;R&#8208;phosphabarrelenium salts.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrostatic perturbations in the substrate&#8208;binding pocket of taurine/&#945;&#8208;ketoglutarate dioxygenase determine its selectivity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Taurine/&#945;&#8208;ketoglutarate dioxygenase is an important enzyme that takes part in the cysteine catabolism process in the human body and selectively hydroxylates taurine at the C  1  &#8208;position. Recent computational studies showed that in the gas&#8208;phase the C  2  &#8722;H bond of taurine is substantially weaker than the C  1  &#8722;H bond, yet no evidence exists of 2&#8208;hydroxytaurine products. To this end, we performed a detailed computational study on the selectivity patterns in TauD. The calculations show that the second&#8208;coordination sphere and the protonation states of residues play a major role in guiding the enzyme to the right selectivity. Specifically, a single proton on an active site histidine residue can change the regioselectivity of the reaction through its electrostatic perturbations in the active site and effectively changes the C  1  &#8722;H and C  2  &#8722;H bond strengths of taurine. This is further emphasized by many polar and hydrogen bonding interactions of the protein cage in TauD with the substrate and the oxidant that weaken the  pro  &#8208;  R  C  1  &#8722;H bond and triggers a chemoselective reaction process. Our large cluster models reproduce the experimental free energy of activation excellently.</dc:description>

A surface Rh&#8211;iodide complex for one&#8208;pot catalysis: A one&#8208;pot synthetic strategy for the hydrosilylation of olefin is developed. The hydrosilylation reaction is accelerated in the presence of a novel Rh&#8211;iodide complex developed on the surface of SiO2. The decrease in steric hindrance and electron donation from iodide to Rh promote the catalytic process.







Abstract
In this study, a novel Rh&#8211;iodide complex was synthesized through a surface reaction between an immobilized Rh cyclooctadiene complex and alkylammonium iodide (N+I&#8722;) on SiO2. In the presence of ammonium cations, the SiO2&#8208;supported Rh&#8211;iodide complex could be effectively used for the one&#8208;pot synthesis of various silylcarbonate derivatives starting from epoxy olefins, hydrosilanes, and CO2. The maximum turnover numbers (TONs) for the hydrosilylation reaction and the CO2 cycloaddition were 7600 (Rh) and 130 (N+I&#8722;), respectively. The catalyst exhibited much higher performance for hydrosilylation than solely the Rh complex on SiO2. The mechanism of the Rh&#8208;catalyzed hydrosilylation reaction and the local structure of Rh, which is affected by the co&#8208;immobilized N+I&#8722;, were investigated by using Rh and I K&#8208;edge XAFS and XPS. Analysis of the XAFS profiles indicated the presence of a Rh&#8722;I bond. The Rh unit was in its electron&#8208;rich state. Curve&#8208;fitting analysis of the Rh K&#8208;edge EXAFS profiles suggests dissociation of the cycloocta&#8208;1,5&#8208;diene (COD) ligand from the Rh center. Results from spectroscopic and kinetic analyses revealed that the high activity of the catalyst (during hydrosilylation) could be attributed to a decrease in steric hindrance and the electron&#8208;rich state of the Rh. The decrease in the steric hindrance could be attributed to the absence of COD, and the electron&#8208;rich state promoted the oxidative addition of Si&#8722;H. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first example of a one&#8208;pot silylcarbonate synthesis as well as a determination of a novel surface Rh&#8211;iodide complex and its catalysis.

         <title>Z&#8208;Scheme In2S3/NU&#8208;1000 Heterojunction for Boosting Photo&#8208;Oxidation of Sulfide into Sulfoxide under Ambient Conditions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of In2S3/NU&#8208;1000&#8201;heterojunction photocatalysts was constructed via a solvothermal method, which efficiently catalyzes the oxidation of sulfides to form sulfoxides as the sole product under LED lamp (full&#8208;spectrum) illumination in air at room temperature. Especially, the sulfur mustard simulant, 2&#8208;chloroethyl ethyl sulfide (CEES), can also be photocatalytically oxidized with In2S3/NU&#8208;1000 to afford nontoxic 2&#8208;chloroethyl ethyl sulfoxide (CEESO) selectively and effectively.







Abstract
Photocatalytic oxidation of sulfide into sulfoxide has attracted extensive attention as an environmentally friendly strategy for chemical transformations or toxic chemicals degradation. Herein, we construct a series of In2S3/NU&#8208;1000 heterojunction photocatalysts, which can efficiently catalyze the oxidation of sulfides to form sulfoxides as the sole product under LED lamp (full&#8208;spectrum) illumination in air at room temperature. Especially, the sulfur mustard simulant, 2&#8208;chloroethyl ethyl sulfide (CEES), can also be photocatalytically oxidized with In2S3/NU&#8208;1000 to afford nontoxic 2&#8208;chloroethyl ethyl sulfoxide (CEESO) selectively and effectively. In contrast, individual NU&#8208;1000 and In2S3 show very low catalytic activity on this reaction. The significantly improved photocatalytic activity is ascribed to the constructing of an efficient Z&#8208;scheme photocatalysts In2S3/NU&#8208;1000, which exhibits the enhancement of light harvesting, the promotion of photogenerated electron&#8208;hole separation, and the retention of high porosity of the parent MOF. Moreover, mechanism studies in photocatalytic oxidation reveal that the superoxide radical (.O2&#8722;) and singlet oxygen (1O2) are the main oxidative species in the oxidation system. This work exploits the opportunities for the construction of porous Z&#8208;scheme photocatalysts based on the photoactive MOFs materials and inorganic semiconductors for promoting catalytic organic transformations. More importantly, it provides a route to the rational design of efficient photocatalysts for the detoxification of mustard gas.

         <title>Characterization of Cyclic N&#8208;Acyliminium Ions by Infrared Ion Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
N&#8208;Acyliminium ions (NAIs) are highly reactive intermediates that are important for the construction of CC&#8208;bonds adjacent to nitrogen atoms. These species have been characterized for the first time in the gas phase by collision induced dissociation tandem mass spectrometry followed by infrared ion spectroscopy (IRIS), which has led to new structural information that can be invoked to explain the diastereoselectivity of reactions involving these cationic intermediates.







Abstract
N&#8208;Acyliminium ions are highly reactive intermediates that are important for creating CC&#8208;bonds adjacent to nitrogen atoms. Here we report the characterization of cyclic N&#8208;acyliminium ions in the gas phase, generated by collision induced dissociation tandem mass spectrometry followed by infrared ion spectroscopy using the FELIX infrared free electron laser. Comparison of DFT calculated spectra with the experimentally observed IR spectra provided valuable insights in the conformations of the N&#8208;acyliminium ions.

         <title>Bulk Mn2+ Doped 1D Hybrid Lead Halide Perovskite with Highly Efficient, Tunable and Stable Broadband Light Emissions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Optimization of 1D perovskite: Through controllable Mn2+ doping strategy toward bulk 1D perovskite, enhanced energy transfer from bound excitons of host material to 3d electrons of Mn2+ ions gives rise to tunable broadband light emissions from weak yellow to strong red spectral range with highest PLQY up to 28.41&#8201;%. More importantly, these Mn2+&#8208;doped 1D perovskites display ultrahigh structural and optical stabilities in humid atmosphere, water and high temperature exceeding the conventional 3D perovskite nanocrystals.







Abstract
Mn2+ doped colloidal three&#8208;dimensional (3D) lead halide perovskite nanocrystal (PNC) has attracted intensive research attention; however, the low exciton binding energy and fatal optical instability of 3D PNC seriously hinder the optoelectronic application. Therefore, it remains significant to explore new stable host perovskite with strongly bound exciton to realize more desirable luminescent property. In this work, we utilized bulk one&#8208;dimensional (1D) hybrid perovskite of [AEP]PbBr5&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;H2O (AEP=N&#8208;aminoethylpiperazine) as structural platform to rationally optimize the luminescent property by a controllable Mn2+ doping strategy. Significantly, the series of Mn2+&#8208;doped 1D [AEP]PbBr5&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;H2O show enhanced energy transfer efficiency from the strongly bound excitons of host material to 3d electrons of Mn2+ ions, resulting in tunable broadband light emissions from weak yellow to strong red spectral range with highest photoluminescence quantum yield up to 28.41&#8201;%. More importantly, these Mn2+&#8208;doped 1D perovskites display ultrahigh structural and optical stabilities in humid atmosphere, water and high temperature exceeding the conventional 3D PNC. Combined highly efficient, tunable and stable broadband light emissions enable Mn2+&#8208;doped 1D perovskite as excellent down&#8208;converting phosphor showcasing the potential application in white light emitting diode. This work not only provides a profound understanding of low&#8208;dimensional perovskites but also opens a new way to rationally design high&#8208;performance broadband light emitting perovskites for solid&#8208;state lighting and displaying devices.

         <title>Prebiotically Plausible Autocatalytic Peptide Amyloids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Simple amino acids activated by the volcanic gas carbonyl sulfide can condense into peptides that then spontaneously assemble into amyloids. This suggests a plausible prebiotic relevance of peptide amyloids and has led to the discovery that they can template sequence&#8208;selective, regioselective and stereoselective peptide synthesis. Depending on the environmental conditions, such amyloid templating can function in either complementary or self&#8208;replicating mode. More information can be found in the Research Article by R. Riek, J. Greenwald, et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202103841).

         <title>A solid support&#8208;based synthetic strategy for the site&#8208;selective functionalization of peptides with organometallic half&#8208;sandwich moieties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The number of donor atoms available on peptides that can competitively coordinate to metal centers renders the site&#8208;selective generation of advanced metal&#8211;peptide conjugates in high purity a challenging venture. Herein, we present a transmetalation&#8208;based synthetic approach on solid support in which an imidazolium proligand can be used to selectively anchor a range of transition metal half&#8208;sandwich complexes onto peptides in the presence of multiple coordinative motifs. Amenable to solid support, a range of N&#8208;terminus and/or lysine conjugated metal&#8208;peptide conjugates were obtained in high purity after cleavage from the resin. The metalated peptides were evaluated for their anticancer properties against human cancer cell lines. While no cytotoxic activity was observed, this platform has the potential to i) provide a pathway to site&#8208;selective peptide labelling, ii) be explored as a biorthogonal handle and/or iii) generate a new strategy for ligand design in transition metal catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>211At and 125I&#8208;labeling of (hetero)aryliodonium ylides: astatine wins again</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Despite the growing interest in radioiodine and  211  At&#8208;labeled radiopharmaceuticals, the search for radiolabeling reactions has been somewhat neglected, resulting in a limited number of available radiosynthetic strategies. Herein we report a comparative study of nucleophilic  125  I and  211  At&#8208;labeling of aryliodonium ylides. Whereas radioiodination efficiency was low,  211  At&#8208;labeling performed efficiently on a broad scope of precursors. The most activated aryliodonium ylides led rapidly to quantitative reactions at room temperature in acetonitrile. For deactivated precursors, heating up to 90&#176;C in glyme and addition of 2,2,6,6&#8208;tetramethylpiperidine&#8208;1&#8208;oxyl (TEMPO) as radical scavenger appeared essential to avoid precursor degradation and to achieve high radiochemical yields and molar activity. The approach was applied successfully to the preparation of 4&#8208;[  211  At]astatophenylalanine (4&#8208;APA), an amino acid derivative increasingly studied as radiotherapeutic drug for cancers. This validated aryliodonium ylides as a valuable tool for nucleophilic  211  At&#8208;labeling and will complement the short but now growing list of available astatination reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Visible Light&#8208;Driven Molecular Switches and Motors: Recent Developments and Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Inspired by human vision, a diverse range of light&#8208;driven molecular switches and motors has been developed for fundamental understanding and application in material science and biology. Recently, the design and synthesis of visible light&#8208;driven molecular switches and motors have been actively pursued. This emerging trend is partly motivated to avoid the harmful effects of ultraviolet light, which was necessary to drive the classical molecular switches and motors at least in one direction, impeding their employment in biomedical and photopharmacology applications. Moreover, visible light&#8208;driven molecular switches and motors are demonstrated to enable benign optical materials for advanced photonic devices. Therefore, during the past several years, visible light&#8208;driven molecular switches based on azobenzene derivatives, diarylethenes, 1,2&#8208;dicyanodithienylethenes, hemithioindigo derivatives, iminothioindoxyls, donor&#8211;acceptor Stenhouse adducts, and overcrowded alkene based molecular motors have been judiciously designed, synthesized, and used in the development of functional materials and systems for a wide range of applications. In this Review, we present the recent developments toward the design of visible light&#8208;driven molecular switches and motors, with their applications in the fabrication of functional materials and systems in material science, bioscience, pharmacology,  etc  . The visible light&#8208;driven molecular switches and motors realized so far undoubtedly widen the scope of these interesting compounds for technological and biological applications. We hope this Review article could provide additional impetus and inspire further research interests for future exploration of visible light&#8208;driven advanced materials, systems, and devices.</dc:description>

         <title>A masked form of an O&#8208;borylated Breslow intermediate for the diastereoselective FLP&#8208;type activation of aldehydes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Breslow intermediates are very often elusive species whose application in Frustrated Lewis Pair chemistry is unprecedented. We describe herein the use of a masked form of an O&#8208;Borylated Breslow (OBB) intermediate that performs FLP&#8208;type activation of the carbonyl function of five different benzaldehyde derivatives with complete diastereoselectivity. The resulting compounds are characterised in solution by NMR spectroscopy (compounds  4  &#8208;  8  ) and in solid state by X&#8208;Ray diffraction analysis (compounds  4  &#8208;  6  ). A combined kinetic and theoretical investigation reveals the associative nature of the rate determining step and suggests that the OBB intermediate part is never released during the whole process.</dc:description>

         <title>Novel lipophilic fluorophores with highly acidity&#8208;dependent two&#8208;photon response</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lipophilic fluorophores are widely implemented in nonlinear microscopy; however, few existing membrane&#8208;specific probes combine high brightness of two&#8208;photon excited fluorescence (2PEF) with pH sensitivity. Here we describe four novel two&#8208;photon excited fluorophores, based on a coumarin 151 core structure, where lipophilicity is induced by a covalently attached phosphazene moiety. Changing the environmental acidity using trifluoromethanesulfonic (triflic) acid leads to profound changes in the linear fluorescence and 2PEF characteristics, due to chromophores&#8217; switching between neutral&#8208; and protonated forms. We characterize this dependence by measuring the two&#8208;photon absorption (2PA) spectra over the region  &#955;  2PA  = 550 &#8211; 1000 nm, observing 2PA cross sections of  &#963;  2PA  = 10 &#8211; 20 GM, with associated 2PEF brightness of 10 &#8211; 13 GM, in neutral solutions of both acetonitrile and  n  &#8208;octanol. Although quantum chemical modelling and NMR measurements show that, at high chromophore concentrations, protonation may be accompanied by a dimerization process, these dimers likely do not form at the lower concentrations used in optical spectroscopy.</dc:description>

         <title>A Redox&#8208;active Microporous Organosiloxane Containing a Stable Neutral Radical, Trioxotriangulene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A new silyl&#8208;substituted trioxotriangulene (  TOT  ) neutral radical and corresponding porous organosiloxanes (POSs) were synthesized. The neutral radical exhibited a peculiarly high stability and formed a diamagnetic &#960;&#8208;dimer characteristic to  TOT  neutral radicals stabilized by the strong multiple SOMO&#8208;SOMO interaction in both solution and solid states. POSs including  TOT  units within the organosiloxane&#8208;wall were prepared by polycondensation of the silyl groups, and formed microporous structures with ~1 nm&#8208;size diameters. Redox ability of  TOT  units in the POS was demonstrated by the treatment of oxidant/reductant in heterogeneous suspension condition, where the  TOT  units were reversibly converted between reduced and neutral radical species. Furthermore, the solid&#8208;state electrochemical measurements of the POS revealed the reversible multi&#8208;stage redox ability of  TOT  units involving polyanionic species within the organosiloxane&#8208;wall.</dc:description>

         <title>Cyanide&#8208;Free Cyanation of sp2 and sp&#8208;Carbons by Oxazole based Masked CN Source Using Flow Microreactors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We herein report a cyanide&#8208;free continuous&#8208;flow process for cyanation of sp  2  and sp carbons to synthesize aryl, vinyl and acetylenic nitriles from (5&#8208;methyl&#8208;2&#8208;phenyloxazol&#8208;4&#8208;yl) boronic acid [OxBA] reagent as a sole source of carbon&#8208;bound masked &#8208;CN source. Non&#8208;toxic and stable OxBA reagent is generated by lithiation&#8208;borylation of bromo&#8208;oxazole, and the consecutive Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling with aryl, vinyl, or acetylenic halides and demasking [4 + 2]/retro&#8208;[4 + 2] sequence were successfully accomplished to give the desired cyano compounds with reasonably good yields in a four&#8208;step flow manner. A unique feature of this cyanation protocol in flow enables to cyanate a variety of sp  2  and sp carbons to produce a broad spectrum of aryl acetonitrile. It is envisaged that the OxBA based cyanation would replace existing unstable and toxic approaches as well as non&#8208;toxic cyanation using two different sources of &#8220;C&#8221; and &#8220;N&#8221; to incorporate the &#8208;CN group.</dc:description>

         <title>Asymmetric Catalytic Assembly of Triple&#8208;Columned and Multiple&#8208;Layered Chiral Folding Polymers Showing Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission (AIE)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The first chiral multi&#8208;layer 3D folding polymers have been assembled and regulated by both uniformed and differentiated aromatic chromophoric units between naphthyl piers. Screening catalysts, catalytic systems and monomers was proven to be crucial for asymmetric catalytic Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura poly&#8208;couplings for this assembly. X&#8208;ray crystallography of corresponding dimers and trimers revealed the absolute stereochemistry and the intermolecular packing pattern. Up to 61,960 M w /41,900 M n and m / z = 4317 for polymers and oligomers as confirmed by GPC and MALDI&#8208;TOF MS indicated that the present frameworks were composed of multiple layers stacked. The resulting multiple &#960;&#8208;assemblies exhibited remarkable optical properties in aggregated states (PL in solids and AIE in solutions), as well as reversible redox properties in electrochemical performance.</dc:description>

         <title>Hydrazone Photoswitches for Structural Modulation of Short Peptides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Molecules that undergo light&#8208;driven structural transformations constitute the core components in photoswitchable molecular systems and materials. Among various families of photoswitches, photochromic hydrazones have recently emerged as a novel class of photoswitches with superb properties, such as high photochemical conversion, spectral tunability, thermal stability, and fatigue resistance. Hydrazone photoswitches have been adopted in various adaptive materials at different length scales, however, their utilization for modulating biomolecules still has not been explored. Herein we present new hydrazone switches that can photomodulate the structures of short peptides. Systematic investigation on a set of hydrazone derivatives revealed that installation of the amide group does not significantly alter the photoswitching behaviors. Importantly, a hydrazone switch comprising an upper phenyl ring and a lower quinolinyl ring was effective for structural control of peptides. We anticipate that this work, as a new milestone in the research of hydrazone switches, will open a new avenue for structural and functional control of biomolecules.</dc:description>

         <title>Selective Encapsulation and Unusual Stabilization of&#160;cis&#8208;Isomers by a Spherical Polyaromatic Cavity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>To explore new cavity functions, we herein employed&#160;  cis&#8208;trans  &#160; stereoisomers &#160; with a N=N, C=C, or C=N unit as guest indicators for a polyaromatic capsule. Thanks to the rigid, spherical cavity with a diameter of ~1 nm, azobenzene and stilbene derivatives are quantitatively encapsulated by the capsule with 100%&#160;  cis  &#8208;selectivity in water. The isomerization of the&#160;  cis  &#8208;azo compound is suppressed against heat and light in the cavity, due to the confinement effect. Furthermore,&#160;  C,N  &#8208;diphenyl imine derivatives are quantitatively encapsulated by the capsule in water and adopt an otherwise unstable&#160;  cis  &#8208;form. The polyaromatic cavity suppresses the hydrolysis of the imines in water, even at elevated temperature, due to the shielding effect. Accordingly, the properties of the&#160;  cis&#8208;trans  &#160; isomers &#160;could be largely altered through supramolecular manipulation.</dc:description>

         <title>Heteropolymetallic Architectures as Snapshots of Transmetallation Processes at Different Degrees of Transfer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Novel heteropolymetallic architectures have been built by integrating Pd, Au and Ag systems. The dinuclear [(CNC)(PPh 3 )Pd&#8208; G11 M(PPh 3 )](ClO 4 ) ( G11 M = Au ( 3 ), Ag ( 4 ); CNC = 2,6&#8208;diphenylpyridinate) and trinuclear [{(CNC)(PPh 3 )Pd} 2 G11 M](ClO 4 ) ( G11 M = Au ( 6 ), Ag ( 5 )) complexes have been accessed or isolated. Structural and DFT characterization unveil striking interactions of one of the aryl groups of the CNC ligand(s) with the G11 M center, suggesting these complexes constitute models of transmetallation processes. Further analyses allow to qualitatively order the degree of transfer, proving that Au promotes the highest one and also that Pd systems favor higher degrees than Pt. Consistently, Energy Decomposition Analysis calculations show that the interaction energies follow the order Pd&#8208;Au &gt; Pt&#8208;Au &gt; Pd&#8208;Ag &gt; Pt&#8208;Ag. All these results offer potentially useful ideas for the design of bimetallic catalytic systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Computational Insights on Allosteric Effect and Dynamic Structural Feature of SARS&#8208;COV&#8208;2 Spike Protein</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>COVID&#8208;19 caused by SARS&#8208;COV&#8208;2 is currently continuing to surge globally. The spike (S) protein is the key protein of SARS&#8208;COV&#8208;2 that recognizes and binds to the host target ACE2. In this study, molecular dynamics simulation was used to elucidate the allosteric effect of S protein. The binding of ACE2 caused a centripetal movement of the receptor&#8208;binding domain of the S protein. The dihedral changes of Phe329 and Phe515 played a key role in this process. Two potential cleavage sites S1/S2 and S2' were exposed on the surface after the binding of ACE2. The binding affinity of SARS&#8208;COV&#8208;2 S protein and ACE2 was significantly higher than that of SARS&#8208;COV. This was mainly due to the mutation of Asp480 in SARS&#8208;COV to Ser494 in SARS&#8208;COV&#8208;2, which greatly weakened the electrostatic repulsion. The result provides theoretical basis for the SARS&#8208;COV&#8208;2 infection and aids the development of biosensors and detection reagents.</dc:description>

         <title>Hierarchical Modulation on Optical Anisotropy Driven by Metal Cation Polyhedra in Fluorooxoborates MIIB4O6F2 (MII = Be, Mg, Pb, Zn, Cd)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The enhancement mechanism of birefringence is very important to modulate optical anisotropy and materials design. Herein, the different cations extending from alkaline&#8208;earth to alkaline&#8208;earth,  d  10  electron configuration, and 6s  2  lone pair cations are highlighted to explore the influence on the birefringence. A flexible fluorooxoborate framework  from AEB  4  O  6  F  2  (AE = Ca, Sr) is adopted for UV/deep&#8208;UV birefringent structures, namely, M  II  B  4  O  6  F  2  (M  II  = Be, Mg, Pb, Zn, Cd). The maximal enhancement on birefringence can reach 46.6% with the cation substitution from Ca, Sr to Be, Mg (  route&#8208;I  ), Pb (route&#8208;II), and Zn, Cd (route&#8208;III). The influence of the cation size, the stereochemically active lone pair, and the binding capability of metal cation polyhedra is investigated for the hierarchical improvement on birefringence. Significantly, the BeB  4  O  6  F  2  structure features the shortest UV cutoff edge 146 nm among the available anhydrous beryllium borates with birefringence over 0.1 at 1064 nm  ,  and the PbB  4  O  6  F  2  structure has the shortest UV cutoff edge 194 nm within the reported anhydrous lead borates that hold birefringence larger than 0.1 at 1064 nm. This work sheds light on how metal cation polyhedra modulate birefringence, which suggests a credible design strategy to obtain desirable birefringent structures by cation control.</dc:description>

         <title>Probing the Lewis Acidity of Boronic Acids through Interactions with Arene Substituents</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Boronic acids are Lewis acids that exist in equilibrium with boronate forms in aqueous solution. Here we experimentally and computationally investigated the Lewis acidity of 2,6&#8208;diarylphenylboronic acids, specially designed phenylboronic acids that possess two flanking aromatic rings with tunable aromatic character. Hammett analysis of 2,6diarylphenylboronic acids reveals that their Lewis acidity remains unchanged upon the introduction of EWG/EDG at the distant para position of the flanking aromatic rings. Structural and computational studies demonstrate that polar&#8211;&#960; interactions and solvation effects contribute to the stabilization of boronic acids and boronate forms by aromatic rings. Our physical&#8208;organic chemistry work highlights that boronic acids and boronates can be stabilized by aromatic systems, leading to an important molecular knowledge for rational design and development of boronic acid&#8208;based catalysts and inhibitors of biomedically important proteins.</dc:description>

         <title>C(spn)&#8211;X (n = 1&#8211;3) Bond Activation by Palladium</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We have studied the palladium&#8208;mediated activation of&#160;C(  sp  n  )&#8211;X&#160;bonds (n = 1&#8211;3 and X = H, CH  3  , Cl) in archetypal model substrates H  3  C&#8211;CH  2  &#8211;X, H  2  C=CH&#8211;X and HC&#8801;C&#8211;X by catalysts PdL  n  &#160;with L  n  &#160;= no ligand, Cl  &#8211;  , and (PH  3  )  2  , using relativistic density functional theory at ZORA&#8208;BLYP/TZ2P. The oxidative addition barrier decreases along this series, even though the strength of the bonds increases&#160;going from&#160;C(  sp  3  )&#8211;X, to&#160;C(  sp  2  )&#8211;X, to&#160;C(  sp  )&#8211;X. Activation strain and matching energy decomposition analyses reveal that the decreased oxidative addition barrier going from&#160;  sp  3  &#160;to&#160;  sp  2  &#160;to&#160;  sp  , originates from a reduction in the destabilizing steric (Pauli) repulsion between catalyst and substrate. This is the direct consequence of the decreasing coordination number of the carbon atom in&#160;C(  sp  n  )&#8211;X, which goes from four, to three, to two&#160;along this series. The associated net stabilization of the catalyst&#8211;substrate interaction dominates the trend in strain energy which indeed becomes more destabilizing along this same series as the bond becomes stronger from&#160;C(  sp  3  )&#8211;X&#160;to&#160;C(  sp  )&#8211;X.</dc:description>

         <title>Understanding the Influence of Donor&#8208;Acceptor Diazo Compounds on the Catalyst Efficiency of B(C6F5)3 Towards Carbene Formation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Abstract:  Diazo compounds have been largely used for carbene transfer reactions in a variety of functionalization reactions. Recently, tris(pentafluorophenyl)borane [B(C  6  F  5  )  3  ] has been shown to be an efficient metal&#8208;free catalyst for carbene transfer reactions. Herein, we report a  Density Functional Theory  (DFT) study on the generation of carbene species from &#945;&#8208;aryl &#945;&#8208;diazocarbonyl compounds using catalytic amounts of B(C  6  F  5  )  3  . We observe that the efficiency of the catalyst depends directly on the nature of the substituents on both the aryl ring and the carbonyl group of the substrate. In some cases, we observe that the boron catalyst has negligible effect on the ease of the carbene formation, while in other cases there is a dramatic reduction in the activation energy of the reaction. This direct dependence is not commonly observed in catalysis and our finding opens the way for intelligent design of this and other similar catalytic reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Develop the low&#8208;temperature oxidation mechanism&#160;of cyclopentane: an&#160;experimental&#160;and theoretical study</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>At present, the reactivity of cyclic alkanes is estimated by analogy comparison&#160;with non&#8208;cyclic hydrocarbons. Due to the difference in the structure of cycloalkanes and non&#8208;cycloalkanes, the thermodynamic data obtained by analogy is not applicable. In this study, a molecular beam sampling vacuum ultraviolet photoionization time&#8208;of&#8208;flight mass spectrometer (MB&#8208;VUV&#8208;PI&#8208;TOFMS) was applied to study the low&#8208;temperature oxidation of cyclopentane (CPT) at a total pressure range from 1&#8208;3 atm&#160;and low&#8208;temperature range between 500 K and 800&#160;K. The low&#8208;temperature reaction products including cyclic olefins, cyclic ethers, highly oxygenated intermediates (e.g., ketohydroperoxide KHP, keto&#8208;dihydroperoxide KDHP, olefinic hydroperoxides OHP and ketone structure products) were observed. Further investigation of&#160;the oxidation of CPT, the electronic structure calculations at the&#160;UCCSD(T)&#8208;F12a/aug&#8208;cc&#8208;pVDZ//B3LYP/6&#8208;31+ G(d,p)&#160;level&#160;were carried out to explore the reactivity of O2&#160;molecules adding sequentially&#160;to cyclopentyl radicals.&#160;Experimental and theoretical observations showed that the dominant product channel in the reaction of CPT radicals with O2&#160;is HO2&#160;elimination, yielding cyclopentene. The pathways of second and third O2&#160;addition, the dissociation of hydroperoxide were further confirmed. The results of this study will develop the low&#8208;temperature oxidation mechanism of CPT, which can be used for future research on accurately simulating the combustion process of CPT.</dc:description>

         <title>Tetra&#8208;substituted p&#8208;tert&#8208;butylcalix[4]arene with phosphoryl and salicylamide functional groups: synthesis, complexation and selective extraction of f&#8208;element cations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A new series of lanthanide (  1&#8208;5  ) and uranyl (  6  ) complexes with a tetra&#8208;substituted bifunctional calixarene ligand  H  2  L  is described. The coordination environment for the Ln  3+  and UO  2  2+  ions is provided by phosphoryl and salicylamide functional groups appended to the lower rim of the  p&#8208;tert  &#8208;butylcalix[4]arene scaffold. Ligand interactions with lanthanide cations (light: La  3+  , Pr  3+  ; intermediate: Eu  3+  and Gd  3+  ; and heavy: Yb  3+  ), as well as the uranyl cation (UO  2  2+  ) is examined in the solution and solid state, respectively with spectrophotometric titration and single crystal X&#8208;ray diffractometry. The ligand is fully deprotonated in the complexation of trivalent lanthanide ions forming di&#8208;cationic complexes 2:2 M:  L  , [Ln  2  (  L  )  2  (H  2  O)]  2+  (  1  &#8208;  5  ), in solution, whereas uranyl formed a 1:1 M:  L  complex [UO  2  (  L  )(MeOH)]  &#8734;  (  6  ) that demonstrated very limited solubility in 12 organic solvents. Solvent extraction behaviour is examined for cation selectivity and extraction efficiency.  H  2  L  was found to be an effective extracting agent for UO  2  2+  over La  3+  and Yb  3+  cations. The separation factors at pH 6.0 are: [[EQUATION]] = 121.0 and [[EQUATION]] = 70.0.</dc:description>

         <title>Structural Insights into Hysteretic Spin&#8208;Crossover in a Set of Iron(II)&#8208;2,6&#8208;bis(1H&#8208;pyrazol&#8208;1&#8208;yl)pyridine) Complexes</title>

         <dc:description>Bistable spin&#8208;crossover (SCO) complexes that undergo abrupt and hysteretic (&#916;  T  1/2  ) spin&#8208;state switching are desirable for molecule&#8208;based switching and memory applications. In this study, we report on the structural facets governing hysteretic SCO in a set of iron(II)&#8208;2,6&#8208;bis(1H&#8208;pyrazol&#8208;1&#8208;yl)pyridine) (bpp) complexes&#8212;[Fe(bpp&#8208;COOEt)  2  ](X)  2  &#183;CH  3  NO  2  (X = ClO  4  ,  1  ; X = BF  4  ,  2  ). Stable spin&#8208;state switching&#8212;  T  1/2  = 288 K; &#916;  T  1/2  = 62 K&#8212;is observed for  1  , whereas  2  underwent above room&#8208;temperature lattice&#8208;solvent content&#8208;dependent SCO&#8212;  T  1/2  = 331 K; &#916;  T  1/2  = 43 K. Variable temperature single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction studies of the complexes revealed pronounced molecular reorganizations&#8212;from the Jahn&#8208;Teller distorted HS&#8208;state to less distorted LS&#8208;state&#8212;and conformation switching of the ethyl group of the COOEt substituent upon SCO. Consequently, we propose that the large structural reorganizations rendered SCO hysteretic in  1  and  2  . Such insights shedding light on the molecular origin of thermal hysteresis might enable the design of technologically relevant molecule&#8208;based switching and memory elements.</dc:description>
