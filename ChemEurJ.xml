         <title>Catalytic Aerobic Oxidation of p&#8208;Methoxybenzyl (PMB) Ethers to Aldehydes or Ketones</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An efficient and highly selective aerobic oxidation of p&#8208;methoxybenzyl ethers to aldehydes or ketones with Fe(NO3)3&#8226;9H2O and TEMPO as catalysts at 25 oC has been developed. This method is compatible with versatile functional groups: adamantyl, ether, alkynyl, and alkenyl, etc. Due to the mild nature of the reaction conditions, even the highly sensitive optically active aldehydes with an easily racemized &#945;&#8208;chiral center could be formed from optically active PMB ethers without racemization. Other protecting groups of hydroxyl group remained intact during the current aerobic oxidation. The catalytic protocol has been successfully applied to synthesis of (R)&#8208;tert&#8208;butyldimethylsilyl hept&#8208;1&#8208;en&#8208;6&#8208;yn&#8208;4&#8208;yl ether, which is the key intermediate for the total synthesis of natural product, (&#8208;)&#8208;6&#8208;O&#8208;methylcitreoisocoumarin.</dc:description>

         <title>Stereoselective Synthesis of 1,2&#8208;cis O&#8208;linked Glycosyl Amino Acids via Additive&#8208;Modulation for Glycopeptide Synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A highly stereoselective strategy to facilitate the synthesis of 1,2&#8208;cis&#8208;O&#8208;linked glycosyl amino acids was established via a additive&#8208;modulated trichloroacetimidate&#160;glycosylation approach. This mild and practical protocol demonstrates broad applicability with diverse glycosyl donors, including D&#8208;gluco&#8208;, D&#8208;galacto&#8208;, 2&#8208;deoxy&#8208;2&#8208;azido&#8208;D&#8208;gluco&#8208;, 2&#8208;deoxy&#8208;2&#8208;azido&#8208;D&#8208;galacto&#8208;, D&#8208;xylo&#8208;, L&#8208;fuco&#8208;pyranosyl and L&#8208;arabinofuranosyl trichloroacetimidates, and orthogonally protected amino acids such as Ser, Thr, Tyr, and 4&#8208;hydroxyproline (Hyp) as acceptors. These 1,2&#8208;cis linked glycosyl amino acids serve as valuable building blocks for glycopeptide synthesis via solid&#8208;phase peptide synthesis (SPPS), offering significant potential for advancing glycoprotein research.</dc:description>

         <title>Tuning the Efficiency of Iridium(III) Eomplexes for Energy Transfer (EnT) Eatalysis through Ligand Design</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photoactive Iridium(III) complexes are a popular synthetic tool. The impact of ligand design on their photoredox properties has been widely studied, but similar approaches to develop more potent photosensitizers are still absent. We report herein the preparation, characterization and catalytic application of a new family of Iridium(III) complexes that proved superior to their widely&#8208;used commercial peers. The best results were observed when naphthyl pendants were installed to the ligands, which could stabilize the triplet intermediates involved in energy&#8208;transfer reactions via radical&#8208;p dispersion interactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrochemical Removal Of Doxycycline Hydrochloride With Cerium&#8208;aluminum Catalytic&#160;Anode</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Doxycycline hydrochloride (DOX) is a widely used broad&#8208;spectrum antibiotic that is challenging to degrade, leading to a series of environmental issues. In this study, a bimetallic oxide catalyst was synthesized through hydrothermal calcination followed by annealing. The catalytic carbon cloth anode was fabricated by bonding materials directly onto carbon cloth. Various characterization methods were employed to analyze the surface morphology, composition, and electrochemical properties of the electrodes. The materials exhibited rich surface morphology and exceptional electrochemical surface area. The catalyst primarily consisted of CeO2 and CeAlO3, demonstrating a 93.85% removal efficiency of DOX within 2 hours under optimized conditions. Even after seven consecutive degradation cycles, the DOX degradation rate remained at 82%, confirming the remarkable stability of the electrodes. The product distribution generated during the degradation of DOX was identified using LC&#8208;MS analysis, and a potential electrochemical degradation mechanism was proposed. Our results indicate that the bimetallic hybrid coordination significantly enhances the catalytic activity and electrochemical stability of the materials. This work offers a novel approach for preparing modified carbon cloth anodes with high catalytic activity and durability, laying a crucial foundation for the efficient degradation of the antibiotic DOX.</dc:description>

         <title>Pt(II) Complexes Showing Multicolor Emissions from Nanoparticles in Solution and Reversible Grinding&#8208; and Heating&#8208;Induced Luminescence Switching in Solid State</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The emission color of complex [Pt(moppy)Cl(icna)] shows progressive redshift when the water fraction of a CH3CN&#8208;H2O mixture gradually increases from 0% to 90%. This shift is attributed to the formation of nanoparticles that facilitate inter&#8208;molecular Pt&#8208;Pt interaction and possible &#960;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; interaction. Moreover, this complex exhibits reversible solid&#8208;state luminescence switching upon alternately grinding and heating, mainly due to the alternating formation and destruction of inter&#8208;molecular Pt&#8208;Pt interactions.&gt;







Abstract
To well understand luminescence modulation of Pt(II) complexes by inter&#8208;molecular interactions, three platinum complexes [Pt(moppy)Cl(L)] have been synthesized (Scheme&#8197;1) through incorporating the same C^N ligand moppyH=2&#8208;(4&#8208;methoxyphenyl)pyridine, while different auxillary ligands L: SEt2 in 1, iccy=isocyanocyclohexane in 2, and icna=isocyanonaphthalene in 3. Crystal structures indicate that neighbouring molecules are connected through &#960;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; interactions, forming supramolecular dimer structures in both 1 and 2, while supramolecular chain structure in 3. In a CH3CN&#8208;H2O mixed solvent, complexes 1&#8211;3 reveal enhanced luminescence due to nanoparticle formation. Upon increasing water fraction from 0&#8201;% to 90&#8201;%, complex 1 exhibits increasing green luminescence with two broad emissions at 450 and 516&#8197;nm. In contrast, both 2 and 3 show multicolour emissions, transiting from blue to yellow&#8208;green for 2, and from blue green to orange red for 3. Moreover, complex 3 exhibits reversible luminescence switching between on state with orange&#8208;red emission and off state upon alternately grinding and heating. In this paper, we discuss the influences of molecular structures and inter&#8208;molecular &#960;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; and Pt&#8722;Pt interactions on luminescence behaviours of complexes 1&#8211;3.

         <title>Delayed fluorescence and room temperature phosphorescence from a liquid arene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>

         <title>Tailored Nucleation&#8208;Growth Strategy for Precise Self&#8208;Assembly of Block Copolymers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Concept summarizes the recent advances in the precise and controllable self&#8208;assembly of block copolymers (BCPs) through a tailored nucleation&#8208;growth strategy. The self&#8208;assembly behavior of BCPs can be modulated via either small&#8208;molecule or macromolecular approach to prepare uniform homogeneous and heterogeneous nanostructures in a highly controllable manner.







Abstract
The self&#8208;assembly of block copolymers (BCPs) to form nanostructures of various morphologies and controllable dimensions has been a very promising research area in nanotechnology in recent decades. This concept mainly summarizes the recent advances in precise and controllable self&#8208;assembly of BCPs through a tailored nucleation&#8208;growth strategy to modulate the self&#8208;assembly behavior of the BCPs. These efforts have led to a better understanding of the self&#8208;assembly mechanisms and opened new possibilities for creating novel materials with designable properties. We hope that the concept is more than a periodical summary of previous research work and can provide valuable inspiration for the research field.

         <title>Continuous Flow Synthesis of &#946;&#8208;Aminoketones as Masked Vinyl Ketone Equivalents</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report an efficient and scalable method for the generation of &#946;&#8208;aminoketones from amides and Grignard reagents. The continuous process operates at elevated temperatures and uses a plate&#8208;based reactor exploiting a hydrophobic internal coating to avoid reactor fouling issues due to the heterogeneous reaction mixture. The unmasking of the &#946;&#8208;aminoketone products giving valuable vinyl ketones is demonstrated.







Abstract
Herein we report the efficient synthesis of &#946;&#8208;aminoketones via addition of a vinyl Grignard reagent into amides followed by trapping of the vinyl ketone intermediate with the magnesium&#8208;amide by&#8208;product. The reaction was successfully translated from a batch process into continuous flow mode to increase its efficiency, safety and scalability. Different set&#8208;ups were evaluated to minimize/overcome clogging issues arising from magnesium salt precipitates. Ultimately, the resulting &#946;&#8208;aminoketones were obtained in high yields and productivities with residence times of less than 90&#8197;seconds at elevated temperatures of 50&#8201;&#176;C. Importantly, the &#946;&#8208;aminoketone products are valuable building blocks that can be unmasked to reactive vinyl ketones via a Cope elimination process.

         <title>Structural Revision and Total Synthesis of Primarolides A and B via Massarinin A as a Common Precursor &#8211; Discovery of a Surprising 1,4&#8208;Aryl Shift</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Surprising reactivity of a natural product: A rare 1,4&#8208;aryl migration was identified as key step in the conversion of massarinin A into primarolide A. Only with the help of chemical synthesis was it possible to elucidate the correct structures of primarolides A and B, originally isolated from a marine fungus, and to prove the possibility of their non&#8208;enzymatic formation as racemates in nature.







Abstract
To probe the possible non&#8208;enzymatic formation of the polyketidic fungal metabolites primarolides A and B, the supposed 2&#8208;formyl&#8208;benzophenone precursor was prepared by chemical synthesis exploiting an anionic homo&#8208;Fries rearrangement to set up the highly substituted benzophenone unit. Conversion of this compound into the putative primarolides (i.&#8201;e. the isomeric phthalide and the corresponding N&#8208;phenyl&#8208;isoindolinone) revealed that the proposed structures had to be revised. Subsequently, the natural product massarinin A, which displays a similar 2&#8208;formyl&#8208;benzophenone substructure, was synthesized following a related strategy. Treatment of massarinin A with Sc(OTf)3 or cyanide as a nucleophilic catalyst unexpectedly proceeded under 1,4&#8208;aryl migration to afford primarolide A. In contrast, reaction of massarinin A with aniline gave rise to primarolide B without aryl shift. All structural assignments were confirmed by X&#8208;ray crystal analysis and the proposed mechanism of the skeletal rearrangement was supported by 13C labeling. The study not only led to the total synthesis and structural revision of the primarolides but also supports the hypothesis of their non&#8208;enzymatic formation as racemates under the reported fermentation conditions, with the added suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA) likely serving as the source of aniline.

Dimethylmethylene&#8208;bridged N&#8208;heterotriangulene with lateral diaminotriazinyl groups was developed as a versatile building block for robust self&#8208;assembly via self&#8208;complementary hydrogen bonding under ambient conditions.

Abstract
We report the synthesis and comprehensive characterization of a dimethylmethylene&#8208;bridged N&#8208;heterotriangulene (N&#8208;HTA) with diaminotriazinyl groups to guide the self&#8208;assembly through directional hydrogen bonding. Mass spectrometry collision&#8208;induced dissociation experiments indicated the formation of multiply charged clusters in the gas phase. Single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction studies revealed that the solid state packing is governed by an interplay between the hydrogen bonding and the solvent system used for crystallization. The self&#8208;assembly on both semiconducting and insulating surfaces upon simple drop&#8208;casting was disclosed by atomic force microscopy and scanning tunneling microscopy. The strong hydrogen bonding leads to robust self&#8208;assembly on surfaces, which can be conveniently achieved by simple solution processing techniques under ambient conditions.

         <title>Regulating the Cytotoxicity of Anticancer Drugs by Pillar[6]arene&#8208;based Host&#8208;Guest Complex</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pillar[6]arene forms a stable host&#8208;guest complex with chlorambucil, exhibiting a dual pH/ATP response. This complex can not only effectively release chlorambucil to reduce cytotoxicity to normal cells but also consume ATP, thereby synergistically enhancing the antitumor performance against cancer cells. Designing ATP&#8208;stimulated host&#8208;guest complexes based on pillar[6]arene represents a promising strategy for tumor therapy.







Abstract
Creating molecular&#8208;level host&#8208;guest complexes with properties responsive to endogenous substance stimuli&#8208;responsive as drug delivery systems, is critical for improving drug stability, reducing side effects, and amplifying therapeutic efficacy. Herein, a delivery system for the chemotherapeutic drug chlorambucil (CLB) was developed using the host&#8208;guest interaction with amino&#8208;pillar[6]arene (NP6). NP6 exhibits a high affinity for CLB (Ka=3.5&#215;103&#8197;M&#8722;1), resulting in a 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 host&#8208;guest complex NP6@CLB. This complex not only effectively prevents premature drug leakage and improves drug stability but also significantly reduces the cytotoxicity of CLB on L&#8208;02 cells. Notably, NP6 also demonstrated superior complexation (Ka=3.6&#215;103&#8197;M&#8722;1) with ATP, an endogenous substance in cells. During NP6@CLB delivery, ATP can compete with CLB to form a host&#8208;guest complex with NP6. This process blocks drug efflux while releasing CLB, thereby synergistically enhancing the antitumor effects on HeLa cells.

     alt="Regulating the Cytotoxicity of Anticancer Drugs by Pillar[6]arene-based Host-Guest Complex"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pillar[6]arene forms a stable host-guest complex with chlorambucil, exhibiting a dual pH/ATP response. This complex can not only effectively release chlorambucil to reduce cytotoxicity to normal cells but also consume ATP, thereby synergistically enhancing the antitumor performance against cancer cells. Designing ATP-stimulated host-guest complexes based on pillar[6]arene represents a promising strategy for tumor therapy.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Creating molecular-level host-guest complexes with properties responsive to endogenous substance stimuli-responsive as drug delivery systems, is critical for improving drug stability, reducing side effects, and amplifying therapeutic efficacy. Herein, a delivery system for the chemotherapeutic drug chlorambucil (CLB) was developed using the host-guest interaction with amino-pillar[6]arene (NP6). NP6 exhibits a high affinity for CLB (Ka=3.5&#215;10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&#8197;M&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;), resulting in a 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 host-guest complex NP6@CLB. This complex not only effectively prevents premature drug leakage and improves drug stability but also significantly reduces the cytotoxicity of CLB on L-02 cells. Notably, NP6 also demonstrated superior complexation (Ka=3.6&#215;10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&#8197;M&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) with ATP, an endogenous substance in cells. During NP6@CLB delivery, ATP can compete with CLB to form a host-guest complex with NP6. This process blocks drug efflux while releasing CLB, thereby synergistically enhancing the antitumor effects on HeLa cells. This &#8220;one stone, two birds&#8221; design strategy&#8212;where host-guest complexes facilitate both direct drug delivery and synergistic enhancement of antitumor properties via ATP binding, opens a new perspective for constructing multifunctional supramolecular chemotherapeutic platforms based on pillar[n]arene.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Structural, Physicochemical, and Biological Insights into Novel (Acetylacetonate)(Oxydiacetato)Oxidovanadium(IV) Complexes with N&#8208;Containing Aromatic Compounds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis, structure and physicochemical properties of three novel oxidovanadium salts composed of [VO(acac)(oda)]&#8722; anion (acac=acetylacetonate; oda=oxydiacetate) and quinolinium, isoquinolinium or acridinium cation is presented. The characterization is supported by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Additionally, their cytotoxic effects were assessed against breast cancer cell lines to explore their therapeutic potential in cancer treatment.







Abstract
The crystal structures of three novel oxidovanadium(IV) salts containing the [VO(acac)(oda)]&#8722; anion (acac=acetylacetonate, oda=oxydiacetate) and quinolinium ([QH]+), isoquinolinium ([(isoQ)H+) and acridinium ([(acr)H+)] counterions, of molecular formulas [QH][VO(acac)(oda)] (1), [(isoQ)H][VO(acac)(oda)](H2O) (2) and [(acr)H][VO(acac)(oda)](H2O)2 (3) are reported. Notably, these complexes represent the first structurally characterized salts comprising the heteroligand [VO(acac)(oda)]&#8722; complex anion. A comprehensive physicochemical characterization of the complexes in both solid state and solution is provided, with general discussions on the role of nitrogen&#8208;containing heterocyclic compounds on the structure of the resulting ternary oxidovanadium(IV) complexes. The experimental results were complemented by density functional theory (DFT) calculations to evaluate possible ligand conformations in the coordination sphere of V(IV). In addition, the nature of the bonds involved in the chelation of the vanadium(IV) cation is considered and a detailed assessment of the electron spin density is presented. Finally, the cytotoxic activity of the compounds was tested against breast (MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;231 and MCF&#8208;7) cancer cell lines to assess their potential use as chemotherapeutic agents in cancer therapy.

         <title>Pt Nanoparticles Loaded on Bimetallic Porphyrinic MOF for Selective Hydrogenation Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Pt NPs incorporated MOF (Pt/PCN&#8208;224 (FeCo)) with Fe/Co single atoms has been successfully fabricated. Pt/PCN&#8208;224 (FeCo) exhibited high catalytic activity in the chemoselective hydrogenation of biomass&#8208;derived furfural (FFA) to cyclopentanone (CPO). Fe/Co sites of the ligands could effectively tune the electronic properties of Pt NPs, and Co sites could synergistically promote the hydrogen spillover, thereby enhancing the catalytic activity.







Abstract
Metal nanoparticles (MNPs) loaded on metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) show promising catalytic performances in various reactions, but finely tuning the electronic properties of MNPs remains challenging. Herein, metal NP&#8208;MOF synergy has been finely regulated by incorporating Pt NPs into PCN&#8208;224 (FeCo). The as&#8208;prepared Pt/PCN&#8208;224 (FeCo) exhibited high catalytic activity in the hydrogenation of various carbonyl substrates. Detailed characterizations and mechanistic studies revealed that the Fe/Co sites of the ligands can effectively tune the electronic properties of Pt NPs, which achieved promoted capability to activate H2. The atomic hydrogen (H*) produced by Pt sites mainly migrated to the Co sites to promote the hydrogenation process via hydrogen spillover, thereby enhancing the catalytic activity. This work is devoted to a promising strategy to optimize the catalytic performance of MOF&#8208;based nanomaterials by incorporating metal NPs in the thermocatalytic systems.

         <title>Chiral N&#8208;Alkylfluorenyl&#8208;Substituted N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbenes in the Gold(I)&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective Cycloisomerization of 1,6&#8208;Enynes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Four chiral [AuCl(A*Flu&#8208;NHC)] complexes (A*Flu&#8208;NHC for 9&#8208;alkyl&#8208;9&#8208;fluorenyl N&#8208;substituted N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene) have been prepared in only four steps using commercially available enantiopure styrene oxide as chiral source. Their use as pre&#8208;catalysts in the enantioselective cycloisomerization of 1,6&#8208;enynes gave up to 72&#8201;% ee. A remarkable hydrogen bond interaction probably rigidifies the catalyst structure and optimizes the chirality transfer.







Abstract
A series of chiral A*Flu&#8208;NHC&#8208;gold(I) complexes, where A*Flu&#8208;NHC is an N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (imidazolin&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene or benzimidazolin&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene) bearing a chiral 9&#8208;alkyl&#8208;9&#8208;fluorenyl N&#8208;substituent and a 2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl or benzyl N&#8217;&#8208;substituent, were straightforwardly prepared in few steps from readily available 2,6&#8208;diisopropylamine, imidazole or benzimidazole. The chirality of the N&#8208;substituent lies in the presence of a chiral alcoholic alkyl chain on the fluorenyl, which results from the opening of commercially available chiral styrene oxide, yielding to a 2&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;2&#8208;phenylethyl or a 2&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;1&#8208;phenylethyl group. Four [AuCl(A*Flu&#8208;NHC)] complexes were tested as precatalysts in an enantioselective cycloisomerization of a 1,6&#8208;enyne. Notably, the best inductions were observed with the benzimidazolin&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene derivative bearing a 2&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;1&#8208;phenylethyl group on the fluorenyl ring, showing that a constrained rotation around the N&#8722;Cfluorenyl bond and a chiral center in &#945; position of the fluorenyl ring are determining factors. Interestingly, a strong improvement of the induction with up to 72&#8201;% ee was observed using AgOTf as activator. The presence of a hydrogen bond between the hydroxyl group and OTf&#8722; in the in&#8197;situ generated active cationic gold(I) species probably stiffens its structure. This type of ligand&#8208;counteranion interaction represents a novel strategy for optimizing chirality transfer in asymmetric gold(I) catalysis.

         <title>Recent Advances on Organic Scintillators with High Exciton Utilization Efficiency for X&#8208;Ray Scintillation and Imaging</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
New classes of organic scintillators have recently attracted significant attention for X&#8208;ray scintillation and imaging. This concept article explores new&#8208;generation organic scintillators, focusing on molecular design strategies, emission mechanisms, scintillation performance and their applications in X&#8208;ray imaging.







Abstract
Organic scintillators have rapidly emerged in recent years for X&#8208;ray scintillation and imaging, benefiting from their inherent advantages of abundant raw materials, low&#8208;temperature processing, high mechanical flexibility, and easy of large&#8208;scale fabrication. However, conventional organic scintillators suffer from weak X&#8208;ray absorption and inefficient exciton utilization, limiting their commercial viability. To overcome these challenges, new&#8208;generation organic scintillators have recently been developed with innovative emission mechanisms to ensure exciton utilization efficiency and the incorporation of heavy atoms to improve X&#8208;ray absorption. In recent years, these advancements have led to remarkable progress in high&#8208;performance X&#8208;ray scintillation and imaging. Here, we present a concept article on new&#8208;generation organic scintillators with high exciton utilization efficiency, focusing on molecular design, emission mechanisms, scintillation performance, and X&#8208;ray imaging applications. We also discuss future development trends in organic X&#8208;ray scintillators.

To overcome these challenges, new-generation organic scintillators have recently been developed with innovative emission mechanisms to ensure exciton utilization efficiency and the incorporation of heavy atoms to improve X-ray absorption. In recent years, these advancements have led to remarkable progress in high-performance X-ray scintillation and imaging. Here, we present a concept article on new-generation organic scintillators with high exciton utilization efficiency, focusing on molecular design, emission mechanisms, scintillation performance, and X-ray imaging applications. We also discuss future development trends in organic X-ray scintillators.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Benzo&#8208;Fused Phosphepines: Synthesis by Gold(I)&#8208;Catalyzed Intramolecular Hydroarylation and Ring Inversion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A gold(I)&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular hydroarylation reaction of dialkynyl(biaryl)phosphine oxides afforded two diastereomers of phosphepines, O&#8208;exo adducts (major) and O&#8208;endo adducts (minor). The interconversion between these isomers via a ring inversion of phosphepine with a planar structure was also investigated experimentally and theoretically.







Abstract
Gold(I)&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular hydroarylation of dialkynyl(biaryl)phosphine oxides provided versatile benzo&#8208;fused phosphepine oxides. O&#8208;exo adducts were obtained as the major product, and O&#8208;endo adducts were the minor product. O&#8208;exo and O&#8208;endo indicate the position of an oxygen atom with respect to the central phosphepine framework. The isomers of dibenzo[b,d]phosphepine oxides with methyl and phenyl groups in an adjacent position (shown as 2&#8201;a and 3&#8201;a in the main text) were determined by X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis. O&#8208;exo and O&#8208;endo adducts are diastereomers owing to the central chirality of the phosphorus atom and the planar chirality of phosphepine, and they are interconverted through a ring inversion of phosphepine via a transition state with a planar structure. The inversion barrier, fully estimated through theoretical calculations, drastically varied depending on the substituents in the phosphepine framework and/or the fusion of benzene and thiophene rings. Furthermore, the kinetics of the thermal isomerization of less stable O&#8208;endo product 3&#8201;a into O&#8208;exo product 2&#8201;a was examined.

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light Photoredox Catalytic Direct N&#8208;(Het)Arylation of Lactams</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lactam rings can be introduced to a diverse range of arenes and heteroarenes employing our mild and efficient photoredox method. The N&#8208;(het)arylation of lactams also works in aqueous media, allowing the functionalization of biomolecules. Moreover, the photochemical reaction can be easily scaled under continuous flow conditions, making it suitable for large&#8208;scale applications.







Abstract
Lactam rings are essential structural motifs in organic chemistry, widely present in natural products and clinically important drugs, such as antibiotics and antiepileptics. Existing methods for synthesizing N&#8208;functionalized lactams often require harsh conditions, toxic reagents, or complex catalytic systems. Here, we report a mild and efficient photochemical approach for generating N&#8208;centered radicals, enabling straightforward N&#8208;heteroarylation of lactams. This versatile method enables the synthesis of a range of N&#8208;(het)arylated lactams and is effective even in aqueous media, facilitating the functionalization of biomolecules. Furthermore, the photochemical reaction is easily scalable under continuous flow conditions, making it highly suitable for large&#8208;scale applications.

         <title>The Next Generation of Phosphorus Bisylide Superbases &#8211; Synthesis, Structures, Basicity and Proton Self&#8208;Exchange</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
On the search for the most basic proton sponge ever described the effects of stronger donating pyrrolidino vs. dimethylamino P&#8208;substituents as well as the homologisation of previously described bis phosphorus ylide base MHPN is investigated by synthesis, spectroscopy, crystallography, pKaH measurements and DFT calculations.







Abstract
Herein we present two phosphorus ylide superbases to enhance the basicity of 1,8&#8208;bis (methylylidene (hexamethyltriamino) phosphorane) naphthalene (MHPN) &#8211; the first superbase with interacting carbon atoms as basicity centers. Its 1&#8208;pyrrolidinyl substituted analog 1,8&#8208;bis (methylylidene (tris (1&#8208;pyrrolidinyl)) phosphorane) naphthalene (MTPN) and MHPN's theoretically predicted higher homologue P2&#8208;MHPN exhibit extreme pKaH values of 26.0 and 29.5 (experimental) in THF solution and 33.6 and 37.4 (estimated) in acetonitrile solution. The corresponding calculated gas phase basicity values are 281.4 and 284.6&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1, respectively. We prepared the neutral free bases together with the corresponding mono&#8208; and bisprotonated species which were characterized by NMR spectroscopy, ESI mass spectrometry, IR spectroscopy, elemental analysis and partly XRD analysis. The monoprotonated forms exhibit a rapid proton self&#8208;exchange between the two carbon atoms in peri&#8208;position and dynamic NMR spectroscopic methods revealed self&#8208;exchange rates of 2298&#8197;s&#8722;1 and 300&#8197;s&#8722;1 at 300&#8197;K for MTPN and P2&#8208;MHPN, respectively. However, computational studies reveal that the proton chelating effect, which typically considerably contributes to the basicity of proton sponges with basicity centers on nitrogen, is negligible in bisylides, as the 1,8&#8208;substitution pattern yields almost the same basicity as the corresponding 2,7&#8208; or 1,5&#8208;substituted analogues.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Thermoelectric materials, capable of directly converting heat into electricity, offer significant potential for advancing renewable energy solutions. However, conventional thermoelectric materials, typically based on bulky structures, are constrained by the thermoelectric transport paradox. Metal&#8208;backboned polymers, emerging as one&#8208;dimensional materials designed at the single atom level, offer quantum confinement that enhances electrical conductivity while reducing thermal conductivity, potentially overcoming the above limitations. Herein, we explore the potential of metal&#8208;backboned polymers for the development of highly efficient thermoelectric materials, including their synthesis, structural advantages, potential applications and recent advancements. Moreover, current challenges and promising directions for further advancing their performance and applicability in eco&#8208;friendly energy technologies are also discussed.</dc:description>

         <title>Reaction of a Potassium Aluminyl with Sn[N(SiMe3)2]2 &#8208; Isolation of a Stable, Trimetallic Sn(I) Radical Anion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The reaction of the potassium aluminyl K[Al(NON)] ([NON]2&#8211; = [O(SiMe2NDipp)2]2&#8211;, Dipp = 2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3) with the stannylene Sn[N(SiMe3)2]2 in benzene afforded K3[(Sn4){Al(NON)}2{N(SiMe3)2}], containing a distorted tetrahedral Sn4&#8208;cluster. Computational analysis indicates that four of the edges in this unit are composed of Sn&#8211;Sn bonds, with the remaining two that are spanned by aluminium involved in three centre two electron (3c2e) Sn&#8211;Al&#8211;Sn bonds. The formation of Al(II) species during this reaction is indicated by the isolation of the dialuminated cyclohexadiene 1,4&#8208;[Al(NON)]2(&#956;&#8208;C6H6). Repeating the reaction in methylcyclohexane generated a thermally stable, trimetallic Sn(I) radical anion in K[Sn{Al(NON)}2]. Compared to all other reported Sn(I) radicals, its EPR spectrum is unique; the main turning points of its spectrum appear at g values above 2 and the Sn hyperfine coupling is substantially smaller in magnitude. These data, together with ENDOR measurements and DFT calculations show that the SOMO is entirely localised in an unhybridised 5p orbital, such that spin&#8208;orbit contributions to the g and Sn hyperfine tensors are quenched.</dc:description>

These data, together with ENDOR measurements and DFT calculations show that the SOMO is entirely localised in an unhybridised 5p orbital, such that spin-orbit contributions to the g and Sn hyperfine tensors are quenched.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Monitoring On&#8208;Surface Chemical Reactions by Low&#8208;Energy Electron Microscopy: from Conformation Change to Ring Closure in 2D Molecular Gas</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>On&#8208;surface synthesis is a promising strategy for the preparation of molecules that are not achievable otherwise. Understanding the mechanism of on&#8208;surface reactions requires knowledge of the molecular structure and possible organization of reactants into supramolecular assemblies during the reaction. Scanning probe techniques are essential for the unambiguous identification of the products and for determining their electronic and magnetic properties. However, these are generally not capable of imaging the surface at reaction conditions and, therefore, answering some of the key questions about the reaction mechanism. Here, we show that real&#8208;time low&#8208;energy electron microscopy &#160;can monitor the surface processes in real time and provide the necessary complementary mechanistic insights into on&#8208;surface reactions. We monitor the intramolecular ring&#8208;closure reaction of 1,3,5&#8208;tris(7&#8208;methyl&#8208;&#945;&#8208;carbolin&#8208;6&#8208;yl)benzene on the Au(111) surface and show that it takes place in the 2D molecular gas phase at elevated temperatures. Products condense into separate islands upon cooling, enabling fast and efficient assessment of product yields. This makes LEEM an efficient tool for studying intramolecular chemical reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Bio&#8208;Based Surfactants via Borrowing Hydrogen Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A borrowing hydrogen approach to produce bio&#8208;based surfactants is described. Using amino acids and common alcohols without protecting groups, surfactants are synthesized in one step with a ruthenium catalyst, achieving nearly ideal atom economy, including Gemini surfactants and a quaternary ammonia salt, with remarkable surfactant properties and potential biodegradability, enhancing the broad application profile of these sustainable products.







Abstract
A borrowing hydrogen approach to produce bio&#8208;based surfactants is described. The process utilizes ubiquitous amino acids and common alcohols without protecting group manipulations. Surfactants are synthesized in a single step using a commercially available ruthenium&#8208;based catalyst in a waste&#8208;free manner with nearly ideal atom economy. The versatility of the products is shown by further derivatization resulting in novel Gemini surfactants and a related quaternary ammonia salt. The analysis of selected compounds shows remarkable properties as surfactants. Further studies show their potential biodegradability in nature, which enhances the broad application profile of the sustainable products prepared in this study.

         <title>The Lassa Virus Stable Signal Peptide Undergoes a Conformational Change to Aid Viral Fusion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A critical event in the lifecycle of the Lassa virus (LASV) is membrane fusion, where the viral membrane merges with the host cell membrane. This process is initiated by the LASV surface glycoprotein complex (GPC) upon exposure to the acidic environment of the endocytic pathway. A unique aspect of the GPC is the stable signal peptide (SSP), located adjacent to the transmembrane region of glycoprotein 2 (GP2), the primary fusion subunit. While previous research has established the importance of SSP in fusion, its precise role has not been fully understood due to limited biophysical data. Our study aims to elucidate SSP's role by examining its structural changes under different pH conditions. At neutral pH (pH 7), SSP is primarily &#945;&#8208;helical corresponding to its prefusion state. However, when exposed to acidic conditions (pH &lt; 5), mimicking the late endosome, SSP undergoes a conformational change, increasing its helical content. Furthermore, we show that this structural change enhances fusion efficiency, indicating a direct involvement of SSP in facilitating membrane fusion. In conclusion, our findings suggest that SSP undergoes a critical conformational change at low pH, essential for its role in the LASV fusion mechanism, thereby deepening our understanding of LASV fusion.</dc:description>

         <title>Fragment&#8208;Based Approach for Hierarchical Nanotube Assembly of Small Molecules in Aqueous Phase</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A fragment&#8208;based approach has proven successful in drug design and protein assemblies, yet its potential for constructing biomaterials from simple organic building blocks remains underexplored, particularly for self&#8208;assembly in aqueous phases, where water disrupts intermolecular hydrogen bonding. This study introduces the first case of integrating fragments from self&#8208;assembling molecules to design a small organic molecule that forms novel hierarchical nanotubes with polymorphism. The molecule's compact design incorporates three structural motifs derived from known nanotube assemblies, enabling a hierarchical assembly process: individual molecules with two conformations form dimers, which organize into hexameric units. These hexamers further assemble into nanotubes comprising 2&#8208;, 5&#8208;, and 6&#8208;protofilament fibers. The nanofibers share a nearly identical asymmetric unit&#8212;a hexameric triangular plate&#8212;with similar axial and lateral interfaces. The lateral interface, involving interactions between phosphate groups and aromatic rings, exhibits plasticity, allowing slight rotational variations between adjacent units. This adaptability facilitates the formation of diverse nanofiber architectures, showcasing the flexibility of these systems in aqueous environments. By leveraging fragments of self&#8208;assembling molecules, this work demonstrates a straightforward strategy that combines conformational flexibility and self&#8208;assembling fragments to construct advanced supramolecular biomaterials from small organic building blocks in aqueous settings.</dc:description>

         <title>Computational Study of Alkyne&#8208;Acid Cycloisomerization in Gold&#8208;Functionalized Resorcinarene Cavitand</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we report density functional theory calculations to investigate the reaction mechanism and the selectivity of the cycloisomerization of alkynoic acids inside a gold&#8208;functionalized resorcinarene&#8208;based cavitand. This cavitand has experimentally been shown to catalyze the cycloisomerization of a number of substituted alkynoic acids to give the corresponding &#947;&#8208;lactones. Three representative substrates, with different substitution patterns, are considered in the calculations, and for each of them, the geometries and energies of various binding modes are first characterized. Next, the cycloisomerization reaction mechanism is evaluated, which is shown to consist of an intramolecular addition of the carboxylic acid to the gold&#8208;activated alkyne triple bond, followed by a protodeauration step. Both 5&#8208;exo&#173;&#8208;dig and 6&#8208;endo&#8208;dig cyclizations were considered, leading to &#947;&#8208; or &#7839;&#8208;lactones, respectively, and the involvement of the triflate counterion in the cyclization step is discussed. Finally, the influence of the cavitand walls on the reactivity is evaluated by using a model catalyst in which the walls were removed.</dc:description>

         <title>Ba2BP7N14 &#8212; A Quaternary Alkaline Earth Nitridoborophosphate with a Mixed 3D Network Structure</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Highly condensed alkaline earth nitridophosphates have attracted increasing scientific interest, due to their high thermal and chemical stability, as well as their promising luminescence behavior upon doping with Eu2+ for pc&#8208;LED applications. In particular, the barely explored mixed tetrahedra&#8208;based nitridophosphates offer a wide range of structural and compositional diversity, enabling new insights into structure&#8208;property relationships. Herein, we report on the first quaternary alkaline earth nitridoborophosphate Ba2BP7N14, synthesized at 8 GPa and 1600 &#176;C in a multianvil press, starting from Ba(N3)2, h&#8208;BN and P3N5. Ba2BP7N14 crystallizes in the barylite&#8208;1O polytype and features a highly condensed mixed (B,P)&#8211;N anionic 3D network (&#954; &#8776; 0.57) built up of PN4 and mixed occupied (P0.75B0.25)N4 tetrahedra. The structure was characterized by a multi&#8208;step process involving single&#8208;crystal and powder X&#8208;ray diffraction (SCXRD, PXRD), elemental analysis, electron microscopy (STEM, EELS), and solid&#8208;state 31P and 11B MAS NMR spectroscopy. The plausibility of the structural model was corroborated by low&#8208;cost crystallographic calculations. The optical band gap and the thermal behavior of an undoped sample of Ba2BP7N14, were determined from diffuse reflectance spectroscopy and temperature&#8208;dependent powder X&#8208;ray diffraction, respectively. Irradiation of a Eu2+&#8208;doped sample with near&#8208;UV light results in a blue emission peaking at &#955;em = 422 nm.</dc:description>

The structure was characterized by a multi-step process involving single-crystal and powder X-ray diffraction (SCXRD, PXRD), elemental analysis, electron microscopy (STEM, EELS), and solid-state 31P and 11B MAS NMR spectroscopy. The plausibility of the structural model was corroborated by low-cost crystallographic calculations. The optical band gap and the thermal behavior of an undoped sample of Ba2BP7N14, were determined from diffuse reflectance spectroscopy and temperature-dependent powder X-ray diffraction, respectively. Irradiation of a Eu2+-doped sample with near-UV light results in a blue emission peaking at &#955;em = 422 nm.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Green Synthesis of Copper Nanoparticles utilising the Maillard Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This paper presents a green synthesis method for copper nanoparticles using the Amadori rearrangement followed by the Maillard reaction. Naturally derived reagents like monosaccharides (xylose and galactose) and arginine reduce copper ions in an aqueous solution. The nanoparticle size, adjustable by arginine concentration, ranges from in the lowest regime between 3&#8211;16&#8197;nm.







Abstract
A new approach for the fabrication copper nanoparticles by a wet chemical reduction method is reported. The natural resources arginine as amino compound and several monosaccharides (xylose, ribose, galactose and glucose) react characteristically performing an Amadori rearrangement followed by a Maillard type reaction. This reaction carried out in an aqueous solution ensures an environmentally friendly way of reducing copper(II) ions leading to the formation of the desired nanoparticles. By changing the concentration of the amino acid, simultaneously acting as a complexing agent, it is possible to tune the size of the resulting nano particles to a certain degree down to 3&#8197;nm. This nontoxic and facile preparation route with quantitative yield opens a wide field of applications ranging from electronics to medical approaches.

         <title>Self&#8208;Healing Behavior of Metallopolymers in Complex3D&#8208;Structures Obtained by DLP&#8208;Based 3D&#8208;Printing</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents the digital light processing (DLP) based three&#8208;dimensional (3D) printing of metallopolymers featuring self&#8208;healing abilities. The obtained structures were able to heal mechanical damage with excellent efficiencies up to 97&#8201;% without losing their 3D&#8208;structure. Additionally, the healing behavior in dependency of the molecular structure was analyzed in detail revealing new structure&#8208;property&#8208;relationships.







Abstract
This current study focusses on the investigation of the self&#8208;healing abilities of metallopolymers containing different kinds of metal complexes, which were processed by direct digital light processing (DLP) based three&#8208;dimensional (3D) printing. For this purpose, 2&#8208;phenoxyethyl acrylate is mixed with ligand&#8208;containing monomers either based on triphenylmethyl(trt)&#8208;histidine or terpyridine, respectively. Either zinc(II) or nickel(II) salts are successfully applied for a complexation of the ligand monomers in solution and, subsequently, photopolymerization is performed. The thermo&#8208;mechanical properties of the obtained metallopolymers were characterized by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) as well as dynamic mechanical thermal analysis (DMTA). Multiple damages with defined forces ranging from 20 to 1500&#8197;mN were introduced into the 3D&#8208;structures and successfully healed within 24&#8197;h at 70&#8201;&#176;C or 120&#8201;&#176;C, respectively without losing the structural integrity of the overall 3D&#8208;structures. Herein, excellent healing efficiencies up to 97&#8201;% were determined. Consequently, these hollow structures not only feature very good self&#8208;healing abilities but also excellent retention of the 3D&#8208;structure at and above the healing temperature.

         <title>Helicene&#8211;Fluorescein Hybrids: A Reversible Base&#8208;Triggered (Chir)optical Switch with Sign Inversion of Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel hybrid molecules combining helicene and fluorescein act as pH&#8208;responsive circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) materials. They exhibit dual&#8208;mode switching, shifting from blue to red emission with CPL sign inversion upon base addition. This rare behavior in small molecules enables simultaneous control of emission wavelength and CPL handedness, offering potential for stimuli&#8208;responsive chiral materials and biological applications.







Abstract
Novel circularly&#8208;polarized&#8208;luminescence (CPL) materials were designed and synthesized by integrating the intrinsic chirality of helicene with the acid/base&#8208;responsive properties of fluorescein. The synthesized helicene&#8211;fluorescein hybrids exhibit reversible switching between blue fluorescence under neutral conditions and red fluorescence under basic conditions. Furthermore, these hybrid compounds demonstrate unique chiroptical switching behavior with a rare base&#8208;triggered CPL sign inversion, where (P)&#8208;isomers show a negative CPL signal around 450&#8197;nm under neutral conditions and a positive signal around 620&#8197;nm under basic conditions, with three&#8208;fold enhanced dissymmetry factors (|glum|) under basic conditions. The structural basis for this switching was elucidated through TD&#8208;DFT calculations, revealing distinct angles between magnetic and electric transition dipole moments in closed versus open forms. Live&#8208;cell imaging experiments using HeLa cells revealed that the hybrid compounds exhibit intracellular red emission with minimal cytotoxicity, thus promising potential as chiral fluorescent probes for biological applications.

         <title>Stabilization of a Terminal Hydride Through Regioselective Protonation in a Diiron Complex Inspired by [FeFe]&#8208;Hydrogenase</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Acid strength and steric hindrance orients regioselective protonation of an electron&#8208;rich dithiolate diiron complex, related to the H&#8208;cluster. Weaker acids promote the main formation of an exceptionally stable terminal hydride complex, whereas stronger acids mostly favor a bridging hydride isomer.







Abstract
Protonation studies of the complex [Fe2(&#956;&#8208;pdt)(&#954;2&#8208;dmpe)2(CO)2] (1), inspired by the [FeFe]&#8208;hydrogenases active site cofactor, yield terminal and bridging hydrido isomers in a ratio that depends on the acid strength and steric hindrance. A terminal hydride ligand is mainly obtained in presence of weaker acids such as [HPtBu3][BF4] and [HNEt3][BF4] while a bridging isomer is predominantly formed with stronger acids such as [HPPh3][BF4] and [H(OEt2)][BF4]. The terminal isomer is comparatively stable and undergoes isomerization into the bridging hydride following first&#8208;order kinetics, with half&#8208;lives of 21&#8197;days and 3&#8197;days at room temperature and 40&#8201;&#176;C, respectively.

         <title>Efficient Blue Electroluminescence Based on a Donor&#8208;&#960;&#8208;Acceptor with Pyrene Bridge: Weak Charge&#8208;Transfer (CT) for High Luminescence and Considerable Exciton Utilization</title>

Blue&#8208;emissive donor&#8208;&#960;&#8208;acceptor material PCZ&#8208;P&#8208;PY is synthesized. Weak charge&#8208;transfer (CT) character brought by the pyrene bridge gives rise to the high PLQY as well as the construction of efficient &#8220;hot&#8208;exciton&#8221; channel. As a result, an impressive electroluminescent efficiency of 5.9% is achieved, highlighting the potential of this material in advanced optoelectronic applications.







Abstract
Blue emitters are crucial in the organic light emitting diode (OLED) industry and scientific field. In this work, we prepared a novel donor&#8208;&#960;&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A) molecular PCZ&#8722;P&#8208;PY using pyrene as a bridge to construct hybrid local and charge&#8208;transfer (HLCT) state with weak charge&#8208;transfer (CT) property. This excited state design give rise to the high photoluminescent quantum yield (PLQY), more importantly, it is also responsible for the high exciton utilization efficiency (EUE) by constructing efficient hot&#8208;exciton channel. As a result, exceeding external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 5.7&#8201;% is achieved in the non&#8208;doped OLED of PCZ&#8722;P&#8208;PY with exceeding EUE of up to 90&#8201;%.

As a result, an impressive electroluminescent efficiency of 5.9% is achieved, highlighting the potential of this material in advanced optoelectronic applications.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue emitters are crucial in the organic light emitting diode (OLED) industry and scientific field. In this work, we prepared a novel donor-&#960;-acceptor (D-&#960;-A) molecular PCZ&#8722;P-PY using pyrene as a bridge to construct hybrid local and charge-transfer (HLCT) state with weak charge-transfer (CT) property. This excited state design give rise to the high photoluminescent quantum yield (PLQY), more importantly, it is also responsible for the high exciton utilization efficiency (EUE) by constructing efficient hot-exciton channel. As a result, exceeding external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 5.7&#8201;% is achieved in the non-doped OLED of PCZ&#8722;P-PY with exceeding EUE of up to 90&#8201;%.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of an organometallic&#8208;polypeptide block copolymer with a crystallizable polyferrocenyldimethylsilane block and a hydrophilic poly(L&#8208;glutamic acid) block is systematically explored. Rod&#8208;like and plate&#8208;like micelles with polypeptide coronas form in aqueous solutions via crystallization&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly. The effects of block composition and solvent condition are examined.







Abstract
The synthesis of polyferrocenyldimethylsilane&#8208;b&#8208;poly(L&#8208;glutamic acid) block copolymers was systematically explored. Rod&#8208;like and plate&#8208;like micelles were prepared from self&#8208;assembly of the block copolymers in aqueous solution with two different approaches. In a dissolution&#8208;dialysis approach, micelles were prepared by dissolving a block copolymer sample in excess aqueous base followed by the dialysis of the solution against water. The morphology of the resultant micelles showed composition dependence. The block copolymer sample with the lowest soluble block content formed rod&#8208;like micelles, while the other samples with higher soluble block content formed spherical micelles. In a THF&#8208;mediated approach, THF was added into a block copolymer solution, which was first prepared by the dissolution&#8208;dialysis approach, and then the THF was evaporated slowly. Plate&#8208;like micelles were obtained from all the block copolymer samples examined, and these had a broad range of soluble block content. The formation of these plate&#8208;like micelles was attributed to the crystallization of the PFDMS blocks in the presence of THF. A tendency of large platelet micelles evolving to thin filaments over time was observed. This change may have been driven by the increase in the corona&#8208;chain stretching energy as THF evaporated.

         <title>Incorporation of Cages into Gels: Access to a New Class of Soft Materials with Well&#8208;Defined Functionality</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Combination of cages and polymer science shows promise in developing innovative materials with diverse properties and applications, especially soft material with dual porosity. Cage&#8208;gel hybrid materials can be constructed through covalent bonding, non&#8208;covalent interactions, and orthogonal systems and have been designed with diverse functions, including stimuli responsiveness, self&#8208;healing, guest encapsulation and release, and so forth.







Abstract
The combination of supramolecular self&#8208;assemblies and polymer science has resulted in the development of soft materials with diverse properties and applications. In particular, the coordination cages of predefined shape, size, and internal cavity can be utilized intelligently as promising building units for designing responsive and smart soft materials with dual porosity, contributing to the introduction of versatile host&#8208;guest chemistry into gels. In this review, we present the recent advancements in gels incorporating coordination cages into their networks, ranging from synthesis strategies to state&#8208;of&#8208;art applications. In particular, the host&#8208;guest chemistry endows the hybrid gel materials with possibilities for guest&#8208;specific responsive systems.

The V&#8208;Cu&#8208;MOF exhibits remarkable versatility, efficiently oxidizing various substituted phenols while maintaining high catalytic activity. Additionally, it shows excellent recyclability, with conversion and selectivity consistently exceeding 97% after multiple cycles. Mechanistic studies reveal that the reaction benefits from dual&#8208;active centers {V2O6}2&#8722; clusters and binuclear copper units.

         <title>Narrow Bandgap Perovskite Enabled by Heterovalent Co&#8208;doping for Visible&#8208;NIR Light Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal halide perovskites have garnered significant attention due to their vast potential in various optoelectronic applications. While their tunable bandgap properties allow for light absorption across the ultraviolet and much of the visible spectrum, the coverage in the near&#8208;infrared (NIR) region remains limited. Here, we demonstrate a heterovalent co&#8208;doping method for synthesizing Ag and Bi doped CsSnBr3 crystals with absorption edge up to 1300 nm, making it one of the narrowest bandgap perovskite materials. The incorporation of trivalent Bi (p) orbitals is responsible for the band narrowing, while the monovalent Ag stabilizes the entire perovskite lattice. Taking advantage of the new energy states within the bandgap, the absorption edge of the co&#8208;dopants is extended to NIR region, so they can efficiently utilize sunlight. Moreover, the co&#8208;dopants exhibit significantly better antioxidation capability than the pristine CsSnBr3. When applied to CO2 photoreduction, the co&#8208;dopants achieved highly selective CO production performance, with an apparent quantum yield (AQY) of 7.56% at 700 nm, representing a 94% improvement over CsSnBr3. Overall, this study provides effective strategies for optimizing tin&#8208;based perovskites and holds significant implications for future research in enhancing stability, reducing toxicity, and optimizing optoelectronic performance.</dc:description>

         <title>Selective Hydrolysis by Engineered Cutinases: Characterization of Aliphatic&#8208;Aromatic Homo and Co&#8208;Polyesters by LC and LC&#8208;MS methods</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The performance, biodegradability, and recyclability of polymers can be tuned during synthesis by adopting monomers with different chemical characteristics. Recent research has shown the aptness of some hydrolases to depolymerize polyesters under mild conditions compared to chemical approaches. Herein, we engineered a cutinase from Thermobifida cellulosilytica (Tc_Cut2NVWCCG) for improved thermostability (up to 91 &#176;C) and compared it with previously reported leaf&#8208;branch compost cutinase (LCCWCCG) for the hydrolysis of low molar mass substrates, as well as aliphatic and aromatic homo&#8208; and co&#8208;polyesters. For both enzymes, higher hydrolysis rates were observed for aliphatic compared to aromatic homo&#8208;polyesters. SEC&#8208;MS analysis revealed that the hydrolysis of aliphatic/aromatic co&#8208;polyesters occurred at the aliphatic monomers, significantly reducing the molecular weight and changing the end&#8208;group composition. These results underline the importance of co&#8208;polymer composition in the biodegradation of co&#8208;polymer systems and demonstrate the applicability of enzymes for the analytical characterization of synthetic polymers by selectively reducing their molecular weight. Finally, the discovery and engineering of highly active enzymes that can efficiently hydrolyze a wide variety of synthetic polyesters create new opportunities for their efficient recycling under mild conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Borylative Desymmetrization of Multifunctional Haloarenes assisted by Sodium Dispersion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Borylation in the presence of Na dispersion induces desymmetrization of a dihalogenated arene. The monoborylated chlorobenzene, which has rarely been prepared from 1,4&#8208;dichlorobenzene previously in a single operation, is synthesized in a facile manner.







Abstract
Multiply halogenated aromatic compounds were selectively borylated by a boron alkoxide in the presence of sodium dispersion when the reaction was carried out at a low temperature, while multi&#8208;functionalization took place at an elevated temperature. The reaction of 1,4&#8208;dichlorobenzene with sodium dispersion (200&#8211;1200&#8197;mol%) in the presence of isopropyloxyboron pinacolate (120&#8211;240&#8197;mol%) afforded (4&#8208;chlorophenyl)boron pinacolate in up to 84&#8201;% yield. Formation of diborylated product hardly accompanied under the reaction conditions at &#8722;78&#8201;&#176;C for 1&#8197;h.

         <title>Phosphorescent Isocyanide&#8208;Metal&#8208;Carboranyl Complexes of Copper(I) and Gold(I): Synthesis and Radioluminescence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Isocyanide copper(I) and gold(I) complexes (RL)MX (where X=chloride or carboranyl) exhibit photo&#8208; and high&#8208;energy X&#8208;ray radioluminescence with microsecond emission lifetimes.







Abstract
A series of (L)MX (L=isocyanide; M=Cu(I) or Au(I); X=chloride or carboranyl) complexes have been prepared. The first examples of isocyanide Cu(I) chloride complexes with 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 stoichiometry between isocyanide and CuCl are reported and structurally characterised. The photophysical properties of (RNC)AuCl and (RNC)Au(&#951;1&#8208;carboranyl) complexes have been investigated. Complexes (RNC)Au(&#951;1&#8208;carboranyl) show no aurophilic Au&#8722;Au interactions and emit long&#8208;lived deep&#8208;blue phosphorescence up to 377&#8197;&#956;s. The radioluminescence of these gold complexes was studied to show a superior radioluminescence stability for the gold(carboranyl) complexes compared to gold chloride materials under constant high energy X&#8208;ray radiation of 350&#8197;keV.

         <title>A Water&#8208;Stable Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Framework (HOF) for Selective Sensing of Antibiotics in Aqueous Medium</title>

Strategic design and development of a water&#8208;stable HOF (IITKGP&#8208;HOF&#8208;6) for aqueous medium antibiotic sensing with higher sensitivity, superior selectivity, fast responsivity, and multiple recyclability.







Abstract
Although metal organic frameworks (MOFs) and covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have been extensively used as fluorescent&#8208;based antibiotic sensors, newly developed hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) are largely unexplored toward this direction. To realize this, the luminescent HOFs must be stable in water as the analytes are mostly found in water&#8208;based effluents in environments. In addition, HOFs should be equipped with specific recognition sites in order to direct the discrimination among the antibiotics. Herein, we report a 3D porous HOF, IITKGP&#8208;HOF&#8208;6, constructed from an aromatic&#8208;rich tetratopic carboxylic acid (H4L), which exhibits excellent hydro and prolonged open&#8208;air stability (7 and 15&#8197;days, respectively). IITKGP&#8208;HOF&#8208;6 was explored for the highly selective detection of nitrofurans (NFs) family of antibiotics in aqueous medium exhibiting a remarkably low detection limit of 0.75&#8197;&#956;M for nitrofurazone (NFZ) through luminescence quenching. Photoinduced electron transfer driven by the presence of low&#8208;lying charge&#8208;transfer excited state below to the

 and Forster energy transfer between H4L donor and NFZ acceptor are confirmed to be responsible for observed quenching using detailed quantum&#8208;chemical studies. This work demonstrates the usage of HOFs as sensory materials toward antibiotics in aqueous medium along with a clear understanding into the sensing mechanism at the molecular level.

         <title>Adjustability and versatility of molecular packing patterns in asymmetric coumarin liquid crystals supramolecular column structures</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Coumarin asymmetric multi&#8208;chain liquid crystals (LCs) were synthesized using click reaction, with coumarin core and 1,2,3&#8208;triazole dendritic wings on both sides. The properties of these LCs and the resulting gels were investigated using polarized optical microscopy (POM), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), X&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). These polycatenars demonstrate the ability to self&#8208;assemble into columnar LCs phases, exhibiting p4mm symmetry in their bulk states. In DMF solvent, ether compounds yield gels with notably more ordered, spherical flower&#8208;like morphologies, while ester compounds produce gels that are less ordered and exhibit a nanosphere morphology. The findings indicate that the polarities of both the linkages and the solvents play a critical role in the formation of supramolecular nanostructures. Interestingly, the IE3/14 was proved as promising imaging probe for latent fingerprints (LFPs) and fluorescent fingerprints images were obtained with high&#8208;resolution, which showed potential practical application for LFPs detection. Additionally, LCs compounds are used as dopants to modify the poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrene (PEDOT:PSS) injection layer of Organic silicone&#8208;based heterojunction solar cells (HSCs). Finally, Density functional theory (DFT) calculations are performed to theoretically study such as geometric structure, frontier molecular orbitals, molecular electrostatic potential, and dipole moment.</dc:description>

In this work, we report a series of cyclic alkyl&#8208;amino carbene (cAAC) functionalized&#8208; mono and di&#8208;substituted cyclopentadiene rings. The functionalization of the Cp rings with cAAC ligands makes them significantly bulkier, while retaining their ligation properties. These compounds display interesting fluorescence properties displaying intra&#8208;molecular charge transfer from electron&#8208;rich carbene moiety to electron&#8208;deficient cyclopentadiene unit.







Abstract
A series of significantly bulky mono&#8208; and di&#8208;substituted cyclic alkyl&#8208;amino carbene (cAAC)&#8208; functionalized cyclopentadiene ring (Cp) compounds were synthesized. The functionalization of the Cp ring with cAAC ligands makes them significantly bulkier, while retaining their ligation properties. These compounds display interesting fluorescence properties. In these compounds, intra&#8208;molecular charge transfer is observed from electron&#8208;rich carbene to electron&#8208;deficient cyclopentadiene unit. These high yielding compounds have been characterized by X&#8208;ray single&#8208;crystal diffraction and their emission properties have been studied. Rotational conformers (via C&#8722;C bond rotation) play a pivotal role with possible different extent of intramolecular charge&#8208;transfer (ICT) from carbene to cyclopentadiene ring. Variable temperature&#8208;dependent NMR studies were performed along with NOSY, COSY and different 2D NMR techniques to estimate the energy barriers and 1,5&#8208;Hydrogen shift.

         <title>Effect of Halogen Substitution on the Regioselective Deiodination of Thyroid Hormone Analogues by Deiodinase Mimics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This paper describes the synthesis and NMR spectroscopic studies of various halogen analogues of T4. Deiodination experiments with deiodinase mimics reveal that the regioselectivity or specificity towards iodine atom is not altered upon introduction of more electronegative halogen atoms (F, Cl and Br), reinforcing the concept of halogen bonding in the deiodination reactions.

The deiodination of L&#8208;thyroxine (T4) by the three isoforms of selenium&#8208;containing iodothyronine deiodinases (DIOs) is an important process in the human body for the maintenance of the thyroid hormone homeostasis. The 5&#8242;&#8208;deiodination of T4 by DIO1 or DIO2 produces the biologically active hormone 3,5,3&#8242;&#8208;triiodo thyronine (T3) and 5&#8208;deiodination by DIO1 or DIO3 generates 3,3&#8242;,5&#8242;&#8208;triiodo thyronine (rT3), which is considered to be biologically inactive. Selenium compounds are known to mimic the function of DIO3 by catalyzing the 5&#8208;deiodination of T4 and a co&#8208;operative halogen and chalcogen bonding is responsible for their activity. The substitution of 4&#8242;&#8208;OH group of T4 by an electron withdrawing group not only alters the reactivity but also changes the regioselectivity of deiodination. However, the effect of other halogen atoms (F, Cl or Br) in place of iodine in T4 on the regioselectivity has not been explored. In this paper, we describe simple synthetic methodologies toward various halogen analogues of T4. We also show that 2D NMR spectroscopy can be used as a powerful tool to identify the location of various halogen substitutions on the phenolic or tyrosyl rings. The deiodination experiments with peri&#8208;substituted naphthalene diselenol reveal that the regioselectivity or specificity towards iodine atom is not altered upon introduction of more electronegative halogen atoms (F, Cl and Br), reinforcing the concept of halogen bonding in the deiodination reactions.

&lt;p&gt;The deiodination of L-thyroxine (T4) by the three isoforms of selenium-containing iodothyronine deiodinases (DIOs) is an important process in the human body for the maintenance of the thyroid hormone homeostasis. The 5&#8242;-deiodination of T4 by DIO1 or DIO2 produces the biologically active hormone 3,5,3&#8242;-triiodo thyronine (T3) and 5-deiodination by DIO1 or DIO3 generates 3,3&#8242;,5&#8242;-triiodo thyronine (rT3), which is considered to be biologically inactive. Selenium compounds are known to mimic the function of DIO3 by catalyzing the 5-deiodination of T4 and a co-operative halogen and chalcogen bonding is responsible for their activity. The substitution of 4&#8242;-OH group of T4 by an electron withdrawing group not only alters the reactivity but also changes the regioselectivity of deiodination. However, the effect of other halogen atoms (F, Cl or Br) in place of iodine in T4 on the regioselectivity has not been explored. In this paper, we describe simple synthetic methodologies toward various halogen analogues of T4.

         <title>Deciphering and Countering Formic Acid Permeability in Zero&#8208;Gap Electrolyzers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present a method for understanding formic acid crossover through Nafion&#8208;separated zero&#8208;gap cells, with and without an applied electric field. In&#8208;situ impedance measurements confirmed diffusion as the primary contributor to permeation. Using a design of experiments, we developed a cost&#8208;effective barrier layer reducing formic acid uptake by 46&#8201;%. These findings may enhance formic acid fuel cells and electrochemical devices.







Abstract
In recent years, formic acid (FA) has garnered attention as a compelling molecule for various chemical and everyday applications. Additionally, with recent studies demonstrating direct FA generation through CO2 electrolysis, it can serve as a stable liquid hydrogen carrier. Nevertheless, FA&#8208;permeability via semi&#8208;permeable ion&#8211;exchange membranes (FA&#8208;crossover) still constitutes a major issue in scalable polymer&#8208;electrolyte separated zero&#8208;gap electrolyzers, limiting the breakthrough of the technology to the larger&#8208;scale. Herein we present a holistic route towards understanding the mechanism of FA&#8208;crossover in zero&#8208;gap electrolyzers. The gained know&#8208;how through formic acid solution uptake, gel&#8208;phase conductivity, and membrane permeability measurements allowed for the development of an easy&#8208;to&#8208;scale barrier layer, showing a FA&#8208;flux (JFA) decrease by 46&#8201;% at 200&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 compared to bare Nafion&#8208;membranes.

         <title>Activation of the Voltage&#8208;Gated Potassium Channel by Amphiphilic Glycopeptides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report how synthetic heparan sulfate (HS) and sialic acid glycans on amphiphilic glycopeptides influence cell membrane persistence and modulate Kv2.1 channel gating. Sulfation of HS enhances membrane association and potentiate VGIC activation, highlighting the critical role of glycan structure in VGIC activity.







Abstract
Voltage&#8208;gated ion channels (VGICs) are allosterically modulated by glycosaminoglycan proteoglycans and sialic acid glycans. However, the structural diversity and heterogeneity of these biomolecules pose significant challenges to precisely delineate their underlying structure&#8208;activity relationships. Herein, we demonstrate how heparan sulfate (HS) and sialic acid synthetic glycans appended on amphiphilic glycopeptide backbone influence cell membrane persistence and modulate the gating of the Kv2.1 channel. Utilizing a panel of amphiphilic glycopeptides comprising HS disaccharides and sialic acid trisaccharide glycans, we observed that sulfation of HS and flexible &#945;(2&#8208;6) sialylation result in prolonged persistence of glycopeptides on the cell membrane compared to non&#8208;sulfated HS and &#945;(2&#8211;3) sialylation respective. This variation in glycocalyx composition was associated with a noticeable difference in the effects of these compounds on the activation and deactivation properties of the voltage&#8208;gated Kv2.1 channel with our strongest membrane associating compound demonstrating the most potent channel&#8208;activation propensity. Our findings demonstrate that sulfation charges on glycopeptide play a critical role in their membrane association propensities and endow them with VGIC activation properties. These results provide a valuable insight into the role of cell surface glycans in VGIC activities.

         <title>Exploring the Synthesis and Properties of Fluorinated Cationic Triangulenes and Their Precursors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Partial defluorination of methyl 2,3,5,6&#8208;tetrafluorobenzoate led to synthesis of (3,5&#8208;difluoro&#8208;2,6&#8208;dimethoxyphenyl) bis(2,6&#8208;dimethoxyphenyl)&#8208;methylium, which was then used as a precursor to synthesize fluorinated acridiniums, dimethoxyquinacridinium and triangulenes. Fluorination induced red shifts in absorption and emission spectra and enhanced electrophilicity. X&#8208;ray analysis revealed altered packing patterns and formation of molecular dipoles as compared to non&#8208;fluorinated analogues.







Abstract
Fluorination of tris(2,6&#8208;dimethoxyphenyl)&#8208;methylium ((DMP)3C+) was achieved through the partial defluorination of the methyl 2,3,5,6&#8208;tetrafluorobenzoate via nucleophilic aromatic substitution. Using the fluorinated 2F((DMP)3C+) as a precursor, fluorinated tetramethoxy&#8208; and dimethoxyquin&#8208; acridinium salts (2F4 and 2F5 respectively) and trioxo&#8208;, azadioxo&#8208;, and diazaoxo&#8208; triangulenium salts (2F6, 2F7 and 2F8 respectively) were synthesized successfully in good to moderate yields. Fluorination induced significant red shifts in absorption (16 to 29&#8197;nm) and emission (13 to 41&#8197;nm) maxima, and increased electrophilicity as evidenced by lower reduction potentials. X&#8208;ray structural analysis showed distinct packing patterns compared to the non&#8208;fluorinated analogues, indicating the presence of molecular dipoles.

         <title>New Concept on the Generation and Regulation of Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 9, February 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recently circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) has attracted tremendous attention. But the simultaneously rational control of chirality and luminescence still remains a challenge. This concept overviews the current advances in the diverse matching rules for the convenient generation and regulation of CPL, mainly including fluorescence&#8208;selective absorption, circularly polarized fluorescence energy transfer, and chiral communication.







Abstract
Circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) has attracted tremendous attention because of its significant application prospect across multiple fields of three&#8208;dimensional display, data storage, and information encryption. Chirality and luminescence are two necessary prerequisites for the generation of CPL. However, controlling these two factors simultaneously in a rational manner remains a challenge. Herein, we highlight the recent advances on the rational generation and regulation of CPL through the new concept, named matching rules, mainly including fluorescence&#8208;selective absorption, circularly polarized fluorescence energy transfer, and chiral communication between excited state and ground state. An important commonality among these strategies is that they need a good overlap of the corresponding spectra between the luminescent part (fluorescence, phosphorescence, or CPL) and the chiral part (organic, inorganic, or organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid materials), which can be contactless and separate. Different from most previous studies, no covalent or noncovalent interactions between the two parts are required, which makes them more facile and convenient. Finally, we summarize the main advantages of these strategies and the current challenges. We expect this concept to offer insightful and novel understanding and inspiration on CPL generation and regulation.

         <title>Chirality&#8208;Dependent Anisotropic Nonlinear Optical Effect in Low&#8208;Dimensional Hybrid Metal Halides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 9, February 12, 2025. </description>

This Concept Article highlights recent advances in chiral low&#8208;dimensional hybrid halides (LDHMHs), with a focus on the chiral nonlinear optical effects. Chiral LDHMHs show a remarkable ability to efficiently discriminate and generate circularly polarized light, making them outstanding candidates for future applications in optical information processing, optical encryption, and chiral sensing.







Abstract
Low&#8208;dimensional hybrid metal halides (LDHMHs) have emerged as a highly promising class of functional materials for a wide range of optoelectronic applications. Their exceptional structural tunability, facilitated by the hybridization of metal halides with organic compounds, enables the formation of three&#8208;, two&#8208;, one&#8208;, or zero&#8208;dimensional structures. This flexibility in structural design also allows the incorporation of chirality into the crystalline lattice, giving rise to novel LDHMH materials that are capable of selectively interacting with the spin angular momentum of electrons and photons. Among the unique optoelectronic properties of LDHMHs, the focus of this concept article is their chiroptical nonlinear optical (NLO) effect. LDHMHs demonstrate a highly effective discrimination and generation of circularly polarized (CP) light in the NLO regime, particularly in the second harmonic generation (SHG) process, referred to as SHG&#8208;circular dichroism (SHG&#8208;CD) and CP&#8208;SHG. These anisotropic responses are several orders of magnitude larger than linear chiroptical responses, such as CD and CP luminescence; consequently, LDHMHs are expected to be promising candidates for future optical&#8208;information devices and encryption systems. This article introduces recently reported chiral LDHMH materials that exhibit excellent CP&#8208;dependent anisotropic SHG responses.

         <title>Synthesis of Core&#8208;Functionalised Naphthalenediimides from Naphthalenetetracarboxylic Dianhydride using a Vibratory Ball Mill: Bromination, Imidization and Heck&#8208;Type Reactions</title>

         <dc:description>
Core&#8208;functionalised naphthalene diimides (c&#8208;NDIs) are an important component in organic electronics. Current methods for their production frequently require long reaction times, large quantities of solvent and inert conditions. Herein, we report the synthesis of a series c&#8208;NDIs by a 3&#8208;step synthesis from naphthalenetetracarboxylic dianhydride (NDI) using only environmentally sustainable mechanochemical methods and without excluding air or moisture.







Abstract
The synthesis of 9 core&#8208;functionalised naphthalene diimide (c&#8208;NDI) residues is reported via a 3&#8208;step synthesis from naphthalenetetracarboxylic dianhydride using only mechanochemical activation. Selective dibromination and subsequent diimidization were achieved for the first time in a vibratory ball mill, resulting in the key structural intermediate, 2,6&#8208;dibromonaphthalenediimide (DBND), which is the basis for elaboration into a multitude of organic electronic materials. Our new synthesis of DBND is achieved in just 5&#8197;hours reaction time over two steps compared to typical solution state times of 24&#8197;hours. Subsequent Heck&#8208;type cross coupling reactions, with a range of styrene residues, produced a series of c&#8208;NDIs in good yields. The Heck&#8208;type reactions are rapid (1.5&#8197;hours), require no additional heating or solvent and are tolerant of atmospheric moisture and air.

         <title>Magnetohydrodynamic Enhancement of Biofuel Cell Performance</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 9, February 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The power output of a model biofuel cell can be improved when placing a magnet with moderate strength behind the electrodes. This, at first sight, counterintuitive parallel arrangement of the magnetic and electric field vectors still induces a significant Lorentz force at the edges of the electrodes, leading to a performance enhancement of up to 300&#8201;%.







Abstract
Biofuel cells have become an interesting alternative for the design of sustainable energy conversion systems with multiple applications ranging from biosensing and bioelectronics to autonomously moving devices. However, as an electrochemical system, their performance is intimately related to mass transport conditions. In this work, the magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) effect is studied as an easy and straightforward alternative to enhance the performance of a biofuel cell based on the enzymes glucose oxidase (GOx) and bilirubin oxidase (BOD). The synergetic effect between the electric and ionic currents, produced by the enzymatic redox reactions, and a magnetic field orthogonal to the surface of the electrodes, leads to the formation of localized magnetohydrodynamic vortexes. Such an integrated convective regime generates an increase of the bioelectrocatalytic current and its concomitant power output in the presence of the external magnetic field. In addition, by fine&#8208;tuning the spatial arrangement of the anode and cathode, it is possible to benefit from the sum of anodic and cathodic MHD vortexes, leading to an enhanced power output of up to 300&#8201;%.

         <title>When the Study of the Post&#8208;Synthetic Modification Method on a 1D Spin Crossover Coordination Polymer Highlights its Catalytic Activity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 9, February 12, 2025. </description>

The spin crossover iron complex, with the formula [Fe(NH2trz)3](NO3)2, catalyzes imine formation from 4&#8208;amino&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;triazole and aldehyde. During catalysis, the iron complex undergoes two different PSM reactions: the first with an aldehyde and the second with an aminotriazole. These PSM reactions are thought to be involved in the catalytic mechanism of this iron&#8208;based coordination polymer.







Abstract
We are interested in studying the catalytic activity of the spin crossover (SCO) complex ([Fe(NH2trz)3](NO3)2). In this work, we demonstrate that, by adapting the experimental conditions, we can switch from a quantitative post&#8208;synthetic modification (PSM) reaction to the use of this complex as a catalyst for the formation of imine from 4&#8208;amino&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;triazole. During the catalytic reaction, the iron complex undergoes two different PSM reactions: the first is the action of the aldehyde on the NH2 groups present on the complex, whereas the second PSM reaction occurs between the imine complex and aminotriazole, leading back to the starting complex. These two PSM reactions are at least partially involved in the catalytic mechanism. Furthermore, the combination of these two PSM reactions enables us to modulate the particle size and shape of the final amine complex without altering its excellent SCO properties. This result is of interest in the field of heterogeneous catalysis, where particle size has a strong influence on the catalytic activity, and for the proper integration in devices for different applications.

         <title>Meso&#8208;&#946; Monofused Porphyrins: Synthesis, Structural, Spectral, Electrochemical and DFT Studies and Their Efficient Third&#8208;Order Nonlinear Optical Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 9, February 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Promising Fusion! &#946;&#8208;to&#8208;ortho monofused porphyrins and their derivatives have been successfully synthesized and characterized. These porphyrins exhibit electronic spectral features in the low&#8208;energy region and demonstrate tuneable electrochemical redox properties, resulting from their tailored design and peripheral fusion. Ultrafast third&#8208;order nonlinear optical studies reveal promising two&#8208;photon absorption coefficients and effective cross&#8208;section values, highlighting their potential for future optoelectronic applications.







Abstract
Three new series of &#946;&#8208;to&#8208;ortho&#8208;phenyl monofused porphyrins, denoted as MMFP(MN)X2 (where MFP=monofused porphyrin, MN=malononitrile and X=H or Br) and MMFP(MN)MB (where MB=mono benzo, M=2H, Co(II), Cu(II) and Zn(II)) were designed and successfully synthesized with good yields. These compounds were thoroughly characterized using various spectroscopic techniques and single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (SCXRD) analysis. Notably, three of the monofused porphyrins; CoMFP(MN)Br2, CuMFP(MN)Br2 and ZnMFP(MN)MB crystallized unambiguously in a triclinic crystal system with a 

P1&#8254;

&lt;p&gt;Three new series of &lt;i&gt;&#946;&lt;/i&gt;-to-&lt;i&gt;ortho&lt;/i&gt;-phenyl monofused porphyrins, denoted as MMFP(MN)X&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (where MFP=monofused porphyrin, MN=malononitrile and X=H or Br) and MMFP(MN)MB (where MB=mono benzo, M=2H, Co(II), Cu(II) and Zn(II)) were designed and successfully synthesized with good yields. These compounds were thoroughly characterized using various spectroscopic techniques and single crystal X-ray diffraction (SCXRD) analysis. Notably, three of the monofused porphyrins; CoMFP(MN)Br&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, CuMFP(MN)Br&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and ZnMFP(MN)MB crystallized unambiguously in a &lt;i&gt;triclinic&lt;/i&gt; crystal system with a

         <dc:description>
Reduction of a U(IV) monoimido resulted in the first example of an elusive U(III) monoimido. The stability of this species was shown experimentally and theoretically to be due to K+ intercalation into the dimeric structure.







Abstract
Reduction of Cp*(TrippTerN)UI with KC8 generates (KCp*(TrippTerN)UI)2, the first example of a trivalent uranium imido, a previously elusive species, which are commonly unstable. Experimental and computational results indicate that the K+ coordination is responsible for this isolable U(III) monoimido complex.

         <title>Frustrated Radical Pairs: From Fleeting Intermediates to Isolable Species</title>

Herein we report the design of stable para&#8208;substituted triarylamine&#8722;DDQ radical ion pairs (RIPs). We investigated several combinations using a wide variety of spectroscopic methods such as IR, EPR and NMR, both in solution and in the solid state. We quantified the degree of single&#8208;electron transfer (SET) and found that both the substituents (MeO &gt; tBu &gt; Br) and the polarity of solvents (MeCN &gt; DCM &gt; toluene) can lead to a greater degree of SET.







Abstract
We present the design and comprehensive investigation of stable para&#8208;substituted triarylamine&#8211;2,3&#8208;dichloro&#8208;5,6&#8208;dicyano&#8208;1,4&#8208;benzoquinone (DDQ) radical ion pairs (RIPs) generated via single&#8208;electron transfer (SET). We quantified the degree of SET in both solution and solid phases, utilising a suite of spectroscopic techniques including IR, EPR, NMR, and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (SC&#8211;XRD). Our findings reveal that the extent of SET is significantly influenced by the nature of the substituents (MeO &gt; tBu &gt; Br) and the polarity of the solvent (MeCN &gt; DCM &gt; toluene). The radical ion pair [(pMeOPh)3N]&#8901;+[DDQ]&#8901;&#8722; was unambiguously identified using EPR and UV&#8211;vis spectroscopy, and its structure was confirmed by SC&#8211;XRD. Detailed analysis indicates an open&#8208;shell singlet ground state with a thermally accessible triplet state, as corroborated by EPR, magnetic susceptibility measurements, and DFT calculations. This study offers crucial insights into the mechanistic pathways of RIP formation and tuning both in solution and solid states, laying the groundwork for future exploration of their reactivity and potential applications.

         <title>Ligand Engineering Toward Robust Sodium Storage in Self&#8208;Supported Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks</title>

A ligand engineering was proposed to design metal&#8208;organic frameworks with large conjugated naphthalene&#8208;2,6&#8208;dicarboxylic acid. The uniquely conjugated aromatic ligands endow the metal&#8208;organic frameworks with rich sites to accommodate Na+ ions, thus enabling a high reversible capacity for sodium storage. Such metal&#8208;organic frameworks exhibit a capacity of 330&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 1000&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1 with remarkable rate capability and cycling performance.







Abstract
Sodium&#8208;ion batteries capable of charging and discharging rapidly and durably are eagerly demanded to replace current lithium&#8208;ion batteries. However, large Na+ ions need more space to accommodate them. Metal&#8208;organic frameworks are promising anode materials, and their structure and performance are governed by organic ligands. Herein, we report a ligand engineering to design metal&#8208;organic frameworks with large conjugated naphthalene&#8208;2,6&#8208;dicarboxylic acid. Self&#8208;supported arrays of metal&#8208;organic frameworks reveal robust sodium storage when used as a binder&#8208;free anode. The uniquely long and conjugated aromatic ligands endow the metal&#8208;organic frameworks with rich sites to accommodate Na+ ions, thus enabling a high reversible capacity for sodium storage. As a result, such metal&#8208;organic frameworks exhibit a high capacity of 330&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 1000&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1 with remarkable rate capability and cycling performance. This work provides an exciting ligand strategy to design high&#8208;capacity metal&#8208;organic framework materials and would find extensive applications in various energy storage systems.

         <title>Partially Sulfated Pillar[5]Arenes: Synthesis and Molecular Recognition Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 9, February 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of pillar[5]arene sulfates P5Sn with different numbers of sulfate ionic groups are synthesized and fully characterized by spectroscopic, crystallographic, and computational methods. Isothermal titration calorimetry shows that the binding affinity of P5Sn toward cationic guests increases dramatically as N increases.







Abstract
We report the synthesis and characterization of sulfated pillar[5]arene hosts (P5S2&#8208;P5S10) that differ in the number of sulfate substituents. All five P5Sn hosts display high solubility in water (73&#8211;131&#8197;mM) and do not undergo significant self&#8208;association according to 1H NMR dilution experiments. The x&#8208;ray crystal structures of P5S6, P5S6&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;Me6HDA, P5S8&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;Me6HDA, and P5S10&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;Me6HDA reveal one intracavity molecule of Me6HDA and several external molecules of Me6HDA which form a network of close methonium&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;sulfate interactions. The thermodynamic parameters of complexation between P5Sn and the panel of guests was measured by direct or competitive isothermal titration calorimetry. We find that the binding free energy toward a guest becomes more negative as the number of sulfate substituents increase. Conversely, the binding free energy of a specific sulfated pillar[5]arene toward a homologous series of guests becomes more negative as the number of NMe groups increases.

&lt;p&gt;A series of pillar[5]arene sulfates &lt;b&gt;P5S&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; with different numbers of sulfate ionic groups are synthesized and fully characterized by spectroscopic, crystallographic, and computational methods. Isothermal titration calorimetry shows that the binding affinity of &lt;b&gt;P5S&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; toward cationic guests increases dramatically as N increases.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We report the synthesis and characterization of sulfated pillar[5]arene hosts (&lt;b&gt;P5S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-P5S&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;) that differ in the number of sulfate substituents. All five &lt;b&gt;P5S&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; hosts display high solubility in water (73&#8211;131&#8197;mM) and do not undergo significant self-association according to &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H NMR dilution experiments. The x-ray crystal structures of &lt;b&gt;P5S&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;P5S&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;&lt;b&gt;Me&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;HDA&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;P5S&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;&lt;b&gt;Me&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;HDA&lt;/b&gt;, and &lt;b&gt;P5S&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;&lt;b&gt;Me&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;HDA&lt;/b&gt; reveal one intracavity molecule of &lt;b&gt;Me&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;HDA&lt;/b&gt; and several external molecules of &lt;b&gt;Me&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;HDA&lt;/b&gt; which form a network of close methonium&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;sulfate interactions. The thermodynamic parameters of complexation between &lt;b&gt;P5S&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; and the panel of guests was measured by direct or competitive isothermal titration calorimetry. We find that the binding free energy toward a guest becomes more negative as the number of sulfate substituents increase. Conversely, the binding free energy of a specific sulfated pillar[5]arene toward a homologous series of guests becomes more negative as the number of NMe groups increases. The ability to tune the host&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;guest affinity by changing the number of sulfate substituents will be valuable in supramolecular polymers, separation materials, and latching applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Rare Case of Magnesium Alkyl Mediated CO&#8208;to&#8208;Alkoxide Conversion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 9, February 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
While the addition of Mg alkyls to CO2 is generally fast and selective, reactions with CO are troubled by the instability of the acyl anion. Herein we report an odd case of a highly selective three&#8208;fold addition to CO. Switching polarities converts a Mg alkyl into a Mg alkoxide complex.







Abstract
Alcohols can be produced by nucleophilic addition at the C=O functional group of ketones or aldehydes. Such C&#8722;C bond formations generally proceed smoothly and selective. In contrast, nucleophilic addition at carbon monoxide is considerably more complex and unselective due to the instability of polar metal acyl intermediates. Herein, we report a magnesium alkyl complex, stabilised with a dipyrromethenide ligand, and its reactivity with CO2 and CO. Whilst the reaction with CO2 gave the expected carboxylate, reaction with CO took a surprising course, resulting in an alkoxide by formation of three new C&#8722;C bonds in a single reaction. An intertwined experimental and computational approach sheds light on the unusual reactivity of a carbene intermediate.

         <title>Broken Symmetry and Elastic Frustration in Isostructural MnIII Spin Crossover Crystals</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 9, February 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Opening of both symmetry breaking and non&#8208;symmetry breaking thermal evolution pathways is demonstrated for isostructural crystals of a MnIII spin crossover cationic complex embedded in lattices with heavy anions ReO4&#8722;, AsF6&#8722; and SbF6&#8722;. This highlights the power of crystal engineering in coupling structural and electronic instabilities in molecular systems and the potential for tuning transition profiles.







Abstract
Symmetry breaking spin state transitions in two of three isostructural salts of MnIII spin crossover cations, [MnIII(3&#8208;OMe&#8208;5&#8208;NO2&#8208;sal2323)]+, with heavy anions are reported. The ReO4&#8722; (1) salt undergoes two&#8208;step spin crossover which is coupled with a re&#8208;entrant symmetry breaking structural phase transition between a high temperature phase (S=2, C2/c), an intermediate ordered phase (S=1/S=2, P21/c), and a low temperature phase (S=1, C2/c). The AsF6&#8722; (2) complex undergoes an abrupt transition between a high temperature phase (S=2, C2/c) and a low temperature ordered phase (S=1/S=2, P

1&#8254;

 ${\bar{1}}$



). The SbF6&#8722; (3) complex undergoes a gradual transition between a high temperature phase (S=2, P

1&#8254;

 ${\bar{1}}$



) and a low temperature spin state ordered phase (S=1/S=2, P&#8208;

1&#8254;

 ${\bar{1}}$



). Correlation of the volume of the anion and the T1/2 of the transitions in these complexes and three analogous complexes with similar anions, BF4&#8722; (4), ClO4&#8722; (5), PF6&#8722; (6), reveals an increase in T1/2 upon increasing the anion volume. We rationalise that the volume of the anions used modulates the elastic interactions between the MnIII sites in the lattice, with increasing elastic frustration with the larger anions resulting in a two&#8208;stepped transition for 1 and the stabilisation of the mixed (HS:LS) state to low temperature for 2 and 3.

1D water channels are valued for their selectivity and transport efficiency, but developing such channels from small molecules is challenging due to dipolar water tuning difficulty. This study explored C8 modifications of 2&#8208;amino&#8208;2&#8217;&#8208;fluoro&#8208;2&#8217;&#8208;deoxyadenosine (2FA), leading to a derivative that forms an S&#8208;shaped tetramer channel with water&#8208;wire arrays, providing insights into creating novel nucleoside&#8208;based water channels







Abstract
As artificial water channels have received widespread attention, various types of artificial water channels have been reported. However, apart from I&#8208;quartet channels, the development of 1D water channels with water wires constructed from small molecules has rarely been reported, because of the difficulty in precisely tuning the dipolar water molecules. Inspired by G&#8208;quartet functionalization strategies, this study explored C8 modifications of our previously reported molecule, 2&#8208;amino&#8208;2&#8217;&#8208;fluoro&#8208;2&#8217;&#8208;deoxyadenosine (2FA), known for its strong hydration properties and self&#8208;assembly capabilities, and investigated its potential for constructing nucleoside&#8208;based water channel&#8208;like structures. Among all derivatives, 2&#8208;amino&#8208;8&#8208;(4&#8208;aminophenyl)&#8208;2&#8217;&#8208;deoxy&#8208;2&#8217;&#8208;fluoro&#8208;D&#8208;adenosine can form an S&#8208;shaped channel as a tetramer, incorporating water wire arrays in the solid state. Such water channel&#8208;like structures in nucleoside self&#8208;assemblies provide new insights into the development of novel nucleoside&#8208;based supramolecular water channel materials.

         <title>Harnessing Cyanine&#8208;like Properties to Develop Bright Fluorogenic Probes Based on Viscosity&#8208;Sensitive Molecular Rotors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 9, February 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Playing on the electron&#8208;donor strength increases the absorptivity of hemicyanines, reaching cyanine&#8208;like photophysical properties. The resulting bright fluorescent molecular rotor can be used to develop fluorogenic probes for bioimaging. In particular, HaloTag fluorogens with increased brightness thanks to the improved absorption are obtained to label membrane proteins with high contrast in wash&#8208;free conditions.







Abstract
Dipolar fluorescent molecular rotors (FMRs) are environmentally&#8208;sensitive fluorophores that can be used in bioimaging applications to sense local viscosity and polarity. Their sensitivity to viscosity can also be used for the fluorogenic labeling of biomolecules such as DNA or proteins. In particular, we have previously used FMRs to develop a series of tunable fluorogens targeting the self&#8208;labeling protein tag Halotag for wash&#8208;free protein imaging in live cells. Despite these very useful properties, FMRs typically display moderate molar absorption coefficients that limits their overall fluorescence brightness. Herein, we synthesized a series of three model hemicyanines based on a styrylindolenium scaffold and performed a detailed study of their photophysical properties in solvents with various polarity and viscosity. We show that with a strong julolidine electron&#8208;donating group it is possible to combine intense cyanine&#8208;like absorption with the high sensitivity to viscosity of FMRs. We use this property to develop a lysosomal pH sensor and two bright cell&#8208;impermeant fluorogens targeting HaloTag for imaging membrane proteins. We believe that this bright fluorogenic scaffold based on a simple chemical structure can be used in the future to build up a variety of probes and sensors with efficient photophysical properties.

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembly of Supramolecular Double Helix from a Tetrapeptide and Direct Visualization by Scanning Tunneling Microscopy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 9, February 12, 2025. </description>

A 310&#8208;helical tetrapeptide, through a combination of H&#8208;bonds and C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; interactions, self&#8208;assembles to give a supramolecular double helix. We succeed in building such a double helix in both single crystals and on the HOPG surface with direct visualization by STM.







Abstract
This work reports single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD), Scanning Tunneling Microscopy (STM), and quantum mechanics calculations of the 310&#8208;helical peptide Z&#8208;(Aib)2&#8208;L&#8211;Dap(Boc)&#8208;Aib&#8208;NHiPr (Aib, &#945;&#8208;aminoisobutyric acid; Dap, 2,3&#8208;diaminopropionic acid; Z, benzyloxycarbonyl; Boc, t&#8208;butoxycarbonyl). The peptide forms a double&#8208;helical superstructure, studied by XRD and STM. Such architecture is rare in short peptides. Here, we show, by combining XRD and STM that this intriguing conformational feature is not driven by crystal packing; rather, it is an intrinsic property of this peptide. Indeed, the double helix is clearly detected also by STM, where crystal packing cannot be invoked. XRD reveals that intermolecular H&#8208;bonds stabilize two left&#8208;handed supra&#8208;helices (tertiary structure) that develop around a 6&#8208;fold screw axis. Then, two supra&#8208;helices are intertwined in a quaternary structure as a left&#8208;handed, double supra&#8208;helix, where C&#8722;H&#8943;&#960; interactions play a crucial role. STM images show the formation of long, isolated &#8220;necklaces&#8221; (&gt;110&#8197;nm). They are of left and right helical handedness. Their size agrees with the XRD finding. DFT calculations allowed us to weigh the contribution of the different intermolecular interactions in the two single supra&#8208;helices and the supramolecular double&#8208;helix. Interestingly, we were able to conclude that the contribution of the C&#8722;H&#8943;&#960; interactions to the binding energies is close to 50&#8201;%.

By using either monophosphine ligand based on 2,3&#8208;dihydrobenzo[d][1,3]oxaphosphole motif or bidentate ligand Ph&#8208;Phox, the regioselective alkoxycarbonylations of aryl&#8208;aryl, aryl&#8208;alkyl and alkyl&#8208;alkyl disubstituted alkynes are achieved, giving a diversity of trisubstituted &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated carboxylic esters with moderate to excellent yields and high regioselectivity.







Abstract
Pd&#8208;catalyzed alkoxycarbonylation of internal alkynes provides a straightforward access to &#945;,&#946;&#8208;disubstituted acrylic esters. Compared with the well&#8208;established regioselective alkoxycarbonylation of terminal alkynes, the regioselective hydrocarboxylation of non&#8208;functionalized unsymmetric internal alkynes was more challenging owing to the delicate differences of properties between the two substituents. Herein, by using either monophosphine ligand based on 2,3&#8208;dihydrobenzo[d][1,3]oxaphosphole motif or bidentate ligand Ph&#8208;Phox, the regioselective alkoxycarbonylations of aryl&#8208;aryl, aryl&#8208;alkyl and alkyl&#8208;alkyl disubstituted alkynes were achieved, giving a diversity of trisubstituted &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated carboxylic esters with moderate to excellent yields and high regioselectivity. The synthetic utility of obtained &#945;,&#946;&#8208;disubstituted acrylic esters was demonstrated.

We synthesized a series of Sn(IV) complexes of 20&#960;&#8208; and 19&#960;&#8208;electron 5,10,15,20&#8208;tetraaryl&#8208;5,15&#8208;diazaporphyrinoid (SnX2TADAP) derivatives by the complexation of the corresponding freebases with Sn(II) chloride and subsequent metathesis of the axial ligands. NMR spectroscopy, cyclic voltammetry, and density functional theory calculations of SnX2TADAP derivatives revealed that the paratropic ring&#8208;current effects arising from the planar 20&#960;&#8208;electron DAP ring increases with a decrease in the HOMO&#8211;LUMO energy gap.







Abstract
Porphyrinoids in the 20&#960;&#8208;electron state have been extensively studied from the fundamental viewpoint of investigating their structure&#8211;antiaromaticity relationships. However, most of the 20&#960; porphyrinoids are highly distorted and unstable in air, which hinder the comprehensive analysis of paratropic ring&#8208;current effects derived from planar &#960;&#8208;electron systems. Herein, we present the first examples of antiaromatic Sn(IV) complexes of 5,10,15,20&#8208;tetraaryl&#8208;5,15&#8208;diazaporphyrinoids (SnX2TADAPs), prepared by the complexation of the corresponding freebases with Sn(II) chloride under aerobic conditions and subsequent metathesis of the axial ligands, that show paratropic ring&#8208;current effects. Notably, both neutral 20&#960;&#8208;electron derivatives and 19&#960;&#8208;electron radical cations of SnX2TADAP are extremely stable in air owing to the intrinsic electronic effects of the central Sn(IV) unit and meso nitrogen atoms. NMR spectroscopy, cyclic voltammetry, and density functional theory calculations were performed to assess the ring&#8208;current effects and orbital energies of a series of the 20&#960;&#8208;electron SnX2TADAPs, and the results reveal that the paratropic ring&#8208;current effects arising from the planar 20&#960;&#8208;electron DAP ring increases with a decrease in the HOMO&#8211;LUMO energy gap.

&lt;p&gt;We synthesized a series of Sn(IV) complexes of 20&#960;- and 19&#960;-electron 5,10,15,20-tetraaryl-5,15-diazaporphyrinoid (SnX&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;TADAP) derivatives by the complexation of the corresponding freebases with Sn(II) chloride and subsequent metathesis of the axial ligands. NMR spectroscopy, cyclic voltammetry, and density functional theory calculations of SnX&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;TADAP derivatives revealed that the paratropic ring-current effects arising from the planar 20&#960;-electron DAP ring increases with a decrease in the HOMO&#8211;LUMO energy gap.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Porphyrinoids in the 20&#960;-electron state have been extensively studied from the fundamental viewpoint of investigating their structure&#8211;antiaromaticity relationships. However, most of the 20&#960; porphyrinoids are highly distorted and unstable in air, which hinder the comprehensive analysis of paratropic ring-current effects derived from planar &#960;-electron systems. Herein, we present the first examples of antiaromatic Sn(IV) complexes of 5,10,15,20-tetraaryl-5,15-diazaporphyrinoids (SnX&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;TADAPs), prepared by the complexation of the corresponding freebases with Sn(II) chloride under aerobic conditions and subsequent metathesis of the axial ligands, that show paratropic ring-current effects. Notably, both neutral 20&#960;-electron derivatives and 19&#960;-electron radical cations of SnX&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;TADAP are extremely stable in air owing to the intrinsic electronic effects of the central Sn(IV) unit and &lt;i&gt;meso&lt;/i&gt; nitrogen atoms. NMR spectroscopy, cyclic voltammetry, and density functional theory calculations were performed to assess the ring-current effects and orbital energies of a series of the 20&#960;-electron SnX&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;TADAPs, and the results reveal that the paratropic ring-current effects arising from the planar 20&#960;-electron DAP ring increases with a decrease in the HOMO&#8211;LUMO energy gap.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Twofold 6&#960;&#8208;Electrocyclization as a Route Toward Multi&#8208;Heteroatom&#8208;Doped Nanographenes Built on a 1,4&#8208;Dihydropyrrolo[3,2&#8208;b]pyrrole Core</title>

         <dc:description>
Strongly fluorescent N&#8208;doped nanographenes were prepared via straightforward three&#8208;steps route in overall yield reaching 25&#8201;%. This strategy is compatible with the presence of electron&#8208;withdrawing groups and is amenable to computational prediction of the output of the reaction based on symmetry of orbitals.







Abstract
Here we present a highly versatile synthetic strategy based on twofold 6&#960;&#8208;electrocyclization accompanied with HBr elimination as a novel approach towards centrosymmetric multi&#8208;heteroatom&#8208;doped nanographenes build around an electron&#8208;rich 1,4&#8208;dihydropyrrolo[3,2&#8208;b]pyrrole core. A straightforward synthesis from readily available substrates offers a unique possibility of fusing the 1,4&#8208;dihydropyrrolo[3,2&#8208;b]pyrrole subunit not only with carbocyclic building blocks, such as electron&#8208;deficient phenanthrenes, chrysenes, or [4]helicenes, but also with heterocyclic systems, such as benzo[b]furan and 5&#8208;thiatruxene. The clear advantage of this strategy is that there is no requirement to assemble complex scaffolds possessing bromoaryl units since bromine atom is introduced by bromination of 1,4&#8208;dihydropyrrolo[3,2&#8208;b]pyrrole core which, because of its exceptionally electron&#8208;rich character, is straightforward reaction. The obtained &#967;&#8208;shaped and S&#8208;shaped nanographenes containing 10 or more fused rings, exhibit visible&#8208;range emissions characterized by fluorescence quantum yields reaching 48&#8201;%. Computational studies of the reaction mechanism revealed that the 6&#960;&#8208;electrocyclization is kinetically favourable over photo&#8208;induced direct arylation. Steady&#8208;state UV/Visible spectroscopy reveals that upon photoexcitation, the prepared S&#8208;shaped N&#8208;doped nanographenes undergo mostly radiative relaxation leading to large fluorescence quantum yields. We anticipate that this chemistry will empower the creation of new materials with various functionalities.

         <title>Double Strain&#8208;Release (3+3)&#8208;Cycloaddition: Lewis Acid Catalyzed Reaction of Bicyclobutane Carboxylates and Aziridines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 9, February 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a Sc(OTf)3&#8208;catalyzed cycloaddition of highly strained bicyclo[1.1.0]butane carboxylates with protected aziridines. In this transformation, highly functionalized 2&#8208;azabiyclo[3.1.1]heptanes are accessed in single step under mild conditions. This is an example of strain&#8208;release driven transformation, where two highly strained rings combine to form bicyclic moieties which can serve as potential bioisosteres.







Abstract
A (3+3)&#8208;cycloaddition to afford 2&#8208;azabiyclo[3.1.1]heptanes was realized by reacting highly strained aryl bicyclo[1.1.0]butane (BCBs) carboxylates with tosylated aziridines. Under Sc(OTf)3 catalysis the transformation proceeded smoothly under mild conditions to the corresponding bicyclic products bearing at the bridgeheads of the embedded four&#8208;membered ring aryl and ester moieties, respectively. This reaction is a rare example of a cycloaddition of two highly strained ring systems under Lewis acid catalysis. Mechanistic experiments provided insights into the reaction mechanism.

         <title>Interfacial Oxygen Vacancy of CuOx&#8208;CeO2 Enhances H2O2 Activation and Pollutant Degradation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 9, February 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
By employing the ion exchange reverse loading strategy, the loading of inert CeO2 support onto reactive CuOx nanoparticles generates nanocomposite with abundant surface oxygen vacancies neighboring Cu and Ce as new active sites, resulting in remarkably improved activity for H2O2 activation and pollutant degradation.







Abstract
In the Fenton process, the development of catalysts with a wide pH range and good stability has been a long&#8208;term goal for water treatment purpose. This study proposes a strategy to solve this problem by preparing supported catalysts CuOx@CeO2&#8208;IE using an ion exchange reversed loading method. The generation of a large number of interfacial oxygen vacancies with Cu&#8208;OV&#8208;Ce (OV represents an oxygen vacancy site) structures prolongs the O&#8722;O bond of H2O2, promotes the rupture of the peroxide bond of H2O2, and thereby promotes the activation of H2O2 on the surface of the catalyst. The results show that with a H2O2 concentration of 5&#8197;mM and CuOx@CeO2&#8208;IE at 50&#8197;mg/L, the removal rate of bisphenol A is 94.1&#8201;% in 60&#8197;min, in which &#8226;&#8201;OH dominates the degradation process. Moreover, the system can operate well within a relatively wide pH range (4&#8211;8). This study provides a novel strategy for the design of Fenton catalysts with a wide pH suitability and excellent stability.

         <title>Carbon Monoxide and Alkoxycarbonyl Radical Enabled Migration Strategy for the Carbonylative Functionalization of Unactivated Alkenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 9, February 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new acylation&#8208;esterification type double functionalization of unactivated alkenes using alkyloxalkyl chlorides and CO as the reagents has been developed. The reaction proceeds through by the relay of carbon monoxide through the non&#8208;classical intramolecular functional group migration skeleton.







Abstract
Herein we report a &#8220;carbonylative migration&#8221; strategy for the acylation&#8208;esterification type double functionalization of unactivated alkenes using alkyloxalkyl chlorides and CO as the reagents. The transformation is proceeded by the alkoxycarbonyl radical addition to unactivated alkenes, followed by the insertion of carbon monoxide to induce intramolecular migration of heteroaryl groups, which is different from the traditional reaction modes. The reaction conditions were mild and well tolerated with varieties of functional groups. A variety of 1,4&#8208;dicarbonyl compounds with different ester groups were produced easily which has high potential applications in biology, medicine, and other fields.

A hydroxyl&#8208;tagged porous aromatic framework was task&#8208;specifically designed to be used as a platform for a PAF&#8208;immobilized proline&#8208;type chiral catalyst with excellent catalytic activity, diastereoselectivity, enantioselectivity, complete and easy recyclability when catalyzing the aldol reaction.







Abstract
A hydroxyl&#8208;tagged porous aromatic framework PAF&#8208;NBU2&#8208;OH was task&#8208;specifically designed and successfully synthesized targeted toward immobilizing chiral catalysts. Using proline&#8208;type compound as model chiral organocatalyst, PAF&#8208;NBU2&#8208;OH was used as a platform to covalently link proline&#8208;type group. The obtained PAF&#8208;immobilized organocatalyst PAF&#8208;NBU2&#8208;OPro featured high chemical stability in different solvents even under very harsh conditions. PAF&#8208;NBU2&#8208;OPro showed excellent catalytic activity, diastereoselectivity and enantioselectivity with complete and easy recyclability when catalyzing the aldol reaction between p&#8208;nitrobenzaldehyde and cyclohexanone, which could undergo at least 30 cycles without any activity, diastereoselectivity or enantioselectivity loss for catalyzing the current reaction.

         <title>In&#8208;situ Reduced Cu3N Nanocrystals Enable High&#8208;Efficiency Ammonia Synthesis and Zinc&#8208;nitrate Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 9, February 12, 2025. </description>

Cu&#8208;based compound containing Cu3N is synthesized through a simple one&#8208;step pyrolysis method, applied it to electrocatalytic NO3RR, and tested the performance of the Zn&#8208;NO3&#8722; battery. The Cu3N exhibits NH3 yield of 173.7&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;2, with FENH3 reaching 91.0&#8201;% at &#8722;0.3&#8197;V vs. RHE, which assembles a Zn&#8208;NO3&#8722; battery.







Abstract
Nitrate reduction reaction (NO3RR) involves an 8&#8208;electron transfer process and competes with the hydrogen evolution reaction process, resulting in lower yields and Faraday efficiency (FE) in the process of NH3 synthesis. Especially, Cu&#8208;based catalysts (Cu0 and Cu+) have been investigated in the field of NO3RR due to the energy levels of d&#8208;orbital and the least unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) &#960;* of nitrate's orbital. Based on the above, we synthesized a Cu&#8208;based compound containing Cu3N (Cu+) through a simple one&#8208;step pyrolysis method, applied it to electrocatalytic NO3RR, and tested the performance of the Zn&#8208;NO3&#8722; battery. Through various characterization analyses, Cu&#8208;based catalysts (Cu+) are the key active sites in reduction reactions, making Cu3N a potential catalyst for ammonia synthesis. The research results indicate the application of Cu3N catalyst in NO3RR shows the best NH3 yield of 173.7&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;2 with FENH3 reaching 91.0&#8201;% at &#8722;0.3&#8197;V vs. RHE, which is much higher than that of Cu catalyst without N. In addition, the Zn&#8208;NO3&#8722; battery based on Cu3N electrode also exhibits an NH3 yield of 39.8&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;2 63.0&#8201;% FENH3, and a power density of 2.7&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2 as well as stable cycling charge&#8208;discharge stability for 5&#8197;hours. This work guides the application of Cu3N enhanced regulation of the active site in the electrocatalytic synthesis of NH3 from NO3RR.

         <title>General Acetal&#8208;Protected Aldehyde Strategy for Facile Synthesis of Covalent Organic Frameworks with Splendid Crystallinity and Uniform Morphology</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 9, February 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We proposed a general acetal&#8208;protected aldehyde protocol for the facile synthesis of imine&#8208;linked COFs, which enables the simultaneous optimization of crystallinity and morphology. This synthetic approach demonstrates broad adaptability across various framework topologies, precursor species, and synthetic solvent systems, simplifying the typically laborious solvent screening process in COF synthesis.







Abstract
Crystallinity and morphology are critical factors that closely related to the properties and applications of covalent organic frameworks (COFs). However, the controlled synthesis of COFs with both high crystallinity and uniform morphology remains a significant challenge due to uncontrollable polymerization and complex reaction conditions. In this work, we present a general acetal&#8208;protected aldehyde protocol for the facile synthesis of imine&#8208;linked COFs, which enables the simultaneous optimization of crystallinity and morphology. Of the acetal&#8208;protected aldehydes explored, ethanediol&#8208;protected terephthalaldehyde (Tp&#8208;E) emerged as the most effective, balancing stability and reactivity to yield highly crystalline Py&#8208;COF&#8208;E with a well&#8208;defined hollow spherical morphology and a significantly enhanced BET surface area compared to its aldehyde&#8208;based counterpart Py&#8208;COF. This synthetic approach demonstrates broad adaptability across various framework topologies, precursor species, and synthetic solvent systems, simplifying the typically laborious solvent screening process in COF synthesis. Furthermore, Py&#8208;DBT&#8208;COF&#8208;E showed superior photocatalytic H2 evolution performance relative to Py&#8208;DBT&#8208;COF, despite their identical chemical compositions, emphasizing the critical role of crystallinity and morphology in determining functional performance. Overall, this study provides a versatile methodology for the controlled synthesis of COFs and offers valuable insights into the interconnected roles of morphology, crystallinity, and material performance.

Gold&#8208;catalyzed nucleophilic propargylations of azinium ions with a propargylboronate give functionalized 1,4&#8208;dihydropyridines, 1,2&#8208;dihydropyridines, 1,4&#8208;dihydroquinolines, 1,2&#8208;dihydroquinolines, and 4,5&#8208;dihydropyrazines in good yields and high regioselectivities. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicate that hydroxydihydroazine intermediates formed by the addition of LiOH to the azinium ions are the reactive electrophiles.







Abstract
The nucleophilic propargylation of azinium ions with a propargylboronate proceeds efficiently under gold(I) catalysis. A range of N&#8208;alkylated pyridinium, quinolinium, and pyrazinium ions undergo propargylation with good yields and high regioselectivities to give various functionalized 1,4&#8208;dihydropyridines, 1,2&#8208;dihydropyridines, 1,4&#8208;dihydroquinolines, 1,2&#8208;dihydroquinolines, and 4,5&#8208;dihydropyrazines. No allenylation side&#8208;products are observed. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations provided insight into the mechanisms of these reactions. Hydroxydihydroazine intermediates formed by the addition of LiOH to the azinium ions were found to be the reactive electrophiles in these reactions.

Hydroxydihydroazine intermediates formed by the addition of LiOH to the azinium ions were found to be the reactive electrophiles in these reactions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Nucleophilic Triphenylgermanides of Magnesium and Calcium</title>

Reactions of the dimeric alkaline earth hydrides, [(BDI)AeH]2 (BDI=HC{(Me)CNDipp}2; Dipp=2,6&#8208;i&#8208;Pr2C6H3; Ae=Mg, Ca), with Ph3GeH in the presence of THF provide H2 and [(BDI)AeGePh3(THF)]. Although the synthesis of the magnesium derivative is complicated by THF ring opening, the calcium reagent is a viable source of the triphenylgermanide nucleophile.







Abstract
The dimeric calcium and magnesium hydrides, [(BDI)AeH]2 [BDI=HC{(Me)CNDipp}2, Dipp=2,6&#8208;i&#8208;Pr2C6H3; Ae=Mg or Ca] do not react with Ph3GeH in non&#8208;coordinating solvent. Addition of THF, however, induces deprotonation and access to monomeric Ae&#8208;germanide complexes, [(BDI)Ae{GePh3}(THF)], both of which have been structurally characterized. Although this process is facile when Ae=Ca, the analogous magnesium&#8208;based reaction requires heating to temperatures &gt;100&#8201;&#176;C, under which conditions germanide formation is complicated by THF ring opening and the generation of an alkaline earth germyl&#8208;C&#8208;terminated n&#8208;butoxide, [(BDI)Mg{&#956;2&#8208;O(CH2)4GePh3}]. Reactions of [(BDI)Ca{GePh3}(THF)] with N,N&#8242;&#8208;di&#8208;isopropylcarbodiimide and benzophenone provide the respective germylamidinate and germylalkoxide derivatives, [(BDI)Ca{(i&#8208;PrN)2CGePh3}(THF)] and [(BDI)Ca{OC(GePh3)Ph2}(THF)], demonstrating its potential as a well&#8208;defined and soluble source of the [Ph3Ge]&#8722; anion in nucleophilic addition reactions.

         <title>Directly Fused Porphyrin&#8208;Tetracyanopentacenequinone Conjugates: Role of the Cross&#8208;Conjugated, Powerful Electron Acceptor in Promoting Highly Efficient Charge Separation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 9, February 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultrafast charge separation in new cross&#8208;conjugated donor&#8208;acceptor conjugates derived from tetracyanopentacene&#8208;quinone and porphyrin is reported. Facile reduction and fusion promoted charge transfer in the ground and excited states, while TD&#8208;DFT studies pinpointed the different excited states that promote charge transfer.







Abstract
Tetracyanopentacenequinone, a powerful electron acceptor, is fused directly to the porphyrin &#960;&#8208;system to create a new class of donor&#8208;acceptor conjugates. Owing to the direct fusion and electron&#8208;deficient property of tetracyanopentacenequinone, strong intramolecular charge transfer both in the ground and excited states was witnessed. As a control, porphyrin fused with pentacenequinone was also investigated. Upon complete spectral and electrochemical characterization, the excited state properties were initially probed by time&#8208;dependent DFT studies, and the occurrence of electron transfer from different excited states was established. Free&#8208;energy calculations revealed higher exothermic electron transfer (&gt;600&#8197;mV) than the control pentacenequinone&#8208;porphyrin systems. Pump&#8208;probe studies covering broad spatial and temporal regions revealed efficient excited state charge separation. This was unlike the control pentacenequinone&#8208;porphyrin system, where slow charge separation was witnessed only in the case of the zinc derivatives but not the free&#8208;base ones, followed by the populating of the triplet excited state. The lifetimes of the charge&#8208;separated states ranged between 30&#8211;500&#8197;ps depending on the solvent and metal ion in the porphyrin cavity. Nanosecond transient absorption studies established the charge recombination path to populate the triplet state of porphyrin or directly to the ground state as a function of solvent polarity and the nature of the conjugate. The significance of cross&#8208;conjugated tetracyanopentacenequinone fused directly to the porphyrin &#960; system in promoting highly exothermic and efficient charge separation, irrespective of its cross conjugation, is borne out from this study.

&#960;&#8208;Extended phenazines with four to seven annulated rings were synthesized via gold&#8208;catalysis and Buchwald&#8208;Hartwig cross&#8208;coupling reactions. These N&#8208;heteropolycycles were studied using UV/Vis, fluorescence and X&#8208;ray spectroscopy, along with theoretical calculations, revealing interesting structural properties and optical band gaps as low as 2.12&#8197;eV.







Abstract
Novel fused phenazines were synthesized through a combination of gold&#8208;catalyzed hydroamination and cascade cyclization reactions towards azaacenes. In total, 30 new compounds were synthesized and investigated with respect to their structural and optoelectronic properties. In solution, these targets exhibit strong green to red emission, with quantum yields of up to 60&#8201;%. The emission wavelength can be finely adjusted by the choice of solvent due to their solvatochromic behavior, as demonstrated with a representative example.

         <title>Synthesis of Lewis Acid&#8208;Base Adducts Between Potassium Dihydrogenpnictogenides and Group 13 Lewis Acids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 9, February 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work we investigated the Lewis acid&#8208;base properties of potassium dihydrogenpnictogenides and potassium bis(trimethylsilyl)pnictogenides towards different trialkyl trieles (Triel=B&#8722;In) and BH3. The presented compounds were investigated by X&#8208;ray structure analysis, NMR spectroscopy, infrared spectroscopy and elemental analysis.







Abstract
Lewis acid&#8208;base adducts between potassium dihydrogenpnictogenides [K(18c6)PnH2] (Pn=P, As) and Trialkylgallanes (GaMe3, GaEt3, GatBu3) as well as BH3 were synthesized. In the course of these investigations, we were able to fully characterize a row of compounds of the type [K(18c6)(thf)0&#8208;2][PnH2(ER3)2] (E=B: R=H; E=Ga: R=Me, Et, tBu). Based on the successful syntheses of these species, we also synthesized several compounds of the composition [K(18c6)(thf)0&#8208;2][Pn(SiMe3)2(ER3)n] (n=1, 2) starting from [KPn(SiMe3)2] (Pn=P and As) and ER3 (E=B, Al, In: R=Me; E=Ga: R=Me, Et, tBu). All isolated compounds, were examined by NMR spectroscopy, infra&#8208;red spectroscopy and elemental analysis. A selection of the compounds presented were also examined by means of X&#8208;ray structure analysis on the single crystal. The obtained adducts of negatively charged [PnH2]&#8722; and [Pn(SiMe3)2]&#8722; fragments with Lewis acids are a class of compounds that has scarcely been investigated to date.

Based on the successful syntheses of these species, we also synthesized several compounds of the composition [K(18c6)(thf)&lt;sub&gt;0-2&lt;/sub&gt;][Pn(SiMe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(ER&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;] (n=1, 2) starting from [KPn(SiMe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;] (Pn=P and As) and ER&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (E=B, Al, In: R=Me; E=Ga: R=Me, Et, &lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;Bu). All isolated compounds, were examined by NMR spectroscopy, infra-red spectroscopy and elemental analysis. A selection of the compounds presented were also examined by means of X-ray structure analysis on the single crystal. The obtained adducts of negatively charged [PnH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; and [Pn(SiMe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; fragments with Lewis acids are a class of compounds that has scarcely been investigated to date.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Photocatalyzed Dehydration of 1&#8208;Aryl&#8208;1,2&#8208;Ethanediols to Methyl Ketones Driven by Eosin Y Fragmentation Products</title>

&#8220;How would you remove water from your molecule with light?&#8221; Herein, we report a mild photocatalytic dehydration protocol for aryl&#8208;1,2&#8208;ethanediols. Our mechanistic studies suggest a hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) and a 1,2&#8208;spin center shift (SCS) as key steps. Eosin Y photodissociation products serve as a highly efficient catalytic mixture.







Abstract
Herein, we report a mild photocatalytic redox&#8208;neutral dehydration of aryl&#8208;1,2&#8208;ethanediols forming the respective methyl ketones. In the proposed mechanistic cycle an initial hydrogen atom abstraction (HAT) is followed by a 1,2&#8208;spin center shift (SCS) as key steps. Interestingly, Eosin Y was found to act as a pre&#8208;catalyst dissociating into a catalytically active mixture under irradiation. To the best of our knowledge, this exemplifies the first synthetic utilization of Eosin Y degradation products. As a result, our reaction can be realized with a single organic photocatalyst and releases water as a sole by&#8208;product.

An unprecedented bis(hexahapto)&#8208;coordination mode for terphenyl substituents was identified in reaction of deprotonated Ar*GeH3 with [(COD)RhCl]2 followed by chloride abstraction. The germanium bridged cationic dirhodium complex features a delocalized [Rh&#8722;Ge&#8722;Rh] &#960;&#8208;system. The [RhGeRh]&#8208;cation abstracts a chloride ligand from transition metal chloride complexes and acts as metal&#8208;only Lewis base chelating the metal fragments.







Abstract
Terphenylgermanium Ar*Ge [Ar*=C6H3(2,6&#8208;Trip)2, Trip=2,4,6&#8208;C6H2iPr3] was found to act as a novel &#956;2&#8208;Ge&#8208;bis(hexahapto&#8208;Trip) bridging ligand. Deprotonated terphenyl germanium trihydride [Li(thf)3][Ar*GeH2] (1) undergoes reductive elimination and transfer of hydrogen in reaction with dimeric [(COD)RhCl]2 to yield the dinuclear complex [Ar*GeRh(COE)RhCl(COD)] (2). Subsequent chloride abstraction from compound 2 using Na[BArF4] or Li[Al(OtBuF)4] results in the cationic complexes [Ar*GeRh(COE)Rh(COD)][WCA] (3) {WCA: [BArF4]&#8722; (ArF=C6H3&#8211;3,5&#8208;(CF3)2), [Al(OtBuF)4]&#8722;}. Ligand exchange of olefin for CO yields the carbonyl complex [Ar*Ge(Rh(CO))2][BArF4] (4). In an alternative approach to the synthesis of carbonyl complex 4, [Li(thf)3][Ar*GeH2] (1) was treated with [Rh(CO)2Cl]2 leading to the isolation of a hexanuclear rhodium cluster [(&#956;3&#8208;Ar*Ge)2{Rh(CO)2}6(&#956;3&#8208;H)2] (5) in reasonable yield. In reactions with [Rh(CO)2Cl]2 or [Ph3PAuCl] complex 4 abstracts the chloride ligand and forms tetranuclear complexes featuring a GeRh3&#8208; or GeRh2Au&#8208;rectangle, [Ar*GeCl(Rh3(CO)4)][BArF4] (6), or [Ar*GeCl{Rh2(CO)2}(AuPPh3)][BArF4] (7).

         <title>Stereodivergent Macrocyclization in Dynamic Chiral Confinement</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 9, February 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Full stereodivergence in a macrocyclization event can be achieved by implementing a dynamic chirality switching into robust confinement using a repeatedly switchable chiral capsule. The consecutive chirality switching enables the confined reactions of an enclosed achiral substrate to sequentially install multiple chirality with full stereocontrol by changing only a sequence of physical stimuli.







Abstract
The absolute and relative configurations of a macrocyclic natural product bearing multiple chirality have a crucial influence on its physical and biological properties. Nevertheless, their preparation with full stereocontrol remains largely unexplored in synthetic community. Here, we show a stereodivergent macrocyclization under dynamic chiral confinement in which the stepwise chirality switching of a chiral space directs complete stereocontrol. To confine a substrate in a dynamic chiral space, we used a chiral capsule enclosing a substrate which is collectively switchable in the chirality in response to external stimuli, but their conformations are firmly fixed by subsequent self&#8208;assembly. The consecutive chirality switching enables the confined reactions of an enclosed achiral substrate to sequentially install diverse chirality on a macrocycle product with full stereocontrol in a single pot operation, thus changing only a sequence of physical stimuli enables access to a remarkable stereodivergence in a macrocyclization process.

         <title>Near&#8208;Quantitative Removal of Oxalate and Terephthalate from Water by Precipitation with a Rigid Bis&#8208;Amidinium Compound</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 9, February 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple precipitant removes oxalate and terephthalate from water and shows remarkable selectivity over other anions including halides, other polycarboxylates and sulfate. Once oxalate/terephthalate has been removed from water, the precipitant can be regenerated easily and effectively for subsequent re&#8208;use.







Abstract
A simple, readily&#8208;prepared precipitant (1&#8901;Cl2) precipitates oxalate or terephthalate from water with very high efficacy, removing these anions at sub&#8208;millimolar concentrations using only one equivalent of precipitant.

     alt="Near-Quantitative Removal of Oxalate and Terephthalate from Water by Precipitation with a Rigid Bis-Amidinium Compound"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A simple precipitant removes oxalate and terephthalate from water and shows remarkable selectivity over other anions including halides, other polycarboxylates and sulfate. Once oxalate/terephthalate has been removed from water, the precipitant can be regenerated easily and effectively for subsequent re-use.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A simple, readily-prepared precipitant (&lt;b&gt;1&#8901;Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;) precipitates oxalate or terephthalate from water with very high efficacy, removing these anions at sub-millimolar concentrations using only one equivalent of precipitant. A simple aqueous base/acid cycle can be used to regenerate &lt;b&gt;1&#8901;Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; after use. The resulting precipitates, &lt;b&gt;1&#8901;oxalate&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;1&#8901;terephthalate&lt;/b&gt;, are anhydrous and closely-packed, with each anion receiving eight charge-assisted hydrogen bonds from amidinium N&#8722;H donors.

         <title>Pd/Cu Catalyzed Asymmetric Allylation for Stereodivergent Synthesis of Glutamic Acid Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 9, February 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A branched, diastereo&#8208; and enantioselective coupling of Morita&#8208;Baylis&#8208;Hillman carbonates and Schiff bases derived from simple amino acids has been developed via synergistic Pd/Cu catalysis. This protocol features high efficiency, mild conditions, and a broad substrate scope, providing a series of &#946;&#8208;branched glutamic acid derivatives with adjacent 3&#176;/3&#176; or 3&#176;/4&#176; stereocenters in high yields and excellent enantiomeric excess.







Abstract
A synergistic Pd/Cu catalyst system has been developed for stereodivergent transformation of Morita&#8208;Baylis&#8208;Hillman (MBH) carbonates and Schiff bases derived from simple amino acids to afford a series of optically active &#946;&#8208;branched &#947;&#8208;methyleneglutamic acid derivatives with adjacent tertiary/tertiary and quaternary/tertiary stereocenters in high yields (up to 96&#8201;%) with excellent diastereo&#8208; and enantioselectivities (&gt;20/1 dr and &gt;99&#8201;% ee in most cases) under mild conditions. The use of SKP ligand is disclosed to be crucial for the success of the transformation, and in particular allowing the reaction to proceed at low catalyst loading (0.02&#8197;mol&#8201;% for Pd and 0.08&#8197;mol&#8201;% for Cu). The high efficiency of the catalysis was attributed to the formation of intimate ion pair complex A1, composed of Pd&#8208;phosphonium cation and a t&#8208;butoxide anion, which would facilitate the subsequent deprotonation and C&#8722;C coupling events. All four stereoisomers of the &#946;&#8208;branched glutamic acid derivatives were readily prepared by permutation of the catalyst enantiomers. Synthetic utility of the methodology was exemplified by efficient synthesis of a fused pyrrolooxazolidinone with three contiguous chiral centers, highlighting the power of synergistic Pd/Cu catalysis for asymmetric allylic alkylation with MBH carbonates.

         <title>Sulfonatocalix[4]arene&#8208;Based Scavengers for V&#8208;Type Nerve Agents with Enhanced Detoxification Activity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 9, February 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two is better than one. The introduction of a second hydroxamic acid substituents along the cavity of a sulfonatocalix[4]arene improves the activity with which this compound detoxifies highly toxic nerve agents of the V&#8208;type to such an extent that its use as an antidote is now conceivable.







Abstract
Synthetic small molecule scavengers that rapidly detoxify nerve agents in&#8197;vivo allow (pre)treatment of nerve agent poisoning. However, scavengers that detoxify persistent V&#8208;type nerve agents at pH&#8197;7.4 and 37&#8201;&#176;C with sufficient efficiency are still unknown. The most promising compound to date is a monosubstituted sulfonatocalix[4]arene containing a hydroxamic acid group. This compound was used to investigate the effect of structural modifications on detoxification activity. While none of the monosubstituted calixarene derivatives considered in this context possessed higher activity than the parent compound, the disubstituted derivatives were very active, exhibiting half&#8208;lives of detoxification under the conditions of an established in&#8197;vitro assay of &lt;1.5&#8197;min. The rate of detoxification decreased with decreasing scavenger concentration, but even at a fourfold molar excess of the scavenger, complete detoxification of 2.5&#8197;&#956;M solutions of some nerve agents could be achieved within one hour. These disubstituted calixarene derivatives thus bring synthetic scavengers for V&#8208;type nerve agents closer to application.

The Front Cover illustrates an enzymatic biofuel cell, composed of a glucose oxidase anode and a bilirubin oxidase cathode, producing electricity, symbolized by the high&#8208;voltage pylons. Magnetohydrodynamic convection, depicted as mini&#8208;tornados, is induced around the electrodes when the cell is exposed to a magnetic field having an orthogonal orientation with respect to the electrode surfaces. This significantly enhances mass transport, leading to an increase in power output by up to 300&#8201;%. More information can be found in the Research Article by N. Mano, A. Kuhn and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202403329).

Molecules that rapidly detoxify nerve agents under physiological conditions might be useful to treat nerve agent poisoning or to support existing treatment strategies. In their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202404321), S. Kubik and co&#8208;workers show that a sulfonatocalix[4]arene derivative containing two hydroxamic acid residues deactivates highly toxic and persistent V&#8208;type nerve agents such as VX with very promising activity. Moreover, the observed increase in activity over the corresponding monosubstituted calixarene appears to be more than just a statistical effect, but also seems to involve additional beneficial effects of the two substituents. This work thus brings supramolecular small&#8208;molecule nerve agent scavengers closer to application.

The iron(II) spin&#8208;crossover complex ([Fe(NH2trz)3](NO3)2) catalyzes the formation of imine from 4&#8208;amino&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;triazole. The proposed catalytic mechanism involves two sequential post&#8208;synthetic modification (PSM) reactions. In the first PSM, an imine complex is formed through the interaction of the amine complex with the aldehyde. In the second PSM, the imine complex reacts with aminotriazole, resulting in the release of the imine into the solution and the regeneration of the amine complex. More information can be found in the Research Article by L. Routaboul, A. Bousseksou and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202403412).

         <title>The Chemical Recovery of PMMA into Monomer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 9, February 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, we provide a review about the researches of chemical recovery of PMMA into monomer. Firstly, the pyrolysis of general PMMA at high temperature is illustrated by some typical research works. Subsequently, the depolymerization of end&#8208;functionalized PMMA under mild conditions is highlighted and discussed in detail, as this approach has emerged and achieved significant progresses in the past several years.







Abstract
Polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA), commonly known as plexiglass, is widely used in the areas of aircraft, automobile, construction and transplants, due to its high mechanical strength, good corrosion resistance, and excellent compatibility with human tissue. With the increase in production and usage of PMMA, the vast accumulation of PMMA waste has posed a challenge to the recycling of PMMA waste. However, at present, only less than 10&#8201;% of PMMA is recycled each year. The cost&#8208;effective chemical recovery of PMMA into monomer with high efficiency has attracted wide attention and has become one of the hot research subjects. The chemical recovery of PMMA into monomer are realized mainly via two approaches, including the pyrolysis of common PMMA at high temperature and the depolymerization of end&#8208;functionalized PMMA under mild conditions. The second approach has emerged and achieved significant progresses in the past several years. Herein, we provide a review about the researches of chemical recovery of PMMA into monomer. Firstly, the pyrolysis of general PMMA at high temperature is illustrated by typical research works. Subsequently, the depolymerization of end&#8208;functionalized PMMA under mild conditions is highlighted and discussed, as this approach is more in line with the green and sustainable development of polymer chemistry.

         <title>Advances in Chiral Macrocycles: Molecular Design and Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 9, February 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review highlights recent progress in the design and synthesis of chiral macrocycles, with a focus on their central, axial, helical, and planar chirality. These distinct chiral types impart unique structural and chiroptical properties, enabling a wide range of applications in fields such as enantioselective recognition, asymmetric catalysis, and circularly polarized luminescence.







Abstract
Chiral macrocycles have recently emerged as promising materials for enantioselective recognition, asymmetric catalysis, and circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) due to their terminal&#8208;free structure, preorganized chiral cavities, and unique host&#8208;guest and self&#8208;assembly properties. This review summarizes recent advances in the design and synthesis of chiral macrocycles with central, axial, helical, and planar chirality, each imparting distinct structural and chiroptical characteristics. We highlight key strategies for constructing these macrocycles and their applications in optoelectronic and catalytic systems. Emphasis is placed on the balance between rigidity and flexibility in macrocycle design, essential for effective molecular recognition, adaptable catalysis, and CPL. We conclude with perspectives on future opportunities, anticipating ongoing developments in chiral macrocycle research.

         <title>Identification of Natural Killer Cell Enhancers Through Mimicking of the Tumor Microenvironment</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The tumor microenvironment (TME) is a pro&#8208;cancerous niche harboring immunosuppressive factors that are secreted by cancer cells and the surrounding cancer&#8208;supportive tissue, such as kynurenine, prostaglandin E2 and transforming growth factor &#946; (TGF&#946;). These factors dampen the activity of cytotoxic lymphocytes like natural killer (NK) cells, allowing evasion of immune cell&#8208;mediated killing. To identify small molecules that counteract the immunosuppressive effect of the TME and restore NK cell&#8208;mediated cytotoxicity, we developed a phenotypic co&#8208;culture assay of cancer cells and primary lymphocytes suitable for medium&#8208;throughput screening. We discovered small molecules that restore NK cell&#8208;mediated cytotoxicity through diverse mechanisms. The potent TGF&#946; type I receptor (TGF&#946;R&#8208;1) inhibitor, RepSox, stood out as superior to other TGF&#946;R&#8208;1 inhibitors due to its ability to abolish the effects of both inhibitory factors used in our setup. This mode of action goes beyond
TGF&#946;R&#8208;1 inhibition and is related to the simultaneous abrogation of cyclooxygenase 1 (COX1) activity.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Both methyl groups and benzene rings are exceedingly common, and they lie near one another in many chemical situations.&#160; DFT calculations are used to gauge the strength of the attractive forces between them, and to better understand the phenomena that underlie this attraction.&#160; Methane and benzene are taken as the starting point, and substituents of both electron&#8208;withdrawing and donating types are added to each.&#160; The interaction energy varies between 1.4 and 5.0 kcal/mol, depending upon the substituents placed on the two groups.&#160; The nature of the binding is analyzed via Atoms in Molecules (AIM), Natural Bond Orbital (NBO), Symmetry&#8208;Adapted Perturbation Theory (SAPT), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) chemical shifts, and electron density shift diagrams.&#160; While there is a sizable electrostatic component, it is dispersion that dominates these interactions, particularly the weaker ones.&#160; As such, these interactions cannot be categorized unambiguously as either H&#8208;bonds or tetrel bonds.</dc:description>

         <title>Dual&#8208;Functional Synthetic Linear and Cyclic Peptides with Anti&#8208;Amyloid and Antimicrobial Activities for Alzheimer's disease</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dual&#8208;functional peptides exhibiting both anti&#8208;amyloid and antimicrobial activities have attracted attention as promising candidates for Alzheimer's disease treatment. The advantage of these peptides lies in their ability to simultaneously target both the amyloid cascade hypothesis and the microbial infection hypothesis, in contrast to single&#8208;function inhibitors. However, most of the reported dual&#8208;functional peptides to date are natural peptides, and the development of synthetic peptides in this area remains limited. In this study, we propose two strategies to aid in the discovery of synthetic dual&#8208;functional peptides. We then report four distinct synthetic dual&#8208;functional peptides identified using these strategies, with the A&#946;1&#8208;40/A&#946;1&#8208;42 fibrillation system and common bacterial strains serving as a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept platform. One strategy involves repurposing existing knowledge, while the other breaks from established conventions. Using the first strategy, we discovered a very short dual&#8208;functional linear peptide. With the second strategy, we identified a simple dual&#8208;functional cyclic peptide. Furthermore, by combining these two strategies, we developed a hybrid dual&#8208;functional peptide incorporating both linear and cyclic structures. We hope that our findings will contribute to the future discovery of more synthetic dual&#8208;functional peptides for treating Alzheimer's disease.</dc:description>

         <title>Syntheses of Carbazoles by Photosensitized Electrocyclization of Triarylamines. Effect of Inductive Electron&#8208;Withdrawing Groups on the Photocyclization.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The acetone&#8208;sensitized [6&#960;]&#8208;electrocyclization of unsubstituted, mono&#8208;, and disubstituted triarylamines TAAs (substituents: H, CH&#8323;, CH&#8323;O, Cl, CnF&#8322;n+1; n = 1, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10) under 310 nm light led to the formation of endo&#8208; and exo&#8208;carbazoles in high yields; particularly, TAAs substituted with inductive electron&#8208;withdrawing groups (Cl, CnF2n+1) exhibit remarkable endo&#8208;selectivity towards cyclization. For TAAs substituted with both inductive electron&#8208; withdrawing and donating groups, the photocyclization towards endo carbazoles is dictated by the presence of the electron&#8208;withdrawing groups. Chemical yields (%), quantum yields of conversion (&#981;R), apparent cyclization rate constants (kcyc), and Hammett plots correlations are illustrated for all substituted TAAs in acetone. Photophysical studies reveal that TAAs substituted with resonance electron&#8208;withdrawing groups (OAc, NO2, CHO) do not undergo electrocyclization in acetone at 310 nm due to formation of charge&#8208;transfer complexes that vastly deactivate the triplet reactive manifold, paralleling the behavior observed in MeCN as solvent. Absorption and emission spectra, Stoke shifts, and singlet excited state energies are illustrated for substituted TAAs and carbazoles. In&#8208;silico studies support the high stereoselectivity observed for the preferred endo&#8208; photosensitized [6&#960;]&#8208;electrocyclization of Cl&#8208; and perfluoroalkyl&#8208;substituted TAAs.</dc:description>

         <title>Peripheral Modification Strategy of Heavy Atom for High&#8208;Performance Multi&#8208;Resonance Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Emitters</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic light&#8208;emitting materials with multi&#8208;resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) have shown great potential for realizing highly efficient narrowband organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs). However, the heavy efficiency roll&#8208;off caused by the slow reverse intersystem crossing (RISC) process remains a challenging issue for the further practical application of MR&#8208;TADF materials. Here, we develop two TADF emitters, BNDBT and BNDBF, in which the dibenzothiophene and dibenzofuran substituents are attached at the bottom of the B/N frameworks. They all exhibit the similar high photoluminescence quantum yields of 90% and 87%. The sulfur&#8208;containing material BNDBT exhibits a RISC rate (kRISC) of 6.02&#8201;&#215;&#8201;104&#8201;s&#8722;1, which is three&#8208;folded higher than BNDBF (2.09&#8201;&#215;&#8201;104&#8201;s&#8722;1) without heavy atom. The corresponding green OLED based on BNDBT exhibits an improved external quantum efficiency of 35.5% and lower efficiency roll&#8208;offs at high brightnesses of 100&#8201;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2 and 1000&#8201;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2, respectively. In addition, the BNDBT&#8208;based OLED maintains high color purity without causing a sharp increase in FWHM as compared with that of BNDBF. This work indicates that introducing the heavy atom at the bottom of the B/N skeleton is an effective strategy to enhance kRISC while maintaining narrow FWHM, thereby achieving high&#8208;performance MR&#8208;TADF emitters.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>A solvent&#8208;free synthesis of valuable monofluoroalkenes was developed under ball&#8208;milling agitation. The use of 1.0 equivalent of carbonyl substrates and 1.1 equivalent of fluorophosphonoacetate derivatives with a weak inorganic base enabled the formation of the desired products after 30 min of reaction under sustainable conditions with minimized synthetic waste. No sequential addition of base, fluorophosphonate, and carbonyl substrates was needed, and the desired products were obtained with high purity only after a simple filtration. The protocol showed general efficiency and tolerance to a large panel of carbonyl substrates including aldehydes and ketones, as well as fluorophosphonoacetate derivatives with moderate stereoselectivities and yields ranging from 21 % to 99 % (48 examples).</dc:description>

         <title>Doubly Linked Azulene Dimer: A Novel Non&#8208;benzenoid Isomer of Perylene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new non&#8208;benzenoid isomer of perylene described as a doubly linked azulene dimer has been successfully synthesized. This compound exhibits not only the reversible redox behaviors and p&#8208;type semiconductivity but also one of the narrowest values of the optical band gap among the hitherto reported non&#8208;benzenoid PAHs.







Abstract
We report herein the synthesis of an unprecedented isomer of perylene, dicyclohepta[cd,fg]&#8208;as&#8208;indacene bearing two phenyl groups (1&#8208;Ph) by the nickel&#8208;mediated intramolecular homocoupling of a 4,4&#8217;&#8208;biazulene derivative (2). The X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis and theoretical calculations revealed that 1&#8208;Ph adopts a unique helically twisted geometry although the local aromaticity of azulene moieties was preserved. The double covalent linkage of the two azulene skeletons imparts significant orbital interaction, which affords near&#8208;infrared (NIR) absorption (up to 1720&#8197;nm) and remarkable redox behaviors despite its closed&#8208;shell electronic structure. The optical band gap of 1&#8208;Ph is calculated to be 0.72&#8197;eV from its absorption onset, which is one of the narrowest values among the hitherto reported air&#8208;stable non&#8208;benzenoid PAHs. Furthermore, the thin&#8208;film of 1&#8208;Ph serves as a p&#8208;type semiconductor. Our study offers fundamental insights into not only the aromaticity with the nonalternant topologies of 1&#8208;Ph but also its potential application in novel organic electronics.

         <title>Physicochemical Properties of New Ionic Liquids and Plastic Crystal Based on Huckel Anions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
To achieve optimal properties in organic ionic plastic crystals (OIPCs) and ionic liquids (ILs), new cations and anions must be investigated. A novel series of ILs and OIPC based on Huckel&#8208;type anions were synthesised and characterised.







Abstract
There is increasing interest in ionic liquid electrolytes for battery applications due to their potential as safer alternatives to conventional liquid electrolytes. By carefully selecting cations and anions, the physicochemical properties of these salts can be optimised. However, investigation of new cations and anions is still required to achieve the desired electrolyte properties such as high conductivity, electrochemical stability and low corrosivity. Thus, here a new series of room temperature ionic liquids (RTILs) and an organic ionic plastic crystal (OIPC) were synthesized and characterized based on N&#8722;ethyl&#8722;N&#8722;methylpyrrolidinium ([C2mpyr]+) and N&#8722;ethyl&#8722;N&#8722;methyloxazolidinium ([C2moxa]+) cations, paired with 4,5&#8208;dicyano&#8208;2&#8208;(trifluoromethyl)imidazolide ([TDI]&#8722;) and 4,5&#8208;dicyano&#8208;2&#8208;(pentafluoroethyl)imidazolide ([PDI]&#8722;) anions, forming [C2mpyr][TDI] (OIPC), [C2mpyr][PDI] (IL), [C2moxa][TDI] (IL), and [C2moxa][PDI] (IL). Thermal properties were analysed using DSC and TGA. The plastic phase of the OIPC [C2mpyr][TDI] is wide and spans most electrolyte application temperatures, extending from &#8722;40&#8197;to&#8197;56&#8201;&#176;C. All salts exhibit thermal stability above 200&#8201;&#176;C. The temperature dependence of the transport properties (viscosity, ionic conductivity, self&#8208;diffusion coefficient) were measured and fitted by the Vogel&#8208;Fulcher&#8208;Tamman (VFT) equation, and the ionicity of the ILs is reported. The electrochemical stability windows of the salts were analysed by CV, and the [C2mpyr]+ cation&#8208;based ILs showed the widest window of ~5&#8201;V.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is increasing interest in ionic liquid electrolytes for battery applications due to their potential as safer alternatives to conventional liquid electrolytes. By carefully selecting cations and anions, the physicochemical properties of these salts can be optimised. However, investigation of new cations and anions is still required to achieve the desired electrolyte properties such as high conductivity, electrochemical stability and low corrosivity. Thus, here a new series of room temperature ionic liquids (RTILs) and an organic ionic plastic crystal (OIPC) were synthesized and characterized based on &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;&#8722;ethyl&#8722;&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;&#8722;methylpyrrolidinium ([C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;mpyr]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) and &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;&#8722;ethyl&#8722;&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;&#8722;methyloxazolidinium ([C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;moxa]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) cations, paired with 4,5-dicyano-2-(trifluoromethyl)imidazolide ([TDI]&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;) and 4,5-dicyano-2-(pentafluoroethyl)imidazolide ([PDI]&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;) anions, forming [C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;mpyr][TDI] (OIPC), [C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;mpyr][PDI] (IL), [C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;moxa][TDI] (IL), and [C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;moxa][PDI] (IL). Thermal properties were analysed using DSC and TGA. The plastic phase of the OIPC [C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;mpyr][TDI] is wide and spans most electrolyte application temperatures, extending from &#8722;40&#8197;to&#8197;56&#8201;&#176;C. All salts exhibit thermal stability above 200&#8201;&#176;C. The temperature dependence of the transport properties (viscosity, ionic conductivity, self-diffusion coefficient) were measured and fitted by the Vogel-Fulcher-Tamman (VFT) equation, and the ionicity of the ILs is reported. The electrochemical stability windows of the salts were analysed by CV, and the [C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;mpyr]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cation-based ILs showed the widest window of ~5&#8201;V.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Cucurbit[8]Uril&#8208;Stabilized Charge Transfer: An Efficient Supramolecular Approach Toward a Heterogeneous Organic Photocatalyst for Aerobic Oxidation Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The host&#8211;guest complexes of cucurbit[8]uril (Q[8]) with viologen derivatives in aqueous solution could be switched by the substituted electron donor moieties, where the host&#8208;guest complexes exhibited effective HSCT interactions. Control experiments revealed that d&#8208;BPV2+@Q[8] complex as heterogeneous catalysts has the stronger ability to sensitize singlet oxygen (1O2) in organic solvents.







Abstract
Host&#8208;stabilized charge transfer (HSCT) has been widely utilized in macrocycle&#8208;derived supramolecular assemblies and architectures. However, there has been less research attention focused on the direct fabrication of pure organic photocatalysts using HSCT. Herein, four viologen derivatives (m&#8208;PV2+, m&#8208;BPV2+, d&#8208;PV2+, and d&#8208;BPV2+) with different electron donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8722;A) structures were synthesized. Their host&#8208;guest complexes with cucurbit[8]uril (Q[8]) in an aqueous solution could be switched using the substituted electron donor moieties, in which the host&#8208;guest complexes of m&#8208;BPV2+@Q[8] and d&#8208;BPV2+@Q[8] exhibited HSCT interactions. Control experiments revealed that the d&#8208;BPV2+@Q[8] complex had the strongest ability to sensitize singlet oxygen (1O2). This was ascribed to the increased &#960;&#8208;conjugation of d&#8208;BPV2+@Q[8], which led to more effective HSCT upon encapsulation by the Q[8] host. Consequently, the d&#8208;BPV2+@Q[8] complex could be easily employed as a heterogeneous photocatalyst for the photooxidation reaction of thioether com&#8208;pounds with high selectivity. In particular, d&#8208;BPV2+@Q[8] was successfully applied to the synthesis of sulfoxide drugs, such as the con&#8208;version of inexpensive Iberverin ($7.0 per gram) to the expensive bioactive inhibitor Iberin ($19500.0 per gram) in high yield (94&#8201;%).

         <title>Nitrocyclopropanes as Valuable Building Blocks in Organic Synthesis and Biology: Exploring the Origin of the Nitro Group</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review summarizes the synthetic methodologies of the nitro&#8208;substituted Donor&#8208;Acceptor cyclopropanes (NCPs). Particularly from nitroalkenes including the Michael Initiated Ring Closure and the Oxidative Ring Closure of Michael Adducts, from Diazo Compounds bearing Nitro Group, from Nitromethane and its Derivatives; and after Oxidation of Aminocyclopropanes or after Cyclopropanation of Miscellaneous Nitro Compounds. The applications described include their Reduction to Aminocyclopropane Carboxylic Acids or Esters, Ring Opening, and Ring Expansion.







Abstract
Cyclopropane derivatives serve as important building blocks in organic synthesis, due to their three&#8208;membered stretched ring. Nitro&#8208;substituted cyclopropanes (NCPs) represent a special class of donor&#8208;acceptor cyclopropanes (DACs) that contain a strong electron&#8208;withdrawing nitro group as substituent on the cyclopropyl moiety. Due to the versatile nature of the nitro group, which can be converted into other functional azo groups or heterocyclic scaffolds, NCPs are considered important building blocks in the design of complex organic compounds. Herein, the present review is organized in two main sections focused on the synthesis and application of NCPs. The part containing the synthetic methodologies of NCPs has been further divided into distinct sections based mainly on the nature of the starting materials, such as: a) from nitroalkenes, b) from nitro&#8208;bearing diazo compounds, c) from nitroalkanes in combination with alkenes, d) from aminocyclopropanes under oxidative conditions, and e) from various nitro compounds, through miscellaneous processes. In the part concerning the applications and use of NCPs, the categorization includes three main subcategories, concerning their reduction to 1&#8208;aminocyclopropane&#8208;1&#8208;carboxylic acids (ACC), the ring opening of NCPs leading to valuable open&#8208;chain heterocycles, and the ring expansion to larger cyclic and heterocyclic compounds.

         <title>Direct Recycling of Cathode Materials from Spent Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries: Principles, Strategies, and Perspectives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This paper reviews the direct recycling methods for cathode materials derived from spent lithium&#8208;ion batteries. The focus includes the pretreatment processes involved in direct recycling, the degradation mechanisms of various cathode materials, and their corresponding regeneration strategies. Additionally, the future developments and prospects of cathode recycling for lithium&#8208;ion batteries are also discussed.







Abstract
In recent years, lithium&#8208;ion batteries have become an important part of the global transition to green and low&#8208;carbon energy. However, due to the rapidly increasing demand and production of lithium&#8208;ion batteries, there is a large amount of spent batteries that need to be disposed of. The most critical and valuable recycling of spent batteries is the recycling of cathode materials. Pyrometallurgy and hydrometallurgy are traditional recycling processes aimed at extracting valuable metal elements from cathode materials. However, these methods have several disadvantages, including destruction of the structure of cathode materials, lengthy repair processes, high energy consumption and high environmental pollution. The direct recycling process is a popular repair technology for cathode materials in lithium&#8208;ion batteries. The aim is to restore or upgrade the cathode materials in a non&#8208;destructive manner or convert them into other functional products for secondary use, characterized by a short repair process, high atom utilization, lower costs and lower carbon emissions. This perspective summarizes the current status of lithium&#8208;ion battery recycling, with a focus on direct recycling of cathode materials. It describes the pretreatment process, theoretical foundations, direct regeneration strategies and perspectives and provides insights for relevant researchers.

         <title>Fluorescence of Aqueous Assemblies Regulated by Integral Water</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The aqueous assemblies of POSS&#8208;NDI&#8208;POSS contain interstitial water that separate NDI chromophores due to the steric hinderance of bulky POSS groups. This integral water is repelled for the assemblies of the analogues with flexible alkyl groups. The assemblies without integral water emit excimer fluorescence, while the integral water quenches the fluorescence POSS&#8208;NDI&#8208;POSS assemblies via non&#8208;radiative transition.







Abstract
Water is an integral and functional component for aqueous assemblies of POSS&#8208;NDI&#8208;POSS molecules. Water serves not only as a solvent but also as an integral component (interstitial water) in aqueous colloids self&#8208;assembled from POSS&#8208;NDI&#8208;POSS (POSS = polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxanes, NDI = naphthalene diimide). The interstitial water confined within these colloids is attributed to the steric hindrance of the bulky POSS groups, which dissipates energy and quenches the fluorescence (FL). Control experiments with NDI molecules bearing less steric side groups (propyl or octyl), namely C3&#8722;NDI&#8208;C3 and C8&#8722;NDI&#8208;C8, confirm this role of water in structural assembly and optical function. This discovery opens new possibilities for the innovation of aqueous materials.

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembly of Antisense DNA&#8208;Camptothecin Amphiphile into Glutathione&#8208;Responsive Nanoparticles for Combination Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synthesis of an amphiphile consist of hydrophobic camptothecin conjugated to an antisense DNA via GSH&#8208;responsive disulphide linker and its self&#8208;assembly into GSH&#8208;responsive NPs are reported. Simultaneous delivery of hydrophobic camptothecin and cell impermeable antisense DNA into the cancer cell in a GSH&#8208;responsive manner is shown. Enhanced cytotoxicity is observed due to the synergetic combination of chemo and antisense DNA therapies.







Abstract
Recent years have witnessed the rapid growth of combination therapy for the treatment of cancer. Chemo and antisense DNA therapies are two clinically proven and efficient treatment modalities for cancer. However, direct delivery of both chemo and antisense oligonucleotides into the cancerous cells is challenging and hence there is a high demand for the development of new strategies that permit the direct delivery of chemo and antisense therapeutic agents in a targeted fashion. Herein, we show a supramolecular approach for the direct delivery of hydrophobic chemo drug and cell impermeable antisense oligonucleotide into a cancer cell in a targeted fashion. Synthesis of an amphiphile (DNA1&#8208;CPT) consist of hydrophobic camptothecin (CPT) conjugated to an antisense oligonucleotide (DNA1) via glutathione&#8208;responsive disulphide linker is reported. Self&#8208;assembly of DNA1&#8208;CPT results in the formation of GSH&#8208;responsive NPs with CPT as the hydrophobic core and DNA1 as the hydrophilic shell. Self&#8208;assembled NPs exhibits excellent cellular internalization via endocytosis pathway, and the high concentration of glutathione inside the cancer cells causes the cleavage of disulphide bond of the NPs and trigger the simultaneous release of CPT and DNA1a. Enhanced cytotoxicity is observed for the NPs due to the synergetic combination of chemo and antisense DNA therapies.

         <title>Construction of Sub&#8208;Nano Channels of Amino Pillar[6]arene Inspired Biomimetic Porous Roots for Specific Remove of Imazamox</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, we successfully constructed PES membrane channels by layer&#8208;upon&#8208;layer covalent assembly of amino pillar[6]arene. Moreover, the specific recognition of imazamox by amino pillar[6]arene made the membrane capable of specific extraction and removal of mazamox.







Abstract
The root ducts play an important role in the plant's transport of nutrients from the soil. Based on the selective transport characteristics of plant roots, amino pillar[6]arene bionic porous root sub&#8208;nano channel membrane were constructed to remove Imazamox. Imazamox (IM) is an effective imidazolinone herbicide frequently utilized in soybean fields to control a wide range of annual grasses and broad&#8208;leaved weeds. However, it is important to note that while IM is effective in controlling the growth of weeds, its residues can affect the plants that are later planted. Developing a material that can efficiently and selectively remove IM from the environment poses a significant challenge in the realm of agricultural residue removal. A layer&#8208;upon&#8208;layer covalent assembly was formed through the reaction of amino pillar[6]arene with terephthalaldehyde using an aldehyde&#8208;amine Schiff&#8208;base reaction. The cavity of amino pillar[6]arenal is used to realize the host&#8208;guest interaction of IM. This enabled the development of a membrane with high selectivity for the extraction and removal of IM. The removal rate is 4.66&#8211;21.91 times higher than that of other pesticide chemicals. The successful development of the highly selective porous root bionic membrane provides a broad prospect for its application and development in agricultural production.

         <title>Substitution and Electron Transfer in Diborane&#8208;Quinone Systems</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The dual reactivity of cationic triflato&#8208;diboranes as Lewis acids and electron donors allows quinone coordination and reduction, accompanied by oxidative B&#8722;B bond cleavage, in the diborane coordination sphere. A detailed evaluation of substitution reactions in the catecholato&#8208;diborane products discloses the importance of a catecholato coordination mode change.







Abstract
The dual reactivity of boron compounds as Lewis acids and electron donors has spurred the development of a metallomimetic chemistry of boron compounds as a topical research theme. In this work we elaborate on the reaction of specially&#8208;designed diborane(4) compounds with quinones, as a prime example showing their dual (metallomimetic) chemistry as a Lewis acid and electron donor. The quinone is first coordinated to the diborane and then reduced by intramolecular electron transfer from the B&#8722;B bond to a quinone &#960;* orbital. A variety of substitution reactions of the catecholate&#8208;diborane reaction product was carried out, leading to new catecholato&#8208;diborane compounds and thereby shedding light on the likely mechanisms. Notably, the results disclose the importance of a facile coordination&#8208;mode change of the catecholato ligand (end&#8208;on to bridging) for substitution reactions and for the diborane&#8208;quinone reactions. The results contribute to the further advancement in the use of diboranes with dual reactivity for substrate binding and reduction.

         <title>Amino&#8208;Substituted Azoxybenzenes as Potential Redox&#8208;Active Catholyte Materials</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Azoxybenzenes (AOB) exhibit unique redox behavior with potential for energy storage systems. In this article, we investigate their electrochemical properties and demonstrate a promising reversible oxidation. However, capacity decay during cycling due to unstable intermediates poses a challenge, necessitating the exploration of stabilization strategies to exploit the full potential of AOBs in energy storage applications.







Abstract
Aryl diazenes, particularly azobenzenes (AB), represent a versatile class of compounds with significant historical and practical relevance, ranging from dyes to molecular machines, solar thermal and electrochemical storage. Their oxygen&#8208;substituted counterparts, azoxybenzenes (AOB), share structural similarities but have been less explored, especially in energy storage applications. This study investigates the redox properties of AOB, comparing them to AB, and evaluates their potential as redox&#8208;active materials for energy storage systems. Through cyclic voltammetry (CV) and spectro&#8208;electrochemical analyses, we demonstrate that AOBs exhibit a distinct redox behaviour, influenced by the solvent and electrolyte environment, with a reversible oxidation process. Despite their promising redox characteristics, AOBs suffer from capacity decay during galvanostatic cycling, likely due to the instability of the radical cation intermediate. These findings suggest that while AOBs offer intriguing redox properties, further investigation into stabilization strategies are needed for their application in energy storage.

         <title>Mechanistic Insights into the Apoptosis of Cancer Cells Induced by a Kinase&#8208;Responsive Peptide Amphiphile</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a peptide amphiphile, C16&#8208;(EY)3, that responds to tyrosine kinase activity and induces selective apoptosis in cancer cells overexpressing tyrosine kinase. The peptide self&#8208;assembled on the ER, reducing fluidity and triggering ER stress. This led to the activation of caspase&#8208;4, &#8722;12, and &#8722;9 ultimately activating caspase&#8208;3 and &#8722;7 for apoptosis. In vivo studies confirmed the antitumor efficacy, highlighting its potential as an organelle&#8208;targeting cancer therapy.







Abstract
Organelle targeting is a useful approach in drug development for cancer therapy. Peptide amphiphiles are good candidates for targeting specific organelles because they can be engineered into a wide range of molecular structures, enabling customization for specific functional needs. We have developed a peptide amphiphile, C16&#8208;(EY)3, that can respond to tyrosine kinase activity and undergo phosphorylation inside cancer cells. C16&#8208;(EY)3 selectively induced apoptosis in cancer cells that overexpressed tyrosine kinase. The self&#8208;assembly of peptide amphiphiles on the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane reduced the ER membrane fluidity and triggered ER stress. The mechanism of the cancer cell death induced by C16&#8208;(EY)3 was shown to involve phosphorylation by tyrosine kinase, ER stress induction, and the subsequent activation of caspase&#8208;4, &#8722;12, and &#8722;9, which ultimately triggered apoptosis through the activation of caspase&#8208;3 and &#8722;7. In vivo studies further validated the antitumor efficacy of C16&#8208;(EY)3, as transcutaneous administration of the peptide amphiphile inhibited tumor growth in mice. This study elucidated the mechanism of apoptosis induced by the peptide amphiphile, indicating the potential of peptide amphiphiles as organelle&#8208;targeting cancer therapeutics and providing a novel strategy for the development of selective and potent anticancer drugs.

&lt;p&gt;We developed a peptide amphiphile, C16-(EY)3, that responds to tyrosine kinase activity and induces selective apoptosis in cancer cells overexpressing tyrosine kinase. The peptide self-assembled on the ER, reducing fluidity and triggering ER stress. This led to the activation of caspase-4, &#8722;12, and &#8722;9 ultimately activating caspase-3 and &#8722;7 for apoptosis.

         <title>Electrocatalytic Reduction of CO2 to Long&#8208;Chain Hydrocarbons: Investigating the Asymmetric C&#8722;C Coupling Mechanism on Pd3Au Catalysts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We investigate the asymmetric C&#8208;C coupling mechanism on Pd3Au catalysts for electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 to long&#8208;chain hydrocarbons. Using DFT calculations, we identify key intermediates and reaction pathways for C2&#8208;C4 product formation. Our findings highlight the role of asymmetric C&#8208;C coupling in selective synthesis of higher hydrocarbons, providing insights for optimizing catalyst design.







Abstract
The electrochemical reduction of CO2 to high&#8208;energy&#8208;density hydrocarbons is pivotal for addressing energy and environmental challenges. Understanding the mechanisms underlying the conversion of CO2 to long&#8208;chain hydrocarbons is both crucial and complex. In this study, we employed density functional theory (DFT) calculations to investigate the C&#8722;C coupling mechanisms responsible for the formation of C2&#8208;C4 products on Pd3Au catalysts. Our findings highlight the sequential formation of C2&#8722;C1 bonds via asymmetric C&#8722;C coupling as a critical pathway for generating C3 product, which is essential for controlling product selectivity. Detailed analysis of coupling reactions involving CCH2* and CCH3* intermediates with various C1 species indicates that these asymmetric coupling events are energetically favorable and play a decisive role in the selective assembly of carbon atoms into longer hydrocarbon chains. Moreover, we propose a mechanism wherein the asymmetric coupling of C1&#8208;C3 intermediate leads to a diverse array of C4 products. This process underscores the importance of CH2 group coupling with C3 intermediates in forming long&#8208;chain hydrocarbons. Our work provides valuable insights into optimizing catalyst design for improved selectivity towards higher hydrocarbons in CO2 reduction processes.

         <title>Unusual Caesium Monensinate A: Crystallographic Evidence for the Formation of Dinuclear Coordination Species in the Solid State</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Caesium monensinate crystalizes as a dinuclear complex with metal centres entrapped into the hydrophilic cavity of the ligands which also act as bridges. The structure dissociates to the corresponding mononuclear species in methanol. Solution spectroscopic studies combined with molecular dynamics modelling disclose the effect of the solvent polarity on the macrocyclization of the antibiotic and its ability to capture alkali cations in a &#8220;closed&#8221; structure.







Abstract
The polyether ionophore monensin A (MonH), applied as silver monensinate, reacts with caesium cations to form a dinuclear complex [Mon2Cs2] the structure of which has been solved by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. Two Cs+ ions are located in the hydrophilic cage of two ligand anions, achieving coordination number eight. In addition, the metal cations are bridged by two functional groups of monensinate A, completing the inner tenfold coordination sphere. NMR studies show that the dinuclear complex dissociates to its mononuclear counterparts in methanol solutions. Further molecular dynamics theoretical modelling of the interaction of monensinate A with alkali metal ions reveals the effect of solvent polarity on the zipping ability of the ligand. Thus, in methanol, used as an explicit solvent, potassium and rubidium cations fully occupy the cavity of the ligand, whereas the sodium monensinate exists in an &#8220;open&#8221; form, with Na+ ions still interacting with the monodentate carboxylate group. The replacement of methanol by the less polar chloroform induces the folding of monensinate A and the formation of &#8220;closed&#8221; structures with all group 1 metal cations. The obtained data explain the specifics in the behaviour of monensinate A caused by the environment, e.&#8201;g., physical state or solvent.

         <title>Enhanced Homogeneous Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution in a Binuclear Bio&#8208;Inspired Ni&#8208;Ni Complex Bearing Phenanthroline and Sulfidophenolate Ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A binuclear Ni(II) complex that significantly enhances light&#8208;driven hydrogen evolution compared to its mononuclear counterparts has been synthesized and fully characterized, achieving up to 9000&#8197;TON with quantum dots as photosensitizers. Studies confirm that the complex maintains its molecular integrity during catalysis, and electrocatalytic analysis suggests that the proximity of two nickel ions facilitates increased catalytic activity







Abstract
The prominence of binuclear, bimetallic catalysts underlines the need for the design and development of diverse bifunctional ligand frameworks that exhibit tunable electronic and structural properties. Such strategies enable metal&#8208;metal and ligand&#8208;metal cooperation towards catalytic applications, improve catalytic activity, and are essential for advancing multi&#8208;electron transfers for catalytic application. In this work we present the synthesis, crystal structure, and photocatalytic properties of a binuclear Ni(II) complex, [Ni2(1,10&#8208;phenanthroline)2(2&#8208;sulfidophenolate)2] (1). Complex 1 crystallizes in the centrosymmetric triclinic system (P&#8208;1) showing extensive intra&#8208; and inter&#8208; non&#8208;coordinated interactions. 1 is employed as a catalyst for light driven hydrogen evolution. Its catalytic efficiency in a noble&#8208;metal&#8208;free photo&#8208;driven system using fluorescein as photosensitizer and triethanolamine as the electron donor, reaches TON 2900, threefold the efficiency of the corresponding homoleptic mononuclear complex [Ni(2&#8208;sulfidophenolate)2]. Efficiency rises up to 9000&#8197;TONs when thioglycolic&#8208;coated CdTe quantum dots are used as photosensitizers in the presence of ascorbic acid at pH&#8197;4.5. UV&#8208;Vis spectroscopy, dynamic light scattering techniques, and Hg&#8208;poisoning measurements reveal that 1 maintains its molecular structure during catalysis. Electrochemical studies in DMF with TFA as the proton source were also performed for the elucidation of the mechanism of its catalytic action and its stability, suggesting that the proximity of two nickel ions plays a part in the increased catalytic activity, facilitating hydrogen evolution.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A pyridyl&#8208;tethered aziridine and a 2&#8208;pyrrolidone are shown as two unorthodox phosphine&#8208; and carbene&#8208;free ancillary ligands, whose cationic Rh(I) complexes prove highly effective in hydrosilylating and hydrogenating C=C and C&#8801;C bonds catalytically. The [(pyrrolidone&#8208;Rh]+ is remarkably active even at 10&#8197;ppm concentration.

Phosphine&#8208; or carbene&#8208;based soft ligands are customarily used in Rh and other late transition metal catalyzed alkene and alkyne hydrosilylation and hydrogenation. We report here an aziridine and a 2&#8208;pyrrolidone with pyridyl sidearms, whose cationic Rh(I) complexes prove as excellent catalysts for hydrosilylating terminal olefins by Et3SiH giving anti&#8208;Markovnikov products selectively. To the best of our knowledge, the [(2&#8208;pyrrolidone)&#8208;Rh]+ seems to be the most active Rh catalyst recording a highest TOF of 24000&#8197;h&#8208;1. It works remarkably (TOF: 714&#8197;h&#8208;1) even at 10&#8197;ppm concentration! Terminal alkynes are hydrosilylated too to give &#946;&#8208;(Z)&#8208;vinylsilanes selectively. Both catalysts also hydrogenate alkenes and doubly&#8208;hydrogenate alkynes, both terminal and internal, under ambient and benchtop conditions. But in hydrogenation, the [(aziridine)&#8208;Rh]+ catalyst works better. Both ligands and the Rh catalysts are air&#8208;stable.

         <title>Near&#8208;Neutral pH Sensing by Azoheteroarene Dyes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Discovered a novel series of azoheteroarene dyes with thiazole, thiadiazole, triazole, pyrazole, or benzothiazole heteroaryls that detect pH changes in near&#8208;neutral aqueous solutions. They exhibit unique light absorption and notable color changes within a narrow pH range, visible to the naked eye.







Abstract
We serendipitously discovered a novel series of azoheteroarene dyes capable of detecting pH variations in near&#8208;neutral solutions. These dyes feature thiazole, thiadiazole, triazole, pyrazole, or benzothiazole heteroaryls linked to hydroxyphenyl azo groups. They exhibit distinctive light absorption properties in aqueous solutions and show notable color changes in a narrow pH range, visible to the naked eye. Both experimental data and quantum calculations suggest a plausible mechanism for their function as pH indicators. Additionally, these azoheteroarene dyes effectively monitor pH in complex environments, and we show their use for detecting the pH change of culture medium containing growing cancer cells.

         <title>Exploring Lead&#8208;Free (Guanidinium)3Bi2Br9 Perovskite&#8208;Type Crystal toward X&#8208;Ray Detection with an Ultralow Detection Limit</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>

We have employed a zero&#8208;dimensional bismuth halogen perovskite to fabricate X&#8208;ray detector, demonstrating notable detection capabilities including high sensitivity and low detection limit.







Abstract
Lead&#8208;free bismuth halogen perovskites have emerged as a promising candidate for high&#8208;performance X&#8208;ray detection, owing to their unique properties of bulk resistivity, significant X&#8208;ray absorption capabilities and diminished ion migration. Herein, using the facile low&#8208;temperature solution method, we obtained a large&#8208;size single crystal of (guanidinium)3Bi2Br9 (GBB), which adopts a zero&#8208;dimensional (0D) inorganic perovskite&#8208;like framework. The as&#8208;grown crystals show high resistivity (3.51&#215;1012&#8197;&#937;&#8201;cm), low trap density (1.14&#215;1010&#8197;cm&#8722;3) and large carrier mobility&#8208;lifetime product (&#956;&#964;=1.13&#215;10&#8722;3&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1) under X&#8208;ray irradiation. Strikingly, the X&#8208;ray detectors fabricated on GBB single crystals exhibit notable performances including low dark current drift, high sensitivity of ~1645.7&#8197;&#956;C&#8201;Gyair&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;2, and ultralow detection limit of ~0.85&#8197;nGyair&#8201;s&#8722;1. This detection limit is among the lowest level for the reported 0D perovskite X&#8208;ray detectors. This study illuminates the prospective research into novel lead&#8208;free hybrid perovskites for the advancement of high&#8208;performance detectors of irradiation.

         <title>Protonation of Nitrogen&#8208;Containing Covalent Organic Frameworks for Enhanced Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Protonation, as a straightforward post&#8208;synthetic modification strategy, enables precise tuning of covalent organic framework (COF) properties to improve their catalytic performance. This concept article highlights the advantages of protonation in enhancing COF properties, such as mass transfer kinetics, charge distribution, photo&#8208;response, and charge transfer, and discusses its effect on boosting photocatalytic and electrocatalytic activities.







Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are a class of porous crystalline materials with ordered structures and tunable properties, which have been widely explored in catalysis, sensing, gas storage, and separation. Among various post&#8208;synthetic modifications, protonation emerges as a simple yet effective strategy to fine&#8208;tune the properties of nitrogen&#8208;containing COFs, thereby enhancing their catalytic performance. This concept article highlights the contribution of protonation on the mass transfer kinetics, charge distribution, photo&#8208;response, charge transfer, and other properties related to photocatalysis and electrocatalysis. The applications of protonated COFs are explored in catalytic processes including hydrogen evolution, CO2 reduction, H2O2 synthesis, and singlet oxygen generation. We also emphasize the necessity of considering the protonation process when nitrogen&#8208;containing COFs are applied in acidic environments to accurately reveal the structure&#8208;activity relationship. By analyzing recent advancements in protonated COFs, this article underscores the potential and challenges of protonation as a powerful tool for advancing COF&#8208;based catalytic systems.

         <title>N&#8208;Hydroxyphthalimide/TiO2 Catalyzed Addition of Ethers, Alkylarenes and Aldehydes to Azodicarboxylates under Visible Light</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
N&#8208;hydroxyphthalimide/TiO2 photocatalytic system enabled the addition of ethers, alkylarenes and aldehydes to azodicarboxylates under visible light. The increased efficiency of photocatalysis is attributed to a homogeneous organocatalytic process involving phthalimide&#8208;N&#8208;oxyl radicals in solution. The developed conditions are suitable for complex natural compounds and hold potential for late&#8208;stage functionalization.







Abstract
The addition of carbon&#8208;centered radicals to double bonds is one of the most atom&#8208;efficient approaches to the formation of new C&#8722;C or C&#8722;heteroatom bonds. Existing approaches for the generation of carbon&#8208;centered radicals often require elevated temperatures, UV radiation or expensive transition metal catalysts. In this work, a photocatalytic system based on a heterogeneous TiO2 catalyst and a redox organocatalyst N&#8208;hydroxyphthalimide is proposed for the generation of carbon&#8208;centered radicals from C(sp3)&#8722;H substrates or aldehydes at room temperature under visible light irradiation. The developed approach was successfully applied to the addition of ethers, alkylarenes and aldehydes to azodicarboxylates. Titanium oxide acts as a photocatalyst, producing phthalimide&#8208;N&#8208;oxyl radicals from N&#8208;hydroxyphthalimide, thereby enabling the organocatalytic process in solution. Phthalimide&#8208;N&#8208;oxyl radicals act as catalytically active species that cleave C&#8722;H bonds to form carbon&#8208;centered radicals.

         <title>Methylaluminoxane Reactivities and Anionic Structures: From Small Oligomers to Large Sheets</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Theoretical study of small methylaluminoxane sheets (MeAlO)n(Me3Al)m indicates that DFT electronically stabilizes those featuring 5&#8208;coordinate Al and 4&#8208;coordinate O compared with higher level MP2 and CCSD(T) calculations which favor 4&#8208;coordinate Al. The anions formed from these precursors all feature 4&#8208;coordinate Al and their relative stabilities explain the appearance of ESI&#8208;MS spectra recorded during the hydrolysis of Me3Al.







Abstract
The structure and reactivity of small methylaluminoxane (MAO) species (MeAlO)n(Me3Al)m (n=1&#8208;8) have been investigated using DFT (M06&#8208;2X), MP2, and CCSD(T) calculations. This hierarchy of methods reveals that DFT artificially stabilizes structures containing 4&#8208;coordinate oxygen atoms while higher&#8208;level calculations demonstrate a clear preference for structures with 3&#8208;coordinate oxygen and 4&#8208;coordinate aluminum centers. Analysis of ionization pathways shows these neutral MAO molecules form anions through either methide or Me2Al+ abstraction, with the latter mechanism dominant for sheet structures (n=5&#8208;8). Smaller species (n=1&#8208;4, m &#8805; n) show minimal reactivity toward either ionization pathway. The resulting anions consistently adopt sheet structures with 3&#8208;coordinate oxygen and 4&#8208;coordinate aluminum at all levels of theory. We introduce a comprehensive stability metric incorporating both ionization energies and neutral precursor stability, which successfully explains the distribution of anions observed in ESI&#8208;MS spectra during Me3Al hydrolysis. Extension of this analysis to larger species, including the recently isolated and characterized sheet (MeAlO)26(Me3Al)9 (Luo et&#8197;al., Science, 2024, 384, 1424&#8208;1428), reveals unexpected trends in reactivity.

         <dc:description>
A quinazoline&#8208;2,4(1H,3H)&#8208;dione bearing a phenylene moiety and aliphatic tails was synthesized as a self&#8208;assembling building block. The compound self&#8208;assembles to form linear supramolecular polymers via the formation of hydrogen&#8208;bonded cyclic hexamers (rosettes). The results demonstrate that the quinazolinedione serves as an effective building block to prepare supramolecular polymers.







Abstract
A quinazoline&#8208;2,4(1H,3H)&#8208;dione bearing a phenylene moiety and aliphatic tails was synthesized as an alternative self&#8208;assembling building block to barbiturate molecules, aiming to achieve enhanced hydrolysis resistance. The compound self&#8208;assembles in non&#8208;polar solvents to form linear supramolecular polymers via the formation of hydrogen&#8208;bonded cyclic hexamers (rosettes), a process confirmed by powder X&#8208;ray diffraction (PXRD) analysis of the bulk material. Our results demonstrate that quinazoline&#8208;2,4(1H,3H)&#8208;dione serves as an effective hydrogen&#8208;bonding building block, suggesting its potential to form stable supramolecular polymers from versatile &#960;&#8208;conjugated molecules.

         <title>Alternative and Sustainable Route to Explore a New Class of Amidines by Photochemical Synergistic Effect of Copper/Nitroxyl Radical Catalysis via Halogen&#8208;Atom Transfer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photochemical alternative and sustainable approach for synthesis of new class of amidines!! &#160;Synergistic Cu/nitroxyl radical catalysis is highly desirable to access nitrogen rich new class of amidines via XAT. This methodology covers 11 green chemistry metrics (GCM) out of 12 principles with high regioselectivity. Mechanistic studies reveal the role of light, in&#8197;situ formation of oxoammonium cation (TEMPO+) via XAT, substituent effect and order of the reaction.







Abstract
Amidines are a vital class of bioactive compounds and often necessitate multiple components for their synthesis. Therefore, exploring efficient and sustainable methodologies for their synthesis is indispensable. Herein, we disclose an alternative and greener method for synthesizing an unexplored new class of amidines through the photochemical synergistic effect of copper/nitroxyl radical catalysis. This approach facilitates site&#8208;selective radical amination of unactivated imine C(sp2)&#8722;H bond in C,N,N&#8208;cyclic imines over favored selectivity via halogen&#8208;atom transfer (XAT). This greener method ticks 11 out of 12 green chemistry metrics (GCM), effectively sidestepping the need for oxidants, bases, ligands, multistep processes, and harsh conditions, distinguishing it from conventional methods described in previous studies. Kinetic, spectroscopic, and computational tools have been employed to elucidate the synergistic effect of Cu/nitroxyl radical, the role of light, XAT, the influence of substituents, and the order of the reaction in the catalytic cycle.

         <title>Preoxidation Assisted Alkali Activation Constructs Polyacrylonitrile&#8208;based Porous Carbon for Supercapacitors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The porous structural tailoring of polyacrylonitrile&#8208;based carbon materials is the key to maximize capacitive performance. Herein, hierarchical porous carbons (HPC) with high specific surface area and controllable porosity are synthesized by preoxidation assisted alkali activation strategy using polyacrylonitrile as the precursor. The results show that high preoxidation temperature is beneficial to increase the specific surface area and pore volume of HPC. The optimized HPC&#8208;300 has a high BET specific surface area of 3161 m2 g&#8208;1, a micropore volume of 1.45 cm3 g&#8208;1, and an AD/AG of 3.56. Electrochemical test shows that the specific capacitances of HPC&#8208;300 in 6 M KOH electrolyte at 1 A g&#8208;1 and 10 A g&#8208;1 are 314.1F g&#8208;1 and 213.0 F g&#8208;1, respectively, with a capacitance retention of 67.8%. The assembled supercapacitors based on HPC&#8208;300 deliver an energy density of 11.7 Wh kg&#8208;1 at a power density of 250.0 W kg&#8208;1 in KOH electrolyte and 21.1 Wh kg&#8208;1 at 450.0 W kg&#8208;1 in Na2SO4 electrolyte and possess a capacitance retention of 98.1% over 20,000 charge&#8208;discharge cycles. This preoxidation coupled activation method provides a potential strategy for the preparation of PAN&#8208;based porous carbon with high specific surface area and capacitance.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A series of 3DOM La0.5&#8208;xKxSr0.5CoO3&#8208;&#948; catalysts were synthesized using colloidal crystal templating and citric acid complexation methods. The substitution of K ions for A&#8208;site La ions was found to markedly enhance the catalysts' intrinsic activity, with the La0.4K0.1Sr0.5CoO3&#8208;&#948; catalyst showing exceptional performance comparable to commercial precious metal catalysts. The La0.4K0.1Sr0.5CoO3&#8208;&#948; catalyst demonstrated the highest catalytic activity, with T10, T50, and T90 values of 280&#176;C, 335&#176;C, and 387&#176;C, respectively. The enhancement in intrinsic activity is primarily attributed to the electron&#8208;donating effect of K ions which maintains charge conservation and consequently increases the concentration of surface oxygen vacancies, leading to the formation of abundant active oxygen species. Additionally, the catalysts exhibited a highly ordered macroporous structure with interconnected pores, facilitating the diffusion of soot particles and enhancing contact efficiency with active sites. These findings not only advance the understanding of the structure&#8208;performance relationship in perovskite catalysts but also pave the way for the development of cost&#8208;effective catalysts for low&#8208;temperature soot abatement.</dc:description>

         <title>Unveiling Quantum Coherence Effects in Modulating Electron Transfer in Platinum Donor&#8208;Acceptor&#8208;Donor Systems</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Quantum coherence effects (QCEs), arising from the interference of wave&#8208;like amplitudes, are crucial in controlling the electron transfer function of molecular systems. Here, we report a coherence phenomenon associated with charge separation (CS) in a range of Pt (II)&#160;cis&#8208;acetylide&#160;donor&#8208;acceptor&#8208;donor (D&#8208;A&#8208;D) systems, where the photogenerated Pt (III) center acts as an acceptor connecting two (R)phenothiazine (R = H or tBu) donors. Femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy revealed that CS rates in D&#8208;A&#8208;D systems with double CS paths were accelerated by 4&#8208;8 times compared to their donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;A) counterparts with a single path. An enhancement factor of 2&#8208;3 in electronic coupling, within the context of interference between CS paths, is derived, providing a clear signature of QCEs. This enchantment in CS processes closely correlates with the strength of coupling between donors. This study highlights the significant impact of QCEs on the photophysical properties of molecular systems and offers insights into charge and energy transport mechanisms in both natural and artificial systems.</dc:description>

Here, we report a coherence phenomenon associated with charge separation (CS) in a range of Pt (II)&#160;cis-acetylide&#160;donor-acceptor-donor (D-A-D) systems, where the photogenerated Pt (III) center acts as an acceptor connecting two (R)phenothiazine (R = H or tBu) donors. Femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy revealed that CS rates in D-A-D systems with double CS paths were accelerated by 4-8 times compared to their donor-acceptor (D-A) counterparts with a single path. An enhancement factor of 2-3 in electronic coupling, within the context of interference between CS paths, is derived, providing a clear signature of QCEs.

         <title>Embedding coupled Pd/Fe sites in electrospun MOF&#8208;derived carbon nanofibers achieves efficient and durable oxygen reduction catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>High costs, poor durability of Pt electrocatalysts, and the low performance of non&#8208;precious metals hinder the large&#8208;scale commercialization of fuel cells. To address these challenges, a bimetallic, highly dispersed catalyst containing&#160; Pd and Fe uniformly distributed on porous nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon nanofibers was developed. This catalyst demonstrated remarkable oxygen reduction catalytic performance. The Pd&#8208;Fe&#8208;N&#8208;C catalyst exhibited catalytic activity 4.6 times higher than that of the JM 20% Pt/C catalyst, despite containing only 0.62 wt% Pd. Moreover, it achieved a half&#8208;wave potential (E1/2&#160;= 0.953 V vs. RHE) that is 40 mV higher than the JM 20% Pt/C catalyst (0.913 V vs. RHE). Significantly, with a total metal content of just 1.19 wt%, the E1/2&#160;of Pd&#8208;Fe&#8208;N&#8208;C catalyst&#160;decreased by only 1 mV after 10,000 cycles, highlighting its exceptional durability. Furthermore, a stability test revealed a current retention rate of 84.87% after 50,000 s of operation, with no evidence of agglomeration. These results suggest that combining electrostatic spinning of MOFs with pyrolysis provides an effective and innovative method for synthesizing electrocatalysts with reduced reliance on precious metals.</dc:description>

         <title>Biocatalytic Stereodivergent Synthesis of Substituted Tetrahydro&#8208;Benzo&#8208;(Oxa, Thia, &amp; Di)&#8208;azepines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Benzo&#8208;fused seven&#8208;membered N,O&#8208;, N,S&#8208; and N,N&#8208;containing heterocyclic moieties are found in several marketed drugs and biologically active molecules. However, the asymmetric synthesis of such heterocycles is limited to the use of transition metal catalysts or chiral phosphoric acids. In the current work, imine reductases (IREDs) are utilized to develop a general biocatalytic method for the stereodivergent synthesis of 5&#8208;substituted tetrahydro&#8208;1,4&#8208;benzoxazepines, 4&#8208;substituted tetrahydro&#8208;1,5&#8208;benzothiazepines, and 2,2,4&#8208;trisubstituted tetrahydro&#8208;1,5&#8208;benzodiazepines in excellent yields (up to 96%), enantiomeric excess (up to &gt;99%) and diastereomeric excess&#160;(up to &gt;99%). In addition, imine reductase assisted reductive amination gave facile access to 2,4&#8208;disubstituted tetrahydro&#8208;1,5&#8208;benzodiazepines starting from 1,3&#8208;diketone and 1,2&#8208;diamino benzene with excellent stereoselectivity and high yields. The absolute configuration of the newly synthesized N&#8208;heterocycles was determined using vibrational circular dichroism (VCD). The presented methodology has further broadened the scope of IREDs towards the preparation of chiral seven&#8208;membered N&#8208;heterocycles containing another heteroatom.</dc:description>

         <title>Spin Crossover Composite Film as Recyclable Catalyst for Acetalization Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polymer&#8208;based composite films represent a promising approach for developing recyclable catalysts. In this study, a [Fe(NH2trz)3](NO3)2 @TPU composite film with spin crossover properties was fabricated using the blade casting method. Various characterisation techniques confirmed the uniform distribution of [Fe(NH2trz)3](NO3)2 particles within the TPU matrix, while maintaining the spin&#8208;crossover properties of the embedded complex. The composite film exhibited excellent catalytic efficiency and reusability in acetalization reaction, enabling efficient catalysis for up to 11 cycles under batch conditions and sustained activity for 7 hours under flow conditions. In addition, the color of the film served as a convenient visual indicator of its suitability for reuse in subsequent catalytic reactions. This study demonstrates that [Fe(NH2trz)3](NO3)2 @TPU composite film can serve as an effective and recyclable catalysts for acetalization reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Aluminum Photosensitizers on Trial: Synthesis, Crystal Structures, Photophysical and Photobiological Properties of Tris(dipyrrinato)aluminum(III) Complexes with Long&#8208;lived Triplet States</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal coordination compounds are currently a focus of research in developing new photosensitizers for materials and medicinal applications. As an abundant element in the earth&#8217;s crust aluminum is a suitable target element. However, only limited studies are available on its use in photoactive systems. We now report the facile preparation of a library of homoleptic tris(dipyrrinato)aluminum(III) [AL(DIPY)3] complexes. The majority of complexes was characterized by single crystal X&#8208;ray analysis and their photophysical properties upon photoexcitation and their tendency to react with the molecular oxygen of the microenvironment and generate singlet oxygen &#8208; in polar and non&#8208;polar environment was investigated. These studies are complemented by density functional theory (DFT) calculations to assess the possible electronic distribution on the frontier molecular orbitals within the complexes. As a result of charge transfer states, long&#8208;lived triplet excited states were formed and allowed for singlet oxygen generation. An initial screening of the AL(DIPY)3 complexes via in vitro phototoxicity studies against a mouse colon carcinoma cell line (CT26) was promising as these complexes were able to trigger cell death upon irradiation at nanomolar and micromolar concentrations. The results highlight the potential of aluminum dipyrrin complexes as a broadly applicable class of photosensitizers.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The combination of redox&#8208;active ferrocene moieties, conju&#173;gated B=N units, and p&#8208;phenylene building blocks in linearly concate&#173;nated architectural arrangements has been explored. Oligo&#8208; and poly(ferrocenylene iminoborane)s have been successfully prepared, whereby in the latter case, the formation of linear polymers vs. dis&#173;crete molecular macrocycles could be largely influenced by the poly&#173;merization conditions applied. In addition, a series of well&#8208;defined co&#8208;oligomers composed of ferrocenylene and p&#8208;phenylene moieties bridged by one or two B=N units in all possible combinations have been prepared, many of which have been structurally characterized using single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. Pendent triisopropylphenyl groups on boron provide pronounced kinetic stabilization. Polycon&#173;densation of complementary monomers gave copolymers comprising alternating ferrocenylene and p&#8208;phenylene iminoborane building blocks, which were found to be cyclic in nature. UV&#8208;vis absorption spectroscopic and electrochemical studies provided highly valuable insights into the interaction of the different moieties over the B=N bonds, particularly, the electronic communication between the elec&#173;troactive ferrocene units.</dc:description>

         <title>Pyrrolation of Melem: A Facile Gateway into the Field of Monomeric s&#8208;Heptazine Chemistry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Monomeric s&#8208;heptazines are an intriguing class of compounds with many attractive properties for various areas of application such as photocatalysis or organic light&#8208;emitting diodes. However, research into these properties has so far been challenging, as only a few synthetic routes for the preparation of monomeric s&#8209;heptazines are known in the literature. Furthermore, these few reported synthetic pathways generally require the use of specialized equipment that may not be available to all laboratories interested in studying monomeric s&#8209;heptazines. For this reason, a more accessible synthetic route for the preparation of monomeric s&#8209;heptazines has been developed in the course of this work. The central compound of this new approach is 2,5,8&#8208;tri(1H&#8208;pyrrol&#8208;1&#8208;yl)&#8208;s&#8208;heptazine, which could be conveniently synthesized via an acid catalyzed pyrrolation of melem with bench&#8208;stable 2,5&#8208;dimethoxytetrahydrofuran in a simple one&#8208;pot synthesis in air. This compound was shown to be a potent starting material for the synthesis of numerous other monomeric s&#8208;heptazines by reaction with both nucleophiles and electrophiles. The monomeric s&#8209;heptazines thus accessible were analyzed for their crystal structures by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and for their optical properties by ultraviolet/visible and photoluminescence spectroscopy.</dc:description>

         <title>Site&#8208;Selective Modification and Labeling of Native RNA</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The review highlights recent advancements in site&#8208;selective modification and labeling of native RNA, an important area for the development of RNA therapeutics and fundamental RNA research. The applications, current challenges of existing methods and potential future direction of this field are also discussed.







Abstract
Ribonucleic acid (RNA) plays a pivotal role in regulating biological processes within living systems, with modified nucleosides serving as critical modulators of various aspects of biological functions. Therefore, the development of efficient methodologies for late&#8208;stage, site&#8208;selective RNA modification is of considerable interest, as it facilitates the functional exploration of RNA chemical modifications and their implications for therapeutic applications. Precise RNA modification holds significant promise for the treatment of genetic diseases by enabling the correction of mutated nucleobases to their wild&#8208;type forms. Additionally, the site&#8208;selective incorporation of synthetic labeling groups into RNA provides invaluable tools for structural and functional studies, thereby uncovering previously hidden dimensions of RNA&#8242;s role in biological systems. In this review, we provide a comprehensive overview of three principal approaches to site&#8208;selective, late&#8208;stage RNA modifications: enzyme&#8208;mediated strategies, catalytic nucleic acid&#8208;based techniques, and chemical methodologies. These approaches predominantly target the nucleobase or the 2&#8217;&#8208;hydroxyl (2&#8217;&#8208;OH) group of RNA nucleosides. We evaluate the advantages and limitations of each strategy and discuss future directions for advancing this field of research.

         <title>Exploring Single Atom Substitution In Phenanthro[9,10&#8208;d]Imidazole &#8208;Based D&#8211;&#960;&#8211;A Architectures with Fluorene and its Heteroanalogs for Non&#8208;Volatile Resistive WORM Memory Device Applications</title>

         <dc:description>
The impact of single&#8208;atom substitution on the resistive switching memory behaviour of D&#8211;&#960;&#8211;A architectured phenanthroimidazole &#8208;based small organic molecules has been investigated. The compounds exhibited excellent organic resistive performance with a low threshold voltage, a high ON/OFF current ratio, and a long retention time.







Abstract
A series of D&#8211;&#960;&#8211;A compounds, with fluorene and its heteroanalogs (carbazole, dibenzofuran, dibenzothiophene) as the donor units and phenanthroimidazole as the acceptor, were designed and synthesized for non&#8208;volatile memory device applications. The effect of single&#8208;atom substitution on memory behavior was examined through optical, electrochemical, and computational studies. The photophysical studies confirm a significant intramolecular charge transfer from the donor to the acceptor unit, and the electrochemical analysis shows an irreversible anodic peak (0.99&#8211;1.21&#8197;V) with an optimal band gap ranging from 2.80 to 2.88&#8197;eV. All the compounds exhibited non&#8208;volatile binary WORM memory behaviour with an ON/OFF current ratio of 105 and 103. The devices also showed excellent stability over 100 cycles and maintained a retention time of 4000&#8197;s. Notably, the compound with carbazole substitution displayed a lower threshold voltage and a higher ON/OFF current ratio of 105. Density functional theory calculations confirmed that the combined effects of charge transfer and charge trapping mechanisms are crucial to the resistive switching mechanisms observed. This work highlights the potential of single atom substitution in D&#8211;&#960;&#8211;A systems, providing valuable insights for designing high&#8208;performance data storage devices.

         <title>Intramolecular Redox&#8208;Driven Synthesis of Mono&#8208; and Diradical Iridium(III) Complexes: Insights into Molecular and Electronic Structure, Electrochemistry, and Spin&#8208;Communication</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A one&#8208;pot synthetic method has been developed for stable iridium(III) radical complexes via in&#8208;situ metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand electron transfer, which have been characterized using structural, electrochemical, and spectroscopic techniques. A weak antiferromagnetic spin&#8208;spin interaction between the radical centers has been observed and validated through theoretical calculations. Additionally, a novel template synthesis of a diazotate complex derived from a bisazo&#8208;aromatic precursor is reported.







Abstract
Two &#960;&#8208;radical complexes containing bisazo&#8208;aromatic&#8208;centered radical anion (1&#8901;&#8722;) were synthesized through in&#8208;situ electron transfer from metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand using [IrI] and 2&#8208;(2&#8208;Pyridylazo)azobenzene (1) in inert hydrocarbon solvent. These are characterized as diradical [IrIII(1&#8901;&#8722;)2]+ [2]+ and monoradical [IrIII(1&#8901;&#8722;)Cl2(PPh3)] 3. In contrast, a rare metal&#8208;mediated hydrolytic cleavage of the C(sp2)&#8722;N bond occurred in protic solvent resulting in quaternary radical complex [IrIII(1&#8901;&#8722;)(1&#8242;)(PPh3)]+ (4)+. This provides an easy way to synthesize stable unsubstituted pyridine&#8208;2&#8208;diazotate (1&#8242;), an otherwise unstable organic template. Theoretical scrutiny has been performed at (U)B3LYP/6&#8211;31G(d,p)/LANL2DZ level to explore the origin of redox and optical properties in radical complexes. Magnetic study of [2]+ reveals that a weak antiferromagnetic (AF) spin&#8208;communication (J = &#8722;4.39&#8197;cm&#8722;1) exists between two radicals, leading to an open&#8208;shell singlet ground state. Broken symmetry density functional theory (BS&#8208;DFT) calculations were carried out to probe the nature of antiferromagnetic exchange interaction between the two radical centers in species [2]+. This method has been employed with different basis functionals (BP86, BLYP, OLYP, TPSS0, TPSSh, &#969;b97D and B3LYP) to comprehend the nature of the exchange in [2]+. The best result is obtained for pure functional OLYP with a J value &#8722;8.4&#8197;cm&#8722;1.

         <title>Synthesis and Characterization of a Non&#8208;Planar Cyclophenylene on Au(111)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The construction of an unprecedent gold&#8208;complexed cyclophenylene with meta&#8208; and para&#8208;phenylene linkages has been achieved by means of on&#8208;surface promoted dimerization of a 1,10&#8208;dibrominated angular [3] phenylene followed by regioselective fourfold C&#8722;C &#963;&#8208;bond activation at the four&#8208;membered rings. This finding highlights the non&#8208;trivial on&#8208;surface reactivity of [N] phenylenes and opens new perspectives for the synthesis of 3D cyclophenylenes and other carbon frameworks on solid surfaces.







Abstract
We report the surface&#8208;assisted synthesis of a non&#8208;planar cyclophenylene derivative containing four meta&#8208; and two para&#8208; connected phenylene moieties on Au(111), via hierarchical Ullmann coupling of a 1,10&#8208;dibrominated angular [3] phenylene and subsequent C&#8722;C bond cleavage at the four&#8208;membered rings. Scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy (STM/STS) were used for the characterization of its chemical structure and electronic properties. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations support the experimental observations.

         <title>Catalytic Serine Labeling in Nonaqueous, Acidic Media</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Serine&#8208;targeting protein bioconjugation has been a formidable challenge because of the modest reactivity of the alkyl alcohol group in aqueous media. This work demonstrates a biomolecule&#8208;compatible, nonaqueous approach to achieve alkyl alcohol&#8208;selective labeling through acid&#8208;catalyzed esterification reactions, which offers a unique advantage over the existing serine protease&#8208;targeting method using a fluorophosphonate reagent.







Abstract
Chemoselective modification of alkyl alcohols (e.&#8201;g., serine residues) on proteins has been a daunting challenge especially in aqueous media. Herein, we report chemical modification of alkyl alcohols in protein and cell lysate samples using carboxylic acid&#8208;based bioconjugation media. The acidic medium is not only useful to suppress reactivity of other nucleophiles in proteins, but the medium also serves as a potentially biomolecule&#8208;compatible solvent. The acid&#8208;catalyzed acylation strategy has a unique selectivity paradigm compared to the common active&#8208;serine&#8208;targeted method and would act as a new strategy for studying biological roles of serine residues.

         <title>Development of pH&#8208;Responsive SA/PEGDA/AS&#8208;POSS Hydrogels via Michael Addition for Controlled Drug Release and Enhanced Mechanical Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study develops pH&#8208;responsive SA/PEGDA/AS&#8208;POSS hydrogels through Michael addition reactions to achieve controlled drug release and enhanced mechanical properties. The hydrogels exhibit tunable swelling and degradation behaviors under various pH conditions, demonstrating their potential for targeted drug delivery. These hydrogels offer promising prospects for biomedical applications, providing efficient drug loading, controlled release, and improved mechanical strength.







Abstract
In this study, thiolated sodium alginate (SA) and hydrophilic, polymerizable Janus&#8208;type polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane (AS&#8208;POSS) are synthesized by introducing thiol and sulfonic acid groups, respectively. A series of pH&#8208;responsive SA/PEGDA/AS&#8208;POSS nanocomposite hydrogels are successfully prepared through Michael addition reactions between the thiol groups of thiolated sodium alginate and the double bonds in the molecular chains of AS&#8208;POSS and poly(ethylene glycol) diacrylate (PEGDA). This reaction proceeds rapidly under physiological conditions without requiring initiators or catalysts. As the content of AS&#8208;POSS increases, the pore size within the hydrogel decreases, and the network structure becomes denser, with significant improvements in mechanical properties. The hydrogel exhibits excellent pH sensitivity, showing lower swelling in acidic media compared to neutral media, and undergoing hydrolysis and losing stability in alkaline media. Moreover, the incorporation of AS&#8208;POSS significantly enhances the drug&#8208;loading capacity (85.7&#8201;%) and encapsulation efficiency (72.1&#8201;%) of doxorubicin (DOX). The drug is released faster in weakly acidic environments, with a cumulative release rate reaching 80.4&#8201;%, demonstrating excellent targeting and controlled release properties. Cytotoxicity tests show that the SA/PEGDA/AS&#8208;POSS hydrogel has good biocompatibility and exhibits effective tumor&#8208;killing ability, indicating its great potential as a drug carrier with promising applications in biomedical materials.

         <title>Progress in Double Dearomatization Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review paper presents an overview of the strategies and detailed examples of double dearomatization reactions involving various aromatic compounds, along with a discussion of the related mechanisms and the major challenges that still exist in this intriguing yet formidable field.







Abstract
Dearomatization reactions are among the most straightforward and efficient methods for creating sp3&#8208;rich cyclic systems from simple, readily available arenes. These reactions have been widely applied in the total synthesis of natural products, medicinal chemistry, and material sciences. The fruitful development of dearomatization strategies and methodologies targeting single aromatic substrate over the past decades has paved the way for more sophisticated multiple dearomatization processes, which offer greater advantages in constructing molecular complexity. Double dearomatization reactions have made significant pioneering strides in recent years. This review will provide an overview of the strategies and detailed examples of multiple dearomatization reactions involving various aromatic compounds, along with a discussion of the related mechanisms and the major challenges that remain in this intriguing yet formidable field.

         <title>Regio&#8208; and Redox Divergent Hydrated Ring Expansion of Butafulvenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>By providing highly functionalized building blocks in an efficient approach, catalytic hydration of alkenes plays a significant role in fundamental chemical transformations and pharmaceutical synthesis. However, hydration reactions have predominantly involved water and alkenes double bond alignment. Herein, we developed a regio&#8208; and redox divergent hydrated ring expansion protocol of butafulvenes. With the aid of PdII or acid catalysis, various highly functionalized and unsaturated cyclopentanone derivatives could be obtained in high regioselectivities under oxidative or redox neutral conditions. Isotope labeling experiments suggest that the carbonylic oxygen atom of target product is derived from water. In addition, the unsaturated cyclopentanone intermediate could undergo divergent transformations and serve as a key molecule to create skeletal editing compounds of butafulvenes via one&#8208;pot protocol, which highlights the potential applications of this strategy.</dc:description>

         <title>Two Consecutive Pathways Competing for Supramolecular Polymerization of Naphthalene&#8208;Diimide Molecules</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Depending on preparation methods, NDI molecules can assemble into J&#8208;type or H&#8208;type fibers along two pathways in organic solutions. Intermediate aggregates are observed by spectroscopy and imaging techniques along both pathways and further verified by thermodynamic model&#8208;fitting, suggesting two consecutive assembling pathways from identical initial conditions.







Abstract
The final outcomes of supramolecular assembly are determined by the pathways and the formation of intermediates during the assembly process. We studied pathway complexity involving two consecutive pathways in supramolecular polymerization of naphthalene&#8208;diimide (NDI) derivative molecule. Depending on preparation methods anisotropic aggregates of J&#8208;type nanorods (Agg&#8197;I) or more flexible H&#8208;type nanofibers (Agg&#8197;II) are obtained from the identical initial state in solution of methyl cyclohexane (MCH) or MCH/CHCl3 mixtures. More interestingly intermediate aggregates driven by intra&#8208;molecular hydrogen&#8208;bonds are observed by spectroscopy and imaging techniques for both pathways. Thermodynamic model&#8208;fitting suggests that both pathways are consecutive ones with intermediate aggregates. Combining density functional theory (DFT) calculation results, we propose the molecular packing of Agg&#8197;I and II. Our results reveal comprehensive pathway complexity in self&#8208;assembly of molecules as simple as NDI.

         <dc:description>Two pentamethine dyes with nearly identical structures but slightly different dipole moments were prepared as ion pairs. The ion pairs provided charge&#8208;segregated assemblies stabilized by dipole&#8211;dipole interactions between the positively charged &#960;&#8208;electronic systems. The stacking structure of the bromo&#8208;substituted pentamethine cation was more stabilized by a larger dipole moment, as suggested by energy decomposition analysis. Depending on the packing arrangements, highly electric conductive properties were observed owing to charge&#8208;segregated structures, as also correlated with the theoretically estimated transfer integrals.</dc:description>

         <title>Kinetic Control and Trapping in the Supramolecular Polymerization of m&#8208;Terphenyl Bis&#8208;Urea Macrocycles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we examine pathway complexity in the supramolecular polymerization of a novel&#160;m&#8208;terphenyl bis&#8208;urea macrocycle. Designed to induce kinetically metastable states, the macrocycle's concentration&#8208;dependent aggregation was studied via &#185;H NMR and IR spectroscopy in THF and CHCl&#8323;. Temperature&#8208;dependent UV&#8208;Vis spectroscopy in water/THF revealed a cooperative nucleation&#8208;growth mechanism, indicated by a shift in &#955;max to longer wavelengths upon cooling. Morphological studies using DLS, AFM, and SEM demonstrated fibrous aggregate formation. Thermal hysteresis observed in assembly&#8208;disassembly cycles indicated kinetically trapped species, with cooling governed by kinetic control and heating by thermodynamic processes. Deviations in &#916;H values during cooling, compared to van't Hoff analysis and alignment of heating &#916;H values with thermodynamic predictions, reinforced this distinction. Spontaneous nucleation retardation, resulting from monomer trapping, led to lag times of up to 50 minutes under specific conditions. Computational studies revealed parallel urea conformation as the more stable monomer configuration, whereas the antiparallel conformation is more stable in dimers. By probing pathway complexity of the macrocycle, we demonstrate a distinct ability to control and stabilize kinetically trapped states, broadening the scope for designing macrocyclic supramolecular polymers with tailored properties. This work deepens our understanding of supramolecular dynamics, exploring ON&#8208;pathway mechanisms and advancing tunable supramolecular materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Understanding the Nitrogen Reduction Reaction Mechanism on CuFeO2&#160;Photocathodes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This study investigates the reaction pathways for the conversion of N2&#160;to NH3&#160;on CuFeO2&#160;(CFO) by employing density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Concentrating on the most stable (012) surface orientation, two systems were examined: the pristine (012) surface and the corresponding oxygen defective surface. To find the thermodynamic stable pathway, the associative Heyrovsk&#253;&#160;mechanism was considered, containing four different reaction pathways.&#160; The reaction intermediates predominantly interact with the iron sites on the surface, following the distal alternating reaction pathway via the formation of hydrazine. Introducing oxygen defects changes the reaction mechanism to a Mars&#8208;van&#8208;Krevelen&#8208;type mechanism, avoiding the formation of hydrazine, while the Gibbs free energy of the first hydrogenation step is lowered by 1.17 eV (from 2.17 to 1.00 eV). Analyzing the charge density distribution reveals that oxygen defective surface enables CFO to facilitate a &#960;&#8208;backdonation between iron sites and the NRR intermediates, increasing the intermediate&#8208;surface interaction. This indicates an enhanced catalytic activity for the nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) by generating oxygen lattice defects in CFO.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>To study the amine&#8208;imine tautomeric alteration through excited state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT), three amine&#8208;functionalized metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) have been synthesized by using two different metal ions and neutral linkers along with same ESIPT&#8208;enable anionic linker through the slow diffusion process. All the MOFs have 2D structure with asymmetric units of {[Mn(2,6&#8208;dip)(2&#8208;atp)](H2O)(CH3OH)}n(1), {[Mn(3,5&#8208;dip)(2&#8208;atp)](solvent)x}n(2) and {Zn2(3,5&#8208;dip)2(2&#8208;atp)(&#956;2&#8208;O2&#8208;)](solvent)x}n(3) (where 2,6&#8208;dip = 2,6&#8208;di(1H&#8208;imidazol&#8208;1&#8208;yl)pyridine, 3,5&#8208;dip = 3,5&#8208;di(1H&#8208;imidazol&#8208;1&#8208;yl)pyridine, 2&#8208;atp = 2&#8208;amino terephthalic acid). The 2D networks of desolvated form of compound 1, 2, and 3 show water influencing proton transfer for amine&#8208;imine tautomerism in excited state through the ionic interaction with water molecules to the frameworks. However, in case of polar small chain aliphatic alcohols like methanol, ethanol and isopropanol; the compounds does not show any dual emissive ESIPT but exhibit three different intensified single peaks for each of the compounds. This different emission intensity in presence of different alcohols are helpful to detect these alcohols selectively. In addition to that in case of all three compounds, the water assisted&#8208;ESIPT is interrupted by some strong oxidizing agents like CrO42&#8208;, Cr2O72&#8208; and MnO4&#8208; ions. This phenomenon allows the method of detection for the aforesaid oxidizing ions in water by interruption of the dual emissive fluorescence.</dc:description>

         <title>NXS/TBHP as a Reagent System for Expedient Generation of Halogen Radicals: Site&#8208;Selective Halogenation of Quinoxalin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;ones and Conversion of Terminal Alkynes to gem&#8208;Dihaloketones</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report an efficient and practical protocol for the generation of halogen (Br and Cl) radicals using inexpensive and readily available N&#8208;bromo/N&#8208;chlorosuccinimide (NXS) and t&#8208;butylhydroperoxide (TBHP) at rt. The NXS/TBHP reagent systems are demonstrated for site&#8208;selective bromination and chlorination of the benzene&#8208;core of quinoxalin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;ones. It is shown that the reagent system permits regioselective halogenation at the C7 position of the benzene core over the readily&#8208;functionalized C3 position of quinoxalin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;ones under mild reaction conditions. We further show that terminal alkynes can be converted to gem&#8208;dihaloketones in a facile manner by NXS/TBHP. Mechanistically, single electron transfer between TBHP and NXS leads to instantaneous formation of electrophilic halogen radicals, which attack arenes and alkynes.</dc:description>

Mechanistically, single electron transfer between TBHP and NXS leads to instantaneous formation of electrophilic halogen radicals, which attack arenes and alkynes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Implicating the Role of Au&#8208;H Bonds in Photochemical N2 Fixation by Ruthenium Doped Gold Clusters</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dinitrogen fixation through the Nitrogen Reduction Reaction (NRR) under mild conditions without the use of sacrificial agents has its share of formidable hurdles. It has been shown recently that Ru&#8208;doped Au nanoclusters can reduce N2 molecule to NH3 only in the presence of UV&#8208;Vis light in aqueous medium. Herein, using theoretical techniques (Density Functional Theory) we shed light on the mechanistic avenues traversed for achieving this prodigious chemical feat. Our findings suggest that the bimetallic Au22Ru6 cluster successfully accomplishes the NRR process under ambient pressure and temperature conditions by the very virtue of its bifunctional nature. Contrary to the existing views, we find that NRR propagates through an alternative associative pathway, where the Ru dopant assists in N2 adsorption while the Au&#8208;H bonds formed from Au assisted water splitting is implicated for facilitating NRR.</dc:description>

         <title>Insights into the role of the D&#8208;cluster in [NiFe]&#8208;CODH from Rhodospirillum rubrum</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The [NiFe]&#8208;CODH from Rhodospirillum rubrum contains [4Fe4S] clusters that allow electron transfer from the buried active sites to the protein surface. Among them, the role of the D&#8208;cluster, located at the dimer interface is still not fully understood. In this study, the removal of the D&#8208;cluster by site&#8208;directed mutagenesis revealed remarkable features in the behavior of the enzyme. Quantitative analysis and spectroscopic studies unveiled the suppression of D&#8208;cluster in the mutants and the influence on other metal cofactors. Furthermore, the CO oxidation activity in solution measured in the presence of methylviologen is almost completely abolished in the mutants. Conversely, direct electrochemistry at a functionalized carbon nanotube electrode shows that the mutants are still catalytically active reaching reduced but significant current densities of 0.7 mA cm&#8208;2. Moreover, the electroenzymatic activity towards oxygen is not affected by the removal of the D cluster. EPR studies reveal a remarkable change in the magnetic coupling between FeS clusters upon removal of the D&#8208;cluster, highlighting the effect of the location of this D&#8208;cluster at the dimer interface. It is noteworthy that in addition to its role as electron relay, the D&#8208;cluster appears to play an important role in the biosynthesis of the active site.</dc:description>

         <title>Electronic Interactions in Coulombic Associated Photoactive Macrocycles to Chemically Modified MoS2 Nanosheets</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Whilst functionalization of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), and more specifically MoS2, has flourished the past decade, the accommodation of photoactive molecules on their lattice has unlocked the potentiality of this family of materials in a series of optoelectronic and energy related applications. The electronic communication between the chromophore and MoS2, in such systems, has been thoroughly studied, in cases where the grafting of the former on the latter is secured through covalent bonding. However, comparatively less attention has been drawn in cases where the chromophore is electrostatically anchored on MoS2, a means that potentially provides alternative ways of spatially accommodating the ligand on the TMD&#8217;s extended environment, which directly affects the electronic communication between the two entities. In this work, we comparatively study the photophysical characteristics of three separate nanoensembles, where MoS2 is electrostatically hosting a Zn&#8208;phthalocyanine, a Zn&#8208;porphyrin, and a boron&#8208;dipyrromethene, that complementary cover a wide range of visible absorption, via UV&#8208;Vis and photoluminescence spectroscopy. The results highlight the strong interactions in the excited state across all chromophores, while the ground&#8208;state interactions vary from chromophore to chromophore, indicating a distinct energy exchange dependent on the specific nanoensemble.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Porphyrin Derivatives Bearing Six Carboxylic Acids for the Formation of Three&#8208;Dimensional Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Network Structures</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>we synthesized a series of porphyrin derivatives with six carboxylic acid groups to explore their potential in forming hydrogen&#8208;bonded networks (YSHs). By systematically varying the position and structure of these carboxylic acid groups, we observed distinct types of hydrogen&#8208;bonded frameworks, including two&#8208; and three&#8208;dimensional networks. Using single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray crystallography, we confirmed that these derivatives form YSHs with unique structural properties influenced by carboxylic acid positioning and &#960;&#8208;&#960; interactions. The 1Zn derivative forms a robust 3D hydrogen&#8208;bonded network stabilized by &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking interactions, while the 2Ni derivative, with no such stacking, exhibits reduced stability and collapses upon solvent removal. Structural variations like the terphenylene and biphenyl linkers in 3Zn and 4Zn lead to flexible frameworks, while the 5Zn dimer forms two distinct structures depending on the solvent environment. Our findings reveal that careful control over carboxylic acid orientation and linker structure enables the design of diverse hydrogen&#8208;bonded networks with tunable stability and dimensionality. These insights advance our understanding of supramolecular assembly principles in porphyrin&#8208;based materials and offer new pathways for developing high&#8208;performance frameworks for applications in catalysis, sensing, and materials science.</dc:description>

         <title>Design of Rigid Compounds to Enhance Selectivity for Carbonic Anhydrase IX</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>High affinity and selectivity for intended targets is an important goal of small molecule design in drug discovery, yet balancing molecular flexibility and rigidity remains a challenge. While flexible compounds can increase target affinity, they often result in non&#8208;specific interactions and reduced selectivity. In contrast, rigid compounds may recognize their target more precisely and have lower off&#8208;target effects. In this study, we incorporated a 1,1&#8208;dioxido&#8208;1,4&#8208;thiazine ring into fluorinated benzenesulfonamide derivatives with bulky meta&#8208;substituents to enhance selectivity for human carbonic anhydrase IX (CAIX), an important cancer&#8208;associated target. Due to the structural similarities of CAIX with other carbonic anhydrase isozymes, selective inhibition remains a significant challenge. A series of 3,4&#8208;substituted trifluorobenzenesulfonamides containing oxidized thiazine rings were synthesized using a novel synthetic pathway. Although the potency against CAIX was modestly reduced compared to more flexible analogs, selectivity increased significantly, with lead compounds 7d and 7e exhibiting over 1000&#8208;fold selectivity for CAIX over most other isozymes. X&#8208;ray crystallography revealed the structural basis for this selectivity, confirming the advantageous positioning of rigidified compounds within some CA isozyme active sites. These findings highlight the potential of molecular rigidity in the design of highly selective inhibitors for therapeutic applications.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In recent years, porous organic cages have gained in importance, inter alia, due to their ability to be processed from solution. Especially the packing of the cages in the solid state structure has a significant effect on the porosity. Therefore, it is important to be able control the packing pattern either by crystallization conditions or the interaction of molecular units, defined as crystal engineering synthons. Here, tribromoarene subunits as such are incorporated into cage structures, namely a [2+3] and a [4+4] imine cages, to study the reliability of thus subunit as crystal engineering synthon. Several solvatomorphs of both cages were studied by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and packing patterns thoroughly analyzed. Among those solvatomorphs an interpenetrated Faujasite&#8208;type supramolecular arrangement is found.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Attempts to generate NacNacAl&#8208;based (NacNac = [ArNC(Me)CHC(Me)NAr]&#8210;; Ar = 2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3) alkylidenes via reactions with trimethyl(methylidene), triphenyl(methylidene) and triethyl(ethylidene) phosphiranes led to new and unexpected reactivity patterns. Reaction with Me3P=CH2 resulted in the intermolecular deprotonation of the NacNac &#8208;CCH3 backbone. Reaction with Ph3P=CH2*LiI afforded an equimolar mixture of NacNacAlH2 and the ortho&#8208;metalated adduct, NacNac&#8217;Al(&#951;(C,C)2&#8208;CH2=PPh2(o&#8208;C6H4)) (NacNac&#8217; = [ArNC(Me)CHC(=CH2)NAr]2&#8210;). Finally, the use of Et3P=CHMe*LiBr resulted in the fragmentation of the NacNac moiety.</dc:description>

         <title>Development of a Highly Selective Synthesis of 4&#8211;Substituted Tetrahydroquinolines: Substrate Scope and Mechanistic Study</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we describe a general and selective deprotonation functionalization reaction of tetrahydroquinolines at the 4&#8211;position using organolithiums and phosphoramide ligands. In addition to the development of a direct deprotonation alkylation reaction with primary and secondary alkyl halides, a Negishi cross&#8211;coupling protocol was realized to afford products with a range of aromatic halides. These methods were applied to the late&#8208;stage installation of tetrahydroquinolines into a variety of substrates including pharmaceuticals as well as natural product analogues. The use of thorough mechanistic investigations revealed the aggregation state of the newly formed tetrahydroquinoline anion to be a separated ion pair, which proved critical to optimizing the reaction conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Metal Exchange in Thioguanosine Coordination Polymers of Gold (I) and Silver (I)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Heterometallic coordination polymers of Au(I) and Ag(I) with 6&#8208;thioguanosine, poly([AuxAg1&#8208;x(6&#8722;tG)]), have been prepared and were observed to form hydrogels. We find that the composition of the heterometallic polymer is proportional to&#160;the mole fractions of the metals in the preparation solution. Optical absorption spectra show single peaks for &#955; &gt; 300 nm which can be interpolated in a linear manner between x = 0.0 and x = 1.0 consistent with the formation of a heterometallic polymer rather than a mixture of homopolymers. However photoluminescence and circular dichroism spectra are sensitive to the supramolecular structure of the polymers and show more complex behaviour. Atomic force microscopy indicated that the molecular chains of the Au homopolymer entwine to form strands that are predominantly right&#8208;hand helices. The&#160;Ag homopolymer&#160;has previously been shown to form left&#8208;hand helices. Intermediate compositions have more complex structures because of the competition between the left and right&#8208;handed preferences of the homopolymers. Finally, we have shown that the metal&#8208;ligand bonds are labile on a timescale of about 5 h at ambient temperature (about 293 K). Mixtures of homopolymers transform to the corresponding heterometallic coordination polymer by metal exchange as judged by optical absorption, photoluminescence and circular dichroism spectra.</dc:description>

         <title>Alexidine and Pentamidine Fold Inside the Bowl&#8208;Shaped Cavity of p&#8208;Sulfonato&#8208;calix[4]arene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report on the U&#8208;shaped folding of flexible guest molecules of medicinal interest upon their inclusion into macrocyclic cavity of p&#8208;sulfonato&#8208;calix[4]arene in aqueous media. Alexidine and pentamidine are FDA&#8208;approved drug compounds currently rediscovered as potent membrane&#8208;targeting antibiotic adjuvants helping restore antibiotic activity against multidrug resistant bacteria pathogens. We have adopted host&#8208;guest and crystal engineering approach to study these drugs with a view of potential supramolecular formulations and/or crystal forms. We focus on the host&#8208;guest conformational and structural behaviour of alexidine and pentamidine under macrocyclic confinement conditions benefitting from single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis, self&#8208;assembly studies in solution by NMR spectroscopy, dynamic light scattering and atomic force microscopy, and ion mobility mass spectrometry (IM&#8208;MS) analysis complemented by theoretical calculations. Our findings show that the simple bowl&#8208;shaped host promotes conformational fixing and crystallization of these guest molecules of high conformational freedom that are otherwise challenging to crystallize. The IM&#8208;MS structural studies of p&#8208;sulfonato&#8208;calix[4]arene complexes with pentamidine and alexidine revealed significant guest reorganization in the solution/gas phase, compared to the binding modes observed in the crystal structures. Despite these changes, the host&#8208;guest complexation remained consistent, with new interactions highlighting the increased role of electrostatic forces in the gas phase.</dc:description>

         <title>Single&#8208;Atom Metal Species as A Promoter to Enhance Heterogeneous Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) have emerged as a focal point of research in the field of heterogeneous catalysis. This paper reviews the progress in the studies of single atoms as promoters in various catalytic reactions, elucidating their distinctive role in comparison to the dominant active sites. We provide a discussion on the application of single&#8208;atom promoters (SAP) within host&#8208;guest systems in various catalysts, including metal oxide supported catalysts, molybdenum carbide&#8208;based catalysts, bimetallic catalysts, and others. The behavior of SAP is diverse. They often promote the formation of oxygen vacancies for oxide support, leading to local site reconstruction that creates specific reaction route. Moreover, they can also precisely modify the electronic structure of hetero&#8208;metal atomic or nanoparticle sites, then regulating the adsorption of reactants or intermediates and catalytic performance. Finally, the potential for the development of SAP is outlined, proposing novel approach for the design of SACs with enhanced activity and stability.</dc:description>

         <title>Dual Charge&#8208;Transfer Emission in Chalcone&#8208;based Donor&#8208;&#960;&#8208;Acceptor System and The Modulation of Down&#8208;Conversion of Triplet Exciton with the Polarity of the Medium</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) has recently emerged as a promising process with significant potential to advance organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) for display applications. The donor&#8208;acceptor system is a well&#8208;known molecular arrangement exhibiting TADF properties. However, our investigation into the chalcone&#8208;based donor&#8208;&#960;&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A) system (SKG1) reveals that the en&#8208;one bridging unit in chalcone plays a crucial role in the reverse intersystem crossing (rISC) process and may be responsible for the existence of two conformational isomers. In stark contrast with the conventional endothermic TADF process, the designed molecule follows a down&#8208;converted cold rISC pathway that also from a higher&#8208;lying triplet (Tn) state to the lowest singlet (S1) state (in toluene) with remarkably short delayed fluorescence lifetime of 350 ns. Additionally, this rISC process is found to be sensitive to the polarity of the medium. The UV&#8208;vis&#8208;NIR transient absorption spectroscopy reveals an ultrafast intersystem crossing (ISC) process within &lt;100ps and the involvement of higher lying triplet state in rISC process. This comprehensive research deepens the understanding of the rISC mechanism and paves the way for developing next&#8208;generation OLED materials using D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A&#8208;based delayed emitters.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The macrocyclic biquinazoline ligand, H&#8208;Mabiq, presents a central and a peripheral site for the coordination of metal ions, making the adsorption on solid surfaces promising for the creation of self&#8208;assembled bimetallic two&#8208;dimensional platforms. Here, we apply an on&#8208;surface metalation strategy under ultra&#8208;high vacuum conditions to guide the synthesis of metalated species and study sequential metalation patterns. We find that cobalt (as well as iron) metalation on the Ag(111) surface preferentially occurs at the macrocyclic centre without further metal coordination to the peripheral site. Nevertheless, starting from a densely packed, self&#8208;assembled H&#8208;Mabiq monolayer, the modification of the central cavity by Co is accompanied by an unusual, metalation&#8208;induced phase transformation which gives evidence of modified lateral / interfacial interactions. The selective metalation of one molecular site opens up an on&#8208;surface route to create bimetallic networks incorporating select metal ions at different locations.</dc:description>

         <title>Improving the Long&#8208;term Enantioselectivity of a Silicon&#8208;Carbon Bond&#8208;Forming Enzyme</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Enantioselectivity is a key advantage of enzymatic catalysis. Understanding the most important factors influencing enantioselectivity necessitates thorough investigation for each specific enzyme. In this study, we explore various approaches to optimize reaction conditions for organosilicon production using an immobilized Cytochrome C recently tailored via directed evolution. Over extended reactions, this enzyme experiences a loss of enantioselectivity. Mass spectrometry (MS) revealed covalent modifications on the enzyme, but mutating the respective amino acids did not restore enantioselectivity. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), along with a detailed comparison of the influence of reaction components such as cosolvents and reducing agents, indicated significant conformational changes in the presence of the diazo ester substrate. Additionally, we identified sodium ascorbate as a suitable and milder reducing agent compared to the previously used sodium dithionite, ensuring anaerobic conditions for silicon&#8208;carbon bond formation. Ultimately, maintaining a high enzyme&#8208;to&#8208;substrate ratio in the reaction was found to be crucial for achieving high enantiomeric purity of the organosilicon product over four days in sequential, repetitive batch reactions, thus improving the previously established reaction system. The methods and findings presented here are particularly valuable for addressing enantioselectivity issues in other enzymes that operate with diazo compounds as the substrates in carbene&#8208;transfer reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Single&#8208;molecule Magnet Properties of Silole&#8208; and Stannole&#8208;ligated Erbium Cyclo&#8208;octatetraenyl Sandwich Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthesis, structures and magnetic properties of an &#951;5&#8208;silole complex and an &#951;5&#8208;stannole complex of erbium are reported. The sandwich complex anions [(&#951;5&#8208;CpSi)Er(&#951;8&#8208;COT)]&#8211; and [(&#951;5&#8208;CpSn)Er(&#951;8&#8208;COT)]&#8211;, where CpSi is [SiC4&#8208;2,5&#8208;(SiMe3)2&#8208;3,4&#8208;Ph2]2&#8211; (1Si), CpSn is [SnC4&#8208;2,5&#8208;(SiMe3)2&#8208;3,4&#8208;Me2]2&#8211; (1Sn) and COT = cyclo&#8208;octatetraenyl, were obtained as their [K(2.2.2&#8208;cryptand)]+ salts and found to be isostructural, with remarkably similar bond lengths and angles, differing only in the lengths of the Er&#8211;E interactions (E = Si, Sn). The parallels in the molecular structures of 1Si and 1Sn are reflected in their dynamic magnetic properties, which show single&#8208;molecule magnet behaviour in zero applied field, with effective energy barriers of 115 &#177; 7 and 125 &#177; 3 cm&#8211;1, respectively, along with comparable magnetic relaxation times. Analysis of the two complexes using ab initio calculations reveals differences at a quantitative level, but overall similar electronic structures, with the thermally activated relaxation likely to proceed via the first&#8208;excited Kramers doublet. Comparing 1Si and 1Sn with the previously reported germanium analogue 1Ge reveals that swapping one heavier group 14 element for another in complexes of the type [(&#951;5&#8208;CpE)Er(&#951;8&#8208;COT)]&#8211; has a minimal impact on the SMM behaviour.</dc:description>

         <title>Zirconium(IV)&#8208;Catalysed Hydrosilylation of Organic Carbonates and Polycarbonates Household Wastes into Alcohol Derivatives.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The Schwartz&#8217;s reagent Cp2Zr(H)Cl is a well known stoichiometric reagent for the reduction of unsaturated organic molecules but it has rarely been used in catalytic transformations. Herein, we describe the reduction of a variety of organic carbonates using the catalyst Cp2Zr(H)Cl in combination with Me(MeO)2SiH (DMMS) as reductant. This method was further applied to the reductive depolymerization of some polycarbonate materials and yielded silylated alcohols and diols in mild conditions. This method for the recycling polycarbonates is characterized by its stability to the additives contained in household plastics as well as its ability to selectively depolymerize the polycarbonate PC&#8208;BPA when mixed with the polyester PET. Experimental investigations brought evidences on a mechanism based on the succession of a three steps sequence comprising the hydrozirconation of the carbonyl fragment, thermal &#963; C&#8211;O bond cleavage, and an ultimate Zr&#8211;OR/Si&#8211;H &#963;&#8208;bond metathesis reaction to regenerate the hydride catalyst.</dc:description>

         <title>Label&#8208;free 3D cell imaging using hydrogels functionalized with switchable iridium complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The use of fluorescent labels is the most common tool to visualize cells. However, the internalization of dye molecules often modifies the cell behavior. In this paper we demonstrate that it is possible to transiently label cells using a 3D scaffold, a hydrogel, covalently functionalized with luminescent cyclometalated iridium(III) complexes. The unique feature of our design is that the complexes are emissive only when they interact with the cell membrane while their emission is quenched in water. We exploited this feature to perform real&#8208;time and staining&#8208;free cell visualization and imaging. The hydrogels immerged in culture media are non&#8208;luminescent, however, when cells are added to it, they interact with the iridium complexes, covalently linked to the gel, and their lipophilic membrane &#8220;switches on&#8221; the luminescence enabling a clear and dynamic, real&#8208;time 3D visualization of cell proliferation. A complete photophysical and biological study of the materials is presented which demonstrates the potential of our methodology for 3D&#8208;realtime cell tracking.</dc:description>

         <title>Azine Dearomatization in Natural Product Total Synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Since antiquity, alkaloid natural products have served as medicinal ingredients that still contribute as an inspiration for the development of novel therapeutics. For the synthetic chemist, much of the importance of natural products lies in their acting as a forcing&#8208;function for the invention of new synthetic strategies and tactics for molecular assembly. With this rich history in mind, it remains an important goal for chemists to build nitrogenous structures with greater efficiency, abiding by economies of synthesis. Nitrogenous aromatic feedstocks have been an intriguing starting point for the functionalization and construction of alkaloids for several decades, but recent advances in reaction design have opened new doors for leveraging their abundance in concise synthesis. Herein, advances in this area of synthetic ingenuity will be summarized with the aim of instructing chemists towards considering dearomatization as a strategic avenue for both target&#8208;oriented and diversity&#8208;oriented synthetic campaigns. Overall, syntheses are evaluated, compared, and contrasted to give a systematic overview of this continued area of research.</dc:description>

         <title>Peptide&#8208;Scaffolded Detergents for Membrane Protein Studies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Detergents are essential for preserving the structural integrity and functionality of membrane proteins (MPs) outside the biological membrane or in aqueous solution, and thus ensuring accurate biochemical and structural analyses. Here, we introduce peptide&#8208;scaffolded detergents, a novel class of hybrid molecules formed by preassembling detergent monomers with peptides of varying lengths, mediated via Click chemistry. These detergents are characterized by scalable, straightforward synthesis and enhanced solubility. Among the variants, A4B2 emerged as the optimal detergent, demonstrating superior thermal stabilization across a range of G protein&#8208;coupled receptors, including A2AAR, SMO and GLP&#8208;1R. Additionally, A4B2 exhibits a low critical micelle concentration and small micelle size, together making it particularly effective for electron microscopy studies of A2AAR. This innovative design leverages the benefits of peptide&#8208;based and traditional detergents, offering new insights for the development of advanced detergents in MP research.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Detergents are essential for preserving the structural integrity and functionality of membrane proteins (MPs) outside the biological membrane or in aqueous solution, and thus ensuring accurate biochemical and structural analyses. Here, we introduce peptide-scaffolded detergents, a novel class of hybrid molecules formed by preassembling detergent monomers with peptides of varying lengths, mediated via Click chemistry. These detergents are characterized by scalable, straightforward synthesis and enhanced solubility. Among the variants, A4B2 emerged as the optimal detergent, demonstrating superior thermal stabilization across a range of G protein-coupled receptors, including A2AAR, SMO and GLP-1R. Additionally, A4B2 exhibits a low critical micelle concentration and small micelle size, together making it particularly effective for electron microscopy studies of A2AAR. This innovative design leverages the benefits of peptide-based and traditional detergents, offering new insights for the development of advanced detergents in MP research.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Tetrabutylammonium Chlorite as an Efficient Oxidant for Controlled Oxidation of Sulfides to Sulfoxides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Considering the demand for organosulfur materials and the challenges associated with currently used oxidation processes, in this study, we evaluated the counter&#8208;cation of sodium chlorite (Na+ClO2&#8211;) with tetrabutylammonium chloride (Bu4N+Cl&#8211;) to synthesise tetrabutylammonium chlorite (Bu4N+ClO2&#8211;). Bu4N+ClO2&#8211;&#160;exhibited good solubility in organic solvents like chloroform (1.6 g mL&#8211;1) and ethyl acetate (0.86 g mL&#8211;1). The oxygenation reaction of organosulfides with Bu4N+ClO2&#8211;&#160;was examined in an HCl&#8208;acidic ethyl acetate solution under ambient conditions, selectively forming the corresponding sulfoxides as mono&#8208;oxygenated products. The reaction was initiated by the formation of chlorine dioxide (ClO2&#8226;) as an oxidant and an active species generated from Bu4N+ClO2&#8211;&#160;with HCl. This oxygenation method also enables the surface oxidation of sulfide polymers like polyphenylene sulfide (PPS) resins to increase their surface hydrophilicity. Therefore, the use of Bu4N+ClO2&#8211;&#160;for applications in organic solvents is an environment&#8208;friendly, efficient, and highly selective approach for selective oxidation.</dc:description>

         <title>Oxidative Neutralisation of Sulfur&#8208;based Chemical Warfare Agents Mediated by a Lipase: from Batch to Flow Reactor</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The sulfur&#8208;containing chemical warfare agents sulfur mustard HD and nerve agent VX are highly toxic and persistent in the environment. Therefore, their neutralisation requires harsh oxidation conditions, but also precise selectivity. Here we report the safe and effective detoxification of surrogates CEES and PhX by selective oxidation of the sulfur atom by generating peracetic acid from AcOEt and aq. H2O2 assisted by the supported lipase CALB. Morever, it is possible to perform these neutralisations with safe &#8216;on demand&#8217; generation of AcOOH in a flow system by using a packed bed reactor containing the supported biocatalyst.</dc:description>
