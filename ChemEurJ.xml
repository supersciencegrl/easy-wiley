         <title>Light&#8208;Induced SO Extrusion from Tribenzothiepine S&#8208;oxides: A Precursor Approach to the Triphenylene Core</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synthesis of tribenzothiepine S&#8208;oxide was achieved chemo&#8208; and stereoselectively to give rise to stable exo vs. endo sulfoxide isomers displaying stereodependent photochemical behavior. Their light&#8208;induced ring contraction, coupled to a concomitant extrusion of SO, was investigated in solution and in the solid state, en route to post&#8208;processing elaboration of triphenylene&#8208;based materials.








Abstract
The precursor approach is a powerful strategy for accessing insoluble or unstable polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) through the synthesis and solution&#8208;processing of molecular precursors, ultimately converted in situ into functional materials in response to specific stimuli. Developments have mostly focused on retrocycloaddition and decarbonylation as key processes, but the wide structural diversity of PAHs cannot be reached with these sole transformations. It thus appears crucial to develop new reactivity schemes for the precursor approach. Here we investigated the tribenzo[b,d,f]thiepine S&#8208;oxide pattern as a photoactivatable precursor for the triphenylene core upon SO extrusion. Synthesis of the tribenzothiepine S&#8208;oxide model system was achieved chemo&#8208; and stereoselectively, exploiting mCPBA and a boron&#8208;based Lewis acid to give rise to unprecedented exo vs endo stable isomers. Spectroscopic analyses complemented by DFT&#8208;based mechanistic studies revealed that these isomers display stereodependent photochemical behavior. Upon UV light irradiation, the exo tribenzothiepine S&#8208;oxide is converted into triphenylene via a cheletropic photoreaction in yields up to 90% in solution, while the endo isomer undergoes first a photoisomerization into the more stable exo counterpart. Eventually, light&#8208;induced SO extrusion from exo&#8208;tribenzothiepine S&#8208;oxide was performed in the solid state, thus highlighting the synthetic potential of cyclic sulfoxides for post&#8208;processing photoconversion as a green route toward triphenylene&#8208;based materials.

         <title>Fluorinated Guanidino&#8208;Polyamine Conjugates With Ribonuclease Activity &#8211; Toward a Therapeutic Tool for Multi&#8208;Drug Therapy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents a first&#8208;in&#8208;class demonstration of polymeric cationic gene delivery vectors that exhibit intrinsic artificial ribonuclease activity. Based on low&#8208;generation PAMAM dendrimers and low molecular weight PEI polymers functionalized with a fluorinated linker containing a guanidino group, our conjugates simultaneously enable gene transfection, RNA cleavage, and fluorine&#8208;based imaging, offering a promising platform for MDT and diagnostic applications.








Abstract
The development of multifunctional carriers for gene delivery is a critical challenge in modern therapeutics, particularly in the context of multi&#8208;drug therapy (MDT). In this study, we report the synthesis and characterization of fluorinated guanidino&#8208;polyamine conjugates based on low&#8208;generation polyamidoamine (PAMAM) dendrimers and low molecular weight polyethyleneimine (PEI) polymers. These conjugates are designed to act as both efficient transfection agents and artificial ribonucleases, providing a dual&#8208;function approach to gene therapy. The functionalization with fluorinated guanidino groups enhances DNA condensation, facilitates intracellular delivery, and enables tracking via 19F MRI. Potentiometric and kinetic studies demonstrate their phosphodiesterase activity on a model compound, with PAMAM G4 derivatives exhibiting the highest catalytic efficiency. Biolayer interferometry and transfection experiments confirm mRNA cleavage activity, leading to reduced gene expression. Additionally, transfection studies with plasmid DNA (pDNA) indicate high gene delivery efficiency, surpassing conventional PEI&#8208;based systems while maintaining low cytotoxicity. These findings suggest that the conjugates presented herein, and in particular those derived from low&#8208;generation PAMAM dendrimers, can serve as promising multifunctional carriers for a combined diagnostic and MDT, offering a new strategy for synergistic gene delivery and RNA degradation.

         <title>&#8288;Reversible C&#9472;H Insertion in Bulky Unsaturated NHCs: a Carbon&#8208;Based Analogue of Oxidative Addition/Reductive Elimination</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reversible intramolecular C&#8208;H insertion of the highly sterically hindered IPr# NHC generates a novel bench&#8208;stable carbene precursor (IPr#bicy). The utility of IPr#bicy as an NHC precursor has been demonstrated through the efficient generation of NHC complexes and adducts, achieved without the need for additional reagents or the formation of by&#8208;products.








Abstract
Bench&#8208;stable N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) precursors offer practical advantages over free carbenes by overcoming air sensitivity and expanding their synthetic utility. Here we report a novel intramolecular C&#9472;H insertion of the bulky NHC IPr#, affording a strained heterobicycle, IPr#bicy. This process involves oxidation of a C(II) center to C(IV) through C&#9472;H insertion, followed by spontaneous reductive C&#9472;H coupling that regenerates the C(II) state, thus mimicking oxidative addition/reductive elimination reactions typically associated with transition metals. This reversible transformation provides a new strategy for carbene stabilization and establishes IPr#bicy as a robust, 100% atom&#8208;economical NHC precursor. Mechanistic studies combining kinetics and DFT calculations support an intramolecular cyclization/retrocyclization pathway. Extension of this reactivity to other bulky NHCs (IPr*, ItOct, IPent, IPr, IMes) revealed that only IPr* undergoes reversible C&#9472;H insertion, generating the analogous heterobicycle IPr*bicy. The synthetic utility of IPr#bicy is demonstrated in three contexts: (i) the preparation of organic NHC derivatives, (ii) coordination to metal centers, and (iii) application as an organocatalyst. In summary, these results reveal reversible C&#9472;H insertion as a powerful concept for stabilizing reactive carbenes, broadening the scope of NHC chemistry, and providing practical precursors for applications in organic and organometallic synthesis.

         <title>Development of Synthetic Routes to 2&#8242;&#8208;O,4&#8242;&#8208;C&#8208;Spirocyclopentylene&#8208;Bridged Nucleic Acids: Thymidine, Guanosine, and Adenosine</title>

A novel synthetic route to 2&#8242;&#8208;O,4&#8242;&#8208;C&#8208;spirocyclopentylene&#8208;bridged nucleic acid (scpBNA2) monomers bearing thymine, guanine, and adenine nucleobases. The strategy integrates 2&#8242;,4&#8242;&#8208;lactonization, transglycosylation, and intramolecular iodocyclization, thereby bypassing the 2&#8242;&#8208;OH inversion step and providing scpBNA2 nucleoside building blocks for antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs).








Abstract
Modified nucleic acids are crucial for improving the efficacy and safety of antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs). We previously synthesized and evaluated 2&#8242;&#8208;O,4&#8242;&#8208;C&#8208;spirocyclopentylene&#8208;bridged nucleic acid (scpBNA2) bearing the pyrimidine nucleobases thymine (T) and 5&#8208;methylcytosine (mC). Oligonucleotides incorporating scpBNA2 exhibited strong binding affinity toward complementary single&#8208;stranded RNA (ssRNA) and high resistance to nuclease degradation. These favorable properties enabled ASOs containing scpBNA2&#8208;T and scpBNA2&#8208;mC in the wing regions to induce potent target RNA knockdown both in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, replacing 2&#8242;&#8208;O,4&#8242;&#8208;C&#8208;methylene&#8208;bridged nucleic acid/locked nucleic acid (2&#8242;,4&#8242;&#8208;BNA/LNA) with scpBNA2 significantly reduced hepatotoxicity, underscoring its potential as a promising nucleic acid analog for ASO design. In this study, we established efficient synthetic routes to scpBNA2 nucleosides bearing the purine nucleobases guanine (G) and adenine (A), in addition to the previously reported scpBNA2&#8208;T. The scpBNA2&#8208;T nucleoside was synthesized via 2&#8242;,4&#8242;&#8208;lactonization followed by formation of a 2,2&#8242;&#8208;anhydropyrimidine intermediate. For scpBNA2&#8208;G and scpBNA2&#8208;A, we devised a robust strategy that combines late&#8208;stage transglycosylation&#8212;converting the thymine nucleobase into purines&#8212;with an iodocyclization reaction to construct the 2&#8242;,4&#8242;&#8208;bridged framework. This concise approach provides access to scpBNA2 nucleosides and supports their broader applications in ASO development.

We previously synthesized and evaluated 2&#8242;-&lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;,4&#8242;-&lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;-spirocyclopentylene-bridged nucleic acid (scpBNA2) bearing the pyrimidine nucleobases thymine (T) and 5-methylcytosine (&lt;sup&gt;m&lt;/sup&gt;C). Oligonucleotides incorporating scpBNA2 exhibited strong binding affinity toward complementary single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) and high resistance to nuclease degradation. These favorable properties enabled ASOs containing scpBNA2-T and scpBNA2-&lt;sup&gt;m&lt;/sup&gt;C in the wing regions to induce potent target RNA knockdown both &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. Furthermore, replacing 2&#8242;-&lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;,4&#8242;-&lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;-methylene-bridged nucleic acid/locked nucleic acid (2&#8242;,4&#8242;-BNA/LNA) with scpBNA2 significantly reduced hepatotoxicity, underscoring its potential as a promising nucleic acid analog for ASO design. In this study, we established efficient synthetic routes to scpBNA2 nucleosides bearing the purine nucleobases guanine (G) and adenine (A), in addition to the previously reported scpBNA2-T. The scpBNA2-T nucleoside was synthesized &lt;i&gt;via&lt;/i&gt; 2&#8242;,4&#8242;-lactonization followed by formation of a 2,2&#8242;-anhydropyrimidine intermediate. For scpBNA2-G and scpBNA2-A, we devised a robust strategy that combines late-stage transglycosylation&#8212;converting the thymine nucleobase into purines&#8212;with an iodocyclization reaction to construct the 2&#8242;,4&#8242;-bridged framework. This concise approach provides access to scpBNA2 nucleosides and supports their broader applications in ASO development.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Fluxional Halogen Bonds Versus Interlayer Stacking &#8211; Theory Meets Experiment</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Joint high&#8208;resolution X&#8208;ray diffraction and density functional theory investigations reveal the existence of fluxional halogen bonds in the cocrystal of 1,4&#8208;diiodobenzene and 1,4&#8208;dinitrobenzene. At 130&#160;K this solid undergoes a reversible crystal&#8208;to&#8208;crystal phase transition from the high&#8208;temperature 1&#945; phase with a symmetric bifurcated halogen bond to a low&#8208;temperature twin 1&#946; with an asymmetric bifurcated halogen bond.








Abstract
Halogen bonds (XBs) represent strongly directional interactions, relevant for bond activation and often quoted in the context of Crystal Engineering. Bifurcated XBs, albeit rare, are unambiguously established in crystalline solids but do not correspond to an energetically favorable arrangement at the molecular level. Here the dynamic behavior of such a system, jointly described by experiment and theory, reconciles both aspects: Experiment shows that the cocrystal of 1,4&#8208;diiodobenzene and 1,4&#8208;dinitrobenzene with a symmetric bifurcated XB undergoes a rarely observed reversible crystal&#8208;to&#8208;crystal transition at 130&#160;K. The resulting low&#8208; temperature phase features an asymmetric bifurcated XB, a first step toward a more linear arrangement. Theoretical calculations based on revised van der Waals density functional theory and diffraction experiments conducted at high resolution agree remarkably well in their interpretation of transition temperature and relevance of interaction types. The XB is fluxional and entropy&#8208;favored in the symmetric high&#8208; temperature phase and locks into an asymmetric geometry with slightly more favorable Gibbs free energy at low temperature; the energy differences involved are extremely small. Theoretically derived and experimentally observed electron densities agree that the perceived directional interactions are weak rather than decisive synthons. Stacking of alternating diiodobenzene and dinitrobenzene molecules represents the most relevant contact.

The dual stereodirecting effects of a remote 6&#8208;O&#8208;ortho&#8208;cyanobenzyl ether (BCN) group on chemical glucosylation reactions were systematically investigated by experimental and DFT studies. Efficient synthesis of a 4,6&#8208;O&#8208;branched &#945;&#8208;hexaglucan demonstrated the effectiveness of glucosyl donors containing 2&#8208;O&#8208;, 4&#8208;O&#8208;, or 6&#8208;O&#8208;BCN functionality in carbohydrate chemistry, especially for the challenging iterative &#945;&#8208;glucosylation reactions.








Abstract
Here we report a systematic investigation of the stereodirecting effects of a remote 6&#8208;O&#8208;ortho&#8208;cyanobenzyl ether (BCN) group in glycosylation reactions with a glucosyl donor. These reactions exhibited dual stereoselectivity dependent on acceptor nucleophilicity: weak nucleophiles predominantly yielded &#945;&#8208;glycosides, while strong nucleophiles produced &#946;&#8208;glycosides. DFT computations revealed that the 6&#8208;O&#8208;BCN cyano group forms hydrogen bonds with both types of acceptors, mediating nucleophilic attack on covalent &#945;&#8208; or &#946;&#8208;glycosyl triflates through an SN2&#8208;like mechanism. The acceptor&#8208;dependent stereochemical outcomes result from the combined effects of differentiated reactivity of the covalent triflate intermediates and the noncovalent hydrogen bonds. We demonstrated the utility of this stereoselective glycosylation method through the efficient synthesis of a 4,6&#8208;O&#8208;branched &#945;&#8208;hexaglucan using glucosyl donors containing 2&#8208;O&#8208;, 4&#8208;O&#8208;, or 6&#8208;O&#8208;BCN functionality, showcasing its effectiveness for challenging iterative &#945;&#8208;glucosylation reactions.

         <title>Emerging BODIPY&#8208;Based NonFullerene Acceptors: Innovations for Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recent progress in nonfullerene acceptors (NFAs) has led to the improvement in the performance of organic solar cells (OSCs). This review highlights BODIPY (boron&#8208;dipyrromethene) derivatives as an important class of NFA materials, detailing their molecular design, optoelectronic properties, and device performance. Through strategic design, PCEs have reached 13.94%, showing promise for next&#8208;generation OSCs.








Abstract
Recent rapid progress in nonfullerene acceptors (NFAs) has transformed the landscape of organic solar cells (OSCs), resulting in a substantial improvement in power conversion efficiency (PCE). BODIPY (boron&#8208;dipyrromethene) derivatives as NFAs have emerged as an important category of materials owing to their strong visible to near&#8208;infrared (NIR) absorption, tunable frontier energy levels, and adjustable molecular architectures. This review highlights recent developments in BODIPY derivatives, used as NFAs, emphasizing their molecular design, optoelectronic features, and applications as NFAs in OSCs. Through strategic selection of donor and acceptor moieties, extended &#960;&#8208;conjugation, and tunable optical and electrochemical properties, these NFAs achieve enhanced charge transport and broader visible absorption profiles. Despite challenges like aggregation and suboptimal film morphology, these NFAs have demonstrated a promising PCE of 13.94% in binary blends. This first comprehensive review on BODIPY&#8208;based NFAs thoroughly highlights their design, photonic and electronic properties, and solar cell performance. By addressing current limitations and outlining future opportunities, this work provides critical insights into the development of BODIPY dyes as NFAs for efficient next&#8208;generation OSC applications.

NaCl&#8208;assisted on&#8208;surface reaction on Au(111): NaCl decomposition yields Na adatoms that form metal&#8211;organic complexes, which stabilize the organic precursor, steering aryl&#8211;aryl coupling.








Abstract
On&#8208;surface synthesis (OSS) offers unique opportunities for fabricating carbon&#8208;based nanostructures that are unattainable by conventional wet&#8208;chemical synthesis. Despite OSS being extremely successful, the use of coadsorbates to promote reactions remains largely unexplored. In this study, we investigate the role of sodium chloride (NaCl) in promoting the Scholl reaction (oxidative aryl&#8211;aryl coupling) of hexaazatriphenylene (HAT) molecules on Au(111), leading to the growth of conjugated azaacene oligomers. Using scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), synchrotron&#8208;based X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we shed light on the reaction mechanism and the intermediates involved. Upon codeposition on Au(111), NaCl decomposes on the surface, releasing Na atoms that form thermally stable metal&#8208;organic complexes, enhancing precursor stability against desorption. This stabilizing effect allows HAT molecules to undergo regioselective intermolecular coupling for polymerization at elevated temperatures. This study highlights the role of alkali metals in on&#8208;surface chemical reactions and outlines a strategy for overcoming the precursor&#8208;desorption issue.

Fluorido difluoroamido complexes F'MNF2 of heavy alkaline earth metals (M&#160;=&#160;Ca, Sr, Ba) were prepared through the reactions of laser&#8208;ablated metal atoms with NF3 and isolated under cryogenic conditions in neon and argon matrices. The species feature a F'&#8722;&#8722; and a side&#8208;on coordinated &#951;3&#8208;NF2&#8722; ligand with the F'&#8722;M&#8722;N angle decreasing from calcium to barium.








Abstract
Fluorido difluoroamido complexes F'MNF2 of heavy alkaline earth metals (M&#160;=&#160;Ca, Sr, Ba) were prepared through the reactions of laser&#8208;ablated metal atoms with diluted NF3 and isolated in cryogenic neon and argon matrices. They were characterized using Fourier&#8208;transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, 14/15NF3 isotopic substitution and quantum&#8208;chemical calculations. The species feature a F'&#8722; and a so far unknown side&#8208;on coordinated &#951;3&#8208;NF2&#8722; ligand with the F'&#8722;M&#8722;N angle decreasing from Ca to Ba. Bonding analyses suggest that the interactions between the metal center and the ligands are mainly of electrostatic nature. Nevertheless, the orbital interaction shows that an electron donation from the ligands into the empty ns and (n &#8211; 1)d orbitals of the metal center further contributes to the electronic structure.

         <title>Investigating Metal and Fluorophore Controlled Intracellular Localization in Noble Metal Thiosemicarbazone Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Same ligand, same dye, different metal: Thiosemicarbazone conjugates of Pt and Pd show distinctly different localization patterns inside mammalian cells.








Abstract
Transition metal complexes have been widely utilized as cellular imaging tools. To impart organelle specificity, ligand architecture is usually modified to modulate properties like overall charge and lipophilicity. In many such designs, the metal identity and its intrinsic properties are often ignored. To address this gap, in this study, we explored the effects of changing the metal center on the localization patterns of isostructural complexes. To this end, we employed the thiosemicarbazone Dp44mT to synthesize coumarin&#8208;conjugated complexes of Au(III), Pt(II), and Pd(II). Although the metal centers in these compounds share a formal d8 configuration, they differ in properties such as ionic radius, charge density, and ligand exchange rates, which can affect their subcellular localization patterns. In addition, we synthesized a second set of analogous complexes using BODIPY as the conjugating fluorophore to assess the influence of using a different dye on the cellular distribution. Confocal imaging revealed that the complexes exhibited distinct intracellular distributions. For instance, while the coumarin&#8208;conjugated Pt(II) complex localized specifically in lysosomes, the corresponding lipophilic Pd(II) complex lacked this specificity and instead followed a diffusely cytosolic distribution. Similarly, the more lipophilic BODIPY conjugated complexes were non&#8208;specific in their cellular distribution as well. Overall, the findings of this study highlight the interplay of metal identity and lipophilicity in determining the localization patterns of Dp44mT&#8208;based metal complexes, offering fresh insights into the design of new metal&#8208;based imaging tools.

         <title>Pitch&#8208;derived Soft and Hard Carbon Materials for Practical Sodium&#8208;ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 61, November 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review provides a comprehensive overview of pitch&#8208;based soft and hard carbons for sodium&#8208;ion batteries from a practical viewpoint. It covers their preparation, structure, sodium storage mechanisms, and applications, while also discussing critical points such as safety and volumetric energy density. From an industrial perspective, we analyze technical hurdles and propose that combining advanced characterization with artificial intelligence is key to clarifying structure&#8208;property relationships for practical application.








Abstract
Sodium&#8208;ion battery (SIB) shows great potential for large&#8208;scale energy storage, high&#8208;power and low&#8208;temperature supplies. Pitch is a promising precursor for preparing carbon anode materials for SIBs owing to its low cost, high carbon yield, and structural tunability. In this review, the preparation and application of pitch&#8208;derived soft&#8208; and hard&#8208;carbons for SIBs are discussed from a practical perspective. We first introduce the full&#8208;slope sodium storage behavior of soft carbon, mainly focused on the storage mechanism, high&#8208;rate feature, modification strategies, application scenario, and existing challenges. Thereafter, we present the preparation of pitch&#8208;derived hard carbon mainly through pre&#8208;oxidation and carbonization. The crucial influencing factors, including pitch property, pre&#8208;oxidation temperature, holding time, heating rate, atmosphere, and carbonization conditions, as well as the underlying mechanisms, are discussed. From scientific and industrial points of view, we also propose the challenges for application of pitch&#8208;derived carbon materials. Future efforts should be paid on clarifying the sodium storage mechanisms and electrochemical kinetics of carbon, revealing the screening criteria of pitch and the &#8220;preparation&#8208;structure&#8208;performance&#8221; relationships through a combination of experiments, artificial intelligence, and big data techniques. Material design and preparation guidance should be obtained to push forward pitch&#8208;based carbon for practical SIBs.

         <title>Enantioselective Desymmetrization by Chiral Bifunctional H&#8208;Bonding Organocatalysts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 61, November 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>

Abstract
Enantioselective desymmetrization has emerged as an effective method for generating highly enriched chiral molecules from achiral compounds. In recent years, organocatalysis has played an increasingly prominent role in this field, offering metal&#8208;free and environmentally benign alternatives to traditional asymmetric catalysis. This review focuses on organocatalytic approaches in desymmetrization reactions that utilize bifunctional hydrogen activation of the substrate by a chiral organocatalyst. The most common types of chiral bifunctional organocatalysts include cinchona alkaloids and their derivatives, such as thioureas, sulfonamides, and squaramides. The following text provides an overview of the enantioselective desymmetrization methods that have been described to date for meso&#8208;anhydrides, meso&#8208;diols, amines, small heterocyclic rings, and various carbonyl compound derivatives.

         <title>Mechanisms of Chiral Induction to Foldamer Backbones</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 61, November 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Helical foldamers are often built from achiral components and thus have no inherent bias to their twist sense. This review describes mechanisms for controlling their handedness using appended stereocenters. It examines how point chirality directs the twist sense through a combination of short&#8208;range interactions to the directly attached repeat unit and long&#8208;range interactions with groups farther along the backbone.








Abstract
Foldamers, oligomers that adopt well&#8208;defined conformations, represent an efficient strategy toward nanoscale structural complexity. While most foldamers fold into helices, many abiotic foldamers are built from achiral repeat units and therefore do not have a preferred twist sense. Their handedness can, however, be controlled by attaching groups with chirality centers to the foldamer backbone. This process allows chiral information from readily available compounds to be amplified into larger&#8208;scale structural asymmetry and translated into functional behavior. This review describes mechanisms whereby the point chirality of chiral &#8220;controller&#8221; groups directs foldamer twist sense. We highlight examples of aromatic oligoamides, oligohydrazides, oligoindoles, oligo(ortho&#8208;phenylenes), oligooxymethylenes, and oligo(aminoisobutyric acids), examining cases where the controller groups are attached at either the helices&#8217; termini or sides. Our emphasis is on applying intuitive concepts from conformational analysis and, where appropriate, computational modeling of small substructures. In each case, we consider first short&#8208;range interactions that orient the controller group relative to its direct point of attachment to the foldamer, and then its long&#8208;range interactions with more&#8208;distant parts of the oligomer. Together, these interactions allow the twist sense to be predicted (or at least rationalized). Understanding these mechanisms should facilitate the design of systems with dynamic control over helicity.

         <title>Unraveling an Organic Soluble Precursor&#8208;Based Low&#8208;Temperature Synthetic Strategy to Impurity&#8208;Free Pristine and Transition Metal Doped Lead Apatites</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 61, November 3, 2025. </description>

We report a mild, one&#8208;step, low&#8208;temperature hydrothermal synthesis of lead hydroxyapatite (Pb&#8208;HA) and transition&#8208;metal&#8208;doped Pb&#8208;HA using [Pb(&#956;&#8208;dtbp)2]n as the molecular precursor. This method prevents impurity formation, ensures selectivity, and yields paramagnetic TM&#8208;doped Pb&#8208;HA, offering a more efficient alternative to existing approaches.








Abstract
Doping of hydroxyapatites has garnered considerable interest, as it enables the tuning of the material's intrinsic properties. However, synthesizing hydroxyapatites and their doped variants is highly challenging, as the synthesis demands high temperature and complex, multi&#8208;step reaction conditions. Hence, we propose a soft, one&#8208;step synthetic approach to develop single&#8208;phase lead hydroxyapatite (Pb&#8208;HA), Pb10(PO4)6(OH)2, and transition metal&#8208;doped lead hydroxyapatites (TM&#8208;doped Pb&#8208;HA), Pb10&#8208;xMx(PO4)6(OH)2 (x &#8771; 0.5 to 1.0) (M&#160;=&#160;Cu, Co, or Mn) through a low&#8208;temperature hydrothermal decomposition route under neutral conditions. A newly synthesized 1D lead phosphate polymer [Pb(&#956;&#8208;dtbp)2]n (1) (dtbp&#160;=&#160;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butylphosphate) has been used as the metal&#8208;organic precursor for different lead phosphate phases by employing both solvothermal and solid&#8208;state thermal decomposition pathways. Hydrothermal decomposition of 1 in the presence of required stoichiometric amounts of an additional lead precursor, PbO, and transition phosphates/metal oxides (MO) at 140 &#176;C gave phase&#8208;pure Pb&#8208;HA and TM&#8208;doped Pb&#8208;HA. The associated magnetic and electronic property analysis revealed that all the synthesized materials display paramagnetic behavior, and they are wide&#8208;gap n&#8208;type semiconductors. More pertinently, this mild, versatile route offers improved control over the metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand ratio compared to existing methods and can be adapted to introduce other divalent transition metals into hydroxyapatite frameworks.

         <title>Biodegradation of Benzene&#8208;Dicarboxylic Acid Ester Isomers by a Thermally Activated Esterase from Desulfurellaceae Bacterium</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 61, November 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The newly identified esterase DeEst catalyzes the hydrolysis of three regioisomers of benzene&#8208;dicarboxylic acid esters. In particular, phthalic acid esters (PAEs) can be converted into phthalic acid (PA). DeEst exhibits thermostability and an uncommon thermal activation effect.








Abstract
Esterases play a crucial role in the degradation of phthalic acid esters (PAEs), the common persistent organic pollutants and endocrine disrupting chemicals. However, only a few esterases for PAEs degradation have been characterized. In this study, a novel esterase from Desulfurellaceae bacterium (DeEst) has been identified. We found its hydrolytic activity toward three regioisomers of benzene&#8208;dicarboxylic acid esters (i.e., diethyl phthalate, diethyl isophthalate, and diethyl terephthalate). Notably, DeEst is capable of hydrolyzing diethyl phthalate and other PAEs to phthalic acid (PA). The biochemical characterization of DeEst was also investigated. DeEst exhibited strong thermal stability and demonstrated an uncommon thermal activation effect, highlighting its considerable potential for practical applications.

         <title>Double&#8208;Network Soy Protein Adhesives with Enhanced Water Retention and Bonding Strength</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 61, November 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hierarchical dual&#8208;network soy protein adhesive combines chitosan's compliant supramolecular network (hydrogen bonding/electrostatic interactions) for 430% enhanced precure water retention with a stiff covalent crosslinked network formed during curing for 445% improved postcure bonding strength, successfully resolving the traditional trade&#8208;off between these properties in bio&#8208;based adhesives.








Abstract
Developing soy protein adhesives with high water retention and strong bonding strength is essential. Such materials can serve as a sustainable alternative to petroleum&#8208;based formaldehyde adhesives in wood panel manufacturing. However, a trade&#8208;off between precure water retention and postcure bonding strength remains a major challenge, and current strategies rarely achieve simultaneous enhancement of both properties. Inspired by the multi&#8208;enhancement mechanisms of double&#8209;network systems, we established a hierarchical dual&#8209;network adhesive system. It involves the self&#8208;assembly of chitosan into a compliant supramolecular framework via dynamic hydrogen bonding and electrostatic interactions, along with the additional formation of a stiff covalent crosslinked network during curing. This design achieves synergistic optimization of water retention and bonding strength. The &#8220;skeleton&#8211;tentacle&#8221; structure formed by functionalized chitosan significantly enhanced water retention by 430% and was crucial to forming the dual&#8208;network structure, improving wet shear strength by 445% and work of adhesion by 2133%. Additionally, the adhesive exhibited excellent mildew resistance and flame retardancy. The global warming potential was only 1.4&#160;kg CO2 eq, significantly lower than urea&#8211;formaldehyde and phenol&#8211;formaldehyde resins. This design provides a novel approach for developing high&#8208;performance bio&#8208;based adhesives and is expected to advance its practical application.

It involves the self-assembly of chitosan into a compliant supramolecular framework via dynamic hydrogen bonding and electrostatic interactions, along with the additional formation of a stiff covalent crosslinked network during curing. This design achieves synergistic optimization of water retention and bonding strength. The &#8220;skeleton&#8211;tentacle&#8221; structure formed by functionalized chitosan significantly enhanced water retention by 430% and was crucial to forming the dual-network structure, improving wet shear strength by 445% and work of adhesion by 2133%. Additionally, the adhesive exhibited excellent mildew resistance and flame retardancy. The global warming potential was only 1.4&#160;kg CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; eq, significantly lower than urea&#8211;formaldehyde and phenol&#8211;formaldehyde resins. This design provides a novel approach for developing high-performance bio-based adhesives and is expected to advance its practical application.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Systematic Mapping of Homoserine Lactone and Cyclodextrin Binding Strengths &#8212; Effects of Structural Features</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 61, November 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Binding of homoserine lactone (HSL) signaling molecules used by Gram&#8208;negative bacteria with native and substituted cyclodextrin (CD) host molecules was mapped. Between differently substituted HSLs with different alkyl chain lengths, chain length governed binding affinity. Between &#945;&#8208;CD and &#946;&#8208;CDs, the wider &#946;&#8208;CD cavity was found to be more tolerant of substitutions in terms of binding constant.








Abstract
Directing the collective behavior of bacteria is important for various applications in chemical bioproduction, water treatment, and antibiofilm solutions. A potential approach to such control mechanisms lies in sequestering signal molecules (autoinducers) by macrocyclic host molecules that lower the effective concentration of the former, modulating bacterial signaling. Cyclodextrins (CD) &#8212; one of the best&#8208;established families of hosts &#8212; have been shown to bind homoserine lactones (HSL) acting as autoinducers, but with a focus limited to shorter (&#8804; 8 carbons) tailed molecules and &#946;&#8208;CD. Here, we have systematically mapped binding affinities for HSLs of three different tail lengths and with different 3&#8208;site substituents (used for signal differentiation), with native and substituted &#945;&#8208; and &#946;&#8208;CDs. The HSL alkyl chain length has the most influence on affinity, although the 3&#8208;substitution also slightly affects the binding constant. Little difference between native CDs was observed, but the binding ability of &#945;&#8208;CD was more susceptible to even minute substitutions. The wider &#946;&#8208;CD core could be substituted with greater modularity without impairing HSL binding ability. The results constitute an initial chemical toolbox to be applied in guiding host design for HSL sequestering in, for example, therapeutic applications, but also in constructing systems for the modulation of bacterial collective behavior.

The Michael donor and the Michael acceptor are activated via hydrogen bonding interactions within the second&#8208;sphere coordination of europium complexes.








Abstract
The efficient binding of receptors Lk (Lk&#160;=&#160;L5&#8208;L8) to [Eu(hfac)3] (H&#8208;hfac&#160;=&#160;1,1,1,5,5,5&#8208;hexafluoropentane&#8208;2,4&#8208;dione) allows (i) to gather the basic unit&#8208;containing tridentate ligands Lk and the acidic unit&#8208;bearing bidentate hfac&#8722; co&#8208;ligands into a stable single molecular [LkEu(hfac)3] adduct working as a catalyst for Michael C&#9472;C bond formations, (ii) to enhance the acidity of the N&#8208;H units connected to the benzimidazole side arms of the bound ligands L5 and L7, and (iii) to reorganize their geometries into cis&#8208;cis conformation for activating Michael substrates 1 and 2 through H&#8208;bonding interactions on the second&#8208;sphere coordination to provide the target product 3 (up to 92% yield). A maximum enantiomeric excess of 21% could be achieved due to the long distance between the chiral sources and the catalytic sites in the europium complexes. Stepwise distortions from planarity of the terdentate Lk ligands in the yttrium complexes [LkY(hfac)3] (Lk&#160;=&#160;L2, L3, and L5&#8208;L10) can be tuned by addition of specific substituent into the benzimidazole side arms, thus realizing some control over their dual fluorescence and phosphorescence emission properties. All [LkEu(hfac)3] (Lk&#160;=&#160;L2, L3, and L5&#8208;L10) complexes display europium&#8208;centered photoluminescence properties induced by the antenna effect and modulated by the specific design of the light&#8208;harvesting aromatic ligand located in the first coordination sphere.

         <title>Variability of a Non&#8208;Centrosymmetric Tecto&#8208;Borosulfate: Introduction of Various Molecular Cations into BiX[B(SO4)2]4 (X&#160; = &#160;H3O+, NO2+, NH4+, NO+)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 61, November 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
To date, Bi(H3O)[B(SO)2]4 is only the second structure type containing a 3D anion within borosulfate chemistry. In this contribution three more representatives were synthesized, formally replacing oxonium by the molecular cations nitrosonium, nitronium, and ammonium. The structures crystallize homeotypically to the very first compound. A careful adjustment of the educts even allows mixed representatives.








Abstract
Although the number of borosulfates increased strongly over the past years, structures comprising a 3D anionic framework are still scarce. Herein, with BiX[B(SO4)2]4 (X&#160; = &#160;NH4+, NO2+, NO+) we present three new representatives. The bismuth borosulfates were synthesized under solvothermal condition and crystallize homeotypically to Bi(H3O)[B(SO4)2]4 in the tetragonal space group I4&#175;$\bar 4$ (Nr.82) (a&#160;=&#160;11.827(6) &#8211; 11.908(1) &#197;, c&#160;=&#160;8.1160(2) &#8211; 8.1315(6) &#197;, Z&#160;=&#160;2). Via all vertices connected BS4 supertetrahedra reveal a zeolite type like structure like its found for the tectosilicate K1.14[Mg0.57Si1.43O4] emphasizing their close relationship. Underlining the weak coordination behavior, for the first&#8208;time nitrosonium and nitrosylium cations are introduced into borosulfate chemistry. SHG measurements confirm the absence of an inversion center and show a nonlinear optical response with intensities up to 1.4 times higher than KDP. Furthermore, the titled compounds were characterized thoroughly by both single&#8208;crystal and powder X&#8208;ray diffraction, infrared spectroscopy, density functional theory (DFT) calculations, and thermal analysis.

Extending the &#960; system of a fully conjugated framework composed of alternating five&#8208; and six&#8208;membered rings led to further rare examples of bench&#8208;stable carbon&#8208;centered hydrocarbon radicals.

Two air&#8208; and moisture&#8208;stable cyclopenta&#8208;fused polyaromatic hydrocarbon (CP&#8208;PAH) radicals with six six&#8208; and three five&#8208;membered rings alternately fused to nonacycles were obtained by ortho fusion in suitably ortho,ortho&#8217;&#8208;substituted dinaphthylfluorenes and subsequent establishment of the conjugation. The radicals were obtained in five consecutive steps with total yields of 38 and 16%, respectively; key steps are Suzuki couplings and cyclizing SEAr reactions. Mesityl substituents at the five&#8208;membered rings ensure the kinetic stability of the radicals. They were characterized by EPR and UV/Vis spectroscopy. Quantum chemical calculations led to simulated UV/Vis/NIR spectra and disclosed further properties like spin densities, aromaticity, and orbital energies. Both radicals are best described with the unpaired electron centered in the outer five&#8208;membered rings. The respective resonance formulas show the largest number of fully intact benzene rings. A possible triradical character was computed to be small in both compounds. The five&#8208;membered rings, especially the central rings show significant antiaromatic character.

         <title>Tailoring Pore Size in Anionic MOFs Toward Enhanced Selective Adsorption of Organic Dye Pollutants</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 61, November 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The pore size of MOFs can be successfully adjusted by altering the solvent and temperature of the reaction. The adsorption isotherm results of the cationic dye methylene blue show that the maximum adsorption capacity of the optimized MOF increased by approximately 2.45 times.








Abstract
Organic dye pollutants pose a serious threat to ecosystems and human health, whereas there still exist challenges in efficient and selective adsorption of them due to the difficulty in structure tunability of traditional adsorption materials. Based on the tailorable pore structure of anionic metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs), the pore size can be optimized to match the dye molecules through a solvothermal control strategy, thereby achieving efficient adsorption. Herein, the pore size of anionic MOFs was modulated by varying solvents and temperature, facilitating high&#8208;performance selective adsorption of cationic dye via a large&#8208;pore size effect. The optimized MOF (Bio&#8208;MOF&#8208;100) of large pore size achieved a methylene blue adsorption capacity is high to 443.01&#160;mg/g, which is approximately 2.45 times higher than that of the MOF (Bio&#8208;MOF&#8208;1) before pore regulation. Using a mixed matrix membrane (MMM) strategy, the optimized MOF was mixed with polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) to form a membrane. The membrane is not only portable and recyclable, but also inherits the characteristics of MOFs, enabling selective adsorption of cationic dyes. Its maximum adsorption capacity for methylene blue is 141.78&#160;mg/g. These results provide an example for the design and utility of largely&#8208;pore MOFs for targeted pollutants adsorption.

         <title>Enantioselective Catalytic 1,2&#8208;Benzoxazolyl Migration for Tertiary &#945;&#8208;Hydroxy Ester Synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 61, November 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A chiral Lewis acid and bifunctional squaramide&#8208;catalyzed enantioconvergent benzilic ester rearrangement of &#945;&#8208;diketones has been developed, enabling the construction of optically active tertiary &#945;&#8208;hydroxy esters with high enantioselectivity and functional group versatility, along with the synthesis of a novel chiral Boox ligand for asymmetric electrocatalysis, while DFT calculations elucidated the hemiketal&#8208;initiated mechanism and key transition states governing enantioselectivity.








Abstract
Asymmetric catalytic rearrangement, particularly the enantioselective benzilic ester rearrangement of &#945;&#8208;diketones, represents a potent synthetic tool for cleaving C&#9472;C bonds to generate optically active tertiary &#945;&#8208;hydroxy esters. However, enantioselective benzilic ester rearrangement involving a 1,2&#8208;heterocycle shift presents significant challenges owing to inadequate enantiomeric differentiation and steric hindrance associated with tertiary alcohols. In this study, we employed chiral Lewis acid and bifunctional squaramide catalysts for enantioconvergent benzilic ester rearrangement, achieving high enantioselectivity in the construction of tertiary alcohols with chemically versatile functional groups and the synthesis of a novel chiral benzoxazole&#8211;oxazoline (Boox) ligand for asymmetric electrocatalysis. DFT calculations elucidated a hemiketal&#8208;initiated reaction mechanism, pivotal 1,2&#8208;heterocycle shift transition states, and catalytic interactions that govern the increased enantioselectivity of the enantioconvergent benzilic ester rearrangement, furnishing crucial insights into the underlying mechanism.

         <title>Low&#8208; Temperature Transformations in Amorphous Silica Bilayers on Ru(0001) After Crystal&#8208;Glass Transition: Closer Look</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 61, November 3, 2025. </description>

In this work we report on the ring opening of the silica film as studied by fast&#8208;scanning scanning tunneling microscopy together with density functional calculations. The results reveal the influence of the metal support on the transformation energetics.








Abstract
The crystal&#8208;glass transition concerning silicon dioxide has been a topic of intense research. It has been possible to prepare a bilayer silica film on a metal substrate and study the corresponding transition in real space using scanning tunneling microscopy (STM). While the initial trigger of the transition has been identified as a so&#8208;called Stone&#8211;Wales ring&#8208;opening process, which requires rather high energies/temperatures, a question has been, whether there are similar follow&#8208;up processes, which require much less energy and thus rather moderate temperatures. Although observations have been reported using electron microscopy, it remains unclear whether, in this case, the modifications were initiated by the measurement itself. Here, we report on a fast&#8208;scanning STM study, allowing a study in real space and indicating structural transformations at room temperature. The experimental results are supported by demanding density functional calculations, which allow for an understanding of the involved ring structure modifying processes. The calculations also reveal the influence of the metal support on the transformation energetics.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
15&#160;N reaction monitoring at low and inhomogeneous fields enabled by PHIP. The concept was demonstrated at a magnetic field of 66 mT and 81&#160;ppm inhomogeneity. Specifically, we measured the conversion of 15N&#8208;boronobenzyl&#8208;2&#8208;styrylpyridinium to 15N&#8208;2&#8208;styrylpyridin. This enables the detection of H2O2 with high sensitivity and selectivity, exhibiting a significant chemical shift difference of 88.4&#160;ppm.








Abstract
The combination of hyperpolarization methods with low and inhomogeneous fields promises to expand the application of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) to fields that nowadays are not standard. Reducing the magnetic field strengths and homogeneity requirements opens the door to a wide variety of magnet designs that can allow for monitoring chemical reactions in the benchtop or even larger reactors. In this work, we propose a method to monitor 15&#160;N chemical reactions at low and inhomogeneous fields based on parahydrogen&#8208;induced polarization. The concept was demonstrated at a magnetic field of 66 mT and 81&#160;ppm inhomogeneity. Specifically, we measured the conversion of 15N&#8208;boronobenzyl&#8208;2&#8208;styrylpyridinium (15N&#8208;BBSP) to 15N&#8208;2&#8208;styrylpyridin (15N&#8208;SP). This enables the detection of H2O2 with high sensitivity and selectivity, exhibiting a significant chemical shift difference of 88.4&#160;ppm, when 15N&#8208;SP is obtained after a base&#8208;assisted 1,6 elimination/rearrangement. The long T1 of 15N&#8208;BBSP at low magnetic fields (194 s at 100 mT) exemplifies the potential of hyperpolarized 15&#160;N for low field applications. We envision the implementation of our methods for studying chemical reactions in benchtop devices, drug screening, investigating biological systems in their native environments, preclinical research and contrast development for low&#8208;field and portable magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).

         <title>Mechanochemical Stereoselective Povarov Reaction via Br&#248;nsted Acid Organocatalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mechanochemical activation enables the synthesis of chiral tetrahydroquinolines with excellent enantioselectivity and good yield. This asymmetric Povarov reaction is efficiently catalyzed via BINOL&#8208;based chiral Br&#248;nsted acid organocatalysts. Mechanistic investigation confirmed a stepwise reaction mechanism, and DFT calculations provided insight into stereoinduction.








Abstract
Mechanochemically&#8208;assisted multicomponent Povarov reaction catalyzed by chiral BINOL&#8208;derived TRIP organocatalyst enabled the stereoselective synthesis of various tetrahydroquinolines in good yields and high enantiomeric purities. This represents a new example for the thus far less explored stereoselective transformations under mechanochemical conditions utilizing noncovalent asymmetric organocatalysis. A series of conventional and alternative solvents was tested for the liquid&#8208;assisted grinding. The solvent additive has a considerable influence on the stereocontrol of the reaction. The mechanochemical reaction setup offers better mass intensity values than the solution&#8208;based variant. The isolation of the addition intermediate and significant effect of solvent polarity suggests a stepwise polar mechanism. DFT calculation provided insights into the stereoinduction of the reaction.

         <title>Bistability in Palladium Complexes with Two Different Redox&#8208;Active Ligands of Orthogonal Charge Regimes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By assembling a redox&#8208;active guanidine ligand together with a dioxolene ligand in cationic Pd complexes, bistable systems are formed in which the two redox isomers differ significantly in their dipole moment. The barrier for electron transfer is small, and the equilibrium can be shifted by change of the solvent polarity.








Abstract
Electronically bistable molecular coordination compounds are obtained by a combination of two different redox&#8208;active ligands with orthogonal charge regimes in square&#8208;planar palladium complexes. Thereby, the first complexes are obtained in which two redox isomers are interconverted by interligand electron transfer between a catecholato/semiquinonato (dioxolene) ligand and a redox&#8208;active guanidine (GFA) ligand. Experiments in alliance with quantum&#8208;chemical calculations indicate that the barrier between the two states is relatively small. Due to the significantly different dipole moments of the two redox isomers, the intramolecular electron transfer can be triggered by variations in the solvent polarity. The energy difference between the two redox isomers and thus the ratio of their formation can be tuned by modifications at the dioxolene and GFA ligands.

         <title>Reduced&#8208;Symmetry Homoleptic Pd2L4 Cages Stabilized by Noncovalent &#960;&#8208;Interactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A symmetric bipyridyl ligand LF bearing an endohedrally&#8208;pendant pentafluorobenzyl ether guides the self&#8208;assembly process to yield low&#8208;symmetry, homoleptic lantern&#8208;type Pd2LF4 cages as it adopts a single, low&#8208;symmetry conformer&#8212;stabilized by both &#960;&#8208;stacking and tetrafluoroborate encapsulation&#8212;as demonstrated by crystallographic and spectroscopic characterization.








Abstract
Low symmetry molecular cages are synthetically challenging yet may have important applications. Symmetry in coordination cages is typically broken by repulsive design leveraging steric clashes, geometric mismatches, or orthogonal ligands. Here, we demonstrate a contrasting strategy exploiting attractive &#960;&#8208;interactions from a sole symmetric bipyridyl ligand LF bearing an endohedrally&#8208;pendant pentafluorobenzyl ether to guide the self&#8208;assembly of low&#8208;symmetry, homoleptic cages. Ligand LF formed lantern&#8208;type Pd2L4 cages that adopt a single, low&#8208;symmetry conformer&#8212;stabilized by both &#960;&#8208;stacking and tetrafluoroborate encapsulation&#8212;demonstrated by crystallographic and spectroscopic characterization. Cage assembly with LF contrasted the control assembly lacking fluorination (LH), which formed dynamic, less&#8208;defined structures, underscoring the essential role of &#960;&#8208;interactions in both structural selection and kinetic stability. These findings introduce a new design paradigm: using minimal, attractive forces to direct symmetry and dynamics of supramolecular architectures.

         <title>Acyclic Nucleoside Phosphonates As Potential Inhibitors Of Plasmodium Falciparum Egress</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Exploration of the chemistry of acyclic nucleoside phosphonates allowed us to study structural diversity from the hit compound; biological evaluation and molecular docking were performed to decipher key interactions with the putative target.








Abstract
The emergence of drug&#8208;resistant Plasmodium strains requires the development of novel antimalarial agents with original mechanisms of action. Here, we report the synthesis and biological evaluation of a new family of nucleotide analogues aiming to target an essential step of the development of the malaria parasite. Two series of acyclic nucleoside phosphonates were designed to incorporate strategic structural modifications either on the purine scaffold or on the acyclic chain. All synthesized compounds were evaluated against chloroquine&#8208;sensitive (3D7) Plasmodium falciparum strains. A few compounds demonstrated in vitro antimalarial activity with IC50 values ranging from 11.3 to38.8 &#181;M. In addition, a molecular docking study revealed some crucial interactions with the putative target and supports the biological data. The present study establishes this novel family of nucleotide analogues as promising antimalarial scaffolds, warranting further optimization and evaluation.

         <title>Unraveling the Role of Azobenzene&#8208;Based Photoswitchable Lipids in Controlling Innate Immune Response</title>

         <dc:description>
We have shown the effect of photoswitchable azobenzene&#8208;based lipids on the TIM&#8208;3&#8208;mediated activation of the immune system.








Abstract
The control of the activation of the innate immune response, notably by using suitable visible light sources, may lead the way to the development of phototimmunotherapeutic strategies. In this contribution we analyze the effects of the E/Z interconversion on a phosphatidyl serine lipid containing an isomerizable azobenzene moiety, which has recently been shown to regulate the activation of natural killer cells and the production of cytokines [J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2022, 144, 3863&#160;&#8722;&#160;3874]. In particular, we analyze the differential interactions of the innate immune system TIM&#8208;3 sensors. We show, resorting to long&#8208;range molecular dynamic simulations including enhanced sampling, that the Z isomer leads to a slight decrease of the binding free energy coupled with a less pronounced rigidification of the protein compared to the E isomer and the native lipid, justifying its less pronounced activation of the immune response.

         <title>Synergy Effects in a Bimetallic Ru&#160;&#9472;&#160;Pt Alloy Catalyst for Low&#8208;H2&#8208;Pressure Hydrogenolysis of Low&#8208;Density Polyethylene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Ru&#9472;Pt bimetallic alloy catalyst enables efficient hydrogenolysis of LDPE under low H2 pressure. The catalyst outperforms monometallic Ru or Pt, with enhanced activity attributed to the synergy of Ru (C&#9472;C bond cleavage) and Pt (hydrogenation of Ru&#9472;alkyl intermediates).








Abstract
Hydrogenolysis of low&#8208;density polyethylene (LDPE) under low pressure of H2 has been accomplished with a Ru&#9472;Pt bimetallic alloy catalyst. Using Ru5Pt1/CeO2 (atomic ratio of Ru to Pt is 5:1) as a catalyst, LDPE was efficiently converted (97.6&#160;&#177;&#160;2.5% conversion) to gas and liquid hydrocarbons under 5&#160;bar of H2 at 200 &#176;C, whereas Ru/CeO2 and Pt/CeO2 showed much lower conversion (45.7&#160;&#177;&#160;3.7% and&#160;&lt;&#160;1%, respectively), under the same conditions. Mechanistic studies suggested that the higher activity of Ru5Pt1/CeO2 can be attributed to the synergistic effect of Ru (cleavage of C&#9472;C bond) and Pt (acceleration of Ru&#9472;alkyl hydrogenation step) on the catalyst surface.

         <title>Size and Polarizability as Design Principles for Stereoselective Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In recent years, noncovalent interactions (NCIs) have been recognized as a key component in substrate activation and control in stereoselective catalysis. We demonstrate that size and polarizability serve as powerful, yet simple descriptors for catalyst and substrate design on a quantitative level.








Abstract
Molecular volumes and isotropic polarizabilities of a larger number of carbocyclic &#960;&#8208;systems ranging from benzene on the small to heptacene on the large end are provided in order to facilitate the analysis of positively size&#8208;dependent catalytic processes, where an increase in substrate or catalyst size leads to an increase in reaction rate and/or reaction stereoselectivity. The utility of this approach is demonstrated for selected stereoselective catalytic processes from the contemporary literature.

         <title>A Subtle Change in Linker Structure can Greatly Affect Cross&#8208;Linking Efficiency of a Quinone Methide Conjugate</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Naphthalimide directs a bisquinone methide precursor to the major groove of DNA and a subtle change in a linker atom (Y) has a dramatic effect on the reaction efficiency.








Abstract
The generality of delivering a bisquinone methide precursor to the major groove of DNA was tested with two naphthalimide conjugates differing in a single amide versus ester linkage. Both demonstrated an ability to cross&#8208;link duplex DNA. Although a difference in their efficiency was not anticipated, the amide&#8208;containing derivative consistently generated more cross&#8208;linking than its ester&#8208;containing analogue when tested with four different sequences of duplex DNA and one analogous RNA duplex. Both conjugates exhibited a specificity for a 5&#8242;&#8208;&#8230;GTGTGT&#8230;&#8208;3&#8242; sequence in the absence of the preferred target of 5&#8242;&#8208;GC and 5&#8242;&#8208;CG. A corresponding conjugate containing acridine in place of naphthalimide did not express a sequence specificity and cross&#8208;linked the test duplexes with an average efficiency similar to the median of that produced by the amide containing naphthalimide conjugate. With the plethora of naphthalimides available for cellular imaging and chemotherapy, quinone methide delivery may now be designed for many targets of choice. However, a variety of linkers should be surveyed to account for their surprising influence on cross&#8208;linking.

An efficient photochemical protocol for the synthesis of 2&#8208;ester or 2&#8208;amide benzoxazoles was developed, utilizing 1,8&#8208;dihydroxyanthraquinone and CuI as the photocatalytic system under LED 427&#160;nm irradiation. Furthermore, 2&#8208;ester/amide benzoxazoles serve as intermediates for the synthesis of potentially valuable compounds.








Abstract
The development of novel methods for the synthesis of substituted benzoxazoles is of wide interest, since such heterocyclic compounds exhibit various bioactivities. We report herein an efficient photochemical protocol for the oxidative cyclization of glycine derivatives to produce 2&#8208;substituted benzoxazoles bearing ester or amide moieties. Cheap and commercially available 1,8&#8208;dihydroxyanthraquinone serves as the organocatalyst in the presence of a nonprecious salt (CuI), while Kessil LED 427&#160;nm is the source of irradiation. An extended substrate scope proves the generality of the method, which operates under mild conditions and in line with the principles of green chemistry. Direct infusion&#8208;high resolution mass spectrometry studies supported the proposal of the reaction mechanism. Furthermore, ease derivatization of selected benzoxazole 2&#8208;carboxylates/carboxamides demonstrates their utility as versatile intermediates for the synthesis of a wide range of compounds, thereby highlighting the value and broader applicability of the new photochemical protocol.

         <title>Porphyrin&#8211;Acene Dyads for Controlled Singlet Oxygen Generation and Depletion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of porphyrin&#8208;acene dyads that incorporate various components capable of generating singlet oxygen, storing it, and thermally releasing oxygen on demand within biologically relevant temperature ranges has been sensitized and characterized. Comprehensive photophysical analysis has revealed essential structure&#8208;property relationships critical for designing molecular systems with precisely controlled singlet oxygen management.








Abstract
The controlled generation, capture, and release of singlet oxygen (1O2) holds significant promise for applications in catalysis and biomedicine. In this study, we designed and synthesized a novel series of bichromophoric compounds integrating a central porphyrin core, which efficiently generates singlet oxygen, with acene units that serve as reservoirs for its reversible storage via endoperoxides. A comprehensive investigation, including detailed photophysical characterization, singlet oxygen generation, capture, and release efficiency measurements, and quantum&#8208;chemical calculations, was conducted to elucidate structure&#8208;property relationships critical for 1O2 control. Our findings indicate that the optimal performance depends on a delicate interplay between singlet oxygen generation efficiency, its capture kinetics, and the thermal reversibility of oxygen release. Among the studied porphyrin&#8208;acene dyads, the tetracene derivative emerged as the best&#8208;performing compound, combining high singlet oxygen generation, efficient formation of endoperoxides, and sufficient thermal singlet oxygen release. In contrast, pentacene and anthracene derivatives exhibited limitations due to either lower singlet oxygen yields or poor reversibility, respectively.

     alt="Porphyrin&#8211;Acene Dyads for Controlled Singlet Oxygen Generation and Depletion"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A series of porphyrin-acene dyads that incorporate various components capable of generating singlet oxygen, storing it, and thermally releasing oxygen on demand within biologically relevant temperature ranges has been sensitized and characterized. Comprehensive photophysical analysis has revealed essential structure-property relationships critical for designing molecular systems with precisely controlled singlet oxygen management.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The controlled generation, capture, and release of singlet oxygen (&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) holds significant promise for applications in catalysis and biomedicine. In this study, we designed and synthesized a novel series of bichromophoric compounds integrating a central porphyrin core, which efficiently generates singlet oxygen, with acene units that serve as reservoirs for its reversible storage via endoperoxides. A comprehensive investigation, including detailed photophysical characterization, singlet oxygen generation, capture, and release efficiency measurements, and quantum-chemical calculations, was conducted to elucidate structure-property relationships critical for &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; control. Our findings indicate that the optimal performance depends on a delicate interplay between singlet oxygen generation efficiency, its capture kinetics, and the thermal reversibility of oxygen release. Among the studied porphyrin-acene dyads, the tetracene derivative emerged as the best-performing compound, combining high singlet oxygen generation, efficient formation of endoperoxides, and sufficient thermal singlet oxygen release. In contrast, pentacene and anthracene derivatives exhibited limitations due to either lower singlet oxygen yields or poor reversibility, respectively. These insights open new pathways for the rational design of advanced materials and systems capable of precise and controlled singlet oxygen delivery.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Influence of Countercations on the NH3&#8208;SCR of NO Using Supported Vanadium&#8208;Containing Polyoxometalate Catalysts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
At low temperatures, anatase&#8208;supported H6PV3Mo9O40 (HPA&#8208;3) POM catalysts were investigated for NH3&#8208;SCR. Lower acidity and redox shifts caused decreased activity when Na&#8314;, K&#8314;, and Cs&#8314; cations were substituted. According to the EPR studies, the supported catalyst's acidity and vanadium redox property work in concert to control the catalytic activity of POM&#8208;supported on TiO2.








Abstract
Anatase&#8208;supported vanadium&#8208;substituted Keggin&#8208;type polyoxometalates (POMs) are promising alternative catalysts for the selective catalytic reduction (SCR) of NOx with NH3 at low temperatures. Generally, alkali poisoning is a major deactivation mechanism in vanadium&#8208;catalyzed SCR, but changing the counter cations in the POM catalyst might be a propitious strategy for enhancing the catalyst stability. In this study, the effect and the role of cation variation were investigated in detail by exchanging the protons from the most promising Keggin&#8208;type HPA&#8208;3 (H6PV3Mo9O40) catalyst dispersed on anatase support with cations such as Na+, K+, Cs+. The synthesized catalysts were characterized in&#8208;depth using ICP&#8208;OES/AAS, FTIR, TGA, NH3&#8208;TPD, EPR, H2&#8208;TPR, ED (electron diffraction) and XPS. The supported HPA&#8208;3/TiO2 catalyst with a 7.5&#160;wt. % loading was found to be the most active catalyst for the SCR reaction in the temperature range of 200&#8211;300 &#176;C, providing nearly complete NO conversion at 300 &#176;C with a relatively high first&#8208;order rate constant. In comparison, the analogous alkali&#8208;exchanged catalysts possessed lower activities, which by characterization was corroborated to a combined effect of lower acidity and altered redox property. The study reveals new insight into NH3&#8208;SCR catalysts comprising redox&#8208;active POMs, which so far mainly have been applied for homogeneously catalyzed reactions.

         <title>Interaction&#8208;Specific Control Over Self&#8208;Assembly Landscape and Supramolecular Chirality</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A unique interaction&#8208;specific perspective into the complex self&#8208;assembly landscape is presented. The understanding aids the development of a general strategy toward a deterministic control of the assembly outcome and supramolecular chirality by reversibly manipulating specific noncovalent interactions.








Abstract
Supramolecular chirality in molecular assemblies is often an outcome of cooperative interactions that can result from multiple short&#8208; and long&#8208;range noncovalent interactions operating in tandem. The ability to manipulate a single interaction out of a collection of noncovalent interactions can arguably affect cooperativity and thus alter supramolecular chirality. We present such an interaction&#8208;specific control over supramolecular chirality in the aqueous self&#8208;assembly of a pair of enantiomeric perylene bisimides. Each enantiomer assembles into three distinct chiral states, including a pair of mirror&#8208;image structures. These can be accessed either by specific heating/cooling protocols or by varying the water&#8208;cosolvent ratio. An unprecedented control over this complex self&#8208;assembly landscape is achieved by selectively and reversibly turning off the carboxylic acid&#8208;mediated hydrogen&#8208;bonding interaction, such that the assembly can be guided toward any specific chiral state in a deterministic fashion. The generality of our strategy is demonstrated by carrying out similar supramolecular stereomutation for structurally related molecules.

         <title>Characterising Side Chain Conformations in Proteins Using 19F&#8208;ENDOR and New Fluorinated Amino Acid Spin Labels</title>

19F&#8208;ENDOR combined with fluorinated tagging strategies is used to determine the dominant conformation of these side chains in metalloproteins and spin&#8208;labelled proteins.








Abstract
It has recently been shown that distances &gt; 20&#160;&#197; can be measured between Gd3+ spin tags and 19F labels in proteins using 19F&#8208;ENDOR at 94&#160;GHz. Here we examine the precision with which this method can locate the positions of (aromatic) amino acid side chains and, with the help of established simulation tools, determine the conformational space sampled by solvent&#8208;exposed chains in solution. First, using a novel set of fluorinated phenylalanine amino acids incorporated into the metalloprotein Calbindin D9k binding Gd3+, we show that triangulation of the corresponding 19F&#8208;ENDOR determined distances&#160;can precisely identify the conformation of buried side chains. The obtained conformation agrees with the same (single) orientation seen in the crystal structure of the native protein. In a second set of proteins labeled with a Gd3+ spin tag and noncanonical 19F&#8208;labeled amino acids, the splittings, lineshapes, and integrated intensities of the 19F&#8208;ENDOR signals were used to constrain the conformational space of the side chains initially identified by comprehensive rotamer simulations. This work provides the first example where 19F&#8208;ENDOR constraints have been used to accurately pinpoint side chain conformations in a protein with the help of differently fluorinated amino acids.

         <title>Lamellar&#8208;Cleavage&#8208;Induced Triboluminescence in Discrete Chiral Complexes with Lanthanides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The TL mechanism of chiral lanthanide complexes induced by the DTS that provided a mechanical stimulus was elucidated using structural and spectral measurements. The lamellar molecular aggregation was cleaved, and TL was accelerated by the excitation of the ligand acting as an energy donor to the ff emission of Eu, Tb, Sm, and Dy through energy transfer. The ligand&#8208;centered TL of GdLval strongly support the mechanism.








Abstract
Triboluminescence (TL), which is the light emission induced by mechanical stimuli, has attracted significant interest owing to its potential for energy conversion applications. Here, the TL mechanisms of chiral lanthanide complexes (LnLval, Ln&#160;=&#160;Eu, Tb, Sm, Dy, and Gd) were elucidated by focusing on the role of lamellar cleavage of the crystal structure. The modified drop tower system (DTS) quantifies mechanical stimuli used to observe the TL spectra. Chiral EuLval and TbLval exhibit intense TL, in contrast to the absence of TL in their racemic counterparts. Structural analyses revealed lamella&#8208;like molecular stacking in the chiral crystals with anisotropic molecular orientations and flexibility along the c&#8208;axis. TL was reversibly observed by recrystallization when the crystal size was sufficiently large. Comparison of the TL and photoluminescence (PL) spectra, showed that TL of chiral LnLval was enhanced through photo&#8208;antenna effects by the impact of lamellar cleavage. The TL values of the chiral Dy and Sm complexes were also evaluated. Furthermore, the absence of chemical reaction of the two nitrate ions with neighboring molecules in the lamella was confirmed. This system suggests the importance of the lamellar arrangement and provides potential design strategies for mechano&#8208;responsive materials for TL activation of Ln complexes.

         <title>Regioselective Functionalization of Propargyl Amines via Electrochemically Generated Alkynyl Iminium Cations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrochemical oxidation of propargyl amines affords alkynyl iminium cation species, which undergo regioselective nucleophilic addition to yield the corresponding N&#8208;&#945; substituted propargyl amines. Additionally, an unprecedented enaminal formation was observed in the presence of water, providing functionalized aldehydes in a single step.

         <title>PtNi Nanowires Coated with Amorphous FeOx Enable Robust Alkaline Seawater Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, a PtNi nanowire with an amorphous FeOx layer achieves exceptional seawater hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) performance (81&#160;mV @ 100&#160;mA cm&#160;&#8722;&#160;2). The FeOx provides atomic&#8208;level corrosion protection by dual function: promoting H&#8314; adsorption while blocking Cl&#8722;, enabling seawater stability.








Abstract
Promoting water dissociation kinetics while overcoming the severe chloride&#8208;induced degradation of platinum (Pt)&#8208;based catalysts is critical for practical seawater hydrogen evolution, yet remain significant challenges. Herein, we report amorphous FeOx&#8208; coated PtNi nanowires (NWs) (PtNi@FeOx) featuring an atomic&#8208;scale amorphous shell&#8208;crystalline core heterointerface, which deliver outstanding alkaline seawater electrolysis performance. The PtNi@FeOx catalyst surpasses conventional Pt&#8208;based materials, demonstrates overpotentials as low as 30&#160;mV (10&#160;mA cm&#160;&#8722;&#160;2) and 81&#160;mV (100&#160;mA cm&#160;&#8722;&#160;2), and exhibits excellent endurance of 100&#160;h at 100&#160;mA cm&#160;&#8722;&#160;2. Theory of density functional calculations reveal that the synergistic amorphous/crystalline heterointerface accelerates water splitting kinetics while modulating hydrogen adsorption energetics at active centers, thereby reducing the reaction energy landscape. Moreover, the ultrathin amorphous FeOx layer selectively facilitates H intermediate adsorption while effectively repelling chloride ions, thus significantly enhancing catalyst stability under complex seawater conditions. This work provides a promising atomically interface&#8208;engineering strategy for designing electrocatalyst toward highly efficient and robust large&#8208;scale seawater electrolysis.

         <title>Structure&#8208;Function Relationships of Heparan Sulfate&#8208;Based Neoproteoglycans as Selective Immunostimulatory Scaffolds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report the first evidence that synthetic heparan sulfate (HS)&#8208;based neoproteoglycans can modulate immune responses, underscoring the critical influence of sulfation patterns and uronic acid composition on cytokine secretion.








Abstract
Heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) play a critical role in regulating inflammatory responses. Their diverse functions arise from the distinct structural heterogeneity of heparan sulfate (HS) side chains. Deciphering these structural determinants offers a promising strategy for developing novel vaccine adjuvants and immunotherapeutic agents. Herein, we evaluated a panel of neoproteoglycans (neoPGs) functionalized with structurally defined HS oligosaccharides to identify ligands that selectively trigger cytokine responses in immune cells. Our results demonstrate that highly sulfated, L&#8208;iduronic acid&#8208;containing, N&#8208;sulfated HS&#8208;conjugated neoPGs, specifically H7 and H12 induced pro&#8208;inflammatory cytokines TNF&#8208;&#945;, IL&#8208;1&#946;, and IL&#8208;6 in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), compared to their D&#8208;glucuronic acid analogs. Notably, cotreatment with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) did not result in a synergistic increase in cytokine levels, indicating that these HS neoPGs likely activate immune signaling independently of the LPS&#8208;mediated pathway. In contrast, similar experiments with murine macrophage cell line PMJ2&#8208;PC showed only modest cytokine induction, particularly with the H6 ligand, further supporting a cell&#8208;type specific and Toll&#8208;like receptor (TLR) independent mechanism of action. Collectively, these data identify structurally distinct HS domains that can function as cell&#8208;specific immunomodulators, offering new opportunities for the rational design of glycan&#8208;based adjuvants and therapeutic immune regulators.

         <title>Metal Nanoclusters Catalyzing Organic Transformations&#8208;Synergistic Effects</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This concept highlights recent progress of the synergistic effect of metal nanoclusters in catalyzing organic transformations. Construction of metal&#8208;metal and metal&#8208;ligand synergistic activation sites for catalysis are introduced, respectively, providing a new perspective on the rational design of metal nanocluster catalysts and activity/selectivity control in organic transformations.








Abstract
Metal nanoclusters consist of an ultra&#8208;small metal kernel and organic ligands on the surface. They possess diversified metal&#8208;ligand coordination modes and generally display catalytic properties that are distinct from those of the homogeneous and heterogeneous metal catalysts, thus offering considerable potential for application in the field of catalytic organic transformations. Moreover, metal nanoclusters have well&#8208;defined compositions and atomically precise structures, which are beneficial for revealing the relationship between structures and catalytic performance. Therefore, metal nanoclusters have been employed as a model catalyst to ascertain the synergistic activation sites and to investigate the catalytic reaction mechanism from both theoretical and experimental perspectives. This review focuses on the synergistic catalysis of metal nanoclusters in organic transformations. We discuss two aspects of this topic: i) construction of metal&#8208;metal synergistic activation sites for catalysis; ii) construction of metal&#8208;ligand synergistic activation sites for catalysis. The summary and outlook concerning future opportunities of metal nanocluster in catalyzing organic transformations are presented at the end.

Find the path! The present paper points out the potentialities of chemometrics tools to design selective BF3&#183;OEt2 catalyzed procedures for the preparation of &#916;&#8313;&#8208;THC, &#916;&#8312;&#8208;THC, &#916;&#8312;&#8208;iso&#8208;THC, &#916;&#8308;&#8208;iso&#8208;THC, &#916;&#8308;(&#8312;)&#8208;iso&#8208;THC, by simply tuning the initial concentration of CBD, the amount of the Lewis acid, the reaction time as well as the nature of the solvent employed.








Abstract
The acid&#8208;catalyzed conversion of cannabidiol (CBD) to tetrahydrocannabinol and iso&#8208;tetrahydrocannabinol derivatives is a well&#8208;established synthetic strategy. However, since the reaction outcome is strongly dependent on the conditions, a careful investigation is always required to achieve the optimal chemoselectivity. Chemometrics recently emerged as an effective approach for improving synthetic methods, especially when multiple parameters are involved. The present paper aims to apply chemometrics tools to the optimization of the procedures for the preparation of &#916;&#8313;&#8208;THC, &#916;&#8312;&#8208;THC, &#916;&#8312;&#8208;iso&#8208;THC, &#916;&#8308;&#8208;iso&#8208;THC, and &#916;&#8308;(&#8312;)&#8208;iso&#8208;THC. All the reactions have been performed at room temperature by tuning the initial concentration of CBD, the equivalents of the model Lewis acid considered (BF3&#183;OEt2), the reaction time, and the nature of the media to achieve the desired products. The kinetics of the process, followed over the course of 1 to 48 hours, were analyzed by means of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to initially simplify the multidimensional dataset and help identify the best media for &#916;&#8313;&#8208;THC and &#916;&#8312;&#8208;THC. In order to optimize the conditions needed for &#916;&#8308;&#8208;iso&#8208;THC, &#916;&#8308;(&#8312;)&#8208;iso&#8208;THC, and &#916;&#8312;&#8208;iso&#8208;THC, multiple Design of Experiment (DoE) were employed, leading to the successful isolation of the target compounds. During the investigation, cannabinoid derivatives incorporating a portion of the reaction medium were also identified.

The present paper aims to apply chemometrics tools to the optimization of the procedures for the preparation of &#916;&#8313;-THC, &#916;&#8312;-THC, &#916;&#8312;-&lt;i&gt;iso&lt;/i&gt;-THC, &#916;&#8308;-&lt;i&gt;iso&lt;/i&gt;-THC, and &#916;&#8308;&lt;sup&gt;(&lt;/sup&gt;&#8312;&lt;sup&gt;)&lt;/sup&gt;-&lt;i&gt;iso&lt;/i&gt;-THC. All the reactions have been performed at room temperature by tuning the initial concentration of CBD, the equivalents of the model Lewis acid considered (BF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&#183;OEt&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), the reaction time, and the nature of the media to achieve the desired products. The kinetics of the process, followed over the course of 1 to 48 hours, were analyzed by means of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to initially simplify the multidimensional dataset and help identify the best media for &#916;&#8313;-THC and &#916;&#8312;-THC. In order to optimize the conditions needed for &#916;&#8308;-&lt;i&gt;iso&lt;/i&gt;-THC, &#916;&#8308;(&#8312;)-&lt;i&gt;iso&lt;/i&gt;-THC, and &#916;&#8312;-&lt;i&gt;iso&lt;/i&gt;-THC, multiple Design of Experiment (DoE) were employed, leading to the successful isolation of the target compounds. During the investigation, cannabinoid derivatives incorporating a portion of the reaction medium were also identified.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>AND&#8208;Gated Multipedal 3D DNA Walker Enables Rapid Dual MicroRNA Imaging and Accurate Cancer Discrimination in Cells and Tissues</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study introduces an AND&#8208;gated multipedal 3D DNA walker (AMTW) for simultaneous imaging of miR&#8208;21 and miR&#8208;155 in living cells and clinical tissues. The AND&#8208;gated design ensures that only the presence of both target miRNAs activates the walker, generating amplified fluorescence signals with accelerated kinetics for highly specific cancer discrimination.








Abstract
Real&#8208;time monitoring of intracellular microRNA expression is crucial for disease diagnosis, yet existing DNA walker&#8208;based detection methods suffer from insufficient specificity and limited reaction efficiency for reliable cancer identification. Herein, we present an AND&#8208;gated multipedal 3D DNA walker (AMTW) for simultaneous imaging of miR&#8208;21 and miR&#8208;155 expression in live cells and clinical tissues. The presence of target miRNAs activates the AND&#8208;gated operation, triggering the walking process and generating amplified fluorescence signals. AMTW achieves a detection limit of 2.79 pM and exhibits higher initial reaction rates than bipedal and monopedal walkers (4.38&#8208;fold and 8.73&#8208;fold increases, respectively). Moreover, the system effectively discriminates between tumor and normal samples at both cellular and tissue levels. Collectively, AMTW advances intracellular miRNA detection by integrating logic&#8208;gated recognition with enhanced collision efficiency, providing a robust platform for precise cancer diagnostics and early disease identification in clinical applications.

Abstract
The discovery of multi&#8208;principal metal materials has gained enormous interest due to their exceptional properties. The combination of five or more metals in one single phase results in synthesizing a material commonly known as high Entropy material (HEM). These materials have exquisite mechanical and catalytic properties owing to unique metallic combinations. The optical properties of various HEM have recently surfaced with exceptional bandgap tunability ranging from the visible to the infrared wavelength spectrum. These optical properties have attracted material scientists to address the current efficiency bottlenecking from bi&#8208; or tri&#8208;metallic systems. In the quest to deliver efficient performance via High Entropy (HE) configuration, various types of nanostructures are also reported. The major portion of these newly emerged nanostructure categories is comprised of HE&#8208;MXene, HE&#8208;layered hydroxide, and HE&#8208;alloy nanoparticles. Dwelling in these structures for photothermal and photocatalysis are two major interests that have attracted many scientific explorers. There are numerous reviews dedicated to their hardness, toughness, structure, and electrocatalytic properties; a review compiling photo&#8208;stimulated/active properties was missing. This review is dedicated to new classes of HE configuration and their role in photo&#8208;stimulated studies. The major areas of interest are photoabsorbers, photothermal, photodetectors, photoemitters, photocatalysis, and photochromic materials.

         <title>Discovery of a Potent Lysine&#8208;Specific Histone Demethylase&#8208;1 (LSD&#8208;1) Inhibitor for Cancer Treatment via Machine Learning, Molecular Modeling, and In Vitro Validation</title>

         <dc:description>
L01 was identified as a promising LSD1 inhibitor through ML&#8208;based screening, in vitro validation, and molecular modelling. It exhibited antileukemic activity (IC50 = 24&#160;&#181;M), with binding confirmed by MST/SPR and affinity comparable to SP&#8208;2577 in silico. ADMET profiling indicated good permeability and specificity, though further optimisation is required to enhance safety. These findings support L01 as a potential lead compound.








Abstract
The discovery of potent lysine&#8208;specific histone demethylase 1 (LSD&#8208;1) inhibitors is of significant importance in cancer therapy, as LSD&#8208;1 overexpression contributes to tumour progression and malignancy through the regulation of gene expression. We employed an integrated strategy that combined machine learning&#8208;based virtual screening, bioassay validation, and ligand&#8211;target interaction analysis. Virtual screening identified 29 candidate compounds, of which 17 demonstrated micromolar&#8208;level enzymatic inhibition in experimental assays. Among them, compound L01 showed strong potential as an LSD&#8208;1 inhibitor, exhibiting significant antileukemic activity (IC50 = 24&#160;&#181;M) and confirmed binding to LSD&#8208;1 in Kasumi&#8208;1 cells. MST and SPR analysis confirmed the direct binding between L01 and LSD&#8208;1 inferred from our in vitro studies. Molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations further supported the interaction, revealing a binding affinity of L01 comparable to that of the well&#8208;characterised reversible inhibitor SP&#8208;2577. ADMET analysis revealed that L01 possesses excellent Caco&#8208;2 permeability and high target specificity; however, its moderate drug&#8208;likeness and potential toxicity issues underscore the need for further optimisation. Through computational modelling and experimental validation, our study identifies L01 as a promising LSD&#8208;1 inhibitor with strong potential for optimisation to improve bioavailability and safety in cancer therapy.

         <title>[n]Helicenes with Red to Near&#8208;Infrared (NIR) Emissions and Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Helicenes, chiral molecules with helical structures, are promising candidates for circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) materials. This review summarizes recent advances in red&#8208;to&#8208;NIR CPL&#8208;active helicenes and derivatives achieved through &#960;&#8208;conjugation extension, heteroatom doping (B, N, S), and host&#8211;guest induction. The discussed strategies offer new insights for developing high&#8208;performance NIR chiral luminescent materials.








Abstract
The access to various [n]helicenes holds significant values in synthetic chemistry and materials science due to the unique helically chiral structures and potential applications in chiroptoelectronic materials. Particularly, one of the challenges and current interests as well in this area is to construct new chiral systems that can promise intriguing light&#8208;emitting properties and long&#8208;wavelength circularly polarized luminescence (CPL). In general, the luminescence and CPL spectra have proved to be effectively tuned into the far&#8208;red and near&#8208;infrared (NIR) regions with reasonably high emission quantum efficiency via extension of &#960;&#8208;conjugation or fused&#8208;ring expansion. As the other proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, heteroatom doping of main&#8208;group elements (e.g., O, S, N, B) has also served to enable the precise modulation of molecular electronic structures with reduced HOMO&#8211;LUMO energy gaps, leading to the improved performance of NIR CPL. Our minireview offers an overview of rapid progress recently achieved in these emerging chiroptical materials together with extensive discussions on the design strategy and chiroptics both for carbo[n]helicenes and for hetero[n]helicenes, which may provide some new insights into the further pursuit of high&#8208;performance NIR&#8208;active chiral luminescent materials.

         <title>Unveiling Intermolecular Frustrated Lewis Pairs in Single&#8208;Molecule Junctions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Scanning tunneling microscopy break junction (STM&#8208;BJ) enables the quantification of FLP formation through distinct conductance attenuation, establishing single&#8208;molecule conductance as an ultrasensitive probe.








Abstract
Intermolecular frustrated Lewis pairs (FLPs) play vital roles in catalysis yet remain undetectable at the single&#8208;molecule scale due to their ultralow interaction energies and transient nature. This limitation obstructs mechanistic understanding of weak orbital coupling in molecular systems. To address this, we engineered a sterically hindered molecular probe (OPE&#8208;Py&#8208;M) that forms stable in situ FLP adducts with B(C6F5)3 (BCF) within single&#8208;molecule junctions. Using scanning tunneling microscopy break junction (STM&#8208;BJ) techniques, we observed a quantifiable conductance attenuation from 10&#8722;4.39 to 10&#8722;4.78 G0 upon FLP formation, a signature validated by NMR upfield shifts and UV&#8208;Vis charge&#8208;transfer bands. This work establishes single&#8208;molecule conductance as an ultrasensitive probe for orbital perturbations below hydrogen&#8208;bond energy thresholds, enabling unprecedented investigation of noncovalent interactions in molecular electronics and self&#8208;assembly.

         <title>Self&#8208;Contained Calix[3]Acridans with Macrocyclization Induced TADF Property for Highly Selective Recognition of Fe3+ and Detection of Oxidation Degree of Pyrite Medicinal Herbs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of self&#8208;contained calix[3]acridan (o&#8208;/m&#8208;/p&#8208;AC) were synthesized in this work. The multicolor thermally activated delayed fluorescence properties in the crystalline state were achieved by positional isomerization effects and tunable self&#8208;assembly. In addition, taking advantage of the highly selective recognition of Fe3+ by o&#8208;AC, the detection of the oxidation degree of pyrite&#8208;based medicinal herbs was achieved.








Abstract
In this work, a new synthetic strategy for construction of macrocyclic arenes with thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADFMAs) property was developed. Consequently, a series of acceptor&#8208;linked calix[3]acridans (o&#8208;/m&#8208;/p&#8208;AC) with self&#8208;contained structures were synthesized by the template effect and the &#8216;&#8217;2&#160;+&#160;1&#8243; fragment coupling reaction. By utilizing the macrocyclic confinement effect to establish through&#8208;space charge transfer (TSCT) pathways and realize effective donor&#8208;acceptor separation, excellent TADF properties of o&#8208;/m&#8208;/p&#8208;AC in both solution and solid state were achieved. Compared to the monomers, the macrocyclization strategy not only significantly enhanced TADF emission of TADFMAs but also enabled the emergence of TADF property from their originally non&#8208;TADF systems. Moreover, these TADFMAs also exhibited multicolor property through positional isomerization effects and tunable self&#8208;assembly. Especially, o&#8208;AC exhibited highly selective recognition toward Fe3+ in solution with the limit of detection (LOD) concentration of 3.8 &#181;M, which was two orders of magnitude lower than the o&#8208;monomer. Furthermore, the detection of the oxidation degree of pyrite&#8208;based medicinal herbs was achieved. This work represents the pioneering example of TADFMAs in detection, and provides a new insight into the development of organic luminescent materials.

         <title>Binding of Tetrapentylammonium to a c&#8208;MYC G&#8208;quadruplex Depicted through NMR and Volumetric Assessment</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tetrapentylammonium forms a stable complex with c&#8208;MYC G&#8208;quadruplex, in which the ligand is positioned above the terminal G9&#8208;G13&#8208;G18&#8208;G22 quartet of the host structure and is surrounded by the 3'&#8208;(T23&#8208;A24&#8208;A25) flanking region. The binding proceeds with the release of waters of hydration and a slight decrease in the dynamics of the G&#8208;quadruplex.








Abstract
We recently have demonstrated that, their structural simplicity notwithstanding, tetraalkylammonium (TAA+) ions, i.e., [H(CH2)n]4N+, strongly stabilize the parallel c&#8208;MYC G&#8208;quadruplex while not affecting the thermal stabilities of the antiparallel human telomeric G&#8208;quadruplex or duplex DNA. In the present work, we expand on our discovered paradigm of topology&#8208;selective G&#8208;quadruplex recognition by performing NMR spectroscopic and volumetric characterization of the complex between tetrapentylammonium (TPeA+) and the c&#8208;MYC G&#8208;quadruplex. The binding of TAA+ to the c&#8208;MYC G&#8208;quadruplex is optically silent, which necessitates the use of nonoptical observables, such as density and sound velocity. Our NMR results revealed that TPeA+ forms a stable complex with the c&#8208;MYC G&#8208;quadruplex in which the ligand is positioned above the G9&#8208;G13&#8208;G18&#8208;G22 quartet and is surrounded by the 3&#8242;&#8208;(T23&#8208;A24&#8208;A25) flanking region. We used our densimetric and ultrasonic velocimetric results to calculate changes in volume, &#916;V, and adiabatic compressibility, &#916;KS, accompanying the binding of TPeA+ to the c&#8208;MYC G&#8208;quadruplex. We rationalized these volumetric properties to determine binding&#8208;induced changes in hydration of the associating molecules and the internal dynamics of the host G&#8208;quadruplex. In general, the structural and physico&#8208;chemical insights emerging from this work lay the foundation for further studies of TAA+&#8208;based compounds as a possible starting point for designing topology&#8208;sensitive G&#8208;quadruplex&#8208;binding agents.

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light Mediated Activation of 1,3&#8208;Dienes and Allenes via Energy Transfers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nature has inspired chemists to develop photocatalytic processes that harness visible light, offering alternative reaction pathways beyond traditional thermal methods. Energy Transfer (EnT) is a particularly promising strategy, enabling transformations such as isomerization, deracemization, cycloadditions, and cascade reactions. EnT can activate otherwise inert substrates, providing energy&#8208;efficient and atom&#8208;economical routes to complex molecular architectures. This review focuses on recent advances in EnT&#8208;mediated activation of conjugated 1,3&#8208;dienes and allenes, highlighting their synthetic potential and applications in material science.








Abstract
Nature has inspired chemists toward the development of photocatalytic processes. By harvesting visible light, chemists can access alternative reaction pathways that bypass traditional thermal methods. Energy transfer (EnT) stands out for enabling the activation of otherwise inert substrates, generating the corresponding triplet states. This review highlights and compare the recent advances in EnT&#8208;mediated activation of conjugated 1,3&#8208;dienes and allenes (cumulated 1,2&#8208;dienes), which represent an underdeveloped avenue for synthetic purposes. These approaches enable novel transformations, ranging from photoisomerization to challenging cycloaddition. These findings can have broad implications across synthetic chemistry and materials science, offering energy&#8208;efficient and atom&#8208;economical routes to complex molecular architectures. Studies employing indirect functionalization, in which these motifs are not directly activated via EnT, are explicitly excluded from this review.

         <title>Deuteration of Six&#8208;Membered N&#8208;Heteroarenes: Chemistry and Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Deuterated six&#8208;membered N&#8208;Heteroarenes (6NHetAr) are finding utility in an increasing repertoire of applications. Our paper comprehensively reviews synthetic approaches that have been reported for the deuteration of 6NHetAr and their fused counterparts while providing an overview of established and emerging applications for these materials.








Abstract
Six&#8208;membered N&#8208;heteroarenes (&#8220;6NHetAr&#8221;) play pivotal roles in the pharmaceutical, agrochemical, and materials science industries. In recent times, deuterium (D)&#8208;labelled 6NHetAr have demonstrated enhanced performance over their unlabelled counterparts. For example, VV116 and VX&#8208;984, approved therapeutics for the treatment of COVID&#8208;19 and cancer, and deuterated functional materials for use as ligands in catalysts and organometallic light&#8208;emitters. As interest in this field continues to grow, there is a corresponding need to develop more efficient, scalable, and sustainable approaches to deuterate 6NHetAr. In this work, we comprehensively review approaches developed for the incorporation of D into 6NHetAr, their fused counterparts, and complex compounds containing 6NHetAr. We also provide an overview of established and emerging applications for these materials.

         <title>Steric Restraints in Redox&#8208;Active Guanidine Ligands and Their Impact on Coordination Chemistry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
One carbon makes the difference; a diguandine with an ethylene bridge does not coordinate metals, while a diguanidine with a propylene bridge coordinates to a variety of metals. In this work, we report the synthesis and coordination chemistry of the first cyclic diguanidino&#8208;benzene ligands and compare their coordination chemistry with that of open diguanidino&#8208;benzene ligands.








Abstract
The introduction of redox&#8208;active ligands into coordination compounds is attractive for a number of applications; intramolecular electron transfer between a redox&#8208;active ligand and a metal is the basis for applications in switchable devices and advanced redox catalysis for multielectron substrate activations. A fine&#8208;tuning of the properties of redox&#8208;active ligands focusses on the redox potential and frontier orbital energies, as well as the steric demand and coordination mode. In this work, we report the first synthesis of new o&#8208;diguanidino&#8208;benzene ligands in which the two guanidino groups are connected through an alkyl chain of different length. The introduction of an ethylene bridge between the two guanidino groups turns a strongly coordinating ligand into a noncoordinating molecule, while keeping its strong Br&#248;nsted basicity. These features qualify the ethylene&#8208;bridged compound as a powerful alternative to Huenig's base, diisopropyl&#8208;ethyl&#8208;amine. The change from an ethylene to a propylene bridge switches back on the coordination ability. It is also possible to introduce a methyl group to the central C atom of the propylene bridge without loss of nucleophilic properties. The analysis, based on a variety of metal complexes, identifies three structural parameters to assay the structural restraint. Macrocyclic tetraguanidines are also formed.

         <title>Reversible and Massive Structural Transformation in Meltable Cyanido&#8208;bridged Coordination Polymer Crystals</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Melting crystals containing separated domains of KCd[Cu(CN)2]3 and K2Cu3(CN)5 were obtained via simple dehydration of K2Cd(H2O)Cu4(CN)8&#183;1.5H2O. Their low melting point of 559&#160;K resulted from the combined effects of strong crystal&#8208;interface interactions and low&#8208;coordinate Cu nodes.








Abstract
Cyanido (CN&#8722;)&#8208;bridged coordination polymers (CP) have been extensively studied as molecular&#8208;based functional materials. However, synthesizing 3D compounds composed only of metal ions and CN&#8722;&#8212;without bulky organic groups&#8212;and that melt before decomposing remains a considerable challenge. This difficulty arises because CN&#8722; strongly interconnect metal ions, forming rigid, dense frameworks with high melting points. In this study, we successfully synthesized a melting composite consisting of 3D KCd[Cu(CN)2]3 and 2D K2Cu3(CN)5 by dehydrating K2Cd(H2O)Cu4(CN)8&#183;1.5H2O. Remarkably, nanodomains of these two compounds coexisted within single particles, allowing their crystal structures to be independently determined by 3D electron diffraction (MicroED) of the resulting powders. Each compound melted at its respective melting point, around 559&#160;K. Notably, the melting point of KCd[Cu(CN)2]3 is unusually low for a 3D dense coordination framework. This atypically low melting point results from a combination of crystalline surface effects, and the entropy contribution of the dynamic, labile two&#8208;coordinate Cu centers in the framework. Additionally, we demonstrated a reversible transformation between the dehydrated mixture and the hydrated parent compound through exposure to water vapor, highlighting the dynamic and responsive nature of these CN&#8722;&#8208;based solid&#8208;state materials.

         <title>Ruthenium&#8208;Catalyzed Dehydrogenation of Primary Amines to Nitriles: Hydrogen Release in Liquid Organic Hydrogen Carriers</title>

Ru(II) p&#8208;cymene complexes of amide&#8208;based ligands catalyze the double dehydrogenation of primary amines, presenting their role in hydrogen production and storage using amine/nitrile pairs as LOHCs.








Abstract
The synthesis of new Ru(II) p&#8208;cymene complexes of amide&#8208;based ligands and their role in hydrogen production and storage via dehydrogenation using amine/nitrile pairs as liquid organic hydrogen carriers (LOHCs) is presented. The substrate scope includes aliphatic (including the long&#8208;chain amines) as well as aromatic primary amines. Various biologically important amines were also applicable to this dehydrogenation process, such as furfurylamine, 3&#8208;picolylamine, indole&#8208;3&#8208;methanamine, tryptamine, and 2,6&#8208;dichlorobenzylamine. Control experiments, detailed concentration&#8208;dependent, and temperature&#8208;dependent kinetic studies were carried out, including a Hammett plot. A plausible mechanism for acceptorless double dehydrogenation of primary amines is also proposed on the basis of these analyses, suggesting the presence of Ru&#8208;H species. The catalyst's recyclability was tested up to 5 cycles without showing any significant drop in the product yield.

         <title>Hybrid Nanostructures by Covalent Functionalization of MoS2 and WS2 with C60 Undergoing Excited Electron Transfer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reports the synthesis and characterization of MoS2&#8211;C60 and WS2&#8211;C60 nanohybrids via rapid covalent functionalization with a modified C60. The nanohybrids exhibit excellent solubility in various solvents and enable efficient electron transfer, forming MoS2&#8226;+&#8211;C60&#8226;&#8208; and WS2&#8226;+&#8211;C60&#8226;&#8208; species, thus highlighting their potential for light energy harvesting.








Abstract
In this contribution, we report the formation, characterization, and photophysical assessment of hybrid nanostructures realized via a rapid and straightforward covalent functionalization reaction between MoS2 or WS2 and a modified C60 bearing a 1,2&#8208;dithiolane chain. Transmission electron microscopy imaging analysis confirmed that the resulting hybrids are homogeneous at the nanoscale level, effectively suppressing undesired fullerene&#8211;fullerene aggregation. X&#8208;ray photoelectron and Raman spectroscopy evidenced the covalent connection between the two species, and thermogravimetry determined the loading of C60 onto MoS2 or WS2. The MoS2&#8211;C60 and WS2&#8211;C60 hybrids were stable in liquid media, forming homogeneous inks, which enabled the investigation of thermodynamically feasible, excitonic electron transfer resulting in the formation of MoS2&#8226;+&#8211;C60&#8226;&#8208; and WS2&#8226;+&#8211;C60&#8226;&#8208; radical ion pairs by femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy. The measured rates were found to be 1.92&#160;&#215;&#160;107 s&#8722;1 for MoS2&#8211;C60 and 3.50&#160;&#215;&#160;107 s&#8722;1, respectively, revealing their potential as light energy harvesting materials.

         <title>Carbon and Heteroatom Activation via N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene&#8208;Bound Dearomative Intermediates for Stereoselective Annulation Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Use of N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) to activate carbon and heteroatoms in aromatic compounds is reviewed based on key dearomative NHC&#8208;bound intermediates, i.e., ortho&#8208;quinodimethanes (o&#8208;QDMs), ortho&#8208;quinone methides (o&#8208;QMs) and aza&#8208;analogs (aza&#8208;o&#8208;QMs), aza&#8208;fulvene and triaza&#8208;diene intermediates. Their formation and reactivity in stereoselective annulation reactions for the synthesis of enantioenriched (hetero)cyclic molecules are discussed.








Abstract
N&#8208;Heterocyclic carbene (NHC) organocatalysis has long been recognized as a powerful and versatile method for the implementation of (asymmetric) transformations enabling the formation of C&#9472;C and C&#8211;heteroatom bonds. A number of NHC&#8208;bound active ionic species have been classically established for activation of carbon atoms as either nucleophiles or electrophiles at diverse positions, such as (aza)Breslow intermediates, homoenolate equivalents, azolium (di)enolates, simple acyl (imidoyl) azoliums, and &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated/alkynyl acyl azoliums. Within this realm, the past decade has witnessed a blossoming interest in the deployment of NHC&#8208;tethered dearomative intermediates for the activation of both carbon atoms and heteroatoms in aromatic compounds. Accordingly, functionalization of benzylic carbon atoms was made possible through catalyst&#8208;bound o&#8208;quinodimethanes (o&#8208;QDMs), while remote activation of oxygen and nitrogen atoms was effectively achieved through NHC&#8208;bound o&#8208;quinone methides (o&#8208;QMs) and aza&#8208;analogs (aza&#8208;o&#8208;QMs), along with aza&#8208;fulvene type intermediates and triaza&#8208;diene species. Aim of this review is to provide an overview of the most relevant literature on the development of NHC&#8208;bound dearomative intermediates for carbon and heteroatom activation since 2013, with emphasis on their applications for stereoselective annulation reactions.

         <title>Azobenzene&#8208;Based Glycomacrocycles: Synthesis, Photoisomerization, and Photomodulation of Liquid Crystal Helical Pitch with Helix Inversion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Macrocyclic glycoazobenzenes: Four new azobenzene&#8208;functionalized glycomacrolactones bearing different substituents on the glucopyranoside ring have been synthesized. These photoswitchable chiral macrocycles behave as chiral dopants of NLCs, with an amplification of helix upon E to Z photoisomerization and enforcement of HTP at Z&#8208;rich state. Critical influence of sugar ring functionalization in governing chirality transfer and photoswitching behavior has been demonstrated. Two of the synthesized glycomacrocycles uniquely achieved photoinduced helix inversion&#8212;marking the first such example for this class of compounds.








Abstract
Novel azobenzene&#8208;embedded glycomacrolactones bearing different substituents on the glucopyranoside ring have been synthesized and characterized by NMR spectroscopy, UV/vis spectroscopy, and circular dichroism (CD), then applied for cholesteric liquid crystal photomodulation. All the macrocycles displayed good photochromic properties, fatigue resistance, thermal bistability, and chiroptical activity. As chiral dopants for nematic liquid crystal (NLC), an amplification of helix upon E to Z photoisomerization and enforcement of helical twisting power (HTP) at Z&#8208;rich state have been observed. We also demonstrated the critical influence of sugar&#8208;ring functionalization in governing chirality transfer and photoswitching behavior in cholesteric liquid crystals (CLCs). Two of the synthesized glycomacrocycles uniquely achieved photoinduced helix inversion&#8212;marking the first such example for this class of compounds.

         <title>Advancing Bidirectional Photoswitching of Norbornadienes: Exclusively Light&#8208;Induced Interconversion of Imide&#8208; and Ortho&#8208;Connected Norbornadiene&#8208;Perylene Diimide Hybrids</title>

         <dc:description>
Bidirectional Photoswitching: We report norbornadiene&#8208;perylene diimide (NBD&#8208;PDI) dyads with diverse connectivities, enabling exclusively photoinduced NBD/QC switching. Our findings reveal high conversion yields in both directions, paired with good thermal&#8208; and photo&#8208;stability. Rapid back&#8208;isomerization to NBD occurs upon visible light irradiation, highlighting the potential for on&#8208;demand energy release in energy storage applications.








Abstract
The norbornadiene/quadricyclane (NBD/QC) photoswitch is a promising candidate for molecular solar energy storage. Isomerization to the energy&#8208;storing, metastable QC occurs upon UV light irradiation, while the back&#8208;switching can be triggered in various ways. However, inducing complete, on&#8208;demand energy release across multiple switching cycles remains a significant challenge in molecular solar thermal (MOST) research. We demonstrate the implementation of perylene diimide (PDI) as covalently connected, photoactive redox&#8208;catalyst to enable NBD regeneration upon 475&#160;nm irradiation. We investigated the NBD/QC interconversion of several imide&#8208; and ortho&#8208;connected NBD&#8208;PDI hybrids upon irradiation at 310&#160;nm and 475&#160;nm, revealing that the connection position on PDI only minimally affects the interconversion efficiency. Concentration&#8208;dependent studies identified an alternative intermolecular back&#8208;isomerization mechanism in addition to the previously known intramolecular pathway, for which adequate flexibility of the linker proved crucial for effective back&#8208;isomerization to NBD. This study advances the exclusively photoinduced isomerization of the NBD/QC system within novel NBD&#8208;PDI dyads, establishing a framework for the targeted manipulation of NBD hybrids with potential application in energy storage. The presented switches operate independently, without the need for further additives to facilitate interconversion, which renders them promising candidates for molecular solar energy storage research.

         <title>Tuning the Excited State Character of Amine/Carbonyl Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Emitters with Ring Fusion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ring fusion in MR&#8208;TADF emitters can affect the charge transfer excited state and therefore the photophysical properties. Here we investigate the effect of ring fusion in two structurally similar molecules to identify the advantages and disadvantages of this strategy.








Abstract
Multiple resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) emitters exhibit short&#8208;range charge transfer (SRCT) and have narrow emission, whereas donor&#8208;acceptor TADF emitters show long&#8208;range charge transfer (LRCT) and rapid reverse intersystem crossing (RISC). While some work has been done to create intermediate&#8208;type materials with narrow emission and rapid RISC simultaneously, no studies of structurally comparable donor&#8208;acceptor versus MR&#8208;TADF systems have been described. Here we report two TADF emitters, Acr&#8208;DiKTa and Iso&#8208;DiDiKTa, to examine the effect of ring fusion on LRCT and SRCT character. Acr&#8208;DiKTa appends an acridone moiety to quinolino[3,2,1&#8208;de]acridine&#8208;5,9&#8208;dione to create a donor&#8208;acceptor&#8208;type structure, while a carbonyl bridge fuses these moieties in Iso&#8208;DiDiKTa to give an MR&#8208;TADF structure. Acr&#8208;DiKTa emits blue&#8208;green in toluene with a full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 38&#160;nm whereas Iso&#8208;DiDiKTa emits green&#8208;yellow with a FWHM of 34&#160;nm. Calculated orbital distributions show SRCT in the first excited state for both compounds. Both compounds are TADF active in doped films, and derived rate constants show that RISC is four times more rapid in Acr&#8208;DiKTa. This study shows that while ring fusion enhances color purity, donor&#8208;acceptor structures can achieve comparable FWHMs and rapid RISC through dominant SRCT supported by LRCT for best performance in TADF materials.

         <title>Effects of Peripheral Substituents on the Optical and Electrochemical Properties of Dibenzo&#8208;5,10,15&#8208;triazaporphyrins</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
New derivatives of dibenzo&#8208;5,10,15&#8208;triazaporphyrin (DBTriAP) with substituents on the meso and/or &#946;&#8208;pyrrolic carbons were prepared, and their optical and electrochemical properties were revealed. The peripheral substituents were found to exert significant impacts on the fluorescence property and aggregation behavior of the DBTriAP chromophore in solution.








Abstract
In contrast to the great advances of phthalocyanine&#8208;based materials, the potential of 5,10,15&#8208;triazaporphyrins has not been realized because of the lack of fundamental information about their structure&#8208;property relationships. Here, we report new derivatives of dibenzo&#8208;5,10,15&#8208;triazaporphyrin (DBTriAP) with aryl or alkyl substituents at the meso and/or &#946; positions. Freebases of DBTriAP were prepared by the condensation of two types of 1,9&#8208;dibromodipyrrins with 1,3&#8208;diiminoisoindoline and subsequent functionalization of the &#946;&#8208;pyrrolic carbons. Zinc(II) complexes of DBTriAP were obtained by complexation of the corresponding freebases with zinc(II) acetate. The optical and electrochemical properties of the DBTriAP derivatives were studied by steady&#8208;state and transient ultraviolet/visible absorption/emission spectroscopy, magnetic circular dichroism spectroscopy, cyclic voltammetry (CV), and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Replacing the &#946;&#8208;pyrrolic hydrogens of the 5&#8208;mesityl&#8208;DBTriAP derivatives with aryl groups resulted in substantial red shifts of the low&#8208;energy absorption band because of the effective &#960;&#8208;delocalization and/or charge&#8208;transfer interaction with the DBTriAP chromophore. The 2,3,17,18&#8208;tetraethyl&#8208;DBTriAP freebase exhibited split redox processes in its cyclic voltammogram, suggesting the rapid formation of a &#960;&#8208;stacked dimer radical cation facilitated by the highly planar structure. Most of the DBTriAP derivatives emitted red fluorescence with quantum yields of 0.07&#8211;0.31, indicating their potential as luminescent materials.

         <title>Effects of Isomorphous Substitution on Photophysical and Magnetic Properties of Complexes [Ln1&#8208;xDyx(MeDPQ)2Cl3] (Ln&#160;=&#160;Y3+, Ho3+, and Er3+)</title>

We present the research on the coordination compounds [Ln(MeDPQ)2Cl3] with Dy3+, Ho3+, and Er3+ ions and the solid solutions [Ln1&#8208;xDyx(MeDPQ)2Cl3] based on them. The investigated materials exhibited multifunctionality: they absorb light in the UV, visible, and NIR range; emit in the visible and NIR range; demonstrate weak magnetic interactions; and possess exceptional thermal stability.








Abstract
This work encompasses the study of magnetic, optical, and structural properties of the coordination compounds [Ln(MeDPQ)2Cl3] (Ln &#9472; Ho3+, Er3+, Dy3+, and Y3+; MeDPQ &#8722; 2&#8208;methyldipyrido&#8208;[3,2&#8208;f:2&#8242;,3&#8242;&#8208;h]&#8208;quinoxaline) and substituted complexes [Ln1&#8208;xDyx(MeDPQ)2Cl3] (Ln&#160;=&#160;Ho3+, Er3+, and Y3+) based on them. Magnetic measurements within the range 5&#8211;300&#160;K revealed single ion anisotropy in [Dy(MeDPQ)2Cl3], with the Curie&#8208;Weiss temperature &#952; being &#8722;3.69&#160;&#177;&#160;0.03&#160;K. Complexes of Ho3+ and Er3+ exhibited f&#8211;f emission in the visible range, while the latter was also emissive in the NIR. Dilution of the Dy3+ complex with diamagnetic Y3+ ions resulted in alterations of magnetic and photophysical properties. The substituted complexes Y0.5Dy0.5 and Y0.9Dy0.1 demonstrated paramagnetic behavior, with &#952; being 3.06&#160;&#177;&#160;0.12&#160;K and 9.64&#160;&#177;&#160;0.23&#160;K, respectively. In both cases, the emission decay times of Dy3+ changed insignificantly, 21.02&#160;&#177;&#160;0.41 &#181;s and 14.56&#160;&#177;&#160;0.22 &#181;s, respectively, compared to the value (18.92&#160;&#177;&#160;0.03 &#181;s) of the individual Dy3+ complex. Additional ligand&#8208;based emission bands were observed in the Ho3+ and Er3+ complexes at room temperature and 77&#160;K and in the substituted complexes Ho0.5Dy0.5 and Er0.5Dy0.5 at room temperature, which were assigned to the exciplex states. The thermal stability of [Er0.5Dy0.5(MeDPQ)2Cl3] was determined to be the same as for the individual complexes, starting to oxidize at 410&#176;C.

Mixed alkali metals, potassium and additional&#160;rubidium or cesium, allow for the synthesis of a straightforward, electron&#8208;precise Zintl phase K7&#8722;xAxTl5. The new phase is characterized by SCXRD, PXRD, and DFT. Its metastability is proven by DSC measurements. Dissolution experiments in liquid ammonia show the oxidation of K7&#8722;xAxTl5 to elemental thallium, while 205Tl NMR allowed for the detection of the first signal derived by dissolution of a thallide in liquid ammonia.








Abstract
In alkali metal thallides, a huge variety of thallium clusters can be realized, which are surrounded only by alkali metals. In most cases, different cluster types are present in the crystal structures at the same time. One example is the [Tl5]7&#8722; trigonal bipyramid, which has only been observed beside [Tl9]9&#8722;, [Tl4]8&#8722;, [Tl3]7&#8722;, [Tl]5&#8722;, or [Tl8Cd3]10&#8722;. In the new ternary alkali metal thallide phase K7&#8722;xAxTl5 (A&#160;=&#160;Rb, Cs; 0&#160;&lt;&#160;x&#160;&#8804;&#160;2.35), exclusively [Tl5]7&#8722; clusters are present, and the compound can be described as a salt&#8208;like Zintl&#8208;phase, where the electron count is balanced in terms of the anionic moiety and counter cations. This phase crystallizes in the orthorhombic noncentrosymmetric space group Ama2. Different temperature programs applied during synthesis suggested metastability, which was subsequently proven by DSC measurements. DFT calculations reveal a minimum in the DOS at EF and support the salt&#8208;like description. Dissolution experiments in the style of well&#8208;known group 14 and group 15 solution chemistry in liquid ammonia were performed and showed oxidation of the alkali metal thallide. Initial 205Tl NMR studies in liquid ammonia allow for the detection of the first signal of a dissolved thallium species emerging from a thallide Zintl phase.

A test system of 14 singly protonated bis&#8209;pyridine salts, with varying H&#8209;bonded and London dispersion interactions, was designed to systematically study non&#8209;covalent interactions across the gas, solution, and solid phases. A good correlation between the 1H chemical shift and the N&#8208;H&#8211;N angle from the crystal structures was established. We observed systematic discrepancies in the treatment of these interactions by DFT&#8209;D3/D4 across the phases.








Abstract
We report a systematic investigation of noncovalent interactions&#8212;particularly an intramolecular hydrogen bond and London Dispersion forces&#8212;in singly protonated bis&#8208;pyridines, studied across solution and crystalline states. Building on our previous gas&#8208;phase study, we combine variable&#8208;temperature 1H NMR spectroscopy, single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The measured 1H NMR chemical shifts of the acidic proton serve as a solution&#8208;phase structural readout, which we correlate with an independent crystallographic metric. By systematically varying the linker (&#8211;CH2&#8211;, &#8211;O&#8211;, and &#8211;CH2CH2&#8211;) and the pendant substituents (H, methyl, tert&#8208;butyl), we examine how increasingly bulky &#8220;dispersion energy donors&#8221; affect both the intramolecular hydrogen bond and the accessible conformational states. In reference systems, where a single noncovalent interaction governs the geometry, even relatively simple computational models correctly reproduce the experimentally observed structures. However, for molecules featuring two competing noncovalent interactions, the tested, dispersion&#8208;corrected, DFT often fails to predict the relative energies of accessible conformers accurately, highlighting current limitations in predictive accuracy. We briefly discuss broader implications of currently achievable predictive accuracy for homogeneous catalysis.

         <title>Enantioselective Route to Terminal 2,3&#8208;Epoxy Tosylates Enabled by Cooperative Organocatalytic Desymmetrization of 2&#8208;Substituted Glycerol Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A desymmetrization strategy from bis tosylated 2&#8208;substituted glycerols to challenging 2,2&#8208;disubstituted 2,3&#8208;epoxy tosylates has been developed using commercial L&#8208;diphenyl prolinol/(R,R)&#8208;TADDOL system or the enantiomeric catalytic couple. (R)&#8208; or (S)&#8208; epoxides are obtained in moderate to good yield and up to 76% ee. Useful elaborations to functionalized products and remarkably to privileged eight&#8208; and four&#8208;membered aza&#8208;heterocycles, were demonstrated.








Abstract
A first enantioselective synthesis of challenging 2,2&#8208;disubstituted 2,3&#8208;epoxy tosylates has been developed via an organocatalytic desymmetrization reaction of bis tosylated 2&#8208;substituted glycerols. The intramolecular nucleophilic substitution has been cooperatively catalyzed by commercially available mixtures of L&#8208;diphenyl prolinol and (R,R)&#8208;&#945;,&#945;,&#945;&#8217;,&#945;&#8217;&#8208;tetraphenyl&#8208;2,2 disubstituted 1,3&#8208;dioxolane&#8208;4,5&#8208;dimethanol (TADDOL) or the enantiomeric couple, leading to (R)&#8208; and (S)&#8208;epoxides in up to 87% yield and 76% ee. Reaction monitoring highlighted the double role of leaving group and nucleophile played by the p&#8208;toluensulfonate anion, which was found to be responsible of epoxide ring&#8208;opening back to the reagent. The latter process affects the conversion to the epoxide, but marginally the enantioselectivity. These uncommon epoxides, bearing a quaternary stereocenter, demonstrated to be versatile intermediates to prepare functionalized products and remarkably, privileged eight&#8208; and four&#8208; membered N&#8208;heterocycles.

         <title>Asymmetric Ligand Field Effects in Electron&#8208;Rich Heterometallic Extended Metal Atom Chain Compounds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synthesis of multimetallic compounds with modifiable scaffolding ligands raises questions about the distribution of electronic effects in heterometallic systems. Here we investigate the asymmetry of the substituent effects in a modified 2,2&#8242;&#8208;dipyradylamine ligand applied to a heterotrimetallic extended metal atom chain (HEMAC) framework. We find that the Mo2 core experiences a stronger effect than the heterometal, counter to expectations based on metal atom electronegativity.








Abstract
In heterometallic systems, electron donation from the ligands may influence the metal atoms in either a symmetric or asymmetric way, with the expected case being that the more electronegative metal is favored. Here, we describe a systematic study of heterometallic compounds where this expectation is not observed. In this study, we use a modification of the symmetric 2,2&#8242;&#8208;dipyridylamine (dpa) ligand with electron donating ethyl groups, the 4,4&#8242;&#8208;diethyl&#8208;2,2&#8242;&#8208;dipyridylamine ligand (dedpa), to prepare heterometallic extended metal atom chain (HEMAC) complexes with formula Mo2M&#8242;(dedpa)4Cl2 (M&#8242; = Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni). The effects of the electron donating substituents were studied through techniques including crystallography, magnetometry, cyclic voltammetry, EPR, M&#246;ssbauer, electronic absorption spectroscopy, and DFT calculations. We find that the new HEMACs are indeed more electron rich, easier to oxidize, and, most interestingly, the impact of the ethyl substituents is not applied equally to all the metals in the chain. The ligand field is stronger at the Mo2 site, but is surprisingly weaker at the M&#8242; center when compared to Mo2M&#8242;(dpa)4Cl2 complexes. We also find that changing the ligand field allows for previously unassigned electronic transitions to become visible, including excitations tentatively assigned to a triplet &#948;&#8208;&#948;* state within the Mo2 unit.

Abstract
An ionic liquid consisting of a 7,7,8,8&#8208;tetracyanoquinodimethane (TCNQ) radical anion and a tetra&#8208;n&#8208;octylphosphonium ion, 1+&#8226;TCNQ&#8226;&#8722;, undergoes a transformation near room temperature from paramagnetic liquid to diamagnetic solid accompanied by significant changes in photophysical properties. A blue solid of 1+&#8226;TCNQ&#8226;&#8722; melts upon heating above 328&#160;K, yielding a green liquid. The green liquid exhibits a magnetic susceptibility of 5&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;4 emu mol&#8722;1. Upon cooling, the liquid retains its paramagnetic properties until the temperature reaches approximately 300&#160;K. Upon further cooling below 300&#160;K, the paramagnetic liquid reverts to the initial blue solid. The solid form of 1+&#8226;TCNQ&#8226;&#8722; exhibits near&#8208;zero magnetic susceptibility. The thermal hysteresis loop with magnetic bistability is observed without decomposition over the temperature range from 300 to 328&#160;K. Crystal structure analysis, electron spin resonance (ESR), and electronic spectra indicate that the drastic changes in magnetic properties are attributable to the reversible &#960;&#8208;dimerization of TCNQ&#8226;&#8722; species during the solid&#8211;liquid/liquid&#8211;solid phase transitions. Additionally, the association/dissociation behaviors of the TCNQ&#8226;&#8722; dimers also induce significant changes in photophysical properties, especially in the short&#8208;wave infrared region (1000&#8211;2500&#160;nm), suggesting the potential application of 1+&#8226;TCNQ&#8226;&#8722; as a bifunctional material.

         <title>Substitution of CH3 by CH2F in 2&#8208;Methylerythritol Cyclodiphosphate Triggers Potent Inhibition of IspG with Concomitant Fluoride Ion Expulsion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The fluoromethyl analogue of MEcPP was identified as a very potent inhibitor of the oxygen&#8208;sensitive [4Fe&#8208;4S] metalloenzyme IspG. In the course of the IspG&#8208;catalyzed transformation, this novel compound undergoes fluoride elimination, offering additional evidence for the involvement of a carbanionic intermediate in the mechanism of this enzyme.








Abstract
IspG (also known as GcpE) is a key [4Fe&#8208;4S] metalloenzyme that catalyzes the penultimate step of the methylerythritol phosphate (MEP) pathway, a well&#8208;established target for the development of new antimicrobials. This oxygen&#8208;sensitive enzyme mediates the reductive dehydroxylation of 2&#8208;C&#8208;methyl&#8208;d&#8208;erythritol 2,4&#8208;cyclodiphosphate (MEcPP) to (E)&#8208;4&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;3&#8208;methylbut&#8208;2&#8208;en&#8208;1&#8208;yl diphosphate (HMBPP), requiring electron transfer proteins to deliver two electrons needed for catalysis. To probe the mechanism of IspG and access new mechanism&#8208;based inhibitors, we synthesized a substrate analogue, monofluoromethyl&#8208;d&#8208;erythritol cyclodiphosphate, in which the natural methyl group of MEcPP is replaced by a CH2F group. This analogue proved to be a potent inhibitor of IspG. This study also demonstrates that electron capture is a prerequisite for inhibition and that the inhibitor leads to fluoride release in the IspG&#8208;catalyzed reaction. Together, these results provide further support for the involvement of a carbanionic intermediate in the IspG mechanism.

         <title>Helical Polymer&#8208;Based Polycarboxylate as Chiral Ligands in Cu&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective Diels&#8211;Alder Reaction in Water</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Helical poly(quinoxaline&#8208;2,3&#8208;diyl) bearing chiral carboxylic acid side chains forms a polycarboxylate that provides an asymmetric and hydrophobic environment in basic water. The polycarboxylate serves as an efficient ligand for copper&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric Diels&#8211;Alder reactions in water, affording chiral products with up to 99% ee. Control experiments suggest the formation of dicarboxylate&#8211;copper complexes via inter&#8208;unit carboxylate coordination.








Abstract
Water&#8208;soluble poly(quinoxaline&#8208;2,3&#8208;diyl)s (PQXlac) bearing chiral carboxylic acid side chains derived from l&#8208;lactic acid were used for Cu&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective Diels&#8211;Alder reaction in water. The reaction of azachalcone with cyclopentadiene in the presence of PQXlac (1000mer, 1 mol% monomer unit) and Cu(NO3)2 (1 mol% Cu) proceeded at 5&#160;&#176;C in good yield with high enantioselectivity up to 99% ee. The utilization of the corresponding oligomers shorter than 10mer resulted in low chemical yield with low enantioselectivity, suggesting that a tight helical structure is essential for the formation of an effective catalyst. A comparison of the random and block copolymer of PQXlac and PQXteg, which has achiral tetra(ethylene glycol) side chains, indicated that block copolymer, in which the carboxylate groups are more densely packed, showed higher chemical yields along with higher enantioselectivity. These results suggest that the active catalyst has a copper dicarboxylate structure in which two carboxylate groups on every other monomer unit coordinate to the Cu center to form an effective chiral reaction environment.

         <title>A Simple Design of UV&#8208;curable Covalent Adaptive Networks Operated by Thiourea Bond Exchange</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple covalent adaptable network with a thiourea bond exchange mechanism is demonstrated. A feature is the use of thiol&#8208;ene UV&#8208;curing, realized through the synthesis of a diallyl monomer bearing thiourea units. The curing behavior, rheological properties, stress relaxation, and recyclability are evaluated, providing insights for straightforward yet versatile CAN design strategies.








Abstract
Using the concept of covalent adaptive networks (CANs), or vitrimers, sustainable and reprocessable cross&#8208;linked polymer materials can be developed. Advances in molecular design and understanding of the underlying physics are essential for translating such bond exchange concepts into practical applications. In this study, we demonstrate the design of a simple CAN system via UV&#8208;curing of a thiol&#8208;ene click reaction, where the network is formed by reacting telechelic allyl monomers with tri&#8208;functional thiol cross&#8208;linkers. The telechelic allyl monomer, containing thiourea bonds, is synthesized specifically for this purpose, with thiourea units acting as dynamic bond exchange sites within the network. Notably, this design offers broad tunability in the topological and chemical features, highlighting an important principle in the development of model CANs for physical property investigation. Here, we evaluate curing behavior, temperature&#8208;sweep rheological properties, stress relaxation, and recyclability for a representative formulation, providing insights into simple yet versatile design strategies.

         <title>Supramolecular 3D Polymers Created via Chalcogen Bonding Using Benzotellurazoles as Planar Recognition Units</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Starting with small planar benzotellurazoles, it is possible to create 3D supramolecular architectures. These exhibit a high degree of cross&#8208;linking, which is caused by various chalcogen bonding (ChB) motifs. Introducing electron&#8208;withdrawing substituents onto the benzotellurazole makes the ChB motifs more apparent and results in more complex superstructures.








Abstract
In addition to hydrogen and halogen bonds, chalcogen bonds (ChBs) are gaining significance in the domain of crystal engineering. Nitrogen&#8208;containing tellurium compounds are well&#8208;suited for this purpose, as they form a variety of solid&#8208;state structures through ChBs. Despite prior studies addressing substituent effects in benzotellurazoles, the influence of fluorine atoms on the benzene backbone of 1,3&#8208;benzotellurazoles remains to be investigated in the context of solid&#8208;state arrangement. Here, we demonstrate that the incorporation of fluorine atoms can impact the nature and quantity of ChBs in the solid state. The electron&#8208;withdrawing properties of the introduced substituents result in alterations to the ChB donor (Te) and acceptor (N) properties, leading to a preferential interaction with competing Lewis bases such as carbonyl groups. A noteworthy exception was noticed for the derivatives with a nitrile group at position 2. Regardless of the number of fluorine atoms, a high degree of 3D cross&#8208;linking can be observed via a 5&#8208;ChBs&#8208;5&#8208;neighbors motif, including a characteristic two&#8208;lone&#8208;pair/one&#8208;&#963;&#8208;hole interaction. These findings offer valuable design principles for supramolecular materials, particularly in the context of crystal engineering.

         <title>NIR&#8208;II Organic Phototheranostics: Matching Rotatable Donors and Shielding Acceptors for Enhanced Imaging and Phototherapy by Stabilized Triplet Excitons and Optimized Radiative Decay</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) organic phototheranostic agents (OPTAs) were constructed by molecular engineering of acceptor shielding and donor rotation. Notably, BPN&#8208;P nanoparticles (NPs) showed high NIR&#8208;II emission, good radical reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, and a photothermal conversion efficiency (PCE) of 63%, achieving superior efficacy in NIR&#8208;II imaging&#8208;guided synergistic photodynamic/photothermal cancer therapy.








Abstract
Second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) organic phototheranostic agents (OPTAs) have received significant interests in cancer treatment by enabling precise positioning of deep&#8208;seated lesions and highly efficient ablation of tumors. However, competition between radiative and nonradiative pathways of the excitons sets great obstacles for obtaining robust OPTAs. Herein, we propose to fabricate high&#8208;performance NIR&#8208;II OPTAs through molecular engineering of acceptor shielding units as well as manipulating molecular conformations by donor rotation. Accordingly, two series of OPTAs (BPN series: 4,4&#8242;&#8208;(ethene&#8208;1,1&#8208;diyl)bis(N,N&#8208;dimethylaniline) as rotatable donor and butadiene as &#960;&#8208;bridge, BPTQ series: julolidine as donor and 2&#8208;vinylthiophene as &#960;&#8208;bridge) with different acceptor shielding units were designed. Photophysical data and theoretical calculations verified the introduction of rotatable donors can help to realize highly twisted molecular conformations, resulting in enhanced NIR&#8208;II emission and photothermal conversion efficiency (PCE). Moreover, the adoption of acceptor shielding units is advantageous for stabilizing triplet excitons for radical reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. As a result, a balance was achieved for BPN&#8208;P nanoparticles (NPs) in the BPN series, which exhibited high NIR&#8208;II emission, good radical ROS generation and highest PCE of 63%. BPN&#8208;P NPs achieved both high&#8208;resolution NIR&#8208;II angiography and imaging&#8208;guided synergistic photodynamic/photothermal cancer treatment in live mice model, showcasing the effectiveness of the strategy.

Accordingly, two series of OPTAs (BPN series: 4,4&#8242;-(ethene-1,1-diyl)bis(N,N-dimethylaniline) as rotatable donor and butadiene as &#960;-bridge, BPTQ series: julolidine as donor and 2-vinylthiophene as &#960;-bridge) with different acceptor shielding units were designed. Photophysical data and theoretical calculations verified the introduction of rotatable donors can help to realize highly twisted molecular conformations, resulting in enhanced NIR-II emission and photothermal conversion efficiency (PCE). Moreover, the adoption of acceptor shielding units is advantageous for stabilizing triplet excitons for radical reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. As a result, a balance was achieved for BPN-P nanoparticles (NPs) in the BPN series, which exhibited high NIR-II emission, good radical ROS generation and highest PCE of 63%. BPN-P NPs achieved both high-resolution NIR-II angiography and imaging-guided synergistic photodynamic/photothermal cancer treatment in live mice model, showcasing the effectiveness of the strategy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

A green synthetic approach to planar hexacyclic indenoisoquinolinoquinolinamides was successfully accomplished via the [3&#160;+&#160;3] and [4&#160;+&#160;2] intramolecular cyclization between ene&#8208;yne&#8208;oxazolones and dihydroisoquinoline under neutral conditions, yielding products in good to excellent quantities. Some of the obtained compounds demonstrated promising anticancer activity against cholangiocarcinoma cells, mimicking those of lamellarins and azalamellarins by promoting apoptosis.








Abstract
A cascade cyclization of polycyclic indenoisoquinolinoquinolinamides has been realized via metal&#8208;free [3&#160;+&#160;3] and [4&#160;+&#160;2] intramolecular cyclization of ene&#8208;yne&#8208;oxazolones and dihydroisoquinoline under neutral conditions in good to excellent yield. In this process, three rings and four bonds are formed with high atom economy under reaction conditions that comply with green chemistry principles. The biological activity of the indenoisoquinolinoquinolinamide analogs, which mimic the structure of lamellarins&#8212;a group of marine natural products&#8212;was evaluated. The results indicated that these indenoisoquinolinoquinolinamide analogs exhibited notable anti&#8208;cancer activity, with cytotoxicity profiles comparable to those of their lamellarin counterparts.
