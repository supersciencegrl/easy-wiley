         <title>Divergent Synthesis of Molecular Winch Prototypes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report the synthesis of conceptually new prototypes of molecular winches with the ultimate aim to investigate the work performed by a single ruthenium&#8208;based molecular motor anchored on a surface by probing its ability to pull a load upon electrically&#8208;driven directional rotation. According to a technomimetic design, the motor was embedded in a winch structure, with a long flexible polyethylene glycol chain terminated by an azide hook to connect a variety of molecular loads. The structure of the motor was first derivatized by means of two sequential cross&#8208;coupling reactions involving a penta(4&#8208;halogenophenyl)cyclopentadienyl hydrotris(indazolyl)borate ruthenium(II) precursor and the resulting benzylamine derivative was next exploited as key intermediate in the divergent synthesis of a family of nanowinch prototypes. A one&#8208;pot method involving sequential peptide coupling and Cu&#8208;catalyzed azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition was developed to yield four loaded nanowinches, with load fragments encompassing triptycene, fullerene and porphyrin moieties.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis and Characterisation of Luminescent [CrIII2L(&#956;&#8208;carboxylato)]3+ Complexes with High&#8208;Spin S = 3 Ground States (L = N6S2 donor ligand)</title>

         <dc:description>The synthesis, structure, magnetic, and photophysical properties of two dinuclear, luminescent, mixed&#8208;ligand [Cr  III  2  L(O  2  CR)]  3+  complexes (R = CH  3  (  1  ), Ph (  2  )) of a 24&#8208;membered binucleating hexa&#8208;aza&#8208;dithiophenolate macrocycle (L)  2&#8722;  are presented. X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis reveals an edge&#8208;sharing bioctahedral N  3  Cr(  &#956;  &#8208;SR)  2  (  &#956;  1,3  &#8208;O  2  CR)CrN  3  core structure with  &#956;  1,3  &#8208;bridging carboxylate groups. A ferromagnetic superexchange interaction between the electron spins of the Cr  3+  ions leads to a high&#8208;spin (  S  = 3) ground state. The coupling constants (  J  = +24.2(1) cm  &#8722;1  (  1  ), +34.8(4) cm  &#8722;1  (  2  ), H = &#8722;2  J  S  1  S  2  ) are significantly larger than in related  bis  &#8208;  &#956;  &#8208;alkoxido&#8208;  &#956;  &#8208;carboxylato structures. DFT calculations performed on both complexes reproduce both the sign and strength of the exchange interactions found experimentally.

         <title>Dinuclear Au(I), Au(II) and Au(III) Complexes with (CF2)n&#160;Chains: Insights into the Role of Aurophilic Interactions in the Au(I) Oxidation</title>

         <dc:description>New dinuclear Au(I), Au(II) and Au(III) complexes containing (CF  2  )  n  bridging chains were obtained. Metallomacrocycles [Au  2  {&#956;&#8208;(CF  2  )  4  }{&#956;&#8208;diphosphine}] show an uncommon figure&#8208;eight structure, whose helicity inversion barrier is influenced by aurophilic interactions and steric constraints imposed by the diphosphine. Halogenation of LAu(CF  2  )  4  AuL (L = PPh  3  , PMe  3  , (dppf)  1/2  , (binap)  1/2  ) gave [Au(II)]  2  species, some of which display unprecedented folded structures with Au&#8211;Au bonds. Aurophilic interactions facilitate this oxidation process by preorganizing the starting [Au(I)]  2  complexes and lowering its redox potential. The obtained [Au(II)]  2  complexes undergo thermal or photochemical elimination of R  3  PAuX to give Au(III) perfluorinated auracycles. Evidence of a radical mechanism for these decomposition reactions was obtained.</dc:description>

         <title>Type&#8208;II Clathrate Na24&#8208;&#948;Ge136 from a Redox&#8208;Preparation Route</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 50, Page 12776-12787, September 6, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The so far hardly accessible type&#8208;II clathrate Na24&#8208;&#948;Ge136 (&#948;&#8776;2) was obtained in an about 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 mass ratio with &#945;&#8208;Ge from Na12Ge17 by redox reaction with benzophenone and subsequent heat treatment of the widely X&#8208;ray amorphous intermediate. The phase is room&#8208;temperature transient, diamagnetic and shows metallic properties as revealed by Knight&#8208;shifted 23Na NMR signals and a Pauli&#8208;paramagnetic contribution to the magnetic susceptibility.







Abstract
The metastable type&#8208;II clathrate Na24&#8208;&#948;Ge136 was obtained from Na12Ge17 by applying a two&#8208;step procedure. At first, Na12Ge17 was reacted at 70&#8201;&#176;C with a solution of benzophenone in the ionic liquid (IL) 1,3&#8208;dibutyl&#8208;2&#8208;methylimidazolium&#8208;bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl) azanide. The IL was inert towards Na12Ge17, but capable of dissolving the sodium salts formed in the redox reaction. By annealing at 340&#8201;&#176;C under an argon atmosphere, the X&#8208;ray amorphous intermediate product was transformed to crystalline Na24&#8208;&#948;Ge136 (&#948;&#8776;2) and &#945;&#8208;Ge in an about 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 mass ratio. The product was characterized by X&#8208;ray powder diffraction, chemical analysis, and 23Na solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy. Metallic properties of Na24&#8208;&#948;Ge136 were revealed by a significant Knight shift of the 23Na NMR signals and by a Pauli&#8208;paramagnetic contribution to the magnetic susceptibility. At room temperature, Na24&#8208;&#948;Ge136 slowly ages, with a tendency to volume decrease and sodium loss.

         <dc:description>
Trifluoromethylselenolation of arenes was performed through a metal&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H functionalization. This pallado&#8208;catalyzed reaction was based on the use of 5&#8208;methoxy&#8208;8&#8208;amino&#8208;quinoline as directing group and trifluoromethyl tolueneselenosulfonate as trifluoromethylselenolating reagent. This method was also extended to fluoroalkylselenolation reactions.







Abstract
The synthesis of trifluoromethylselenolated aromatic molecules via an auxiliary&#8208;assisted, palladium catalyzed, C&#8722;H bonds functionalization with trifluoromethyl tolueneselenosulfonate as reagent is described. The mono&#8208; or bis&#8208;products can be preferentially formed. Some mechanistic investigations were realized to better understand the reaction. This methodology was also extended to fluoroalkylselenyl groups.

         <title>Azo&#8208;Functionalized Zirconium&#8208;Based Metal&#8722;Organic Polyhedron as an Efficient Catalyst for CO2 Fixation with Epoxides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 50, Page 12890-12899, September 6, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel zirconium&#8208;based metal organic polyhedron (MOP) with azo functionality has been synthesized and exhibits high catalytic activity for CO2 fixation. The azo group could enhance the solubility of the MOP as well as being good Lewis base sites to enrich CO2. DFT calculation showed Zr&#8208;AZDA MOP with the Lewis activity of Zr sites could dramatically reduce the energy barrier of CO2 cycloaddition.







Abstract
Chemical fixation of CO2 as C1 source at ambient temperature and low pressure is an energy&#8208;saving way to make use of the green&#8208;house gas, but it still remains a challenge since efficient catalyst with high catalytic active sites is required. Here, a novel monoclinic azo&#8208;functionalized Zr&#8208;based metal&#8722;organic polyhedron (Zr&#8208;AZDA) has been prepared and applied in CO2 fixation with epoxides. The inherent azo groups not only endow Zr&#8208;AZDA with good solubilization, but also act as basic sites to enrich CO2 showing efficient synergistic catalysis as confirmed by TPD&#8208;CO2 analysis. XPS results demonstrate that the Zr active sites in Zr&#8208;AZDA possess suitable Lewis acidity, which satisfies both substrates activation and products desorption. DFT calculation indicates the energy barrier of the rate&#8208;determining step in CO2 cycloaddition could be reduced remarkably (by ca. 60.9&#8201;%) in the presence of Zr&#8208;AZDA, which may rationalize the mild and efficient reaction condition employed (80&#8201;&#176;C and 1&#8197;atm of CO2). The work provides an effective multi&#8208;functional cooperative method for improvement of CO2 cycloaddition.

         <title>Spectroscopic and Computational Study of Boronium Ionic Liquids and Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 50, Page 12826-12834, September 6, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Detailed spectroscopic characterisation of Li metal battery ionic liquid (IL) electrolytes based on the boronium cations (trimethylamine)(dimethylethylamine)dihydroborate [NNBH2]+ and (tetramethylethylenediamine)dihydroborate [(TMEDA)BH2]+, and anions bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide [TFSI]&#8722; and bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide [FSI]&#8722; was achieved by using a combination of ATR&#8208;FTIR spectroscopy and DFT calculations. This work elucidated the Li cation coordination environment for the 0.5&#8197;mol&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;kg&#8722;1 LiTFSI or LiFSI&#8208;doped ILs and provided valuable information for future spectroscopic studies of the IL|Li metal interface.







Abstract
Boronium cation&#8208;based ionic liquids (ILs) have demonstrated high thermal stability and a &gt;5.8&#8197;V electrochemical stability window. Additionally, IL&#8208;based electrolytes containing the salt LiTFSI have shown stable cycling against the Li metal anode, the &#8220;Holy grail&#8221; of rechargeable lithium batteries. However, the basic spectroscopic characterisation needed for further development and effective application is missing for these promising ILs and electrolytes. In this work, attenuated total reflection Fourier transform infrared (ATR&#8208;FTIR) spectroscopy and density functional theory (DFT) calculations are used in combination to characterise four ILs and electrolytes based on the [NNBH2]+ and [(TMEDA)BH2]+ boronium cations and the [FSI]&#8722; and [TFSI]&#8722; anions. By using this combined experimental and computational approach, proper understanding of the role of different ion&#8208;ion interactions for the Li cation coordination environment in the electrolytes was achieved. Furthermore, the calculated vibrational frequencies assisted in the proper mode assignments for the ILs and in providing insights into the spectroscopic features expected at the interface created when they are adsorbed on a Li(001) surface. A reproducible synthesis procedure for [(TMEDA)BH2]+ is also reported. The fundamental findings presented in this work are beneficial for any future studies that utilise IL based electrolytes in next generation Li metal batteries.

         <title>PtM/MxBy (M=Ni, Co, Fe) Heterostructured Nanobundles as Advanced Electrocatalyst for Hydrogen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 50, Page 12851-12856, September 6, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
PtM/MxBy (M=Ni, Co, Fe) heterostructured nanobundles have been synthesized by a hydrothermal method and subsequent boride doping. The synergistic effect of heterostructured electrocatalysts facilitates electron transfer and hydrogen adsorption ensure the catalysts to possess excellent catalytic activity and stability for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). In addition, from the point of view of morphology, the PtM/MxBy NBs with 1D nanowire structure possess abundant active sites, high aspect ratios, which would undoubtedly boom the HER catalytic activity.







Abstract
Optimizing the electronic and synergistic effect of hybrid electrocatalysts based on Pt and Pt&#8208;based nanocatalysts is of tremendous importance towards a superior hydrogen evolution performance under both acidic and alkaline conditions. However, developing an ideal Pt&#8208;based hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) electrocatalyst with moderated electronic structure as well as strong synergistic effect is still a challenge. Herein, we fabricated boron (B)&#8208;doped PtNi nanobundles by a two&#8208;step method using NaBH4 as the boron source to obtain PtNi/Ni4B3 heterostructures with well&#8208;defined nanointerfaces between PtNi and Ni4B3, achieving an enhanced catalytic HER performance. Especially, the PtNi/Ni4B3 nanobundles (PtNi/Ni4B3 NBs) can deliver a current density of 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at the overpotential of 14.6 and 26.5&#8197;mV under alkaline and acidic media, respectively, as well as outstanding electrochemical stability over 40&#8197;h at the current density of 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Remarkably, this approach is also universal for the syntheses of PtCo/Co3B and PtFe/Fe49B with outstanding electrocatalytic HER performance.

         <title>Stability of AgIII towards Halides in Organosilver(III) Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 50, Page 12796-12806, September 6, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unexpectedly robust: We provide theoretical evidence and experimental proof of the unexpected stability of the AgIII&#8722;X bond with every halogen (X=F, Cl, Br and I) in the series of square&#8208;planar organosilver(III) derivatives [PPh4][(CF3)3AgX]. Unimolecular decomposition paths were analyzed by combined theoretical and experimental methods, whereby the two series of linear complexes [CF3AgX]&#8722; and [FAgX]&#8722; were detected. The first silver(III) azide was also prepared, isolated and structurally characterized.







Abstract
The involvement of silver in two&#8208;electron AgI/AgIII processes is currently emerging. However, the range of stability of the required and uncommon AgIII species is virtually unknown. Here, the stability of AgIII towards the whole set of halide ligands in the organosilver(III) complex frame [(CF3)3AgX]&#8722; (X=F, Cl, Br, I, At) is theoretically analyzed. The results obtained depend on a single factor: the nature of X. Even the softest and least electronegative halides (I and At) are found to form reasonably stable AgIII&#8722;X bonds. Our estimates were confirmed by experiment. The whole series of nonradiative halide complexes [PPh4][(CF3)3AgX] (X=F, Cl, Br, I) has been experimentally prepared and all its constituents have been isolated in pure form. The pseudohalides [PPh4][(CF3)3AgCN] and [PPh4][(CF3)3Ag(N3)] have also been isolated, the latter being the first silver(III) azido complex. Except for the iodo compound, all the crystal and molecular structures have been established by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction methods. The decomposition paths of the [(CF3)3AgX]&#8722; entities at the unimolecular level have been examined in the gas phase by multistage mass spectrometry (MSn). The experimental detection of the two series of mixed complexes [CF3AgX]&#8722; and [FAgX]&#8722; arising from the corresponding parent species [(CF3)3AgX]&#8722; demonstrate that the Ag&#8722;X bond is particularly robust. Our experimental observations are rationalized with the aid of theoretical methods. Smooth variation with the electronegativity of X is also observed in the thermolyses of bulk samples. The thermal stability in the solid state gradually decreases from X=F (145&#8201;&#176;C, dec.) to X=I (78&#8201;&#176;C, dec.) The experimentally established compatibility of AgIII with the heaviest halides is of particular relevance to silver&#8208;mediated or silver&#8208;catalyzed processes.

         <title>Perylene&#8208;Cy3 FRET System to Analyze Photoactive DNA Structures</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 50, Page 12845-12850, September 6, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) pair of perylene and Cy3 was developed. Distinct orientation and distance dependence of FRET efficiency were observed. This pair could be used to analyze the structure of photocrosslinked DNA owing to its longer excitation wavelength. This pair will be useful to analyze various photo&#8208;active DNA structures.







Abstract
We report a new F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) system for structural analyses of DNA duplexes using perylene and Cy3 as donor and acceptor, respectively, linked at the termini of a DNA duplex via D&#8208;threoninol. Experimentally obtained FRET efficiencies were in good agreement with theoretical values calculated based on canonical B&#8208;form DNA. Due to the relatively long F&#246;rster radius, this system can be used to analyze large DNA structures, and duplexes containing photo&#8208;reactive molecules can be analyzed since perylene can be excited with visible light. The system was used to analyze a DNA duplex containing stilbene, demonstrating that in the region of the stilbene cluster the duplex adopts a ladder&#8208;like structure rather than helical one. Upon photodimerization between stilbene residues, FRET efficiencies indicated the reaction does not disturb DNA duplex.

     alt="Perylene-Cy3 FRET System to Analyze Photoactive DNA Structures"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A F&#246;rster&lt;/b&gt; resonance energy transfer (FRET) pair of perylene and Cy3 was developed. Distinct orientation and distance dependence of FRET efficiency were observed. This pair could be used to analyze the structure of photocrosslinked DNA owing to its longer excitation wavelength. This pair will be useful to analyze various photo-active DNA structures.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We report a new F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) system for structural analyses of DNA duplexes using perylene and Cy3 as donor and acceptor, respectively, linked at the termini of a DNA duplex via D-threoninol. Experimentally obtained FRET efficiencies were in good agreement with theoretical values calculated based on canonical B-form DNA. Due to the relatively long F&#246;rster radius, this system can be used to analyze large DNA structures, and duplexes containing photo-reactive molecules can be analyzed since perylene can be excited with visible light. The system was used to analyze a DNA duplex containing stilbene, demonstrating that in the region of the stilbene cluster the duplex adopts a ladder-like structure rather than helical one. Upon photodimerization between stilbene residues, FRET efficiencies indicated the reaction does not disturb DNA duplex. This FRET system will be useful for analysis of photoreactions of nucleobases as well as a wide range of nucleic acid structures.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Making Aromatic Phosphorus Heterocycles More Basic and Nucleophilic: Synthesis, Characterization and Reactivity of the First Phosphinine Selenide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 50, Page 12788-12795, September 6, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis and isolation of a phosphinine selenide was achieved for the first time. The &#963;&#8208;electron donating Me3Si&#8208;substituents significantly increase the energy of the phosphorus lone pair and hence its basicity, making the heterocycle considerably more basic and nucleophilic than the unsubstituted phosphinine C5H5P, as confirmed by the calculated gas&#8208;phase basicities. The novel phosphinine selenides show a distinct reactivity towards dienophiles, Au(I)Cl as well as alcohols.







Abstract
The synthesis and isolation of a phosphinine selenide was achieved for the first time by reacting red selenium with 2,6&#8208;bis(trimethylsilyl)phosphinine. The rather large coupling constant of 1JP,Se=883&#8197;Hz is in line with a P&#8722;Se bond of high s&#8208;character. The &#963;&#8208;electron donating Me3Si&#8208;substituents significantly increase the energy of the phosphorus lone pair and hence its basicity, making the heterocycle considerably more basic and nucleophilic than the unsubstituted phosphinine C5H5P, as confirmed by the calculated gas phase basicities. NBO calculations further reveal that the lone pairs of the selenium atom are stabilized through donor&#8208;acceptor interactions with antibonding orbitals of the aromatic ring. The novel phosphinine selenide shows a distinct reactivity towards hexafluoro&#8208;2&#8208;butyne, Au(I)Cl as well as iPrOH. Our results pave the way for new perspectives in the chemistry of phosphorus in low coordination.

A low&#8208;temperature aminolytic route was designed to synthesize sub&#8208;10&#8197;nm CoFe2O4 nanoparticles (CFO NPs) with good dispersion through carefully exploiting the reaction of acetates and oleylamine (OAm). The well&#8208;dispersed 9.1&#8197;nm CFO NPs prepared by the aminolytic method exhibited excellent reversible capacity and superior cycling stability compared with those prepared by co&#8208;precipitation method, and the performance could be further enhanced when the size of nanoparticles decreased to 3.4&#8197;nm.







Abstract
Spinel ferrites are promising anode materials for lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) owing to their high theoretical specific capacities. However, their practical application is impeded by inherent low conductivity and severe volume expansion, which can be surpassed by increasing the surface&#8208;to&#8208;volume ratio of nanoparticles. Currently, most methods produce spinel ferrite nanoparticles with large size and severe aggregation, degrading their electrochemical performance. In this study, a low&#8208;temperature aminolytic route was designed to synthesize sub&#8208;10&#8197;nm CoFe2O4 nanoparticles with good dispersion through carefully exploiting the reaction of acetates and oleylamine. The performance of CoFe2O4 nanoparticles obtained by a traditional co&#8208;precipitation method was also investigated for comparison. This work demonstrates that CoFe2O4 nanoparticles synthesized by the aminolytic route are promising as anode materials for LIBs. Besides, this method can be extended to design other spinel ferrites for energy storage devices with superior performance by simply changing the starting material, such as MnFe2O4, MgFe2O4, ZnFe2O4, and so on.

F&#8208;SnO2&#8208;x&#8208;SnS2&#8208;x@N/S&#8208;RGO nanocomposite, which is featured by the heterostructures that originated from coupling SnO2 and SnS2, defects caused by F doping and VO/VS, is investigated as an anode for LIBs/SIBs. It renders extraordinary performances in both Li and Na ion batteries (LIBs, SIBs), due to the unique hierarchical structure and electronic characteristics. The rational designation is instructive to the exploitation of other similar anodes for superior Li/Na/K storage performance.







Abstract
Phase engineering of the electrode materials in terms of designing heterostructures, introducing heteroatom and defects, improves great prospects in accelerating the charge storage kinetics during the repeated Li+/Na+ insertion/deintercalation. Herein, a new design of Li/Na&#8208;ion battery anodes through phase regulating is reported consisting of F&#8208;doped SnO2&#8208;SnS2 heterostructure nanocrystals with oxygen/sulfur vacancies (VO/VS) anchored on a 2D sulfur/nitrogen&#8208;doped reduced graphene oxide matrix (F&#8208;SnO2&#8208;x&#8208;SnS2&#8208;x@N/S&#8208;RGO). Consequently, the F&#8208;SnO2&#8208;x&#8208;SnS2&#8208;x@N/S&#8208;RGO anode demonstrates superb high reversible capacity and long&#8208;term cycling stability. Moreover, it exhibits excellent great rate capability with 589&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 for Li+ and 296&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 5&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 for Na+. The enhanced Li/Na storage properties of the nanocomposites are not only attributed to the increase in conductivity caused by VO/VS and F doping (confirmed by DFT calculations) to accelerate their charge&#8208;transfer kinetics but also the increased interaction between F&#8208;SnO2&#8208;x&#8208;SnS2&#8208;x and Li/Na through heterostructure. Meanwhile, the hierarchical F&#8208;SnO2&#8208;x&#8208;SnS2&#8208;x@N/S&#8208;RGO network structure enables fast infiltration of electrolyte and improves electron/ion transportation in the electrode, and the corrosion resistance of F doping contributes to prolonged cycle stability.

Single&#8208;crystalline domains of microcrystalline intergrown oxonitridosilicate oxides Ba22.5+xLa55&#8722;x[Si129N240&#8722;xOx]O3 and Ba25.5+xLa77&#8722;x[Si170N312&#8722;xO9+x]O4 and related Sr analogues were identified by TEM. Diffraction data collected with microfocused synchrotron radiation reveal extraordinarily complex tetrahedra networks. This combination of analytical methods enables the characterization of new luminescent materials in heterogeneous powder samples.







Abstract
Single&#8208;crystalline domains in intergrown microcrystalline material of the new compounds Ba22.5+xLa55&#8722;x[Si129N240&#8722;xOx]O3:Ce3+ and Ba25.5+xLa77&#8722;x[Si170N312&#8722;xO9+x]O4:Ce3+ were identified by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Precise diffraction data from these domains were collected with microfocused synchrotron radiation so that crystal structure elucidation of the complex disordered networks became possible. They are composed of two different interconnected slabs of which one is similar in both compounds, which explains their notorious intergrowth. The distribution of Ba and La is indicated by the analysis of bond&#8208;valence sums and by comparison with isostructural Sr28.5+xLa75&#8722;x[Si170N312&#8722;xO9+x]O4. Ce3+ doping leads to yellow luminescence. This is a showcase that highlights the discovery and accurate characterization of new compounds relevant for luminescence applications from heterogeneous microcrystalline samples by exploiting the capability of the combination of TEM and diffraction using the latest focusing techniques for synchrotron radiation.

         <title>Redox Isomerism in the S3 State of the Oxygen&#8208;Evolving Complex Resolved by Coupled Cluster Theory</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 50, Page 12815-12825, September 6, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The domain&#8208;based local pair natural orbital&#8211;coupled cluster approach, DLPNO&#8208;CCSD(T), was employed to obtain reliable relative energetics for distinct redox&#8208;isomeric forms of the Mn4Ca cofactor of the oxygen&#8208;evolving complex of photosystem&#8197;II in its final metastable S3 state. It is shown that the MnIV4 oxo&#8208;hydroxo model is significantly more stable than the MnIII2MnIV2 peroxo model, thus disfavoring the scenario of early&#8208;onset O&#8722;O bond formation in biological water oxidation.







Abstract
The electronic and geometric structures of the water&#8208;oxidizing complex of photosystem II in the steps of the catalytic cycle that precede dioxygen evolution remain hotly debated. Recent structural and spectroscopic investigations support contradictory redox formulations for the active&#8208;site Mn4CaOx cofactor in the final metastable S3 state. These range from the widely accepted MnIV4 oxo&#8208;hydroxo model, which presumes that O&#8722;O bond formation occurs in the ultimate transient intermediate (S4) of the catalytic cycle, to a MnIII2MnIV2 peroxo model representative of the contrasting &#8220;early&#8208;onset&#8221; O&#8722;O bond formation hypothesis. Density functional theory energetics of suggested S3 redox isomers are inconclusive because of extreme functional dependence. Here, we use the power of the domain&#8208;based local pair natural orbital approach to coupled cluster theory, DLPNO&#8208;CCSD(T), to present the first correlated wave function theory calculations of relative stabilities for distinct redox&#8208;isomeric forms of the S3 state. Our results enabled us to evaluate conflicting models for the S3 state of the oxygen&#8208;evolving complex (OEC) and to quantify the accuracy of lower&#8208;level theoretical approaches. Our assessment of the relevance of distinct redox&#8208;isomeric forms for the mechanism of biological water oxidation strongly disfavors the scenario of early&#8208;onset O&#8722;O formation advanced by literal interpretations of certain crystallographic models. This work serves as a case study in the application of modern coupled cluster implementations to redox isomerism problems in oligonuclear transition metal systems.

         <title>Bulky Barbiturates as Non&#8208;Toxic Ionic Dye Insulators for Enhanced Emission in Polymeric Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 50, Page 12877-12883, September 6, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bulky hydrophobic anions based on fluorinated C&#8208;acyl barbiturates with delocalized negative charge are found to provide insulation of ionic dyes, thus preventing their aggregation&#8208;caused quenching in polymeric nanoparticles. Their chemical structure defines dye encapsulation, particle brightness and on/off switching. Compared to currently used anions, C&#8208;acyl barbiturates are non&#8208;toxic, while offering chemical availability and versatility.







Abstract
Bulky hydrophobic counterions (weakly coordinating anions) can insulate ionic dyes against aggregation&#8208;caused quenching (ACQ) and enable preparation of highly fluorescent dye&#8208;loaded nanoparticles (NPs) for bioimaging, biosensing and light harvesting. Here, we introduce a family of hydrophobic anions based on fluorinated C&#8208;acyl barbiturates with delocalized negative charge and bulky non&#8208;polar groups. Similarly to fluorinated tetraphenylborates, these barbiturates prevent ACQ of cationic dye alkyl rhodamine B inside polymer NPs made of biodegradable poly(lactic&#8208;co&#8208;glycolic acid) (PLGA). Their efficiency to prevent ACQ increases for analogues with higher acidity and bulkiness. Their structure controls dye&#8208;dye communication, yielding bright NPs with on/off switching or stable emission. They enhance dye encapsulation inside NPs, allowing intracellular imaging without dye leakage. Compared to fluorinated tetraphenylborates known as cytotoxic transmembrane ion transporters, the barbiturates display a significantly lower cytotoxicity. These chemically available and versatile barbiturate derivatives are promising counterion scaffolds for preparation of bright non&#8208;toxic fluorescent nanomaterials.

         <title>A Photo&#8208; and Redox&#8208;Driven Two&#8208;Directional Terthiazole&#8208;Based Switch: A Combined Experimental and Computational Investigation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 50, Page 12866-12876, September 6, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Molecular switches are key elements for the design of stimuli&#8208;responsive systems and materials. Of particular interest are switches that can be fully operated both by light and electricity, the two most popular inputs. It is shown for the first time that a terarylene photoswitch can be effectively transformed to an efficient photo and redox one when decorated with the electroactive N&#8208;methyl pyridinium group. The driving forces behind different switching processes are revealed by a joint experimental and theoretical approach.







Abstract
Terthiazoles with redox&#8208;active substituents like an N&#8208;methyl pyridinium group and ferrocene have been synthesized and their photo&#8208; and electro&#8208;chromic behaviors were investigated. The presence of two lateral N&#8208;methyl pyridinium substituents in the structure of terthiazole proved to be effective in inducing not only the reductive ring&#8208;closure of the terthiazole core but also its oxidative ring&#8208;opening reaction, leading to the first terarylene&#8208;based switch able to fully operate both photochemically and electrochemically. Moreover, the large increase in the redox potential between its open and closed form (700&#8197;mV) means that a part of the photon energy necessary to trigger the cyclization is stored in the form of chemical potential available for other works. Introduction of a second redox&#8208;active unit such as ferrocene onto the central thiazolyl moiety is found to inhibit the photochromism of the switch but not its redox switchability, which, instead, got improved for the ring&#8208;opening reaction via the redox properties of the ferrocenyl unit. The optical and redox properties of the switch in its different oxidation states are analyzed with the aid of DFT calculations in order to rationalize different switching processes.

         <title>Application of the Redox&#8208;Transmetalation Procedure to Access Divalent Lanthanide and Alkaline&#8208;Earth NHC Complexes**
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 50, Page 12857-12865, September 6, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Redox&#8208;transmetalation is the key: NHC complexes of divalent lanthanides (Sm, Eu, Yb) and alkaline&#8208;earth metals (Ca, Sr) have been accessed by a redox&#8208;transmetalation strategy from NHC&#8208;AgI complexes, a viable procedure when the classical and non&#8208;redox transmetalation methodology fails to proceed. Trends in the bonding of the NHC ligands were established from a detailed experimental and computational analysis.







Abstract
Divalent lanthanide and alkaline&#8208;earth complexes supported by N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) ligands have been accessed by redox&#8208;transmetalation between air&#8208;stable NHC&#8208;AgI complexes and the corresponding metals. By using the small ligand 1,3&#8208;dimethylimidazol&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene (IMe), two series of isostructural complexes were obtained: the tetra&#8208;NHC complexes [LnI2(IMe)4] (Ln=Eu and Sm) and the bis&#8208;NHC complexes [MI2(IMe)2(THF)2] (M=Yb, Ca and Sr). In the former, distortions in the NHC coordination were found to originate from intermolecular repulsions in the solid state. Application of the redox&#8208;transmetalation strategy with the bulkier 1,3&#8208;dimesitylimidazol&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene (IMes) ligand yielded [SrI2(IMes)(THF)3], while using a similar procedure with Ca metal led to [CaI2(THF)4] and uncoordinated IMes. DFT calculations were performed to rationalise the selective formation of the bis&#8208;NHC adduct in [SrI2(IMe)2(THF)2] and the tetra&#8208;NHC adduct in [SmI2(IMe)4]. Since the results in the gas phase point towards preferential formation of the tetra&#8208;NHC complexes for both metal centres, the differences between both arrangements are a result of solid&#8208;state effects such as slightly different packing forces.

&lt;p&gt;Divalent lanthanide and alkaline-earth complexes supported by N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC) ligands have been accessed by redox-transmetalation between air-stable NHC-AgI complexes and the corresponding metals. By using the small ligand 1,3-dimethylimidazol-2-ylidene (IMe), two series of isostructural complexes were obtained: the tetra-NHC complexes [LnI&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(IMe)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;] (Ln=Eu and Sm) and the bis-NHC complexes [MI&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(IMe)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(THF)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;] (M=Yb, Ca and Sr).

         <title>Phosphate&#8208;Based Self&#8208;Immolative Linkers for Tuneable Double Cargo Release</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 50, Page 12763-12775, September 6, 2021. </description>

A matter of timing: Phosphate&#8208;based self&#8208;immolative linkers that are suitable for tuneable double cargo release allow 1) programmable slow&#8208;release of the one cargo in 3&#8197;hours, 2) simultaneous release of both cargos within 25&#8197;minutes or 3) sequential release of the first cargo within 15&#8197;minutes followed by the second cargo release within 3&#8197;hours. Optimised linkers are stable and could find further applications in the design of innovative materials and multiple&#8208;drug&#8208;delivery systems.







Abstract
Phosphorus&#8208;based self&#8208;immolative (SI) linkers offer a wide range of applications, such as smart materials and drug&#8208;delivery systems. Phosphorus SI linkers are ideal candidates for double&#8208;cargo delivery platforms because they have a higher valency than carbon. A series of substituted phosphate linkers was designed for releasing two phenolic cargos through SI followed by chemical hydrolysis. Suitable modifications of the lactate spacer increased the cargo release rate significantly, from 1&#8197;day to 2&#8197;hours or 5&#8197;minutes, as shown for linkers containing p&#8208;fluoro phenol. In turn, double cargo linkers bearing p&#8208;methyl phenol released their cargo more slowly (4&#8197;days, 4&#8197;hours, and 15&#8197;minutes) than their p&#8208;fluoro analogues. The &#945;&#8208;hydroxyisobutyrate linker released both cargos in 25&#8197;minutes. Our study expands the current portfolio of SI constructs by providing a double cargo delivery option, which is crucial to develop universal SI platforms.

Given the role of nitric oxide in human physiology and pathophysiology, its controlled delivery has therapeutic applications. Site&#8208; and dosage&#8208;controlled release of this free radical from caging compounds by light activation can determine its biological effects. NO release with concomitant fluorescence allows easy, real&#8208;time tracking of NO in a non&#8208;invasive fashion even in cells. For more details, see the Review by S. Sortino et&#8197;al. on page 12714&#8197;ff.

         <title>Cover Feature: Stability of AgIII towards Halides in Organosilver(III) Complexes (Chem. Eur. J. 50/2021)</title>

Surprising silver: The binary silver(I) halides, AgX, are well&#8208;known chemical species. In contrast, the only binary halide of silver(III) currently known is the fluoride AgF3. The CF3 group provides a suitable frame to stabilise silver(III) compounds with every halogen; these have been isolated and thoroughly characterised. Multistage unimolecular fragmentation experiments demonstrate that the Ag&#8722;X bond is surprisingly robust. The sobriety of silver thus perfectly matches the colourful variety of halogens. More information can be found in the Full Paper by B. Menj&#243;n et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202101859).

         <dc:description>
Phosphorus&#8208;based self&#8208;immolative linkers activated by light sequentially release two phenolic cargos. Structurally modifying the lactate spacer responsible for self&#8208;immolation allows adjustable cargo release, ranging from minutes to days. The cargo release rate can be additionally tuned by varying the cargos. NMR spectroscopy coupled to UV light illumination enabled us to track and characterize products released during the self&#8208;immolation process. More information can be found in the Full Paper by E. Proch&#225;zkov&#225;, O. Baszczy&#328;ski, et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202101805).

In the metastable type&#8208;II clathrate Na24&#8211;&#948;Ge136, a Ge framework forms 20&#8208; and 28&#8208;atom cages (drawn with gray and bluish faces) hosting the Na guest atoms. The stopwatch hands give the actual number of Na atoms found per unit cell. In type&#8208;II clathrates, the guest atoms arrange with hierarchical relation to the C15 Laves phase and the oxygen partial structure of &#946;&#8208;Cristobalite. The latter is shown by white lines between Na atoms, turning red where only this partial structure is drawn. More information can be found in the Full Paper by B. B&#246;hme et&#8197;al.

         <title>Cover Feature: Making Aromatic Phosphorus Heterocycles More Basic and Nucleophilic: Synthesis, Characterization and Reactivity of the First Phosphinine Selenide (Chem. Eur. J. 50/2021)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 50, Page 12711-12711, September 6, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The very low basicity and nucleophilicity of the phosphorus donor in phosphinines can be drastically increased by introducing strongly &#963;&#8208;donating Me3Si substituents to the aromatic phosphorus heterocycle. The highest gas&#8208;phase basicity was found for 2,3,5,6&#8208;tetrakis(trimethylsilyl)phosphinine, which is even more basic in the gas phase than pyridine. This finding led to the first quantitative synthesis of a phosphinine selenide by treating red selenium with 2,6&#8208;bis(trimethylsilyl)phosphinine. More information can be found in the Full Paper by T. B&#246;ttcher, C. M&#252;ller, et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202102390).

Tracking your delivery: Molecular constructs are able to combine light&#8208;regulated release of nitric oxide (NO) with fluorescent reporting functionality to track and quantify in real time the amount of NO delivered, even in complex biological environments, are described, highlighting the logical design and their potential therapeutic applications.







Abstract
Nitric oxide (NO) plays a multifaceted role in human physiology and pathophysiology, and its controlled delivery has great prospects in therapeutic applications. The light&#8208;activated uncaging of NO from NO caging compounds allows this free radical to be released with accurate control of site and dosage, which strictly determine its biological effects. Molecular constructs able to activate fluorescence concomitantly to NO release offer the important advantage of easy and real&#8208;time tracking of the amount of NO uncaged in a non&#8208;invasive fashion even in the cell environment. This contribution provides an overview of the advances in photoactivatable NO releasers bearing fluorescent reporting functionalities achieved in our and other laboratories, highlighting the rationale design and their potential therapeutic applications.

         <title>Insights from Binding on Quadruplex Selective Carbazole Ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 50, Page 12726-12736, September 6, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A summary is provided of the most promising carbazole ligands that have been established as effective G&#8208;quadruplex binders. The focus is made on the structural design of carbazole ligands and on NMR analysis of carbazole&#8208;G4 interactions with particular attention to the variety in binding modes shown by the carbazole ligands. Further, a brief view on biophysical and biological data of their molecular interactions with G&#8208;quadruplexes has been discussed.







Abstract
Polymorphic G&#8208;quadruplex (G4) secondary DNA structures have received increasing attention in medicinal chemistry owing to their key involvement in the regulation of the maintenance of genomic stability, telomere length homeostasis and transcription of important proto&#8208;oncogenes. Different classes of G4 ligands have been developed for the potential treatment of several human diseases. Among them, the carbazole scaffold with appropriate side chain appendages has attracted much interest for designing G4 ligands. Because of its large and rigid &#960;&#8208;conjugation system and ease of functionalization at three different positions, a variety of carbazole derivatives have been synthesized from various natural or synthetic sources for potential applications in G4&#8208;based therapeutics and biosensors. Herein, we provide an updated close&#8208;up of the literatures on carbazole&#8208;based G4 ligands with particular focus given on their detailed binding insights studied by NMR spectroscopy. The structure&#8208;activity relationships and the opportunities and challenges of their potential applications as biosensors and therapeutics are also discussed. This review will provide an overall picture of carbazole ligands with remarkable G4 topological preference, fluorescence properties and significant bioactivity; portraying carbazole as a very promising scaffold for assembling G4 ligands with a range of novel functional applications.

         <title>Asymmetric Synthesis of Multi&#8208;Substituted Tetrahydrofurans via Palladium/Rhodium Synergistic Catalyzed [3+2] Decarboxylative Cycloaddition of Vinylethylene Carbonates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 50, Page 12742-12746, September 6, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multimetallic cooperative catalysis represents one of the most efficient method for asymmetric C&#8722;C and C&#8208;heteroatom bond forming transformations. An enantioselective [3+2] cycloaddition reaction catalyzed synergistically by the combination of an achiral palladium catalyst and a chiral&#8208;at&#8208;metal rhodium(III) complex has been developed, generating a series of 1,2,3,3&#8208;tetrasubstituted tetrahydrofurans in high yields and stereoselectivities (&gt;20&#8201;:&#8201;1 d.r., up to 99&#8201;% ee).







Abstract
Unlike the comprehensive development of tandem multi&#8208;metallic catalysis, bimetallic synergistic catalysis has been challenging to achieve high stereoselectivity with the generation of multi&#8208;stereogenic centers. Herein, an efficient synergistic catalysis for the diastereo&#8208; and enantioselective synthesis of multi&#8208;substituted tetrahydrofuran derivatives has been developed. Under mild reaction conditions, a series of target molecules with three consecutive stereocenters were synthesized by a palladium(0)/rhodium(III) bimetal&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric decarboxylative [3+2]&#8208;cycloaddition of vinylethylene carbonates with &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated carbonyl compounds. The corresponding adducts were obtained with moderate to high yields (67&#8201;%&#8764;98&#8201;%) and excellent stereoselectivities (&gt;20&#8201;:&#8201;1 d.r., up to 99&#8201;% ee).

         <title>Highly Efficient Trityl&#8208;Nitroxide Biradicals for Biomolecular High&#8208;Field Dynamic Nuclear Polarization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 50, Page 12758-12762, September 6, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
New trityl&#8208;nitroxide biradicals, dubbed SNAPols, show maximal dynamic nuclear polarization enhancement factors at 18.8 T of &gt;100 in small molecules and globular proteins and also exhibit strong enhancements in membrane proteins and cellular preparations. Thus, SNAPols show great application potential in high&#8208;field DNP/ssNMR spectroscopy, especially for complex biomolecules.







Abstract
Dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) is a powerful method to enhance the sensitivity of solid&#8208;state magnetic nuclear resonance (ssNMR) spectroscopy. However, its biomolecular applications at high magnetic fields (preferably&gt;14&#8197;T) have so far been limited by the intrinsically low efficiency of polarizing agents and sample preparation aspects. Herein, we report a new class of trityl&#8208;nitroxide biradicals, dubbed SNAPols that combine high DNP efficiency with greatly enhanced hydrophilicity. SNAPol&#8208;1, the best compound in the series, shows DNP enhancement factors at 18.8 T of more than 100 in small molecules and globular proteins and also exhibits strong DNP enhancements in membrane proteins and cellular preparations. By integrating optimal sensitivity and high resolution, we expect widespread applications of this new polarizing agent in high&#8208;field DNP/ssNMR spectroscopy, especially for complex biomolecules.

         <title>Low&#8208;Concentration C2H6 Capture Enabled by Size Matching in the Ultramicropore</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 50, Page 12753-12757, September 6, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recorded C2H6adsorption at low concentration was achieved by precisely size matching in an ultramicroporous metal&#8211;organic framework. Low&#8208;Concentration Ethane Capture Enabled by Size Matching in the Ultramicropore (Chen et&#8197;al.).







Abstract
Low&#8208;concentration ethane capture is crucial for environmental protection and natural gas purification. The ideal physisorbent with strong C2H6 interaction and large C2H6 uptake at low&#8208;concentration level has rarely been reported, due to the large pKa value and small quadrupole moment of C2H6. Herein, we demonstrate the perfectly size matching between the ultramicropore (pore size of 4.6&#8197;&#197;) and ethane (kinetic diameter of 4.4&#8197;&#197;) in a nickel pyridine&#8208;4&#8208;carboxylate metal&#8211;organic framework (IISERP&#8208;MOF2), which enables the record&#8208;breaking performance for low concentration C2H6 capture. IISERP&#8208;MOF2 exhibits the large C2H6 adsorption enthalpy of 56.7&#8197;kJ/mol, and record&#8208;high C2H6 uptake at low pressure of 0.01&#8211;0.1&#8197;bar and 298&#8197;K (1.8&#8197;mmol/g at 0.01&#8197;bar). Molecule simulations and C2H6&#8208;loading crystal structure analysis revealed that the maximized interaction sites in IISERP&#8208;MOF2 with ethane molecule originates the strong C2H6 adsorption. The dynamic breakthrough experiments for gas mixtures of C2H6/N2(1/999, v/v) and C2H6/CH4 (5/95, v/v) proved the excellent low&#8208;concentration C2H6 capture performance.

The covalent adduct formation of the oxidative lesions and epigenetic bases 5&#8208;formyl&#8208;deoxyuridine (fdU) and 5&#8208;formyl&#8208;deoxycytidine (fdC) was investigated comparatively arguing that oxidative stress can have transcriptional consequences.







Abstract
5&#8208;Formyl&#8208;deoxyuridine (fdU) and 5&#8208;formyl&#8208;deoxycytidine (fdC) are formyl&#8208;containing nucleosides that are created by oxidative stress in differentiated cells. While fdU is almost exclusively an oxidative stress lesion formed from deoxythymidine (T), the situation for fdC is more complex. Next to formation as an oxidative lesion, it is particularly abundant in stem cells, where it is more frequently formed in an epigenetically important oxidation reaction performed by &#945;&#8208;ketoglutarate dependent TET enzymes from 5&#8208;methyl&#8208;deoxycytidine (mdC). Recently, it was shown that genomic fdC and fdU can react with the &#1013;&#8208;aminogroups of nucleosomal lysines to give Schiff base adducts that covalently link nucleosomes to genomic DNA. Here, we show that fdU features a significantly higher reactivity towards lysine side chains compared with fdC. This result shows that depending on the amounts of fdC and fdU, oxidative stress may have a bigger impact on nucleosome binding than epigenetics.

         <dc:description>Monoalkylated derivatives of the unusually polar all&#8208;  cis  2,3,4,5,6&#8208; pentafluorocyclohexyl (Janus face) motif are prepared starting from an aryl hydrogenation of 2,3,4,5,6&#8208; pentafluorophenylacetate methyl ester  15  .

The resultant Janus pentafluorocyclohexylacetate methyl ester  16  was converted to the corresponding alcohol  18  , aldehyde  13  , bromide  29  and azide  14  through functional group manipulations, and some of these building blocks were used in Ugi&#8208;multicomponent and Cu&#8208;catalysed click reactions.

         <title>The Influence of Secondary Interactions on the [N&#8722;I&#8722;N]+ Halogen Bond</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Halogen bond&#8208;stabilized halonium ions are mild halenium transfer agents. The dependence of their reactivity on chelation, strain, steric hindrance and electrostatic interaction has been evaluated using NMR, DFT and kinetics experiments. The mechanistic analysis of the transfer is expected to provide a handle in the induction of stereoselectivity in electrophilic halogenations.







Abstract
[Bis(pyridine)iodine(I)]+ complexes offer controlled access to halonium ions under mild conditions. The reactivity of such stabilized halonium ions is primarily determined by their three&#8208;center, four&#8208;electron [N&#8722;I&#8722;N]+ halogen bond. We studied the importance of chelation, strain, steric hindrance and electrostatic interaction for the structure and reactivity of halogen bonded halonium ions by acquiring their 15N NMR coordination shifts and measuring their iodenium release rates, and interpreted the data with the support of DFT computations. A bidentate ligand stabilizes the [N&#8722;I&#8722;N]+ halogen bond, decreasing the halenium transfer rate. Strain weakens the bond and accordingly increases the release rate. Remote modifications in the backbone do not influence the stability as long as the effect is entirely steric. Incorporating an electron&#8208;rich moiety close by the [N&#8722;I&#8722;N]+ motif increases the iodenium release rate. The analysis of the iodine(I) transfer mechanism highlights the impact of secondary interactions, and may provide a handle on the induction of stereoselectivity in electrophilic halogenations.

         <title>A Water Soluble Pd2L4 Cage for Selective Binding of Neu5Ac</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The carbohydrate binding pocket of an organic soluble [Pd2L4]4+ cage could be equipped with guanidinium&#8208;terminating dendrons to give the water soluble [Pd2L4][NO3]16 cage. It was shown by means of NMR spectroscopy that the cage binds selectively to anionic monosaccharides and strongest to Neu5Ac with Ka=24&#8197;M&#8722;1. The cage had low to no affinity for the thirteen neutral saccharides studied.







Abstract
The sialic acid N&#8208;acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac) and its derivatives are involved in many biological processes including cell&#8208;cell recognition and infection by influenza. Molecules that can recognize Neu5Ac might thus be exploited to intervene in or monitor such events. A key obstacle in this development is the sparse availability of easily prepared molecules that bind to this carbohydrate in its natural solvent; water. Here, we report that the carbohydrate binding pocket of an organic soluble [Pd2L4]4+ cage could be equipped with guanidinium&#8208;terminating dendrons to give the water soluble [Pd2L4][NO3]16 cage 7. It was shown by means of NMR spectroscopy that 7 binds selectively to anionic monosaccharides and strongest to Neu5Ac with Ka=24&#8197;M&#8722;1. The cage had low to no affinity for the thirteen neutral saccharides studied. Aided by molecular modeling, the selectivity for anionic carbohydrates such as Neu5Ac could be rationalized by the presence of charge assisted hydrogen bonds and/or the presence of a salt bridge with a guanidinium solubilizing arm of 7. Establishing that a simple coordination cage such as 7 can already selectively bind to Neu5Ac in water paves the way to improve the stability, affinity and/or selectivity properties of M2L4 cages for carbohydrates and other small molecules.

         <title>Multistimuli&#8208;Responsive [3]Dioxaphosphaferrocenophanes with Orthogonal Switches</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
&#8220;Double switch&#8221;: Novel redox&#8208;active and proton&#8208;sensitive phosphine ligands in conjunction with their metal complexes are reported. The donating capabilities can be switched orthogonally and reversibly by either protonation or oxidation. Application in Rh&#8208;catalysed hydrosilylation showed that they influence either the rate of conversion and/or the product distribution.







Abstract
Novel multistimuli&#8208;responsive phosphine ligands comprising a redox&#8208;active [3]dioxaphosphaferrocenophane backbone and a P&#8208;bound imidazolin&#8208;2&#8208;ylidenamino entity that allows switching by protonation are reported. Investigation of the corresponding metal complexes and their redox behaviour are reported and show the sensitivity of the system towards protonation and metal coordination. The experimental findings are supported by DFT calculations. Protonation and oxidation events are applied in Rh&#8208;catalysed hydrosilylations and demonstrate a remarkable influence on reactivity and/or selectivity.

         <title>Effectiveness of the Oxygenation over Classical Protonolysis Reactions: A Case of Alkylzinc Complexes Incorporating an Aminoalcoholate Ligand</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The stepwise controlled oxygenation of a tert&#8208;butylzinc complex incorporating a pridinolum (prinol) ligand affords a dinuclear adduct of a (prinol)ZnOOR moiety with the parent tBuZn(prinol) complex and a novel dimer [tBuOOZn(prinol)]2 with terminal alkylperoxide groups. Strikingly, these seemingly simple zinc alkylperoxides and related zinc alkoxides are not accessible via the classical protonolysis route.







Abstract
Alkylzinc aminoalcoholates have emerged as powerful catalysts in organic synthesis and polymerization processes. Despite extensive research, difficulties in the rational design of these catalytic systems and in&#8208;depth understanding of their modes of action have hitherto been encountered. Most of the major obstacles stem largely from the relatively limited knowledge of the structure&#8208;activity relationship of zinc catalysts. In fact, the key active species are often generated in&#8197;situ via the protonolysis of the alkylzinc precursors, which precludes their isolation and detailed characterization. Herein, the effectiveness of the oxygenation over the classical protonolysis in the synthesis of zinc alkylperoxides stabilized by an aminoalcoholate ligand is demonstrated. The controlled oxygenation of a tert&#8208;butylzinc complex incorporating a pridinolum (prinol) ligand leads to well&#8208;defined a dinuclear adduct of a (prinol)ZnOOtBu moiety with the parent tBuZn(prinol) complex and a novel dimer [tBuOOZn(prinol)]2 with terminal alkylperoxide groups. The observed reaction outcomes strongly depend on the reaction conditions. Although sparse examples of heteroleptic adducts of the [RZn(L)]x[ROOZn(L)]y&#8208;type are known, the herein reported homoleptic [ROOZn(L)]x aggregate is unprecedented. Strikingly, comparative studies involving reactions between tBuZn(prinol) and tert&#8208;butylhydroperoxide or ethanol revealed that the respective seemingly simple zinc alkylperoxides, or zinc alkoxides, respectively, are not accessible via the classical alcoholysis. We believe that these game&#8208;changing results concerning multifaceted chemistry of organozinc aminoalcoholates should pave the way for more rational development of various Zn&#8208;based catalytic systems.

         <title>Halogen&#8208;Bonding Strapped Porphyrin BODIPY Rotaxanes for Dual Optical and Electrochemical Anion Sensing</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first examples of porphyrin&#8208;BODIPY halogen bonding [2]rotaxanes have been prepared according to an active metal template strategy. Capitalising on the augmented anion affinities by virtue of axle triazole ligation to macrocyclic zinc(II) metalloporphyrin, the incorporation of fluorogenic BODIPY and redox&#8208;active porphyrin transducing groups allows dual&#8208;channel sensing of anions by quenching BODIPY emission and through cathodic perturbations of porphyrin oxidation redox couples.







Abstract
Anion receptors employing two distinct sensory mechanisms are rare. Herein, we report the first examples of halogen&#8208;bonding porphyrin BODIPY [2]rotaxanes capable of both fluorescent and redox electrochemical sensing of anions. 1H NMR, UV/visible and electrochemical studies revealed rotaxane axle triazole group coordination to the zinc(II) metalloporphyrin&#8208;containing macrocycle component, serves to preorganise the rotaxane binding cavity and dramatically enhances anion binding affinities. Mechanically bonded, integrated&#8208;axle BODIPY and macrocycle strapped metalloporphyrin motifs enable the anion recognition event to be sensed by the significant quenching of the BODIPY fluorophore and cathodic perturbations of the metalloporphyrin P/P+. redox couple.

         <dc:description>
Making a transfer: An iron&#8208;catalyzed, aerobic, biomimetic oxidation of various N&#8208;heterocycles by using the bifunctional hybrid catalyst Co(Salophen)&#8208;HQ as an electron&#8208;transfer mediator (ETM) is reported. The reaction provides various important aromatic heterocycles in good&#8208;to&#8208;excellent yields. The dehydrogenation involves several electron&#8208;transfer steps that are inspired by biological oxidation processes in which molecular oxygen (O2) is used as terminal oxidant.







Abstract
Herein, an iron(II)&#8208;catalyzed biomimetic oxidation of N&#8208;heterocycles under aerobic conditions is described. The dehydrogenation process, involving several electron&#8208;transfer steps, is inspired by oxidations occurring in the respiratory chain. An environmentally friendly and inexpensive iron catalyst together with a hydroquinone/cobalt Schiff base hybrid catalyst as electron&#8208;transfer mediator were used for the substrate&#8208;selective dehydrogenation reaction of various N&#8208;heterocycles. The method shows a broad substrate scope and delivers important heterocycles in good&#8208;to&#8208;excellent yields.

         <title>Impact of surface defects on LaNiO3 perovskite electrocatalysts for oxygen evolution reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Perovskite oxides are regarded as promising electrocatalysts for water splitting due to their cost&#8208;effectiveness, high efficiency and durability in the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Despite these advantages, a fundamental understanding of how critical structural parameters of perovskite electrocatalysts influences their activity and stability is lacking. Here, we investigate the impact of structural defects on OER performance for representative LaNiO  3  perovskite electrocatalysts. Hydrogen reduction of 700 &#176;C calcined LaNiO  3  induces a high density of surface oxygen vacancies, and confers significantly enhanced OER activity and stability compared to unreduced LaNiO  3  ; the former exhibit a low onset overpotential of  380 mV at 10 mA.cm  &#8208;2  and a small Tafel slope of 70.8 mV.dec  &#8208;1  . Oxygen vacancy formation is accompanied by mixed Ni  2+  /Ni  3+  valence states, which quantum&#8208;chemical DFT calculations reveal modify the perovskite electronic structure. Surface oxygen vacancy formation is relatively facile, and favoured over lattice vacancy formation, and increases the electronic conductivity of reduced LaNiO  3  , in accordance with the enhanced OER activity observed.</dc:description>

         <title>Water&#8208;Assisted Chemical Route Towards the Oxygen Evolution Reaction at the Hydrated (110) Ruthenium Oxide Surface: heterogeneous catalysis via DFT&#8208;MD&#160;&amp;&#160;metadynamics simulations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Notwithstanding RuO 2&#160; is one of the most active catalysts toward oxygen evolution reaction (OER), a plethora of fundamental details on its catalytic properties are still elusive, severely limiting its large&#8208;scale deployment. Herein, spin&#8208;polarized Density Functional Theory Molecular Dynamics (DFT&#8208;MD) simulations, coupled with advanced enhanced sampling methods in the well&#8208;tempered metadynamics framework, are applied to gain a global understanding of RuO 2&#160; aqueous interface (explicit water solvent) in catalyzing the OER, and hence possibly help in the design of novel catalysts in the context of photochemical water oxidation. The present study quantitatively assesses the free&#8208;energy barriers behind the OER at the (110)&#8208;RuO 2&#160; catalyst surface revealing plausible pathways composing the reaction network of the O 2&#160; evolution. In particular, OER is investigated at room temperature when such a surface is exposed to both gas&#8208;phase and liquid&#8208;phase water. Albeit a unique efficient pathway has been identified in the gas&#8208;phase OER, a surprisingly lowest&#8208;free&#8208;energy&#8208;requiring reaction route is possible when (110)&#8208;RuO 2&#160; is in contact with explicit liquid water. By estimating the free&#8208;energy surfaces associated to these processes, we reveal a&#160;water&#8208;assisted OER mechanism which involves a crucial proton&#8208;transfer&#8208;step assisted by the local water environment. These findings pave the way toward the systematic usage of those techniques for the fine assessment of the activity of catalysts, considering finite&#8208;temperature and explicit&#8208;solvent effects.</dc:description>

         <title>Pathway&#8208;Dependent Phase Transitions of Supramolecular Self&#8208;assemblies Containing Cationic Amphiphiles with Azobenzene and Disulfide Groups</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The original molecular crystals containing cationic amphiphiles with azobenzene and disulfide groups showed different phase transitions depending on the application order of a reduction agent and light irradiation. The current molecular system can provide a methodology for developing new stimuli&#8208;responsive materials that exhibit the desirable properties under specific circumstances from a systems chemistry viewpoint.







Abstract
There have been several attempts to construct supramolecular chemical systems that mimic the phase transitions in living systems. However, most of these phase transitions are one&#8208;to&#8208;one and induced by one stimulus or chemical; there have been few reports on the pathway&#8208;dependent phase transition of supramolecular self&#8208;assemblies in multi&#8208;step. To induce multistep phase transitions, molecular crystals were prepared that contained a cationic amphiphile bearing azobenzene and disulfide groups. A reducing agent caused the crystals to become vesicles, and adjacent, non&#8208;touching vesicles fused under UV and subsequent visible light. Adding a reducing agent to the worm&#8208;like aggregates that were generated after UV irradiation of the original crystals resulted in the growth of sheet&#8208;like aggregates. 1H NMR and fluorescence anisotropy measurements showed that a series of phase transitions was induced by changes in the phase structures from molecular conversions of the reactive amphiphiles. The multiple pathway&#8208;dependent phase transitions of supramolecular self&#8208;assemblies can provide a methodology for developing new stimuli&#8208;responsive materials that exhibit the desirable properties under specific circumstances from a systems chemistry viewpoint.

         <title>Ternary Hybrid Perovskite Solid Solution Single Crystals: Growth, Composition Determination and Phase Stability in Highly Moist Atmosphere</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two&#8208;centimeter&#8208;sized ternary hybrid perovskite solid solution single crystals have been grown. Wavelength disperse X&#8208;ray fluorescence is used as a quantitative elemental analysis method. The crystals with optimized composition show superior phase stability when they are stored in high&#8208;humidity environment for over two weeks, while those Cs&#8208;richer or Cs&#8208;poorer samples undergo various degrees of phase segregation induced by moisture.







Abstract
Ternary hybrid perovskite solid solutions have shown superior optoelectronic properties and better stability than their ABX3 simple perovskite counterparts under ambient conditions. However, crystal growth and identification of the accurate composition of these complex crystalline compounds remain challenging, and their stability under extreme conditions such as in highly moist atmosphere is unknown. Herein, large&#8208;size (up to 2&#8197;cm) single crystals of ternary perovskite 0.80FAPbI3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;x&#8242;FAPbBr3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;y&#8242;CsPbI3 (x&#8242;+y&#8242;=0.20) are grown. An elemental analysis method based on wavelength dispersive X&#8208;ray fluorescence is proposed to determine their accurate compositions. Among these single crystals, the composition with y&#8242;=0.12 shows the best moisture stability at 90&#8201;% relative humidity for 15&#8197;days. Other components with richer or poorer Cs+ ions undergo different phase segregation behaviours. The performance and stability of photodetectors based on these single crystals are tested. This work offers a deeper insight into phase stability of ternary hybrid perovskite solid solution crystals in highly moist atmosphere.

         <title>Oxidatively Induced Selective Carbon&#8208;Carbon Bond Formation From Isolated Rhodium(III) Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In the oxidation&#8208;induced reaction based on octahedral RhIII complexes synthesized from Rh2(TFA)4 with 2&#8208;arylpyridines, different regioselective C&#8722;C bond formations were achieved by changing the steric and electronic properties of the aryl ligands. This study provides feasible selective activation of C&#8722;H bonds by the oxidation induction of RhIII complexes, which may be useful for the design of new rhodium metal catalysts and development of efficient and highly selective reactions.







Abstract
This work focuses on oxidatively induced regioselective intramolecular C&#8722;C bond formations based on the RhIII complexes synthesized from dirhodium(II) trifluoroacetate with 2&#8208;arylpyridines. With the selection of electron&#8208;donating groups on the arene rings of 2&#8208;arylpyridines, the unusual meta&#8208;ortho C&#8722;C bond&#8208;forming was favored, which led to the formation of meta&#8208;substituted 2&#8208;arylpyridine homocoupling dimers. On the contrary, the electron&#8208;withdrawing groups have tendency to occur conventional ortho&#8208;ortho bond&#8208;forming, resulting in the formation of new RhIII complexes possessing the intriguing RhIII(TFA)3 fragment. Preliminary mechanistic experiments suggest that the sequential oxidation of RhIII occurred in the reaction.

         <title>Potassium Ion Conductivity in the Cubic Labyrinth of a Piezoelectric, Antiferromagnetic Oxoferrate(III) Tellurate(VI)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
K(nockout) response: K12+6xFe6Te4&#8722;xO27 was synthesized under hydroflux conditions. The acentric cubic crystal structure comprises two non&#8208;interpenetrating chiral oxometalate networks formed by edge&#8208; or corner&#8208;sharing [TeVIO6] and [FeIIIO5] polyhedra. The potassium ions are mobile in the labyrinth between the networks. The magnetic moments of the iron cations are pairwise antiparallel, and the compound exhibits a strong piezoelectric response.







Abstract
Orange&#8208;colored crystals of the oxoferrate tellurate K12+6xFe6Te4&#8722;xO27 [x=0.222(4)] were synthesized in a potassium hydroxide hydroflux with a molar water&#8211;base ratio n(H2O)/n(KOH) of 1.5 starting from Fe(NO3)3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;9H2O, TeO2 and H2O2 at about 200&#8201;&#176;C. By using (NH4)2TeO4 instead of TeO2, a fine powder consisting of microcrystalline spheres of K12+6xFe6Te4&#8722;xO27 was obtained. K12+6xFe6Te4&#8722;xO27 crystallizes in the acentric cubic space group I
3d. [FeIIIO5] pyramids share their apical atoms in [Fe2O9] groups and two of their edges with [TeVIO6] octahedra to form an open framework that consists of two loosely connected, but not interpenetrating, chiral networks. The flexibility of the hinged oxometalate network manifests in a piezoelectric response similar to that of LiNbO3.The potassium cations are mobile in channels that run along the &lt;111&gt; directions and cross in cavities acting as nodes. The ion conductivity of cold&#8208;pressed pellets of ball&#8208;milled K12+6xFe6Te4&#8722;xO27 is 2.3&#215;10&#8722;4 S&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at room temperature. Magnetization measurements and neutron diffraction indicate antiferromagnetic coupling in the [Fe2O9] groups.

         <dc:description>The development of methodologies to control on demand and reversibly supramolecular transformations from self&#8208;assembled metalla&#8208;structures requires the rational design of architectures able to answer to an applied stimulus. While solvent, concentration, guest, light, addition of a chemical have been largely explored to provide these transformations, the case of pH sensitive materials is less described. Herein, we report the first example of a pH&#8208;triggered dissociation of a coordination&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembled interlocked molecular link. It incorporates a pH sensitive benzobisimidazole&#8208;based ligand that can be selectively protonated on its bisimidazole moieties. This generates intermolecular electrostatic repulsions that reduces drastically the stability of the interlocked structure, leading to its dissociation without any sign of protonation of the basic pyridine moieties involved in the coordination bonds.

         <title>A Structural Diversity of Molecular Alkaline&#8208;Earth&#8208;Metal Polyphosphides: From Supramolecular Wheel to Zintl Ion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mis&#8208;matched: Air stable pentaphosphaferrocene or white phosphorus are used as polyphosphorus source to access molecular group 2 polyphosphides. Structurally diverse polyphosphides ranging supramolecular wheel to Zintl ions have been accessed by using various group 2 reagents such as organo&#8208;magnesium, mono&#8208;valent magnesium or molecular calcium hydride complex. The ancillary ligands and the metal ions influences the structural motifs of the polyphosphides, which was investigated theoretically as well.







Abstract
A series of molecular group 2 polyphosphides has been synthesized by using air&#8208;stable [Cp*Fe(&#951;5&#8208;P5)] (Cp*=C5Me5) or white phosphorus as polyphosphorus precursors. Different types of group 2 reagents such as organo&#8208;magnesium, mono&#8208;valent magnesium, and molecular calcium hydride complexes have been investigated to activate these polyphosphorus sources. The organo&#8208;magnesium complex [(DippBDI&#8722;Mg(CH3))2] (DippBDI={[2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3NCMe]2CH}&#8722;) reacts with [Cp*Fe(&#951;5&#8208;P5)] to give an unprecedented Mg/Fe&#8208;supramolecular wheel. Kinetically controlled activation of [Cp*Fe(&#951;5&#8208;P5)] by different mono&#8208;valent magnesium complexes allowed the isolation of Mg&#8208;coordinated formally mono&#8208; and di&#8208;reduced products of [Cp*Fe(&#951;5&#8208;P5)]. To obtain the first examples of molecular calcium&#8208;polyphosphides, a molecular calcium hydride complex was used to reduce the aromatic cyclo&#8208;P5 ring of [Cp*Fe(&#951;5&#8208;P5)]. The Ca&#8208;Fe&#8208;polyphosphide is also characterized by quantum chemical calculations and compared with the corresponding Mg complex. Moreover, a calcium coordinated Zintl ion (P7)3&#8722; was obtained by molecular calcium hydride mediated P4 reduction.

         <dc:description>
Through a new method of low&#8208;temperature (only 350&#8201;&#176;C) self&#8208;reduction, a highly efficient deep blue&#8208;emitting phosphor Ca[B8O11(OH)4]&#8201;:&#8201;Eu2+ was prepared, with a high PLQY of 95&#8201;% and a color purity of 97.6&#8201;%.

Abstract
Highly efficient inorganic phosphors are crucial for solid&#8208;state lighting. In this paper, a new method of low&#8208;temperature self&#8208;reduction was used for preparing a highly efficient deep blue&#8208;emitting phosphor of Ca[B8O11(OH)4]&#8201;:&#8201;Eu2+ (CBH&#8201;:&#8201;Eu2+). The crystal structure, morphology, chemical state, and photoluminescence (PL) properties of the CBH&#8201;:&#8201;Eu2+ phosphor have been investigated. By using the screened hybrid function (HSE06), the band gap (Eg) of CBH was calculated to be 7.48&#8197;eV, which is a necessary condition for achieving high quantum yield phosphors. The experiment results show that almost all the added raw materials of Eu3+ can be reduced to Eu2+ in CBH crystal under a non&#8208;reducing atmosphere. The CBH&#8201;:&#8201;Eu2+ phosphor shows a broad excitation spectrum centered at 277 and 327&#8197;nm in the range of 220 to 400&#8197;nm, and a narrow&#8208;band emission spectrum centered at 428&#8197;nm in the range of 400 to 500&#8197;nm, with a full width at half maximum (fwhm) of 42.35&#8197;nm. Under UV radiation, the CBH&#8201;:&#8201;2&#8201;%Eu2+ exhibits high photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY=95.0&#8201;%), high external quantum efficiency (EQE=31.1&#8201;%), and ultra&#8208;high color purity (97.6&#8201;%). The PL intensity of CBH&#8201;:&#8201;2&#8201;%Eu2+ remains 62.6&#8201;% of the initial intensity at 150&#8201;&#176;C. Finally, the white light&#8208;emitting diodes (WLED) fabricated by CBH&#8201;:&#8201;2&#8201;%Eu2+, excited by a 365&#8197;nm chip, presents outstanding performances with a luminous efficacy (LE) of 13.9 lm/W, a color rendering index (CRI) of 89.4, and a correlated color temperature (CCT) of 5825&#8197;K. The above results show that CBH&#8201;:&#8201;Eu2+ can be used as a promising blue phosphor for WLED. This new method of low&#8208;temperature self&#8208;reduction can be applied to design and prepare other new types of highly efficient phosphors.

         <title>Unveiling the Role of Hydrogen Bonds in Luminescent N&#8208;Annulated Perylene Liquid Crystals</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>

Getting into position: The position of hydrogen&#8208;bonding amide groups affects the properties of a series of luminescent N&#8208;annulated perylenes that self&#8208;assemble into nanostructured liquid&#8208;crystalline columnar phases. The liquid crystals with the amide linkers close to the central perylene core exhibit liquid&#8208;crystalline phases with a wider temperature range. In contrast, perylenes with ester groups, instead of amides, close to the central core exhibit vapochromism upon exposure to organic solvents.







Abstract
We report the liquid&#8208;crystalline (LC) and luminescent properties of a series of N&#8208;annulated perylenes (1&#8211;4) in whose molecular structures amide and ester groups alternate. We found that the LC properties of these compounds not only depend on the number of hydrogen&#8208;bonding units, but also on the relative position of the amide linkers in the molecule. The absence of amide groups in compound 1 leads to no LC properties, whereas four amide groups induce the formation of a wide temperature range columnar hexagonal phase in compound 4. Remarkably, compound 3, with two amide groups in the inner part of the structure, stabilizes the columnar LC phases better than its structural isomer 2, with the amide groups in the outer part of the molecule. Similarly, we found that only compounds 1 and 2, which have no hydrogen bonding units in the inner part of the molecule, exhibit luminescence vapochromism upon exposure to organic solvent vapors.

         <title>Influence of N&#8208;Substituents on Photovoltaic Properties of Singly Bay&#8208;Linked Dimeric Perylene Diimides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By developing a general synthetic strategy, we synthesized a new series of bay&#8208;linked dimeric perylene diimides (diPDIs), some of which possess primary N&#8208;alkyl substituents or unsymmetric N&#8208;substitution pattern. The systematic investigation on their photovoltaic properties revealed that the primary alkyl substituents are advantageous for enhancing the device performance in terms of crystallinity improvement and film&#8208;forming controllability.







Abstract
The influence of N&#8208;substituents on the photovoltaic properties of singly bay&#8208;linked perylene diimides (diPDIs) was systematically investigated to understand the aromatic&#8208;aliphatic balance, which is beneficial for achieving high device performance in organic photovoltaic (OPV) systems. The synthesis of various N&#8208;substituted diPDIs was successfully achieved using a newly developed one&#8208;step procedure, resulting in sufficiently high yields. Detailed investigations of seven variants of diPDIs demonstrated that the primary alkyl substituents, particularly the 2&#8208;ethylhexyl group, induce the self&#8208;organized growth of thin films with high crystallinity. This is beneficial for enhancing the device performance of bulk heterojunction (BHJ) systems. The results presented herein reveal the important roles of alkyl side chains as hydrophobic solubilizing auxiliaries or primary determinants in the control of the active layer nanomorphology. This offers a valuable guideline that is essential for developing high&#8208;performance organic semiconductor materials for future practical applications.

         <title>Galactose Grafted Two&#8208;Dimensional Nanosheets as a Scaffold for the In Situ Synthesis of Silver Nanoparticles: A Potential Catalyst for the Reduction of Nitroaromatics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Amphiphilicity&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly of galactose&#8208;hexaphenylbenzene based amphiphiles into galactose&#8208;decorated 2D nanosheet is reported. The extremely dense decoration of reducing sugar on the surface of the sheets is used for the in&#8197;situ synthesis and immobilization of ultrafine catalytically active AgNPs by using Tollens&#8217; reaction. The potential of the system as a recyclable catalyst for the reduction of various nitroaromatics is demonstrated. Enhanced catalytic activity is observed for the immobilized AgNPs when compared to the corresponding discrete AgNPs.







Abstract
Two major hurdles in NP&#8208;based catalysis are the aggregation of the NPs and their recycling. Immobilization of NPs onto a 2D support is the most promising strategy to overcome these difficulties. Herein, amphiphilicity&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly of galactose&#8208;hexaphenylbenzene&#8208;based amphiphiles into galactose&#8208;decorated 2D nanosheet is reported. The extremely dense decoration of reducing sugar on the surface of the sheets is used for the in&#8197;situ synthesis and immobilization of ultrafine catalytically active AgNPs by using Tollens&#8217; reaction. The potential of the system as a catalyst for the reduction of various nitroaromatics is demonstrated. Enhanced catalytic activity is observed for the immobilized AgNPs when compared to the corresponding discrete AgNPs. Recovery of the catalytic system from the reaction mixture by ultrafiltration and its subsequent recycling for several cycles without dropping its activity is shown. This is the first report demonstrating the in&#8197;situ synthesis and immobilization of ultrafine AgNPs onto a 2D nanosheet that exhibits excellent catalytic performance for the reduction of nitroaromatics.

         <title>Heterobimetallic Coinage Metal&#8208;Ruthenium Complexes Supported by Anionic N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Silver(I) and copper(I) arene complexes [(WCA&#8208;NHC)M(&#951;2&#8208;toluene)] (M=Ag, Cu) with a weakly coordinating anionic (WCA) borate moiety were prepared and their ability to serve as transmetalation reagents was investigated. However, the high stability of WCA&#8208;NHC&#8208;metal bonds provided access to heterobimetallic complexes such as [(WCA&#8208;NHC)M(&#956;&#8208;Cl)2Ru(PPh3)(&#951;6&#8208;p&#8208;cymene)], which resisted the elimination of AgCl or CuCl, respectively.







Abstract
The lithium complexes [(WCA&#8208;NHC)Li(toluene)] of anionic N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes with a weakly coordinating borate moiety (WCA&#8208;NHC, WCA=B(C6F5)3, NHC=IDipp=1,3&#8208;bis(2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl)imidazolin&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene) were used for the preparation of silver(I) or copper(I) WCA&#8208;NHC complexes. While the reactions in THF with AgCl or CuCl afforded anionic mono&#8208; and dicarbene complexes with solvated lithium counterions [Li(THF)n]+ (n=3, 4), the reactions in toluene proceeded with elimination of LiCl and formation of the neutral phosphine and arene complexes [(WCA&#8208;NHC)M(PPh3)] and [(WCA&#8208;NHC)M(&#951;2&#8208;toluene)] (M=Ag, Cu). The latter were used for the preparation of chlorido&#8208; and iodido&#8208;bridged heterobimetallic Ag/Ru and Cu/Ru complexes [(WCA&#8208;NHC)M(&#956;&#8208;X)2Ru(PPh3)(&#951;6&#8208;p&#8208;cymene)] (M=Ag, Cu, X=Cl; M=Ag, X=I). Surprisingly, these complexes resisted the elimination of CuCl, AgCl, or AgI, precluding WCA&#8208;NHC transmetalation.

         <title>SnS nanosheets for rapid and effective bacteria sterilization under near&#8208;infrared irradiation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Today, the threat of pathogenic bacterial infection worldwide that leads to the increase of mortality rate strongly demands the development of new antibacterial agents that can kill bacteria quickly and effectively. Although there are a lot of antibacterial agents that have been developed so far, few studies on the antibacterial ability of SnS have been investigated at 808 nm laser.   Here, we synthesized SnS nanosheets with strong near&#8208;infrared absorption performance and excellent antibacterial performance via a simple hydrothermal synthesis route.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Today, the threat of pathogenic bacterial infection worldwide that leads to the increase of mortality rate strongly demands the development of new antibacterial agents that can kill bacteria quickly and effectively. Although there are a lot of antibacterial agents that have been developed so far, few studies on the antibacterial ability of SnS have been investigated at 808 nm laser.   Here, we synthesized SnS nanosheets with strong near-infrared absorption performance and excellent antibacterial performance via a simple hydrothermal synthesis route.  The as-prepared SnS nanosheets showed excellent photothermal conversion efficiency (38.7%), photodynamic performance, and photostability, and at the same time 99.98% and 99.7% sterilization effect against Gram-negative  Escherichia coli  (  E. coli  ) and Gram-positive  Bacillus subtilis  (  B. subtilis  ) under near-infrared irradiation (808 nm, 1.5 W / cm  2  ). This study suggests that SnS nanosheets could be a promising candidate for antibacterial therapy owing to the synergetic effects of photothermal and photodynamic performance..&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Liquid&#8208;Crystalline Polymer Particles Prepared by Classical Polymerization Techniques</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Getting things in order: Liquid crystal (LC) polymer particles have a unique anisotropic supramolecular order that distinguishes them from conventional polymer particles. This review focuses on the preparation of LC polymer particles by classical polymerization techniques, including suspension, mini&#8208;emulsion, dispersion and precipitation polymerization. The particle size, LC phases, alignment, properties and applications are also presented.







Abstract
Liquid&#8208;crystalline polymer particles prepared by classical polymerization techniques are receiving increased attention as promising candidates for use in a variety of applications including micro&#8208;actuators, structurally colored objects, and absorbents. These particles have anisotropic molecular order and liquid&#8208;crystalline phases that distinguish them from conventional polymer particles. In this minireview, the preparation of liquid&#8208;crystalline polymer particles from classical suspension, (mini&#8208;)emulsion, dispersion, and precipitation polymerization reactions are discussed. The particle sizes, molecular orientations, and liquid&#8208;crystalline phases produced by each technique are summarized and compared. We conclude with a discussion of the challenges and prospects of the preparation of liquid&#8208;crystalline polymer particles by classical polymerization techniques.

         <title>How Aromatic Fluorination Exchanges the Interaction Role of Pyridine with Carbonyl Compounds: The Formaldehyde Adduct</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The full ring fluorination of pyridine has a dramatic effect on its binding properties by creating a &#960;&#8208;hole. In the adduct pentafluoropyridine&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;formaldehyde the presence of fluorine atoms exchanges the electron donor&#8208;acceptor roles of both molecules when compared to those observed in the pyridine&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;formaldehyde adduct.







Abstract
The rotational spectrum of the weakly bound complex pentafluoropyridine&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;formaldehyde has been investigated using Fourier transform microwave spectroscopy. From the analysis of the rotational parameters of the parent species and of the 13C and 15N isotopologues, the structural arrangement of the adduct has been unambiguously established. The full ring fluorination of pyridine has a dramatic effect on its binding properties: It alters the electron density distribution at the &#960;&#8208;cloud of pyridine creating a &#960;&#8208;hole and changing its electron donor&#8208;acceptor capabilities. In the complex, formaldehyde lies above the aromatic ring with one of the oxygen lone pairs, as conventionally envisaged, pointing toward its centre. This lone pair&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960;&#8208;hole interaction, reinforced by a weak C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;N interaction, indicates an exchange of the electron&#8208;acceptor roles of both molecules when compared to the pyridine&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;formaldehyde adduct. Tunnelling doublets due to the internal rotation of formaldehyde have also been observed and analysed leading to a discussion on the competition between lone pair&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960;&#8208;hole and &#960;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; stacking interactions.

         <title>Charge&#8208;Transfer in Panchromatic Porphyrin&#8208;Tetracyanobuta&#8208;1,3&#8208;Diene&#8208;Donor Conjugates: Switching the Role of Porphyrin in the Charge Separation Process</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Charge Transfer and Separation. Occurrence of charge transfer and separation processes in newly synthesized porphyrin&#8208;TCBD&#8208;Donor multi&#8208;modular donor&#8208;acceptor systems is reported. The significance of the nature of porphyrins and second electron donor in governing the charge transfer events in these closely positioned conjugates is borne out from the present study.

Using a combination of cycloaddition&#8208;retroelectrocyclization reaction, free&#8208;base and zinc porphyrins (H2P and ZnP) are decorated at their &#946;&#8208;pyrrole positions with strong charge transfer complexes, viz., tetracyanobuta&#8208;1,3&#8208;diene (TCBD)&#8208;phenothiazine (3 and 4) or TCBD&#8208;aniline (7 and 8), novel class of push&#8208;pull systems. The physico&#8208;chemical properties of these compounds (MP&#8208;Donor and MP&#8208;TCBD&#8208;Donor) have been investigated using a range of electrochemical, spectroelectrochemical, DFT as well as steady&#8208;state and time&#8208;resolved spectroscopic techniques. Ground&#8208;state charge transfer interactions between the porphyrin and the electron&#8208;withdrawing TCBD directly attached to the porphyrin &#960;&#8208;system extended the absorption features well into the near&#8208;infrared region. To visualize the photo&#8208;events, energy level diagrams with the help of free&#8208;energy calculations have been established. Switching the role of porphyrin from the initial electron acceptor to electron donor was possible to envision. Occurrence of photoinduced charge separation has been established by complementary transient absorption spectral studies followed by global and target data analyses. Better charge stabilization in H2P derived over ZnP derived conjugates, and in phenothiazine derived over aniline derived conjugates has been possible to establish. These findings highlight the importance of the nature of porphyrins and second electron donor in governing the ground and excited state charge transfer events in closely positioned donor&#8208;acceptor conjugates.

         <title>Reactivity and Passivation of Fe Nanoclusters on h&#8208;BN/Rh(111)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reactivity of iron nanoclusters (Fe&#8208;NCs) on h&#8208;BN/Rh(111) was investigated using in&#8197;situ high&#8208;resolution X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy and CO as a probe molecule. The hollow/edge sites were determined to be the most active sites of the clusters. Dissociation of CO was only observed on the as&#8208;prepared Fe&#8208;NCs, while no catalytic activity towards CO dissociation was found for the precovered clusters as a result of blocking of the most active sites by adatoms.







Abstract
The reactivity of iron nanocluster arrays on h&#8208;BN/Rh(111) was studied using in&#8197;situ high&#8208;resolution X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The morphology and reactivity of the iron nanoclusters (Fe&#8208;NCs) were investigated by CO adsorption. On&#8208;top and hollow/edge sites were determined to be the available adsorption sites on the as&#8208;prepared Fe&#8208;NCs and CO dissociation was observed at 300&#8197;K. C&#8208; and O&#8208;precovered Fe&#8208;NCs showed no catalytic activity towards CO dissociation because the hollow/edge sites were blocked by the C and O atoms. Therefore, these adsorption sites were identified to be the most active sites of the Fe&#8208;NCs.

         <title>Rethinking Uncaging: A New Antiaromatic Photocage Driven by a Gain of Resonance Energy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The concept of excited state aromaticity was used to design a new class of photolabile protecting groups, based on cyclic, ground&#8208;state&#8208;antiaromatic systems. Supported by theoretical calculations, several thio&#8208; and nitrogen functionalized compounds were synthesized, characterized and further optimized, resulting in a well accessible, visible light absorbing, new photocage with a high uncaging cross section of 893&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 405&#8197;nm.







Abstract
Photoactivatable compounds for example photoswitches or photolabile protecting groups (PPGs, photocages) for spatiotemporal light control, play a crucial role in different areas of research. For each application, parameters such as the absorption spectrum, solubility in the respective media and/or photochemical quantum yields for several competing processes need to be optimized. The design of new photochemical tools therefore remains an important task. In this study, we exploited the concept of excited&#8208;state&#8208;aromaticity, first described by N. Colin Baird in 1971, to investigate a new class of photocages, based on cyclic, ground&#8208;state&#8208;antiaromatic systems. Several thio&#8208; and nitrogen&#8208;functionalized compounds were synthesized, photochemically characterized and further optimized, supported by quantum chemical calculations. After choosing the optimal scaffold, which shows an excellent uncaging quantum yield of 28&#8201;%, we achieved a bathochromic shift of over 100&#8197;nm, resulting in a robust, well accessible, visible light absorbing, compact new photocage with a clean photoreaction and a high quantum product (&#1013;&#8901;&#934;) of 893&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 405&#8197;nm.

         <title>Hydrogenation of Secondary Amides using Phosphane Oxide and Frustrated Lewis Pair Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The hydrogenation of secondary carboxylic acid amides by combined phosphane oxide and frustrated Lewis pair catalysis is described. The reaction proceeds under mild conditions and displays excellent functional group tolerance. Kinetic and quantum&#8208;chemical experiments support the autoinduced catalytic cycle with chloride as active Lewis base for the hydrogen activation.







Abstract
The metal&#8208;free catalytic hydrogenation of secondary carboxylic acid amides is developed. The reduction is realized by two new catalytic reactions. First, the amide is converted into the imidoyl chloride by triphosgene (CO(OCCl3)2) using novel phosphorus(V) catalysts. Second, the in&#8197;situ generated imidoyl chlorides are hydrogenated in high yields by an FLP&#8208;catalyst. Mechanistic and quantum mechanical calculations support an autoinduced catalytic cycle for the hydrogenation with chloride acting as unusual Lewis base for FLP&#8208;mediated H2&#8208;activation.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks&#8208;Derived Self&#8208;Supported Carbon&#8208;Based Composites for Electrocatalytic Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrocatalytic water splitting has been considered as a promising strategy for the sustainable evolution of hydrogen energy and storage of intermittent electric energy. Efficient catalysts for electrocatalytic water splitting are urgently demanded to decrease the overpotentials and promote the sluggish reaction kinetics. Carbon&#8208;based composites, including heteroatom&#8208;doped carbon materials, metals/alloys@carbon composites, metal compounds@carbon composites, and atomically dispersed metal sites@carbon composites have been widely used as the catalysts due to their fascinating properties. However, these electrocatalysts are almost powdery form, and should be cast on the current collector by using the polymeric binder, which would result in the unsatisfied electrocatalytic performance. In comparison, a self&#8208;supported electrode architecture is highly attractive. Recently, self&#8208;supported metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) constructed by coordination of metal centers and organic ligands have been considered as suitable templates/precursors to construct free&#8208;standing carbon&#8208;based composites grown on conductive substrate. MOFs&#8208;derived carbon&#8208;based composites have various merits, such as the well&#8208;aligned array architecture and evenly distributed active sites, and easy functionalization with other species, which make them suitable alternatives to non&#8208;noble metal&#8208;included electrocatalysts. In this review, we intend to show the research progresses by employment of MOFs as precursors to prepare self&#8208;supported carbon&#8208;based composites. Focusing on these MOFs&#8208;derived carbon&#8208;based nanomaterials, the latest advances in their controllable synthesis, composition regulation, electrocatalytic performances in hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and overall water splitting (OWS) are presented. Finally, the challenges and perspectives are showed for the further developments of MOFs&#8208;derived self&#8208;supported carbon&#8208;based nanomaterials in electrocatalytic reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Pyrene modified serinol nucleic acid nanostructure converts chirality of threoninol nucleic acids into circularly polarized luminescence signals</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We herein report a circularly polarized luminescent (CPL) probe that can respond to chirality of nucleic acids. An achiral nanostructure was prepared by hybridization of symmetric serinol nucleic acid (SNA) containing pyrene&#8208;modified residues. When chiral oligomers were added that were complementary to the SNA, they induced helicity into the SNA nanowire. Efficient circular dichroism (CD) signal amplification was observed when pyrene was attached to uracil base through a rigid alkynyl linker.&#160; Both CPL signals and CD signals were observed that depended on the chirality of added acyclic threoninol nucleic acid (  a  TNA) oligomer. This system can be used to convert chirality of chiral biomolecules into chiroptical signals.</dc:description>

         <title>Electronic Structure and Superconductivity of Compressed Metal Tetrahydrides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Tetrahydrides crystallizing in the ThCr  2  Si  2  structure type have been predicted to become stable for a plethora of metals under pressure, and some have recently been synthesized. Through detailed first&#8208;principles investigations we show that the metal atoms within these  I  4  /mmm  symmetry MH  4  compounds may be divalent, trivalent or tetravalent. The valence of the metal atom and its radius govern the bonding and electronic structure of these phases, and their evolution under pressure. The factors important for enhancing superconductivity include a large number of hydrogenic states at the Fermi level, and the presence of quasi&#8208;molecular H units whose bonds have been stretched and weakened (but not broken) via electron transfer from the electropositive metal, and via a Kubas&#8208;like interaction with the metal. Analysis of the microscopic mechanism of superconductivity in MgH  4  , ScH  4  and ZrH  4  reveals that phonon modes involving a coupled libration and stretch of the H units leading to the formation of more complex hydrogenic motifs are important contributors towards the electron phonon coupling mechanism. In the divalent hydride MgH  4  , modes associated with motions of the hydridic hydrogen atoms were also key contributors, and softened substantially at lower pressures.</dc:description>

         <title>Direct Synthesis of Tri/Difluoromethyl Ketones from Carboxylic Acids via Cross&#8208;Coupling with Acyloxyphosphonium Ions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A simple and straightforward approach for the synthesis of trifluoromethyl&#8208; and difluoromethyl ketones from widely available carboxylic acids is disclosed. The transformation utilizes an acyloxyphosphonium ion as the active electrophile, conveniently generated in situ from the carboxylic acid substrate using commodity chemicals. The utility of the reaction system is exemplified by its chemoselectivity, with tolerance to a variety of important functional groups. The late&#8208;stage functionalization of carboxylic acid APIs and pharmaceutically relevant compounds is also discussed.</dc:description>

         <title>Recent Advances in the Syntheses and Catalytic Applications of Homonuclear Ru&#8208;, Rh&#8208;, and Ir&#8208;Complexes of CNHC^C Cyclometalated Ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In the past few decades, chemistry of cyclometalated species has gained momentum with increased applications in several areas of scientific developments. Cyclometalation reactions result in the formation of stable metalacycles through the generation of metal&#8208;carbon covalent bonds by activating the unreactive Csp2&#8208;H or Csp3&#8208;H bonds. The extra stability gained by the formation of metalacycles enhances their applicability scopes especially in the area of homogeneous catalysis. In the recent research development in this area, NHC ligands (strong  &#963;&#8208;donor and generally, weak  &#960;&#8208;acceptor) have been found to be one of the most suitable candidates for the intramolecular C&#8208;H activation process which leads to the cyclometalated species. The growth in the area of cyclometalation chemistry that started in the late 20th  century is still continuing and in the past few decades, various examples of NHC derived transition metal&#8208;based cyclometalated complexes came into the picture. As&#160;covering all the reported literatures in this area (includes mainly late transition metals) will exceed the limits of minireview, we restricted ourselves to the recent (2015 &#8208; May, 2021) examples of the most common Ru&#8208;, Rh&#8208;, and Ir&#8208;based CNHC^C cyclometalated complexes and their applications in various homogeneous catalytic conversions such as the transfer hydrogenation, amidation, oxidation of alcohols, annulations, etc.</dc:description>

         <title>One&#8208;Step Synthesis and Schlenk&#8208;Type Equilibrium of Cyclopentadienylmagnesium Bromides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In the in situ Grignard metalation method (iGMM), the addition of bromoethane to a suspension of magnesium turnings and cyclopentadienes [C  5  H  6  (HCp), C  5  H  5  &#8208;Si(  i  Pr)  3  (HCp  TIPS  )] in diethyl ether smoothly yields heteroleptic [(Et  2  O)Mg(Cp  R  )(&#181;&#8208;Br)]  2  (Cp  R  = Cp (  1  ), Cp  TIPS  (  2  )). The Schlenk equilibrium of  2  in toluene leads to ligand exchange and formation of homoleptic [Mg(Cp  R  )  2  ] (  3  ) and [(Et  2  O)MgBr(&#181;&#8208;Br)]  2  (  4  ). Interfering solvation and aggregation as well as ligand redistribution equilibria hamper a quantitative elucidation of thermodynamic data for the Schlenk equilibrium of  2  in toluene. In ethereal solvents, mononuclear species [(Et  2  O)  2  Mg(Cp  TIPS  )Br] (  2&#8217;  ), [(Et  2  O)  n  Mg(Cp  TIPS  )  2  ] (  3&#8217;  ), and [(Et  2  O)  2  MgBr  2  ] (  4&#8217;  ) coexist.

         <title>Single amino&#8208;acid based self&#8208;assembled biomaterials with potent antimicrobial activity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The design and development of soft biomaterials based on amino acid and short&#8208;peptide have gained much attention due to their potent biomedical applications. A slight alteration in the side&#8208;chain of single amino acid in a peptide or protein sequence has a huge impact on the structure and function. Phenylalanine is one of the most studied amino acids, which contains an aromatic phenyl group connected through a flexible &#8211;CH  2  &#8208; unit. In this work, we have examined whether flexibility and aromatic functionality of phenylalanine (Phe) are important in gel formation of model gelator Fmoc&#8208;Phe&#8208;OH or not. To examine this hypothesis, we synthesized Fmoc&#8208;derivatives of three analogues unnatural amino acids including cyclohexylalanine, phenylglycine, and homophenylalanine; which are slightly varied from Phe. Interestingly, all these three new analogues formed hydrogels in phosphate buffer at pH 7.0 having different gelation efficacy and kinetics. This study suggests that the presence of aromatic side&#8208;chain and flexibility are not mandatory for the gelation of the model gelator. Newly synthesized unnatural amino acid derivatives have also exhibited promising antimicrobial activity towards gram&#8208;positive bacteria by inhibiting cellular oxygen consumption. We further determined the biocompatibility of these amino acid derivatives by using a hemolysis assay on human blood cells. Overall studies described the development of single amino acid&#8208;based new injectable biomaterials with improved antimicrobial activity by the slight alteration in the side&#8208;chain of amino acid.</dc:description>

Overall studies described the development of single amino acid-based new injectable biomaterials with improved antimicrobial activity by the slight alteration in the side-chain of amino acid.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Triaminocyclopentadienyl Ruthenium Complexes &#8211; New Catalysts for Cascade Conversions of Propargyl Alcohols</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Various triaminocyclopentadienyl ruthenium complexes have been synthesized from Ru3(CO)12. The new complexes were tested for their ability to catalyze cascade conversions of propargyl alcohols. Their associated catalytic activities complement the activities of known diaminocyclopentadienone ruthenium complexes. In particular, the substrate scope of catalytic cycloadditions with 3&#8208;ketolactones or phloroglucinol derivatives is extended to terpenoid&#8208;derived propargyl alcohols containing an internal alkyne moiety. A wide range of cyclic terpenoid and phloroglucinol adducts are obtained by complementary application of both types of catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Photophysics of azobenzene constrained in a UiO metal&#8208;organic framework: effects of pressure, solvation and dynamic disorder</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photophysical studies of chromophoric linkers in metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) are undertaken commonly in the context of sensing applications, in search of readily observable changes of optical properties in response to external stimuli. The advantages of the MOF construct as a platform for investigating fundamental photophysical behaviour have been somewhat overlooked. The linker framework offers a unique environment in which the chromophore is geometrically constrained and its structure can be determined crystallographically, but it exists in spatial isolation, unperturbed by inter&#8208;chromophore interactions. Furthermore, high&#8208;pressure studies enable the photophysical consequences of controlled, incremental changes in local environment or conformation to be observed and correlated with structural data. We demonstrate this approach in the present study of the  trans  &#8208;azobenzene chromophore, constrained in the form of the 4&#8217;4&#8208;azobenzenedicarboxylate (abdc) linker, in a UiO topology framework. We report previously unobserved effects of pressure&#8208;induced solvation and conformational distortion on the lowest energy, np* transition, and interpret these in the light of crystallographic data. We find that  trans  &#8208;azobenzene remains non&#8208;fluorescent (with a quantum yield less than 10  &#8208;4  ) despite the prevention of  trans&#8208;cis  isomerization by the constraining MOF structure. We propose that efficient non&#8208;radiative decay is mediated by the local, pedal&#8208;like twisting of the azo group that is evident as dynamic disorder in the crystal structure.</dc:description>

         <title>How to look for compounds: predictive screening and in situ studies in Na&#8208;Zn&#8208;Bi system</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Here we demonstrate the combination of theoretical computations followed by rapid experimental screening and in&#8208;situ diffraction studies as a powerful strategy for novel compounds discovery. When applied for the previously &#8220;empty&#8221; Na&#8208;Zn&#8208;Bi system, such an approach led to 4 novel phases. The compositional space of this system was rapidly screened via the hydride route method and the theoretically predicted NaZnBi (PbClF type, P4/nmm) and Na11Zn2Bi5 (Na11Cd2Sb5 type, P&#8208;1) phases were successfully synthesized, while other computationally generated compounds on the list were rejected. In addition, single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction studies of NaZnBi indicate minor deviations from the stoichiometric 1:1:1 molar ratio. As a result, two isostructural (PbClF type, P4/nmm) Zn&#8208;deficient phases with similar compositions, but distinctly different unit cell parameters were discovered. The vacancies on Zn sites and unit cell expansion were rationalized from bonding analysis using electronic structure calculations on stoichiometric &#8220;NaZnBi&#8221;. In&#8208;situ synchrotron powder X&#8208;ray diffraction studies shed light on complex equilibria in the Na&#8208;Zn&#8208;Bi system at elevated temperatures. In particular, the high&#8208;temperature polymorph HT&#8208;Na3Bi (BiF3 type, Fm&#8208;3m) was obtained as a product of Na11Zn2Bi5 decomposition above 611 K. HT&#8208;Na3Bi cannot be stabilized at room temperature by quenching, and this type of structure was earlier observed in the high&#8208;pressure polymorph HP&#8208;Na3Bi above 0.5 GPa. The aforementioned approach of predictive synthesis can be extended to other multinary systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Static Retention of Dynamic Chiral Arrangements for Achiral Shear Thinning Metal&#8211;Organic Colloids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Spin doctoring: Shear thinning is suggested to help colloidal particles adopt a chiral arrangement in a vortex, which results in strong CD properties. Furthermore, the introduction of a small molecule that both undergoes electrostatic interaction and possesses dual&#8208;site coordination bonding ability will greatly increase the storage modulus of colloids and make them maintain dynamic CD properties in the static state.







Abstract
Chiral compounds are known to be important not only because they are the fundamental components of living organisms, but also for their unique chiroptical properties. In recent years, scientists have fabricated several chiral organic supramolecular aggregates by using chiral physical fields, such as vortex flow. Herein, the relationship between dynamic chiroptical properties and rheological nature is discussed, suggesting the shear thinning properties of non&#8208;Newtonian fluids might help colloidal particles adopt a chiral arrangement in vortices. Furthermore, the storage modulus of colloids could be increased by adding a linking agent, which successfully kept the dynamic chiroptical properties in the static state. Moreover, the salt effect on the host&#8211;guest interaction involved in the colloids was studied, the results suggested a significant enhancement of the transferred dynamic circular dichroism for the achiral guest molecule.

         <title>Facile Synthesis of Platinum Right Bipyramids by Separating and Controlling the Nucleation Step in a Continuous Flow System</title>

Right Bipyramids. By separating nucleation from growth and controlling the nucleation step in a continuous flow system, Pt right bipyramids containing one single twin plane were obtained in high yield.







Abstract
Colloidal synthesis of metal nanocrystals with controlled shapes and internal structures calls for a tight control over both the nucleation and growth processes. Here we report a method for the facile synthesis of Pt right bipyramids (RBPs) by separating nucleation from growth and controlling the nucleation step in a continuous flow reactor. Specifically, homogeneous nucleation was thermally triggered by introducing the reaction solution into a tubular flow reactor held at an elevated temperature to generate singly&#8208;twinned seeds. At a lower temperature, the singly&#8208;twinned seeds were protected from oxidative etching to allow their slow growth and evolution into RBPs while additional nucleation of undesired seeds could be largely suppressed to ensure RBPs as the main product. Further investigation indicated that the internal structure and growth pattern of the seeds were determined by the temperatures used for the nucleation and growth steps, respectively. The Br&#8722; ions involved in the synthesis also played a critical role in the generation of RBPs by serving as a capping agent for the Pt{100} facets while regulating the reduction kinetics through coordination with the Pt(IV) ions.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Four selectively mono&#8208;, bis&#8208; and tris&#8208;trimethylammonium&#8208;substituted, bithiophene&#8208;bridged bis&#8208;triarylboranes were synthesized and their potential biological applications were investigated including live cell imaging and photo&#8208;induced cell death. It is demonstrated that their photophysical and electrochemical properties and their interactions with DNAs, RNA and cells, are strongly influenced by the number and distribution of charges within the compounds.







Abstract
The synthesis, photophysical, and electrochemical properties of selectively mono&#8208;, bis&#8208; and tris&#8208;dimethylamino&#8208; and trimethylammonium&#8208;substituted bis&#8208;triarylborane bithiophene chromophores are presented along with the water solubility and singlet oxygen sensitizing efficiency of the cationic compounds Cat1+, Cat2+, Cat(i)2+, and Cat3+. Comparison with the mono&#8208;triarylboranes reveals the large influence of the bridging unit on the properties of the bis&#8208;triarylboranes, especially those of the cationic compounds. Based on these preliminary investigations, the interactions of Cat1+, Cat2+, Cat(i)2+, and Cat3+ with DNA, RNA, and DNApore were investigated in buffered solutions. The same compounds were investigated for their ability to enter and localize within organelles of human lung carcinoma (A549) and normal lung (WI38) cells showing that not only the number of charges but also their distribution over the chromophore influences interactions and staining properties.

         <title>Aminotroponiminates: Impact of the NO2 Functional Group on Coordination, Isomerisation, and Backbone Substitution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unforeseen aspects of ATI chemistry: The impact of a nitro substituent in the backbone of the aminotroponiminate (ATI) ligand on the coordination chemistry and reactivity of alkali metal (Li&#8722;K) complexes has been investigated. This includes the first examples of i) an isolable free ATI anion, ii) E/Z imine isomerisations of ATI species and iii) N,N&#8208;coordinated silver ATIs.







Abstract
Aminotroponiminate (ATI) ligands are a versatile class of redox&#8208;active and potentially cooperative ligands with a rich coordination chemistry that have consequently found a wide range of applications in synthesis and catalysis. While backbone substitution of these ligands has been investigated in some detail, the impact of electron&#8208;withdrawing groups on the coordination chemistry and reactivity of ATIs has been little investigated. We report here Li, Na, and K salts of an ATI ligand with a nitro&#8208;substituent in the backbone. It is demonstrated that the NO2 group actively contributes to the coordination chemistry of these complexes, effectively competing with the N,N&#8208;binding pocket as a coordination site. This results in an unprecedented E/Z isomerisation of an ATI imino group and culminates in the isolation of the first &#8220;naked&#8221; (i.&#8201;e., without directional bonding to a metal atom) ATI anion. Reactions of sodium ATIs with silver(I) and tritylium salts gave the first N,N&#8208;coordinated silver ATI complexes and unprecedented backbone substitution reactions. Analytical techniques applied in this work include multinuclear (VT&#8208;)NMR spectroscopy, single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis, and DFT calculations.

         <title>High&#8208;Pressure Synthesis of Sc5P12N23O3 and Ti5P12N24O2 by Activation of the Binary Nitrides ScN and TiN with NH4F</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The oxonitridophosphates Sc5P12N23O3 and Ti5P12N24O2 have been prepared by high&#8208;pressure high&#8208;temperature reactions from the refractory nitrides ScN and TiN, respectively. These reactions were enabled by the addition of NH4F as a mineralizing agent. The crystal structures were elucidated by a combination of SCXRD, BVS calculations and magnetic measurements for Ti5P12N24O2 revealing two distinct crystallographic sites occupied by either Ti3+ or Ti4+, respectively.







Abstract
Multinary transition metal nitrides and oxonitrides are a versatile and intriguing class of compounds. However, they have been investigated far less than pure oxides. The compounds Sc5P12N23O3 and Ti5P12N24O2 have now been synthesized from the binary nitrides ScN and TiN, respectively, by following a high&#8208;pressure high&#8208;temperature approach at 8&#8197;GPa and 1400&#8201;&#176;C. NH4F acts as a mineralizing agent that supports product formation and crystallization. The starting materials ScN and TiN are seemingly an uncommon choice because of their chemical inertness but, nevertheless, react under these conditions. Sc5P12N23O3 and Ti5P12N24O2 crystallize isotypically with Ti5B12O26, consisting of solely vertex&#8208;sharing P(O/N)4 tetrahedra forming two independent interpenetrating diamond&#8208;like nets that host TM(O/N)6 (TM=Sc, Ti) octahedra. Ti5P12N24O2 is a mixed&#8208;valence compound and shows ordering of Ti3+ and Ti4+ ions.

         <title>Variations in Complementary Hydrogen Bonds Direct Assembly Patterns of Isosteric Polyheteroaromatics at Surfaces</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The 2D on&#8208;surface assembly of isosteric phenazine derivatives was investigated by utilizing scanning tunneling microscopy on single&#8208;crystal gold, silver and copper surfaces. The strength and directionality of hydrogen bonding donor&#8208;acceptor pairs and prototropic tautomerism were found to have a profound impact on the 2D assembly patterns, as evidenced by the variations in surface structure for the three derivative molecules used in this study.







Abstract
Intermolecular interactions guide self&#8208;assembly on the surface. Precise control over these interactions by rational design of the molecule should allow fine control over the self&#8208;assembly patterns. Functional groups installed for electronic modulation often induce significant changes in the molecular dimensions, thereby disrupting the original assembly pattern. To overcome this challenge, we have employed a family of isosteric phenazine derivatives, DHP, DAP, and DBQD, to investigate the impacts of hydrogen bonding on two&#8208;dimensional molecular self&#8208;assembly. While these molecules are similar in size and chemical composition, the strength and directionality of hydrogen bonding differ significantly depending on the chemical structure of donor&#8208;acceptor pairs and prototropic tautomerization from positional isomerism. Scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) characterization of the assembled structures on Ag(111), Au(111), and Cu(100) surfaces revealed that minimal changes in molecular structure have a profound impact on the self&#8208;assembly patterns. While DHP exhibits highly ordered and robust assemblies, DAP and DBQD show either spatially confined or ill&#8208;defined assemblies. In conjunction with hydrogen bonding, prototropic tautomerism is a potent strategy to modulate molecular 2D lattices on surfaces.

Heterofullerene tailoring: The inherently chiral trans&#8208;4&#8242; bisadduct of azafullerene has been synthesized. X&#8208;ray crystallography validated the trans&#8208;4&#8242; addition pattern, and 13C NMR spectroscopy showed C1 symmetry. The bisadduct was enantiomerically resolved, and the mirror&#8208;image relation of the enantiomers was probed by CD spectroscopy. The UV&#8208;Vis absorption and electrochemical data suggest that the addition pattern has a reflection in the light&#8208;harvesting and redox properties of the bisadduct as compared to the equatorialface bisadduct.







Abstract
The multiaddition chemistry of azafullerene C59N has been scarcely explored, and the isolation of pure bisadducts is in its infancy. Encouraged by the recent regioselective synthesis of the inherently chiral equatorialface bisadduct of C59N, we focused on the isolation of the first trans&#8208;4 bisadduct in a simple two&#8208;step approach. The first regioselective synthesis of the trans&#8208;4 bisadduct of C59N by using cyclo&#8208;[2]&#8208;dodecylmalonate as a tether is now reported. The newly synthesized bisadduct has C1 symmetry, as evidenced by 13C NMR, while X&#8208;ray crystallography validated the trans&#8208;4&#8242; addition pattern. Furthermore, the inherently chiral trans&#8208;4&#8242; C59N bisadduct was enantiomerically resolved, and the mirror&#8208;image relation of the two enantiomers was probed by circular dichroism spectroscopy. Finally, UV&#8208;Vis and redox assays suggested that the addition pattern has a reflection in the light&#8208;harvesting and redox properties of the bisadduct.

         <title>Diphenylalanine Motif Drives Self&#8208;Assembling in Hybrid PNA&#8208;Peptide Conjugates</title>

Forces triggering self&#8208;assembly. Conjugates of the PNA gc to the dipeptide FF assemble in water, producing fluorescent materials. Watson&#8208;Crick hydrogen bonds between complementary nucleobases and aromatic interactions between amino acids could stabilize the aggregate. The latter mainly drive the aggregation process.







Abstract
Peptides and nucleic acids can self&#8208;assemble to give supramolecular structures that find application in different fields, ranging from the delivery of drugs to the obtainment of materials endowed with optical properties. Forces that stabilize the &#8220;suprastructures&#8221; typically are hydrogen bonds or aromatic interactions; in case of nucleic acids, Watson&#8208;Crick pairing drives self&#8208;assembly while, in case of peptides, backbone hydrogen bonds and interactions between aromatic side chains trigger the formation of structures, such as nanotubes or ribbons. Molecules containing both aromatic peptides and nucleic acids could in principle exploit different forces to self&#8208;assemble. In this work we meant to investigate the self&#8208;assembly of mixed systems, with the aim to understand which forces play a major role and determine formation/structure of aggregates. We therefore synthesized conjugates of the peptide FF to the peptide nucleic acid dimer &#8220;gc&#8221; and characterized their aggregates by different spectroscopic techniques, including NMR, CD and fluorescence.

         <title>Study of the Lithium Storage Mechanism of N&#8208;Doped Carbon&#8208;Modified Cu2S Electrodes for Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ad LIB: In this study, thermal carbon reduction of CuS into Cu2S was monitored by high&#8208;temperature synchrotron radiation diffraction (SRD). As LIB electrode material, Li+ storage intermediate Cu1.8S is confirmed by operando methods. The result shows that some original Cu2S remains unreacted after the first cycle, and carbon modification can improve the cycling stability of Cu2S for LIBs in the long&#8208;term cycle.







Abstract
Owing to their high specific capacity and abundant reserve, CuxS compounds are promising electrode materials for lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs). Carbon compositing could stabilize the CuxS structure and repress capacity fading during the electrochemical cycling, but the corresponding Li+ storage mechanism and stabilization effect should be further clarified. In this study, nanoscale Cu2S was synthesized by CuS co&#8208;precipitation and thermal reduction with polyelectrolytes. High&#8208;temperature synchrotron radiation diffraction was used to monitor the thermal reduction process. During the first cycle, the conversion mechanism upon lithium storage in the Cu2S/carbon was elucidated by operando synchrotron radiation diffraction and in&#8197;situ X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy. The N&#8208;doped carbon&#8208;composited Cu2S (Cu2S/C) exhibits an initial discharge capacity of 425&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1, with a higher, long&#8208;term capacity of 523&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 200 cycles; in contrast, the bare CuS electrode exhibits 123&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 200 cycles. Multiple&#8208;scan cyclic voltammetry proves that extra Li+ storage can mainly be ascribed to the contribution of the capacitive storage.

         <title>Efficient Entropy&#8208;Driven Inhibition of Dipeptidyl Peptidase III by Hydroxyethylene Transition&#8208;State Peptidomimetics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A transition&#8208;state&#8208;based inhibitor has been developed which efficiently inhibits the metalloprotease dipeptidylpeptidase 3 (DPP3) by releasing structured water molecules from the binding cleft.







Abstract
Dipeptidyl peptidase III (DPP3) is a ubiquitously expressed Zn&#8208;dependent protease, which plays an important role in regulating endogenous peptide hormones, such as enkephalins or angiotensins. In previous biophysical studies, it could be shown that substrate binding is driven by a large entropic contribution due to the release of water molecules from the closing binding cleft. Here, the design, synthesis and biophysical characterization of peptidomimetic inhibitors is reported, using for the first time an hydroxyethylene transition&#8208;state mimetic for a metalloprotease. Efficient routes for the synthesis of both stereoisomers of the pseudopeptide core were developed, which allowed the synthesis of peptidomimetic inhibitors mimicking the VVYPW&#8208;motif of tynorphin. The best inhibitors inhibit DPP3 in the low &#956;M range. Biophysical characterization by means of ITC measurement and X&#8208;ray crystallography confirm the unusual entropy&#8208;driven mode of binding. Stability assays demonstrated the desired stability of these inhibitors, which efficiently inhibited DPP3 in mouse brain homogenate.

         <dc:description>A metal&#8208;free a&#8208;aminomethylation of heteroaryls promoted by eosin Y under green light irradiation is reported. A large variety of a&#8208;trimethylsilylamines as precursor of a&#8208;aminomethyl radical species were engaged to functionalize sulfonyl&#8208;heteroaryls following a Homolytic Aromatic Substitution (HAS) pathway. This method has provided a range of a&#8208;aminoheteroaryl compounds including a functionalized natural product. The mechanism of this late&#8208;stage functionalization of aryls was investigated and suggests the formation of a sulfonyl radical intermediate over a reductive quenching cycle.</dc:description>

         <title>Take a &#8220;Snapshot&#8221; of New Syntheses, Reactions and Characterizations from Unusual Unsaturated Ring Strained Group 4 Metallacycles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Recently published syntheses, reactions and characterization of unusual unsaturated ring strained Group 4 metallocene metallacycles like metalla&#8208;cyclocumulenes, &#8208;cycloallenes and &#8208;cycloalkynes with different ring size are updated  for the last three years. There exist for some of these metallacycles, depending on the ring size, 7&#8208;, 5&#8208; and 4&#8208;membered compounds. The new results for these metallacycles are summarized here and considered in addition to the former published results. Additionally, several compounds of this type were now characterized by new reactions. For a better understanding of these compounds, some spectroscopical methods as well as theoretical calculations were published. Despite of these  all  &#8208;C&#8208;metallacycles, only in some cases the syntheses and reactions for the corresponding  hetero  &#8208;metallacycles were published too. Examples for these metallaheterocyclic compounds will not be considered in this article. All these unusual ring strained compounds have a great potential for a lot of interesting synthetic applications in the future. Additionally, are they very interesting from the theoretical point of view.</dc:description>

         <title>Perylene Bisimide&#8208;Cored Supramolecular Coordination Complexes: Interplay between Ensembles, Excited State Processes, and Aggregation Behaviors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Manipulating the optical properties of fluorescent species is challenging owing to complicated and tedious synthetic works. Herein, the photophysical properties of perylene bisimide (PBI) were effectively tuned by varying the geometrical arrangement of PBI moieties within supramolecular coordination complexes (SCCs), where a PBI&#8208;based dicycle (  2  ) and a trigonal prism (  3  ) were generated  via  using a typical 90&#176; Pt(II) reagent,  cis  &#8208;(PEt  3  )  2  Pt(OTf)  2  &#8208;based coordination&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly approach. The ligand, an  ortho  &#8208;tetrapyridiyl&#8208;PBI (  1  ), exhibits a moderate fluorescence quantum yield (~13%) and efficient inter&#8208;system crossing (ISC).  2  , however, is much more emissive with a fluorescence quantum yield of ~41%, and the relevant ISC process is significantly hindered. The fluorescence quantum yield of  3  is merely ~6% due to the observed symmetry&#8208;breaking charge separation (SB&#8208;CS), which turns to triplet state upon charge recombination. Interestingly,  3  could be fully transformed into  2  by simply adding a suitable amount of a 90&#176; Pt(II)&#8208;based neutral triangle. Moreover,  2  tends to form discrete dimers both in crystal and solution states, but  3  does not show the property. Therefore, controling geometrical arrangement of fluorophores through coordination&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly could be taken as another effective way to tune their excited state relaxation pathways and construct high&#8208;performance optical molecular materials, which generally have to be prepared  via  organic synthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>Nanoparticles for Triple Drug Release for Combined Chemo&#8208; and Photodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A pH&#8208;responsive drug delivery system (DDS) based on mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs) has been prepared for the delivery of three anticancer drugs with different modes of action. The novelty of this system is its ability to combine a synergistic chemotherapy and photodynamic therapy. Herein, a photoactive conjugate of a phthalocyanine (Pc) and a topoisomerase I inhibitor (topo&#8208;I), namely camptothecin (CPT), linked by a polyethylene glycol (PEG) chain has been synthesized and then loaded into the mesopores of MSNs. Doxorubicin (DOX), which is a topoisomerase II inhibitor (topo&#8208;II), has also been covalently anchored to the outer surface of the MSNs through a dihydrazide polyethylene glycol linker. In the acidic environment of tumor cells, selective release of the three drugs takes place.  In vitro  studies have demonstrated the endocytosis of the system into HeLa and HepG2 cells and the subsequent release of the three drugs into the cytoplasm and nucleus. Furthermore, the cytotoxic effect of DOX, CPT and Pc has been assessed  in vitro  before and upon light irradiation.</dc:description>

         <title>Facile conversion of molecularly complex (hetero)aryl carboxylic acids into alkynes for accelerated SAR exploration</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>1,2,3&#8208;Triazoles are well&#8208;established bioisosteres for amides, often installed as a result of structure&#8208;activity&#8208;relationship (SAR) exploration. A straightforward approach to assess the effect of the replacement of an amide by a triazole would start from the carboxylic acid and the amine used for the formation of a given amide and convert them into the corresponding alkyne and azide for cyclization via copper&#8208;catalyzed alkyne&#8208;azide cycloaddition (CuAAC). Herein, we report a functional&#8208;group&#8208;tolerant and operationally simple decarbonylative alkynylation reaction allowing the conversion of complex (hetero)aryl carboxylic acids into alkynes. Furthermore, the utility of this method was demonstrated in the preparation of a triazolo analog of the commercial drug moclobemide. Lastly, mechanistic investigations using labelled carboxylic acid derivatives clearly show the decarbonylative nature of this transformation.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Polyoxometalates (POMs) can act as unique reservoirs for multiple electron transfers. As POMs display only weak absorption in the visible spectrum, they can be associated with chromophores such as porphyrins and porphyrin antennae.

         <dc:description>Abstract:&#160; The catalytic metathesis of C=C bonds is a textbook reaction that has no parallel in the widely studied area of multiple bonds involving heavier p&#8208;block elements. We have discovered a high&#8208;yielding P=C bond metathesis of phosphaalkenes (ArP=CPh 2 , Ar = Mes,&#160; o &#8208;Tol, Ph) that is catalyzed by N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes (NHC = Me 2 IMe, Me 2 I i Pr). The products are cyclic oligomers formally derived from ArP=PAr [i.e.&#160; cyclo &#8208;(ArP) n ; n = 3, 4, 5, 6] and Ph 2 C=CPh 2 . Preliminary mechanistic studies of this remarkable transformation have established NHC=PAr (Ar = Mes,&#160; o &#8208;Tol, Ph) as key phosphinidene transfer agents. In addition, novel cyclic intermediates, such as,&#160; cyclo &#8208;(ArP) 2 CPh 2&#160; and&#160; cyclo &#8208;(ArP) 4 CPh 2&#160; have also been observed. This work represents a rare application of non&#8208;metal&#8208;based catalysts for transformations involving main&#8208;group elements.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Cationic cyclophanes are widely used in a variety of applications in supramolecular chemistry and materials science. In this work we systematically study the integration of electron&#8208;rich diboron units with B  II  atoms into polycationic cyclophanes with viologen&#8208;like electron&#8208;acceptor units. We also report a first hexacationic cage&#8208;compound in which three diboron units connect two tris(4&#8208;pyridyl)triazine acceptor units. Moreover, di&#8208; and tetracationic open&#8208;structure compounds, in which one diboron unit connects two bispyridyl groups, were synthesized and the properties compared to those of the corresponding closed structures (cyclophanes). The combination of diboron electron&#8208;donor units and bi&#8208; or oligopyridyl electron&#8208;acceptor units leads to intriguing optical and redox properties.</dc:description>

         <title>Steering Scholl Oxidative Heterocoupling by Tuning Topology and Electronics for Building Thiananographenes and Their Functional N&#8208;/C&#8208;Congeners</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>While intramolecular Scholl oxidative coupling between two arenes is common, successful C&#8208;C heterocoupling between thiophene and arene is scarce. The latter is due to the notorious reactivity of thiophene towards polymerization under oxidative conditions. This report systematically demonstrates how topological variation of electronics and reactivity in thiophene substrates can lead to efficient oxidative heterocoupling. Bis(biaryl)thiophenes having reactive &#945;&#8208; and &#946;&#8208;positions open are the choice of substrates. The cyclizing arene partners are so electronically tuned for thiophene&#8217;s reactivity (at &#945;&#8208; and &#946;&#8208;) as to establish C&#8208;C bond oxidatively generating symmetrical as well as unsymmetrical diphenanthrothiophenes &#8211; basic thiananographenes. Depending on the cyclizing&#8208;couple&#8217;s electronics, either arene&#8208; or thiophene&#8208;centered oxidation initiates C&#8208;C heterocoupling. The potential utility of these simple thiananographenes is further unfurled by converting them to functional N&#8208;/C&#8208;graphene segments that are aza&#8208;corannulene precursor and tetrabenzospirobifluorene. Their bright emission and extended electrochemical stability are remarkable that may be potentially important and applicable.</dc:description>

         <title>C&#8722;C Cross&#8208;Couplings from a Cyclometalated Au(III) C
N Complex: Mechanistic Insights and Synthetic Developments</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The mechanism of C(sp2)&#8722;C(sp) coupling templated by the Au(III) cyclometalated complex [Au(CCH2N)Cl2] has been investigated. By tuning the reaction conditions and monitoring its progress by NMR, a number of intermediate species involved in the reductive elimination process could be isolated and characterised by different spectroscopic and analytical methods, including XRD, as well as by DFT studies.







Abstract
In recent years, the reactivity of gold complexes was shown to extend well beyond &#960;&#8208;activation and to hold promises to achieve selective cross&#8208;couplings in several C&#8722;C and C&#8722;E (E=heteroatom) bond forming reactions. Here, with the aim of exploiting new organometallic species for cross&#8208;coupling reactions, we report on the Au(III)&#8208;mediated C(sp2)&#8722;C(sp) occurring upon reaction of the cyclometalated complex [Au(CCH2N)Cl2] (1, CCH2N=2&#8208;benzylpyridine) with AgPhCC. The reaction progress has been monitored by NMR spectroscopy, demonstrating the involvement of a number of key intermediates, whose structures have been unambiguously ascertained through 1D and 2D NMR analyses (1H, 13C, 1H&#8208;1H COSY, 1H&#8208;13C HSQC and 1H&#8208;13C HMBC) as well as by HR&#8208;ESI&#8208;MS and X&#8208;ray diffraction studies. Furthermore, crystallographic studies have serendipitously resulted in the authentication of zwitterionic Au(I) complexes as side&#8208;products arising from cyclization of the coupling product in the coordination sphere of gold. The experimental work has been paralleled and complemented by DFT calculations of the reaction profiles, providing valuable insight into the structure and energetics of the key intermediates and transition states, as well as on the coordination sphere of gold along the whole process. Of note, the broader scope of the cross&#8208;coupling at the Au(III) CCH2N centre has also been demonstrated studying the reaction of 1 with C(sp2)&#8208;based nucleophiles, namely vinyl and heteroaryl tin and zinc reagents. These reactions stand as rare examples of C(sp2)&#8722;C(sp2) cross&#8208;couplings at Au(III).

         <title>Additive and Emergent Catalytic Properties of Dimeric Unnatural Amino Acid Derivatives: Aldol and Conjugate Additions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Different densely substituted L&#8208; and D&#8208;proline esters were prepared by asymmetric (3+2) cycloaddition reactions catalyzed by conveniently selected EhuPhos chiral ligands. The &#947;&#8208;nitro&#8208;2&#8208;alkoxycarbonyl pyrrolidines thus obtained in either their  endo  or  exo  forms were functionalized and coupled to yield the corresponding &#947;&#8208;dipeptides. The catalytic properties of these latter dimers were examined using aldol and conjugate additions as case studies. When aldol reactions were analyzed, an additive behavior in terms of stereocontrol was observed on going from the monomers to the dimers. In contrast, in the case of the conjugate additions between ketones and nitroalkenes, the monomers did not catalyze this reaction, whereas the different &#947;&#8208;dipeptides promoted the formation of the corresponding Michael adducts. Therefore, in this latter case emergent catalytic properties were observed for these novel &#947;&#8208;dipeptides based on unnatural proline derivatives. Under certain conditions (stoichiometric amounts of ketone, acid and nitroalkene), formation of  N&#8208;  acyloxy&#8208;2&#8208;oxooctahydro&#8208;1  H  &#8208;indoles was observed.</dc:description>

         <title>Construction of CoS2/Zn0.5Cd0.5S S&#8208;scheme heterojunction for enhancing H2 evolution activity under visible light</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In the field of photocatalysis, building a heterojunction is an effective way to promote electron transfer and enhance the reducibility of electrons. Herein, the S&#8208;scheme&#160;heterojunction photocatalyst&#160;(CoS  2  /Zn  0.5  Cd  0.5  S) of CoS  2  &#160;nanospheres&#160;modified Zn  0.5  Cd  0.5  S solid solution&#160;was synthesized and studied. The H  2  &#160;evolution&#160;rate of composite catalyst reached 25.15 mmol&#183;g  &#8208;1  &#183;h  &#8208;1  , which was 3.26 times that of single&#160;Zn  0.5  Cd  0.5  S, while pure CoS  2  &#160;showed almost no hydrogen production activity.&#160;Moreover,&#160;CoS  2  /Zn  0.5  Cd  0.5  S&#160;had excellent stability, and the hydrogen production&#160;rate after six&#160;cycles of experiments only dropped by 6.19%.&#160;In addition, photoluminescence spectroscopy and photoelectrochemical experiments&#160;had effectively proved that the photogenerated carrier transfer rate of CoS  2  /Zn  0.5  Cd  0.5  S&#160;was&#160;better than CoS  2  &#160;or&#160;Zn  0.5  Cd  0.5  S&#160;single catalyst.&#160;In this study, the synthesized CoS  2  &#160;and Zn  0.5  Cd  0.5  S were&#160;both n&#8208;type semiconductors. After close contact, they followed an S&#8208;scheme heterojunction electron transfer mechanism, which not only promoted the separation of their respective holes and electrons, but also retained a stronger reduction potential, thus promoting the reduction of H  +  &#160;protons in photocatalytic experiments. In short, this work provided&#160;a new basis for the construction of S&#8208;scheme&#160;heterojunction&#160;in addition to being used for photocatalytic hydrogen production.</dc:description>

         <title>Salicylideneaniline is a Photoswitchable Ferroelectric Crystal</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Since the discovery of the first ferroelectric Rochelle salt, most ferroelectrics have been investigated showing thermally triggered symmetry&#8208;breaking phase transition. Although photochromism arising from geometrical isomerization has been reported earlier in 1867, such photoswitchable ferroelectric crystals have scarcely been developed to date. Herein, we report that salicylideneaniline is a photochromic ferroelectric crystal. Upon photoirradiation, the dielectric constant shows obvious switching between high and low dielectric states, and more importantly, the ferroelectric polarization demonstrates quickly and reversibly switching. This work opens the gate of developing photoswitchable ferroelectrics, which holds great potential for applications in optically controlled smart devices.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An electrochemical three component cascade phosphorylation of various heteroatoms&#8208;containing nucleophiles including carbazoles, phenols, alcohols, and thiols with Ph  2  PH has been established. Electricity is used as the &#8220;traceless&#8221; oxidant and water and air are utilized as the &#8220;green&#8221; oxygen source. All kinds of structurally diverse organophosphorus compounds with P(O)&#8208;N/P(O)&#8208;O/P(O)&#8208;S bonds are assembled in moderate to excellent yields (three categories of phosphorylation products, 48 examples, up to 97% yield). A tentative free radical course is put forward to rationalize the reaction procedure.</dc:description>

         <title>Structure&#8208;based design, synthesis, and biological evaluation of Hsp90&#946;&#8208;selective inhibitors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The 90 kDa heat shock proteins (Hsp90) are molecular chaperones that are responsible for the folding and/or trafficking of ~400 client proteins, many of which are directly associated with cancer progression. Consequently, inhibition of Hsp90 can exhibit similar activity as combination therapy as multiple signaling nodes can be targeted simultaneously. In fact, seventeen small&#8208;molecule inhibitors that bind the Hsp90 N&#8208;terminus entered clinical trials for the treatment of cancer, all of which exhibited pan&#8208;inhibitory activity against all four Hsp90 isoforms. Unfortunately, most demonstrated undesired effects alongside induction of the pro&#8208;survival heat shock response. As a result, isoform&#8208;selective inhibitors have been sought to overcome these detriments. Described herein is a structure&#8208;based approach to design Hsp90&#946;&#8208;selective inhibitors along with preliminary SAR. In the end, compound  5  was shown to manifest ~370&#8208;fold selectivity for Hsp90&#946; versus Hsp90&#945;, and induced the degradation of select Hsp90&#946;&#8208;dependent clients. These data support the development of Hsp90&#946;&#8208;selective inhibitors as a new paradigm to overcome the detriments associated with pan&#8208;inhibition of Hsp90.</dc:description>

         <title>Facile Synthesis of Azahelicenes and Diaza[8]circulenes through the Intramolecular Scholl Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Carbazole&#8208;based aza[7]helicenes and hetero[9]helicenes were successfully obtained via the intramolecular Scholl reaction of 3,6&#8208;bis(biphenyl&#8208;2&#8208;yl)carbazole congeners, while the reaction of 3,6&#8208;bis(naphthylphenyl)&#8208;appended carbazole gave a triple helicene via an unexpected simultaneous double aryl rearrangement. DFT calculations suggested that the rearrangement proceeded via an arenium cation intermediate. In addition, the reaction of methoxy&#8208;appended substrate gave an azahepta[8]circulene via the concurrent C&#8211;C bond formation. These helical dyes showed circularly polarized luminescence. The azahepta[8]circulene was further transformed into deeply saddle&#8208;distorted dibenzodiaza[8]circulenes as the first example of its solution&#8208;based synthesis and unambiguous structural determination .</dc:description>

         <title>Stereospecific on&#8208;Surface Cyclodehydrogenation of Bishelicenes: Preservation of Handedness from Helical to Planar Chirality</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Flattening helices while keeping the handedness: On&#8208;surface cyclodehydrogenation of bishelicene enantiomers leads stereospecifically to (M,M) and (P,P) chiral planar polyaromatic hydrocarbons. This is followed by their homochiral aggregation into a 2D conglomerate. Thermally induced cyclodehydrogenation proceeds stereospecifically to chiral, planar coronocoronene. Such a reaction is a special example of topochemistry in which enantiospecific conversion is supported by the alignment of the reactant by the surface.

         <title>Canopy Catalysts for Alkyne Metathesis: Investigations into a Bimolecular Decomposition Pathway and the Stability of the Podand Cap</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Vulnerable? The activity and functional group tolerance of metal alkylidyne canopy catalysts for alkyne metathesis is excellent, but their stability leaves room for optimization. The search for the Achilles&#8242; heels unveiled a new decomposition pathway through bimolecular coupling and led to the discovery of a facile cyclo&#8208;tetramerization reaction by (reversible) opening of the tripodal ligand cage.







Abstract
Molybdenum alkylidyne complexes with a trisilanolate podand ligand framework (&#8220;canopy catalysts&#8221;) are the arguably most selective catalysts for alkyne metathesis known to date. Among them, complex 1&#8201;a endowed with a fence of lateral methyl substituents on the silicon linkers is the most reactive, although fairly high loadings are required in certain applications. It is now shown that this catalyst decomposes readily via a bimolecular pathway that engages the Mo&#8801;CR entities in a stoichiometric triple&#8208;bond metathesis event to furnish RC&#8801;CR and the corresponding dinuclear complex, 8, with a Mo&#8801;Mo core. In addition to the regular analytical techniques, 95Mo NMR was used to confirm this unusual outcome. This rapid degradation mechanism is largely avoided by increasing the size of the peripheral substituents on silicon, without unduly compromising the activity of the resulting complexes. When chemically challenged, however, canopy catalysts can open the apparently somewhat strained tripodal ligand cages; this reorganization leads to the formation of cyclo&#8208;tetrameric arrays composed of four metal alkylidyne units linked together via one silanol arm of the ligand backbone. The analogous tungsten alkylidyne complex 6, endowed with a tripodal tris&#8208;alkoxide (rather than siloxide) ligand framework, is even more susceptible to such a controlled and reversible cyclo&#8208;oligomerization. The structures of the resulting giant macrocyclic ensembles were established by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction.

         <title>Photoelectrochemical Reduction of Carbon Dioxide with a Copper Graphitic Carbon Nitride Photocathode</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Shining visible light and passing DC current through a carbon nitride material doped with copper atoms catalyzes the selective reduction of the greenhouse gas, carbon dioxide, to an important chemical intermediate, carbon monoxide. X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy was used to show how visible light increases the current and activity of the material. More information can be found in the Communication by R. Neumann et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202101820).

         <title>Determining the Diastereoselectivity of the Formation of Dipeptidonucleotides by NMR Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The origin of homochirality is one of the unresolved issues of prebiotic chemistry. Why are the amino acids found in proteins of the l configuration? Perhaps peptido nucleotides could have played a role as transitional species, as suggested visually by the Archaeopteryx in the image. It was recently shown that these phosphoramidate&#8208;linked species form spontaneously from simple precursors. Now, the diastereoselectivity of the the dipeptide&#8208;forming step has been determined by in&#8208;situ NMR spectroscopy, revealing that homochiral products are preferred. This is reported in the Full Paper by C. Richert et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202101630).

         <dc:description>
A transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free method using tert&#8208;butyl hypoiodite (t&#8208;BuOI) or N&#8208;iodosuccinimide (NIS) for the intramolecular C&#8722;H amination of N&#8208;alkylsulfamides is reported. The six&#8208;membered cyclic sulfamide products can be easily converted into a variety of useful 1,3&#8208;diamines. The present amination that effectively proceeds under ambient conditions, features operationally simple, practical, and scalable methodology.







Abstract
1,3&#8208;Diamines are an important class of compounds that are broadly found in natural products and are also widely used as building blocks in organic synthesis. Although the intramolecular C&#8722;H amination of N&#8208;alkylsulfamide derivatives is a reliable method for the construction of 1,3&#8208;diamine structures, the majority of these methods involve the use of a transition&#8208;metal catalyst. We herein report on a new transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free method using tert&#8208;butyl hypoiodite (t&#8208;BuOI) or N&#8208;iodosuccinimide (NIS), enabling secondary non&#8208;benzylic and tertiary C&#8722;H amination reactions to proceed. The cyclic sulfamide products can be easily transformed into 1,3&#8208;diamines. Mechanistic investigations revealed that amination reactions using t&#8208;BuOI or NIS each proceed via different pathways.

         <title>Size&#8208;Controlled Hapticity Switching in [Ln(C9H9)(C8H8)] Sandwiches</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;symmetry organometallic sandwiches of lanthanides are of current high interest because of their magnetic and optical properties. When trivalent lanthanide complexes feature the large monoanionic cyclononatetraenyl (Cnt) ligand, an interesting hapticity switching is observed along with a decrease in the size of the metal center. This cover shows the structural evolution from the terbium to the lutecium metal ion. More information can be found in the Full Paper by P.&#8197;W. Roesky, G. Nocton, et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202101599).

         <title>Chemodynamic Therapy Combined with Multifunctional Nanomaterials and Their Applications in Tumor Treatment</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The latest applications of chemodynamic therapy (CDT) combined with multifunctional nanomaterials in tumor treatment are summarized. Nanomaterials with different characteristics can optimize the Fenton reaction and Fenton&#8208;like reaction to make CDT produce distinctive enhancement effects. The combination of nanomaterials, CDT and various other therapies would promote the multi&#8208;functionalization of the treatment system, thereby enhancing the anticancer effect.







Abstract
During the past few decades, radiotherapy and chemotherapy have been the standard approaches for tumor treatments. However, the potential toxic effect and side effects of both radiotherapy and chemotherapy on the human body still cannot be neglected. Given this, the Fenton reaction has become one of the most effective treatment strategies to combat tumor cells. This review aims to summarize the recent advances comprehensively and systematically in chemodynamic therapy (CDT) via the Fenton reaction. In addition, a host of the advanced nano&#8208;multifunctional materials and engineering bacteria used in the Fenton reaction were also summarized. This paper would be helpful to provide guidance and lay firm foundations for future tumor treatment.

         <title>Target&#8208;Dependent Protection of DNA Aptamers Against Nucleolytic Digestion Enables Signal&#8208;On Biosensing with Toehold&#8208;Mediated Rolling Circle Amplification</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report a generalizable strategy for biosensing that takes advantage of the resistance of DNA aptamers against nuclease digestion when bound with their targets, coupled with toehold mediated strand displacement (TMSD) and rolling circle amplification (RCA). A DNA aptamer containing a toehold extension at its 5 &#162; &#8208;end protects it from 3 &#162; &#8208;exonuclease digestion by phi29 DNA polymerase (phi29 DP) in a concentration&#8208;dependent manner. The protected aptamer can participate in RCA in the presence of a circular template that is designed to free the aptamer from its target via TMSD. The absence of the target leads to aptamer digestion, and thus no RCA product is produced, resulting in a turn&#8208;on sensor. Using two different DNA aptamers, we demonstrate rapid and quantitative real&#8208;time fluorescence detection of two human proteins: platelet&#8208;derived growth factor (PDGF) and thrombin. Sensitive detection of PDGF was also achieved in human serum and human plasma, demonstrating the selectivity of the assay,</dc:description>

         <title>Hydrogen and Halogen Bonding in Homogeneous External Electric Fields: Modulating the Bond Strengths</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The sensitivity of single and multiple hydrogen (H) and halogen (X) bonding to external electric fields (EEFs) was analyzed. Computations show that the variations of X&#8208;bonds mainly stem from the covalency change, while generally the steric effect governs the response of H&#8208;bonds to EEFs. X&#8208;bonds are more sensitive to EEFs, with the key difference from H&#8208;bonds lying in the charge transfer interaction. The sensitivity in multiple&#8208;bonding cases can be regulated by the permutations of noncovalent interactions.







Abstract
Recent years have witnessed various fascinating phenomena arising from the interactions of noncovalent bonds with homogeneous external electric fields (EEFs). Here we performed a computational study to interpret the sensitivity of intrinsic bond strengths to EEFs in terms of steric effect and orbital interactions. The block&#8208;localized wavefunction (BLW) method, which combines the advantages of both ab initio valence bond (VB) theory and molecular orbital (MO) theory, and the subsequent energy decomposition (BLW&#8208;ED) approach were adopted. The sensitivity was monitored and analyzed using the induced energy term, which is the variation in each energy component along the EEF strength. Systems with single or multiple hydrogen (H) or halogen (X) bond(s) were also examined. It was found that the X&#8208;bond strength change to EEFs mainly stems from the covalency change, while generally the steric effect rules the response of H&#8208;bonds to EEFs. Furthermore, X&#8208;bonds are more sensitive to EEFs, with the key difference between H&#8208; and X&#8208;bonds lying in the charge transfer interaction. Since phenylboronic acid has been experimentally used as a smart linker in EEFs, switchable sensitivity was scrutinized with the example of the phenylboronic acid dimer, which exhibits two conformations with either antiparallel or parallel H&#8208;bonds, thereby, opposite or consistent responses to EEFs. Among the studied systems, the quadruple X&#8208;bonds in molecular capsules exhibit remarkable sensitivity, with its interaction energy increased by &#8722;95.2&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1 at the EEF strength 0.005&#8197;a.u.

         <title>Peptide Cyclization Mediated by Metal&#8208;Free S&#8208;Arylation: S&#8208;Protected Cysteine Sulfoxide as an Umpolung of the Cysteine Nucleophile</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Acid&#8208;mediated activation of an S&#8208;protected cysteine sulfoxide allows for the cyclization of peptides through metal&#8208;free C&#8722;H sulfenylation of arenes. The less electrophilic S&#8208;p&#8208;methoxybenzyl cysteine sulfoxide serves as an acid&#8208;activated umpolung of nucleophilic cysteine in the presence of guanidine hydrochloride under acidic conditions. It is useful for S&#8208;arylation&#8208;mediated peptide cyclization, which results in the synthesis of an Amatoxin derivative and stapled peptide possessing a tryptathionine structure.







Abstract
Covalent linking of side chains provides a method to produce cyclic or stapled peptides that are important in developing peptide&#8208;based drugs. A variety of crosslinking formats contribute to fixing the active conformer and prolonging its biological activity under physiological conditions. One format uses the cysteine thiol to participate in crosslinking through nucleophilic thiolate anions or thiyl radicals to form thioether and disulfide bonds. Removal of the S&#8208;protection from an S&#8208;protected Cys derivative generates the thiol, which functions as a nucleophile. S&#8208;Oxidation of a protected Cys allows the formation of a sulfoxide that operates as an umpolung electrophile. Herein, the applicability of S&#8208;p&#8208;methoxybenzyl Cys sulfoxide (Cys(MBzl)(O)) to the formation of a thioether linkage between tryptophan and Cys has been investigated. The reaction of peptides containing Cys(MBzl)(O) and Trp with trifluoromethanesulfonic acid (TFMSA) or methanesulfonic acid (MSA) in TFA in the presence of guanidine hydrochloride (Gn&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;HCl) proceeded to give cyclic or stapled peptides possessing the Cys&#8208;Trp thioether linkage. In this reaction, strong acids such as TFMSA or MSA are necessary to activate the sulfoxide. Additionally, Gn&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;HCl plays a critical role in producing an electrophilic Cys derivative that combines with the indole by aromatic electrophilic substitution. The findings led us to conclude that the less&#8208;electrophilic Cys(MBzl)(O) serves as an acid&#8208;activated umpolung of a Cys nucleophile and is useful for S&#8208;arylation&#8208;mediated peptide cyclization.

         <title>N&#8208;Type Quinoidal Polymers Based on Dipyrrolopyrazinedione for Application in All&#8208;Polymer Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two intrinsic quinoidal conjugated polymers (PzDP&#8208;T and PzDP&#8208;ffT) based on dipyrrolopyrazinedione were developed for the use as polymer acceptors in all&#8208;polymer solar cells (all&#8208;PSCs). The all&#8208;PSCs with pseudo&#8208;bilayer structure exhibited PCEs of 1.33 and 2.37&#8201;% for PzDP&#8208;T and PzDP&#8208;ffT, respectively. This is the first report on the application of intrinsic quinoidal conjugated polymers in all&#8208;PSCs.







Abstract
Conjugated molecules and polymers with intrinsic quinoidal structure are promising n&#8208;type organic semiconductors, which have been reported for application in field&#8208;effect transistors and thermoelectric devices. In principle, the molecular and electronic characteristics of quinoidal polymers can also enable their application in organic solar cells. Herein, two quinoidal polymers, named PzDP&#8208;T and PzDP&#8208;ffT, based on dipyrrolopyrazinedione were synthesized and used as electron acceptors in all&#8208;polymer solar cells (all&#8208;PSCs). Both PzDP&#8208;T and PzDP&#8208;ffT showed suitable energy levels and wide light absorption range that extended to the near&#8208;infrared region. When combined with the polymer donor PBDB&#8208;T, the resulting all&#8208;PSCs based on PzDP&#8208;T and PzDP&#8208;ffT exhibited a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 1.33 and 2.37&#8201;%, respectively. This is the first report on the application of intrinsic quinoidal conjugated polymers in all&#8208;PSCs. The photovoltaic performance of the all&#8208;PSCs was revealed to be mainly limited by the relatively poor and imbalanced charge transport, considerable charge recombination. Detailed investigations on the structure&#8208;performance relationship suggested that synergistic optimization of light absorption, energy levels, and charge transport properties is needed to achieve more successful application of intrinsic quinoidal conjugated polymers in all&#8208;PSCs.

         <title>Engineered Cell&#8208;Penetrating Peptides for Mitochondrion&#8208;Targeted Drug Delivery in Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mitochondrion is a promising target in cancer therapy. However, gaining access to this organelle is difficult due to the obstacles to cross the complicated mitochondrial membrane. Cell&#8208;penetrating peptides (CPPs) with mitochondrion&#8208;targeting ability, named mitochondrion&#8208;targeting peptides (MTPs), are efficient tools to deliver exogenous therapeutics into mitochondria. Herein, we report several new MTPs, which can be readily synthesized via resin&#8208;based solid&#8208;phase peptide synthesis. In particular, MTP3 (compound 5), consisting of three positively charged arginines and two D&#8208; and L&#8208; alternating naphthylalanines, demonstrated excellent mitochondrion&#8208;targeting ability with high Pearson&#8217;s correlation coefficient, suggesting that MTP3 has good potential for mitochondrion&#8208;targeted drug delivery. As proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, the feasibility of MTP3 was validated by the preparation of a mitochondrion&#8208;targeting prodrug (compound 17, doxorubicin&#8208;based prodrug). This prodrug was subsequently confirmed to be specifically transported to the mitochondria of tumour cells, where it was able to release the native doxorubicin upon intracellular GSH activation, leading to mitochondrial depolarization and eventually cell death. Importantly, compound 17 showed good cytotoxicity against human tumour cells while negligible toxicity towards normal cells, indicating its potential as a potent mitochondrial medicine for targeted cancer therapy. Our study thus opens a way for engineered CPPs to be used to deliver bioactive cargos in mitochondrion&#8208;targeted cancer therapy.</dc:description>

         <title>High&#8208;Temperature and Large&#8208;Polarization Ferroelectric with Second Harmonic Generation Response in a Novel Crown Ether Clathrate</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A modern material: A novel high&#8208;temperature host&#8208;guest inclusion ferroelectric, [(C6H5NF3)(18&#8208;crown&#8208;6)][BF4], has successfully been synthesized; it underwent a reversible structural phase transition around Tc=348&#8197;K, with a wide band gap of 4.43&#8197;eV. The chief contributors to this are the C, H and O atoms of the crystals, the obvious second harmonic generation response and the large value of spontaneous ferroelectric polarization of around 4.06&#8197;&#956;C/cm2.







Abstract
Molecular ferroelectrics of high&#8208;temperature reversible phase transitions are very rare and have attracted increasing attention in recent years. In this paper is described the successful synthesis of a novel high&#8208;temperature host&#8208;guest inclusion ferroelectric: [(C6H5NF3)(18&#8208;crown&#8208;6)][BF4] (1) that shows a pair of reversible peaks at 348&#8197;K (heating) and 331&#8197;K (cooling) with a heat hysteresis about 17&#8197;K by differential scanning calorimetry measurements, thus indicating that 1 undergoes a reversible structural phase transition. Variable&#8208;temperature PXRD and temperature&#8208;dependent dielectric measurements further prove the phase&#8208;transition behavior of 1. The second harmonic response demonstrates that 1 belongs to a non&#8208;centrosymmetric space group at room temperature and is a good nonlinear optical material. In its semiconducting properties, 1 shows a wide optical band gap of about 4.43&#8197;eV that comes chiefly from the C, H and O atoms of the crystals. In particular, the ferroelectric measurements of 1 exhibit a typical polarization&#8208;electric hysteresis loop with a large spontaneous polarization (Ps) of about 4.06&#8197;&#956;C/cm2. This finding offers an alternative pathway for designing new ferroelectric&#8208;dielectric and nonlinear optical materials and related physical properties in organic&#8208;inorganic and other hybrid crystals.

         <dc:description>Solvent&#8208;mediated crystal&#8208;to&#8208;crystal transformations of [Au  6  Ag  3  Cu  3  (H  2  O)  3  (  d  &#8208;pen)  6  (tdme)  2  ]  3+  (  d  &#8208;[  1  (H  2  O)  3  ]  3+  ; pen  2&#8211;  = penicillaminate, tdme = 1,1,1&#8208;tris(diphenylphosphinomethyl)ethane) to form unique supramolecular species are reported.

         <title>Molecular recognition of natural and non&#8208;natural substrates by cellodextrin phosphorylase from Ruminiclostridium thermocellum investigated by NMR spectroscopy</title>

         <dc:description>&#946;&#8208;1&#8594;4&#8208;glucan polysaccharides like cellulose, derivatives and analogues, are attracting attention due to their unique physicochemical properties, as ideal candidates for many different applications in biotechnology. Access to these polysaccharides with a high level of purity at scale is still challenging, and eco&#8208;friendly alternatives using enzymes  in vitro  are highly desirable. One prominent candidate enzyme is cellodextrin phosphorylase (CDP) from  Ruminiclostridium thermocellum  , which is able to yield cellulose oligomers from short cellodextrins and &#945;&#8208;D&#8208;glucose 1&#8208;phosphate (Glc&#8208;1&#8208;P) as substrates. Remarkably, its broad specificity towards donors and acceptors allows the generation of highly diverse cellulose&#8208;based structures to produce novel materials. However, to fully exploit this CDP broad specificity, a detailed understanding of the molecular recognition of substrates by this enzyme in solution is needed. Herein we provide a detailed investigation of the molecular recognition of ligands by CDP in solution by saturation transfer difference (STD) NMR spectroscopy, tr&#8208;NOESY and protein&#8208;ligand docking. Our results, discussed in the context of previous reaction kinetics data in the literature, allow a better understanding of the structural basis of the broad binding specificity of this biotechnologically relevant enzyme.</dc:description>

         <title>Formation and Structure of Hydrolytic Methylaluminoxane Activators</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Methylaluminoxane (MAO) activators have sheet structures which form ion&#8208;pairs on reaction of neutral donors such as octamethyltrisiloxane (OMTS). The ion&#8208;pairs can be detected by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI&#8208;MS) in polar media. The growth of these reactive precursors during hydrolysis of Me  3  Al can be monitored using ESI&#8208;MS. Density functional theory, combined with numerical simulation of growth, indicates that this process involves rapid formation of low MW oligomers, followed by assembly of these species into low MW sheets. These can grow through further addition of low MW oligomers or by fusion into larger sheets. The mechanism of these growth processes leads to the prediction that even&#8208;numbered sheets should be favored, and this surprising result is confirmed by ESI&#8208;MS monitoring experiments of both activator growth and MAO aging.</dc:description>

         <title>Bifunctional Fluorophosphonium Triflates as Intramolecular Frustrated Lewis Pairs: Reversible CO2 Sequestration and Binding of Carbonyls, Nitriles and Acetylenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Extending the FLP library: Electrophilic fluorophosphonium triflates bearing pyridyl or imidazolyl substituents act as intramolecular N/P frustrated Lewis pairs that are capable of small molecule activation, that is, reversible CO2 sequestration and binding of carbonyls, nitriles and acetylenes.







Abstract
Electrophilic fluorophosphonium triflates bearing pyridyl (3[OTf]) or imidazolyl (4[OTf])&#8208;substituents act as intramolecular frustrated Lewis pairs (FLPs) and reversibly form 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 adducts with CO2 (5+ and 6+). An unusual and labile spirocyclic tetrahedral intermediate (72+) is observed in CO2&#8208;pressurized (0.5&#8211;2.0&#8197;bar) solutions of cation 4+ at low temperatures, as demonstrated by variable&#8208;temperature NMR studies, which were confirmed crystallographically. In addition, cations 3+ and 4+ actively bind carbonyls, nitriles and acetylenes by 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloaddition, as shown by selected examples.

         <title>Fabrication&#160;of ZnSe/C Hollow Polyhedrons for Lithium Storage</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>ZnSe has got extensive attention for high&#8208;performance LIBs anode due to its remarkable theoretical capacity and environmental friendliness. Nevertheless, the large volume variation for the ZnSe in the discharge/charge processes brings about rapid capacity fading and poor rate performance. Herein, ZnSe/C hollow polyhedrons are successfully synthesized through selenization of zeolitic imidazolate framework&#8208;8 (ZIF&#8208;8) with resorcinol&#8208;formaldehyde (RF) coating. The protection of C layer derived from RF coating layer and Ostwald ripening during the process of selenization play important roles in promoting formation of ZnSe/C hollow polyhedrons. The ZnSe/C hollow polyhedrons exhibit good rate behavior and long&#8208;term cycle stability (345 mAh g  &#8722;1  up to 1000 cycles at 1 A g  &#8208;1  ) for lithium ion batteries (LIBs) anode. The improved electrochemical performance is benefit from the unique ZnSe/C hollow architecture, in which the hollow structure can effectively avoid terrible volume expansion, and the thin ZnSe/C shell can not only provide adequate diffusion paths of lithium ions and but also enhance the electronic conductivity.</dc:description>

         <title>C4&#8242; &#8209;Fluorinated Oligodeoxynucleotides: Synthesis, Stability, Structural Studies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fluoro&#8208;substitution on the ribose moiety (e.g., 2&#8242;&#8208;F&#8208;deoxyribonucleotide) represents a popular way to modulate the ribose conformation and, hence, the structure and function of nucleic acids. In the present study, we synthesized 4&#8242;&#8208;F&#8208;deoxythymidine (  4&#8242;&#8208;F  T) and introduced it to oligodeoxyribonucleotides (ODNs). Though scission of the glycosylic bond of  4&#8242;&#8208;F  T followed by strand cleavage occurred to some extent under alkaline conditions, the  4&#8242;&#8208;F  T&#8208;modified ODNs were rather stable in neutral buffers. NMR studies showed that like 2&#8242;&#8208;F&#8208;deoxyribonucleoside,  4&#8242;&#8208;F  T exists predominantly in the North conformation not only in the nucleoside form but also in the context of ODN strands. Circular dichroism spectroscopy, thermal denaturing and RNase H1 footprinting studies of  4&#8242;&#8208;F  T&#8208;modified ODN/cDNA and ODN/cRNA duplexes indicated that the North conformation tendency of  4&#8242;&#8208;F  T is maintained in the duplexes, leading to a local structural perturbation. Collectively, 4&#8242;&#8208;F&#8208;deoxyribonucleotide structurally resembles the 2&#8242;&#8208;F&#8208;deoxyribonucleotide but imparts less structural perturbation to the duplex than the latter.</dc:description>

         <title>Tuning the intrinsic activity and electrochemical surface area of MoS2 via tiny Zn doping: toward an efficient HER catalyst</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Molybdenum sulfide (MoS  2  ) is considered as an alternative material for commercial platinum catalysts for electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Improving the apparent HER activity of MoS  2  to a level comparable to that of Pt is an essential premise for the commercial use of MoS  2  . In this work, a Zn&#8208;doping strategy is proposed to enhance the HER performance of MoS  2  . We prove that tiny Zn doping into MoS  2  leads to the enhancement of the electrochemical surface area, increases in proportion of HER active 1T phase in the material and formation of catalytic sites of higher intrinsic activity. These benefits result in a high&#8208;performance HER electrocatalyst with a low overpotential of 190 mV(@10 mA cm  &#8208;2  ) and a low Tafel slope of 58 mV dec  &#8208;1  . The origin for the excellent electrochemical performance of the doped MoS  2  is rationalized with both experimental and theoretical investigations.</dc:description>

         <title>Prolonging the Triplet State Lifetimes of Rhenium Complexes with Imidazole&#8208;pyridine Framework for Efficient CO2 Photoreduction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The photocatalytic reduction of CO  2  into fuels offers the prospect for creating a new CO  2  economy. Harnessing visible light&#8208;driven CO  2  &#8208;to&#8208;CO reduction mediated by the long&#8208;lived triplet excited state of rhenium(I) tricarbonyl complexes is a challenging approach. We here develop a series of new mononuclear rhenium(I) tricarbonyl complexes (  Re&#8208;1  &#8722;  Re&#8208;4  ) based on the imidazole&#8208;pyridine skeleton for photo&#8208;driven CO  2  reduction. These catalysts are featured by combining pyridyl&#8208;imidazole with the aromatic ring and different pendant organic groups onto the N1 position of 1,3&#8208;imidazole unit, which display phosphorescence under Ar&#8208;saturated solution even at ambient conditions. By contrast, {Re[9&#8208;(pyren&#8208;1&#8208;yl)&#8208;10&#8208;(pyridin&#8208;2&#8208;yl)&#8208;9H&#8208;pyreno[4,5&#8208;d]imidazole)](CO)  3  Cl} (  Re&#8208;4  ) by introducing pyrene ring at the N1 position of pyrene&#8208;fused imidazole unit exhibits superior catalytic performance with a higher turnover number for CO (TON  CO  = 124) and &gt;99.9% selectivity, primarily ascribed to the strong visible light&#8208;harvesting ability, long&#8208;lived triplet lifetimes (164.2 &#181;s) and large reductive quenching constant. Moreover, the rhenium(I) tricarbonyl complexes derived from &#960;&#8208;extended pyrene chromophore exhibit a long lifetime corresponding to its ligand&#8208;localized triplet state (  3  IL) evidenced from spectroscopic investigations and DFT calculations.</dc:description>

         <title>Giant Shape&#8208;persistent Tetrahedral Porphyrin System: Light&#8208;induced Charge Separation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Tetraphenylmethane appended with four pyridylpyridinium units works as a scaffold to self&#8208;assemble four ruthenium porphyrins in a tetrahedral shape&#8208;persistent giant architecture. The resulting supramolecular structure has been characterised in the solid state by X&#8208;ray single crystal analysis and in solution by various techniques. Multinuclear NMR spectroscopy confirms the 1:4 stoichiometry with the formation of a highly symmetric structure. The self&#8208;assembly process can be monitored by changes of the redox potentials, as well as by modifications in the visible absorption spectrum of the ruthenium porphyrin and by a complete quenching of both the bright fluorescence of the tetracationic scaffold and the weak phosphorescence of the ruthenium porphyrin. An ultrafast photoinduced electron transfer is responsible for this quenching process. The lifetime of the resulting charge separated state (800 ps) is about four times longer in the giant supramolecular structure compared to the model 1:1 complex formed by the ruthenium porphyrin and a single pyridylpyridinium unit. Electron delocalization over the tetrameric pyridinium structure is likely to be responsible for this effect.</dc:description>

         <title>A Cyclometalated NHC Iridium Complex Bearing a Cationic (&#951;5&#8208;Cyclopentadienyl)(&#951;6&#8208;phenyl)iron Backbone</title>

         <dc:description>Nucleophilic substitution of [(&#951;  5  &#8208;cyclopentadienyl)(&#951;  6  &#8208;chlo&#173;robenzene)iron(II)] hexafluorophosphate with sodium imidazolate resulted in the formation of [(&#951;  5  &#8208;cyclopentadienyl)(&#951;  6  &#8208;phenyl)iron(II)]&#173;imidazole hexafluorophosphate. The corresponding dicationic imidazolium salt, which was obtained by treating this imidazole precursor with methyl iodide, underwent cyclometallation with bis[dichlorido(&#951;  5  &#8208;1,2,3,4,5&#8208;pentamethylcyclopentadienyl]iridium(III) in the presence of triethyl amine. The resulting bimetallic iridium(III) complex is the first example of a NHC complex bearing a cationic and cyclometallated [(&#951;  5  &#8208;cyclopentadienyl)(&#951;  6  &#8208;phenyl)iron(II)]  +  substituent. As its iron(II) precursors, the bimetallic iridium(III) complex was fully characterized by means of spectroscopy, elemental analysis and single crystal x&#8208;ray diffraction. In addition, it was investigated in a catalytic study, wherein it showed high activity in transfer hydrogenation compared to its neutral analogue having a simple phenyl instead of a cationic [(&#951;  5  &#8208;cyclopentadienyl)(&#951;  6  &#8208;phenyl)iron(II)]  +  unit at the NHC ligand.</dc:description>

The corresponding dicationic imidazolium salt, which was obtained by treating this imidazole precursor with methyl iodide, underwent cyclometallation with bis[dichlorido(&#951;  5  -1,2,3,4,5-pentamethylcyclopentadienyl]iridium(III) in the presence of triethyl amine. The resulting bimetallic iridium(III) complex is the first example of a NHC complex bearing a cationic and cyclometallated [(&#951;  5  -cyclopentadienyl)(&#951;  6  -phenyl)iron(II)]  +  substituent. As its iron(II) precursors, the bimetallic iridium(III) complex was fully characterized by means of spectroscopy, elemental analysis and single crystal x-ray diffraction. In addition, it was investigated in a catalytic study, wherein it showed high activity in transfer hydrogenation compared to its neutral analogue having a simple phenyl instead of a cationic [(&#951;  5  -cyclopentadienyl)(&#951;  6  -phenyl)iron(II)]  +  unit at the NHC ligand.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Quenched Lewis Acidity: Studies on the Medium Dependent Fluorescence of Zinc(II) Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Three new zinc(II) coordination units  [Zn(1  &#8211;  3)]  based on planar&#8208;directing tetradentate Schiff base&#8208;like ligands  H  2  (1  &#8211;  3)  were synthesized. Their solid&#8208;state structures were investigated by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, showing the tendency to overcome the square&#8208;planar coordination sphere by axial ligation. Affinity in solution towards axial ligation has been tested by extended spectroscopic studies, both in the absorption and emission mode. The electronic spectrum of the pyridine complex  [Zn(1)(py)]  has been characterized by multiconfiguration pair&#8208;DFT to validate the results of extended TD&#8208;DFT studies. Green emission of non&#8208;emissive solutions of  [Zn(1  &#8211;  3)]  in chloroform could be switched on in the presence of potent Lewis&#8208;bases. While interpretation in terms of an equilibrium of stacked/non&#8208;fluorescent and destacked/fluorescent species is in line with precedents from literature, the sensitivity of  [Zn(1  &#8211;  3)]  was greatly reduced. Results of a computation&#8208;based structure search allow to trace the hidden Lewis acidity of  [Zn(1  &#8211;  3)]  to a new stacking motif, resulting in a strongly enhanced stability of the dimers.</dc:description>

         <title>Segregated Protein&#8208;Cucurbit[7]uril Crystalline Architectures via Modulatory Peptide Tectons</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>One approach to protein assembly involves water&#8208;soluble supramolecular receptors that act like glue. Bionano&#8208;architectures directed by these scaffolds are often system&#8208;specific with few studies investigating their customization. Here, we describe the modulation of cucurbituril&#8208;mediated protein assemblies via the inclusion of peptide tectons. Three peptides of varying length and structural order were N&#8208;terminally appended to RSL, a &#946;&#8208;propeller building block. Each fusion protein was incorporated into crystalline architectures mediated by cucurbit[7]uril (Q7). A trimeric coiled coil served as a spacer within a  Q7 &#8208;directed sheet assembly of RSL, giving rise to a layered material of varying porosity. Within the spacer layers, the coiled coils were dynamic. This result prompted consideration of intrinsically disordered peptides (IDPs) as modulatory tectons. Similar to the coiled coil, a mussel adhesion peptide (Mefp) also acted as a spacer between protein&#8208;Q7  sheets. In contrast, the fusion of a nucleoporin peptide (Nup) to RSL did not recapitulate the sheet assembly. Instead, a  Q  &#8208;directed cage was adopted, within which disordered Nup peptides were partially &#8220;captured&#8221; by  Q7  receptors. IDP capture occurred by macrocycle recognition of an intrapeptide Phe&#8208;Gly motif in which the benzyl side chain was encapsulated by  Q7. The modularity of these protein&#8208;cucurbituril architectures adds a new dimension to macrocycle&#8208;mediated protein assembly. In addition, the segregated crystals, with alternating layers of high and low porosity, provide a basis for new types of materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Effect of Arylmethylene Substitutions on Molecular Structure, Optoelectronic Properties and Photovoltaic Performance of Dithienocyclopentafluorene&#8208;Based Small&#8208;Molecule Acceptors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Here, we developed two dithienocyclopentafluorene&#8208;based SMAs (DTCFSV&#8208;IC and DTCFDV&#8208;IC) featuring methylene&#8208;functionalized conjugated side chains to study the effect of arylmethylene substitution and its number on structure, optoelectronic properties and device performance. Results showed that two SMAs have better absorption properties and planarity, lower bandgaps and higher LUMOs compared with the control SMA (DTCFO&#8208;IC) without conjugated side chains. Combined with polymer donor PBDB&#8208;T, DTCFSV&#8208;IC&#8208;based polymer solar cells (PSCs) delivered an inferior PCE but an increased Voc of 1.04 V relative to DTCFO&#8208;IC. Whereas, an enhanced PCE of 8.89% was realized for DTCFDV&#8208;IC&#8208;based PSCs due to concurrently increased Voc (1.04 V) and Jsc (15.98 mA cm&#8208;2). When PBDB&#8208;T was substituted with PBDB&#8208;TF, the DTCFDV&#8208;IC&#8208;based PSC produced a further increased Voc of 1.14 V, but a slightly reduced PCE of 8.30%. Encouragingly, for the PBDB&#8208;TF:DTCFDV&#8208;IC system, a comparably high PCE of 8.82% was achieved when o&#8208;xylene (XY) was used to replace chlorobenzene (CB) as the processing solvent. The superior device performance of PSCs based on PBDB&#8208;T:DTCFDV&#8208;IC (CB) and PBDB&#8208;TF:DTCFDV&#8208;IC (XY) could be ascribed to higher and more balanced carrier mobility, more efficiently charge transfer, weaker bimolecular recombination, and better active layer morphology and miscibility. This work argues that the introduction of methylene&#8208;functionalized conjugated side chains has great potential in tuning molecular structure, optoelectronic properties, device&#160;physics and photovoltaic performance of SMAs.</dc:description>

         <title>Intermetallic Compounds: Liquid&#8208;Phase Synthesis and Electrocatalytic Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Characterized by long&#8208;range atomic ordering, well&#8208;defined stoichiometry, and controlled crystal structure, intermetallics have attracted increasing attention in the area of chemical synthesis and catalytic applications. Liquid&#8208;phase synthesis of intermetallics has arisen as the promising methodology due to its precise control over size, shape, and resistance toward sintering compared with the traditional metallurgy. This short review tends to provide perspectives on the liquid&#8208;phase synthesis of intermetallics in terms of both thermodynamics and methodology, as well as its applications in various catalytic reactions. Specifically, basic thermodynamics and kinetics in the synthesis of intermetallics will be first discussed, followed by discussing the main factors that will affect the formation of intermetallics during synthesis. The application of intermetallics in electrocatalysis will be demonstrated case by case at last. We conclude the review with perspectives on the future developments with respect to both synthesis and catalytic applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Breathing Assisted Selective Adsorption of C8 Alkyl Aromatics in Zn&#8208;based Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The breathing phenomenon in metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) has revealed supramolecular host&#8208;guest interactions, which could be beneficial for chemical separation in numerous industrial applications. The cost&#8208;effective purification of C  8  alkyl aromatics such as o&#8208;xylene, p&#8208;xylene, m&#8208;xylene, and ethylbenzene still remains challenging owing to their similar molecular structures, boiling points, kinetic diameters, polarities, etc. Herein, we report two Zn&#8208;based pillar&#8208;bilayered MOFs, denoted as [Zn  2  (aip)  2  (pillar)]; aip = 5&#8208;aminoisophthalic acid; pillar: bpy = 4,4&#8217;&#8208;bipyridine or bpe = 1,2&#8208;bis(4&#8208;pyridyl)ethane, which exhibit a breathing effect depending on the adsorbed guest molecules. Guest&#8208;dependent sorption studies using organic solvents such as  N  ,  N  &#8208;dimethylformamide, methanol,&#160; benzene, and water vapor displays reversible structural flexibility through breathing effect in both framework compounds. Motivated by these sorption studies, the conducted experiments on C  8&#8208;alkyl aromatics resulting in both MOF compounds can access these isomers in the shrunken pores and, thereby expand the pore size by framework breathing. In C  8  binary mixtures, these Zn&#8208;MOFs exhibit selective sorption properties based on the different interactions between guest C  8  aromatics interactions and framework structure.</dc:description>

         <title>A Novel Strategy to Design and Construct AIE&#8208;active Mechanofluorochromic Materials via Regulation of Molecular Structure</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this work, we first designed and synthesized tetraphenylene&#8208;fused aryl&#8208;imidazole derivatives  TM&#8208;1~4  via regulation of molecular structure,which were consisted of 1H&#8208;imidazo[4,5&#8208;f][1,10]phenanthroline, 1H&#8208;phenanthro[9,10&#8208;d]imidazole, 4,5&#8208;diphenyl&#8208;1H&#8208;imidazole, 3,3'&#8208;(1H&#8208;imidazole&#8208;4,5&#8208;diyl)dipyridine moieties and AIE&#8208;active tetraphenylethene units, respectively. The results illustrated that  TM&#8208;1~4  exhibited obvious AIE characteristics. Meanwhile,  TM&#8208;2  and  TM&#8208;3  show excellent solid emission properties (&#934;  TM&#8208;2  =13.73% and &#934;  TM&#8208;3  =36.21%), whereas  TM&#8208;1  and  TM&#8208;4  exhibit the opposite properties (&#934;  TM&#8208;1  =1.48% and &#934;  TM&#8208;4  =4.83%). The multiple rotors (pyridine and benzene ring) causes twisted conformations of the molecule that prevents &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking and enhances solid emission(&#934;  TM&#8208;2  &lt;&#934;  TM&#8208;3  , &#934;  TM&#8208;1  &lt;&#934;  TM&#8208;4  ). Significantly,  TM&#8208;2  and  TM&#8208;3  also exhibited reversible mechanochromic behavior (Emission red shifts: &#916;&#955;  TM&#8208;2  =43 nm and &#916;&#955;  TM&#8208;3  =41 nm) with color changes between blue and green emissions. The powder X&#8208;ray diffraction (PXRD) suggested the disordered state of ground sample could be readily returned to an ordered crystalline. Therefore, the mechanochromisms of  TM&#8208;2  and  TM&#8208;3  are ascribable to the phase transformation between crystal and amorphous structure. The single crystal X&#8208;ray analysis of  TM&#8208;2  reveals a twisted conformation for  TPE  moiety and the absence of &#960;&#8208;&#960; intermolecular stacking. These excellent optical properties of  TM&#8208;2  and  TM&#8208;3  make them potentially applications in mechanochromic materials and imaging agents.</dc:description>

         <title>Structure and Functional Differences of Cysteine and 3&#8208;Mercaptopropionate Dioxygenases: A Computational Study</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Spheres of influence: Although cysteine and 3&#8208;mercaptopropionate dioxygenase bind and react similar substrates, there are key differences in the first&#8208; and second&#8208;coordination spheres that affect their catalytic reaction mechanism and reactivity, as highlighted by density functional theory studies on large enzyme clusters.







Abstract
Thiol dioxygenases are important enzymes for human health; they are involved in the detoxification and catabolism of toxic thiol&#8208;containing natural products such as cysteine. As such, these enzymes have relevance to the development of Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases in the brain. Recent crystal structure coordinates of cysteine and 3&#8208;mercaptopropionate dioxygenase (CDO and MDO) showed major differences in the second&#8208;coordination spheres of the two enzymes. To understand the difference in activity between these two analogous enzymes, we created large, active&#8208;site cluster models. We show that CDO and MDO have different iron(III)&#8208;superoxo&#8208;bound structures due to differences in ligand coordination. Furthermore, our studies show that the differences in the second&#8208;coordination sphere and particularly the position of a positively charged Arg residue results in changes in substrate positioning, mobility and enzymatic turnover. Furthermore, the substrate scope of MDO is explored with cysteinate and 2&#8208;mercaptosuccinic acid and their reactivity is predicted.

         <title>Photocatalyzed E&#8594;Z Contra&#8208;thermodynamic Isomerization of Vinyl Boronates with Binaphthol</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Going against the grain: Photocatalytic, contra&#8208;thermodynamic E&#8594;Z isomerization of vinyl boronates by using a binaphthol catalyst is described. The reaction permits the geometrical isomerization in good&#8208;to&#8208;excellent Z/E ratio and excellent&#8208;to&#8208;quantitative yields. The reaction manifold was also studied.







Abstract
The photocatalytic contra&#8208;thermodynamic E&#8594;Z isomerization of vinyl boronates by using a binaphthol catalyst is disclosed. The reaction, based on the transient formation of a suitable chromophore with a BINOL derivative as the catalyst, allowed geometrical isomerization in good&#8208;to&#8208;excellent Z/E ratio and excellent&#8208;to&#8208;quantitative yields. The mechanism of this E&#8594;Z contra&#8208;thermodynamic isomerization was studied, and the formation of a transient chromophore species is suggested.

         <title>Ternary Conductance Switching Realized by a Pillar[5]arene&#8208;Functionalized Two&#8208;Dimensional Imine Polymer Film</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Improving your memory: Combining the intrinsic sub&#8208;nanometer pore of pillar[5]arene with the nanometer pore structure of two&#8208;dimensional polymers provides a multichannel for Ag+ migration so that a ternary&#8208;state memristor based on the conductive filament mechanism could be designed. The obtained Ag/2DPTPAZ+TAPB/ITO devices show excellent ternary memory performance, including low threshold voltage, steady retention time, clearly distinguishable resistance states, high ON/OFF ratio, considerable ternary yield, and good thermal stability and flexibility.







Abstract
Nowadays, most manufacturing memory devices are based on materials with electrical bistability (i.&#8201;e., &#8220;0&#8221; and &#8220;1&#8221;) in response to an applied electric field. Memory devices with multilevel states are highly desired so as to produce high&#8208;density and efficient memory devices. Herein, we report the first multichannel strategy to realize a ternary&#8208;state memristor. We make use of the intrinsic sub&#8208;nanometer channel of pillar[5]arene and nanometer channel of a two&#8208;dimensional imine polymer to construct an active layer with multilevel channels for ternary memory devices. Low threshold voltage, long retention time, clearly distinguishable resistance states, high ON/OFF ratio (OFF/ON1/ON2=1&#8201;:&#8201;10&#8201;:&#8201;103), and high ternary yield (75&#8201;%) were obtained. In addition, the flexible memory device based on 2DPTPAZ+TAPB can maintain its stable ternary memory performance after being bent 500 times. The device also exhibits excellent thermal stability and can tolerate a temperature as high as 300&#8201;&#176;C. It is envisioned that the results of this work will open up possibilities for multistate, flexible resistive memories with good thermal stability and low energy consumption, and broaden the application of pillar[n]arene.

         <title>Combined Chemical Modification and Collision Induced Unfolding Using Native Ion Mobility&#8208;Mass Spectrometry Provides Insights into Protein Gas&#8208;Phase Structure</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Native mass spectrometry is now widely used in protein structural studies. We present a methodology for probing the importance of specific residues in the stabilization of compact protein structure in the gas&#8208;phase using a combination of chemical modification and collision induced unfolding ion mobility&#8208;mass spectrometry.







Abstract
Native mass spectrometry is now an important tool in structural biology. Thus, the nature of higher protein structure in the vacuum of the mass spectrometer is an area of significant interest. One of the major goals in the study of gas&#8208;phase protein structure is to elucidate the stabilising role of interactions at the level of individual amino acid residues. A strategy combining protein chemical modification together with collision induced unfolding (CIU) was developed and employed to probe the structure of compact protein ions produced by native electrospray ionisation. Tractable chemical modification was used to alter the properties of amino acid residues, and ion mobility&#8208;mass spectrometry (IM&#8208;MS) utilised to monitor the extent of unfolding as a function of modification. From these data the importance of specific intramolecular interactions for the stability of compact gas&#8208;phase protein structure can be inferred. Using this approach, and aided by molecular dynamics simulations, an important stabilising interaction between K6 and H68 in the protein ubiquitin was identified, as was a contact between the N&#8208;terminus and E22 in a ubiquitin binding protein UBA2.

Using this approach, and aided by molecular dynamics simulations, an important stabilising interaction between K6 and H68 in the protein ubiquitin was identified, as was a contact between the N-terminus and E22 in a ubiquitin binding protein UBA2.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Facile Preparation of CuCo2S4/Cu7.2S4 Nanocomposites as High&#8208;Performance Cathode Materials for Rechargeable Magnesium Batteries**
</title>

Moving one step further beyond lithium? A nanosized CuCo2S4/Cu7.2S4 material has been synthesized by a facile solvothermal method. Its excellent rate performance, outstanding cycling stability and pseudocapacitive energy storage properties give it promise for use as an efficient cathode material for rechargeable magnesium batteries.







Abstract
Rechargeable magnesium batteries (RMBs) have been considered a promising energy&#8208;storage device due to their high energy density and high safety, but they still suffer from a lack of high&#8208;rate performance and cycle performance of the cathode. Nanosized CuCo2S4/Cu7.2S4 composites have been synthesized for the first time by a facile solvothermal method. Herein, the magnesium ion storage behavior when applied in the cathode for RMBs is discussed. Electrochemical results demonstrated that the CuCo2S4/Cu7.2S4 composites exhibit a high initial discharge capacity of 256&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1 and 123&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 300&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1 at room temperature and an outstanding long&#8208;term cyclic stability over 300&#8197;cycles at 300&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1. Furthermore, the electrochemical storage mechanism demonstrated that the storage process of magnesium ion in the CuCo2S4/Cu7.2S4 cathode is mainly driven by strong pseudocapacitive effects.

         <title>Size&#8208;Controlled Hapticity Switching in [Ln(C9H9)(C8H8)] Sandwiches</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of trivalent lanthanide heteroleptic sandwich complexes with the cyclooctatetraenyl (Cot) and cyclononatetraenyl (Cnt) ligands shows a significant bending of the Cnt ligand when the size of the ion decreases, implying a size&#8208;controlled hapticity switch.







Abstract
Sandwich complexes of lanthanides have recently attracted a considerable amount of interest due to their applications as Single Molecule Magnet (SMM). Herein, a comprehensive series of heteroleptic lanthanide sandwich complexes ligated by the cyclononatetraenyl (Cnt) and the cyclooctatetraenyl (Cot) ligand [Ln(Cot)(Cnt)] (Ln=Tb, Dy, Er, Ho, Yb, and Lu) is reported. The coordination behavior of the Cnt ligand has been investigated along the series and shows different coordination patterns in the solid&#8208;state depending on the size of the corresponding lanthanide ion without altering its overall anisotropy. Besides the characterization in the solid state by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and in solution by 1H NMR, static magnetic studies and ab initio computational studies were performed.

         <title>Achieving High Efficiency at High Luminance in Fluorescent Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes through Triplet&#8211;Triplet Fusion Based on Phenanthroimidazole&#8208;Benzothiadiazole Derivatives</title>

On a high: A series of phenanthroimidazole&#8208;benzothiadiazole&#8208;based fluorescent donor&#8211;acceptor molecules were designed and synthesized. They exhibited emissions ranging from green to red with high photoluminescence quantum yield in the solid state. These molecules also showed highly efficient electroluminescence at high luminance enabled by triplet&#8211;triplet fusion.







Abstract
Achieving high efficiency at high luminance is one of the most important prerequisites towards practical application of any kind of light&#8208;emitting diode (LED). Herein, we report highly emissive organic fluorescent molecules based on phenanthroimidazole&#8208;benzothiadiazole derivatives capable of maintaining high external quantum efficiency (EQE) at high luminance enabled by triplet&#8211;triplet fusion (TTF) in doped organic LEDs. The PIBzP&#8208;, PIBzPCN&#8208;, and PIBzTPA&#8208;based devices showed EQEs of 8.27, 9.15, and 8.64&#8201;%, respectively, at luminance of higher than 1000&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2, with little efficiency roll&#8208;off.

         <title>Determining the Diastereoselectivity of the Formation of Dipeptidonucleotides by NMR Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The diastereoselectivity of the peptide coupling between aminoacidylnucleotides and amino acid esters in aqueous condensation buffer was determined by NMR spectroscopy. Homochiral dipeptides were found as the preferred products.







Abstract
Proteins are composed of l&#8208;amino acids, but nucleic acids and most oligosaccharides contain d&#8208;sugars as building blocks. It is interesting to ask whether this is a coincidence or a consequence of the functional interplay of these biomolecules. One reaction that provides an opportunity to study this interplay is the formation of phosphoramidate&#8208;linked peptido RNA from amino acids and ribonucleotides in aqueous condensation buffer. Here we report how the diastereoselectivity of the first peptide coupling of the peptido RNA pathway can be determined in&#8197;situ by NMR spectroscopy. When a racemic mixture of an amino acid ester was allowed to react with an 5&#8242;&#8208;aminoacidyl nucleotide, diastereomeric ratios of up to 72&#8201;:&#8201;28 of the resulting dipeptido nucleotides were found by integration of 31P&#8208; or 1H&#8208;NMR peaks. The highest diastereomeric excess was found for the homochiral coupling product d&#8208;Ser&#8208;d&#8208;Trp, phosphoramidate&#8208;linked to adenosine 5&#8242;&#8208;monophosphate with its d&#8208;ribose ring. When control reactions with an N&#8208;acetyl amino acid and valine methyl ester were run in organic solvent, the diastereoselectivity was found to be lower, with diastereomeric ratios&#8804;62&#8201;:&#8201;38. The results from the exploratory study thus indicate that the ribonucleotide residue not only facilitates the coupling of lipophilic amino acids in aqueous medium but also the formation of a homochiral dipeptide. The methodology described here may be used to search for other stereoselective reactions that shed light on the origin of homochirality.

         <title>Construction of Coplanar Bicyclic Backbones for 1,2,4&#8208;Triazole&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;Oxadiazole&#8208;Derived Energetic Materials</title>

An attractive precursor 3&#8208;(5&#8208;amino&#8208;1H&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;triazol&#8208;3&#8208;yl)&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;oxadiazol&#8208;5&#8208;amine (5) with coplanar bicyclic backbone was synthesized. Two nitrated products of 5 were prepared, and a series of nitrogen&#8208;rich energetic salts were obtained and systematically characterized. These 1,2,4&#8208;triazole&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;oxadiazole&#8208;derived energetic materials exhibited high combined nitrogen and oxygen content and outstanding enthalpies of formation along with good detonation performance and an acceptable safety profile. Among them, N&#8208;(5&#8208;(5&#8208;(nitramino)&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;oxadiazol&#8208;3&#8208;yl)&#8208;3H&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;triazol&#8208;3&#8208;yl)nitramide and its dihydroxylammonium salt were screened as the most balanced energetic materials.







Abstract
Combining different nitrogen&#8208;rich heterocycles into a molecule can fine&#8208;tune its energetic performance and physical properties as well as its safety for use in energetic materials. Here, 1,2,4&#8208;oxadiazole was incorporated into 1,2,4&#8208;triazole to construct new energetic backbones. 3&#8208;(5&#8208;Amino&#8208;1H&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;triazol&#8208;3&#8208;yl)&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;oxadiazol&#8208;5&#8208;amine (5) was designed and synthesized. Nitramino&#8208;functionalized N&#8208;(5&#8208;(5&#8208;amino&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;oxadiazol&#8208;3&#8208;yl)&#8208;3H&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;triazol&#8208;3&#8208;yl)nitramide (6) and N&#8208;(5&#8208;(5&#8208;(nitramino)&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;oxadiazol&#8208;3&#8208;yl)&#8208;3H&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;triazol&#8208;3&#8208;yl)nitramide (7) were also obtained, and two series of corresponding nitrogen&#8208;rich salts were prepared, leading to the creation of new energetic compounds. All derivatives were fully characterized, and five of them were further confirmed by X&#8208;ray diffraction. The theoretical calculations, energetic performance, safety, and the main decomposition gaseous products of 1,2,4&#8208;triazole&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;oxadiazole&#8208;derived energetic materials were studied. Compound 7 and its dihydroxylammonium salt (7&#8201;c) exhibited prominent detonation performance comparable to that of RDX while possessing satisfying thermal stabilities and mechanical sensitivities.

         <title>Stepwise Stress&#8208;Induced Transformations of Metal&#8208;Organic Polyhedral Cluster&#8208;Based Assemblies: Where Conformational and Supramolecular Features Meet</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Squeezed to change: We demonstrate that a predesigned polyhedral oxo&#8208;centered metal complex with remote phenyl rings can undergo reversible pressure&#8208;induced conformational transformations of the secondary coordination sphere and simultaneous stepwise (initially every second polyhedral molecule undergoes the conformational transformations) and reversible transitions from an ambient phase &#945; to high&#8208;pressure phases &#946; and &#947;, as single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal events.







Abstract
Understanding the factors governing the formation of supramolecular structures and phase transitions between various forms of molecular crystals is pivotal for developing dynamic, stimuli&#8208;responsive materials and polymorph&#8208;controlled syntheses. Here, we investigate the pressure&#8208;induced dynamic of both the intrinsic molecular structure and the supramolecular network of a predesigned polyhedral oxo&#8208;centered zinc cluster incorporating monoanionic N,N&#8217;&#8208;diphenylformamidinate and featuring N&#8208;bonded phenyl groups in close proximity to the primary coordination sphere. We demonstrate that the model oxo cluster is prone to undergoing pressure&#8208;induced conformational transformations of the secondary coordination sphere and simultaneous stepwise (initially every second polyhedral molecule undergoes the conformational transformations) and reversible transitions from an ambient phase &#945; to high&#8208;pressure phases &#946; and &#947;, as single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal events. The observed phase transitions illustrate the key role of an interplay between the low&#8208;energy conformation perturbations and cooperative intra&#8208; and intermolecular noncovalent interactions.

         <title>Tetrakis(pentafluoroethyl)gallate, [Ga(C2F5)4]&#8722;, Ionic Liquids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
New imidazolium&#8208;based tunable aryl alkyl ionic liquids (TAAILs) containing the weakly coordinating anion [Ga(C2F5)4]&#8722; are reported. Some phenyl derivatives in combination with different alkyl chains were investigated with regard to their viscosity, conductivity and electrochemical window. In contrast to gallates with standard cations (EMIM, BMIM) the gallate&#8208;TAAILs are stable even up to high electrochemical potentials. Thus, they are promising candidates as electrolytes in electrochemical applications. More information can be found in the Communication by B. Hoge, T. Strassner, et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202102097).

         <title>In&#8208;Fjord Substitution in Expanded Helicenes: Effects of the Insert on the Inversion Barrier and Helical Pitch</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Like the arms of a dancer, which are waved following the rhythm of the music but avoid colliding with her head or her body; the flexible arms of expanded helicenes find different pathways to reverse their position depending on the size and nature of the insert placed in the innermost zone of their fjord. This work presents the synthesis of a series of in&#8208;fjord substituted expanded helicenes and an estimation of their inversion barriers through state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art quantum calculations. Interestingly, the energetic profile of the inversions is intensively affected by the interplay of steric and attractive London dispersion interactions.

         <title>Double&#8208;Shelled Hollow SiO2@N&#8208;C Nanofiber Boosts the Lithium Storage Performance of [PMo12O40]3&#8722;</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Excellent lithium storage is achieved by the double&#8208;shelled hollow PMo12&#8208;SiO2@N&#8208;C anode material. The outermost N&#8208;C shell can improve the electronic conductivity and promote the dispersion of PMo12 clusters. The SiO2 inner shell can efficiently avoid the loss of active components. The hollow structure can buffer the volume expansion and accelerate Li+ diffusion during lithiation/delithiation process. More information can be found in the Full Paper by L. He, W. Chen, Y.&#8208;F. Song et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202101638).

Breaking &#8216;hard&#8208;to&#8208;kill&#8217; bone cancer cells with gallium: Osteosarcoma stem cells (OSCs) are linked to the poor prognosis of metastasised osteosarcoma. Here a gallium(III)&#8208;polypyridyl complex is reported, containing the non&#8208;steroidal anti&#8208;inflammatory drug, diflunisal, capable of killing OSCs more effectively than frontline and secondary anti&#8208;osteosarcoma drugs. The complex evokes cell death by inhibiting cyclooxygenase&#8208;2 and damaging nuclear DNA.







Abstract
We report the anti&#8208;osteosarcoma stem cell (OSC) properties of a series of gallium(III)&#8208;polypyridyl complexes (5&#8208;7) containing diflunisal, a non&#8208;steroidal anti&#8208;inflammatory drug. The most effective complex within the series, 6 (containing 3,4,7,8&#8208;tetramethyl&#8208;1,10&#8208;phenanthroline), displayed similar potency towards bulk osteosarcoma cells and OSCs, in the nanomolar range. Remarkably, 6 exhibited significantly higher monolayer and sarcosphere OSC potency (up to three orders of magnitude) than clinically approved drugs used in frontline (cisplatin and doxorubicin) and secondary (etoposide, ifosfamide, and carboplatin) osteosarcoma treatments. Mechanistic studies show that 6 downregulates cyclooxygenase&#8208;2 (COX&#8208;2) and kills osteosarcoma cells in a COX&#8208;2 dependent manner. Furthermore, 6 induces genomic DNA damage and caspase&#8208;dependent apoptosis. To the best of our knowledge, 6 is the first metal complex to kill osteosarcoma cells by simultaneously inhibiting COX&#8208;2 and damaging nuclear DNA.
