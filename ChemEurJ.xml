         <title>Carbon Dots for Carbon Dummies: The Quantum and The Molecular Questions Among Some Others</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Carbon Dots (CDs) are carbon nanoparticles which were discovered in 2004. Despite two decades of intensive work from the scientific community and a colossal amount of gathered experimental data, no definitive consensus exists to date on several key aspects such as the actual definition of CDs and the origin of their emissive properties. This review proposes a critical evaluation of these fundamental questions. Lay persons will also find here an alternative introduction to the CDs domain, including synthetic strategies, photophysical properties, as well as challenges and outlook of this exciting new area.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis and Characterization of A Stable Extra&#8208;Large&#8208;Pore Zeolite with 15&#215;12&#215;12 Member&#8208;Ring Channels</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Extra&#8208;large&#8208;pore zeolites have great application potential in various industrial fields, such as oil refinery, fine chemicals and biomass processing. Herein, we report the synthesis of an extra&#8208;large&#8208;pore germanosilicate zeolite (named NUD&#8208;13) by using an easily obtained aromatic organic cation 1,2&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;3&#8208;propyl&#8208;benzimidazolium as organic structure&#8208;directing agents.&#160;NUD&#8208;13 possesses a rare 15&#8208;member ring extra&#8208;large&#8208;pore channel intersecting with two elliptical 12&#8208;member ring channels, which is isostructural to germanosilicate zeolite GeZA synthesized by using triphenylsulfonium. The germanium in NUD&#8208;13 can be partially substituted by acid treatment to obtain stable high silica zeolite. In addition, aluminium is added into the framework of NUD&#8208;13 during the post&#8208;synthesis treatment process, which provides a foundation for catalytic application.</dc:description>

         <title>A Highly Water&#8208; and Air&#8208;Stable Iron&#8208;Containing MRI Contrast Agent Sensor for H2O2</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A highly water&#8208; and air&#8208;stable Fe(II) complex with the quinol&#8208;containing macrocyclic ligand H  4  qp4 reacts with H  2  O  2  to yield Fe(III) complexes with less highly chelating forms of the ligand that have either one or two  para  &#8208;quinones. The reaction increases the  T  1  &#8208;weighted relaxivity over four&#8208;fold, enabling the complex to detect H  2  O  2  using clinical MRI technology. The iron&#8208;containing sensor differs from its recently characterized manganese analog, which also detects H  2  O  2  , in that it is the oxidation of the metal center, rather than the ligand, that primarily enhances the relaxivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Synergistic strategies in Aminocatalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Synergistic catalysis offers the unique possibility of simultaneous activations of both the nucleophile and the electrophile in a reaction. A requirement for this strategy is the stability of the active species towards the reaction conditions and the two concerted catalytic cycles. Since the beginning of the century, aminocatalysis has been established as a platform for the stereoselective activation of carbonyl compounds  via  HOMO&#8208;raising or LUMO&#8208;lowering. The burgeoning era of aminocatalysis has been driven by the deep understanding of these activation and stereoinduction modes, thanks to the introduction of versatile and privileged chiral amines. The aim of the present review is to cover the recent developments of synergistic strategies involving aminocatalysis in combination with organo&#8208;, metal&#8208;, photo&#8208;, and electro&#8208;catalysis, focusing on the evolution of privileged aminocatalysts architectures.</dc:description>

         <title>Two rhodium(III) ions confined in a [18]porphyrin frame &#8211; 5,10,15,20&#8208;tetraaryl&#8208;21,23&#8208;dirhodaporphyrin</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Tetraaryl&#8208;21,23&#8208;dirhodaporphyrin and a series of related monorhodaporphyrins have been obtained via a tellurium&#8208;to&#8208;rhodium exchange in a reaction of tetraaryl&#8208;21,23&#8208;ditelluraporphyrin with [RhCl(CO)  2  ]  2  . These organometallic metallaporphyrins contain rhodium(III) centers embedded in rhodacyclopentadiene rings, incorporated within the porphyrin frames. The skeletons of 21,23&#8208;dirhodaporphyrin and 21&#8208;rhoda&#8208;23&#8208;telluraporphyrin are strongly in&#8208;plane deformed from the rectangular shape typical for porphyrins, due to rhodium(III) coordination preferences, the large size of two core atoms, and the porphyrin skeleton constrains. These two metallaporphyrins exhibit fluxional behavior, studied by  1  H NMR and DFT, involving the in&#8208;plane motion and the switch of the rhodium center(s) between two nitrogen donors. A side&#8208;product detected in the reaction mixture, 21&#8208;oxa&#8208;23&#8208;rhodaporphyrin, results from tellurium&#8208;to&#8208;oxygen exchange, occurring parallelly to the tellurium&#8208;to&#8208;rhodium exchange. The reaction paths and mechanisms are analysed. The title 21,23&#8208;dirhodaporphyrin contains a bridged bimetallic unit, Rh  2  Cl  2  , in the center of the macrocycle, with two rhodium(III) ions, lying approximately in&#8208;plane of the porphyrinoid skeleton. The geometry of the implanted Rh  2  Cl  2  unit is affected by macrocyclic constrains.</dc:description>

         <title>Structural and ITC Characterization of Peptide&#8208;Protein Binding: Thermodynamic Consequences of Cyclization Constraints, a Case Study on Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Macrocyclization constraints are widely used in the design of protein ligands to stabilize their bioactive conformation and increase their affinities. However, the resulting changes in binding entropy can be puzzling and uncorrelated to affinity gains. Here we report the thermodynamic (Isothermal Titration Calorimetry) and structural (X&#8208;ray, NMR and CD) analysis of a complete series of lactam&#8208;bridged peptide ligands of the vascular endothelial growth factor, and their unconstrained analogs. We show that differences in thermodynamics arise mainly from the folding energy of the peptide upon binding. The systematic reduction in conformational entropy penalty due to helix pre&#8208;organization can be counterbalanced by an unfavorable vibrational entropy change if the constraints are too rigid. The gain in configurational entropy partially escapes the enthalpy/entropy compensation and leads to an improvement in affinity. The precision of the analytical ITC method makes this study a possible benchmark for constrained peptides optimization.</dc:description>

         <title>Infrared spectroscopy elucidates the inhibitor binding sites in a metal&#8208;dependent formate dehydrogenase</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Biological carbon dioxide (CO  2  ) reduction is an important step by which organisms form valuable energy&#8208;richer molecules required for further metabolic processes. The Mo&#8208;dependent formate dehydrogenase (FDH) from  Rhodobacter capsulatus  catalyzes reversible formate oxidation to CO  2  at a bis&#8208;molybdopterin guanine dinucleotide (bis&#8208;MGD) cofactor. To elucidate potential substrate binding sites we studied herein the interaction with the inhibitory molecules azide and cyanate, which are isoelectronic to CO  2  and charged as formate. We employed infrared (IR) spectroscopy in combination with density functional theory (DFT) and inhibition kinetics. One distinct inhibitory molecule was found to bind to either a non&#8208;competitive or a competitive binding site in the secondary coordination sphere of the active site. Site&#8208;directed mutagenesis of key amino acid residues in the vicinity of the bis&#8208;MGD cofactor revealed changes in both non&#8208;competitive and competitive binding. The absence of the cofactor and the adjacent Arg587 hampers exclusively the competitive interaction.</dc:description>

         <title>A General Electro&#8208;Synthesis Approach to Amaryllidaceae Alkaloids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Amaryllidaceae alkaloids appeal to organic chemists with their attractive structures and their impressive antitumor and acetylcholinesterase inhibitory properties. We demonstrate a highly versatile access to this family of natural products. A general protocol with high yields in a sustainable electro&#8208;organic key transformation on a metal&#8208;free anode to spirodienones facilitates functionalization to the alkaloids. The biomimetic syntheses start with the readily available, inexpensive biogenic starting materials methyl gallate, O&#8208;methyl tyramine, and vanillin derivatives. Through known dynamic resolutions, this technology provides access to both enantiomeric series of martidine, (epi&#8208;)crinine, siculine, and galantamine, clinically prescribed for the treatment of Alzheimer&#8217;s disease.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We use an on&#8208;surface synthesis approach to drive the homocoupling reaction of a simple dithiophenyl&#8208;functionalized precursor on Cu(111). The C&#8208;S activation reaction is initiated at low annealing temperature and yields unsaturated hydrocarbon chains interconnected in a fully conjugated reticulated network. High&#8208;resolution atomic force microscopy imaging reveals the opening of the thiophenyl rings and the presence of trans &#8208; and cis &#8208;oligoacetylene chains as well as pentalene units. The chemical transformations were studied by C 1s and S 2p core level photoemission spectroscopy and supported by theoretical calculations. At higher annealing temperature, additional cyclization reactions take place, leading to the formation of small graphene flakes.</dc:description>

         <title>Azobenzene&#8208;Substituted Triptycenes: Understanding the Exciton Coupling of Molecular Switches in Close Proximity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Switchable host system: Azobenzenes have been attached to a triptycene scaffold in the meta position. Isomerization experiments revealed efficient switching of azobenzene moieties together with the build&#8208;up of a cavity in the all&#8208;Z conformation of the C3v&#8208;symmetric trisazobenzene&#8208;triptycene; this makes this molecule interesting as a switchable host system. Moreover, computational studies indicated excitonic coupling resulting in different transition probabilities of &#960;&#8211;&#960;* excitations.







Abstract
Herein, we report a series of azobenzene&#8208;substituted triptycenes. In their design, these switching units were placed in close proximity, but electronically separated by a sp3 center. The azobenzene switches were prepared by Baeyer&#8211;Mills coupling as key step. The isomerization behavior was investigated by 1H NMR spectroscopy, UV/Vis spectroscopy, and HPLC. It was shown that all azobenzene moieties are efficiently switchable. Despite the geometric decoupling of the chromophores, computational studies revealed excitonic coupling effects between the individual azobenzene units depending on the connectivity pattern due to the different transition dipole moments of the &#960;&#8594;&#960;* excitations. Transition probabilities for those excitations are slightly altered, which is also revealed in their absorption spectra. These insights provide new design parameters for combining multiple photoswitches in one molecule, which have high potential as energy or information storage systems, or, among others, in molecular machines and supramolecular chemistry.

         <title>Understanding the reshaping of fluorinated polyester vitrimers by kinetic and DFT studies of the transesterification reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Vitrimers are a third class of polymers gathering the mechanical properties and solvent resistance of 3D thermosets and the reprocessability of thermoplastics. This unique behaviour is due to the triggering of certain covalent exchange reactions that allow the network to rearrange upon application of a stimulus. The constitutive feature of vitrimers is the adoption of a glass&#8208;like viscosity during the rearrangement of the network, often due to an associative mechanism for the exchange reaction. Transesterification networks are one of the most studied type of vitrimers that usually require the incorporation of a catalyst, implying the associated drawbacks. Our group recently reported catalyst&#8208;free transesterification vitrimers in which the ester functions are particularly reactive thanks to the presence of fluorine atoms in a&#8208; or b&#8208;position. In the present contribution, we present parallel DFT calculations and an experimental kinetic study on model molecules in order to quantitatively assess the effect of neighbouring fluorinated groups on the transesterification reaction rate.</dc:description>

Our group recently reported catalyst-free transesterification vitrimers in which the ester functions are particularly reactive thanks to the presence of fluorine atoms in a- or b-position. In the present contribution, we present parallel DFT calculations and an experimental kinetic study on model molecules in order to quantitatively assess the effect of neighbouring fluorinated groups on the transesterification reaction rate.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A New Look at Molecular and Electronic Structure of Homoleptic Diiron(II,II) Complexes with N,N&#8208;Bidentate Ligands: Combined Experimental and Theoretical Study</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The new factors governing the molecular and electronic structures of Fe&#8722;Fe bonded diiron(II,II) complexes were revealed based on comprehensive experimental characterization along with high&#8208;level ab&#8208;intio calculations. We present the unprecedented non&#8208;centrosymmetric complex [Fe(&#956;&#8208;DTolF)3Fe(&#954;2&#8208;DTolF)], and the new electronic configuration of paddlewheel&#8208;type compound [Fe2(&#956;&#8208;DPhF)4].







Abstract
Paddlewheel&#8208;type binuclear complexes featuring metal&#8722;metal bonding have been the subject of widespread interest due to fundamental concern in their electronic structures and potential applications. Here, we explore the molecular and electronic structures of diiron(II,II) complexes with N,N&#8217;&#8208;diarylformamidinate ligands. While a paddlewheel&#8208;type diiron(II,II) complex with N,N&#8217;&#8208;diphenylformamidinate ligands (DPhF) exhibits the centrosymmetric [Fe2(&#956;&#8208;DPhF)4] structure, a minor alteration in the ligand system, i.&#8201;e., switching from phenyl to p&#8208;tolyl N&#8208;substituted formamidinate ligand (DTolF), resulted in the isolation of an unprecedented non&#8208;centrosymmetric [Fe(&#956;&#8208;DTolF)3Fe(&#954;2&#8208;DTolF)] complex. Both complexes were characterized using single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, magnetic measurements, 57Fe M&#246;ssbauer spectroscopy, and cyclic voltammetry along with high&#8208;level ab&#8208;initio calculations. The results provide a new view on a range of factors controlling the ground&#8208;state electronic configuration and structural diversity of homoleptic diiron(II,II) complexes. Model calculations determined that the Mayer bond orders for Fe&#8722;Fe interactions are significantly lower than 1 and equal to 0.15 and 0.28 for [Fe2(&#956;&#8208;DPhF)4] and [Fe(&#956;&#8208;DTolF)3Fe(&#954;2&#8208;DTolF)], respectively.

         <title>Barbier Hyperbranching Polymerization&#8208;Induced Emission from AB Type Monomer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Luminescent polymer materials have gained considerable research efforts in the past decades and are generally molecular designed by extending &#960; system of polymer main chain or by incorporating chromophores into polymer chain, which suffer from poor solubility, difficult synthesis, or multi&#8208;step procedure. Meanwhile, according to the step&#8208;growth polymerization theory, synthesis of hyperbranched polymers from AB type monomer is still challenging. Herein, we report a one&#8208;pot synthesis of nonconjugated luminescent hyperbranched polymer material via Barbier hyperbranching polymerization&#8208;induced emission (PIE) from AB type monomer. The key step in the realization of hyperbranched polymer is bi&#8208;functionalization of mono&#8208;functional group. Through Barbier reaction between organohalide and ester group in one pot, bi&#8208;functionalization of mono&#8208;functional ester is realized through two&#8208;step nucleophilic additions, resulting in hyperbranched polytriphenylmethanols (HPTPM). Attributed to through&#8208;space conjugation, nonconjugated HPTPMs are PIEgens and exhibit intriguing luminescent properties, which are tunable by monomer structure and polymerization time. When all phenyl groups are rotatable, HPTPM is aggregation&#8208;induced emission type PIEgen. While, it is aggregation&#8208;caused quenching type PIEgen, if some phenyl groups are rotation forbidden. Further potential applications of PIEgen in the fields of explosive detection and artificial light harvesting system are carried out. This work therefore expands the monomer library and molecular design library of hyperbranched polymer through &#8220;bi&#8208;functionalization of mono&#8208;functional group&#8221; strategy, which eventually expands the preparation library of nonconjugated luminescent polymer materials through one&#8208;pot PIE from nonemissive monomer.</dc:description>

         <title>Room&#8208;temperature Synthesized Cd&#8208;doped Cs3Cu2I5: Stable and Excitation&#8208;Wavelength Dependent Dual&#8208;Color Emission for Advanced Anti&#8208;Counterfeiting</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>With the development of intellectual properties, concerning about advanced anti&#8208;counterfeiting is accumulating, which conventional single&#8208;modal luminescence cannot realize. As one of rapidly developing 0D materials, copper&#8208;based perovskite is likely to realize multiple luminescent centers for complex emission. In this work, Cd was doped into Cs  3  Cu  2  I  5  and showed resultant emission at 560 nm which surprisingly showed a red&#8208;shifted excitation peak from that of intrinsic self&#8208;trapped emission, resulting in excitation&#8208;wavelength dependent emission. When the excitation wavelength increasing from 290 nm to 330 nm, the emission of Cd&#8208;doped Cs  3  Cu  2  I  5  changed from deep blue to cold white and finally yellow. Afterwards, Cd&#8208;doped Cs  3  Cu  2  I  5  was mixed with polystyrene to prepare anti&#8208;counterfeiting ink for silk&#8208;screen printing. Meanwhile, Cd&#8208;doped Cs  3  Cu  2  I  5  maintains outstanding stability after doping, no matter under ambient, continuous UV radiation or high&#8208;temperature environment. The intensity can be almost totally recovered after heating&#8208;and&#8208;cooling cycles. This study lays groundwork for future research into multiple luminescent center manipulation in 0D materials.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The aza&#8208;  ortho  &#8208;quinone methide (aza&#8208;  o  &#8208;QM) chemistry has overwhelmingly progressed in the past few decades. This review aims to integrate various transition metal&#8208;catalyzed and organocatalytic strategies in taming aza  &#8208;o&#8208;  QM intermediates, including its the aza&#8208;  para  &#8208;quinone methide (aza&#8208;  p  &#8208;QM), aza&#8208;  ortho  &#8208;vinylidene quinone methide (aza&#8208;  o  &#8208;VQM), aza&#8208;  ortho  &#8208;alkynyl quinone methide (aza&#8208;  o  &#8208;AQM), and indole&#8208;based aza&#8208;  o  &#8208;QM analogs. These transient species are often utilized for the direct and enantioselective synthesis of complex (hetero)polycyclic or fused&#8208;ring molecular scaffolds such as tetrahydroquinoline and indoline, among others, which are abundant in many natural products, bioactive compounds, and pharmaceuticals.</dc:description>

         <title>Effect of Annulation Mode of Twistarene on the Physical Property and Self&#8208;assembly Behavior of the Functionalized Curved Aromatic Molecules</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Four novel curved polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons  3a  ,  5  ,  8  ,  15a  have been synthesized and characterized, where molecules  3a  and  15a  bear [5]carbohelicene units. X&#8208;ray single crystal analyses indicate that compound  3a  shows offset packing arrangements of (  P  5  )&#8208; and (  M  5  )&#8208;isomers, and  15a  has a symmetrical plane and looks like a butterfly. In comparison,  8  exhibits a slightly curved structure, in which the significant convex&#8208;to&#8208;convex &#960;&#8208;overlap with the shortest distance of 3.42 &#197; occurs. In addition, the effect of annulation mode of twistarenes on the physical properties, self&#8208;assembly behaviors, and switchable photoconductivity of the as&#8208;prepared curved aromatic compounds were further examined in a comparative manner.</dc:description>

         <title>New approaches toward building Csp&#8208;P bond, a two&#8208;decade overview</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Since the review of Savignac, the past 20 years have seen significant progresses on the synthesis of alkynylphosphorus compounds considerably expanding the original and rather limited organic toolbox. This comprehensive review explores the latest and potentially greener methodologies using sustainable catalysis or direct metal&#8208;free couplings from stable and easy to handle precursors. Recent progresses and mechanistic insights for metal&#8208;catalyzed reactions with a particular emphasis on copper, palladium, nickel and silver catalytic systems, photocatalytic and metal&#8208;free reactions are detailed covering most of the publications related to this field since 2000 until March 2022.</dc:description>

         <title>Recyclable Mn(I) Catalysts for Base&#8208;Free Asymmetric Hydrogenation: Mechaistic, DFT and Catalytic Studies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report here a mechanistic, DFT and catalytic study on a series of Mn(I) complexes 1 , 2 ( a&#8208;d ), 3 , 4 . The studies apprehended the requirements for Mn(I) complexes to be active in both asymmetric direct ( AH ) and transfer hydrogenations ( ATH ). The investigations disclosed 6 vital factors accelerating the formation of a resting species, which plays a significant role in lowering the activities of the Mn(I) complex 1 in ATH and AH , respectively. In addition, we also report here a base free Mn(I) catalyzed ATH of aryl alkyl ketones with high enantioselectivity (up to 98% ee) and improved activity. More significantly, a novel and simple single&#8208;step process for recycling the resting species from the catalytic leftover has been discovered. Notably, the studies provide evidence for the existence of two different temperature dependent mechanisms for AH and ATH , in contrast to previous studies on related systems.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The straightforward synthetic protocol leading to carbene&#8208;metal&#8208;amido (CMA) complexes (metal = Au, Cu) using a mild base and an environmentally desirable solvent (EtOH) is explored, with a focus on complexes bearing backbone&#8208;substituted N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) ligands, including BIAN&#8208;NHCs (BIAN = bis(imino)acenaphthene). The novel CMAs are structurally characterized and the gold&#8208;based CMAs bearing diverse NHCs are screened as simple, Br&#248;nsted&#8208;basic pre&#8208;catalysts. The readily accessible complexes display high catalytic activity in the intermolecular and intramolecular hydrocarboxylation of internal alkynes and alkynoic acids respectively, while the screening reveals the ancillary ligand effect of NHCs in these catalytic systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Modulation of the Naked&#8208;eye and Fluorescence Color of a Protonated Boron&#8208;doped Thiazolothiazole by Anion&#8208;dependent Hydrogen Bonding</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The reaction of a cyclic alkyl(amino)carbene (CAAC)&#8208;stabilized thiazaborolo[5,4&#8208;d]thiazaborole (TzbTzb) with strong Br&#248;nsted acids, such as HCl, HOTf (Tf = O2SCF3) and [H(OEt2)2][BArF4] (ArF  = 3,5&#8208;(CF3)2C6H3), results in the protonation of both TzbTzb nitrogen atoms. In each case X&#8208;ray crystallographic data show coordination of the counteranions (Cl&#8211;, OTf&#8211;, BArF4&#8211;  ) or solvent molecules (OEt2) to the doubly protonated fused heterocycle via hydrogen&#8208;bonding interactions, the strength of which strongly influences the  1H NMR shift of the NH  protons, enabling tuning of both the visible (yellow to red) and fluorescence (green to red) colors of these salts. DFT calculations reveal that the hydrogen bonding of the counteranion or solvent to the protonated nitrogen centers affects the intramolecular TzbTzb&#8208;to&#8208;CAAC charge transfer character involved in the S0  &#8594;S1  transition, ultimately enabling fine&#8208;tuning of their absorption and emission spectral features.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we disclosed the  contra  &#8208;thermodynamic  E  &#8594;  Z  isomerization of alkenyl silanes, according to the in situ formation of a chromophoric species, in the presence of  rac  &#8208;BINAP as the catalyst. The reaction carried out in DMSO or CH  3  CN under irradiation at 405 nm allowed the interconversion of the  E  &#8208;isomer into the Z&#8208;congeners in good to excellent yields and outstanding  Z  /  E  selectivities, on 18 examples. Finally, the mechanism of this  E  &#8594;  Z  isomerization was studied to get insight into the reaction mechanism.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The silanide [Si4{N(SiMe3)Dipp}3]&#8210; 1 transforms into the anionic siliconoid cluster [Si7{N(SiMe3)Dipp}3]&#8210; 2 with four unsubstituted silicon atoms as a contact ion pair with [K([18]crown&#8208;6)] in C6D6 at room temperature within five weeks. Anion 2 was investigated via a natural population analysis and visualization of intrinsic atomic orbitals. Magnetically induced current density calculations of 2 revealed two distinct strong diatropic vortices that sum up in one direction and create a strongly shielded apical silicon atom in 2.</dc:description>

         <title>Inducing Curvature to Pyracylene upon &#960;&#8208;Expansion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We disclose a successive &#960;&#8208;expansion of pyracylene towards boat&#8208;shaped polycyclic scaffolds. The unique structural features of the resulting compounds were revealed by X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis. Depending on the extent of &#960;&#8208;expansion the compounds display intense bathochromically shifted absorption bands in their UV/Vis spectra and are prone to several redox events as documented by cyclic voltammetry. The experimental observations are in line with the computational studies based on density functional theory, suggesting progressive narrowing of the HOMO&#8211;LUMO gap and distinct evolution of the electronic structure and aromaticity.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>DNA strand displacement is a technique to exchange one strand of a double stranded DNA by another strand (invader). It is an isothermal, enzyme free method driven by single stranded overhangs (toeholds) and is employed in DNA amplification, mismatch detection and nanotechnology. We discovered that anomeric (&#945;/&#946;) DNA can be used for heterochiral strand displacement. Homochiral DNA in &#946;&#8208;D configuration was transformed to heterochiral DNA in &#945;&#8208;D/&#946;&#8208;D configuration and further to homochiral DNA with both strands in &#945;&#8208;D configuration. Single stranded &#945;&#8208;D DNA acts as invader. New anomeric displacement systems with and without toeholds were designed. Due to their resistance against enzymatic degradation, the systems are applicable to living cells. The light&#8208;up intercalator ethidium bromide is used as fluorescence sensor to follow the progress of displacement. Anomeric DNA displacement shows benefits over canonical DNA in view of toehold free displacement and simple detection by ethidium bromide.</dc:description>

         <title>Ultrafast Electrochemical Capacitors with Carbon Related Materials as Electrodes for AC Line Filtering</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 31, June 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Carbon&#8208;related electrode materials have been widely demonstrated to significantly increase the performance of electrochemical capacitors because of their light weight, high strength and high processability. The preparation method and structure design of carbon&#8208;related electrode materials are very important to the performance of capacitors.







Abstract
High&#8208;frequency responsive electrochemical capacitors (ECs), which can directly convert alternating current (AC) to direct current (DC), are getting more essential for the rapid development of electronic devices. In order to satisfy the requirements of ECs with fast rate capability and appreciable capacitance density, numerous efforts have been made towards the preparation and design of the electrode material, which is a decisive factor in the performance of ECs. Carbon&#8208;related electrode materials have been widely shown to significantly increase the performance of ECs because of their light weight, high strength, and high processability. In this concept, the latest advances in the rational design and controllable fabrication of carbon&#8208;related electrode materials, including planar 2D materials, random 3D, and vertical carbon materials are summarized. Moreover, the state of the art of carbon&#8208;based ECs is discussed from the viewpoint of the structure of the electrode and performance of ECs. Finally, this concept presents integrated perspectives on the further design and preparation of carbon related ECs.

         <title>pH&#8208;Triggered Removal of Nitrogenous Organic Micropollutants from Water by Using Metal&#8208;Organic Polyhedra</title>

MOPping up micropollutants: A new pH&#8208;triggered pollutant&#8208;removal methodology that uses water&#8208;soluble metal&#8208;organic polyhedra (MOPs) as coordinative capturing agents removes nitrogenous organic micropollutants from water. The exohedral coordination positions in the MOP structure are harnessed to coordinatively sequester the coordinating pollutants, while the exposed surface carboxyl groups are used to control their solubility in water through acid/base reactions. Benzotriazole (BT), benzothiazole (BTZ), 1&#8208;napthylamine (NA) and isoquinoline (IQ) were selected to validate this methodology.







Abstract
Water pollution threatens human and environmental health worldwide. Thus, there is a pressing need for new approaches to water purification. Herein, we report a novel supramolecular strategy based on the use of a metal&#8208;organic polyhedron (MOP) as a capture agent to remove nitrogenous organic micropollutants from water, even at very low concentrations (ppm), based exclusively on coordination chemistry at the external surface of the MOP. Specifically, we exploit the exohedral coordination positions of RhII&#8208;MOP to coordinatively sequester pollutants bearing N&#8208;donor atoms in aqueous solution, and then harness their exposed surface carboxyl groups to control their aqueous solubility through acid/base reactions. We validated this approach for removal of benzotriazole, benzothiazole, isoquinoline, and 1&#8208;napthylamine from water.

         <title>Stable Triarylmethyl Radicals and Cobalt(II) Ions Based 1D/2D Coordination Polymers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 31, June 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Imidazole&#8208;substituted tris(2,4,6&#8208;trichlorophenyl)methyl radical ligands (L1 and L2) were synthesized in a facile way. They are stable and can be used to construct crystalline 1D and 2D open&#8208;shell coordination polymers (CoCP&#8208;1 and CoCP&#8208;2) with cobalt(II) ions. Both polymers show antiferromagnetic interaction between carbon&#8208;centered radicals and the high&#8208;spin Co(II) ions.







Abstract
The incorporation of organic radicals into coordination polymers was considered as a promising strategy to promote metal&#8208;ligand exchange interactions, but there are only a very limited number of stable organic radical&#8208;based ligands that can serve well such a purpose. Herein, we report two new tris(2,4,6&#8208;trichlorophenyl)methyl (TTM) radical&#8208;based ligands L1 and L2 with two and three imidazole substituents, respectively. The imidazole unit serves as a coordination site and it can also stabilize the TTM radical by intramolecular donor&#8211;acceptor interaction. Coordination of L1 and L2 with cobalt(II) ions gave the corresponding one&#8208; (CoCP&#8208;1) and two&#8208;dimensional (CoCP&#8208;2) coordination polymers, the structures of which were confirmed by X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis. Magnetic measurements and theoretical calculations suggest antiferromagnetic coupling between the paramagnetic cobalt(II) ions and the radical ligands. Our study provides a rational design for stable organic radical&#8208;based ligands and further demonstrated the feasibility of a metal&#8211;radical approach toward magnetic materials.

         <title>Orthogonalization of Polyaryl Linkers as a Route to More Porous Phosphonate Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 31, June 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Orthogonalization of components inhibits efficient packing, whether of bagels or polyaryl linkers in metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs). This strategy was applied to polyphosphonate linkers to generate six new MOF structures (CALF&#8208;35 to &#8208;39). Ba, Sr, Mg, Zn and two Ca structures were obtained from a new trigonal linker with orthogonal peripheral aryl rings to inhibit efficient packing. The structures are discussed considering their porosity, stability and selective sorption of gases.







Abstract
The coordinative pliancy of the phosphonate functional group means that metal&#8208;phosphonate materials often self&#8208;assemble as well&#8208;packed structures with minimal porosity, as efficient inter&#8208;ligand packing is enabled. Here, we report a multistep synthesis of a novel aryl&#8208;phosphonate linker with an orthogonalized ligand core, 1,3,5&#8208;tris(4&#8217;&#8208;phosphonophenyl)&#8208;2,4,6&#8208;trimethylbenzene (H6L2) designed to form more open structures. A series of crystalline metal&#8208;phosphonate frameworks (CALF&#8208;35 to &#8208;39) have been assembled by coordinating to divalent metals (Ba, Sr, Ca, Mg, Zn). H6L2 is unable to pack efficiently and, as a consequence, yields several distinct microporous structures. The resulting structures are discussed in detail, with a focus on the solid&#8208;state packing of the sterically rigidified linker. Combined with larger cations (Sr, and Ba), H6L2 packs in a parallel&#8208;offset manner, yielding isomorphous and microporous metal&#8208;organic frameworks (CALF&#8208;35 (Sr), and (Ba)). When coordinated to smaller metals (Ca, Mg, Zn), H6L2 forms four new structures. Two Ca MOFs of different stoichiometry, (CALF&#8208;36 and 37) and a Mg MOF CALF&#8208;38 show narrow pores and have high selectivities for CO2 over N2 and CH4. Finally, in CALF&#8208;39 (Zn), H6L2 linkers pack in a herringbone fashion, resulting in a material with 10.9&#215;10.1&#8197;&#197;2 square channels. The stability of all structures was tested, and the most porous structure, CALF&#8208;39 (Zn), was found to retain its structure and gas adsorption after immersion in water over pH&#8197;3&#8211;11.

         <title>How the Chalcogen Atom Size Dictates the Hydrogen&#8208;Bond Donor Capability of Carboxamides, Thioamides, and Selenoamides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 31, June 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The bigger the better! Thioamides and selenoamides are better hydrogen&#8208;bond donors than carboxamides because their amino groups are more positively charged. Quantum chemical analyses reveal that this counterintuitive phenomenon, which is not explainable by the electronegativity, results from the effective steric size of the chalcogen atoms.







Abstract
The amino groups of thio&#8208; and selenoamides can act as stronger hydrogen&#8208;bond donors than of carboxamides, despite the lower electronegativity of S and Se. This phenomenon has been experimentally explored, particularly in organocatalysis, but a sound electronic explanation is lacking. Our quantum chemical investigations show that the NH2 groups in thio&#8208; and selenoamides are more positively charged than in carboxamides. This originates from the larger electronic density flow from the nitrogen lone pair of the NH2 group towards the lower&#8208;lying &#960;*C=S and &#960;*C=Se orbitals than to the high&#8208;lying &#960;*C=O orbital. The relative energies of the &#960;* orbitals result from the overlap between the chalcogen np and carbon 2p atomic orbitals, which is set by the carbon&#8208;chalcogen equilibrium distance, a consequence of the Pauli repulsion between the two bonded atoms. Thus, neither the electronegativity nor the often&#8208;suggested polarizability but the steric size of the chalcogen atom determines the amide's hydrogen&#8208;bond donor capability.

         <dc:description>
The dual Lewis acidity of &#947;&#8208;alumina is reported to enable rapid &#960;&#8208;extension of readily available building blocks through the tandem activation of &#8220;soft&#8221; triple C&#8722;C bonds and hard C&#8722;F bonds. The reaction gives facile access to elusive non&#8208;alternant polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons such as &#960;&#8208;extended helicenes and geodesic carbon nanoribbon fragments.







Abstract
We have discovered a dual (i.&#8201;e., soft and hard) Lewis acidity of alumina that enables rapid one&#8208;pot &#960;&#8208;extension through the activation of terminal alkynes followed by C&#8722;F activation. The tandem reaction introduces an acenaphthene fragment &#8211; an essential moiety of geodesic polyarenes. This reaction provides quick access to elusive non&#8208;alternant polyarenes such as &#960;&#8208;extended buckybowls and helicenes through three&#8208;point annulation of the 1&#8208;(2&#8208;ethynyl&#8208;6&#8208;fluorophenyl)naphthalene moiety. The versatility of the developed method was demonstrated by the synthesis of unprecedented structural fragments of elusive geodesic graphene nanoribbons.

         <title>Deposition of Vertically Aligned Ag/Ag2S Nanoflakes on EGaIn Particles for Humidity Sensing</title>

Core&#8211;shell EGaIn/Ag particles were prepared in an ultrasonication assisted galvanic replacement reaction, and were subsequently transformed into EGaIn/Ag/Ag2S by a partial sulfurization. A humidity sensor based on the EGaIn/Ag/Ag2S particles showed superior sensing response to EGaIn and EGaIn/Ag due to the silver sulfide in the composites; two conduction mechanisms take place simultaneously.







Abstract
Liquid metals, which possess both good electrical conductivity and liquid&#8208;like processability, have drawn much attention recently. They are also capable of acting as synthesis templates to guide the deposition of other functional materials. Herein, through an in&#8208;situ galvanic replacement reaction assisted by ultrasonication, core&#8211;shell EGaIn/Ag particles composed of EGaIn cores and vertically aligned Ag nanoflakes as shells were prepared; they were further sulfurized to yield ternary EGaIn/Ag/Ag2S core&#8211;shell composite particles. A humidity sensor based on EGaIn/Ag/Ag2S particles showed much higher sensing response than EGaIn and EGaIn/Ag. Such superior performance could be attributed to the n&#8208;type semiconducting character of Ag2S allowing it to receive electrons from water molecules at low humidity, and its highly hydrophilic surface allowing it to absorb more water molecules at higher humidity so as to enable the formation of ion&#8208;conductive paths.

         <title>Constructing Atomic Fe and N Co&#8208;doped Hollow Carbon Nanospheres with a Polymer Encapsulation Strategy for High&#8208;Performance Lithium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries with Accelerated Polysulfide Conversion</title>

A polymer encapsulation strategy is designed to synthesize atomic Fe and N co&#8208;doped hollow carbon nanospheres (Fe&#8722;NHC) with Fe&#8722;Nx sites for modifying commercial PP separator of LSBs to suppress the shuttle effect and promote the sluggish kinetics of intermediate polysulfides. Therefore, the battery with the Fe&#8722;NHC/PP separator delivers outstanding cycling and rate performances. Even at a harsh current density of 4&#8197;C, a high capacity of 824&#8197;mA&#8201;h&#8201;g&#8722;1 is achieved, indicating the superiority of the Fe&#8208;NHC/PP separator in LSBs.







Abstract
As competitive next&#8208;generation rechargeable batteries, lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries (LSBs) suffer from the shuttle effect and the sluggish kinetics of intermediate polysulfides during charge and discharge processes, adversely affecting their electrochemical performances and actual applications. Herein, we demonstrate a polymer encapsulation strategy to synthesize atomic Fe and N co&#8208;doped hollow carbon nanospheres (Fe&#8722;NHC) with Fe&#8722;Nx sites for modifying commercial PP separator of LSBs to suppress the shuttle effect and promote the kinetics of intermediate polysulfides. Benefiting from the excellent structural design, the doped&#8208;N with positive charges could effectively adsorb negatively charged soluble polysulfides, help attract the soluble polysulfides to the Fe atoms and boost the catalytic transformation of the soluble polysulfides. Additionally, such a thin carbon shell could provide a short mass diffusion pathway and hence promote the adsorption and the catalytic conversion. Therefore, the battery with the Fe&#8722;NHC/PP separator delivers outstanding cycling and rate performances. At the large current density of 1&#8197;C, the specific capacity is 1079&#8197;mA&#8201;h&#8201;g&#8722;1 and maintains a low loss of 0.076&#8201;% per cycle within 500&#8197;cycles. Even at a harsh current density of 4&#8197;C, a high capacity of 824&#8197;mA&#8201;h&#8201;g&#8722;1 is still achieved, indicating the advantage of the Fe&#8722;NHC/PP separator in LSBs.

         <title>Mesoionic Dithiolates (MIDts) Derived from 1,3&#8208;Imidazole&#8208;Based Anionic Dicarbenes (ADCs)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 31, June 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mesoionic dithiolates Li(MIDts) as well as heteroleptic (MIDt)GeCl and homoleptic (MIDt)2Ge germylenes are reported as crystalline solids. The germylene (MIDt)2Ge features the highest&#8208;lying HOMO (&#8722;4.37&#8197;eV) and has the smallest HOMO&#8208;LUMO energy gap (2.82&#8197;eV) among the hitherto known germylenes. Insertion of GeCl2 into the Ge&#8722;Cl bond of (MIDt)GeCl affords the Ge&#8722;Ge catenation product (MIDt)GeGeCl3, a mixed&#8208;valence Ge(+1)/Ge(+3) compound.







Abstract
Mesoionic dithiolates [(MIDtAr)Li(LiBr)2(THF)3] (MIDtAr={SC(NDipp)}2CAr; Dipp=2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3; Ar=Ph 3&#8201;a, 3&#8208;MeC6H4 (3&#8208;Tol) 3&#8201;b, 4&#8208;Me2NC6H4 (DMP) 3&#8201;c) and [(MIDtPh)Li(THF)2] (4) are readily accessible (in&#8805;90&#8201;% yields) as crystalline solids on treatments of anionic dicarbenes Li(ADCAr) (2&#8201;a&#8208;c) (ADCAr={C(NDipp)2}2CAr) with elemental sulfur. 3&#8201;a&#8208;c and 4 are monoanionic ditopic ligands with both the sulfur atoms formally negatively charged, while the 1,3&#8208;imidazole unit bears a formal positive charge. Treatment of 4 with (L)GeCl2 (L=1,4&#8208;dioxane) affords the germylene (MIDtPh)GeCl (5) featuring a three&#8208;coordinated Ge atom. 5 reacts with (L)GeCl2 to give the Ge&#8722;Ge catenation product (MIDtPh)GeGeCl3 (6). KC8 reduction of 5 yields the homoleptic germylene (MIDtPh)2Ge (7). Compounds 3&#8201;a&#8208;c and 4&#8211;7 have been characterized by spectroscopic studies and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. The electronic structures of 4&#8211;7 have been analyzed by DFT calculations.

         <title>Glucosylated 5&#8208;Hydroxymethylpyrimidines as Epigenetic DNA Bases Regulating Transcription and Restriction Cleavage</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 31, June 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Glucosylation's glitches: Glucosylated 5&#8208;hydroxymethylpyrimidines were studied as epigenetic DNA modifications that fully inhibit the cleavage of DNA by restriction endonucleases. However, only the presence of glucosylated 5hmU inhibited transcription, whereas DNA containing glucosylated 5hmC remained transcriptionally active. This suggests a role for glucosylation by T4 phage &#946;&#8208;glucosyltransferase.







Abstract
5&#8208;(&#946;&#8208;d&#8208;Glucopyranosyloxymethyl)&#8208;2&#8217;&#8208;deoxyuridine and &#8208;cytidine 5&#8217;&#8208;O&#8208;triphosphates were prepared and used for polymerase&#8208;mediated (primer extension or PCR) synthesis of DNA containing glucosylated 5&#8208;hydroxymethyluracil (5hmU) or 5&#8208;hydroxymethyluracil (5hmC). The presence of any glucosylated pyrimidines fully protected DNA from cleavage by type II restriction endonucleases. On the other hand, while the presence of glucosylated 5hmU completely inhibited transcription by bacterial (Escherichia coli) RNA polymerase, the DNA containing the corresponding glucosylated 5hmC allowed a similar level of transcription as natural DNA. This suggests different roles of these hypermodified bases in the epigenetic regulation of transcription in bacteriophages or kinetoplastid parasites. Consequently, enzymatic glucosylation of 5hmC&#8208;containing DNA can be used for tuning of transcription activity.

&lt;p&gt;5-(&#946;-&lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;d&lt;/span&gt;-Glucopyranosyloxymethyl)-2&#8217;-deoxyuridine and -cytidine 5&#8217;-&lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;-triphosphates were prepared and used for polymerase-mediated (primer extension or PCR) synthesis of DNA containing glucosylated 5-hydroxymethyluracil (5hmU) or 5-hydroxymethyluracil (5hmC). The presence of any glucosylated pyrimidines fully protected DNA from cleavage by type II restriction endonucleases. On the other hand, while the presence of glucosylated 5hmU completely inhibited transcription by bacterial (&lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt;) RNA polymerase, the DNA containing the corresponding glucosylated 5hmC allowed a similar level of transcription as natural DNA. This suggests different roles of these hypermodified bases in the epigenetic regulation of transcription in bacteriophages or kinetoplastid parasites. Consequently, enzymatic glucosylation of 5hmC-containing DNA can be used for tuning of transcription activity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Exploring the Biosynthetic Potential of TsrM, a B12&#8208;dependent Radical SAM Methyltransferase Catalyzing Non&#8208;radical Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 31, June 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
TsrM is a B12&#8208;dependent radical SAM enzyme catalyzing methylation reactions from carbon&#8208;atoms to nucleophilic atoms making it a unique and versatile alkylating agent. TsrM is able to directly transfer methyl groups on the less reactive carbon atom of the indole ring and to install several methyl groups on its substrate. TsrM has thus unique properties among radical SAM enzymes by notably catalyzing non&#8208;radical reactions. (SAM: S&#8208;adenosyl&#8208;L&#8208;methionine).







Abstract
B12&#8208;dependent radical SAM enzymes are an emerging enzyme family with approximately 200,000 proteins. These enzymes have been shown to catalyze chemically challenging reactions such as methyl transfer to sp2&#8208; and sp3&#8208;hybridized carbon atoms. However, to date we have little information regarding their complex mechanisms and their biosynthetic potential. Here we show, using X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy, mutagenesis and synthetic probes that the vitamin B12&#8208;dependent radical SAM enzyme TsrM catalyzes not only C&#8208; but also N&#8208;methyl transfer reactions further expanding its synthetic versatility. We also demonstrate that TsrM has the unique ability to directly transfer a methyl group to the benzyl core of tryptophan, including the least reactive position C4. Collectively, our study supports that TsrM catalyzes non&#8208;radical reactions and establishes the usefulness of radical SAM enzymes for novel biosynthetic schemes including serial alkylation reactions at particularly inert C&#8722;H bonds.

         <title>A Carbene&#8208;Stabilized Boryl&#8208;Phosphinidene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 31, June 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
What hides within: Three different singlet boryl phosphinidenes were synthesized by using cAAC carbene, and their inversely polarized phosphaalkene characteristics were investigated. Quantum mechanical studies suggest that the P center of these boryl phosphinidenes contains two lone pairs viz., an &#963;&#8208;type lone pair and a &#8220;hidden&#8221; &#960;&#8208;type lone pair.







Abstract
Herein, the synthesis and characterization of the carbene&#8208;stabilized boryl phosphinidenes 1&#8211;3 are reported. Compounds 1&#8211;3 are obtained by reacting Me&#8208;cAAC=PK (Me2&#8208;cAAC=dimethyl cyclic(alkyl)(amino)carbene) and dihaloaryl borane in toluene. All three compounds were characterized by X&#8208;ray crystallography. Quantum mechanical studies indicated that these compounds have two lone pairs on the P center viz., an &#963;&#8208;type lone pair and a &#8220;hidden&#8221; &#960;&#8208;type lone pair. Hence, these compounds can act as double Lewis bases, and the basicity of the &#960;&#8208;type lone pair is higher than the &#963;&#8208;type lone pair.

         <title>Generalizing the Aromatic &#948;&#8208;Amino Acid Foldamer Helix</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 31, June 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Quinoline (Q), pyridine (P), and benzene&#8208;based (B) &#948;&#8208;amino acids are shown to be compatible in that sequences comprised of these units generally fold into canonical aromatic helical conformations in water. Exceptions include (P)n and (B)n sequences, but not (PB)n. Helix handedness inversion rates are considerably reduced upon introducing a small proportion of Q monomers. The position of side chains can be modulated upon changing the Q/B ratio.







Abstract
A series of aromatic oligoamide foldamer sequences containing different proportions of three &#948;&#8208;amino acids derived from quinoline, pyridine, and benzene and possessing varying flexibility, for example due to methylene bridges, were synthesized. Crystallographic structures of two key sequences and 1H NMR data in water concur to show that a canonical aromatic helix fold prevails in almost all cases and that helix stability critically depends on the ratio between rigid and flexible units. Notwithstanding subtle variations of curvature, i.&#8201;e. the numbers of units per turn, the aromatic &#948;&#8208;peptide helix is therefore shown to be general and tolerant of a great number of sp3 centers. We also demonstrate canonical helical folding upon alternating two monomers that do not promote folding when taken separately: folding occurs with two methylenes between every other unit, not with one methylene between every unit. These findings highlight that a fine&#8208;tuning of helix handedness inversion kinetics, curvature, and side chain positioning in aromatic &#948;&#8208;peptidic foldamers can be realized by systematically combining different yet compatible &#948;&#8208;amino acids.

         <title>Hierarchical Fibrous Honeycomb Ceramics with High Load Capability and Low Light&#8208;Off Temperature for the Next&#8208;Generation Auto Emissions Standards</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 31, June 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new 3D microarchitecture as a backbone to support the catalyst was prepared by combing with the synergy of high&#8208;strength ceramic fibers and ultrathin TiO2 nanosheets. The honeycomb ceramic exhibits a high volume&#8208;specific surface area of 3.59&#215;104&#8197;cm2/cm3, a compressive strength of 2.01&#8197;MPa. It also delivered a low light&#8208;off temperature of 150&#8201;&#176;C.







Abstract
Novel and stringent automotive exhaust gas emissions standards are urgently needed to counter the problems posed by the worsening global climate and environment. However, the traditional cordierite&#8208;based honeycomb ceramics substrates with ultimate pore density have seriously restricted the establishment of new emission standards. Herein, we introduce a novel robust substrate with tailored volume&#8208;specific surface area and low heat capacity. This substrate employs the synergy of high&#8208;strength ceramic fibers and ultrathin TiO2 nanosheets. The micro&#8208;sized fibers provide support to ensure structural strength during the catalytic reaction, while the nanosheets play the dual role of connecting the fibers and providing a high surface area for catalyst immobilization. The new three&#8208;dimensional (3D) microarchitecture exhibits a high volume&#8208;specific surface area of 3.59&#215;104&#8197;cm2/cm3, a compressive strength of 2.01&#8197;MPa, and remarkable stability after high&#8208;speed air erosion at 800&#8201;&#176;C. The honeycomb&#8208;like structure exhibit low resistance to gas flow. Furthermore, after loading with Pt and Pd nanoparticles, the composite 3D microarchitecture delivered an excellent catalytic performance and prominent structural stability, with a super low light&#8208;off temperature of 150&#8201;&#176;C. The outstanding mechanical and thermal stability and the high surface area and light&#8208;off temperature of the new substrate indicate its potential for use as a highly efficient catalytic carrier to meet the next&#8208;generation auto emissions standards.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A new 3D microarchitecture&lt;/b&gt; as a backbone to support the catalyst was prepared by combing with the synergy of high-strength ceramic fibers and ultrathin TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; nanosheets. The honeycomb ceramic exhibits a high volume-specific surface area of 3.59&#215;10&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;&#8197;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, a compressive strength of 2.01&#8197;MPa. It also delivered a low light-off temperature of 150&#8201;&#176;C.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Novel and stringent automotive exhaust gas emissions standards are urgently needed to counter the problems posed by the worsening global climate and environment. However, the traditional cordierite-based honeycomb ceramics substrates with ultimate pore density have seriously restricted the establishment of new emission standards. Herein, we introduce a novel robust substrate with tailored volume-specific surface area and low heat capacity. This substrate employs the synergy of high-strength ceramic fibers and ultrathin TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; nanosheets. The micro-sized fibers provide support to ensure structural strength during the catalytic reaction, while the nanosheets play the dual role of connecting the fibers and providing a high surface area for catalyst immobilization. The new three-dimensional (3D) microarchitecture exhibits a high volume-specific surface area of 3.59&#215;10&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;&#8197;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, a compressive strength of 2.01&#8197;MPa, and remarkable stability after high-speed air erosion at 800&#8201;&#176;C. The honeycomb-like structure exhibit low resistance to gas flow. Furthermore, after loading with Pt and Pd nanoparticles, the composite 3D microarchitecture delivered an excellent catalytic performance and prominent structural stability, with a super low light-off temperature of 150&#8201;&#176;C. The outstanding mechanical and thermal stability and the high surface area and light-off temperature of the new substrate indicate its potential for use as a highly efficient catalytic carrier to meet the next-generation auto emissions standards.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Front Cover: How the Chalcogen Atom Size Dictates the Hydrogen&#8208;Bond Donor Capability of Carboxamides, Thioamides, and Selenoamides (Chem. Eur. J. 31/2022)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 31, June 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thioamides and selenoamides are better hydrogen&#8208;bond donors than carboxamides because their amino groups are more positively charged. Quantum chemical analyses reveal that this counterintuitive phenomenon, which cannot be explained by the electronegativity, originates from the larger electronic density flow from the nitrogen lone pair of the NH2 group towards the lower&#8208;lying &#960;* orbital on the C=S or C=Se bond. This difference can be traced back to the effective steric size of the chalcogen atoms. More information can be found in the Research Article by C. Nieuwland and C. Fonseca&#8197;Guerra (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202200755).

Abstract
With the increasing emission of carbon dioxide (CO2), the conversion and utilization of CO2 have become a topic of increasing concern. Electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) is an attractive and sustainable approach for solving energy and environmental problems. Design of efficient catalysts is crucial for achieving highly efficient CO2RR. Different methods to prepare catalysts have been reported and used. Among them, electrodeposition is one of the common approaches, which has some obvious advantages, such as requiring simple equipment, environmentally benign. Especially, it can direct deposit catalysts on different substrates to prepare electrodes for CO2RR. In this review, we discuss recent advances in design and preparation of the catalysts by electrodeposition and their applications in CO2RR. Furthermore, the perspective of this promising area is also discussed.

&#8220;Our newly developed theory for quantitative prediction of the amide hydrogen&#8208;bond&#8208;donor capability by means of the energy of the &#960;*C=X level has the potential to contribute to the development of novel and improved hydrogen&#8208;bond&#8208;donor organocatalysts and hydrogen&#8208;bonded supramolecular materials.&#8221; This and more about the story behind the front cover can be found in the article at 10.1002/chem.202200755).







Abstract
Invited for the cover of this issue are Celine Nieuwland and C&#233;lia Fonseca Guerra of the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam. The image depicts how the increasing atom size of the chalcogen from O to S to Se elongates the carbon&#8211;chalcogen bond in amides due to the increase in the steric Pauli repulsion and thereby enhances the amide hydrogen&#8208;bond donor strength.

         <title>Sulfur and Azobenzenes, a Profitable Liaison: Straightforward Synthesis of Photoswitchable Thioglycosides with Tunable Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tunable properties: A direct thioarylation of azobenzenes allows to obtain symmetrical as well as challenging unsymmetrical conjugates in good yields. Importantly, photochromic and thermal relaxation properties can be easily tuned via oxidation of the sulfide linkage.







Abstract
Azobenzene photoswitches are valuable tools for controlling properties of molecular systems with light. We have been investigating azobenzene glycoconjugates to probe carbohydrate&#8208;protein interactions and to design glycoazobenzene macrocycles with chiroptical and physicochemical properties modulated by light irradiation. To date, direct conjugation of glycosides to azobenzenes was performed by reactions providing target compounds in limited yields. We therefore sought a more effective and reliable coupling method. In this paper, we report on a straightforward thioarylation of azobenzene derivatives with glycosyl thiols as well as other thiols, thereby increasing the scope of azobenzene conjugation. Even challenging unsymmetrical conjugates can be achieved in good yields via sequential or one&#8208;pot procedures. Importantly, red&#8208;shifted azoswitches, which are addressed with visible light, were easily functionalized. Additionally, by oxidation of the sulfide bridge to the respective sulfones, both the photochromic and the thermal relaxation properties of the core azobenzene can be tuned. Utilizing this option, we realized orthogonal three&#8208;state photoswitching in mixtures containing two distinct azobenzene thioglycosides.

         <title>Teaching an Old Compound New Tricks: Reversible Transamidation in Maleamic Acids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reversible transamidation is described for different maleamic acids. Amide formation and exchange proceed to equilibrium at room temperature without external catalysts, and the equilibrium composition can be controlled using different stimuli. Thermodynamic and kinetic compositions can be accessed by amide libraries produced in this way. This new dynamic bond can be useful in dynamic combinatorial chemistry.







Abstract
Dynamic combinatorial chemistry is a method widely used for generating responsive libraries of compounds, with applications ranging from chemical biology to materials science. It relies on dynamic covalent bonds that are able to form in a reversible manner in mild conditions, and therefore requires the discovery of new types of these bonds in order to progress. Amides, due to their high stability, have been scarcely used in this field and typically require an external catalyst or harsh conditions for exchange. Compounds able to undergo uncatalysed transamidation at room temperature are still rare exceptions. In this work, we describe reversible amide formation and transamidation in a class of compounds known as maleamic acids. Due to the presence of a carboxylic acid in &#946;&#8208;position, these compounds are in equilibrium with their anhydride and amine precursors in organic solvents at room temperature. First, we show that this equilibrium is responsive to external stimuli: by alternating the additions of a Br&#248;nsted acid and a base, we can switch between amide and anhydride several times without side&#8208;reactions. Next, we prove that this equilibrium provides a pathway for reversible transamidation without any added catalyst, leading to thermodynamic distributions of amides at room temperature. Lastly, we use different preparation conditions and concentrations of Br&#248;nsted acid to access different library distributions, easily controlling the transition between kinetic and thermodynamic regimes. Our results show that maleamic acids can undergo transamidation in mild conditions in a reversible and tunable way, establishing them as a new addition to the toolbox of dynamic combinatorial chemistry.

         <title>Cesium&#8208;Fluoride&#8208;Promoted Synthesis of Stable Organocesium Reagents and Their Ambident Reactivities with Arynes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Different structurally unique thio&#8208;organocesium compounds have been synthesized through a mild, one&#8208;step reaction employing CsF as a cheap source of cesium. This article also highlights the importance of their ambident character to control the divergent synthesis of stable sulfonium ylides and c&#8208;arylation products. Furthermore, fine tuning of these substrates (lacking &#945;&#8208;CH protons) helped in the preparation of various ortho&#8208;bifunctional arenes. As an advantage, reactions in one pot helped to promote the reactions through insertion mechanism to ortho&#8208;functional arenes.







Abstract
Described are the diverse reactivities of novel, stable, ambident thio&#8208;organocesium reagents (bearing electron withdrawing groups) against benzynes. Reactions at reflux temperature predominantly led to the generation of various functionalized stable sulfonium ylides and at 40&#8201;&#176;C the same reaction underwent direct c&#8208;arylation. Furthermore, lack of internal hydrogen on the cesium reagent helped to produce different ortho&#8208;bifunctional arynes in both the reactions. Interestingly, depending on the reactivities of substrates, the one&#8208;pot tri&#8208;component procedure generated either ylides or &#963;&#8208;bond insertion products.

         <title>Engineering PdIr Nanostructures Synergistically Induced by Self&#8208;assembled Surfactants and Halide Ions for Alcohol Electrooxidation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enhanced electrocatalyst engineering: Engineering PdIr nanostructures synergistically induced by self&#8208;assembled surfactants and halide ions were realized to prepare different architectures, including ultrathin nanodendrites (NDs), solid nanosheets (NSs), connected nanorings (NRs), nanoflowers (NFs), and multiply concave nanocubes (MCs). These highly anisotropic structures not only expose rich unsaturated sites, but also protect Pd sites from toxicity and electrical corrosion, which synergistically enhanced electrocatalytic performance toward alcohol oxidation.







Abstract
The design and synthesis of metallic nanocatalysts with distinct nanostructures and composition is still a noteworthy topic in the electrochemistry field. In this work, we have realized the morphological evolution of PdIr nanostructures in aqueous solution through the synergistic effect of self&#8208;assembled functional surfactants and different halide ions, and achieved precise control of the kinetic and thermodynamic crystalline growth due to the different reduction potential between PdCl42&#8722;, PdBr42&#8722;, and PdI42&#8722;. The actual precursors of PdCl42&#8722; resulted in ultrathin nanodendrites, PdClxBr(4&#8722;x)2&#8722; for nanosheets and fewer branched nanodendrites, PdClxI(4&#8722;x)2&#8722; for nanorings, nanoflowers and multiply concave nanocubes. Owing to the synergistic advantages of structure and composition (alloyed Ir), PdIr nanodendrites exhibited enhanced electrocatalytic activity, anti&#8208;poisoning ability, and stability toward alcohols (including ethanol, methanol, and glycerol) electrooxidation reactions. The results would be helpful for thoroughly understanding how structure&#8208;directing surfactants and halide ions synergistically determine the production of advanced metallic nanocrystals.

&lt;sup&gt;2&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;. The actual precursors of PdCl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; resulted in ultrathin nanodendrites, PdCl&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt;Br&lt;sub&gt;(4&#8722;&lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;)&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; for nanosheets and fewer branched nanodendrites, PdCl&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt;I&lt;sub&gt;(4&#8722;&lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;)&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; for nanorings, nanoflowers and multiply concave nanocubes. Owing to the synergistic advantages of structure and composition (alloyed Ir), PdIr nanodendrites exhibited enhanced electrocatalytic activity, anti-poisoning ability, and stability toward alcohols (including ethanol, methanol, and glycerol) electrooxidation reactions. The results would be helpful for thoroughly understanding how structure-directing surfactants and halide ions synergistically determine the production of advanced metallic nanocrystals.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Tricyanoborane&#8208;Functionalized Anionic N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbenes: Adjustment of Charge and Stereo&#8208;Electronic Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The tricyanoborane group is a highly promising substituent for the design of versatile building blocks. The introduction of one and two B(CN)3 groups at the N atoms of the N&#8208;heterocyclic core of NHC ligands results in a successive increase in &#963;&#8208;donor and &#960;&#8208;acceptor ability in conjunction with a tuning of the ditopic coordination properties.







Abstract
The 1&#8208;methyl&#8208;3&#8208;(tricyanoborane)imidazolin&#8208;2&#8208;ylidenate anion (2) was obtained in high yield by deprotonation of the B(CN)3&#8208;methylimidazole adduct 1. Regarding charge and stereo&#8208;electronic properties, anion 2 closes the gap between well&#8208;known neutral NHCs and the ditopic dianionic NHC, the 1,3&#8208;bis(tricyanoborane)imidazolin&#8208;2&#8208;ylidenate dianion (IIb). The influence of the number of N&#8208;bonded tricyanoborane moieties on the &#963;&#8208;donating and &#960;&#8208;accepting properties of NHCs was assessed by quantum chemical calculations and verified by experimental data on 2, IIb, and 1,3&#8208;dimethylimidazolin&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene (IMe, IIa). Therefore NHC 2, which acts as a ditopic ligand via the carbene center and the cyano groups, was reacted with alkyl iodides, selenium, and [Ni(CO)4] yielding alkylated imidazoles 3 and 4, the anionic selenium adduct 5, and the anionic nickel tricarbonyl complex 8, respectively. The results of this study prove that charge, number of coordination sites, buried volume (%Vbur) and &#963;&#8208;donor and &#960;&#8208;acceptor abilities of NHCs can be effectively fine&#8208;tuned via the number of tricyanoborane substituents.

         <title>Circular Polarized Luminescence in 1D Manganese(II) Chloride Hybrids Induced by Chiral Amino Acid Cations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Circular polarized luminescence (CPL) materials attract great attentions owing to their extensive applications in 3D optical displays and encrypted transmission. Inspired by the strategies adopted in CPL materials of lead(II) perovskites, we have successfully attained CPL&#8208;active hybrids D&#8208; and L&#8208;( tert&#8208;butyl prolinate )MnCl 3 by assembling chiral D/L tert&#8208;butyl prolinate with manganese(II) chloride. As demonstrated by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, the as&#8208;formed hybrids consist of one&#8208;dimensional (1D) chains of face&#8208;sharing MnCl 6 octahedra, surrounded by prolinate cations. The 1D Mn(II) hybrids display strong red emission peaked at 646 nm with PLQY of 67.1 % for D&#8208;type and 57.2% for L&#8208;type, which are among the highest rank of PLQY in 1D Mn(II) hybrids. Interestingly, the 1D Mn(II) hybrids exhibit prominent circular dichroism (CD) signals and remarkable CPL activity with the dissymmetry factor g of 6.1&#180;10 &#8208;3 and &#8208;6.3&#180;10 &#8208;3 for D&#8208; and L&#8208;( tert&#8208;butyl prolinate )MnCl 3 , respectively. The obtained g represents the highest value for non&#8208;lead organic&#8208;inorganic hybrids.</dc:description>

         <title>Lanthanide SMMs based on Belt Macrocycles: Recent Advances and General Trends</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Enhancement of axial magnetic anisotropy is the central objective to push forward the performance of Single&#8208;Molecule Magnet (SMM) complexes. In the case of mononuclear lanthanide complexes, the chemical environment around the paramagnetic ion must be tuned to place strongly interacting ligands along either the axial positions or the equatorial plane, depending on the oblate or prolate preference of the selected lanthanide. One classical strategy to achieve a precise chemical environment for a metal centre is using highly structured, chelating ligands. A natural approach for axial&#8208;equatorial control is the employment of macrocycles acting in a belt conformation, providing the equatorial coordination environment, and leaving room for axial ligands. In this review, we present a survey of SMMs based on the macrocycle belt motif. Literature systems are divided in three families (crown ether, Schiff&#8208;base and metallacrown) and their general properties in terms of structural stability and SMM performance are briefly discussed.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The diversification of natural products to expand biologically relevant chemical space for drug discovery can be achieved by combining complementary bioprocessing and chemical transformations. Herein, we combined genetically&#8208;engineered  Escherichia coli  fermentation to produce amorphadiene and valencene, and metal&#8208;free photocatalysis transformations to further access nootkatone,  cis  &#8208;nootkatol and two hydration derivatives. In fermentation, using a closed, anaerobic condition avoided the use of organic overlay, increased the productivity, and simplified the work&#8208;up process. Metal&#8208;free photocatalysis hydration and allylic C&#8208;H oxidation were designed and implemented to make the whole process greener. We also elucidated that the  anti  &#8208;Markovnikov selectivity of photocatalyzed alkene hydration could be reversed by stereoelectronic and steric effects existing in complex natural products. The combination of bioprocessing and photocatalysis may provide an efficient and greener way to expand the chemical space for pharmaceutical, flavor and fragrance industry.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The industrial removal of organosulfur impurities from fossil fuels relies on transition metal&#8208;based catalysts in harsh conditions (ca. 400 &#176;C, up to 100 bar H  2  ), yet desulfurization (DS) of refractory alkyl dibenzothiophenes (DBTs) remains challenging. Here, we report that carbon&#8208;supported potassium hydride (KH/C) enables efficient DS of DBTs in mild conditions, viz. &gt;97% conversion of DBTs is achieved at 165 &#176;C in 3&#8208;6 h while the yields of respective biphenyls are 84&#8208;95% using only 15% excess of KH per a C&#8211;S bond. In addition, KH/C allows to lower the concentration of 4,6&#8208;Me  2  DBT in the mesitylene solution from 1000 ppm to &lt;3 ppm (165 &#176;C, 20 h) and provides deoxygenation, denitrogenation and catalytic aromatic hydrogenation reactions. DS of various sulfur heterocycles using KH/C, a transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free material based on earth abundant elements, is viable at low temperature and has prospects for the further development towards decentralized removal of organosulfur species from fossil fuels.</dc:description>

         <title>Electron&#8208;Rich 3,4&#8208;Ethylenedioxythiophene (EDOT) Linkers in Tetracationic bis&#8208;Triarylborane Chromophores: Influence on Water&#8208;Stability, Bio&#8208;macromolecule Sensing, and Photoinduced Cytotoxicity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Three novel tetracationic bis&#8208;triarylboranes with 3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene (EDOT) linkers, and their neutral precursors, showed significant red&#8208;shifted absorption and emission compared to their thiophene&#8208;containing analogues, with one of the EDOT&#8208;derivatives emitting in the NIR region. Only the EDOT&#8208;linked trixylylborane tetracation was stable in aqueous solution, indicating that direct attachment of a thiophene or even 3&#8208;methylthiophene to the boron atom is insufficient to provide hydrolytic stability in aqueous solution. Further comparative analysis of the EDOT&#8208;linked trixylylborane tetracation and its bis&#8208;thiophene analogue revealed efficient photo&#8208;induced singlet oxygen production, with the consequent biological implications. Thus, both analogues bind strongly to ds&#8208;DNA and BSA, very efficiently enter living human cells, accumulate in several different cytoplasmic organelles with no toxic effect but, under intense visible light irradiation, they exhibit almost instantaneous and very strong cytotoxic effects, presumably attributed to singlet oxygen production. Thus, both compounds are intriguing theranostic agents, whose intracellular and probably intra&#8208;tissue location can be monitored by strong fluorescence, allowing switching on of the strong bioactivity by well&#8208;focused visible light.</dc:description>

         <title>Controlling the flexibility of MIL&#8208;88A(Sc) through synthetic optimisation and postsynthetic halogenation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Breathing behaviour in metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs), the distinctive transformation between a porous phase and a less (or non) porous phase, often controls the uptake of guest molecules, endowing flexible MOFs with highly selective gas adsorptive properties  . In highly flexible topologies, breathing can be tuned by linker modification, which is typically achieved pre&#8208;synthetically by the use of functionalised linkers.  Herein, we show that MIL&#8208;88A(Sc) exhibits the characteristic flexibility of its topology, which can be tuned by (i) modifying synthetic conditions to yield a formate&#8208;buttressed analogue that is rigid and porous, and (ii) postsynthetic bromination across the alkene functionality of the fumarate ligand, generating a product that is rigid but non&#8208;porous. As well as providing different methodologies for tuning the flexibility and breathing behaviour of this archetypal MOF, we show that bromination of the formate&#8208;bridged analogue results in an identical material, representing a rare example of two different MOFs being postsynthetically converted to the same end product.</dc:description>

         <title>A Radical/Iminium Domino Strategy (RIDS) for Rapid Construction of Sterically Congested &#947;&#8208;Lactam&#8208;based Multiheterocycles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we report a Cu&#8208;catalyzed radical/iminium domino strategy (RIDS) for the efficient synthesis of quaternary&#8208;carbon&#8208;containing &#947;&#8208;lactam&#8208;based multi&#8208;heterocyclic structures from &#945;&#8208;bromocarboxamides. This domino reaction strategy enables the construction of multi&#8208;heterocycles in one step. Mechanistic studies showed that two catalytically generated iminiums are likely to be key intermediates in the catalytic cycle. The developed method can be used in a chemoselective manner to produce multi&#8208;cyclic products in the reaction with ketones possessing two different carbonyls.</dc:description>

         <title>Influence of the Linker Chemistry on the Photoinduced Charge&#8208;Transfer Dynamics of Hetero&#8208;dinuclear Photocatalysts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two dinuclear, electrochemically twofold&#8208;reduced RuRh complexes differing only in the linker chemistry between the two metal spheres are compared. Whereas the alkyne linker offers a simple trail in a flat region between the metal centers for both electrons and protons, the triazole linker, represented by a large mountain, blocks the passage of electrons between Ru and Rh. However, even in case of the mountainous triazole trail, the holes find their way between Ru and Rh. More information can be found in the Research Article by B. Dietzek&#8208;Ivan&#353;i&#263; and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202200490).

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Carbamoyl fluoride is a fluorinated group which, to this date, remains underexplored, probably due to the lack of data concerning their properties. In this paper, a study of carbamoyl fluoride is proposed. Stability studies, in particular under physiological conditions, and lipophilicity measurement have been performed. A new easy, safe, inexpensive and metal&#8208;free synthesis method has also been described. Finally, a potential use in radiochemistry through a 18F/19F isotopic exchange has been demonstrated.</dc:description>

         <title>Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) Activated Liposomal Cell Delivery using a Boronate&#8208;Caged Guanidine Lipid</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report boronate&#8208;caged guanidine&#8208;lipid  1  that activates liposomes for cellular delivery only upon uncaging of this compound by reactive oxygen species (ROS) to produce cationic lipid products. These liposomes are designed to mimic the exceptional cell delivery properties of cell&#8208;penetrating peptides (CPPs), while the inclusion of the boronate cage is designed to enhance selectivity such that cell entry will only be activated in the presence of ROS. Boronate uncaging by hydrogen peroxide was verified by mass spectrometry and zeta potential (ZP) measurements. A microplate&#8208;based fluorescence assay was developed to study the ROS&#8208;mediated vesicle interactions between  1  &#8208;liposomes and anionic membranes, which were further elucidated via dynamic light scattering (DLS) analysis. Cellular delivery studies utilizing fluorescence microscopy demonstrated significant enhancements in cellular delivery only when  1  &#8208;liposomes were incubated with hydrogen peroxide. Our results showcase that lipid  1  exhibits strong potential as an ROS&#8208;responsive liposomal platform for targeted drug delivery applications.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs) are considered as promising large&#8208;scale energy storage devices due to their high safety and low cost. Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) as the potential aqueous Zn&#8208;storage cathode materials are under the research spotlight because of their facile 2D ion&#8208;transport channels and weak electrostatic interactions with Zn2+. In this concept article, we summarize the intrinsic structural features and aqueous Zn&#8208;storage mechanisms of the TMDs&#8208;based electrodes. More significantly, the latest design concepts of TMDs materials for high&#8208;performance AZIBs are discussed in detail from three aspects of interlayer expansion engineering, phase transition engineering, and structure defects engineering. Finally, the current challenges facing TMDs cathodes and possible remedies are outlined for future developments towards efficient, rapid, and stable aqueous Zn&#8208;ion storage.</dc:description>

         <title>Homolytic X&#8208;H Bond Cleavage at a Gold(III) Hydroxide: Insights into One&#8208;Electron Events at Gold</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The mechanism of homolytic X&#8208;H bond cleavage by a Au(III)&#8208;OH complex was investigated computationally. Both C&#8722;H and O&#8722;H bonds are cleaved via a concerted proton coupled electron transfer mechanism (cPCET) rather than a hydrogen atom transfer mechanism (HAT). The results suggest that one&#8208;electron events at gold may be more accessible than anticipated.







Abstract
C(sp3)&#8208;H and O&#8722;H bond breaking steps in the oxidation of 1,4&#8208;cyclohexadiene and phenol by a Au(III)&#8208;OH complex were studied computationally. The analysis reveals that for both types of bonds the initial X&#8722;H cleavage step proceeds via concerted proton coupled electron transfer (cPCET), reflecting electron transfer from the substrate directly to the Au(III) centre and proton transfer to the Au&#8208;bound oxygen. This mechanistic picture is distinct from the analogous formal Cu(III)&#8208;OH complexes studied by the Tolman group (J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2019, 141, 17236&#8211;17244), which proceed via hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) for C&#8722;H bonds and cPCET for O&#8722;H bonds. Hence, care should be taken when transferring concepts between Cu&#8722;OH and Au&#8722;OH species. Furthermore, the ability of Au&#8722;OH complexes to perform cPCET suggests further possibilities for one&#8208;electron chemistry at the Au centre, for which only limited examples exist.

         <title>Programming Rapid Functional Group Diversification into a Solid&#8208;State Reaction: Aryl Nitriles for Self&#8208;Assembly, Click Reactivity, and Discovery of Coexisting Supramolecular Synthons</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Getting a handle on diversification: Aryl nitriles have been used to support hydrogen&#8208;bond&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly in the solid state to achieve an intermolecular photodimerization. The resulting tetrafunctionalized cyclobutane is amenable to rapid diversification as demonstrated by a post&#8208;click modification. The integration of aryl nitriles as supramolecular handles allows the self&#8208;assembly process to be programmed for post&#8208;modification and conversion of the product to a wide variety of molecules.







Abstract
A method to rapidly diversify the molecules formed in organic crystals is introduced, with aryl nitriles playing a novel dual role as both hydrogen&#8208;bond acceptors and modifiable organic groups. The discovery of coexisting supramolecular synthons in the same crystal is also described. The general concept is demonstrated by using a bis(aryl nitrile) alkene that undergoes a hydrogen&#8208;bond&#8208;directed intermolecular [2+2] photodimerization to form a tetra(aryl nitrile)cyclobutane. The product is readily converted by click reactivity to a tetra(aryl tetrazole) and by hydrolysis to a tetra(aryl carboxylic acid). The integration of aryl nitriles into solid&#8208;state reactions opens broad avenues to post&#8208;modify products formed in crystalline solids for rapid diversification.

         <title>Hydrogenative Catalysis with Three&#8208;Coordinate Zinc Complexes Supported with PN Ligands is Enhanced Compared to PNP Analogs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Catalytic activity of bidentate three&#8208;coordinate Zn(II) complexes towards hydrogenation of model ketone and imine substrates is enhanced compared to the analogous tridentate PNP system. DFT calculations and experimental evidence point towards a sigma bond metathesis mechanism, instead of aromatization/dearomatization metal&#8208;ligand cooperativity, with the lack of trailing P&#8208;arm enabling the enhancement.







Abstract
This work details the synthesis, characterization, and catalytic activity of reactive low&#8208;coordinate organozinc complexes. The complexes activate hydrogen and they appear to be more active in hydrogenation of ketones and imines than their tridentate pincer analogs. This is thought, in part, to be due to the lack of trailing third phosphorus arm present in previous work. DFT computations reveal a sigma&#8208;bond metathesis mechanism is comparable to an alternative aromatization/dearomatization metal&#8208;ligand cooperative mechanism.

         <title>Measurements and Utilization of Consistent Gibbs Energies of Transfer of Single Ions: Towards a Unified Redox Potential Scale for All Solvents</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Consistency: 87 measurements across 10 independent junctions between four solvents and using the &#8220;ideal&#8221; ionic liquid salt bridge ILSB have furnished accurate silver ion Gibbs transfer energies between water, acetonitrile, propylene carbonate and dimethylformamide that are consistent within 0.6&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1. These form the basis for a coherent experimental thermodynamic framework of ion solvation chemistry.







Abstract
Utilizing the &#8220;ideal&#8221; ionic liquid salt bridge to measure Gibbs energies of transfer of silver ions between the solvents water, acetonitrile, propylene carbonate and dimethylformamide results in a consistent data set with a precision of 0.6&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1 over 87 measurements in 10 half&#8208;cells. This forms the basis for a coherent experimental thermodynamic framework of ion solvation chemistry. In addition, we define the solvent independent 
&#8208; and the 
 values that account for the electronating potential of any redox system similar to the 
 value of a medium that accounts for its protonating potential. This 
 scale is thermodynamically well&#8208;defined enabling a straightforward comparison of the redox potentials (reducities) of all media with respect to the aqueous redox potential scale, hence unifying all conventional solvents&#8242; redox potential scales. Thus, using the Gibbs energy of transfer of the silver ion published herein, one can convert and unify all hitherto published redox potentials measured, for example, against ferrocene, to the 
 scale.

         <title>Adaptable Optical Microwaveguides From Mechanically Flexible Crystalline Materials</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bent waveguides, especially, singly and doubly bent waveguides are essential for the advancement of photonic technologies. Here, two chemically and optically different flexible organic crystals were fabricated into singly and doubly&#8208;bent shapes from straight geometry using micromechanical manipulation technique to demonstrate optical waveguiding behavior which is required for photonic circuit applications. (Atomic force microscopy cantilever tip abbreviated as AFM cantilever)







Abstract
Flexible organic crystals (elastic and plastic) are important materials for optical waveguides, tunable optoelectronic devices, and photonic integrated circuits. Here, we present highly elastic organic crystals of a Schiff base, 1&#8208;((E)&#8208;(2,5&#8208;dichlorophenylimino)methyl)naphthalen&#8208;2&#8208;ol (1), and an azine molecule, 2,4&#8208;dibromo&#8208;6&#8208;((E)&#8208;((E)&#8208;(2,6&#8208;dichlorobenzylidene)hydrazono)methyl)phenol (2). These microcrystals are highly flexible under external mechanical force, both in the macroscopic and the microscopic regimes. The mechanical flexibility of these crystals arises as a result of weak and dispersive C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Cl, Cl&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Cl, Br&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Br, and &#960;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; stacking interactions. Singly and doubly&#8208;bent geometries were achieved from their straight shape by a micromechanical approach using the AFM cantilever tip. Crystals of molecules 1 and 2 display a bright&#8208;green and red fluorescence (FL), respectively, and selective reabsorption of a part of their FL band. Crystals 1 and 2 exhibit optical&#8208;path&#8208;dependent low loss emissions at the termini of crystal in their straight and even in extremely bent geometries. Interestingly, the excitation position&#8208;dependent optical modes appear in both linear and bent waveguides of crystals 1 and 2, confirming their light&#8208;trapping ability.

         <title>Cucurbit[7]uril Inhibits Islet Amyloid Polypeptide Aggregation by Targeting N&#160;Terminus Hot Segments and Attenuates Cytotoxicity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Towards diabetes therapeutic agents: Cucurbit[7]uril (CB[7])&#8208;mediated supramolecular modulation of islet amyloid polypeptide aggregation is demonstrated. CB[7] efficiently interacts with different amino acid residues at the N&#8197;terminus &#8220;hot segments&#8221; and alters IAPP aggregation. This type of macrocycle&#8208;based approach has the potential for the development of type&#8197;2 diabetes therapeutic agents.







Abstract
Two &#8220;hot segments&#8221; within an islet amyloid polypeptide are responsible for its self&#8208;assembly, which in turn is linked to the decline of &#946;&#8208;cells in type&#8197;2 diabetes (T2D). A readily available water&#8208;soluble, macrocyclic host, cucurbit[7]uril (CB[7]), effectively inhibits islet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP) aggregation through ion&#8211;dipole and hydrophobic interactions with different residues of the monomeric peptide in its random&#8208;coil conformation. A HSQC NMR study shows that CB[7] likely modulates IAPP self&#8208;assembly by interacting with and masking major residues present in the &#8220;hot segments&#8221; at the N&#8197;terminus. CB[7] also prevents the formation of toxic oligomers and inhibits seed&#8208;catalyzed fibril proliferation. Importantly, CB[7] recovers rat insulinoma cells (RIN&#8208;m) from IAPP&#8208;assembly associated cytotoxicity.

         <dc:description>Alkylation of nitroarenes via Vicarious Nucleophilic Substitution (VNS) was tested experimentally and
modelled with DFT calculations. Mechanistic studies reveal intrinsic differences between reactions of archetypal carbanion precursor PhSO2CH2Cl, and alkyl phenyl sulfones, in which benzenesulfinate acts, as a leaving group. Accordingly, for the latter precursors steric hindrance develops at the &#946;&#8208;elimination step, that raises energy barrier and results in the formation of byproducts.</dc:description>

         <title>Six&#8208;Step Continuous Flow Synthesis of Diclofenac Sodium via Cascade Etherification/Smiles Rearrangement Strategy: Tackling the Issues of Batch Processing</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Diclofenac sodium is a widely used nonsteroidal anti&#8208;inflammatory drug (NSAID) as over&#8208;the&#8208;counter (OTC) medication for the treatment of inflammatory diseases. Herein, we described the development of an intensified six&#8208;step continuous flow synthesis of diclofenac sodium from commercially available aniline and chloroacetic acid. A challenging and unprecedented etherification/Smiles rearrangement cascade of 2&#8208;chloro&#8208;N&#8208;phenylacetamide and 2,6&#8208;dichlorophenol into hydroxyacetyldiphenylamine operated with the precise control of reaction conditions in continuous flow was realized as key step in this multistep synthetic chemistry. The undesired amide hydrolysis in Smiles rearrangement was addressed and the extra installation of N&#8208;chloroacetyl group in current industrial batch mode was avoided. Diclofenac sodium was obtained in 63% isolated yield with an average yield of above 90% for each step in a total residence time of 205 min.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Recently,  single or few&#8208;layer phosphorene has aroused intense attention due to its exceptional physicochemical properties.  To this end, mass production of high&#8208;quality phosphorene nanosheets with specific functionalities represents a pivotal factor for the basic academic studies and practical applications.  Among the current synthetic methods, electrochemical exfoliation of black phosphorous is one of the most  hopeful ways for mass&#8208;production of phosphorene sheets owing to the uncomplicated apparatus, low cost as well as significant efficiency. Especially, regulating the electrochemical parameters not only induces adjustable phosphorene characteristics but also enables them a promising candidate in energy applications. In this review, a concise and crucial studies of the recent and most representative developments in this domain was introduced, including the relationship between exfoliation philosophy, internal mechanisms, processing techniques, and multiple applications of phosphorene. At the end, a summary discussion and future perspectives is also provided.</dc:description>

         <title>A Rationally Designed Bimetallic Platinum (II)&#8208;Ferrocene Antitumor Agent&#160;Induces Non&#8208;Apoptotic Cell Death and Exerts in Vivo Efficacy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Despite phenomenal clinical success, the efficacy of platinum anticancer drugs is often compromised due to inherent and acquired drug resistant phenotypes in cancers. To circumvent this issue, we designed two heterobimetallic platinum (II)&#8208;ferrocene hybrids that display multi&#8208;pronged anticancer action. In cancer cells, our best compound, 2, platinates DNA, produces reactive oxygen species, and has nucleus, mitochondria, and endoplasmic reticulum as potential targets. The multi&#8208;modal mechanism of action of these hybrid agents lead to non&#8208;apoptotic cell death induction which enables circumventing apoptosis resistance and significant improvement in platinum cross resistance profile. Finally, in addition to describing detail mechanistic insights, we also assessed its stability in plasma and demonstrate anticancer efficacy in an in vivo A2780 xenograft model. Strikingly, compared to oxaliplatin, our compound displays better tolerability, safety profile and efficacy in vivo.</dc:description>

         <title>Positive Cooperativity Induced by Interstrand Interactions in Silver(I) Complexes with &#945;,&#945;&#8242;&#8208;Diimine Ligands.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The allosteric positive cooperativity accompanying the formation of compact [Cu  I  (  &#945;  ,  &#945;&#8242;  &#8208;diimine)  2  ]  +  building blocks contributed to the historically efficient synthesis of metal&#8208;containing catenates and knotted assemblies. However, its limited magnitude can be easily overcome by the negative chelate cooperativity which controls the overall formation of related polymetallic multi&#8208;stranded helicates and grids. Despite the more abundant use of the analogous dioxygen&#8208;resistant [Ag  I  (  &#945;  ,  &#945;  '&#8208;diimine)  2  ]  +  units in modern entangled metallosupramolecular assemblies, a related thermodynamic justification was absent. Solid&#8208;state structural characterizations show the successive formation of [Ag  I  (  &#945;  ,  &#945;  '&#8208;diimine)(CH  3  CN)][X] and [Ag  I  (  &#945;  ,  &#945;  '&#8208;diimine)  2  ][X] upon the stepwise reactions of  &#945;  ,  &#945;  '&#8208;diimine = 2,2&#8217;&#8208;bipyridine (  bpy  ) or 1,10&#8208;phenanthroline (  phen  ) derivatives with AgX (X = BF  4  &#8211;  , ClO  4  &#8211;  , PF  6  &#8211;  ). In 5&#8211;10 mM room&#8208;temperature acetonitrile solutions, these cationic complexes exist as mixtures in fast exchange on the NMR time scale. Spectrophotometric titrations using the unsubstituted  bpy  and  phen  ligands point to the statistical (= non&#8208;cooperative) binding of two successive bidentate ligands around Ag(I), a mechanism probably driven by the formation of hydrophobic belts which overcomes the unfavorable decrease of the positive charge borne by the metallic cation. Surprisingly, the addition of methyl groups adjacent to the nitrogen donors (6,6' positions in  dmbpy  ; 2,9 positions in  dmphen  ) induces positive cooperativity for the formation of [Ag(  dmbpy  )  2  ]  +  and [Ag(  dmphen  )  2  ]  +  , a trend assigned to additional stabilizing interligand interactions.</dc:description>

         <title>The use of bridging ligand substituents to bias the population of localized and delocalized mixed&#8208;valence conformers in solution.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The electronic structure and associated spectroscopic properties of ligand&#8208;bridged, bimetallic &#8216;mixed&#8208;valence&#8217; complexes of general form {M}(&#956;&#8208;B){M  +  } are dictated by the electronic couplings, and hence orbital overlaps, between the metal centers mediated by the bridge. In the case of complexes such as [{Cp*(dppe)Ru}(&#956;&#8208;C&#8801;CC  6  H  4  C&#8801;C){Ru(dppe)Cp*}]  +  , the low barrier to rotation of the half&#8208;sandwich metal fragments and the arylene bridge around the acetylene moieties results in population of many energy minima across the conformational energy landscape. Since orbital overlap is also sensitive to the particular mutual orientations of the metal fragment(s) and arylene bridge through a Karplus&#8208;like relationship, the different members of the population range exemplify electronic structures ranging from strongly localized (weakly coupled Robin&#8208;Day Class II) to completely delocalized (Robin&#8208;Day Class III). Here we use electronic structure calculations using the hybrid density functional BLYP35&#8208;D3 and a continuum solvent model in combination with UV&#8208;vis&#8208;NIR and IR spectroelectrochemical studies to show that the conformational population in complexes [{Cp*(dppe)Ru}(&#956;&#8208;C&#8801;CArC&#8801;C){Ru(dppe)Cp*]  +  , and hence the dominant electronic structure, can be biased through the steric and electronic properties of the diethynylarylene (Ar) moiety (Ar = 1,4&#8208;C  6  H  4  , 1,4&#8208;C  6  F  4  , 1,4&#8208;C  6  H  2  &#8208;2,5&#8208;Me  2  , 1,4&#8208;C  6  H  2  &#8208;2,5&#8208;(CF  3  )  2  , 1,4&#8208;C  6  H  2  &#8208;2,5&#8208;  i  Pr  2  ).</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of 3,4&#8208;Dihydro&#8208;2H&#8208;pyrroles from Ketones, Aldehydes, and Nitro Alkanes via Hydrogenative Cyclization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Syntheses of N&#8208;heterocyclic compounds that permit a flexible introduction of various substitution patterns using inexpensive and diversely available starting materials are highly desirable. Easy to handle and reusable catalysts based on earth&#8208;abundant metals are especially attractive for these syntheses. We report here on the synthesis of 3,4&#8208;dihydro&#8208;2H&#8208;pyrroles via the hydrogenation and cyclization of nitro ketones. The latter are easily accessible from three components: a ketone, an aldehyde and a nitroalkane. Our reaction has a broad scope and 23 of the 33 products synthesized are compounds which have not yet been reported. The key to the general hydrogenation/cyclization reaction is a highly active, selective and reusable nickel catalyst, which was identified from a library of 24 earth&#8208;abundant metal catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>A High&#8208;valent Ru&#8208;PCP Pincer Catalyst for Hydrogenation of Carbonyl and Carboxyl Compounds under Molecular Hydrogen</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>ABSTRACT. Low&#8208;valent metals traditionally dominate the domain of catalytic hydrogenation. However, metal&#8208;ligand cooperating (MLC) catalytic systems, operating via heterolytic H&#8208;H bond splitting by a Lewis acidic metal and a basic ligand site, do not require an electron&#8208;rich metal. On the contrary, high&#8208;valent metals that induce weaker back donation facilitate heterolytic bond activation. Here we report, for the first time, on the efficient hydrogenation of carbonyl and carboxyl compounds under molecular hydrogen catalyzed by a structurally well&#8208;defined Ru IV catalyst 2 bearing a bifunctional PCP pincer ligand. The catalyst exhibits superior reactivity toward molecular hydrogen than does the low&#8208;valent analog and allows hydrogen activation even at room temperature.</dc:description>

         <title>Real&#8208;Space Interpretation of Interatomic Charge Transfer and Electron Exchange Effects by Combining Static and Kinetic Potentials and Associated Vector Fields</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Intricate behaviour of one&#8208;electron potentials from the Euler equation for electron density and corresponding gradient force fields in crystals was studied. Channels of locally enhanced kinetic potential and corresponding saddle Lagrange points were found between chemically bonded atoms. Superposition of electrostatic &#966;_es (r) and kinetic &#966;_k (r) potentials and electron density &#961;(r) allowed partitioning any molecules and crystals into atomic &#961;&#8208; and potential&#8208;based &#966;&#8208;basins; &#966;_k&#8208;basins explicitly account for electron exchange effect, which is missed for &#966;_es&#8208;ones. Phenomena of interatomic charge transfer and related electron exchange were explained in terms of space gaps between zero&#8208;flux surfaces of &#961;&#8208; and &#966;&#8208;basins. The gap between &#966;_es&#8208; and &#961;&#8208;basins represents the charge transfer, while the gap between &#966;_k&#8208; and &#961;&#8208;basins is a real&#8208;space manifestation of sharing the transferred electrons caused by the static exchange and kinetic effects as a response against the electron transfer. The regularity describing relative positions of &#961;&#8208;, &#966;_es&#8208;, and &#966;_k&#8208; basin boundaries between interacting atoms was proposed. The position of &#966;_k&#8208;boundary between &#966;_es&#8208; and &#961;&#8208;ones within an electron occupier atom determines the extent of transferred electron sharing. The stronger an H&#183;&#183;&#183;O hydrogen bond is, the deeper hydrogen atom&#8217;s &#966;_k&#8208;basin penetrates oxygen atom&#8217;s &#961;&#8208;basin, while for covalent bonds a &#966;_k&#8208;boundary closely approaches a &#966;_es&#8208;one indicating almost complete sharing the transferred electrons. In the case of ionic bonds, the same region corresponds to electron pairing within the &#961;&#8208;basin of an electron occupier atom.</dc:description>

         <title>Autotuning of Vibrational Strong Coupling for Site&#8208;Selective Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Site&#8208;selective chemistry opens new paths for the synthesis of technologically important molecules. When a reactant is placed inside a Fabry&#8211;Perot (FP) cavity, energy exchange between molecular vibrations and resonant cavity photons results in vibrational strong coupling (VSC). VSC has recently been implicated in modified chemical reactivity at specific reactive sites. However, as a reaction proceeds inside an FP cavity, the refractive index of the reaction solution changes, detuning the cavity mode away from the vibrational mode and weakening the VSC effect. Here we overcome this issue, developing actuatable FP cavities to allow automated tuning of cavity mode energy to maintain maximized VSC during a reaction. As an example, the site&#8208;selective reaction of the aldehyde over the ketone in 4&#8208;acetylbenzaldehyde is achieved by automated cavity tuning to maintain optimal VSC of the ketone carbonyl stretch during the reaction. A nearly 50% improvement in site&#8208;selective reactivity is observed compared to an FP cavity with static mirrors, demonstrating the utility of actuatable FP cavities as microreactors for organic chemistry.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>We synthesized two bichromophoric difluoroboron&#8208;&#946;&#8208;diketonates (DFB) connected in para and meta positions using cyclohexane diamine as a chiral bridge (para and meta (R/S)&#8208;CyDFB). TDDFT calculations revealed that the variation in connectivity of the DFB units leads to different spatial arrangements and a chirality inversion of the bichromophoric DFB. Higher g  abs  values were obtained in (R/S)&#8208;C DFB connected in para as compared to meta position. Aggregation of para (R/S)&#8208;CyDFB in mixture of solvents increase the g  lum  values as compared to its monomeric form. Ultrasonication and heating induced the formation of highly ordered nano&#8208;helical wires of para (R/S)&#8208;CyDFB that increased the g  lum  values to 0.015. On the other hand, meta (R/S)CyDFB failed to form highly ordered self&#8208;assembled wires due to hindered H&#8208;binding sites. These observations indicate that the chiroptical properties of DFB bi&#8208;chromophore system can be modulated with self&#8208;assembly and spatial arrangement of the &#8232;chromophores.</dc:description>

         <title>Methyl Viologens of Bis&#8208;(4&#8217;&#8208;Pyridylethynyl)Arenes &#8211; Structures, Photophysical and Electrochemical Studies, and their Potential Application in Biology</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Methyl&#8208;viologens containing &#960;&#8208;extended bis(N&#8208;methylpyridiniumethynyl)arenes (arene=benzene, tetrafluorobenzene, anthracene) were crystallographically characterized and their electrochemical properties and one&#8208; and two&#8208;photon absorption and fluorescence spectra were measured. With DNA/RNA, while the benzene and tetrafluorobenzene analogues bind in grooves, the anthracene analogue intercalates due to its large aromatic moiety, and aggregates within the polynucleotide when in excess over DNA/RNA. The latter compound localizes within lysosomes, preventing its interaction with cellular DNA/RNA, but exhibited cytotoxicity upon photoexcitation, due to 1O2 generation within cells.







Abstract
A series of bis&#8208;(4&#8217;&#8208;pyridylethynyl)arenes (arene=benzene, tetrafluorobenzene, and anthracene) were synthesized and their bis&#8208;N&#8208;methylpyridinium compounds were investigated as a class of &#960;&#8208;extended methyl viologens. Their structures were determined by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, and their photophysical and electrochemical properties (cyclic voltammetry), as well as their interactions with DNA/RNA were investigated. The dications showed bathochromic shifts in emission compared to the neutral compounds. The neutral compounds showed very small Stokes shifts, which are a little larger for the dications. All of the compounds showed very short fluorescence lifetimes (&lt;4&#8197;ns). The neutral compound with an anthracene core has a quantum yield of almost unity. With stronger acceptors, the analogous bis&#8208;N&#8208;methylpyridinium compound showed a larger two&#8208;photon absorption cross&#8208;section than its neutral precursor. All of the dicationic compounds interact with DNA/RNA; while the compounds with benzene and tetrafluorobenzene cores bind in the grooves, the one with an anthracene core intercalates as a consequence of its large, condensed aromatic linker moiety, and it aggregates within the polynucleotide when in excess over DNA/RNA. Moreover, all cationic compounds showed highly specific CD spectra upon binding to ds&#8208;DNA/RNA, attributed to the rare case of forcing the planar, achiral molecule into a chiral rotamer, and negligible toxicity toward human cell lines at &#8804;10&#8197;&#956;M concentrations. The anthracene&#8208;analogue exhibited intracellular accumulation within lysosomes, preventing its interaction with cellular DNA/RNA. However, cytotoxicity was evident at 1&#8197;&#956;M concentration upon exposure to light, due to singlet oxygen generation within cells. These multi&#8208;faceted features, in combination with its two&#8208;photon absorption properties, suggest it to be a promising lead compound for development of novel light&#8208;activated theranostic agents.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Methyl-viologens containing&lt;/b&gt; &#960;-extended bis(&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-methylpyridiniumethynyl)arenes (arene=benzene, tetrafluorobenzene, anthracene) were crystallographically characterized and their electrochemical properties and one- and two-photon absorption and fluorescence spectra were measured. With DNA/RNA, while the benzene and tetrafluorobenzene analogues bind in grooves, the anthracene analogue intercalates due to its large aromatic moiety, and aggregates within the polynucleotide when in excess over DNA/RNA. The latter compound localizes within lysosomes, preventing its interaction with cellular DNA/RNA, but exhibited cytotoxicity upon photoexcitation, due to &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; generation within cells.

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A series of bis-(4&#8217;-pyridylethynyl)arenes (arene=benzene, tetrafluorobenzene, and anthracene) were synthesized and their bis-&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-methylpyridinium compounds were investigated as a class of &#960;-extended methyl viologens. Their structures were determined by single crystal X-ray diffraction, and their photophysical and electrochemical properties (cyclic voltammetry), as well as their interactions with DNA/RNA were investigated. The dications showed bathochromic shifts in emission compared to the neutral compounds. The neutral compounds showed very small Stokes shifts, which are a little larger for the dications. All of the compounds showed very short fluorescence lifetimes (&amp;lt;4&#8197;ns). The neutral compound with an anthracene core has a quantum yield of almost unity. With stronger acceptors, the analogous bis-&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-methylpyridinium compound showed a larger two-photon absorption cross-section than its neutral precursor. All of the dicationic compounds interact with DNA/RNA; while the compounds with benzene and tetrafluorobenzene cores bind in the grooves, the one with an anthracene core intercalates as a consequence of its large, condensed aromatic linker moiety, and it aggregates within the polynucleotide when in excess over DNA/RNA. Moreover, all cationic compounds showed highly specific CD spectra upon binding to ds-DNA/RNA, attributed to the rare case of forcing the planar, achiral molecule into a chiral rotamer, and negligible toxicity toward human cell lines at &#8804;10&#8197;&#956;M concentrations. The anthracene-analogue exhibited intracellular accumulation within lysosomes, preventing its interaction with cellular DNA/RNA. However, cytotoxicity was evident at 1&#8197;&#956;M concentration upon exposure to light, due to singlet oxygen generation within cells. These multi-faceted features, in combination with its two-photon absorption properties, suggest it to be a promising lead compound for development of novel light-activated theranostic agents.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Molecular Bridging Enables Isolated Iron Atoms on Stereoassembled Carbon Framework To Boost Oxygen Reduction for Zinc&#8208;Air Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly dispersed Fe atoms on a porous carbon nanofiber framework (Fe&#8722;SA/NCF) are realized by a facile and scalable matrix&#8208;confined co&#8208;pyrolysis strategy based on molecular bridging. Benefitting from highly accessible Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C sites and well&#8208;tuned pore structures, Fe&#8722;SA/NCF delivers boosted oxygen reduction activity and stability via a near four&#8208;electron path, which further demonstrates potential application in zinc&#8208;air batteries, surpassing the commercial Pt/C catalyst.







Abstract
Realizing the synergy between active site regulation and rational structural engineering is essential in the electrocatalysis community but still challenging. Here, a matrix&#8208;confined co&#8208;pyrolysis strategy based on molecular bridging is demonstrated to realize highly dispersed Fe atoms on stereoassembled carbon framework. Both polyacrylonitrile matrix and organic linker from metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) provide sufficient N&#8208;anchoring sites for the generation of Fe&#8722;N4 moieties. A high Fe loading of 2.9&#8197;wt.% is readily achieved based on the scalable approach without post&#8208;treatment. Owing to the presence of highly exposed Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C sites and well&#8208;tuned pore structures, isolated Fe atoms on porous carbon nanofiber framework (Fe&#8722;SA/NCF) exhibits decent oxygen reduction activity and stability in alkaline conditions via a near four&#8208;electron path, demonstrating superior performance as air cathode for zinc&#8208;air batteries (ZABs) to commercial Pt/C catalyst.

         <title>Diverse Supports for Immobilization of Catalysts in Continuous Flow Reactors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Supports for immobilization of catalysts in flow reactors are outlined, with emphases on sustainable binding with channel walls and catalysts, boosted catalysts loading and ability to maintain fine flow properties. Particularly, the synergy of supports and catalysts are discerned, as well as the specific designs. In addition, fabrication of array&#8208;like catalytic supports and application of advanced fluidic devices are included.







Abstract
The rapid development of continuous flow processes is driving innovations in various chemical syntheses and industrial productions. Immobilizing catalysts in flow reactors allows transformations with high&#8208;efficiency and excludes the subsequent separation procedures. This concept outlines the approaches to incorporate catalysts within flow reactors, with particular focus on the application of additional supports including inorganic materials like silica, zeolite and reduced graphene oxide, polymeric materials like polymer packings, monoliths, cross&#8208;linked gels and polymer brushes, and other materials for specific conditions like transparent glass fibers and glass beads. Furthermore, advanced methods to develop ordered micro&#8208;/nanoarrays from internal walls of flow channels for immobilization of catalysts as well as application of innovative vortex fluidic devices are discussed to inspire new designs of supports for novel fluidic reactors with broad applications.

         <title>Controllable Zeolite AST Crystallization: Between Classical and Reversed Crystal Growth</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A truly reversed crystal growth mode in which the crystallization starts at the surface of a spherically amorphous aggregate and then proceeds towards its center is described. The fundamental function of the structure&#8208;directing agent (SDA) controlling the crystallization pathway has been uncovered. The crystallization pathway can be &#8220;switched&#8221; between classical and reversed crystal growth by tuning the concentration of the SDA. It follows the classical mechanism at a low ratio of SDA/framework elements, but turns to the reversed crystal growth at a high ratio. More information can be found in the Research Article by Q. Yue, M. Opanasenko and co&#8208;workers. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202200590).

Water directly takes part in the formation of H2 catalyzed by MOC&#8208;16@UiO&#8208;66, evidenced by a kinetic isotope effect, in addition to the proton delivery thanks to the hydrophilic nature of UiO&#8208;66. The porous structure of UiO&#8208;66 is essential for the permeation of sacrificial reagent to serve as two&#8208;electron donor, in sharp contrast as one&#8208;electron donor in nonporous CZIF matrix.







Abstract
Artificial light&#8208;driven splitting of water into hydrogen involves multiple links to emulate natural photosynthesis, including light absorption, electron or energy transfer, surface catalysis et&#8197;al., in which, the mass transportation of sacrificial reagent and reactant is always ignored. Metal&#8208;organic cage (MOC) of Pd6Ru8 (MOC&#8208;16), assembling multiple photosensitive Ru and catalytic Pd concomitant with directional electron transfer between them, provides an opportunity to explore the environmental effects from the view point of mass transportation without disturbance of other links. Zr&#8208;MOF of UiO&#8208;66 is used as a matrix to heterogenize MOC&#8208;16 and a series of characterizations are carried out to unravel the composition, structure and optical properties. The intact MOC&#8208;16 remains with long&#8208;term photo&#8208;stability and the outstanding photocatalytic activity is obtained by virtue of a long&#8208;lived triplet state. Three matrixes of ZIF&#8208;8, ZIF&#8208;8 derived carbonate CZIF, and UiO&#8208;66 are intercompared for mass transfer based on wettability and porous structure. Water molecule directly takes part in the formation of H2 catalyzed by MOC&#8208;16@UiO&#8208;66, evidenced by a kinetic isotope effect, in addition to the proton delivery thanks to the hydrophilic nature of UiO&#8208;66. The porous structure of UiO&#8208;66 is essential for the permeation of sacrificial reagent to serve as two&#8208;electron donor, in sharp contrast as one&#8208;electron donor in nonporous CZIF matrix. These results highlight the importance of microenviroment surrounding molecular catalysts in view of the heterogenization of molecular catalysts, meanwhile, providing a prominent guidance on how to choose 3D support to bridge the homogenous and heterogenous system.

         <title>Hierarchically Porous Poly(ionic liquid) &#8211; Organic Cage Composite Membrane for Efficient Iodine Capture</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hierarchically micro&#8208;meso&#8208;macroporous poly(ionic liquid)&#8208;organic cage composite membrane with a gradient content distribution of organic cage crystals throughout the membrane was prepared. The composite membrane allows for rapid diffusion of iodine vapor, leading to an outstanding iodine uptake capacity. Furthermore, such porous membrane can be processed into membrane modules for trace iodine vapor capture and interception, revealing its great potential for practical application.







Abstract
The effective capture of iodine with high volatility and poisonousness is significant for reprocessing the spent nuclear fuel. In this article, we report a hierarchically porous poly(ionic liquid)&#8208;organic cage composite membrane (PIL@CC3) possessing a gradient content distribution of CC3 cage crystals throughout the membrane to capture iodine vapor. The introduction of microporous CC3 can significantly enhance the uptake capacity of iodine up to 980&#8197;mg&#8201;g&#8722;1, which is superior to that of a pristine PIL membrane carrying large meso&#8208; and macropores (99&#8197;mg&#8201;g&#8722;1), and CC3 crystalline powder (662&#8197;mg&#8201;g&#8722;1). Such enhanced performance benefits from the micro&#8208;meso&#8208;macroporous structure of the PIL@CC3 membrane in which the large meso&#8208; and macropores facilitate the mass transfer of iodine molecules from the external environment into the surface of the CC3 crystal, followed by diffusion of iodine molecules from the CC3 surface into the interior and exterior pores of the CC3 crystal. In addition, the asymmetric distribution of CC3 crystals across the PIL@CC3 membrane also displays its advantage in intercepting trace iodine, revealing its great potential for practical application. This study provides an idea for constructing hierarchically porous membrane composites for the removal of toxic vapors.

         <title>Two&#8208;Step Dielectric Responsive Organic&#8208;Inorganic Hybrid Material with Mid&#8208;Band Light Emission</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new hybrid organic&#8208;inorganic perovskite (HOIP) with two&#8208;step dielectric response, meanwhile, it emits charming green light under 365&#8197;nm lamp (Photoluminescence quantum yield is 9.52&#8201;%). The outstanding two&#8208;step dielectric response and luminescence characteristics of this compound might pave the way for the application of dielectric and ferroelectric functional materials in temperature sensors and mechanical switches.







Abstract
Hybrid organic&#8208;inorganic perovskite (HOIP) have received tremendous scientific attention because of the phase transition and photovoltaic properties. However, achieving the special perovskite structure with both two&#8208;step dielectric response and luminescence characteristics is rarely reported. Herein, we report an organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid perovskite, [(BA)2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;PbI4] (Compound 1, BA=n&#8208;butylamine) by introducing flexible organic cations (HBA+), with direct mid&#8208;band gap as 2.28&#8197;eV. Interestingly, this material exhibits two&#8208;step reversible dielectric response at 350&#8197;K and 460&#8197;K (in heating process), respectively. Besides, the photoluminescence was found: it emits charming green light under 365&#8197;nm lamp (Photoluminescence quantum yield is 9.52&#8201;%). The outstanding two&#8208;step dielectric response and luminescence characteristics of this compound might pave the way for the application of dielectric and ferroelectric functional materials in temperature sensors and mechanical switches.

         <title>Pressure effects on 3dn (n = 4, 9) insulating compounds: Long axis switch in Na3MnF6 not due to the Jahn&#8208;Teller effect</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The pressure&#8208;induced switch of the long axis of MnF  6  3&#8208;  units in the monoclinic Na  3  MnF  6  compound and Mn  3+  &#8208;doped Na  3  FeF  6  is explored with the help of first principles calculations. Although the switch phenomenon is usually related to the Jahn&#8208;Teller effect, we show that, due to symmetry reasons, it can hardly take place in 3d  n  (n = 4, 9) systems displaying a static Jahn&#8208;Teller effect. By contrast , we prove that in Na  3  MnF  6  the switch arises from the anisotropic response of the low symmetry lattice to hydrostatic pressure. Indeed, while the long axis of a MnF  6  3&#8208;  unit at ambient pressure corresponds to the Mn  3+  &#8208;F  3  &#8208;  direction , close to the crystal c axis , at 2.79 GPa the c axis is reduced by 0.29 &#197; while b is unmodified . This fact is shown to force a change of the HOMO wavefunction favoring that the long axis becomes the Mn  3+  &#8208;F  2  &#8208;  direction, not far from crystal b axis, after the subsequent relaxation process. The origin of the different d&#8208;d transitions observed for Na  3  MnF  6  and CrF  2  at ambient pressure is also discussed together with changes induced by pressure in Na  3  MnF  6  . The present work opens a window for understanding the pressure effects upon low symmetry insulating compounds containing d  4  or d  9  ions.</dc:description>

         <title>An Introduction to the Combustion of Carbon Materials</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Combustion is arguably as old as homo sapiens ability to observe and use fire. Despite the long tradition of using carbon combustion for energy production, this reaction is still not fully understood. This can be related to several facts that are intertwined and complicate the investigation, such as the large variety of possible carbon structures, the actual surface structure, porosity, the solid&#8208;gas nature of this reaction, diffusion limitation and fundamental reaction steps. In this review, a brief history of carbon combustion science is given, followed by a detailed discussion of the most important aspects of carbon combustion. Special attention is given to limitations  e.g.  diffusion. In carbon combustion, kinetic control can rarely be observed. The literature of the fundamental reaction steps actually occurring on the carbon framework is reviewed and it becomes apparent that the reaction is occurring primarily on defects on the basal plane. Thus, the reaction between oxygen and carbon may be used as an analytical tool to provide further insights into novel materials,  e.g.  synthetic carbon materials, fibres and graphene type materials. Mastering the combustion reaction in all its complexity may prove to be very valuable in the future.</dc:description>

         <title>Reductive Elimination at Pb(II) Center of an (Amino)plumbylene&#8208;Substituted Phosphaketene: New Pathway for Phosphinidene Synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A stable (amino)plumbylene&#8208;substituted phosphaketene was synthesized by the successive reactions of PbCl2 with two anionic reagents (lithiated iminophoshine and NaPCO). Of particular interest, its thermal evolution, at 80 &#176;C, leads to the transient formation of corresponding amino&#8208; and phosphanylidene&#8208;phosphaketenes, via a reductive elimination at Pb(II)&#160;center forming new N&#8208;P and P&#8208;P bonds. Further evolution of&#160; the (amino)phosphaketene gives a new cyclic (amino)phosphanylidene phosphorane , which shows a unique reactivity as a posphinidene. This result provides a new synthetic route to phosphinidenes, extending and facilitating further their access.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>A series of rhodium and iridium complexes with a N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) ligand decorated with a perylene&#8208;di&#8208;imide&#8208;pyrene moiety are described. Electrochemical studies reveal that the complexes can undergo two successive one&#8208;electron reduction events, associated to the reduction of the PDI moiety attached to the NHC ligand. The reduction of the ligand produces a significant increase on its electron&#8208;donating character, as observed from the infrared spectroelectrochemical studies. The rhodium complex was tested in the [3+2] cycloaddition of diphenylcyclopropenone and methylphenylacetylene, where it displayed a redox&#8208;switchable behavior. The neutral complex showed moderate activity, which was suppressed when the catalyst was reduced.</dc:description>

         <title>An Expedient Method for the Umpolung Coupling of Enols with Heteronucleophiles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this paper, we present an unprecedented and general umpolung protocol that allows the functionalization of silyl enol ethers and of 1,3&#8208;dicarbonyl compounds with a large range of heteroatomic nucleophiles, including carboxylic acids, alcohols, primary and secondary amines, azide, thiols, and also anionic carbamates derived from CO  2  . The scope of the reaction also extends to carbon&#8208;based nucleophiles. The reaction relies on the use of 1&#8208;bromo&#8208;3,3&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;1,3&#8208;dihydro&#8208;1&#955;  3  [  d  ][1,2]iodaoxole, which provides a key a&#8208;brominated carbonyl intermediate. The reaction mechanism has been studied experimentaly and by DFT, and we propose formation of an unusual enolonium intermediate with a halogen&#8208;bonded bromide.</dc:description>

         <title>Selective [2+1+1] Fragmentation of P4 by heteroleptic Metallasilylenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Small molecule activation by low&#8208;valent main group element compounds is of general interest. We here report the synthesis and characterization (1H, 13C, 29Si NMR, IR, sc&#8208;XRD) of heteroleptic metallasilylenes L1(Cl)MSiL2 (M = Al 1, Ga 2, L1 = HC[C(Me)NDipp]2, Dipp = 2,6&#8208; i Pr2C6H3; L2 = PhC(N t Bu)2). Their electronic nature was analyzed by quantum chemical calculations, while their promising potential in small molecule activation is demonstrated in reactions with P4, which occurred with unprecedented [2+1+1] fragmentation of the P4 tetrahedron and formation of L1(Cl)MPSi(L2)PPSi(L2)PM(Cl)L1 (M = Al 3, Ga 4).</dc:description>

         <title>Recent Progress of Small&#8208;Molecule Ratiometric Fluorescent Probes for Peroxynitrite in Biological Systems</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Small&#8208;molecule ratiometric fluorescent probes for ONOO&#8722; are summarized. The chemical structures, response mechanisms, and bioapplications of all the probes are presented. Further challenges and instructions for new ONOO&#8722;&#8208;responsive ratiometric fluorescent probes are also provided.







Abstract
Peroxynitrite (ONOO&#8722;) as a major reactive oxygen species plays important roles in cellular signal transduction and homeostatic regulation. Precise detection of ONOO&#8722; in biological systems is vital for exploring its physiological and pathological function. Among numerous detection methods, fluorescence imaging technology using fluorescent probes offers some advantages, including simple operation, high sensitivity and selectivity, as well as real&#8208;time and nondestructive detection. In particular, ratiometric fluorescent probes, in which the built&#8208;in calibration of the two emission bands prevents interference from the biological environment, have been extensively employed to monitor the fluctuation of bioactive species. In this review, we will discuss small&#8208;molecule ratiometric fluorescent probes for ONOO&#8722; in live cells or in&#8197;vivo, which involves chemical structures, response mechanisms, and biological applications. Moreover, the challenges and future prospects of ONOO&#8722;&#8208;responsive ratiometric fluorescent probe are also proposed.

A consolidated and detailed study of a library of N&#8208;doped ionic AIEgens along with thorough photophysical, computational, and crystallographic analysis has been conducted to uncover the prominent role of anion&#8208;&#960; interactions, &#960;&#8208;&#960; interactions, and other non&#8208;covalent interactions, in inhibiting the undesired ACQ effect.







Abstract
Recently, the concept of anion&#8208;&#960;+ interactions has witnessed unique applications in the field of AIEgen development. In this contribution, we disclose a consolidated study of a library of N&#8208;doped ionic AIEgens accessed through silver&#8208;mediated cyclization of pyridino&#8208;alkynes. A thorough photophysical, computational and crystallographic study has been conducted to rationalize the observed substituent&#8208; and counterion&#8208;dependent fluorescence properties of these luminogens. We further elucidate the prominent role of anion&#8208;&#960;+ interactions, &#960;+&#8208;&#960;+ interactions and other non&#8208;covalent interactions, in inhibiting the undesired ACQ effect. Finally, we have also demonstrated the application of selected AIEgens for imaging of mitochondria in live cells.

         <dc:description>A family of novel halogen bonding (XB) and hydrogen bonding (HB) heteroditopic [2]rotaxane host systems constructed by&#160; active metal template (AMT) methodology, were studied for their ability to cooperatively recognise lithium halide (LiX) ion&#8208;pairs.  1  H NMR ion&#8208;pair titration experiments in CD  3  CN:CDCl  3  solvent mixtures revealed a notable &#8220;switch&#8208;on&#8220; of halide anion binding in the presence of a co&#8208;bound lithium cation, with rotaxane hosts demonstrating selectivity for LiBr over LiI. The strength of halide binding was shown to greatly increase with increasing number of halogen bond donors integrated into the interlocked cavity, where an all&#8208;XB rotaxane was found to be the most potent host for LiBr. DFT calculations corroborated these findings, determining the mode of LiX ion&#8208;pair binding. Notably, ion&#8208;pair binding was not observed with the corresponding XB/HB macrocycles alone, highlighting the cooperative, heteroditopic, rotaxane axle&#8208;macrocycle component mechanical bond effect as an efficient strategy for ion&#8208;pair recognition in general.</dc:description>

         <title>2&#8208;Aminoalkylgold Complexes: The Putative Intermediate in Au&#8208;Catalyzed Hydroamination of Alkenes Does Not Protodemetalate</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
2&#8208;Aminoalkylgold(I) complexes, the putative intermediates of Au(I)&#8208;catalyzed hydroamination of alkenes, were isolated and characterized. Upon titration with different acids, the complexes underwent elimination to alkenes. This behavior was further observed in the gas phase following protonation. Together with CID experiments, the results indicate that the origin of the poor reactivity of alkenes in hydroamination reactions, lies in the uncompetitive protodeauration step.







Abstract
Au&#8208;catalyzed hydroamination proceeds well for alkynes but not alkenes. We report gas&#8208;phase binding energies of alkenes and alkynes to a cationic Au center, which indicate that differences in binding are not the origin of the disparate chemical behavior. We further report the synthesis and characterization of 2&#8208;aminoalkylgold complexes, which would be the intermediates in a hypothetical Au&#8208;catalyzed hydroamination of styrene. The reactivity of the well&#8208;characterized and isolable complexes reveals that protonation or alkylation of the 2&#8208;aminoalkylgold complexes results in amine elimination in solution, and in the gas phase, indicating that the failure of Au&#8208;catalyzed alkene hydroamination derives from a non&#8208;competitive protodeauration step. We analyze possible transition states for the protodeauration, and identify an insufficiently strong Au&#8208;proton interaction as the reason that the transition states lie too high in energy to compete.

         <title>Synthesis and Biological Evaluation of Flavonoid&#8208;Cinnamic Acid Amide Hybrids with Distinct Activity against Neurodegeneration in Vitro and in Vivo</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Flavonoid&#8208;cinnamic acid amides were synthesized and evaluated in phenotypic screening assays related to neurodegeneration. The compounds prevent cell death in models of oxidative stress and energy breakdown. The introduction of an amide yielded higher stability towards hydrolysis and altering the flavonoid core structure showed that the quercetin&#8208;cinnamic acid amide hybrid was the most potent compound, and its in&#8197;vitro properties could be translated into high activity in an in&#8197;vivo AD mouse model.







Abstract
Flavonoids are polyphenolic natural products and have shown significant potential as disease&#8208;modifying agents against neurodegenerative disorders like Alzheimer's disease (AD), with activities even in&#8197;vivo. Hybridization of the natural products taxifolin and silibinin with cinnamic acid led to an overadditive effect of these compounds in several phenotypic screening assays related to neurodegeneration and AD. Therefore, we have exchanged the flavonoid part of the hybrids with different flavonoids, which show higher efficacy than taxifolin or silibinin, to improve the activity of the respective hybrids. Chemical connection between the flavonoid and cinnamic acid was realized by an amide instead of a labile ester bond to improve stability towards hydrolysis. To investigate the influence of a double bond at the C&#8208;ring of the flavonoid, the dehydro analogues of the respective hybrids were also synthesized. All compounds obtained show neuroprotection against oxytosis, ferroptosis and ATP&#8208;depletion, respectively, in the murine hippocampal cell line HT22. Interestingly, the taxifolin and the quercetin derivatives are the most active compounds, whereby the quercetin derivate shows even more pronounced activity than the taxifolin one in all assays applied. As aimed for, no hydrolysis product was found in cellular uptake experiments after 4&#8197;h whereas different metabolites were detected. Furthermore, the quercetin&#8208;cinnamic acid amide showed pronounced activity in an in&#8197;vivo AD mouse model at a remarkably low dose of 0.3&#8197;mg/kg.

Enantiomerically pure anti N&#8208;&#946;&#8208;aryl&#8208;&#946;&#8208;silyloxy&#8208;&#945;&#8208;azidoacetyl thioimides are efficiently prepared through a direct aldol reaction from N&#8208;azidoacetyl&#8208;1,3&#8208;thiazolidine&#8208;2&#8208;thione and a wide array of aromatic aldehydes catalyzed by 2&#8211;6&#8197;mol% [Tol&#8208;BINAP]Ni(II) complexes. The straightforward removal of the heterocyclic scaffold facilitates their conversion into a variety of chiral intermediates. Indeed, treatment of the resultant thioimides with &#945;&#8208;amino ester hydrochlorides gives access to the corresponding dipeptides as well as the appropriate manipulation of the azido group yields peptidic fragments of kasumigamide and atrutamycin.







Abstract
A direct and asymmetric triisopropylsilyltrifluoromethanesulfonate (TIPSOTf) mediated aldol reaction of N&#8208;azidoacetyl&#8208;1,3&#8208;thiazolidine&#8208;2&#8208;thione with aromatic aldehydes catalyzed by a chiral nickel(II)&#8208;Tol&#8208;BINAP complex has been developed (BINAP=2,2&#8217;&#8208;bis(diphenylphosphino)&#8208;1,1&#8217;&#8208;binaphthyl). The catalytic protocol gives the corresponding anti &#945;&#8208;azido&#8208;&#946;&#8208;silyloxy adducts with outstanding stereocontrol and in high yields. Theoretical calculations account for the stereochemical outcome of the reaction and lay the foundations for a mechanistic model. In turn, the easy removal of the thiazolidinethione yields a wide array of enantiomerically pure derivatives in a straightforward and efficient manner. Such a noteworthy character of the heterocyclic scaffold together with the appropriate manipulation of the azido group open a new route to the synthesis of di&#8208; and tripeptide blocks containing a &#946;&#8208;aryl&#8208;&#946;&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;&#945;&#8208;amino acid.

2,3&#8208;Disubstituted fluorene platforms for the construction of high&#8208;efficiency host materials for green phosphorescent organic light&#8208;emitting diodes.







Abstract
Fluorene is a classic three&#8208;membered polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon, and it has been widely used in optoelectronic devices. Here we explore a simple and efficient strategy for the derivatization at the 2&#8208; and 3&#8208; positions in fluorene unit. By introducing different types of substituents, we design two pairs of 2,3&#8208;disubstituted fluorene isomers and use them as host materials for phosphorescent organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (PHOLEDs). The green PHOLEDs hosted by these fluorene derivatives realize high external quantum efficiencies (EQE) over 20&#8201;% with low efficiency roll&#8208;off. Particularly, the devices hosted by 2TRz3TPA and 2TPA3TRz achieve nearly 24&#8201;% EQE and 104&#8197;lm&#8201;W&#8722;1 power efficiency. These results clearly demonstrate that the 2,3&#8208;disubstituted fluorene platforms are potentially useful for constructing host materials.

         <title>Late&#8208;Stage Installation of Dehydroamino Acid Motifs into Peptides Enabled by an N&#8208;Chloropeptide Strategy</title>

         <dc:description>
We report and demonstrate the practical utility of an N&#8208;chloropeptide strategy for the rapid construction of &#916;AA&#8208;containing peptides. The quinuclidine (ABCO)&#8208;catalyzed N&#8208;chlorination of peptide bonds and the subsequent &#946;&#8208;elimination of N&#8208;chloroamide efficiently provides &#916;AA&#8208;containing peptides in high yield. The strategy enables the late&#8208;stage installation of &#916;AA motifs into already&#8208;constructed oligopeptides, including a macrocyclic peptide.







Abstract
Conventional methods for the construction of dehydroamino acids (&#916;AAs), which are a unique class of non&#8208;proteinogenic amino acids, require the pre&#8208;installation of special amino acids. Herein, we report and demonstrate the practical utility of an N&#8208;chloropeptide strategy for the rapid construction of &#916;AA&#8208;containing peptides. The electrophilic N&#8208;chlorination of peptide bonds is drastically accelerated by a catalytic amount of quinuclidine (ABCO), and the subsequent &#946;&#8208;elimination of N&#8208;chloroamide efficiently provides &#916;AA&#8208;containing peptides in high yield. The strategy enables, for the first time, the construction of a wide variety of &#916;AA residues in peptides without any pre&#8208;functionalized side chains and facilitates the late&#8208;stage installation of &#916;AA motifs into already&#8208;constructed oligopeptides, including a medicinally important macrocyclic peptide.

         <title>Sequential Nucleophilic Substitution of Phosphorus Trichloride with Alcohols in a Continuous&#8208;Flow Reactor and Consideration of a Mechanism for Reduced Over&#8208;reaction through the Addition of Imidazole</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Micro&#8208;flow technology enables a sequential nucleophilic substitution of highly electrophilic and inexpensive phosphorus trichloride with three different alcohols including ones that contain acid&#8208; and/or basic&#8208;labile functionalities, and various asymmetric phosphotriesters were synthesized in good&#8208;to&#8208;high yields (53&#8211;83&#8201;%). Mechanistic study suggested that Berry pseudorotation was a rate&#8208;limiting step in the nucleophilic substitution of phosphorus trichloride with alcohol.







Abstract
We demonstrate a sequential nucleophilic substitution of highly electrophilic and inexpensive phosphorus trichloride with three different alcohols in a continuous&#8208;flow reactor. A variety of alcohols including ones that contained acid&#8208; and/or basic&#8208;labile functionalities were rapidly reacted. A over nucleophilic substitution that occurred during reaction of the second alcohol was suppressed by the addition of imidazole. Density functional theory calculations of the sequential nucleophilic substitutions of alcohols were performed both with and without imidazole, and Berry pseudorotation was suggested as a rate&#8208;limiting step in both cases. Herein, we discuss the reasons for the decreased selectivity in the absence of imidazole as well as those for improved selectivity in the presence of imidazole during the second nucleophilic substitution.

     alt="Sequential Nucleophilic Substitution of Phosphorus Trichloride with Alcohols in a Continuous-Flow Reactor and Consideration of a Mechanism for Reduced Over-reaction through the Addition of Imidazole"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Micro-flow technology&lt;/b&gt; enables a sequential nucleophilic substitution of highly electrophilic and inexpensive phosphorus trichloride with three different alcohols including ones that contain acid- and/or basic-labile functionalities, and various asymmetric phosphotriesters were synthesized in good-to-high yields (53&#8211;83&#8201;%). Mechanistic study suggested that Berry pseudorotation was a rate-limiting step in the nucleophilic substitution of phosphorus trichloride with alcohol.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We demonstrate a sequential nucleophilic substitution of highly electrophilic and inexpensive phosphorus trichloride with three different alcohols in a continuous-flow reactor. A variety of alcohols including ones that contained acid- and/or basic-labile functionalities were rapidly reacted. A over nucleophilic substitution that occurred during reaction of the second alcohol was suppressed by the addition of imidazole. Density functional theory calculations of the sequential nucleophilic substitutions of alcohols were performed both with and without imidazole, and Berry pseudorotation was suggested as a rate-limiting step in both cases. Herein, we discuss the reasons for the decreased selectivity in the absence of imidazole as well as those for improved selectivity in the presence of imidazole during the second nucleophilic substitution.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Planarized Phenyldithienylboranes: Effects of the Bridging Moieties and &#960;&#8208;Extension on the Photophysical Properties and Lewis Acidity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Phenyldithienylboranes planarized with (CH3)2C&#8208; or CH2&#8208;bridges, which furnish S&#8208;&#8201;&#8208;&#8201;&#8208;S intramolecular interaction, are produced as a core unit for boron&#8208;based &#960;&#8208;electron materials. Slight difference in the bridging moieties has impacts on the packing structures and relaxation behavior in the excited state. &#960;&#8208;Extension at the thiophene rings enables tuning photophysical properties and Lewis acidity of the boron center.







Abstract
Two kinds of planarized phenyldithienylboranes, which contain (CH3)2C&#8208; or CH2&#8208;bridging moieties, were synthesized. The difference of the bridging moieties affects their packing structures and photophysical properties. In particular, the (CH3)2C&#8208;bridged derivative exhibits a large Stokes shift, unusual for such planarized compounds, that results from a large structural relaxation in the excited state. A series of &#960;&#8208;extended derivatives was synthesized, among which a p&#8208;(diphenylamino)phenyl&#8208;substituted derivative shows large solvatochromism in the fluorescence spectra, while maintaining high quantum yields even in polar solvents. The Lewis acidity of the phenyldithienylborane derivatives was also assessed by titration with pyridine. The Lewis acidity of the boron center is affected not only by the difference in the steric bulk of the bridging moieties, but also by the electronic effect of the substituents introduced at remote positions relative to the boron atom. These results demonstrate the characteristic features of planarized phenyldithienylboranes as building blocks for boron&#8208;based &#960;&#8208;electron materials.

         <title>Solid&#8208;Phase Peptide Modification via Deaminative Photochemical Csp3&#8208;Csp3 Bond Formation Using Katritzky Salts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A method was developed to convert lysine residues on peptides to Katritzky salts directly on solid support. These salts can then be used for a photochemical deaminative Csp3&#8208;Csp3 bond forming Giese reaction. The applicability of the reaction was demonstrated with various resins, all proteinogenic amino acids, and a variety of substrates.







Abstract
Introduction of unnatural amino acids can significantly improve the binding affinity and stability of peptides. Commercial availability of such amino acids is limited, and their synthesis is a long and tedious process. We here describe a method that allows the functionalization of peptides directly on solid&#8208;support by converting lysine residues to Katritzky salts, and subjecting them to a photochemical Giese reaction under mild reaction conditions. The method avoids the need for amino acid synthesis and instead offers a late&#8208;stage modification route for rapid peptide diversification. While numerous modification approaches at the lysine amine have been described, this work provides the first example of deaminative functionalization of peptides at lysine. The two&#8208;step protocol is compatible with various substrates, lysine analogues, resins, and all proteinogenic amino acids. Finally, by leveraging solid&#8208;phase modification, this protocol facilitates the functionalization of longer peptides as was demonstrated using biologically relevant peptides of up to 15 amino acids.

Organic semiconductors: Chlorine&#8208;substituted N&#8208;heteroacene analogues are synthesized and the field&#8208;effect transistors based on these compounds show high electron&#8208;transport mobility of up to 0.04&#8197;cm2&#8197;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1.







Abstract
High performance solution processable n&#8208;type organic semiconductor is an essential element to realize low&#8208;cost, all organic and flexible composite logic circuits. In the design of n&#8208;type semiconducting materials, tuning the LUMO level of compounds is a key point. As a strong electron withdrawing unit, the introduction of chlorine atom into the chemical structure can increase the electron affinity of the material and reduce the LUMO energy level. Here, a series chlorine substituted N&#8208;heteroacene analogues of 6,7,8,9&#8208;tetrachloro&#8208;4,11&#8208;bis(4&#8208;((2&#8208;ethylhexyl)oxy)phenyl)&#8208;[1,2,5]thiadiazolo[3,4&#8208;b]phenazine (O4Cl), 6,7,8,9&#8208;tetrachloro&#8208;4,11&#8208;bis(4&#8208;((2&#8208;ethylhexyl)thio)phenyl)&#8208;[1,2,5]thiadiazolo[3,4&#8208;b]phenazine (S4Cl), 1,2,3,4,8,9,10,11&#8208;octachloro&#8208;6,13&#8208;bis(4&#8208;((2&#8208;ethylhexyl)oxy)phenyl)quinoxalino[2,3&#8208;b]phenazine (8Cl) and 12Cl have been synthesized and characterized. Solution&#8208;processed organic field&#8208;effect transistors (OFETs) based on these four compounds exhibit good electron mobilities of 0.04&#8197;cm2&#8197;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1, 0.01&#8197;cm2&#8197;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1, 2&#215;10&#8722;3&#8197;cm2&#8197;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1 and 3&#215;10&#8722;3&#8197;cm2&#8197;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1, respectively, under ambient conditions. The results suggest that these chlorine substituted &#960;&#8208;conjugated N&#8208;heteroacene analogues are promising n&#8208;type semiconductors in OFET applications.

         <title>The Effects of Ring Strain on Cyclic Tetraaryl[5]cumulenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of cyclic tetraaryl[5]cumulenes has been synthesized. In the smallest of the cycles, the bond angles of the cumulene are distorted to as little as 172&#8211;174&#176; based on crystallographic and computational analyses. Spectroscopic and physical properties as a function of ring size show small but consistent trends as ring strain increases.







Abstract
Cyclic tetraaryl[5]cumulenes (1&#8201;a&#8211;f) have been synthesized and studied as a function of increasing ring strain. The magnitude of ring strain is approximated by the extent of bending of the cumulenic core as assessed by a combination of X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis and DFT calculations. Trends are observed in 13C NMR, UV&#8208;vis, and Raman spectra associated with ring strain, but the effects are small. In particular, the experimental HOMO&#8208;LUMO gap is not appreciably affected by bending of the [5]cumulene framework from ca. 174&#176; (&#955;max=504&#8197;nm) in 1&#8201;a to ca. 178&#176; (&#955;max=494&#8197;nm) in 1&#8201;f.

         <title>Chiral Hemilabile P,N&#8208;Ligand&#8208;Assisted Gold Redox Catalysis for Enantioselective Alkene Aminoarylation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enantioselective gold redox catalysis was achieved with newly designed chiral hemilabile P,N ligands (shown as a heavy load in the truck). We reveal a new strategy through a two&#8208;step sequence: A)&#8197;Apply a chiral hemilabile P,N ligand at the AuI stage to promote AuI oxidative addition toward aryl iodide; B)&#8197;nucleophilic addition to a chiral AuIII intermediate formed in&#8197;situ as a stereodetermining step (SDS). This strategy presents a new opportunity to enrich the versatile reactivity of gold catalysis in an enantioselective fashion. More information can be found in the Research Article by M. Li, X. Shi and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202201018).

         <title>Ligand&#8208;Enabled [3+2] Annulation of Aromatic Acids with Maleimides by C(sp3)&#8722;H and C(sp2)&#8722;H Bond Activation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A ligand&#8208;enabled palladium&#8208;catalyzed [3+2] annulation of substituted aromatic carboxylic acids with maleimides without incorporating any exogenous directing group has been developed. The annulation reaction proceeds via double C&#8722;H bond activation such as C(sp3)&#8722;H and C(sp2)&#8722;H bond activation. An external ligand (MPAA) is crucial for the success of the present protocol. A plausible reaction mechanism has been proposed to account for the present [3+2] cyclization reaction.







Abstract
A palladium&#8208;catalyzed [3+2] annulation of substituted benzoic acids with maleimides leading to tricyclic heterocyclic molecules having a free carboxylic group in a high atom&#8208; and step&#8208;economical manner is described. The reaction proceeds via a dual C&#8722;H bond activation such as C(sp3)&#8722;H at the benzylic position and C(sp2)&#8722;H bond activation at the meta position of substituted aromatics. An external ligand (MPAA) is crucial for the success of present protocol. Further, the decarboxylation and esterification of the free carboxylic acid group of observed products were carried out.

         <title>A Shared Prebiotic Formation of Neopterins and Guanine Nucleosides from Pyrimidine Bases</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The plausible prebiotic availability of 6&#8208;aminopyrimidines makes the formation of purine nucleosides by Traube reaction an interesting pathway to explore. However, the formation of a pterin ring is the preferred outcome relative to purine nucleoside synthesis, which requires a high sugar excess to be significant. We show that a urea&#8208;based solvent is a suitable medium for the formylation, synthesis of purine/pterin ring and subsequent phosphorylation.







Abstract
The prebiotic origins of biopolymers and metabolic co&#8208;factors are key questions in Origins of Life studies. In a simple warm&#8208;little&#8208;pond model, using a drying phase to produce a urea&#8208;enriched solution, we present a prebiotic synthetic path for the simultaneous formation of neopterins and tetrahydroneopterins, along with purine nucleosides. We show that, in the presence of ribose and in a formylating environment consisting of urea, ammonium formate, and water (UAFW), the formation of neopterins from pyrimidine precursors is robust, while the simultaneous formation of guanosine requires a significantly higher ribose concentration. Furthermore, these reactions provide a tetrahydropterin&#8211;pterin redox pair. This model suggests a prebiotic link in the origin of purine nucleosides and pterin cofactors that provides a possible deep prebiotic temporal connection for the emergence of nucleic acids and metabolic cofactors.

         <title>Direct Participation of Solvent Molecules in the Formation of Supramolecular Polymers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Shape&#8208;matching between the peripheral hydrocarbon wedges and hydrocarbon solvent molecules regulates supramolecular polymerization and gelation. Such non&#8208;trivial solvent effect strongly evokes the possibility of direct participation of solvent molecules in the nucleation by shape&#8208;matching dependent van der Waals interaction and presence of a closely associates solvent shell around the supramolecular polymers similar to first layer of water molecules around the protein surface.







Abstract
This article reports supramolecular polymerization of two bis&#8208;amide functionalized naphthalene&#8208;diimide (NDI) building blocks (NDI&#8722;L and NDI&#8722;C) in two solvents, namely n&#8208;heptane (Hep) and methylcyclohexane (MCH). NDI&#8722;L and NDI&#8722;C differ only by the peripheral hydrocarbon wedges, consisting of linear C7 chains or cyclic methylcyclohexane rings, respectively. UV/Vis and FTIR spectroscopy studies reveal distinct internal order and H&#8208;bonding pattern for NDI&#8722;L and NDI&#8722;C aggregates irrespective of the solvent system, indicating the dominant role of the intrinsic packing parameters of the individual building block, possibly influenced by the peripheral steric crowding. However, NDI&#8722;L produces a significantly stronger gel in Hep compared to MCH as evident from the rheological and thermal properties. In contrast, NDI&#8722;C exhibits a clear preference for MCH, producing gel with moderate strength but in Hep it fails to produce 1D morphology or gelation. All&#8208;atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulation studies corroborate with the experimental observation and provide the rationale for the observed solvent&#8208;shape effect by revealing a quantitative estimate regarding the thermodynamics of self&#8208;assembly in these four combinations. Such clear&#8208;cut shape&#8208;matching effect (between the peripheral hydrocarbon wedge and the solvent system) unambiguously support a direct participation of the solvent molecules during supramolecular polymerization and presence of a closely&#8208;adhered solvent shell around the supramolecular polymers, similar to the first layer of water molecules around the protein surface. Solvent induced CD experiments support this hypothesis as induced CD band was observed only from a chiral co&#8208;solvent of matching shape. This is reconfirmed by the higher de&#8208;solvation temperature of the shape&#8208;matching NDI/solvent system combination compared to the shape mis&#8208;match combination in variable temperature UV/Vis experiments, revealing transformation to a different aggregate at higher temperatures rather than disassembly to the monomer for all four combinations.

In contrast, NDI&#8722;C exhibits a clear preference for MCH, producing gel with moderate strength but in Hep it fails to produce 1D morphology or gelation. All-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulation studies corroborate with the experimental observation and provide the rationale for the observed solvent-shape effect by revealing a quantitative estimate regarding the thermodynamics of self-assembly in these four combinations. Such clear-cut shape-matching effect (between the peripheral hydrocarbon wedge and the solvent system) unambiguously support a direct participation of the solvent molecules during supramolecular polymerization and presence of a closely-adhered solvent shell around the supramolecular polymers, similar to the first layer of water molecules around the protein surface. Solvent induced CD experiments support this hypothesis as induced CD band was observed only from a chiral co-solvent of matching shape. This is reconfirmed by the higher de-solvation temperature of the shape-matching NDI/solvent system combination compared to the shape mis-match combination in variable temperature UV/Vis experiments, revealing transformation to a different aggregate at higher temperatures rather than disassembly to the monomer for all four combinations.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

A new class of electrophilic monofluoromethylselenolation reagents, Se&#8208;(fluoromethyl) benzenesulfonoselenoates 2, has been developed, which can be facilely prepared in one step and enable the monofluoromethylselenolation for a wide range of nucleophiles including indole, 6&#8208;azaindole, pyrrole, thiophene, electron&#8208;rich arene, aryl boronic acid and alkyne under mild reaction conditions.







Abstract
A new class of electrophilic monofluoromethylselenolation reagents, Se&#8208;(fluoromethyl) benzenesulfonoselenoates, has been developed. They can be readily prepared from sodium benzenesulfinates, Se powder and ClCFH2 in one step under mild reaction conditions. Se&#8208;(fluoromethyl) benzenesulfonoselenoates are efficient electrophilic monofluoromethylselenolation reagents for a wide range of nucleophiles including indole, 6&#8208;azaindole, pyrrole, thiophene, electron&#8208;rich arene, aryl boronic acid and alkyne. The monofluoromethylselenolation approach features mild and environmentally friendly reaction conditions, good tolerance of various functional groups, and broad substrate scope.

         <title>Luminescent Organic&#8208;Inorganic Hybrid Metal Halides: An Emerging Class of Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Materials</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid metal halides (OIMHs) are ideal as luminescent materials for stimuli&#8208;responsive technology due to their soft crystal lattice and high chemical activity. In this review, the stimuli&#8208;responsive behaviors of luminescent OIMHs based on Sb3+, Bi3+, Pb2+, Mn2+ and so on under different stimuli, including contact, pressure, mechanical force, light, heat, and gas molecules, as well as the applications of the stimuli&#8208;responsive behaviors are summarized.







Abstract
Luminescent organic&#8208;inorganic metal halides (OIMHs) are well known as a new materials family in recent years. Novel materials and applications of luminescent OIMHs have been explored by changing either the organic component or the metal halide species. Thereinto, the stimuli&#8208;responsive (SR) phenomena in OIMHs have drawn much attention recently, for not only their attractive application potential but also the helpfulness in understanding the stability of OIMHs to the external environment. Herein, the luminescent OIMHs that are sensitive to external stimuli including contact, pressure, mechanical grinding, light, heat, and gas molecules, are reviewed, with an emphasis on analyses of the structural change during the SR process. The applications of SR luminescent OIMHs in widespread fields, including gas sensing, information encryption, and rewritable luminescent paper are summarized. Finally, the challenges that deserve to be further explored in this research field are discussed, which provides certain guidance for the future study of SR luminescent OIMHs.

         <title>&#960;&#8208;Conjugated Copper Phthalocyanine Nanoparticles as Highly Sensitive Sensor for Colorimetric Detection of Biomarkers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Copper phthalocyanine&#8208;based conjugated polymer nanoparticles (Cu&#8208;PcCP NPs) have been successfully synthesized and applied to detect various biomarkers. The colorimetric results of Cu&#8208;PcCP NPs demonstrate their excellent peroxidase&#8208;like detecting activity, substrate selectivity and catalytic stability compared to most of the reported enzyme&#8208;like nanomaterial&#8208;based colorimetric biosensors. Cu&#8208;PcCP NPs not only overcome the current limitation of polymeric material&#8208;based sensors but also provide a new direction for designing next&#8208;generation enzyme&#8208;like nanomaterial&#8208;based colorimetric biosensors.







Abstract
Though numerous nanomaterials with enzyme&#8208;like activities have been utilized as probes and sensors for detecting biological molecules, it is still challenging to construct highly sensitive detectors for biomarkers using polymeric materials. Benefiting from the &#960;&#8208;d delocalization e&#64256;ect of electrons, excellent metal&#8208;chelating property, high electron transferability, and good chemical stability of &#960;&#8208;conjugated phthalocyanine, the design of the copper phthalocyanine&#8208;based conjugated polymer nanoparticles (Cu&#8208;PcCP NPs) as a colorimetric sensor for a variety of biomarkers is reported. The Cu&#8208;PcCP NPs are synthesized through a simple microwave&#8208;assisted polymerization, and their chemical structures are thoroughly characterized. The colorimetric results of Cu&#8208;PcCP NPs demonstrate excellent peroxidase&#8208;like detecting activity and also great substrate selectivity than most of the reported Cu&#8208;based nanomaterials. The Cu&#8208;PcCP NPs can achieve a detection limit of 4.88&#8197;&#956;M for the H2O2, 4.27&#8197;&#956;M for the L&#8208;cysteine, and 21.10&#8197;&#956;M for the glucose via a cascade catalytic system, which shows comparable detecting sensitivity as that of many earlier reported enzyme&#8208;like nanomaterials. Moreover, Cu&#8208;PcCP NPs present remarkable resistance to harsh conditions, including high temperature, low pH, and excessive salts. These highly specific &#960;&#8208;conjugated copper&#8208;phthalocyanine nanoparticles not only overcome the current limitation of polymeric material&#8208;based sensors but also provide a new direction for designing next&#8208;generation enzyme&#8208;like nanomaterial&#8208;based colorimetric biosensors.

         <title>Revealing the Influence of Diverse Secondary Metal Cations on Redox&#8208;Active Palladium Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Incorporation of secondary metal cations is an attractive strategy for tuning the properties of redox&#8208;active complexes, but work with heavier elements has received less attention than it deserves. Here, a series of complexes pairing palladium with a range of mono&#8208;, di&#8208;, and tri&#8208;valent secondary metal cations has been prepared and characterized. Electrochemical work reveals that electron transfer to the complexes is tuned by the incorporated redox&#8208;inactive metals, opening new opportunities for &#8220;designer&#8221; redox chemistry.







Abstract
Incorporation of redox&#8208;inactive metals into redox&#8208;active complexes and catalysts attracts attention for engendering new reactivity modes, but this strategy has not been extensively investigated beyond the first&#8208;row of the transition metals. Here, the isolation and characterization of the first series of heterobimetallic complexes of palladium with mono&#8208;, di&#8208;, and tri&#8208;valent redox&#8208;inactive metal ions are reported. A Reinhoudt&#8208;type heteroditopic ligand with a salen&#8208;derived [N2,O2] binding site for Pd and a crown&#8208;ether&#8208;derived [O6] site has been used to prepare isolable adducts of the Lewis acidic redox&#8208;inactive metal ions (Mn+). Comprehensive data from single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis reveal distinctive trends in the structural properties of the heterobimetallic species, including an uncommon dependence of the Pd&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;M distance on Lewis acidity. The reorganization energy associated with reduction of the heterobimetallic species is strongly modulated by Lewis acidity, with the slowest heterogeneous electron transfer kinetics associated with the strongest incorporated Lewis acids. This hitherto unexplored reorganization energy penalty for electron transfer contrasts with prior thermodynamic studies, revealing that kinetic parameters should be considered in studies of reactivity involving heterobimetallic species.

Machine learning accelerated photodynamics simulations reveal the excited&#8208;state mechanistic pathways of fluorobenzenes. The excited&#8208;state distortions promote the cis&#8208;trans isomerization of a &#960;C&#8208;C bond during the nonradiative decay. The distribution of surface hopping structures indicates the photochemical 4&#960;&#8208;electrocyclizations of fluorobenzene originate from the dynamical effects, where the instantaneous nuclear momentum drives the &#963;&#8208;bond formation in the Dewar&#8208;fluorobenzenes.Excited&#8208;State Distortions Promote the Photochemical 4&#960;&#8208;Electrocyclizations of Fluorobenzenes via Machine Learning Accelerated Photodynamics Simulations (Li and Lopez)







Abstract
Benzene fluorination increases chemoselectivities for Dewar&#8208;benzenes via 4&#960;&#8208;disrotatory electrocyclization. However, the origin of the chemo&#8208; and regioselectivities of fluorobenzenes remains unexplained because of the experimental limitations in resolving the excited&#8208;state structures on ultrafast timescales. The computational cost of multiconfigurational nonadiabatic molecular dynamics simulations is also currently cost&#8208;prohibitive. We now provide high&#8208;fidelity structural information and reaction outcome predictions with machine&#8208;learning&#8208;accelerated photodynamics simulations of a series of fluorobenzenes, C6F6&#8208;nHn, n=0&#8211;3, to study their S1&#8594;S0 decay in 4&#8197;ns. We trained neural networks with XMS&#8208;CASPT2(6,7)/aug&#8208;cc&#8208;pVDZ calculations, which reproduced the S1 absorption features with mean absolute errors of 0.04&#8197;eV (&lt;2&#8197;nm). The predicted nonradiative decay constants for C6F4H2, C6F6, C6F3H3, and C6F5H are 116, 60, 28, and 12&#8197;ps, respectively, in broad qualitative agreement with the experiments. Our calculations show that a pseudo Jahn&#8211;Teller distortion of fluorinated benzenes leads to an S1 local&#8208;minimum region that extends the excited&#8208;state lifetimes of fluorobenzenes. The pseudo Jahn&#8211;Teller distortions reduce when fluorination decreases. Our analysis of the S1 dynamics shows that the pseudo&#8208;Jahn&#8211;Teller distortions promote an excited&#8208;state cis&#8208;trans isomerization of a &#960;C&#8208;C bond. We characterized the surface hopping points from our NAMD simulations and identified instantaneous nuclear momentum as a factor that promotes the electrocyclizations.

         <title>Luminescent Pyrrole&#8208;Based Phosphaphenalene Gold Complexes: Versatile Anticancer Tools with Wide Applicability</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new gold standard: Phosphaphenalene gold(I) complexes are potent anticancer drugs. Subtle structural modifications of the phosphaphenalene core lead to remarkable photophysical properties and enhance the activity of the gold complexes against cancer. In particular, pyrrole&#8208;based phosphaphenalene derivatives exhibit high efficacy towards 14 different brain cancer cell lines including glioblastomas, brain metastases, meningiomas, IDH&#8208;mutant gliomas and head and neck cancers, reaching IC50 values of as low as 730&#8197;nM. Moreover, the photophysical properties of the phosphaphenalenes introduce the possibility to develop theranostic applications. More information can be found in the Research Article by C. Herold&#8208;Mende, C. Romero&#8208;Nieto, et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202104535).

         <title>HPLC&#8208;Based Automated Synthesis of Glycans in Solution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new experimental set&#8208;up for a HPLC&#8208;A in solution system includes the following modifications: 4&#8208;way split valve, in&#8208;line molecular sieve cartridge and a fraction collector, which enabled fully automated batch synthesis of multiple oligosaccharides with the single press of a button.







Abstract
As the 21st century unfolds with rapid changes, new challenges in research and development emerge. These new challenges prompted us to repurpose our HPLC&#8722;A platform that was previously used in solid phase glycan synthesis to a solution phase batch synthesis described herein. The modular character of HPLC allows for implementing new attachments. To enable sequential synthesis of multiple oligosaccharides with the single press of a button, we supplemented our system with a four&#8208;way split valve and an automated fraction collector. This enabled the operator to load all reagents and all reactants in the autosampler, press the button to start the repetitive automation sequence, leave the lab, and upon return find products of multiple reactions ready for purification, analysis, and subsequent application.

         <title>Electrochemically Assisted Cycloaddition of Carbon Dioxide to Styrene Oxide on Copper/Carbon Hybrid Electrodes: Active Species and Reaction Mechanism</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cu/carbon paper (Cu/CP) electrode catalysts were prepared according to an in&#8208;situ electrodeposition method. They exhibited high activity in catalyzing the electrochemically assisted cycloaddition of CO2 to styrene oxide (SO) forming styrene carbonate (SC) as high&#8208;value&#8208;added product. Cu2+ atoms served as the active sites, that not only activated CO2 electrochemically but also promoted the ring opening of SO in a liquid&#8208;phase reaction.







Abstract
A novel electrochemically assisted cycloaddition process is proposed, in which highly efficient coupling of CO2 with styrene oxide (SO) can be achieved to form styrene carbonate (SC) as a high&#8208;value&#8208;added product. A series of Cu catalysts with different morphologies and chemical states were fabricated on carbon paper (CP) by using in&#8208;situ electrodeposition, and the sample with nano&#8208;dendrimer structure was found to exhibit a relatively high activity of 74.8&#8201;% SC yield with 92.7&#8201;% SO conversion under gentle reaction conditions, thus showing its potential for practical applications. The relatively high electrochemically active surface area and charge transfer ability of dendrimer&#8208;like Cu benefited the electrochemical reaction. In particular, the Cu2+ species that were formed in&#8197;situ during the reaction played a vital role in enhancing the activity and selectivity of the proposed Cu/CP hybrid catalyst. Cu2+ atoms served as active sites that can not only electrochemically activate CO2 but also facilitate the ring opening of SO. Mechanistic analysis suggested that the reaction followed electrochemical and liquid&#8208;phase heterogeneous paths, which provide a new green and sustainable route for efficient utilization of CO2 resources for fine chemical electrosynthesis.

Mechanistic analysis suggested that the reaction followed electrochemical and liquid-phase heterogeneous paths, which provide a new green and sustainable route for efficient utilization of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; resources for fine chemical electrosynthesis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Efficient Electrochemical Reduction of CO2 to Formate in Methanol Solutions by Mn&#8208;Functionalized Electrodes in the Presence of Amines
</title>

         <dc:description>
Carbon cloth electrodes were modified by attaching a manganese organometallic catalyst to the surface by covalent bonds. The system has been used for the electrochemical reduction of CO2 in presence of amines in methanol solution. The enhanced CO2 solubility and the use of pentamethyldiethylentriamine (PMDETA) induce change in chemical selectivity from CO to formate, with very high performances and high selectivity.







Abstract
Carbon cloth electrode modified by covalently attaching a manganese organometallic catalyst is used as cathode for the electrochemical reduction of CO2 in methanol solutions. Six different industrial amines are employed as co&#8208;catalyst in millimolar concentrations to deliver a series of new reactive system. While such absorbents were so far believed to provide a CO2 reservoir and act as sacrificial proton source, we herein demonstrate that this role can be played by methanol, and that the adduct formed between CO2 and the amine can act as an effector or inhibitor toward the catalyst, thereby enhancing or reducing the production of formate. Pentamethyldiethylentriamine (PMDETA), identified as the best effector in our series, converts CO2 in wet methanolic solution into bisammonium bicarbonate. Computational studies revealed that this adduct is responsible for a barrierless transformation of CO2 to formate by the reduced form of the Mn catalyst covalently bonded to the electrode surface. As a consequence, selectivity can be switched on demand from CO to formate anion, and in the case of (PMDETA) an impressive TONHCOO&#8722; of 2.8&#215;104 can be reached. This new valuable knowledge on an integrated capture and utilization system paves the way toward more efficient transformation of CO2 into liquid fuel.

         <title>1&#8208;(Azidomethyl)&#8208;5H&#8208;Tetrazole: A Powerful New Ligand for Highly Energetic Coordination Compounds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Shortening the alkyl chain in 1&#8208;(Azidoethyl)&#8208;5H&#8208;tetrazole (AET) to a methylene bridge results in the formation of highly sensitive 1&#8208;(azidomethyl)&#8208;5H&#8208;tetrazole (AzMT), which exhibits a greatly increased enthalpy of formation, hence a drastically increased detonation performance is calculated. Like AET, AzMT can be applied as ligand in the energetic coordination compounds (ECC) of several transition metals, showing the characteristics of primary explosives capable of initiating pentaerythritol tetranitrate. The ligand as well as all ECCs are fully characterized.







Abstract
Highly energetic 1&#8208;(azidomethyl)&#8208;5H&#8208;tetrazole (AzMT, 3) has been synthesized and characterized. This completes the series of 1&#8208;(azidoalkyl)&#8208;5H&#8208;tetrazoles represented by 1&#8208;(azidoethyl)&#8208;5H&#8208;tetrazole (AET) and 1&#8208;(azidopropyl)&#8208;5H&#8208;tetrazole (APT). AzMT was thoroughly analyzed by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction experiments, elemental analysis, IR spectroscopy and multinuclear (1H, 13C, 14N, 15N) NMR measurements. Several energetic coordination compounds (ECCs) of 3d metals (Mn, Fe, Cu, Zn) and silver in combination with anions such as (per)chlorate, mono&#8208; and dihydroxy&#8208;trinitrophenolate were prepared, giving insight into the coordination behavior of AzMT as a ligand. The synthesized ECCs were also analyzed by X&#8208;ray diffraction experiments, elemental analysis, and IR spectroscopy. Differential thermal analysis for all compounds was conducted, and the sensitivity towards external stimuli (impact, friction, and ESD) was measured. Due to the high enthalpy of formation of AzMT (+654.5&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1), some of the resulting coordination compounds are extremely sensitive, yet are able to undergo deflagration&#8208;to&#8208;detonation transition (DDT) and initiate pentaerythritol tetranitrate (PETN). Therefore, they are to be ranked as primary explosives.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The formation of novel hybrid composites through the combination of the chemically versatile and functional metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) family, with ubiquitous, low cost and durable inorganic glasses is explored in this Concept article. The blends and composites created from this combination may serve to minimise, and eventually solve cost, durability and processability issues of MOFs, whilst retaining their valuable properties.







Abstract
Here, we propose the combination of glassy or crystalline metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) with inorganic glasses to create novel hybrid composites and blends.The motivation behind this new composite approach is to improve the processability issues and mechanical performance of MOFs, whilst maintaining their ubiquitous properties. Herein, the precepts of successful composite formation and pairing of MOF and glass MOFs with inorganic glasses are presented. Focus is also given to the synthetic routes to such materials and the challenges anticipated in both their production and characterisation. Depending on their chemical nature, materials are classified as crystalline MOF&#8208;glass composites and blends. Additionally, the potential properties and applications of these two classes of materials are considered, the key aim being the retention of beneficial properties of both components, whilst circumventing their respective drawbacks.

         <title>The Role of Packing, Dispersion, Electrostatics, and Solvation in High&#8208;Affinity Complexes of Cucurbit[n]urils with Uncharged Polar Guests</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Experimentally obtained (ITC) and computed (DFT) thermodynamic binding parameters (&#916;G, &#916;H, T&#916;S) are reported for CB7&#8208; and CB8&#8208;complexes with uncharged, rigid, and spherically&#8208;shaped guests. The simplicity and diversity of the model system enabled a deep analysis of the energetic driving forces and uncovered the importance of solvation energies. Electrostatic interactions and London dispersion forces are not the selectivity controlling factors.







Abstract
The rationalization of non&#8208;covalent binding trends is both of fundamental interest and provides new design concepts for biomimetic molecular systems. Cucurbit[n]urils (CBn) are known for a long time as the strongest synthetic binders for a wide range of (bio)organic compounds in water. However, their host&#8208;guest binding mechanism remains ambiguous despite their symmetric and simple macrocyclic structure and the wealth of literature reports. We herein report experimental thermodynamic binding parameters (&#916;G, &#916;H, T&#916;S) for CB7 and CB8 with a set of hydroxylated adamantanes, di&#8208;, and triamantanes as uncharged, rigid, and spherical/ellipsoidal guests. Binding geometries and binding energy decomposition were obtained from high&#8208;level theory computations. This study reveals that neither London dispersion interactions, nor electronic energies or entropic factors are decisive, selectivity&#8208;controlling factors for CBn complexes. In contrast, peculiar host&#8208;related solvation effects were identified as the major factor for rationalizing the unique behavior and record&#8208;affinity characteristics of cucurbit[n]urils.

         <dc:description>
The Ni&#8208;SAPO&#8208;34 nanosheets have been prepared through introduction of Ni and Si into the artificial layered AlPO4 followed by exfoliation and crystallization process. The nanosheets has the 2D morphology reserved from layered precursors and the framework incorporated nickel stabilize the 2D structure, along with an extraordinary catalytic performance for the selective oxidation of cyclohexanone to adipic acid with O2.







Abstract
Nanosheets of nickel doped SAPO&#8208;34 molecular sieves in thickness of &#8764;10&#8197;nm (denoted as NS&#8722;Ni&#8208;SAPO&#8208;34) has been successfully prepared through a morphology&#8208;reserved method of synthesis. A special aluminum phosphate in two&#8208;dimensional layered structure is used as precursor and converts to crystallized SAPO&#8208;34 molecular sieve, in nanosheet morphology reserved from the aluminum phosphate precursor, under hydrothermal conditions with tetraethyl orthosilicate and templates of mixed amines added. It is found that adequate amount of nickel, &#8764;5&#8197;wt&#8201;%, added to the synthetic system is a key factor for the morphology&#8208;reserved synthesis. By characterization, the nickel is proved to be doped in the framework of the molecular sieve, which more likely helps to balance the high surface energy of nanosheet products. The NS&#8722;Ni&#8208;SAPO&#8208;34 shows excellent catalytic performance for oxidation of cyclohexanone to adipic acid by gaseous oxygen.

         <title>A Series of Rare&#8208;Earth Mesoionic Carbene Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The generality of employing N&#8208;heterocyclic olefins in the synthesis of mesoionic carbene (MIC) complexes has been shown here with the advent of twelve new f&#8208;block and rare&#8208;earth metal MIC complexes, expanding the library of f&#8208;block and rare&#8208;earth MIC complexes from four to now sixteen in total. Structural, spectroscopic, and computational characterisation data suggest the presence of a solely &#963;&#8208;component to the M&#8722;Ccarbene bonding interaction, whilst magnetic studies highlight that two of the MIC complexes are field&#8208;induced single&#8201;molecule magnets (SMMs).







Abstract
We report the synthesis and characterisation of a series of rare&#8208;earth mesoionic carbene complexes, [RE{N(SiMe3)2}3{CN(Me)C(Me)N(Me)CH}] (3RE, RE=Sc, Ce, Pr, Sm, Gd, Tb, Dy, Ho, Er, Tm, Yb, and Lu), greatly expanding the limited library of f&#8208;block mesoionic carbene complexes. These complexes were prepared by treatment of the parent RE&#8208;triamides with an N&#8208;heterocyclic olefin (NHO), where an NHO backbone proton undergoes a formal 1,4&#8208;proton migration to the NHO&#8208;methylene group. For all RE(III) metals, as expected, quantum chemical calculations suggest only a &#963;&#8208;component to the metal&#8722;carbene bonding, in contrast to a previously reported uranium(III) congener where the 5f3 metal engages in a weak &#960;&#8208;back&#8208;bond to the MIC. All complexes were characterised by static variable&#8208;temperature magnetic measurements, and dynamic magnetic measurements reveal that 3Dy and 3Er are field&#8208;induced single&#8208;molecule magnets (SMMs), with Ueff energy barriers of 35 and 128&#8197;K, respectively. Complex 3Dy is, as expected, a poorly performing SMM, but conversely 3Er performs unexpectedly well.

         <title>Enantioselective Amination of &#946;&#8208;Keto Esters Catalyzed by Chiral Calcium Phosphates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chiral 2&#8208;aminoindane derivatives are a relatively common structural motif found in natural products and pharmaceutical molecules. Hence its highly desirable to develop efficient synthetic methods for enantioselective amination of &#946;&#8208;keto esters. A non&#8208;toxic chiral calcium phosphate&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective amination of &#946;&#8208;ketoesters with dibenzyl azodicarboxylate has been developed, generating chiral &#945;&#8208;amino&#8208;&#946;&#8208;ketoester derivatives in good yields and moderate to excellent enantioselectivities under mild conditions.







Abstract
A catalytic enantioselective amination of &#946;&#8208;keto esters using (S)&#8208;BINOL chiral calcium phosphate has been developed. The reaction produces chiral &#945;&#8208;amino&#8208;&#946;&#8208;keto ester derivatives in most cases with moderate to excellent enantioselectivities (up to 99&#8201;%) and good yields (up to 99&#8201;%). This mild synthetic method highlights a low catalyst loading and high catalytic efficiency. When the substrate backbone was changed to 1&#8208;tetralone&#8208;derived &#946;&#8208;keto esters, unexpectedly high yields of selective redox products were obtained. The practicality of the reaction was realized by a scale&#8208;up without any significant loss in the enantioselectivity and yield. Chiral calcium phosphate was successfully recovered and reused for four runs, indicating its stability and high catalytic activity.

         <title>Influence of the Linker Chemistry on the Photoinduced Charge&#8208;Transfer Dynamics of Hetero&#8208;dinuclear Photocatalysts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hitting the bottleneck: For light&#8208;driven catalysis, either the first or second electron transfer or the actual catalytic turnover is the bottleneck, of which the second process is rarely studied. Here, the charge&#8208;transfer dynamics in photoexcited intermediates of a molecular photocatalyst are investigated by spectro&#8208;electrochemistry to understand the overall process and to identify deactivation channels determining the photocatalysts fate.







Abstract
To optimize light&#8208;driven catalytic processes, light&#8208;mediated multi&#8208;electron transfer dynamics in molecular dyads need to be studied and correlated with structural changes focusing on the catalytically active metastable intermediates. Here, spectro&#8208;electrochemistry has been employed to investigate the structure&#8208;dependent photoelectron transfer kinetics in catalytically active intermediates of two Ru&#8722;Rh catalysts for light&#8208;driven NAD+ reduction. The excited&#8208;state reactivity of short&#8208;lived intermediates was studied along different photoreaction pathways by resonance Raman and time&#8208;resolved transient absorption spectro&#8208;electrochemistry with sub&#8208;picosecond time resolution under operando conditions. The results demonstrate, for the first time, how the bridging ligand serves as a (multi&#8208;)electron storage structure, mediates the strength of the electronic coupling of catalytic and photocenter and impacts the targeted electron transfer as well as parasitic electron&#8208;transfer kinetics.

Here, spectro-electrochemistry has been employed to investigate the structure-dependent photoelectron transfer kinetics in catalytically active intermediates of two Ru&#8722;Rh catalysts for light-driven NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; reduction. The excited-state reactivity of short-lived intermediates was studied along different photoreaction pathways by resonance Raman and time-resolved transient absorption spectro-electrochemistry with sub-picosecond time resolution under &lt;i&gt;operando&lt;/i&gt; conditions. The results demonstrate, for the first time, how the bridging ligand serves as a (multi-)electron storage structure, mediates the strength of the electronic coupling of catalytic and photocenter and impacts the targeted electron transfer as well as parasitic electron-transfer kinetics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Red Light&#8208;Emitting Thermally&#8208;Activated Delayed Fluorescence of Naphthalimide&#8208;Phenoxazine Electron Donor&#8208;Acceptor Dyad: Time&#8208;Resolved Optical and Magnetic Spectroscopic Studies</title>

The locally&#8208;excited triplet state (3LE) is found as an essential intermediate state in thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) of compact electron&#8208;donor&#8208;acceptor system. 3LE and charge&#8208;separated states (1CS and 3CS) are close to each other in energy, the interaction of three states causes TADF, which is analyzed by femtosecond/nanosecond transient absorption spectra and time&#8208;resolved electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy.







Abstract
We prepared an orthogonal compact electron&#8208;donor (phenoxazine, PXZ)&#8208;acceptor (naphthalimide, NI) dyad (NI&#8208;PXZ), to study the photophysics of the thermally&#8208;activated delayed fluorescence (TADF), which has a luminescence lifetime of 16.4&#8197;ns (99.2&#8201;%)/17.0&#8197;&#956;s (0.80&#8201;%). A weak charge transfer (CT) absorption band was observed for the dyad, indicating non&#8208;negligible electronic coupling between the donor and acceptor at the ground state. Femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy shows a fast charge separation (CS) (ca. 2.02&#8764;2.72&#8197;ps), the majority of the singlet CS state is short&#8208;lived, especially in polar solvents (&#964;CR = 10.3&#8197;ps in acetonitrile, vs. 1.83&#8197;ns in toluene, 7.81&#8197;ns in n&#8208;hexane). Nanosecond transient absorption spectroscopy detects a long&#8208;lived transient species in n&#8208;hexane, which is with a mixed triplet local excited state (3LE) and charge separated state (3CS), the lifetime is 15.4&#8197;&#956;s. In polar solvents, such as tetrahydrofuran and acetonitrile, a neat 3CS state was observed, whose lifetimes are 226&#8197;ns and 142&#8197;ns, respectively. Time&#8208;resolved electron paramagnetic resonance (TREPR) spectra indicate the existence of strongly spin exchanged 3LE/3CT states, with the effective zero field splitting (ZFS) |D| and |E| parameters of 1484&#8197;MHz and 109&#8197;MHz, respectively, much smaller than that of the native 3NI state (2475 and 135&#8197;MHz). It is rare but solid experimental evidence that a closely&#8208;lying 3LE state is crucial for occurrence of TADF and this 3LE state is an essential intermediate state to facilitate reverse intersystem crossing in TADF systems.
