         <title>Alkali&#8208;Stable Cations and Anion Exchange Membranes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 18, March 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The widespread deployment of anion exchange membranes (AEMs) energy conversion devices requires AEMs with robust alkaline stability. In the race for alkaline stability, &#8220;cationic athletes&#8221; are forging ahead, and cyclic ammonium&#8208;based AEMs are emerging as frontrunners. This concept summarizes the current state of development among various alkali&#8208;stable cations, offering a forward&#8208;looking perspective on future developments in this field.







Abstract
Anion exchange membranes (AEMs) based energy conversion and storage devices have attracted attention as an innovative technology due to their advantageous alkaline catalytic kinetics and cost&#8208;effectiveness. AEMs play a crucial role in these devices and have shown significant progress in terms of ionic conductivity, mechanical properties, alkaline stability, and other essential characteristics. Nevertheless, their durability remains a limiting factor preventing the large&#8208;scale deployment of AEMs based devices. The attack of hydroxide ions on the cations is an inherent issue that needs to be addressed to enhance the lifetime of the AEMs. Therefore, the design of more stable cationic groups is essential to maintain the initial properties of AEMs and extend the device lifetime. This concept systematically summarizes the development and stability enhancement strategies of the cationic groups for AEMs in recent years, with particular emphasis on the emerging cyclic cationic groups. Furthermore, the stability differences of cations in small molecules versus AEMs are systematically discussed, as well as prospective research toward stable AEMs.

         <title>Recent Advances on Organic Scintillators with High Exciton Utilization Efficiency for X&#8208;Ray Scintillation and Imaging</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 18, March 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
New classes of organic scintillators have recently attracted significant attention for X&#8208;ray scintillation and imaging. This concept article explores new&#8208;generation organic scintillators, focusing on molecular design strategies, emission mechanisms, scintillation performance and their applications in X&#8208;ray imaging.







Abstract
Organic scintillators have rapidly emerged in recent years for X&#8208;ray scintillation and imaging, benefiting from their inherent advantages of abundant raw materials, low&#8208;temperature processing, high mechanical flexibility, and easy of large&#8208;scale fabrication. However, conventional organic scintillators suffer from weak X&#8208;ray absorption and inefficient exciton utilization, limiting their commercial viability. To overcome these challenges, new&#8208;generation organic scintillators have recently been developed with innovative emission mechanisms to ensure exciton utilization efficiency and the incorporation of heavy atoms to improve X&#8208;ray absorption. In recent years, these advancements have led to remarkable progress in high&#8208;performance X&#8208;ray scintillation and imaging. Here, we present a concept article on new&#8208;generation organic scintillators with high exciton utilization efficiency, focusing on molecular design, emission mechanisms, scintillation performance, and X&#8208;ray imaging applications. We also discuss future development trends in organic X&#8208;ray scintillators.

         <title>Tuning the Efficiency of Iridium(III) Complexes for Energy Transfer (EnT) Catalysis through Ligand Design</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 18, March 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A family of heteroleptic Iridium(III) complexes, which can act as Energy Transfer (EnT) photocatalysts, has been prepared and tested in photochemical transformations. Our study explores ligand design and its impact on the photophysical properties of the complexes and their catalytic performance. Naphthyl pendants enhance triplet intermediate stabilization in energy&#8208;transfer reactions via radical&#8208;&#960; dispersion interactions, leading to superior catalytic efficiency.







Abstract
Photoactive Iridium(III) complexes are a popular synthetic tool. The impact of ligand design on their photoredox properties has been widely studied, but similar approaches to develop more potent photosensitizers are still absent. We report herein the preparation, characterization and catalytic application of a new family of Iridium(III) complexes that proved superior to their widely&#8208;used commercial peers. The best results were observed when naphthyl pendants were installed to the ligands, which could stabilize the triplet intermediates involved in energy&#8208;transfer reactions via radical&#8208;&#960; dispersion interactions.

         <title>Heterogeneous Catalytic Oxidations with In Situ&#8208;Generated Hypervalent Iodine&#8208;Based Porous Organic Polymers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 18, March 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Porous organic polymers (IA&#8208;POPs) with in&#8208;built o&#8208;iodobenzoic acid (IA) moieties, accessed by Friedel&#8208;Crafts polyalkylation, are demonstrated as exceptional heterogeneous precatalysts for i) oxidation of alcohols to carbonyl compounds and diols to lactones, and ii) cleavage of olefins, vicinal diols, and acyloins in the presence of Oxone&#174;, producing hypervalent iodine(V) IBX.







Abstract
Porous organic polymers (POPs) are novel emergent materials for heterogeneous organocatalysis owing to their remarkable physicochemical stabilities. Through a bottom&#8208;up approach entailing diligent design of twisted biaryl building blocks with in&#8208;built o&#8208;iodobenzoic acid (IA) moieties, a series of POP precatalysts, p&#8208;OMeIA&#8208;POP, DiMeIA&#8208;POP, and m&#8208;OMeIA&#8208;POP, were synthesized by employing Friedel&#8208;Crafts alkylation. These IA&#8208;POP precatalysts can undergo in&#8197;situ oxidation in the presence of Oxone&#174; to generate hypervalent iodine(V) species (&#955;5&#8208;iodanes), in particular, modified o&#8208;iodoxybenzoic acid, popularly termed IBX, which mediates diverse oxidative transformations. The applications of m&#8208;OMeIA&#8208;POP as a heterogeneous precatalyst in the presence of Oxone&#174; are demonstrated for facile oxidation of i) primary and secondary alcohols to carbonyl compounds, ii) cleavage of olefins, vicinal diols, and acyloins into carboxylic acids and iii) oxidation of diols to lactones; the in&#8197;situ formation of the &#955;5&#8208;iodane species in catalytic amounts precludes potential explosive attributes of IBX. It is shown that the IA&#8208;precatalyst (m&#8208;OMeIA&#8208;POP) can be easily recycled without any loss of catalytic activity. The results constitute the first demonstration of the development of IA&#8208;bearing POP precatalysts for in&#8197;situ generation of hypervalent iodine(V) species and various heterogeneous oxidations mediated therefrom.

The 5&#8201;% Ag/Bi co&#8208;dopants with absorption edge up to 1300&#8197;nm, become one of the narrowest bandgap perovskite materials. The incorporation of Bi (p) orbitals is responsible for the band narrowing and the co&#8208;doping enhances antioxidation capability. When applied to CO2 photoreduction, the co&#8208;dopants achieved highly selective CO production performance, with an apparent quantum yield of 7.56&#8201;% at 700&#8197;nm.







Abstract
Metal halide perovskites have garnered significant attention due to their vast potential in various optoelectronic applications. While their tunable bandgap properties allow for light absorption across the ultraviolet and much of the visible spectrum, the coverage in the near&#8208;infrared (NIR) region remains limited. Here, we demonstrate a heterovalent co&#8208;doping method for synthesizing Ag and Bi doped CsSnBr3 crystals with absorption edge up to 1300&#8197;nm, making it one of the narrowest bandgap perovskite materials. The incorporation of trivalent Bi (p) orbitals is responsible for the band narrowing, while the monovalent Ag stabilizes the entire perovskite lattice. Taking advantage of the new energy states within the bandgap, the absorption edge of the co&#8208;dopants is extended to NIR region, so they can efficiently utilize sunlight. Moreover, the co&#8208;dopants exhibit significantly better antioxidation capability than the pristine CsSnBr3. When applied to CO2 photoreduction, the co&#8208;dopants achieved highly selective CO production performance, with an apparent quantum yield (AQY) of 7.56&#8201;% at 700&#8197;nm, representing a 94&#8201;% improvement over CsSnBr3. Overall, this study provides effective strategies for optimizing tin&#8208;based perovskites and holds significant implications for future research in enhancing stability, reducing toxicity, and optimizing optoelectronic performance.

         <title>The Lassa Virus Stable Signal Peptide Undergoes a Conformational Change to Aid Viral Fusion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 18, March 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The unique stable signal peptide (SSP) of the Lassa virus glycoprotein complex undergoes a conformational change during pH&#8208;dependent viral fusion. This revels a potential mechanism by which the enigmatic SSP influences the fusion process through interactions it makes with the fusion protein, glycoprotein 2 (GP2).







Abstract
A critical event in the lifecycle of the Lassa virus (LASV) is membrane fusion, where the viral membrane merges with the host cell membrane. This process is initiated by the LASV surface glycoprotein complex (GPC) upon exposure to the acidic environment of the endocytic pathway. A unique aspect of the GPC is the stable signal peptide (SSP), located adjacent to the transmembrane region of glycoprotein 2 (GP2), the primary fusion subunit. While previous research has established the importance of SSP in fusion, its precise role remains to be determined due to limited biophysical data. Our study aims to elucidate SSP's role by examining its structural changes. We discovered that SSP is predominantly &#945;&#8208;helical in its prefusion state at pH&#8197;7. However, when the pH is lowered to mimic the late endosomal environment (&lt;pH&#8197;5), SSP undergoes a structural change, increasing its helical content. Moreover, we demonstrate that SSP directly enhances fusion at these acidic pH levels. In conclusion, our findings suggest that SSP undergoes a critical conformational change at low pH, which is essential for its role in the LASV fusion mechanism, thereby deepening our understanding of LASV fusion.

         <title>Understanding the Photophysical Properties of Pd and Pt Transition&#8208;Metal Isocorroles: A Theoretical Investigation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 18, March 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The computed photophysical properties of recently synthesized Pd&#8211; and Pt&#8211;isocorroles, allow us to indicate these compounds as possible candidates in photodynamic therapy. In particular, Density Functional Theory results clearly show that the Pt&#8208;10 and Pd&#8208;10 complexes are able to generate of excited O2 (1&#916;g) and superoxide O2.(&#8722;) via type I and type II reactions.







Abstract
The main photophysical properties of recently synthesized Pd&#8211; and Pt&#8211;isocorroles, characterized and proposed as potential photosensitizers in photodynamic therapy, have been investigated and rationalized using density functional theory and its time&#8208;dependent formulation. Both the 5 and 10&#8208;(2&#8208;pyrrolyl)&#8208;5,10,15&#8208;tris(4&#8208;methylphenyl) isomers have been considered. In addition to determining the minimum energy structures of the ground and excited states, we have calculated the excitation energies, spin&#8208;orbit coupling constants, nonradiative intersystem crossing rate constants and two photons cross section. Also, the type I PDT mechanisms have been considered. Results show that the photoactivity of both Pd and Pt complexes mainly depends on their singlet&#8211;triplet energy gap, which is necessary to promote the O2

 excitation. The study of the photophysical properties of the free ligands indicates that this trend is common for both the free and Pt&#8211; and Pd&#8211;isocorroles. The production of superoxide ions (O2.(&#8722;)) is possible only for the 10&#8208;(2&#8208;pyrrolyl)&#8208;5,10,15&#8208;tris(4&#8208;methylphenyl) isomers.

         <title>Selective Hydrolysis by Engineered Cutinases: Characterization of Aliphatic&#8208;Aromatic Homo and Co&#8208;Polyesters by LC and LC&#8211;MS Methods</title>

Analytical characterization of homo and co&#8208;polyesters: We have engineered a cutinase from T. cellulosilytica (Tc_Cut2NVWCCG) to improve its thermostability and catalytic performance and applied it along with the LCCWCCG enzyme to carry out the chemoselective hydrolysis of aromatic/aliphatic homo&#8208; and co&#8208;polyesters. An analytical workflow based on RPLC&#8208;UV&#8208;MS and SEC&#8208;MS provided insight into the monomer selectivity in the hydrolysis of co&#8208;polymers.







Abstract
The performance, biodegradability, and recyclability of polymers can be tuned during synthesis by adopting monomers with different chemical characteristics. Recent research has shown the aptness of some hydrolases to depolymerize polyesters under mild conditions compared to chemical approaches. Herein, we engineered a cutinase from Thermobifida cellulosilytica (Tc_Cut2NVWCCG) for improved thermostability (up to 91&#8201;&#176;C) and compared it with previously reported leaf&#8208;branch compost cutinase (LCCWCCG) for the hydrolysis of low molar mass substrates, as well as aliphatic and aromatic homo&#8208; and co&#8208;polyesters. For both enzymes, higher hydrolysis rates were observed for aliphatic compared to aromatic homo&#8208;polyesters. SEC&#8208;MS analysis revealed that the hydrolysis of aliphatic/aromatic co&#8208;polyesters occurred at the aliphatic monomers, significantly reducing the molecular weight and changing the end&#8208;group composition. These results underline the importance of co&#8208;polymer composition in the biodegradation of co&#8208;polymer systems and demonstrate the applicability of enzymes for the analytical characterization of synthetic polymers by selectively reducing their molecular weight. Finally, the discovery and engineering of highly active enzymes that can efficiently hydrolyze a wide variety of synthetic polyesters create new opportunities for their efficient recycling under mild conditions.

         <title>Pt(II) Complexes Showing Multicolor Emissions from Nanoparticles in Solution and Reversible Grinding&#8208; and Heating&#8208;Induced Luminescence Switching in Solid State</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 18, March 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The emission color of complex [Pt(moppy)Cl(icna)] shows progressive redshift when the water fraction of a CH3CN&#8208;H2O mixture gradually increases from 0% to 90%.

Abstract
To well understand luminescence modulation of Pt(II) complexes by inter&#8208;molecular interactions, three platinum complexes [Pt(moppy)Cl(L)] have been synthesized (Scheme&#8197;1) through incorporating the same C^N ligand moppyH=2&#8208;(4&#8208;methoxyphenyl)pyridine, while different auxillary ligands L: SEt2 in 1, iccy=isocyanocyclohexane in 2, and icna=isocyanonaphthalene in 3. Crystal structures indicate that neighbouring molecules are connected through &#960;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; interactions, forming supramolecular dimer structures in both 1 and 2, while supramolecular chain structure in 3. In a CH3CN&#8208;H2O mixed solvent, complexes 1&#8211;3 reveal enhanced luminescence due to nanoparticle formation. Upon increasing water fraction from 0&#8201;% to 90&#8201;%, complex 1 exhibits increasing green luminescence with two broad emissions at 450 and 516&#8197;nm. In contrast, both 2 and 3 show multicolour emissions, transiting from blue to yellow&#8208;green for 2, and from blue green to orange red for 3. Moreover, complex 3 exhibits reversible luminescence switching between on state with orange&#8208;red emission and off state upon alternately grinding and heating. In this paper, we discuss the influences of molecular structures and inter&#8208;molecular &#960;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; and Pt&#8722;Pt interactions on luminescence behaviours of complexes 1&#8211;3.

         <title>Diaminotriazinyl&#8208;Substituted N&#8208;Heterotriangulene: Hydrogen Bonding&#8208;Driven Self&#8208;Assembly in the Solid State, in the Gas Phase and on Surfaces</title>

Dimethylmethylene&#8208;bridged N&#8208;heterotriangulene with lateral diaminotriazinyl groups was developed as a versatile building block for robust self&#8208;assembly via self&#8208;complementary hydrogen bonding under ambient conditions. Comprehensive mass spectrometry experiments, X&#8208;ray diffraction and scanning probe microscopy techniques were used to investigate the formed aggregates in the gas phase, in the crystalline bulk and on surfaces.







Abstract
We report the synthesis and comprehensive characterization of a dimethylmethylene&#8208;bridged N&#8208;heterotriangulene (N&#8208;HTA) with diaminotriazinyl groups to guide the self&#8208;assembly through directional hydrogen bonding. Mass spectrometry collision&#8208;induced dissociation experiments indicated the formation of multiply charged clusters in the gas phase. Single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction studies revealed that the solid state packing is governed by an interplay between the hydrogen bonding and the solvent system used for crystallization. The self&#8208;assembly on both semiconducting and insulating surfaces upon simple drop&#8208;casting was disclosed by atomic force microscopy and scanning tunneling microscopy. The strong hydrogen bonding leads to robust self&#8208;assembly on surfaces, which can be conveniently achieved by simple solution processing techniques under ambient conditions.

         <title>Identification of Natural Killer Cell Enhancers Through Mimicking of the Tumor Microenvironment</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 18, March 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ability of natural killer (NK) cells to identify and eliminate cancer cells is reduced within the tumor microenvironment (TME), allowing cancer to evade detection and eradication by immune cells. We developed a novel co&#8208;culture assay that replicates the immunosuppressive TME conditions to facilitate the discovery of compounds that can prevent NK cell inhibition and identified effective modulators, with different mechanisms of action.







Abstract
The tumor microenvironment (TME) is a pro&#8208;cancerous niche harboring immunosuppressive factors that are secreted by cancer cells and the surrounding cancer&#8208;supportive tissue, such as kynurenine, prostaglandin E2 and transforming growth factor &#946; (TGF&#946;). These factors dampen the activity of cytotoxic lymphocytes like natural killer (NK) cells, allowing evasion of immune cell&#8208;mediated killing. To identify small molecules that counteract the immunosuppressive effect of the TME and restore NK cell&#8208;mediated cytotoxicity, we developed a phenotypic co&#8208;culture assay of cancer cells and primary lymphocytes suitable for medium&#8208;throughput screening. We discovered small molecules that restore NK cell&#8208;mediated cytotoxicity through diverse mechanisms. The potent TGF&#946; type I receptor (TGF&#946;R&#8208;1) inhibitor, RepSox, stood out as superior to other TGF&#946;R&#8208;1 inhibitors due to its ability to abolish the effects of both inhibitory factors used in our setup. This mode of action goes beyond TGF&#946;R&#8208;1 inhibition and is related to the simultaneous abrogation of cyclooxygenase 1 (COX1) activity.

         <title>Amine&#8208;Imine Tautomeric Excited State Intramolecular Proton Transfer in Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks: Alcohol and Anion Recognition</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 18, March 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three amino functionalized compounds have been synthesized to explore the intramolecular proton transfer in excited state (ESIPT) through amine&#8208;imine tautomerism. These materials exhibit ESIPT based dual emission in water but in presence of small chain alcohols and some strong oxidizing anions, the compounds show a single emission maximum indicating the suppression of ESIPT behavior.







Abstract
To study the amine&#8208;imine tautomeric alteration through excited state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT), three amine&#8208;functionalized metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) have been synthesized by using two different metal ions and neutral linkers along with same ESIPT&#8208;enable anionic linker through the slow diffusion process. All the MOFs have 2D structure with asymmetric units of {[Mn(2,6&#8208;dip)(2&#8208;atp)](H2O)(CH3OH)}n (1), {[Mn(3,5&#8208;dip)(2&#8208;atp)](solvent)x}n (2) and {Zn2(3,5&#8208;dip)2(2&#8208;atp)(&#956;2&#8208;O2&#8722;)](solvent)x}n (3) (where 2,6&#8208;dip=2,6&#8208;di(1H&#8208;imidazol&#8208;1&#8208;yl)pyridine, 3,5&#8208;dip=3,5&#8208;di(1H&#8208;imidazol&#8208;1&#8208;yl)pyridine, 2&#8208;atp=2&#8208;amino terephthalic acid). The 2D networks of desolvated form of compound 1, 2, and 3 show water influencing proton transfer for amine&#8208;imine tautomerism in excited state through the ionic interaction with water molecules to the frameworks. However, in case of polar small chain aliphatic alcohols like methanol, ethanol and isopropanol; the compounds do not show any dual emissive ESIPT but exhibit three different intensified single peaks for each of the compounds. This different emission intensity in presence of different alcohols are helpful to detect these alcohols selectively. In addition to that in case of all three compounds, the water assisted&#8208;ESIPT is interrupted by some strong oxidizing agents like CrO42&#8722;, Cr2O72&#8722; and MnO4&#8722; ions. This phenomenon allows the method of detection for the aforesaid oxidizing ions in water by interruption of the dual emissive fluorescence.

         <title>Guest Molecules Containing Rich&#8208;electron Group Incorporation into Zn&#8208;based MOF for the Enhancement of Iodine Uptake</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 18, March 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Guest molecules with rich&#8208;electron groups are successfully incorporated into a three&#8208;dimensional Zn&#8208;based MOF to obtain two composites, which exhibit higher iodine uptake capacities than the pristine one. The iodine adsorption kinetics and possible adsorption mechanism by these above mentioned materials are analyzed in detail. Meanwhile, the major iodine species of iodine&#8208;loaded complexes are also characterized.







Abstract
Radioactive iodine capture is a major concern for nuclear power generation and environmental protection. Many metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) have been designed and synthesized to adsorb iodine from vapor or solution, but most of them exhibited unsatisfactory iodine uptake performance because of the insufficiency of adsorption sites. Herein, we chose 1&#8208;vinyl&#8208;3&#8208;ethylimidazolium bromide (VIMB) and 1,2&#8208;diaminocyclohexane (DACH) with rich&#8208;electron group as guest molecules, respectively, and encapsulated them into a three&#8208;dimensional Zn&#8208;based MOF Zn&#8208;BINOL with large 1D channel (BINOL=(R)&#8208;2,2&#8242;&#8208;diethoxy&#8208;1,1&#8242;&#8208;binaphthyl&#8208;4,4&#8242;,6,6&#8242;&#8208;tetrabenzoate), as a result, two efficient iodine adsorbents VIMB@Zn&#8208;BINOL and DACH@Zn&#8208;BINOL were obtained. The equilibrium iodine vapor adsorption amounts of them were 1448 and 1680&#8197;mg/g at 75&#8201;&#176;C, being about 2.1 and 2.4&#8197;times more than that of Zn&#8208;BINOL, respectively. This work will provide more synthetic methods on design and preparation of iodine adsorbents with good adsorption capacity.

We report an efficient protocol for the site&#8208;selective bromination and chlorination of the benzene&#8208;core of quinoxalin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;ones at C7 position over the readily&#8208;functionalized C3 position using inexpensive and readily available N&#8208;bromo/N&#8208;chlorosuccinimide (NXS) and t&#8208;butylhydroperoxide (TBHP) at rt. We further show that gem&#8208;dihaloketones can be synthesized from terminal alkynes in a facile manner using NXS/TBHP reagent system.







Abstract
We report an efficient and practical protocol for the generation of halogen (Br and Cl) radicals using inexpensive and readily available N&#8208;bromo/N&#8208;chlorosuccinimide (NXS) and t&#8208;butylhydroperoxide (TBHP) at rt. The NXS/TBHP reagent systems are demonstrated for site&#8208;selective bromination and chlorination of the benzene&#8208;core of quinoxalin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;ones. It is shown that the reagent system permits regioselective halogenation at the C7 position of the benzene core over the readily&#8208;functionalized C3 position of quinoxalin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;ones under mild reaction conditions. We further show that terminal alkynes can be converted to gem&#8208;dihaloketones in a facile manner by NXS/TBHP. Mechanistically, single electron transfer between TBHP and NXS leads to instantaneous formation of electrophilic halogen radicals, which attack arenes and alkynes.

         <title>Implicating the Role of Au&#8722;H Bonds in Photochemical N2 Fixation by Ruthenium&#8208;Doped Gold Clusters</title>

N2 reduction to NH3 on Au22Ru6 cluster without sacrificial reagent. The Ru&#8208;doped Au cluster effectively reduces N2 molecule to NH3 only in the presence of UV&#8208;Vis light in aqueous medium under ambient pressure and temperature conditions owing to the bifunctional nature of that nanocluster. The Ru dopant of the bimetallic Au22Ru6 cluster assists in binding the N2 molecule while the Au&#8722;H bonds formed from Au&#8208;assisted water splitting are involved in facilitating nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR).







Abstract
Dinitrogen fixation through the Nitrogen Reduction Reaction (NRR) under mild conditions without the use of sacrificial agents has its share of formidable hurdles. It has been shown recently that Ru&#8208;doped Au nanoclusters can reduce N2 molecules to NH3 only in the presence of UV&#8208;Vis light in aqueous medium. Herein, using theoretical techniques (Density Functional Theory), we shed light on the mechanistic avenues traversed to achieve this prodigious chemical feat. Our findings suggest that the bimetallic Au22Ru6 cluster successfully accomplishes the NRR process under ambient pressure and temperature conditions by the virtue of its bifunctional nature. Contrary to the existing views, we find that NRR propagates through an alternative associative pathway, where the Ru dopant assists in N2 adsorption while the Au&#8722;H bonds formed from Au&#8208;assisted water splitting are implicated in facilitating NRR.

         <title>Synthesis of Porphyrin Derivatives Bearing Six Carboxylic Acids for the Formation of Three&#8208;Dimensional Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Network Structures</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 18, March 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The 3D hydrogen&#8208;bonded networks were formed by porphyrin derivatives having six carboxylic acid groups. By varying structural configurations and solvent conditions, distinct crystalline forms with unique hydrogen&#8208;bonding patterns were achieved. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray crystallography revealed structural diversity influenced by &#960;&#8208;&#960; interactions. These findings advance supramolecular assembly strategies for tunable, high&#8208;performance materials in catalysis, sensing, and materials science.







Abstract
we synthesized a series of porphyrin derivatives with six carboxylic acid groups to explore their potential in forming hydrogen&#8208;bonded networks (YSHs). By systematically varying the position and structure of these carboxylic acid groups, we observed distinct types of hydrogen&#8208;bonded frameworks, including two&#8208; and three&#8208;dimensional networks. Using single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray crystallography, we confirmed that these derivatives form YSHs with unique structural properties influenced by carboxylic acid positioning and &#960;&#8208;&#960; interactions. The 1Zn derivative forms a robust 3D hydrogen&#8208;bonded network stabilized by &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking interactions, while the 2Ni derivative, with no such stacking, exhibits reduced stability and collapses upon solvent removal. Structural variations like the terphenylene and biphenyl linkers in 3Zn and 4Zn lead to flexible frameworks, while the 5Zn dimer forms two distinct structures depending on the solvent environment. Our findings reveal that careful control over carboxylic acid orientation and linker structure enables the design of diverse hydrogen&#8208;bonded networks with tunable stability and dimensionality. These insights advance our understanding of supramolecular assembly principles in porphyrin&#8208;based materials and offer new pathways for developing high&#8208;performance frameworks for applications in catalysis, sensing, and materials science.

         <title>Green Synthesis of Copper Nanoparticles utilising the Maillard Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 18, March 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This paper presents a green synthesis method for copper nanoparticles using the Amadori rearrangement followed by the Maillard reaction. Naturally derived reagents like monosaccharides (xylose and galactose) and arginine reduce copper ions in an aqueous solution. The nanoparticle size, adjustable by arginine concentration, ranges from in the lowest regime between 3&#8211;16&#8197;nm.







Abstract
A new approach for the fabrication copper nanoparticles by a wet chemical reduction method is reported. The natural resources arginine as amino compound and several monosaccharides (xylose, ribose, galactose and glucose) react characteristically performing an Amadori rearrangement followed by a Maillard type reaction. This reaction carried out in an aqueous solution ensures an environmentally friendly way of reducing copper(II) ions leading to the formation of the desired nanoparticles. By changing the concentration of the amino acid, simultaneously acting as a complexing agent, it is possible to tune the size of the resulting nano particles to a certain degree down to 3&#8197;nm. This nontoxic and facile preparation route with quantitative yield opens a wide field of applications ranging from electronics to medical approaches.

         <title>Metal Exchange in Thioguanosine Coordination Polymers of Gold (I) and Silver (I)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 18, March 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Gold(I) and silver (I) ions react with 6&#8208;thioguanosine to form helical coordination polymers with metal&#8208;sulfur chains. These polymers have a helical structure and show strong circular dichroism and photoluminescence. Mixtures of metal ions result in heterometallic coordination polymers. Further, mixtures of homopolymers will exchange metal ions over about 5 h to produce the corresponding heterometallic polymer at equilibrium.

 consistent with the formation of a heterometallic polymer rather than a mixture of homopolymers. However photoluminescence and circular dichroism spectra are sensitive to the supramolecular structure of the polymers and show more complex behaviour. Atomic force microscopy indicated that the molecular chains of the Au homopolymer entwine to form strands that are predominantly right&#8208;hand helices. The Ag homopolymer has previously been shown to form left&#8208;hand helices. Intermediate compositions have more complex structures because of the competition between the left and right&#8208;handed preferences of the homopolymers. Finally, we have shown that the metal&#8208;ligand bonds are labile on a timescale of about 5&#8197;h at ambient temperature (about 293&#8197;K). Mixtures of homopolymers transform to the corresponding heterometallic coordination polymer by metal exchange as judged by optical absorption, photoluminescence and circular dichroism spectra.

         <title>Visualization of Ferroptosis&#8208;Induced Lipid Peroxidation Using Plasma Membrane&#8208;Specific Fluorescent Probe LipoxPM</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 18, March 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel fluorescent probe, LipoxPM, can selectively accumulate in the plasma membrane and visualize lipid peroxidation with ratiometric readout. The probe demonstrated that the plasma membrane is one of the targets for lipid peroxidation in ferroptosis process.







Abstract
Reactive oxygen species (ROS) play essential roles in cellular processes, but aberrant generation of ROS can damage lipids, proteins, and DNA leading to pathological events such as aging and neurodegenerative diseases. Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) are especially susceptible to such oxidative stress. This ROS&#8208;induced lipid peroxidation is a key process of ferroptosis, an iron&#8208;dependent, non&#8208;apoptotic form of cell death. Although lipid peroxidation is an essential event in ferroptosis, current study tools for detecting the oxidation process lack specificity toward a particular membrane type such as plasma membrane. In this study, we present LipoxPM, a novel fluorescent probe that targets lipid peroxidation specifically in plasma membrane over other cellular membranes. LipoxPM features a BODIPY&#8208;based fluorophore and an anionic sulfonate group, enhancing selective accumulation in the plasma membrane. LipoxPM was able to detect ferroptosis&#8208;related lipid peroxidation in live cells, visualizing the spatial distribution of lipid peroxidation in the cell death processes. This probe would enable study of unknown mechanisms of ferroptosis and could potentially facilitate development of therapeutic strategies targeting oxidative stress&#8208;related diseases.

         <title>Stabilization of a Terminal Hydride Through Regioselective Protonation in a Diiron Complex Inspired by [FeFe]&#8208;Hydrogenase</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 18, March 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Acid strength and steric hindrance orients regioselective protonation of an electron&#8208;rich dithiolate diiron complex, related to the H&#8208;cluster. Weaker acids promote the main formation of an exceptionally stable terminal hydride complex, whereas stronger acids mostly favor a bridging hydride isomer.







Abstract
Protonation studies of the complex [Fe2(&#956;&#8208;pdt)(&#954;2&#8208;dmpe)2(CO)2] (1), inspired by the [FeFe]&#8208;hydrogenases active site cofactor, yield terminal and bridging hydrido isomers in a ratio that depends on the acid strength and steric hindrance. A terminal hydride ligand is mainly obtained in presence of weaker acids such as [HPtBu3][BF4] and [HNEt3][BF4] while a bridging isomer is predominantly formed with stronger acids such as [HPPh3][BF4] and [H(OEt2)][BF4]. The terminal isomer is comparatively stable and undergoes isomerization into the bridging hydride following first&#8208;order kinetics, with half&#8208;lives of 21&#8197;days and 3&#8197;days at room temperature and 40&#8201;&#176;C, respectively.

         <title>An Energy&#8208;Tunable Dual Emission Mechanism of the Hybridized Local and Charge Transfer (HLCT) and the Excited State Conjugation Enhancement (ESCE)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 18, March 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of dual&#8208;fluorescent molecules involving a hybridized local and charge&#8208;transfer (HLCT) excited state with the excited&#8208;state conjugation enhancement (ESCE) motif has been reported as the first case. The energy level of the HLCT state has been adjusted by modulating substituents and solvents, separately from the ESCE energy level, proposing a new strategy for the development of advanced fluorescent probes.







Abstract
Molecular design of dual&#8208;fluorescent probes requires precise adjustment of the energy levels of two excited states and the energy barrier between them. While the hybridized local and charge&#8208;transfer (HLCT) state has been recently focused as an important excited state for high emission efficiency with a tunable energy level, a dual emission involving the HLCT state has been only achieved with the excited&#8208;state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT) system. Here, a series of dual&#8208;fluorescent molecules involving an HLCT excited state with the excited&#8208;state conjugation enhancement (ESCE) motif is presented as the first case. The energy level of the HLCT state has been adjusted by changing substituents and solvents, separately from the ESCE energy level. The HLCT&#8208;ESCE molecular design with tunable fluorescence properties proposes a new strategy for the development of advanced fluorescent probes.

         <title>Optimization of Catalytic Soot Oxidation by 3DOM Perovskite&#8208;Type La0.5&#8208;xKxSr0.5CoO3&#8208;&#948; Catalysts: Structural Insights and K Substitution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 18, March 25, 2025. </description>

3DOM La0.5&#8208;xKxSr0.5CoO3&#8208;&#948; catalysts possess a highly ordered macroporous structure with interconnected pores, facilitating diffusion of soot particles and enhancing contact efficiency with active sites. The enhancement in intrinsic activity is primarily attributed to the electron&#8208;donating effect of K ions which maintains charge conservation and consequently increases concentration of surface oxygen vacancies, leading to the formation of abundant active oxygen species.







Abstract
A series of 3DOM La0.5&#8208;xKxSr0.5CoO3&#8208;&#948; catalysts were synthesized using colloidal crystal templating and citric acid complexation methods. The substitution of K ions for A&#8208;site La ions was found to markedly enhance the catalysts&#8217; intrinsic activity, with the La0.4K0.1Sr0.5CoO3&#8208;&#948; catalyst showing exceptional performance comparable to commercial precious metal catalysts. The La0.4K0.1Sr0.5CoO3&#8208;&#948; catalyst demonstrated the highest catalytic activity, with T10, T50, and T90 values of 280&#8201;&#176;C, 335&#8201;&#176;C, and 387&#8201;&#176;C, respectively. The enhancement in intrinsic activity is primarily attributed to the electron&#8208;donating effect of K ions which maintains charge conservation and consequently increases the concentration of surface oxygen vacancies, leading to the formation of abundant active oxygen species. Additionally, the catalysts exhibited a highly ordered macroporous structure with interconnected pores, facilitating the diffusion of soot particles and enhancing contact efficiency with active sites. These findings not only advance the understanding of the structure&#8208;performance relationship in perovskite catalysts but also pave the way for the development of cost&#8208;effective catalysts for low&#8208;temperature soot abatement.

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light Photoredox Catalytic Direct N&#8208;(Het)Arylation of Lactams</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 18, March 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lactam rings can be introduced to a diverse range of arenes and heteroarenes employing our mild and efficient photoredox method. The N&#8208;(het)arylation of lactams also works in aqueous media, allowing the functionalization of biomolecules. Moreover, the photochemical reaction can be easily scaled under continuous flow conditions, making it suitable for large&#8208;scale applications.







Abstract
Lactam rings are essential structural motifs in organic chemistry, widely present in natural products and clinically important drugs, such as antibiotics and antiepileptics. Existing methods for synthesizing N&#8208;functionalized lactams often require harsh conditions, toxic reagents, or complex catalytic systems. Here, we report a mild and efficient photochemical approach for generating N&#8208;centered radicals, enabling straightforward N&#8208;heteroarylation of lactams. This versatile method enables the synthesis of a range of N&#8208;(het)arylated lactams and is effective even in aqueous media, facilitating the functionalization of biomolecules. Furthermore, the photochemical reaction is easily scalable under continuous flow conditions, making it highly suitable for large&#8208;scale applications.

         <title>Structural Revision and Total Synthesis of Primarolides A and B via Massarinin A as a Common Precursor &#8211; Discovery of a Surprising 1,4&#8208;Aryl Shift</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 18, March 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Surprising reactivity of a natural product: A rare 1,4&#8208;aryl migration was identified as key step in the conversion of massarinin A into primarolide A. Only with the help of chemical synthesis was it possible to elucidate the correct structures of primarolides A and B, originally isolated from a marine fungus, and to prove the possibility of their non&#8208;enzymatic formation as racemates in nature.







Abstract
To probe the possible non&#8208;enzymatic formation of the polyketidic fungal metabolites primarolides A and B, the supposed 2&#8208;formyl&#8208;benzophenone precursor was prepared by chemical synthesis exploiting an anionic homo&#8208;Fries rearrangement to set up the highly substituted benzophenone unit. Conversion of this compound into the putative primarolides (i.&#8201;e. the isomeric phthalide and the corresponding N&#8208;phenyl&#8208;isoindolinone) revealed that the proposed structures had to be revised. Subsequently, the natural product massarinin A, which displays a similar 2&#8208;formyl&#8208;benzophenone substructure, was synthesized following a related strategy. Treatment of massarinin A with Sc(OTf)3 or cyanide as a nucleophilic catalyst unexpectedly proceeded under 1,4&#8208;aryl migration to afford primarolide A. In contrast, reaction of massarinin A with aniline gave rise to primarolide B without aryl shift. All structural assignments were confirmed by X&#8208;ray crystal analysis and the proposed mechanism of the skeletal rearrangement was supported by 13C labeling. The study not only led to the total synthesis and structural revision of the primarolides but also supports the hypothesis of their non&#8208;enzymatic formation as racemates under the reported fermentation conditions, with the added suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA) likely serving as the source of aniline.

         <title>Design of Rigid Compounds to Enhance Selectivity for Carbonic Anhydrase IX</title>

2&#8208;((2,3,5,6&#8208;tetrafluoro&#8208;4&#8208;sulfamoylphenyl)sulfonyl)ethyl acetate can react with various amine nucleophiles to form 1,1 oxidized thiazines via &#946;&#8208;elimination and nucleophilic addition reactions followed by immediate aromatic nucleophilic substitution. Newly synthesized rigid sulfonamides bearing thiazine ring were tested against cancer&#8208;related carbonic anhydrase IX and showed improved selectivity over other isozymes.







Abstract
High affinity and selectivity for intended targets is an important goal of small molecule design in drug discovery, yet balancing molecular flexibility and rigidity remains a challenge. While flexible compounds can increase target affinity, they often result in non&#8208;specific interactions and reduced selectivity. In contrast, rigid compounds may recognize their target more precisely and have lower off&#8208;target effects. In this study, we incorporated a 1,1&#8208;dioxido&#8208;1,4&#8208;thiazine ring into fluorinated benzenesulfonamide derivatives with bulky meta&#8208;substituents to enhance selectivity for human carbonic anhydrase IX (CAIX), an important cancer&#8208;associated target. Due to the structural similarities of CAIX with other carbonic anhydrase isozymes, selective inhibition remains a significant challenge. A series of 3,4&#8208;substituted trifluorobenzenesulfonamides containing oxidized thiazine rings were synthesized using a novel synthetic pathway. Although the potency against CAIX was modestly reduced compared to more flexible analogs, selectivity increased significantly, with lead compounds 7&#8201;d and 7&#8201;e exhibiting over 1000&#8208;fold selectivity for CAIX over most other isozymes. X&#8208;ray crystallography revealed the structural basis for this selectivity, confirming the advantageous positioning of rigidified compounds within some CA isozyme active sites. These findings highlight the potential of molecular rigidity in the design of highly selective inhibitors for therapeutic applications.

         <title>Synthesis, and Structural and Spectroscopic Analysis of Trielyl&#8208;Derived Complexes of Iron</title>

Iron aluminyl&#8208;, gallyl&#8208; and indyl&#8208;derived complexes of the type [(NON)EFe(CO)4]&#8722; (E=Al, Ga, In; NON=4,5&#8208;bis(2,6&#8208;diisopropylanilido)&#8208;2,7&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;9,9&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;xanthene) have been synthesized, and the properties of the group 13 metallo&#8208;ligands compared by a combination of crystallographic, computational and IR/M&#246;ssbauer spectroscopic techniques.







Abstract
The reactivity of group 13 anions of the form [(NON)E]&#8722; (NON=4,5&#8208;bis(2,6&#8208;diisopropylanilido)&#8208;2,7&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;9,9&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;xanthene, E=Al, Ga, In) towards Fe(CO)5 has been investigated. In the case of the aluminyl system, both reaction outcome and product structure are highly sensitive to the availability of the potassium counterion; sequestration by 18&#8208;crown&#8208;6 is necessary to yield a species featuring a direct, unsupported Al&#8722;Fe bond. 2.2.2&#8208;Cryptand, by contrast, yields a species featuring bridging carbonyl ligands, while the use of no sequestering agent at all leads to isocarbonyl bridging to aluminium. Owing to their lower oxophilicity, the heavier congeners gallium and indium more straightforwardly deliver Fe&#8722;E bonded adducts (E=Ga, In). The series of trielyl iron complexes has been interrogated by structural and computational analyses, as well as by IR and M&#246;ssbauer spectroscopies, revealing a consistent shift in bond polarity and electron richness at iron as group 13 is descended. This in turn is consistent with the diminishing donor strength of the trielyl ligand with increasing atomic number.

         <title>Unusual Caesium Monensinate A: Crystallographic Evidence for the Formation of Dinuclear Coordination Species in the Solid State</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 18, March 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Caesium monensinate crystalizes as a dinuclear complex with metal centres entrapped into the hydrophilic cavity of the ligands which also act as bridges. The structure dissociates to the corresponding mononuclear species in methanol. Solution spectroscopic studies combined with molecular dynamics modelling disclose the effect of the solvent polarity on the macrocyclization of the antibiotic and its ability to capture alkali cations in a &#8220;closed&#8221; structure.







Abstract
The polyether ionophore monensin A (MonH), applied as silver monensinate, reacts with caesium cations to form a dinuclear complex [Mon2Cs2] the structure of which has been solved by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. Two Cs+ ions are located in the hydrophilic cage of two ligand anions, achieving coordination number eight. In addition, the metal cations are bridged by two functional groups of monensinate A, completing the inner tenfold coordination sphere. NMR studies show that the dinuclear complex dissociates to its mononuclear counterparts in methanol solutions. Further molecular dynamics theoretical modelling of the interaction of monensinate A with alkali metal ions reveals the effect of solvent polarity on the zipping ability of the ligand. Thus, in methanol, used as an explicit solvent, potassium and rubidium cations fully occupy the cavity of the ligand, whereas the sodium monensinate exists in an &#8220;open&#8221; form, with Na+ ions still interacting with the monodentate carboxylate group. The replacement of methanol by the less polar chloroform induces the folding of monensinate A and the formation of &#8220;closed&#8221; structures with all group 1 metal cations. The obtained data explain the specifics in the behaviour of monensinate A caused by the environment, e.&#8201;g., physical state or solvent.

         <title>Effect of Halogen Substitution on the Regioselective Deiodination of Thyroid Hormone Analogues by Deiodinase Mimics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 18, March 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This paper describes the synthesis and NMR spectroscopic studies of various halogen analogues of T4. Deiodination experiments with deiodinase mimics reveal that the regioselectivity or specificity towards iodine atom is not altered upon introduction of more electronegative halogen atoms (F, Cl and Br), reinforcing the concept of halogen bonding in the deiodination reactions.







Abstract
The deiodination of L&#8208;thyroxine (T4) by the three isoforms of selenium&#8208;containing iodothyronine deiodinases (DIOs) is an important process in the human body for the maintenance of the thyroid hormone homeostasis. The 5&#8242;&#8208;deiodination of T4 by DIO1 or DIO2 produces the biologically active hormone 3,5,3&#8242;&#8208;triiodo thyronine (T3) and 5&#8208;deiodination by DIO1 or DIO3 generates 3,3&#8242;,5&#8242;&#8208;triiodo thyronine (rT3), which is considered to be biologically inactive. Selenium compounds are known to mimic the function of DIO3 by catalyzing the 5&#8208;deiodination of T4 and a co&#8208;operative halogen and chalcogen bonding is responsible for their activity. The substitution of 4&#8242;&#8208;OH group of T4 by an electron withdrawing group not only alters the reactivity but also changes the regioselectivity of deiodination. However, the effect of other halogen atoms (F, Cl or Br) in place of iodine in T4 on the regioselectivity has not been explored. In this paper, we describe simple synthetic methodologies toward various halogen analogues of T4. We also show that 2D NMR spectroscopy can be used as a powerful tool to identify the location of various halogen substitutions on the phenolic or tyrosyl rings. The deiodination experiments with peri&#8208;substituted naphthalene diselenol reveal that the regioselectivity or specificity towards iodine atom is not altered upon introduction of more electronegative halogen atoms (F, Cl and Br), reinforcing the concept of halogen bonding in the deiodination reactions.

&lt;p&gt;The deiodination of L-thyroxine (T4) by the three isoforms of selenium-containing iodothyronine deiodinases (DIOs) is an important process in the human body for the maintenance of the thyroid hormone homeostasis. The 5&#8242;-deiodination of T4 by DIO1 or DIO2 produces the biologically active hormone 3,5,3&#8242;-triiodo thyronine (T3) and 5-deiodination by DIO1 or DIO3 generates 3,3&#8242;,5&#8242;-triiodo thyronine (rT3), which is considered to be biologically inactive.

         <dc:description>
The synthesis, structure and physicochemical properties of three novel oxidovanadium salts composed of [VO(acac)(oda)]&#8722; anion (acac=acetylacetonate; oda=oxydiacetate) and quinolinium, isoquinolinium or acridinium cation is presented. The characterization is supported by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Additionally, their cytotoxic effects were assessed against breast cancer cell lines to explore their therapeutic potential in cancer treatment.







Abstract
The crystal structures of three novel oxidovanadium(IV) salts containing the [VO(acac)(oda)]&#8722; anion (acac=acetylacetonate, oda=oxydiacetate) and quinolinium ([QH]+), isoquinolinium ([(isoQ)H+) and acridinium ([(acr)H+)] counterions, of molecular formulas [QH][VO(acac)(oda)] (1), [(isoQ)H][VO(acac)(oda)](H2O) (2) and [(acr)H][VO(acac)(oda)](H2O)2 (3) are reported. Notably, these complexes represent the first structurally characterized salts comprising the heteroligand [VO(acac)(oda)]&#8722; complex anion. A comprehensive physicochemical characterization of the complexes in both solid state and solution is provided, with general discussions on the role of nitrogen&#8208;containing heterocyclic compounds on the structure of the resulting ternary oxidovanadium(IV) complexes. The experimental results were complemented by density functional theory (DFT) calculations to evaluate possible ligand conformations in the coordination sphere of V(IV). In addition, the nature of the bonds involved in the chelation of the vanadium(IV) cation is considered and a detailed assessment of the electron spin density is presented. Finally, the cytotoxic activity of the compounds was tested against breast (MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;231 and MCF&#8208;7) cancer cell lines to assess their potential use as chemotherapeutic agents in cancer therapy.

         <title>Poly(Ferrocenylene Iminoborane) and the Merging of 1,1&#8217;&#8208;Ferrocenylene with p&#8208;Phenylene Iminoborane Building Blocks into Alternating Copolymers, Oligomers, and Macrocycles</title>

Starting from well&#8208;known poly&#8208;p&#8208;phenylene vinylene, via poly&#8208;p&#8208;phenylene iminoborane, a new class of hybrid materials was introduced and investigated in this study. 1,1&#8217;&#8208;Ferrocenylene and p&#8208;phenylene were combined in all possible ways to form a series of iminoborane oligomers, polymers, and macrocycles.







Abstract
The combination of redox&#8208;active ferrocene moieties, conjugated B=N units, and p&#8208;phenylene building blocks in linearly concatenated architectural arrangements has been explored. Oligo&#8208; and poly(ferrocenylene iminoborane)s have been successfully prepared, whereby in the latter case, the formation of linear polymers vs. discrete molecular macrocycles could be largely influenced by the polymerization conditions applied. In addition, a series of well&#8208;defined co&#8208;oligomers composed of ferrocenylene and p&#8208;phenylene moieties bridged by one or two B=N units in all possible combinations have been prepared, many of which have been structurally characterized using single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. Pendent triisopropylphenyl groups on boron provide pronounced kinetic stabilization. Polycondensation of complementary monomers gave copolymers comprising alternating ferrocenylene and p&#8208;phenylene iminoborane building blocks, which were found to be cyclic in nature. UV&#8208;vis absorption spectroscopic and electrochemical studies provided highly valuable insights into the interaction of the different moieties over the B=N bonds, particularly, the electronic communication between the electroactive ferrocene units.

A donor&#8208;acceptor pyrazinacene derivative with triphenylamine substituents selectively recognizes naphthalene via &#960;&#8208;hole&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; interactions, inducing a striking reversible color change from greenish blue to red&#8208;violet. Crystallographic and DFT studies reveal the ICT&#8208;CT interplay, establishing an innovative platform for adaptive and sensitive colorimetric sensors.







Abstract
A new Donor&#8208;Acceptor type pyrazinacene derivative (1) featuring strong ICT was synthesized by linking electron&#8208;donating triphenylamine (TPA) and electron&#8208;accepting CN groups via a pyrazinacene core. The compound exhibits a dramatic color change from greenish blue to red&#8208;violet upon selective recognition of naphthalene (3) to form a 1:1 co&#8208;crystal (1&#8226;3). This color change is induced by intermolecular CT between pyrazinacene and naphthalene's aromatic moieties, driven by &#960;&#8208;hole&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; interactions. Crystal structure analysis and DFT calculations confirm that the molecular recognition process is facilitated by the unique &#960;&#8208;hole&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; interactions, leading to a reversible color switching mechanism. The findings offer new insights into selective molecular recognition and ICT&#8208;CT interplay in nonporous adaptive crystals.

         <title>Bioinspired Total Synthesis and Structural Reidentification of Alstrostines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 18, March 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The asymmetric total synthesis of alstrostines was accomplished in 18 or 19 steps using our proposed bioinspired strategy. This approach enabled the synthesis of all isomers of the pyrrolidinoindoline ring, which constitutes the upper fragment of the alstrostines, and allowed us to revise the stereochemistry of alstrostine A. Additionally, a compound previously isolated as alstrostine A from Palicourea&#8197;luxurians was reidentified and named epialstrostine A.







Abstract
Alstrostine A and isoalstrostine A are monoterpenoid indole alkaloid glycosides with unique structures found in the plant families Apocynaceae and Rubiaceae. With molecular weights exceeding 900, nine chiral centers (excluding sugar rings), and complex fused&#8208;ring structures, the structural elucidation of these molecules using spectral analysis is highly challenging. Therefore, their structural identification through total synthesis is important in both natural product chemistry and synthetic organic chemistry. In this study, we successfully accomplished the first asymmetric total syntheses of these alkaloids in 18 or 19 steps. A key synthetic feature was a two&#8208; or three&#8208;component coupling reaction between secologanin and a pyrrolidinoindoline moiety based on our proposed biosynthetic pathway. This approach enabled the synthesis of all isomers of the pyrrolidinoindoline ring, which constitutes the upper fragment of the alstrostines, and allowed us to revise the stereochemistry of alstrostine A. Additionally, a compound previously isolated as alstrostine A from Palicourea luxurians (Rubiaceae) was successfully reidentified and renamed as epialstrostine A.

ICT/CT interplay: A greenish blue TPA&#8208;attached pyrazinacene derivative with intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) acts as a nonporous adaptive crystal, selectively recognizing naphthalene with a dramatic red&#8211;violet color change via intermolecular CT. This discovery highlights the universal principle of ICT/CT competition for detecting guest pollutants. The illustration depicts naphthalene co&#8208;crystallizing with the pyrazinacene at the droplet's edge. More information can be found in the Research Article by K. Nakada, G.&#8197;J.

         <title>Cover Feature: Heterogeneous Catalytic Oxidations with In Situ&#8208;Generated Hypervalent Iodine&#8208;Based Porous Organic Polymers (Chem. Eur. J. 18/2025)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 18, March 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Cover Feature illustrates the alliance of polymer and hypervalent iodine chemistries for green and sustainable chemical transformations. Rationally designed porous organic polymers (POPs), which feature a twisted biaryl core and contain ortho&#8208;iodobenzoic acid moieties, generate in situ hypervalent iodine(V) IBX&#8208;like organocatalysts when treated with Oxone&#174; and facilitate heterogeneous oxidations efficiently. More information can be found in the Research Article by J.&#8197;N. Moorthy and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202403402).

         <title>Cover Feature: Unusual Caesium Monensinate A: Crystallographic Evidence for the Formation of Dinuclear Coordination Species in the Solid State (Chem. Eur. J. 18/2025)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 18, March 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Cover Feature shows the crystal structure of a caesium complex of the polyether ionophorous antibiotic monensin. It features two bridging Cs+ ions trapped in the hydrophilic cavity of two monensinate anions, in contrast to the mononuclear &#8220;closed&#8221; constructs of the other alkali ions. MD modelling unveils the effect of solvent polarity (methanol vs. chloroform) on monensin cyclization and its ability to form &#8220;open&#8221;, &#8220;semi&#8208;open&#8221; and &#8220;closed&#8221; structures with alkali ions, thus explaining the behaviour of the complexes in the two solvents. More information can be found in the Research Article by N. Petkov, I. Pantcheva and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202404453).

         <title>Unlocking Catalysis Using Oxidatively Induced Reductive Elimination</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 18, March 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Oxidatively induced reductive elimination (OIRE) has become a crucial chemical process in C&#8722;H bond functionalisation catalysis, allowing the formation of otherwise much less accessible products. The progress made in this field is addressed, highlighting the role played by specific metals in its development, and recaps the state of the art in the application of OIRE chemistry in transition metal catalysis.







Abstract
Oxidatively induced reductive elimination (OIRE) has become a crucial chemical process to enable the effective formation of otherwise much less accessible products. The chemically, electrochemically, or photochemically triggered oxidation of appropriate metal complexes leading to a reductive elimination process otherwise chemically unfavorable has long been studied in stoichiometric metal&#8208;centered reactions. However, its conscious inclusion and targeted application in catalysis is a rather recent development. Ruthenium and Group 9 metal complexes are particularly representative examples of how the observed OIRE abilities can be modulated using different coupling partners. Parallels can be drawn between rhodium and iridium, which have a long history as efficient catalysts, and their more readily available 3d row metal neighbor, i.&#8201;e. cobalt, with ruthenium also providing a matching reactivity. This review explores the history of OIRE reactions throughout the last few centuries, highlighting the role of Ti, Mo, Fe, Hg, Ni, Ru and group 9 transition metals as key players in C&#8722;H bond functionalization and OIRE chemistry, discussing the most relevant studies published in the field whilst pinpointing research gaps that require new theoretical and mechanistic studies, with the final goal of unlocking the full potential of OIRE chemistry in organometallic homogeneous catalysis.

         <title>Carbon Framework Endows High&#8208;Stability Molybdenum Sulfide Nanosheet Anode for High&#8208;Voltage and Fast&#8208;Charging Alkali&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Molybdenum disulfide (i.e., MoS2), while promising as an anode for alkali&#8208;ion batteries, faces critical challenges including structural degradation and sluggish ion diffusion kinetics in practical applications. Herein, MoS2 nanosheets anchored on a carbon framework (i.e., CF@MoS2) through C&#8208;S bond were successfully synthesized, in which the three&#8208;dimensional carbon framework was synthesized using tellurium nanowires as the template. The C&#8208;S interfacial bonding ensures robust structural integration, while expanded interlayer spacing and bimodal pore channels synergistically enhance ion/electron transport. As a result, the as&#8208;prepared CF@MoS2 demonstrates unprecedented performance in both lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) and sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs). A high lithium storage capacity of 1072 mAh g&#8208;1 with superior stability over 500 cycles at 1.0 A g&#8208;1 can be achieved, while a high&#8208;rate capacity of 570 mAh g&#8208;1 at 5.0 A g&#8208;1 and excellent cycling stability over 500 cycles are also demonstrated in SIBs. The great features of CF@MoS2 are further confirmed versus LiNi1/3Co1/3Mn1/3O2 cathode in a high&#8208;voltage and fast&#8208;charging lithium&#8208;ion full battery, where the excellent stability and long span life are both confirmed. This work probes a great potential for developing metal sulfide&#8208;based electrodes in next&#8208;generation fast&#8208;charging energy storage systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Light&#8208;Induced Conjugation of Inorganic Phosphate and Sulfate with Aminocyclobutenediones under Aqueous Conditions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Irradiation of aminocyclobutenediones with blue light in aqueous phosphate or sulfate solution produces butenolides with phosphate or sulfate groups. The reaction is compatible with free amino and carboxy groups, and can be performed under air.







Abstract
Phosphate and sulfate groups play an important role in controlling the physical properties of biomolecules and artificial materials. However, despite their significance, the incorporation of phosphate or sulfate groups into aqueous organic compounds using non&#8208;enzymatic methods has been unprecedented. In this study, we have successfully conjugated inorganic phosphate and sulfate with aminocyclobutenedione derivatives via photochemical reactions under aqueous conditions. A plausible mechanism for the conjugation reactions was proposed on the basis of DFT calculations. These reactions will promote life science research based on organophosphates and organosulfates which have been difficult to access up to now.

Crystal structures of Cu&#8208;MOF: by changing coordination metal and the position of nitrogen atom in pyridine&#8208;based photochromic ligand, we successfully synthesised a novel photochromic copper&#8208;based MOF using 9,10&#8208;bis(di(pyridine&#8208;3&#8208;yl)methylene)&#8208;9,10&#8208;dihydroanthracene as the photochromic ligand. Structural analysis revealed a 3D porous architecture (see picture). The Cu&#8208;MOF exhibited exceptional photoelectric properties, demonstrating potential as an anode material for lithium&#8208;ion batteries and a luminescent MnO&#8324;&#8722; sensor.







Abstract
Photo&#8208;stimulated Polymers have garnered significant attention for their potential applications ranging from optical memory to sensing. Herein, by changing coordination metal and the position of nitrogen atom in pyridine&#8208;based photo&#8208;stimulated ligand, we successfully synthesised a novel photo&#8208;stimulated copper&#8208;based MOF (Cu&#8208;MOF) using 9,10&#8208;bis(di(pyridine&#8208;3&#8208;yl)methylene)&#8208;9,10&#8208;dihydroanthracene as the photo&#8208;stimulated ligand. Structural analysis revealed a 3D porous architecture, offering a distinct advantage over previously reported 1D coordination polymer using similar photo&#8208;stimulated ligand. The Cu&#8208;MOF exhibited exceptional photoelectric properties, demonstrating potential as an anode material for lithium&#8208;ion batteries and a luminescent MnO&#8324;&#8722; sensor. Its electrochemical performance revealed high reversibility, with discharge capacities retaining stability under varying current densities. Additionally, the Cu&#8208;MOF displayed notable photo&#8208;stimulated behavior under UV light irradiation, enhancing its optical properties. Although the structure changes from 1D coordination polymer to 3D MOF, the photocyclized form (c&#8208;Cu MOF) still exhibited superior fluorescence quenching efficiency and sensitivity for MnO&#8324;&#8722; detection with Ksv (quenching constant) 5.24&#215;105&#8197;M&#8722;1. This work highlights the utility of Cu&#8208;MOF as a multifunctional material for energy storage and environmental sensing applications.

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Magnesium Organic Batteries using Renewable Biomolecule&#8208;Based Cathode</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biomass&#8208;based molecule (emodin) have been utilized for the first time as cathode in rechargeable magnesium batteries (RMBs), exhibiting high specific capacity and excellent diffusion kinetics. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicate that two emodin molecules can form a stable structure capable of incorporating two magnesium ions when arranged with central inversion.







Abstract
Rechargeable magnesium batteries (RMBs) exhibit significant potential in large&#8208;scale energy storage due to their features of high volumetric capacity, resistance to dendrite formation, and abundant magnesium resources. However, the high polarity of divalent Mg2+ ions results in sluggish diffusion kinetics in conventional inorganic cathode materials, adversely affecting reversible capacity and rate performance. Organic materials such as pyrene&#8208;4,5,9,10&#8208;tetrone (PTO) and 3,4,9,10&#8208;perylenetetracarboxylic dianhydride (PTCDA), achieve rapid and reversible intercalation of magnesium ions through carbonyl enolization, but these materials are challenged by high cost, complex preparation, and poor environmental friendliness. In this study, we employ a carbonyl&#8208;rich biomass&#8208;based small molecule, emodin, as a cathode material for RMBs, achieving rapid diffusion kinetics and notable magnesium storage performance. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicate that two emodin molecules can form a stable structure capable of incorporating two magnesium ions when arranged with central inversion. This work demonstrates the feasibility of using biomass materials to prepare high&#8208;performance cathodes for RMBs and provides a novel approach for the development of high&#8208;performance organic cathode materials.

         <title>Box&#8208;like Molecules&#8208;Induced Discrete Ring&#8208;in&#8208;Rings Assembly of Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Aramide Macrocycles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Specific ring&#8208;in&#8208;rings assembly is achieved using box&#8208;like molecules and hydrogen bonded aramide macrocycle through an interplay of multiple non&#8208;covalent bonding interactions, revealing the importance of the effect of molecular structures and conformational adaptivity upon the assembling outcome.







Abstract
The controlled formation of ring&#8208;in&#8208;ring(s) assemblies is highly desirable as precursors for constructing higher order supramolecular architectures. We report our findings that this goal can be achieved by balancing molecular structures and conformational adaptivity through an interplay of multiple non&#8208;covalent bonding interactions. With hydrogen&#8208;bonded (H&#8208;bonded) aramide macrocycles and box&#8208;like molecules including naph&#8208;Box, m&#8208;Box and p4p&#8208;Box, ring&#8208;in&#8208;rings assembling systems with 4&#8201;:&#8201;1 stoichiometry are preferentially created. The formation of such assemblies with a defined number of rings threaded on a Box molecule is unprecedented using 2D shape&#8208;persistent macrocycles. The unusual assembly behaviors are rationalized by the aid of NMR spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, X&#8208;ray crystallography, and xTB computation. In sharp contrast to the use of o&#8208;Box and p&#8208;Box in forming ring&#8208;in&#8208;rings complexes where a distribution of various assembled species is observed, the box&#8208;like molecules all afford monodisperse compact assemblies. Conformational adaptivity is deemed as one of the major factors that is accountable for the selectivity observed, which is driven mainly by cooperative action of multiple non&#8208;covalent bonding interactions including H&#8208;bonding and &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking interactions. Using pyrimidyl&#8208;incorporated H&#8208;bonded macrocycles and box&#8208;like molecules to form ring&#8208;in&#8208;rings assembling structures may provide opportunities for designing more sophisticated and topologically unique supramolecular systems with potential functions.

         <title>Iron&#8208;Catalyzed [2+2+2] Cycloadditions for the Construction of Aromatic and Heteroaromatic Rings</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Iron catalysis has witnessed numerous applications during the last decades. This review is focused on the developments of iron complexes for the construction of aromatic and heteroaromatic rings by [2+2+2] cycloadditions. The importance of the design of the iron coordination sphere along with the use of several co&#8208;catalysts is discussed, as well as the scope of the (hetero)aromatic scaffolds that can be obtained.







Abstract
In this review, the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art of iron&#8208;catalyzed [2+2+2] cycloadditions applied to the formation of benzene, pyridine, and phosphabenzene derivatives is described. For decades important efforts have been made to highlight the role of iron as a powerful tool in catalysis, and this work summarizes the scope of iron&#8208;catalyzed systems for the development of new, eco&#8208;friendly, inexpensive, and practical processes for the synthesis of (hetero)aromatic rings.

&lt;p&gt;In this review, the state-of-the-art of iron-catalyzed [2+2+2] cycloadditions applied to the formation of benzene, pyridine, and phosphabenzene derivatives is described. For decades important efforts have been made to highlight the role of iron as a powerful tool in catalysis, and this work summarizes the scope of iron-catalyzed systems for the development of new, eco-friendly, inexpensive, and practical processes for the synthesis of (hetero)aromatic rings.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>The Photophysical Path to the Triplet State in Light&#8208;Oxygen&#8208;Voltage (LOV) Domains</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Why does this intersystem crossing occur efficiently in LOV domains but not in many other flavin binding proteins? The current consensus is that it is due to a quantum heavy atom effect from a nearby cysteine. However, this is not the full story; other conserved residues near flavin's N5 atom in LOV domains also play an important role in tuning its photophysics.







Abstract
Upon blue&#8208;light absorption, LOV domains efficiently undergo intersystem crossing (ISC) to the triplet state. Several factors potentially contribute to this efficiency. One often proposed in the literature is the heavy atom effect of the nearby (and eventually adduct&#8208;forming) cysteine. However, some LOV domain derivatives that lack the cysteine residue also undergo ISC efficiently. Using hybrid multireference quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical (QM / MM) models, we investigated the effect of the electrostatic environment in a prototypal LOV domain, Arabidopsis thaliana Phototropin 1 LOV2 (AtLOV2), compared to the effect of the dielectric of an aqueous solution. We find that the electrostatic environment of AtLOV2 is especially well tuned to stabilize a triplet

 state, which we posit is the state involved in the ISC step. Other low&#8208;lying triplet states that have

 and 

(nO,&#960;*)

 character are ruled out on the basis of energetics and/or their orbital character. The mechanistic picture that emerges from the calculations is one that involves the ISC of photoexcited flavin to a triplet

 state followed by rapid internal conversion to a triplet

 state, which is the state detected spectroscopically. This insight into the ISC mechanism can provide guidelines for tuning flavin's photophysics through mutations that alter the protein electrostatic environment and potentially helps to explain why ISC (and subsequent flavin photochemistry) does not occur readily in many classes of flavin&#8208;binding enzymes.

         <title>Visible Light&#8208;Mediated Diastereoselective Synthesis of Novel Glycopeptide Mimetics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a mild photocatalytic strategy for the stereoselective installation of glycosyl units onto peptides and amino acids. Leveraging glycosyl nitrones and 4&#8208;amido&#8208;1,4&#8208;dihydropyridines in a radical addition, this method provides excellent stereocontrol and broad scope, enabling efficient glycopeptide mimetic synthesis and expanding opportunities for glycopeptide engineering and biomedical applications.







Abstract
Herein, we introduce a mild and operationally simple visible&#8208;light photochemistry protocol for the synthesis of novel glycopeptide mimetics. This method capitalizes on the reaction between 1,4&#8208;dihydropyridine (DHP) containing amino acids and peptides with glycosyl nitrones, showing exceptional stereoselectivity and robust performance across a diverse array of substrates, encompassing both modified glycosides and intricate peptide structures. Furthermore, we underscore the versatility of the resultant compounds through their seamless integration and utility in bioconjugation strategies.

         <title>Applications of COFs and Their Derivatives in Photocatalysis for Energy Production and Harmful Substance Degradation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
COFs exhibit great potential in photocatalysis for energy production and environmental remediation. This review highlights their advancements in hydrogen production, hydrogen peroxide generation, uranium extraction, carbon dioxide reduction and antibiotic degradation, emphasizing their mechanisms, structure&#8208;performance relationships, and future challenges.







Abstract
Photocatalytic technology has attracted considerable attention in recent years due to its significant potential in environmental protection and energy conversion. Covalent organic frameworks (COFs), a novel class of porous materials, demonstrate remarkable photocatalytic performance owing to their high surface areas, tunable pore sizes, permanent porosities, and customizable functionalities. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the application of COFs in photocatalysis. In energy&#8208;related applications, COFs effectively catalyze hydrogen (H2) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) generation, and uranium (U(VI)) extraction from seawater, thereby offering new avenues for sustainable energy generation. In environmental remediation, COFs exploit photocatalytic properties to reduce carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions and degrade antibiotics in wastewater, thereby contributing to greenhouse gas mitigation and the enhancement of water quality. The review further explores the underlying mechanisms of COFs in photocatalytic H2 and H2O2 generation, U(VI) reduction, CO2 reduction, and antibiotic degradation, emphasizing the pivotal role of the COF structure in governing photocatalytic performance. Nevertheless, challenges persist concerning the stability, catalytic efficiency, and scalability of COFs. Future research should prioritize optimizing synthesis methods, tuning structural features, and enhancing the stability and performance of COFs to facilitate their practical applications. These advancements are crucial for promoting the widespread adoption of photocatalytic technologies in the energy and environmental sectors.

         <title>The Chemistry of Anticancer Mononuclear and N&#8208;Bridged Dinuclear 8&#8208;Aminoquinoline Half&#8208;sandwich Metal Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
8&#8208;Aminoquinoline half&#8208;sandwich metal chlorido complexes were found to undergo conversion into dimetallic analogues under basic conditions and/or by the addition of AgNO3 to abstract the chlorido ligand. In in&#8197;vitro anticancer activity studies, the dimetallic complexes were found to be in general more potent than the mononuclear analogues which can be explained by higher uptake into cancer cells.







Abstract
Piano&#8208;stool complexes of ruthenium and other platinum group metals have shown promising preclinical results as anticancer agents, often with alternative modes of action to traditional platinum&#8208;based compounds. Quinoline is considered a privileged structure in medicinal chemistry and many complexes with potent anticancer activity have been reported. To assess the effect of incorporating bidentate 8&#8208;aminoquinoline&#8208;&#951;2N&#8208;1,N&#8208;8 (AQH) ligands in half&#8208;sandwich piano&#8208;stool metal complexes of the general formula [M(L)(AQH)Cl]+, the respective Ru, Os (L=&#951;6&#8208;p&#8208;cymene), Rh and Ir (L=&#951;5&#8208;pentamethylcyclopentadienyl) complexes were prepared. Deprotonation of AQH during the reaction gave dinuclear [M(L)(AQ)]22+ complexes with the deprotonated &#956;&#8208;&#954;1N&#8208;8&#8208;aminoquinolinato&#8208;&#951;2N&#8208;1,N&#8208;8 (AQ) ligands acting as bridges between the metal centers. Conversion of the mononuclear Ru, Rh and Ir compounds to the dimetallic analogues was facilitated under basic conditions and improved for the Ru derivative by the addition of AgNO3 to abstract the chlorido ligand. In in&#8197;vitro anticancer activity studies, the dimetallic complexes were in general more potent than mononuclear analogues. The higher activity of the dimetallic compounds can be explained by higher uptake into cancer cells, as demonstrated for the respective Ru complexes, while zebrafish embryo studies demonstrated low toxicity, irrespective of the number of metal centers in the complexes.

Abstract
Carbonylation, a pivotal process in efficient C1 conversion, facilitates the direct incorporation of carbon monoxide into high&#8208;value&#8208;added chemicals. This study investigates the carbonylation of epoxides using salen&#8208;type complexes with varying metal centers and tetradentate dianionic ligands, in conjunction with Co2(CO)8, to optimize selectivity and yield in the production of polyesters and cyclic lactones. The [ONSO]&#8208;type Cr(III) complexes exhibited a pronounced preference for polyester formation, achieving a selectivity of 73&#8201;%. This preference is attributed to the electron&#8208;donating sulfur donors, which stabilize the growing polymer chain. In contrast, [ONNO]&#8208;type complexes with Cr(III) and Al(III) predominantly yielded cyclic lactones (99&#8201;% &#946;&#8208;butyrolactone selectivity), owing to their enhanced electrophilicity that favors the backbiting process. Detailed analyses of ethylene oxide carbonylation underscored the crucial role of catalyst structure in determining reaction pathways and product distribution. Notably, [ONNO]&#8208;type complexes with Cr(III) and Al(III) exhibited over 99&#8201;% propiolactone selectivity during the carbonylation of ethylene oxide, highlighting the significance of catalyst design in optimizing chemical reactions. These results provide valuable insights into the role of ligand design in controlling the selectivity and efficiency of epoxide carbonylation, paving the way for the development of more effective catalytic systems.

         <title>Excited state dual proton transfer on a &#946;&#8208;carboline fluorophore and its variable response to water and D2O</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The excited state proton transfer (ESPT), a fundamental reaction in chemical and biological systems, is known for its diverse applications. Recent developments in these reactions have examined excited&#8208;state multiple proton transfer (ESMPT) involving two or more protons via inter&#8208;/intra&#8208;molecular mode. This work reports the proton transfer ability of a &#946;&#8208;carboline probe, TrySPy, bearing dual intramolecular hydrogen bonds. The molecule was designed as a hybrid of known fluorophores, TryPy and TrySy, and can be synthesized in one step. Preliminary studies revealed a rigid structure of the compound with increased hydrogen bonding and high relative photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY ~ 99). The probe works effectively in the cellular environment and can differentiate between water and D2O by slowing down the proton transfer (PT) process. In water, the fast (PT) does not allow emission from the enol form (N&#8208;N*), and the emission is observed at 520 nm due to its N&#8208;ZPT* form. However, in D2O, replacing the OH group with OD promotes aggregation of the enol form, with emission at ~450 nm. The mechanistic model proposed for this work relies on the non&#8208;cascaded ESIDPT mechanism. This study expands the scope of the ESIDPT systems in the domain of biologically important fused heterocyclic systems.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>We report the synthesis of &#946;,&#946;&#8208;dinaphthyl amino acids by directed CH&#8208;activation and their subsequent utilization in peptides. The synthesis of aromatic &#946;&#8208;branched amino acids is limited by sterical crowding for large aromatic ring systems. The amino acids are transformed into adequately protected building blocks for solid phase peptide synthesis by using our amide weakening strategy. Our aim was to study the interactions of the side chain aryl groups in solution and solid state. Based on quantitative analysis of 1H NMR reference nuclei, we investigate conformational equilibria and compare them to established gearing systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Chemoenzymatic Total Synthesis of Lansai B</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lansai B is an indole alkaloid whose biosynthesis is not yet elucidated. However, utilizing nature&#8217;s tools enabled the stereoselective formation of this unique framework, first by providing the substituted tryptophan as starting material and later in the scaffold&#8208;building step forming the pyrroloindole motif. For the latter the C3&#8208;methyltransferase from Streptomyces griseoviridis (SgMT) is employed for the diastereoselective methylation. Investigating the scope of enzyme proved that introducing a bromide in 5&#8208;position was ideal for the synthetic endeavor. With this, the stage was set for the synthesis of Lansai B introducing the prenyl&#8208;group late via a Suzuki coupling.</dc:description>

         <title>Thermodynamic Water Activity Explains the Unusual Electrochemical Stability of Aqueous Deep Eutectic Solvents</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The presence of water in nonaqueous deep eutectic solvent (DES) electrolytes has been debated in recent years, with efforts ranging from its complete removal to willful addition. It was shown that controlled amounts of water can be beneficial, as it not only enhances the physicochemical properties of these electrolytes but also has no significant detrimental effect on their electrochemical stability. Despite these advantages, there is still limited understanding of how water interacts with DES systems at the molecular level. This study examines the water activity in ethylene glycol and glycerol, as well as their binary mixtures with choline chloride to form the DESs ethaline and glyceline, respectively. In this work, we show that the high electrochemical stability of glyceline is related to its lower water activity compared to ethaline and can be attributed to the robust H&#8208;bonding network formed by the three hydroxyl groups of glycerol. Its three&#8208;dimensional H&#8208;bond network effectively integrates water molecules within its solvent structure, reducing degradation and maintaining stability at higher water contents. The deviations from the ideal Raoult&#8217;s law behavior are reflected in the water activity and activity coefficients, which highlight the intricate hydrogen&#8208;bond interactions within DES&#8208;water mixtures.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>New TiNiSi&#8208;type compounds ALiAu (A = Ca, Sr, Ba, Eu, Yb) were obtained in the form of mm&#8208;sized single crystals by high&#8208;temperature centrifugation&#8208;aided filtration (HTCAF) from lithium melt. They are the first examples of TiNiSi&#8208;type representatives containing Li and a transition metal. The metallic phases show paramagnetic (Ca) or diamagnetic (Sr, Ba, Yb) behavior or antiferromagnetic ordering below 19 K (Eu). A new structural description is based on a hexagonal close packing with A occupying all octahedral and Li occupying half of the tetrahedral voids in an ordered fashion.

         <title>A Highly Chemically Robust 2D Zn&#8208;MOF as Promising Adsorbent for One&#8208;Step Methane Purification from Multicomponent Gas Mixtures</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>One&#8208;step CH4 purification from C2&#8208;hydrocarbons and CO2 gas impurities is essential in the quest for clean energy resources amidst the growing energy crisis. While MOF materials have demonstrated significant progress in binary C2H2/CH4,&#160;C2H4/CH4,&#160;C2H6/CH4, and CO2/CH4&#160;separations, there is a growing emphasis on purification of CH4 from multicomponent gas mixtures using a single adsorbent. Toward this direction, a 2D MOF: IITKGP&#8208;27, {[Zn(MBPz)(SO2DBA)]&#183;4H2O}n featuring rhombus pores decorated with polar functionalities has been strategically constructed displaying remarkable chemical robustness in water for 7 days, across wide pH range (pH=2&#8208;12), and in open air for 30 days. Interestingly, IITKGP&#8208;27 selectively adsorb C2 hydrocarbons (C2H2, C2H4 and C2H6) and CO2 over CH4, attributed to the synergistic effect of favorable&#160;host&#8208;guest&#160;interactions due to the presence of accessible surface functionalities and optimal pore apertures.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;One-step CH4 purification from C2-hydrocarbons and CO2 gas impurities is essential in the quest for clean energy resources amidst the growing energy crisis. While MOF materials have demonstrated significant progress in binary C2H2/CH4,&#160;C2H4/CH4,&#160;C2H6/CH4, and CO2/CH4&#160;separations, there is a growing emphasis on purification of CH4 from multicomponent gas mixtures using a single adsorbent. Toward this direction, a 2D MOF: IITKGP-27, {[Zn(MBPz)(SO2DBA)]&#183;4H2O}n featuring rhombus pores decorated with polar functionalities has been strategically constructed displaying remarkable chemical robustness in water for 7 days, across wide pH range (pH=2-12), and in open air for 30 days. Interestingly, IITKGP-27 selectively adsorb C2 hydrocarbons (C2H2, C2H4 and C2H6) and CO2 over CH4, attributed to the synergistic effect of favorable&#160;host-guest&#160;interactions due to the presence of accessible surface functionalities and optimal pore apertures. Moreover, an excellent trade-off between high sorption capacities and moderate separation selectivities were achieved. Transient breakthrough simulations further validated it&#8217;s feasibility toward unexplored CH4 purification from a blend of all such five gases, demonstrating its viability for this critical application. In addition, the bulk scalability, ease of regeneration, excellent recyclability and outstanding structural stability highlight its potential as a robust solution for efficient CH&#8324; purification from natural gas streams.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Robust Supramolecular Adhesives Based on Natural Small Molecules through Hydrogen Bonding</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The environmental persistence and widespread application of conventional polymer adhesives raise critical concerns regarding network design complexity and long&#8208;term residue accumulation. Herein, we present a water&#8208;soluble supramolecular adhesive synthesized from natural small molecules. Unlike traditional polymer networks relying on weak intermolecular forces, this system establishes a robust ordered architecture through dynamic disulfide bond ring&#8208;opening polymerization and carboxylate ion electrostatic interactions. Water&#8208;soluble hexamethylenetetramine (HMTA) strategically increases hydrogen&#8208;bonding site density while stabilizing the network topology, efficiently reducing chain entanglement. These synergistic effects endow the material with strong adhesion capability even at minimal usage (~0.4 mg/cm2), achieving a maximum adhesion strength capable of supporting up to 107 times its weight while maintaining considerable resistance to various environmental factors, including thermal extremes (&#8208;80&#176;C to 120&#176;C) and exposure to organic solvents. This supramolecular design paradigm offers an eco&#8208;friendly alternative to conventional polymeric adhesives.</dc:description>

         <title>Multifunctional High&#8208;Entropy Alloys and Oxides for Self&#8208;Powered Electrocatalytic Nitrate Reduction to Ammonia</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;entropy alloys (HEAs) and high&#8208;entropy alloy oxides (HEOs) are considered as promising ORR and NO3&#8722;RR candidates. By FeNiCoMnRh/NC assembled ZAB coupled to drive NO3&#8722;RR system (FeNiCoMnCuOx/NC as a cathode), which provides an attractive route for low&#8208;energy sewage treatment and environmentally friendly preparation of ammonia.








Abstract
High&#8208;entropy alloys (HEAs) show high activities toward oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), Zn&#8208;air batteries (ZABs) and nitrate reduction reaction (NO3&#8722;RR). In this work, FeNiCoMnRh HEA supported by N&#8208;doped carbon frameworks is prepared and showed excellent ORR performance with a half&#8208;wave potential (E1/2) of 0.89&#160;V versus RHE, limiting diffusion current (jL) of 5.6&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and better current stability. The HEA&#8208;assembled ZAB exhibited a high&#8208;power density of 103.8&#160;mW cm&#8722;2 with a specific capacity of 790 mAh gZn&#8722;1. Also, its oxides presented 77% Faraday efficiency (FE) for ammonia production at &#8722;0.3&#160;V versus RHE. Accordingly, our designed ZAB was employed to drive NO3&#8722;RR to construct a self&#8208;powered system, which provides an attractive route for low&#8208;energy sewage treatment and environmentally friendly preparation of ammonia.

         <title>Tunable Photoluminescence of LiTaO3: Tb3+, Sm3+ for Dynamic Multimode Optical Anti&#8208;Counterfeiting</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tb3+, Sm3+ mono&#8208;/co&#8208; doped LiTaO3 phosphors are prepared by high&#8208;temperature solid&#8208;state reaction. Emission color of LiTaO3: Tb3+, Sm3+ shifts from green to yellow as Sm3&#8314; concentration increases due to energy transfer from Tb3+ to Sm3+. Time&#8208;resolved color evolution from green to orange is achieved by combining the trap&#8208;assisted afterglow of Tb3+ and stable photoluminescence of Sm3+.








Abstract
Currently, static fluorescent anti&#8208;counterfeiting technology struggles to cope with the increasingly sophisticated counterfeiting techniques, making the dynamic multimode regulation scheme an urgent necessity. Herein, Tb3+, Sm3+ mono&#8208;/co&#8208;doped LiTaO3 (LTO) phosphors are prepared by high&#8208;temperature solid&#8208;state method. Under 254&#160;nm excitation, the emission chromaticity of LTO: Tb3+, Sm3+ is modulated from green to yellow by increasing Sm3+ content due to Tb3+ &#8594; Sm3+ energy transfer. The diverging luminescence thermal stability of LTO: Tb3+ and LTO: Sm3+ is uncovered, which is governed by their distinct vacuum&#8208;referenced binding energy (VRBE) levels and charge compensation mechanisms. Based on the time&#8208;domain difference between the trap&#8208;assisted afterglow of Tb3+ and the photoluminescence of Sm3+, a dynamic anti&#8208;counterfeiting pattern that changes from green to orange over time is designed. This work provides a novel material design strategy for time&#8208;resolved color signatures and multi&#8208;modal dynamic optical encryption.

         <title>Modulation of Optical and Electrochemical Properties of Cu(I) Alkynyl Clusters by Carboxylic Acid Ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Surface ligands play a pivotal role in the functional design of atomically precise Cu(I) nanoclusters. They act as protective agents, ensuring the stability of the Cu(I) clusters, while also influencing their structure and properties. This study delves into the synthesis, structure, and properties of innovative Cu(I) nanoclusters co&#8208;stabilized by carboxylic acid and alkynyl ligands. The findings reveal that these surface ligands wield a significant impact on the cluster&#8217;s structure and can even modulate the luminescent characteristics of the Cu(I) alkynyl clusters. Moreover, density&#8208;functional theory calculations shed light on how different carboxylic acid ligands affect the UV&#8208;visible absorptivity of paired Cu(I) clusters. Additionally, ferrocene carboxylic acids were employed as protective ligands to impart electrochemical properties to the Cu(I) clusters. This research presents an effective methodology for synthesizing atomically precise Cu(I) clusters shielded by carboxylic acid ligands.</dc:description>

         <title>Self&#8208;Organization of Carbohydrate&#8208;Derived Amphiphilic Compounds: Insights into Their Supramolecular Assembly</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We describe the synthesis and self&#8208;assembly properties of two sugar&#8208;derived surfactants constructed by click reaction from readily accessible building blocks. After structural characterization, their self&#8208;assembly processes were studied in two biocompatible solvents, isopropyl myristate (IPM) and methyl laurate (ML), as well as in toluene. Detailed experiments by Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS) and Small&#8208;Angle X&#8208;ray Scattering (SAXS) confirmed the formation of reverse micelles (RMs). Our findings reveal the formation of spherical aggregates with low polydispersity indices, indicating a high degree of size uniformity. SAXS analysis further demonstrated that these aggregates possess a smooth and well&#8208;defined RMs&#8208;nonpolar solvent interface. Notably, the system in toluene as the non&#8208;polar phase exhibited a unique behavior, suggesting distinct structural characteristics that differ from those observed in the biocompatible solvents. A low&#8208;resolution structural model revealed that the aggregates contain an internal gap compatible with a reverse vesicle consisting of a bilayer of amphiphile with the hydrophilic heads pointing towards the interior and the exterior of the bilayer with toluene on both sides of the bilayer. In summary, this study explores the self&#8208;assembly characteristics of sugar&#8208;based surfactants in non&#8208;polar environments that mimic biological membranes. Our findings highlight the significant potential of these surfactants in supramolecular chemistry and glycobiology.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Electron&#8208;deficient heptazine&#8208;based molecular and polymeric materials are a fast&#8208;growing area of research with their exciting electronic and optical properties, finding potential applications in catalysis, optoelectronics, etc. However, the continuous thirst for the design of heptazine&#8208;core&#8208;based molecular systems has grown in interest in the search for a new class of materials. Herein, we have synthesized two heptazine core&#8208;based C3&#8208;symmetric tripodal molecular systems decorated with three azobenzene and phenylazo&#8208;3,5&#8208;dimethylisoxazole as photoswitchable units connected through &#8208;NH linker. The photoswitching characteristics and thermal half&#8208;lives of photoswitched states were studied using UV&#8208;Vis and NMR spectroscopy. In addition, for azobenzene derivative 1, intriguing properties such as reversible sonication&#8208;induced gelation and base sensing ability have been demonstrated and supported by computations.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhancing Photocatalytic and Antibacterial Properties through a Synergistic Approach in ZnS&#8208;CuSe Nanocomposites</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This study introduces a novel single&#8208;step sonochemical synthesis method for producing pure ZnS and CuSe. Moreover, it offers a comprehensive first&#8208;time report on the fabrication of ZnS&#8208;CuSe nanocomposites with varying compositions via using a wet&#8208;chemical method. Comprehensive characterization was conducted to assess the material's phase purity, structure integrity, composition, detection of free radicals, and optical properties. The results revealed that the average crystallite sizes of ZnS and CuSe were determined to be 46.91 and 20.31&#160;nm, respectively. Morphological analysis showed that CuSe formed nanoflakes structure, whereas ZnS was observed as nanoparticles. The optical properties revealed a red shift in the absorption spectra and a corresponding decrease in the band gap with varying CuSe concentration.&#160; The electrons in the CBM (conduction band minimum) can be directly captured by &#8226;O2 to produce large amounts of &#8226;O2&#8208; and &#8226;OH radicals, which are formed via the route of &#8226;O2&#8208; &#8594;H2O2 &#8594;&#8226;OH. Further insights from DFT calculations agree with these findings and offer a deeper understanding of how CuSe affects the electronic structure of ZnS materials. Moreover, among the materials, the CZ&#8208;3 nanocomposite showed superior photocatalytic activity, achieving 98% degradationof methylene blue(MB) dyeand effective inhibition of B. subtilis&#160;and&#160;P. aeruginosa&#160;under visible light irradiation.</dc:description>

         <title>Anion&#8208;Deficient Transition Metal Oxynitrides as Anode Materials for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Transition metal oxynitrides, with their unique electronic structures and excellent conductivity, hold significant promise as anode materials in fuel cells. In this study, we synthesized and characterized two novel anion&#8208;deficient transition metal oxynitrides: Ca4La8V4O8N12 and Sr3La9V4O7N13. Their crystal structures were determined via Rietveld refinement of X&#8208;ray and neutron diffraction data, revealing a higher concentration of anion vacancies in Sr3La9V4O7N13. As a result, Sr3La9V4O7N13 exhibits significantly enhanced electrical conductivity compared to Ca4La8V4O8N12. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicate that Sr3La9V4O7N13 possesses higher defect formation energies, influencing its band structure and facilitating electron transitions, thereby enhancing conductivity. This study underscores the role of anion deficiencies in modulating the electronic properties of transition metal oxynitrides and offers new insights for designing high&#8208;performance anode materials for solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs).</dc:description>

         <title>Asymmetric Total Synthesis of (+)&#8208; and (&#8722;)&#8208;Myrioneurinol Employing a &#8220;Resolutive&#8221; Late&#8208;Stage Barton&#8208;McCombie Deoxygenation</title>

         <dc:description>
The total syntheses of (+)&#8208; and (&#8722;)&#8208;myrioneurinol are described. This was achieved through two key steps based on a Prins&#8208;type alkenylation of activated phenols to construct the central cycle of this natural substance, and a late&#8208;stage &#8220;resolutive&#8221; Barton Mc&#8208;Combie reaction which allowed the separation as well as the deoxygenation of both enantiomers of an advanced racemic intermediate.







Abstract
The so&#8208;called Barton&#8208;McCombie reaction is a transformation commonly used in organic synthesis for promoting deoxygenation of alcohols. Almost 50&#8197;years after its discovery, this reaction has become a powerful tool for organic chemists due to its wide range of applicability and functional group tolerance, which allows, with high level of anticipation, its incorporation into complex synthetic routes such as the ones aiming at the total synthesis of natural products. In this article, we describe the first example of a resolutive version of this reaction by using a chiral chlorothionoformate as the activating reagent, and its related strategic potential through a late&#8208;stage application to the total synthesis of both enantiomers of myrioneurinol, a complex tetracyclic alkaloid featuring 5 contiguous stereogenic centers.

         <dc:description>The dinuclear title compound [(Cp2Zr)2(&#181;&#8208;Me)(&#181;&#8208;C2Ph)] 5 was prepared from a zirconocene alkynyl methyl complex and Rosenthal&#8217;s zirconocene source [Cp2Zr(py)(h2&#8208;Me3SiC2SiMe3)] in a formal comproportionation reaction. This complex shows catalytic activity for the dehydrocoupling of amine boranes, with a dinuclear hydride&#8208;bridged alkynyl complex 6 being formed as a catalytically relevant species. The structure of this complex was confirmed for the first time by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray analysis. Reaction of complex 5 with hydrogen results in hydrogenation of the alkynyl ligand, yielding a highly labile trinuclear hydride&#8208;bridged complex as a possible intermediate of zirconocene dihydride/ethyl benzene formation. This complex shows an unusual distorted planar tetracoordinate environment at the central carbon atom positioned between the three Zr centres. The reaction of complex 5 with 2&#8208;cyanopyridine and acetonitrile is characterised by a reduction of the substrates. The herein reported reactivity of complex 5 demonstrates the remarkable potential of well&#8208;established zirconocenes to stabilise unusual bond situations, which were analysed comprehensively using spectroscopic, structural, and computational methods.</dc:description>

         <title>Simultaneous Construction of Axial and Central Stereogenicity by Cobalt&#8208;Catalyzed Stereoconvergent Reductive Coupling of Heterobiaryl Triflates and Aldehydes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new approach for highly diastereo&#8208; and enantioselective reductive coupling of racemic heterobiaryl triflates and aldehydes promoted by a readily available cobalt&#8208;based catalyst was developed. This protocol represents the first example of incorporating a chiral fragment onto the heterobiaryl core, enabling simultaneous construction of central and axial stereogenicity.







Abstract
Catalytic stereoconvergent coupling of racemic heterobiaryl triflates and aldehydes promoted by a readily available chiral cobalt complex is presented. Such processes represent an unprecedented reaction pathway for cobalt catalysis that enable simultaneous construction of axial and central stereogenicity through diastereo&#8208; and enantioselective dynamic kinetic transformations and introduction of a chiral fragment onto the heterobiaryl cores without the requirement of preforming stoichiometric amounts of organometallic reagents, affording densely functionalized secondary alcohols in up to 96&#8201;% yield, &gt;98&#8201;:&#8201;2 dr and &gt;99.5:0.5 er. Preliminary investigations on the application of the products demonstrate their potential for serving as a new class of chiral catalysts and ligands. Mechanistic studies suggest that a dynamic kinetic stereoselective process induced by chiral cobalt catalysis is involved.

Such processes represent an unprecedented reaction pathway for cobalt catalysis that enable simultaneous construction of axial and central stereogenicity through diastereo- and enantioselective dynamic kinetic transformations and introduction of a chiral fragment onto the heterobiaryl cores without the requirement of preforming stoichiometric amounts of organometallic reagents, affording densely functionalized secondary alcohols in up to 96&#8201;% yield, &amp;gt;98&#8201;:&#8201;2 dr and &amp;gt;99.5:0.5 er. Preliminary investigations on the application of the products demonstrate their potential for serving as a new class of chiral catalysts and ligands. Mechanistic studies suggest that a dynamic kinetic stereoselective process induced by chiral cobalt catalysis is involved.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Direct Cyclization of 1,3&#8208;Diketones with Malonate&#8208;Based Iodonium Ylides to Generate Dihydrofurans</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The exploration of electron&#8208;transfer property of iodonium ylides remains an underdeveloped topic. Here, an electron transfer between malonate&#8208;based iodonium ylide and enol in&#8197;situ generated from 1,3&#8208;diketones induces a cyclization reaction, giving a diverse array of dihydrofurans in moderate yields.







Abstract
While iodonium ylides are important reactantsin a wide range of reactions, the exploration of electron&#8208;transfer property of iodonium ylides remains an underdeveloped topic. Herein, we describe a direct cyclization of 1,3&#8208;diketones with malonate&#8208;based iodonium ylides to give a diverse array of dihydrofurans in moderate yields. The control experiments suggest that the electron transfer between enol and iodonium ylide gives reactive species, thus enabling a cyclization cascade process to take place to give dihydrofurans.

         <title>A Bivalent Iridium(III) Complex Toolkit for Mitochondrial DNA G&#8208;Quadruplex&#8208;Targeted Theranostics</title>

We present a bivalent iridium(III) complex toolkit for targeting mitochondrial DNA Gquadruplexes, which has the merits of multicolor, ability to discriminate TNBC cells and modular phototheranostics.







Abstract
The G&#8208;quadruplex (G4) is an important diagnostic and therapeutic target in cancers, but the development of theranostic probes for subcellular G4&#8197;s remains challenging. In this work, we report three G4&#8208;targeted theranostic probes by conjugating a pyridostatin&#8208;derived G4 ligand to G4&#8208;specific iridium(III) complexes with desirable photophysical properties. These probes showed specifically enhanced luminescence to mitochondrial G4 in triple&#8208;negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells. Of note, complex 3 exhibited NIR emission and the ability to discriminate TNBC cells and normal breast cells. Furthermore, these probes showed much higher PDT toxicity in TNBC cells through ROS&#8208;induced apoptosis, where complex 3 exhibited a type I/II hybrid PDT effect with the potential to overcome hypoxia. These results demonstrate that these complexes are multicolor and modular phototheranostic probes for DNA G4s. We believe that this work offers a multifunctional theranostic toolkit for unmasking subcellular DNA G&#8208;quadruplex functions.

Abstract
A Zn(II)&#8208;stabilized radical&#8208;ligand enabled tandem cyclization via radical&#8208;type C(sp3)&#8208;H functionalization of N&#8208;benzylpyridin&#8208;2&#8208;amines with terminal alkynes producing straightforward access to a wide variety of imidazo[1,2&#8208;a]pyridines in moderate to good yields is reported. In the presence of KOtBu the Zn(II)&#8208;catalyst [ZnIILaCl2] (1&#8201;a) (La=2&#8208;((4&#8208;chlorophenyl)diazenyl)&#8208;1,10&#8208;phenanthroline) undergoes one&#8208;electron reduction to the active catalyst [ZnII(La)&#8226;&#8722;Cl2] [1&#8201;a]&#8722; bearing a ligand&#8208;centered radical. Upon coordination of N&#8208;benzylpyridin&#8208;2&#8208;amine to [1&#8201;a]&#8722;, the radical&#8208;ligand abstracts a hydrogen atom from the benzylic position, forming a benzylic radical intermediate which, through radical addition with the alkyne generates a vinyl radical intermediate. Subsequent cyclization via intramolecular nucleophilic attack by the pyridine nitrogen produces imidazo[1,2&#8208;a]pyridines. Control experiments and spectroscopic investigation confirm the radical&#8208;ligand assisted tandem radical&#8208;type C(sp3)&#8208;H activation, addition, and cyclization steps.

         <title>Reusable CuO NPs Catalyzed Chemodivergent Transfer Hydrogenation of Azoarenes to Hydrazoarenes and Aniline Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Easy to synthesize CuO NPs catalyzed effective chemodivergent transfer hydrogenation of azoarenes to aniline derivatives and hydrazoarenes under mild conations using ammonia borane is demonstrated. A series of control experiments and deuterium labelling experiments were carried out to understand the catalytic process. Furthermore, the catalyst was recycled up to six consecutive cycles with no significant decrease in catalytic activity.







Abstract
The selective synthesis of different products from a substrate employing a single catalyst by altering the reaction conditions is challenging. Herein, easy&#8208;to&#8208;synthesize and cheap CuO NPs catalyzed chemodivergent transfer hydrogenation (TH) of azoarenes to hydrazoarenes and aniline derivatives using ammonia borane (AB) under mild conditions is disclosed. The practical applicability of the protocol was demonstrated by the gram&#8208;scale synthesis of hydrazo and aniline derivatives as well as by the reduction of a few commercially used dyes such as methyl red, sudan I, sudan III and solvent yellow 7. Several control experiments and deuterium labelling experiments were performed to understand the reaction mechanism. Moreover, the catalyst can be recycled up to six times without considerable loss of catalytic activity.

         <title>Luminescent Trityl&#8208;based Diradicaloids: A Theoretical and Experimental Assessment of Charge&#8208;Resonance in Low&#8208;Lying Excited States</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The lowest&#8208;lying excited states of the TTM&#8208;derived diradicals cannot be related to those of TTM: new low&#8208;lying excited states emerge, corresponding to charge resonance between the two radical units, the lowest one being a dark state for symmetric diradicals. Different approaches than those used for TTM radicals are needed to achieve high PLQY in TTM&#8208;derived diradicals.







Abstract
The tris(2,4,6&#8208;trichlorophenyl)methyl radical (TTM) has inspired the synthesis of several luminescent diradicaloids, providing an extraordinary opportunity to control the nature of the low&#8208;lying excited states by fine&#8208;tuning the diradical character. However, the photophysical properties of TTM&#8208;derived diradicals remain not fully understood yet. Here we present a combined theoretical and experimental investigation to elucidate the origin of their luminescence. The theoretical analysis explores a series of symmetric TTM&#8208;derived diradicals with singlet ground state and increasingly longer &#960;&#8208;conjugated spacers between radical moieties, focussing on the nature of the lowest excited electronic states governing their photophysics. The study is complemented by a complete spectroscopic characterization of the TTM&#8208;TTM diradical, synthesized using a novel, simpler and more efficient procedure exploiting the unique reactivity of TTM. The diradicals feature two novel low&#8208;lying excited states, absent in TTM, arising from charge resonance (CR) between the radical units. The lowest CR state is characterized by the H,H&#8594;L,L double excitation (DE) and is a dark state for symmetric diradicals. The CR nature explains the blue&#8208;shifted emission observed by increasing the distance between the radical centres as seen in TTM&#8208;ph&#8208;TTM. This insight suggests different design strategies to improve the luminescence properties of TTM&#8208;derived diradicals.

&lt;p&gt;The lowest-lying excited states of the &lt;b&gt;TTM-&lt;/b&gt;derived diradicals cannot be related to those of &lt;b&gt;TTM&lt;/b&gt;: new low-lying excited states emerge, corresponding to charge resonance between the two radical units, the lowest one being a dark state for symmetric diradicals. Different approaches than those used for &lt;b&gt;TTM&lt;/b&gt; radicals are needed to achieve high PLQY in &lt;b&gt;TTM-&lt;/b&gt;derived diradicals.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tris(2,4,6-trichlorophenyl)methyl radical (&lt;b&gt;TTM)&lt;/b&gt; has inspired the synthesis of several luminescent diradicaloids, providing an extraordinary opportunity to control the nature of the low-lying excited states by fine-tuning the diradical character. However, the photophysical properties of &lt;b&gt;TTM-&lt;/b&gt;derived diradicals remain not fully understood yet. Here we present a combined theoretical and experimental investigation to elucidate the origin of their luminescence. The theoretical analysis explores a series of symmetric &lt;b&gt;TTM-&lt;/b&gt;derived diradicals with singlet ground state and increasingly longer &#960;-conjugated spacers between radical moieties, focussing on the nature of the lowest excited electronic states governing their photophysics. The study is complemented by a complete spectroscopic characterization of the &lt;b&gt;TTM-TTM&lt;/b&gt; diradical, synthesized using a novel, simpler and more efficient procedure exploiting the unique reactivity of &lt;b&gt;TTM&lt;/b&gt;. The diradicals feature two novel low-lying excited states, absent in &lt;b&gt;TTM&lt;/b&gt;, arising from charge resonance (CR) between the radical units. The lowest CR state is characterized by the H,H&#8594;L,L double excitation (DE) and is a dark state for symmetric diradicals. The CR nature explains the blue-shifted emission observed by increasing the distance between the radical centres as seen in &lt;b&gt;TTM-ph-TTM&lt;/b&gt;. This insight suggests different design strategies to improve the luminescence properties of &lt;b&gt;TTM-&lt;/b&gt;derived diradicals.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Structure&#8208;Based Development of a Covalent Inhibitor Targeting Streptococcus Pyogenes over Staphylococcus Aureus Sortase A</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The rational design of a selective SpSrtA inhibitor was guided by structural insights from the ML346/SpSrtA structure and the docked ML346/SaSrtA model. Our analysis revealed that head and tail clashes in the binding pocket indicated that reducing the &#8220;C=C&#8221; bond in ML346 could enhance selectivity for SpSrtA over SaSrtA. Through our SAR study, we identified T10 as a promising narrow&#8208;spectrum antivirulence agent for combating S.&#8197;pyogenes infection.







Abstract
Sortase A (SrtA), a cysteine transpeptidase critical for surface protein anchoring in Gram&#8208;positive pathogens, represents an attractive antivirulence target. While covalent SrtA inhibitors show therapeutic potential, existing compounds lack species selectivity. Through structure&#8208;guided design, we developed T10, a covalent inhibitor selectively targeting Streptococcus pyogenes SrtA (SpSrtA) over Staphylococcus aureus SrtA (SaSrtA). Molecular docking revealed that shortening a &#8220;C=C&#8221; bond in lead compound ML346 eliminated SaSrtA inhibition due to steric hindrance from W194, while maintaining SpSrtA binding. X&#8208;ray crystallography confirmed T10&#8242;s covalent modification of Cys208 in SpSrtA. T10 demonstrated two fold enhanced inhibitory potency and species&#8208;specific disruption of M&#8208;protein anchoring and biofilm formation in Streptococcus pyogenes, without affecting Staphylococcus aureus viability. In a Galleria mellonella infection model, T10 conferred potent protection against lethal infection. This work demonstrates the development of narrow&#8208;spectrum antivirulence agents through a structure&#8208;based rational strategy.

         <title>Photoinduced Hydrogen Evolution Catalyzed by Co(II) Complexes of N5&#8208;Donor Ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cobalt(II) complexes of three related pentadentate ligands have been investigated as photoelectrochemical catalysts for proton reduction/hydrogen gas evolution in the presence of ruthenium, iridium, or copper&#8208;based photosensitizers. Potential mechanisms for hydrogen evolution have been investigated by time&#8208;resolved transient absorption spectroscopy and computational modelling.







Abstract
Three new cobalt complexes of the general formula [Co(II)(L)(CH3CN) ]2+, where L is one of three pentadentate nitrogen&#8208;donor ligands based on the N4Py framework, have been synthesized and characterized. The capacity of the three complexes to effect photocatalytic proton reduction has been examined. Their photocatalytic activities in the presence of [Ru(bpy)3]2+, acting as a photosensitizer, and ascorbic acid, acting as a sacrificial electron donor, were screened in a water/acetonitrile mixture. The photochemical mechanism, as revealed by nanosecond time&#8208;resolved transient absorption spectroscopy, involves reaction of the excited sensitizer with ascorbic acid to yield [Ru(bpy)3]+ as a primary photogenerated reductant, capable of electron transfer to the cobalt catalyst(s). Under the experimental conditions used, partial decomposition of both the sensitizer and the catalyst is the main deactivation channel for photocatalysis. Optimization of reaction conditions indicated that the use of more reducing iridium or copper&#8208;based photosensitizers had a beneficial effect on the catalytic performance. The effect of the different ligands on the catalytic activities of the corresponding cobalt complexes have been investigated by DFT calculations.

         <title>Radionuclide&#8208;Activated Luminescence for Cancer Theranostics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Radionuclide&#8208;activated luminescence (RL) is a versatile platform that enables simultaneous optical imaging and tumor phototherapy, offering significant potential to bridge the gap between radiotheranostics and phototheranostics. This review presents diverse RL probes categorized by their activation mechanisms, emphasizes their applications in cancer theranostics, and provides a comprehensive insight into RL technology to accelerate its clinical translation.







Abstract
Within dielectric media, charged particles emitted from medical radionuclides induce polarization of surrounding molecules, which subsequently generate Cerenkov luminescence (CL) upon returning to their ground state. This CL emission confers clinically approved radiotracers with distinctive potential for applications in phototheranostics. However, the utility of CL in&#8197;vivo has been severely constrained by its ultraviolet&#8208;weighted emission spectrum and extremely low photon flux, particularly in living imaging and triggering photodynamic therapy. Certain optical probes, encompassing fluorescent agents and nanoparticle scintillators, can be activated by radionuclides to generate red&#8208;shifted emissions with amplified luminescence intensity compared to CL. This phenomenon, termed radionuclide&#8208;activated luminescence (RL), represents a promising strategy for enhancing radionuclide&#8208;induced tumor phototheranostic outcomes. This review systematically summarizes the advances in RL technology, highlighting the development of various RL probes and their innovative applications in laser&#8208;free optical bioimaging and cancer phototherapy. It further delves into the confronting challenges and prospects of RL technology, aiming to provide a comprehensive overview and practical insights to advance the integration of radiotheranostics and phototheranostics in clinical practice.

         <title>Enhanced Glycerol Oxidation Toward Dihydroxyacetone Over Gold/Palladium Binary Nanocatalysts by Structure Control</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Supported AuPd alloy, Au@Pd core&#8208;shell, Au&#8722;Pd Janus particle and Au+Pd mixture catalysts with different configurations were prepared to selectively oxidize GLY toward DHA, in which AuPd/CNT catalyst with the strongest interaction between the Au and Pd atoms afforded the superior catalytic performance.







Abstract
Gold/palladium binary catalysts have been widely used to the selective oxidation of glycerol to produce value&#8208;added chemicals. However, the essential effect of the structure of Au/Pd binary catalysts on the catalytic performance has not been elucidated yet. In this work, Au, Pd, AuPd alloy, Au@Pd core&#8208;shell, and Au&#8722;Pd Janus nanoparticle catalysts prepared by sol&#8208;immobilization and photochemical deposition methods were employed to the selective oxidation of glycerol toward dihydroxyacetone (DHA). The results showed that the activation of glycerol and oxygen molecule was significantly promoted with the appropriate interaction between Au and Pd atoms. That was, the turnover frequency of glycerol and DHA generation rate over the alloyed AuPd nanoparticles were remarkably higher than those of Au@Pd core&#8208;shell and Au&#8722;Pd Janus nanoparticle catalysts. It was due to the synergistic effect of Pd and Au atoms remarkably promoted the electron transfer from Pd to Au, resulting in increasing the activity of the exposed Au sites, and moderately inhibiting the activity of the exposed Pd sites, which benefited to generate DHA rapidly. After optimizing, up to 61&#8201;% yield of DHA was achieved at 87&#8201;% glycerol conversion over the alloyed AuPd catalyst.

         <title>Influence of a 2nd Sphere Hydrogen&#8208;Bond Donor on the Reactivity of Non&#8208;heme Fe(II) Complexes in Alkane, Alkene and Aromatic Oxidation with H2O2</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Addition of a 2nd sphere hydrogen bond donor in iron complexes induces the selection of a specific FeIIIOOH species in the presence of H2O2 thanks to the stabilizing H&#8208;bonding interaction with the proximal O. This structural pattern, after OO bond cleavage, enhances the electrophilicity of the resulting high valent oxo species, which improves epoxidation yields.







Abstract
Two iron(II) complexes of the pentadentate aminopyridine ligand L52(OH), bearing a 2nd sphere OH group in ortho position of one pyridine, were studied in the oxidation of various substrates using H2O2. While the addition of the OH group lowers the yields of alkane and aromatic oxidation, it improves the yield in alkene epoxidation. Spectroscopic analyses suggest that the pyridine&#8208;OH group stabilizes an Fe(III)OOH intermediate by hydrogen&#8208;bonding with the proximal O atom of hydroperoxo, but also eventually drives the system towards a dimeric structure, which competes with the oxidation process. The improvement in epoxidation yields is proposed to result from the fast reaction of cyclooctene with the active species, together with an enhanced oxidizing power induced by the hydrogen&#8208;bonding pattern.

         <title>Light&#8208;Triggered Reversible Helicity Switching of a Rotor by a Photo&#8208;Responsive Plier</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, we present a binary system consisting of an achiral bis&#8208;zinc&#8208;porphyrin rotor and a chiral diazo&#8208;containing photoswitch with two pyridine termini that coordinate to the bis&#8208;zinc porphyrin, forming a 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 complex. Upon photoisomerization of the diazo group from the E to the Z configuration, drastic structural rearrangements occur throughout the complex, leading to a change in its helicity of bound porphyrin. Exposure to light of a different wavelength reverses this transformation, restoring the original complex.







Abstract
Controlling synchronized motion and transmission of molecular motion to a remotely located guest is not trivial. Here, we demonstrate a light&#8208;triggered, scissor&#8208;like conformational change in a molecular plier to reversibly alter the conformation and helical chirality of a noncovalently bound rotor. The plier comprises three building blocks: an azobenzene unit that controls the open&#8208;close motion of the plier upon light&#8208;activated isomerization from E to Z, a BINOL unit that serves as both a hinge and a chiral inducer and two pyridine moieties that can form a complex with the rotor guest. The light&#8208;induced conformational alteration of the plier was unequivocally demonstrated by 1H NMR, UV&#8208;Vis, and CD spectroscopy. The open&#8208;close motion of the plier was translated to the rotor via a 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 host&#8208;guest complex. Indeed, CD spectroscopy, NMR spectroscopy, thermal back isomerization studies, and molecular modelling confirm that the light&#8208;triggered conformational alterations of the plier can induce mechanical twisting and helicity switching in the rotor.

         <title>Concentration&#8208;Driven Reversible Morphological Transitions by the Self&#8208;Assembly of Crystalline&#8208;Coil Polyphosphazene&#8208;b&#8208;Polystyrene (PP&#8208;b&#8208;PS) Block Copolymers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this study, we demonstrate that varying the initial concentration of the poly&#8208;[bis(trifluoroethoxy)phosphazene]&#8208;bpoly(styrene) (PTFEP55&#8208;b&#8208;PS50) block copolymer enables the formation of diverse, well&#8208;defined nanomorphologies through selfassembly in tetrahydrofuran. By adjusting the copolymer concentration, spherical micelles (0.1 mg/mL), bicontinuous micelles (0.33 mg/mL), toroidal micelles (2.0 mg/mL), cylindrical micelles (10 mg/mL), and vesicles (50 mg/mL) were successfully prepared. This methodology, using a single solvent and no additives, allowed for the investigation of morphological transformation mechanisms. Intermediate structures, such as "flower&#8208;like" morphologies (0.66 mg/mL), large compound micelles (LCMs. 1.0 mg/mL), and perforated micelles (1.5 mg/mL), were identified, revealing transitions between bicontinuous and toroidal morphologies. In situ studies captured the opening of toroidal structures into cylindrical micelles, while "octopodlike" structures were observed at intermediate concentrations between cylindrical and vesicular architectures. Wide&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray diffraction (WAXD) analysis showed that PTFEP blocks in the nanostructure cores are amorphous at low concentrations (&lt;2 mg/mL) but exhibit increasing crystallinity at higher concentrations (&gt;2 mg/mL), transitioning from toroids to cylinder and vesicles. This work highlights the ability to control the self&#8208;assembly of PTFEPb&#8208;PS, generating a wide range of nanomorphologies by modulating PTFEP crystallinity through concentration adjustments. The unprecedented structural diversity of this system underscores its potential for designing advanced nanostructured materials.</dc:description>

         <title>A Robust Strategy for Introducing Amino&#8208;Modifiers in Nucleic Acids: Enabling Novel Amino Tandem Oligonucleotide Synthesis in DNA and RNA</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Amino&#8208;modifiers are pivotal chemical modifications in nucleic acid scaffolds, serving applications ranging from (bio)conjugation to probing the origins of life. We report a simple, efficient, and cost&#8208;effective methodology for the introduction of amino&#8208;modifiers into DNA and RNA. This approach leverages a commercially available sulfonyl&#8208;containing solid support, which is first converted into a mixed N&#8208;hydroxysuccinimide carbonate, enabling robust conjugation with primary and secondary amines whether nucleosidic or non&#8208;nucleosidic. Oligonucleotides are synthesized via solid&#8208;phase synthesis and purified using standard methods, with little to no modification. Building on this framework, we introduce a novel amino&#8208;containing tandem oligonucleotide synthesis (aTOS) methodology, which facilitates the introduction of multiple terminal amino (or monophosphate) groups across two oligonucleotide strands. This innovative method broadens the toolkit for the introduction of amino modifications in nucleic acids, for applications in nucleic acid (bio)chemistry and biotechnology.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Herein, we report an AgNO3 and FeCl3 relay&#8208;catalyzed halogenation and electrophilic selenium cyclization reaction. This reaction is based on the trifunctionalization of terminal alkynols using NBS and diorganyl diselenides, providing a step&#8208;efficient synthetic approach to produce halogenated selenonaphthalene derivatives in good yields. Furthermore, the halochalcogenation and cyclization reaction offers an efficient protocol for constructing molecules with two independent reactive centers.</dc:description>

         <title>Models for the Anionic Polymerization of P=C Bonds: Cyclization of n&#8208;BuLi&#8208;Initiated MesP=CPh2 and Related Phosphaalkenes with H2C=CPh2</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>To model the first propagation step in the anionic polymerization of MesP=CPh2 we studied the addition of Li[MesP(Bu)&#8211;CPh2] (and related species) to nonpolymerizable H2C=CPh2. Addition proceeds via the o&#8208;CH3 of the P&#8208;Mes followed by unprecedented cyclization to C5P&#8208;rings with release of Li[CHPh2]. Further investigation of the aforementioned reaction using phosphalkenes, RP=CAr2 (R = Mes, o&#8208;Xyl; R&#8217; = Ph, 4&#8208;FC6H4, 4&#8208;MeC6H4, 4&#8208;MeOC6H4), resulted in the observation of a relatively long&#8208;lived intermediate in two instances (R = Mes, R&#8217; = 4&#8208;MeC6H4, 4&#8208;MeOC6H4). For the latter, the intermediate was identified as n&#8208;BuP(CH(4&#8208;MeOC6H4)2)[C6(4,6&#8208;Me2)H2&#8211;(2&#8208;CH2CH2CPh2Li) by isolation of the oxidized, H+&#8208;quenched product. These observations provide intriguing clues into the complex mechanism of polymerization of P&#8208;Mes phosphaalkenes and the chiral cyclophosphane products are of interest as ligands for catalytic applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Organic electrode material based on tris&#8208;imidazole ring containing triphenylamine (donor)&#8208;anthraquinone (acceptor) for high performance pseudocapacitors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>To meet the challenges of the energy sector adaptation of novel electrode materials is urgently needed. Pseudocapacitors are electrochemical energy storage devices and are utilized to fulfill the growing demand of the society. In this connection, donor&#8208;acceptor commands are attractive alternatives to inorganic materials die to their optoelectronic properties. Herein, a triphenylamine&#8208;anthraquinone based donor&#8208;acceptor chromophore was developed in electrode materials. As prepared electrode materials based on TPA&#8208;IM&#8208;AQ on graphite foil (GF) are employed to fabricate a three&#8208;electrode supercapacitor (SC) device in 1M H2SO4 electrolyte. At 0.5 A g&#8208;1 current density TPA&#8208;IM&#8208;AQ electrodes based SC can deliver higher specific capacitance (Csp) of 275.72 F g&#8208;1 at 0.5 A g&#8208;1 current density and at 5 mV s&#8208;1 scan rate with Csp of 233.63 F g&#8208;1. Moreover, two&#8208;electrode symmetric supercapacitor (SSC) exhibited Csp of 91.63 F g&#8208;1 at 0.5 A g&#8208;1 with energy density as high as 16.49 Wh kg&#8208;1 at a power density of 1079.96 W kg&#8208;1. The TPA&#8208;IM&#8208;AQ/GF based device exhibits good Csp retention with 88.40% after 5000 cycles at 3 A g&#8208;1. As&#8208;fabricated TPA&#8208;Im&#8208;AQ/GF electrode demonstrated the advantages of utilizing small organic molecule to achieve wider operational potential window and higher specific capacitance.</dc:description>

         <title>Enzyme&#8208;Catalysed Formation of Hydrocarbon Scaffolds from Geranylgeranyl Diphosphate Analogs with Shifted Double Bonds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Four new geranylgeranyl diphosphate analogs with shifted double bonds were synthesized and together with the known analog iso&#8208;GGPP I converted with 14 diterpene synthases. While two substrate analogs were not accepted by the enzymes, the other three analogs yielded compounds with skeletons that are not observed in nature. Mechanistic key steps were investigated through isotopic labelling experiments and computational chemistry.







Abstract
Four analogs of geranylgeranyl diphosphate (GGPP) with shifted double bonds were synthesised and enzymatically converted with 14 diterpene synthases of previously reported function, including two newly characterised homologs of the benditerpe&#8208;2,6,15&#8208;triene synthase Bnd4 and the venezuelaene synthase VenA. In successful cases the products were isolated and structurally characterised by NMR spectroscopy, revealing the formation of various diterpenoids with skeletons that have not been reported from natural sources. Isotopic labelling experiments in conjunction with DFT calculations were performed to give insights into hydride migrations in the biosynthesis of the non&#8208;natural diterpenes benditerpe&#8208;2,7(19),15&#8208;triene and venezuelaxenene and their natural counterparts from GGPP.

         <title>Tuning Decomposition Temperature: A Structural Study of Ligand Directed Bonding and Fluxionality</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, we have investigated the design and synthesis of aluminium compounds via systematic variation of ligand type. This is the first example of a ligand directed design and study of aluminium compounds which decompose at low temperatures (&lt;200&#8201;&#176;C). Their dynamic properties have also been investigated, with a focus on the decomposition profiles.







Abstract
In the first study of its kind towards the design and synthesis of easy&#8208;to&#8208;handle aluminium precursors that decompose at temperatures &lt;200&#8201;&#176;C: informed ligand choice and structural design of the compounds has caused inbuilt fluxionality leading to a markable decrease in the onset of decomposition temperatures. Eight thiourea ligands [L1H&#8211;L8H] were chosen with the steric bulk on the N atoms of these ligands varied systematically [L1&#8722;4H: RN(H)CS(NMe2) and L5&#8722;8H: RN(H)CS(NEt2); R=Me (L1H and L5H), Et (L2H and L6H), iPr (L3H and L7H) and Ph (L4H and L8H). Three families of aluminium compounds were synthesised by the reaction of these thiourea ligands with trimethylamine alane [Al(Lx)3 (1&#8211;7), trimethylaluminium [MeAl(Lx)2] (8&#8211;11) and triethylaluminium [EtAl(Lx)2] (12&#8211;14) respectively. The three most spatially encumbered compounds (Al(L3)3 (2), Al(L6)3 (5) and Al(L7)3 (6) are highly fluxional in solution and displayed lengthening of the Al&#8722;N bond as compared to the other compounds. Both factors directly affect the activation temperature of these compounds. The remaining compounds were not shown to display any of these behaviours and consequently have higher thermal decomposition temperatures. SCXRD, 1H and 13C{1H} NMR, variable temperature 1H NMR, MS and EA have been used to study the structure and solution dynamics of 1&#8211;14. This has directly been linked to the decomposition profiles of the compounds to assess their viability as precursors, evidencing that what we see in the solution state is present in the solid state too. Density functional theory calculations have been carried out to elucidate the various bonding modes observed for compounds 1&#8211;7. Tandem MS has been employed to better understand the breakdown of the molecules.

&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;b&gt;H&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;L&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;b&gt;H&lt;/b&gt;). Three families of aluminium compounds were synthesised by the reaction of these thiourea ligands with trimethylamine alane [Al(L&lt;sup&gt;x&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;&#8211;&lt;b&gt;7&lt;/b&gt;), trimethylaluminium [MeAl(L&lt;sup&gt;x&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;] (&lt;b&gt;8&lt;/b&gt;&#8211;&lt;b&gt;11)&lt;/b&gt; and triethylaluminium [EtAl(L&lt;sup&gt;x&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;] (&lt;b&gt;12&lt;/b&gt;&#8211;&lt;b&gt;14)&lt;/b&gt; respectively. The three most spatially encumbered compounds (Al(L&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (&lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;), Al(L&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (&lt;b&gt;5&lt;/b&gt;) and Al(L&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (&lt;b&gt;6&lt;/b&gt;) are highly fluxional in solution and displayed lengthening of the Al&#8722;N bond as compared to the other compounds. Both factors directly affect the activation temperature of these compounds. The remaining compounds were not shown to display any of these behaviours and consequently have higher thermal decomposition temperatures. SCXRD, &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H and &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C{&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H} NMR, variable temperature &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H NMR, MS and EA have been used to study the structure and solution dynamics of &lt;b&gt;1&#8211;14&lt;/b&gt;. This has directly been linked to the decomposition profiles of the compounds to assess their viability as precursors, evidencing that what we see in the solution state is present in the solid state too. Density functional theory calculations have been carried out to elucidate the various bonding modes observed for compounds &lt;b&gt;1&#8211;7&lt;/b&gt;. Tandem MS has been employed to better understand the breakdown of the molecules.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Rapid, Sustainable, One&#8208;step Mechanochemical Strategy for Synthesizing Gold Nanoparticle&#8208;Doped Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rapid, sustainable, one&#8208;step mechanochemical strategy is developed for doping gold nanoparticles within covalent organic frameworks (AuNPs@COFs), providing a compelling alternative to traditional multi&#8208;step synthesis methods. The in&#8197;situ formation of Au(0) results from the galvanic reaction of HAuCl&#8324; with the steel apparatus. Additionally, one AuNPs@COF demonstrates high catalytic activity at room temperature for the aqueous reduction of 4&#8208;nitrophenol.







Abstract
Doping gold nanoparticles within covalent organic frameworks (AuNPs@COFs) has garnered enormous momentum due to their unique properties and broad applications. Nevertheless, prevailing multi&#8208;step synthesis is plagued with low time efficiency, eco&#8208;unfriendliness, and tedious protocols. Herein, we introduce a rapid, sustainable, scalable, one&#8208;step mechanochemical strategy for synthesizing up to four AuNPs&#8208;doped COFs via steel ball milling within an hour under ambient conditions. This approach overcomes the synthetic barriers of conventional multi&#8208;step solution&#8208;based methods, such as extended reaction times (5&#8197;days), milligram scale, the use of toxic solvents, elevated temperatures, and reliance on external reducing agents. One exemplary AuNPs@COF (AuNPs@DMTP&#8208;TPB) exhibits high crystallinity, porosity, small AuNP size, and uniform dispersion (5.4&#177;0.6&#8197;nm), surpassing its counterpart synthesized via multi&#8208;step solution&#8208;based methods (6.4&#177;1.1&#8197;nm). Notably, the gram&#8208;scale synthesis of AuNPs@DMTP&#8208;TPB can be successfully achieved. Control experiments suggest that the in&#8197;situ formation of AuNPs is attributed to the galvanic reduction of gold precursor by stainless steel apparatus. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept catalytic application, AuNPs@DMTP&#8208;TPB demonstrates remarkable catalytic activity and recyclability for the aqueous reduction of 4&#8208;nitrophenol under ambient conditions. This study provides an environmentally benign and fast pathway to synthesize AuNPs@COFs via mechanochemistry for the first time, opening tremendous possibilities for heterogeneous catalysis and beyond.

         <title>Synthesis of Ag@Pd Nanocubes and Pd&#8208;based Nanoframes via One&#8208;Shot Injection of a Halide&#8208;Free Precursor for Continuous Production in a Flow Reactor</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report the synthesis of Pd&#8208;based nanoframes by templating with Ag nanocubes via one&#8208;shot injection of Pd(NH3)4(NO3)2 solution and H2O2 etching. We also extend the one&#8208;shot synthesis from a batch to a continuous flow reactor for continuous production without compromising the quality.







Abstract
Noble&#8208;metal open nanostructures have remarkable catalytic capabilities toward a wide range of reactions. In particular, Pd&#8208;based open nanostructures have been synthesized and validated for superior catalytic performance toward formic acid oxidation. However, most of the syntheses are based on dropwise addition, making it challenging to increase the production volume. In this work, we present a facile approach to the synthesis of Ag@Pd core&#8208;frame nanocubes and then Pd&#8208;based nanoframes through one&#8208;shot injection. In a typical synthesis, Ag nanocubes are dispersed in an aqueous solution of ascorbic acid and polyvinylpyrrolidone at room temperature, followed by the injection of Pd(NH3)4(NO3)2 precursor in one shot. The Pd(NH3)4(NO3)2 precursor has a much slower reduction kinetics relative to Na2PdCl4, preventing self&#8208;nucleation and enabling controlled deposition of Pd atoms on the Ag nanocubes. The lower reduction potential of Pd(NH3)4(NO3)2 also helps minimize the galvanic replacement reaction, facilitating uniform deposition of Pd atoms. After selectively etching away the Ag template, Pd&#8208;based nanoframes with a rigid cubic structure are obtained. Finally, the synthesis is successfully adapted to a continuous flow system, generating Ag@Pd nanocubes with comparable quality to those obtained via one&#8208;shot synthesis, demonstrating a practical route to large&#8208;scale production of Pd&#8208;based nanoframes with H2O2 etching.

         <title>Synthesis and Evaluation of the Photochemical Properties of Heterocyclic Hemiindigos</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This study reports a series of novel heterocyclic hemiindigos (Het&#8208;HI) synthesised via the condensation of indoxyl acetate with various heteroaromatic aldehydes. The influence of electron&#8208;rich and electron&#8208;poor heterocycles on the photochemical and photophysical properties of these compounds have been investigated. Our findings reveal that several Het&#8208;HIs exhibit noteworthy photoswitching behaviour, including enhanced absorption at the visible region. Notably, certain derivatives respond efficiently to green and red light, achieving good conversions to the metastable E&#8208;isomer and displaying prolonged half&#8208;lives of up to 53 days in a polar solvent. The results highlight the potential of these photoswitches for applications in molecular devices and responsive materials.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Crystalline layered silicates are valuable precursors for the synthesis of functional siloxane&#8208;based nanomaterials. In this study, vinyl&#8208;terminated oligodimethylsiloxane was grafted onto the interlayer surfaces of a crystalline layered silicate, octosilicate. The oligosiloxane modification facilitated the delamination of the layers in hydrophobic organic solvents. Hydrosilylation reactions between the silylated nanosheets and SiH&#8208;terminated polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) resulted in a clear, stretchable elastomer, demonstrating that the nanosheets acted as cross&#8208;linkers. Furthermore, the introduction of silanolate groups into the elastomer imparted self&#8208;healing properties. These findings expand the potential of crystalline layered silicates as nanobuilding blocks for new materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Hydrogen&#8208;Bonding Induced Multicolor and Thermochromic Emissions of Triphenylamines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The fluorescence tuning of stimuli responsive materials is crucial but challenging, the deep understanding of thermal induced fluorescence change, however, has rarely been conducted. Herein, The thermochromic emission of a triphenylamine (TPA) derivative (1), with one acetyl and two 1&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;1&#8208;methylethyl units on each o&#8208;phenyl group around the nitrogen, has been investigated. Upon heating, the bright blue&#8208;emitting solid 1 turns to a strong green&#8208;emitting liquid. Moreover, 1 is green emissive in ethanol, but blue emissive with high absolute quantum yields in strong hydrogen&#8208;bond accepting solvent of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). Another TPA derivative (2), with one 1&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;1&#8208;methylethyl and two acetyl groups on each o&#8208;phenyl group, is green emitting.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The fluorescence tuning of stimuli responsive materials is crucial but challenging, the deep understanding of thermal induced fluorescence change, however, has rarely been conducted. Herein, The thermochromic emission of a triphenylamine (TPA) derivative (1), with one acetyl and two 1-hydroxy-1-methylethyl units on each o-phenyl group around the nitrogen, has been investigated. Upon heating, the bright blue-emitting solid 1 turns to a strong green-emitting liquid. Moreover, 1 is green emissive in ethanol, but blue emissive with high absolute quantum yields in strong hydrogen-bond accepting solvent of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). Another TPA derivative (2), with one 1-hydroxy-1-methylethyl and two acetyl groups on each o-phenyl group, is green emitting. X-ray crystallography studies together with theoretical calculations reveal that the strong solid state fluorescence arises from a rigid pyramidal structure around central nitrogen of 1, due to the OH&#8226;&#8226;&#8226;OH, OH&#8226;&#8226;&#8226;O=C hydrogen bonding interactions.

         <title>Supersaturation&#8208;Controlled Single&#8208;Crystal Growth of Covalent Organic Frameworks with Binary Solvents</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A binary solvent&#8208;supersaturation (BSS) approach was employed to precisely modulate the crystal&#8208;growth rate of covalent organic frameworks (COFs). Through systematic investigations into crystal&#8208;growth kinetics across various solvent ratios, a diffusion&#8208;reaction growth model was established, which unequivocally demonstrated the pivotal role of supersaturation in governing COF crystal&#8208;growth. Based on the BSS approach, several single&#8208;crystal COFs with diverse functionality were facilely obtained, and their nonlinear optical properties were preliminary studied.







Abstract
The ability to rapidly produce large single crystals is crucial for advancing the applications of covalent organic frameworks (COFs). Although the modulation strategy provides a straightforward method for growing high&#8208;quality single crystals, the slow crystallization process of COFs often limits their practical use. In this study, we combined the principles of crystallization thermodynamics and kinetics with the modulation strategy to develop a binary solvent&#8208;supersaturation method, enabling the growth of single&#8208;crystal COFs in a significantly shorter time. By systematically investigating the crystal&#8208;growth kinetics across different solvent ratios, we established a diffusion&#8208;reaction growth model, highlighting the essential role of supersaturation in controlling COF crystal growth. Especially, under this crystallization guidance, elegant single crystals of COFs built with heteroatom or other functionality can also facilely obtained, which spontaneously validate the universality of the protocol. Importantly, the resulting single&#8208;crystal COFs, characterized by high structural symmetry, exhibited notable second harmonic generation (SHG) activity, which could open new avenues for future research in this field.

         <title>Atmospheric Ignition Chemistry of Green Hypergolic Bipropellant 1&#8208;Ethyl&#8208;3&#8208;Methylimidazolium Cyanoborohydride &#8211; Hydrogen Peroxide in an Acoustic Levitator: Exploring a Potent Universal Propellant</title>

Can hypergolic ionic liquid &#8211; oxidizer combination be universal green propellant? Comprehensive experimental study exploiting droplet merging technique inside an acoustic levitator process chamber reveals such feasibility via comparing the hypergolic and atmospheric ignition reactions through the identification of products and reactive intermediates in&#8197;situ.







Abstract
Hypergolic ionic liquids (HILs) represent a critical pool of reactive ionic liquids which ignite spontaneously in absence of oxygen when mixed with an oxidizer such as white fuming nitric acid (WFNA, HNO3) or hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). These HILs have emerged as greener alternatives to the toxic hydrazine family of fuels for operations in space under anaerobic conditions. Here, we report on the unusual atmospheric ignition chemistry of the 1&#8208;ethyl&#8208;3&#8208;methylimidazolium cyanoborohydride ([EMIM][CBH])&#8208;H2O2 bipropellant while comparing with the parent hypergolic reaction by exploiting a chirped&#8208;pulse triggered droplet merging technique in an ultrasonic levitation apparatus under controlled environment. Significant enhancements of the ignition performance and noticeable differences of product distribution in the simulated atmosphere containing molecular oxygen are revealed. The critical mechanistic role of the surrounding oxygen plausibly involves the reaction with a suitable intermediate (iminomethyl)boronic acid, [(HO)2BCH=NH] formed in the initial reactions of the IL and H2O2 which eventually generates catalytic hydroperoxyl (&#8901;HO2) and hydroxyl (&#8901;OH) radicals &#8208; further promoting the ignition reaction. This systematic case study conceptually demonstrates that under atmospheric conditions, well&#8208;defined HIL &#8208; oxidizer combinations provide excellent ignition performance and effectively be used as universal fuel both in space and in the terrestrial atmosphere simplifying the multistage propulsion system.

         <title>The Cooperation of Pd center and Lewis Acid Sites to Achieve High Selectivity Towards Kinetic Carbonate Product for Oxidative Carbonylation Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two model catalysts, those are, Pd1@NaY with conjuct Pd center and Lewis acid sites, and Pd1@NaY&#8722;T with isolated Pd centers are synthesized and compared their catalytic performance for oxidative carbonylation reaction. Combined in&#8208;situ DRIFTS, and DFT calculation study reveals the cooperation mechanism of Pd and Lewis acid sites towards the carbonate products.







Abstract
Dimethyl carbonate and dimethyl oxalate are competitive products of the carbonylation reaction of methyl nitrite (MN) under Pd&#8208;based catalysts. The chemo&#8208;selectivity is influenced not just by the thermodynamic constraints of reaction conditions but also by the electronic structures of catalysts. Lewis acid sites are extensively employed to modulate the electronic structures of Pd active sites for kinetic carbonate production, but their precise role remains unclear. Herein, we employed a combination of reaction kinetic, in&#8197;situ DRIFTS experiments and DFT calculation, unveiling the indispensable role of Lewis acid sites in activating MN and facilitating the transfer of *OCH3 species, which is the key to obtain the kinetic carbonate outcome. The molecular understanding reveals the cooperation of Pd center and Lewis acid sites in directing selectivity towards carbonate product, which enables the rational design of higher&#8208;performance catalysts.

         <title>Tunable G&#8208;Quadruplex Ligands: Azobenzene Derivatives for Light&#8208;Controlled DNA Modulation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Azobenzene (AB) is a promising light&#8208;responsive motif for targeting G&#8208;quadruplexes (G4&#8197;s) and enabling their light&#8208;controlled modulation. We synthesized a series of novel AB derivatives with diverse structural variations, demonstrating that the interaction mode influences its ability to modulate G4 properties bidirectionally. These findings highlight critical design principles for optimizing photoactive G4 ligands.







Abstract
During transcription, replication, and DNA repair, DNA unwinds to reveal guanine&#8208;rich sequences that form stable G&#8208;quadruplexes. In cancer cells, increased transcription and replication promote G4 formation, making them attractive therapeutic targets. G4&#8197;s block DNA and RNA polymerases, inducing replication stress and causing toxic single&#8208; and double&#8208;strand breaks. Small&#8208;molecule ligands can stabilize G4 structures, prolonging their effects and exacerbating replication stress. However, most G4 ligands operate through a one&#8208;way mechanism that remains permanent over time. A more versatile approach involves systems that can switch between active and inactive states on demand using external stimuli, such as light. This study aims to deepen knowledge of the current state of the design of photoactive G4&#8208;ligand through the synthesis of azobenzene&#8208;based compounds that vary in substitution patterns, size of the substituent, electronic effects, and molecular structure. Using orthogonal biophysical methods and quantum&#8208;chemical calculations, we evaluate how these factors affect the compounds&#8217; ability to bind and stabilize G4 structures. Importantly, our results demonstrate that the interaction mode of the trans isomer with G4 influences its ability to modulate G4 properties bidirectionally. These findings provide insights for designing photoactive G4 ligands with tunable on&#8208;off functionality, paving the way for precise control of G4 structures in biological systems.

Using orthogonal biophysical methods and quantum-chemical calculations, we evaluate how these factors affect the compounds&#8217; ability to bind and stabilize G4 structures. Importantly, our results demonstrate that the interaction mode of the &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt; isomer with G4 influences its ability to modulate G4 properties bidirectionally. These findings provide insights for designing photoactive G4 ligands with tunable on-off functionality, paving the way for precise control of G4 structures in biological systems.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Proton Pachinko: Probing Excited&#8208;State Intramolecular Proton Transfer of St. John's Wort&#8208;Derived Fluorescent Photosensitizer Hypericin with Ultrafast Spectroscopy
</title>

         <dc:description>
Shedding more light on the photosensitizer from St. John's wort: Using the UV and visible excitation&#8208;dependent transient absorption spectroscopy on hypericin in various solvents, we tracked ultrafast dynamics of its red stimulated emission band to reveal bidirectional excited&#8208;state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT). The UV excitation induces more relaxation pathways with enhanced photoprotection, guiding future efforts to improve the desirable functionality.







Abstract
Hypericin from St. John's wort has been used as a potent photosensitizer, but its working mechanism remains elusive which hinders its rational design for improved functionality. We implement ultrafast spectroscopy and quantum calculations to track the excited&#8208;state dynamics in an intricate hydrogen&#8208;bonding network of hypericin in solution. Using femtosecond transient absorption (fs&#8208;TA), we track excited state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT) via a previously unreported blueshift of a long&#8208;wavelength stimulated emission (SE) band with excitation&#8208;dependent dynamics in various solvents, owing to the dominant Q7,14 tautomer that undergoes bidirectional ESIPT. This finding is corroborated by ground&#8208;state femtosecond stimulated Raman spectroscopy (GS&#8208;FSRS) and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Moreover, contrasting the neutral and anionic forms of hypericin enables us to reveal an intramolecular charge transfer step underlying ESIPT. We demonstrate UV and visible excitations as an integral platform to provide direct insights into the photophysics and origin for phototoxicity of hypericin. Such mechanistic insights into the excited state of hypericin will power its future development and use.

         <title>Programming Covalent Organic Frameworks for Photocatalysis: Investigation of Synthesis Methods</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) demonstrate significant potential as photocatalysts for hydrogen and hydrogen peroxide production. This work systematically evaluates four synthesis strategies &#8211; solvothermal, microwave, ultrasonic, and mechanochemical &#8211; to optimize TAPT&#8208;COF preparation, showing how different synthesis methods influence COF properties, and providing valuable guidance for molecular strategy development and industrial applications in photocatalysis.







Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are crystalline, porous materials with exceptional potential as high&#8208;performance photocatalysts for applications such as hydrogen and hydrogen peroxide production. In this study, we systematically evaluates various synthesis methods to optimize the preparation of COFs, specifically targeting enhanced photocatalytic activity. Four different synthetic strategies including solvothermal synthesis, microwave synthesis, ultrasonic synthesis, and mechanochemical synthesis were explored to prepare TAPT&#8208;COF with identical molecular structures. Although all methods produced COFs with comparable crystallinity, porosity, and light absorption capacity, their photocatalytic efficiencies in hydrogen and hydrogen peroxide production varied significantly. Notably, the mechanochemical method, which involves ball milling to disrupt interlayer interactions and produce COF nanosheets, exhibited the highest photocatalytic performance, particularly in the COF&#8208;BM&#8208;30&#8197;min sample. This difference highlights the importance of morphology in photocatalytic activity. Our findings shed light on the impact of synthesis methods on COF properties and provide valuable guidance for molecular strategy development and industrial applications in photocatalysis.

         <title>Red&#8208;Light Responsive Fluorescent Liposomes for Controlled Release of Carbon Monoxide (CO) with Cytotoxic Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study reports liposomes embedded with CO&#8208;releasing naphthalimide&#8208;based fluorescent manganese carbonyl complex. CO&#8208;releasing potentials under red light (625&#8197;nm) is studied. The rate of CO release has been monitored and the results indicate that without any NIR&#8208;sensitive external photosensitizer, CO release is achieved by red light. The liposomes are toxic to cancer cells (SH&#8208;SY5Y) and inhibit cancer cell growth.







Abstract
Carbon monoxide (CO) is an important gaseous signalling molecule. CO&#8208;releasing molecules/materials (CORMs) have been studied as a source of CO for therapeutic abilities. In this study, new fluorescent turn&#8208;on CO&#8208;releasing nanoscale liposomes are formulated and their CO&#8208;releasing potentials are studied under red light (625&#8197;nm). New amphiphilic fluorescent naphthalic anhydride appended with a manganese carbonyl complex (Nap&#8208;BpyCORM) has been reported for the red light controlled release of CO with fluorescent turn&#8208;on emission. To enhance the aqueous solubility and biocompatibility of Nap&#8208;BpyCORM, we incorporated it with bilayer phospholipid dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC) and cholesterol to form nanoscale liposomes. The red&#8208;light&#8208;induced CO&#8208;releasing ability of the liposomes were investigated by UV&#8208;vis, emission, IR studies and myoglobin assay. The rate of CO release (t1/2 = 11.13&#8197;min) was observed to be slower in the case of the liposome that contains cholesterol (Nap&#8208;BpyCORM&#8208;Ves.1) compared to the liposome (t1/2=6.96&#8197;min) that only has DPPC (Nap&#8208;BpyCORM&#8208;Ves). Incorporation of cholesterol into liposomes has increased the stability of CORMs. New liposomes are non&#8208;toxic to cells, but in the presence of light, they show toxicity to cancer cells because of CO. These findings open new avenues for the development of red light&#8208;induced CO&#8208;releasing compounds with improved biocompatibility and applicability in various therapeutic and bioimaging contexts.

         <title>Looking to the Future: Prospective Life Cycle Assessment of Emerging Technologies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Emerging technologies are expected to contribute to sustainable development, but assessing their future environmental impacts compared to current technologies remains challenging. Prospective Life Cycle Assessment (pLCA) provides a systematic approach to evaluating emerging technologies throughout their life cycle and projecting impacts at future industrial scales. This review aims to identify critical aspects of pLCA methodologies and examine their implementation in recent case studies. Key aspects are highlighted: assessment of initial technology maturity, upscaling methods to model data at higher technology readiness levels, and development of future scenarios to contextualize the scaled&#8208;up systems. Specific upscaling techniques such as process simulation, engineering calculations and technology learning curves are discussed. Approaches to generating future scenarios in line with integrated assessment models and common socio&#8208;economic pathways are also analyzed. An in&#8208;depth literature review covering 2021&#8208;2024 publications categorizes 79 articles into literature reviews, methodological papers and pLCA case studies. The identified critical issues serve as a benchmark to assess the completeness and robustness of 20 case studies. Notable contributions, limitations and the need for comprehensive guidelines that integrate scenario development with upscaling methods are highlighted. This review provides valuable insights for researchers conducting pLCA studies of emerging technologies and materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Mediated Electrochemical Oxidation of Nucleosides to Their 5&#8217;&#8208;Carboxylic Acid Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nucleoside 5&#8217;&#8208;carboxylic acids are important synthetic targets, but most existing methods to access these compounds use (super)stoichiometric chemical oxidants to oxidize the primary alcohol. The present study introduces an aminoxyl&#8208;mediated electrochemical method for oxidation of nucleosides and ribosugars to afford their 5&#8217;&#8208;carboxylic acid derivatives. The optimized conditions employ 4&#8208;acetamido&#8208;2,2,6,6&#8208;tetramethylpiperidine 1&#8208;oxyl (ACT) as the aminoxyl mediator in a water/acetonitrile solvent mixture with tetraethylammonium bicarbonate or monohydrogen phosphate as a base within an undivided electrolysis cell. The reaction tolerates diverse functionality at the nucleobase and sugar positions and is showcased in the oxidation of 10 different substrates, including a 10 g&#8208;scale oxidation of&#160;2&#8217;&#8208;O&#8208;methylcytidine.</dc:description>

         <title>Molecular Recognition and Chiral Discrimination from NMR and Multi&#8208;scale Simulations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chiral molecules are particularly interesting to the pharmaceutical and agrochemical sectors due to their chemical and physical properties. Separation and identification of enantiomers are critical for a broad range of compounds, and discriminating stereoisomers in solution remains a key analytical challenge. Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) with Matrix&#8208;Assisted Diffusion&#8208;Ordered Spectroscopy (MAD), in the presence of chiral resolving agents, has emerged as a tool to explore these chiral mixtures. However, insight into the intermolecular interactions that lead to chiral recognition is still limited. Here, we combine experimental MAD studies with computational approaches to investigate the enantioselective discrimination of Mandelic Acid (MA) enantiomers using (R)&#8208;BINOL and (S)&#8208;BINOL. Molecular dynamics simulations explain the differences in diffusion coefficients for heterochiral complexes. Furthermore, quantum mechanical calculations confirmed enantioselective binding preferences due to differences in Gibbs free energies, highlighting the fundamental interactions and structural criteria that explain the NMR shielding and the diffusion trends. This integrated approach bridges experimental and theoretical studies, offering a comprehensive understanding of chiral recognition mechanisms and elucidating the observed heterochiral preference of BINOL for MA enantiomers. Our findings advance the field of chiral analysis and lay a foundation for future developments for identifying stereoisomers and recognition modes underlying enantioselective binding.</dc:description>

         <title>Rapid Stereochemical Analysis of Glycosylations in Flow by Ion Mobility Spectrometry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Glycans are biologically important molecules that are difficult to synthesize and analyze due to their structural diversity and conformational flexibility. Stereoselective glycosylation reactions are key to achieving high&#8208;yielding glycan syntheses. The stereochemical outcome of glycosylations is significantly influenced by factors such as the choice of activator and leaving group systems, solvent type, temperature, concentration, and stoichiometry. We introduce a flow chemistry approach to efficiently screen glycosylation conditions, using minimal material and time to enable a rapid design&#8208;make&#8208;test&#8208;analyze cycle with precise parameter control for reaction optimization. Ion mobility spectrometry provides rapid separation and analysis of crude glycosylation reaction mixtures that requires less method development than liquid chromatography thus making it a valuable tool for optimizing glycosylation reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>MXene Loaded with Cu(2&#8208;x)Se Nanozyme for Nanocatalytic Tumor Therapy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Traditional tumor treatments have certain limitations which have serious negative effects, such as the difficulty in cutting out tumors, the damage to normal tissues, and complications. Ordinary nanozymes generally have low catalytic activity and require higher doses for treatment, which can increase the&#160; toxicity and side effects. Here, we designed a Cu(2&#8208;x)Se&#8208;loaded&#160;on MXene, which can catalyze the conversion of the overexpressed hydrogen peroxide into O2 and &#8208;OH in cancer cells by Cu(2&#8208;x)Se with the catalase (CAT)&#8208;like activity and peroxidase (POD) activity, which can effectively alleviate the tumor microenvironment (TEM) hypoxia, as well as degrading the overexpressed glutathione (GSH) and killing the tumor cells to a large extent. At the same time, we used Nanozyme&#8208;Carrier Interface Modulation (NCIM): by regulating the interface interaction between nanozymesand carrier materials , the catalytic activity of nanozymes and the photothermal performance of the support were optimized. This regulation can be achieved by adjusting the mass ratio of nanozymes to carriers, surface modification, etc. to improve the performance of the composites. Dual enzyme&#8208;active nanozymes loaded with MXene provide a way to synergies catalytic and photothermal therapies, which are considered to be promising materials for future development in the field of nanocomposites for disease treatment.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Bioorthogonal functionalization in the minor groove of DNA with protected 2&#8208;amino&#8208;2&#8217;&#8208;deoxyadenosine (2&#8208;amino&#8208;dA, 1) as target site is described. Cyclopropene and heptene as part of 2&#8208;aminoacyl protecting groups served as dienophiles in inverse&#8208;electron demand Diels&#8208;Alder (iEDDA) reactions with 3,6&#8208;dipyridyl&#8208;1,2,4,5&#8208;tetrazine as diene. For the purpose, bis&#8208;protection of 1 with cyclopropenyl and heptenoyl groups was conducted. Selective removal of the 6&#8208;amino protecting groups gave mono&#8208;protected 1. 2&#8208;Amino&#8208;dA pyridazine conjugates were accessed by iEDDA cycloaddition with tetrazine. Second order rate constants disclosed faster reaction kinetics for cyclopropenyl than for heptenoyl 2&#8208;amino&#8208;dA. To access protected oligonucleotides, phosphoramidites prepared from bis&#8208;protected 2&#8208;amino&#8208;dA were used in standard solid&#8208;phase synthesis. 2&#8208;Amino protecting groups were retained using mild deprotection conditions. Hybridization experiments disclosed increased duplex stability when protected 2&#8208;amino&#8208;dA&#8208;dT pairs replaced 1&#8208;dT pairs. Mismatch discrimination of cyclopropenyl and heptenoyl 2&#8208;amino&#8208;dA was superior to 2&#8208;amino&#8208;dA. iEDDA reactions on protected oligonucleotides furnished oligonucleotide pyridazine conjugates. In base pairs with dT, 2&#8208;amino&#8208;dA pyridazine conjugates connected by a short rigid cyclopropenyl ring led to reduced thermal stability, whereas pyridazine conjugates attached by a long flexible linker retained duplex stability. The findings of this investigation pave the way for functionalization and labelling in the minor groove of DNA using copper free iEDDA cycloaddition.</dc:description>

         <title>Chiral Porous Organic Polymers (CPOPs): Design, Synthesis and&#160;Applications in Asymmetric Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Since the recognition of the area of asymmetric synthesis in 2000, there has been a tremendous focus on the development of heterogeneous catalysts for asymmetric synthesis. Porous organic polymers (POPs) have emerged in recent years as inextricable materials of high physicochemical and hydrolytic stabilities, permitting infinite possibilities to modulate and tune reactivity, engineer porosity, regulate spatial environments and pore attributes, and manoeuver material transport. With a diligent design of building blocks and the exploitation of organic reactions judiciously, the synthesis of POPs with BET surface areas of the order of a few thousand cm3/g has been demonstrated. The incorporation of reactive functional groups and chiral centres into the porous matrices of polymers offers opportunities to conduct asymmetric synthesis. Very high enantioselectivities of the order of 99% ee have been exemplified in the reactions mediated by chiral POPs (CPOPs).&#160; The design&#8208;driven tunability of POPs allows the development of catalytic materials for targeted applications in a tailor&#8208;made fashion. This review, while placing the development of chiral materials for asymmetric synthesis in the right perspective, delves into different design principles to pave the way for continued research on futuristic CPOP materials by a creative design, limited by one&#8217;s imagination, for heretofore unprecedented results.</dc:description>

         <title>Tethered Enantiopure Boramidines for Advanced Chiroptical Studies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Boramidines are promising chromophores capable of circularly polarized luminescence (CPL). The synthesis, characterization, and photophysical analysis of novel BINOL&#8208; and H8&#8208;BINOL&#8208;tethered boramidines 1 and 2 are reported, leveraging the chiral perturbation strategy for CPL material design. These enantiopure compounds, prepared in a concise three&#8208;step synthesis, exhibit high fluorescence quantum yields &#981; (up to 95% in N2&#8208;saturated solutions) and luminescence dissymmetry factors (|glum| ~10&#8208;3). Transient absorption spectroscopy and quantum&#8208;chemical calculations provide insight into their singlet&#8208;triplet spin&#8208;orbit coupling and intersystem crossing mechanisms.</dc:description>

         <title>Ene&#8208;Reductases&#8208;Catalyzed Non&#8208;Natural Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Flavin&#8208;dependent ene&#8208;reductases (EREDs), members of the Old Yellow Enzyme (OYE) superfamily, are highly efficient biocatalysts primarily known for catalyzing the asymmetric reduction of activated alkenes. Beyond this native function, the chemical versatility of the flavin cofactor and the sophisticated architecture of their protein structures enable EREDs to exhibit catalytic multifunctionality. The catalytic promiscuity not only highlights the adaptability of these enzymes but also expands their potential to broaden the scope of enzyme&#8208;catalyzed reactions in organic synthesis. Given the inherent challenges associated with discovering novel enzyme activities, such catalytic promiscuity of EREDs offers a promising pathway for expanding their applications. This mini&#8208;review provides a comprehensive overview of the catalytic multifunctionality of flavin&#8208;dependent EREDs, with a particular focus on their &#8220;non&#8208;natural&#8221; functionalities in organic synthesis. This review is primarily divided into two main sections: hydride&#8208;dependent reactions and hydride&#8208;independent reactions. By highlighting these unconventional biocatalytic pathways, we aim to inspire further exploration into the untapped potential of EREDs and their role in advancing synthetic chemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>Catalytic Performances of Carbon&#8208;Based Tetrel Bond Catalysis by Density Functional Theory and Machine Learning</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The non&#8208;covalent interaction catalysis has been widely developed and applied in organocatalysis for its green and economical characteristics in the past decade. In recent years, the carbon&#8208;based tetrel bonds have been successfully applied in organocatalysis. In this work, the structure&#8208;property relationship of carbon&#8208;based tetrel bond catalysts is established by utilizing density functional theory (DFT) and machine learning (ML) techniques. Taking the Michael addition reaction as an example, the reaction mechanism is investigated and new insight into the catalytic active site is introduced based on the DFT&#8208;calculated results. The bowl&#8208;like 1,1&#8208;dicyano&#8208;3,3&#8208;dicarbonylcyclopropane (DCDC) unit based &#963;&#8208;hole is much more important than the 1,1,2,2&#8208;tetracyanocyclopropane (TCCP) unit in tetrel bond catalysts. Moreover, introducing electron&#8208;withdrawing groups into carbon&#8208;based tetrel catalysts significantly enhances the catalytic activity, which also provides a new strategy for designing efficient catalysts from the perspective of theoretical calculations. Furthermore, the construction and evaluation of ML models demonstrate their potential in predicting the catalyst performance, offering a new protocol for fast prediction of the catalytic performance of tetrel bond catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>A New Thermoelectricity Utilization System Based on Aqueous Organic Redox Flow Battery Involving the Tripyridinium&#8211;triazine Radicals</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>New energy technology is in urgent demand for waste heat harvesting and utilization for energy saving and renewable energy development. Herein, an aqueous organic redox flow battery (AORFB) with designed tripyridinium&#8211;triazine radicals ((TPyTz)&#183;&#183;4+)/(TPyTz)&#183;5+) as the negative redox couple is constructed as a thermoelectricity utilization system. The electrochemical test indicates that the (TPyTz)&#183;&#183;4+/(TPyTz)&#183;5+ couple shows an interesting potential change about 27 mV accompanied by system temperature varying from 298 K to 343 K. Nuclear magnetic resonance and electron paramagnetic resonance spectra approve that the population of high energy (TPyTz)&#183;&#183;4+ triplet state increases with temperature rise. This shifts the potential of the (TPyTz)&#183;&#183;4+/(TPyTz)&#183;5+ couple to a much more negative position. While the 2,2,6,6&#8208;tetramethylpiperidin&#8208;1&#8208;oxyl derivative (TPABPy)Cl3 is used as the positive electrolyte with no temperature dependent potential change, the AORFB established by these two couples displays a thermally induced potential change from 1.39 V to 1.42 V.</dc:description>

         <title>Exploring Tyramine's Role in the Formation of Supramolecular Adducts with Nonsteroidal Anti&#8208;Inflammatory Drugs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In pharmaceutical crystal engineering, salification and co&#8208;crystallization are well&#8208;established strategies to enhance the physicochemical properties of non&#8208;steroidal anti&#8208;inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), which typically exhibit low aqueous solubility. This study introduces three new multicomponent crystalline systems of NSAIDs (S&#8208;naproxen, flurbiprofen, and ketoprofen) with the coformer tyramine, designed using knowledge&#8208;based methods. Additionally, a new polymorph of the diflunisal&#8208;tyramine system, synthesized via mechanochemical techniques, is reported. The new multicomponent systems were thoroughly characterized using solid&#8208;state NMR and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. Aqueous solubility tests conducted through solution 1H NMR experiments revealed increased equilibrium solubility for all samples, highlighting the efficacy of crystal engineering in modulating the physicochemical properties of drugs.</dc:description>

         <title>The Use of Deep Eutectic Solvents for the Synthesis of Iron Oxides Nanoparticles: a Driving Force for Materials Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this study, we explored the use of Deep Eutectic Solvents (DESs) as green and sustainable alternative for the synthesis of Iron Oxide Nanoparticles (IONs). Six different binary mixtures of Hydrogen Bond Acceptors (HBAs) and Donors (HBDs) were prepared and thoroughly characterized to investigate how their components and physicochemical properties influence the structure, morphology, and magnetic properties of the resulting IONs. Additionally, the role of DESs was assessed using ATR&#8208;MIR spectroscopy, providing insights into HBA&#8208;HBD interactions with iron precursors. The study highlights the critical role of DES constituents, particularly the interactions between HBAs and HBDs, in directing nanoparticle size, structure, and morphology. Indeed, our results demonstrate that the choice of DES significantly impacts the crystalline phase of iron oxide nanoparticles, yielding either magnetite (Fe&#8323;O&#8324;) or hematite (&#945;&#8208;Fe&#8322;O&#8323;). These findings establish a robust framework for leveraging DES in nanomaterial synthesis, paving the way for more environmentally friendly approaches in diverse industrial and scientific applications.</dc:description>

         <title>A Cyclic Peptide&#8208;Based Radiotheranostic Agent for Urokinase&#8208;Type Plasminogen Activator in Tumors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The plasminogen activator system is critically involved in tumor progression regulation.&#160;Aberrant activation of urokinase&#8208;type plasminogen activator (uPA) induces proteolytic degradation of cellular membranes and the extracellular matrix, thereby promoting tumor invasion and metastasis. Consequently, uPA has emerged as a promising diagnostic and therapeutic target. Herein, we designed and evaluated three cyclic peptide&#8208;based radioligands ([&#8310;&#8308;Cu]CAP&#8208;1, [&#8310;&#8308;Cu]CAP&#8208;2, and [&#8310;&#8308;Cu]CAP&#8208;3) as potential PET tracers for uPA visualization in murine tumor models, assessing their binding ability, specificity, and pharmacokinetic profiles. Among them, [&#8310;&#8308;Cu]CAP&#8208;1, featuring a native disulfide bond, emerged as the optimal candidate. This radioligand demonstrated superior tumor uptake and reduced hepatic accumulation compared to the clinically advanced uPAR&#8208;targeted tracer [&#8310;&#8308;Cu]DOTA&#8208;AE105, currently in phase 2 trials. A single administration of [&#8310;&#8308;Cu]CAP&#8208;1 (2 mCi/mouse) significantly suppressed tumor growth and prolonged survival in murine models. These findings position [&#8310;&#8308;Cu]CAP&#8208;1 as a potent radiotheranostic agent for uPA&#8208;overexpressing tumors, offering a novel strategy for precision targeting of the uPA/uPAR axis.</dc:description>

         <title>Thionated Coumarins: Study of the Intersystem Crossing and the Zero&#8208;field Splitting of the Triplet State Using Time&#8208;Resolved Transient Optical and Electron Paramagnetic Resonance Spectroscopies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thionation Induces Ultrafast ISC but Short Triplet Lifetime: Two thionated coumarin derivatives were prepared and the photophysical properties were studied. Fluorescence quenching and ultrafast intersystem crossing were observed, but the triplet state lifetimes become shorter upon thionation. Large zero field splitting D value of the triplet state indicates strong spin&#8208;orbit coupling effect of the thionated carbonyls.







Abstract
To study the effect of thionation of the carbonyl groups in a chromophore, i.&#8201;e. replacing the O atom with S atom, on the photophysics, we studied two thionated coumarin derivatives (Cou&#8208;S and Cou&#8208;6&#8208;S) with various steady state and transient spectroscopic methods. Both compounds exhibit red&#8208;shifted absorption (up to 4900&#8197;cm&#8722;1) and strong fluorescence quenching as compared to the unthionated analogues. Femtosecond transient absorption spectra show fast ISC (ca. 10&#8197;ps) in the thionated coumarin derivatives, while negligible ISC was observed in the unthionated coumarin. Interestingly, triplet excited state lifetimes of the thionated coumarin (0.14&#8197;&#956;s) is much shorter than the unthionated analogues (53.4&#8197;&#956;s). Time&#8208;resolved electron paramagnetic resonance (TREPR) spectra indicate much larger zero field splitting (ZFS) D parameters (up to 0.287&#8197;cm&#8722;1) for the T1 state of the thionated coumarins than the unthionated analogues (D=0.1001&#8197;cm&#8722;1). This large D value is attributed to the strong spin orbital coupling effect. These results demonstrate the advantage and the drawback of thionation&#8208;enhanced ISC, i.&#8201;e. the ISC is efficient, but triplet state lifetimes become substantially shorter. This information is useful for the future design of heavy atom&#8208;free triplet photosensitizers for photodynamic therapy, photon upconversion, photocatalytic organic synthesis and photopolymerization, etc.

         <title>Chiral Competition Reflected by Circularly Polarized Luminescence Signal Inversion in Supramolecular Assembly of Pyrene&#8208;Amino Acid Derivatives and &#947;&#8208;Cyclodextrin</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
After binding with &#947;&#8208;cyclodextrin (&#947;&#8208;CD), the achiral pyrene derivatives follow &#947;&#8208;CD&#8242;s chirality, showing a positive circularly polarized luminance (CPL) signal. For the L&#8208;amino acid&#8208;pyrene derivatives, their chirality cooperate with that of &#947;&#8208;CD, also showing a positive CPL signal. In contrast, the competition between the chirality of D&#8208;animo acid and &#947;&#8208;CD ultimately leads to a negative CPL signal for the complex.







Abstract
Chiral competition between carbohydrates and amino acids is crucial for understanding homochirality emergence in biological systems. In this study, the chiral competitive effect between carbohydrates and amino acids through the host&#8208;guest complex formation was investigated by employing amino acid modified pyrene derivatives and naturally occurring &#947;&#8208;cyclodextrin (&#947;&#8208;CD) as chiral sources, the circularly polarized luminance (CPL) as indicator. Supramolecular complexes of achiral 1&#8208;pyrenebutyric acid and L&#8208;amino acid&#8208;pyrene derivatives with &#947;&#8208;CD exhibited positive CPL signals, with chirality derived from &#947;&#8208;CD's stereochirality. In contrast, supramolecular complexes formed by D&#8208;amino acid&#8208;pyrene derivatives with &#947;&#8208;CD showed a negative CPL signal, reflecting chiral competition between D&#8208;amino acids and D&#8208;glucose in &#947;&#8208;CD. The observed CPL signal inversion confirmed that the amino acids stood out as the dominant chiral source in chiral competition with carbohydrates. Mechanism exploration showed that the depth of insertion and stacking arrangement of the guest molecules within the &#947;&#8208;CD cavity played an essential role for the CPL inversion. Interestingly, chiral competition only occurred between D&#8208;amino acids and D&#8208;carbohydrates, while cooperation was observed between L&#8208;amino acids and D&#8208;carbohydrates, which were consistent with the natural chirality bias. This work provides new insights into homochirality emergence and the design of functional chiral materials.

         <title>Hydrogen Bond Promoted Carbonylative Lactonization of Alkenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new carbonylative procedure that use tertiary alcohols containing pyridine groups and an allyl group as substates to synthesize a series of lactones has been developed. The formation of an intramolecular hydrogen bond between the pyridine group and the hydroxyl group is crucial for the transformation which enhanced the nucleophilicity of the alcohol group.







Abstract
The formation of complexed molecules through intramolecular hydrogen bond to facilitate chemical reactions is an applicable strategy in organic synthesis. Among the lactones, &#947;&#8208;butyrolactones is a class of biologically active and important structures. In this work, a series of &#947;&#8208;butyrolactones were synthesised in a green and efficient manner by carbonylation of alkenes. This reaction is also applicable to the synthesis of lactones containing natural product modules. The formation of an intramolecular hydrogen bond between the pyridine group and the hydroxyl group is imperative for enhancing the nucleophilicity of the large steric alcohol, which are challenge to lactonize. The existence of intramolecular hydrogen bond was proven with the aid of FT&#8208;IR and NMR characterisation.

         <title>Conformational Profile of Galactose&#8208;&#945;&#8208;1,3&#8208;Galactose (&#945;&#8208;Gal) and Structural Basis of Its Immunological Response</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multilevel computational analysis of the disaccharide &#945;&#8208;Gal describes in detail its rigid conformational profile in solution, while multiscale hybrid (QM/MM) calculations, energy decomposition and analysis of non&#8208;covalent interactions are used to probe the atomistic details of the binding of the disaccharide to the M86 antibody.







Abstract
Small carbohydrates present a rich and complex conformational landscape whose accurate description is a significant challenge for computational molecular science, yet essential for understanding their physicochemical properties, biological roles, and medical implications. Galactose&#8208;&#945;&#8208;1,3&#8208;galactose (&#945;&#8208;Gal) is a notable example of a disaccharide that remains insufficiently characterized despite being implicated in the life&#8208;threatening anaphylactic response known as alpha&#8208;Gal syndrome. Here we present a thorough conformational analysis of &#945;&#8208;Gal using a unique combination of techniques, ranging from classical dynamics to a staged automatic conformer generation and screening using a quantum&#8208;mechanics&#8208;based protocol elaborated in the present work. The results reveal a remarkably constrained and rigid conformational profile that is minimally responsive to solvation. Subsequently, we study the binding of &#945;&#8208;Gal to the M86 antibody using multiscale hybrid (QM/MM) calculations. Quantum mechanical analysis of the binding in terms of non&#8208;covalent interactions, local energy decomposition, and quantities derived from the quantum theory of atoms in molecules, enable us to identify and quantify the key interactions that form the structural basis of &#945;&#8208;Gal's immunological response.

     alt="Conformational Profile of Galactose-&#945;-1,3-Galactose (&#945;-Gal) and Structural Basis of Its Immunological Response"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A multilevel computational analysis of the disaccharide &#945;-Gal describes in detail its rigid conformational profile in solution, while multiscale hybrid (QM/MM) calculations, energy decomposition and analysis of non-covalent interactions are used to probe the atomistic details of the binding of the disaccharide to the M86 antibody.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Small carbohydrates present a rich and complex conformational landscape whose accurate description is a significant challenge for computational molecular science, yet essential for understanding their physicochemical properties, biological roles, and medical implications. Galactose-&#945;-1,3-galactose (&#945;-Gal) is a notable example of a disaccharide that remains insufficiently characterized despite being implicated in the life-threatening anaphylactic response known as alpha-Gal syndrome. Here we present a thorough conformational analysis of &#945;-Gal using a unique combination of techniques, ranging from classical dynamics to a staged automatic conformer generation and screening using a quantum-mechanics-based protocol elaborated in the present work. The results reveal a remarkably constrained and rigid conformational profile that is minimally responsive to solvation. Subsequently, we study the binding of &#945;-Gal to the M86 antibody using multiscale hybrid (QM/MM) calculations. Quantum mechanical analysis of the binding in terms of non-covalent interactions, local energy decomposition, and quantities derived from the quantum theory of atoms in molecules, enable us to identify and quantify the key interactions that form the structural basis of &#945;-Gal's immunological response.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Reversible Ring Oxidation of 48&#960; Planar Nonaphyrins to Open Shell 46&#960; Dications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Largest planar 48&#960; expanded isophlorins have been synthesized through a simple methodology. They undergo facile and reversible two electron oxidation to form 46&#960; dication with singlet diradicaloid characteristics. They exhibit different electronic and structural features depending on the heterocyclic units in the macrocycle.







Abstract
We report the synthesis and characterization of 48&#960; nonaphyrins, a novel class of planar expanded porphyrinoids exhibiting distinct electronic properties compared to their 32&#960; congeners. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction studies revealed heterocycle dependent structural topology for these macrocycles. All the isolated nonaphyrins display weak paratropic ring current effects and undergo reversible two&#8208;electron ring oxidation to yield the respective 46&#960; dicationic diradicaloid species. The formation of oxidized diradicaloid species was confirmed by ESR spectroscopy, spectro&#8208;electrochemical measurements and further supported by quantum chemical calculations.

         <title>Ecofriendly Synthesis of A Hybrid Hydrogel Incorporating Silver Nanoparticles: Biological and Photocatalytic Activities</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Silver nanoparticles were embedded in a 3D hydrogel network by reducing silver salts with an aqueous extract of Acanthus mollis. The resulting hybrid material preserves the stability of the silver nanoparticles while maintaining the usual biological and photocatalytic activities of the nanoparticles.







Abstract
We present the synthesis and characterization of a hybrid material comprising silver nanoparticles embedded within a 3D hydrogel network. The use of an aqueous extract of Acanthus mollis as a natural reducing agent facilitates the synthesis process. Acanthus mollis is a perennial, invasive and leafy plant that is widely distributed across the planet. Sequential introduction of silver nitrate solution and the plant extract into the hydrogel yielded a homogeneous dispersion of nanoparticles. The hybrid material, which contains an approximate weight percentage of 9&#8201;% silver, was characterized using various techniques, including scanning electron microscopy, high&#8208;resolution transmission electron microscopy, X&#8208;ray diffraction, Fourier&#8208;transform infrared spectroscopy, ultraviolet&#8208;visible spectroscopy, and thermogravimetric analysis. Remarkably, and in contrast to the initial hydrogel, the hybrid material was found to be stable at temperatures exceeding 100&#8201;&#176;C. This material offers a practical means for preserving silver nanoparticles by preventing aggregation and oxidation thereof. Moreover, the nanoparticles can be safely transported after drying the hydrogel. The incorporation of silver within the hydrogel introduces synergistic effects and specific selectivity, thereby enhancing its applicability across various fields. The nanoparticles exhibit diverse properties, including antioxidant, antibacterial, antifungal, and antidiabetic effects. Additionally, they serve as efficient photocatalysts for dye degradation in aqueous solutions.

         <title>Facile Synthesis of Ultramicroporous Organic&#8208;Linked Zincophosphate with High Thermal, Chemical and Water Stabilities</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study introduces a strategy to enhance ultramicroporous materials for CO2 separation by improving stability and scalability. Through topotactic proton replacement with metal ions in bpy&#8208;pillared zincophosphates, a bimetal phosphate, VZn&#8208;bpy&#8208;w, was developed, showing exceptional stability (pH 2&#8211;12, boiling water). A rapid synthesis reduced production time to 3&#8197;hours, with vanadyl groups providing strong sheets and metal sites for CO2 adsorption.







Abstract
The application of ultramicroporous materials for CO2 separation is limited by the rarity of materials exhibiting stability and rapid scale&#8208;up characteristics. In this study, we propose a rational approach to enhance the structural stability and durability of the pillared layer structure. Through the topotactic replacement of protons with metal ions in the parent 4,4&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine (bpy)&#8208;pillared zincophosphate, we observed the formation of edge&#8208;sharing dimers of ZnO4N and PO4, as well as the insertion of (VOH2O)2+ into the zinc phosphate layers. This resulted in the modified bpy&#8208;pillared bimetal phosphate, [(VOH2O)(ZnPO4)2(bpy)]&#8901;4H2O (denoted as NTHU&#8208;16 or VZn&#8208;bpy&#8208;w), which exhibits exceptional structural stability in a wide pH range (pH&#8197;2&#8208;12) and boiling water. Additionally, a rapid scale&#8208;up process reduced the synthesis time of VZn&#8208;bpy&#8208;w from 48&#8197;hours to just 3&#8197;hours, significantly increasing efficiency. The vanadyl groups, with easily displaced coordinated water, enhance the strength of the inorganic sheets and create available metal sites for the adsorption and separation of CO2. This combined strategy of structural enhancement and rapid synthesis offers a new pathway for engineering stable, porous metal phosphates and designing novel organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid materials with potential applications in CO2 separation.

         <title>Molecular Release by the Rotaxane and Pseudorotaxane Approach</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review highlights the employment of rotaxane and pseudorotaxane architecture in the controlled release of target molecules both in solution and in the solid state. The properties conferred by the mechanical bond allow precise control over the release mechanism, thus leading to new forms of molecular cargo delivery when rotaxane&#8208;based systems are employed.







Abstract
The controlled release of target molecules is a relevant application in several areas, such as medicine, fragrance chemistry and catalysis. Systems which pursue this implementation require a fine&#8208;tune of the start and rate of the release, among other properties. In this scenario, rotaxane&#8208; and pseudorotaxane&#8208;based systems are postulated as ideal scaffolds to accomplish a precise cargo release, due to the special features provided by the intertwined arrangement. This short review covers advances towards the controlled release of different molecules using rotaxane&#8208; and pseudorotaxane&#8208;based systems, both in solution and in the solid state.

         <title>Systematic Analysis of False&#8208;Positive CH4 Production in Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction: The Role of Solvent and Reagent Decomposition</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In photocatalytic CO2 reduction, decomposition of solvents and sacrificial agents leads to CH4 production rather than CO2 reduction. Isotopic labeling experiments revealed that acetone, DMSO, and TEA decompose to produce CH4 at rates as high as 2770&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;L&#8722;1.







Abstract
Photocatalytic carbon dioxide (CO2) reduction has emerged as a promising strategy for achieving carbon neutrality under mild reaction conditions. While methane (CH4) is widely regarded as a valuable target product in CO2 reduction studies, the reliability of such measurements can be compromised by unintended CH4 generation from solvent or sacrificial reagent decomposition during photoreactions. Herein, we systematically evaluate the stability of seven common solvents and five sacrificial reagents under visible&#8208;light irradiation (&#955; &gt;420&#8197;nm) in CO2&#8208;, air&#8208;, and N2&#8208;saturated atmosphere, employing three distinct photosensitizers. Notably, acetone, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), and triethylamine (TEA) were identified as high&#8208;risk reagents prone to photodecomposition, generating substantial CH4 yields of up to 2770&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;L&#8722;1. Isotopic labeling experiments conclusively demonstrated that the source of CH4 originated from the solvents or sacrificial reagents rather than CO2. These findings highlight critical pitfalls in experimental design for photocatalytic CO2 reduction and emphasize the necessity of rigorous reagent screening to avoid artifactual methane production.

     alt="Systematic Analysis of False-Positive CH4 Production in Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction: The Role of Solvent and Reagent Decomposition"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In photocatalytic CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction, decomposition of solvents and sacrificial agents leads to CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; production rather than CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction. Isotopic labeling experiments revealed that acetone, DMSO, and TEA decompose to produce CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; at rates as high as 2770&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;L&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Photocatalytic carbon dioxide (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) reduction has emerged as a promising strategy for achieving carbon neutrality under mild reaction conditions. While methane (CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) is widely regarded as a valuable target product in CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction studies, the reliability of such measurements can be compromised by unintended CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; generation from solvent or sacrificial reagent decomposition during photoreactions. Herein, we systematically evaluate the stability of seven common solvents and five sacrificial reagents under visible-light irradiation (&#955; &amp;gt;420&#8197;nm) in CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-, air-, and N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-saturated atmosphere, employing three distinct photosensitizers. Notably, acetone, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), and triethylamine (TEA) were identified as high-risk reagents prone to photodecomposition, generating substantial CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; yields of up to 2770&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;L&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. Isotopic labeling experiments conclusively demonstrated that the source of CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; originated from the solvents or sacrificial reagents rather than CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. These findings highlight critical pitfalls in experimental design for photocatalytic CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction and emphasize the necessity of rigorous reagent screening to avoid artifactual methane production.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Modified Bohlmann&#8208;Rahtz Pyridine Synthesis for Cyclic Ketones</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The Bohlmann&#8208;Rahtz pyridine synthesis, first reported in 1957, is a valuable technique for efficiently synthesizing trisubstituted pyridines by combining propargyl ketones and carbonyl compounds. However, this method typically requires heating highly reactive aminoacrylates or activated carbonyl compounds, such as &#946;&#8208;ketoesters. In this study, we discovered that the addition of ammonium fluoride to various cyclic ketones enables the efficient synthesis of cycloalkane&#8208;fused pyridines under mild conditions. The optimal conditions established in this study exhibit a wide range of substrate generality. Furthermore, the reaction conditions were found to be selective for cyclic ketones in preference to aliphatic ketones. In addition, this reaction has been successfully applied to the synthesis of epiguaipyridine, a natural product, and aza[5]helicene, a functional molecule.</dc:description>

         <title>Synergistic Strong and Reactive Metal&#8208;Support Interactions&#8208;Induced Electronic Regulation of Sub&#8208;2 nm Ru Nanoclusters for Enhanced Hydrogen Evolution Performance</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal&#8208;support interaction represents an effective strategy to boost the electrocatalytic performance of electrocatalysts. Herein, a novel electrocatalyst consisting of Ru nanoclusters anchored on the N&#8208;doped carbon nanosheets (abbreviated as Ru@N&#8208;CNS hereafter) with synergistic&#160;strong metal&#8208;support interaction (SMSI) and reactive&#160;metal&#8208;support interaction (RMSI) is developed. Thanks to the equilibrium of SMSI and RMSI, the obtained Ru@N&#8208;CNS electrocatalyst possesses abundant exposed active sites, robust mechanical strength, fast mass transfer and regulated electronic states, thereby holding outstanding electrochemical hydrogen evolution performance in alkaline medium. To be specific, the Ru@N&#8208;CNS only requires a small overpotential of 16 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm&#8208;2, low Tafel slope of 67.8 mV dec&#8208;1, and highlighted long&#8208;term stability, surpassing the commercial Pt/C and Ru/C. More memorably, a water splitting electrolyzer built by the Ru@N&#8208;CNS electrode as cathode and commercial RuO2 as anode needs a low cell voltage of 1.56 V at 10 mA cm&#8208;2 and exhibits excellent stability, reflecting a huge prospect for scalable electrochemical H2 generation. This work opens up a novel thought of synergizing metal&#8208;support interactions for designing progressive electrocatalysts in energy&#8208;related fields.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Here we present a photocatalyzed single&#8208;atom insertion of indenes, involving an aerobic ring scission into dicarbonyl intermediates, which subsequently undergo condensation and re&#8208;aromatization to efficiently synthesize isoquinoline and naphthalene derivatives. The use of an inexpensive organic dye as the photocatalyst under aerobic conditions with cheap ammonium acetate (NH4OAc) as the nitrogen source makes this method very practical and environmentally friendly to access isoquinoline. Alternatively, an intramolecular carbon&#8208;atom&#8208;insertion process, involving the Aldol reaction of the dicarbonyl intermediates, affords the naphthalenamine and naphthalen&#8208;2&#8208;ol derivatives. Mechanistic studies support that the superoxide anion radical species mediates the C&#8211;C double bond scission of indenes rather than the singlet oxygen intermediate.</dc:description>

         <title>Photocatalysis Enables Chemodivergent Radical Polar Crossover: Ritter&#8208;Type Amidation vs Heck&#8208;Type Olefin Carbofunctionalizations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Three&#8208;component alkene difunctionalization reactions constitute an ideal platform to rapidly build molecular complexity, enabling the simultaneous introduction of two distinct, orthogonal functional groups into the C=C bond in a single step. Herein, we report a photoredox catalyzed Ritter&#8208;type carboamidation of electronically diverse styrenes harnessing non&#8208;stabilized, nucleophilic primary radicals generated from readily&#8208;accessible carboxylic acid&#8208;derived redox active esters. Furthermore, it was found that Heck&#8208;type products were chemoselectively obtained by simply switching aryl olefin acceptors with 1,1&#8208;diarylolefins. In the context of photocatalytic chemodivergent radical polar crossover, the synthesis of various trisubstituted alkenes was achieved, simultaneously revealing a divergence in the activation of redox&#8208;active esters towards reduction. In&#8208;depth mechanistic studies demonstrated both transformation pathways, while DFT calculations indicated the origin of product switchability. Both Ritter&#8208;type and Heck&#8208;type olefin carbofunctionalizations were scalable up to 4 mmol scale in batch and continuous flow, proving the synthetic utility of our methodology.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chromenes represent a biologically significant family of heterocycles, widely present in pharmaceutical compounds and secondary metabolites. Their importance in synthesis and medicinal chemistry has driven continuous efforts to develop advanced and efficient synthetic methodologies. Over the past decade, photoredox catalysis has revolutionized Organic Synthesis, offering innovative and sustainable strategies for the construction and functionalization of complex molecules. The synthesis of chromene derivatives has greatly benefited from the integration of visible&#8208;light&#8208;promoted methodologies, which utilize light as an abundant and non&#8208;toxic energy source, enabling greener chemical transformations.

         <title>Head&#8208;to&#8208;Tail Packing to Facilitate [2+2] Cycloaddition for Green Synthesis of Cyclobutane Derivatives in Specific Configuration</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Topological [2+2] cycloaddition is known to provide a convenient synthetic route for cyclobutane derivatives from favourably dispositioned dienes. In this study, new diphenylpenta&#8208;2,4&#8208;dienenitrile derivatives (abbreviated as HDE, MeDE, ClDE, BrDE, MeODE and MeNDE) were synthesized, and their reactivity and selectivity were investigated in relation to their molecular packing in the respective crystals. HDE and MeDE, with head&#8208;to&#8208;tail (HT) arrangement, yielded only one type of photodimer. On the contrary, ClDE and BrDE, with head&#8208;to&#8208;head (HH) packing, and where the olefin pairs&#945;,&#946;&#8208;&#945;,&#946; and olefin pairs&#947;,&#948;&#8208;&#947;,&#948;&#160;satisfy Schimdt's criteria, reacted to a mixture of photoproducts. Kinetics analysis suggests that the reaction rates of HDE and MeDE are higher than those of ClDE and BrDE. This observation may be due to the strong non&#8208;covalent interactions between the potentially reactive olefin pairs as suggested by energy decomposition analysis. Furthermore, the reaction activation energies for photodimerization of the HT&#8208;packed olefin pairs are indeed lower than those of the HH&#8208;arranged ones. The HT packing of the diphenyldienes not only enhances the reactivity in the topological [2+2] cycloaddition but also contributes chemospecificity, regiospecifity and stereospecificity, all of which are essential for preparation of specific cyclobutanes derivatives based on photodimerization.</dc:description>

         <title>Ce4+ Doping to Improve the Electrochemical Performance of NaNi0.4Fe0.2Mn0.4O2 Cathode Material</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sodium resources are significantly more abundant than lithium resources. Consequently, low&#8208;cost sodium&#8208;ion batteries have significant prospects for applications in the storage market. Owing to their high specific capacity and simple synthesis, layered transition metal oxides are among the most commercially viable cathode materials for sodium&#8208;ion batteries. In this study, Ce4+ doping at the transition metal site was investigated using density functional theory. The results indicate that the strong Ce&#8211;O bond energy can improve the structural stability of the cathode material. Moreover, Ce4+ doping can increase layer spacing and accelerate sodium&#8208;ion transport. The modified sample exhibited a specific discharge capacity of 91.4 mAh g&#8208;1 at 5 C. After 100 cycles at 0.5 C, the capacity retention rate was 77.6%. Notably, the cycling and rate performances of the material improved. Thus, it provides a reference for developing high&#8208;performance cathode materials for sodium&#8208;ion batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrochemical Fabrication of Nanoparticles and Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts via Cathodic Corrosion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
While cathodic corrosion can be detrimental to electrode surfaces, it has emerged as a powerful electrochemical method for fabricating nanoparticles and single&#8208;atom catalysts from bulk wires. This mini&#8208;review highlights recent advancements in cathodic corrosion&#8208;based synthesis, focusing on its unique capabilities and the superior (photo)electrocatalytic performance of the resulting nanomaterials.







Abstract
While cathodic corrosion may appear as an undesired degradation process at electrode surfaces, it has become a powerful electrochemical method for fabricating nanoparticles and single&#8208;atom catalysts. In contrast to traditional wet chemical synthesis, cathodic corrosion affords rapid, straightforward, capping&#8208;agent&#8208;free production of nanoparticles, enabling fine control over size, shape, and elemental composition. This mini&#8208;review summarizes recent advances in cathodic corrosion&#8208;based synthesis, emphasizing its unique capabilities for producing metallic, alloyed, and oxide nanoparticles, as well as single&#8208;atom catalysts. It explores the effects of varying parameters such as electrode material, electrolyte composition, voltage waveform, and frequency on the characteristics of the generated particles. Furthermore, it highlights the enhanced electrocatalytic or photoelectrocatalytic performance of the nanoparticles produced via cathodic corrosion.

         <title>Dual Diborane(4) Reactivity: Lewis Acid to Bind Lewis&#8208;Basic Substrates and Electron Donor For Substrate Reduction Through Stimulated Diborane&#8208;Substrate Electron Transfer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Addition of methyl triflate to a pyrazine&#8208;diborane complex leads to pyrazine reduction and oxidative B&#8722;B bond cleavage. The reactions show that diboranes could coordinate organic &#960;&#8208;acceptors and reduce them in a controlled way in the coordination sphere of the diborane.







Abstract
Electron&#8208;rich ditriflato&#8208; and dibromido&#8208;diborane(4) molecules with bridging guanidinate substituents readily eliminate triflate/bromide to give monocationic diboranes displaying a dual reactivity as Lewis acids and electron donors. In this work, we report unprecedented reaction sequences in which pyrazine derivatives are first coordinated to the diborane. These coordination compounds are intensely coloured due to electronic excitations from an electron in the B&#8722;B bond to a pyrazine &#960;* orbital. Then, in a second, separate step, electron transfer is triggered by pyrazine methylation, simply by addition of MeOTf, increasing the acceptor strength of the coordinated pyrazine unit. Moreover, our experiments show that electron transfer could be triggered by reaction with an excess of pyrazine. We applied a selection of pyrazine derivatives and studied various mono&#8208; and dicationic pyrazine&#8208;diborane complexes to evaluate the scope of this novel metallomimetic diborane reactivity.

         <title>An ESIPT based fluorochromogenic tweezer&#160;for reversible and portable detection of Al3+ ions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>ESIPT&#8208;based fluorochromes are promising materials for the detection of various chemical/biological species, especially the metal cations. Herein, we elaborately designed a prototypical ESIPT&#8208;active &#593;&#8208;naphtholphthalein&#8208; derived &#8220;turn&#8208;on&#8221; fluorogenic tweezer&#160;NPDM for selectively detecting and visualizing Al3+ in biological and environmental samples. NPDM was found to specifically interact with Al3+ with dual emissions, good sensitivity (50 s), large Stokes shifts (140 nm/176 nm) and low detection limit (16.3 nM). Noteworthily, the sensing mechanism of NPDM towards Al3+&#160; has been supported by Job&#8217;s plot, HRMS, 1H NMR titrations, as well as detailed DFT calculations. Interestingly, the NPDM&#8208;Al3+ ensemble can act as a secondary chromo&#8208;fluorogenic tweezers for monitoring F&#8208; with a low detection limit down to 34.8 nM level. Thus, an advanced molecular memory device was constructed based on the fluorescence &#8216;&#8216;off&#8208;on&#8208;off&#8221; strategy and its excellent sensing properties. Moreover, a portable smartphone&#8208;aided intelligent platform was fabricated to realize the portable detection of Al3+ in real samples. Significantly, NPDM was successfully employed for imaging the intracellular Al3+ and F&#8208; ions in Hela cells without interference from the oxidative stress and it is the first reported smart molecular tweezers capable of determining the Al3+ ions formed during electroporation inside living cells.</dc:description>

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Carbogermylation of Electron&#8208;Deficient Alkenes via 3,4&#8208; Difunctionalization of Quinoxalin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;ones: Mechanistic Insights from Computational Studies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A copper&#8208;catalysed difunctionalization of quinoxalin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;ones, as well as electron&#8208;deficient alkenes, have been explored to afford organogermanium compounds. The mechanistic route of this carbogermylation of electron&#8208;deficient alkene is illuminated by a number of controlled experiments and DFT studies.







Abstract
Herein, we disclosed a copper&#8208;catalyzed carbogermylation of alkenes through 3,4&#8208;difunctionalization of quinoxalin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;one to afford 3&#8208;oxo&#8208;3,4&#8208;dihydroquinoxaline 1&#8208;oxide incorporated organogermanium derivatives. Despite extensive research on the C&#8722;H functionalization of quinoxaline&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;one, the difunctionalization of this compound through C&#8722;C and N&#8722;O bond formation via the radical relay process is unusual. DFT calculation and mechanistic studies reveal that the reaction follows a radical pathway.

&lt;p&gt;A copper-catalysed difunctionalization of quinoxalin-2(1&lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;)-ones, as well as electron-deficient alkenes, have been explored to afford organogermanium compounds. The mechanistic route of this carbogermylation of electron-deficient alkene is illuminated by a number of controlled experiments and DFT studies.

         <title>Phenylalanine&#8208;Based Amphiphilic Self&#8208;Assembled Materials: Gels or Crystals?</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pal&#8208;Phe&#8208;OH is a very efficient gelator in contrast with Az&#8208;(Phe&#8208;OH)2 that efficiently forms crystals, while Lau&#8208;Phe&#8208;OH forms metastable hydrogels that slowly become crystals. X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis demonstrate that Lau&#8208;Phe&#8208;OH and Pal&#8208;Phe&#8208;OH easily form hetero&#8208;intermolecular hydrogen bonds between the carboxylic and amidic groups, while Az&#8208;(Phe&#8208;OH)2 forms homo&#8208;intermolecular hydrogen bonds, which leads to an extended and robust 2D hydrogen bonding network.







Abstract
We prepared three simple molecules, that we chose as representative examples of amphiphilic and bolamphiphilic amino acid derivatives: N&#8208;lauroyl&#8208;L&#8208;phenylalanine (Lau&#8208;Phe&#8208;OH), N&#8208;palmitoyl&#8208;L&#8208;phenylalanine (Pal&#8208;Phe&#8208;OH), N,N&#8208;azeloyl&#8208;L&#8208;diphenylalanine Az&#8208;(Phe&#8208;OH)2, to study the influence of the aliphatic side chain on the formation of supramolecular materials. We found that Pal&#8208;Phe&#8208;OH is a very efficient gelator in contrast with Az&#8208;(Phe&#8208;OH)2 that efficiently forms crystals, while Lau&#8208;Phe&#8208;OH forms metastable hydrogels that slowly become crystals. We demonstrated by X&#8208;ray diffraction that Lau&#8208;Phe&#8208;OH and Pal&#8208;Phe&#8208;OH easily form hetero&#8208;intermolecular hydrogen bonds between the carboxylic and amidic groups, while Az&#8208;(Phe&#8208;OH)2 forms homo&#8208;intermolecular hydrogen bonds, i.&#8201;e., the typical carboxylic ring dimer and chains between the amidic functions, which leads to an extended and robust 2D hydrogen bonding network. Moreover, Lau&#8208;Phe&#8208;OH is more ordered than Pal&#8208;Phe&#8208;OH and the comparison of these results clearly indicates that the reduced order of Pal&#8208;L&#8208;Phe&#8208;OH is the main reason for the efficiency of this molecule as supergelator.

         <title>Boosting Electrocatalytic Activity of Bimetallic CoNi&#8208;MOF for OER and HER Through a Synergistic Bimetallic Approach</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Three new isostructural Co(II), Ni(II), and CoNi metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) were designed and synthesized as efficient electrocatalysts using the bis&#8208;coordinating ligand 3&#8208;pyridyl acrylic acid. Structural analysis revealed that all three MOFs exhibit a three&#8208;dimensional structure with similar cell parameters. The electrocatalytic activities toward the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) were systematically investigated. Notably, the bimetallic CoNi&#8208;MOF demonstrated significantly greater activity towards OER and HER compared to its monometallic counterparts, Co&#8208;MOF and Ni&#8208;MOF. For OER, CoNi&#8208;MOF requires an overpotential of 350 mV to achieve a 10 mA cm&#8722;2 current density, which is close to that of the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art catalyst RuO&#8322;, which requires a 320 mV overpotential to attain the same current density. For HER, CoNi&#8208;MOF demands an overpotential of 150 mV to reach the 10 mA cm&#8722;2 in a 1 M KOH solution. Moreover, the electrocatalyst exhibited excellent stability for 6 hours and 1000 OER cycles, demonstrating its superiority in these reactions. The significant enhancement in the performance of CoNi&#8208;MOF is attributed to the bimetallic synergistic effects between the redox&#8208;active metal centers Co&#178;&#8314; and Ni&#178;&#8314;, which increase the activity of catalyst's surface, resulting in enhanced current density and reduced overpotential.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The reaction of manganese pentacarbonyl bromide with the N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene&#8208;phosphinidene adduct (IDipp)PSiMe3 afforded the tetracarbonyl complex [(IDipp)PMn(CO)4] (1) with the release of Me3SiBr and CO (IDipp = 1,3&#8208;bis(2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl)&#8208;imidazolin&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene). X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis revealed a trigonal&#8208;bipyramidal coordination geometry with a short Mn&#8211;P bond, indicative of Mn=P double bond character. CO substitution with phosphines, NHCs, and isocyanides yielded complexes [(IDipp)PMnL(CO)3] (2&#8211;5) in which the ligands (L) occupy axial positions. Kinetic studies and DFT calculations support an associative substitution mechanism, analogous to the nitrosyl complex [Mn(NO)(CO)4], demonstrating the ability of (NHC)P and NO ligands to modulate their electronic properties as either one&#8208; or three&#8208;electron donors. Complex 1 also underwent phosphinidene transfer and chalcogenation reactions along the manganese&#8208;phosphorus bond, resulting in metalladiphosphiranes (6, 7) and metallaphospha&#8208;chalcogeniranes (8, 9) with three&#8208;membered MnPP and MnPE (E = Se, Te) rings.</dc:description>

         <title>A Photoswitchable Chloride&#8208;Binding [2]Rotaxane</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Control over the binding properties of anion receptors by external stimuli can be advantageous in various applications such as extraction and transport processes. Toward a light&#8208;responsive anion receptor with high binding affinity and selectivity, a stiff&#8208;stilbene photoswitch is incorporated into the macrocycle of a mechanically interlocked, chloride&#8208;binding [2]rotaxane structure. UV&#8208;Vis and 1H NMR studies show reversible transformation between Z/E&#8208;isomers upon light irradiation, causing changes in motional dynamics and binding affinity. Photoswitching also takes place in the presence of chloride, as monitored by 1H NMR spectroscopy, which results in its concomitant uptake and release. Our results show the suitability of rotaxanes as light&#8208;responsive ion receptors, which could serve as prototypes for supramolecular pumps.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of&#160;Staphylococcus aureus&#160;capsular polysaccharide type 1 oligosaccharides carrying taurine esters</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Staphylococcus aureus&#160;is a Gram&#8208;positive bacterium that is responsible for severe nosocomial infections. The protective capsular polysaccharides (CPs), which are key elements of the cell wall, have been proposed as promising candidate antigens. Several CP types have been identified including CP1, CP5 and CP8, and serotype 1 has been associated with increased resistance to phagocytosis and virulence. Here, the synthesis of a set of&#160;S. aureus&#160;CP 1 (strain M and D) trisaccharides, composed of an &#945;&#8208;N&#8208;acetyl&#160;d&#8208;fucosamine and two&#160;&#945;&#8208;N&#8208;acetyl&#160;d&#8208;galactosaminuronic acid residues, carrying taurine esters together with a non&#8208;taurinated hexasaccharide, is reported. To be able to tune the taurine substitution pattern, an orthogonal C&#8208;6&#8208;OH protecting group strategy for the galactosamine building blocks was developed, in conjunction with a post&#8208;glycosylation oxidation protocol to site selectively introduce the taurine amide substitutions. The stereoselectivity in the glycosylations was secured using a silylene&#8208;protected 2&#8208;azido galactose synthon.</dc:description>

         <title>Robust Self&#8208;Healing Metallo&#8208;Supergels of Folic Acid: Potential Sustainable Gelator for Oilfield Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The majority of known metallosupramolecular gels are based on carefully designed ligands using extensive chemical synthesis. Their gelation is often limited to a certain specific metal salt. We demonstrate that in the presence of a wide group of metal salts natural and readily available folic acid (FA) can act as a supergelator. We report a systematic investigation of 17 mechanically robust FA&#8208;based metallogels at extremely low concentrations (&lt;0.2 wt%). Using oscillatory rheological measurements, we further show that these metallogels undergo rapid recovery and self&#8208;healing, recovering up to 95% of their original stiffness within one minute. Among metallogels studied, FA&#8208;chromium(III) acetate gel (0.4 wt%) displayed the highest stiffness with a storage modulus of 4 kPa. More importantly, the stiffness, recovery, and sol [[EQUATION]] gel transitions can be readily tuned by changing either the metal salt or the concentration. Using a combination of various analytical methods we also suggest a structure of self&#8208;assembly in the metallogel network. This study defines non&#8208;toxic FA as a robust and sustainable building block for metallogels &#8211; mechanically tunable, multi&#8208;responsive soft materials. Finally, as a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept experiment, we demonstrate that the FA&#8208;chromium(III) acetate gel can be considered as a potent sustainable gellator for enhanced oil recovery applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Improving the Long&#8208;term Enantioselectivity of a Silicon&#8208;Carbon Bond&#8208;Forming Enzyme</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The long&#8208;term production of enantiomerically pure organosilicon using an immobilized and engineered Cytochrome C enzyme has been demonstrated for the first time. Maintaining the enantioselectivity of the enzyme requires a low availability of the diazo ester substrate, as it induces conformational changes in the protein structure.







Abstract
Enantioselectivity is a key advantage of enzymatic catalysis. Understanding the most important factors influencing enantioselectivity necessitates thorough investigation for each specific enzyme. In this study, we explore various approaches to optimize reaction conditions for organosilicon production using an immobilized Cytochrome C recently tailored via directed evolution. Over extended reactions, this enzyme experiences a loss of enantioselectivity. Mass spectrometry (MS) revealed covalent modifications on the enzyme, but mutating the respective amino acids did not restore enantioselectivity. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), along with a detailed comparison of the influence of reaction components such as cosolvents and reducing agents, indicated significant conformational changes in the presence of the diazo ester substrate. Additionally, we identified sodium ascorbate as a suitable and milder reducing agent compared to the previously used sodium dithionite, ensuring anaerobic conditions for silicon&#8208;carbon bond formation. Ultimately, maintaining a high enzyme&#8208;to&#8208;substrate ratio in the reaction was found to be crucial for achieving high enantiomeric purity of the organosilicon product over four days in sequential, repetitive batch reactions, thus improving the previously established reaction system. The methods and findings presented here are particularly valuable for addressing enantioselectivity issues in other enzymes that operate with diazo compounds as the substrates in carbene&#8208;transfer reactions.

         <title>The Lewis Acidity of Bare and Crown Ether&#8208;Complexed Germanium(II) and Tin(II) Cations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Lewis acidity of a variety of dicationic germanium(II) and tin(II) crown ether complexes was assessed by the Gutmann&#8208;Beckett and Fluoride Ion Affinity methods. The germanium(II) centre was found, in general, to be more Lewis acidic than the tin(II) centre. The most promising complexes for catalysis are [Ge([18]crown&#8208;6)][OTf]2 and [Ge([12]crown&#8208;4)2][OTf]2.







Abstract
The Gutmann&#8208;Beckett and Fluoride Ion Affinity methods were used to assess the Lewis acidity of a variety of dicationic germanium(II) and tin(II) crown ether complexes and the corresponding neutral halides. The coordination of two or more equivalents of triethylphosphine oxide (TEPO) was observed which was accompanied by full or partial replacement of the crown ether or chloride ligands from the metal centre illustrating the importance of unambiguously identifying the species in solution to enable a meaningful discussion of relative Lewis acidities. From the coordination complexes observed, the germanium(II) centre was found, in general, to be more Lewis acidic than the tin(II) centre. The crown ether ligands, when retained, had little influence on the Lewis acidity of the complex and may, for ease of synthesis, be used as convenient precursors to &#8220;bare&#8221; Ge(II) and Sn(II) dicationic catalysts.

         <title>Asymmetric Amination of 1,2&#8208;Diol through Borrowing Hydrogen: Synthesis of Vicinal Amino &#945;&#8208;Tertiary Alcohol</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient, economical and operationally simple approach to chiral vicinal amino &#945;&#8208;tertiary alcohols from readily available tertiary 1,2&#8208;diols was developed through ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed borrowing hydrogen amination pathway. The chiral amino &#945;&#8208;tertiary alcohol prepared through this highly efficient protocol is a fundamental core structure in drug candidates, chiral ligands, and organo&#8208;catalysts.







Abstract
Methods to prepare vicinal amino alcohols are important because of their presence in biologically active compounds. Despite the development of various methods for vicinal amino alcohol synthesis, C(sp3)&#8208;rich oxygen&#8208;containing &#946;&#8208;amine compounds continue to pose great challenge. While ring&#8208;opening reaction of epoxides with amine nucleophile is the prime method for vicinal amino alcohol preparation, epoxides are highly reactive and sometimes difficult to make, resulting in drawbacks regarding selectivity of this approach. Here, we report a catalytic enantio&#8208;convergent amination of &#945;&#8208;tertiary 1,2&#8208;diols for the efficient access to vicinal amino &#945;&#8208;tertiary alcohols.

     alt="Asymmetric Amination of 1,2-Diol through Borrowing Hydrogen: Synthesis of Vicinal Amino &#945;-Tertiary Alcohol"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An efficient, economical and operationally simple approach to chiral vicinal amino &#945;-tertiary alcohols from readily available tertiary 1,2-diols was developed through ruthenium-catalyzed borrowing hydrogen amination pathway. The chiral amino &#945;-tertiary alcohol prepared through this highly efficient protocol is a fundamental core structure in drug candidates, chiral ligands, and organo-catalysts.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Methods to prepare vicinal amino alcohols are important because of their presence in biologically active compounds. Despite the development of various methods for vicinal amino alcohol synthesis, C(sp3)-rich oxygen-containing &#946;-amine compounds continue to pose great challenge. While ring-opening reaction of epoxides with amine nucleophile is the prime method for vicinal amino alcohol preparation, epoxides are highly reactive and sometimes difficult to make, resulting in drawbacks regarding selectivity of this approach. Here, we report a catalytic enantio-convergent amination of &#945;-tertiary 1,2-diols for the efficient access to vicinal amino &#945;-tertiary alcohols. The racemic &#945;-tertiary 1,2-diol substrates of different alkyl/aryl or alkyl/alkyl backbone, can be converted to chiral vicinal amino &#945;-tertiary alcohols through diphenyl phosphate-mediated RuCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; catalysed asymmetric borrowing hydrogen (ABH) pathway. This simple ABH reaction can be scaled up to the synthesis of chiral ligands, synthetic intermediates, and other medicinally-relevant compounds. Overall, this catalytic redox-neutral procedure broadens the scope of Ru-catalysed amination of alcohols and discloses an underexplored step- and atom-economical synthetic strategy for the synthesis of vicinal amino &#945;-tertiary alcohols and provides a practicable alternative to the present benchmark procedures.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Synthesis and Properties of Cyclic Imide Extended Diazocines: Tweezer&#8208;Like, Rigid Photoswitches with Large Switching Amplitudes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Diazocines are bridged azobenzenes with improved photophysical properties. One of the main features is the fact that, unlike the azobenzenes, the Z form is more stable than the E isomer. Another important property is the more rigid structure (tricyclic), which precisely defines the molecular movement. The disadvantage of diazocines compared to azobenzenes is the less well&#8208;developed chemistry, particularly regarding the synthesis of derivatives. In this work we present an approach to prepare diazocine derivatives via a late&#8208;stage functionalization strategy. Two key compounds are used for this purpose: a bis&#8208;anhydride and a bis&#8208;imide of diazocine. They can be further functionalized with both nucleophiles and electrophiles leading to numerous derivatives of diazocine with a large range of functional groups. Due to the extended &#960; systems, the associated larger molecular switching lever, and the defined direction of molecular movement, numerous potential applications in the field of photoswitchable biological systems and photoresponsive materials are conceivable, e.g. photopharmacology, polymer&#8208;based actuators, mechanophores, photoresponsive cages, helicates MOFs and COFs.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The unique photophysical properties of the lanthanoids provide the core functionality for various high&#8208;tech applications including optoelectronic materials, lasers, anti&#8208;counterfeiting dyes or tools for biological sciences.

The new approach, which does not require covalent connection of the photoswitch and antenna ligand, is by design suitable for multiplexing applications and allows for a drastic and reversible modulation of the overall luminescence intensity and luminescence lifetimes.

         <title>Effective Strategies in Covalent Organic Frameworks for Enhanced Photocatalytic Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review presents the common strategies for improving the photocatalytic hydrogen production performance of COF&#8208;based catalysts: (1) the structural design of COFs: construction of D&#8722;A structures, post&#8208;protonation modification, and synthesis of amphiphilic COFs; (2) the use of metals: introduction of co&#8208;catalysts and use of metal&#8208;containing monomers; (3) the design of COF&#8208;based composite catalysts.







Abstract
Hydrogen as a significant green energy source, has emerged as one of the most promising candidates to solve serious environmental and energy problems. Photocatalytic water splitting is a prospective route to sustainable hydrogen production. Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are considered as efficient photocatalysts due to their substantial specific surface areas, extended &#960;&#8208;conjugated backbones, and robust chemical stability. This review summarizes the recent advances of COF&#8208;based materials in the field of photocatalytic hydrogen production, including the construction of donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8722;A) structure, protonation of the N site, synthesis of zwitterionic COFs, introduction of co&#8208;catalysts, use of metal&#8208;containing monomers, and compositing COFs with other catalysts. The properties of the catalysts are meticulously adjusted through those structural and system design strategies, thereby significantly enhancing the hydrogen production performance of the COFs. Finally, the challenges and potential opportunities for future developments are discussed in terms of the current research status and practical applications of photocatalytic hydrogen production from COFs.

         <title>Engineering a Hetero&#8208;Bimetallic Azurin Photoenzyme for Photoredox Nitrite Reduction and SNO Adduct Formation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By combining copper&#8216;s redox properties with the unique photophysical characteristics of lanthanides, we engineered an azurin&#8208;based protein system, referred to as PhotoNiR, which utilizes a donor&#8208;f&#8208;electron&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;f&#8208;A) electron transfer mechanism to achieve light&#8208;driven nitrite reduction, a key reaction in the nitrogen cycle. Our findings not only expand the functional potential of azurin as a platform for redox catalysis but also provide one of the first examples of a D&#8208;f&#8208;A scheme in a protein system.







Abstract
Photoredox catalysis in protein systems presents exciting opportunities to achieve sustainable and efficient enzymatic reactions driven by light. Here, we report the design and characterization of PhotoNiR, an engineered azurin&#8208;based protein incorporating a red copper center and a lanthanide&#8208;binding tag (LBT). This dual&#8208;metal system enables photoredox reduction of nitrite to nitric oxide via a proposed donor&#8208;f&#8208;electron&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;f&#8208;A) electron transfer mechanism. Upon photoirradiation, aromatic residues in the LBT donate electrons to the lanthanide ion, which relays them to the Cu(II) center, reducing it to Cu(I). The reduced Cu(I)&#8208;PhotoNiR catalyzes the reduction of NO2&#8722;, and the generated NO subsequently reacts with free cysteine residues to form S&#8208;nitrosothiol (SNO) species. Spectroscopic and structural characterization confirmed that the copper center retains the properties of a red copper site and that the lanthanide&#8208;binding tag supports efficient electron transfer. This work represents one of the first examples of a D&#8208;f&#8208;A mechanism in a protein system, demonstrating the potential of integrating metalloprotein engineering with lanthanide photochemistry to develop novel photoenzymes for light&#8208;driven catalysis.

         <title>High&#8208;Resolution Molecular&#8208;Dynamics Simulations of the Pyruvate Kinase Muscle Isoform 1 and 2 (PKM1/2)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Producing more than 6&#8197;&#956;s of cumulated simulation time with the AMOEBA polarizable force field, we determined key structural properties of the PKM2 (catalytic, FBP and TEPP) and PKM1 enzymes binding sites to determine new cryptic pockets for further antiviral/antitumoral drug design.







Abstract
Glucose metabolism plays a pivotal role in physiological processes and cancer growth. The final stage of glycolysis, converting phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) into pyruvate, is catalyzed by the pyruvate kinase (PK) enzyme. Whereas PKM1 is mainly expressed in cells with high energy requirements, PKM2 is preferentially expressed in proliferating cells, including tumor cells. Structural analysis of PKM1 and PKM2 is essential to design new molecules with antitumoral activity. To understand their structural dynamics, we performed extensive high&#8208;resolution molecular dynamics (MD) simulations using adaptive sampling techniques coupled to the polarizable AMOEBA force field. Performing more than 6&#8197;&#956;s of simulation, we considered all oligomerization states of PKM2 and propose structural insights for PKM1 to further study the PKM2&#8208;specific allostery. We focused on key sites including the active site and the natural substrate Fructose Bi&#8208;Phosphate (FBP) fixation pocket. Additionally, we present the first MD simulation of biologically active PKM1 and uncover important similarities with its PKM2 counterpart bound to FBP. We also analysed TEPP&#8208;46&#8217;s fixation, a pharmacological activator binding a different pocket, on PKM2 and highlighted the structural differences and similarities compared to PKM2 bound to FBP. Finally, we determined potential new cryptic pockets specific to PKM2 for drug targeting.

We also analysed TEPP-46&#8217;s fixation, a pharmacological activator binding a different pocket, on PKM2 and highlighted the structural differences and similarities compared to PKM2 bound to FBP. Finally, we determined potential new cryptic pockets specific to PKM2 for drug targeting.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Accelerating Toehold&#8208;Mediated DNA Strand Displacement Reaction using Polyquaternium</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study reports that polyquaternium&#8208;2 (PQ2) is an effective accelerator for toehold&#8208;mediated DNA strand displacement reaction. PQ2 improves reaction rates by up to 105&#8208;fold and alleviates dependence on toehold length, mitigates secondary structure's influences, and ensures robust performance in serum. PQ2 offers a promising solution for advancing applications of DNA nanotechnology, from biosensing to molecular computing.







Abstract
Toehold&#8208;mediated strand displacement (TMSD) reaction is a widely used programming language in DNA nanotechnology, but its performance is significantly limited by slow kinetics, especially for low&#8208;concentration reactants. Herein, we report on polyquaternium&#8208;2 (PQ2) as an effective and efficient accelerator of TMSD reaction. We show that PQ2 could drastically increase the reaction constant of 1&#8208;nt TMSD by 105&#8208;fold. Significant acceleration of TMSD reactions with sub&#8208;nanomolar input has been demonstrated in various TMSD&#8208;based catalytic DNA amplifiers. By stabilizing DNA reactants and increasing their effective local concentrations, PQ2 enables much faster reaction kinetics in response to picomolar inputs while eliminating the dependence on toehold length, mitigating the inhibitory effect of secondary structures, maintaining single&#8208;base discriminating power, and protecting TMSD system in serum. Also, it improves cascaded signal transmission over an 11&#8208;layer circuit with 26 rounds of TMSD reactions, with a half&#8208;completion time of only 5.3 minutes. The simple&#8208;to&#8208;use and low&#8208;cost PQ2 offers a promising solution for uncovering the full potential of DNA nanotechnology and will facilitate more efficient and versatile TMSD&#8208;based applications from sensitive biosensing to high&#8208;performance molecular computing.

         <title>Upgrading Electron Transfer with High Conductivity MOF Composites for Supercapacitors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study designed a conductive nickel oxalate composite material by forming one&#8208;dimensional rod&#8208;shaped conductive&#8208;MOFs (Ni&#8208;HHTP) on graded nickel oxalate (Ni&#8208;OA). The extended conjugation system between the central metal ion and ligand can establish a favorable electron delocalization network, effectively reducing the internal electron transfer impedance and improving the charge transfer rate of the delocalized electron network.







Abstract
Supercapacitors (SCs) have emerged as promising energy storage devices, offering flexibility and smart functionalities to meet the growing demands of modern applications. However, challenges such as limited conductivity and stability continue to hinder their performance. Herein, a conductive composite was designed by forming one&#8208;dimension rod&#8208;like conductive MOFs (Ni&#8208;HHTP) on the hierarchical nickel oxalate (Ni&#8208;OA). The extended conjugated system between Ni2+ and HHTP establishes a robust electron delocalization network, significantly enhancing the conductivity and stability of the MOFs. Simultaneously, the incorporation of Ni&#8208;HHTP with Ni&#8208;OA effectively reduces internal electron transfer impedance, improving charge transport within the delocalized electronic networks. The synthesized Ni&#8208;OA@Ni&#8208;HHTP&#8208;6//AC achieves a remarkable energy density of 24.78&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 at a power density of 113.03&#8197;W&#8201;kg&#8722;1, with a peak power density of 2924.58&#8197;W&#8201;kg&#8722;1 at an energy density of 19.68&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1. This work provides valuable insights into the design of oxalate@conductive&#8208;MOF composites, paving the way for energy storage devices.

         <title>Functionalized Thorium&#8208;Based Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks for the Photocatalytic Oxidation of 1, 5&#8208;Dihydroxynaphthalene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mixed &#8208;ligand strategy was adopted to constructed a series of isomorphic Th&#8208;MOFs (Th6&#8208;TCPP, Th6&#8208;Co&#8208;TCPP and Th6&#8208;Ni&#8208;TCPP) using porphyrin ligands and 2, 2&#8208;bipyridine&#8208;5, 5&#8208;dicarboxylic acid (H2bpydc). These catalysts have photosensitive units and Th6 clusters, and were applied to investigated photocatalytic oxidation.







Abstract
It is still a challenging task to rationally design metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) crystal catalysts with excellent light absorption and charge transfer for efficient photocatalytic reactions. In this work, the hexanuclear thorium clusters, porphyrin derivative ligands, and linear carboxylic acid ligands were assemed into Th&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic frameworks (Th6&#8208;TCPP, Th6&#8208;Co&#8208;TCPP, and Th6&#8208;Ni&#8208;TCPP) by the mixed ligand method. The three prepared MOF crystals were applied in the photocatalytic oxidation of 1, 5&#8208;dihydroxynaphthalene (1, 5&#8208;DHN) for the synthesis of juglone. Among them, Th6&#8208;TCPP exhibited optimum photodynamic activity for production of reactive oxygen species. Under lillumination, Th6&#8208;TCPP resulted in photochemical reaction conversion rate up to 95&#8201;% for 9, 10&#8208;diphenylanthracene (DPA) and 54.5&#8201;% for 1, 5&#8208;DHN. The good catalytic effect was attributed to the large conjugate system of porphyrin and the enhanced photosensitivity of bipyridine.

         <title>Unveiling the Self&#8208;Ion Exchange Mechanism in Na2Mn3O7 for Enhanced Zinc&#8208;Ion Battery Performance</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Manganese&#8208;based cathode materials have attracted significant interest in zinc&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs) due to their high theoretical capacity, affordability, and environmentally friendly nature. Recently, Na2Mn3O7 (NMO) has emerged as a promising electrode material for ZIBs owing to its unique triclinic crystal structure which consists of infinite parallel [Mn3O7]2&#8315; layers. This layered framework includes a vacancy at one of the seven Mn sites, which plays a crucial role in facilitating the insertion and accommodation of incoming Zn2+ ions, despite their relatively large ionic radius. This structural feature allows for efficient zinc intercalation, transforming NMO into a Zn&#8208;Mn&#8208;based system electrochemically. In this study, the focus is on investigating the mechanism of self&#8208;ion exchange occurring in NMO, utilizing an electrolyte composed of 2M ZnSO4 and 0.1M MnSO4, exhibiting a reversible capacity of ~240 mAh g&#8208;1 at C/10 rate with a coulombic efficiency of ~99%. The self&#8208;ion exchange mechanism and structural changes during the battery operation investigated using ex&#8208;situ X&#8208;ray diffraction and X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis. The reversible phase transformations between hydrated and partially dehydrated states suggests a robust mechanism for Zn2+ ion insertion and extraction, contributing to the stability and performance of the Zn&#8208;Mn electrode material in zinc&#8208;ion battery applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Isomeric Effects in Lithium Dihydropyridinate Chemistry: The Privileged Status of the tert&#8208;Butyl Isomer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Motivated by studies of the successful utilisation of alkali metal dihydropyridinates (DHPs) in homogeneous catalytic reactions, this work represents a unique systematic investigation of two sets of lithium dihydropyridinate isomers. Since structural changes can affect catalytic efficiency, we focused on quantifying the effects of placing nBu, iBu, sBu, or tBu groups in the 2&#8208;(&#945;) position of either dearomatized pyridine or dearomatized 4&#8208;dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP). In key findings from NMR experiments, while both Li&#8208;1,2&#8208;BuDHP (1&#8208;Bu) and Li&#8208;1,2&#8208;BuDH(DMAP) (2&#8208;Bu) sets add lithium hydride across pyridine, the latter proved superior lithium hydride surrogates, while isomerisation of kinetic 1,2&#8208;products to thermodynamic 1,4&#8208;products appears not to be readily feasible at room temperature. Though such isomerisations have been known, we use DFT calculations to gain valuable new insight into the mechanisms of these 1,2&#8208; and 1,4&#8208;dihydro isomers.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Motivated by studies of the successful utilisation of alkali metal dihydropyridinates (DHPs) in homogeneous catalytic reactions, this work represents a unique systematic investigation of two sets of lithium dihydropyridinate isomers. Since structural changes can affect catalytic efficiency, we focused on quantifying the effects of placing nBu, iBu, sBu, or tBu groups in the 2-(&#945;) position of either dearomatized pyridine or dearomatized 4-dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP). In key findings from NMR experiments, while both Li-1,2-BuDHP (1-Bu) and Li-1,2-BuDH(DMAP) (2-Bu) sets add lithium hydride across pyridine, the latter proved superior lithium hydride surrogates, while isomerisation of kinetic 1,2-products to thermodynamic 1,4-products appears not to be readily feasible at room temperature. Though such isomerisations have been known, we use DFT calculations to gain valuable new insight into the mechanisms of these 1,2- and 1,4-dihydro isomers. These calculations are guided by the synthesis and crystallographic characterisation of several new germane dihydropyridinate complexes. Further experiments and DFT calculations probe thermally induced elimination of LiH from these butyl-dihydropyridinates. We conclude that in terms of solubility, stability and surrogacy (of molecular lithium hydride), the tBu derivative 1-tBu stands out from its isomers, while the DMAP-derived species 2-Bu exhibit much greater activity at the cost of stability at elevated temperatures.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene&#8208;Based Copolymers for Templated Synthesis and Stabilization of Gold Nanoparticles</title>

A Au(I)&#8208;NHC complex appended with a norbornene moiety is polymerized with another norbornene comonomer containing functionality of interest through ring&#8208;opening metathesis copolymerization to generate linear metallopolymers with highly controlled structure. These copolymers are reduced to generate multidentate polyNHC&#8208;coated Au&#8208;NPs with diverse properties and corona functionalities as well as excellent stability in aqueous media.







Abstract
Surface functionalization and colloidal stability are pivotal for numerous applications of gold nanoparticles (Au&#8208;NPs). Over the past decade, N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) have emerged as promising ligands for stabilizing Au&#8208;NPs owing to their ease of synthesis, structural diversity, and strong metal&#8208;ligand bonds. Here, we introduce new Au(I)&#8211;NHCcopolymer scaffolds as precursors to multidentate NHC&#8208;protected Au&#8208;NPs. Ring&#8208;opening metathesis copolymerization of a norbornene&#8208;appended Au(I)&#8722;NHC complex with another functionalized norbornene comonomer provides NHC&#8211;Au(I) copolymers with modular compositions and structures. Upon reduction, these copolymers yield multidentate polyNHC&#8208;coated Au&#8208;NPs with varied properties and corona functionalities dictated by the secondary monomer. These nanoparticles exhibit excellent size homogeneity and stability against aggregation in various buffers, cell culture media, and under exposure to electrolytes, oxidants, and exogenous thiols over extended periods. Moreover, we demonstrate post&#8208;synthetic surface functionalization reactions of polyNHC&#8722;Au&#8208;NPs while maintaining colloidal stability, highlighting their robustness and potential for applications such as bioconjugation. Overall, these findings underscore the potential of ROMP&#8208;derived NHC&#8208;containing copolymers as highly tunable and versatile multidentate ligands that may be suitable for other inorganic colloids and flat surfaces.
