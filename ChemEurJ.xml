         <title>In situ Real&#8208;Time Imaging of Benzyl&#8208;Naphthalimide Dyes Revealing Diverse Structural Evolution Dynamics at The Single&#8208;Assembly Level</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fluorescence imaging has emerged as a powerful technique for in situ monitoring of self&#8208;assembly dynamics, providing critical insights into structural evolution and functional potential. However, the inherent complexity of supramolecular systems presents significant challenges for real&#8208;time visualization, particularly in capturing the growth kinetics of individual assemblies and the hierarchical formation of network structures at the single&#8208;assembly level. Here, we visualized the dynamic growth and network formation of benzyl&#8208;naphthalimide dye assemblies in situ by confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM). In situ time&#8208;lapse imaging revealed distinct dynamic growth mechanisms among the three assemblies. Theoretical calculations demonstrated that different amino substituents significantly influenced assembly morphologies by modulating the planarity of the naphthalene ring. Furthermore, fluorescence lifetime imaging revealed pronounced intra&#8208;assembly heterogeneity, highlighting diverse molecular packing arrangements within individual assemblies. The confocal in situ visualization technique provided single&#8208;assembly growth dynamics, offering insights unattainable through conventional spectroscopic methods. Our work reveals that naphthalimide&#8208;based molecules can self&#8208;assemble into a variety of distinct architectures, underscoring their potential for designing advanced functional materials with tunable properties.</dc:description>

         <title>Dihalogens Binding and Activation by Imidazoline&#8208;2&#8208;Chalcogenone Model Derivatives: Insight from a Computational Approach</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chalcogenone donors represent a fundamental chemical class of compounds in the treatment of hyperthyroidism; particularly, imidazoline&#8208;based systems are associated with the strongest affinity for I2. Therefore, the reactivity of these types of donors with dihalogens may be insightful to understand the mechanism of action of popular drugs, such as methimazole (1&#8208;methyl&#8208;4&#8208;imidazoline&#8208;2&#8208;thione, MMI). In this work, the reactivity of 1,3&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;4&#8208;imidazoline&#8208;2&#8208;chalcogenone (S, Se, Te) with dihalogens X2 (X = Cl, Br, I) is evaluated for any combination through a systematic computational study. Three different products are found: a linear charge transfer (CT) &#8220;spoke&#8221; adduct, a &#8220;T&#8208;shaped&#8221; intermediate (TI) and a &#8220;T&#8208;shaped&#8221; hypercoordinate species (TY). The halogen and chalcogen effects are discussed separately as for the solvation effects. Furthermore, only the TY species formed from the reaction between 1,3&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;4&#8208;imidazoline&#8208;2&#8208;thione and I2 resulted to be disfavored with respect to the corresponding CT adduct; therefore, this peculiarity is rationalized in the framework of activation strain analysis. Lastly, a possible alternative mechanism involving the formation of a cationic intermediate species is considered.</dc:description>

         <title>Synergistically Designed Carbon&#8208;Free MoS2/MoO2 Heterostructure Anodes with Interfacial Covalent Bonds for High&#8208;Rate Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The study designs a carbon&#8208;free MoS2/MoO2 heterostructure with abundant heterointerfaces and strong chemical bonding. The formed S&#9472;O bonds generate an internal built&#8208;in electric field, endowing the heterostructure with metallic conductivity and high Na+ adsorption energy. The rational structural design ensures fast reaction kinetics and a stable heterointerface, enabling superior high&#8208;rate Na+&#8208;ion storage performance.








Abstract
The development of hierarchical heterostructured materials for sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) remains hindered by suboptimal high&#8208;rate cycling performance, primarily due to phase interface pulverization and separation during charge&#8211;discharge processes. To address these challenges, we designed a carbon&#8208;free hierarchical structure comprising few&#8208;layered MoS&#8322; nanosheets and MoO&#8322; nanocrystals through precise compositional optimization and rational structural engineering. The heterogeneous components are interconnected through robust S&#9472;O covalent bonds, which theoretical calculations and experimental results confirm generate a built&#8208;in electric field at the heterointerfaces, significantly enhancing reaction kinetics. Crucially, these covalent bonds stabilize the heterointerfaces, improving structural integrity and mitigating electrode material agglomeration and pulverization. Additionally, the MoS&#8322;/MoO&#8322; heterostructure enhances Na&#8314; adsorption energetics and reduces Na&#8314; diffusion barriers, facilitating efficient ion transport. Leveraging its abundant heterointerfaces and stable architecture, the composite delivers exceptional rate performance (432.7 mAh&#183;g&#8315;&#185; at 10 A&#183;g&#8315;&#185;) and outstanding cycling stability (nearly 100% capacity retention over 400 cycles at 5 A&#183;g&#8315;&#185;). This work provides a strategic framework for designing heterostructured materials with stable interface&#8208;rich architectures, advancing the development of high&#8208;performance conversion/alloy&#8208;type anodes for energy storage applications.

         <title>Osteosarcoma Cell and Osteosarcoma Stem Cell Potent Immunogenic Bi&#8208;Nuclear Gallium(III) Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Current treatment options are unable to benefit the majority of osteosarcoma patients with metastasized tumors (70&#8211;80% 5&#8208;year fatality rate). Osteosarcoma stem cells (OSCs), a small sub&#8208;population of osteosarcoma cells with stem cell&#8208;like properties, are thought to play a role in the spread of osteosarcoma. In this manuscript, we report the first metal complex to evoke an immunogenic response toward both bulk osteosarcoma cells and OSCs.








Abstract
We report the synthesis, characterization, anti&#8208;osteosarcoma and anti&#8208;osteosarcoma stem cells (OSC) properties (cytotoxic and immunogenic) of a series of bi&#8208;nuclear gallium(III) complexes with tridentate Schiff base ligands and 8&#8208;hydroxyquinoline (1&#8211;4). According to monolayer cytotoxicity studies, 1&#8211;4 display micromolar potency toward bulk osteosarcoma cells and OSCs. The most effective complex in series 2 is up to 13&#8208;fold more potent toward OSCs than cisplatin and carboplatin (the only metallodrugs used in the clinic to treat osteosarcoma). Remarkably, the bi&#8208;nuclear gallium(III) complexes 1&#8211;4 are significantly more potent toward 3D&#8208;cultured sarcospheres than OSCs cultured in monolayers indicating effective penetration of the sarcosphere multicellular architecture. The bi&#8208;nuclear gallium(III) complexes 1&#8211;4 are up to 53&#8208;fold more potent toward sarcospheres than cisplatin and carboplatin. Mechanistic studies show that gallium(III) complex 2 kills osteosarcoma cells by caspase&#8208;dependent apoptosis and paraptosis, leading to the release of danger&#8208;associated molecular patterns associated with immunogenic cell death. Osteosarcoma cells and OSCs treated with gallium(III) complex 2 are effectively phagocytosed by immune cells, highlighting its immunogenic potential. As far as it is known, gallium(III) complex 2 is the first metal complex to evoke an immunogenic response toward both bulk osteosarcoma cells and OSCs.

         <title>Visible Light&#8208;induced C&#8208;C Bond Cleavage for the Construction of Ketone Using Molecular Oxygen</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The selective cleavage of carbon&#8208;carbon bonds by photocatalysis with the participation of oxygen for ketone synthesis and drug derivatization is reported. In this oxidation&#8208;based ketone formation reaction, molecular oxygen complexes with the substrate, which is subsequently photoexcited to generate a charge transfer (CT) state. This CT state facilitates energy transfer with molecular oxygen, producing singlet oxygen, which facilitates hydrogen atom process and promotes the subsequent cleavage of the carbon&#8208;carbon bond, ultimately leading to the formation of aryl ketone compounds. 48 aryl ketone compounds and pharmaceutical derivatives were synthesized using this method. A notable feature of this reaction is its catalyst&#8208;free, additive&#8208;free, and transition metals&#8208;free nature, combined with green, mild, and environmentally friendly reaction conditions, enabling high yields.</dc:description>

         <title>Chalcogen Vacancies as Key Drivers of Distinct Physicochemistry in MoS2, MoSe2, and MoTe2 for Selective Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 23, April 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reveals that chalcogen vacancies not only enhance the surface reactivity of Mo&#8208;based TMD monolayers &#8211; MoS2, MoSe2, and MoTe2 &#8211; but also amplify differences in their physicochemical properties, leading to distinct surface interactions. This effect originates from the intrinsic characteristics of Mo&#8211;X bonding in these monolayers.







Abstract
The catalytic performance of Mo&#8208;based transition&#8208;metal&#8208;dichalcogenide (TMD) monolayers is intrinsically tied to their physicochemical properties. However, the limited chemical diversity among these materials constrains their versatility for key catalytic processes, including carbon dioxide (CRR), nitrogen (NRR), and oxygen (ORR) reduction reactions. This study employs density functional theory (DFT) calculations to investigate the impact of chalcogen vacancies on the properties of 

MoS2

 ${{\rm{MoS}}_2 }$



, 

MoSe2

 ${{\rm{MoSe}}_2 }$



, and 

MoTe2

 ${{\rm{MoTe}}_2 }$



, focusing on the adsorption behaviors of CO, NO, and 

NO2

 ${{\rm{NO}}_2 }$



. The findings reveal that chalcogen vacancies not only enhance surface reactivity but also impart distinctive physicochemical characteristics to each TMD. These effects arise from intrinsic bonding differences, resulting in distinct charge availability at exposed Mo atoms and variations in vacancy dimensions, which shape specific surface interactions. Hence, while adsorption differences between pristine surfaces are generally negligible for catalysis, vacancies amplify them by over an order of magnitude, resulting in pronounced material&#8208;specific behaviors. Moreover, varying vacancy dimensions affect how species incorporate into defects, further enhancing the differences. These characteristics unlock substantial potential of TMD sheets for distinct surface chemistries, transforming them from relatively similar to markedly different as defect density rises. Consequently, our findings provide insights for tailoring these materials toward applications in electro&#8208; and photocatalysis.

         <title>Constructing AgO/Ag2O Electrocatalysts with Highly Exposed and Tightly Contacted Active Facets for Efficient Oxygen Evolution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 23, April 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A kind of Ag&#8208;based electrode with the highly exposed and tightly contacted AgO (&#8722;111) and Ag2O (111) active facets was constructed for efficient electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction. This work can help understand the effects of crystal orientation and crystal face interface on electrocatalytic activity.







Abstract
The development of efficient electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and the elucidation of their underlying mechanisms are crucial for overcoming the low efficiency of hydrogen production through the electrolysis of water. Utilizing the electrochemical anodic oxidation method, a series of silver&#8208;based electrocatalysts (Ag&#8208;x, where x signifies the applied direct current (DC) voltage, x=0, 5, 10, 15) were prepared employing metallic silver wire as the anode under DC voltages. The resulting silver&#8208;based electrodes have been oxidized and reconstructed, yielding AgO/Ag2O composite on the surface. Notably, the Ag&#8208;10 electrode exhibited the lowest overpotential (399&#8197;mV at 50&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and 456&#8197;mV at 100&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2), along with good stability. The superior OER performance of Ag&#8208;10 is not only attributed to the high exposure and tight interface of the AgO (&#8722;111) and Ag2O (111) crystal phases, as well as the higher prevalence of Ag&#8722;O&#8722;O&#8722;Ag species on its surface, but also its larger electrochemical active surface area (ECSA). This work provides insight for the synthesis of metal oxide&#8208;based electrocatalysts and understanding the electrocatalytic mechanism.

         <title>A Bivalent Iridium(III) Complex Toolkit for Mitochondrial DNA G&#8208;Quadruplex&#8208;Targeted Theranostics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 23, April 22, 2025. </description>

We present a bivalent iridium(III) complex toolkit for targeting mitochondrial DNA Gquadruplexes, which has the merits of multicolor, ability to discriminate TNBC cells and modular phototheranostics.







Abstract
The G&#8208;quadruplex (G4) is an important diagnostic and therapeutic target in cancers, but the development of theranostic probes for subcellular G4&#8197;s remains challenging. In this work, we report three G4&#8208;targeted theranostic probes by conjugating a pyridostatin&#8208;derived G4 ligand to G4&#8208;specific iridium(III) complexes with desirable photophysical properties. These probes showed specifically enhanced luminescence to mitochondrial G4 in triple&#8208;negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells. Of note, complex 3 exhibited NIR emission and the ability to discriminate TNBC cells and normal breast cells. Furthermore, these probes showed much higher PDT toxicity in TNBC cells through ROS&#8208;induced apoptosis, where complex 3 exhibited a type I/II hybrid PDT effect with the potential to overcome hypoxia. These results demonstrate that these complexes are multicolor and modular phototheranostic probes for DNA G4s. We believe that this work offers a multifunctional theranostic toolkit for unmasking subcellular DNA G&#8208;quadruplex functions.

         <title>Formation of TEMPO Adducts with Hydrogen Atom Transfer: An Alternative Pathway to Versatile Hydrofunctionalizations of Olefins</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 23, April 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A two&#8208;step cobalt&#8208;catalyzed method is developed for the hydrofunctionalization of olefins, involving TEMPO adduct formation followed by photocatalytic nucleophilic substitution. This approach enables the formation of C&#8722;C, C&#8722;N, C&#8722;O, C&#8722;F, and C&#8722;Cl bonds with high efficiency. The method demonstrates potential for PET applications with hydrofluorination and offers an alternative pathway to diastereoselective olefin hydration.







Abstract
A two&#8208;step process is developed to access a broad range of hydrofunctionalization of olefins, by combining a cobalt&#8208;catalyzed formation of TEMPO adduct from olefins and a photocatalytic nucleophilic addition to generate a new C&#8722;C, C&#8722;N, C&#8722;O, C&#8722;F, and C&#8722;Cl bond. Nucleophilic fluorination can be achieved with a short reaction time, showing its potential in PET applications. Combining the two steps, net hydrofunctionalization of olefins with a broad range has been achieved.

&lt;p&gt;A two-step process is developed to access a broad range of hydrofunctionalization of olefins, by combining a cobalt-catalyzed formation of TEMPO adduct from olefins and a photocatalytic nucleophilic addition to generate a new C&#8722;C, C&#8722;N, C&#8722;O, C&#8722;F, and C&#8722;Cl bond. Nucleophilic fluorination can be achieved with a short reaction time, showing its potential in PET applications. Combining the two steps, net hydrofunctionalization of olefins with a broad range has been achieved.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Reusable CuO NPs Catalyzed Chemodivergent Transfer Hydrogenation of Azoarenes to Hydrazoarenes and Aniline Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 23, April 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Easy to synthesize CuO NPs catalyzed effective chemodivergent transfer hydrogenation of azoarenes to aniline derivatives and hydrazoarenes under mild conations using ammonia borane is demonstrated. A series of control experiments and deuterium labelling experiments were carried out to understand the catalytic process. Furthermore, the catalyst was recycled up to six consecutive cycles with no significant decrease in catalytic activity.







Abstract
The selective synthesis of different products from a substrate employing a single catalyst by altering the reaction conditions is challenging. Herein, easy&#8208;to&#8208;synthesize and cheap CuO NPs catalyzed chemodivergent transfer hydrogenation (TH) of azoarenes to hydrazoarenes and aniline derivatives using ammonia borane (AB) under mild conditions is disclosed. The practical applicability of the protocol was demonstrated by the gram&#8208;scale synthesis of hydrazo and aniline derivatives as well as by the reduction of a few commercially used dyes such as methyl red, sudan I, sudan III and solvent yellow 7. Several control experiments and deuterium labelling experiments were performed to understand the reaction mechanism. Moreover, the catalyst can be recycled up to six times without considerable loss of catalytic activity.

         <title>Accelerating Toehold&#8208;Mediated DNA Strand Displacement Reaction using Polyquaternium</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 23, April 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study reports that polyquaternium&#8208;2 (PQ2) is an effective accelerator for toehold&#8208;mediated DNA strand displacement reaction. PQ2 improves reaction rates by up to 105&#8208;fold and alleviates dependence on toehold length, mitigates secondary structure's influences, and ensures robust performance in serum. PQ2 offers a promising solution for advancing applications of DNA nanotechnology, from biosensing to molecular computing.







Abstract
Toehold&#8208;mediated strand displacement (TMSD) reaction is a widely used programming language in DNA nanotechnology, but its performance is significantly limited by slow kinetics, especially for low&#8208;concentration reactants. Herein, we report on polyquaternium&#8208;2 (PQ2) as an effective and efficient accelerator of TMSD reaction. We show that PQ2 could drastically increase the reaction constant of 1&#8208;nt TMSD by 105&#8208;fold. Significant acceleration of TMSD reactions with sub&#8208;nanomolar input has been demonstrated in various TMSD&#8208;based catalytic DNA amplifiers. By stabilizing DNA reactants and increasing their effective local concentrations, PQ2 enables much faster reaction kinetics in response to picomolar inputs while eliminating the dependence on toehold length, mitigating the inhibitory effect of secondary structures, maintaining single&#8208;base discriminating power, and protecting TMSD system in serum. Also, it improves cascaded signal transmission over an 11&#8208;layer circuit with 26 rounds of TMSD reactions, with a half&#8208;completion time of only 5.3 minutes. The simple&#8208;to&#8208;use and low&#8208;cost PQ2 offers a promising solution for uncovering the full potential of DNA nanotechnology and will facilitate more efficient and versatile TMSD&#8208;based applications from sensitive biosensing to high&#8208;performance molecular computing.

         <title>Electrochemical Removal Of Doxycycline Hydrochloride with Cerium&#8208;Aluminum Catalytic Anode</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 23, April 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, a cerium&#8208;aluminum bimetallic catalyst is fired using a one&#8208;step hydrothermal method, and a modified carbon fabric anode is created. Electrochemical degradation of doxycycline hydrochloride without additional oxidizing agents shows excellent results. Simultaneously, several cycle degradation studies yield outstanding results, and a degradation mechanism was presented by characterization and analysis.







Abstract
Doxycycline hydrochloride (DOX) is a widely used broad&#8208;spectrum antibiotic that is challenging to degrade, leading to a series of environmental issues. In this study, a bimetallic oxide catalyst was synthesized through hydrothermal calcination followed by annealing. The catalytic carbon cloth anode was fabricated by bonding materials directly onto carbon cloth. Various characterization methods were employed to analyze the surface morphology, composition, and electrochemical properties of the electrodes. The materials exhibited rich surface morphology and exceptional electrochemical surface area. The catalyst primarily consisted of CeO2 and CeAlO3, demonstrating a 93.85&#8201;% removal efficiency of DOX within 2&#8197;hours under optimized conditions. Even after seven consecutive degradation cycles, the DOX degradation rate remained at 82&#8201;%, confirming the remarkable stability of the electrodes. The product distribution generated during the degradation of DOX was identified using LC&#8211;MS analysis, and a potential electrochemical degradation mechanism was proposed. Our results indicate that the bimetallic hybrid coordination significantly enhances the catalytic activity and electrochemical stability of the materials. This work offers a novel approach for preparing modified carbon cloth anodes with high catalytic activity and durability, laying a crucial foundation for the efficient degradation of the antibiotic DOX.

         <title>Tunable G&#8208;Quadruplex Ligands: Azobenzene Derivatives for Light&#8208;Controlled DNA Modulation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 23, April 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Azobenzene (AB) is a promising light&#8208;responsive motif for targeting G&#8208;quadruplexes (G4&#8197;s) and enabling their light&#8208;controlled modulation. We synthesized a series of novel AB derivatives with diverse structural variations, demonstrating that the interaction mode influences its ability to modulate G4 properties bidirectionally. These findings highlight critical design principles for optimizing photoactive G4 ligands.







Abstract
During transcription, replication, and DNA repair, DNA unwinds to reveal guanine&#8208;rich sequences that form stable G&#8208;quadruplexes. In cancer cells, increased transcription and replication promote G4 formation, making them attractive therapeutic targets. G4&#8197;s block DNA and RNA polymerases, inducing replication stress and causing toxic single&#8208; and double&#8208;strand breaks. Small&#8208;molecule ligands can stabilize G4 structures, prolonging their effects and exacerbating replication stress. However, most G4 ligands operate through a one&#8208;way mechanism that remains permanent over time. A more versatile approach involves systems that can switch between active and inactive states on demand using external stimuli, such as light. This study aims to deepen knowledge of the current state of the design of photoactive G4&#8208;ligand through the synthesis of azobenzene&#8208;based compounds that vary in substitution patterns, size of the substituent, electronic effects, and molecular structure. Using orthogonal biophysical methods and quantum&#8208;chemical calculations, we evaluate how these factors affect the compounds&#8217; ability to bind and stabilize G4 structures. Importantly, our results demonstrate that the interaction mode of the trans isomer with G4 influences its ability to modulate G4 properties bidirectionally. These findings provide insights for designing photoactive G4 ligands with tunable on&#8208;off functionality, paving the way for precise control of G4 structures in biological systems.

         <title>The Chemistry of Anticancer Mononuclear and N&#8208;Bridged Dinuclear 8&#8208;Aminoquinoline Half&#8208;sandwich Metal Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 23, April 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
8&#8208;Aminoquinoline half&#8208;sandwich metal chlorido complexes were found to undergo conversion into dimetallic analogues under basic conditions and/or by the addition of AgNO3 to abstract the chlorido ligand. In in&#8197;vitro anticancer activity studies, the dimetallic complexes were found to be in general more potent than the mononuclear analogues which can be explained by higher uptake into cancer cells.







Abstract
Piano&#8208;stool complexes of ruthenium and other platinum group metals have shown promising preclinical results as anticancer agents, often with alternative modes of action to traditional platinum&#8208;based compounds. Quinoline is considered a privileged structure in medicinal chemistry and many complexes with potent anticancer activity have been reported. To assess the effect of incorporating bidentate 8&#8208;aminoquinoline&#8208;&#951;2N&#8208;1,N&#8208;8 (AQH) ligands in half&#8208;sandwich piano&#8208;stool metal complexes of the general formula [M(L)(AQH)Cl]+, the respective Ru, Os (L=&#951;6&#8208;p&#8208;cymene), Rh and Ir (L=&#951;5&#8208;pentamethylcyclopentadienyl) complexes were prepared. Deprotonation of AQH during the reaction gave dinuclear [M(L)(AQ)]22+ complexes with the deprotonated &#956;&#8208;&#954;1N&#8208;8&#8208;aminoquinolinato&#8208;&#951;2N&#8208;1,N&#8208;8 (AQ) ligands acting as bridges between the metal centers. Conversion of the mononuclear Ru, Rh and Ir compounds to the dimetallic analogues was facilitated under basic conditions and improved for the Ru derivative by the addition of AgNO3 to abstract the chlorido ligand. In in&#8197;vitro anticancer activity studies, the dimetallic complexes were in general more potent than mononuclear analogues. The higher activity of the dimetallic compounds can be explained by higher uptake into cancer cells, as demonstrated for the respective Ru complexes, while zebrafish embryo studies demonstrated low toxicity, irrespective of the number of metal centers in the complexes.

         <title>Phenylalanine&#8208;Based Amphiphilic Self&#8208;Assembled Materials: Gels or Crystals?</title>

Pal&#8208;Phe&#8208;OH is a very efficient gelator in contrast with Az&#8208;(Phe&#8208;OH)2 that efficiently forms crystals, while Lau&#8208;Phe&#8208;OH forms metastable hydrogels that slowly become crystals. X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis demonstrate that Lau&#8208;Phe&#8208;OH and Pal&#8208;Phe&#8208;OH easily form hetero&#8208;intermolecular hydrogen bonds between the carboxylic and amidic groups, while Az&#8208;(Phe&#8208;OH)2 forms homo&#8208;intermolecular hydrogen bonds, which leads to an extended and robust 2D hydrogen bonding network.







Abstract
We prepared three simple molecules, that we chose as representative examples of amphiphilic and bolamphiphilic amino acid derivatives: N&#8208;lauroyl&#8208;L&#8208;phenylalanine (Lau&#8208;Phe&#8208;OH), N&#8208;palmitoyl&#8208;L&#8208;phenylalanine (Pal&#8208;Phe&#8208;OH), N,N&#8208;azeloyl&#8208;L&#8208;diphenylalanine Az&#8208;(Phe&#8208;OH)2, to study the influence of the aliphatic side chain on the formation of supramolecular materials. We found that Pal&#8208;Phe&#8208;OH is a very efficient gelator in contrast with Az&#8208;(Phe&#8208;OH)2 that efficiently forms crystals, while Lau&#8208;Phe&#8208;OH forms metastable hydrogels that slowly become crystals. We demonstrated by X&#8208;ray diffraction that Lau&#8208;Phe&#8208;OH and Pal&#8208;Phe&#8208;OH easily form hetero&#8208;intermolecular hydrogen bonds between the carboxylic and amidic groups, while Az&#8208;(Phe&#8208;OH)2 forms homo&#8208;intermolecular hydrogen bonds, i.&#8201;e., the typical carboxylic ring dimer and chains between the amidic functions, which leads to an extended and robust 2D hydrogen bonding network. Moreover, Lau&#8208;Phe&#8208;OH is more ordered than Pal&#8208;Phe&#8208;OH and the comparison of these results clearly indicates that the reduced order of Pal&#8208;L&#8208;Phe&#8208;OH is the main reason for the efficiency of this molecule as supergelator.

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Magnesium Organic Batteries using Renewable Biomolecule&#8208;Based Cathode</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 23, April 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biomass&#8208;based molecule (emodin) have been utilized for the first time as cathode in rechargeable magnesium batteries (RMBs), exhibiting high specific capacity and excellent diffusion kinetics. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicate that two emodin molecules can form a stable structure capable of incorporating two magnesium ions when arranged with central inversion.







Abstract
Rechargeable magnesium batteries (RMBs) exhibit significant potential in large&#8208;scale energy storage due to their features of high volumetric capacity, resistance to dendrite formation, and abundant magnesium resources. However, the high polarity of divalent Mg2+ ions results in sluggish diffusion kinetics in conventional inorganic cathode materials, adversely affecting reversible capacity and rate performance. Organic materials such as pyrene&#8208;4,5,9,10&#8208;tetrone (PTO) and 3,4,9,10&#8208;perylenetetracarboxylic dianhydride (PTCDA), achieve rapid and reversible intercalation of magnesium ions through carbonyl enolization, but these materials are challenged by high cost, complex preparation, and poor environmental friendliness. In this study, we employ a carbonyl&#8208;rich biomass&#8208;based small molecule, emodin, as a cathode material for RMBs, achieving rapid diffusion kinetics and notable magnesium storage performance. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicate that two emodin molecules can form a stable structure capable of incorporating two magnesium ions when arranged with central inversion. This work demonstrates the feasibility of using biomass materials to prepare high&#8208;performance cathodes for RMBs and provides a novel approach for the development of high&#8208;performance organic cathode materials.

         <title>Influence of a 2nd Sphere Hydrogen&#8208;Bond Donor on the Reactivity of Non&#8208;heme Fe(II) Complexes in Alkane, Alkene and Aromatic Oxidation with H2O2</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 23, April 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Addition of a 2nd sphere hydrogen bond donor in iron complexes induces the selection of a specific FeIIIOOH species in the presence of H2O2 thanks to the stabilizing H&#8208;bonding interaction with the proximal O. This structural pattern, after OO bond cleavage, enhances the electrophilicity of the resulting high valent oxo species, which improves epoxidation yields.







Abstract
Two iron(II) complexes of the pentadentate aminopyridine ligand L52(OH), bearing a 2nd sphere OH group in ortho position of one pyridine, were studied in the oxidation of various substrates using H2O2. While the addition of the OH group lowers the yields of alkane and aromatic oxidation, it improves the yield in alkene epoxidation. Spectroscopic analyses suggest that the pyridine&#8208;OH group stabilizes an Fe(III)OOH intermediate by hydrogen&#8208;bonding with the proximal O atom of hydroperoxo, but also eventually drives the system towards a dimeric structure, which competes with the oxidation process. The improvement in epoxidation yields is proposed to result from the fast reaction of cyclooctene with the active species, together with an enhanced oxidizing power induced by the hydrogen&#8208;bonding pattern.

         <title>Light&#8208;Triggered Reversible Helicity Switching of a Rotor by a Photo&#8208;Responsive Plier</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 23, April 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, we present a binary system consisting of an achiral bis&#8208;zinc&#8208;porphyrin rotor and a chiral diazo&#8208;containing photoswitch with two pyridine termini that coordinate to the bis&#8208;zinc porphyrin, forming a 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 complex. Upon photoisomerization of the diazo group from the E to the Z configuration, drastic structural rearrangements occur throughout the complex, leading to a change in its helicity of bound porphyrin. Exposure to light of a different wavelength reverses this transformation, restoring the original complex.







Abstract
Controlling synchronized motion and transmission of molecular motion to a remotely located guest is not trivial. Here, we demonstrate a light&#8208;triggered, scissor&#8208;like conformational change in a molecular plier to reversibly alter the conformation and helical chirality of a noncovalently bound rotor. The plier comprises three building blocks: an azobenzene unit that controls the open&#8208;close motion of the plier upon light&#8208;activated isomerization from E to Z, a BINOL unit that serves as both a hinge and a chiral inducer and two pyridine moieties that can form a complex with the rotor guest. The light&#8208;induced conformational alteration of the plier was unequivocally demonstrated by 1H NMR, UV&#8208;Vis, and CD spectroscopy. The open&#8208;close motion of the plier was translated to the rotor via a 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 host&#8208;guest complex. Indeed, CD spectroscopy, NMR spectroscopy, thermal back isomerization studies, and molecular modelling confirm that the light&#8208;triggered conformational alterations of the plier can induce mechanical twisting and helicity switching in the rotor.

&lt;p&gt;Here, we present a binary system consisting of an achiral bis-zinc-porphyrin rotor and a chiral diazo-containing photoswitch with two pyridine termini that coordinate to the bis-zinc porphyrin, forming a 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 complex. Upon photoisomerization of the diazo group from the &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt; to the &lt;i&gt;Z&lt;/i&gt; configuration, drastic structural rearrangements occur throughout the complex, leading to a change in its helicity of bound porphyrin. Exposure to light of a different wavelength reverses this transformation, restoring the original complex.
&lt;/p&gt;

Crystal structures of Cu&#8208;MOF: by changing coordination metal and the position of nitrogen atom in pyridine&#8208;based photochromic ligand, we successfully synthesised a novel photochromic copper&#8208;based MOF using 9,10&#8208;bis(di(pyridine&#8208;3&#8208;yl)methylene)&#8208;9,10&#8208;dihydroanthracene as the photochromic ligand. Structural analysis revealed a 3D porous architecture (see picture). The Cu&#8208;MOF exhibited exceptional photoelectric properties, demonstrating potential as an anode material for lithium&#8208;ion batteries and a luminescent MnO&#8324;&#8722; sensor.







Abstract
Photo&#8208;stimulated Polymers have garnered significant attention for their potential applications ranging from optical memory to sensing. Herein, by changing coordination metal and the position of nitrogen atom in pyridine&#8208;based photo&#8208;stimulated ligand, we successfully synthesised a novel photo&#8208;stimulated copper&#8208;based MOF (Cu&#8208;MOF) using 9,10&#8208;bis(di(pyridine&#8208;3&#8208;yl)methylene)&#8208;9,10&#8208;dihydroanthracene as the photo&#8208;stimulated ligand. Structural analysis revealed a 3D porous architecture, offering a distinct advantage over previously reported 1D coordination polymer using similar photo&#8208;stimulated ligand. The Cu&#8208;MOF exhibited exceptional photoelectric properties, demonstrating potential as an anode material for lithium&#8208;ion batteries and a luminescent MnO&#8324;&#8722; sensor. Its electrochemical performance revealed high reversibility, with discharge capacities retaining stability under varying current densities. Additionally, the Cu&#8208;MOF displayed notable photo&#8208;stimulated behavior under UV light irradiation, enhancing its optical properties. Although the structure changes from 1D coordination polymer to 3D MOF, the photocyclized form (c&#8208;Cu MOF) still exhibited superior fluorescence quenching efficiency and sensitivity for MnO&#8324;&#8722; detection with Ksv (quenching constant) 5.24&#215;105&#8197;M&#8722;1. This work highlights the utility of Cu&#8208;MOF as a multifunctional material for energy storage and environmental sensing applications.

         <title>Facile Synthesis of Ultramicroporous Organic&#8208;Linked Zincophosphate with High Thermal, Chemical and Water Stabilities</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 23, April 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study introduces a strategy to enhance ultramicroporous materials for CO2 separation by improving stability and scalability. Through topotactic proton replacement with metal ions in bpy&#8208;pillared zincophosphates, a bimetal phosphate, VZn&#8208;bpy&#8208;w, was developed, showing exceptional stability (pH 2&#8211;12, boiling water). A rapid synthesis reduced production time to 3&#8197;hours, with vanadyl groups providing strong sheets and metal sites for CO2 adsorption.







Abstract
The application of ultramicroporous materials for CO2 separation is limited by the rarity of materials exhibiting stability and rapid scale&#8208;up characteristics. In this study, we propose a rational approach to enhance the structural stability and durability of the pillared layer structure. Through the topotactic replacement of protons with metal ions in the parent 4,4&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine (bpy)&#8208;pillared zincophosphate, we observed the formation of edge&#8208;sharing dimers of ZnO4N and PO4, as well as the insertion of (VOH2O)2+ into the zinc phosphate layers. This resulted in the modified bpy&#8208;pillared bimetal phosphate, [(VOH2O)(ZnPO4)2(bpy)]&#8901;4H2O (denoted as NTHU&#8208;16 or VZn&#8208;bpy&#8208;w), which exhibits exceptional structural stability in a wide pH range (pH&#8197;2&#8208;12) and boiling water. Additionally, a rapid scale&#8208;up process reduced the synthesis time of VZn&#8208;bpy&#8208;w from 48&#8197;hours to just 3&#8197;hours, significantly increasing efficiency. The vanadyl groups, with easily displaced coordinated water, enhance the strength of the inorganic sheets and create available metal sites for the adsorption and separation of CO2. This combined strategy of structural enhancement and rapid synthesis offers a new pathway for engineering stable, porous metal phosphates and designing novel organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid materials with potential applications in CO2 separation.

Specific ring&#8208;in&#8208;rings assembly is achieved using box&#8208;like molecules and hydrogen bonded aramide macrocycle through an interplay of multiple non&#8208;covalent bonding interactions, revealing the importance of the effect of molecular structures and conformational adaptivity upon the assembling outcome.







Abstract
The controlled formation of ring&#8208;in&#8208;ring(s) assemblies is highly desirable as precursors for constructing higher order supramolecular architectures. We report our findings that this goal can be achieved by balancing molecular structures and conformational adaptivity through an interplay of multiple non&#8208;covalent bonding interactions. With hydrogen&#8208;bonded (H&#8208;bonded) aramide macrocycles and box&#8208;like molecules including naph&#8208;Box, m&#8208;Box and p4p&#8208;Box, ring&#8208;in&#8208;rings assembling systems with 4&#8201;:&#8201;1 stoichiometry are preferentially created. The formation of such assemblies with a defined number of rings threaded on a Box molecule is unprecedented using 2D shape&#8208;persistent macrocycles. The unusual assembly behaviors are rationalized by the aid of NMR spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, X&#8208;ray crystallography, and xTB computation. In sharp contrast to the use of o&#8208;Box and p&#8208;Box in forming ring&#8208;in&#8208;rings complexes where a distribution of various assembled species is observed, the box&#8208;like molecules all afford monodisperse compact assemblies. Conformational adaptivity is deemed as one of the major factors that is accountable for the selectivity observed, which is driven mainly by cooperative action of multiple non&#8208;covalent bonding interactions including H&#8208;bonding and &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking interactions. Using pyrimidyl&#8208;incorporated H&#8208;bonded macrocycles and box&#8208;like molecules to form ring&#8208;in&#8208;rings assembling structures may provide opportunities for designing more sophisticated and topologically unique supramolecular systems with potential functions.

         <title>Tuning Decomposition Temperature: A Structural Study of Ligand Directed Bonding and Fluxionality</title>

In this work, we have investigated the design and synthesis of aluminium compounds via systematic variation of ligand type. This is the first example of a ligand directed design and study of aluminium compounds which decompose at low temperatures (&lt;200&#8201;&#176;C). Their dynamic properties have also been investigated, with a focus on the decomposition profiles.







Abstract
In the first study of its kind towards the design and synthesis of easy&#8208;to&#8208;handle aluminium precursors that decompose at temperatures &lt;200&#8201;&#176;C: informed ligand choice and structural design of the compounds has caused inbuilt fluxionality leading to a markable decrease in the onset of decomposition temperatures. Eight thiourea ligands [L1H&#8211;L8H] were chosen with the steric bulk on the N atoms of these ligands varied systematically [L1&#8722;4H: RN(H)CS(NMe2) and L5&#8722;8H: RN(H)CS(NEt2); R=Me (L1H and L5H), Et (L2H and L6H), iPr (L3H and L7H) and Ph (L4H and L8H). Three families of aluminium compounds were synthesised by the reaction of these thiourea ligands with trimethylamine alane [Al(Lx)3 (1&#8211;7), trimethylaluminium [MeAl(Lx)2] (8&#8211;11) and triethylaluminium [EtAl(Lx)2] (12&#8211;14) respectively. The three most spatially encumbered compounds (Al(L3)3 (2), Al(L6)3 (5) and Al(L7)3 (6) are highly fluxional in solution and displayed lengthening of the Al&#8722;N bond as compared to the other compounds. Both factors directly affect the activation temperature of these compounds. The remaining compounds were not shown to display any of these behaviours and consequently have higher thermal decomposition temperatures. SCXRD, 1H and 13C{1H} NMR, variable temperature 1H NMR, MS and EA have been used to study the structure and solution dynamics of 1&#8211;14. This has directly been linked to the decomposition profiles of the compounds to assess their viability as precursors, evidencing that what we see in the solution state is present in the solid state too. Density functional theory calculations have been carried out to elucidate the various bonding modes observed for compounds 1&#8211;7. Tandem MS has been employed to better understand the breakdown of the molecules.

         <title>Light&#8208;Induced Conjugation of Inorganic Phosphate and Sulfate with Aminocyclobutenediones under Aqueous Conditions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 23, April 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Irradiation of aminocyclobutenediones with blue light in aqueous phosphate or sulfate solution produces butenolides with phosphate or sulfate groups. The reaction is compatible with free amino and carboxy groups, and can be performed under air.







Abstract
Phosphate and sulfate groups play an important role in controlling the physical properties of biomolecules and artificial materials. However, despite their significance, the incorporation of phosphate or sulfate groups into aqueous organic compounds using non&#8208;enzymatic methods has been unprecedented. In this study, we have successfully conjugated inorganic phosphate and sulfate with aminocyclobutenedione derivatives via photochemical reactions under aqueous conditions. A plausible mechanism for the conjugation reactions was proposed on the basis of DFT calculations. These reactions will promote life science research based on organophosphates and organosulfates which have been difficult to access up to now.

         <title>Synthesis of Ag@Pd Nanocubes and Pd&#8208;based Nanoframes via One&#8208;Shot Injection of a Halide&#8208;Free Precursor for Continuous Production in a Flow Reactor</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 23, April 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report the synthesis of Pd&#8208;based nanoframes by templating with Ag nanocubes via one&#8208;shot injection of Pd(NH3)4(NO3)2 solution and H2O2 etching. We also extend the one&#8208;shot synthesis from a batch to a continuous flow reactor for continuous production without compromising the quality.







Abstract
Noble&#8208;metal open nanostructures have remarkable catalytic capabilities toward a wide range of reactions. In particular, Pd&#8208;based open nanostructures have been synthesized and validated for superior catalytic performance toward formic acid oxidation. However, most of the syntheses are based on dropwise addition, making it challenging to increase the production volume. In this work, we present a facile approach to the synthesis of Ag@Pd core&#8208;frame nanocubes and then Pd&#8208;based nanoframes through one&#8208;shot injection. In a typical synthesis, Ag nanocubes are dispersed in an aqueous solution of ascorbic acid and polyvinylpyrrolidone at room temperature, followed by the injection of Pd(NH3)4(NO3)2 precursor in one shot. The Pd(NH3)4(NO3)2 precursor has a much slower reduction kinetics relative to Na2PdCl4, preventing self&#8208;nucleation and enabling controlled deposition of Pd atoms on the Ag nanocubes. The lower reduction potential of Pd(NH3)4(NO3)2 also helps minimize the galvanic replacement reaction, facilitating uniform deposition of Pd atoms. After selectively etching away the Ag template, Pd&#8208;based nanoframes with a rigid cubic structure are obtained. Finally, the synthesis is successfully adapted to a continuous flow system, generating Ag@Pd nanocubes with comparable quality to those obtained via one&#8208;shot synthesis, demonstrating a practical route to large&#8208;scale production of Pd&#8208;based nanoframes with H2O2 etching.

         <title>Working Mechanisms for Enhanced Interface Stability and Electrochemical Properties in Dual&#8208;Salt Polymer Electrolyte with In&#8208;Situ Electrolyte&#8208;Cathode Integration</title>

         <dc:description>
Dual&#8208;salt CSEs with electrolyte&#8208;cathode integrated structure is obtained via in&#8208;situ UV photopolymerization. The working mechanisms of a stable, robust and low&#8208;resistance SEI layer can be revealed by theoretical calculations and electrochemical characterization. The dual&#8208;salt CSEs show an enhanced performance for all solid&#8208;state lithium batteries.







Abstract
Solid polymer electrolytes (SPEs) have attracted much attention due to their excellent flexibility, strong interfacial adhesion and good processibility. However, the incompatibility at the electrode/electrolyte interface often results in increased impedance and rapid capacity attenuation. In this work, dual&#8208;salt composite solid electrolytes (CSEs) with an integrated electrolyte/cathode structure are prepared by in&#8208;situ ultraviolet (UV) photopolymerization. With the addition of the lithium difluoro(oxalato)borate (LiDFOB), a robust, stable and low&#8208;resistance solid&#8208;electrolyte interface (SEI) layer is established during electrochemical reduction, eventually improving the overall performance of all solid&#8208;state lithium batteries (ASSLBs). The Li||Li symmetric cells with RTS&#8208;TH&#8208;2&#8201;% LiDFOB ASSLB exhibit stable cycling for over 2000&#8197;h at at 0.1&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2@0.1&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2. LiFePO4||Li cells deliver a high discharge capacity (155&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.5&#8197;C) and cycling stability (with the retention rate of more than 90&#8201;% at 0.5&#8197;C after 100 cycles) at 60&#8201;&#176;C. This work provides a facile strategy to enhance electrodes compatibility with poly (ethylene glycol) acrylates (PEGAs)&#8208;based electrolytes.

With the addition of the lithium difluoro(oxalato)borate (LiDFOB), a robust, stable and low-resistance solid-electrolyte interface (SEI) layer is established during electrochemical reduction, eventually improving the overall performance of all solid-state lithium batteries (ASSLBs). The Li||Li symmetric cells with RTS-TH-2&#8201;% LiDFOB ASSLB exhibit stable cycling for over 2000&#8197;h at at 0.1&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;@0.1&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;. LiFePO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;||Li cells deliver a high discharge capacity (155&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 0.5&#8197;C) and cycling stability (with the retention rate of more than 90&#8201;% at 0.5&#8197;C after 100 cycles) at 60&#8201;&#176;C. This work provides a facile strategy to enhance electrodes compatibility with poly (ethylene glycol) acrylates (PEGAs)-based electrolytes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Highly Efficient Separation of Toluene and n&#8208;Heptane by Amorphous Cucurbit[7]uril Solids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 23, April 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, an environmentally friendly and low&#8208;energy adsorption separation method is proposed, which uses cucurbit[7]uril to efficiently separate toluene from toluene/n&#8208;heptane mixture with a purity of 99.65&#8201;% and can be reused, providing an innovative solution for the efficient utilization of petroleum resources.







Abstract
Separating toluene from n&#8208;heptane is a challenging task in the petroleum industry. Traditional methods face problems including elevated energy usage, intricate technical procedures, and residual extractants. Herein, we developed an environmentally friendly, low energy consuming and economically efficient adsorption separation method. This study employed cucurbit[7]uril (Q[7]) as an adsorbent to efficiently separate toluene from a mixture of toluene and n&#8208;heptane. The purity of toluene was obtained to be 99.38&#8201;% from the mixed vapors and 99.65&#8201;% from the mixed liquids. The kinetic experiment results demonstrate that the adsorption behavior of toluene was chemisorption. Density functional theory calculations show that the structure of toluene@Q[7] is more stable. In addition, vacuum heating can remove toluene from the Q[7] cavity, resulting in a guest&#8208;free Q[7], which can be repeated for the adsorption separation process without loss of performance. This study has the potential value of addressing the pressing need for efficient resource utilization in light of diminishing petroleum supplies.

         <title>The Cooperation of Pd center and Lewis Acid Sites to Achieve High Selectivity Towards Kinetic Carbonate Product for Oxidative Carbonylation Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 23, April 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two model catalysts, those are, Pd1@NaY with conjuct Pd center and Lewis acid sites, and Pd1@NaY&#8722;T with isolated Pd centers are synthesized and compared their catalytic performance for oxidative carbonylation reaction. Combined in&#8208;situ DRIFTS, and DFT calculation study reveals the cooperation mechanism of Pd and Lewis acid sites towards the carbonate products.







Abstract
Dimethyl carbonate and dimethyl oxalate are competitive products of the carbonylation reaction of methyl nitrite (MN) under Pd&#8208;based catalysts. The chemo&#8208;selectivity is influenced not just by the thermodynamic constraints of reaction conditions but also by the electronic structures of catalysts. Lewis acid sites are extensively employed to modulate the electronic structures of Pd active sites for kinetic carbonate production, but their precise role remains unclear. Herein, we employed a combination of reaction kinetic, in&#8197;situ DRIFTS experiments and DFT calculation, unveiling the indispensable role of Lewis acid sites in activating MN and facilitating the transfer of *OCH3 species, which is the key to obtain the kinetic carbonate outcome. The molecular understanding reveals the cooperation of Pd center and Lewis acid sites in directing selectivity towards carbonate product, which enables the rational design of higher&#8208;performance catalysts.

         <title>Programming Covalent Organic Frameworks for Photocatalysis: Investigation of Synthesis Methods</title>

Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) demonstrate significant potential as photocatalysts for hydrogen and hydrogen peroxide production. This work systematically evaluates four synthesis strategies &#8211; solvothermal, microwave, ultrasonic, and mechanochemical &#8211; to optimize TAPT&#8208;COF preparation, showing how different synthesis methods influence COF properties, and providing valuable guidance for molecular strategy development and industrial applications in photocatalysis.







Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are crystalline, porous materials with exceptional potential as high&#8208;performance photocatalysts for applications such as hydrogen and hydrogen peroxide production. In this study, we systematically evaluates various synthesis methods to optimize the preparation of COFs, specifically targeting enhanced photocatalytic activity. Four different synthetic strategies including solvothermal synthesis, microwave synthesis, ultrasonic synthesis, and mechanochemical synthesis were explored to prepare TAPT&#8208;COF with identical molecular structures. Although all methods produced COFs with comparable crystallinity, porosity, and light absorption capacity, their photocatalytic efficiencies in hydrogen and hydrogen peroxide production varied significantly. Notably, the mechanochemical method, which involves ball milling to disrupt interlayer interactions and produce COF nanosheets, exhibited the highest photocatalytic performance, particularly in the COF&#8208;BM&#8208;30&#8197;min sample. This difference highlights the importance of morphology in photocatalytic activity. Our findings shed light on the impact of synthesis methods on COF properties and provide valuable guidance for molecular strategy development and industrial applications in photocatalysis.

         <title>Systematic Analysis of False&#8208;Positive CH4 Production in Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction: The Role of Solvent and Reagent Decomposition</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 23, April 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In photocatalytic CO2 reduction, decomposition of solvents and sacrificial agents leads to CH4 production rather than CO2 reduction. Isotopic labeling experiments revealed that acetone, DMSO, and TEA decompose to produce CH4 at rates as high as 2770&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;L&#8722;1.







Abstract
Photocatalytic carbon dioxide (CO2) reduction has emerged as a promising strategy for achieving carbon neutrality under mild reaction conditions. While methane (CH4) is widely regarded as a valuable target product in CO2 reduction studies, the reliability of such measurements can be compromised by unintended CH4 generation from solvent or sacrificial reagent decomposition during photoreactions. Herein, we systematically evaluate the stability of seven common solvents and five sacrificial reagents under visible&#8208;light irradiation (&#955; &gt;420&#8197;nm) in CO2&#8208;, air&#8208;, and N2&#8208;saturated atmosphere, employing three distinct photosensitizers. Notably, acetone, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), and triethylamine (TEA) were identified as high&#8208;risk reagents prone to photodecomposition, generating substantial CH4 yields of up to 2770&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;L&#8722;1. Isotopic labeling experiments conclusively demonstrated that the source of CH4 originated from the solvents or sacrificial reagents rather than CO2. These findings highlight critical pitfalls in experimental design for photocatalytic CO2 reduction and emphasize the necessity of rigorous reagent screening to avoid artifactual methane production.

Self&#8208;supported three&#8208;dimensional flower&#8208;like Fe&#8322;(MoO&#8324;)&#8323; anode materials with vanadium doping&#8208;induced oxygen vacancies were prepared by a microwave&#8208;assisted hydrothermal method, and synergistically interacted with SnO&#8322;&#8208;modified SnO&#8322;/CNTs anode materials to successfully construct high&#8208;performance hybrid supercapacitors.

Abstract
In this work, we present for the first time an innovative strategy to construct high&#8208;performance hybrid supercapacitors through the synergistic optimization of vanadium&#8208;doped self&#8208;supported three&#8208;dimensional Flower&#8208;like Fe&#8322;(MoO&#8324;)&#8323; anodes and SnO&#8322;/CNTs composite anodes. The V&#8208;doped Fe&#8322;(MoO&#8324;)&#8323; anode synthesized by a microwave&#8208;assisted hydrothermal method combines vanadium doping&#8208;induced oxygen vacancies, lattice distortion effects and self&#8208;supporting properties of the three&#8208;dimensional floral structure, which enhances the specific surface area of the material to 190.58&#8197;m2/g, and obtains a high specific capacitance of 2,157&#8197;F/g at a current density of 1&#8197;A/g, and undergoes a 15&#8197;A/g After 10,000 cycles at 15&#8197;A/g, the capacitance retention rate is still 98.2&#8201;%. To address the limitations of traditional anode materials, SnO&#8322;/CNTs composites significantly reduce the charge transfer resistance (5.61&#8197;&#937;) and enhance the multiplicity performance by combining the high theoretical capacity of SnO&#8322; with the three&#8208;dimensional conductive network of CNTs. Based on this, the V&#8722;Fe&#8322;(MoO&#8324;)&#8323;//SnO&#8322;/CNTs hybrid supercapacitor achieves a high energy density of 151&#8197;Wh/kg at 3&#8197;A/g, which is a 30&#8211;60&#8201;% enhancement over the conventional molybdate capacitor, and maintains 96.2&#8201;% capacitance stability after 10,000 cycles. This provides a new idea for the development of energy storage devices with high energy density and long cycle life.

         <title>Structure&#8208;Based Development of a Covalent Inhibitor Targeting Streptococcus Pyogenes over Staphylococcus Aureus Sortase A</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 23, April 22, 2025. </description>

The rational design of a selective SpSrtA inhibitor was guided by structural insights from the ML346/SpSrtA structure and the docked ML346/SaSrtA model. Our analysis revealed that head and tail clashes in the binding pocket indicated that reducing the &#8220;C=C&#8221; bond in ML346 could enhance selectivity for SpSrtA over SaSrtA. Through our SAR study, we identified T10 as a promising narrow&#8208;spectrum antivirulence agent for combating S.&#8197;pyogenes infection.







Abstract
Sortase A (SrtA), a cysteine transpeptidase critical for surface protein anchoring in Gram&#8208;positive pathogens, represents an attractive antivirulence target. While covalent SrtA inhibitors show therapeutic potential, existing compounds lack species selectivity. Through structure&#8208;guided design, we developed T10, a covalent inhibitor selectively targeting Streptococcus pyogenes SrtA (SpSrtA) over Staphylococcus aureus SrtA (SaSrtA). Molecular docking revealed that shortening a &#8220;C=C&#8221; bond in lead compound ML346 eliminated SaSrtA inhibition due to steric hindrance from W194, while maintaining SpSrtA binding. X&#8208;ray crystallography confirmed T10&#8242;s covalent modification of Cys208 in SpSrtA. T10 demonstrated two fold enhanced inhibitory potency and species&#8208;specific disruption of M&#8208;protein anchoring and biofilm formation in Streptococcus pyogenes, without affecting Staphylococcus aureus viability. In a Galleria mellonella infection model, T10 conferred potent protection against lethal infection. This work demonstrates the development of narrow&#8208;spectrum antivirulence agents through a structure&#8208;based rational strategy.

         <title>Isolation and Characterization of [MnFe(CO)10]+: The Missing Link in the 3&#8201;d Dimetal Decacarbonyl Series</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 23, April 22, 2025. </description>

Covalent or Lewis&#8208;Pair? The combination of the metalloradical [Fe(CO)5]+&#8901; and Mn2(CO)10 yields the first heterodinuclear transition metal cation [MnFe(CO)10]+. With equally distributed charges, it makes the complex cation a borderline case between the covalent 2x17&#8197;VE and the Lewis&#8208;pair 16+18 VE electron counts. Hence, a case for grayscale opposing black and white settings.







Abstract
The heterodinuclear dimetal decacarbonyl cation [MnFe(CO)10]+ has been synthesized by combining the metalloradical [Fe(CO)5]+&#8901; with half an equivalent of Mn2(CO)10. The complex was subsequently isolated and characterized using single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;Ray Diffraction (scXRD), as well as IR, Raman, NMR and M&#246;ssbauer spectroscopy. Experimental results, complemented by DFT calculations of the relaxed force constants and an analysis of the electron density, reveal that the interaction between the two {M(CO)5} fragments in [MnFe(CO)10]+ is in between a covalent and a dative bond, representing a borderline case between the 2x17&#8197;VE and the 16+18&#8197;VE electron counting. Additionally, the known isoelectronic anion [CrMn(CO)10]&#8722; was prepared as its [PPN]+ salt and characterized for the first time by scXRD. These finding complete the series of structurally characterized isoelectronic dimetal decacarbonyls, spanning from [Cr2(CO)10]2&#8722; to [Fe2(CO)10]2+, the characteristics of all of which are compared based on experiment and theory.

         <title>Mimicking the CuD Site of pMMO via a Copper Cage&#8208;Complex</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 23, April 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A copper cage complex is presented that mimics the CuD site of particulate methane monooxygenase (pMMO). The CuD site has recently been proposed to be the activite site of pMMO. The cage complex presented here can catalyze aerobic oxidations of organic substrates such as benzylic alcohols to aldehydes and hydroquinones to quinones.







Abstract
The mechanism of action of particulate monooxygenase (pMMO) has yet to be determined. The CuD site with two histidines and an asparagine coordinating to copper has been identified as a potential active site of pMMO. Here, we present a copper cage complex, that assembles this coordination sphere, being a structural mimic of the pMMO. The cage is capable to catalyze aerobic oxidations of organic substrates such as benzylic alcohols to aldehydes and hydroquinones to quinones. This is inspired by the reactivity that is observed for enzymatic active sites possessing copper.

         <title>Sulfur&#8208;Containing Salen&#8208;Type Chromium Complexes for Selective Carbonylation of Epoxides: A Pathway to Polyesters and Cyclic Lactones</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 23, April 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study investigates epoxide carbonylation using salen&#8208;type complexes with Co2(CO)8 to optimize the production of polyesters and cyclic lactones. [ONSO]&#8208;type Cr(III) favoured polyesters, while [ONNO]&#8208;type Cr(III) and Al(III) favoured cyclic lactones. Ethylene oxide carbonylation highlighted the role of catalyst structure, with the [ONNO] type achieving &gt;99% propiolactone selectivity. The results emphasize the influence of ligand design on selectivity, thus facilitating the development of catalytic systems.







Abstract
Carbonylation, a pivotal process in efficient C1 conversion, facilitates the direct incorporation of carbon monoxide into high&#8208;value&#8208;added chemicals. This study investigates the carbonylation of epoxides using salen&#8208;type complexes with varying metal centers and tetradentate dianionic ligands, in conjunction with Co2(CO)8, to optimize selectivity and yield in the production of polyesters and cyclic lactones. The [ONSO]&#8208;type Cr(III) complexes exhibited a pronounced preference for polyester formation, achieving a selectivity of 73&#8201;%. This preference is attributed to the electron&#8208;donating sulfur donors, which stabilize the growing polymer chain. In contrast, [ONNO]&#8208;type complexes with Cr(III) and Al(III) predominantly yielded cyclic lactones (99&#8201;% &#946;&#8208;butyrolactone selectivity), owing to their enhanced electrophilicity that favors the backbiting process. Detailed analyses of ethylene oxide carbonylation underscored the crucial role of catalyst structure in determining reaction pathways and product distribution. Notably, [ONNO]&#8208;type complexes with Cr(III) and Al(III) exhibited over 99&#8201;% propiolactone selectivity during the carbonylation of ethylene oxide, highlighting the significance of catalyst design in optimizing chemical reactions. These results provide valuable insights into the role of ligand design in controlling the selectivity and efficiency of epoxide carbonylation, paving the way for the development of more effective catalytic systems.

         <title>Atmospheric Ignition Chemistry of Green Hypergolic Bipropellant 1&#8208;Ethyl&#8208;3&#8208;Methylimidazolium Cyanoborohydride &#8211; Hydrogen Peroxide in an Acoustic Levitator: Exploring a Potent Universal Propellant</title>

Can hypergolic ionic liquid &#8211; oxidizer combination be universal green propellant? Comprehensive experimental study exploiting droplet merging technique inside an acoustic levitator process chamber reveals such feasibility via comparing the hypergolic and atmospheric ignition reactions through the identification of products and reactive intermediates in&#8197;situ.







Abstract
Hypergolic ionic liquids (HILs) represent a critical pool of reactive ionic liquids which ignite spontaneously in absence of oxygen when mixed with an oxidizer such as white fuming nitric acid (WFNA, HNO3) or hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). These HILs have emerged as greener alternatives to the toxic hydrazine family of fuels for operations in space under anaerobic conditions. Here, we report on the unusual atmospheric ignition chemistry of the 1&#8208;ethyl&#8208;3&#8208;methylimidazolium cyanoborohydride ([EMIM][CBH])&#8208;H2O2 bipropellant while comparing with the parent hypergolic reaction by exploiting a chirped&#8208;pulse triggered droplet merging technique in an ultrasonic levitation apparatus under controlled environment. Significant enhancements of the ignition performance and noticeable differences of product distribution in the simulated atmosphere containing molecular oxygen are revealed. The critical mechanistic role of the surrounding oxygen plausibly involves the reaction with a suitable intermediate (iminomethyl)boronic acid, [(HO)2BCH=NH] formed in the initial reactions of the IL and H2O2 which eventually generates catalytic hydroperoxyl (&#8901;HO2) and hydroxyl (&#8901;OH) radicals &#8208; further promoting the ignition reaction. This systematic case study conceptually demonstrates that under atmospheric conditions, well&#8208;defined HIL &#8208; oxidizer combinations provide excellent ignition performance and effectively be used as universal fuel both in space and in the terrestrial atmosphere simplifying the multistage propulsion system.

         <title>Enhanced Glycerol Oxidation Toward Dihydroxyacetone Over Gold/Palladium Binary Nanocatalysts by Structure Control</title>

         <dc:description>
Supported AuPd alloy, Au@Pd core&#8208;shell, Au&#8722;Pd Janus particle and Au+Pd mixture catalysts with different configurations were prepared to selectively oxidize GLY toward DHA, in which AuPd/CNT catalyst with the strongest interaction between the Au and Pd atoms afforded the superior catalytic performance.







Abstract
Gold/palladium binary catalysts have been widely used to the selective oxidation of glycerol to produce value&#8208;added chemicals. However, the essential effect of the structure of Au/Pd binary catalysts on the catalytic performance has not been elucidated yet. In this work, Au, Pd, AuPd alloy, Au@Pd core&#8208;shell, and Au&#8722;Pd Janus nanoparticle catalysts prepared by sol&#8208;immobilization and photochemical deposition methods were employed to the selective oxidation of glycerol toward dihydroxyacetone (DHA). The results showed that the activation of glycerol and oxygen molecule was significantly promoted with the appropriate interaction between Au and Pd atoms. That was, the turnover frequency of glycerol and DHA generation rate over the alloyed AuPd nanoparticles were remarkably higher than those of Au@Pd core&#8208;shell and Au&#8722;Pd Janus nanoparticle catalysts. It was due to the synergistic effect of Pd and Au atoms remarkably promoted the electron transfer from Pd to Au, resulting in increasing the activity of the exposed Au sites, and moderately inhibiting the activity of the exposed Pd sites, which benefited to generate DHA rapidly. After optimizing, up to 61&#8201;% yield of DHA was achieved at 87&#8201;% glycerol conversion over the alloyed AuPd catalyst.

         <title>Luminescent Trityl&#8208;based Diradicaloids: A Theoretical and Experimental Assessment of Charge&#8208;Resonance in Low&#8208;Lying Excited States</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 23, April 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The lowest&#8208;lying excited states of the TTM&#8208;derived diradicals cannot be related to those of TTM: new low&#8208;lying excited states emerge, corresponding to charge resonance between the two radical units, the lowest one being a dark state for symmetric diradicals. Different approaches than those used for TTM radicals are needed to achieve high PLQY in TTM&#8208;derived diradicals.







Abstract
The tris(2,4,6&#8208;trichlorophenyl)methyl radical (TTM) has inspired the synthesis of several luminescent diradicaloids, providing an extraordinary opportunity to control the nature of the low&#8208;lying excited states by fine&#8208;tuning the diradical character. However, the photophysical properties of TTM&#8208;derived diradicals remain not fully understood yet. Here we present a combined theoretical and experimental investigation to elucidate the origin of their luminescence. The theoretical analysis explores a series of symmetric TTM&#8208;derived diradicals with singlet ground state and increasingly longer &#960;&#8208;conjugated spacers between radical moieties, focussing on the nature of the lowest excited electronic states governing their photophysics. The study is complemented by a complete spectroscopic characterization of the TTM&#8208;TTM diradical, synthesized using a novel, simpler and more efficient procedure exploiting the unique reactivity of TTM. The diradicals feature two novel low&#8208;lying excited states, absent in TTM, arising from charge resonance (CR) between the radical units. The lowest CR state is characterized by the H,H&#8594;L,L double excitation (DE) and is a dark state for symmetric diradicals. The CR nature explains the blue&#8208;shifted emission observed by increasing the distance between the radical centres as seen in TTM&#8208;ph&#8208;TTM. This insight suggests different design strategies to improve the luminescence properties of TTM&#8208;derived diradicals.

         <title>Enzyme&#8208;Catalysed Formation of Hydrocarbon Scaffolds from Geranylgeranyl Diphosphate Analogs with Shifted Double Bonds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 23, April 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Four new geranylgeranyl diphosphate analogs with shifted double bonds were synthesized and together with the known analog iso&#8208;GGPP I converted with 14 diterpene synthases. While two substrate analogs were not accepted by the enzymes, the other three analogs yielded compounds with skeletons that are not observed in nature. Mechanistic key steps were investigated through isotopic labelling experiments and computational chemistry.







Abstract
Four analogs of geranylgeranyl diphosphate (GGPP) with shifted double bonds were synthesised and enzymatically converted with 14 diterpene synthases of previously reported function, including two newly characterised homologs of the benditerpe&#8208;2,6,15&#8208;triene synthase Bnd4 and the venezuelaene synthase VenA. In successful cases the products were isolated and structurally characterised by NMR spectroscopy, revealing the formation of various diterpenoids with skeletons that have not been reported from natural sources. Isotopic labelling experiments in conjunction with DFT calculations were performed to give insights into hydride migrations in the biosynthesis of the non&#8208;natural diterpenes benditerpe&#8208;2,7(19),15&#8208;triene and venezuelaxenene and their natural counterparts from GGPP.

The molecular structures of the complexes [CrMn(CO)10]&#8722; and [MnFe(CO)10]+ complete the series of dimetal decacarbonyls reaching from [Cr2(CO)10]2&#8722; to [Fe2(CO)10]2+. In our interpretation of the Wanderer above the Sea of Fog, a chemist is hiking through the dimetal&#8208;decacarbonyl landscape, discovering the hidden heterodinuclear complexes in the fog. The fog also highlights the misty borderline situation between covalent and Lewis&#8208;pair bonding, onto which light is ornately shed. In the background, the vibrational mountain range of the title compound shows its peaks. More information can be found in the Research Article by I. Krossing and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202500489).

         <title>Radionuclide&#8208;Activated Luminescence for Cancer Theranostics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 23, April 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Radionuclide&#8208;activated luminescence (RL) is a versatile platform that enables simultaneous optical imaging and tumor phototherapy, offering significant potential to bridge the gap between radiotheranostics and phototheranostics. This review presents diverse RL probes categorized by their activation mechanisms, emphasizes their applications in cancer theranostics, and provides a comprehensive insight into RL technology to accelerate its clinical translation.







Abstract
Within dielectric media, charged particles emitted from medical radionuclides induce polarization of surrounding molecules, which subsequently generate Cerenkov luminescence (CL) upon returning to their ground state. This CL emission confers clinically approved radiotracers with distinctive potential for applications in phototheranostics. However, the utility of CL in&#8197;vivo has been severely constrained by its ultraviolet&#8208;weighted emission spectrum and extremely low photon flux, particularly in living imaging and triggering photodynamic therapy. Certain optical probes, encompassing fluorescent agents and nanoparticle scintillators, can be activated by radionuclides to generate red&#8208;shifted emissions with amplified luminescence intensity compared to CL. This phenomenon, termed radionuclide&#8208;activated luminescence (RL), represents a promising strategy for enhancing radionuclide&#8208;induced tumor phototheranostic outcomes. This review systematically summarizes the advances in RL technology, highlighting the development of various RL probes and their innovative applications in laser&#8208;free optical bioimaging and cancer phototherapy. It further delves into the confronting challenges and prospects of RL technology, aiming to provide a comprehensive overview and practical insights to advance the integration of radiotheranostics and phototheranostics in clinical practice.

         <title>Exploring n&#8208;&#960;* Electronic Transitions in Graphitic Carbon Nitride: Fundamentals, Strategies, and Photocatalytic Advances</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 23, April 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review highlights recent advancements in modulating n&#8208;&#960;* electronic transitions in g&#8208;C3N4 to extend its absorption edge and enhance photocatalytic activity. It covers mechanisms, strategies, and photocatalytic applications in hydrogen generation, CO2 other energy&#8208;related processes, and future research directions.







Abstract
Photocatalysis utilizes solar energy to drive redox reactions, offering a promising solution to global energy and environmental challenges. Up to now, graphitic carbon nitride (g&#8208;C3N4) has been widely studied due to its unique organic structural framework and favourable electronic properties. However, its photocatalytic efficiency is often constrained by a limited light absorption range (up to ~460&#8197;nm) and modest charge&#8208;carrier mobility. Recent findings suggest that n&#8208;&#960;* electronic transitions can extend the absorption edge of g&#8208;C3N4 to approximately 600&#8197;nm, enhancing the activity. Herein, we first outline the fundamental structural and electronic features of g&#8208;C3N4, highlighting the role of both n&#8208;&#960;* electronic transitions. We then provide a comprehensive overview of various strategies for activating n&#8208;&#960;* transitions, emphasizing the necessity of distorting the planar and symmetric tri&#8208;s&#8208;triazine units to enable this transition. The subsequent sections demonstrate how modulating n&#8208;&#960;* transitions can broaden the light absorption spectrum and facilitate more efficient charge separation, thereby enhancing photocatalytic processes. Finally, we propose potential future directions for exploiting n&#8208;&#960;* transitions to further advance g&#8208;C3N4&#8208;based photocatalysts. This review aims to fill a gap in the literature by providing a focused summary of n&#8208;&#960;* transitions in g&#8208;C3N4 and their significance for sustainable energy and environmental applications.

         <title>Molecular Release by the Rotaxane and Pseudorotaxane Approach</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 23, April 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review highlights the employment of rotaxane and pseudorotaxane architecture in the controlled release of target molecules both in solution and in the solid state. The properties conferred by the mechanical bond allow precise control over the release mechanism, thus leading to new forms of molecular cargo delivery when rotaxane&#8208;based systems are employed.







Abstract
The controlled release of target molecules is a relevant application in several areas, such as medicine, fragrance chemistry and catalysis. Systems which pursue this implementation require a fine&#8208;tune of the start and rate of the release, among other properties. In this scenario, rotaxane&#8208; and pseudorotaxane&#8208;based systems are postulated as ideal scaffolds to accomplish a precise cargo release, due to the special features provided by the intertwined arrangement. This short review covers advances towards the controlled release of different molecules using rotaxane&#8208; and pseudorotaxane&#8208;based systems, both in solution and in the solid state.

         <title>Endowing Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons with Induced Supramolecular Chirality by Engineering Cation&#8208;&#960; Interaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chiral supramolecular cation&#8208;&#960; co&#8208;assembly were fabricated, primarily driven by cation&#8208;&#960; interaction between electron&#8208;poor chiral cationic polymer R/S&#8208;Pd and electron&#8208;rich polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PHAs). This cation&#8208;&#960; co&#8208;assembly can derive into 12 different PAHs and observed induced supramolecular chiral transfer in the PAHs observed both in DMSO solution and THF/H2O (v/v, 6/4) supramolecular gel matrices.







Abstract
The cation&#8208;&#960; interaction is a crucial noncovalent binding force prevalent in many biological and chemical systems, however, are rarely reported in chiral supramolecular systems. Here, a supramolecular chiral system is reported, wherein cation&#8208;&#960; interaction play significant roles. The interaction involves a chiral cationic palladium complex (R&#8208;Pd) co&#8208;assembling with 12 different polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), resulting in the formation of supramolecular gels in mixed solvents. This co&#8208;assembly induces supramolecular chirality in the PAHs, with cation&#8722;&#960; interaction identified as the primary driving force. The confirmation of this interaction is supported by high&#8208;resolution mass, 1H NMR, nuclear overhauser effect spectroscopy (NOESY), XRD and CD. Most importantly, with the synergy of hydrogen bonds, the cation&#8208;&#960; interaction can be stabilized in a mixed solvent containing water, leading the co&#8208;assembly to form supramolecular gel, as well as enhanced chiral induction of PAHs. This discovery serves as a proof&#8208;of&#8208;principle example showing how the weak cation&#8208;&#960; interaction could be a powerful guide in attaining induced chirality of PAHs.

         <title>Chiral Zero&#8208;Dimensional Hybrid Antimony Chloride with Circularly Polarized Luminescence and Solvent&#8208;Induced Property Regulation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two pairs of enantiomeric Sb3+&#8208;based 0D chiral hybrid metal halides, (R/S&#8208;3AP)4SbCl11&#8901;DMF and (R/S&#8208;3AP)4SbCl11&#8901;ACN, demonstrate efficient circularly polarized luminescence (CPL), a maximum |glum| of 2.27&#215;10&#8722;3. Solvent molecules play a crucial role in modulating their structural and chiroptical properties. Their CPL&#8208;emitting devices and anti&#8208;counterfeiting applications highlight the potential of these materials for advanced chiral optoelectronic technologies.







Abstract
In this study, we synthesized two pairs of enantiomeric Sb3+&#8208;based 0D chiral hybrid metal halides (HMHs), (R/S&#8208;3AP)4SbCl11&#8901;DMF and (R/S&#8208;3AP)4SbCl11&#8901;ACN, which exhibit efficient circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) emissions with distinct optical properties influenced by the solvent environment. (R/S&#8208;3AP)4SbCl11&#8901;DMF displays bright orange luminescence with a photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of 57.1&#8201;%, while (R/S&#8208;3AP)4SbCl11&#8901;ACN emits red luminescence with a PLQY of 17.4&#8201;%. Notably, (R/S&#8208;3AP)4SbCl11&#8901;ACN achieves a maximum dissymmetry factor (|glum|) of 2.27&#215;10&#8722;3, attributed to strong hydrogen bonding between organic and inorganic components. Reversible transformations between these two phases via solvent vapor stimulation enable dynamic photoluminescence (PL) switching, highlighting their application in anti&#8208;counterfeiting technology. Furthermore, circularly polarized light&#8208;emitting devices (CPL&#8208;emitting devices) based on these materials were fabricated, achieving a maximum |glum| of 2.01&#215;10&#8722;3. These findings underscore the potential of these chiral HMHs for advanced applications in chiral optoelectronics, anti&#8208;counterfeiting, and CPL&#8208;emitting devices.

Metal&#8208;ligand electronic synergy driven stabilization of MLCT excited state in unsymmetric azoheteroaromatic radical bridged diruthenium (III) complex 2 (S=1/2) incorporating electron rich acac (acetylacetonate) co&#8208;ligand has been demonstrated via synthetic architecture and structural/spectroscopic authentication.







Abstract
The article demonstrated the stabilization of MLCT excited state in structurally characterized unsymmetric N,N/N,O&#8722; donating azoheteroaromatic radical bridged (acac)2RuIII(&#956;&#8208;L3&#8226;&#8722;)RuIII(acac)2 (2, S=1/2) [L3= deprotonated 5&#8208;(diethylamino)&#8208;2&#8208;(6&#8208;methybenzo[d] thiazol&#8208;2&#8208;yl)diazenylphenol, acac= electron rich acetylacetonate, N&#8722;N(azo) distance: 1.379(4) &#197;] via intramolecular electron transfer (IET) at the metal&#8208;azo interface. On the contrary, similar IET driven stabilization of MLCT excited state was failed to take place in N,N donating HL3 derived mononuclear counterpart (acac)2RuII(HL3) (1, S=0) with unperturbed azo function (N=N distance: 1.3361(18) &#197;) in spite of the fact of facile RuII/RuIII oxidation (0.28&#8197;V versus SCE) and azo reduction (&#8722;1.05&#8197;V versus SCE), presumably due to the influence of hydrogen bonding interaction at the back face of coordinated HL3. On the other hand, the use of electron poor bpy (2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine) as a co&#8208;ligand facilitated exclusive generation of the mononuclear [(bpy)2RuIIL3]ClO4 ([3]ClO4, S=0) encompassing N,O&#8722;&#8208;donating L3 with neutral azo group (N=N distance: 1.317(6) &#197;), unlike N,N donating HL3 in 1 due to the impact of &#963;&#8208;donating acac versus &#960;&#8208;accepting bpy, which also devoided of IET step. DFT calculations further suggested the origin of multiple redox steps and absorption profiles of 1, 2, 3+.

         <title>Noncovalent Interactions of Surface Adsorbed Species Control the Self&#8208;Assembly of Calcinated Nickel Oxide Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Different tendencies towards self&#8208;assembling in polar&#8208; and non&#8208;polar&#8208;faceted NiO nanoparticles (NPs) are explained using diffraction, imaging and 2D correlation spectroscopic techniques. NiO NPs with dominating (100) surface planes show pronounced self&#8208;assembling tendency due to favorable non&#8208;covalent interactions between non&#8208;dissociatively adsorbed water molecules, while those with dominating polar (111) surface planes behave oppositely, due to unfavorable interactions between surface hydroxyl groups.







Abstract
Utilizing state of the art diffraction, imaging and spectroscopic techniques in conjunction with two&#8208;dimensional correlation analysis, we provide novel in&#8208;depth insights into the physics and chemistry behind the different tendencies towards self&#8208;assembling in NiO nanoparticles as function of their surface facets. We demonstrate substantially different temperature dependence of the spectroscopic behavior of the two types of NiO NPs, polar versus non&#8208;polar faceted. Temperature&#8208;dependent spectroscopy data for NiO NPs obtained by the ammonia route are consistent with the process in which high amount of water molecules that take part in hydrogen&#8208;bonding interaction with the surface&#8208;adsorbed non&#8208;dissociated water molecules on the neutral (100) planes are lost during the thermal treatment and attached back upon cooling. Interactions between water molecules adsorbed on two vicinal NiO NPs are responsible for keeping the self&#8208;assembly of the Ni(OH)2 NPs upon heat treatment. In carbamide&#8208;based NiO NPs, the self&#8208;assembly of initially formed Ni3(OH)4(NO3)2 NPs is not preserved. These NPs are terminated with polar (111) atomic planes, on which water molecules dissociatively adsorb, giving surface hydroxyl groups. As the hydrogen bonding proton &#8211; donating and accepting abilities are negligible at OH&#8208;polar terminated NiO NPs, only unfavorable inter&#8208;NP interactions are possible which leads to disruption of the NP assembly.

         <title>Diboron Reagents in N&#8722;N Bond Cleavage of Hydrazines, N&#8208;Nitrosamines, and Azides: Reactivity and Mechanistic Insights</title>

Bis(neopentyl glycolato)diboron) (B2nep2) efficiently cleaves N&#8722;N bonds in hydrazines, N&#8208;nitrosamines and azides through alkoxide activation. This transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free and operationally simple protocol yields amines (or amides in the case of azides) in an environmentally friendly way. Both experimental and theoretical studies suggest a non&#8208;radical but concerted mechanism, involving simultaneous B&#8722;B and N&#8722;N bond cleavage.







Abstract
Diboron reagents are known for their ability to promote the deoxygenation of amine or pyridine oxides, nitroarenes, and nitrones through the formation of B&#8722;O&#8722;B bonds. In this study, we have investigated the potential of diboron reagents to induce N&#8722;N bond cleavage in hydrazines, N&#8208;nitrosamines and azides. Our findings show that the combination of B2nep2 as diboron source and KOMe as a Lewis base can effectively promote the N&#8722;N cleavage of a wide variety of substrates. For hydrazines and nitrosamines, the presence of an aryl group is essential for the reaction to proceed, probably due to a better stabilization of the negative charge developed during N&#8722;N bond cleavage. Both types of azides, aromatic and aliphatic, are easily reduced, and the resulting amines can be in&#8197;situ converted into the corresponding amides by simple treatment with a carboxylic acid. Experimental and theoretical calculations suggest a non&#8208;radical mechanism, with concerted B&#8722;B and N&#8722;N bond cleavage in the case of hydrazines and azides, and a stepwise mechanism in the case of N&#8208;nitrosamines, where deoxygenation occurs as the first step, involving the formation of an N&#8208;nitrene intermediate.

         <title>Oxidation&#8208;Deformylation Cascade Catalyzed By a Mononuclear Copper Complex</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bioinspired copper complex is able to catalyze two successive oxidative steps of alcohol conversion in the presence of hydrogen peroxide under mild conditions: (i) alcohol oxidation to aldehyde and (ii) aldehyde deformylation. Isotopic effects on the reaction rates indicate that hydrogen atom abstraction is rate limiting for both steps.







Abstract
In this study, two copper complexes were synthesized using N3 (arising from two pyridines and one amide group) containing ligands N&#8208;(2&#8208;picolyl)picolinamide (L1H) and bis(2&#8208;pyridylcarbonyl)amine (L2H), forming [(L1)CuII(OH2)(NO3)] (1) and [(L2)CuII(OH2)2](NO3) (2). The reaction of complex 1 with hydrogen peroxide in alcoholic solvents yielded a formate&#8208;bound complex. Studies with isotopically labeled 13C ethanol indicated that formate originates from the C1 of ethanol after C&#8722;C bond cleavage. Complex 1 was found to catalytically convert primary alcohols into formic acid probably following a two&#8208;step process: (i) alcohol oxidation to aldehyde and (ii) aldehyde deformylation. Further experiments with 2&#8208;phenylpropionaldehyde (2&#8208;PPA) confirm the ability of complex 1 to catalyze aldehyde deformylation. Both steps of the reaction are associated with significant kinetic deuterium isotope effects (KDIE), suggesting that hydrogen atom abstractions (HAA) occur during the rate&#8208;determining steps of both conversions. Overall, this system proposes a clean catalytic process for alcohol&#8208;to&#8208;formic acid conversion, operating under mild conditions, and offering potential synthetic applications.

         <title>An Oxoiron(IV) Complex Supported by an N&#8208;Alkylated Cyclam Ligand System Containing a Pendant Alcohol Moiety</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Depending on the pendant atom present in the N&#8208;alkylated cyclam (1,4,8,11&#8208;tetraazacyclotetradecane) based ligand framework, substantially altered conformations of the non&#8208;heme iron(IV)&#8208;oxo intermediates are revealed.







Abstract
The effect of a pendant neutral alcohol moiety in the N&#8208;alkylated cyclam (1,4,8,11&#8208;tetraazacyclotetradecane) ligand backbone is examined for the non&#8208;heme mononuclear oxoiron(IV) unit in [FeIV(Osyn)(TMC&#8208;HOR)(NCCH3)]2+ (1&#8208;syn) (TMC&#8208;HOR=2&#8208;(4,8,11&#8208;trimethyl&#8208;1,4,8,11&#8208;tetraazacyclotetradecan1&#8208;yl)ethan&#8208;1&#8208;ol). Unlike in the related [FeIV(Oanti)(TMC&#8208;SR)]+ (3&#8208;anti) (TMC&#8208;SR=1&#8208;mercaptoethyl&#8208;4,8,11&#8208;trimethyl&#8208;1,4,8,11&#8208;tetraazacyclotetradecane) complex, bearing an axial mono&#8208;anionic thiolate ligand trans to the oxo unit, the alcohol moiety in 1&#8208;syn stays protonated and does not axially coordinate to iron. The protonation of the alcohol moiety is a prerequisite for the stabilization of the oxoiron(IV) core; it presumably serves as a hydrogen bonding donor to the oxoiron(IV) unit, which is positioned syn to the three methyl groups. Comparative reactivity studies reveal 1&#8208;syn to be a stronger hydrogen atom abstraction but weaker oxygen atom transfer agent relative to the [FeIV(Osyn)(TMC)(NCCH3)]2+ (2&#8208;syn) complex, bearing the N&#8208;tetramethylated cyclam (TMC) ligand.

         <title>The Fluoride Ion Affinity Revisited: Do We Need the Anchor&#8208;Point Approach?</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art benchmark of fluoride&#8208;ion affinities has been generated. Its application shows that widely used computational anchor&#8208;point methods based on isodesmic reactions rely on non&#8208;systematic error cancellations and are advantageous only when inappropriate density functionals and/or basis sets without diffuse functions are used. In all other cases direct FIA computations are accurate and preferable.







Abstract
A large and diverse high&#8208;level benchmark data set of computed gas&#8208;phase fluoride ion affinities (FIAs) for 71 small main&#8208;group Lewis acids is presented. It has been used to evaluate quantitatively DFT approaches with 52 functionals and 4 composite methods. Two widely used indirect anchor&#8208;point methods based on isodesmic reactions with fluorophosgene or the trimethyl silyl cation are compared to the direct computation of the FIA. It has been frequently stated that anchor&#8208;point methods are to be strongly preferred over direct FIA computations at DFT levels, as they avoid treatment of the naked fluoride ion. Here it is shown that this widespread assumption does not hold when modern functionals with low self&#8208;interaction errors and suitable basis sets with diffuse functions are used. In these cases, an anchor&#8208;point approach based on 

OCF2

 ${{\rm{OCF}}_2 }$



 has little or no advantage, and the widely used anchor&#8208;point calculations based on 

Me3Si+

 ${{\rm{Me}}_3 {\rm{Si}}^+ }$



 even deteriorate results in most cases. It is shown that this is due to a break&#8208;down of often prevailing error cancellations in the anchor&#8208;point approach that help to improve results when using less suitable functionals or basis sets. Overall, the direct computation of FIAs at appropriate DFT levels including diffuse basis functions is the clearly preferable route.

         <title>Embedding High&#8208;Density Ionic Sites in Porous Aromatic Frameworks via Multivariate Strategy for ReO4&#8722; Capture</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We proposed a rational method to link multiple building units using multivariate strategy and form PAFs with high density imidazolium groups. As expected, PAF&#8208;271with higher imidazolium density shows higher adsorption capacity for ReO4&#8722;.







Abstract
Rhenium is a rare and significant metal, making its recovery crucial for resource management. Herein, to address these issues, three porous aromatic frameworks with high&#8208;density ionic sites were successfully synthesized using a multivariate strategy. These MTV&#8208;iPAFs are named PAF&#8208;271, PAF&#8208;272 and PAF&#8208;273, respectively, and were employed for the ultrafast and selective removal of ReO4&#8722;. These materials exhibit varying high specific surface areas, porosities, and imidazolium densities. The results demonstrated that compared to PAF&#8208;272 with low adsorption site density and PAF&#8208;273 with high specific surface area, PAF&#8208;271 with higher imidazolium density exhibited superior performance for ReO4&#8722; adsorption. Specifically, PAF&#8208;271 could remove 98&#8201;% of ReO4&#8722; within 2&#8197;min, achieving a maximum adsorption capacity was 707&#8197;mg g&#8722;1. Moreover, PAF&#8208;271 also had excellent stability, making it highly effective for ReO4&#8722; adsorption under strong acid or alkali, radiation, high anion concentration and even in Hanford simulated waste liquid, it is expected to be applied to adsorb TcO4&#8722;. Embedding high&#8208;density ionic sites within PAFs by multivariate strategy result in highly stable and effective ReO4&#8722; disposal approach.

         <title>Syntheses of Structurally Complex Marine Cyclopropyl&#8208;Diterpenoids: Peyssonnoside A and Its Aglycon</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This report provides a comprehensive account of the development of the first total synthesis of the marine natural product peyssonnoside A. After exploring several approaches that proved unsuccessful, a successful strategy was established, utilizing the Simmons&#8208;Smith reaction to construct the cyclopropane moiety at the core of the natural product.







Abstract
Peyssonnoside A is a marine&#8208;derived sulfated diterpenoid glucoside featuring a remarkable 5/6/3/6 tetracyclic skeleton with a highly substituted cyclopropane ring deeply embedded in its structure. Herein, we report on the full development of the first total synthesis of this natural product and its aglycon, peyssonnosol. Through the experimental evaluation of a series of synthetic strategies, including utilization of Ohloff&#8211;Rautenstrauch cycloisomerization and C&#8722;H allylation, we identified a concise, efficient, and highly diastereoselective route. Key steps in the synthesis of the aglycone peyssonnosol include a Simmons&#8211;Smith cyclopropanation and a Mukaiyama hydration, both guided by the inherent spatial features of the substrates. This optimized approach enabled the synthesis of peyssonnosol in 12 steps and 21&#8201;% overall yield and provides a robust framework for accessing structurally complex marine natural products.

         <title>Hydrogen&#8208;bonding Assisted Quantum Yield Enhancement and Chromism Activity of 4&#8217;&#8208;Halo&#8208;2&#8217;&#8208;azaboranils</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
2&#8217;&#8208;azaboranils freezing the axial rotation reduce the nonradiative deactivation pathway to significantly improve the luminescence quantum yields over those for the parent boranils. In a network of &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking, halogen&#8208;bonding, H&#8722;F hydrogen&#8208;bonding, and CH&#8208;&#960; interaction, 4&#8217;&#8208;chloro&#8208;2&#8217;&#8208;azaboranil shows mechanochromism and vapochromism.







Abstract

         <title>Novel Base&#8208;Labile Linkers for Convenient Purification and Functional Group Introduction in Solid&#8208;Phase Glycan Synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three novel base&#8208;labile linkers, synthesized through straightforward chemical methods, yield terminal amines, carboxylic acid groups, and free reducing ends after solid&#8208;phase glycan synthesis. The phthalate in resin 2 and resin 3 can be cleaved by methanolysis or hydrazinolysis. Using these linkers, nine tetrasaccharides and one octasaccharide were successfully synthesized.







Abstract
Glycans are essential biomolecules across species, but their structure&#8208;property relationships remain poorly understood. Pure oligosaccharide samples are crucial for studying these properties, and their preparation heavily relies on chemical synthesis. The linker used for attaching the oligosaccharide to the solid support is essential during solid&#8208;phase glycan synthesis. Here, we present three base&#8208;labile linkers compatible with Merrifield resin. The first type of resin, containing a hydroxyhexanoic acid linker, can be prepared in a one&#8208;step synthesis and releases glycans with a terminal carboxylic acid after methanolysis and hydrolysis. Linkers on the second and third types of resin can be synthesized through simple chemical reactions and cleaved to reveal either a free reducing end of the oligosaccharide or a terminal amine with a C5&#8208;spacer. The phthalate structure in the second and third types of resin is sensitive to sodium methoxide and can also be cleaved during hydrazinolysis. Hydrazinolysis, rather than methanolysis, enables the isolation of oligosaccharide with pivaloyl ester protection and facilitates the purification process compared to partially protected compounds. Using these resins, we prepared nine tetrasaccharides and one octasaccharide, including &#945; (1&#8208;6) mannan, &#945; (1&#8208;4) glucan, &#946; (1&#8208;4) glucan, and &#946; (1&#8208;3) glucan. Glycans with terminal functional groups can be converted into glycoconjugates for further applications.

         <title>Directional Macrocycle Transport, Release, and Recapture Enabled by a Rotaxane Transporter</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study represents a bistable rotaxane that enables the directional shuttling, release, and recapture of a dibenzo&#8208;24&#8208;crown&#8208;8 macrocycle upon addition of suitable chemical stimuli. This two&#8208;step molecular transport and release can be followed by NMR and distinct changes in the molecular fluorescence. Based on rational molecular design, the liberated macrocycle is recaptured on to the thread and the mechanical bond is regenerated which allows for directional macrocycle transport and release in an iterative manner.








Abstract
A transporter for a directional macrocycle transport, release, and recapture was constructed. This was achieved using a rotaxane featuring a dibenzo&#8208;24&#8208;crown&#8208;8 macrocycle, dibenzylammonium (DBA)/methyl triazolium (MTA) stations on the thread and anthracene/triisopropylsilyl&#8208;acetylene stoppers, respectively. In the protonated rotaxane, the macrocycle primarily resides on the DBA station, followed by directional shuttling to the MTA station upon treatment with base. Addition of fluoride as an additional chemical input cleaves the triisopropylsilyl stopper, leading to release of the macrocycle and the half&#8208;thread into solution. The released macrocycle can be recaptured by protonation, and the mechanical bond can be reestablished via CuAAC click reaction, enabled by the terminal acetylene unit on the half&#8208;thread. This generates an elongated second&#8208;generation rotaxane transporter, which was used for a second cycle of directional macrocycle transport and release, proving the possibility of an iterative operation of the rotaxane&#8208;transporter in this molecular design.

         <title>Fused Nitrogen Bridgehead N,O&#8208;Acetals as Versatile Scaffolds: Synthetic Strategies, Mechanism and Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fused nitrogen&#8208;bridgehead N,O&#8208;acetals receive specific emphasis as pivotal scaffolds due to their significant role in the bioactivity of medicinally relevant molecules. Significant approaches have been reported on their role as key synthetic building blocks/motifs in the construction of complex organic molecules and their utility as chiral auxiliaries in the enantioselective synthesis of natural products and synthetic compound libraries. This study will give new insights into the synthetic strategies, as well as into the mechanism and applications of such interesting nitrogen bridgehead fused N,O&#8208;bicycle acetals, and especially for the hydropyrrolo&#8208;oxazole/&#8208;oxazine derivatives.








Abstract
Fused Bicyclic N,O&#8208;acetals, are prominently present in several natural products and constitute a versatile family of compounds, with nitrogen&#8208;bridgehead fused N,O&#8208;bicyclic derivatives receiving specific emphasis as pivotal scaffolds due to their significant role in the bioactivity of medicinally relevant molecules. Hence, significant advancements in their applications in Organic Synthesis have been extensively documented in the literature, highlighting their role as key synthetic building blocks/motifs in the construction of complex organic molecules and their utility as chiral auxiliaries in the enantioselective synthesis of natural products and synthetic compound libraries. Nonetheless, while these developments have been well&#8208;explored, our review offers a new perspective by consolidating and critically evaluating various synthetic strategies for accessing the nitrogen&#8208;bridgehead fused N,O&#8208;acetal frameworks (such as hydropyrrolo&#8208;oxazole and oxazine frameworks) providing new insights into their mechanistic approaches and applications, and demonstrating their full potential in advanced synthetic chemistry. These methodologies are systematically covered in terms of their mechanistic pathways, synthetic efficiency, and practical applications, providing an integrated understanding of their contribution to the field of Organic Synthesis.

         <title>Tandem ADMET and CAMMP to Access Degradable Thermosets and Multiblock Copolymers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of degradable polymers and multiblock copolymeric (MBCPs) compatibilizers represents an appealing strategy to address ever&#8208;growing concerns for treating waste plastics of traditional chemical degradation or mechanical recycling. Although recent advancements in cyclic&#8208;acyclic monomers metathesis polymerization (CAMMP) and tandem olefin metathesis polymerization (TOMP) have recently been reported to produce degradable polymers and MBCPs via copolymerization of cyclic monomers with acyclic diene comonomers, there have been no reports of preparing high&#8208;performance thermosetting materials and multi&#8208;block copolymers within the same polymerization system solely through the selection of cycloolefin monomers. To achieve this objective, a tandem olefin metathesis polymerization system has been designed that combines acyclic diene metathesis (ADMET) polymerization of diene comonomers followed by CAMMP with cyclic olefin monomers (dicyclopentadiene DCPD or cyclooctene COE). The selection of different cyclic olefin monomers provided access to degradable cross&#8208;linked thermosets and multi&#8208;block copolymers. Notably, this one&#8208;pot, two&#8208;step process is highly efficient and requires the addition of only one metathesis catalyst.</dc:description>

         <title>Recent Advances in Polyoxometalate&#8211;Metal Nanocluster Hybrids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Abstract: Polyoxometalates (POMs) are structurally well&#8208;defined anionic metal&#8211;oxo clusters with diverse structural forms and distinctive physicochemical properties, including acidity/basicity, redox activity, and optical behavior. Over the past two decades, POMs have garnered increasing attention in metal nanocluster synthesis owing to their ability to impart unique structural and functional characteristics to these compounds. Initially, research in this field primarily focused on hybrid materials composed of POMs and metal nanoclusters stabilized by organic ligands. However, more recently, studies have demonstrated that POMs can themselves act as effective stabilizing ligands for the synthesis of atomically precise metal nanoclusters.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Abstract: Polyoxometalates (POMs) are structurally well-defined anionic metal&#8211;oxo clusters with diverse structural forms and distinctive physicochemical properties, including acidity/basicity, redox activity, and optical behavior. Over the past two decades, POMs have garnered increasing attention in metal nanocluster synthesis owing to their ability to impart unique structural and functional characteristics to these compounds. Initially, research in this field primarily focused on hybrid materials composed of POMs and metal nanoclusters stabilized by organic ligands. However, more recently, studies have demonstrated that POMs can themselves act as effective stabilizing ligands for the synthesis of atomically precise metal nanoclusters. These POM-stabilized metal nanoclusters exhibit synergistic and cooperative properties of metal nanocluster and POM components, enabling novel applications in fields such as catalysis, photochemistry, sensing, and electrochemistry. Notably, recent investigations into POM&#8211;metal nanocluster hybrids have demonstrated their potential as atomically precise counterparts to metal nanoparticle catalysts supported on bulk metal oxides, exhibiting the unique cooperative catalysis. This review provides a concise overview of POM&#8210;metal nanocluster hybrids, with an emphasis on recent advancements in synthetic methodologies, properties, and applications. Additionally, solid-state synthetic strategies leveraging the rigid structures and redox properties of POMs for the controlled formation of metal nanoclusters are discussed.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ni(OH)x/Ni&#8208;Catalyzed In&#8208;Situ Hydrogenation and Ethanol Ethoxylation of 2&#8208;Methylfuran for Renewable Biofuel Co&#8208;Upgrading</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Bioethanol and furanics are currently prevailing additives to fossil&#8208;based transportation fuels. With the objective to lift the longstanding limitations of these biofuel additives, this work reports for the first time the synthesis of 2&#8208;Ethoxy&#8208;2&#8208;methyltetrahydrofuran (2&#8208;EO&#8208;2&#8208;MTHF) as a co&#8208;upgraded fuel by reacting ethanol with 2&#8208;methylfuran (2&#8208;MF). The formation of 2&#8208;EO&#8208;2&#8208;MTHF is achieved through ethanol ethoxylation of 2&#8208;MF, enabled by a reverse Ni(OH)x/Ni catalyst under hydrogen pressure. Nickel hydroxide species over the Ni nanoparticles play a crucial role in activating ethanol and polarizing the partially hydrogenated dihydrofuran intermediates, favorably steering the reaction selectively toward the ethoxylation product. The reaction conditions, including pressure and temperature, are systematically optimized to enhance the yield of 2&#8208;EO&#8208;2&#8208;MTHF, and provide a mean to beneficially tune the fuel compositions consisting mainly of 2&#8208;EO&#8208;2&#8208;MTHF and 2&#8208;MTHF, both are high energy density molecules. Importantly, the reverse Ni(OH)x&#8208;Ni catalyst allows a one&#8208;pot process to accomplish consecutive partial hydrogenation of 2&#8208;MF and ethanol ethoxylation. This work provides a practical strategy for upgrading biomass&#8208;derived polar primary fuel molecules into more versatile fuels and chemicals.</dc:description>

         <title>Data&#8208;Driven Prediction of Reactivity and Additive Selection for C(sp2)&#8211;(Hetero)atom Bond Couplings in an Adaptive Dynamic Homogeneous Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Under visible light&#8208;driven redox conditions, employing transition&#8208;metal catalysis provides a powerful platform for constructing C(sp&#178;)&#8211;(hetero)atom bonds. Although these reactions are highly significant, they require precise optimization of reaction parameters. K&#246;nig, Ghosh and colleagues introduced an adaptive dynamic homogeneous catalysis (AD&#8208;HoC) platform that furnishes robust, high&#8208;yield conditions for photocatalyzed cross&#8208;coupling reactions. The AD&#8208;HoC system eliminates the need to optimize catalysts, ligands, and bases; instead, it achieves C(sp&#178;)&#8211;(hetero)atom bond coupling by merely altering additives and substrate molecules. Leveraging the predictability of reaction conditions within the AD&#8208;HoC system, machine learning offers a method to evaluate the reactivity of substrate combinations and the categories of additives. Our research integrates high&#8208;throughput quantum mechanical calculations with cheminformatics approaches to explore the reactivity of substrate combinations and the selection of additives within the AD&#8208;HoC system. Further data&#8208;driven analysis reveals that the electronic characteristics of electrophiles and the geometric characteristics of nucleophiles are key factors regulating reactivity within the AD&#8208;HoC system. Herein, we present an end&#8208;to&#8208;end tool for prediction starting from the SMILES representation. This work demonstrates the collaborative use of computational statistics and machine learning to predict the reactivity and reaction conditions of substrate combinations, thereby enhancing the precision and efficiency of synthetic processes.</dc:description>

         <title>Quantitative Generation of HF from KF and Formation of Amine&#8208;3HF Complexes by Using Cation Exchange Reaction between KF and Amberlyst 15DRY</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A safe and convenient method for the quantitative generation of hydrogen fluoride (HF) from potassium fluoride (KF) at room temperature was successfully demonstrated using the cation exchange reaction between KF and Amberlyst 15DRY in acetonitrile (MeCN). After one of the cation exchange reactions, HF was generated from KF in 69% yield. On the other hand, HF was generated quantitatively by removing the generated HF and repeating the cation exchange reaction 7 times. During and after the cation exchange reaction, the generated HF was separated from the Amberlyst 15DRY by decantation and filtration without any loss of HF. When the Amberlyst 15DRY was regenerated and then reused in the cation exchange reaction 10 times, HF was generated almost quantitatively each time and the yield of HF did not decrease at all. In addition, when 1/3 equivalent of amines was added to the resulting HF&#8208;containing solution, a variety of amine&#8208;3HF complexes with controlled stoichiometric ratios were formed in quantitative yields.</dc:description>

         <title>Bionanocomposite of Dual Antioxidant and Protease Function by Co&#8208;immobilization of Tannic Acid and Papain on Anionic Clays</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synchronized operation of antioxidants and enzymes is necessary for the proper functioning of living organisms and various industrial processes. The drawback that these biomolecules are susceptible to several environmental factors can be overcome by their immobilization on appropriate host materials. Here, molecular antioxidant tannic acid (TA) and papain enzyme (PPN) were co&#8208;immobilized on layered double hydroxide (LDH) nanoparticles to enhance their stability and facilitate their combined function. In the sequential adsorption method governed by electrostatic interactions, TA was first adsorbed on oppositely charged LDH (LDH/TA) and then, PPN was immobilized on the surface of the nanoparticles (LDH/TA/PPN). The optimal TA and PPN doses were determined by systematic size and charge measurements of the particles in dispersions to obtain stable colloids in each preparation step. The co&#8208;immobilization of the biomolecules was confirmed by spectroscopy methods. The resulting LDH/TA/PPN nanocomposite exhibited remarkable antioxidant and protease activities. The dual biological function together with the considerable colloidal stability make the LDH/TA/PPN material a promising candidate in various processes in academia and more applied disciplines, where simultaneous antioxidant and proteolytic functions are desired.</dc:description>

         <title>A Vibration&#8208;Induced Emission&#8208;Based Ratiometric Sensor for Detection of Anions in Aqueous Solution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fluorescent chemosensors that respond to anions via vibration&#8208;induced emission (VIE) have emerged as powerful tools to identify and quantify closely related species. However, VIE&#8208;based anion sensors have been limited to use in non&#8208;competitive organic solvents. Here, we introduce a VIE&#8208;based sensor, ZnDPA&#8208;DPAC, that provides a highly sensitive ratiometric response to quantify citrate and phosphate anions in aqueous solvent mixtures.








Abstract
Sensors that respond to anions via vibration&#8208;induced emission (VIE) have recently emerged as effective tools for discrimination between closely related carboxylate species in non&#8208;competitive, organic solvents. However, the utility of this sensing mechanism has not yet been demonstrated for anions in aqueous media. Here, we prepared two sensors, monoZnDPA&#8208;DPAC and ZnDPA&#8208;DPAC, with either one or two anion&#8208;binding motifs. These systems are capable of binding to anions in water. Dual emission via VIE is maintained in solvent mixtures of up to 70% water. ZnDPA&#8208;DPAC provides a unique, ratiometric response to citrate and phosphate, which was used for the accurate quantification of aqueous solutions of these anions.

         <title>Spin and Structural Dynamics of Persistent &#960;&#8208;Mer and &#960;&#8208;Dimer of a Tethered S,C,C&#8208;Bridged Triphenylamine Dimer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Injection of electron spins into tethered dimer comprising two planar sulfur&#8208; and carbon&#8208;bridged triphenylamine units yields almost perfectly overlapping face&#8208;to&#8208;face close &#960;&#8208;stacking structures that have close S&#8211;S interatomic contacts. The mixed&#8208;valence radical cation (&#960;&#8208;mer) salt exhibits unique spin and structural dynamics.








Abstract
One&#8208; and two&#8208;electron&#8208;oxidized species of two &#960;&#8208;conjugated systems that adopt close &#960;&#8208;stacking structures are referred to as &#960;&#8208;mers and &#960;&#8208;dimers, respectively. These cationic species exhibit intriguing physicochemical properties that are markedly distinct from those of their parent monomeric radical cations. In this study, we have achieved the chemical oxidation of a newly designed tethered dimer comprising two planar sulfur&#8208; and carbon&#8208;bridged triphenylamine (SCBT) units linked by a 1,8&#8208;naphthalene moiety to obtain the corresponding &#960;&#8208;mer and &#960;&#8208;dimer as crystalline materials. Single&#8208;crystal x&#8208;ray diffraction analyses revealed that these cationic species adopt almost perfectly overlapping face&#8208;to&#8208;face close &#960;&#8208;stacking structures. As the degree of oxidation increases from the neutral form to the monocation and the dication, the interatomic S&#8211;&#8208;S distance decreases drastically from 5.35 to 3.03 &#197;. The injection of electron spins into the neutral species effectively induces covalent&#8208;like bonding interactions between the sulfur atoms and changes the degree of structural freedom of the molecule. The salt of the &#960;&#8208;mer exhibited an electrical conductivity of 1.9 &#215; 10&#8722;6 S cm&#8722;1 at room temperature. The injection of spins by chemical oxidation also dramatically changed the dielectric response by generating dipole moments that affect the symmetry of the molecule.

         <title>Multifunctional Applications of Self&#8208;Assembled Novel LnIII (DyIII and GdIII) Isotructural Nanoclusters: Single&#8208;Molecule Magnetism and MRI Contrast Agent</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two novel LnIII (Ln = DyIII and GdIII) nanoclusters ([Dy5(L)12(&#956;3&#8208;OH)2(H2O)2]Cl&#183;4EtOH&#183;2CH3CN&#183;5H2O (1) and [Gd5(L)12(&#956;3&#8208;OH)2(H2O)2]Cl&#183;5EtOH&#183;5CH3CN&#183;11H2O (2)) are prepared by regulating metal salts. Cluster 1 exhibits the characteristic slow relaxation property associated with single&#8208;molecule magnets (SMMs). In contrast, cluster 2 shows low&#8208;temperature magnetic refrigeration characteristics and can serve as a typical T1&#8208;type magnetic resonance contrast agent.








Abstract
Rare earth clusters have demonstrated promising application prospects, owing to their distinctive topological structures and electronic configurations. Herein, two novel LnIII (Ln = DyIII and GdIII) clusters were synthesized using 2&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;1&#8208;naphthaldehyde and 1,1&#8208;di(hydroxymethyl)ethylamine, along with Dy(ClO4)3&#183;10H2O and Gd(ClO4)3&#183;10H2O, respectively named as [Dy5(L)12(&#956;3&#8208;OH)2(H2O)2]Cl&#183;4EtOH&#183;2CH3CN&#183;5H2O (1) and [Gd5(L)12(&#956;3&#8208;OH)2(H2O)2]Cl&#183;5EtOH&#183;5CH3CN&#183;11H2O (2). The single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction results indicated that clusters 1 and 2 possessed highly stable co&#8208;vertex double triangular metal skeletons, in which the LnIII spin centers form a triangular [Ln3O] cluster via &#956;3&#8208;OH. Magnetic studies revealed that cluster 1 exhibited the characteristic slow relaxation property associated with single&#8208;molecule magnets (SMMs), with an effective energy barrier (Ueff/kB) of 1.48 and 4.76 K under 0 and 2000&#160;Oe DC field, respectively. In contrast, cluster 2 showed low&#8208;temperature magnetic refrigeration characteristics (maximum &#8208;&#916;Sm = 9.76 J kg&#8722;1 K&#8722;1, &#916;H = 5 T at 2.0 K). In addition, cluster 2 exhibited an excellent longitudinal relaxation rate (r1) with 2.74&#160;mm&#8722;1s&#8722;1 at 0.5 T and a relatively suitable r2/r1 value (1.12), indicating that it can serve as a typical T1&#8208;type magnetic resonance contrast agent.

         <title>Nitro&#8208;group &#960; system drives the interaction of RRx&#8208;001 with solvated electrons in solution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Reactivity towards low&#8208;energy electrons (LEE) has been hypothesized as a cause of radio&#8208;modifying properties for various molecules. LEE's transient nature, however, prevents the establishment of clear links between initial processes at the sub&#8208;ps time scale and the final products of radiolysis. Here, such links are explored for radio&#8208;modifying compound RRx&#8208;001 (1&#8208;bromoacetyl&#8208;3,3&#8208;dinitroazetidine). &#160;Picosecond pulse radiolysis demonstrates the high scavenging capacity of the molecule for secondary quasi&#8208;free and solvated electrons forming stable parent anions confirmed by studies of microsolvated RRx&#8208;001 in clusters. The anions decay either via auto&#8208;detachment of an electron or dissociate involving hydrogen transfer from solvent resulting in NO2 and 1&#8208;(bromoacetyl)&#8208;3&#8208;nitroazetidine. Surprisingly, no Br dissociation is observed despite its high electron affinity. We assign this behavior to the "inaccessibility" of sigma virtual states for electrons in the solvent, which can be of a general nature.</dc:description>

Here, such links are explored for radio-modifying compound RRx-001 (1-bromoacetyl-3,3-dinitroazetidine). &#160;Picosecond pulse radiolysis demonstrates the high scavenging capacity of the molecule for secondary quasi-free and solvated electrons forming stable parent anions confirmed by studies of microsolvated RRx-001 in clusters. The anions decay either via auto-detachment of an electron or dissociate involving hydrogen transfer from solvent resulting in NO2 and 1-(bromoacetyl)-3-nitroazetidine. Surprisingly, no Br dissociation is observed despite its high electron affinity. We assign this behavior to the "inaccessibility" of sigma virtual states for electrons in the solvent, which can be of a general nature.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Excited State Branching Processes in a Ru(II)&#8208;based Donor&#8208;Acceptor&#8208;Donor System</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Excited states properties such as excitation energy, accessibility of the respective excited state either by direct or indirect population transfer, and its lifetime govern the application of these excited states in light&#8208;driven reactions, e.g. photocatalysis using transition metal complexes. Compared with triplet metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge transfer (3MLCT) states, charge&#8208;separated (3CS) excited states involving organic moieties, such as triplet intra&#8208;ligand or ligand&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge transfer (3ILCT and 3LLCT) states, tend to possess longer&#8208;lived excited states due to the weak spin&#8208;orbit coupling with the closed&#8208;shell ground state. Thus, the combination of inorganic and organic chromophores enables isolating the triplet states onto the organic chromophore. Herein, we aim to elucidate the excited&#8208;state relaxation processes in a Ru(II)&#8208;terpyridyl donor&#8208;acceptor&#8208;donor system (RuCl) in a joint spectroscopic&#8208;theoretical approach combining steady&#8208;state and time&#8208;resolved spectroscopy as well as quantum chemical simulations and dissipative quantum dynamics. The electron transfer (ET) processes involving the low&#8208;lying 3MLCT, 3ILCT and 3LLCT excited states were investigated experimentally and computationally within a semi&#8208;classical Marcus picture. Finally, dissipative quantum dynamical simulations&#8211;capable of describing incomplete ET processes involving all three states&#8211;enabled us to unravel the competitive relaxation channels at short and long timescales among the strongly coupled 3MLCT&#8208;3ILCT states and weakly coupled 3MLCT&#8208;3LLCT and 3ILCT&#8208;3LLCT states.</dc:description>

         <title>Exploiting Activated Alkyne Chemistry for the Synthesis of Tailored Amphiphilic Janus Dendrimers with Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission and Their Assemblies for Cell Imaging</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Amphiphilic Janus dendrimers (AJDs) are a promising class of macromolecules capable of self&#8208;assembling into well&#8208;defined nanostructures. In this study, AJDs were synthesized employing, for the first time, the activated alkyne&#8208;hydroxyl "click" chemistry approach, enabling the construction of dendritic architectures under mild conditions. The AJDs were functionalized with a &#960;&#8208;extended tetraphenylethylene (TPE) derivative, imparting aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) properties. These AJDs self&#8208;assembled into fluorescent nanostructures, including micelles and dendrimersomes, with tunable dimensions. The AIE&#8208;active assemblies demonstrated strong photoluminescence upon aggregation and were characterized by narrow size distributions. Cytotoxicity and cellular uptake studies using Chinese Hamster Ovary K1 (CHO&#8208;K1) cells revealed excellent biocompatibility and efficient cellular internalization, confirming their potential for live&#8208;cell imaging. Importantly, the extended &#960;&#8208;conjugation of the TPE derivative facilitated excitation at longer wavelengths, compatible with conventional confocal microscopy. This work showcases the versatility of activated alkyne&#8208;hydroxyl "click" chemistry in dendrimer synthesis and highlights the potential of these AJD&#8208;based nanostructures in nanomedicine, particularly for imaging and diagnostic applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Two&#8208;photon excitation of bright diaza[4]helicenes for isotropic and circularly polarized emission</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Helicenes are chiral organic dyes that are attracting growing attention due to the high tunability of their (chir)optical and electronic properties. In this work, a series of functionalized cationic diaza[4]helicenes based on dimethoxyquinacridinium (DMQA) scaffolds are presented. By merging branched N&#8208;alkyl side chains and triple para&#8208;functionalization with OMe groups, structures combine improved chiroptical responses (5x increase) and strong fluorescence quantum yields (&#966;f &#8776; 70% in acetonitrile). An overall improved efficiency of the emission of circularly polarized light with BCPL values reaching 3.4 M&#8211;1 cm&#8211;1 is obtained. Additionally, two&#8208;photon excitation (2PE) studies were performed, showing good values of cross section at 810 nm. Interestingly, 2PE CPL spectra were acquired for the most performant derivatives (Nisopropyl and N&#8208;cyclohexyl); this type of measurement being usually challenging for organic molecular species. Finally, the viability of these compounds in single and two&#8208;photon excitation microscopy is also shown.</dc:description>

         <title>Exploring the modulation of the complex folding landscape of Human Telomeric DNA by low molecular weight ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Telomeric DNA forms G&#8208;quadruplex (G4) structures. These G4s structures are crucial for genomic stability and therapeutic targeting. Using time&#8208;resolved NMR and CD spectroscopies, we investigated how the ligand Phen&#8208;DC3 modulates the folding of the human telomeric repeat 23TAG DNA. The kinetics are modulated by the ligand and by the presence of potassium cations (K+). Ligand binding to G4 occurs via a triphasic process with fast and slow phases. Notably, for the G4 structure in the presence of K+, the slow rate is ten times slower than without K+. These findings offer key insights into the modulation of the complex folding landscape of G4s by ligands, advancing our understanding of G4&#8208;ligand interactions for potential therapeutic applications.</dc:description>

Abstract
Herein, we report a general, efficient, and practical methodology for the macrocyclization of compounds based on the combination of a Cu&#8208;catalyzed click&#8208;and&#8208;release reaction and a hydrophobic tag. The procedure allows the preparation of cyclic products of different sizes and with various functionalities without the need of purification.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Herein, we report a general, efficient, and practical methodology for the macrocyclization of compounds based on the combination of a Cu-catalyzed click-and-release reaction and a hydrophobic tag. The procedure allows the preparation of cyclic products of different sizes and with various functionalities without the need of purification.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Preparation of a Homochiral Porous Organic Cage RCC2&#8208;S&#8208;Bonded Silica as a Stationary Phase for High&#8208;Performance Liquid Chromatography Enantioseparation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this work, a reduced homochiral  porous organic cage (RCC2&#8208;S) based chiral stationary phase (CSP), RCC2&#8208;S@SiO2&#8208;SH, was prepared by bonding RCC2&#8208;S on thiolated silica (SiO2&#8208;SH) viaa thiol&#8208;ene click reaction. The CSP (RCC2&#8208;S@SiO2&#8208;SH) showed excellent enantioseparation in both normal&#8208;phase HPLC (NP&#8208;HPLC) and reversed&#8208;phase HPLC (RP&#8208;HPLC) modes, effectively separating various chiral compounds, including alcohols, esters, ketones, amines, imidazoles, epoxides, and organic acids. As a result, 12 racemates were enantioseparated under NP&#8208;HPLC, and 17 racemates were enantioseparated under RP&#8208;HPLC. The CSP also exhibited good complementarity in chiral separation with commercial Chiralpak AD&#8208;H, Chiralcel OD&#8208;H, and the previously reported chiral POC CC19&#8208;R columns, successfully separating some racemates that remained unresolved or poorly resolved on these three columns. Additionally, the fabricated RCC2&#8208;S@SiO2&#8208;SH packed column demonstrated good reproducibility and stability. The relative standard deviations (RSDs) of retention time and resolution value were less than 0.5% and 1.5%, respectively, after the column had been subjected to hundreds of injections. This work indicates that chiral porous organic cages have great potential for the separation of enantiomers in HPLC.</dc:description>

         <title>Towards Symmetric Organic Aqueous Flow Batteries: Triarylamine&#8208;Based Bipolar Molecules and their Characterization via an Extended Kouteck&#253;&#8208;Levich Analysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Symmetric organic flow batteries (SOFBs) can potentially address membrane crossover problems by employing bipolar redox&#8208;active organic molecules (BROMs). Herein, a triarylamine (TAA) skeleton was chosen as a posolyte moiety for a new class of bipolar molecules for pH&#8208;neutral aqueous FBs. Pyridinium and viologen derivatives were tethered to the posolyte moiety, and the new compounds were characterized. Cyclic voltammetry revealed that only viologen with a highly hydrophilic substituent, connected to the TAA moiety via a Zincke reaction, could be reversibly reduced. Varying the supporting electrolyte concentration on the selected derivative revealed water solubility as a challenge for further development. The selected derivative, MeO&#8208;TPA&#8208;Vi&#8208;DMAE, was subjected to hydrodynamic voltammetry, and a modified Kouteck&#253;&#8208;Levich analysis was developed to investigate the observed potential&#8208;dependent currents at the hydrodynamically dominated region, which are often seen with redox&#8208;active organic molecules. This model discarded a purely Ohmic effect, showing a useful Levich slope at a certain overpotential before the onset of a secondary reaction. TAA&#8208;based BROMs hold promise for pH&#8208;neutral aqueous SOFBs, and the results will guide the design of new derivatives. The three&#8208;term Kouteck&#253;&#8208;Levich relation here introduced will be useful not only to develop BROM&#8208;based flow batteries but will most likely appeal to a much broader audience.</dc:description>

         <title>Photoswitching Lanthanoid Luminescence With Diazocines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photomodulation of lanthanoid luminescence promises new layers of complexity for diverse applications. We herein present a new strategy for the manipulation of luminescence intensities and lifetimes based on diazocine photoswitches. This strategy is particularly well suited for multiplexing and does not require covalent connection of individual photoactive components.








Abstract
The unique photophysical properties of the lanthanoids provide the core functionality for various high&#8208;tech applications, including optoelectronic materials, lasers, anti&#8208;counterfeiting dyes, or tools for biological sciences. The combination of these luminophores with photoswitches has the potential to make them remote controllable and adds new layers of complexity to their applications. We herein report that such a photomodulation of EuIII, TbIII, and YbIII luminescence is possible with the aid of diazocine photoswitches. The new approach, which does not require covalent connection of the photoswitch and antenna ligand, is by design suitable for multiplexing applications and allows for a drastic and reversible modulation of the overall luminescence intensity and luminescence lifetimes. Photophysical studies under bypassing of the antenna ligand and at 77 K gave insights into the mechanism of the effect.

         <title>Enhanced Solid&#8208;State Triplet&#8211;Triplet Annihilation Upconversion Steered by AIE&#8208;Active Isomers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The morphology of a molecular crystal plays a critical role in the upconversion performance of a solid&#8208;state triplet&#8211;triplet annihilation upconversion (TTA&#8208;UC) system. Various crystals with different morphological features of a red&#8208;to&#8208;blue sensitizer/annihilator pair were made via different crystallization methods. It turned out that the UC crystal composed of regular nanograins with intact crystalline lattices demonstrated the most enhanced UC performance due to the improved triplet energy migration.








Abstract
A red&#8208;to&#8208;blue solid&#8208;state triplet&#8211;triplet annihilation upconversion (TTA&#8208;UC) molecular crystal with a significantly improved upconverted photoluminescence intensity was first achieved via a controlled crystallization pathway. Cyano&#8208;substituted stilbene derivatives and transition metal complexes were coupled for TTA&#8208;UC systems. The photophysical properties of the two annihilators and their TTA&#8208;UC systems in solution and aggregate were comprehensively studied. Particularly, UC crystals were simply prepared under different crystallization conditions resulting in different morphological and structural features. It turned out that the UC crystal prepared in the surfactant&#8208;assisted crystallization method demonstrated a 100&#8208;fold higher UC intensity than that in the evaporation crystallization method. The morphological and structural study indicated small nanograins with intact crystalline lattice would facilitate the triplet energy migration leading to a boosted UC efficiency. This work provides a novel perspective for the facile construction of high&#8208;efficient solid&#8208;state TTA&#8208;UC systems by utilizing crystals with appropriate morphology, which significantly promotes the practical applications of TTA&#8208;UC.

         <title>Control of Chemo&#8208;Selectivity via Alcohol&#8208;Affected Kinetics in Cu&#8208;Hydroxylamine Catalyzed Aerobic Oxidation of Mesitol</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We propose an alcohol&#8208;adjustable strategy to control the oxidation of mesitol catalyzed by CuCl2/NH2OH&#183;HCl system. In tBuOH, the product aldehyde has high selectivity, while in MeOH, the ether intermediate is the main product, and its kinetics and mechanism have been studied in detail.








Abstract
Chemo&#8208;selectivity control is a critical challenge in aerobic C&#8722;H oxidations, particularly in preventing overoxidation. In this work, we present an alcohol&#8208;tunable strategy to control the oxidation degree of CuCl&#8322;/NH&#8322;OH&#183;HCl&#8208;catalyzed mesitol oxidation in alcohols. In tBuOH, the reaction efficiently yields the aldehyde product with high selectivity, whereas in MeOH, the ether intermediate turned out to be the predominant product. Further kinetic analysis and mechanistic studies revealed that the reactivity is driven by the in&#8208;situ formation of protonated alkyl nitrate ([RON(O)OH]+), highlighting the critical role of ROH solvents. The differing responses of mesitol and the ether intermediate to the reaction conditions result in distinct kinetics across different alcohols, enabling precise control over the final products. These findings provide mechanistic insights into the origins of alcohol&#8208;dependent chemo&#8208;selectivity and pave the way for advancing protocols for selectivity control.

         <title>Effects of Chirality and Counter Anions on the Structures and Solid&#8208;State Properties of Radical Cation Salts of Benzo[b]Phenoxazine&#8208;Based Double Heterohelicene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Structures and electronic properties of radical cation salts of racemic and enantiopure double hetero[5]helicene with SbCl6&#8722; and NTf2&#8722; counter anions were investigated. Enantiopure NTf2&#8722; salts exhibited low melting points and drastic changes in magnetic properties upon melting, while racemic NTf2&#8722; salt showed a crystal&#8211;crystal phase transition near room temperature.








Abstract
In this study, we prepared stable radical cation salts of racemic and enantiopure double hetero[5]helicene (1), consisting of two benzo[b]phenoxazine (BPO) molecules, using two different counter anions (SbCl6&#8722; and NTf2&#8722;). The effects of chirality and counter anions on the packing structure and solid&#8208;state electronic properties were investigated. X&#8208;ray single&#8208;crystal analysis revealed that the SbCl6&#8722; anion was positioned above the midpoint of 1&#183;+ in both the racemic and enantiopure crystals of 1&#183;+&#183;SbCl6&#8722;. This alignment resulted from the matching between the curvature of 1&#183;+ and the spherical shape of the SbCl6&#8722; anion, preventing the formation of continuous &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions among 1&#183;+. In contrast, 1D &#960;&#8211;stacked columns of 1&#183;+ were present in both the racemic and enantiopure 1&#183;+&#183;NTf2&#8722; crystals, as the NTf2&#8722; anions encased the &#960;&#8208;stacked columns of 1&#183;+. All radical cation salts exhibited distinct melting points, and the enantiopure salts of 1&#183;+&#183;NTf2&#8722; had notably low melting points of 393&#8211;395 K, which was 142 K lower than that of rac&#8208;1&#183;+&#183;NTf2&#8722;. ESR and SQUID measurements of the enantiopure 1&#183;+&#183;NTf2&#8722; crystals revealed significant changes in their magnetic properties upon crystal melting. In contrast, rac&#8208;1&#183;+&#183;NTf2&#8722; displayed an unexpected crystal&#8211;crystal phase transition near room temperature, accompanied by a thermal hysteresis loop in its magnetic susceptibility.

         <title>Recent Developments in Heterogeneous Catalyzed Epoxidation of Ethylene to Ethylene Oxide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The epoxidation of ethylene to produce ethylene oxide is a vital heterogeneous catalytic chemical process in industry. In this review, we provide a systematical summary on the progress and achievements in ethylene epoxidation catalysis from a catalytic perspective along the development of structurally well&#8208;defined catalysts, with the target to present insights into providing guidance for the design of efficient and highly selective catalysts for heterogeneous epoxidation reactions, and to better understand their catalytic behaviors in a unified way.








Abstract
Epoxidation of ethylene to produce ethylene oxide (EO) is a vital heterogeneous catalytic chemical process in the industry, as EO is an important intermediate for the synthesis of fine chemicals including ethylene glycol, ethoxylates, plastics, and polyester. EO is commercially produced by the silver&#8208;catalyzed partial oxidation of ethylene with air or oxygen. However, it remains challenging to understand its chemical behavior under reaction conditions. To overcome this challenge, a series of catalysts with well&#8208;defined structures have been developed. The present review is devoted to summarizing the recent advances in the exploitation of novel catalytic materials for the epoxidation of ethylene, such as metal nanoparticles, clusters, single atoms, and bimetal. The role of promoters in selectivity enhancement will be discussed. A deep understanding of the active species, oxygen species, active structures, activity&#8208;structure relationship, and mechanisms contributing to the epoxidation process are highlighted. The integration with other advanced technologies such as electrocatalytic and photocatalytic is also reviewed. Finally, the current challenges and future prospects are provided so as to give guidance for the design of efficient catalysts for heterogeneous epoxidation of ethylene to EO, and to improve the fundamental understanding of the underlying catalytic chemistry.

         <title>Scrambled RGD Hexameric Peptide Hydrogel Supports Efficient Self&#8208;Assembly and Cell Activity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Self&#8208;assembled peptide hydrogels that incorporate bioactive motifs such as the integrin&#8208;binding epitope Arginine&#8208;Glycine&#8208;Aspartic acid (RGD), are known for supporting cell growth. Surprisingly, scrambling the peptide cell&#8208;adhesion motif RGD to RDG in an Fmoc&#8208;hexapeptide peptide gelator (Fmoc&#8208;GFFRGD) results in superior properties in terms of minimum gelation concentration and biocompatibility.








Abstract
The amino acid sequence is crucial in controlling peptide&#8208;based hydrogel formation, whereby changing the position of a single amino acid can significantly alter the gel's properties. Herein, we report the gelation kinetics and cell viability of scrFmoc&#8208;GFFRDG (where we have scrambled the RGD&#8208;based gel hexapeptide; Fmoc&#8208;GFFRGD). The scrambled sequence showed improved gelation properties compared to the original Fmoc&#8208;GFFRGD sequence, with scrFmoc&#8208;GFFRDG forming a gel in under 10 min, significantly faster than the 2&#8208;h gelation time, and at a concentration eight times lower than the original Fmoc&#8208;GFFRGD sequence. We also examined the combination of the two gelators in a ratio of 1:1, final concentration of 0.4% (w/v). Interestingly, the stiffness of the hybrid hydrogel was &#8764;3&#160;kPa, whereas individually, neither gelator at the same concentration exceeded 0.5&#160;kPa. The cell&#8208;adhesion motif RGD improves the ability of the peptides to promote attachment of cells due to integrin recognition. However, when fibroblasts were cultured on the hydrogels, scrFmoc&#8208;GFFRDG yielded a higher level of &#945;&#8208;SMA expression in cells than those cultured on Fmoc&#8208;GFFRGD, suggesting a microenvironment conducive to myofibroblast transitions. This study provides a new outlook on how a well&#8208;known scrambled peptide motif (RDG) can fine&#8208;tune hydrogel assembly and cell culture applications.

         <title>In Vitro Psilocybin Synthesis by Co&#8208;Immobilized Enzymes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The drug candidate and psychedelic mushroom product psilocybin was produced by multienzyme&#8208;charged beads in a biocatalytic cell&#8208;free approach. Using immobilized fungal indolethylamine biosynthetic and additional bacterial enzymes, these beads turned over 4&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;l&#8208;tryptophan to psilocybin. This approach circumvents the drawbacks of in vivo processes while harnessing the selectivity of enzymatic catalysis

Abstract
Advanced clinical trials investigate the Psilocybe magic mushroom natural product psilocybin as a treatment against major depressive disorder. Currently, synthetic material is used to meet the demand for legitimate pharmaceutical purposes. Here, we report an in vitro approach to biocatalytically produce psilocybin on a solid&#8208;phase matrix charged with five covalently bound biosynthetic enzymes. These enzymes include three Psilocybe enzymes: IasA*, an engineered l&#8208;tryptophan decarboxylase/aromatic aldehyde synthase, the 4&#8208;hydroxytryptamine kinase PsiK and the norbaeocystin methyltransferase PsiM, along with Escherichia coli nucleosidase MtnN and adenine deaminase Ade. In a proof&#8208;of&#8208;principle experiment, this enzyme&#8208;charged resin allowed for quantitative turnover of 4&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;l&#8208;tryptophan into psilocybin. This facile process i) represents a sustainable approach with reusable enzymes, ii) circumvents the drawbacks of in vivo processes while harnessing the selectivity of enzymatic catalysis and iii) helps access an urgently needed drug candidate.

         <title>Glycan Covalent Targeting Chimera&#8208;Based T&#8208;Cell Glycoengineering for Boosting Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A T&#8208;cell glycoengineering strategy based on glycan covalent targeting chimera (gcTAC) is developed to improve immunotherapy. The gcTAC has two orthogonal glycan covalent binding functions and can orchestrate a cascade of interventions in T&#8211;tumor and tumor&#8211;NK intercellular glycan recognition, thereby effectively enhancing the cytotoxic effect of T&#8211;NK cell combination immunotherapy.








Abstract
Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T&#8208;cell therapy is one of the most effective approaches in cancer immunotherapy. However, shortcomings such as loss of target antigens and poor infiltration remain in the treatment of solid tumors. Herein, we propose an approach to glycoengineer T cells based on glycan covalent targeting chimera (gcTAC), to enhance immunotherapy by modulating the glycan recognition behavior of T cells. We select hydrazide&#8208;modified phenylboronic acid (PBA) as gcTAC. The hydrazide group can covalently couple with the aldehyde group generated by the oxidation of galactose/N&#8208;acetylgalactosamine on the surface of T cells, while the PBA at the other end can specifically bind to sialic acids (Sia) of tumor cells, thereby enhancing the killing effect of T cells. At the same time, T cells covalently bound to tumor cells surfaces act as a blockade of Sia sites, which can disrupt the recognition between Siglec on natural killer (NK) cells and Sia on tumor cells, further enhancing the immune&#8208;killing effect of combined T&#8211;NK cell therapy. Our approach represents a novel concept to promote immune killing through cascading interventions in T&#8211;tumor and tumor&#8211;NK intercellular glycan recognition, thus providing a solution to the problem of immune escape in cancer therapy.

         <title>&#8220;Living Detergents&#8221;: an in Situ Detergent Tailoring Strategy for Efficient Membrane Protein Stabilization and Analysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Living detergents, distinct from traditional detergents, enable in situ modifications and thus refresh the physical properties for accommodating diverse membrane protein studies. This innovation is achieved through integrating functional tags into traditional detergents which allows bioorthogonal reactions with external structural elements to generate a versatile detergent library. Living detergents represent a flexible, robust platform for detergent customization, advancing the study of structure&#8208;function relationships

Abstract
Detergents are essential molecular tools for membrane protein (MP) research, yet traditional detergents with static properties often fail to address the diverse and evolving needs of MP studies. To this end, this study introduces &#8220;living detergents&#8221;, an innovative class of detergents equipped with functional tags that enable bioorthogonal modifications with externally introduced structural elements. This approach allows for not only the parallel generation of new detergents, but also in situ tuning of MP samples within freshly formed detergents. The efficacy of this strategy was demonstrated through the rapid identification of optimal detergents for high&#8208;quality electron microscopy studies of A2AAR. Overall, this flexible and robust platform enables efficient tailoring of detergents, advancing the exploration of detergent structure&#8208;function relationships in MP research and opening pathways for more specialized solutions for diverse experimental demands.

         <title>A Self&#8208;Sustaining Supramolecular (Auto)Photocatalysis via the Synthesis of N&#8208;Vinylacetamides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Efforts focus on enhancing photocatalyst accessibility and practicality. This study reports a self&#8208;assembled charge&#8208;transfer complex enabling green&#8208;light auto&#8208;photocatalysis. The process yields Z&#8208;selective products with 100% atom economy and minimal waste (E&#8208;factor 11.15). The product acts as its own photocatalyst, demonstrating a self&#8208;sustaining, efficient system aligned with green and sustainable chemistry principles.








Abstract
Efforts to enhance photocatalysts prioritize improving their accessibility and practicality in photocatalytic applications. Supramolecular (auto)photocatalysis, which exploits transient self&#8208;assembled complexes, facilitates visible light&#8208;driven reactions, with autocatalytic systems promoting sustainable and atom&#8208;economical processes. In this study, the photocatalyst Mes&#8208;Acr&#8208;MeClO4, typically active under blue light, formed a dark red charge&#8208;transfer (CT) complex with N&#8208;bromoacetamide (NBA) in the presence of K2CO3 in DCE, enabling green&#8208;light photocatalysis. This self&#8208;assembled CT complex initiated an auto&#8208;photocatalytic process via two&#8208;photon absorption, generating an N&#8208;centered radical that drove anti&#8208;Markovnikov, syn&#8208;periplanar addition to phenylacetylene, achieving exclusive Z&#8208;selective formation of (Z)&#8208;N&#8208;(2&#8208;bromo&#8208;2&#8208;phenylvinyl)acetamide. Interestingly, the product itself functioned as a potent green&#8208;LED photocatalyst (&#955;em = 518&#160;nm, &#964; = 10&#160;ns), driving its own synthesis with added terminal alkynes. With 100% atom economy, this work highlights a system chemistry approach, showcasing a highly efficient, self&#8208;sustaining catalytic process that advances green and sustainable synthetic strategies. This protocol emphasizes sustainability with an outstanding E&#8208;factor of 11.15, reflecting minimal waste production (11.15&#160;kg per 1&#160;kg of product) and demonstrating a strong commitment to green chemistry principles.

         <title>A Lewis Base&#8208;Free Trialumane: Enhanced Electrophilicity Based on Consecutive Vacant Orbitals Over Three Aluminum Atoms</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Lewis base&#8208;free trialumane possessing a 2,4,6&#8208;triisopropylphenyl (Tip) substituent was synthesized by the reaction of alumanyl anion with TipAlBr2. The structure, bonding, and electronic properties of the Tip&#8208;substituted trialumane were analyzed by NMR spectra, scXRD, DFT calculations, XPS, and electrochemical study. Chemical reduction of Tip&#8208;substituted trialumane gave a series of alumanyl anions, showing a low&#8208;lying characteristic LUMO that consists of vacant orbitals of three Al atoms.

The structure, bonding, and electronic properties of the Tip&#8208;substituted trialumane were estimated by NMR spectra, X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis, DFT calculations, X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectra, and electrochemical study to reveal its two consecutive Al&#9472;Al covalent bonds and overlapped vacant orbitals of three Al atoms.

         <title>Research Progress of Polyacrylate Binders for Silicon&#8208;Based Anodes in Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The paper presents a comprehensive review of recently developed polyacrylic acid (PAA)&#8208;based adhesives in linear, branched, and 3D&#8208;network types. In&#8208;depth insights are offered to elucidate the mechanisms by which these structural modifications augment the properties of the binders and the performance of the cells. The prospective directions for the evolution of PAA&#8208;based binders designed for Si&#8208;based anodes in high&#8208;energy&#8208;density lithium&#8208;ion batteries are deliberated.








Abstract
Silicon (Si) has emerged as a preeminent candidate for next&#8208;generation lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) anodes, primarily attributed to its exceptionally high specific capacity. Nevertheless, the substantial volumetric expansion accompanying lithium alloying reactions has long posed a critical challenge to the commercial viability of silicon&#8208;based anodes. Binders as connectors between the active Si particles, conductive agents, and current collectors, playing a crucial role in stabilizing the structure of silicon anodes in LIBs. Polyacrylic acid (PAA) water&#8208;based binders contain abundant carboxyl groups (&#9472;COOH) that can enhance adhesive strength. However, simple linear PAA does not adequately accommodate the significant volume expansion of silicon anodes. To address this issue, various structural optimization strategies have been applied to modify PAA binders. In this context, a comprehensive review is conducted on the recently developed PAA&#8208;based binders, which cover linear, branched, and 3D network configurations. A meticulous comparison is carried out regarding their initial coulombic efficiency, areal capacity, and material costs. Moreover, in&#8208;depth insights are offered to elucidate the mechanisms by which these structural modifications augment the properties of the binders and the performance of the cells. Ultimately, the prospective directions for the evolution of PAA&#8208;based binders designed for Si&#8208;based anodes in high&#8208;energy&#8208;density LIBs are deliberated.

         <dc:description>
Two azadiene&#8208;linked COFs were successfully constructed for the first time. The new materials possess inherent porosity, high crystallinity, and were found to be superior heterogeneous photocatalysts with excellent reusability for selective oxidation of sulfides and phenylboronic acids.








Abstract
2D covalent organic frameworks (2D&#8208;COFs) have garnered huge attention as a promising platform for solar to chemical energy conversion. In this work, two novel azadiene&#8208;linked COFs (COF&#8208;JLU236 and COF&#8208;JLU237) were designed and successfully synthesized under solvothermal conditions for the first time. And new materials have high crystallinity, large surface area, good durability, and broad absorption range, as well as excellent photoelectric properties. Importantly, they can effectively induce selective oxidation of sulfides and phenylboronic acids under visible light, and show wide substrate adaptability and superior reusability.

         <title>Reversible Quinoid&#8208;Diradical Inter&#8208;Conversion in Single&#8208;Molecule Junctions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study demonstrates acid/base&#8208;triggered reversible quinoid&#8208;diradical interconversion in oligo&#8208;aniline (O&#8208;ANI) at the single&#8208;molecule level. Scanning tunneling microscopy break junction (STM&#8208;BJ) measurements reveal a 6.5&#8208;fold conductance switching behavior, accompanied by exceptional environmental stability. The distinct redox&#8208;state&#8208;dependent electron transport characteristics suggest potential applications in electrically tunable molecular switches and adaptive nanoelectronic systems.








Abstract
A profound understanding of the reversible regulation mechanisms among multiple redox states of organic molecules is essential for further development of molecular switching devices. In this study, an oligo&#8208;aniline derived quinoidal molecular wire was designed and synthesized. The reversible inter&#8208;conversion processes between its initial (quinoid) and protonated (diradical) states were comprehensively investigated with optical measurements, and the EPR experiments confirmed the formation of radical species upon protonation. The single&#8208;molecule charge transport properties were then investigated using scanning tunneling microscopy break junction (STM&#8208;BJ) technique. It was found that the molecular wire O&#8208;ANI can serve as a reversible molecular switching process with &#8776; 6.5&#8208;fold conductance variation through acid/base adjustments. Additionally, theoretical analyses elucidated the mechanism of the quinoid&#8208;diradical inter&#8208;conversion. The enhanced comprehension of the reversible quinoid&#8208;diradical inter&#8208;conversion at the single&#8208;molecule level provides new strategies for advancing the molecular switching materials and devices.

         <title>Ammoxidation of Unprotected Glycosides: A One&#8208;Pot Conversion of Alcohols to Nitriles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Efficient C5&#8208;selective ammoxidation of minimally protected carbohydrates enables direct access to nitrile sugars, valuable in bioorthogonal chemistry and drug development. Using TEMPO, PIDA, and ammonium acetate in aqueous acetonitrile, this method offers high selectivity without protecting groups. Mechanistic insights reveal iminoiodinane intermediates, explaining the reaction's remarkable precision.








Abstract
Functionalized carbohydrates are important in various fields, but protection&#8208;free selective functionalization often remains challenging. We demonstrate that the primary hydroxy group in minimally protected carbohydrates can be directly converted into a nitrile group with TEMPO, PIDA, and ammonium acetate. Both nitrile hexopyranoses and nitrile pentofuranoses are obtained and subsequent derivatizations of the nitrile group to other versatile functional groups are demonstrated. Combined evidence from literature and in&#8208;situ reaction progress monitoring with Raman spectroscopy led to the proposal that iminoiodinanes derived from PIDA play an important role in the mechanism of ammoxidation.

         <title>Modular Synthesis of Arylpyridylmethylamines via Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Driven Reductive Coupling of Amines, Aldehydes, and Pyridines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple and modular photochemical method for the selective coupling of abundant and readily accessible amine, aldehyde, and pyridine feedstocks to access valuable arylpyridylmethylamines was achieved under mild conditions without the requirement of any transition&#8208;metal catalysts, photocatalysts, and acid additives. This multicomponent reaction features a broad substrate scope and high functional&#8208;group compatibility, and is amenable to one&#8208;pot large&#8208;scale synthesis and late&#8208;stage&#8208;functionalizations.








Abstract
The arylpyridylmethylamine motif is a privileged scaffold in drug discovery. However, rapidly creating these valuable molecules with structural diversity by directly leveraging readily available, yet simple chemical feedstocks remains a challenge. Herein, we describe a versatile and modular photochemical method for the straightforward construction of arylpyridylmethylamine skeleton utilizing widely accessible starting materials, including amines, aldehydes, and pyridines. This multicomponent coupling proceeds under very mild conditions without the need for any transition&#8208;metal catalysts, photocatalysts, and acid additives and displays a broad substrate scope and excellent functional&#8208;group tolerance. The potential utility of this methodology in pharmaceutical development is demonstrated through late&#8208;stage modification of pharmaceutically relevant compounds, concise synthesis of bioactive compounds, and rapid construction of pyridyl analogue of drug molecules. Combined experimental and computational studies unveiled that this reaction proceeds through radical&#8208;radical cross&#8208;coupling between persistent pyridylphosphonium radicals and &#945;&#8208;amino radicals.

         <title>Chemical Protein Engineering: Backbone Cyclization Rescues Folding of a 183&#8208;Residue Truncated Domain of Malaria Parasite Protein PfAMA1</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report the first chemical synthesis of a 183&#8208;residue functional truncated cyclic PfAMA1 domain I protein using multi&#8208;segment native chemical ligation and head&#8208;to&#8208;tail cyclization to introduce conformational constraints, thereby facilitating protein folding and providing novel strategies for miniature protein engineering.

Abstract
The interaction between apical membrane antigen 1 (PfAMA1) and rhoptry neck protein 2 (PfRON2) is crucial for Plasmodium falciparum red blood cell invasion, making it a key target for anti&#8208;malarial drug development strategies. Here, we report the chemical synthesis of PfAMA1 domain I (PfAMA1&#8208;DI) in both linear and backbone&#8208;circularized forms, employing a six&#8208;segment convergent synthesis approach exploiting one&#8208;pot chemistries and solubilizing tags. The chemically synthesized linear PfAMA1&#8208;DI construct exhibited incomplete disulfide bond formation during folding, likely due to increased terminal flexibility in the absence of domain II. To address this, we employed backbone cyclization of the large 180&#8208;residue polypeptide chain, with 3&#8208;residue linker sequence, as a unique strategy to conformationally restrict its termini and facilitate correct disulfide bond formation. Introducing a multipurpose affinity and solubility tag to the cyclicPfAMA1&#8208;DI construct further improved the folding yield by mitigating aggregation. The predicted structure using ColabFold&#8208;Alphafold2 indicated that PfRON2 ligand binds within the hydrophobic groove of the cyclicPfAMA1&#8208;DI construct similar to the native interactions. These findings underscore the potential of large protein backbone cyclization to stabilize protein structure, offering a compelling strategy for the chemical synthesis of otherwise unstable protein domains with broad applications in miniature protein engineering.

         <title>Multifunctional Gold Super&#8208;Nanoparticle&#8208;Based Nanosystem for SERS&#8208;Guided Oxygen&#8208;Independent Phototherapy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel gold superlattice nanosystem (GSPs1,4&#8208;BDT@PDA&#8208;AIPH&#8208;cRGD) enables SERS&#8208;guided oxygen&#8208;independent photothermal/free radical synergistic therapy for tumor ablation. Integrating diagnosis and real&#8208;time monitoring, it overcomes the limitations of conventional therapies via localized hyperthermia, oxygen&#8208;independent cytotoxicity, and tunable surface plasmon resonance, offering a precise theranostic platform for cancer management.








Abstract
Cancer treatment remains a formidable challenge due to the complex and hypoxic microenvironment of tumors, which often compromises therapeutic efficacy. To address this issue, a multifunctional gold super&#8208;nanoparticle&#8208;based nanosystem (GSPs1,4&#8208;BDT@PDA&#8208;AIPH&#8208;cRGD) was developed for surface&#8208;enhanced Raman scattering (SERS)&#8208;guided oxygen&#8208;independent phototherapy. This nanosystem integrates diagnostic and therapeutic functionalities through a gold superlattice&#8208;nanoparticle (GSP) core self&#8208;assembled from 5.8&#160;nm gold nanoparticles (GNPs), functionalized with 1,4&#8208;benzenedithiol (1,4&#8208;BDT) as a Raman reporter. The GSPs are encapsulated with a polydopamine (PDA) shell for enhancing their structural stability, Raman signal amplification, and serving as a photothermal agent. The PDA coating layer is further loaded with 2,2&#8242;&#8208;azobis[2&#8208;(2&#8208;imidazolin&#8208;2&#8208;yl) propane] dihydrochloride (AIPH), an oxygen&#8208;independent photosensitizer that releases cytotoxic free radicals, and cyclic arginine&#8208;glycine&#8208;aspartic acid (cRGD) peptide for tumor targeting. Under near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light irradiation, the nanosystem generates hyperthermia and releases free radicals, achieving oxygen&#8208;independent tumor ablation. Real&#8208;time SERS imaging ensures precise tumor monitoring, addressing key challenges in cancer management. This novel approach combines the benefits of highly sensitive SERS imaging, targeted drug delivery, and oxygen&#8208;independent phototherapy, providing a robust platform for synergistic cancer diagnosis and treatment with significant therapeutic potential.

         <title>Preassembly&#8208;Controlled Radical Recombination at Bismuth: Decarboxylative C&#9472;N Coupling with Sulfonamides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Radical processes involving bismuth hold great potential, but innovative strategies are required to control the reactivity of bismuth intermediates. Herein, we report a direct photochemical decarboxylation with molecular bismuth for C&#9472;N coupling of benzylic carboxylic acids and sulfonamides. While highly reactive and hard&#8208;to&#8208;control bismuth radicals are formed, preassembly exerts control over the reaction outcome.








Abstract
Persistent transition metal radicals form the foundation for many metallaphotoredox protocols. Their ability to efficiently trap organic radicals and convert them into various coupling products has inspired the exploration of selective radical reactions even beyond the d&#8208;block. Radical processes involving bismuth hold great potential, but innovative strategies are required to control the reactivity of bismuth intermediates. Herein, we report preassembly as a powerful strategy to enforce a selective recombination of a bismuth(II) radical and an organic radical. As a result, an inner&#8208;sphere pathway is accessed, enabling the formation of C&#9472;N coupling products.

         <title>Optimization of Steroid Photochemistry and Its Application in the Synthesis of 5,6&#8208;Dihydro&#8208;Ophiopogonol A</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Steroid photoreactivity was a major topic in the last century. This study revisits it by exploring the photochemistry of &#916;1&#8208;keto&#8208;steroids, offering an efficient method to modify the classic steroid 6/6/6/5 ring system. This approach enables the transformation of accessible steroids into rare ones, demonstrated by synthesizing 5,6&#8208;dihydro&#8208;ophiopogonol A in four steps from diosgenin.








Abstract
The photoreactivity of steroids represented a hot topic in the middle of the last century and in this project, we &#8220;rediscover&#8221; it through the exploration of the photochemical behavior of &#916;1&#8208;3&#8208;keto&#8208;steroids. In terms of number of products obtained, the photochemistry of &#916;1&#8208;3&#8208;keto&#8208;steroids is less complicated than that of &#916;4&#8208;3&#8208;keto&#8208; and &#916;1,4&#8208;3&#8208;keto&#8208;steroids, furnishing an efficient and tunable method to remodel the classic steroid 6/6/6/5 ring system. In this scenario, this approach can represent a simple strategy to interconvert a class of easily available steroids to another difficult&#8208;to&#8208;access from natural sources. As a proof of concept, the synthesis 5,6&#8208;dihydro&#8208;ophiopogonol A (11), a very close analog of natural ophiopogonol A (7), was accomplished in just four steps starting from easily available diosgenin (8).

         <title>Immunological and Toxicological Assessment of Triterpenoid Saponins Bearing Lewis&#8208;X&#8208; and QS&#8208;21&#8208;Based Trisaccharides</title>

The synthesis of betulinic acid and echinocystic acid saponins featuring QS&#8208;21 minimal immunogenic motif is reported. These chimeric saponins, together with previously synthesized Lewis&#8208;X&#8208;containing triterpenoid saponins and a rhamnose&#8208;modified saponin, were assessed for their toxicological and immunological profiles in wild&#8208;type and/or hDC&#8208;SIGN transgenic mice. Researcher X username: @charlogauthier








Abstract
The search for safer and more effective vaccine adjuvants has intensified in recent years, with triterpenoid saponins like QS&#8208;21 and its analogues emerging as promising candidates. We report the synthesis of a novel QS&#8208;21 analogue featuring betulinic acid as aglycone, a lupane&#8208;type triterpenoid with low toxicity derived from white birch bark. Two convergent synthetic routes, involving different protecting groups and glycosyl donors (bromide and trichloroacetimidate), were optimized to construct the QS&#8208;21&#8208;based linear trisaccharide motif critical for adjuvant activity. This strategy also enabled efficient preparation of the structurally similar echinocystic acid analogue reported by Gin. The immunological and toxicological profiles of these chimeric saponins, along with Lewis&#8208;X&#8208;containing and rhamnose&#8208;modified derivatives, were evaluated in C57BL/6 wild&#8208;type and hDC&#8208;SIGN transgenic mice. While the synthetic saponins exhibited low toxicity in vitro and in vivo, replacing echinocystic acid with betulinic acid reduced immunogenicity when tested with ovalbumin as a model antigen compared to alhydrogel and QS&#8208;21. These findings provide a foundation for developing saponin&#8208;based adjuvants and demonstrate the utility of advanced glycosylation strategies for synthesizing complex unnatural triterpenoid saponins.

While the synthetic saponins exhibited low toxicity in vitro and in vivo, replacing echinocystic acid with betulinic acid reduced immunogenicity when tested with ovalbumin as a model antigen compared to alhydrogel and QS-21. These findings provide a foundation for developing saponin-based adjuvants and demonstrate the utility of advanced glycosylation strategies for synthesizing complex unnatural triterpenoid saponins.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

2&#8208;(Trifluoromethyl)&#8208;1&#8208;azabicyclo[1.1.0]butanes, available by diastereoselective cyclopropanation of 2&#8208;(trifluoromethyl)&#8208;2H&#8208;azirines, can be successfully involved in strain&#8208;release ring&#8208;opening processes, as illustrated by their reaction with benzyl chloroformate, trifluoroacetic anhydride or palladium&#8208;catalyzed hydrogenolysis. These latter transformations allow access to diversely substituted 2&#8208;(trifluoromethyl)azetidines which constitute scaffolds of potential interest in medicinal chemistry.








Abstract
Substituted azetidines are privileged heterocyclic scaffolds in medicinal chemistry and have become synthetic targets of high interest in recent years. With the goal of developing a new access to azetidines incorporating the pharmaceutically relevant trifluoromethyl group, the reactivity of 2&#8208;(trifluoromethyl)&#8208;1&#8208;azabicyclo[1.1.0]butanes was investigated in polar strain&#8208;release reactions. By using benzyl chloroformate or trifluoroacetic anhydride as reacting partners, diversely substituted 3&#8208;chloroazetidines, 3&#8208;substituted azetidines and azetidin&#8208;3&#8208;ols bearing a trifluoromethyl group at C2 could be readily synthesized. In addition, palladium&#8208;catalyzed hydrogenolysis reactions provided an entry to cis&#8208;3&#8208;aryl&#8208;2&#8208;trifluoromethyl azetidines.

         <title>Photoredox&#8208;Catalyzed Hydroalkylation of C(sp3)&#8211;H Acids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two versatile photoredox catalysis platforms were developed to engage C(sp3)&#8211;H acids in hydroalkylations, cross&#8208;couplings, and oxidative cyclizations. Extensive synthetic and mechanistic investigations demonstrate a complementarity between the activation mechanisms of these two systems.








Abstract
We present a detailed study on a photoredox catalysis platform that directly engages 1,3&#8208;dicarbonyl C(sp3)&#8211;H acids toward radical reactions. This platform enables redox&#8208;neutral hydroalkylation and cross&#8208;coupling, as well as oxidative transformations that demonstrably improve on the prior state of the art. Herein, we present interrogations of the underlying catalytic cycle and mechanism for this platform through kinetic, thermodynamic, and computational studies. The present investigations also demonstrate the key role of lithium trifluoroacetate under complementary Ce&#8208;containing and Ce&#8208;free photoredox conditions to enable ligand&#8208;to&#8208;metal charge transfer (LMCT) or multi&#8208;site proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (MS&#8208;PCET) activations, respectively.

         <title>Utilization of a Chelating Bis[(dialkylamino)cyclopropenimine] to Isolate a Series of Heavier Zero&#8208;Valent Group 14 Tetracarbonyl Iron Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The bis&#8208;cyclopropenimine ligand was used to isolate tetracarbonyl iron&#8208;stabilized tetrylones (Ge0, Sn0, Pb0). The strong donating abilities of tetrylones were further proven by reaction with Fe(CO)5 and Fe2(CO)9 to access the bis&#8208;Fe(CO)4 complexes. The complexes were structurally characterized by NMR&#8208; and M&#246;ssbauer spectroscopy and X&#8208;ray crystallography, and their bonding situations were investigated computationally using density functional theory.








Abstract
We report on the utilization of the ethylene&#8208;bridged bis[(dialkylamino)cyclopropenimine] (bisCPI) ligand, LCPI, to give access to new main&#8208;group E(II) halide complexes (E = Ge, Sn, Pb; 1, 2, 3). Subsequent reduction with Collman's reagent (Na2Fe(CO)4&#160;&#8226;&#160;dioxane) enables the isolation of a series of zero&#8208;valent tetrylone&#8208;tetracarbonyl iron complexes, (LCPI)E(Fe(CO)4 (E = Ge (4), Sn (5), Pb (6)). Compounds 4 &#8211; 6 were reacted further with iron pentacarbonyl to yield the bis&#8208;tetracarbonyl iron complexes (LCPI)E[(Fe(CO)4]2 (E = Ge (7), Sn (8), Pb (9)). The electronic structure of these complexes was studied by 57Fe M&#246;ssbauer spectroscopy and computationally by density functional theory calculations.

         <title>Odd&#8211;Even Effects Leading to Alternating Polymerization and Macrocyclization in Nitroaldol Reaction Systems</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dynamic nitroaldol reactions lead to alternating macrocyclization and polymerization. Aromatic dialdehydes with even&#8208;carbon dinitroalkanes form lowellane macrocycles, while odd&#8208;carbon dinitrocompounds promote polymerization. The alkyl chain folding patterns appear to significantly influence the reaction outcomes.








Abstract
Alternating macrocyclization and polymerization was observed in dynamic nitroaldol reaction systems. The reaction of an aromatic dialdehyde reacting with linear &#945;,&#969;&#8208;dinitroalkanes with even numbers of carbon atoms favored the formation of lowellane macrocycles, while the reactions involving dinitrocompounds consisted of odd numbers of carbon atoms promoted polymerization. The folding patterns of the alkyl chains played an important factor in determining the outcome of the reactions.

         <title>Homogeneous Coating of Al&#8208;Doped Spinel Oxides on Ni Mesh for Efficient Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The immersion&#8208;infrared drying&#8208;calcination method enables scale&#8208;up preparation and maintains homogeneity for the NiAl0.5Co1.5O4 electrode, which exhibits superior performance for oxygen evolution reaction. The Al doping modulates the intrinsic electronic configuration and induces metal&#8208;oxygen bond contraction to improve the electrochemical performance.








Abstract
Industrial alkaline water electrolysis requires a catalyst electrode with high alkaline resistance and scalability due to the high alkaline concentration, frequent gas desorption, and high hydrogen production power involved. However, most high&#8208;performance oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts are poorly adhered to conductive substrates, such as nickel foam or carbon paper, leading to detachment and performance degradation under harsh industrial conditions. Here, we report a simple and scalable strategy of &#8220;immersion&#8208;infrared drying&#8208;calcination&#8221; to fabricate Al&#8208;doped spinel oxides in situ grown on mechanically robust Ni mesh. By further simple cation substitution, we effectively modulate the metal&#8208;oxygen bond length in the octahedral center and the valence state of active sites, significantly enhancing OER activity. Electrochemical tests (1 M KOH, 25&#176;C) show that NiAl0.5Co1.5O4 exhibits excellent performance with an overpotential of 234&#160;mV at a current density of 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. Remarkably, under industrial conditions (6 M KOH, 60&#176;C), it achieves an overpotential of only 448&#160;mV at a current density of 400&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2, which is superior to that of commercial Raney Ni catalysts. Moreover, the scalable electrode demonstrates excellent resistance to concentrated alkaline solutions and high current densities.

However, most high-performance oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts are poorly adhered to conductive substrates, such as nickel foam or carbon paper, leading to detachment and performance degradation under harsh industrial conditions. Here, we report a simple and scalable strategy of &#8220;immersion-infrared drying-calcination&#8221; to fabricate Al-doped spinel oxides in situ grown on mechanically robust Ni mesh. By further simple cation substitution, we effectively modulate the metal-oxygen bond length in the octahedral center and the valence state of active sites, significantly enhancing OER activity. Electrochemical tests (1 M KOH, 25&#176;C) show that NiAl&lt;sub&gt;0.5&lt;/sub&gt;Co&lt;sub&gt;1.5&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; exhibits excellent performance with an overpotential of 234&#160;mV at a current density of 10&#160;mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Remarkably, under industrial conditions (6 M KOH, 60&#176;C), it achieves an overpotential of only 448&#160;mV at a current density of 400&#160;mA&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, which is superior to that of commercial Raney Ni catalysts. Moreover, the scalable electrode demonstrates excellent resistance to concentrated alkaline solutions and high current densities.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Structural Insights Into Amyloid Polymorphism: The Impact of Glutamine to Norleucine Substitutions in GNNQQNY Aggregation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In the wild&#8208;type GNNQQNY, self&#8208;assembly is extremely fast and many intermediate structures are masked. By studying the selectively disrupted hydrogen&#8208;bonding variants, the data show that GNNQNleNY stabilizes at the protofibril stage, GNNQNleNY progresses to achiral nanocrystals and GNNNleQNY evolves to twisted chiral fibers. By mapping the key forces driving amyloid stability and polymorphism, the results pave the way for future applications in biotechnology, nanomedicine, and amyloid&#8208;based therapeutics.








Abstract
Polypeptides can self&#8208;assemble into highly organized amyloid structures through complex and poorly understood mechanisms. To better understand the key parameters governing amyloidogenesis, we investigated the aggregation of the Sup35 prion&#8208;derived GNNQQNY sequence alongside two rationally designed mutants, glutamine to norleucine in the 4th or 5th position, where selective removal of hydrogen bonding capacity reduces amyloid structural stability. Our findings reveal that &#946;&#8208;sheet arrays form rapidly as an initial step, followed by &#960;&#8211;&#960; aromatic interactions between Tyr residues, which drive hierarchical self&#8208;assembly into 3D fibrillar structures via hydrophobic zippers and partial water exclusion. As the oligomers grow, they also acquire twist and chirality at the protofilament level, with Tyr ladders serving as key interaction surfaces that dictate the final amyloid architecture. These ladders guide protofibrils to assemble into either oppositely twisted chiral fibers or achiral nanocrystals, contributing to amyloid polymorphism. The emergence of distinct polymorphs is influenced by multiple factors, including fibril twisting, side&#8208;chain interactions, solvent exclusion, and local microenvironmental conditions. Our study provides crucial insights into the hierarchical nature of amyloid self&#8208;assembly and highlights the structural adaptability of amyloid fibrils, which is essential for designing functional amyloids and understanding the pathogenicity of disease&#8208;associated aggregates.

         <title>Molecular Dynamics of High&#8208;Pressure Liquid Water: Going from Ambient to Near&#8208;Critical Temperatures</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The properties of liquid water were investigated along the isobar of 25&#160;MPa from ambient to near&#8208;critical temperatures, using molecular dynamics simulations. Noticeable changes in the shape of the radial distribution functions, in several structural order parameters and entropic quantities, as well as in the reorientational and HB dynamics were observed around 423.15 K and 498.15 K.








Abstract
The properties of high&#8208;pressure liquid water were investigated along the isobar of 25&#160;MPa and in the temperature range 298.15&#8208;623.15 K using classical molecular dynamics simulations. Particular attention has been given to the changes in the local structural and related dynamic properties of liquid water. The results obtained have revealed noticeable changes in the shape of the calculated radial distribution functions, as well as the existence of local extrema or crossovers in several structural descriptors and entropic quantities at temperatures around 423.15 K and 498.15 K, where also significant changes in the hydrogen bond network of liquid water have also been observed. The temperature dependence of translational, reorientational, and hydrogen bond dynamics of liquid water has also been investigated by calculating the translational self&#8208;diffusion and the corresponding O&#8208;H vector Legendre reorientational correlation times and hydrogen bond lifetimes. The corresponding activation energies for each investigated relaxation process have also been presented and discussed.

         <title>Room&#8208;Temperature Inversion of Phosphorescence and Fluorescence Emission Triggered in Twisted Dimeric Structures Displaying Excitonic Coupling</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The investigation of intramolecular excitonic coupling in dimeric luminescent structures revealed an inversion of phosphorescence and fluorescence emission in semi&#8208;rigid matrices for the compound with strong charge&#8208;transfer character.








Abstract
We here report the design of new thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters based on a dimeric binaphthalimide structure, which induces a small singlet&#8208;triplet energy gap. The impact of dimerization and the resulting intramolecular exciton effect are highlighted through comparisons with monomeric variants. Additionally, we studied the influence of the acceptor strength, alongside global electronic effects&#8212;such as exciton coupling and charge resonance&#8212;induced by the donor/acceptor/acceptor/donor (DAAD) configurations. These effects led to the energetic merging, and even inversion, of the phosphorescence and fluorescence spectra in semi&#8208;rigid matrices, including room&#8208;temperature polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) thin films, compromising the TADF response initially enhanced in fluidic environments.

         <title>Dissecting the Diverse Reactivity of &#946;&#8208;Diketiminate Aluminum(I) Compound towards Azaarenes: Insight From DFT Calculations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
DFT calculations were performed to elucidate the reaction mechanisms of NacNacAl(I) with five structurally similar azaarenes. The monocyclic azaarenes form key adducts with NacNacAl(I) and yield three different products mainly due to electronic effects of their substituents, whereas the bicyclic azaarenes form key biradicals with NacNacAl(I) and undergo C&#9472;C coupling after intermolecular coordination or N&#9472;N bond cleavage after intramolecular coordination.








Abstract
Interest in aluminum(I) complexes has surged in recent decades due to the unusual role of electropositive aluminum as donor atoms in ligands. Numerous Al(I) complexes, which were previously considered too unstable, have been isolated. Among these, &#946;&#8208;diketiminate aluminum(I) complex, NacNacAl(I), stands out for its unique reactivities including oxidative addition and &#960;&#8208;bond activation. However, the understanding of reactions involving NacNacAl(I) has not yet been fully established. This study unveils the mechanisms behind the diverse reactivity of NacNacAl(I) with five structurally similar azaarenes through DFT calculations. Interestingly, computational results indicate that some of the five reactions can proceed via radical processes. A holistic comparison of all results highlights the mechanistic differences between monocyclic and bicyclic azaarenes. In the initial step with NacNacAl(I), monocyclic azaarenes form Al(I)&#8208;azaarene adducts, whereas bicyclic azaarenes generate Al(II)&#8208;azaarene biradicals. These intermediates are critical for understanding their distinctive reactivity. For monocyclic azaarenes, electronic effects of their substituents on the azaarene adducts result in varying reaction outcomes, while for bicyclic azaarenes, subsequent intermolecular or intramolecular coordination of biradicals leads to different products. This study provides deeper mechanistic insights into reactions associated with NacNacAl(I) complexes, thereby contributing to a more comprehensive understanding of these reactions.

         <title>Anisotropic Thermal Expansion of an Adaptive Ni Metal&#8208;Organic Framework with 1D Helical Chains</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The 3D [Ni(L&#8208;cam)(4,4&#8242;&#8208;bpe)]n with 1D helical chains exhibits a highly anisotropic thermal expansion behavior, which is associated with the spring&#8208;like stretching thermal motion of the 1D helical chains and the lateral thermal vibrations of bpe. This study deepens our comprehension of the NTE of 3D MOFs and offers new strategies for the molecular design of novel NTE materials.








Abstract
Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) are gradually becoming an ideal platform for investigating negative thermal expansion (NTE) owing to their designability and framework flexibility. In this work, we studied the thermal expansion (TE) phenomenon of the orthorhombic [Ni(L&#8208;cam)(4,4&#8242;&#8208;bpe)]n (L&#8208;cam = L&#8208;camphoric acid and 4,4&#8242;&#8208;bpe = 4,4&#8242;&#8208;vinylenedipyridine) with 1D helical chains through thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), variable&#8208;temperature powder X&#8208;ray diffraction (VT&#8208;PXRD), and variable&#8208;temperature single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (VT&#8208;SCXRD). The synergistic effect of the lateral thermal vibrations of bpe and the spring&#8208;like stretching thermal motion elucidated the mechanism of NTE along the c&#8208;axis. The positive thermal expansion (PTE) along the b&#8208;axis can be attributed to the spring&#8208;like stretching thermal motion of the helical chains. The a&#8208;axis was nearly unchanged, exhibiting zero thermal expansion (ZTE). The PTE happened in the unit cell volume due to the larger deformation along the b&#8208;axis compared to the c&#8208;axis.

     alt="Anisotropic Thermal Expansion of an Adaptive Ni Metal-Organic Framework with 1D Helical Chains"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 3D [Ni(&lt;i&gt;L&lt;/i&gt;-cam)(4,4&#8242;-bpe)]&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; with 1D helical chains exhibits a highly anisotropic thermal expansion behavior, which is associated with the spring-like stretching thermal motion of the 1D helical chains and the lateral thermal vibrations of bpe. This study deepens our comprehension of the NTE of 3D MOFs and offers new strategies for the molecular design of novel NTE materials.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are gradually becoming an ideal platform for investigating negative thermal expansion (NTE) owing to their designability and framework flexibility. In this work, we studied the thermal expansion (TE) phenomenon of the orthorhombic [Ni(&lt;i&gt;L&lt;/i&gt;-cam)(4,4&#8242;-bpe)]&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; (&lt;i&gt;L&lt;/i&gt;-cam = &lt;i&gt;L&lt;/i&gt;-camphoric acid and 4,4&#8242;-bpe = 4,4&#8242;-vinylenedipyridine) with 1D helical chains through thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), variable-temperature powder X-ray diffraction (VT-PXRD), and variable-temperature single-crystal X-ray diffraction (VT-SCXRD). The synergistic effect of the lateral thermal vibrations of bpe and the spring-like stretching thermal motion elucidated the mechanism of NTE along the &lt;i&gt;c&lt;/i&gt;-axis. The positive thermal expansion (PTE) along the &lt;i&gt;b&lt;/i&gt;-axis can be attributed to the spring-like stretching thermal motion of the helical chains. The &lt;i&gt;a&lt;/i&gt;-axis was nearly unchanged, exhibiting zero thermal expansion (ZTE). The PTE happened in the unit cell volume due to the larger deformation along the &lt;i&gt;b&lt;/i&gt;-axis compared to the &lt;i&gt;c&lt;/i&gt;-axis. This study deepens our comprehension of the NTE of 3D MOFs and provides a point of view for the design and synthesis in the development and investigation of other NTE materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>&#945;&#8208;Iminonitrile&#8208;Linked Covalent Organic Framework Synthesized by Ehrlich&#8211;Sachs Reaction as a Promising Cathode for Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An &#945;&#8208;iminonitrile&#8208;linked COF (CityU&#8208;48) was prepared through a classic Ehrlich&#8211;Sachs reaction. When employed as a cathode material in sodium&#8208;ion batteries, CityU&#8208;48 delivered a discharge capacity of 139 mAh g&#8722;1 at the current density of 100&#160;mA g&#8722;1.








Abstract
Linkages represent the key feature to affect the properties of covalent organic frameworks (COFs), where chemical perturbation on the linkage microenvironment often leads to a remarkable impact on their applications. Following this strategy, we directly functionalized the imine linkage with a cyano group to form an &#945;&#8208;iminonitrile&#8208;linked COF (CityU&#8208;48) by employing a classic Ehrlich&#8211;Sachs reaction between tris&#8208;(4&#8208;nitrosophenyl) amine (TPA&#8208;3NO) and 1,4&#8208;phenylenediacetonitrile (Ph&#8208;2CN). However, this perturbation makes CityU&#8208;48 susceptible to crystallization due to the steric hindrance and polarity induced by extra cyano groups. By taking advantage of the bipolar redox&#8208;active nature, CityU&#8208;48 delivered a discharge capacity of 139 mAh g&#8722;1 at the current density of 100&#160;mA g&#8722;1 when employed as a cathode in sodium&#8208;ion batteries. These research efforts motivate the design of new linkages to explore their roles in COFs at the atomic level.

         <title>Supramolecular Matter Through Crystal Engineering: Covalent Bond Formation to Postsynthetic Modification</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Supramolecular chemistry provides possibilities in organic synthesis by harnessing dynamic environments of crystalline solids for controlled covalent bond formation, highlighting potential as a form of supramolecular matter for precise molecular synthesis. This review explores supramolecular control of molecular orientation, template&#8208;directed reactivity, and postsynthetic modifications to expand functional diversity and enable transformations to generate molecules in solids that are unattainable in solution.








Abstract
Supramolecular chemistry can transform organic synthesis by revealing that crystalline materials are not static but rather dynamic environments for controlled covalent bond formations and manipulations. This review focuses on how supramolecular chemistry can be developed to direct molecular synthesis in the organic solid state, directing reliable C&#9472;C bond formations to enable transformations difficult or impossible in solution. Special attention is given to postsynthetic modifications that serve to broaden the functional scope of solid&#8208;state reactivity allowing organic crystals to be developed as molecular flasks and a form of supramolecular matter.

         <title>Synthesis and Aggregation of Amphiphilic Porphyrin&#8208;Perylenebisimide Dyads</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report the straightforward synthesis of a family of amphiphilic zinc&#8208;porphyrin&#8208;perylenebisimide dyads containing sterically demanding substituents at the porphyrin meso&#8208;position, as well as at the PBI bay position. The hydrophilic head group consists of oligo&#8208;carboxylic acid G2&#8208;Newkome dendrons attached to the porphyrin, whereas lipophilic pentyl&#8208;hexyl&#8208;swallowtails are connected to the PBI imide position. Using UV/Vis absorption and fluorescence emission spectroscopy, their THF initiated disaggregation was studied in aqueous media. Without meso&#8208;substituents, a stronger interaction between the porphyrins was observed in the aggregated state. Insights into the size and morphology of the aggregates were obtained by dynamic light scattering (DLS) and scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM). Supported by density functional theory (DFT) calculations, these revealed micelles and liposomes as plausible architectures.</dc:description>

         <title>Specific Quenching of Natural Clusterization&#8208;Triggered Emission Probes for Rapid Fluorescent Detection of Antipsychotics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of rapid, cost&#8208;effective fluorescent probes for antipsychotic drug detection remains challenging due to the synthetic complexity of conventional probes and limited exploration of natural alternatives. Herein, we pioneered bovine serum albumin (BSA) as a natural clusterization&#8208;triggered emission (CTE) probe for one&#8208;step detection of chlorpromazine hydrochloride (CPZ) and perphenazine (PPZ). The unique CTE property of BSA displayed concentration&#8208;dependent quenching with CPZ and PPZ. Moreover, the quenching effect achieved balance within 5 min and maintained stability for more than 30 min. Based on these advantages, the proposed detection platform showed rapid response, operational simplicity, visual signal readout, wide detection range, ultra&#8208;low detection limits, compared with other methods. Moreover, the assay method exhibited excellent selectivity, facilitating satisfactory reliability for the real sample assay. Thermodynamic analyses reveal distinct interaction mechanisms between BSA and antipsychotics, both inducing static quenching by suppressing clusterization&#8208;induced electron transitions. Overall, this research not only develops a novel assay method for CPZ and PPZ, but also broadens the application potential of the CTE effect in natural biomacromolecules. As the first demonstration of natural CTE probes for antipsychotic detection, this work opens new frontiers for sustainable analytical technologies by circumventing synthetic probe complexities and leveraging inherent biorecognition.</dc:description>

         <title>A Reprocessable Dynamic Disulfide Hydrogel for Capacitive Pressure Sensors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>With the rapidly growing demand for wearable sensor devices across a range of applications, sensing technology has been rapidly advancing. However, challenges such as limited sensitivity, device instability, and trade&#8208;offs between performance and recyclability remain unaddressed. We report the facile fabrication of a recyclable dynamic disulfide hydrogel from an amphiphilic polyethylene&#8208;glycol&#8208;based thioctic acid derivative with hydrophilic/hydrophobic characteristics. The hydrogel demonstrates decent thermal stability and adequate mechanical properties, including elasticity, compressibility, and reprocessing capability. It is also integrated into a microstructured capacitive sensor, demonstrating a sensitivity of up to 1.14 kPa&#8208;1, rapid response times within 20 ms, and robust functioning stability up to 400 consecutive cycles. These properties make it particularly intriguing for the sustainable development of high&#8208;performance wearable sensors.</dc:description>

         <title>Aqueous Catalytic Olefin Polymerization with Nickel and Palladium Catalysts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polyolefins are extensively used in modern society, with hydrocarbon organic compounds traditionally serving as solvents for their preparation. Water, as a reaction medium, offers significant advantages, including non&#8208;flammability, non&#8208;toxicity, high specific heat capacity, and strong polarity.

         <title>Carbohydrate Synthesis is Entering the Data&#8208;Driven Digital Era</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The outcome of glycosylations, essential for glycochemistry, is difficult to predict due to its intricate mechanism and the influence of protective groups. Recent advances illustrate that integrating digital tools like automation, computational modelling, and data management drives progress in the carbohydrate synthesis field.








Abstract
Glycans are vital in biological processes, but their nontemplated, heterogeneous structures complicate structure&#8208;function analyses. Glycosylation, the key reaction in synthetic glycochemistry, remains not entirely predictable due to its complex mechanism and the need for protecting groups that impact reaction outcomes. This concept highlights recent advancements in glycochemistry and emphasizes the integration of digital tools, including automation, computational modelling, and data management, to improve carbohydrate synthesis and support further progress in the field.

         <title>Bimetallic Cu&#8208;Ni Catalysts Derived from Phyllosilicates for Synergistically Catalyzing CO2 and CH4 Dry Reforming</title>

         <dc:description>
A series of Cu&#8208;Ni bimetallic catalysts were synthesized using a stepwise ammonia evaporation&#8208;hydrothermal method Cu&#8208;Ni alloy in situ devried from bimetallic layered silicates facilitates the high dispersion and intimate distribution of copper and nickel atoms. The structure enhanced the oxidation resistance of nickel particles and inhibited their migration. In addition, the alteration of the reaction pathway inhibited carbon deposition and enhanced sintering resistance.








Abstract
Methane dry reforming reaction offers an attractive route to simultaneously convert two kinds of greenhouse gases into clean fuels and highly valuable chemicals. Nevertheless, the inactivation of nickel&#8208;based catalysts due to sintering and coking in dry reforming has severely limited its industrial application. In this study, we proposed a step&#8208;by&#8208;step strategy to prepare a series of bimetallic xCu&#8208;Ni/SiO2 catalysts derived from phyllosilicate precursors. The optimized catalyst shows exceptional performance, with no deactivation during the 50 hour stability test, and the CH4 and CO2 conversion were 88.8% and 94.0%, respectively. This was attributed to the synergistic catalysis of Cu&#8208;Ni alloy, which effectively inhibits coke formation. Additionally, the distribution of copper species between nickel species inhibited the mobility and enlargement of nickel particles and thus enhanced the resistance to sintering. The preparation strategy offers valuable insights for designing and preparing highly efficient and stable bimetallic catalysts under high&#8208;temperature conditions.

         <title>Catechol&#8208;Functionalized Covalent Organic Framework: Synthesis, Characterization and Metal&#8208;Free Organocatalyst for CO2 Fixation Under Mild Conditions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A catechol&#8208;functionalized COF was prepared. The COF, featuring both aldimine and ketimine linkages, adopted slipped AA stacking mode. The material showed high CO2 uptake capacity and high catalytic activity for cycloaddition of CO2 and epoxide at mild conditions. The adsorption of CO2 was studied by GCMC simulations and the activation of epoxide was investigated through DFT calculations.

Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) incorporating hydrogen bond donor (HBD) moieties show great promise for heterogeneous catalyst for CO2 cycloaddition. In this work, a catechol&#8208;functionalized COF (BL&#8208;TF&#8208;COF) was constructed via Schiff&#8208;base condensation under solvothermal conditions, which was characterized using powder X&#8208;ray diffraction (PXRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT&#8208;IR), solid&#8208;state 13C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), scanning electron microscope (SEM), high resolution transmission electron microscope (HR&#8208;TEM), diffuse reflection spectroscopy (DRS) and cyclic voltammetry (CV). BL&#8208;TF&#8208;COF presents high crystallinity, large surface area (523 m2&#160;g&#8722;1) and remarkable chemical stability, along with abundant hydroxyl functional groups distributed on the pore wall. This framework shows a CO2 adsorption capacity up to 88&#160;mg g&#8722;1 at 273 K and 1&#160;bar. The binding locations of the adsorption of CO2 over BL&#8208;TF&#8208;COF was studied by grand canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) simulations. BL&#8208;TF&#8208;COF displays remarkable catalytic performance for the cycloaddition of CO2 with epoxides under mild conditions. Under the condition of the epichlorohydrin/tetrabutylammonium bromide/BL&#8208;TF&#8208;COF molar ratio of 10210:630:4, the system achieved 62.5% substrate conversion at 25 &#176;C under atmospheric CO2 pressure (1 bar) within 48&#160;h. Mechanistic insights into epoxide adsorption and activation processes were investigated through density functional theory (DFT) calculations.

         <title>Efficiently Electrocatalytic Overall Water Splitting over Ni0.85Se&#8208;Ni Foam Electrode Modified with Nanoneedle&#8208;Like Ni3Fe Alloy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ni3Fe alloy was successfully deposited on the surface of the 3D porous Ni0.85Se&#8208;NF electrode by the electrochemical deposition method. The Ni3Fe/Ni0.85Se&#8208;NF electrodes exhibited excellent electrocatalytic performance of overall water splitting in an alkaline solution under a three&#8208;electrode system.








Abstract
Electrocatalytic splitting of H2O into H2 and O2 is one of the potential ways to develop clean and storable energy. In this study, the self&#8208;supported Ni0.85Se&#8208;Ni foam (Ni0.85Se&#8208;NF) hybrid electrode was modified with Ni3Fe (Ni3Fe/Ni0.85Se&#8208;NF) via a facile selenization and electrochemical deposition method. The Ni3Fe/Ni0.85Se&#8208;NF hybrid electrode exhibited excellent performance of electrocatalytic overall water splitting in an alkaline solution (1&#160;m KOH, pH&#160;=&#160;13.9), which is much more active than the individual Ni0.85Se&#8208;NF and Ni3Fe/NF. In particular, the Ni3Fe/Ni0.85Se&#8208;NF hybrid electrode generated 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 cathodic current at an overpotential of 81&#160;mV, and 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 anodic current at an overpotential of 209&#160;mV in KOH solution (1&#160;m, pH&#160;=&#160;13.9), respectively. In addition, only 1.68&#160;V potential was required to generate 12&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 current in a two&#8208;electrode system for overall water splitting in an alkaline aqueous solution using the Ni3Fe/Ni0.85Se&#8208;NF working as the anode and cathode, respectively. The TEM images and Raman spectra results indicated that the microstructure reconstruction happened on the surface of the Ni3Fe/Ni0.85Se&#8208;NF electrode after the HER or OER test. Some Ni and Fe species were found to convert to the NixFe1&#8208;xOOH during water electrocatalysis.

Photochemical alternative and sustainable approach for C&#9472;O bond formation at room temperature!! &#160;light&#8208;driven ligand&#8208;to&#8208;metal charge transfer (LMCT) strategy for site&#8208;selective C&#9472;O bond formation at room&#8208;temperature conditions. In situ formation of the organophosphine&#8208;ruthenium complex addressing challenges commonly encountered with traditional methods, making it a highly attractive and effective strategy. Mechanistic studies reveal the LMCT process, role of light, ligand and in situ formation of metal&#8208;complex intermediates.








Abstract
Photoinduced ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed ortho&#8208;benzoxylation through organophosphine ligand is unveiled. The in situ generation of the organophosphine&#8208;ruthenium complex facilitates ligand&#8208;to&#8208;metal charge transfer (LMCT) under visible light, promoting the site&#8208;selective ortho&#8208;benzoxylation at room temperature. The broad scope of aryl, aliphatic, and heterocyclic carboxylic acids are key attractions of this methodology. EPR and UV&#8208;Vis analysis support a LMCT process between a photoexcited organophosphine and Ru&#8208;complex under blue&#8208;light irradiation. Comprehensive mechanistic investigation highlights the role of light, ligands, oxidants, the LMCT process, and the unique reactivity of the directing group.

         <title>Thermally Activated On&#8208;Surface Self&#8208;Metalation of Pd&#8208;Phthalocyanines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Surfaces enable scalable reactions. Here, Pd(001) drives the self&#8208;metalation of H2Pc${\rm H}_2{\rm Pc}$, where the molecule captures a substrate atom to form PdPc. Spectroscopy reveals the reaction pathway, marking the first demonstration of phthalocyanine self&#8208;metalation on&#160;Pd.







Abstract
Phthalocyanines (Pcs) are essential organic molecules with wide&#8208;ranging applications in fields such as catalysis and optoelectronics, owing to their stable aromatic structure and exceptional thermal stability. Equally important is their versatility, which can be achieved by modifying the central metal atom. In this context, metalation&#8212;the process by which a central metal atom is incorporated into the macrocycle&#8212;plays a critical role in tailoring both the electronic and structural properties of Pcs. In this work, we investigate the thermally activated on&#8208;surface synthesis of palladium phthalocyanine (PdPc) by depositing metal&#8208;free phthalocyanine (H2Pc${\rm H}_2{\rm Pc}$) onto a Pd(001) surface in ultra&#8208;high vacuum (UHV) conditions. Using temperature&#8208;dependent X&#8208;ray photoemission spectroscopy (XPS), we analyze the evolution of the N 1s$1s$ core level signal, confirming the successful formation of PdPc. The appearance of a secondary peak in the Pd 3d$3d$ core level, attributed to Pd atoms coordinated within the phthalocyanine molecule after metalation, provides further evidence for the PdPc synthesis. Additionally, near&#8208;edge X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure (NEXAFS) reveals that no desorption or chemical degradation occurs during the process. We believe this study represents a significant step forward in the scalable synthesis of PdPc, which, like other Pd&#8208;containing organic molecules, holds great potential for applications in catalysis and cancer&#160;therapy.

         <title>Molecular Hybrid Photocatalysts for CO2 Photoreduction by Hybridization of Molecular Catalysts and Photoactive Covalent Organic Frameworks &#8211; A Review</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photocatalytic reduction of CO2 to obtain storable fuels is an effective way to fix and utilize greenhouse gas CO2, ultimately achieving a carbon free energy cycle. The core of this goal lies the development of efficient, sustainable, and economically practical catalysts and light absorbers. Currently, hybrid photocatalytic systems that immobilize molecular catalysts on covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are of intensified interest, as this strategy enables the simultaneous exploitation of the catalytic properties of high&#8208;performance molecular catalysts, together with the durability of heterogeneous semiconductors, based on the readily available synthetic tunability of both components. This review focuses on the significant progress and challenges that have been overcome for the photocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction, mediated by COFs hybridized with molecular catalysts, aiming to provide strong guidance for innovative utilization towards sustainable photocatalytic CO2 reduction in the future.</dc:description>

         <title>DOS&#8208;like strategy for the spirocyclic MedChem relevant building blocks via Petasis / Grubbs reactions sequence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Through this model study, we showed broad perspectives on utilizing the DOS&#8208;like approach on the building block level in combination with well&#8208;developed methodologies for parallel synthesis for decoration and extension of ultra&#8208;large tangible chemical space to increase the speed and quality of drug discovery screening campaigns. This strategy led us to 16 novel Bemis&#8208;Murco scaffolds based on spirocyclic functionalized piperidines. The efficient, preparative, and scalable DOS&#8208;like approach to the above&#8208;mentioned motif was achieved by Petasis/Grubbs reactions sequence in a multigram scale. The chemoinformatically generated amide&#8208;based compound libraries demonstrated significant expansion of the chemical space of tangible compounds (on the example of Enamine&#8217;s REAL database).</dc:description>

         <title>CuOx&#8208;ZrO2&#8208;TiOx Composite Interfaces with Strong Lewis Acid Activity for Electrooxidation of Methane to Acetic Acid</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The electrochemical conversion of methane (CH4) to valuable oxygenates is an attractive approach to utilize abundant natural gas, however, the chemical inertness of CH4 and low solubility in electrolytes impede effective electrooxidation. Enhancing the adsorption and activation of CH4 on catalysts is crucial for electrocatalytic methane oxidation reaction (eMOR). In this study, we develop the CuOx&#8208;ZrO2&#8208;TiOx composite catalyst for the selective electrooxidation of CH4 to CH3COOH. The ZrO2&#8208;TiOx was in situ synthesized on Ti substrates via the hydrothermal reaction of TiO2 nanowires with H2C2O4 and Zr(NO3)4. Subsequently, CuOx was uniformly disposed on ZrO2&#8208;TiOx with the assistance of polyvinylpyrrolidone and citric acid. The prepared electrode achieves the Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 60.1% for CH3COOH at the current density of 10.8 mA cm&#8208;2, corresponding to the generation rate of 3312.5 &#956;mol gcat&#8208;1 h&#8208;1. Mechanism studies confirm that the synergistic effect of CuOx and ZrO2&#8208;TiOx interfaces enhances the efficiency of eMOR. CuOx oxidizes H2O to produce hydroxyl radicals (*OH) and ZrO2&#8208;TiOx interfaces with strong Lewis acid activity adsorb and activate CH4. The CuOx and ZrO2&#8208;TiOx interfaces synergistically oxidize CH4 to generate a series of intermediates (*CH3, *CH3O, *CH2O, *COOH), promoting C&#8208;C coupling to produce CH3COOH.</dc:description>

         <title>Kinetically arrested SERS&#8208;Active aggregates for biosensing</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>There is a demand for biosensors capable of long&#8208;term, non&#8208;invasive monitoring of low analyte concentrations in various biofluids for diagnostics, personalized healthcare, and disease monitoring. Biofluids present challenges to biosensor sensing and stability on account of their complex composition and dynamic nature. Surface Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy (SERS) offers ultra&#8208;high sensitivity, non&#8208;destructive, real&#8208;time monitoring and non&#8208;invasive detection, ideal for sensing in complex media. Plasmonic gold nanoparticle (AuNP) SERS&#8208;active assemblies have been widely explored owning to their biocompatibility and tuneable sensitivity based on AuNP morphology. Controlled aggregation of AuNPs has been achieved by incorporating a &#8216;molecular&#8208;glue&#8217;, cucurbit[7]uril (CB[7]), to produce AuNP:CB[7] aggregates containing robust nanogaps (ca. 1 nm) and displaying strong, reproducible SERS signals at low concentrations, but eventually leads to irreversible precipitation. Here we employ thiolated poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG&#8208;SH) to produce kinetically trapped metastable AuNP:CB[7]:PEG aggregates. The aggregates maintain SERS&#8208;activity, are highly tuneable through facile modification of the PEG chain length and grafting density, and possess improved stability. Moreover, the AuNP:CB[7]:PEG aggregates demonstrate low concentration detection of a common Raman reporter alongside a bioanalyte in a range of biofluids highlighting the potential application of these aggregates for non&#8208;invasive in vivo long&#8208;term monitoring alongside future customized SERS biosensing applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Cobalt&#8208;Catalyzed C&#8208;H Oxidation of Alkanes and Post&#8208;Functionalization of Polyolefin Elastomers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This study focuses on the post&#8208;functionalization of polyolefin elastomers (POE) through direct C&#8208;H activation using a novel cobalt&#8208;based catalytic system. The investigation, initiated with the oxidation of cyclohexane, identified the cumene hydroperoxide (CumHPO) as the optimal oxidant and ligands L3, L4, and L7 as effective in chlorinated benzene solvents. Cobalt catalyst (Cat. 1) demonstrated superior activity in the oxidation of octadecane, achieving a 42% yield with a minimal catalyst amounts. The catalytic system was successfully extended to the C&#8208;H oxidation of POE, introducing functional groups in solvents like 1,2&#8208;Cl2C6H4 and 1,2,4&#8208;Cl3C6H3. Our findings propose a simple and green approach for the post&#8208;functionalization of POE, offering versatility and potential for broader applications in the field of polymeric compounds.</dc:description>

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Regioselective meta C&#8211;H Bond Olefination of Anilides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we report a Cu&#8208;catalyzed meta&#8208;olefination of anilides using alkenyl iodonium salts. The olefination of a panel of pivanilides was achieved using an additive&#8208;free copper&#8208;based catalytic system under mild reaction conditions (25 examples, up to 60% yield). By favoring a Heck&#8208;like four&#8208;membered transition state, the approach demonstrated an excellent regioselectivity for the meta C&#8722;H functionalization with &#946;&#8208;styrenyl and &#946;&#8208;alkyl&#8208;alkenyl groups using a weakly coordinated directing group. Post&#8208;functionalization reactions were conducted, highlighting both the synthetic interest of the products and the potential atom&#8208;efficiency of the process.</dc:description>

         <title>A Copper(I) Catenane Decorated Metal&#8208;Organic Layer as a Heterogenous Catalyst for Dehydrogenative Cross&#8208;Coupling</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>While Earth&#8208;abundant metals are green and sustainable alternatives to precious metals for catalytic chemical conversions, the fast ligand exchange involving most of the base metals renders their development into robust, reusable catalysts very challenging. Described in this work is a new type of heterogeneous catalyst derived from a 2D metal&#8208;organic layer (MOL) grafted with catenane&#8208;coordinated Cu(I) complexes. In addition to the good substrate accessibility, easy functionalization and other favorable features due to the MOL support, the mechanical bond in the anchored catenane ligands also represents a new mechanism to dynamically confine the coordination environment and kinetically stabilize the coordinated Cu(I) to give a well&#8208;defined, active yet stable heterogeneous catalyst. Pilot catalytic studies using a model dehydrogenative C&#8211;O cross coupling reaction showed that the Cu(I) catenane&#8208;grafted MOL led to exclusive formation of the C&#8211;O coupled product, whereas control catalysis using a similar Cu(I) catalyst supported by non&#8208;interlocked macrocyclic ligands was found to also give a C&#8211;C coupled by&#8208;product, whose formation was found to be mediated by the uncontrolled presence of Cu(II), highlighting the distinctive roles and untapped potential of the catenane coordination in developing base metal&#8208;derived catalysts for challenging catalytic conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Higher BODIPY Homologues &#8211; Synthesis, Reactivity and Photoluminescence Investigations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthesis of MesDPM group 13 (B&#8211;In, MesDPM = 1,5,9&#8208;trimesityldipyrromethene) compounds with halide substituents (Cl&#8211;I) is described. All compounds were fully characterized including NMR and IR spectroscopy as well as mass spectrometry. In addition, the solid state molecular structures have been determined by X&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD) analysis. As higher representatives of BODIPY (= boron difluoride dipyrromethene) dyes, some of these MesDPM triel dihalides also exhibit an intense green fluorescence when exposed to sunlight. In this regard, the optical properties were investigated by UV/Vis and photoluminescence spectroscopy giving absorption maxima around 520 nm and fluorescence emission in the range between and 550 and 660 nm. Fluorescence quantum efficiencies up to 42% could be obtained from measurements in toluene solution. Further, reactivity studies were carried out which opened&#8208;up access to mixed substituted MesDPM triels with one alkyl and one halide substituent.</dc:description>

         <title>Light&#8208;responsive mononucleotide coacervates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation (LLPS) is central to the formation of biomolecular condensates in modern cells and is also explored as a mechanism for assembling protocells. Phase&#8208;separated droplets provide dynamic micro&#8208;environments that concentrate reactants, enhance reactions, and allow molecular exchange, essential for both cellular regulation and adaptive compartmentalization. While modern cells achieve dynamic LLPS through enzymatic and metabolic pathways, protocells may be designed to harness external stimuli such as pH, temperature, redox potential, or light. However, existing studies of light&#8208;responsive coacervates rely on complex biomolecules, limiting their use as minimal platforms of energy&#8208;driven phase separation. Here, we develop a minimal system of light&#8208;responsive coacervates composed of low&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight species: mononucleotides and azobenzene&#8208;based amphiphiles with varying charge valency. These coacervates undergo reversible phase transitions through azobenzene photoisomerization, with their behavior governed by charge valency and nucleotide structure. We demonstrate that coacervates formed with high&#8208;valency azobenzenes remain stable under UV irradiation but exhibit significant property changes, while those with low&#8208;valency azobenzenes dissolve, enabling light&#8208;controlled nucleotide release. Additionally, we achieved hierarchical droplet organization and light&#8208;actuated biomolecular localization within multiphase systems. Overall, these findings establish a minimal platform for designing light&#8208;responsive synthetic protocells, providing insights into dynamic compartmentalization in de novo life&#8208;like systems.</dc:description>

         <title>From Donor&#8208;Acceptor Ligands to Smart Coordination Polymers: Cyanothiazole&#8208;Cu(I) Complexes for Multifunctional Electronic Devices</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cyanothiazoles, small and quite overlooked molecules, possess remarkable optical properties that can be fine&#8208;tuned through coordination with transition metals. In this study, we investigate a promising application of cyanothiazoles, where their combination with copper(I) iodide forms a new class of complexes exhibiting outstanding optical properties. X&#8208;ray crystallography of copper(I) iodide complexes with isomeric cyanothiazoles revealed key structural features, such as &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking, hydrogen bonding, and rare halogen&#8208;&#8208;&#8208;chalcogen I&#8208;&#8208;&#8208;S interactions, enhancing stability and reactivity. Advanced spectroscopy and computational modeling allowed precise identification of spectral signatures in FTIR, NMR, and UV&#8208;Vis spectra. Fluorescence studies, along with EXAFS and XANES synchrotron analyses, highlighted their unique thermal and electronic properties, providing a solid foundation for further research in the field.</dc:description>

         <title>The Effect of Aldehyde and Carboxylic Acid Substitution on the Isomerization of Hemithioindigo Photoswitches</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hemithioindigo (HTI) photoswitches exhibit robust photoisomerization under visible light and relatively high thermal bistability. In this work, we report various modifications of the HTI core, namely the introduction of aldehydes and carboxylic acids at the para position of the stilbene fragment with different oxidation states of the sulfur center, and the incorporation of a Schiff base moiety. These modifications allowed tuning of the absorption properties, quantum yields of isomerization, and thermal stability of the metastable E&#8208;isomers. Notably, the formyl&#8208; and carboxyl&#8208;substituted HTI switches achieved high yields of isomerization under visible light in various solvents, while sulfur oxidation enhanced quantum yields but reduced photochromism. Schiff base formation led to red&#8208;shifted absorption and increased thermal stability. Finally, by leveraging the carboxyl substituents, we incorporated an HTI chromophore into the NU&#8208;1000 metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF), and demonstrated solid&#8208;state photoisomerization. These findings highlight key structural modifications that expand the applicability of HTI photoswitches for molecular switching in solution and solid&#8208;state environments.</dc:description>

         <title>SIMPLE LARGE&#8208;SCALE PREPARATION OF CARBON DOT COMPOSITES WITH HIGH LUMINESCENT PERFORMANCE</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>At present, the demand for high&#8208;performance and cost&#8208;effective luminescent materials has increasingly grown and carbon dots (CDs) stand out due to their distinctive advantages. However, their preparation and purification process are too complex to commercialize. Issues such as fluorescence quenching, low quantum yield of short&#8208;wavelength emission and short room temperature phosphorescence lifetimes still need to be addressed. Here, we successfully prepared CD composites on a large scale for the applications of deep&#8208;blue LEDs and phosphorescent encryption through the combination of several easy, controllable and repeatable strategys. Their luminescent properties are similar to the precursor and the luminescent performance are more excellent, achieving a fluorescence quantum yield of 65.46 % and a phosphorescence lifetime of 1489.2 ms. Through various characterizations, it was found that ammonia, polar groups and urea content affect the whole crystallization process of matrix. We put forward that surface free energy leads to different morphologys and the special structure of the composites which provide new ideas for the subsequent explain about reaction process between CDs and matrix. The success of the scale&#8208;up experiment demonstrates the potential for large&#8208;scale preparation of this scheme, thereby inspiring future large&#8208;scale production of solid CDs.</dc:description>

         <title>Supramolecular Nanochannels: Suprasome&#8208;Mediated Delivery of Ionophore To Regulate Transmembrane Zn2+ Ion Transport</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of synthetic ion channels and stimuli&#8208;responsive suprasomes represents two crucial yet largely disconnected areas of supramolecular chemistry. Herein, we demonstrated that suprasomes can effectively deliver hydrophobic synthetic ion transporters to lipid membranes, regulating physiologically significant transition metal ions and subsequently modulating activity within lipid&#8208;bound compartments. We showed that a potent bis(vinylbenzimidazole)phenol derivative self&#8208;assembles within the lipid bilayer to form a supramolecular nanochannel, which facilitates selective and efficient transport of Zn2+ ions from the external aqueous solution across the lipid bilayer and into the internal solution of large unilamellar vesicles via an electrogenic pathway. The hydrophobic ion transporter could also be delivered to lipid bilayers due to its inherent ability to form suprasomal assembly with &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin (&#946;&#8208;CD) through dynamic host&#8208;guest interactions. The Zn&#178;&#8314; ions serve as stimuli to disassemble the suprasomes and release the ion transporter, which further penetrates the bilayers of lipid vesicles and regulates transmembrane Zn2+ ion transport. The application of this strategy of stimuli&#8208;mediated delivery of synthetic ion transporters to regulate transmembrane Zn2+ ion transport showed antibacterial activities against Gram&#8208;positive, Gram&#8208;negative and drug&#8208;resistant bacterial cells.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The direct &#945;&#8208;arylation of a protected 4&#8208;hydroxy piperidine via a one&#8208;pot Negishi cross&#8208;coupling reaction is described. The methodology uses a single solvent, toluene, for the lithiation / transmetallation / Negishi sequence and 20 examples are presented. Of note, the high yielding cross&#8208;coupling of a range of pharmaceutically&#8208;relevant heteroaryl bromides is reported. The reactions show high levels of 2,4&#8208;cis&#8208;diastereoselectivity and further functionalisations are also described. Piperidine is the most common nitrogen heterocycle in approved drugs and our approach delivers such heterocycles via a direct diastereoselective &#945;&#8208;functionalisation of 4&#8208;substituted N&#8208;Boc piperidines; as such, the approach is ready to be utilised in the pharmaceutical industry.</dc:description>

         <title>Bis(10&#8208;oxacorrole) with Fused Pyridine as a Linker: Synthesis, Structure, and Interaction between the Subunits in the Neutral, Mono&#8208; and Dicationic States</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Pyridine&#8208;fused bis(oxacorrole)s are obtained by a Hantzsch&#8208;type cyclization using arylaldehydes and 3&#8208;amino&#8208;10&#8208;oxacorrole. Spectroscopic characteristics, corroborated by DFT calculations, indicate aromaticity of the dimer and strong interaction between the subunits. Electrochemical and spectroelectrochemical analyses indicate facile access to cation radicals and dicationic species. The oxidized forms are characterized by electronic and electron spin resonance spectroscopies as well as by DFT calculations. Monocations give rise to strong absorption bands in the NIR region between 1500 and 2500 nm, while dications are characterized by a series of absorptions between 1000 and 2200 nm. ESR and VT NMR experiments indicate the presence of singlet&#8208;triplet spin equilibria for the solution of the dication. For the dication of bis(oxacorrole) in the singlet ground state, neither aromaticity nor antiaromaticity has been detected by low&#8208;temperature 1H NMR and GIAO calculations despite delocalization of &#960;&#8208;electrons.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>We herein developed a novel method for generating nitro radicals using sodium nitrite under electrocatalytic conditions for the first time. A series of vicinal hydroxynitro or chloronitro compounds was generated in good yields. This methodology features simple reaction setup, mild reaction conditions, and cheap electrodes, and simultaneously shows excellent functional group tolerance and broad substrate scope, enabling efficient gram&#8208;scale reactions with good to excellent yields. Besides, the EIS and CV results provided deeper insights into the reaction mechanism. Further extensions of the method have also confirmed the practicality of the strategy developed.</dc:description>

Further extensions of the method have also confirmed the practicality of the strategy developed.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>While the classical buckybowls, such as corannulene, sumanene, have been extensively investigated, research on other molecular bowls containing double neighboring pentagonal rings remains underdeveloped. Here we present the synthesis of nitrogen&#8208;doped molecular bowls incorporating adjacent pentagonal motifs with an extended &#960;&#8208;conjugated surface. Their molecular curvatures are preserved according to the analyses of bowl&#8208;depth, &#960;&#8208;orbital axis vector angles and inversion energy barrier when compared to those of their parent structures. The extended &#960;&#8208;conjugation induces the bathochromic shifts of both absorption and emission spectra, the narrowed energy gaps of the frontier molecular orbitals, as well as the enhanced aromatic character in the fused pentagonal rings. Furthermore, the extended aromatic surface enables the binding with fullerene C60 in solution.</dc:description>

         <title>Polyimides with Excited&#8208;State Intramolecular Proton Transfer and Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence Properties by End&#8208;capping</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic polymers possessing excited&#8208;state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT) significantly impact their electronic and optical properties through stimulus response, leading to unique photoluminescence behaviors such as large Stokes shifts, dual emission, and environmental sensitivity. In this work, polyimides (PIs) exhibiting both ESIPT and room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) properties were designed and synthesized by end&#8208;capping with 5&#8208;amino&#8208;2&#8208;(2&#8208;hydroxyphenyl) benzothiazole (HBTA) and 5&#8208;amino&#8208;2&#8208;(2&#8208;hydroxyphenyl) benzimidazole (HBIA), respectively. HBTA&#8208;PI and HBIA&#8208;PI exhibit bright yellow&#8208;green and sky&#8208;blue fluorescence at 510&#160;and 470 nm, with a relatively high photoluminescence quantum yields of about 27.2% and 25.1%, respectively. Importantly, HBTA&#8208;PI and HBIA&#8208;PI show excellent room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence emissions at 520&#160;and 485 nm, with decay lifetimes of 76.5 ms and 53.2 ms. The theoretical results indicate that the effective and large spin&#8208;orbit coupling (SOC) constants from their keto forms in the excited state can enhance the intersystem crossing (ISC) process to produce triplet excitons. The rigid polyimide networks further inhibit the non&#8208;radiative decay of triplet excitons and enhance phosphorescence emission. Additionally, the excellent ESIPT properties of HBTA&#8208;PI and HBIA&#8208;PI enable the detection of HCl vapor, which induces multiple fluorescent and phosphorescent color changes. This work provides good examples of polyimides for organic polymers with ESIPT properties and multi&#8208;stimulus response emissions.</dc:description>

This process involves the generation of glycosyl radicals from easily accessible 1&#8208;bromosugar precursors which can capture quinoxalinone under photoinduced Pd(0) catalysis. The reaction operates under mild conditions offering excellent axial selectivity with a diverse array of substrates.

         <title>Photocatalytic Hydrophosphination Using Calcium Precatalysts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hydrophosphination using calcium compounds as catalysts under irradiation is described as a foray into s&#8208;block photocatalysis. Transition&#8208;metal compounds have been highly successful hydrophosphination catalysts under photochemical conditions, utilizing substrates previously considered inaccessible. A calcium hydrophosphination precatalyst, Ca(nacnac)(THF)(N(SiMe3)2) (1, nacnac = HC[(C(Me)N&#8208;2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3)]2), reported by Barrett and Hill, as well as the presumed intermediate, Ca(nacnac)(THF)(PPh2) (2), and the Schlenk equilibrium product, Ca[N(SiMe3)2]2(THF)2 (3) were screened under photochemical conditions with a range of unsaturated substrates including styrenic alkenes, Michael acceptors, and dienes with modest to excellent conversions, though unactivated alkenes were inaccessible. All compounds exhibit enhanced catalysis under irradiation by LED&#8208;generated blue light. Nacnac&#8208;supported compounds generate radicals as evidenced by EPR spectroscopy and radical trapping reactions, whereas unsupported calcium compounds are EPR silent and appear to undergo hydrophosphination akin to thermal reactions with these compounds. These results buttress the notion that photoactivation of &#960;&#8208;basic ligands is a broad phenomenon, extending beyond the d&#8208;block, but like d&#8208;block metals, consideration of ancillary ligands is essential to avoid radical reactivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of C4&#8208;Acyl Glycosides by Cross&#8208;Ketonization: The Importance of Precise Temperature Control in Photochemistry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We describe herein a method for the synthesis of reversed C&#8208;acyl glycosides by direct cross&#8208;ketonization of linear carboxylic acids with carboxy sugars under metallaphotoredox conditions. This reaction proves to be highly sensitive to reaction temperature, with the reproducibility and yield of ketonization highly dependent upon precise temperature control. Analysis of the reaction mechanism suggests this sensitivity reflects the need to match the rate of Ni catalytic turnover with the rate of photocatalytic decarboxylation of the carboxy sugar. The insights gained from this study have important implications for the study of all metallaphotoredox reactions as well as other photoreactions that involve dual catalytic cycles.</dc:description>

         <title>Unlocking the Room Temperature Phosphorescence through Halogen Engineering in Carbazole Dimer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) in metal&#8208;free organic materials offers immense potential for advanced optoelectronic applications. However, the rational design and fine&#8208;tuning of RTP remain challenging due to the complex correlation between molecular structure and photophysical processes. Herein, we explored the impact of intersystem crossing (ISC), spin&#8208;orbit coupling (SOC), and halogen interactions to promote RTP in crystalline brominated carbazole dimer (BrCz&#8208;D). In contrast, the unsubstituted analogue, Cz&#8208;D exhibits thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) under ambient conditions. Femtosecond transient absorption (fsTA) spectroscopy measurements confirmed the population of triplet manifolds in both dimers. Bromine substitution significantly enhances spin&#8208;orbit coupling (VSOC = 23.22 cm&#8722;1), enabling efficient ISC and robust RTP in BrCz&#8208;D. Enhanced RTP in crystalline BrCz&#8208;D is attributed to unique halogen interactions, including Br&#183;&#183;&#183;Br, C&#183;&#183;&#183;Br, and H&#183;&#183;&#183;Br, within the crystal lattice. Such halogen interactions are negligible in the solution state, accounting for the lack of RTP under ambient conditions. The present work highlights the critical role of SOC and halogen bonding in achieving efficient RTP for designing high&#8208;performance organic phosphorescent materials through crystallochemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>Ruthenium Catalyzed Site Selective Annulation of Benzoxazinones. An Easy Access to Dihydroisoquinoline Benzamide Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed chelation&#8208;assisted substrate&#8208;controlled, site selective, one pot three component cascade dehydrogenative annulation reaction is reported. The developed methodology leads to the synthesis of biologically active 4H&#8208;benzo[d] [1,3] oxazin&#8208;4&#8208;one derivatives by the nucleophilic addition of amines to benzoxazinones followed by coupling with diphenyl acetylenes. In addition to providing excellent yields of products, the method is also regioselective. This new protocol has been demonstrated to have an easy access to a variety of dihydroisoquinoline benzamide derivatives.</dc:description>

         <title>Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Prodrug Linkers that Simultaneously Release Cargo and Neutralize in situ Generated (Aza)Quinone Methides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Self&#8208;immolative linkers that use p&#8208;amino/hydroxy&#8208;benzyloxycarbonyl (PABC/PHBC) spacers are essential to the mechanism of many prodrugs. However, a highly reactive (aza)quinone methide is generated as a potential toxic byproduct. To remove the methide as it forms, we synthesized a series of novel tripartite prodrugs, comprising different triggers (nitro, amide, azide, boronate) and a PABC/PHBC&#8208;type self&#8208;immolative spacer with an integrated nucleophile (amine). Upon reductive, hydrolytic or oxidative trigger activation, the release of the cargo is facilitated via a 1,6&#8208;elimination that generates a reactive (aza)quinone methide. With the built&#8208;in nucleophile, the (aza)quinone methide is rapidly self&#8208;quenched to generate tetrahydroisoquinolines (THIQs). One of the selected THIQs does not exhibit an anti&#8208;proliferative effect on the A431 mammalian tumor cell line. The new prodrug strategy has broad scope, enabling the use of a trigger that matches the targeted stimulus, while allowing for a diverse range of drug/cargo attachment. This proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept study adds a new linker strategy that quenches the electrophilic (aza)quinone methide generated in many self&#8208;immolative linker systems and could find applications in prodrug and antibody&#8208;drug conjugate strategies, or as a linker for probes in chemical biology.</dc:description>

         <title>Endohedral Coordination of Bulky Substrates in Metalloenzyme&#8208;like Organometallic Nanotubes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Artificial receptors inspired by metalloenzymes share three key properties: a structurally flexible cavity, substrate binding via metal&#8211;ligand coordination, and metal&#8208;based redox activity. Herein, we report an organometallic nanotube with such features based on our supramolecular pillarplex platform, with eight CuI centers integrated in its cavitand walls. The structurally adaptable cavity of this receptor enables the endohedral coordination of tetrahydrofuran (THF) as a hydrophilic model substrate with remarkable binding affinity despite a steric mismatch between the host and guest. Evidence from SC&#8208;XRD, 1H NMR titration in aqueous solution, and DFT modelling confirms that metal&#8211;ligand coordination governs substrate binding. Electrochemical analysis of a derived rotaxane reveals metal&#8208;centered redox activity.</dc:description>

         <title>Long&#8208;Lived Excimer&#8208;Like Emission from a &#960;&#8208;Stacked Trichromophore Comprising Perylene Monoimide and Perylene Diimide Units</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A trichromophore has been synthesized comprising a perylene diimide sandwiched between two perylene monoimide diester (PMIDE) units and held in place by xanthene spacers. The DFT computed structure indicates &#960;&#8208;stacking of the three polycycles, with a mean interplanar separation of 4.2&#258;, but with the central unit displaced sideways. Phenyl groups inserted between xanthene and perylene help to rigidify the structure. Electronic interactions between perylene polycycles splits the absorption spectrum, which is dominated by transitions to the upper&#8208;lying H&#8208;state. Excimer&#8208;like emission is observed in solution at room temperature, for which the lifetime is ca. 22 ns in toluene and ca. 8 ns in CH2Cl2. Transient absorption spectroscopy indicates instantaneous formation of a Franck&#8208;Condon state, which undergoes rapid vibrational cooling to populate the low&#8208;lying J&#8208;state. This species transforms over 40&#8208;60 ps into an excimer&#8208;like state wherein the exciton is delocalised over all three perylenes. A slower structural re&#8208;arrangement, complete within 1 ns, minimises electronic interactions with one of the PMIDE units and stabilises the resultant bipartite excimer&#8208;like state.</dc:description>

         <title>Parent, Unsubstituted Corrphycene: Synthesis and Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report the synthesis of a porphyrin isomer that, until now, has only been obtained in the form of multiply substituted derivatives. Structural, spectral, and electrochemical characteristics of unsubstituted corrphycene (Cp) are described along with the data for its precursor, 11,18&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butylcorrphycene. Similar to porphine, Cp turns out to be a soft chromophore, characterized by very similar energy splittings between the pairs of frontier HOMO and LUMO orbitals. Magnetic circular dichroism spectra indicate that the splitting in the HOMO orbitals is larger than in the LUMO, opposite to the DFT predictions. Corrphycene exists in the form of a doubly degenerated trans tautomeric species. The two intramolecular H&#8208;bonds are not equivalent, which strongly suggests a stepwise mechanism of trans&#8208;trans conversion. Being a nearly perfect soft chromophore, Cp emerges as an attractive candidate for sensing changes in its environment.</dc:description>

         <title>Extrudable Thermosets Based on Dynamic Covalent Polymers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dynamic covalent polymers (DCPs) have attracted considerable attention for fabricating self&#8208;healing, recyclable, adaptive, and malleable thermosets. However, their processing has largely depended on compression moulding, which requires extended time due to the crosslinked nature of these materials. This limitation poses significant challenges for applications in continuous processes like extrusion, a technique highly valued in industry for producing long, uninterrupted products. Recently, continuous processing methods for DCPs have emerged, offering potential to streamline their production by providing scalability and consistency&#8208;factors that could transform sectors such as automotive, aerospace, and consumer goods. Yet, developing extrudable DCPs remains a complex task, demanding the precise design of dynamic crosslinks with rapid kinetics, high thermal stability, and cost&#8208;effectiveness, all while ensuring compatibility with suitable molecular backbones. In this review, we summarize the key requirements for designing extrudable DCPs and discuss recent advancements in continuous processing techniques aligned with various design strategies. We also highlight the challenges and outline future directions for optimizing high&#8208;performance DCP extrusion, aiming to offer a valuable resource for researchers and industry professionals looking to leverage these techniques.</dc:description>

         <title>Tuning of Thermal Back Reactivity of Aza&#8208;Diarylethene Photoswitches by Introducing Benzazole Groups</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Molecular photoswitches have attracted significant attention due to their potential applications in materials science and life science. In this study, we synthesize a series of aza&#8208;diarylethenes incorporating benzazole groups as the nitrogen atom source for 6&#960; azaelectrocyclization and investigate their photochromic behaviors. Compounds 1&#8211;3, bearing benzothiazole, benzoxazole, and benzimidazole groups, exhibit thermally reversible type photochromism with thermal back reaction half&#8208;lives (t1/2) ranging from milliseconds to seconds at 293 K. Additional derivatives 4&#8211;6 with benzothiophene&#8208;S,S&#8208;dioxide at the ethene bridge moiety, further expand the range of thermal back reactivity, with t1/2 values extending up to tens of minutes. Quantum chemical calculations confirm that the variation in thermal back reactivity is governed by the energy difference between open&#8208; and closed&#8208;ring isomers, in accordance with the Bell&#8722;Evans&#8722;Polanyi principle. These findings provide a molecular design strategy for controlling the thermal back reactivity of aza&#8208;diarylethenes, enabling further development of functional photochromic materials.</dc:description>

These findings provide a molecular design strategy for controlling the thermal back reactivity of aza-diarylethenes, enabling further development of functional photochromic materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Binuclear lanthanide complexes as magnetic resonance and optical imaging probes for redox sensing</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report a family of lanthanide(III) complexes that act as redox probes via both magnetic resonance and luminescence outputs. The ligands are functionalized with nitro, azobenzene and azide groups which are reduced to a common aniline product, and each responds to both chemical and biocatalytic reductive conditions at different cathodic onset potentials. By judicious choice of complexed Ln(III), the probes can be optimized either for use in magnetic resonance imaging (Ln = Gd), or as highly efficient turn&#8208;on luminescence probes (Ln = Tb). The Tb(III) analogues are essentially non&#8208;emissive, until reductive generation of the aniline affords a complex which when excited by visible light (488 nm) emits green light with a quantum yield of 45% and millisecond long luminescent lifetimes (ms). The tunable redox response and imaging modalities of these versatile complexes have the potential to open up new approaches to imaging hypoxia.</dc:description>

         <title>Conception and synthesis of sequence&#8208;coded morpholinos</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Solid&#8208;phase morpholino chemistry was explored as a new route to synthesize abiological sequence&#8208;defined oligomers. Two comonomers 0 and 1 containing (i) a chlorophosphoramidate reactive function, (ii) a trityl&#8208;protected morpholine and (iii) a coding substituent (H or CH3 for 0 and 1, respectively) on the morpholine ring were first synthesized and characterized. This binary alphabet was afterwards tested for the synthesis of digitally&#8208;encoded oligomers with different length and sequences. The oligomers were prepared on a modified polystyrene resin, cleaved and characterized by liquid chromatography mass spectrometry. When using a repetitive cycle containing only morpholino coupling and trityl deprotection steps, the formed oligomers were not uniform. Thus, an additional capping step was added. In these conditions, uniform coded sequences were prepared in most cases. Furthermore, the oligomers were analyzed by tandem mass spectrometry. In the studied collision&#8208;induced dissociation conditions, the repeat units of the oligomers undergo two main&#8208;chain fragmentations and full sequence coverage was observed for all studied sequences. Therefore, the binary messages stored in the oligomers could be decoded and retrieved in all cases.</dc:description>

         <title>Core&#8208;Twisted, Cationic Perylene Diimides; Homochiral Dimerisation and Chiroptical Anion Sensing</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Core&#8208;twisted perylene diimides are chiral organic dyes that may be exploited for self&#8208;assembled chiroptical materials or for the enantioselective recognition and sensing of chiral substrates. Discrete self&#8208;assembled dimers and host&#8211;guest complexes of core&#8208;twisted perylene diimides are important for furthering our understanding of this supramolecular chemistry, yet they are rare because the twisted perylene core significantly weakens intermolecular &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions with the PDI&#8217;s &#960;&#8208;surface. To address this challenge, we have installed hydrogen bond donor groups in the PDI&#8217;s bay positions, which directs the formation of a robust, co&#8208;facial and homochiral intermolecular PDI dimer. The structure of this discrete dimer is distinct to previous aggregates of non&#8208;planar PDIs that utilise the imide position for hydrogen bonding. We also uncover the potential of core&#8208;twisted, dicationic PDIs for the enantioselective recognition and chiroptical sensing of chiral anions and investigate the basis of this response via chiral complementarity in the discrete host&#8211;guest complex.</dc:description>

         <title>Total Synthesis of Kanamycins</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Structurally&#8208;modified aminoglycosides, such as kanamycin, have shown promise as antibiotics and premature termination codon read&#8208;through drugs to fight against drug&#8208;resistant bacteria and to treat genetic diseases, respectively. Therefore, research on developing and discovering aminoglycoside antibiotics has recently increased. However, synthetic strategies for controllably positioning the two 1,2&#8208;cis&#8208;glycoside moieties on the symmetrical structure of kanamycin have not yet been established. Herein, we report on a novel route for the total synthesis of kanamycins A and B via regio&#8208; and stereo&#8208;selective introduction of 1,2&#8208;cis&#8208;glycosidic linkages as the key step. We successfully synthesized &#945;(1,6)&#8208;linked glycoside using a 1,2&#8208;anhydro donor and 2&#8208;deoxy&#8208;myo&#8208;inositol 1,3,5&#8208;orthoformate acceptor in the presence of a boronic acid catalyst via desymmetric boron&#8208;mediated aglycon delivery. In addition, we also synthesized &#945;(1,4)&#8208;linked glycoside using its corresponding trichloroacetimidate donor.</dc:description>

         <title>Stabilizing &#945;&#8208;MnO2 Tunnel Structure via Mo&#8211;Zn Synergistic Doping for Highly Efficient Zn2+ Storage</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>To address the rising demand for eco&#8208;friendly and efficient energy storage devices, rechargeable aqueous zinc ion batteries (AZIBs) are emerging as a promising candidate for large&#8208;scale energy storage. &#945;&#8208;MnO2 has attracted extensive attention for its open channels and exceptional Zn2+ storage capacity. However, the electrochemical performance of &#945;&#8208;MnO2 is significantly hindered by severe structural collapse and sluggish reaction kinetics. Herein, we propose a simple hydrothermal approach for co&#8208;doping Mo and Zn into tunnel&#8208;structured MnO2 (MZMO). The ion diffusion kinetics of MZMO are optimized due to ameliorated electrical conductivity by doped cations and introduced oxygen vacancies within the MnO2 lattice. Moreover, Mo and Zn co&#8208;doping stabilizes the MnO2 framework, significantly enhancing its electrochemical performance during prolonged cycling. Charge storage mechanism analysis further validates the extraordinary stability of the MZMO phase structure during the Zn2+/H+ co&#8208;intercalation and deintercalation. The MZMO cathode demonstrates rapid and reversible Zn2+ storage, with a high capacity of 395 mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.2 A g&#8722;1, and the capacity remains at 136 mAh g&#8722;1 after 1000 cycles at 2 A g&#8722;1. This study demonstrates Mo and Zn co&#8208;doping is an effective strategy to enhance the electrochemical performance of MnO2, offering valuable insights for developing other promising cathodes for AZIBs.</dc:description>

         <title>Understanding the Properties of Donor&#8208;Acceptor Substituted Boron Difluoride 3&#8208;Cyanoformazanate Dyes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>p&#8208;Conjugated materials offer attractive traits including semiconductivity, low&#8208;energy light absorption/photoluminescence, and solution processability that render them ubiquitous within the organic electronics field. Among many strategies for property tuning, the creation of asymmetric electronic structures through the installation of donor and acceptor substituents commonly results in low&#8208;energy absorption/photoluminescence bands. Boron difluoride formazanate dyes are&#160; readily synthesized, can be asymmetrically substituted with donor and acceptor groups, and have unexpectedly low&#8208;energy absorption/photoluminescence bands that extend into the near&#8208;infrared. In this study, we prepared a series of donor&#8208;acceptor substituted boron difluoride 3&#8208;cyanoformazanate dyes and compared their properties to symmetric analogues. Our findings suggest that donor&#8208;acceptor derivatives are highly delocalized with properties intermediate of their symmetric counterparts. Furthermore, the data obtained suggests that the N&#8208;aryl substituents act as donors to the strongly accepting boron difluoride formazanate core, regardless of the functional groups appended to them. These properties were reproduced computationally, and while the frontier orbitals calculated for donor&#8208;acceptor dyes were modestly asymmetric, there was no evidence of charge&#8208;transfer character. This work provides significant insight into the unexpected properties of boron difluoride formazanates and reveals that their strongly accepting nature circumvents the predicted augmentation of electronic structure commonly observed for donor&#8208;accepter substituted dyes.</dc:description>

         <title>Strategies for the Synthesis of Mechanically Planar Chiral Rotaxanes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Rotaxanes, belonging to the class of classical mechanically interlocked molecules, exhibit chiral properties that diverge from those of traditional chiral elements, particularly displaying mechanically planar chirality. Their distinctive spatial structure further augments their chiral significance, thereby imparting them with vast potential for applications in the realm of chiral materials and asymmetric catalysis. In recent years, mechanically planar chiral rotaxanes have garnered increasing attention from researchers. In this review, we summarize the recent advancements in obtaining enantiopure mechanically planar chiral rotaxanes. In this regard, chiral separation techniques, the use of chiral auxiliaries, and asymmetric catalytic synthesis have emerged as potent methodologies for constructing chiral rotaxanes, thereby enabling the synthesis of diverse types of mechanically planar chiral rotaxanes. Additionally, we analyze the current challenges faced in this field and look forward to the future development opportunities that lie ahead.</dc:description>
