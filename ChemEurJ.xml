         <title>Unveiling Luminescent IrI and RhI N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene Complexes: Structure, Photophysical Specifics, and Cellular Localization in the Endoplasmic Reticulum</title>

Anticancer NHC complexes: RhI and IrI N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) complexes provide an auspicious class of potential new anticancer agents; however, cellular imaging with luminescent derivatives of these complex types is often hampered by luminescence quenching. Building on an analysis of the parameters for metal&#8208;induced quenching processes, new examples of this complex class are designed with properties suitable for cellular imaging. Their main localization in the endoplasmic reticulum is not only an unprecedented finding but also represents the first ever insight into the cellular localization of Ir(NHC) complexes in the oxidation state +I.







Abstract
Complexes of RhI and IrI of the [M(COD)(NHC)X] type (where M=Rh or Ir, COD=1,5&#8208;cyclooctadiene, NHC=N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene, and X=halide) have recently shown promising cytotoxic activities against several cancer cell lines. Initial mechanism of action studies provided some knowledge about their interaction with DNA and proteins. However, information about their cellular localization remains scarce owing to luminescence quenching within this complex type. Herein, the synthesis of two rare examples of luminescent RhI and IrI [M(COD)(NHC)I] complexes with 1,8&#8208;naphthalimide&#8208;based emitting ligands is reported. All new complexes are comprehensively characterized, including with single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray structures. Steric crowding in one derivative leads to two distinct rotamers in solution, which apparently can be distinguished both by pronounced NMR shifts and by their respective spectral and temporal emission signatures. When the photophysical properties of these new complexes are exploited for cellular imaging in HT&#8208;29 and PT&#8208;45 cancer cell lines, it is demonstrated that the complexes accumulate predominantly in the endoplasmic reticulum, which is an entirely new finding and provides the first insight into the cellular localization of such IrI(NHC) complexes.

         <title>Carbon Origami via an Alumina&#8208;Assisted Cyclodehydrofluorination Strategy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Rational folding of nanographenes has the potential to penetrate the barrier between macro&#8208; and micro&#8208;worlds for the engineering of carbon&#8208;based materials with functional molecular shapes. This work reports that an alumina&#8208;mediated C&#8722;F bond activation strategy is able to tackle this challenge allowing both the effective incorporation of non&#8208;hexagonal rings and the formation of helical structures leading to the folding of nanographenes akin to origami.







Abstract
The synthesis of pristine non&#8208;planar nanographenes (NGs) via a cyclodehydrofluorination strategy is reported and the creation of highly strained systems via alumina&#8208;assisted C&#8722;F bond activation is shown. Steric hindrance could execute an alternative coupling program leading to rare octagon formation offering access to elusive non&#8208;classical NGs. The combination of two alternative ways of folding could lead to the formation of various 3D NG objects, resembling the Japanese art of origami. The power of the presented &#8220;origami&#8221; approach is proved by the assembly of 12 challenging nanographenes that are &#960;&#8208;isoelectronic to planar hexabenzocoronene but forced out of planarity.

         <title>Directed Assembly of Multi&#8208;Walled Nanotubes and Nanoribbons of Amino Acid Amphiphiles Using a Layer&#8208;by&#8208;Layer Approach</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multi&#8208;walled nanotubes and nanoribbons of amino acid amphiphiles are fabricated by using a layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer technique, where successive rigid amphiphile layers are glued together by oppositely charged polyelectrolyte. The resulting well&#8208;defined 1D structures are attractive as potential biocompatible delivery systems and building blocks in nanotechnology.







Abstract
Monodisperse unilamellar nanotubes (NTs) and nanoribbons (NRs) were transformed to multilamellar NRs and NTs in a well&#8208;defined fashion. This was done by using a step&#8208;wise approach in which self&#8208;assembled cationic amino acid amphiphile (AAA) formed the initial NTs or NRs, and added polyanion produced an intermediate coating. Successive addition of cationic AAA formed a covering AAA layer, and by repeating this layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer (LBL) procedure, multi&#8208;walled nanotubes (mwNTs) and nanoribbons were formed. This process was structurally investigated by combining small&#8208;angle neutron scattering (SANS) and cryogenic&#8208;transmission electron microscopy (cryo&#8208;TEM), confirming the multilamellar structure and the precise layer spacing. In this way the controlled formation of multi&#8208;walled suprastructures was demonstrated in a simple and reproducible fashion, which allowed to control the charge on the surface of these 1D aggregates. This pathway to 1D colloidal materials is interesting for applications in life science and creating well&#8208;defined building blocks in nanotechnology.

         <title>Additive&#8208;free Aqueous Dispersions of Two&#8208;Dimensional Materials with Glial Cell Compatibility and Enzymatic Degradability</title>

Bioelectronics: Processing of additive&#8208;free aqueous dispersions of 2D materials like transition metal dichalcogenides and hexagonal boron nitride is demonstrated, and biological implications like cell compatibility and enzymatic degradability are investigated.







Abstract
Water&#8208;dispersible two&#8208;dimensional (2D) materials are desirable for diverse applications. Aqueous dispersions make processing safer and greener and enable evaluation of these materials on biological and environmental fronts. To evaluate the effects of 2D materials with biological systems, obtaining dispersions without additives is critical and has been a challenge. Herein, a method was developed for obtaining additive&#8208;free aqueous dispersions of 2D materials like transition metal dichalcogenides and hexagonal boron nitride (h&#8208;BN). The nanosheet dispersions were investigated through spectroscopic and microscopic methods, along with the role of size on stability. The aqueous media enabled investigations on cytocompatibility and enzymatic degradation of molybdenum disulphide (MoS2) and h&#8208;BN. Cytocompatibility with mixed glial cells was observed up to concentrations of 100&#8197;&#956;g&#8201;mL&#8722;1, suggesting their plausible usage in bioelectronics. Besides, biodegradation using human myeloperoxidase (hMPO) mediated catalysis was investigated through Raman spectroscopy and electron microscopy. The findings suggested that additive&#8208;free 2H&#8208;MoS2 and h&#8208;BN were degradable by hMPO, with 2H&#8208;phase exhibiting better resistance to degradation than the 1T&#8208;phase, while h&#8208;BN exhibited slower degradation. The findings pave a path for incorporating 2D materials in the burgeoning field of transient bioelectronics.

         <title>Enantioselective synthesis of 3&#8208;substituted 3&#8208;amino&#8208;2&#8208;oxindoles via amination with anilines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A chiral  N,N&#8242;  &#8208;dioxide&#8208;nickel(II) complex&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric amination reaction of 3&#8208;bromo&#8208;3&#8208;substituted oxindoles with anilines was developed. A series of alkyl or aryl 3&#8208;amino&#8208;indolinones with quaternary stereocenters were obtained in high yields with excellent ee values in one step (up to 99% yield, up to 96% ee). The method provided a readily route to optically active intermediates of 3&#8208;amino&#8208;2&#8208;oxindole&#8208;based bioactive compounds.

         <title>Experimental and Theoretical Investigation of the Structural and Opto&#8208;electronic Properties of Fe&#8208;Doped Lead&#8208;Free Cs2AgBiCl6 Double Perovskite</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Doubling up: The synthesis and first&#8208;principles density functional theory (DFT) calculations of Fe&#8208;doped, lead&#8208;free dipyramidal shape Cs2AgBiCl6 crystals for photodetector applications are presented. The results of systematic investigation of the crystal structure, morphology, optical properties, band structure, and stability of these materials are discussed.







Abstract
Lead&#8208;free double perovskites have emerged as stable and non&#8208;toxic alternatives to Pb&#8208;halide perovskites. Herein, the synthesis of Fe&#8208;doped Cs2AgBiCl6 lead&#8208;free double perovskites are reported that display blue emission using an antisolvent method. The crystal structure, morphology, optical properties, band structure, and stability of the Fe&#8208;doped double perovskites were investigated systematically. Formation of the Fe&#8208;doped Cs2AgBiCl6 double perovskite is confirmed by X&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD) and X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis. XRD and thermo&#8208;gravimetric analysis (TGA) shows that the Cs2AgBiCl6 double perovskite has high structural and thermal stability, respectively. Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE&#8208;SEM) analysis revealed the formation of dipyramidal shape Cs2AgBiCl6 crystals. Furthermore, energy&#8208;dispersive X&#8208;ray spectroscopy (EDS) mapping shows the overlapping of Cs, Bi, Ag, Fe, and Cl elements and homogenous incorporation of Fe in Cs2AgBiCl6 double perovskite. The Fe&#8208;doped Cs2AgBiCl6 double perovskite shows a strong absorption at 380&#8197;nm. It extends up to 700&#8197;nm, suggesting that sub&#8208;band gap states transition may originate from the surface defect of the doped perovskite material. The radiative kinetics of the crystals was studied using the time&#8208;correlated single&#8208;photon counting (TCSPC) technique. Lattice parameters and band gap value of the Fe&#8208;doped Cs2AgBiCl6 double perovskites predicted by the density functional theory (DFT) calculations are confirmed by XRD and UV/Visible spectroscopy analysis. Time&#8208;dependent photo&#8208;response characteristics of the Fe&#8208;doped Cs2AgBiCl6 double perovskite show fast response and recovery time of charge carriers. We believe that the successful incorporation of Fe in lead&#8208;free, environmentally friendly Cs2AgBiCl6 double perovskite can open a new class of doped double perovskites with significant potential optoelectronics devices fabrication and photocatalytic applications.

         <title>Synthetic Processes toward Nitriles without the Use of Cyanide: A Biocatalytic Concept Based on Dehydration of Aldoximes in Water</title>

Nitrile synthesis with enzymes: An overview of a biocatalytic process technology suitable for the efficient and cyanide&#8208;free synthesis of nitriles by means of dehydration of aldoximes in water is given. A broad range of nitriles are obtained in such biotransformations. Chiral nitriles can be obtained in high enantiomeric excess. The aldoxime substrates are readily available by condensation of aldehydes with NH2OH.







Abstract
While belonging to the most fundamental functional groups, nitriles represent a class of compound that still raises challenges in terms of an efficient, cost&#8208;effective, general and, at the same time, sustainable way for their synthesis. Complementing existing chemical routes, recently a cyanide&#8208;free enzymatic process technology based on the use of an aldoxime dehydratase (Oxd) as a biocatalyst component has been developed and successfully applied for the synthesis of a range of nitrile products. In these biotransformations, the Oxd enzymes catalyze the dehydration of aldoximes as readily available substrates to the nitrile products. Herein, these developments with such enzymes are summarized, with a strong focus on synthetic applications. It is demonstrated that this biocatalytic technology has the potential to &#8220;cross the bridge&#8221; between the production of fine chemicals and pharmaceuticals, on one hand, and bulk and commodity chemicals, on the other.

         <title>Real&#8208;Time Analysis of Polyphenol&#8211;Protein Interactions by Surface Plasmon Resonance Using Surface&#8208;Bound Polyphenols</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 17, Page 5498-5508, March 22, 2021. </description>

SPR sensor chips: Seven plant polyphenols of four different structural classes (ellagitannins, flavanols, proanthocyanidins, and stilbenoids) were synthesized and/or chemically modified at selected carbon centers for enabling their biotinylation and subsequent immobilization in order to examine their interactions with various proteins in real time by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) on streptavidin&#8208;coated sensor chips. The SPR responses unveiled major differences in the modes of association and dissociation of these polyphenol&#8211;protein interactions.







Abstract
A selection of bioactive polyphenols of different structural classes, such as the ellagitannins vescalagin and vescalin, the flavanoids catechin, epicatechin, epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), and procyanidin&#8197;B2, and the stilbenoids resveratrol and piceatannol, were chemically modified to bear a biotin unit for enabling their immobilization on streptavidin&#8208;coated sensor chips. These sensor chips were used to evaluate in real time by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) the interactions of three different surface&#8208;bound polyphenolic ligands per sensor chip with various protein analytes, including human DNA topoisomerase&#8197;II&#945;, flavonoid leucoanthocyanidin dioxygenase, B&#8208;cell lymphoma 2 apoptosis regulator protein, and bovine serum albumin. The types and levels of SPR responses unveiled major differences in the association, or lack thereof, and dissociation between a given protein analyte and different polyphenolic ligands. Thus, this multi&#8208;analysis SPR technique is a valuable methodology to rapidly screen and qualitatively compare various polyphenol&#8211;protein interactions.

         <title>Spin&#8211;Orbit Charge&#8208;Transfer Intersystem Crossing in Anthracene&#8211;Perylenebisimide Compact Electron Donor&#8211;Acceptor Dyads and Triads and Photochemical Dianion Formation</title>

Efficient SOCT&#8208;ISC: Efficient spin&#8211;orbit charge&#8208;transfer intersystem crossing (SOCT&#8208;ISC) was demonstrated in compact perylenebisimide (PBI)&#8211;anthracene (AN) donor&#8211;acceptor dyads/triad. Efficient, reversible, and stepwise formation of the radical anion and dianion of PBI was achieved by photoreduction in the presence of sacrificial electron donor triethanolamine (TEOA).







Abstract
Perylenebisimide (PBI)&#8211;anthracene (AN) donor&#8211;acceptor dyads/triad were prepared to investigate spin&#8211;orbit charge&#8208;transfer intersystem crossing (SOCT&#8208;ISC). Molecular conformation was controlled by connecting PBI units to the 2&#8208; or 9&#8208;position of the AN moiety. Steady&#8208;state, time&#8208;resolved transient absorption and emission spectroscopy revealed that chromophore orientation, electronic coupling, and dihedral angle between donor and acceptor exert a significant effect on the photophysical property. The dyad PBI&#8208;9&#8208;AN with orthogonal geometry shows weak ground&#8208;state coupling and efficient intersystem crossing (ISC, &#934;&#916;=86&#8201;%) as compared with PBI&#8208;2&#8208;AN (&#934;&#916;=57&#8201;%), which has a more coplanar geometry. By nanosecond transient absorption spectroscopy, a long&#8208;lived PBI localized triplet state was observed (&#964;T=139&#8197;&#956;s). Time&#8208;resolved EPR spectroscopy demonstrated that the electron spin polarization pattern of the triplet state is sensitive to the geometry and number of AN units attached to PBI. Reversible and stepwise generation of near&#8208;IR&#8208;absorbing PBI radical anion (PBI&#8722;&#8901;) and dianion (PBI2&#8722;) was observed on photoexcitation in the presence of triethanolamine, and it was confirmed that selective photoexcitation at the near&#8208;IR absorption bands of PBI.&#8722; is unable to produce PBI2&#8722;.

         <title>Zinc Oxide Defect Microstructure and Surface Chemistry Derived from Oxidation of Metallic Zinc: Thin&#8208;Film Transistor and Sensor Behavior of ZnO Films and Rods</title>

Thin&#8208;film transistors: Zinc oxide layers can be obtained conveniently through the oxidation of sputter&#8208;deposited thin films of zinc metal at temperatures between 250 and 450&#8201;&#176;C. Positron annihilation studies hint at vacancy clusters rather than isolated point defects as the dominating feature in the defect chemistry of these films. This allows the description of the influence of annealing temperature on the resulting electronic performance of the semiconducting layers in thin&#8208;film transistors.







Abstract
Zinc oxide thin films are fabricated by controlled oxidation of sputtered zinc metal films on a hotplate in air at temperatures between 250 and 450&#8201;&#176;C. The nanocrystalline films possess high relative densities and show preferential growth in (100) orientation. Integration in thin&#8208;film transistors reveals moderate charge carrier mobilities as high as 0.2&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1s&#8722;1. The semiconducting properties depend on the calcination temperature, whereby the best performance is achieved at 450&#8201;&#176;C. The defect structure of the thin ZnO film can be tracked by Doppler&#8208;broadening positron annihilation spectroscopy as well as positron lifetime studies. Comparably long positron lifetimes suggest interaction of zinc vacancies (VZn) with one or more oxygen vacancies (VO) in larger structural entities. Such VO&#8208;VZn defect clusters act as shallow acceptors, and thus, reduce the overall electron conductivity of the film. The concentration of these defect clusters decreases at higher calcination temperatures as indicated by changes in the S and W parameters. Such zinc oxide films obtained by conversion of metallic zinc can also be used as seed layers for solution deposition of zinc oxide nanowires employing a mild microwave&#8208;assisted process. The functionality of the obtained nanowire arrays is tested in a UV sensor device. The best results with respect to sensor sensitivity are achieved with thinner seed layers for device construction.

         <title>Bambusuril Macrocycles as Mediators of Supramolecular Interactions: Application to the Europium Cage Helicate</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 17, Page 5492-5497, March 22, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bambusuril macrocycle acts as an efficient and selective anion scavenger enabling the investigation of europium cage helicates. This study provides experimental evidence for the template effect of anions during the assembly of the supramolecular cage.







Abstract
Herein, it is shown how bambusurils can be used for tuning and/or characterizing supramolecular systems. Indeed, the addition of bambusurils as anion scavengers to metal&#8208;mediated self&#8208;assemblies allows manipulation of the subtle equilibria in the given system. This is demonstrated for the case of the tetranuclear europium helical cage, which is well suited to different applications. Among the reported results, experimental evidence is provided showing that perchlorate and triflate anions act as a molecular template for the cage assembly. The complexation of inorganic anions with neutral bambusurils resulted in bulky non&#8208;coordinating counterions that may trigger the self&#8208;assembly process or stimulate specific interactions between components. Moreover, bambusuril was able to selectively remove coordinating nitrates from the mixture with non&#8208;coordinating anions, enabling the regeneration of the helical cage.

         <title>Investigation of Luminescent Triplet States in Tetranuclear CuI Complexes: Thermochromism and Structural Characterization</title>

Highly luminescent! The synthesis and an in&#8208;depth photophysical characterization of highly luminescent tetranuclear CuI complexes are presented. For these promising candidates for organic light&#8208;emitting diodes, a pronounced luminescence thermochromism with clearly separated emission bands is observed. The corresponding excited state structures are determined by applying temperature&#8208;dependent time&#8208;resolved step&#8208;scan FTIR spectroscopy in combination with DFT calculations.







Abstract
To develop new and flexible CuI containing luminescent substances, we extend our previous investigations on two metal&#8208;centered species to four metal&#8208;centered complexes. These complexes could be a basis for designing new organic light&#8208;emitting diode (OLED) relevant species. Both the synthesis and in&#8208;depth spectroscopic analysis, combined with high&#8208;level theoretical calculations are presented on a series of tetranuclear CuI complexes with a halide containing Cu4X4 core (X=iodide, bromide or chloride) and two 2&#8208;(diphenylphosphino)pyridine bridging ligands with a methyl group in para (4&#8208;Me) or ortho (6&#8208;Me) position of the pyridine ring. The structure of the electronic ground state is characterized by X&#8208;ray diffraction, NMR, and IR spectroscopy with the support of theoretical calculations. In contrast to the para system, the complexes with ortho&#8208;substituted bridging ligands show a remarkable and reversible temperature&#8208;dependent dual phosphorescence. Here, we combine for the first time the luminescence thermochromism with time&#8208;resolved FTIR spectroscopy. Thus, we receive experimental data on the structures of the two triplet states involved in the luminescence thermochromism. The transient IR spectra of the underlying triplet metal/halide&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge transfer (3M/XLCT) and cluster&#8208;centered (3CC) states were obtained and interpreted by comparison with calculated vibrational spectra. The systematic and significant dependence of the bridging halides was analyzed.

Under pressure: New mixed&#8208;valent fluorides of silver, as well novel structures of known compounds, are predicted to form in the Ag/F2 system at pressures exceeding 1&#8197;GPa.







Abstract
The silver&#8208;fluorine phase diagram has been scrutinized as a function of external pressure using theoretical methods. Our results indicate that two novel stoichiometries containing Ag+ and Ag2+ cations (Ag3F4 and Ag2F3) are thermodynamically stable at ambient and low pressure. Both are computed to be magnetic semiconductors under ambient pressure conditions. For Ag2F5, containing both Ag2+ and Ag3+, we find that strong 1D antiferromagnetic coupling is retained throughout the pressure&#8208;induced phase transition sequence up to 65&#8197;GPa. Our calculations show that throughout the entire pressure range of their stability the mixed&#8208;valence fluorides preserve a finite band gap at the Fermi level. We also confirm the possibility of synthesizing AgF4 as a paramagnetic compound at high pressure. Our results indicate that this compound is metallic in its thermodynamic stability region. Finally, we present general considerations on the thermodynamic stability of mixed&#8208;valence compounds of silver at high pressure.

         <title>Light&#8208;Triggered Nitric Oxide Release by a Photosensitizer to Combat Bacterial Biofilm Infections</title>

Exposing films: A boronic acid&#8208;decorated ruthenium compound, RBNO, functions as both a photosensitizer (PS) and a nitric oxide (NO) releasing agent. RBNO is capable of binding to the bacterial cell envelope and the biofilm matrix. Upon photoirradiation, released NO from the compound can induce bacterial biofilm dispersal. The exposed bacteria are eradicated by the reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated from the PS.







Abstract
Bacterial biofilms are a serious global health concern, often responsible for persistent infections. New strategies to prevent and treat bacterial infections by eradication of the biofilms are urgently needed. A novel ruthenium&#8208;based compound is reported in this study that functions as both a boronic acid&#8208;decorated photosensitizer (PS) and a light&#8208;triggered nitric oxide (NO) releasing agent. The compound can selectively attach to the bacterial membrane and biofilms and it is highly potent at eradicating Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms through the simultaneous release of NO and reactive oxygen species (ROS). The compound, which is more effective than clinical antibiotic tobramycin, also has excellent bacterial specificity and shows no significant cytotoxicity to human cells. The results reveal potential applications of this innovative dual&#8208;functional photoactivated ruthenium compound to combat bacterial biofilm infections.

         <title>Dynamic Covalent Properties of a Novel Indolo[3,2&#8208;b]carbazole Diradical</title>

Design strategies for stimuli&#8208;responsive materials: A dicyanomethyl&#8208;substituted indolo[3,2&#8208;b]carbazole has been synthesized and isolated as a stable &#963;&#8208;dimer. Elongation of the conjugated core increases its diradical character, and the cyclophane C&#8722;C bonds are susceptible to thermal and mechanochemical cleavage. Interestingly, cyclophane/monomer interconversion is accompanied by a colour change. This work sheds light on the dynamic covalent chemistry of &#960;&#8208;conjugated diradicals.







Abstract
This work describes the synthesis and properties of a dicyanomethylene&#8208;substituted indolo[3,2&#8208;b]carbazole diradical ICz&#8208;CN. This quinoidal system dimerises almost completely to (ICz&#8208;CN)2, which contains two long C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp3) &#963;&#8208;bonds between the dicyanomethylene units. The minor open&#8208;shell ICz&#8208;CN component in the solid&#8208;state mixture was identified by EPR spectroscopy. Cyclic voltammetry and UV&#8211;visible spectroelectrochemical data, as well as comparison with reference monomer ICz&#8208;Br reveal that the nature of the one&#8208;electron oxidation of (ICz&#8208;CN)2 at ambient temperature and ICz&#8208;CN at elevated temperature is very similar in all these compounds due to the prevailing localization of their HOMO on the ICz backbone. The peculiar cathodic behaviour reflects the co&#8208;existence of (ICz&#8208;CN)2 and ICz&#8208;CN. The involvement of the dicyanomethylene groups stabilizes the close&#8208;lying LUMO and LUMO+1 of (ICz&#8208;CN)2 and especially ICz&#8208;CN compared to ICz&#8208;Br, resulting in a distinctive cathodic response at low overpotentials. Differently from neutral ICz&#8208;CN, its radical anion and dianion are remarkably stable under ambient conditions. The UV/Vis(&#8211;NIR) electronic transitions in parent (ICz&#8208;CN)2 and ICz&#8208;CN and their different redox forms have been assigned convincingly with the aid of TD&#8208;DFT calculations. The &#963;&#8208;bond in neutral (ICz&#8208;CN)2 is cleaved in solution and in the solid&#8208;state upon soft external stimuli (temperature, pressure), showing a strong chromism from light yellow to blue&#8211;green. Notably, in the solid state, the monomeric diradical species is predominantly formed under high hydrostatic pressure (&gt;1&#8197;GPa).

         <title>C&#8722;H Bond Arylation of Pyrazoles at the &#946;&#8208;Position: General Conditions and Computational Elucidation for a High Regioselectivity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 17, Page 5546-5554, March 22, 2021. </description>

By using a very simple ligand&#8208;free palladium&#8208;catalyst and without directing group installation, the less&#8208;acidic &#946;&#8208;C&#8722;H of pyrazoles is regioselectively arylated (up to 98&#8201;%) conserving untouched &#945;&#8208;C&#8722;H bonds.







Abstract
Direct arylation of most five&#8208;membered ring heterocycles are generally easily accessible and strongly favored at the &#945;&#8208;position using classical palladium&#8208;catalysis. Conversely, regioselective functionalization of such heterocycles at the concurrent &#946;&#8208;position remains currently very challenging. Herein, we report general conditions for regioselective direct arylation at the &#946;&#8208;position of pyrazoles, while C&#8722;H &#945;&#8208;position is free. By using aryl bromides as the aryl source and a judicious choice of solvent, the arylation reaction of variously N&#8208;substituted pyrazoles simply proceeds via &#946;&#8208;C&#8722;H bond functionalization. The &#946;&#8208;regioselectivity is promoted by a ligand&#8208;free palladium catalyst and a simple base without oxidant or further additive, and tolerates a variety of substituents on the bromoarene. DFT calculations revealed that a protic solvent such as 2&#8208;ethoxyethan&#8208;1&#8208;ol significantly enhances the acidity of the proton at &#946;&#8208;position of the pyrazoles and thus favors this direct &#946;&#8208;C&#8722;H bond arylation. This selective pyrazoles &#946;&#8208;C&#8722;H bond arylation was successfully applied for the straightforward building of &#960;&#8208;extended poly(hetero)aromatic structures via further Pd&#8208;catalyzed combined &#945;&#8208;C&#8722;H intermolecular and intramolecular C&#8722;H bond arylation in an overall highly atom&#8208;economical process.

Stacks of selectivity: The azahetero&#8208;Diels&#8211;Alder reaction of 3,5&#8208;dichloro&#8208;6&#8208;pheny&#8208;2H&#8208;1,4&#8208;oxazin&#8208;2&#8208;one with a ethynylbenzene derivative proceeds with high regioselectivity due to &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking interactions between the aromatic rings of each substrate. The transition state of the reaction is demonstrated by DFT calculations, and this regioselective Diels&#8211;Alder reaction is applied to the total synthesis of an antimalarial candidate, dehydroantofine.







Abstract
The total synthesis of dehydroantofine was achieved by employing a novel, regioselective, azahetero Diels&#8211;Alder reaction of easily accessible 3,5&#8208;dichloro&#8208;2H&#8208;1,4&#8208;oxazin&#8208;2&#8208;one with 14&#8201;a as a key step. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that dehydroantofine is a promising candidate as a new antimalarial agent in a biological assay with chloroquine&#8208;resistant Plasmodium falciparum.

         <title>The Indigo Isomer Epindolidione as a Redox&#8208;Active Bridging Ligand for Diruthenium Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 17, Page 5461-5469, March 22, 2021. </description>

Active bridge: Epindolidione shares several non&#8208;innocent ligand features with the isomeric indigo, including metal&#8211;metal bridging by a conjugated &#960; system, multiple electron transfer with near infrared absorption, and radical stability of charged intermediates.







Abstract
Epindolidione (H2L), a heteroatom&#8208;modified analogue of tetracene and a structural isomer of indigo, forms dinuclear complexes with [RuX2]2+, X=bpy (2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine, [1]2+) or pap (2&#8208;phenylazopyridine, [2]2+), in its doubly deprotonated bridging form &#956;&#8208;L2&#8722;. The dications in compounds meso&#8208;[1](ClO4)2 and meso&#8208;[2](ClO4)2, [X2Ru(&#956;&#8208;L)RuX2](ClO4)2, contain five&#8208;membered chelate rings N&#8208;C&#8722;C&#8208;O&#8208;RuII with &#960; bridged metals at an intramolecular distance of 7.19&#8197;&#197;. Stepwise reversible oxidation and reduction is mainly ligand centered (oxidation: L2&#8722;; reduction: X), as deduced from EPR of one&#8208;electron oxidized and reduced intermediates and from UV/Vis/NIR spectroelectrochemistry, supported by TD&#8208;DFT calculation results. The results for [1](ClO4)2 and [2](ClO4)2 are qualitatively similar to the ones observed with the deprotonated indigo&#8208;bridged isomers with their six&#8208;membered chelate ring structures, confirming the suitability of both &#960; systems for molecular electronics applications, low&#8208;energy absorptions, and multiple electron transfers.

         <title>Function&#8208;Oriented and Modular (+/&#8722;)&#8208;cis&#8208;Pseudoguaianolide Synthesis: Discovery of New Nrf2 Activators and NF&#8208;&#954;B Inhibitors</title>

Covalent modification is back, Jack! Function&#8208;oriented synthesis and biological evaluation of pseudoguaianolide analogues is described. The key hydroazulene framework is established by enyne metathesis, functional groups are in place to rapidly establish the key electrophilic warheads, and the route has the potential for preparing analogues in both convergent and divergent fashion. The analogues were found to be low&#8208;micromolar Nrf2 activators and micromolar NF&#8208;&#954;B inhibitors.







Abstract
Described herein is a function&#8208;oriented synthesis route and biological evaluation of pseudoguaianolide analogues. The 10&#8208;step synthetic route developed retains the topological complexity of the natural product, installs functional handles for late&#8208;stage diversification, and forges the key bioactive Michael acceptors early in the synthesis. The analogues were found to be low&#8208;micromolar Nrf2 activators and micromolar NF&#8208;&#954;B inhibitors and dependent on the local environment of the Michael acceptor moieties.

         <title>Design and Development of Axially Chiral Bis(naphthofuran) Luminogens as Fluorescent Probes for Cell Imaging</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 17, Page 5470-5482, March 22, 2021. </description>

Probes for cell imaging: We have designed chiral luminogens in which substituted furans are fused to the BINOL scaffold to generate solid&#8208;state emissive materials with high thermal and photostability as well as colour&#8208;tuneable properties (see figure). One such luminogen shows a high fluorescence quantum yield and large Stokes shift, as well as excellent biocompatibility, being well internalised and uniformly dispersed within MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;231 cancer cells, showing high fluorescence intensity.







Abstract
Designing chiral AIEgens without aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE)&#8208;active molecules externally tagged to the chiral scaffold remains a long&#8208;standing challenge for the scientific community. The inherent aggregation&#8208;caused quenching phenomenon associated with the axially chiral (R)&#8208;[1,1&#8242;&#8208;binaphthalene]&#8208;2,2&#8242;&#8208;diol ((R)&#8208;BINOL) scaffold, together with its marginal Stokes shift, limits its application as a chiral AIE&#8208;active material. Here, in our effort to design chiral luminogens, we have developed a design strategy in which 2&#8208;substituted furans, when appropriately fused with the BINOL scaffold, will generate solid&#8208;state emissive materials with high thermal and photostability as well as colour&#8208;tunable properties. The excellent biocompatibility, together with the high fluorescence quantum yield and large Stokes shift, of one of the luminogens stimulated us to investigate its cell&#8208;imaging potential. The luminogen was observed to be well internalised and uniformly dispersed within the cytoplasm of MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;231 cancer cells, showing high fluorescence intensity.

         <title>Dimesitylborylethynylated Arenes: Unique Electronic and Photophysical Properties Caused by Ethynediyl (C&#8801;C) Spacers</title>

Spaced out! Aromatic hydrocarbons having one or two dimesitylborylethynyl peripherals show rich photophysical and electrochemical properties. Unlike common sterically congested triarylboranes, the inserted ethynediyl spacer cancels the steric hindrance between the bulky dimesitylboryl groups and aromatic rings, leading to effective &#960; conjugation over the B&#8722;C&#8801;C&#8722;Ar linkages. Despite the small structural differences, the benzene, naphthalene, and anthracene derivatives show distinct photophysical behaviors (see scheme).







Abstract
Herein, we report the synthesis and electrochemical and photophysical properties of aromatic hydrocarbons having one or two dimesitylborylethynyl peripherals. The mono&#8208; (1) and diboryl compounds (2), readily prepared by nucleophilic substitution reaction, are fairly stable to air and moisture in the solid state. The inserted ethynediyl (C&#8801;C) spacer cancels the steric hindrance between the bulky dimesitylboryl groups and aromatic rings, leading to effective &#960; conjugation over the B&#8722;C&#8801;C&#8722;Ar linkages, as revealed by cyclic voltammetry. Despite the small structural differences, the photophysical properties of the benzene, naphthalene, and anthracene derivatives are different. Virtually no emission was observed from the benzene derivatives, whereas the anthracene derivatives emitted with high quantum yields both in solution and in the solid state. Notably, the naphthalene derivatives showed aggregation&#8208;induced emission behavior. Unlike the common sterically congested triarylborane derivatives reported so far, the anthracene derivatives showed &#960;&#8211;&#960;*&#8208;type absorption and emission bands, which derive from efficient intramolecular orbital interactions between the boron centers and anthracene moieties, as supported by DFT calculations. As a result, the dimesitylborylethynyl substituents effectively lower the LUMO levels of the aromatic hydrocarbon parts, whereas the HOMO levels are almost unaffected, thereby leading to materials with controllable HOMO&#8211;LUMO gaps.

Going greener: Magnetic CdS quantum dots are designed for application as an efficient photocatalyst for the oxidative amidation of aldehydes by using air as the oxidant under mild conditions. The photocatalyst can be recovered by magnetic separation and successfully reused in five cycles without considerable loss of catalytic activity.







Abstract
A magnetic CdS quantum dot (Fe3O4/polydopamine (PDA)/CdS) was synthesized through a facile and convenient method from inexpensive starting materials. Characterization of the prepared catalyst was performed by means of FTIR spectroscopy, XRD, SEM, TEM, energy&#8208;dispersive X&#8208;ray spectroscopy, and vibrating&#8208;sample magnetometer techniques. Fe3O4/PDA/CdS was found to be a highly active photocatalyst for the amidation of aromatic aldehydes by using air as a clean oxidant under mild conditions. The photocatalyst can be recovered by magnetic separation and successfully reused for five cycles without considerable loss of its catalytic activity.

Detection of combined defect cluster sites in zinc oxide: Oxidation of plasma sputtered zinc generates zinc oxide films in which Doppler broadening positron annihilation spectroscopy (PAS) and positron annihilation life&#8208;time studies (PALS) make it possible to detect oxygen vacancies (Vo) that are in close proximity to zinc vacancies (VZn). They form defect cluster sites acting as shallow acceptors reducing the overall electron conductivity. PAS and PALS is able to correlate semiconducting behavior and microstructure in ZnO thin film transistors. More information can be found in the Full Paper by J.&#8197;J. Schneider et&#8197;al. on page 5422.

         <title>Frontispiece: Synthetic Processes toward Nitriles without the Use of Cyanide: A Biocatalytic Concept Based on Dehydration of Aldoximes in Water</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 17, March 22, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nitriles represent a class of compound that still raises challenges in terms of an efficient, cost&#8208;effective, general and, at the same time, sustainable way for their synthesis. Complementing existing chemical routes, recently a cyanide&#8208;free enzymatic process technology based on the use of an aldoxime dehydratase (Oxd) as a biocatalyst component has been developed and successfully applied for the preparation of a range of nitrile products. In these biotransformations, the Oxd enzymes catalyze the dehydration of aldoximes as readily available substrates to the desired nitrile products. Here, these developments with such enzymes are summarized, with a strong focus on synthetic applications. For more details see the Concept by H. Gr&#246;ger et&#8197;al. on page 5313.

         <title>Frontispiece: Dirhodium Complexes as Panchromatic Sensitizers, Electrocatalysts, and Photocatalysts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 17, March 22, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dinuclear rhodium complexes are attractive candidates as homogeneous panchromatic photosensitizers and photocatalysts. Modification of the coordination sphere of the Rh2(II,II) compounds results in photophysical and redox properties that are highly desirable for electro&#8208; and photocatalysis. Optimization of the Rh2(II,II) catalysts is crucial to realize their future application in devices or systems designed for the production of fuels from sunlight. For more details see the Minireview by C. Turro and S. Lin on page 5379.

         <dc:description>
Transition metal catalyzed C&#8722;C bond forming reactions are a power tool in synthesis of organic compounds. In recent years, this strategy has been successfully applied to the synthesis of several isoindolinone scaffolds. This heterocyclic motif is present in a large variety of naturally occurring, as well as synthetic, biologically and pharmaceutically active, compounds. Due to its crucial role in a number of applications, the synthetic methodologies for accessing this heterocyclic skeleton have received significant attention during the past decade. For more information see the Review article by Risto Savela and Carolina M&#233;ndez&#8208;G&#225;lvez on page 5344.

Catalytic amyloids formed by short peptides and metallocofactors efficiently promote oxidation of organic substrates with activities approaching those of designed heme proteins. Moreover, they are capable of peroxidase&#8208;like activity even in the absence of the cofactors with multiple turnovers. In addition to practical utility, this work supports evolutionary connection between amyloids and early enzymes. For more information see the Communication by I.&#8197;V. Korendovych et&#8197;al. on page 5388.

         <dc:description>
Highly luminescent tetranuclear CuI complexes are discussed in this work, along with their synthesis and in&#8208;depth photophysical characterization. These promising candidates for organic light&#8208;emitting diodes show a huge luminescence thermochromism with completely different emission colors ranging from orange&#8208;red (290&#8197;K) to blue (10&#8197;K). The underlying strongly temperature&#8208;dependent excited state structures are determined by applying time&#8208;resolved step&#8208;scan FTIR spectroscopy in combination with DFT calculations. More information can be found in the Full Paper by W. Klopper, S. Br&#228;se, M. Gerhards, et&#8197;al. on page 5439.

Aromatic hydrocarbons containing one or two dimesitylborylethynyl peripherals possess rich photophysical and electrochemical properties. The inserted ethynediyl (C&#8801;C) spacer canceled steric hindrance between the bulky dimesitylboryl groups and the aromatic rings, leading to effective &#960;&#8208;conjugation over the B&#8722;C&#8801;C&#8722;Ar linkages. Despite the small structural differences, the benzene, naphthalene, and anthracene derivatives showed characteristic photophysical behaviors. More information can be found in the Full Paper by K.

Upon light irradiation, a novel dual&#8208;functional ruthenium compound releases nitric oxide (NO) and reactive oxygen species (ROS). NO induces Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilm dispersal and liberates bacteria. The free&#8208;floating bacteria are subsequently sterilized by ROS. Therefore, the compound can readily eradicate mature biofilms at low concentration, which reduces cytotoxicity to mammalian cells. More information can be found in the Full Paper by Z.&#8208;W.

Isoindolinone motif can found in a large variety biologically and pharmaceutically active compounds. Due to the central role in a number of applications, the synthetic methodologies for accessing this heterocyclic skeleton have received significant attention during the past decade. Herein, the recent advances (2010&#8211;2020) in transition metal catalyzed synthetic methodologies via formation of new C&#8722;C bonds for isoindolinones are reviewed.







Abstract
Isoindolinone structure is an important privileged scaffold found in a large variety of naturally occurring as well as synthetic, biologically and pharmaceutically active compounds. Owing to its crucial role in a number of applications, the synthetic methodologies for accessing this heterocyclic skeleton have received significant attention during the past decade. In general, the synthetic strategies can be divided into two categories: First, direct utilization of phthalimides or phthalimidines as starting materials for the synthesis of isoindolinones; and second, construction of the lactam and/or aromatic rings by different catalytic methods, including C&#8722;H activation, cross&#8208;coupling, carbonylation, condensation, addition and formal cycloaddition reactions. Especially in the last mentioned, utilization of transition metal catalysts provides access to a broad range of substituted isoindolinones. Herein, the recent advances (2010&#8211;2020) in transition metal catalyzed synthetic methodologies via formation of new C&#8722;C bonds for isoindolinones are reviewed.

         <title>Dirhodium Complexes as Panchromatic Sensitizers, Electrocatalysts, and Photocatalysts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 17, Page 5379-5387, March 22, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Paddlewheel dirhodium complexes have been shown to act as single&#8208;chromophore photocatalysts for H2 evolution with red/near&#8208;IR light and as electrocatalysts for the selective reduction of CO2 to HCOOH. Modification of the coordination sphere of Rh2(II,II) complexes renders them versatile candidates as homogeneous panchromatic photosensitizers, photocatalysts, and electrocatalysts.







Abstract
Dinuclear rhodium complexes are attractive candidates as homogeneous panchromatic photosensitizers and photocatalysts. Modification of the coordination sphere of the Rh2(II,II) compounds results in photophysical and redox properties that are highly desirable for electro&#8208; and photocatalysis. Specifically, Rh2(II,II) complexes have shown promising catalytic activity towards proton reduction to generate H2, a clean fuel, and for the selective reduction of CO2 to HCOOH. In addition, paddlewheel Rh2(II,II) complexes provide robust platforms for the design of efficient and stable single&#8208;component photocatalysts. Optimization of the Rh2(II,II) catalysts is crucial to realize their future application in devices or systems designed for the production of fuels from sunlight.

Pick your pnictogen: Recent developments in the chemistry of pnictogen&#8208;functionalised C1 ligands including LnMCARx (A=P, As, Sb, Bi; x=0, 1, 2, 3) are surveyed. Late group&#8197;15 analogues of common LnMC1NRm ligands are rare or entirely elusive novelties.







Abstract
The chemistry of transition metal carbynes, LnM&#8801;CR, has historically been dominated by species bearing hydrocarbyl or amino &#8216;R&#8217; substituents, with other elements appearing only sporadically. In recent years, carbynes and related &#8216;C1&#8217; species bearing other main&#8208;group substituents, particularly heavier elements of the p&#8208;block, have begun to emerge. This review details the chemistry of heavier pnictogen&#8208;functionalised C1 ligands, MCARn (A=P, As, Sb, Bi; n=0&#8211;3), including their syntheses, properties and reactivities, and how these are distinguished from more traditional carbyne complexes. Recent developments in the closely related phospha&#8208;isonitrile LnM(CPR), cya&#8208;phosphide and cya&#8208;arside ligands, LnM(C&#8801;A) (A=P, As), are also discussed.

Lanthanum orthoantimonate is synthesized using a solid&#8208;state synthesis method. To enhance the possible protonic conductivity, samples with the addition of 1&#8197;mol&#8201;% Ca in La&#8208;site are also prepared and characterized by XRD. Dilatometry reveals that the material expands non&#8208;linearly with the temperature, and electrical properties studies show that the material is a proton conductor in oxidizing conditions.







Abstract

To enhance the possible protonic conductivity, samples with the addition of 1&#8197;mol&#8201;% Ca in La&#8208;site were also prepared. The structure was studied by the means of X&#8208;ray diffraction, which showed that both specimens were single phase. The materials crystallized in the space group P21/n. Dilatometry revealed that the material expanded non&#8208;linearly with the temperature. The nature of this deviation is unknown; however, the calculated linear fraction thermal expansion coefficient was 9.56&#215;10&#8722;6&#8201;K&#8722;1. Electrical properties studies showed that the material is a proton conductor in oxidizing conditions, which was confirmed both by temperature studies in wet in dry air, but also by the H/D isotope exchange experiment. The conductivity was rather modest, peaking at the order of 10&#8722;6&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 800&#8201;&#176;C, but this could be further improved by microstructure and doping optimization. This is the first time protonic conductivity in lanthanum orthoantimonates is reported.

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembling Catalytic Peptide Nanomaterials Capable of Highly Efficient Peroxidase Activity</title>

Amyloid&#8211;heme peroxidases: Short, heme&#8208;binding amyloids are capable of highly efficient peroxidase activity (kcat/KM 3&#215;105&#8201;m&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1). Self&#8208;assembly is crucial to catalysis, because non&#8208;assembled controls show no activity, and may provide a route to co&#8208;factor&#8208;free oxidative assemblies.







Abstract
The self&#8208;assembly of short peptides gives rise to versatile nanomaterials capable of promoting efficient catalysis. We have shown that short, seven&#8208;residue peptides bind hemin to produce functional catalytic materials which display highly efficient peroxidation activity, reaching a catalytic efficiency of 3&#215;105&#8201;m&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1. Self&#8208;assembly is essential for catalysis as non&#8208;assembling controls show no activity. We have also observed peroxidase activity even in the absence of hemin, suggesting the potential to alter redox properties of substrates upon association with the assemblies. These results demonstrate the practical utility of self&#8208;assembled peptides in various catalytic applications and further support the evolutionary link between amyloids and modern&#8208;day enzymes.

These results demonstrate the practical utility of self&#8208;assembled peptides in various catalytic applications and further support the evolutionary link between amyloids and modern&#8208;day enzymes.&lt;/p&gt;

Abstract
As a novel Sanger&#8208;type reagent, 2&#8208;fluoro&#8208;5&#8208;nitrophenyldiazonium tetrafluoroborate enabled the versatile functionalization of primary and secondary aliphatic alcohols. Based on a mild nucleophilic aromatic substitution of the fluorine atom under unprecedented, base&#8208;free conditions, the diazonium unit on the aromatic core of the resulting aryl&#8208;alkyl ether could be employed for such diverse transformations as radical C&#8722;H activation and cyclization, as well as palladium catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling reactions.

         <title>Optically Controlled Electron Transfer in a ReI Complex</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 17, Page 5399-5403, March 22, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Optical control of photoinduced electron transfer via selective excitation wavelength is for the first time achieved by incorporation of a tetrathiafulvalene&#8208;fused dipyrido[3,2&#8208;a:2&#8217;,3&#8217;&#8208;c]phenazine ligand to a ReI chromophore. Gating of charge flow over multiple charge&#8208;transfer pathways is a prerequisite to success in photodiodes.







Abstract
Ultrafast optical control of intramolecular charge flow was demonstrated, which paves the way for photocurrent modulation and switching with a highly wavelength&#8208;selective ON/OFF ratio. The system that was explored is a fac&#8208;[Re(CO)3(TTF&#8208;DPPZ)Cl] complex, where TTF&#8208;DPPZ=4&#8217;,5&#8217;&#8208;bis(propylthio)tetrathiafulvenyl[i]dipyrido[3,2&#8208;a:2&#8217;,3&#8217;&#8208;c]phenazine. DFT calculations and AC&#8208;Stark spectroscopy confirmed the presence of two distinct optically active charge&#8208;transfer processes, namely a metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge transfer (MLCT) and an intra&#8208;ligand charge transfer (ILCT). Ultrafast transient absorption measurements showed that the ILCT state decays in the ps regime. Upon excitation to the MLCT state, only a long&#8208;lived 3MLCT state was observed after 80&#8197;ps. Remarkably, however, the bleaching of the ILCT absorption band remained as a result of the effective inhibition of the HOMO&#8211;LUMO transition.

         <title>Novel Arylindigoids by Late&#8208;Stage Derivatization of Biocatalytically Synthesized Dibromoindigo</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 17, Page 5404-5411, March 22, 2021. </description>

From caterpillar to butterfly: A multistep chemoenzymatic cascade of sequential C&#8722;H functionalizations enables the selective synthesis of novel indigoids starting from l&#8208;tryptophan. Modular action of a halogenase and a monooxygenase provides access to acylated dibromoindigo on a preparative scale. Late&#8208;stage diversification by Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling performed in the crude extract gives an array of diarylindigos for potential applications in material science.







Abstract
Indigoids represent natural product&#8208;based compounds applicable as organic semiconductors and photoresponsive materials. Yet modified indigo derivatives are difficult to access by chemical synthesis. A biocatalytic approach applying several consecutive selective C&#8722;H functionalizations was developed that selectively provides access to various indigoids: Enzymatic halogenation of l&#8208;tryptophan followed by indole generation with tryptophanase yields 5&#8208;, 6&#8208; and 7&#8208;bromoindoles. Subsequent hydroxylation using a flavin monooxygenase furnishes dibromoindigo that is derivatized by acylation. This four&#8208;step one&#8208;pot cascade gives dibromoindigo in good isolated yields. Moreover, the halogen substituent allows for late&#8208;stage diversification by cross&#8208;coupling directly performed in the crude mixture, thus enabling synthesis of a small set of 6,6&#8217;&#8208;diarylindigo derivatives. This chemoenzymatic approach provides a modular platform towards novel indigoids with attractive spectral properties.

         <title>Synthesis and Ambiphilic Reactivity of Metalated Diorgano&#8208;Phosphonite Boranes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 17, Page 5412-5416, March 22, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metalation of diorganophosphonite boranes gave unprecedented O&#8208;substituted phosphide reagents as spectroscopically detectable and even isolable species. The target compounds are ambiphiles that undergo P&#8722;O bond functionalisation upon treatment with nucleophiles and act as nucleophilic building blocks towards electrophiles. The latter reactions allow accessing phosphines with unmatched substituent patterns.







Abstract
Unprecedented metalated phosphonite boranes were prepared from PH&#8208;substituted precursors and silyl amides. Although potassium derivatives were thermally stable and could even be isolated and structurally characterised, lithiated analogues proved to be unstable towards self&#8208;condensation under cleavage of LiOR at ambient temperature. Reaction studies revealed that the metalated phosphonite boranes exhibit ambiphilic character. Their synthetic potential as nucleophilic building blocks was demonstrated in the synthesis of the first stannylated phosphonite representing a new structural motif in phosphine chemistry.

&#8220;We developed a seeding methodology for obtaining zinc oxide nanorods. It employs zinc oxide nanoparticles for nanorod growth using a molecular precursor onto the surface of crystalline semiconducting zinc oxide thin films. The obtained ZnO nanorods show a high UV sensitivity and the ZnO thin films a decent field effect transistor performance. Their defect characteristics were studied by positron annihilation spectroscopy.&#8221; Read more about the story behind the cover in the Cover Profile and about the research itself on page&#8197;5422&#8197;ff.

&lt;p&gt;&#8220;&lt;i&gt;We developed a seeding methodology for obtaining zinc oxide nanorods. It employs zinc oxide nanoparticles for nanorod growth using a molecular precursor onto the surface of crystalline semiconducting zinc oxide thin films. The obtained ZnO nanorods show a high UV sensitivity and the ZnO thin films a decent field effect transistor performance. Their defect characteristics were studied by positron annihilation spectroscopy&lt;/i&gt;.&#8221; Read more about the story behind the cover in the Cover Profile and about the research itself on page&#8197;5422&#8197;ff.

         <title>Conformational Switching through the One&#8208;Electron Reduction of an Acridinium&#8208;based, &#947;&#8208;Cationic Phosphine Gold Complex</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Switch it: The reduction of the acridinium&#8208;based &#947;&#8208;cationic phosphine gold chloride complex neutralizes the carbenium unit and affords a stable radical. Due to a perturbation of the electrostatic potential profile of the complex and donor&#8211;acceptor bonding interactions, this reduction alters the complex's conformation, with the linear phosphine&#8208;gold&#8208;chloride moiety undergoing a windshield&#8208;wiper&#8208;type motion over the surface of the acridinium ring.







Abstract
Our efforts in the chemistry of gold complexes featuring ambiphilic phosphine&#8208;carbenium L/Z&#8208;type ligand have led us to consider the reduction of the carbenium moiety as a means to modulate the gold&#8211;carbenium interaction present in these complexes. Here, it was shown that the one&#8208;electron reduction of [(o&#8208;Ph2P(C6H4)Acr)AuCl]+ (Acr=9&#8208;N&#8208;methylacridinium) produces a neutral stable radical, the structure of which showed a marked increase in the Au&#8211;Acr distance. Related structural changes were observed for the phosphine oxide analogue [(o&#8208;Ph2P(O)(C6H4)Acr]+, the reduction of which interfered with the P=O&#8594;carbenium interaction. These structural effects, driven by a reduction&#8208;induced change in the electronic and electrostatic characteristics of the compounds, showed that the charge and accepting properties of the carbenium unit can be modulated. These results highlight the redox&#8208;noninnocence of carbenium Z&#8208;type ligand, a feature that can be exploited to induce specific conformational changes.

         <title>One&#8208;Pot Dual C&#8722;C Coupling Reaction via Site Selective Cascade Formation by PdII&#8208;Cryptate of an Amino&#8208;Ether Heteroditopic Macrobicycle</title>

         <dc:description>
PdII catalysed site selective dual C&#8722;C Coupling in the presence of heteroditopic macrobicycle was achieved to synthesize symmetrical and unsymmetrical conjugated 1,3&#8208;diynes.







Abstract
Selectivity of aryl iodo over ethynyl iodo toward the Suzuki cross coupling reaction is explored by utilizing a palladium complex of amino&#8208;ether heteroditopic macrobicycle. Subsequently, unreacted ethynyl iodide undergoes homocoupling reaction in the same catalytic atmosphere, thereby representing a cascade dual C&#8722;C coupling reaction. Furthermore, this approach is extended for novel one&#8208;pot synthesis of unsymmetrical 1,3&#8208;diynes.

         <title>Rational Molecular Design of Multifunctional Blue&#8208;Emitting Materials Based on Phenanthroimidazole Derivatives.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Deeper blue: On the basis of multifunctional phenanthroimidazole&#8208;based material PTPBPTA, which acts both as a deep&#8208;blue fluorescent emitter and as a host material for phosphors, high&#8208;performance deep&#8208;blue fluorescent organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs), yellow and red phosphorescent OLEDs, and a white OLED were fabricated.







Abstract
High&#8208;performance deep&#8208;blue emitters with external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) exceeding 5&#8201;% are still scarce in organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs). In this work, by introducing a [1,2,4]triazolo[1,5&#8208;a] pyridine (TP) unit at the N1 position of phenanthroimidazole (PI), two luminescent materials, PTPTPA and PTPTPA, were obtained. Systematic photophysical analysis showed that the TP block is suitable for constructing hybridized local and charge&#8208;transfer (HLCT) emitters. Its moderate electron&#8208;withdrawing ability and rigid planar structure can enhance the CT component while ensuring color purity. In addition, compared with PTPTPA, the additional phenyl ring of PTPBPTA not only increased the oscillator strength, but also decreased the Stokes shift. TDDFT calculations pointed out facile reverse intersystem crossing processes in PTPTPA from high&#8208;lying triplet states to the singlet excited state. A nondoped device based on PTPTPA as emitter showed impressive performance with EQEmax of 7.11&#8201;% and CIE coordinates of (0.15, 0.09). At the same time, it was also an efficient host for yellow and red phosphorescent OLEDs. By doping yellow (PPYBA) and red (BTPG) phosphorescent dyes into PTPTPA, a white OLED with a high EQE of 23.85&#8201;% was achieved. The successful design of PTPTPA not only provided an optimization choice for OLED emitters, but also demonstrated the empirical rules for the design of multifunctional deep&#8208;blue emitters.

         <title>Synergistic Effect of Boron Nitride and Carbon Domains in Boron Carbide Nitride Nanotube Supported Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts for Efficient Nitrogen Fixation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single metal atoms supported on boron carbide nitride nanotubes are considered as promising electrocatalysts for N2 reduction to NH3 with high activity and selectivity. The outstanding performance is ascribed to the synergistic effect of boron nitride and carbon domains, which tuned the charge polarization of metal&#8208;atom active site and the electronic properties of material.







Abstract
Developing the low&#8208;cost and efficient single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) for nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) is of great importance while remains as a great challenge. The catalytic activity, selectivity and durability are all fundamentally related to the elaborate coordination environment of SACs. Using first&#8208;principles calculations, we investigated the SACs with single transition metal (TM) atom supported on defective boron carbide nitride nanotubes (BCNTs) as NRR electrocatalysts. Our results suggest that boron&#8208;vacancy defects on BCNTs can strongly immobilize TM atoms with large enough binding energy and high thermal/structural stability. Importantly, the synergistic effect of boron nitride (BN) and carbon domains comes up with the modifications of the charge polarization of single&#8208;TM&#8208;atom active site and the electronic properties of material, which has been proven to be the essential key to promote N2 adsorption, activation, and reduction. Specifically, six SACs (namely V, Mn, Fe, Mo, Ru, and W atoms embedded into defective BCNTs) can be used as promising candidates for NRR electrocatalysts as their NRR activity is higher than the state&#8208;of&#8208;the art Ru(0001) catalyst. In particular, single Mo atom supported on defective BCNTs with large tube diameter possesses the highest NRR activity while suppressing the competitive hydrogen evolution reaction, with a low limiting potential of &#8722;0.62&#8197;V via associative distal path. This work suggests new opportunities for driving NH3 production by carbon&#8208;based single&#8208;atom electrocatalysts under ambient conditions.

Fit in the groove: Hybrid DNAs with Watson&#8211;Crick and purine&#8211;purine base pairs decorated with dendritic side chains are prepared. Space&#8208;demanding side chains introduced into the 7&#8208;position of 5&#8208;aza&#8208;7&#8208;deazaguanine&#8211;isoguanine base pairs are well accommodated in the large groove of purine&#8211;purine DNA and have a positive impact on helix stability.







Abstract
The Watson&#8211;Crick coding system depends on the molecular recognition of complementary purine and pyrimidine bases. Now, the construction of hybrid DNAs with Watson&#8211;Crick and purine&#8211;purine base pairs decorated with dendritic side chains was performed. Oligonucleotides with single and multiple incorporations of 5&#8208;aza&#8208;7&#8208;deaza&#8208;2&#8242;&#8208;deoxyguanosine, its tripropargylamine derivative, and 2&#8242;&#8208;deoxyisoguanosine were synthesized. Duplex stability decreased if single modified purine&#8211;purine base pairs were inserted, but increased if pyrene residues were introduced by click chemistry. A growing number of consecutive 5&#8208;aza&#8208;7&#8208;deazaguanine&#8211;isoguanine base pairs led to strong stepwise duplex stabilization, a phenomenon not observed for the guanine&#8211;isoguanine base pair. Spacious residues are well accommodated in the large groove of purine&#8211;purine DNA tracts. Changes to the global helical structure monitored by circular dichroism spectroscopy show the impact of functionalization to the global double&#8208;helix structure. This study explores new areas of molecular recognition realized by purine base pairs that are complementary in hydrogen bonding, but not in size, relative to canonical pairs.

Gold (I)&#8208;catalyzed higher&#8208;order cycloaddition: 8&#8208;Aryl&#8208;8&#8208;azafulvenes undergo a regioselective gold catalyzed [8+2] cycloaddition with electron&#8208;rich allenamines and ynamides to give dihydrocyclohepta[b]pyrrole derivatives. The cyclization takes place after the nucleophilic attack of the heptafulvene to the electrophilic intermediates formed by the coordination of cationic gold to either allene or triple bond moieties of the unsaturated systems.







Abstract
Gold(I)&#8208;catalyzed higher&#8208;order [8+2] cycloadditions of 8&#8208;aryl&#8208;8&#8208;azaheptafulvenes 1 with allenamides 2 and ynamides 3 were studied. 1,8&#8208;Dihydrocycloheptapyrroles 4 were achieved by a regioselective [8+2] cycloaddition of azaheptafulvenes 1 and allenamides 2 in the presence of (2,4&#8208;ditBuC6H3O)3PAuNTf2 as catalyst. Besides, ynamides 3 and 8&#8208;aryl&#8208;8&#8208;azaheptafulvenes 1, undergo a regioselective [8+2] cycloaddition, to give 2&#8208;amido&#8208;1,4&#8208;dihydrocycloheptapyrroles 7 in the presence of JohnPhosAuNTf2 as catalyst. Both reactions take place with good yields and with a variety of substituents. A plausible mechanism hypothesis suggests a nucleophilic attack of the 8&#8208;azaheptafulvene to the gold activated electron rich allene or alkyne moieties of the allenamide and ynamide, respectively.

The material PTPBTPA is reported in this work, which is shown in blue in the cover picture. It can act as a high&#8208;efficiency deep blue emitter as well as an efficient host material for yellow (the color of the bull in the image) and red (the festive color, indicating the coming of the Spring Festival) phosphors. Combining the blue fluorescence and yellow or red phosphorescence produced high&#8208;performance WOLED, which emits white light as the color of the external circle.

         <title>A DNA&#8208;Encoded Chemical Library Based on Peptide Macrocycles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A DNA&#8208;encoded chemical library (DEL) based on canonical and non&#8208;canonical peptide macrocycles (YO&#8208;DEL) was generated. The single&#8208;stranded format allowed for selections by affinity capture, through a novel selection method exploiting the competition with an antibody fragment and the annealing to a photoreactive moiety which allowed for selections by a photocrosslinking approach. The YO&#8208;DEL yielded ligands against proteins of pharmaceutical interest such as CAIX, HSA and NKp46, a protein expressed on the surface of activated NK&#8208;cells.







Abstract
The synthesis and characterization of a novel DNA&#8208;encoded library of macrocyclic peptide derivatives are described; the macrocycles are based on three sets of proteinogenic and non&#8208;proteinogenic amino acid building blocks and featuring the use of copper(I)&#8208;catalyzed alkyne&#8208;azide cycloaddition (CuAAC) reaction for ring closure. The library (termed YO&#8208;DEL) which contains 1&#8201;254&#8201;838 compounds, was encoded with DNA in single&#8208;stranded format and was screened against target proteins of interest using affinity capture procedures and photocrosslinking. YO&#8208;DEL selections yielded specific binders against serum albumins, carbonic anhydrases and NKp46, a marker of activated Natural Killer cells.

         <title>A High&#8208;Performance Asymmetric Supercapacitor Based on Tungsten Oxide Nanoplates and Highly Reduced Graphene Oxide Electrodes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two dimensional nanomaterials: An asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC, HRG//m&#8208;WO3 ASC) fabricated from tungsten oxide (m&#8208;WO3) nanoplates as a negative electrode and highly reduced graphene oxide (HRG) as a positive electrode material attains specific capacitance of 389&#8197;F&#8201;g&#8722;1 at a current density of 0.5&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1, with an associated high energy density of 93&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 at a power density of 500&#8197;W&#8201;kg&#8722;1 in a wide 1.6&#8197;V operating potential window. In addition, the HRG//m&#8208;WO3 ASC displays long&#8208;term cycling&#8208;stability, maintaining around 92&#8201;% of the original specific capacitance after 5000 galvanostatic charge&#8211;discharge cycles.







Abstract
Tungsten oxide/graphene hybrid materials are attractive semiconductors for energy&#8208;related applications. Herein, we report an asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC, HRG//m&#8208;WO3 ASC), fabricated from monoclinic tungsten oxide (m&#8208;WO3) nanoplates as a negative electrode and highly reduced graphene oxide (HRG) as a positive electrode material. The supercapacitor performance of the prepared electrodes was evaluated in an aqueous electrolyte (1&#8201;m H2SO4) using three&#8208; and two&#8208;electrode systems. The HRG//m&#8208;WO3 ASC exhibits a maximum specific capacitance of 389&#8197;F&#8201;g&#8722;1 at a current density of 0.5&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1, with an associated high energy density of 93&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 at a power density of 500&#8197;W&#8201;kg&#8722;1 in a wide 1.6&#8197;V operating potential window. In addition, the HRG//m&#8208;WO3 ASC displays long&#8208;term cycling stability, maintaining 92&#8201;% of the original specific capacitance after 5000 galvanostatic charge&#8211;discharge cycles. The m&#8208;WO3 nanoplates were prepared hydrothermally while HRG was synthesized by a modified Hummers method.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tungsten oxide/graphene hybrid materials are attractive semiconductors for energy&#8208;related applications. Herein, we report an asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC, HRG//m&#8208;WO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; ASC), fabricated from monoclinic tungsten oxide (m&#8208;WO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) nanoplates as a negative electrode and highly reduced graphene oxide (HRG) as a positive electrode material. The supercapacitor performance of the prepared electrodes was evaluated in an aqueous electrolyte (1&#8201;&lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;m&lt;/span&gt; H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) using three&#8208; and two&#8208;electrode systems. The HRG//m&#8208;WO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; ASC exhibits a maximum specific capacitance of 389&#8197;F&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at a current density of 0.5&#8197;A&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, with an associated high energy density of 93&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at a power density of 500&#8197;W&#8201;kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; in a wide 1.6&#8197;V operating potential window. In addition, the HRG//m&#8208;WO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; ASC displays long&#8208;term cycling stability, maintaining 92&#8201;% of the original specific capacitance after 5000 galvanostatic charge&#8211;discharge cycles. The m&#8208;WO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; nanoplates were prepared hydrothermally while HRG was synthesized by a modified Hummers method.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Probing Multiconfigurational States by Spectroscopy: The Cerium XAS L3&#8208;edge Puzzle</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Ce L3 X&#8208;ray absorption spectra of CeO2 and Ce(C8H8)2 are calculated with relativistic multiconfigurational wavefunction approaches. Calculated spectra are in excellent agreement with experiments. The metal oxidation state in the ground vs. the core&#8208;excited states, and the experimental 4f electron count derived spectroscopically, are fully rationalized.







Abstract
The Ce L3 edge XAS spectra of CeO2 and cerocene [Ce(C8H8)2] were calculated with relativistic ab&#8208;initio multireference wavefunction approaches capable of reproducing the observed spectra accurately. The study aims to resolve the decades&#8208;long puzzle regarding the relationship between the number and relative intensities of the XAS peaks and the 4f electron occupation in the ground state (GS) versus the core&#8208;excited states (ESs). CeO2 and cerocene exemplify the different roles of covalent bonding and wavefunction configurational composition in the observed intensity patterns. Good agreement is found between the calculated GS 4f&#8208;shell occupations and the value derived from XAS measurements using peak areas (nf). The identity of the two&#8208;peaked Ce L3 edge is fully rationalized from the perspective of the relaxed wavefunctions for the GS and core ESs. The states underlying the different peaks differ from each other in a surprisingly simple way that can be associated with 4f1 vs. 4f0 sub&#8208;configurations. Furthermore, part of one of the cerocene spectral peaks is associated with 4f2 sub&#8208;configurations. The pattern therefore reveals excited states that can be interpreted in terms of Ce&#8201;IV and III oxidation numbers, as long assumed, with Ce&#8201;II states additionally appearing in the cerocene spectrum. While this work demonstrates the rough accuracy of the conventional approach to determining nf from Ce L3&#8208;edge XAS, limitations are highlighted in terms of the ultimate accuracy of this approach and the potential of observing new types of excited states. The need to determine the sources of nf by calculations, is stressed.

         <title>Fluorinated Rings: Conformation and Application</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fluorine&#8208;containing compounds are widely used in different applications owing to their unique properties and effects. A particularly interesting feature is the impact of the C&#8722;F bond on the conformational preference when incorporated with organic molecules. In this Review, the conformational behavior of fluorinated aliphatic carbo&#8208; and heterocyclic systems will be discussed through presentation of the most recent applications.







Abstract
The introduction of fluorine atoms into molecules and materials across many fields of academic and industrial research is now commonplace, owing to their unique properties. A particularly interesting feature is the impact of fluorine substitution on the relative orientation of a C&#8722;F bond when incorporated into organic molecules. In this Review, we will be discussing the conformational behavior of fluorinated aliphatic carbo&#8208; and heterocyclic systems. The conformational preference of each system is associated with various interactions introduced by fluorine substitution such as charge&#8208;dipole, dipole&#8208;dipole, and hyperconjugative interactions. The contribution of each interaction on the stabilization of the fluorinated alicyclic system, which manifests itself in low conformations, will be discussed in detail. The novelty of this feature will be demonstrated by presenting the most recent applications.

         <title>Directed Design of a AuI Complex with a Reduced Mesoionic Carbene Radical Ligand: Insights from 1,2,3&#8208;Triazolylidene Selenium Adducts and Extensive Electrochemical Investigations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>

MIC drop! The first example and the spectroscopic characterization of a metal&#8208;bound as well as selenium&#8208;bound mesoionic carbene (MIC)&#8208;radical of the 1,2,3&#8208;triazol&#8208;5&#8208;ylidene type is reported. Design principles for stabilizing such radicals are presented as well.







Abstract
Carbene&#8208;based radicals are important for both fundamental and applied chemical research. Herein, extensive electrochemical investigations of nine different 1,2,3&#8208;triazolylidene selenium adducts are reported. It is found that the half&#8208;wave potentials of the first reduction of the selones correlate with their calculated LUMO levels and the LUMO levels of the corresponding triazolylidene&#8208;based mesoionic carbenes (MICs). Furthermore, unexpected quasi&#8208;reversibility of the reduction of two triazoline selones, exhibiting comparable reduction potentials, was discovered. Through UV/Vis/NIR and EPR spectroelectrochemical investigations supported by DFT calculations, the radical anion was unambiguously assigned to be triazoline centered. This electrochemical behavior was transferred to a triazolylidene&#8208;type MIC&#8208;gold phenyl complex resulting in a MIC&#8208;radical coordinated AuI species. Apart from UV&#8208;Vis&#8208;NIR and EPR spectroelectrochemical investigations of the reduction, the reduced gold&#8208;coordinated MIC radical complex was also formed in situ in the bulk through chemical reduction. This is the first report of a monodentate triazolylidene&#8208;based MIC ligand that can be reduced to its anion radical in a metal complex. The results presented here provide design principles for stabilizing radicals based on MICs.

         <title>Designed Construction of SrTiO3/SrSO4/Pt Heterojunctions with Boosted Photocatalytic H2 Evolution Activity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel photocatalyst is designed with consideration of heterojunction band matching and porous structure. The SrTiO3/SrSO4 heterojunction using Pt as the co&#8208;catalyst reaches 396.82&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1, which is 16&#8197;times higher than that of SrTiO3/Pt. It is proposed that the presence of SrSO4 provides extra channels for electron transportation as well as promoting photocatalytic activity.







Abstract
Efficient separation of photogenerated electron&#8211;hole pairs is a crucial factor for high&#8208;performance photocatalysts. Effective electron&#8211;hole separation and migration could be achieved by heterojunctions with suitable band structures. Herein, a porous SrTiO3/SrSO4 heterojunction is prepared by a sol&#8208;gel method at room temperature followed by an annealing process. XRD characterization suggests high crystallinity of the heterostructure. A well&#8208;defined interface between the two phases is confirmed by high&#8208;resolution (HR)TEM. The photocatalytic H2 evolution productivity of the SrTiO3/SrSO4 heterojunction with Pt as co&#8208;catalyst reaches 396.82&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1, which is 16&#8197;times higher than that of SrTiO3/Pt. The boosted photocatalytic activity of SrTiO3/SrSO4/Pt can be ascribed to the presence of SrSO4, which promotes the transfer and migration of photogenerated carriers by forming the heterojunction and porous structure, which provides a large amount of active sites. This novel porous heterostructure brings new ideas for the development of high&#8208;efficiency photocatalysts for H2 release.

XRD characterization suggests high crystallinity of the heterostructure. A well&#8208;defined interface between the two phases is confirmed by high&#8208;resolution (HR)TEM. The photocatalytic H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; evolution productivity of the SrTiO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;/SrSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; heterojunction with Pt as co&#8208;catalyst reaches 396.82&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, which is 16&#8197;times higher than that of SrTiO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;/Pt. The boosted photocatalytic activity of SrTiO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;/SrSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;/Pt can be ascribed to the presence of SrSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, which promotes the transfer and migration of photogenerated carriers by forming the heterojunction and porous structure, which provides a large amount of active sites. This novel porous heterostructure brings new ideas for the development of high&#8208;efficiency photocatalysts for H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; release.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Organic Nanoparticles with Persistent Luminescence for In Vivo Afterglow Imaging&#8208;Guided Photodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Afterglow organic nanoparticles (ONPs) with long lifetime and near&#8208;infrared (NIR) emission offered high signal&#8208;to&#8208;background ratio and good tissue penetration for afterglow imaging&#8208;guided photodynamic therapy (PDT) in vivo. Owing to strong afterglow luminescence and abundant singlet oxygen generation from the ONPs upon NIR laser irradiation, they have shown effective suppression of tumor growth after imaging&#8208;guided PDT in mice with minimal damage to major organs.







Abstract
Optical imaging&#8208;guided photodynamic therapy (PDT), with precise localization and non&#8208;invasive treatment of tumors, is an emerging technique with great potential for cancer therapy. However, impaired by tissue auto&#8208;fluorescence that causes low signal&#8208;to&#8208;background ratio (SBR), most fluorescence imaging systems show poor sensitivity to tumors in vivo. In this study, we synthesized organic nanoparticles (ONPs) with persistent luminescence and good biocompatibility for afterglow imaging&#8208;guided PDT. The ONPs displayed near&#8208;infrared light emission with half&#8208;life time at minute level, which offered high SBR and good tissue penetration for in vivo afterglow tumor imaging. Taking advantage of their abundant singlet oxygen generation by NIR laser irradiation guided to the tumor sites, the ONPs also enabled imaging&#8208;guided PDT for efficient suppression of tumor growth in mice with minimal damage to major organs.

         <title>Lighting up the plasma membrane: Development and applications of fluorescent ligands for transmembrane proteins.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Despite the fact that transmembrane proteins represent the main therapeutic targets for decades, complete and in&#8208;depth knowledge about their biochemical and pharmacological profiling is not fully available. In this regard, target&#8208;tailored small&#8208;molecule fluorescent ligands are a viable approach to fill in the missing pieces of the puzzle. Such tools, coupled with the ability of high&#8208;precision optical techniques to image with an unprecedented resolution at a single&#8208;molecule level, helped unraveling many of the conundrums related to plasma proteins&#8217; life&#8208;cycle and druggability. Herein, we review the recent progress made during the last two decades in fluorescent ligand design and potential applications in fluorescence microscopy of voltage&#8208;gated ion channels, ligand&#8208;gated ion channels and G&#8208;coupled protein receptors.</dc:description>

         <title>Naphthalenediimides with High Fluorescence Quantum Yield: Bright&#8208;Red, Stable, and Responsive Fluorescent Dyes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first example of a bis&#8208;NH2 core&#8208;substituted naphthalenediimide (NDI) with remarkably high 
. A simple synthetic protocol to NH2&#8208;substituted NDIs is described. Dependent on the substituents, fluorescence can be tuned from bright&#8208;green to the red/NIR region and the 
 modulated by two orders of magnitude. These fluorophores show large Stokes&#8208;shift and great responsiveness to solvent polarity.







Abstract
The naphthalenediimide (NDI) scaffold in contrast to its higher congeners possess low&#8208;fluorescence. In spite of elegant synthetic developments, a highly emissive NDI is quite rare to find, as well as, a green&#8208;light&#8208;emitting NDI is yet to be explored. Herein, we report a novel class of symmetric and asymmetric NH2&#8208;substituted core&#8208;NDIs (1&#8211;5) with tunable fluorescence in the visible region and extending to the NIR frontier. Importantly, the bis&#8208;NH2&#8208;substituted NDI 2 revealed quantum yield, 
 of &#8776;81 and &#8776;68&#8201;% in toluene and DMSO, respectively, suggesting versatility of the fluorophore in a wide range of solvent polarity. The dye 1 is shown to be the first NDI&#8208;based green&#8208;light emitter. The donor piperidine group in 5 diminish the 
 by 40&#8208;fold providing a lever to modulate the excited&#8208;state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT) process. Our synthetic protocol applies a Pd catalyst and a benign hydride source simplifying the non&#8208;trivial &#8722;NH2 group integration at the NDI&#8208;core. TD&#8208;DFT calculations predicted strong intramolecular hydrogen bonds in the excited state in the bulk nonpolar medium and responsiveness to solvent polarity. The maximization of the NDI emission outlined here would further boost the burgeoning repertoire of applications of the NDI scaffold.

         <title>Uranium versus Thorium: Synthesis and Reactivity of [&#951;5&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;(Me3C)3C5H2]2U[&#951;2&#8208;C2Ph2]</title>

         <dc:description>
The intrinsic reactivity of a stable uranium metallacyclopropene complex, [&#951;5&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;(Me3C)3C5H2]2U(&#951;2&#8208;C2Ph2), was evaluated and compared to that of other uranium and thorium metallacyclopropenes. Although structurally similar, the thorium and uranium metallacyclopropenes exhibit distinctively different reactivity.







Abstract
The synthesis, electronic structure, and reactivity of a uranium metallacyclopropene were comprehensively studied. Addition of diphenylacetylene (PhC&#8801;CPh) to the uranium phosphinidene metallocene [&#951;5&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;(Me3C)3C5H2]2U=P&#8208;2,4,6&#8208;tBu3C6H2 (1) yields the stable uranium metallacyclopropene, [&#951;5&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;(Me3C)3C5H2]2U[&#951;2&#8208;C2Ph2] (2). Based on density functional theory (DFT) results the 5f orbital contributions to the bonding within the metallacyclopropene U&#8208;(&#951;2&#8208;C=C) moiety increases significantly compared to the related ThIV compound [&#951;5&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;(Me3C)3C5H2]2Th[&#951;2&#8208;C2Ph2], which also results in more covalent bonds between the [&#951;5&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;(Me3C)3C5H2]2U2+ and [&#951;2&#8208;C2Ph2]2&#8722; fragments. Although the thorium and uranium complexes are structurally closely related, different reaction patterns are therefore observed. For example, 2 reacts as a masked synthon for the low&#8208;valent uranium(II) metallocene [&#951;5&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;(Me3C)3C5H2]2UII when reacted with Ph2E2 (E=S, Se), alkynes and a variety of hetero&#8208;unsaturated molecules such as imines, ketazine, bipy, nitriles, organic azides, and azo derivatives. In contrast, five&#8208;membered metallaheterocycles are accessible when 2 is treated with isothiocyanate, aldehydes, and ketones.

&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;(Me&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;U&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt; when reacted with Ph&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;E&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (E=S, Se), alkynes and a variety of hetero&#8208;unsaturated molecules such as imines, ketazine, bipy, nitriles, organic azides, and azo derivatives. In contrast, five&#8208;membered metallaheterocycles are accessible when &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt; is treated with isothiocyanate, aldehydes, and ketones.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Sulfur Tetrahydride and Allied Superhydride Clusters: When Resonance Takes Precedence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
H2S + H2 reactants are (computationally) found to form metastable &#8220;superhydride&#8221; SH4 that in turn forms (SH4&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H2S)n = &#8220;(SH3)2n&#8221; clusters with well&#8208;adapted (x,y,z) geometry for crystallization. Natural resonance theory (NRT) clarifies the uniqueness of the hypervalent bonding in this species.







Abstract
Sulfur offers a variety of bonding surprises compared to the parent oxygen atom of the chalcogen family. In the present work, we employ standard quantum chemistry methods to characterize formation of previously unrecognized sulfur tetrahydride (C4v&#8208;symmetric SH4) from hydrogen sulfide (H2S) and molecular hydrogen (H2) on the ground state potential energy surface. The unusual intramolecular interactions of SH4 defy Lewis&#8208;like bonding conceptions, exhibiting the dominance of resonance&#8208;type donor&#8208;acceptor delocalizations well beyond those of SF4 (C2v sawhorse geometry) and other known tetrahalides. The distressed character of SH4 bonding also leads to exotic intermolecular structural motifs in clusters of pure (SH4)n and mixed (SH4&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H2S)n composition. We evaluate structural, spectroscopic, and electronic properties for various 2D/3D coordination patterns and discuss how (SH4&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H2S)n&#8208;type building blocks may relate to recent experimental studies of superconductivity in high&#8208;pressure materials of &#8220;SH3&#8221; stoichiometry.

         <title>Tuning the Properties of MOF&#8208;808 via Defect Engineering and Metal Nanoparticle Encapsulation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Defects and metal nanoparticle encapsulations have been shown to have significant impacts on structure, texture, morphology and reactivity of the synthesized MOFs. Control over defects creation and metal nanoparticle encapsulations can become useful avenues to adjust the properties of MOFs.







Abstract
Defect engineering and metal encapsulation are considered as valuable approaches to fine&#8208;tune the reactivity of metal&#8211;organic frameworks. In this work, various MOF&#8208;808 (Zr) samples are synthesized and characterized with the final aim to understand how defects and/or platinum nanoparticle encapsulation act on the intrinsic and reactive properties of these MOFs. The reactivity of the pristine, defective and Pt encapsulated MOF&#8208;808 is quantified with water adsorption and CO2 adsorption calorimetry. The results reveal strong competitive effects between crystal morphology and missing linker defects which in turn affect the crystal morphology, porosity, stability, and reactivity. In spite of leading to a loss in porosity, the introduction of defects (missing linkers or Pt nanoparticles) is beneficial to the stability of the MOF&#8208;808 towards water and could also be advantageously used to tune adsorption properties of this MOF family.

         <title>Synthetic Approaches to Selenoesters</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Selenoesters are an important class of compounds that have wide possibilities for chemical transformations, being considered excellent building blocks for the synthesis of more complex molecules. In this review, an overview of the available methods for the synthesis of selenoesters will be presented. This overview is hoped to serve as a source of inspiration for the development of new strategies for the synthesis of this type of compound, as well as for their use as building blocks in synthesis.







Abstract
Selenoesters are compounds of great synthetic relevance since they can be used in several types of chemical transformations and mainly due to their great capacity in the formation of acyl radicals. Therefore, the scientific community has been developing several methods for the synthesis of this class of molecules. This review will address the synthesis of these compounds from different starting materials, such as carboxylic acids derivatives (acid chlorides and anhydrides), aldehydes, selenoacetylenes and miscellaneous methods.

         <title>Regioselective Synthesis of 1,2,3,4&#8208;Tetrasubstituted Arenes by Vicinal Functionalization of Arynes Derived from Aryl(Mes)iodonium Salts**
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Densely functionalized 1,2,3,4&#8208;substituted arenes are found in societally important molecules but are challenging to synthesize. This work reports on a method that uses aryl(Mes)iodonium salts as an aryne precursor via regioselective deprotonation. Various arynophiles are used and result in formation of C&#8722;C, C&#8722;N, C&#8722;O, C&#8722;Cl, and C&#8722;Si bonds; mechanistic insights from experiments and DFT calculations are provided.







Abstract
Herein, the synthesis of 1,2,3,4&#8208;tetrasubstituted benzenoid rings, motifs found in pharmaceutical, agrochemical, and natural products, is described.[1] In the past, the regioselective syntheses of such compounds have been a significant challenge. This work reports a method using substituted arynes derived from aryl(Mes)iodonium salts to access a range of densely functionalized 1,2,3,4&#8208;tetrasubstituted benzenoid rings. Significantly, it was found that halide substituents are compatible under these conditions, enabling post&#8208;synthetic elaboration via palladium&#8208;catalyzed coupling. This concise strategy is predicated on two regioselective events: 1)&#8197;ortho&#8208; deprotonation of aryl(Mes)iodonium salts to generate a substituted aryne intermediate, and 2)&#8197;regioselective trapping of said arynes, thereby improving previously reported reaction conditions to generate arynes at room temperature and in shorter reaction times. Density functional theory (DFT) computations and linear free energy relationship (LFER) analysis suggest the regioselectivity of deprotonation is influenced by both proximal and distal ring substituents on the aryne precursor. A competition experiment further reveals the role of arene substituents on relative reactivity of aryl(Mes)iodoniums as aryne precursors.

         <title>Scalable Synthesis of Porous SiFe@C Composite with Excellent Lithium Storage</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Threesome is impressive: A novel and scalable strategy for the fabrication of porous SiFe@C composite with mesoporous structure is reported. The conductive phase of FeSi2 is partially retained; together with a uniform carbon layer excellent lithium storage is achieved.







Abstract
Utilizing cost&#8208;effective raw materials to prepare high&#8208;performance silicon&#8208;based anode materials for lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) is both challenging and attractive. Herein, a porous SiFe@C (pSiFe@C) composite derived from low&#8208;cost ferrosilicon is prepared via a scalable three&#8208;step procedure, including ball milling, partial etching, and carbon layer coating. The pSiFe@C material integrates the advantages of the mesoporous structure, the partially retained FeSi2 conductive phase, and a uniform carbon layer (12&#8211;16&#8197;nm), which can substantially alleviate the huge volume expansion effect in the repeated lithium&#8208;ion insertion/extraction processes, effectively stabilizing the solid&#8211;electrolyte interphase (SEI) film and markedly enhancing the overall electronic conductivity of the material. Benefiting from the rational structure, the obtained pSiFe@C hybrid material delivers a reversible capacity of 1162.1&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 200&#8197;cycles at 500&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1, with a higher initial coulombic efficiency of 82.30&#8201;%. In addition, it shows large discharge capacities of 803.1 and 600.0&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 500&#8197;cycles at 2 and 4&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1, respectively, manifesting an excellent electrochemical lithium storage.

     alt="Scalable Synthesis of Porous SiFe@C Composite with Excellent Lithium Storage"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Threesome is impressive&lt;/b&gt;: A novel and scalable strategy for the fabrication of porous SiFe@C composite with mesoporous structure is reported. The conductive phase of FeSi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is partially retained; together with a uniform carbon layer excellent lithium storage is achieved.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Utilizing cost&#8208;effective raw materials to prepare high&#8208;performance silicon&#8208;based anode materials for lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) is both challenging and attractive. Herein, a porous SiFe@C (pSiFe@C) composite derived from low&#8208;cost ferrosilicon is prepared via a scalable three&#8208;step procedure, including ball milling, partial etching, and carbon layer coating. The pSiFe@C material integrates the advantages of the mesoporous structure, the partially retained FeSi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; conductive phase, and a uniform carbon layer (12&#8211;16&#8197;nm), which can substantially alleviate the huge volume expansion effect in the repeated lithium&#8208;ion insertion/extraction processes, effectively stabilizing the solid&#8211;electrolyte interphase (SEI) film and markedly enhancing the overall electronic conductivity of the material. Benefiting from the rational structure, the obtained pSiFe@C hybrid material delivers a reversible capacity of 1162.1&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; after 200&#8197;cycles at 500&#8197;mA&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, with a higher initial coulombic efficiency of 82.30&#8201;%. In addition, it shows large discharge capacities of 803.1 and 600.0&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; after 500&#8197;cycles at 2 and 4&#8197;A&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, respectively, manifesting an excellent electrochemical lithium storage. This work provides a good prospect for the commercial production of silicon&#8208;based anode materials for LIBs with a high lithium&#8208;storage capacity.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Chemical Bonding in Homoleptic Carbonyl Cations [M{Fe(CO)5}2]+ (M=Cu, Ag, Au)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Donation of an electron pair from the HOMO of [Fe(CO)5]2 to the 4s LUMO of Cu+ giving the (+,+) component of the Fe&#8208;Cu&#8208;Fe &#963; bond in [Cu{Fe(CO)5}2]+. The associated charge flow with the direction red&#8594;blue is given by the deformation density.







Abstract
Syntheses of the copper and gold complexes [Cu{Fe(CO)5}2][SbF6] and [Au{Fe(CO)5}2][HOB{3,5&#8208;(CF3)2C6H3}3] containing the homoleptic carbonyl cations [M{Fe(CO)5}2]+ (M=Cu, Au) are reported. Structural data of the rare, trimetallic Cu2Fe, Ag2Fe and Au2Fe complexes [Cu{Fe(CO)5}2][SbF6], [Ag{Fe(CO)5}2][SbF6] and [Au{Fe(CO)5}2][HOB{3,5&#8208;(CF3)2C6H3}3] are also given. The silver and gold cations [M{Fe(CO)5}2]+ (M=Ag, Au) possess a nearly linear Fe&#8208;M&#8208;Fe&#8217; moiety but the Fe&#8208;Cu&#8208;Fe&#8217; in [Cu{Fe(CO)5}2][SbF6] exhibits a significant bending angle of 147&#176; due to the strong interaction with the [SbF6]&#8722; anion. The Fe(CO)5 ligands adopt a distorted square&#8208;pyramidal geometry in the cations [M{Fe(CO)5}2]+, with the basal CO groups inclined towards M. The geometry optimization with DFT methods of the cations [M{Fe(CO)5}2]+ (M=Cu, Ag, Au) gives equilibrium structures with linear Fe&#8208;M&#8208;Fe&#8217; fragments and D2 symmetry for the copper and silver cations and D4d symmetry for the gold cation. There is nearly free rotation of the Fe(CO)5 ligands around the Fe&#8208;M&#8208;Fe&#8217; axis. The calculated bond dissociation energies for the loss of both Fe(CO)5 ligands from the cations [M{Fe(CO)5}2]+ show the order M=Au (De=137.2&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1)&gt;Cu (De=109.0&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1)&gt;Ag (De=92.4&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1). The QTAIM analysis shows bond paths and bond critical points for the M&#8722;Fe linkage but not between M and the CO ligands. The EDA&#8208;NOCV calculations suggest that the [Fe(CO)5]&#8594;M+&#8592;[Fe(CO)5] donation is significantly stronger than the [Fe(CO)5]&#8592;M+&#8594;[Fe(CO)5] backdonation. Inspection of the pairwise orbital interactions identifies four contributions for the charge donation of the Fe(CO)5 ligands into the vacant (n)s and (n)p AOs of M+ and five components for the backdonation from the occupied (n&#8208;1)d AOs of M+ into vacant ligand orbitals.

         <title>Fluorogenic Squaraine Dendrimers for Background&#8208;Free Imaging of Integrin Receptors in Cancer Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fluorogenic dendrimer probe for imaging membrane receptors has been developed. It combines eight squaraine dyes that undergo polarity&#8208;dependent aggregation&#8211;disaggregation within the dendrimer, resulting in OFF&#8211;ON fluorescence response to a biomolecular target. It enables integrin&#8208;specific imaging of cancer cells with high signal&#8208;to&#8208;background ratio.







Abstract
To overcome the limited brightness of existing fluorogenic molecular probes for biomolecular targets, we introduce a concept of fluorogenic dendrimer probe, which undergoes polarity&#8208;dependent switching due to intramolecular aggregation&#8208;caused quenching of its fluorophores. Based on a rational design of dendrimers with four and eight squaraine dyes, we found that octamer bearing dyes through a sufficiently long PEG(8) linker displays &gt;400&#8208;fold fluorescence enhancement from water to non&#8208;polar dioxane. High extinction coefficient (&#8776;2,300,000&#8201;m&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;1) resulted from eight squaraine dyes and quantum yield (&#8776;25&#8201;%) make this octamer the brightest environment&#8208;sensitive fluorogenic molecule reported to date. Its conjugate with cyclic RGD used at low concentration (3&#8197;nm) enables integrin&#8208;specific fluorescence imaging of cancer cells with high signal&#8208;to&#8208;background ratio. The developed dendrimer probe is a &#8220;golden middle&#8221; between molecular probes and nanoparticles, combining small size, turn&#8208;on response and high brightness, important for bioimaging.

         <title>Specific Ion&#8211;Protein Interactions Influence Bacterial Ice Nucleation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Effects of ions on bacterial ice nucleation: Freezing droplet experiments, sum&#8208;frequency generation spectroscopy, and molecular dynamic simulations were used to demonstrate that ions can profoundly influence the efficiency of bacterial ice nucleators in a manner that follows the Hofmeister series. The different effects are due to specific interactions of the ions with ice&#8208;nucleating proteins on the surface of the bacteria.







Abstract
Ice nucleation&#8208;active bacteria are the most efficient ice nucleators known, enabling the crystallization of water at temperatures close to 0&#8201;&#176;C, thereby overcoming the kinetically hindered phase transition process at these conditions. Using highly specialized ice&#8208;nucleating proteins (INPs), they can cause frost damage to plants and influence the formation of clouds and precipitation in the atmosphere. In nature, the bacteria are usually found in aqueous environments containing ions. The impact of ions on bacterial ice nucleation efficiency, however, has remained elusive. Here, we demonstrate that ions can profoundly influence the efficiency of bacterial ice nucleators in a manner that follows the Hofmeister series. Weakly hydrated ions inhibit bacterial ice nucleation whereas strongly hydrated ions apparently facilitate ice nucleation. Surface&#8208;specific sum&#8208;frequency generation spectroscopy and molecular dynamics simulations reveal that the different effects are due to specific interactions of the ions with the INPs on the surface of the bacteria. Our results demonstrate that heterogeneous ice nucleation facilitated by bacteria strongly depends upon the nature of the ions, and specific ion&#8211;protein interactions are essential for the complete description of heterogeneous ice nucleation by bacteria.

         <title>Metal Cation Valency Dependence in Morphology Evolution of Cu2&#8722;xS Nanodisk Seeds and Their Pseudomorphic Cation Exchanges</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tin cation valency&#8208;dependent morphology evolution of Cu2&#8722;xS nanodisk seeds was initially developed. Subsequent pseudomorphic full/partial cation exchanges with Zn2+ and Cd2+ to produce traditionally inaccessible nanostructures were reported as well.







Abstract
A crucial parameter in the design of semiconductor nanoparticles (NPs) with controllable optical, magnetic, electronic, and catalytic properties is the morphology. Herein, we demonstrate the potential of additive metal cations with variable valency to direct the morphology evolution of copper&#8208;deficient Cu2&#8722;xS nanoparticles in the process of seed&#8208;mediated growth. In particular, the djurleite Cu1.94S seed could evolve from disk into tetradecahedron in the presence of tin(IV) cations, whereas they merely formed sharp hexagonal nanodisks with tin(II) cations. In addition to djurleite Cu1.94S, the tin(IV) cations could be generalized to direct the growth of roxbyite Cu1.8S and covellite CuS nanodisk seeds into tetradecahedra. We further perform pseudomorphic cation exchanges of Cu1.94S tetradecahedra with Zn2+ and Cd2+ to produce polyhedral zinc sulfide (ZnS) and cadmium sulfide (CdS) NPs. Moreover, we achieve Cu1.8S/ZnS and Cu1.94S/CdS tetradecahedral heterostructures via partial cation exchange, which are otherwise inaccessible by traditional synthetic approaches.

         <title>Overview of N&#8208;Rich Antennae Investigated in Lanthanide&#8208;Based Temperature Sensing</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Noncontact temperature sensors are gaining importance. Lanthanide&#8208;based temperature sensors stand out as they benefit form for example, high photostability. In this Review, an extensive overview on N&#8208;rich antennae used in lanthanide based temperature sensing is provided. The potential of N&#8208;rich small molecules, bi&#8208;and polynuclear complexes, metal organic frameworks, periodic mesoporous organosilicas and porous organic polymers are discussed.







Abstract
The market share of noncontact temperature sensors is expending due to fast technological and medical evolutions. In the wide variety of noncontact sensors, lanthanide&#8208;based temperature sensors stand out. They benefit from high photostability, relatively long decay times and high quantum yields. To circumvent their low molar light absorption, the incorporation of a light&#8208;harvesting antenna is required. This Review provides an overview of the nitrogen&#8208;rich antennae in lanthanide&#8208;based temperature sensors, emitting in the visible light spectrum, and discusses their temperature sensor ability. The N&#8208;rich ligands are incorporated in many different platforms. The investigation of different antennae is required to develop temperature sensors with diverse optical properties and to create a diverse offer for the multiple application fields. Molecular probes, consisting of small molecules, are first discussed. Furthermore, the thermometer properties of ratiometric temperature sensors, based on di&#8208; and polynuclear complexes, metal&#8211;organic frameworks, periodic mesoporous organosilicas and porous organic polymers, are summarized. The antenna mainly determines the application potential of the ratiometric thermometer. It can be observed that molecular probes are operational in the broad physiological range, metal&#8211;organic frameworks are generally very useful in the cryogenic region, periodic mesoporous organosilica show temperature dependency in the physiological range, and porous organic polymers are operative in the cryogenic&#8208;to&#8208;medium temperature range.

         <title>Biological and Medical Applications of Calcium Phosphate Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Calcium phosphate nanoparticles are well suited to transport organic or biological molecules into cells and tissue. They are well tolerated by cells and organisms and have a clearly defined degradation pathway, also due to their almost ubiquitous presence in the body. Promising applications for them are seen in drug and gene delivery and also in immunization, for example, for vaccination. This Review explores the synthesis, characterization, functionalization and biomedical applications of calcium phosphate nanoparticles from the recent literature.







Abstract
Calcium phosphate nanoparticles have a high biocompatibility and biodegradability due to their chemical similarity to human hard tissue, for example, bone and teeth. They can be used as efficient carriers for different kinds of biomolecules such as nucleic acids, proteins, peptides, antibodies, or drugs, which alone are not able to enter cells where their biological effect is required. They can be loaded with cargo molecules by incorporating them, unlike solid nanoparticles, and also by surface functionalization. This offers protection, for example, against nucleases, and the possibility for cell targeting. If such nanoparticles are functionalized with fluorescing dyes, they can be applied for imaging in vitro and in vivo. Synthesis, functionalization and cell uptake mechanisms of calcium phosphate nanoparticles are discussed together with applications in transfection, gene silencing, imaging, immunization, and bone substitution. Biodistribution data of calcium phosphate nanoparticles in vivo are reviewed.

         <title>Engineered Bifunctional Luminescent Pillared&#8208;Layer Frameworks for Adsorption of CO2 and Sensitive Detection of Nitrobenzene in Aqueous Media</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Space for guests: Five isoreticular luminescent pillared&#8208;layer metal&#8211;organic frameworks showing CO2 uptake and the sensitive detection of nitrobenzene (NB) in aqueous solution are engineered. The NB&#8208;included framework provides direct evidence for framework&#8211;NB interactions.







Abstract
Through a dual&#8208;ligand synthetic approach, five isoreticular primitive cubic (pcu)&#8208;type pillared&#8208;layer metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs), [Zn2(dicarboxylate)2(NI&#8208;bpy&#8208;44)]&#8901;x&#8201;DMF&#8901;y&#8201;H2O, in which dicarboxylate=1,4&#8208;bdc (1), Br&#8208;1,4&#8208;bdc (2), NH2&#8208;1,4&#8208;bdc (3), 2,6&#8208;ndc (4), and bpdc (5), have been engineered. MOFs 1&#8211;5 feature twofold degrees of interpenetration and have open pores of 27.0, 33.6, 36.8, 52.5, and 62.1&#8201;%, respectively. Nitrogen adsorption isotherms of activated MOFs 1&#8242;&#8211;5&#8242; at 77&#8197;K all displayed type&#8197;I adsorption behavior, suggesting their microporous nature. Although 1&#8242; and 3&#8242;&#8211;5&#8242; exhibited type&#8197;I adsorption isotherms of CO2 at 195&#8197;K, MOF 2&#8242; showed a two&#8208;step gate&#8208;opening sorption isotherm of CO2. Furthermore, MOF 3&#8242; also had a significant influence of amine functions on CO2 uptake at high temperature due to the CO2&#8211;framework interactions. MOFs 1&#8211;5 revealed solvent&#8208;dependent fluorescence properties; their strong blue&#8208;light emissions in aqueous suspensions were efficiently quenched by trace amounts of nitrobenzene (NB), with limits of detection of 4.54, 5.73, 1.88, 2.30, and 2.26&#8197;&#956;m, respectively, and Stern&#8211;Volmer quenching constants (Ksv) of 2.93&#215;103, 1.79&#215;103, 3.78&#215;103, 4.04&#215;103, and 3.21&#215;103&#8201;m&#8722;1, respectively. Of particular note, the NB&#8208;included framework, NB@3, provided direct evidence of the binding sites, which showed strong host&#8211;guest &#960;&#8211;&#960; and hydrogen&#8208;bonding interactions beneficial for donor&#8211;acceptor electron transfer and resulting in fluorescence quenching.

         <title>Iron Catalyzed Double Bond Isomerization: Evidence for an FeI/FeIII Catalytic Cycle</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using deuterium labelling, electrochemistry, EPR and DFT, an iron catalyzed double bond isomerization reaction was disclosed that is likely to proceed through on&#8208;cycle FeI and FeIII intermediates. The reaction uses an FeII pre&#8208;catalyst that undergoes a one&#8208;electron reduction to get to the first on&#8208;cycle species. These studies on mechanism, along with synthetic scope of the reaction, are presented.







Abstract
Iron&#8208;catalyzed isomerization of alkenes is reported using an iron(II) &#946;&#8208;diketiminate pre&#8208;catalyst. The reaction proceeds with a catalytic amount of a hydride source, such as pinacol borane (HBpin) or ammonia borane (H3N&#8901;BH3). Reactivity with both allyl arenes and aliphatic alkenes has been studied. The catalytic mechanism was investigated by a variety of means, including deuteration studies, Density Functional Theory (DFT) and Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) spectroscopy. The data obtained support a pre&#8208;catalyst activation step that gives access to an &#951;2&#8208;coordinated alkene FeI complex, followed by oxidative addition of the alkene to give an FeIII intermediate, which then undergoes reductive elimination to allow release of the isomerization product.

         <title>Selection of Planar Chiral Conformations between Pillar[5,6]arenes Induced by Amino Acid Derivatives in Aqueous Media</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A side&#8208;chain link to chirality: The &#945;&#8208;side chain or ethyl ester moieties of a chiral &#945;&#8208;amino acid ethyl ester hydrochloride were recognized by detecting induced CD signals of WP5 or its homologue WP6. The forces involved in selecting the chiral conformation, such as C (or N)&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; interactions, hydrogen bonds, and &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking were illuminated by DFT calculations.







Abstract
Chiral &#945;&#8208;amino acids play critical roles in the metabolic process in nearly all life forms. So far, chiral recognition of &#945;&#8208;amino acids has mainly focused on the determination of l/d enantiomers. Herein, selection of planar chiral conformations between water&#8208;soluble pillar[5]arene WP5 and pillar[6]arene WP6 was observed due to &#945;&#8208;side chain or ethyl ester moieties of l&#8208;&#945;&#8208;amino acid ethyl ester hydrochlorides binding with WP5 and WP6, respectively. Therefore, &#945;&#8208;side chain and ethyl ester moieties of l&#8208;&#945;&#8208;amino acid ethyl ester hydrochlorides were recognized by observing the induced CD signal and its inversion. This is a rare example of being able to detect the chiral region around &#945;&#8208;carbon of a chiral &#945;&#8208;amino acid molecule.

         <title>Catalytic Performance of Zr&#8208;Based Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks Zr&#8208;abtc and MIP&#8208;200 in Selective Oxidations with H2O2</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An eight&#8208;connected metal&#8211;organic framework Zr&#8208;abtc catalyzes a range of H2O2&#8208;based selective oxidations. The significant predominance of 1,2&#8208;epoxide in the epoxidation of carvone and high sulfone selectivity in thioether oxidation point to a nucleophilic oxidation mechanism. With highly reactive alkenes, such as caryophyllene, electrophilic oxidation can also be realized.







Abstract
The catalytic performance of Zr&#8208;abtc and MIP&#8208;200 metal&#8211;organic frameworks consisting of 8&#8208;connected Zr6 clusters and tetratopic linkers was investigated in H2O2&#8208;based selective oxidations and compared with that of 12&#8208;coordinated UiO&#8208;66 and UiO&#8208;67. Zr&#8208;abtc demonstrated advantages in both substrate conversion and product selectivity for epoxidation of electron&#8208;deficient C=C bonds in &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated ketones. The significant predominance of 1,2&#8208;epoxide in carvone epoxidation, coupled with high sulfone selectivity in thioether oxidation, points to a nucleophilic oxidation mechanism over Zr&#8208;abtc. The superior catalytic performance in the epoxidation of unsaturated ketones correlates with a larger amount of weak basic sites in Zr&#8208;abtc. Electrophilic activation of H2O2 can also be realized, as evidenced by the high activity of Zr&#8208;abtc in epoxidation of the electron&#8208;rich C=C bond in caryophyllene. XRD and FTIR studies confirmed the retention of the Zr&#8208;abtc structure after the catalysis. The low activity of MIP&#8208;200 in H2O2&#8208;based oxidations is most likely related to its specific hydrophilicity, which disfavors adsorption of organic substrates and H2O2.

         <title>New Noncentrosymmetric Tetrel Pnictides Composed of Square&#8208;Planar Gold(I) with Peculiar Bonding</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bonding natures: Compared with common types of AuI coordination observed in extended solids, square&#8208;planar coordination is rare. Au(I)relia shows off the three&#8208;centered bonding of Au&#8722;Tt&#8722;Au and Au&#8722;Pn&#8722;Au (on her feathers; Tt=tetrel, Pn=pnictogen), square&#8208;planar cis&#8208;[AuTt2Pn2] units (her body), and linear chains of Au (her legs) that are characteristic of equiatomic AuSiAs, AuGeP, and AuGeAs compounds.







Abstract
Three novel isostructural equiatomic gold tetrel pnictides, AuSiAs, AuGeP, and AuGeAs, were synthesized and characterized. These phases crystallize in the noncentrosymmetric (NCS) monoclinic space group Cc (no. 9), featuring square&#8208;planar Au within cis&#8208;[AuTt2Pn2] units (Tt=tetrel, Si, Ge; Pn=pnictogen, P, As). This is in drastic contrast to the structure of previously reported AuSiP, which exhibits typical linear coordination of Au with Si and P. Chemical bonding analysis through the electron localization function suggests covalent two&#8208;center two&#8208;electron Tt&#8722;Pn bonds, and three&#8208;center Au&#8722;Tt&#8722;Au and Au&#8722;Pn&#8722;Au bonds with 1.6&#8197;e&#8722; per bond. X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy studies support the covalent and nonionic nature of Au&#8722;Pn and Au&#8722;Tt bonds. The title materials were found to be n&#8208;type narrow&#8208;gap semiconductors or semimetals, with nearly temperature&#8208;independent electrical resistivities and low thermal conductivities. A combination of the semimetallic properties with tunable NCS structure provides opportunities for the development of materials based on gold tetrel pnictides.

         <title>Circularly Polarized Luminescence of Achiral Metal&#8211;Organic Colloids and Guest Molecules in a Vortex Field</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Spinning around: Two metal&#8211;organic colloids based on achiral starting materials show active CD and circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) properties in a vortex field. The optical properties of the colloids can be transferred to achiral Rhodamine derivatives, with glum 10&#8722;2 in magnitude and quantum yields of 40&#8211;83&#8201;%.







Abstract
Recently, scientists have reported a range of chiral fluorescence materials or chiral composites that can emit circularly polarized luminescence.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Spinning around&lt;/b&gt;: Two metal&#8211;organic colloids based on achiral starting materials show active CD and circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) properties in a vortex field.

&lt;p&gt;Recently, scientists have reported a range of chiral fluorescence materials or chiral composites that can emit circularly polarized luminescence. Herein, two achiral metal&#8211;organic colloidal solutions were studied, showing active circularly polarized luminescence, which is observed in vortex stirring. The absolute values for &lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;lum&lt;/sub&gt; are 0.05 and 0.03 and the plus or minus sign of &lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;lum&lt;/sub&gt; depends on the colloidal structure and stirring direction, which make the property easy to manipulate. Further, the host&#8211;guest interaction study suggests both electrostatic interactions and coordination bonding may influence the chiroptical property from the colloidal solution to the guest molecule. Rhodamine 6G and its carboxylic acid derivative exhibit good quantum yields and acceptable &lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;lum&lt;/sub&gt; values in the colloidal solution.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Altered Membrane Mechanics Provides a Receptor&#8208;Independent Pathway for Serotonin Action</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
It is known that serotonin binds to lipid membranes with high affinity, but what does it do to it? We find that it makes artificial lipid bilayers softer and easier to indent by an AFM tip (top), and promotes disorder in ordered regions. For cell membranes, this effect facilitates increased endocytosis (bottom). This increase occurs even when the serotonin receptors are blocked, providing a receptor&#8208;independent pathway for serotonin action.







Abstract
Serotonin, an important signaling molecule in humans, has an unexpectedly high lipid membrane affinity. The significance of this finding has evoked considerable speculation. Here we show that membrane binding by serotonin can directly modulate membrane properties and cellular function, providing an activity pathway completely independent of serotonin receptors. Atomic force microscopy shows that serotonin makes artificial lipid bilayers softer, and induces nucleation of liquid disordered domains inside the raft&#8208;like liquid&#8208;ordered domains. Solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy corroborates this data at the atomic level, revealing a homogeneous decrease in the order parameter of the lipid chains in the presence of serotonin. In the RN46A immortalized serotonergic neuronal cell line, extracellular serotonin enhances transferrin receptor endocytosis, even in the presence of broad&#8208;spectrum serotonin receptor and transporter inhibitors. Similarly, it increases the membrane binding and internalization of oligomeric peptides. Our results uncover a mode of serotonin&#8211;membrane interaction that can potentiate key cellular processes in a receptor&#8208;independent fashion.

         <title>Multiply Charged Helium Droplet Anions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Charged droplets: The detection of multiply charged helium droplet anions is reported for the first time. By ionizing droplets of superfluid helium with low energy electrons (up to 25&#8197;eV), it was possible to produce droplets containing up to five negative charges, which remain intact on the timescale of the experiment.







Abstract
The detection of multiply charged helium droplet anions is reported for the first time. By ionizing droplets of superfluid helium with low energy electrons (up to 25&#8197;eV), it was possible to produce droplets containing up to five negative charges, which remain intact on the timescale of the experiment. The appearance sizes for different charge states are determined and are found to be orders of magnitude larger than for the equivalent cationic droplets, starting at 4 million He atoms for dianions. Droplets with He*&#8722; as charge carriers show signs of being metastable, but this effect is quenched by the pickup of water molecules.

         <title>Characterization of the Simplest Thiolimine: The Higher Energy Tautomer of Thioformamide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Keep it simple! Thioamides resemble viable prebiotic building blocks for biologically relevant molecules. However, only a handful of experimental reports on parent thioformamide exist. X&#8208;ray diffraction data of thioformamide are reported and its tautomerization induced by UV irradiation under cryogenic conditions is presented. Four conformers of the corresponding thiolimine form, whose (tunneling) reactivity is investigated.







Abstract
As sulfur&#8208;containing organic molecules thioamides and their isomers are conceivable intermediates in prebiotic chemistry, for example, in the formation of amino acids and thiazoles and resemble viable candidates for detection in interstellar media. Here, we report the characterization of parent thioformamide in the solid state via single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and its photochemical interconversion to its hitherto unreported higher energy tautomer thiolimine in inert argon and dinitrogen matrices. Upon photogeneration, four conformers of thiolimine form, whose ratio depends on the employed wavelength. One of these conformers interconverts due to quantum mechanical tunneling with a half&#8208;life of 30&#8211;45&#8197;min in both matrix materials at 3 and 20&#8197;K. A spontaneous reverse reaction from thiolimine to thioformamide is not observed. To support our experimental findings, we explored the potential energy surface of the system at the AE&#8208;CCSD(T)/aug&#8208;cc&#8208;pCVTZ level of theory and computed tunneling half&#8208;lives with the CVT/SCT approach applying DFT methods.

         <title>Tunable Anticancer Activity of Furoylthiourea&#8208;Based RuII&#8211;Arene Complexes and Their Mechanism of Action</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multitasking! Fourteen new Ru&#8211;arene (p&#8208;cymene or benzene) complexes bearing different furoylthiourea ligands have been synthesized and characterized. All the complexes were found to be highly toxic towards IMR&#8208;32 cancer cells. The complexes catalytically oxidized glutathione and promoted cell death by apoptosis and cell cycle arrest. They also showed good binding ability with receptors commonly overexpressed in cancer cells.







Abstract
Fourteen new RuII&#8211;arene (p&#8208;cymene/benzene) complexes (C1&#8211;C14) have been synthesized by varying the N&#8208;terminal substituent in the furoylthiourea ligand and satisfactorily characterized by using analytical and spectroscopic techniques. Electrostatic potential maps predicted that the electronic effect of the substituents was mostly localized, with some influence seen on the labile chloride ligands. The structure&#8211;activity relationships of the Ru&#8211;p&#8208;cymene and Ru&#8211;benzene complexes showed opposite trends. All the complexes were found to be highly toxic towards IMR&#8208;32 cancer cells, with C5 (Ru&#8211;p&#8208;cymene complex containing C6H2(CH3)3 as N&#8208;terminal substituent) and C13 (Ru&#8211;benzene complex containing C6H4(CF3) as N&#8208;terminal substituent) showing the highest activity among each set of complexes, and hence they were chosen for further study. These complexes showed different behavior in aqueous solutions, and were also found to catalytically oxidize glutathione. They also promoted cell death by apoptosis and cell cycle arrest. Furthermore, the complexes showed good binding ability with the receptors Pim&#8208;1 kinase and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2, commonly overexpressed in cancer cells.

         <title>Novel Ferrocene&#8208;Appended &#946;&#8208;Ketoimines and Related BF2 Derivatives with Significant Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission and Second&#8208;Order Nonlinear Optical Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Strong candidates! The synthesis and structural characterization of ferrocene&#8208;appended &#946;&#8208;ketoimines and their BF2 complexes is reported. A study of their photophysical properties revealed that both the &#946;&#8208;ketoimines and their BF2 complexes show aggregation&#8208;induced emission and a strong second&#8208;order nonlinear optical (NLO) response, and thus are excellent multifunctional candidates for NLO and luminescence applications.







Abstract
A series of new &#946;&#8208;ketoimines containing a ferrocene moiety and their BF2 complexes have been synthesized and structurally characterized. The solvatochromism of the &#946;&#8208;ketoimines was studied, putting in evidence a redshift with increasing solvent polarity. This positive solvatochromism can be attributed to a more polarized excited state compared with the ground state, due to intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) transitions. The &#946;&#8208;ketoimines exhibited weak emission, attributable to the excited&#8208;state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT) phenomenon. This ESIPT effect is suppressed upon restriction of the keto&#8208;enamine tautomerism, induced upon addition of BF3&#8901;OEt2, which afforded the related BF2 complexes, characterized by an enhancement of the fluorescence through the ICT effect. Both the &#946;&#8208;ketoimines and BF2 complexes exhibited significant aggregation&#8208;induced emission behavior in mixtures of CH3CN/H2O, due to restriction of intramolecular rotation in the aggregated state. The frontier molecular orbital levels, ground&#8208; and excited&#8208;state dipole moments (&#956;g and &#956;e), and the origin of electronic absorption spectra were studied by time&#8208;dependent DFT calculations. The second&#8208;order nonlinear optical (NLO) properties were determined by the electric&#8208;field&#8208;induced second&#8208;harmonic generation technique. The &#956;&#946;1907 values of the &#946;&#8208;ketoimines increased upon the formation of the related BF2 complexes, mainly due to an enhancement of the ground&#8208;state dipole moment. The results presented here reveal that some of these novel compounds are excellent multifunctional candidates for NLO and luminescence applications.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Strong candidates&lt;/b&gt;! The synthesis and structural characterization of ferrocene&#8208;appended &#946;&#8208;ketoimines and their BF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; complexes is reported. A study of their photophysical properties revealed that both the &#946;&#8208;ketoimines and their BF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; complexes show aggregation&#8208;induced emission and a strong second&#8208;order nonlinear optical (NLO) response, and thus are excellent multifunctional candidates for NLO and luminescence applications.

         <title>Controlling Emissive Properties by Intramolecular Hydrogen Bonds: Alkyl and Aryl meso&#8208;Substituted Porphycenes</title>

Abstract
Porphycene, a porphyrin isomer, is an efficient fluorophore. However, four&#8208;fold meso substitution with alkyl groups decreases the fluorescence quantum yield by orders of magnitude. For aryl substituents, this effect is small. To explain this difference, we have synthesized and studied a mixed aryl&#8208;alkyl&#8208;substituted compound, 9,20&#8208;diphenyl&#8208;10,19&#8208;dimethylporphycene, as well as the 9,20&#8208;diphenyl and 9,20&#8208;dimethyl derivatives. Analysis of the structural, spectroscopic, and photophysical data of the six porphycenes, combined with quantum chemical calculations, shows a clear correlation between the strength of the intramolecular NH&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;N hydrogen bonds and the efficiency of the radiationless depopulation of the lowest&#8208;excited singlet state. This result led us to propose a model in which the delocalization of the inner protons in the cavity of the macrocycle is responsible for the nonradiative deactivation channel. The applicability of the model is confirmed by the literature data for other alkyl&#8208; or aryl&#8208;substituted porphycenes. The finding of a correlation between structural and emissive characteristics enables a rational design of porphycenes with desired photophysical properties.

Abstract
We report on the results of an in&#8197;situ synchrotron powder X&#8208;ray diffraction study of the crystallisation in aqueous medium of two recently discovered perfluorinated CeIV&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs), analogues of the already well investigated ZrIV&#8208;based UiO&#8208;66 and MIL&#8208;140A, namely, F4_UiO&#8208;66(Ce) and F4_MIL&#8208;140A(Ce). The two MOFs were originally obtained in pure form in similar conditions, using ammonium cerium nitrate and tetrafluoroterephthalic acid as reagents, and small variations of the reaction parameters were found to yield mixed phases. Here, we investigate the crystallisation of these compounds, varying parameters such as temperature, amount of the protonation modulator nitric acid and amount of the coordination modulator acetic acid. When only HNO3 is present in the reaction environment, only F4_MIL&#8208;140A(Ce) is obtained. Heating preferentially accelerates nucleation, which becomes rate determining below 57&#8201;&#176;C. Upon addition of AcOH to the system, alongside HNO3, mixed&#8208;phased products are obtained. F4_UiO&#8208;66(Ce) is always formed faster, and no interconversion between the two phases occurs. In the case of F4_UiO&#8208;66(Ce), crystal growth is always the rate&#8208;determining step. A higher amount of HNO3 favours the formation of F4_MIL&#8208;140A(Ce), whereas increasing the amount of AcOH favours the formation of F4_UiO&#8208;66(Ce). Based on the in&#8197;situ results, a new optimised route to achieving a pure, high&#8208;quality F4_MIL&#8208;140A(Ce) phase in mild conditions (60&#8201;&#176;C, 1&#8197;h) is also identified.

         <title>The Missing Parent Compound [(C5H5)Fe(&#951;5&#8208;P5)]: Synthesis, Characterization, Coordination Behavior and Encapsulation</title>

Abstract
The so far missing parent compound of the large family of pentaphosphaferrocenes [CpFe(&#951;5&#8208;P5)] (1&#8201;b) was synthesized by the thermolysis of [CpFe(CO)2]2 with P4 using the very high&#8208;boiling solvent diisopropylbenzene. It was comprehensively characterized by, inter alia, NMR spectroscopy, single crystal X&#8208;ray structure analysis, cyclic voltammetry and DFT computations. Moreover, its coordination behavior towards CuI halides was explored, revealing the unprecedented 2D polymeric networks [{CpFe(&#951;5:1:1:1:1&#8208;P5)}Cu2(&#956;&#8208;X)2]n (2&#8201;a: X=Cl, 2&#8201;b: X=Br) and [{CpFe(&#951;5:1:1&#8208;P5)}Cu(&#956;&#8208;I)]n (3) and even the first cyclo&#8208;P5&#8208;containing 3D coordination polymer [{CpFe(&#951;5:1:1&#8208;P5)}Cu(&#956;&#8208;I)]n (4). The sandwich complex&#8197;1&#8201;b can also be incorporated in nano&#8208;sized supramolecules based on [Cp*Fe(&#951;5&#8208;P5)] (1&#8201;a) and CuX (X=Cl, Br, I): [CpFe(&#951;5&#8208;P5)]@[{Cp*Fe(&#951;5&#8208;P5)}12(CuX)20&#8208;n] (5&#8201;a: X=Cl, n=2.4; 5&#8201;b: X=Br, n=2.4; 5&#8201;c: X=I, n=0.95). Thereby, the formation of the CuI&#8208;containing fullerene&#8208;like sphere 5&#8201;c is found for the first time.

&lt;p&gt;The so far missing parent compound of the large family of pentaphosphaferrocenes [CpFe(&#951;&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;&#8208;P&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)] (&lt;b&gt;1&#8201;b&lt;/b&gt;) was synthesized by the thermolysis of [CpFe(CO)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; with P&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; using the very high&#8208;boiling solvent diisopropylbenzene. It was comprehensively characterized by, inter alia, NMR spectroscopy, single crystal X&#8208;ray structure analysis, cyclic voltammetry and DFT computations. Moreover, its coordination behavior towards Cu&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt; halides was explored, revealing the unprecedented 2D polymeric networks [{CpFe(&#951;&lt;sup&gt;5:1:1:1:1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8208;P&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)}Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(&#956;&#8208;X)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt; (&lt;b&gt;2&#8201;a&lt;/b&gt;: X=Cl, &lt;b&gt;2&#8201;b&lt;/b&gt;: X=Br) and [{CpFe(&#951;&lt;sup&gt;5:1:1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8208;P&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)}Cu(&#956;&#8208;I)]&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt; (&lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt;) and even the first &lt;i&gt;cyclo&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;P&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;&#8208;containing 3D coordination polymer [{CpFe(&#951;&lt;sup&gt;5:1:1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8208;P&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)}Cu(&#956;&#8208;I)]&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt; (&lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt;). The sandwich complex&#8197;&lt;b&gt;1&#8201;b&lt;/b&gt; can also be incorporated in nano&#8208;sized supramolecules based on [Cp*Fe(&#951;&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;&#8208;P&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)] (&lt;b&gt;1&#8201;a&lt;/b&gt;) and CuX (X=Cl, Br, I): [CpFe(&#951;&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;&#8208;P&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)]@[{Cp*Fe(&#951;&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;&#8208;P&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)}&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;(CuX)&lt;sub&gt;20&#8208;&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt;] (&lt;b&gt;5&#8201;a&lt;/b&gt;: X=Cl, &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;=2.4; &lt;b&gt;5&#8201;b&lt;/b&gt;: X=Br, &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;=2.4; &lt;b&gt;5&#8201;c&lt;/b&gt;: X=I, &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;=0.95). Thereby, the formation of the CuI&#8208;containing fullerene&#8208;like sphere &lt;b&gt;5&#8201;c&lt;/b&gt; is found for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;

Abstract
In recent years, luminescent materials doped with Ln3+ ions have attracted much attention for their application as optical thermometers based on both downshifting and upconversion processes. This study presents research done on the development of highly sensitive optical thermometers in the physiological temperature range based on poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) films doped with two series of visible Ln3+ complexes (Ln3+=Tb3+, Eu3+, and Sm3+) and SiO2 nanoparticles (NPs) coated with these PMMA films. The best performing PMMA film doped with Tb3+ and Eu3+ complexes was the PMMA[TbEuL1tppo]1 film (L1=4,4,4&#8208;trifluoro&#8208;1&#8208;phenyl&#8208;1,3&#8208;butadionate; tppo=triphenylphosphine oxide), which showed good temperature sensing of Sr=4.21&#8201;%&#8201;K&#8722;1 at 313&#8197;K, whereas for the PMMA films doped with Tb3+ and Sm3+ complexes the best performing was the PMMA[TbSmL2tppo]3 film (L2=4,4,4&#8208;trifluoro&#8208;1&#8208;(4&#8208;chlorophenyl)&#8208;1,3&#8208;butadionate), with Sr=3.64&#8201;%&#8201;K&#8722;1 at 313&#8197;K. Additionally, SiO2 NPs coated with the best performing films from each of the series of PMMA films (Tb&#8211;Eu and Tb&#8211;Sm) and their temperature&#8208;sensing properties were studied in water, showing excellent performance in the physiological temperature range (PMMA[TbEuL1tppo]1@SiO2: Sr=3.84&#8201;%&#8201;&#176;C at 20&#8201;&#176;C; PMMA[TbSmL2tppo]3@SiO2: Sr=3.27&#8201;%&#8201;&#176;C at 20&#8201;&#176;C) and the toxicity of these nanoparticles on human cells was studied, showing that they were nontoxic.

         <title>Directing Polymorphism in the Helical Nanofilament Phase</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polymorphism is defined as the formation of more than two kinds of crystal structures from a single compound, which is essential for practical applications such as pharmaceuticals and agriculture. Stimuli&#8208;responsive polymorphism of the helical nanofilament (HNF) is investigated by using light&#8208;driven and nanoconfinement methods. The light&#8208;driven HNFs form the twisted ribbons, while the nanoconfined HNFs show the cylindrical ribbons. The discovery of polymorphism on HNF structures will provide insights for future studies on chirality. More information can be found in the Full Paper by D.&#8197;K. Yoon et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202005221).

         <title>Enantioselective Aromatic Amination?</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>









Abstract
The atroposelective formation of C&#8722;N bonds has recently emerged within the field of amination reactions. On first sight, it may seem quite surprising that such an ancient class of organic coupling reactions (Gabriel, Ullmann, Goldberg, Buchwald, Hartwig and many others) has so few enantioselective solutions, and this in spite of asymmetric synthesis being now a mature concept and field. Why should enantioselective C&#8722;N bond formation be so difficult? This question and some of the first examples that promise an imminent change of paradigm are herein discussed.

         <title>Highly Emissive 9&#8208;Borafluorene Derivatives: Synthesis, Photophysical Properties and Device Fabrication</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Luminescent boroles: Highly twisted donor&#8208;functionalised 9&#8208;borafluorenes have been synthesised that exhibit bright luminescence without obvious charge&#8208;transfer character, as well as excellent thermal stability, suggesting their suitability for optoelectronic applications (see figure). Two organic light&#8208;emitting diode devices fabricated with these compounds showed properties highly favourable for future development.







Abstract
A series of 9&#8208;borafluorene derivatives, functionalised with electron&#8208;donating groups, have been prepared. Some of these 9&#8208;borafluorene compounds exhibit strong yellowish emission in solution and in the solid state with relatively high quantum yields (up to 73.6&#8201;% for FMesB&#8208;Cz as a neat film). The results suggest that the highly twisted donor groups suppress charge transfer, but the intrinsic photophysical properties of the 9&#8208;borafluorene systems remain. The new compounds showed enhanced stability towards the atmosphere, and exhibited excellent thermal stability, revealing their potential for application in materials science. Organic light&#8208;emitting diode (OLED) devices were fabricated with two of the highly emissive compounds, and they exhibited strong yellow&#8208;greenish electroluminescence, with a maximum luminance intensity of &gt;22&#8201;000&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2. These are the first two examples of 9&#8208;borafluorene derivatives being used as light&#8208;emitting materials in OLED devices, and they have enabled us to achieve a balance between maintaining their intrinsic properties while improving their stability.

Two organic light&#8208;emitting diode devices fabricated with these compounds showed properties highly favourable for future development.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A series of 9&#8208;borafluorene derivatives, functionalised with electron&#8208;donating groups, have been prepared. Some of these 9&#8208;borafluorene compounds exhibit strong yellowish emission in solution and in the solid state with relatively high quantum yields (up to 73.6&#8201;% for &lt;b&gt;FMesB&#8208;Cz&lt;/b&gt; as a neat film). The results suggest that the highly twisted donor groups suppress charge transfer, but the intrinsic photophysical properties of the 9&#8208;borafluorene systems remain. The new compounds showed enhanced stability towards the atmosphere, and exhibited excellent thermal stability, revealing their potential for application in materials science. Organic light&#8208;emitting diode (OLED) devices were fabricated with two of the highly emissive compounds, and they exhibited strong yellow&#8208;greenish electroluminescence, with a maximum luminance intensity of &amp;gt;22&#8201;000&#8197;cd&#8201;m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;. These are the first two examples of 9&#8208;borafluorene derivatives being used as light&#8208;emitting materials in OLED devices, and they have enabled us to achieve a balance between maintaining their intrinsic properties while improving their stability.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>The Prospect of Dimensionality in Porous Semiconductors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
With the advent of electronic devices, lightweight alternatives to conventionally used semiconductors are required. Porous (metal&#8211;)organic semiconductors are intriguing alternatives to silicon and especially their structural tunability resulted in a wide variety of functional materials. Although molecular design of these semiconductors is well understood, dimensionality and its influences are seldomly evaluated. In this Minireview, the role of dimensionality in porous semiconductors is critically evaluated.







Abstract
With the advent of silicon&#8208;based semiconductors, a plethora of previously unknown technologies became possible. The development of lightweight low&#8208;dimensional organic semiconductors followed soon after. However, the efficient charge/electron transfers enabled by the non&#8208;porous 3D structure of silicon is rather challenging to be realized by their (metal&#8208;)organic counterparts. Nevertheless, the demand for lighter, more efficient semiconductors is steadily increasing resulting in a growing interest in (metal&#8208;)organic semiconductors. These novel materials are faced with a variety of challenges originating from their chemical design, their packing and crystallinity. Although the effect of molecular design is quite well understood, the influence of dimensionality and the associated change in properties (porosity, packing, conjugation) is still an uncharted area in (metal&#8208;)organic semiconductors, yet highly important for their practical utilization. In this Minireview, an overview on the design and synthesis of porous semiconductors, with a particular emphasis on organic semiconductors, is presented and the influence of dimensionality is discussed.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Dependent and Selective Crystallization of CAU&#8208;10 and MIL&#8208;53 Frameworks through Linker Nitration</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In the frame: The nitration of the V&#8208;shaped linker 5&#8208;hydroxyisophthalic acid by Al(NO3)3 and Ga(NO3)3 prior to crystallization of the MOF leads selectively to Al&#8208;CAU&#8208;10 and Ga&#8208;MIL&#8208;53 type compounds. In situ IR spectroscopy and light scattering experiments in combination with 1H&#8208;NMR spectroscopy were used to study the product formation. DFT and GCMC calculations were employed to understand the differences in framework formation and water adsorption properties.







Abstract
The reaction of the V&#8208;shaped linker molecule 5&#8208;hydroxyisophthalic acid (H2L0), with Al or Ga nitrate under almost identical reaction conditions leads to the nitration of the linker and subsequent formation of metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) with CAU&#8208;10 or MIL&#8208;53 type structure of composition [Al(OH)(L)], denoted as Al&#8208;CAU&#8208;10&#8208;L0,&#8201;2,&#8201;4,&#8201;6 or [Ga(OH)(L)], denoted as Ga&#8208;MIL&#8208;53&#8208;L2. The Al&#8208;MOF contains the original linker L0 as well as three different nitration products (L2, L4 and L4/6), whereas the Ga&#8208;MOF mainly incorporates the linker L2. The compositions were deduced by 1H&#8201;NMR spectroscopy and confirmed by Rietveld refinement. In situ and ex situ studies were carried out to follow the nitration and crystallization, as well as the composition of the MOFs. The crystal structures were refined against powder X&#8208;ray diffraction (PXRD) data. As anticipated, the use of the V&#8208;shaped linker results in the formation of the CAU&#8208;10 type structure in the Al&#8208;MOF. Unexpectedly, the Ga&#8208;MOF crystallizes in a MIL&#8208;53 type structure, which is usually observed with linear or slightly bent linker molecules. To study the structure directing effect of the in situ nitrated linker, pure 2&#8208;nitrobenzene&#8208;1,3&#8208;dicarboxylic acid (m&#8208;H2BDC&#8208;NO2) was employed which exclusively led to the formation of [Ga(OH)(C8H3NO6)] (Ga&#8208;MIL&#8208;53&#8208;m&#8208;BDC&#8208;NO2), which is isoreticular to Ga&#8208;MIL&#8208;53&#8208;L2. Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations confirmed the higher stability of Ga&#8208;MIL&#8208;53&#8208;L2 compared to Ga&#8208;CAU&#8208;10&#8208;L2 and grand canonical Monte Carlo simulations (GCMC) are in agreement with the observed water adsorption isotherms of Ga&#8208;MIL&#8208;53&#8208;L2.

         <title>Helically and Linearly Fused Rylenediimide&#8208;Hexabenzocoronenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fantastic fusion: The fusion of naphthalene&#8208; as well as perylenediimides and hexabenzocoronenes via a fully conjugated benzimidazole linker enables the formation of helical as well as linear &#960;&#8208;extended donor&#8211;acceptor&#8208;hybrids applying Diels&#8211;Alder and Scholl&#8208;type chemistry. Remarkable differences in aggregation, charge&#8208;transfer (CT) stabilization as well as CT lifetimes emphasize the influence of the configuration of the bridge on donor&#8211;acceptor properties.







Abstract
Perylene&#8208; as well as naphthalenediimides were fused to hexabenzocoronenes (HBCs) at their imide position to realize highly &#960;&#8208;extended donor&#8211;acceptor (D&#8211;A)&#8208;hybrids. Successful isomer separation in the first step was decisive to guarantee a straightforward synthetic sequence. Hexaphenylbenzenes as precursors were accessed via Diels&#8211;Alder reactions and reacted in a Scholl oxidation to yield the respective HBC derivatives. The fully conjugated benzimidazole linker, which separates the electron donating HBC from the electron accepting rylenediimide, enabled the formation of either a linear or a helical configuration. Largely different chemical, physical, and optoelectrical characteristics were noted for the two configurations. What stood out was their aggregation and their excited state deactivation depending on the solvent polarity. Results from global analysis of the femtosecond transient absorption data corroborated the formation of a charge&#8208;transfer (CT) state that is stabilized in the helically fused configuration relative to the linear analogue. However, a comparison with spectroelectrochemical experiments failed to disclose evidence for a charge&#8208;separated (CS) state.

         <title>Experimental and Computational Studies on Quadruply Bonded Dimolybdenum Complexes with Terminal and Bridging Hydride Ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Quadruply bonded dimolybdenum complexes: A variety of hydride complexes with a quadruply bonded Mo2 core are presented in his article, focusing on an unusual trans&#8208;(H)Mo&#8803;Mo(H) central unit stabilized by amidinate ligands. The structure and thermodynamic stability of the different adducts have been investigated by experimental and computational techniques.







Abstract
This contribution focuses on complex [Mo2(H)2(&#956;&#8208;AdDipp2)2] (1) and tetrahydrofuran and pyridine adducts [Mo2(H)2(&#956;&#8208;AdDipp2)2(L)2] (1&#8901;thf and 1&#8901;py), which contain a trans&#8208;(H)Mo&#8803;Mo(H) core (AdDipp2=HC(NDipp2)2; Dipp=2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3). Computational studies provide insights into the coordination and electronic characteristics of the central trans&#8208;Mo2H2 unit of 1, with four&#8208;coordinate, fourteen&#8208;electron Mo atoms and &#1013;&#8208;agostic interactions with Dipp methyl groups. Small size C&#8208; and N&#8208;donors give rise to related complexes 1&#8901;L but only one molecule of P&#8208;donors, for example, PMe3, can bind to 1, causing one of the hydrides to form a three&#8208;centered, two&#8208;electron (3c&#8208;2e) Mo&#8208;H&#8594;Mo bond (2&#8901;PMe3). A DFT analysis of the terminal and bridging hydride coordination to the Mo&#8803;Mo bond is also reported, along with reactivity studies of the Mo&#8722;H bonds of these complexes. Reactions investigated include oxidation of 1&#8901;thf by silver triflimidate, AgNTf2, to afford a monohydride [Mo2(&#956;&#8208;H)(&#956;&#8208;NTf2)(&#956;&#8208;AdDipp2)2] (4), with an O,O&#8217;&#8208;bridging triflimidate ligand.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Quadruply bonded dimolybdenum complexes&lt;/b&gt;: A variety of hydride complexes with a quadruply bonded Mo&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; core are presented in his article, focusing on an unusual &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;(H)Mo&#8803;Mo(H) central unit stabilized by amidinate ligands. The structure and thermodynamic stability of the different adducts have been investigated by experimental and computational techniques.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This contribution focuses on complex [Mo&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(H)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(&#956;&#8208;Ad&lt;sup&gt;Dipp2&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;] (&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;) and tetrahydrofuran and pyridine adducts [Mo&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(H)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(&#956;&#8208;Ad&lt;sup&gt;Dipp2&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(L)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;] (&lt;b&gt;1&#8901;thf&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;1&#8901;py&lt;/b&gt;), which contain a &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;(H)Mo&#8803;Mo(H) core (Ad&lt;sup&gt;Dipp2&lt;/sup&gt;=HC(NDipp&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;; Dipp=2,6&#8208;&lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;Pr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;). Computational studies provide insights into the coordination and electronic characteristics of the central &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;Mo&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; unit of &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;, with four&#8208;coordinate, fourteen&#8208;electron Mo atoms and &lt;i&gt;&#1013;&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;agostic interactions with Dipp methyl groups. Small size C&#8208; and N&#8208;donors give rise to related complexes &lt;b&gt;1&#8901;L&lt;/b&gt; but only one molecule of P&#8208;donors, for example, PMe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, can bind to &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;, causing one of the hydrides to form a three&#8208;centered, two&#8208;electron (3c&#8208;2e) Mo&#8208;H&#8594;Mo bond (&lt;b&gt;2&#8901;PMe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;). A DFT analysis of the terminal and bridging hydride coordination to the Mo&#8803;Mo bond is also reported, along with reactivity studies of the Mo&#8722;H bonds of these complexes. Reactions investigated include oxidation of &lt;b&gt;1&#8901;thf&lt;/b&gt; by silver triflimidate, AgNTf&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, to afford a monohydride [Mo&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(&#956;&#8208;H)(&#956;&#8208;NTf&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)(&#956;&#8208;Ad&lt;sup&gt;Dipp2&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;] (&lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt;), with an O,O&#8217;&#8208;bridging triflimidate ligand.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Directing Polymorphism in the Helical Nanofilament Phase</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Morphogenesis control: the morphogenesis of the helical nanofilament (HNF) liquid&#8208;crystal phase was controlled to give structures that depend on the growth conditions. Two different growth methods were used to investigate the polymorphism of HNFs: nanoconfinement and light&#8208;driven orientation. This is apparently the first report on the polymorphism of an HNF phase formed by single kind of molecules.







Abstract
Herein, it is reported that the polymorphism in the helical nanofilament (HNF, B4) liquid&#8208;crystalline phase depends on the fabrication methods, that is, UV&#8208;driven formation and template&#8208;assisted self&#8208;assembly in the nanoconfined geometry. As a result, uniaxially oriented HNFs with different helical structures were obtained, in which generation of the twisted&#8208;ribbon and cylindrical&#8208;ribbon polymorphs showed that even the molecular lattice has a different orientation. The detailed structures were directly observed by SEM and grazing&#8208;incidence X&#8208;ray diffraction with synchrotron radiation. The resultant polymorphs could be used in chiro&#8208;optical applications due to the capability for fine control of the helical structures.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cascade reaction: An efficient asymmetric Mannich/cyclization cascade strategy is established from 2&#8208;benzothiazolimines with N&#8208;acylpyrazoles to provide optical active benzothiazolopyrimidine derivatives using a copper&#8208;based complex. The mild cascade process constructs various structurally diverse products with broad scope of substrates together with excellent enantioselectivities (up to 99&#8201;%) and diastereoselectivities (up to 99:1).

         <title>Electrochemical Tri&#8208; and Difluoromethylation&#8208;Triggered Cyclization Accompanied by the Oxidative Cleavage of Indole Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tri&#8208; and difluoromethylation/cyclization/indole oxidative cleavage: An unprecedented electrochemical tri&#8208; and difluoromethylation/cyclization/indole oxidative cleavage process has been established in an undivided cell. The protocol employs a readily prepared Langlois reagent as the fluoroalkyl source, affording a series of tri&#8208; or difluoromethylated 2&#8208;(2&#8208;acetylphenyl)isoquinoline&#8208;1,3&#8208;diones in good yields with excellent stereoselectivity.







Abstract
Considering their unique roles in organic synthesis, and pharmaceutical and agrochemical applications, the development of fluoroalkylation, cyclization, and indole oxidative cleavage are important topics. Herein, an unprecedented electrochemical tri&#8208; and difluoromethylation/cyclization/indole oxidative cleavage process occurring in an undivided cell is presented. The protocol employs a readily prepared Langlois reagent as the fluoroalkyl source, affording a series of tri&#8208; or difluoromethylated 2&#8208;(2&#8208;acetylphenyl)isoquinoline&#8208;1,3&#8208;diones in good yields with excellent stereoselectivity. It is worth noting that this new methodology merges the fluoroalkylation/cyclization of N&#8208;substituted acrylamide alkenes with the oxidative cleavage of an indole C(2)=C(3) bond under external oxidant&#8208;free conditions.

         <title>Surprising Homolytic Gas Phase (Co&#8208;C)&#8208;Bond Dissociation Energies of Organometallic Aryl&#8208;Cobinamides Reveal Notable Non&#8208;Bonded Intramolecular Interactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aryl&#8208;cobalamins are a new class of organometallic structural mimics of vitamin B12 designed as potential &#8216;antivitamins B12&#8217;. Here, the first cationic aryl&#8208;cobinamides are described, which were synthesized using the newly developed diaryl&#8208;iodonium method. The aryl&#8208;cobinamides were obtained as pairs of organometallic coordination isomers, whose stereo&#8208;structure was unambiguously assigned based on homo&#8208; and heteronuclear NMR&#8208;spectra. The availability of isomers with axial attachment of the aryl group, either at the &#8216;beta&#8217; or at the &#8216;alpha&#8217; face of the cobalt&#8208;center allowed for an unprecedented comparison of the organometallic reactivity of such pairs. The homolytic gas&#8208;phase bond dissociation energies (BDEs) of the coordination&#8208;isomeric phenyl&#8208; and 4&#8208;ethylphenyl&#8208;cobinamides were determined by ESI&#8208;mass threshold CID experiments, furnishing (Co&#8208;Csp2)&#8208;BDEs of 38.4 and 40.6 kcal/mol, respectively, for the two b&#8208;isomers, and the larger BDEs of 46.6 and 43.8 kcal/mol for the corresponding a&#8208;isomers. Surprisingly, the observed (Co&#8208;Csp2)&#8208;BDEs of the Cob&#8208;aryl&#8208;cobinamides were smaller than the (Co&#8208;Csp3)&#8208;BDE of Cob&#8208;methyl&#8208;cobinamide. DFT&#8208;studies and the magnitudes of the experimental (Co&#8208;Csp2)&#8208;BDE revealed relevant contributions of non&#8208;bonded interactions in aryl&#8208;cobinamides, notably steric strain between the aryl and the cobalt&#8208;corrin moieties and non&#8208;bonded interactions with and among the peripheral sidechains.</dc:description>

         <title>Mononuclear Dysprosium Alkoxide and Aryloxide Single&#8208;Molecule Magnets</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Recent studies have shown that mononuclear lanthanide (Ln) complexes can be high&#8208;performing single&#8208;molecule magnets (SMMs). Recently, there has been an influx of mononuclear Ln alkoxide and aryloxide SMMs, which have provided the necessary geometrical control to improve SMM properties and to allow the intricate relaxation dynamics of Ln SMMs to be studied in detail. Here we review non&#8208;aqueous Ln alkoxide and aryloxide chemistry applied to the synthesis of low&#8208;coordinate mononuclear Ln SMMs. We focus on mononuclear Dy(III) alkoxide and aryloxide SMMs with coordination numbers up to eight, covering synthesis, solid state structures and magnetic attributes. Brief overviews are also provided of mononuclear Dy(III) siloxide SMMs as heavier analogues, and complementary Tb(III), Ho(III), Er(III) and Yb(III) alkoxide and aryloxide SMMs.</dc:description>

         <title>Co&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Intramolecular [3+2] Cycloaddition of Yne&#8208;Alkylidenecyclopropanes and Reaction Mechanism</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing new transition&#8208;metal catalyzed asymmetric cycloadditions for the synthesis of five&#8208;membered carbocycles (FMCs) is a research frontier in reaction development, due to the ubiquitous presence of chiral FMCs in various functional molecules. Reported here is our discovery of a highly enantioselective intramolecular [3+2] cycloaddition of yne&#8208; alkylidenecyclopropanes (yne&#8208;ACPs) to both bicyclo[3.3.0]octa&#8208;dienes and bicyclo[4.3.0]nonadienes molecules, by using cheap Co catalyst and commercially available chiral ligand (S)&#8208;Xyl&#8208;BINAP. This reaction avoids the use of precious Pd and Rh catalysts which are usually the choices for ACPs&#8217; [3+2] reactions. The ee values in the present reaction can be up to 92%. Cationic cobalt (I) species was suggested by experiments as the catalytic species. DFT calculations showed that this [3+2] reaction starts with oxidative cyclometallation of alkyne and ACP, followed by ring opening of the cyclopropyl (CP) group and reductive elimination to form the cycloadduct. This mechanism is different from previous [3+2] reactions of ACPs, which usually start from CP cleavage, not from oxidative cyclization.</dc:description>

         <title>Recent Advances in the Synthesis of Glycodendrimers with Antiviral and Antibacterial Activity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Glycodendrimers are an important class of synthetic macromolecules that can be used to mimic many structural and functional features of cell surface glycoconjugates. Their carbohydrate moieties perform key important functions in bacterial and viral infections, often regulated by carbohydrate&#8211;protein interactions. Several studies have shown that the molecular structure, the valency and spatial organization of carbohydrate epitopes in glycoconjugates are key factors in the specificity and avidity of carbohydrate&#8208;protein interactions. Choosing the right glycodendrimers almost always helps to interfere in such interactions and blocks bacteria o viral adhesion or entry into host cells as an effective strategy to inhibit bacterial or viral infections. In this review, we describe the state of the art in the design and synthesis of glycodendrimers employed for the development of anti&#8208;adhesion therapy against bacterial and viral infections.Glycodendrimers are an important class of synthetic macromolecules that can be used to mimic many structural and functional features of cell surface glycoconjugates.

         <title>Tunable Light Emission Properties of Solution&#8208;Processable N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene Cyclometalated Gold(III) Complexes for Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) cyclometalated gold(III) complexes remain very scarce and therefore their photophysical properties remain currently underexplored. Moreover, gold(III) complexes emitting in the blue region of the electromagnetic spectrum are rare. In this work, a series of four phosphorescent gold(III) complexes were investigated bearing four different NHC monocyclometalated (C^C*)&#8208;type ligands and a dianionic (N^N)&#8208;type ancillary ligand ((N^N) = 5,5&#8217;&#8208;(propane&#8208;2,2&#8208;diyl)bis(3&#8208;(trifluoromethyl)&#8208;1H&#8208;pyrazole) (mepzH2)). The complexes exhibit strong phosphorescence when doped in poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) at room temperature, which were systematically tuned from sky&#8208;blue [&#955;PL = 456 nm, CIE coordinates: (0.20, 034)] to green [&#955;PL = 516 nm, CIE coordinates: (0.31, 0.54)] by varying the monocyclometalated (C^C*) ligand framework. The complexes revealed high quantum efficiencies (&#981;PL) of up to 43% and excited&#8208;state lifetimes (&#964;0) between 15&#8211;266 &#956;s. The radiative rate constant values found for these complexes (kr = 103&#8211;104 s&#8211;1) are the highest found in comparison to previously known best performing monocyclometalated gold(III) complexes. Density functional theory (DFT) and time&#8208;dependent DFT (TD&#8208;DFT) calculations of these complexes further lend support to the excited state nature of these complexes.&#160;Additionally, organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) were fabricated using solution&#8208;process to provide the first insight into the electroluminescent (EL) properties of this new class of gold(III) complexes.</dc:description>

         <title>Hydrogenation of secondary amides using phosphane oxide and frustrated Lewis pair catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The metal&#8208;free catalytic hydrogenation of secondary carboxylic acid amides is developed. The reduction is realized by two new catalytic reactions. First, the amide is converted into the imidoyl chloride by triphosgene (CO(OCCl3)2) using novel phosphorus(V) catalysts. Second, the in situ generated imidoyl chlorides are hydrogenated in high yields by an FLP&#8208;catalyst. Mechanistic and quantum mechanical calculations support an autoinduced catalytic cycle for the hydrogenation with chloride acting as unusual Lewis base for FLP&#8208;mediated H2&#8208;activation.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Actinide +VI complexes (An VI = U VI , Np VI and Pu VI ) with

dipicolinic acid derivatives were synthesized and characterized by

powder XRD, SQUID magnetometry and NMR spectroscopy. In

addition, Np VI and Pu VI complexes were described by first principles

CAS based and two&#8208;component spin&#8208;restricted DFT methods. The

analysis of the 1 H paramagnetic NMR chemical shifts for all protons

of the ligands according to the X&#8208;rays structures shows that the

Fermi contact contribution is negligible. The magnetic susceptibility

tensor is determined by combining SQUID, pNMR shifts and Evans&#8217;

pNMR chemical shifts has a strong 1 &#8260; T contribution, contrarily to

Bleaney&#8217;s theory for lanthanide complexes. The fitting of the

         <title>Design and Use of Electrophilic Thiocyanating and Selenocyanating Reagents: a New Trend for the Construction of SCN&#8208; and SeCN&#8208;containing Compounds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organothiocyanate and organoselenocyanate compounds are of paramount importance in organic chemistry as they are key intermediates to access sulfur&#8208; and selenium&#8208;containing compounds. Therefore, among the different synthetic pathways to get SCN&#8208; and SeCN&#8208;containing molecules, original methodologies using electrophilic reagents has recently been explored. This Minireview will showcase the recent advances, which have been made. In particular, the design of several electrophilic sources and their applications for the thiocyanation and the selenocyanation of various classes of compounds will be highlighted and discussed.</dc:description>
