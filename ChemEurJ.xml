         <title>Synthesis and Anticancer Activity of Phosphinoylated and Phosphonoylated N&#8208;Heterocycles Obtained by the Microwave&#8208;Assisted Palladium Acetate&#8208;Catalyzed Hirao Reaction</title>

         <dc:description>A literature survey showed that different derivatives with the 9&#8208;phenyl&#8208;9H&#8208;carbazole or the dihydroindoline scaffold may be of biological activity including cytotoxic effect. Driven by this experience, we wished to synthesize P&#8208;functionalized derivatives of the above mentioned N&#8208;heterocycles. Three N&#8208;heterocycles, 9&#8208;(4&#8208;bromophenyl)&#8208;9H&#8208;carbazole, 3&#8208;bromo&#8208;9&#8208;phenyl&#8208;9H&#8208;carbazole and 1&#8208;(5&#8208;bromoindolin&#8208;1&#8208;yl)ethan&#8208;1&#8208;one were coupled with dialkyl phosphites and diarylphosphine oxides using Pd(OAc)2 (10%) as the catalyst precursor and triethylamine as the base in ethanol under microwave irradiation. The excess of the Y2P(O)H reagent (Y = alkoxy, aryl) (30%) served as the P&#8208;ligand in its trivalent tautomeric form (Y2POH), hence there was no need for the usual P&#8208;ligands meaning cost and environmental burden. Hence, our method is a &#8220;green&#8221; approach that proved to be more efficient than the preparation by the traditional method. The products, dialkyl phosphonates and tertiary phosphine oxides obtained in 58&#8211;84% yields were characterized, one of them also by single crystal X&#8208;ray analysis, and were subjected to in vitro biological activity evaluation. A (carbazol)yl&#8208;phenylphosphonate, an N&#8208;phenyl&#8208;(carbazol)yl&#8208;phosphonate, a (carbazol)yl&#8208;phenylphosphine oxide and an N&#8208;phenyl&#8208;(carbazol)ylphosphine oxide revealed a significant cytotoxic activity on A549 human non&#8208;small&#8208;cell lung carcinoma and MonoMac&#8208;6 acute monocytic leukemia cancer cells.

         <title>Polymorphism  and Light&#8208;Driven Forward Movement of TPE Derivative Micro&#8208;Crystal due to ArH&#8208;pi Interactions Difference</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) and aggregation&#8208;caused quenching (ACQ) are two classes of opposite luminescence phenomena. It is almost impossible to show both AIE and ACQ effect simultaneously by the same molecule. However, here we report that a simple TPE derivative TAP&#8208;TPE grows into both AIE crystals and ACQ ones. It is found that equatorial, contact distance&#8208;longer and weak ArH&#8208;&#960; interactions exist in AIE crystals while vertical, contact distance&#8208;shorter and strong ArH&#8208;&#960; interactions appear in ACQ crystals. Theoretical calculation of electron density on the interaction atoms unveils that ACQ crystals have much larger change in electron density than AIE ones, suggesting that the intermolecular electron transfer aroused by the strong ArH&#8208;&#960; hydrogen bonds leads to ACQ phenomenon. This result provides a new insight into the emission mechanism in aggregation state. Interestingly, due to the ArH&#8208;pi interactions difference, only one of five kinds of crystals shows rapid photochromism, and can act as multimode anti&#8208;counterfeiting materials. Very exceptionally, for the first time we find that the photochromic micrometric rod&#8208;like crystal even makes forward rolling movement as it repeatedly bends and straightens by responding to on and off of the ultraviolet light irradiation, displaying potential for photo&#8208;actuator and light&#8208;driven micro&#8208;vehicle.</dc:description>

         <title>Enantioselective Dearomative [4+2] Cycloaddition Reaction of 1&#8208;Naphthols with In&#8208;situ Generated ortho&#8208;Quinone Methides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We disclose a catalytic, enantioselective dearomative reaction of non&#8208;functionalized 1&#8208;naphthols, which poses a synthetic challenge to organic chemists because of the relative ease of rearomatization via the elimination of a proton. In this work, the direct dearomatization of non&#8208;functionalized 1&#8208;naphthols was achieved through a chiral phosphoric acid (CPA) catalyzed enantioselective dearomative [4+2] cycloaddition reaction with in&#8208;situ generated ortho&#8208;quinone methides (o&#8208;QMs). The reported convergent method allows the use of readily available simple 1&#8208;naphthols without pre&#8208;functionalization, furnishing a variety of naphthopyran derivatives in good yields (up to 96%) and moderate to excellent enantioselectivities (up to &gt;99% ee) under mild reaction conditions. The observed regio&#8208;, diastereo&#8208;, and enantioselectivities are the keys to the success of the current strategy utilizing o&#8208;QM as a diene surrogates, in combination with CPA catalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Enrichment strategies for efficient CO2 electroreduction in acidic electrolytes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) has been recognized as an appealing route to remarkably accelerate the carbon&#8208;neutral cycle and reduce carbon emissions. Notwithstanding great catalytic activity that has been acquired in neutral and alkaline conditions, the carbonates generated from the inevitable reaction of the input CO2 with the hydroxide severely lower carbon utilization and energy efficiency. By contrast, CO2RR in an acidic condition can effectively circumvent the carbonate issues; however, the activity and selectivity of CO2RR in acidic electrolytes will be decreased significantly due to the competing hydrogen evolution reaction (HER).&#160;&#160;Enriching the CO2 and the key intermediates around the catalyst surface can promote the reaction rate and enhance the product selectivity, providing a promising way to boost the performance of CO2RR. In this review, the catalytic mechanism and key technique challenges of CO2RR are first introduced. Then, the critical progress of enrichment strategies for promoting the CO2RR in the acidic electrolyte is summarized with three aspects: catalyst design, electrolyte regulation, and electrolyzer optimization. Finally, some insights and perspectives for further development of enrichment strategies in acidic CO2RR are expounded.</dc:description>

         <title>Molecular Recognition Process in Resorcinarene&#8208;based Coordination Capsules</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cu and Ag capsules can take up various organic molecules. Their molecular recognition possibly involves partial dissociation and slippage. We investigated molecular recognition processes in Cu and Ag capsules by CD and&#160;1H NMR spectroscopy and employed 4,4&#8217;&#8208;diacetoxy biphenyl carrying two benzothiadiazole groups as a probe. CD and&#160;1H NMR measurements reveal that the host&#8208;guest complexation proceeds under second&#8208;order reactions and that these capsules undergo partial dissociation to take up the probe in [D1]chloroform and [D8]THF. Slippage also contributes to host&#8208;guest complexation for a Cu capsule that carries&#160;p&#8208;methoxyphenyl groups on the 2,2&#8217;&#8208;bipyridiyl arms. DFT calculations suggest that &#960;/&#960; stacking interactions between the electron&#8208;rich&#160;p&#8208;methoxyphenyl group and the electron&#8208;poor 2,2&#8217;&#8208;bipyridyl arm elongate the capsule, allowing the guest to access the cavity without partial dissociation.</dc:description>

         <title>Tunable Fluorescence and Morphology of Aggregates Built from a Mechanically Bonded Amphiphilic Bistable [2]Rotaxane</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel mechanically bonded amphiphile (MBA)&#8208;bistable [2]rotaxane H2 was designed and prepared. In both the solution and aggregated states, H2 demonstrated pH&#8208;responsive emissions due to the presence of a distance&#8208;dependent photoinduced electron transfer (PET) process. Moreover, the morphology of H2 aggregates can be tuned from nanospheres to vesicles due to the pH&#8208;controlled shuttling motion&#8208;induced alternation of H2 amphiphilicity.

Advanced Organic Chemical Materials Co&#8208;constructed Mechanically bonded amphiphiles (MBAs), also known as mechanically interlocked molecules (MIMs), have emerged as an important kind of functional building block for the construction of artificial molecular machines and soft materials. Herein, a novel MBA, i.&#8201;e., bistable [2]rotaxane H2 was designed and synthesized. In the solution state, H2 demonstrated pH and metal ion&#8208;responsive emissions due to the presence of a distance&#8208;dependent photoinduced electron transfer (PET) process and the fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) process, respectively. Importantly, the amphiphilic feature of H2 has endowed it with unique self&#8208;assembly capability, and nanospheres were obtained in a mixed H2O/CH3CN solvent. Moreover, the morphology of H2 aggregates can be tuned from nanospheres to vesicles due to the pH&#8208;controlled shuttling motion&#8208;induced alternation of H2 amphiphilicity. Interestingly, larger spheres with novel pearl&#8208;chain&#8208;like structures from H2 were observed after adding stoichiometric Zn2+. In particular, H2 shows pH&#8208;responsive emissions in its aggregation state, allowing the visualization of the shuttling movement by just naked eyes. It is assumed that the well&#8208;designed [2]rotaxane, and particularly the proposed concept of MBA shown here, will further enrich the families of MIMs, offering prospects for synthesizing more MIMs with novel assembly capabilities and bottom&#8208;up building dynamic smart materials with unprecedented functions.

         <title>Alkyl Chains Modulated Magnetization Dynamics of Mononuclear Trigonal Prismatic CoII Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Modifying alkyl chains with different lengths at the end of the CoII&#8208;SMM with a rigid D3h coordination geometry influence its magnetization dynamics. Magneto&#8208;structural correlation study reveals that the various deviations of coordination symmetry of CoII ion, diverse crystal packings and possible different vibration modes of substituents caused by modifying alkyl chains are the key factors affecting the magnetization dynamics.







Abstract
Four benzeneboron&#8208;capped mononuclear CoII complexes with different alkyl substitutions on the fourth position of phenylboronic acid were obtained. The CoII ions are all wrapped by the pocket&#8208;like ligands and located in trigonal prismatic coordination geometries. Alternating&#8208;current magnetic susceptibility measurements reveal that they show different magnetization dynamics, such as distinct relaxation rates at the same temperature, the faster QTM rates for the ethyl and propyl substituted complexes, as well as different relaxation processes. Magneto&#8208;structural correlation study reveals that the various deviations of coordination geometry of CoII ion, diverse crystal packings and possible different vibration modes of substituents caused by modifying alkyl chains are the key factors affecting the magnetization dynamics. This work demonstrates that the alkyl chains even locating far away from the metal center can have a large impact on the magnetic behavior of the CoII complex with a very rigid coordination geometry, offering a new perspective towards transition metal based single&#8208;molecule magnets.

         <title>Controlling the Morphological Features, Aspect Ratio and Emission Patterns of Supramolecular Copolymers by Restricted Dimensional Growth</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The spontaneous 1D polymerization of a PE derivative and the 2D polymerization of a BODIPY derivative is controlled by copolymerizing them in different ratios, leading to unusual spindle&#8208;shaped structures with controlled aspect ratio. The resultant supramolecular copolymers exhibit morphology and aspect ratio dependent emission features.







Abstract
One of the bottlenecks associated with supramolecular polymerization of functional &#960;&#8208;systems is the spontaneous assembly of monomers leading to one&#8208; or two&#8208;dimensional (1D or 2D) polymers without control over chain length and optical properties. In the case of supramolecular copolymerization of monomers that are structurally too diverse, preferential self&#8208;sorting occurs unless they are closely interacting donor&#8208;acceptor pairs. Herein, it is established that the spontaneous 1D polymerization of a phenyleneethynylene (PE) derivative and the 2D polymerization of a Bodipy derivative (BODIPY) can be controlled by copolymerizing them in different ratios, leading to unusual spindle&#8208;shaped structures with controlled aspect ratio, as evident by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) studies. For example, when the content of BODIPY is 50&#8201;% in the BODIPY&#8208;PE mixture, the 1D polymerization of PE is significantly restricted to form elongated spindle&#8208;like structures having an aspect ratio of 4&#8211;6. The addition of 75&#8201;% of BODIPY to PE resulted in circular spindles having an aspect ratio of 1&#8211;2.5, thereby completely restricting the 1D polymerization of PE monomers. Moreover, the resultant supramolecular copolymers exhibited morphology and aspect ratio dependent emission features as observed by the time&#8208;resolved emission studies.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Metal Charge Transfer Properties of a Series of Trinuclear Fe2Ru and Corresponding Pentanuclear Fe2Ru2Ag Cyanido&#8208;Bridged Complexes</title>

As the number of methyl groups on the cyclopentadiene of the terminal iron increases, the neighbouring RuII&#8594;FeIII MM&#8242;CT energy increases in both the trinuclear N4+ (FeIII&#8208;NC&#8208;RuII&#8208;CN&#8208;FeIII) and the pentanuclear M5+ (FeIII&#8208;NC&#8208;RuII&#8208;NC&#8208;AgI&#8208;CN&#8208;RuII&#8208;CN&#8208;FeIII) complexes, but the redox potential of the ruthenium in the pentanuclear system shows an opposite trend of change with respect to the corresponding trinuclear complexes.







Abstract
A series of trimetallic cyanidometal&#8208;bridged compounds [MenCp(dppe)FeII&#8208;(&#956;&#8208;NC)&#8208;RuII(MeOpy)4&#8208;(&#956;&#8208;CN)&#8208;FeII(dppe)CpMen] &#8208; [PF6]2 (N[PF6]2, n=0, N =1; n=1, N=2; n=3, N=3; Cp=cyclopentadiene, dppe=1,2&#8208;bis(diphenylphosphino)ethane, MeOpy=4&#8208;methoxypyridine) and their one&#8208; and two&#8208;electron oxidized compounds N3+ and N4+ were synthesized and characterized. Meanwhile, a series of corresponding linear cyanido&#8208;bridged pentanuclear compounds [MenCp(dppe)FeIII&#8208;(&#956;&#8208;NC)&#8208;RuII(MeOpy)4&#8208;(&#956;&#8208;NC)&#8208;AgI&#8208;(&#956;&#8208;CN)&#8208;RuII(MeOpy)4&#8208;(&#956;&#8208;CN)&#8208;FeIII(dppe)CpMen][BF4]5 (M[BF4]5, n=0, M=4; n=1, M=5; n=3, M=6) were also obtained and well characterized. The investigations suggest that in the trinuclear system there exists remote interaction between the two Fe centers, but no significant interactions exist across the central silver unit between the metals on the two sides of the silver center in the pentanuclear system. In both the trinuclear N4+ and the pentanuclear M5+ complexes, there exists the neighboring RuII&#8594;FeIII MM&#8242;CT transitions, and the MM'CT energy in the corresponding trinuclear system is higher than those in the pentanuclear system in which no remote metal&#8208;metal interaction occurs. Meanwhile, as the substituted methyl groups on the cyclopentadiene increases, the redox potential of the ruthenium in the trinuclear N4+ series increases, but that in the pentanuclear M5+ complexes decreases.

         <title>Combining Molecular Quantum Mechanical Modeling and Machine Learning for Accelerated Reaction Screening and Discovery</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By combining molecular quantum mechanical modeling and machine learning, reaction screening and discovery can be accelerated significantly. In this Concept, we walk through the main steps associated with a typical workflow for high&#8208;throughput reaction screening campaigns, and highlight best practices and potential pitfalls at every stage.







Abstract
Molecular quantum mechanical modeling, accelerated by machine learning, has opened the door to high&#8208;throughput screening campaigns of complex properties, such as the activation energies of chemical reactions and absorption/emission spectra of materials and molecules; in&#8197;silico. Here, we present an overview of the main principles, concepts, and design considerations involved in such hybrid computational quantum chemistry/machine learning screening workflows, with a special emphasis on some recent examples of their successful application. We end with a brief outlook of further advances that will benefit the field.

         <title>Highly Functionalized SWCNTs with a Dopamine Derivative as a Support for Pd Nanoparticles: A Recyclable Catalyst for the Reduction of Nitro Compounds and the Heck Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The [3+2] cycloaddition reaction of dopamine azide on SWCNTs in o&#8208;DCB at 160&#8201;&#176;C gave a material with high degree of functionalization still maintaining &#960;&#8208;network of SWCNTs. The presence of the catechol units was exploited to immobilize palladium nanoparticles. The hybrid material was used as a recyclable catalyst for the reduction of nitro compounds and the Heck reaction.







Abstract
Single&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) were functionalized with a dopamine derivative in which the amine group was converted to azide (dopamine azide). The direct reaction of SWCNTs and dopamine azide in o&#8208;dichlorobenzene at high temperature (160&#8201;&#176;C) led to very highly functionalized CNTs (&#8776;60&#8197;wt.%). Surprisingly, despite this high degree of functionalization, Raman spectroscopy detected a low disruption of the &#960;&#8208;network of the carbonaceous support. This finding was justified by the rehybridization from sp3 to sp2 of the sidewall carbon atoms of CNTs involved in the functionalization process. Further characterization by means of different techniques such as X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) allowed to shed some light on the chemical composition and morphology of the obtained material. Moreover, the estimation of the total content of phenolic units and their reducing potential after CNTs functionalization was also assessed using Folin and Ciocalteu and 2,2&#8208;diphenyl&#8208;1&#8208;picryl hydrazide (DPPH) assays. The functionalization of CNTs was exploited to immobilize palladium(II) species that were subsequently reduced with NaBH4 leading to the formation of Pd nanoparticles (NPs). The so obtained hybrid material was used as a recyclable heterogeneous catalyst for the reduction of nitro compounds and the Heck reaction.

         <title>Nucleophile&#8208;Triggered &#960;&#8208;Topological Transformation: A New Synthetic Approach to Near&#8208;Infrared&#8208;Emissive Rhodamines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
&#960;&#8208;Topological transformation&#8208;based synthetic method: A new type of near&#8208;infrared (NIR)&#8208;emissive rhodamine dye, called Polymethine&#8208;embedded Rhodamine Fluorophore (PeR Fluor), has been developed. Linear fully &#960;&#8208;conjugated PeR Fluor is prepared in one step by mixing different nucleophiles (Nu&#8722;) with ABPXs, a family of rhodamines with a cross&#8208;conjugated structure. PeR Fluor exhibits bright NIR fluorescence emission and high photostability.







Abstract
We describe a &#960;&#8208;topological transformation&#8208;based synthetic method for the preparation of a new type of near&#8208;infrared (NIR)&#8208;emissive rhodamine dye called Polymethine&#8208;embedded Rhodamine Fluorophore (PeR Fluor). In contrast to conventional NIR&#8208;emissive dyes that require tedious synthetic steps and/or a high cost, linear fully &#960;&#8208;conjugated PeR Fluor can be regioselectively prepared in one step by mixing different nucleophiles with ABPXs, a family of rhodamines with a cross&#8208;conjugated structure. PeR Fluor exhibits bright NIR fluorescence emission and high photostability owing to the cooperative &#960;&#8208;electron system of rhodamines and polymethine scaffolds. Large bathochromic shifts of the absorption and fluorescence emission maxima can be achieved by modifying the N&#8208;substituted group to obtain NIR&#8208;absorbing/emitting PeR Fluor. We also demonstrate the stimulus&#8208;responsive functionality of PeR Fluor through the addition of chemicals (acid/base), which shows switchable NIR and visible fluorescence response. Our &#960;&#8208;topological transformation&#8208;based synthetic method is a promising approach to produce new functionalized rhodamine dyes.

         <title>Diaroyl&#8208;S,N&#8208;ketene Acetals: Red&#8208;Shifted Solid&#8208;State and Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emitters from a One&#8208;Pot Synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By exploiting the nucleophilicity of aroyl&#8208;S,N&#8208;ketene acetals, 23 diaroyl&#8208;S,N&#8208;ketene acetals can be accessed, although the aroylation leads to a significant bathochromic shift both in the solid and aggregated states as well as an increase in aggregate stability. Cyclized aroyl&#8208;S,N&#8208;ketene acetals can easily be converted into pyrazole systems in a one&#8208;pot synthesis.







Abstract
Symmetric and unsymmetric diaroyl&#8208;S,N&#8208;ketene acetals can be readily accessed in consecutive syntheses in good to excellent yields by exploiting the inherent nucleophilic character of the methine position. Different aroyl&#8208;S,N&#8208;ketene acetals as well as acid chlorides yield a library of 19 diaroyl compounds with substitution and linker pattern&#8208;tunable emission properties, leading to a significant red&#8208;shift of emission in the solid and aggregated state, which was thoroughly investigated. Additionally, the stability of the luminescent aggregates is highly increased. In a follow&#8208;up one&#8208;pot procedure, pyrazolo&#8208;S,N&#8208;ketene acetals can easily be accessed employing a nucleophilic cyclocondensation.

Catalytic amounts of bis(&#951;5&#8201;:&#8201;&#951;1&#8208;pentafulvene)titanium in the reaction with Lewis base&#8208;stabilized phosphinoborane monomers provide a convenient new route to polyphosphinoboranes. This method offers access to high molecular mass materials under very mild conditions and short reaction times. The findings represent an unprecedented example of a transition&#8208;metal mediated polymerization of Lewis base&#8208;stabilized alkylphosphinoborane.







Abstract
The reaction of the Lewis base&#8208;stabilized phosphinoborane monomer tBuHPBH2NMe3 (2&#8201;a) with catalytic amounts of bis(&#951;5:&#951;1&#8208;adamantylidenepentafulvene)titanium (1) provides a convenient new route to the polyphosphinoborane [tBuPH&#8208;BH2]n (3&#8201;a). This method offers access to high molar mass materials under mild conditions and with short reaction times (20&#8201;&#176;C, 1&#8197;h in toluene). It represents an unprecedented example of a transition metal&#8208;mediated polymerization of a Lewis base&#8208;stabilized Group 13/15 compound. Preliminary studies of the substrate scope and a potential mechanism are reported.

         <title>&#8220;Holographic&#8221; Autostereoscopic Displays: A Perspective on Their Technology and Potential Impact in Chemistry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Adding dimensions to chemistry: I explore the potential of &#8220;holographic&#8221; autostereoscopic displays in chemistry research and education. This perspective delves into how this emerging technology could enhance the understanding of complex molecular structures, offering a more immersive and intuitive learning and research experience.







Abstract
The three&#8208;dimensional arrangement of atoms in molecules is essential for understanding their properties and behavior. Traditional 2D representations and digital 3D models presented on 2D media often fall short in conveying the complexity of molecular structures. Autostereoscopic displays, often marketed as &#8220;holographic&#8221; displays, pose a potential solution to this challenge. These displays, with their multi&#8208;view and single&#8208;view configurations, promise to advance chemistry education and research by offering accurate 3D representations with depth and parallax. In this perspective, I delve into the possibilities and limitations of autostereoscopic displays in chemistry, discussing the underlying technology and potential applications, from research to teaching and science communication. Multi&#8208;view autostereoscopic displays excel in facilitating collaborative work by enabling multiple viewers to simultaneously perceive the same 3D structure from different angles. However, they currently suffer from low resolution and high cost, which could limit their immediate widespread adoption. Conversely, single&#8208;view autostereoscopic displays with eye&#8208;tracking, while limited to one viewer at a time, provide higher resolution at a lower cost, thus suggesting that they might become the technology of the future given the balance of price to performance. Despite current limitations, autostereoscopic displays possess undeniable potential for shaping the future of chemistry education and research.

         <title>Beta Amyloid Oligomers with Higher Cytotoxicity have Higher Sidechain Dynamics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The chemical states of the residues from K16 to K28 are different between the 10&#8208;nm and 23&#8208;nm beta amyloid oligomers. We find that the 10&#8208;nm oligomers are more cytotoxic, and the sidechain molecular motion of the residue K16 is more dynamic. Our data raise an interesting possibility that the cytotoxicity of A&#946;40 oligomers could also be correlated to the motional dynamics of the sidechains.







Abstract
The underlying biophysical principle governing the cytotoxicity of the oligomeric aggregates of &#946;&#8208;amyloid (A&#946;) peptides has long been an enigma. Here we show that the size of A&#946;40 oligomers can be actively controlled by incubating the peptides in reverse micelles. Our approach allowed for the first time a detailed comparison of the structures and dynamics of two A&#946;40 oligomers of different sizes, viz., 10 and 23&#8197;nm, by solid&#8208;state NMR. From the chemical shift data, we infer that the conformation and/or the chemical environments of the residues from K16 to K28 are different between the 10&#8208;nm and 23&#8208;nm oligomers. We find that the 10&#8208;nm oligomers are more cytotoxic, and the molecular motion of the sidechain of its charged residue K16 is more dynamic. Interestingly, the residue A21 exhibits unusually high structural rigidity. Our data raise an interesting possibility that the cytotoxicity of A&#946;40 oligomers could also be correlated to the motional dynamics of the sidechains.

         <title>Porphyrin&#8208;based Bi&#8208;MOFs with Enriched Surface Bi Active Sites for Boosting Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The inherent challenges in using metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) for photocatalytic CO2 reduction are the combination of wide&#8208;range light harvesting, efficient charge separation and transfer as well as highly exposed catalytic active sites for CO2 activation and reduction. We present here a promising solution to satisfy these requirements together by modulating the crystal facet and surface atomic structure of a porphyrin&#8208;based bismuth&#8208;MOF (Bi&#8208;PMOF). The series of structural and photo&#8208;electronic characterizations together with photocatalytic CO2 reduction experiment collectively establish that the enriched Bi active sites on the (010) surface prefer to promote efficient charge separation and transfer as well as the activation and reduction of CO2. Specifically, the Bi&#8208;PMOFs&#8208;120&#8208;F with enriched surface Bi active sites exhibits optimum photocatalytic CO2 reduction performance to CO (28.61 umol&#183;h&#8208;1g&#8208;1) and CH4 (8.81 umol&#183;h&#8208;1g&#8208;1). This work provides new insights to synthesize highly efficient main group p&#8208;block metal Bi&#8208;MOF photocatalysts for CO2 reduction through a facet&#8208;regulation strategy and sheds light on the surface structure&#8208;activity relationships of the MOFs.</dc:description>

         <title>Biomass Separators as a&#8220;Lifesaver&#8221;for Safe and Long&#8208;Life Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The growth&#160;of lithium dendrites and the shuttle of polysulfides in lithium metal batteries (LMBs) have hindered their development. In LMBs, the cathode and anode are separated by a separator, although this does not solve the battery's issues. The use of biomass materials is widespread for modifying the separator due to their porous structure and abundant functional groups. LMBs perform more electrochemically when lithium ions are deposited uniformly and polysulfide shuttling is reduced using biomass separators. In this&#160;review, we analyze the growth of lithium dendrite and the shuttle of polysulfide in LMBs, summarize the types of biomass separator materials and the mechanisms of action&#160;(providing mechanical barriers, promoting uniform deposition of metal ions, capturing polysulfides, shielding polysulfide).&#160;The prospect of developing new separator materials from the perspective of regulating ion transport and physical sieving efficiency as well as the application of advanced technologies such as synchrotron radiation to characterize the mechanism of action of biomass separators is also proposed.</dc:description>

         <title>Graphene Oxide Nanosheets Hamper Glutamate Mediated Excitotoxicity and Protect Neuronal Survival In An In vitro Stroke Model</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Small graphene oxide (s&#8208;GO) nanosheets reversibly downregulate central nervous system (CNS) excitatory synapses, with potential developments as future therapeutic tools to treat neuro&#8208;disorders characterized by altered glutamatergic transmission. Excitotoxicity, namely cell death triggered by exceeding ambient glutamate fueling over&#8208;activation of excitatory synapses, is a pathogenic mechanism shared by several neural diseases, from ischemic stroke to neurodegenerative disorders. Here we exposed CNS cultures to oxygen&#8208;glucose deprivation (OGD) to mimic ischemic stroke in vitro, and we show that the delivery of s&#8208;GO following OGD, during the endogenous build&#8208;up of secondary damage and excitotoxicity, improved neuronal survival. In a different paradigm, we reproduced excitotoxicity cell damage through exogenous glutamate application, and we observed that s&#8208;GO co&#8208;treatment protected neuronal integrity, potentially by directly downregulating the synaptic over&#8208;activation brought about by exogenous glutamate. In our proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept study we suggest that s&#8208;GO may find novel applications in therapeutic developments for treating excitotoxicity&#8208;driven neural cell death.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Using the popular metal&#8208;ligand axial coordination self&#8208;assembly approach, donor&#8208;acceptor conjugates have been constructed using zinc tetrapyrroles (porphyrin (ZnP), phthalocyanine (ZnPc), and naphthalocyanine (ZnNc)) as electron donors and imidazole functionalized tetracyanobutadiene (Im&#8208;TCBD) and Im&#8208;DCNQ) as electron acceptors.&#160; The newly formed donor&#8208;acceptor conjugates were fully characterized by a suite of physicochemical methods, including absorption and emission, electrochemistry, and computational methods.

         <title>Heterobimetallic Complexes Bridged by an Unsymmetrical Bis(NHC) Ligand: Study of Enhanced Catalytic Activity in Tandem Transformations and Understanding of Cooperativity between the Metal Centers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The bis(azolium) salt [L1&#8208;H2]Br2 was found to serve as a suitable platform for accessing the heterobimetallic IrIII&#8208;M (M = PdII/AuI) and PdII&#8208;IrIII complexes. Initially, selective mono&#8208;metalation of [L1&#8208;H2]Br2 yielded an orthometalated IrIII&#8208; or non&#8208;orthometalated PdII&#8208;complex. Sequential metalation of the mono&#8208;IrIII complex resulted in the formation of heterobimetallic IrIII&#8208;PdII/AuI complexes. Similarly, a distinct heterobimetallic PdII&#8208;IrIII complex was synthesized starting from the mono&#8208;PdII complex. Further, the corresponding homobimetallic IrIII&#8208;IrIII and PdII&#8208;PdII complexes were directly obtained from [L1&#8208;H2]Br2. Additionally, monometallic PdII and IrIII analogues were synthesized from [L2&#8208;H]Br and [L3&#8208;H]Br, respectively. The heterobimetallic IrIII&#8208;PdII and PdII&#8208;IrIII complexes were then evaluated as catalysts in various one&#8208;pot tandem catalytic reactions in which they demonstrated superior activity than the mixtures of both their corresponding homobimetallic IrIII&#8208;IrIII/PdII&#8208;PdII and monometallic IrIII/PdII counterparts, under the constant concentrations of metal centers. Moreover, while comparing complexes IrIII&#8208;PdII and PdII&#8208;IrIII, the former exhibits higher activity in all the studied reactions. All these findings suggest the presence of some form of cooperativity between the two metal centers (Ir and Pd) connected by a single ligand framework in IrIII&#8208;PdII and PdII&#8208;IrIII complex, with IrIII&#8208;PdII displaying better cooperativity that has been validated by electrochemical, NMR, and DFT studies.</dc:description>

         <title>Bioinspired Hydrophobicity for Enhancing Electrochemical CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrochemical carbon dioxide reduction (CO2R) is a promising pathway for converting greenhouse gasses into valuable fuels and chemicals using intermittent renewable energy. Enormous efforts have been invested in developing and designing CO2R electrocatalysts suitable for industrial applications at accelerated reaction rates. The microenvironment, specifically the local CO2 concentration (local [CO2]) as well as the water and ion transport at the CO2&#8211;electrolyte&#8211;catalyst interface, also significantly impacts the current density, Faradaic efficiency (FE), and operation stability. In nature, hydrophobic surfaces of aquatic arachnids trap appreciable amounts of gas due to the &#8220;plastron effect&#8221;, which could inspire the reliable design of CO2R catalysts and devices to enrich gaseous CO2. In this review, starting from the wettability modulation, we summarize CO2 enrichment strategies to enhance CO2R. To begin, superwettability systems in nature and their inspiration for concentrating CO2 in CO2R are described and discussed. Moreover, other CO2 enrichment strategies, compatible with the hydrophobicity modulation, are explored from the perspectives of catalysts, electrolytes, and electrolyzers, respectively. Finally, a perspective on the future development of CO2 enrichment strategies is provided. We envision that this review could provide new guidance for further developments of CO2R toward practical applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Stretched Central Double Bonds in Dialumene and Disilene by Amino Substituents: A Case of Lone Pair Repulsion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The block&#8208;localized wavefunction method at the density functional theory level is employed to study dialumene and disilene bearing two amino substituents. The origin of the significantly stretched central M=M (M=Al or Si) double bonds in these molecules is the repulsion between the lone electron pairs of amino substituents and M=M &#960; bond. Replacing the substituent groups &#8722;NH2 with &#8722;BH2 can enhance the planarity and shorten the central double bonds due to the absence of lone pair electrons in BH2.







Abstract
There have been remarkable advances in the syntheses and applications of groups 13 and 14 homonuclear ethene analogues. However, successes are largely limited to aryl&#8208; and/or silyl&#8208;substituted species. Analogues bearing two or more heteroatoms are still scarce. In this work, the block&#8208;localized wavefunction (BLW) method at the density functional theory (DFT) level was employed to study dialumene and disilene bearing two amino substituents whose optimal geometries exhibit significantly stretched central M=M (M=Al or Si) double bonds compared with aryl&#8208; and/or silyl&#8208;substituted species. Computational analyses showed that the repulsion between the lone electron pairs of amino substituents and M=M &#960; bond plays a critical role in the elongation of the M=M bonds. Evidently, replacing the substituent groups &#8722;NH2 with &#8722;BH2 can enhance the planarity and shorten the central double bonds due to the absence of lone pair electrons in BH2.

         <title>Donor&#8208;Acceptor Activation of Carbon Dioxide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The cooperative activation of carbon dioxide by donor&#8208;acceptor interactions have become a highly popular strategy whose chemical designs span across the whole periodic table. This perspective categorizes the wide variety of systems reported and assesses their limitations and prospects to develop catalytic functionalization protocols.







Abstract
The activation and functionalization of carbon dioxide entails great interest related to its abundance, low toxicity and associated environmental problems. However, the inertness of CO2 has posed a challenge towards its efficient conversion to added&#8208;value products. In this review we discuss one of the strategies that have been widely used to capture and activate carbon dioxide, namely the use of donor&#8208;acceptor interactions by partnering a Lewis acidic and a Lewis basic fragment. This type of CO2 activation resembles that found in metalloenzymes, whose outstanding performance in catalytically transforming carbon dioxide encourages further bioinspired research. We have divided this review into three general sections based on the nature of the active sites: metal&#8208;free examples (mainly formed by frustrated Lewis pairs), main group&#8208;transition metal combinations, and transition metal heterobimetallic complexes. Overall, we discuss one hundred compounds that cooperatively activate carbon dioxide by donor&#8208;acceptor interactions, revealing a wide range of structural motifs.

         <title>Ruthenium&#8208;Catalyzed Selective &#945;&#8208;Alkylation of &#946;&#8208;Naphthols using Primary Alcohols: Elucidating the Influence of Base and Water</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed site selective &#945;&#8208;alkylation of &#946;&#8208;naphthols using both arylmethanols and aliphatic alcohols as alkylating agents is reported in which water is the only byproduct. Mechanistic investigations indicate that the reactions proceed via aldehyde intermediates. DFT studies revealed that the base and in&#8197;situ generated water play important roles in catalysis.







Abstract
Functionalized arenes and arenols have diverse applications in chemical synthesis and material chemistry. Selective functionalization of arenols is a topic of prime interest. In particular, direct alkylation of arenols using alcohols is a challenging task. In this report, a ruthenium pincer catalyzed direct &#945;&#8208;alkylation of &#946;&#8208;naphthol using primary alcohols as alkylating reagents is reported. Notably, aryl and heteroaryl methanols and linear and branched aliphatic alcohols underwent selective alkylation reactions, in which water is the only byproduct. Notably, catalytically derived &#945;&#8208;alkyl&#8208;&#946;&#8208;naphthol products displayed high absorbance, emissive properties, and quantum yields (up to 93.2&#8201;%). Dearomative bromination on &#945;&#8208;alkyl&#8208;&#946;&#8208;naphthol is demonstrated as a synthetic application. Mechanistic studies indicate that the reaction involves an aldehyde intermediate. DFT studies support this finding and further reveal that a stoichiometric amount of base is required to make the aldol condensation as well as elementary steps required for regeneration of catalytically active species. In situ&#8208;generated water molecule from the aldol condensation reaction plays an important role in the regeneration of an active catalyst.

         <title>FeIII&#8208;Based Eutectic Mixtures as Multi&#8208;task and Reusable Reaction Media for Efficient and Selective Conversion of Alkynes into Carbonyl Compounds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thanks to the use of a sustainable FeIII&#8208;based deep eutectic solvent (DES) as promoter/reaction medium, alkynes were hydrated under bench&#8208;type reaction conditions (45&#8201;&#176;C, air, absence of co&#8208;catalysts or co&#8208;solvents). This Fe&#8208;DES could be recycled for up to eight consecutives runs in the absence of any VOC solvent (E factor = 10). Furthermore, the Fe&#8208;DES is able to promote the efficient formal oxidation of internal alkynes into 1,2&#8208;diketones, with the system being recycled up to three consecutive times. More information can be found in the Research Article by A. Presa&#8197;Soto, V. del&#8197;Amo, J. Garc&#237;a&#8208;&#193;lvarez, and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202301736).

         <title>A 2,2&#8208;Difluoroimidazolidine Derivative for Deoxyfluorination Reactions: Mechanistic Insights by Experimental and Computational Studies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fluorination: The deoxyfluorinating agent SIMesF2 converts carboxylic acids into acyl fluorides and is capable of difluorinating aldehydes. Experimental and computational studies show that an imidazolidinium salt bearing an F(HF)2&#8722; anion serves as crucial intermediate.







Abstract
A N&#8208;heterocyclic deoxyfluorinating agent SIMesF2 was synthesized by nucleophilic fluorination of N,N&#8208;1,3&#8208;dimesityl&#8208;2&#8208;chloroimidazolidinium chloride (3) at room temperature. SIMesF2 was applied to deoxyfluorinate carboxylic acids and alcohols and convert benzaldehyde into difluorotoluene. Mechanistic studies by NMR spectroscopy suggest reaction pathways of the carboxylic acid to acyl fluoride via outer&#8208;sphere fluorinations at an imidazolidinium ion by polyfluoride. DFT studies give further insight by exploring mechanistic details which distinguish the fluorination of aldehydes from that of carboxylic acids. Furthermore, a consecutive reaction sequence for the oxidation of an aldehyde followed by in&#8197;situ fluorination of the generated carboxylic acid was developed.

         <title>Heterocyclic [9]Helicenes Exhibiting Bright Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Easy access to brightly blue fluorescent [9]helicenes! The CPL brightness reaches up to 17&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;1 as measured experimentally and verified computationally, which makes this the highest CPL brightness among heterocyclic helicenes.







Abstract
We describe a concise synthetic strategy for the preparation of heterocyclic [9]helicenes and a simple preparative&#8208;scale protocol for the optical resolution of the resulting M&#8208; and P&#8208;enantiomers. The helicenes were characterized by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction along with a range of spectroscopic and computational techniques. A fluorescence quantum yield of up to 65&#8201;% was observed, and the chiroptical properties of both M&#8208; and P&#8208;helicenes revealed large dissymmetry factors. The circularly polarized luminescence brightness reaches up to 17&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;1, as measured experimentally and verified computationally, which makes this the highest circularly polarized luminescence brightness among heterocyclic helicenes. We describe how chiroptical properties (both circular dichroism and circularly polarized luminescence) can be described and predicted using quantum chemical calculations. The synthetic approach also reveals by&#8208;products that originate from internal oxidation reactions, presumably mediated by the close proximity of the &#960;&#8208;surfaces in the helicene structure.

         <title>Preparation of Trimetallic&#8208;Organic Framework Film Electrodes via Secondary Growth for Efficient Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Via a secondary growth strategy, FeCoNi&#8208;btz/NF electrodes, integrating cationic MOF frameworks, trimetallic coupling effects together with continuous and dense morphology, are successfully fabricated for enhanced OER performance.







Abstract
Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) are promising electrocatalysts for clean energy conversion systems. However, developing MOF&#8208;based electrodes with high performance toward oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is still challenging. In this work, a series of MOF film electrodes derived from Ni&#8208;btz were prepared by employing the secondary growth strategy under solvothermal conditions. Fe and Co ions were also incorporated into the Ni&#8208;btz framework to produce a trimetallic coupling effect to obtain enhanced OER activity. The as&#8208;prepared FeCoNi&#8208;btz/NF exhibited not only good stability but also excellent OER performance under alkaline conditions. Furthermore, the possible intermediates including metal oxides and metal oxyhydroxides were confirmed by X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM).

         <title>Mechanical Interlocking to Unlock the Reinforcing Potential of Carbon Nanotubes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mechanically interlocked derivatives of single&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes (MINTs) improve the interaction between SWNT fillers and polymer matrix in nanocomposites. As a result, MINTs show improvements of more than 100&#8201;% on Youngs Modulus and tensile strength for polymers of different chemical nature. Classic supramolecular chemistry concepts can be used to understand the polymer&#8208;nanofiller interactions, opening the way to further optimization.







Abstract
Single&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) present extraordinary mechanical properties, with Youngs&#8217; modulus&gt;1&#8197;TPa and tensile strength&gt;50&#8197;GPa; this makes them ideal candidates as fillers for the reinforcement of polymers. However, the performance of SWNTs in this field has fallen behind expectations. This is due to a combination of imperfect individualization of the SWNTs and poor load transfer from the polymer to the SWNTs. Here, we study the reinforcement of polymers of different chemical nature using mechanically interlocked derivatives of single&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes (MINTs). We compare the mechanical properties of fibers made of poly (methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) and polysulfone (PSU) and their composites made with pristine SWNTs, MINTs, and the corresponding supramolecular models. With very low loading of MINTs (0.01&#8201;% w/w), improvements of more than 100&#8201;% on Youngs Modulus and the tensile strength are observed for both the nonpolar aliphatic PMMA and the very polar aromatic PSU polymers, while pristine carbon nanotubes and the supramolecular nanofillers showed smaller reinforcement. These data, together with our previous report on the reinforcement of polystyrene (nonpolar and aromatic), indicate that derivatization of SWNTs as MINTs is a valid general strategy to optimize the interaction between SWNT fillers and the polymer matrix.

         <title>A Saddle&#8208;Shaped Expanded Porphyrinoid Fitting C60
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A saddle&#8208;shaped macrocyclic host: An expanded porphyrinoid macrocycle with a saddle&#8208;shaped structure was synthesized. It is suitable for host&#8211;guest complexation by &#960;&#8208; &#960; interactions with four equivalents of fullerene C60 in all three directions. UV/vis/NIR transient absorption spectroscopy exhibits a strong long&#8208;lived NIR absorption reminiscent of that of porphyrins but shows no porphyrin&#8208;type Q&#8208;band.







Abstract
We present the synthesis of a new type of an expanded porphyrinoid macrocycle with a saddle&#8208;shaped morphology and its complexation of C60 guest molecules. The new macrocycle contains four carbazole and four triazole moieties and can be readily synthesized via a copper&#8208;catalyzed click reaction. It shows specific photo&#8208;physical properties including fluorescence with a high quantum yield of 60&#8201;%. The combination of the saddle&#8208;shaped geometry with the expanded &#960;&#8208;system allows for host&#8211;guest interactions with C60 in a stacked polymer fashion. Evidence for the presence of a host&#8211;guest complex is provided both in solution by NMR spectroscopy and in the solid state by X&#8208;ray structure analysis.

         <title>Transition&#8208;Metal&#8208;Free Synthesis of Enantioenriched Tertiary and Quaternary &#945;&#8208;Chiral Allylsilanes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enantioenriched tertiary and quaternary &#945;&#8208;chiral allylsilanes have been obtained by metal&#8208;free asymmetric allylic alkylation of &#947;&#8208;substituted primary allylic bromides with primary alkyl Grignard reagents activated by a chiral Alexakis&#8208;type NHC ligand.







Abstract
Access to enantioenriched tertiary and quaternary &#945;&#8208;chiral allysilanes without any transition&#8208;metal catalyst is reported. This was achieved by enantioselective allylic displacement of &#947;&#8208;silylated allylic bromides through Lewis base activation of Grignard reagents by a bidentate chiral NHC ligand. The process afforded both high &#947;&#8208;regio&#8208; and enantioselectivity and is compatible with a wide range of silyl groups on the substrates.

         <title>Post&#8208;Installation of Fused Benzoheptagons at the Periphery of NiII Porphyrins: Helical Structures and Conformation&#8208;Adjustable Fullerenes Binding</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A porphyrin dimer containing two seven&#8208;membered rings in the bridging moiety was made! Fused&#8208;benzoheptagon&#8208;installed NiII porphyrins were synthesized by a newly developed protocol. The porphyrin dimer is in a helix state in solution on its own, but when a fullerene comes along, it curls up and catches the fullerene. The seven&#8208;membered ring at the bridging site serves to provide flexibility to the porphyrin dimer.@naist_aratani @NAIST_MS_JP







Abstract
Fused&#8208;benzoheptagon&#8208;installed NiII porphyrins were synthesized by a protocol consisting of (2&#8208;formyl)arylation at the meso&#8208;position(s) of NiII porphyrins, conversion of formyl group to methoxyethene group by Wittig reaction, and final Bi(OTf)3&#8208;catalyzed cyclization. The structures of these porphyrins have been revealed by X&#8208;ray analysis. Owing to the installed heptagon ring(s), these porphyrins show curved structures with conformational flexibility. Dimer has been shown to have a small activation barrier for inversion and to capture C60 and C70 with large association constants with adjustable conformational changes.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A porphyrin dimer containing two seven&lt;/b&gt;-&lt;b&gt;membered rings&lt;/b&gt; in the bridging moiety was made! Fused-benzoheptagon-installed Ni&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt; porphyrins were synthesized by a newly developed protocol. The porphyrin dimer is in a helix state in solution on its own, but when a fullerene comes along, it curls up and catches the fullerene. The seven-membered ring at the bridging site serves to provide flexibility to the porphyrin dimer.@naist_aratani @NAIST_MS_JP

         <title>Pd&#8208;Catalyzed Activation of Carbon&#8211;Carbon Bonds in Hydroxymethylfurfural Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The palladium&#8208;catalyzed activation of carbon&#8208;carbon bonds in derivatives of hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) has been developed for the arylation with iodobenzenes. Mechanistic studies suggest a decarboxylative mechanism. This strategy offers an efficient and sustainable approach for the synthesis of arylfuran derivatives.







Abstract
Palladium&#8208;catalyzed activation of C&#8722;C bonds in organic molecules is a powerful tool for the synthesis of value&#8208;added compounds. 5&#8208;Hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) derivatives are a promising class of biomass&#8208;derived chemicals that have received considerable attention due to their potential applications in the synthesis of biologically active molecules and materials. However, the selective activation of unstrained C&#8722;C bonds is a challenging task, mainly due to their relatively high bond dissociation energies. Herein, we report a palladium&#8208;catalyzed method for the efficient C&#8722;C bond activation of HMF derivatives, enabling their arylation with iodobenzenes. Mechanistic studies, including reaction&#8208;profile analysis, competition experiments and head&#8208;space IR spectroscopy suggest a decarboxylative mechanism.

         <title>Panchromatic Light&#8208;Capturing Bis&#8208;styryl BODIPY&#8208;Perylenediimide Donor&#8211;Acceptor Constructs: Occurrence of Sequential Energy Transfer Followed by Electron Transfer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Wide&#8208;band&#8208;capturing artificial photosynthetic model compounds featuring bisstyrylBODIPY and perylene diimide have been newly synthesized to probe excited&#8208;state energy and electron transfer. Excited&#8208;state DFT and free&#8208;energy calculations supported the occurrence of such photo events. Pump&#8211;probe spectroscopy provided the ultimate evidence wherein the measured rate constants for energy transfer were in the range of 1011&#8197;s&#8722;1, while the electron transfer rate constants were in the range of 10&#8197;s&#8722;1, thus highlighting their potential use in solar energy harvesting.

         <title>Boosting the oxygen evolution activity of FeNi oxides/hydroxides by molecular and atomic engineering</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>FeNi oxides/hydroxides are the best performing catalysts for oxidizing water at basic pH. Consequently, their improvement is the cornerstone to develop more efficient artificial photosynthetic systems. During the last 5 years different reports have demonstrated an enhancement of their activity by engineering their structures via: (1) modulation of the number of oxygen, iron and nickel vacancies;(2) single atoms (SAs) doping with metals such as Au, Ir, Ru and Pt; and (3) modification of their surface using organic ligands. All these strategies have led to more active and stable electrocatalysts for oxygen evolution rection (OER). In this Concept we critically analyze these strategies using the most relevant examples.</dc:description>

         <title>Pioneering the Power of Twin&#160;Bonds in a Revolutionary Double Bond Formation. Unveiling the True Identity of o&#8208;Carboryne as o&#8208;Carborene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The homolytic elimination of two H atoms from two adjacent carbons in benzene results in the aromatic product o&#8208;benzyne. In a similar way, the homolytic elimination of two H atoms from the two adjacent carbons in 1,2&#8208;C2B10H12 results in the aromatic product o&#8208;carboryne. In this work, we provide experimental and computational evidences that despite the similarity of o&#8208;carboryne and o&#8208;benzyne, the nature of the C&#8211;C bond generated between two adjacent carbons that lose H atoms is different. While in o&#8208;benzyne the C&#8211;C bond behaves as a triple bond, in o&#8208;carboryne the C&#8211;C bond is a double bond. Therefore, we must stop naming o&#8208;carboryne to 1,2&#8208;dehydro&#8208;o&#8208;carborane but to call it o&#8208;carborene.</dc:description>

         <title>Geometrically Deformed and Conformationally Rigid Phosphorus Trisamides featuring an Unsymmetrical Backbone</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nonclassical P(III) centers have attracted much attention in recent years. Incorporating a P(III) center in a rigid bicyclic platform offers a particularly attractive way to invoke significant geometric distortion of the phosphorus atom that may in turn induce unusual reactivity. Although still relatively scarcely explored, phosphorus centers enforced in a non&#8208;C3 symmetry have gained significant traction lately. However, the current scaffolds are based on a relatively limited set of design principles and ligand platforms associated therewith. We herein focus on the synthesis as well as versatile oxidation, addition and coordination chemistry of geometrically distorted P(III) species featuring a synthetically modular, nonsymmetric trisamine platform derived from 2&#8208;(methylamino)&#8208;N&#8208;(2&#8208;(methylamino)phenyl)benzenesulfonamide.</dc:description>

         <title>Symmetrical and Mixed Tris(acyl)phosphines: Synthesis, Oxidation and Photochemistry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we present a convenient synthesis for symmetrical and mixed substituted tris(acyl)phosphines (TAPs) starting from red phosphorus. All TAPs exhibit a phosphaalkene&#8208;acylphosphine equilibrium, which was investigated in detail by variable&#8208;temperature (VT) NMR spectroscopy supported by density&#8208;functional theory (DFT) calculations. Depending on the substituents, two phosphaalkene derivatives and six acylphosphine derivatives could be isolated. NMR spectroscopy and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray crystallography enabled a clear structural assignment of these compounds. Oxidation of selected TAPs led to the formation of the corresponding tris(acyl)phosphine oxides (TAPOs). Furthermore, their spectroscopic properties as well as their photochemistry was investigated. Especially, the TAPO compounds were evaluated for their suitability as photoinitiators by CIDNP spectroscopy, photobleaching measurements and by storage stability tests.</dc:description>

Oxidation of selected TAPs led to the formation of the corresponding tris(acyl)phosphine oxides (TAPOs). Furthermore, their spectroscopic properties as well as their photochemistry was investigated. Especially, the TAPO compounds were evaluated for their suitability as photoinitiators by CIDNP spectroscopy, photobleaching measurements and by storage stability tests.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Initial quenching efficiency determines light&#8208;driven H2 evolution of [Mo3S13]2&#8208; in lipid bilayers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nature uses reactive components embedded in biological membranes to perform light&#8208;driven photosynthesis. Here, we report a model artificial photosynthetic system for light&#8208;driven hydrogen (H2) evolution. The system is based on liposomes where amphiphilic ruthenium trisbipyridine based photosensitizer (RuC9) and the H2 evolution reaction (HER) catalyst [Mo3S13]2&#8208; are embedded in biomimetic phospholipid membranes. When DMPC was used as the main lipid of these light&#8208;active liposomes, increased catalytic activity (TONCAT ~ 200) was observed compared to purely aqueous conditions. Although all tested lipid matrixes, including DMPC, DOPG, DPPC and DOPG liposomes provided similar liposomal structures according to TEM analysis, only DMPC yielded high H2 amounts. In situ scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM) measurements using Pd microsensors revealed an induction period of around 26 minutes prior to H2 evolution, indicating an activation mechanism which might be induced by the fluid&#8208;gel phase transition of DMPC at room temperature. Stern Volmer&#8208;type quenching studies revealed that electron transfer dynamics from the excited state photosensitizer are most efficient in the DMPC lipid environment giving insight for design of artificial photosynthetic systems using lipid bilayer membranes.</dc:description>

         <title>Design and Synthesis of Co&#8208;initiators via Base&#8208;Catalysed Sequential Conjugate Addition: Application in Photoinduced Radical Polymerisation Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly efficient synthesis of a co&#8208;initiator for a type&#8208;II photoinitiator promoted photoinduced radical polymerzation reaction via a barrierless catalytic sequential conjugate addition reaction. The computational study confirms the presence of a low HOMO&#8208;LUMO gap for the newly developed addition reaction. The 1,2&#8208;benzenedithiol&#8208;based co&#8208;initiator turned out to be very efficient for the polymerization and the resultant polymeric material has excellent physical properties for dental restoration and 3D&#8208;printing.







Abstract
Applications of photochemistry are becoming very popular in modern&#8208;day life due to its operational simplicity, environmentally friendly and economically sustainable nature in comparison to thermochemistry. In particular photoinduced radical polymerisation (PRP) reactions are finding more biological applications and especially in the areas of dental restoration processes, tissue engineering and artificial bone generation. A type&#8208;II photoinitiator and co&#8208;initiator&#8208;promoted PRP turned out to be a cost&#8208;effective protocol, and herein we report the design and synthesis of a new efficient co&#8208;initiator for a PRP reaction via a barrierless sequential conjugate addition reaction. Experimental mechanistic observations have been further complemented by computational data. Time for newly synthesised 1,2&#8208;benzenedithiol (DTH) based co&#8208;initiator promoted polymerisation of urethane dimethacrylate (UDMA, 70&#8201;%) and triethylene glycol dimethacrylate (TEGDMA, 30&#8201;%) in presence of 450&#8197;nm LED (15&#8197;W) under the aerobic conditions is 38&#8197;seconds. Polymeric material has high glass transition temperature, improved mechanical strength (860 BHN) and longer in&#8208;depth polymerisation (3&#8197;cm).

         <title>Versatile Synthesis of Symmetric and Unsymmetric Imines via Photoelectrochemical Catalysis: Application to N&#8208;Terminal Modification of Phenylalanine</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photoelectrochemical strategy for synthesizing imines efficiently is introduced, including both symmetric and unsymmetric imines. Of note, the method is successfully applied to perform the cross&#8208;coupling of N&#8208;terminal phenylalanine residues, highlighting its potential in chemical biology applications. This strategy presents a convenient platform for imine synthesis with broad implications in drug development and organic synthesis.







Abstract
A strategy that combines electrochemical synthesis and photoredox catalysis was reported for the efficient synthesis of imines. This approach was demonstrated to be highly versatile in producing various types of imines, including symmetric and unsymmetric imines, by exploring the impact of different substituents on the benzene ring of the arylamine. Additionally, the method was specifically applied to modify N&#8208;terminal phenylalanine residues and was found to be successful in the photoelectrochemical cross&#8208;coupling reaction between NH2&#8208;Phe&#8208;OMe and aryl methylamines, leading to the synthesis of phenylalanine&#8208;containing imines. Therefore, this technique would present a convenient and efficient platform for synthesizing imines, with promising applications in chemical biology, drug development, and organic synthesis.

         <title>CO2&#8208;Mediated Photocatalytic Chlorine Production Over Bismuth Oxychloride in Chloride Solution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The introduction of CO2 would enhance the productivity of Cl2 from 8.24&#8197;&#956;mol&#8901;h&#8722;1 to 39.6&#8197;&#956;mol&#8901;h&#8722;1 in NaCl solution over BiOCl. Experimental studies reveal that the cycle of carbonate species and the interaction between CO2 and the catalyst of BiOCl play a significant role in this process. This work provides a new feasible method of using abundant CO2 resources to accelerate the process of Cl2 production via photocatalysis.







Abstract
As one of the most commonly bulky chemicals, chlorine is conventionally manufactured by electrolysis of NaCl solution in the chlor&#8211;alkali process, which requires a huge supply of electrical energy. The photocatalytic route to produce chlorine by using solar energy and NaCl solution offers a promising strategy to reduce energy consumption and bring economic benefits. Herein, it was found that the introduction of CO2 would enhance the productivity of Cl2 from 8.24&#8197;&#956;mol&#8901;h&#8722;1 to 39.6&#8197;&#956;mol&#8901;h&#8722;1 in NaCl solution over BiOCl. Experimental studies reveal that the CO2 species (CO32&#8722;) entered into the crystal texture of BiOCl and the interlayer space between [Bi2O2]2+ slabs were increased and distorted, accelerating the cycle of Cl species. Besides, the cycle of carbonate species also existed and accelerated the reaction efficiency of Cl&#8722; oxidation to Cl2. This work provides a new feasible method of using abundant CO2 resources to accelerate the process of chlorine production via photocatalysis.

         <title>Alternating Stereospecificity upon Central&#8208;Atom Change: Dynamics of the F&#8722;+PH2Cl SN2 Reaction Compared to its C&#8208; and N&#8208;Centered Analogues</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dynamical central&#8208;atom effects in SN2 reactions are investigated, with special regard to stereochemistry, by preforming quasi&#8208;classical trajectory simulations on a novel full&#8208;dimensional ab initio potential energy surface for the F&#8722;+PH2Cl reaction, as well as by comparing its dynamics and mechanisms to the N&#8208; and C&#8208;centered analogues.







Abstract
Central&#8208;atom effects on bimolecular nucleophilic substitution (SN2) reactions are well&#8208;known in chemistry, however, the atomic&#8208;level SN2 dynamics at phosphorous (P) centers has never been studied. We investigate the dynamics of the F&#8722;+PH2Cl reaction with the quasi&#8208;classical trajectory method on a novel full&#8208;dimensional analytical potential energy surface fitted on high&#8208;level ab initio data. Our computations reveal intermediate dynamics compared to the F&#8722;+CH3Cl and the F&#8722;+NH2Cl SN2 reactions: phosphorus as central atom leads to a more indirect SN2 reaction with extensive complex&#8208;formation with respect to the carbon&#8208;centered one, however, the title reaction is more direct than its N&#8208;centered pair. Stereospecificity, characteristic at C&#8208;center, does not appear here either, due to the submerged front&#8208;side&#8208;attack retention path and the repeated entrance&#8208;channel inversional motion, whereas the multi&#8208;inversion mechanism discovered at nitrogen center is also undermined by the deep Walden&#8208;well. At low collision energies, 6&#8201;% of the PH2F products form with retained configuration, mostly through complex&#8208;mediated mechanisms, while this ratio reaches 24&#8201;% at the highest energy due to the increasing dominance of the direct front&#8208;side mechanism and the smaller chance for hitting the deep Walden&#8208;inversion minimum. Our results suggest pronounced central&#8208;atom effects in SN2 reactions, which can fundamentally change their (stereo)dynamics.

     alt="Alternating Stereospecificity upon Central-Atom Change: Dynamics of the F&#8722;+PH2Cl SN2 Reaction Compared to its C- and N-Centered Analogues"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Dynamical central-atom effects&lt;/b&gt; in S&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;2 reactions are investigated, with special regard to stereochemistry, by preforming quasi-classical trajectory simulations on a novel full-dimensional ab initio potential energy surface for the F&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;+PH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cl reaction, as well as by comparing its dynamics and mechanisms to the N- and C-centered analogues.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Central-atom effects on bimolecular nucleophilic substitution (S&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;2) reactions are well-known in chemistry, however, the atomic-level S&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;2 dynamics at phosphorous (P) centers has never been studied. We investigate the dynamics of the F&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;+PH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cl reaction with the quasi-classical trajectory method on a novel full-dimensional analytical potential energy surface fitted on high-level ab initio data. Our computations reveal intermediate dynamics compared to the F&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;+CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Cl and the F&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;+NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cl S&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;2 reactions: phosphorus as central atom leads to a more indirect S&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;2 reaction with extensive complex-formation with respect to the carbon-centered one, however, the title reaction is more direct than its N-centered pair. Stereospecificity, characteristic at C-center, does not appear here either, due to the submerged front-side-attack retention path and the repeated entrance-channel inversional motion, whereas the multi-inversion mechanism discovered at nitrogen center is also undermined by the deep Walden-well. At low collision energies, 6&#8201;% of the PH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;F products form with retained configuration, mostly through complex-mediated mechanisms, while this ratio reaches 24&#8201;% at the highest energy due to the increasing dominance of the direct front-side mechanism and the smaller chance for hitting the deep Walden-inversion minimum. Our results suggest pronounced central-atom effects in S&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;2 reactions, which can fundamentally change their (stereo)dynamics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>The s&#8208;p Nonhybrid Nature Causes Adaptive Superatomic States of Bismuth Clusters</title>

Superatoms: The Bin+ clusters are found to be inert with common gases but react with NO, enabling us to screen out Bi7+ and Bi15+ for which we have fully unveiled their relative stability within unique bonding and s&#8208;p nonhybrid nature, indicating potentials of using such building blocks for functional materials.







Abstract
We report a joint experimental and theoretical study on the stability and reactivity of Bin+ (n=5&#8211;33) clusters. The alternating odd&#8208;even effect on the reaction rates of Bin+ clusters with NO is observed, and Bi7+ finds the most inertness. First&#8208;principles calculation results reveal that the lowest energy structures of Bi6&#8208;9+ exhibit quasi&#8208;spherical geometry pertaining to the jellium shell model; however, the Bin+ (n&#8805;10) clusters adopt assembly structures. The prominent stability of Bi7+ is associated with its highly symmetric structure and superatomic states with a magic number of 34e closed shell. For the first time, we demonstrate that the unique s&#8208;p nonhybrid feature in bismuth rationalizes the stability of Bi6&#8208;9+ clusters within the jellium model, by filling the 6s electrons into the superatomic orbitals (forming &#8220;s&#8208;band&#8221;). Interestingly, the stability of 18e &#8220;s&#8208;band&#8221; coincides with the compact structure for Bin+ at n&#8804;9 but assembly structures for n&#8805;10, showing an accommodation of the s electrons to the geometric structure. The atomic p&#8208;orbitals also allow to form superatomic orbitals at higher energy levels, contributing to the preferable structures of tridentate binding units. We illustrate the s&#8208;p nonhybrid nature accommodates the structure and superatomic states of bismuth clusters.

         <title>Caged Luciferase Inhibitor&#8208;Based Bioluminescence Switching Strategy Enables Efficient Detection of Serum APN Activity and the Identification of Its Roles in Metastasis of Non&#8208;Small Cell Lung Cancer
</title>

A caged luciferase inhibitor&#8208;based bioluminescence&#8208;switching strategy (CLIBS) is developed and used to determine circulating Aminopeptidase N (APN) activity in the complicated bio&#8208;samples with robust efficacy. By applying the CLIBS to serum samples in non&#8211;small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients, it is revealed that circulating APN activity serves as an independent factor for forecasting NSCLC patients&#8217; risk of metastasis.







Abstract
Bioluminogenic probes emerged as powerful tools for imaging and analysis of various bioanalyses, but traditional approaches would be limited to the low sensitivity during determine the low activity of protease in clinical specimens. Herein, we proposed a caged luciferase inhibitor&#8208;based bioluminescence&#8208;switching strategy (CLIBS) by using a cleavable luciferase inhibitor to modulate the activity of luciferase reporter to amplify the detective signals, which led to the enhancement of detection sensitivity, and enabled the determination of circulating Aminopeptidase N (APN) activity in thousands of times diluted serum. By applying the CLIBS to serum samples in non&#8211;small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients from two clinical cohorts, we revealed that, for the first time, higher circulating APN activities but not its concentration, were associated with more NSCLC metastasis or higher metastasis stages by subsequent clinical analysis, and can serve as an independent factor for forecasting NSCLC patients&#8217; risk of metastasis.

The investigated indolin&#8208;3&#8208;one derivative exhibits fast photoisomerization in apolar solvents. In melanoma cells, the compound showed lipid droplet accumulation along with photoactivated toxicity.







Abstract
The study of a fluorescent indolin&#8208;3&#8208;one derivative is reported that, as opposed to its previously described congeners, selectively undergoes photoactivated ring&#8208;opening in apolar solvents. The excited state involved in this photoisomerization was partially deactivated by the formation of singlet oxygen. Cell studies revealed lipid droplet accumulation and efficient light&#8208;induced cytotoxicity.

         <title>Towards Fast Circularly Polarized Luminescence in 2&#8208;Coordinate Chiral Mechanochromic Copper(I) Carbene Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 51, September 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of chiral and mechanochromic copper(I) TADF emitters with high radiative rate constants have been examined with regard to their chiroptical properties. Only the structurally flexible phenoxazine ligand generates circular polarized luminescence (CPL) in PMMA matrix presumably due to distortions in the ground and excited states, providing a design strategy for future CPL molecules.







Abstract
A series of chiral mechanochromic copper(I) cAAC (cAAC=cyclic (alkyl)(amino)carbene) complexes with a variety of amide ligands have been studied with regard to their photophysical and chiroptical properties to elucidate structure&#8208;property relationships for the design of efficient triplet exciton emitters exhibiting circularly polarized luminescence. Depending on the environment, which determines the excited state energies, either thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) from 1/3LLCT states or phosphorescence from 3LLCT/LC states occurs. However, neither chiral moieties at the carbene nor at the carbazolate ligands provide detectable luminescence dissymmetries glum. An exception is [Cu(phenoxazinyl)(cAAC)], showing orange to deep red TADF with &#955;max=601&#8211;715&#8197;nm in solution, powders and in PMMA. In this case, the amide ligand can undergo distortions in the excited state. This design motif leads to the first linear, non&#8208;aggregated CPL&#8208;active copper(I) complex with glum of &#8722;3.4&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;10&#8722;3 combined with a high radiative rate constant of 6.7&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;105&#8197;s&#8722;1.

         <title>Selective Chirality Transfer to the Bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide Anion of an Ionic Liquid</title>

Selective chirality transfer from the chiral (R)&#8208;1,2&#8208;propylene oxide to the bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide anion of an ionic liquid is observed, resulting in optical activity of the achiral anion as detected by calculated vibrational circular dichroism spectra.







Abstract
Chirality transfer from the chiral molecule (R)&#8208;1,2&#8208;propylene oxide to the achiral anion of the 1&#8208;ethyl&#8208;3&#8208;methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide ionic liquid is observed. The chiral probe selectively affects one part of the binary ionic liquid, i.&#8201;e., it has previously been shown experimentally and theoretically that this particular imidazolium cation can be affected by chirality transfer, but in the present system chirality is almost exclusively transferred to the anion and not to both parts of the solvent (anion and cation). This observation is of high relevance because of its selectivity and because anion effects are usually much more important in ionic liquid research than cation effects. From ab&#8197;initio molecular dynamics simulations, a conformational analysis and dissected vibrational circular dichroism spectra are obtained to study the chirality transfer. While in the neat ionic liquid two mirror imaged trans conformers of the anion occur almost equally, we observe an excess of one of these conformers in the presence of the chiral solute, causing optical activity of the anion. Although the cis conformers are not tremendously affected by the chirality transfer, they gain in total population when (R)&#8208;1,2&#8208;propylene oxide is dissolved in the ionic liquid.

         <title>Catalysis by KDM6 Histone Demethylases &#8211; A Synergy between the Non&#8208;Heme Iron(II) Center, Second Coordination Sphere, and Long&#8208;Range Interactions</title>

The study of the effects of SCS and LR residues at each intermediate level of the demethylation mechanism in the catalysis of KDM6 enzymes using QM/MM and MD simulations.







Abstract
KDM6A (UTX) and KDM6B (JMJD3) are human non&#8208;heme Fe(II) and 2&#8208;oxoglutarate (2OG) dependent JmjC oxygenases that catalyze the demethylation of trimethylated lysine 27 in the N&#8208;terminal tail of histone&#8197;H3, a post&#8208;translational modification that regulates transcription. A Combined Quantum Mechanics/ Molecular Mechanics (QM/MM) and Molecular Dynamics (MD) study on the catalytic mechanism of KDM6A/B reveals that the transition state for the rate&#8208;limiting hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) reaction in KDM6A catalysis is stabilized by polar (Asn217) and aromatic (Trp369)/non&#8208;polar (Pro274) residues in contrast to KDM4, KDM6B and KDM7 demethylases where charged residues (Glu, Arg, Asp) are involved. KDM6A employs both &#963;&#8208; and &#960;&#8208;electron transfer pathways for HAT, whereas KDM6B employs the &#963;&#8208;electron pathway. Differences in hydrogen bonding of the Fe&#8208;chelating Glu252(KDM6B) contribute to the lower energy barriers in KDM6B vs. KDM6A. The study reveals a dependence of the activation barrier of the rebound hydroxylation on the Fe&#8722;O&#8722;C angle in the transition state of KDM6A. Anti&#8208;correlation of the Zn&#8208;binding domain with the active site residues is a key factor distinguishing KDM6A/B from KDM7/4s. The results reveal the importance of communication between the Fe center, second coordination sphere, and long&#8208;range interactions in catalysis by KDMs and, by implication, other 2OG oxygenases.

         <title>Degradation of Penicillinic Antibiotics and &#946;&#8208;Lactamase Enzymatic Catalysis in a Biomimetic Zn&#8208;Based Metal&#8211;Organic Framework</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 51, September 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel Zn&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF), capable to catalyze the selective hydrolysis of the &#946;&#8208;Lactam antibiotics amoxicillin and ceftriaxone is reported. Remarkably, the MOF degrades, very efficiently, the four&#8208;membered &#946;&#8208;lactam ring of amoxicillin, acting as a &#946;&#8208;lactamase mimic and expands the very limited number of MOFs capable to mimic catalytic enzymatic processes. The whole process is unveiled by SCXRD and DFT calculations.







Abstract
&#946;&#8208;Lactam antibiotics are one of the most commonly prescribed drugs to treat bacterial infections. However, their use has been somehow limited given the emergence of bacteria with resistance mechanisms, such as &#946;&#8208;lactamases, which inactivate them by degrading their four&#8208;membered &#946;&#8208;lactam rings. So, a total knowledge of the mechanisms governing the catalytic activity of &#946;&#8208;lactamases is required. Here, we report a novel Zn&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF, 1), possessing functional channels capable to accommodate and interact with antibiotics, which catalyze the selective hydrolysis of the penicillinic antibiotics amoxicillin and ceftriaxone. In particular, MOF 1 degrades, very efficiently, the four&#8208;membered &#946;&#8208;lactam ring of amoxicillin, acting as a &#946;&#8208;lactamase mimic, and expands the very limited number of MOFs capable to mimic catalytic enzymatic processes. Combined single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (SCXRD) studies and density functional (DFT) calculations offer unique snapshots on the host&#8208;guest interactions established between amoxicillin and the functional channels of 1. This allows to propose a degradation mechanism based on the activation of a water molecule, promoted by a Zn&#8208;bridging hydroxyl group, concertedly to the nucleophilic attack to the carbonyl moiety and the cleaving of C&#8722;N bond of the lactam ring.

         <title>Covalently Modified Kevlar Fabric Incorporating Graphene Oxide with Enhanced Antibacterial Properties and Preserved Strength</title>

Straightforward covalent post&#8208;functionalization of Kevlar fabric incorporating GO nanosheets significantly enhances the antibacterial properties and preserves their strength.







Abstract
This work describes a multi&#8208;step modification process for the covalent transformation of Kevlar fabric en route to the incorporation of graphene oxide (GO) nanosheets. Spectroscopic, thermal and microscopy imaging techniques have been employed to follow step&#8208;by&#8208;step the modification of Kevlar and the formation of the corresponding Kevlar&#8208;GO hybrid fabric. The level of Kevlar's functionalization can be controlled with the nitration time, the first reaction in the multi&#8208;sequence organic transformations, for obtaining the hybrid fabric with a content of GO up to 30&#8201;%. Most importantly, the covalent post&#8208;modification of Kevlar does not occur in the expense of the other excellent mechanical properties of the fabric. Under optimal conditions, the Kevlar&#8208;GO hybrid fabric shows a 20&#8201;% enhancement of the ultimate strength. Notably, when the Kevlar&#8208;GO hybrid fabric was exposed to cyanobacterial Synechococcus the bacteria growth was fully inhibited. Overall, the covalently modified fabric demonstrated significant antibacterial behavior, excellent strength and stability under common processes. Due to its simplicity, the methodology presented in this work not only promises to result in a standard procedure to functionalize the mer units of Kevlar with a variety of chemicals and nanomaterials but it can be also extended for the modification and hybridization of other fabrics.

         <title>NAD(P)H:Quinone Acceptor Oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1) Activatable Salicylamide H+/Cl&#8722; Transporters</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 51, September 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, we report two enzyme activatable ion transport systems that, on selective activation by NQO1&#8208; an enzyme abundant in cancer cells, are capable of transporting H+/Cl&#8722; across the lipid bilayer. This transport disrupts the ion homeostasis specifically in the cancer cells and triggers apoptosis via mitochondrial membrane depolarization, lysosomal deacidification, and oxidative stress induction.







Abstract
NAD(P)H:quinone acceptor oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1), a detoxifying enzyme overexpressed in tumors, plays a key role in protecting cancer cells against oxidative stress and thus has been considered an attractive candidate for activating prodrug(s). Herein, we report the first use of NQO1 for the selective activation of &#8216;protransporter&#8217; systems in cancer cells leading to the induction of apoptosis. Salicylamides, easily synthesizable small molecules, have been effectively used for efficient H+/Cl&#8722; symport across lipid membranes. The ion transport activity of salicylamides was efficiently abated by caging the OH group with NQO1 activatable quinones via either ether or ester linkage. The release of active transporters, following the reduction of quinone caged &#8216;protransporters&#8217; by NQO1, was verified. Both the transporters and protransporters exhibited significant toxicity towards the MCF&#8208;7 breast cancer line, mediated via the induction of oxidative stress, mitochondrial membrane depolarization, and lysosomal deacidification. Induction of cell death via intrinsic apoptotic pathway was verified by monitoring PARP1 cleavage.

         <title>Preparation of Buffered Nano&#8208;Submicron Hierarchical Structure Hollow SiOx@C Anodes for Lithium&#8208;Ion Battery Materials with Carboxymethyl Chitosan</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 51, September 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Silicon&#8208;based material SiOx@C with nano&#8208;submicron hierarchical structure from nano silicon and hollow silicon dioxide is fabricated to buffer the volume change of silicon&#8208;based anodes, improve the electronic conductivity and achieve more stable cycling performance.







Abstract
Silicon&#8208;based materials are among the most promising anode materials for next&#8208;generation lithium&#8208;ion batteries. However, the volume expansion and poor conductivity of silicon&#8208;based materials during the charge and discharge process seriously hinder their practical application in the field of anodes. Here, we choose carboxymethyl chitosan (CMCS) as the carbon source coating and binding on the surface of nano silicon and hollow silicon dioxide (H&#8722;SiO2) to form a hierarchical buffered structure of nano&#8208;hollow SiOx@C. The hollow H&#8722;SiO2 can alleviate the volume expansion of nano silicon during the lithiation process under continuous cycling. Meanwhile, the carbon layer carbonized by CMCS containing N&#8208;doping further regulates the silicon's expansion and improves the conductivity of the active materials. The as&#8208;
prepared SiOx@C material exhibits an initial discharge capacity of 985.4&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 with the decay rate of 0.27&#8201;% per cycle in 150 cycles under the current density of 0.2&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1. It is proved that the hierarchical buffer structure nano&#8208;hollow SiOx@C anode material has practical application potential.

         <title>Double Dynamic Structural Change Enabling Tricolor Chromism by the Realization of Apparent Two&#8208;Electron Transfer to Skip the Open&#8208;Shell State</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 51, September 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tricolor electrochromic systems were constructed by realizing a double dynamic structural change that facilitates an apparent 2e&#8208;transfer in both oxidation and reduction processes. Therefore, redox interconversion cleanly proceeds among neutral (zigzag), dicationic (L&#8208;shape), and tetracationic (planar) states, accompanied by a drastic change in color and near infrared (NIR)&#8208;absorption.







Abstract
Most redox systems generally cannot avoid the involvement of open&#8208;shell species upon generating multiply charged species, which often reduces reversibility in multi&#8208;color electrochromic systems. In this study, we newly synthesized octakis(aminophenyl)&#8208;substituted pentacenebisquinodimethane (BQD) derivatives and their hybrids with alkoxyphenyl analogues. Thanks to apparent two&#8208;electron transfer accompanied by double dramatic changes in the structure of the arylated quinodimethane skeleton, the dicationic and tetracationic states were generated and isolated quantitatively because of the negligible steady&#8208;state concentration of intermediary open&#8208;shell species such as monocation or trication radicals. When two electrophores with different donating abilities are attached to the BQD skeleton, a dicationic state with a different color can be isolated in addition to the neutral and tetracationic states. For these tetracations, an interchromophore interaction induces a red&#8208;shift of the NIR absorptions, thus realizing tricolor UV/Vis/NIR electrochromic behavior involving only closed&#8208;shell states.

         <title>Stereoselective Intramolecular [2+2] Trapping of 1,2&#8208;Cyclohexadienes: a Route to Rigid, Angularly Fused Tricyclic Scaffolds</title>

         <dc:description>
Is ring strain the new h&#957;? Tricyclic cis&#8208;fused alkylidene cyclobutanes are obtained cleanly from the intramolecular [2+2] trapping of 1,2&#8208;cyclohexadienes with styrenes and electron&#8208;deficient olefins. Reactions proceed with complete diastereoselectivity and regioselectivity. This reaction &#8211; which occurs at ambient conditions &#8211; provides a mild alternative to classical [2+2] reactions which employ UV light activation or transition metal catalysis.







Abstract
1,2&#8208;Cyclohexadienes generated under mild fluoride&#8208;mediated desilylative conditions undergo efficient intramolecular [2+2] trapping, providing tricyclic alkylidene cyclobutanes with complete diastereoselectivity for the cis&#8208;fused products. Pendent styrenes or electron&#8208;deficient olefins can trap simple 1,2&#8208;cyclohexadienes or their oxygenated counterparts, with 14 substrates being disclosed. Reactions proceed at ambient temperature using just cesium fluoride in up to 91&#8201;% yield, and the necessary precursors are easily accessed from substituted 2&#8208;bromocyclohexenones.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Is ring strain the new h&#957;&lt;/b&gt;? Tricyclic &lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt;-fused alkylidene cyclobutanes are obtained cleanly from the intramolecular [2+2] trapping of 1,2-cyclohexadienes with styrenes and electron-deficient olefins. Reactions proceed with complete diastereoselectivity and regioselectivity. This reaction &#8211; which occurs at ambient conditions &#8211; provides a mild alternative to classical [2+2] reactions which employ UV light activation or transition metal catalysis.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1,2-Cyclohexadienes generated under mild fluoride-mediated desilylative conditions undergo efficient intramolecular [2+2] trapping, providing tricyclic alkylidene cyclobutanes with complete diastereoselectivity for the &lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt;-fused products. Pendent styrenes or electron-deficient olefins can trap simple 1,2-cyclohexadienes or their oxygenated counterparts, with 14 substrates being disclosed. Reactions proceed at ambient temperature using just cesium fluoride in up to 91&#8201;% yield, and the necessary precursors are easily accessed from substituted 2-bromocyclohexenones. Multiple synthetic routes have been developed to install the appropriate functional groups required for [2+2] trapping.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Reactivity of [AuF3(SIMes)]: Pathway to Unprecedented Structural Motifs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 51, September 12, 2023. </description>

Offering a hand in gold fluorine chemistry: The trans&#8208;F in [AuF3(SIMes)] can be substituted by several ligands with varying electronic properties, yielding complexes of the type trans&#8208;[AuF2X(SIMes)]. They are introduced either by using trimethylsilyl compounds or, by using electron&#8208;deficient carbonyl&#8208;bearing molecules, the latter route being new in gold chemistry.







Abstract
We report on a comprehensive reactivity study starting from [AuF3(SIMes)] to synthesize different motifs of monomeric gold(III) fluorides. A plethora of different ligands has been introduced in a mono&#8208;substitution yielding trans&#8208;[AuF2X(SIMes)] including alkynido, cyanido, azido, and a set of perfluoroalkoxido complexes. The latter were better accomplished via use of perfluorinated carbonyl&#8208;bearing molecules, which is unprecedented in gold chemistry. In case of the cyanide and azide, triple substitution gave rise to the corresponding [AuX3(SIMes)] complexes. Comparison of the chemical shift of the carbene carbon atom in the 13C{1H}&#8197;NMR spectrum, the calculated SIMes affinity and the Au&#8722;C bond length in the solid state with related literature&#8208;known complexes yields a classification of trans&#8208;influences for a variety of ligands attached to the gold center. Therein, the mixed fluorido perfluoroalkoxido complexes have a similar SIMes affinity to AuF3 with a very low Gibbs energy of formation when using the perfluoro carbonyl route.

         <title>Stepwise Functionalization of Single&#8208;Walled Carbon Nanotubes with Subsequent Molecular Conversion to Control Photoluminescence Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 51, September 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A stepwise approach combining the functionalization of single&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) and subsequent reactions to introduce functional groups into the addenda on the SWCNTs achieved control over the photoluminescence properties and the addition of functionality in the addenda.







Abstract
Functionalization of single&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) has attracted interest because it alters the near&#8208;infrared (NIR) photoluminescence (PL) wavelength and emission efficiency. These modifications depend on the binding configuration and degree of functionalization. Excessive functionalization reduces the emission efficiency as the integrity of the conjugated &#960; system decreases; thus, controlling the degree of functionalization is essential. Because the binding configurations and degree of functionalization are affected by the reagent structure, a stepwise approach combining SWCNTs functionalization and subsequent reactions to introduce functional groups into the addenda could effectively control their PL properties and functionalities. We studied this approach by implementing the reductive alkylation of SWCNTs by using bromoalkanes with t&#8208;butyl carbamate (Boc)&#8208;protected amino groups and subsequent deprotection and amidation reactions. The reaction products were analyzed based on absorption, PL, and Raman spectroscopy and the Kaiser test. Depending on the structure of the reagent, deprotection and amidation reactions competed with the elimination reaction of addenda, altering the PL properties of the SWCNTs. Furthermore, the elimination reaction was inhibited in the adducts functionalized using dibromoalkane with Boc&#8208;protected amino groups, demonstrating that the use of appropriate reagents enables the molecular conversion of the functional groups of SWCNT adducts without affecting their PL properties.

         <title>Structural Expansion of Cyclohepta[def]fluorene towards Azulene&#8208;Embedded Non&#8208;Benzenoid Nanographenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 51, September 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of unprecedented non&#8208;benzenoid NGs containing cyclohepta[def]fluorine unit are obtained via on&#8208;surface synthesis on Au(111). Scanning tunneling microscopy and non&#8208;contact atomic force microscopy evidence their structures and conformations. Moreover, the dynamics of the precursor and its reaction products on the surface are analyzed by DFT and MD simulations.







Abstract
Non&#8208;benzenoid non&#8208;alternant nanographenes (NGs) have attracted increasing attention on account of their distinct electronic and structural features in comparison to their isomeric benzenoid counterparts. In this work, we present a series of unprecedented azulene&#8208;embedded NGs on Au(111) during the attempted synthesis of cyclohepta[def]fluorene&#8208;based high&#8208;spin non&#8208;Kekul&#233; structure. Comprehensive scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and non&#8208;contact atomic force microscopy (nc&#8208;AFM) evidence the structures and conformations of these unexpected products. The dynamics of the precursor bearing 9&#8208;(2,6&#8208;dimethylphenyl)anthracene and dihydro&#8208;dibenzo&#8208;cyclohepta[def]fluorene units and its reaction products on the surface are analyzed by density functional theory (DFT) and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Our study sheds light on the fundamental understanding of precursor design for the fabrication of &#960;&#8208;extended non&#8208;benzenoid NGs on a metal surface.

Synthesis, electronic properties, and reactivity of borylated subphthalocyanines (SubPcs) are reported. These compounds display a great stability and serve as powerful starting materials for the post&#8208;functionalization of SubPcs via cross&#8208;coupling reactions.







Abstract
The peripheral borylation of porphyrinoids has become a key step to prepare advanced functional materials. This study reports the synthesis, electronic properties, and reactivity of borylated subphthalocyanines. These compounds, which are prepared by Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura borylation in excellent yields, are easily purified, display a great stability, and serve as powerful starting materials for the post&#8208;functionalization of SubPcs via cross&#8208;coupling reactions. Remarkably, this novel approach is more efficient than the methodologies already described and enables the preparation of exotic systems, such as SubPc dimeric species linked by C&#8722;C bonds, which are not accessible so far and present promising properties for optoelectronic devices.

         <title>Reactions of Tetra(o&#8208;tolyl)diborane(4) with Organic Azides: Formation of Fluorescent Boron&#8208;Fused Hexazenes</title>

A novel B2N6 heterocycle could be obtained by the reaction of tetra(o&#8208;tolyl)diborane(4) with primary alkyl azides. Experimental and theoretical studies revealed the stepwise mechanism, in which two azide molecules sequentially reacted. This B2N6 heterocycle exhibited a strong fluorescence with a high fluorescent quantum yield. In the case of using aryl, 3&#176;&#8208;alkyl, and 2&#176;&#8208;alkyl azides, different products were obtained depending on the substituents.







Abstract
The reaction of tetra(o&#8208;tolyl)diborane(4) with organic azides afforded three different compounds, diborylamines, diboryltriazenes, and B2&#8208;hexazenes having a bicyclic B2N6 ring system. The reaction with aryl azides gave diborylamines, while the reaction with 1&#8197;equiv. of alkyl azides furnished diboryltriazenes. In the case of the reaction with an excess amount of primary alkyl azide, a new heterocyclic B2&#8208;hexazenes were obtained. The formation of the B2N6 structure could be explained by one general reaction mechanism via the diboryltriazene intermediate according to the control experiments and DFT calculations. The B2&#8208;hexazenes exhibited a strong fluorescence with a remarkably high fluorescent quantum yield of up to 96&#8201;%.

A novel ZnII biological metal&#8211;organic framework mimics &#946;&#8208;lactamase enzymes. The crystal structure of a novel Zn&#8208;based biological MOF occupies the central position to reflect the crucial role that its porous functional channels play in the capture, immobilization and degradation of amoxicillin. The crystal structures of amoxicillin and the degraded derivative surround the MOF, indicating the differences in the antibiotic before and after entering the bioMOF. More information can be found in the Research Article by J. Ferrando&#8208;Soria, D. Armentano, A. Leyva&#8208;P&#233;rez, E. Pardo and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202301325).

The cover picture illustrates a molecule as a racing car driving on a circuit. The frame of the racing car shows the central skeleton of the molecule of different shape, which can be converted as it passes through a gate (electrode), accompanied by a drastic change in color. This cover implies that the redox reaction occurs in a stepwise manner, and they show tricolor chromic response. Moreover, the circuit represents its high reversibility. More information can be found in the Research Article by Y.&#8197;Ishigaki and co&#8208;workers. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202301476).

The demethylation of histone H3 lysine 27 is catalyzed by the FeII/2&#8208;oxoglutarate&#8208;dependent histone demethylase from Class 6 (KDM6). The KDM6 family (KDM6A/KDM6B) catalyzes the demethylation of trimethylated H3K27, which involves iron&#8208;oxo intermediates, including superoxo (FeIII&#8722;OO&#8901;&#8722;), Ferryl (FeIV=O), and hydroxo (FeIII&#8722;OH) complexes. The study determines the role of the second coordination sphere and long&#8208;range interacting residues in KDM6&#8242;s catalysis. More information can be found in the Research Article by C.&#8197;Z.&#8197;Christov and co&#8208;workers. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202301305).

         <dc:description>
Unexcited light imaging has gained much attention in recent years because of its high sensitivity and high signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio. This article provides an overview of the application of chemiluminescence, bioluminescence and afterglow luminescence in biomedical imaging. The imaging mechanisms and luminescence enhancement strategies are also briefly described.







Abstract
Optical imaging has a wide range of applications in the biomedical field, allowing the visualization of physiological processes and helping in the diagnosis and treatment of diseases. Unexcited light source imaging technologies, such as chemiluminescence imaging, bioluminescence imaging and afterglow imaging have attracted great attention in recent years because of the absence of excitation light interference in their application and the advantages of high sensitivity and high signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio. In this review, the latest advances in unexcited light source imaging technology for biomedical applications are highlighted. The design strategies of unexcited light source luminescent probes in improving luminescence brightness, penetration depth, quantum yield and targeting, and their applications in inflammation imaging, tumor imaging, liver and kidney injury imaging and bacterial infection imaging are introduced in detail. The research progress and future prospects of unexcited light source imaging for medical applications are further discussed.

         <title>Recent Advances in Aerobic Oxidative of C&#8722;H Bond by Molecular Oxygen Focus on Heterocycles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 51, September 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A concise summary of recent advances on green oxidative coupling reactions of C&#8722;H bond focus on heterocyclic compounds for construction of C&#8722;C and C&#8722;X (X=N, O, S, or P) bonds using O2 as internal oxidant since 2010 was given. The transformations described here aim to provide a platform for expanding the scope and utility of O2 as green oxidation, together with a brief discussion on research into the mechanisms behind it, hoping to reveal some common reaction patterns and development trends, as well as potential applications and challenges in the near future.







Abstract
Aerobic oxidative cross&#8208;coupling represents one of the most straightforward and atom&#8208;economic methods for construction of C&#8722;C and C&#8722;X (X=N, O, S, or P) bonds using air as a sustainable external oxidant. The oxidative coupling of C&#8722;H bonds in heterocyclic compounds can effectively increase their molecular complexity by introducing new functional groups through C&#8722;H bond activation, or by formation of new heterocyclic structures through cascade construction of two or more sequential chemical bonds. This is very useful as it can increase the potential applications of these structures in natural products, pharmaceuticals, agricultural chemicals, and functional materials. This is a representative overview of recent progress since 2010 on green oxidative coupling reactions of C&#8722;H bond using O2 or air as internal oxidant focus on Heterocycles. It aims to provide a platform for expanding the scope and utility of air as green oxidant, together with a brief discussion on research into the mechanisms behind it.

         <title>Tracking SF5I in the Iodopentafluorosulfanylation of Alkynes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In the vibrant field of SF5 chemistry, SF5X reagents (X = F, Cl, Br) are at the heart of current investigations in radical pentafluorosulfanylation reactions. Alas! SF5I is the missing link whose existence has not been reported albeit its potential as SF5 donor. We herein report the formal addition of the hitherto unknown SF5I reagent to alkynes by means of a combination of SF5Cl / KI / 18&#8208;crown&#8208;6 ether. The exclusive regio&#8208; and stereoselective synthesis of unprecedented (E)&#8208;1&#8208;iodo&#8208;2&#8208;(pentafluoro&#8208;l6&#8208;sulfanyl) alkenes was achieved. A consensus was reached through computational and mechanistic studies for the realistic formation of SF5&#8211; anion but not SF5I in solution and the rational involvement of SF5&#183; and iodine radicals in the iodo pentafluorosulfanylation reaction.</dc:description>

         <title>A Living Topochemical Ring&#8208;Opening Polymerization of Achiral Amino Acid N&#8208;Carboxy&#8208;Anhydrides in Single Crystals</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report a living topochemical ring&#8208;opening polymerization (ROP) of achiral amino&#8208;acid N&#8208;carboxyanhydrides (NCAs). Single crystals of the NCAs of &#945;&#8208;aminoisobutyric acid (Aib) and 1&#8208;aminocyclohexanecarboxylic acid (ACHC) were grown, allowing a ring&#8208;opening polymerization macroscopically induced by amines. Single crystals could be polymerized at temperatures from 25 &#8211; 50 &#176;C after physically contacting the amine&#8208;based initiator with the crystals. Topochemical polymerization of the crystals was proven by MALDI&#8208;ToF MS and XRD, generating polymers with chain lengths of up to 40 units and a complete affixation of the initiating amine at the polymer&#8217;s head. Due to the proper alignment of the reacting groups in the crystal, longer polymer chains with improved purities can be reached, as also chain&#8208;transfer is reduced as compared to solution polymerization. Simple purification of the polymers can be achieved by separation of the unreacted NCA via dispersion in acetonitrile. Overall, this method enables the preparation of polymers with higher chain length and purities at mild conditions, finally demonstrating a crystal&#8208;based ring opening polymerization.</dc:description>

         <title>Novel Aspects about &#8220;Lifetime&#8221; in Upconversion Luminescence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Recent progress on the temporal response (TR) of lanthanide upconversion luminescence (UCL) has enriched the means of UCL regulation, promoted advanced designs for customized applications such as biological diagnosis, high&#8208;capacity optical coding, and dynamic optical anti&#8208;counterfeiting, and pushed us to reacquaint the dynamic responses of sensitizer/activator ions in UCL system. In particular, the lifetime of UCL should be revisited after discovery of novel experimental phenomena and luminescence mechanisms, i.e., it should be understood as the collective TR (in the decay edge) of all the involved ions rather than the reciprocal of the radiative rate of an individual ion. In this Concept, we retraced the latest understanding of the dynamics in UCL with special attention to the relationship between excitation and emission, means of TR regulation, and discussed existing challenges. It is expected to provide some fundamental insights to deepened understanding, further regulation, and frontier applications of TR features of UCL.</dc:description>

         <title>Bis(N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene) Manganese(I) Complexes in Catalytic N&#8208;Formylation/N&#8208;Methylation of Amines Using Carbon Dioxide and Hydrosilanes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A series of seven Mn(I) complexes with general formula [MnBr(bisNHC)(CO)3], having a bidentate bis(N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene) ligand (bisNHC), has been developed by varying the bridging group between the NHC donors, the nitrogen wingtip substituents and the heterocyclic ring. The synthesis of the complexes has been accomplished by in situ transmetalation of the bisNHC from the corresponding silver(I) complexes. Removal of the bromide anion affords the corresponding solvento complexes [Mn(bisNHC)(CO)3(CH3CN)](BF4). The influence of the bisNHC structure on its electron donor ability has been evaluated by FTIR and 13C NMR spectroscopy, both in the neutral and cationic complexes. Finally, the isolated Mn(I)&#8208;bisNHC complexes have been employed as homogeneous catalysts in the reductive N&#8208;formylation and N&#8208;methylation of amines with CO2 as C1 source and phenylsilane as reducing agent, showing a high selectivity for the N&#8208;methylated product. Preliminary mechanistic investigations suggest that, in the adopted reaction conditions, the formylated product can be formed via different reaction pathways, either metal&#8208;catalyzed or not, while the methylation reaction requires the use of the Mn(I) catalyst.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>We report a silver&#8208;catalyzed regioselective defluorinative 1,3&#8208;dienylation of trifluoromethyl phenyl N&#8208;triftosylhydrazones using homoallenols as 1,3&#8208;dienyl sources. This protocol provides a variety of &#945;&#8208;(di)fluoro&#8208;&#946;&#8208;vinyl allyl ketones with excellent functional group tolerance in moderate to good yields. The reaction proceeds through a silver carbene&#8208;initiated sequential etherification and Claisen type [3,3]&#8208;sigmatropic rearrangement cascade.

         <title>Planar Hexacoordinate Beryllium: Covalent Bonding Between s&#8208;block Metals</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Achieving a planar hypercoordinate arrangement of s&#8208;block metals through covalent bonding with ligands is challenging due to the strong ionicity involved. Herein, we report the first case of a neutral binary global minimum containing a planar hexacoordinate beryllium (phBe) atom. The central Be atom is coordinated by six active Be atoms, latter in turn are enclosed by an equal number of more electronegative chlorine atoms in the periphery, forming a star&#8208;like phBe cluster (Be&#169;Be6Cl6). Importantly, the cluster exhibits dynamically stabilized stemming geometrically from the appropriate matching of metal&#8208;ligand size and electronically from adherence to the octet rule as well as possessing the 6&#963;/2&#960; double aromaticity. Remarkably, energy decomposition analysis&#8211;natural orbitals for chemical valence (EDA&#8208;NOCV) analysis reveals a significant covalent interaction between the ligand and the central metal beryllium atoms, a fact further supported by a large Wiberg bond index. This cluster is a promising synthetic as its excellent electronic, dynamic and thermodynamic stability.</dc:description>

         <title>Geometry&#8208;Independent Ultrafast Energy Transfer in Bioinspired Arrays Containing Electronically Coupled BODIPY Dimers as Energy Donors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bioinspired energy&#8208;transfer arrays composed of electronically coupled BODIPY dyads as energy donors and chlorins as energy acceptors feature ultrafast (~10&#8197;ps) energy transfer, which is consistent with the F&#246;rster mechanism. The energy&#8208;transfer rate in the arrays is nearly independent of the position at which energy donor is attached to the chlorin or of the nature of the intervening linker.







Abstract
In photosynthetic light&#8208;harvesting complexes, strong interaction between chromophores enables efficient absorption of solar radiation and has been suggested to enable ultrafast energy funneling to the reaction center. To examine whether similar effects can be realized in synthetic systems, and to determine the mechanisms of energy transfer, we synthesized and characterized a series of bioinspired arrays containing strongly&#8208;coupled BODIPY dimers as energy donors and chlorin derivatives as energy acceptors. The BODIPY dimers feature broad absorption in the range of 500&#8211;600&#8197;nm, complementing the chlorin absorption to provide absorption across the entire visible spectrum. Ultrafast (~10&#8197;ps) energy transfer was observed from photoexcited BODIPY dyads to chlorin subunits. Surprisingly, the energy&#8208;transfer rate is nearly independent of the position where the BODIPY dimer is attached to the chlorin and of the type of connecting linker. In addition, the energy&#8208;transfer rate from BODIPY dimers to chlorin is slower than the corresponding rate in arrays containing BODIPY monomers. The lower rate, corresponding to less efficient through&#8208;bond transfer, is most likely due to weaker electronic coupling between the ground state of the chlorin acceptor and the delocalized electronic state of the BODIPY dimer, compared to the localized state of a BODIPY monomer.

         <title>Centrohexaindane, a Unique Polyaromatic Hydrocarbon Bearing the Rare Cq(Cq)4 Core: Inelastic Neutron Scattering, Infrared and Raman Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Centrohexaindane is an unusual molecule that has a quaternary carbon atom that is coordinated to four further such quaternary carbon atoms as its core, each pair of which is bonded to an ortho&#8208;phenylene unit. Vibrational spectroscopy was used to explore the differences between the solution and solid state structures.







Abstract
The structure and vibrational spectroscopy of centrohexaindane, 1, was investigated. This unusual molecule has a quaternary carbon atom that is coordinated to four further such quaternary carbon atoms as its core, each pair of which is bonded to an ortho&#8208;phenylene unit. Previous NMR studies have shown that the molecule has tetrahedral (Td) symmetry in solution. The infrared and Raman spectra of chloroform and deuterochloroform solutions of 1 are completely in agreement with this conclusion, as the only modes that are visible are those allowed for Td symmetry. This is not the case in the solid state: X&#8208;ray powder diffraction indicates that the unit cell is triclinic or monoclinic with a volume in excess of 4000&#8197;&#197;3. The vibrational spectroscopy is consistent with C1 site symmetry and the presence of at least two molecules in the primitive cell. It is likely that the space group is centrosymmetric.

Mechanistic insights are provided to explain why a seemingly tiny change in substituent can completely change the reaction product. Both reaction paths were studied using density functional theory (DFT) calculations and it was shown how they are affected by substitution of the substrate.

         <title>Molecular Engineering to Boost the Photo&#8208;Oxidase Activity of Molecular Rotors in Colorimetric Sensing of Temperatures</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
To adjust the photocatalytic oxidation ability, CBPy and DAPy were designed and synthesized based on the enhancement and diminishment of the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) process, respectively. The photo&#8208;oxidase activity of molecular rotors was applied for the colorimetric detection of environmental temperatures for the first time.







Abstract
Some organic dyes and photosensitizers with strong visible absorption can behave as photo&#8208;responsive oxidase mimics. However, the relationship between the photo&#8208;oxidase activity and molecular structure remains unclear to date. In this work, a new type of photosensitizer with the characteristics of molecular rotors, namely DPPy, served as the molecular scaffold for further investigation. To adjust the photocatalytic oxidation ability, DAPy and CBPy were designed and synthesized based on the enhancement and diminishment of the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) process, respectively. Kinetic studies revealed that DAPy and CBPy both exhibited highly efficient photo&#8208;activated oxidase&#8208;like activity with 3,3&#8242;,5,5&#8242;&#8208;tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) as the substrate, which were in good accordance with their molecular engineering to promote either type I or type II reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. Impressively a colorimetric method based on the visible light induced oxidase&#8208;like activity of molecular rotors was developed to determine the environmental temperature for the first time. Both DAPy and CBPy showed distinct sensitivities toward temperature as compared with several molecular rotors based on the typical fluorimetric detection. This work provides a new strategy for the application of molecular rotors to overcome the non&#8208;emissive challenge in temperature sensing.

         <title>The Rise of Structurally Anisotropic Plasmonic Janus Gold Nanostars</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel synthesis of plasmonic gold Janus nanostars without templates or masks is reported. The study explores structurally Janus nanostructures with two distinct morphologies and a single&#8208;step growth process using pentatwinned seeds. The interplay of silver and bromide ions influences morphological differences. The SERS capability of Au Janus NSs was investigated; higher enhancement was shown with larger&#8208;sized particles.







Abstract
Nanostructures intrinsically possessing two different structural or functional features, often called Janus nanoparticles, are emerging as a potential material for sensing, catalysis, and biomedical applications. Herein, we report the synthesis of plasmonic gold Janus nanostars (NSs) possessing a smooth concave pentagonal morphology with sharp tips and edges on one side and, contrastingly, a crumbled morphology on the other. The methodology reported herein for their synthesis &#8211; a single&#8208;step growth reaction &#8211; is different from any other Janus nanoparticle preparation involving either template&#8208;assisted growth or a masking technique. Interestingly, the coexistence of lower&#8208; and higher&#8208;index facets was found in these Janus NSs. The general paradigm for synthesizing gold Janus NSs was investigated by understanding the kinetic control mechanism with the combinatorial effect of all the reagents responsible for the structure. The optical properties of the Janus NSs were realized by corelating their extinction spectra with the simulated data. The size&#8208;dependent surface&#8208;enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) activity of these Janus NSs was studied with 1,4&#8208;BDT as the model analyte. Finite&#8208;difference time&#8208;domain simulations for differently sized particles revealed the distribution of electromagnetic hot&#8208;spots over the particles resulting in enhancement of the SERS signal in a size&#8208;dependent manner.

         <title>Naphthodithiophene&#8208;Fused Porphyrins: Synthesis, Characterization, and Impact of Extended Conjugation on Aromaticity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Naphthodithiophene&#8208;fused porphyrins were prepared through a Heck&#8208;based cascade reaction and a Scholl reaction. An unusual trend was observed in the florescence quantum yield upon converting benzoporphyrin 2VTP to naphtho[1,2&#8208;b:4,3&#8208;b&#8217;]dithiophene&#8208;fused porphyrin (F2VTP). NICS analysis revealed different impacts of the two isomeric naphthodithiophenes on the global aromaticity upon fusion to porphyrin (F2VTP and F3VTP).







Abstract
The fusion of tetrapyrroles with aromatic heterocycles constitutes a useful tool for manipulating their opto&#8208;electronic properties. In this work, the synthesis of naphthodithiophene&#8208;fused porphyrins was achieved through a Heck reaction&#8208;based cascade of steps followed by the Scholl reaction. The naphthodithiophene&#8208;fused porphyrins display a unique set of optical and electronic properties. Fusion of the naphtho[2,1&#8208;b:3,4&#8208;b&#8217;]dithiophene to porphyrin (F2VTP) leads to a ~20% increase in the fluorescence lifetime, which is accompanied, unexpectedly, by a more than two&#8208;fold drop in the emission quantum yield (&#981;=0.018). In contrast, fusion of the isomeric naphtho[1,2&#8208;b:4,3&#8208;b&#8217;]dithiophene to porphyrin (F3VPT) results in a ~1.5&#8208;fold increase in the fluorescence quantum yield (&#981;=0.13) with a concomitant ~30&#8201;% increase in the fluorescence lifetime. This behavior suggests that fusion of the porphyrin with the naphthodithiopheno&#8208;system mainly affects the radiative rate constant in the Q&#8208;state deactivation pathway, where the effects of the isomeric naphtho[2,1&#8208;b:3,4&#8208;b&#8217;]dithiophene&#8208; versus naphtho[1,2&#8208;b:4,3&#8208;b&#8217;]dithiophene&#8208;fusion are essentially the opposite. Interestingly, nucleus&#8208;independent chemical shifts analysis revealed a considerable difference between the aromaticities of these two isomeric systems. Our results demonstrate that subtle structural differences in the fused components of the porphyrin can be reflected in rather significant differences between the photophysical properties of the resulting systems.

         <title>Temporal Control of Fluorescent EuW10 Aggregates for Autonomous DNA Capture and Information Encryption</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We demonstrate the temporal programming of the assembly and disassembly of EuW10 nanospheres using a pH clock reaction of acid/urease hydrolysis. The pH&#8208;responsive C12DMAO endow EuW10 nanospheres with dynamical properties, in which fluorescence changes are coded in this system. These fluorescent nanospheres provide new application in time&#8208;programmed information encryption.







Abstract
Self&#8208;assembly exploits noncovalent interaction to offer an effective method for the fabrication of materials. For Na9[EuW10O36]&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;32H2O (EuW10), the negative charges and abundant oxygen atoms on its surface provide a handle for static self&#8208;assembly. New properties are envisioned for EuW10 aggregates which are able to display such kinetics and time&#8208;programming characteristics, in order to satisfy more complex and intelligent application scenarios, such as DNA binding and information encryption. In this work, EuW10 coupling with stimuli&#8208;responsive dodecyl dimethylamine oxide (C12DMAO) can generate versatile aggregates with pH&#8208;responsive properties. We demonstrated the temporal programming of the assembly and disassembly of EuW10 nanospheres using a pH clock reaction of acid/urease hydrolysis. The pH clock reaction endows EuW10 assemblies with dynamical properties, in which the charges and fluorescence changes are coded in this system. These fluorescent assemblies provide new application in time&#8208;programmed DNA capture and information encryption.

An anionic coordination&#8208;chain&#8208;based hydrogen&#8208;bonded framework was applied to accommodate chiral and luminescent centers through a cation exchange reaction, with promising application for instant and quantitative enantioselective luminescence recognition. The competitive absorption and F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer processes contribute cooperatively to the luminescence changes, while the chiral cations that selectively interact with targeting chiral molecules lead to the enantioselective recognition property.







Abstract
Enantioselective sensing is highly crucial and challenging due to the highly similar physical/chemical properties of enantiomers which may have different chemical impact on organism. Luminescent coordination compounds have attracted great attention as sensing materials based on their controllable chemical and electric structures that can be highly matched with the targeted species. To achieve high&#8208;performance enantioselective sensing, the direct synthesis of chiral and luminescent bifunctional coordination compounds is a rational way but highly challenging due to the price and synthesis difficulty. Herein, an anionic coordination&#8208;chain&#8208;based hydrogen&#8208;bonded framework was applied as a host to accommodate chiral and luminescent centers via a facile cation exchange reaction, affording a bifunctional framework that possesses enantioselective sensing properties for the mixture of enantiomers. This study paves a pathway for constructing multifunctional coordination chain&#8208;based hydrogen&#8208;bonded frameworks for rapidly enantioselective sensing function.

Combining anion photoelectron spectroscopy with quantum chemistry computations, it was determined that the C2Al4&#8722; cluster adopts a boat&#8208;like structure, whereas a D3h isomer is the most stable structure for C2Al5&#8722;.







Abstract
The study of C2Al4&#8722;/0 and C2Al5&#8722;/0 was conducted using anion photoelectron spectroscopy and quantum chemical computations. The present findings reveal that C2Al4&#8722; has a boat&#8208;like structure, with a single C2 unit surrounded by four aluminum atoms. In contrast, the neutral C2Al4 species adopts a D2h planar structure with two planar tetracoordinate carbon (ptC) units, consistent with previous reports. Furthermore, the global minimum isomer of C2Al5&#8722; adopts a D3h symmetry, where the C2 unit interacts with five aluminum atoms. It was also found that a lower symmetry structure of C2Al5&#8722;, where all five aluminum atoms are located on the same side of the C2 unit, albeit slightly higher in energy compared to the D3h structure. These computations show that the D3h structure of C2Al5&#8722; is highly stable, exhibiting a large HOMO&#8208;LUMO gap.

         <title>Zero&#8208;Dimensional Sn&#8208;Based Enantiomeric Phase&#8208;Transition Materials with High&#8208;Tc and Dielectric Switching</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We successfully designed and synthesized a pair of new organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid enantiomeric high&#8208;temperature plastic phase&#8208;transition materials: (R/S)&#8208;[CH3CH(OH)CH2N(CH2CH3)3]2SnCl6 (1&#8208;R/1&#8208;S), which have a high temperature phase transition of Tc=384&#8197;K, and an obvious CD signal. In addition, compounds 1&#8208;R and 1&#8208;S also have good low&#8208;loss dielectric switch and broadband gap.







Abstract
The combination of chirality and phase&#8208;transition materials has broad application prospects. Therefore, based on the quasi&#8208;spherical theory and the thought strategy of introducing chirality, we have successfully synthesized a pair of chiral enantiomeric ligands (R/S)&#8208;triethyl&#8208;(2&#8208;hydroxypropyl)ammonium iodide, which can be combined with a tin hexachloride anion to obtain a pair of new organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid enantiomeric high&#8208;temperature plastic phase&#8208;transition materials: (R/S)&#8208;[CH3CH(OH)CH2N(CH2CH3)3]2SnCl6 (1&#8208;R/1&#8208;S), which have a high temperature phase transition of Tc=384&#8197;K, crystallize in the P21 chiral space group at room temperature, and have obvious CD signals. In addition, compounds 1&#8208;R and 1&#8208;S have a good low&#8208;loss dielectric switch and broadband gap. This work is conducive to the research into chiral high&#8208;temperature reversible plastic phase&#8208;transition materials, and promotes the development of multi&#8208;functional phase&#8208;transition materials.

         <title>Neighboring&#8208;group Participation by C&#8208;2 Acyloxy Groups: Influence of the Nucleophile and Acyl Group on the Stereochemical Outcome of Acetal Substitution Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Neighboring&#8208;group participation by C&#8208;2 acyloxy groups can control the 1,2&#8208;trans stereoselectivity of acetal substitution reactions with the employment of strong nucleophiles. 1,2&#8208;Trans selectivity increases with decreased electron&#8208;donating ability of the acyloxy groups at C&#8208;2.







Abstract
A single acyloxy group at C&#8208;2 can control the outcome of nucleophilic substitution reactions of pyran&#8208;derived acetals, but the extent of the neighboring&#8208;group participation depends on a number of factors. We show here that neighboring&#8208;group participation does not necessarily control the stereochemical outcome of acetal substitution reactions with weak nucleophiles. The 1,2&#8208;trans selectivity increased with increasing reactivity of the incoming nucleophile. This trend suggests the intermediacy of both cis&#8208;fused dioxolenium ions and oxocarbenium ions in the stereochemistry&#8208;determining step. In addition, as the electron&#8208;donating ability of the neighboring group decreased, the preference for the 1,2&#8208;trans products increased. Computational studies show how the barriers for the ring&#8208;opening reaction on the dioxolenium ions and the transition states to provide the oxocarbenium ions change with the electron&#8208;donating capacity of the C&#8208;2&#8208;acyloxy group and the reactivity of the nucleophile.

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light Enabled Dehydroxylative Alkylation of &#945;&#8208;Hydroxy Carboxylic Acid Derivatives via C&#8722;O Bond Cleavage</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Existing protocols for the boryl radical promoted dehydroxylative alkylation of &#945;&#8208;hydroxy carboxylic acid derivatives via C&#8722;O bond cleavage require the use of expensive radical initiators and relatively harsh conditions. An improved protocol is presented that uses cheap and readily available sodium tetraphenyl borate (NaBPh4) as a boron radical source. The reaction using the photoredox catalytic system could take place under mild conditions and avoid tedious preparation of free radical initiator (di&#8208;tert&#8208;butoxydiazene).







Abstract
A novel visible&#8208;light photoredox strategy is reported for the efficient dehydroxylative alkylation of a wide array of &#945;&#8208;hydroxy carboxylic acid derivatives using diaryl boron radical. The reaction features readily accessible starting materials, broad substrate scope with excellent functionality tolerance. Preliminary mechanistic studies reveal that the spin&#8208;center shift process is responsible for the C&#8722;O bond activation, which is promoted by the diaryl boron radical generated from bench&#8208;stable and commercially available tetraphenyl borate (NaBPh4).

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Existing protocols&lt;/b&gt; for the boryl radical promoted dehydroxylative alkylation of &#945;-hydroxy carboxylic acid derivatives via C&#8722;O bond cleavage require the use of expensive radical initiators and relatively harsh conditions. An improved protocol is presented that uses cheap and readily available sodium tetraphenyl borate (NaBPh&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) as a boron radical source. The reaction using the photoredox catalytic system could take place under mild conditions and avoid tedious preparation of free radical initiator (&lt;i&gt;di-tert&lt;/i&gt;-butoxydiazene).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A novel visible-light photoredox strategy is reported for the efficient dehydroxylative alkylation of a wide array of &#945;-hydroxy carboxylic acid derivatives using diaryl boron radical. The reaction features readily accessible starting materials, broad substrate scope with excellent functionality tolerance. Preliminary mechanistic studies reveal that the spin-center shift process is responsible for the C&#8722;O bond activation, which is promoted by the diaryl boron radical generated from bench-stable and commercially available tetraphenyl borate (NaBPh&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Properties on a Bisbenzofuropyrazine Core: Mechanochromism and Concentration&#8208;Controlled Vapochromism</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Stimulus&#8208;responsive organic materials with luminescence switching properties have attracted considerable attention for their practical applications in sensing, security, and display devices. In this paper, bent&#8208;type bisbenzofuropyrazine derivatives, Bent&#8208;H and Bent&#8208;sBu, with good solubilities were synthesized, and their physical and optical properties were investigated in detail. Bent&#8208;H gave three crystalline polymorphs, and they showed different luminescence properties depending on their crystal packing structures. In addition, Bent&#8208;H exhibited mechanochromic luminescence in spite of its rigid skeleton. Bent&#8208;sBu exhibited unique concentration&#8208;dependent vapochromic luminescence. Ground Bent&#8208;sBu was converted to blue&#8208;emissive, green&#8208;emissive, and green&#8208;emissive high&#8208;viscosity solution states at low, moderate, and high concentrations of CHCl3 vapor, respectively. This finding represents a concentration&#8208;dependent multi&#8208;phase transition with an organic solvent, which is of potent interest for application in sensing systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Dipolarophile&#8208;Steered Formal Stereodivergent Synthesis of 2,5&#8208;cis/trans&#8208;Pyrrolidines Based on Asymmetric 1,3&#8208;Dipolar Cycloaddition of Imino Lactones</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The stereodivergent asymmetric synthesis of 2,5&#8208;trans/cis pyrrolidines by 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloaddition using two different types of activated alkenes is described. When ylidene&#8208;isoxazolones were employed as dipolarophiles, the Ag/(S,Sp)&#8208;iPr&#8208;FcPHOX&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric [3+2] cycloaddition of imino lactones proceeded with 2,5&#8208;trans selectivity. Subsequent decarboxylation of the isoxazolone rings produced pyrrolidines with 2,5&#8208;trans stereoretention. In the reaction using acyclic enones as activated alkenes, the Ag/(R,Sp)&#8208;ThioClickFerrophos complex&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric [3+2] cycloaddition afforded 2,5&#8208;cis substituted pyrrolidines in high yield and enantioselectivity. Therefore, these methods can be considered as a formal stereodivergent synthesis of 2,5&#8208;cis/trans pyrrolidines.</dc:description>

         <title>Mechanism of CO2 reduction to methanol with H2 on an iron(II)scorpionate catalyst</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>CO2 utilization is an important process in the chemical industry with great environmental power. In this work we show how CO2 and H2 can be reacted to form methanol on an iron(II) center and highlight the bottlenecks for the reaction and what structural features are essential for efficient turnover. The calculations predict the reactions to proceed through three successive reaction cycles that start with heterolytic cleavage of H2 followed by sequential hydride and proton transfer processes. The H2 splitting process is an endergonic process and hence high pressures will be needed to overcome this step and trigger the hydrogenation reaction. Moreover, H2 cleavage into a hydride and proton requires a metal to bind hydride and a nearby source to bind the proton, such as an amide or pyrazolyl group, which the scorpionate ligand used here facilitates. As such the computations highlight the non&#8208;innocence of the ligand scaffold through proton shuttle from H2 to substrate as an important step in the reaction mechanism.</dc:description>

         <title>Alcohol&#8208;induced Conformational Changes and Thermodynamic Signatures in the Binding of Polyphenols to Proline&#8208;rich Salivary Proteins</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The first contact of polyphenols (tannins) with the human body occurs in the mouth, where they are known to interact with proline&#8208;rich proteins (PRPs). These interactions are important at a sensory level, especially for the development of astringency, but affect also various other biochemical processes. Employing thermodynamic measurements, fluorescence and CD spectroscopy, we investigated the binding process of the prototypical polyphenol ellagic acid (EA) to different IB&#8208;PRPs and BSA, also in the presence of ethanol, which is known to influence tannin&#8208;protein interactions. Binding of EA to BSA and the small peptide IB7&#8208;14 is weak, but very strong to IB9&#8208;37. The differences in binding strength and stoichiometry are due to differences in the binding motifs, which also lead to differences in the thermodynamic signatures of the binding process. EA binding to BSA is enthalpy&#8208;driven, whereas binding to both IB7&#8208;14 and IB9&#8208;37 is entropy&#8208;driven. The presence of 10 vol.% EtOH, as present in wines, increases the binding constant of EA with BSA and IB7&#8208;14 drastically, but not that with IB9&#8208;37, but changes the binding stoichiometry. These differences can be attributed to the effect of EtOH on the conformational dynamics of the proteins and to changes in hydration properties in alcoholic solution.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis and Characterization of Quinone Compounds Derived from Doubly&#8208; and Triply&#8208;Linked Diporphyrins and Tuning of Their Absorption Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Porphyrins are attracting increasing attention in materials science and photochemistry owing to their unique properties and diverse applications. This study focuses on modifying and tuning the absorption properties of porphyrins, specifically those of quinoidal porphyrins, to extend their spectral range into the near&#8208;infrared (NIR) region. We report the synthesis and structural and physical properties of quinone compounds derived from doubly&#8208; and triply&#8208;linked diporphyrins and their metal complexes. Doubly&#8208;linked diporphyrinquinone exhibits broad panchromatic absorption properties in solution owing to its low symmetry. Metal complexation markedly extends its absorption range to the near&#8208;infrared region. In contrast, the metal complexes of the triply&#8208;linked diporphyrinquinones exhibit sharp and strong absorption bands in the visible to near&#8208;infrared region owing to their higher symmetry. The longest absorption wavelength of the triply&#8208;linked diporphyrinquinones was approximately 1500 nm, which was significantly more red&#8208;shifted than that of the doubly&#8208;linked ones.</dc:description>

         <title>Second Generation&#160;of Near&#8208;Infrared Cyanine&#8208;Based Photocatalysts for Faster Organic&#160;Transformations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A second generation of cyanine&#8208;based near&#8208;infrared photocatalysts has been developed to accelerate organic transformations. Cyanines were prepared and fully characterized prior to evaluation of their photocatalytic activities. Catalyst efficiency was determined using two model oxidation and reduction reactions. For the aza&#8208;Henry reaction, cyanines bearing an amino group on the heptamethine chain allowed to obtain the best results. For trifluoromethylation, the stability of the photocatalyst was found to be the key parameter for efficient and rapid conversion.</dc:description>

         <title>Design, Synthesis and Catalytic Activity of (Cyclopentadienone)iron Complexes Containing a Stereogenic Plane and a Stereogenic Axis</title>

         <dc:description>Herein, we report the synthesis and characterization of several chiral (cyclopentadienone)iron complexes (CICs) featuring either two (R)&#8208;BINOL&#8208;derived stereoaxes or a combination of one (R)&#8208;BINOL&#8208;derived stereoaxis and a stereogenic plane. The stereoplane&#8208;containing CICs were obtained as epimer mixtures, which were separated by flash column chromatography and assigned an absolute configuration based on XRD analysis, NMR and order of elution. The library was tested in the asymmetric hydrogenation of ketones showing good catalytic activity and a moderate stereoselectivity which, notably, is mostly imparted by the stereogenic plane. Indeed, the two epimers of each CIC possessing a stereoplane show opposite and equally strong stereochemical preference.</dc:description>

         <title>Yet Another Case of Lithium Metal Atoms and Germanium Atoms Sharing Chemistry in the Solid State: Synthesis and Structural Characterization of Ba2LiGe3</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Several Ba&#8211;Li&#8211;Ge ternary phases are known and structurally characterized, including the title compound Ba2LiGe3. Its structure is reported to contain [Ge6]10&#8211; anions that exhibit delocalized bonding with a H&#252;ckel&#8208;like aromatic character. The Ge atoms are in the same plane with the Li atoms, and if both types of atoms are considered as covalently bonded, [LiGe3]4&#8211; honeycomb&#8208;like layers will result. The latter are separated by slabs of Ba2+ cations. However, based on the systematic work detailed herein, it is necessary to re&#8208;evaluate the phase as Ba2Li1&#8211;xGe3+x (x &lt; 0.05). Although small, the homogeneity range is clearly demonstrated in the gradual change of the unit cell for four independent samples. Subsequent characterization by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction methods shows that the Ba2Li1&#8211;xGe3+x structure, responds to the varied number of valence electrons and the changes are most pronounced for the refined lengths of the Li&#8211;Ge and Ge&#8211;Ge bonds. Indirectly, the changes in the Ge&#8211;Li/Ge distances within layers affect the stacking too, and these changes can be correlated to the variation of the c&#8208;cell parameter. Chemical bonding analysis based on TB&#8208;LMTO&#8208;ASA level calculations affirms the notion for covalent character of the Ge&#8211;Ge bonds; the Ba&#8211;Ge and Li&#8211;Ge interactions also show some degree of covalency.</dc:description>

         <title>Synergistic Activation of Inert Iron Oxide Basal Planes through Heterostructure Formation and Doping for Efficient Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Iron oxides have emerged as a very promising and cost&#8208;effective alternative to precious metal catalysts for hydrogen production. However, the inert basal plane of iron oxides needs to be activated to enhance their catalytic efficiency. In this study, we employed heterostructure engineering and doped nickel to cooperatively activate the basal planes of iron oxide (Ni&#8208;Fe2O3/CeO2 HSs) to achieve high hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity. The Ni&#8208;Fe2O3/CeO2 HSs electrocatalyst demonstrates excellent basic HER activity and stability, such as an extremely low overpotential of 43 mV at 10 mA cm&#8208;2 current density and corresponding Tafel slope of 58.6 mV dec&#8208;1. The increase in electrocatalyst activity and acceleration of hydrogen precipitation kinetics arises from the dual modulation of Ni doping and heterostructure, which not only modulates the electrocatalyst's electronic structure, but also increases the number and exposure of active sites. Remarkably, the generation of heterogeneous structure makes the catalyst stable. The Ni&#8208;doped catalyst has not only increased HER activity but also low&#8208;temperature resistance. These results suggest that the synergistic activation of inert iron oxide basal planes through heterostructure formation and doping is a feasible strategy. Furthermore, for efficient electrocatalytic water splitting, this technique can be extended to other non&#8208;noble metal oxides.</dc:description>

         <title>A Rising Star: Luminescent Carbene&#8208;Metal&#8208;Amide Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This concept article on luminescent carbene&#8208;metal&#8208;amide (CMA) complexes is presented in terms of molecular design strategies, structure&#8208;property correlations and their applications in organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs). The future directions and opportunities for advancing the development of CMA complexes and the related OLEDs are proposed as well.







Abstract
Coinage metal (gold, silver, and copper) complexes are attractive candidates to substitute the widely studied noble metal complexes, such as, iridium(III) and platinum(II), as luminescent materials in organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs).

&lt;p&gt;This concept article on luminescent carbene-metal-amide (CMA) complexes is presented in terms of molecular design strategies, structure-property correlations and their applications in organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs). The future directions and opportunities for advancing the development of CMA complexes and the related OLEDs are proposed as well.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coinage metal (gold, silver, and copper) complexes are attractive candidates to substitute the widely studied noble metal complexes, such as, iridium(III) and platinum(II), as luminescent materials in organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs). However, the development of coinage metal complexes exhibiting high emission quantum yields and short exciton lifetimes is still a formidable challenge. In the past few years, coinage metal complexes featuring a carbene-metal-amide (CMA) motif have emerged as a new class of luminescent materials in OLEDs. Thanks to the coinage metal-bridged linear geometry, coplanar conformation, and the formation of excited states with dominant ligand-to-ligand charge transfer character and reduced metal d-orbital participation, most CMA complexes have high radiative rates via thermally activated delayed fluorescence. Currently, the family of CMA complexes have rapidly evolved and remarkable progresses in CMA-based OLEDs have been made. Here, a Concept article on CMA complexes is presented, with a focus on molecular design principles, the correlation between molecular structure/conformation and optoelectronic properties, as well as OLED performance. The future prospects of CMA complexes are also discussed.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Synthesis, Characterisation, and Functionalisation of Charged Two&#8208;Dimensional MoS2</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Negatively charged 2H&#8208;MoS2: The surface of 2H&#8208;MoS2 was activated by reacting liquid exfoliated 2H&#8208;MoS2 with NaBH4 yielding a novel anionically charged semi&#8208;conducting two&#8208;dimensional 2H&#8208;MoS2 defined as n&#8208;2H&#8208;MoS2. The negative doping allowed for dispersibility in water and other polar solvents (unlike pristine 2H&#8208;MoS2), caused a red&#8208;shift in the material's photoluminescence, and allowed for facile functionalisation.







Abstract
The applications of exfoliated MoS2 are limited by its inert surface and poor interface. We have activated the surface of exfoliated 2H&#8208;MoS2 by reacting it with NaBH4, forming an n&#8208;doped material as demonstrated by a negative zeta&#8208;potential value &#950;=&#8722;25&#8197;mV and a 20&#8197;nm (0.05&#8197;eV) red&#8208;shift in its photoluminescence spectrum. The novel material's spectral properties were consistent with pristine 2H&#8208;MoS2 (as determined by HR&#8208;TEM, XPS, pXRD, DRIFT, TGA, and Raman spectroscopy). Importantly, it was readily dispersed in H2O unlike 2H&#8208;MoS2. Its dispersibility properties were explored for a variety of solvents and could be directly correlated with the relative permittivity of the respective solvents. The charged 2H&#8208;MoS2 reacted readily with an organo&#8208;iodide to deliver functionalized 2H&#8208;MoS2. Our approach delivers aqueous dispersions of semiconducting 2H&#8208;MoS2, without additives or chemical functionalities, and allows for controlled and facile functionalization of 2H&#8208;MoS2 opening multiple new avenues of semi&#8208;conducting MoS2 application.

         <title>Peptide Macrocyclization Guided by Reversible Covalent Templating</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Towards sequence/size defined macrocycles: Here we demonstrate a non&#8208;nucleic acid templated synthesis of peptide macrocycle complexes. By using hydrazone bonds, we template and organize short peptide oligomers along a solid supported peptide strand and cyclize them using microwave assisted solid phase peptide synthesis to form sequence and size defined macrocycles. The products are then released from the solid support via acidic hydrolysis and detected by LC&#8211;MS.







Abstract
The creation of complementary products via templating is a hallmark feature of nucleic acid replication. Outside of nucleic acid&#8208;like molecules, the templated synthesis of a hetero&#8208;complementary copy is still rare. Herein we describe one cycle of templated synthesis that creates homomeric macrocyclic peptides guided by linear instructing strands. This strategy utilizes hydrazone formation to pre&#8208;organize peptide oligomeric monomers along the template on a solid support resin, and microwave&#8208;assisted peptide synthesis to couple monomers and cyclize the strands. With a flexible templating strand, we can alter the size of the complementary macrocycle products by increasing the length and number of the binding peptide oligomers, showing the potential to precisely tune the size of macrocyclic products. For the smaller macrocyclic peptides, the products can be released via hydrolysis and characterized by ESI&#8208;MS.

         <title>Activation of the GaI Cation for Bond Activation: from Oxidative Additions into C&#8722;Cl and H&#8722;P Bonds to Reversible Insertion into P4</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Umpolung of the GaI cation: A GaI pincer complex allows significantly different reactivity compared to other known cationic GaI complexes. First controlled oxidative additions of the GaI cation into C&#8722;Cl, H&#8722;P, and P&#8722;P bonds are presented, as well as cycloaddition reactions to 1,3&#8208;dienes. Intriguingly, the insertion into the P4 cluster was discovered to be reversible.







Abstract
Although the discovery of the GaI complex salt [Ga(PhF)2&#8208;3][Al(ORF)4] (RF=C(CF3)3, PhF=C6H5F) invoked the preparation of a diverse library of cationic Ga(I) coordination complexes and clusters, studies on small molecule activation with low&#8208;valent GaI cations are scarce. Herein, a first experimental study on the reactivity of a monomeric Ga(I) cation activated with a pyridine&#8211;diimine pincer ligand (in [Ga(PDIdipp)][Al(ORF)4]) towards small&#8208;molecules is reported. First controlled oxidative additions of the GaI cation into C&#8722;Cl, H&#8722;P and P&#8722;P bonds are presented. Moreover, the [4+1]cycloaddition to butadienes was achieved. Intriguingly, the isolated, blue insertion product into the P&#8722;P bond of P4 allows for the quantitative release of the P4 molecule upon reaction with AlEt3 and butadienes. Reversible P4 insertion of main&#8208;group metals has previously been reported for Ge and Sn, respectively. The experimental study is supported by high&#8208;level computational analysis of the in&#8208;part reversible oxidative additions at the DLPNO&#8208;CCSD(T)/def2&#8208;TZVPP//PBEh&#8208;3c/def2&#8208;mSVP level of theory with COSMO&#8208;RS solvation in 1,2&#8208;difluorobenzene.

         <title>Liquid&#8208;Free, Self&#8208;Repairable, Recyclable, and Highly Stretchable Colorless Solid Ionic Conductive Elastomers for Strain/Temperature Sensors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A liquid&#8208;free polyurethane type ionic conductive elastomer (ICE) was prepared in a facile manner. The mechanical robust, transparent ICE with self&#8208;healing ability proved its advantages in strain and temperature sensing. The recycling and remolding process did not deteriorate the sensing properties







Abstract
Solid&#8208;state ionic conductive elastomers (ICEs) can fundamentally overcome the disadvantages of hydrogels and ionogels (their liquid components tend to leak or evaporate), and are considered to be ideal materials for flexible ionic sensors. In this study, a liquid&#8208;free ionic polyurethane (PU) type conductive elastomer (ICE&#8208;2) was synthesized and studied. The PU type matrix with microphase separation endowed ICE&#8208;2 with excellent mechanical versatility. The disulfide bond exchange reaction in the hard phase and intermolecular hydrogen bonds contributed to damage repairing ability. ICE&#8208;2 exhibited good ionic conductivity (2.86&#215;10&#8722;6&#8197;S/cm), high transparency (average transmittance &gt;89&#8201;%, 400~800&#8197;nm), excellent mechanical properties (tensile strength of 3.06&#8197;MPa, elongation at break of 1760&#8201;%, and fracture energy of 14.98&#8197;kJ/m2), appreciable self&#8208;healing ability (healing efficiency &gt;90&#8201;%), satisfactory environmental stability, and outstanding recyclability. The sensor constructed by ICE&#8208;2 could not only realize the perception of temperature changes, but also accurately and sensitively detect various human activities, including joint movements and micro&#8208;expression changes. This study provides a simple and effective strategy for the development of flexible and soft ionic conductors for sensors and human&#8208;machine interfaces.

ICE-2 exhibited good ionic conductivity (2.86&#215;10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;6&lt;/sup&gt;&#8197;S/cm), high transparency (average transmittance &amp;gt;89&#8201;%, 400~800&#8197;nm), excellent mechanical properties (tensile strength of 3.06&#8197;MPa, elongation at break of 1760&#8201;%, and fracture energy of 14.98&#8197;kJ/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), appreciable self-healing ability (healing efficiency &amp;gt;90&#8201;%), satisfactory environmental stability, and outstanding recyclability. The sensor constructed by ICE-2 could not only realize the perception of temperature changes, but also accurately and sensitively detect various human activities, including joint movements and micro-expression changes. This study provides a simple and effective strategy for the development of flexible and soft ionic conductors for sensors and human-machine interfaces.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Versatile Route to Acyl (MIDA)Boronates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Exploiting the reactivity of the novel acetyl (MiDA)boronate radical allows access to a broad range of acyl (MIDA)boronates, which in suitable cases can be converted into B(MIDA) substituted furans and pyrroles.







Abstract
A modular approach to highly functional acyl (MIDA)boronates is described. It involves the generation of the hitherto unknown radical derived from acetyl (MIDA)boronate and its capture by various alkenes, including electronically unbiased, unactivated alkenes. In contrast to the anion of acetyl (MIDA)boronate, which has not so far been employed in synthesis, the corresponding radical is well behaved and readily produced from the novel &#945;&#8208;xanthyl acetyl (MIDA)boronate. This shelf&#8208;stable, easily prepared solid is a convenient acyl (MIDA)boronate transfer agent that provides a direct entry to numerous otherwise inaccessible structures, including latent 1,4&#8208;dicarbonyl derivatives that can be transformed into B(MIDA) substituted pyrroles and furans. A competition experiment indicated the acyl (MIDA)boronate substituted radical to be more stable than the all&#8208;carbon acetonyl radical but somewhat less reactive in additions to alkenes.

         <title>Total Synthesis of (&#8722;)&#8208;5&#8208;Deoxyenterocin and Attempted Late&#8208;Stage Functionalization Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The polyketide natural product (&#8722;)&#8208;5&#8208;deoxyenterocin (2) was stereoselectively synthesized from aldehyde 1, which was in turn obtained from pentane&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triol and (&#8722;)&#8208;menthone. An attempted functionalization at position C5 remained futile, although several C&#8722;H activation methods could be successfully applied to (3aR)&#8208;(+)&#8208;sclareolide (3).







Abstract
The first total synthesis of (&#8722;)&#8208;5&#8208;deoxyenterocin has been accomplished starting from pentane&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triol (16 steps in the longest linear sequence, 0.2&#8201;% overall yield). (&#8722;)&#8208;Menthone served as the source of chirality to distinguish the enantiotopic hydroxymethyl groups of the substrate. Key steps of the synthesis include two aldol reactions to either end of the C5&#8208;skeleton, a diastereoselective hydroxylation reaction and a biomimetic twofold intramolecular aldol reaction as the final step. Although this step suffered from geometrical constraints and was low yielding (10&#8201;%), enough synthetic material could be secured to substantiate the relative and absolute configuration of the natural product. Additional experiments were directed toward a C&#8722;H functionalization at carbon atom C5. Despite the fact that several protocols could be successfully applied to (3aR)&#8208;(+)&#8208;sclareolide as model substrate, (&#8722;)&#8208;5&#8208;deoxyenterocin withstood any selective functionalization.

The hydrogen&#8208;bond synthon between COOH and CONH2 drives the co&#8208;crystallization between N&#8208;Fmoc&#8208;pentafluorophenylalanine and benzamide. In water, the two molecules self&#8208;assemble to form a hydrogel with well&#8208;defined fibers having the same structure observed in the crystal state.

         <title>One Ligand to Bind them All: S~C~S2&#8722; Carbon&#8208; and Sulfur&#8208;Based Gem&#8208;Dianion as Structuring Ligand for Iron Polymetallic Assemblies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bis&#8208;(diphenylthiophosphinoyl)methanediide dianion (SCS)2&#8722; is an ideal platform for the building of polymetallic iron assemblies in which the same carbon and sulfur environment is maintained upon redox states changes and nuclearity increase. Such a variety of structures with a same C&#8208;based ligand is unique in the frame or nitrogenase cofactor models.







Abstract
Numerous synthetic models of the FeMo&#8208;co cluster of nitrogenases have been proposed to find the simplest structure with relevant reactivity. Indeed, such structures are able to perform multi&#8208;electrons reduction processes, such as the conversion of N2 to ammonia, and of CO2 into methane and alkenes. The most challenging parameter to imitate is indeed the central carbide ligand, which is believed to maintain the integrity of iron sulfide assembly during the course of catalytic cycles. The study proposes the use of bis(diphenylthiophosphinoyl)methanediide (SCS)2&#8722; as an ideal platform for the synthesis of bi&#8208; and tetra&#8208;metallic iron complexes, in which the iron&#8208;carbon interaction is maintained upon structural diversification and redox state changes.

         <title>Photo&#8208;Induced &#945;&#8208;Aminoalkylation of Sulfonylarenes with Alkylamines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The &#945;&#8208;aminoalkylation of sulfonylarenes with alkylamines was found to be induced by photoirradiation. Here various types of alkylamines such as trialkylamines, dialkylamines, N,N&#8208;dialkylanilines and N&#8208;alkylanilines as well as sulfonylarenes containing an azole, azine, heterole or benzene ring are available. The reaction proceeds through homolytic aromatic substitution (HAS) process consisting of addition of an &#945;&#8208;aminoalkyl radical to a sulfonylarene and elimination of the sulfonyl radical to give the &#945;&#8208;arylalkylamine, where photoirradiation is considered to induce homolysis of sulfonylarenes leading to generation of &#945;&#8208;aminoalkyl radicals and make a radical chain operative.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Preparation of flexible supercapacitors with excellent mechanical properties and self&#8208;healing properties is of great significance but still remains a challenge. A self&#8208;healable conductive hydrogel based on poly N&#8208;hydroxyethyl acrylamide (PHEAA) is fabricated as electrolyte for supercapacitors. The design of the physically cross&#8208;linked dual network, and rich hydrogen bonds endow the hydrogel with robust mechanical properties and strong self&#8208;healing ability. The hydrogel exhibited an excellent stretchability (723%) and a high ionic conductivity (21.8 mS/cm). Specially, by in&#8208;situ growth of electrode film, a non&#8208;laminated supercapacitor is obtained with flexibility and self&#8208;healing ability. Due to the non&#8208;laminated structure, the supercapacitor can work stably under bending and punching. The supercapacitor possessed an areal capacitance of 253.1 mF/cm2 and the capacitance retention was 80% after five cutting&#8208;healing cycles. The pseudo&#8208;capacitance contribution of the supercapacitor after self&#8208;healing was discussed. It is noteworthy that the supercapacitor maintains the ability to power a clock after self&#8208;healing.</dc:description>

         <title>Surface modification functionalized carbon dots</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Carbon dots (CDs) smaller than 10 nm constitute a new type of fluorescent carbon&#8208;based nanomaterial. They have attracted much attention owing to their unique structures and excellent photoelectric properties. Primitive CDs usually comprise carbon and oxygen and are synthesized in one step from various natural products or synthetic organic compounds, usually via microwave or hydrothermal methods. However, the uniformity of surface functional groups often make CDs lack the diversity of active sites required for specific applications. Therefore, the functionalization of CDs by specific groups is a powerful strategy for improving their photophysical and photochemical properties. This paper reviews surface modification strategies to overcome these shortcomings. Functionalizing CDs using covalent or non&#8208;covalent modification can give them unique properties and broaden their applicability.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Homoleptic [L&#8211;I&#8211;L]&#8314; iodine(I) complexes (where L is a R3R2R1N tertiary amine) were synthesized via the [L&#8211;Ag&#8211;L]&#8314; &#8594; &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;[L&#8211;I&#8211;L]&#8314; cation exchange reaction.

         <title>Modulating Strain in Twisted Pyrene&#8208;Fused Azaacenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The design and synthesis of strained aromatics provide an additional insight into the relationship between structure and properties. In the last years, several approaches to twist pyrene&#8208;fused azaacenes have been developed that allow to introduce twists of different sizes. Herein, we describe the synthesis of a new set of twisted dibenzotetraazahexacenes consituted by fused pyrene and quinoxaline residues that have been distorted by introducing increasingly larger substituents on the quinoxaline residues. Their twisted structure has been demonstrated by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. Furthermore, absorption, fluorescence, electrochemical and theoretical studies shine light on the effects of the substituents and twists on the optoelectronic and redox properties.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Black Phosphorene Quantum Dots from Red Phosphorus
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Black phosphorene quantum dots can now be made at remarkably low cost in a simple two step process. Ball milling cheap abundant red phosphorus creates quantu dots trapped in bulk, which can then be freed by etching the surrounding amorphous phosphorus with lithium electride solution.







Abstract
Black phosphorene quantum dots (BPQDs) are most commonly derived from high&#8208;cost black phosphorus, while previous syntheses from the low&#8208;cost red phosphorus (Pred) allotrope are highly oxidised. Herein, we present an intrinsically scalable method to produce high quality BPQDs, by first ball&#8208;milling Pred to create nanocrystalline Pblack and subsequent reductive etching using lithium electride solvated in liquid ammonia. The resultant ~25&#8197;nm BPQDs are crystalline with low oxygen content, and spontaneously soluble as individualized monolayers in tertiary amide solvents, as directly imaged by liquid&#8208;phase transmission electron microscopy. This new method presents a scalable route to producing quantities of high quality BPQDs for academic and industrial applications.

         <title>Gold(I)&#8208;N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene Synthons in Organometallic Synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Golden synthons in organometallic synthesis. In this review, key gold&#8208;NHC complexes employed in organometallic synthesis are discussed in detail (NHC=N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene). Besides their synthesis, the uses of these synthons as mechanistic probes are presented, as are their applications as efficient (pre&#8208;)catalysts, antitumor agents and/or photoemissive materials.







Abstract
The prominent role of gold&#8208;N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) complexes in numerous research areas such as homogeneous (photo)catalysis, medicinal chemistry and materials science has prompted organometallic chemists to design gold&#8208;based synthons that permit access to target complexes through simple synthetic steps under mild conditions. In this review, the main gold&#8208;NHC synthons employed in organometallic synthesis are discussed. Mechanistic aspects involved in their synthesis and reactivity as well as applications of gold&#8208;NHC synthons as efficient pre&#8208;catalysts, antitumor agents and/or photo&#8208;emissive materials are presented.

In this review, the main gold-NHC synthons employed in organometallic synthesis are discussed. Mechanistic aspects involved in their synthesis and reactivity as well as applications of gold-NHC synthons as efficient pre-catalysts, antitumor agents and/or photo-emissive materials are presented.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
With the continuous progress of technology, the research and development of new materials has become a hot topic in today's scientific community. Among them, metal&#8208;free perovskite has attracted widespread attention due to its unique photoelectric properties and environmental friendliness. With continuous development, new progress has been made in the growth of metal&#8208;free perovskite single crystals and device research, and high&#8208;sensitivity metal&#8208;free perovskite single crystal X&#8208;ray detectors have been prepared. This article will delve into the principles of metal&#8208;free perovskite and its application in X&#8208;ray imaging.







Abstract
Metal&#8208;free perovskites are a promising class of materials for X&#8208;ray detection due to their unique structural, optical, and electrical properties. Here, we first delve into the stoichiometry and geometric argument of metal&#8208;free perovskites. Followed, the alternative A/B/X ions and hydrogen&#8208;bonding are clearly introduced to further optimize the materials&#8217; stability and properties. Finally, we provide a comprehensive overview of their potential applications for flexible X&#8208;ray images and prospects for metal&#8208;free perovskite development. In conclusion, metal&#8208;free perovskite is a promising material for X&#8208;ray detection. Its stoichiometric and geometric parameters, ion, and hydrogen bond selection, and application prospects are worthy of further study.

         <title>Gold&#8208;Zinc Cooperative Catalysis for Seven&#8208;exo&#8208;dig Hydrocarboxylation of Internal Alkynes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Seven&#8208;exo&#8208;dig hydrocarboxylation of internal alkynes was developed with gold&#8208;zinc bimetallic catalysts activating alkyne&#8208;tethered carboxylic acids via cooperative action of the gold and zinc sites. N&#8208;Substituents of the NHC ligand for gold complexes significantly affected their catalytic activities, in which a gold complex with a 2,6&#8208;dibenzhydryl&#8208;4&#8208;methylphenyl substituent served as the most effective catalyst for the seven&#8208;membered ring formation.







Abstract
Seven&#8208;exo&#8208;dig hydrocarboxylation of nonactivated internal alkynes with conformationally flexible linker chains was achieved with cooperative gold&#8208;zinc catalysts composed of an imidazo[1,5&#8208;a]pyridinylidene ligand including a bipyridine coordination site at the C5 position. A proximity effect of the gold and zinc sites was essential for their high catalytic activity, in which the internal alkyne activated by the cationic gold species was attacked by the carboxylic acid deprotonated by the basic zinc site. Using a gold(I)&#8208;complex with a bulky aromatic N&#8208;substituent, 2,6&#8208;dibenzhydryl&#8208;4&#8208;methylphenyl group, for the NHC ligand facilitated seven&#8208;membered ring formation while minimizing intermolecular hydrocarboxylation as an undesired side reaction. The reaction mechanism was investigated by quantum chemical calculations.

         <title>Selective and pH&#8208;Independent Detection of Ba2+ in Water by a Benzo&#8208;21&#8208;crown&#8208;7&#8208;Functionalized BODIPY</title>

         <dc:description>
Detection of Ba2+: Herein, we report on a highly Ba2+&#8208;selective, Ba2+&#8208;sensitive and pH independent fluorescent probe with a high photostability in water (cf. TOC). This fluorescent probe is equipped with a benzo&#8208;21&#8208;crown&#8208;7 as a highly selective Ba2+ ionophore and a tetramethylated BODIPY fluorophore.







Abstract
Herein, we report on highly Ba2+ selective fluorescence sensing in water by a fluorescent probe consisting of a benzo&#8208;21&#8208;crown&#8208;7 as a Ba2+ binding unit (ionophore) and a tetramethylated BODIPY fluorophore as a fluorescence reporter. This fluorescent probe showed a Ba2+ induced fluorescence enhancement (FE) by a factor of 12&#177;1 independently of the pH value and a high Ba2+ sensitivity with a limit of detection (LOD) of (17.2&#177;0.3)&#8197;&#956;M. Moreover, a second fluorescent probe consisting of the same BODIPY fluorophore, but a benzo&#8208;18&#8208;crown&#8208;6 as a cation&#8208;responsive binding moiety, showed an even higher FE upon Ba2+ complexation by a factor of 85&#177;3 and a lower LOD of (13&#177;3)&#8197;&#956;M albeit a lower Ba2+ selectivity. The fluorescence sensing mechanism of Ba2+ was further investigated by time&#8208;resolved fluorescence as well as transient absorption spectroscopy (TAS) and it turned out that within these probes a blocking of a photoinduced electron transfer (PET) by Ba2+ is very likely responsible for the FE.

         <title>Hydrofluorination of Alkynes: From (E) to (Z)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The hydrofluorination of alkynes provides direct access to synthetically useful monofluoroalkenes and difluoroalkanes. This review showcases the developments on this subject, from early work to recent advances on various substrates.







Abstract
The hydrofluorination of alkynes is an efficient synthetic route to monofluoroalkenes or difluoroalkanes. Both fluorinated motifs have found applications in medicinal chemistry and beyond. This review explores the recent advances in the hydrofluorination of diverse alkynes through various activation methods, from classical coinage metal catalysis to metal&#8208;free conditions. The range of alkynes goes from the simplest unactivated alkynes to activated ones (ynones and derivatives, ynamides, alkynyl sulfides and sulfones as much as haloalkynes). Regio&#8208; and stereoselective methods exists, but there is still room for improvement depending on the type of alkyne.

         <title>The Rapid Synthesis of Colibactin Warhead Model Compounds Using New Metal&#8208;Free Photocatalytic Cyclopropanation Reactions Facilitates the Investigation of Biological Mechanisms</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two new metal&#8208;free photocatalytic cyclopropanations employing eosin in the green solvent ethanol have been developed and then applied to the synthesis of colibactin warhead models. Using the models, we show what features can lead to nucleophilic addition at the cyclopropyl unit and which ones favor a ring expansion&#8208;addition sequence. We also show that copper could be responsible for catalyzing the known oxidation of the colibactin&#8208;DNA adduct.







Abstract
Herein, we report the synthesis of a series of colibactin warhead model compounds using two newly developed metal&#8208;free photocatalytic cyclopropanation reactions. These mild cyclopropanations expand the known applications of eosin within synthesis. A halogen atom transfer reaction mode has been harnessed so that dihalides can be used as the cyclopropanating agents. The colibactin warhead models were then used to provide new insight into two key mechanisms in colibactin chemistry. An explanation is provided for why the colibactin warhead sometimes undergoes a ring expansion&#8208;addition reaction to give fused cyclobutyl products while at other times nucleophiles add directly to the cyclopropyl unit (as when DNA adds to colibactin). Finally, we provide some evidence that Cu(II) chelated to colibactin may catalyze an important oxidation of the colibactin&#8208;DNA adduct. The Cu(I) generated as a result could then also play a role in inducing double strand breaks in DNA.

         <title>Highly Efficient Luminescence from a Red Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Emitter with Flexible Conformation of Ancillary Groups</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The freer it goes, the brighter it shines. Rigid structure usually shows a positive effect on the efficiency of TADF emitters. In this work, Ph&#8208;TPA with flexible conformation of ancillary groups exhibited higher efficiency than Mc&#8208;TPA with conformationally locked ancillary groups. The macrocycle in MC&#8208;TPA made a significant contribution to the reorganization energy, leading to a severe non&#8208;radiative decay.







Abstract
Robust scaffolds were typically applied in thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) molecules to suppress the non&#8208;radiative decay, trigger the fast spin&#8208;flipping, and enhance the light out&#8208;coupling efficiency. Herein, we disclosed for the first time the positive effect of flexible conformation of ancillary groups on the photophysical properties of TADF emitter. The red TADF emitter Ph&#8208;TPA with flexible conformation demonstrated small excited&#8208;state structural distortion and low reorganization energy compared to the counterpart Mc&#8208;TPA with a rigid macrocycle. Consequently, Ph&#8208;TPA showed an excellent photoluminescent quantum yield (PLQY) of 92&#8201;% and a state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 30.6&#8201;% at 630&#8197;nm. This work could deepen our understanding of structure&#8208;property relationships of organic luminophores and help us to rationalize the design of efficient TADF materials.

         <title>Cobalt&#8208;Catalyzed Decarboxylative Allylations: Development and Mechanistic Studies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sustainable catalysis: The development of a cobalt&#8208;catalyzed decarboxylative allylation of nitrophenyl alkanes, nitroalkanes, and ketones is accomplished. The protocol offers the regioselective synthesis of various allylated products with broad functional group tolerance. Mechanistic studies revealed an unusual activation of Co(II)&#8208;salts using new organoreductants.







Abstract
In recent years, there has been a concerted drive to develop methods that are greener and more sustainable. Being an earth&#8208;abundant transition metal, cobalt offers an attractive substitute for commonly employed precious metal catalysts, though reactions engaging cobalt are still less developed. Herein, we report a method to achieve the decarboxylative allylation of nitrophenyl alkanes, nitroalkanes, and ketones employing cobalt. The reaction allows for the formation of various substituted allylated products in moderate&#8208;excellent yields with a broad scope. Additionally, the synthetic potential of the methodology is demonstrated by the transformation of products into versatile heterocyclic motifs. Mechanistic studies revealed an in&#8197;situ activation of the Co(II)/dppBz precatalyst by the carboxylate salt to generate a Co(I)&#8208;species, which is presumed to be the active catalyst.

         <title>Pd Complexes of N&#8208;Methylcorroles.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Alkylation of one of the inner core nitrogen atoms is one possible approach to obtain dianionic corrole ligands, suitable for the coordination of divalent metal ions. The inner core N&#8208;methylation can be obtained by reaction of the corrole with CH3I, but the reaction conditions should be optimized to limit the formation of the di&#8208;methylated derivative. Two regioisomers, the N&#8208;21 and the N&#8208;22 methyl derivatives are obtained from the reaction, with the first product achieved in a higher amount. The structural characterization of the reaction products evidenced the distortion induced by the introduction of the methyl groups; the N&#8208;methylcorroles are chiral compounds and the enantiomers have been separated and their absolute configuration assigned by ECD computations. The Pd insertion has been achieved in the case of monosubstituted corroles and the X&#8208;ray characterization of the complexes showed the distortion of the macrocycles. The Pd complexes do not show luminescence emission but are able to produce singlet oxygen upon irradiation. The Pd(II) complexes have been&#160;inserted in Human Serum Albumin (HSA) and dispersed in water: the protein protects the corroles from photobleaching and a switch from the type II to the type I mechanism in reactive oxygen species (ROS) production is observed.</dc:description>

         <title>Frustrated Lewis Pair Chelation in the p&#8208;Block</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Frustrated Lewis pairs (FLPs) have been the subject of considerable study since the field&#8217;s inception. While much of the research into FLPs has centered around small molecule activation for diverse stoichiometric and catalytic transformations, intramolecular FLPs also show promise as chelating ligands. The cooperative action of Lewis basic and acidic moieties enables intramolecular FLPs to stabilize low oxidation state centers and (consequently) reactive molecular fragments through a donor&#8208;acceptor approach, making them an attractive ligand class in main group element chemistry. This review outlines the state of FLP chelation to date throughout the p&#8208;block, encompassing primarily groups 13&#8211;16.</dc:description>

         <title>Challenges in the Direct Detection of Chirality&#8208;induced Spin Selectivity: Investigation of Foldamer&#8208;based Donor&#8208;Acceptor Dyads</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Over the past two decades, the chirality&#8208;induced spin selectivity (CISS) effect was reported in several experiments disclosing a unique connection between chirality and electron spin. Recent theoretical works highlighted time&#8208;resolved Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (trEPR) as a powerful tool to directly detect the spin polarization resulting from CISS.
Here, we report a first attempt to detect CISS at the molecular level by linking the pyrene electron donor to the fullerene acceptor with chiral peptide bridges of different lengths and electric dipole moment. The dyads are investigated by an array of techniques, including cyclic voltammetry, steady&#8208;state and transient optical spectroscopies, and trEPR. Despite the promising energy alignment of the electronic levels, our multi&#8208;technique analysis reveals no evidence of electron transfer (ET), highlighting the challenges of spectroscopic detection of CISS. However, the analysis allows the formulation of guidelines for the design of chiral organic model systems suitable to directly probe CISS&#8208;polarized ET.</dc:description>

         <title>The origin of delayed polymorphism in molecular crystals under mechanochemical conditions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We show that mechanochemically driven polymorphic transformations can require
extremely long induction periods, which can be tuned from hours to days by changing
ball milling energy. The robust design and interpretation of ball milling experiments
must account for this unexpected kinetics that arises from energetic phenomena unique
to the solid state. Detailed thermal analysis, combined with DFT simulations, indicates
that these marked induction periods are associated with processes of mechanical
activation. Correspondingly, we show that the pre&#8208;activation of reagents can also lead
to marked changes in the length of induction periods. Our findings demonstrate a new
dimension for exerting control over polymorphic transformations in organic crystals.
We expect mechanical activation to have a much broader implication across organic
solid&#8208;state mechanochemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>PI and PIII ions supported by BZIMPY ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report a class of compounds in which both PIII&#8208;X and PI forms featuring the same ligand are stable and readily cycled with each other. A series of PIII&#8208;X (X = Cl, Br, I) dicationic triflate salts supported by benzyl&#8208; and allyl&#8208;substituted 2,6&#8208;bis(benzimidazole&#8208;2&#8208;yl)pyridine (BZIMPY) ligands is synthesized. Surprisingly, treatment of these with R3PO (R = Et, Oct) results in reduction to BZIMPY&#8208;ligated PI monocationic triflate salts while treatment with Ph3P reduces but also substitutes the compound to produce Ph3P&#8208;BZIMPY&#8208;ligated PI dicationic triflate salts. The mechanisms of these surprising reductions are probed experimentally and rationalized computationally. The PIII&#8208;X dications are shown to be strong Lewis acids both experimentally and computationally and to readily behave as X+, PX, and P+ transfer agents in reactions with phosphines, NHCs, and diazabutadienes. The PI mono&#8208; and dications are shown to be very effective P+ transfer agents when treated similarly. Oxidation from a monocationic PI salt back to the dicationic PIII&#8208;X (X = Cl, Br) salt was achieved by treatment with N&#8208;chlorosuccinimide (NCS) or N&#8208;bromosuccinimide (NBS). Full characterization is reported using multinuclear nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, elemental analysis, and single crystal X&#8208;ray diffractometry where suitable crystals were isolated.</dc:description>

         <title>The First Planar, Not Twisted, Distannene &#8211; A Structural Alkene Analog. Synthesis, Isolation and X&#8208;ray Crystallography Characterization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The tetrasilyl&#8208;substituted distannene, (tBu2HSi)2Sn=Sn(SiHtBu2)2 6, was synthesized by mild thermolysis (70&#176;C in hexane) of tris(di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;hydridosilyl)stannane 4. The X&#8208;ray crystallography structure of 6 reveals the following unusual structural properties: a planar geometry around both Sn atoms (&#931;&#8737;Sn = 359.87&#176;), a non&#8208;twisted Sn=Sn double bond, and the shortest Sn=Sn double bond of 2.599 &#197; among all acyclic distannenes. Thus, compound 6 is the first reported distannene having a structure closely analogous to a classic alkene. Reactions of 6 with CCl4 or with 2,3&#8208;dimethylbuta&#8208;1,3&#8208;diene to produce 1,2&#8208;dichlorodistannane 9 and the [2+4] cycloadduct 10, respectively, are characteristic for a Sn=Sn double bond.</dc:description>

         <title>NIR Light&#8208;activated and RGD&#8208;conjugated Ultrasmall Fe/PPy Nanopolymers for Enhanced Tumor Photothermal Ferrotherapy and MR Imaging</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Iron&#8208;based nanomaterials have shown great promise for tumor ferrotherapy in recent years. However, nanoparticle&#8208;induced ferroptosis has low therapeutic efficacy owing to unsatisfactory Fenton reaction activity in a typical tumor microenvironment. We herein developed NIR light&#8208;activated Fe/PPy&#8208;RGD nanopolymers to combine photothermal therapy and ferrotherapy and achieve enhanced antitumor activity. Importantly, Fe/PPy&#8208;RGD exhibited excellent therapeutic performance under NIR light activation both&#160;in vitro&#160;and in vivo. Under irradiation with NIR light, the heat generated by Fe/PPy&#8208;RGD not only induced a therapeutic photothermal effect but also&#160;enhanced&#160;the release of iron ions and&#160;the Fenton reaction by inducing ferroptosis. Additionally, by virtue of RGD conjugation and its ultrasmall size, Fe/PPy&#8208;RGD could effectively accumulate at tumor sites in living mice after systemic administration and could be monitored via MR imaging. Hence, this study provides a promising approach for integrating ferrotherapy with photothermal therapy to achieve enhanced tumor treatment.</dc:description>

         <title>Biochar&#8208;Derived Hierarchical Porous Carbon as Tellurium Host for High&#8208;Performance Potassium&#8208;Tellurium Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Potassium ion battery is promising for its high abundance and low redox potential. As a conversion cathode, Te possesses high conductivity and theoretical volumetric capacity to couple with potassium. The stubborn issues of K&#8208;Te battery focus on the large volume change and rapid structure degradation of Te. Herein, we produce biomass carbon from mangosteen shell in a facile method, and obtain a hierarchical porous host with abundance of micropores and mesopores, which is beneficial for hosting Te during K+ storage in K&#8208;Te battery obviously. The specific capacity reach to 560 mAh g&#8208;1 in the initial cycle at 0.1 A g&#8208;1, and remained 83.8% after 200 cycles. Impressively, at a high current density of 2.0 A g&#8208;1, the specific capacity still remained 62.6% after 5000 cycle. These results endow such strategy an efficient way for the development of K&#8208;Te batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrochemical Exfoliation of Graphene Oxide: Unveiling Structural Properties and Electrochemical Performance</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An electrochemical exfoliation method for the production of graphene oxide and its characterization by electrochemical techniques are presented here. Graphite rods are used as working electrode in a three&#8208;electrode electrochemical cell, and electro&#8208;exfoliation is achieved by applying anodic polarization in a sulfuric acid solution. The electrochemical process involved two steps characterized by an intercalation at lower potential and an exfoliation at higher potential. The electrochemical behavior of the produced GO is studied through cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). X ray Photoelectronic Spectroscopy (XPS), Raman spectroscopy, Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM), and Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) are employed to characterize the structural and chemical properties of the synthesized GO. The results demonstrate that the electrochemical exfoliation method yieldsd GO materials with varying degrees of oxidation, defect density, and crystallite size, depending on the applied potential and acid concentration. The graphene oxide samples exhibite distinct electrochemical properties, including charge transfer resistance, interfacial capacitance, and relaxation times for the charge transfer, as revealed by CV and EIS measurements with a specifically selected redox probe. The comprehensive characterization provides valuable insights into the structure&#8208;property relationships of the GO materials synthesized through electrochemical exfoliation of graphite</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Elemental white phosphorous (P4) is a crucial feedstock for the entire phosphorus&#8208;derived chemical industry, serving as a common precursor for the ultimate preparation of high&#8208;grade monophosphorus (P1) fine chemicals. Whereas the corresponding manufacturing processes generally suffer from a deep reliance on hazardous reagents, inputs of immense energy, emissions of toxic pollutants, and the generation of substantial waste, which in turn contributes to negative impacts on the environment. In this context, sustainability and safety concerns maintain a consistent impetus for the urgent overall improvement of phosphorus cycles. &#160;In this Concept, we present an overview of the most recent growth in photo&#8208; and electrochemical synthesis of P1&#160;organo&#8208;compounds from P4&#160;with special emphasis on sustainable features.&#160;The key aspects of innovations regarding activation mode and mechanism have been compressively analyzed.

         <dc:description>We report the absorption spectra and photophysical properties of homo and hetero&#8208;aggregate assemblies of a strongly emissive N&#8208;annulated perylene dye (P) and of a dyad made of P and a methyl viologen derivative (P&#8208;MV), in ethanol&#8208;water solutions. In homo&#8208;aggregate assemblies of P, the strong &#960;&#8722;&#960;* fluorescence of the isolated chromophore is replaced by an excimer emission at lower energy, with a lifetime of 900 ps, due to excimer formation from the initially prepared excitons. In homo&#8208;aggregate assemblies of P&#8208;MV, photoinduced charge separation, with formation of P+&#8208;MV&#8208; species, occurs in 3 ps and with a charge recombination of 20 ps, close to the time constants of the same processes exhibited by P&#8208;MV isolated dyad in acetonitrile or ethanol solution. In mixed hetero&#8208;aggregate P/P&#8208;MV systems, the light energy absorbed by the P components is suggested to delocalizes (by exciton formation) over various P subunits, and when a P&#8208;MV unit is reached, charge separation occurs; however, excimer emission is still present, particularly for P/P&#8208;MV ratio larger than 3:1, indicating that delocalized excitons within the hetero&#8208;aggregate systems extend over a limited, small number of P chromophores.</dc:description>

         <title>Utilizing Nanozymatic Activity of Copper&#8208;Functionlized Mesoporous C3N5 for Sensing of Biomolecules</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Designing unique nanomaterials for the selective sensing of biomolecules is of significant interest in the field of nanobiotechnology. In this work, we demonstrated the synthesis of ordered and Cu nanoparticles functionalized mesoporous C3N5 with unique peroxidase like nanozymatic activity for the ultrasensitive and selective detection of glucose and glutathione.&#160; A nano hard&#8208;templating technique together with the in&#8208;situ polymerization and self&#8208;assembly of Cu and high N&#8208;containing CN precursor was adopted to introduce mesoporosity as well as high N and Cu content in mesoporous C3N5. Due to the ordered structure and highly dispersed Cu in the mesoporous C3N5, a large enhancement of the peroxidase mimetic activity in the oxidation of a redox dye in the presence of hydrogen peroxide could be obtained.&#160; Additionally, the optimized Cu functionalized mesoporous C3N5 exhibited excellent sensitivity to glutathione with a low detection limit of 2.0 ppm. The strong peroxidase activity of the Cu functionalized mesoporous C3N5 was also effectively used for the sensing of glucose with the detection limit of 0.4 mM through glucose oxidation with glucose oxidase. This unique Cu functionalized mesoporous C3N5 has the potential for detecting various molecules in the environment as well as for next&#8208;generation glucose and glutathione diagnostic devices.</dc:description>

         <title>Fate of Oxidation States at Actinide Centers in Redox&#8208;Active Ligand Systems Governed by Energy Levels of 5f Orbitals</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report the formation of a NpIV complex from the complexation of NpVIO22+ with the redox&#8208;active ligand tBu&#8208;pdiop2&#8722; = 2,6&#8208;bis[N&#8208;(3,5&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;2&#8208;hydroxyphenyl)iminomethyl]pyridine. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first example of the direct complexation&#8208;induced chemical reduction of NpVIO22+ to NpIV. In contrast, the complexation of UVIO22+ with tBu&#8208;pdiop2&#8722; did not induce the reduction of UVIO22+, not even after the two&#8208;electron electrochemical reduction of [UVIO2(tBu&#8208;pdiop)]. This contrast between the Np and U systems may be ascribed to the decrease of the energy of the 5f orbitals in Np compared to those in U. The present findings indicate that the redox chemistry between UVIO22+ and NpVIO22+ should be clearly differentiated in redox&#8208;active ligand systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Biasing the Formation of Solution&#8208;Unstable Intermediates in Coordination Self&#8208;Assembly by Mechanochemistry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Due to the reversible nature of coordination bonds and solvation effect, coordination self&#8208;assembly pathways are often difficult to elucidate experimentally in solution, as intermediates and products are in constant equilibration. Herein, we showed that some of these transient and high&#8208;energy self&#8208;assembly intermediates can be accessed by means of ball&#8208;milling approaches. Among them, highly aqueous&#8208;unstable Pd3L11 and Pd6L14 open&#8208;cage intermediates of the framed Fujita Pd6L14 cage and Pd2L22, Pd3L21 and Pd4L22 intermediates of Mukherjee Pd6L24 capsule are successfully trapped in solid&#8208;state, where L1 = 2,4,6&#8208;tris(4&#8208;pyridyl)&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triazine and L2 = 1,3,5&#8208;tris(1&#8208;imidazolyl)benzene). Their structures are assigned by a combination of solution&#8208;based characterization tools such as standard NMR spectroscopy, DOSY NMR, ESI&#8208;MS and X&#8208;ray diffraction. Collectively, our result highlights the opportunity of using mechanochemistry to access unique chemical space with vastly different reactivity compared to conventional solution&#8208;based supramolecular self&#8208;assembly reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Quantitative Assessment of Crystallinity and Stability in &#946;&#8208;Ketoenamine&#8208;Based Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The design and synthesis of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with high chemical stability pose significant challenges for practical applications. Although a growing number of robust COFs have been developed and employed for a broad scope of applications, the assessment of COF stability has primarily relied on qualitative descriptions, lacking a rational and quantitative assessment. Herein, we for the first time present a novel assessment method that enables visual and quantitative depiction of COF stability. By analyzing the PXRD patterns of chemically stable &#946;&#8208;ketoenamine&#8208;based COFs (KEA&#8208;COFs), we establish two crystallinity&#8208;dependent parameters, the relative intensity (I2&#952;rel) and the relative area (A2&#952;rel) of the main peak (2&#952;), which are expected to establish a standardized criterion for assessing COF crystallinity. Based on these parameters, the crystalline changes after stability tests can be visually presented, which provides a rational and quantitative assessment of their stability. This study not only demonstrates the remarkable chemical stability of KEA&#8208;COFs, but also provides valuable insights into the quantitative evaluation of COFs&#8217;crystallinity and stability.</dc:description>

         <title>2D Covalent Organic Frameworks with Kagome lattice: Synthesis and Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>2D covalent organic frameworks with kagome (kgm) topology are a promising class of crystalline frameworks that possess both triangular micropores and hexagonal mesopores. These dual&#8208;pore structures enable kgm COFs to exhibit unique advantages in selective separation, mass transfer, and targeted drug release. However, the synthesis of 2D kgm COFs has been hindered by the reliance on empirical methods. In this review, we systematically summarize the conventional macrocycle&#8208;to&#8208;framework strategy, typical [4+2] co&#8208;polymerization synthetic strategy, and bifunctional molecules self&#8208;condensation approach for constructing 2D kgm COFs. We also survey the factors influencing formation of kgm lattice such as monomer type, solvent polarity, substrate concentration, etc., and highlight the representative examples on targeted synthesis. Additionally, we summarize the applications of 2D kgm COFs and the relationships between structure and performances. Finally, we propose key fundamental perspectives to accelerate the further development of this intriguing material.</dc:description>

         <title>Nickel Phosphonate MOF Derived N&#8208;doped Carbon&#8208;coated Phosphorus&#8208;vacancies&#8208;rich Ni2P Particles as Efficient Bifunctional Oxygen Electrocatalyst</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The design of non&#8208;noble metal bifunctional electrocatalysts with outstanding performance and remarkable stability for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is the most essential issue to the realization of rechargeable zinc&#8208;air battery and transition metal phosphides (TMPs) have emerged as robust candidates for oxygen electrocatalysts. Herein, N&#8208;doped carbon&#8208;coated phosphorus&#8208;vacancies&#8208;rich Ni2P particles (Vp&#8208;Ni2P@NC) is proposed via simple carbonization and following Ar plasma treatment from a single nickel phosphonate metal organic framework (MOF) without extra phosphine and nitrogen sources. The facile and rapid plasma treatment can achieve phosphorus vacancies which could modulate the electronic structure to enhance the inherent active and electrical conductivity.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The design of non-noble metal bifunctional electrocatalysts with outstanding performance and remarkable stability for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is the most essential issue to the realization of rechargeable zinc-air battery and transition metal phosphides (TMPs) have emerged as robust candidates for oxygen electrocatalysts. Herein, N-doped carbon-coated phosphorus-vacancies-rich Ni2P particles (Vp-Ni2P@NC) is proposed via simple carbonization and following Ar plasma treatment from a single nickel phosphonate metal organic framework (MOF) without extra phosphine and nitrogen sources. The facile and rapid plasma treatment can achieve phosphorus vacancies which could modulate the electronic structure to enhance the inherent active and electrical conductivity. Meanwhile, the pyridine-N and graphitized-N produced during calcination also could provide more active sites and increase the electrical conductivity.

         <title>Enabling Stereochemical Communication and Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Chiroptical Properties in Biphenyl&#8208;Capped Cyclodextrins</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chiroptical materials are gaining increasing interest due to their innovative character and their applications in optoelectronics and data encryption technologies. Fully harnessing the potential of building blocks from the &#8220;chiral pool&#8221; such as, for example, native cyclodextrins (CDs), as they often lack chromophores suitable for the construction of materials with significant chiroptical properties. Here, we present the synthesis and characterization of a two&#8208;level molecular stack consisting of a point&#8208;chiral element (CD) and an axially chiral element (biphenyl), capable of effectively translating the overall stereochemical information contained in CDs into stimuli&#8208;responsive chiroptical properties. &#945;&#8208; and &#946;&#8208;Permethylated CDs were efficiently capped with two different 2,2&#8217;&#8208;difunctionalized 1,1'&#8208;biphenyl units. In CD derivatives containing the rigid 2,2'&#8208;dihydroxy&#8208;1,1'&#8208;biphenyl cap, two intramolecular hydrogen bonds act synergistically as stereoselective actuators, enabling effective communication between the two levels and the transfer of non&#8208;chromophoric stereochemical information from the cyclooligosaccharide to the atropoisomeric cap. The chiroptical properties can be finely tuned by external stimuli such as temperature and solvent. The way chirality is transferred from the CD platform to the biphenyl cap was revealed thanks to crystallographic and computational analyses, together with electronic circular dichroism (ECD) studies.</dc:description>
