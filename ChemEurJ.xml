      <title>Pnictogen&#8208;Bonding Catalysis: An Interactive Tool to Uncover Unorthodox Mechanisms in Polyether Cascade Cyclizations</title>
      <dc:description>
One of the hidden enigmas of natural&#8208;product inspired epoxide&#8208;opening polyether cascade cyclizations is the inversion of configuration from trans epoxides to cis&#8208;fused endo products. Here, pnictogen&#8208;bonding catalysis is introduced as an interactive tool to find the answer with an unorthodox mechanism centered around an acyclic, achiral hydroxy&#8208;5&#8208;enal intermediate, produced by C&#8722;C bond cleavage, then cyclized by stereoselective C&#8722;C bond formation.







Abstract
Pnictogen&#8208;bonding catalysis and supramolecular &#963;&#8208;hole catalysis in general is currently being introduced as the non&#8208;covalent counterpart of covalent Lewis acid catalysis. With access to anti&#8208;Baldwin cyclizations identified as unique characteristic, pnictogen&#8208;bonding catalysis appeared promising to elucidate one of the hidden enigmas of brevetoxin&#8208;type epoxide opening polyether cascade cyclizations, that is the cyclization of certain trans epoxides into cis&#8208;fused rings. In principle, a shift from SN2&#8208; to SN1&#8208;type mechanisms could suffice to rationalize this inversion of configuration. However, the same inversion could be explained by a completely different mechanism: Ring opening with C&#8722;C bond cleavage into a branched hydroxy&#8208;5&#8208;enal and the corresponding cyclic hemiacetal, followed by cascade cyclization under conformational control, including stereoselective C&#8722;C bond formation. In this report, a pnictogen&#8208;bonding supramolecular SbV catalyst is used to demonstrate that this unorthodox polyether cascade cyclization mechanism occurs.

      <title>Photoactive nickel complexes in cross coupling catalysis</title>
      <dc:description>Transition metal catalyzed cross coupling reactions are important in chemical synthesis for the formation of C&#8208;C and C&#8208;heteroatom bonds. Suitable catalysts are frequently based on palladium or nickel, and lately the cheaper and more abundant first&#8208;row transition metal element has been much in focus. The combination of nickel catalysis with photoredox chemistry has opened new synthetic possibilities, and in some cases electronically excited states of nickel complexes play a key role. This is a remarkable finding, because photo&#8208;excited metal complexes are underexplored in the context of organic bond&#8208;forming reactions, and because the photophysics and the photochemistry of first&#8208;row transition metal complexes are underdeveloped in comparison to their precious metal&#8208;based congeners. Consequently, there is much potential for innovation at the interface of synthetic&#8208;organic and physical&#8208;inorganic chemistry. This minireview highlights recent key findings in light&#8208;driven nickel catalysis and identifies essential concepts for the exploitation of photoactive nickel complexes in organic synthesis.</dc:description>

      <title>Synthetic processes towards nitriles without cyanide: A biocatalytic concept based on dehydration of aldoximes in water</title>
      <dc:description>While belonging to the most fundamental functional groups, nitriles represent a class of compound still raising challenges in terms of an efficient, cost&#8208;effective and at the same time sustainable way for their synthesis. Complementing existing chemical routes recently a cyanide&#8208;free enzymatic process technology based on the use of an aldoxime dehydratase (Oxd) as biocatalyst component has been developed and successfully applied for a range of nitrile products. In these biotransformations, these Oxd enzymes catalyze the dehydration of aldoximes as readily available substrates to the desired nitrile products. Within this concept article these developments with such enzymes are summarized with a strong focus on the synthetic application side. By means of the achieved synthetic examples, it will be demonstrated that this biocatalytic technology has the potential to &#8220;cross the bridge&#8221; between the production of fine chemicals and pharmaceuticals on the one hand and bulk and commodity chemicals on the other hand. For example, Oxd enzymes were found to give high enantioselectivities and can give access to both enantiomers when starting either from the (  E  )&#8208; or (  Z  )&#8208;aldoxime racemate. However, besides their high potential towards stereoselective synthesis making the attractive for the area of fine chemicals and pharmaceuticals, Oxd enzymes also turned out to suitable for the dehydration of a range of aldoximes derived from aliphatic achiral commodity chemicals, leading to the corresponding nitriles, e.g., adiponitrile and fatty nitriles, with high substrate loading up to the Kg per L range as a required criteria for the field of bulk chemicals production.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>External stimuli are potent tools that Nature uses to control protein function and activity. For instance, during viral entry and exit, pH variations are known to trigger large protein conformational changes. In Nature, also the electron transfer (ET) properties of ET proteins are influenced by pH&#8208;induced conformational changes. In this work, a pH&#8208;controlled, reversible 3  10  &#8208;helix to &#945;&#8208;helix conversion (from acidic to highly basic pH values and  vice versa  ) of a peptide supramolecular system built on a gold surface is described. The effect of pH on the ability of the peptide SAM to generate a photocurrent was investigated, with particular focus on the effect of the pH&#8208;induced conformational change on photocurrent efficiency. The films were characterized by electrochemical and spectroscopic techniques, and were found to be very stable over time, also in contact with a solution.

Catalyst in a shell: This concept article describes state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art core&#8211;shell materials employed as heterogeneous catalysts for a range of sustainable catalytic transformations, focusing on the advantages that this intriguing class of catalysts brings to the field.







Abstract
In recent years, core&#8211;shell nano&#8208;catalysts have received increasing attention due to their tunable properties and broad applications in catalysis. Control of the two components of these materials allows their catalytic properties to be tuned to various sustainable processes in synthetic and energy&#8208;related applications. This Concept article describes recent state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art core&#8211;shell materials and their application as heterogeneous catalysts for a range of sustainable catalytic transformations, focusing on two important classes of renewable substrates, CO2 and biomass. In the discussion, emphasis is directed to the role of the constituent parts of the core&#8211;shell structure and how they can be manipulated to enhance activity.

      <title>Total Synthesis of a Partial Structure from Arabinogalactan and Its Application for Allergy Prevention</title>
      <dc:description>
Growing up in an alpine farming environment with frequent contact to cowsheds is protective against allergic diseases. Arabinogalactan from this environment is one of the protective compounds. The source of this polysaccharide was traced back to grasses such as Alopecurus pratensis. This study shows that the total synthesis of arabinose and galactose containing partial structures from such arabinogalactan is possible. After coupling of these pentasaccharides to a carrier protein, the glycoconjugates protect against allergic response in a mouse model asthma. More information can be found in the Communication by T. Opatz, M. Peters, et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202002287).

     alt="Total Synthesis of a Partial Structure from Arabinogalactan and Its Application for Allergy Prevention"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Growing up in an alpine farming environment&lt;/b&gt; with frequent contact to cowsheds is protective against allergic diseases. Arabinogalactan from this environment is one of the protective compounds. The source of this polysaccharide was traced back to grasses such as &lt;i&gt;Alopecurus pratensis&lt;/i&gt;. This study shows that the total synthesis of arabinose and galactose containing partial structures from such arabinogalactan is possible. After coupling of these pentasaccharides to a carrier protein, the glycoconjugates protect against allergic response in a mouse model asthma. More information can be found in the Communication by T. Opatz, M. Peters, et&#8197;al. (DOI: &lt;a&gt;https://doi.org/10.1002/chem.20200228710.1002/chem.202002287&lt;/a&gt;).

      <title>One&#8208;Photon Excitation Followed by a Three&#8208;Step Sequential Energy&#8208;Energy&#8208;Electron Transfer Leading To a&#160;Charge Separation in Supramolecular Tetrad Benzothiazole&#8208;Boron Dipyrromethene&#8208;Zinc Porphyrin&#8208;C60</title>
      <dc:description>A panchromatic triad, consisting of benzothiazole (BTZ), boron dipyrromethene (BODIPY) moieties covalently linked to zinc porphyrin (ZnP) core is reported. Absorption and electrochemical studies of BTZ&#8208;BODIPY&#8208;ZnP revealed characteristic peaks corresponding to individual chromophores. Selective excitation of BTZ moiety resulted in the fluorescence quenching, due to PEnT from 1BTZ* to BODIPY moiety, followed by the quenching of the BODIPY emission due to sequential PEnT from 1BODIPY* moiety to ZnP. Further, supramolecular tetrad was formed by axially coordinating triad with ImC60, and the parallel steady&#8208;state measurements revealed diminished ZnP emission indicating the occurrence of PET from 1ZnP* to ImC60. Finally, femtosecond transient absorption studies provided evidence for the sequential occurrence of PEnT and PET events, viz., 1BTZ*&#8208;BODIPY&#8208;ZnP:ImC60 &#224; BTZ&#8208;1BODIPY*&#8208;ZnP:ImC60 &#224; BTZ&#8208;BODIPY&#8208;1ZnP*:ImC60 &#224; BTZ&#8208;BODIPY&#8208;ZnP+&#9642;:ImC60&#8722;&#9642; in the supramolecular tetrad. The evaluated rate of energy transfer, kEnT was found to be 3&#8208;5 &#215; 1010 s&#8208;1, slightly faster than that observed in the case of BODIPY&#8208;ZnP and BTZ&#8208;BODIPY&#8208;ZnP lacking the coordinated ImC60. The rate constants for charge separation and recombination, kCS and kCR, calculated by monitoring the rise and decay of the C60&#8722;&#9642; were found to be 5.5 &#215; 1010 s&#8208;1 and 4.4 &#215; 108 s&#8208;1 for BODIPY&#8208;ZnP:ImC60 triad, and 3.1 &#215; 1010 s&#8208;1 and 4.9 &#215; 108 s&#8208;1 for BTZ&#8208;BODIPY&#8208;ZnP:ImC60 tetrad. Initial excitation of tetrad promoting two&#8208;step energy transfer and a final electron transfer event has been successfully demonstrated in the present study.</dc:description>

      <title>Completing the Redox&#8208;Series of Silicon Trisdioxolene: ortho&#8208;Quinone and Lewis Superacid Make a Powerful Redox Catalyst</title>
      <dc:description>Quinones are mild oxidants, whose redox potentials can be increased by supramolecular interactions. Whereas this goal has been achieved by hydrogen bonding or molecular encapsulation, a Lewis acid&#8208;binding strategy for redox amplification of quinones is unexplored.

By isolating the single&#8208;electron reduced product of 1, the anionic monoradical 1&#9679;&#8208;, we complete the redox&#8208;series of a century&#8208;old class of compounds. Cyclic voltammetry measurements reveal that the redox potential in 1 is shifted by more than 1 V into the anodic direction compared to QCl, reaching that of "magic blue" or NO+. It allows oxidation of challenging substrates such as aromatic hydrocarbons and can be applied as an efficient redox catalyst.

      <title>Plasma&#8208;induced defects enhance the visible&#8208;light photocatalytic activity of MIL&#8208;125(Ti)&#8208;NH2 for overall water splitting</title>
      <dc:description>Defect engineering in metal&#8208;organic frameworks is commonly performed by using thermal or chemical treatments. Herein, it is reported that oxygen plasma treatment generates structural defects on MIL&#8208;125(Ti)&#8208;NH  2  leading to an increase of its photocatalytic activity. Characterization data indicates that plasma&#8208;treated materials retain most of their initial crystallinity, while exhibiting somewhat lower surface area and pore volume. XPS and FT&#8208;IR spectroscopy reveal that oxygen plasma induces MIL&#8208;125(Ti)&#8208;NH  2  partial terephthalate decarboxylation and an increase of the Ti&#8208;OH population. Thermogravimetric analyses confirm the generation of structural defects by oxygen plasma and allowed an estimation of the resulting experimental formula of the treated MIL&#8208;125(Ti)&#8208;NH  2  solids. SEM analyses show that the oxygen plasma treatment of MIL&#8208;125(Ti)&#8208;NH  2  gradually decreases its particle size. Importantly, diffuse reflectance UV&#8208;Vis spectroscopy and valence band measurements demonstrate that oxygen&#8208;plasma treatment alters MIL&#8208;125(Ti)&#8208;NH  2  band gap and, more significantly, the alignment of highest occupy and lowest unoccupied crystal orbitals. An optimal oxygen plasma treatment to achieve the highest efficiency in water splitting with or without methanol as sacrificial electron donor under UV&#8208;Vis or simulated sunlight was determined. The optimized plasma&#8208;treated MIL&#8208;125(Ti)&#8208;NH  2  photocatalyst acts as truly heterogeneous photocatalysts and retains most of its initial photoactivity and crystallinity upon reuse.</dc:description>

G&#8208;II initiates glycoproteins&#8217; entry and exit from the cycle, and UGGT serves as the &#8220;folding sensor&#8221;.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Glycine&#8208;Functionalized CsPbBr3 Nanocrystals for Efficient Visible&#8208;Light Photocatalysis of CO2 Reduction</title>
      <dc:description>Capping ligands are indispensable for the preparation of metal&#8208;halide&#8208;perovskite (MHP) nanocrystals (NCs) with good stability; however, the long alkyl&#8208;chain capping ligands in conventional MHP NCs will be unfavourable for the CO2 adsorption and hinder the efficient carrier separation on the surface of MHP NCs, leading to inferior catalytic activity in artificial photosynthesis. Herein, we construct CsPbBr3 nanocrystals with short&#8208;chain glycine as ligand based on a facile ligand&#8208;exchange strategy. Owing to the reduced hindrance of glycine and the presence of amine group in glycine, the photogenerated carrier separation and CO2 uptake capacity can be noticeably improved without compromising stability of MHP NCs. CsPbBr3 nanocrystals with glycine ligands exhibit significantly increased yield of 27.7 &#956;mol g&#8210;1 h&#8210;1 for photocatalytic CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion without any organic sacrificial reagents, which is over 5 times higher than that of control CsPbBr3 NCs with conventional long alkyl&#8208;chain capping ligands.</dc:description>

      <title>Assessing the key photophysical properties of triangulenium dyes for DNA binding by alteration of the fluorescent core</title>
      <dc:description>Four&#8208;stranded G&#8208;quadruplex (G4) DNA is a non&#8208;canonical DNA topology that has been proposed to form in cells and play key roles in how the genome is read and used by the cellular machinery. Previously, a fluorescent triangulenium probe (DAOTA&#8208;M2) was used to visualise G4s in cellulo, thanks to its distinct fluorescence lifetimes when bound to different DNA topologies. Herein, we expand the library of available triangulenium probes to explore how modifications to the fluorescent core of the molecule affect its photophysical characteristics, interaction with DNA and cellular localisation. The benzo&#8208;bridged and isopropyl&#8208;bridged diazatriangulenium dyes, BDATA&#8208;M2 and CDATA&#8208;M2 respectively, featuring ethyl&#8208;morpholino substituents, were synthesised and characterised. The interactions of these molecules with different DNA topologies were studied to determine their binding affinity, fluorescence enhancement and fluorescence lifetime response. Finally, the cellular uptake and localisation of these optical probes were investigated. Whilst structural modifications to the triangulenium core only slightly alter the binding affinity to DNA, BDATA&#8208;M2 and CDATA&#8208;M2 cannot distinguish between DNA topologies through their fluorescence lifetime. This work presents valuable new evidence into the critical role of PET quenching when using the fluorescence lifetime of triangulenium dyes to discriminate G4 DNA from duplex DNA, highlighting the importance of fine tuning redox and spectral properties when developing new triangulenium&#8208;based G4 probes.</dc:description>

      <title>Synthesis and coordination ability of a donor&#8208;stabilised bis&#8208;phosphinidene</title>
      <dc:description>Chelating phosphines have long been a mainstay as efficient directing ligands in transition&#8208;metal catalysis. Low&#8208;valent derivatives, namely chelating phosphinidenes, are to date unknown, and could lead to chelating complexes containing more than one metal centre due to the intrisic capacity of phosphinidenes to bind two metal fragments at one P&#8208;centre. Here we describe the synthesis of the first such chelating bis&#8208;phosphinidene ligand, XantP  2  (  2  ), generated by the reduction of a diphosphino xanthene derivative, Xant(PH  2  )  2  (  1  ) with  iPr  NHC (  iPr  NHC = [:C{N(Pr  i  )C(H)}  2  ]). Initial studies have shown that this novel chelating ligand can act as a bidentate ligand towards element dihalides (  i.e.  FeCl  2  , ZnI  2  , GeCl  2  , SnBr  2  ), forming cationic complexes with the tetryl elements. In contrast, XantP  2  demonstrates an ability to bind multiple metal centres in the reaction with CuCl, leading to a cationic Cu  3  P  3  ring complex, with Cu centres bridged by phosphinidene arms. Density Functional Theory calculations show that  2  indeed holds 4 lone pairs of electrons, shedding further light on the coordination capacity for this novel ligand class through observation of directionality and hybridisation of these electron pairs.</dc:description>

      <title>Planar Tetracoordinate Silicons in Organic Molecules As Carbenoid&#8208;Type Amphoteric Centers: A Computational Study</title>
      <dc:description>Designing and synthesizing a stable compound with a planar tetracoordinate silicon (ptSi) center is a challenging goal for chemists. Here, we theoretically designed and computationally verified a series of potential aromatic ptSi compounds composed of four conjugated rings shared by a centrally embedded Si atom. Both Born&#8208;Oppenheimer molecular dynamics (BOMD) simulations and computations of decomposition pathways indicate the high stability and likely existence of these compounds particularly Si&#8208;5555 (SiN  4  C  8  H  8  ) with 16 &#960; electrons under normal temperature and pressure. Notably, the H&#252;ckel aromaticity rule which works well for single rings seems inconsistent with the high stability of Si&#8208;5555 where the 16 &#960; electrons are spread over four rings fused together. Bonding analyses show that the strong electron donation from the peripheral conjugated ring of 16 &#960; electrons to the vacant central atomic orbital Si 3p  z  leads to the stabilization for both the ptSi coordination and planar aromaticity. The partial occupation of Si 3p  z  results in the peculiar  carbenoid&#8208;type  behaviors of the amphoteric center. By modulating the electron density on the ring with substituent groups, we can regulate the nucleophilic and electrophilic properties of the central Si.</dc:description>

      <title>Rational design and controlled synthesis of V doped Ni3S2/NixPy heterostructure nanosheets for hydrogen evolution reaction</title>
      <dc:description>Rational construction of high&#8208;efficient and low&#8208;cost catalyst is one of the most promising ways to produce liberally hydrogen but almost remains a huge dare. Hence, a novel work by the interface engineering and hetero&#8208;atom doping to synthesize V doped sulfide/phosphide heterostructure grown on nickel foam (V&#8208;Ni  3  S  2  /Ni  x  P  y  /NF) is proposed via a phosphating treatment at low temperature.

Meanwhile, the excellent conductivity of NF and the abundant interstices between nanosheets have a positive effort for HER. As a result, the V&#8208;Ni  3  S  2  /Ni  x  P  y  /NF (VNSP/NF) nanosheets catalyst exhibits the outstanding HER activity with an extremely low overpotential of 90 mV at the current density of 10 mA cm  &#8722;2  for HER and stable durability in alkaline solution, which exceeds most of the previously reported about Ni&#8208;based materials.

      <title>Crystal structure of urotropine under high pressure and non&#8208;hydrostatic stress&#8208;induced phase transitions in cage compounds</title>
      <dc:description>High&#8208;pressure behavior of hexamethylenetetramine (urotropine) was studied  in situ  using angle&#8208;dispersive single&#8208;crystal synchrotron X&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD) and Fourier transform infrared absorption (FTIR) spectroscopy. Experiments were conducted in various pressure transmitting media to study the effect of deviatoric stress on phase transformations. Up to 4 GPa significant damping of molecular librations and atomic thermal motion was observed. A first&#8208;order phase transition to a tetragonal structure was observed with an onset at ~12.5 GPa which is characterized by sluggish kinetics and considerable hysteresis upon decompression. However, it occurs only in non&#8208;hydrostatic conditions, induced by deviatoric or uniaxial stress in the sample. This behavior finds analogies in similar cubic crystals built of highly symmetric cage&#8208;like molecules and may be considered a common feature of such systems. DFT computations were performed to model urotropine equation of state and pressure dependence of vibrational modes. The first successful Hirshfeld atom refinements carried out for high&#8208;pressure diffraction data are reported. The refinements yielded more realistic C&#8722;H bond lengths than the independent atom model despite the high&#8208;pressure diffraction data are incomplete.</dc:description>

      <title>Aromaticity Survival in Hydrofullerenes: The Case of C66H4 with its &#960;&#8208;Aromatic Circuits</title>
      <dc:description>The isolated&#8208;pentagon rule (IPR) is a determining structural feature accounting for hollow fullerene stabilization and properties related to Cn (n &#8805; 60) cages. The recent characterization of an unprecedented non&#8208;IPR hydrofullerene, C2v&#8208;C66H4, bearing two heptagons with adjacent fused&#8208;pentagons motif, largely dismiss this feature. Herein, employing DFT calculations, we explore the 13C&#8208;NMR pattern and aromatic behavior of C2v&#8208;C66H4. Our results show the presence of three &#960;&#8208;aromatic circuits at the bottom boat section of C66H4 indicating the unique features of this hydrofullerene in comparison to pristine C60. In addition, under specific orientations of the external field, certain &#960;&#8208;aromatic circuits are enabled, resulting in a more aromatic fullerene than C60, but lower in comparison to the spherical aromatic C606&#8208; fulleride. Noteworthy, under a field&#8208;aligned along with the saturated carbon atoms, non&#8208;aromatic characteristics are exposed. This reveals that spherical&#8208;like cages can involve a complex magnetic response that heavily depends on the orientation of the applied field.</dc:description>

      <title>Strong Equatorial Crystal Field Enhances the Axial Anisotropy and Energy Barrier for Spin Reversal Process in Yb2 SMMs</title>
      <dc:description>The importance of equatorial crystal fields on magnetic anisotropy of ytterbium SMMs is observed for the first time. Herein, we report three similar dinuclear ytterbium complexes of formula [Yb  2  (3&#8208;OMe&#8208;L)  2  (DMF)  2  (NO  3  )  2  ]&#183;DMF (  1  ), [Yb  2  (3&#8208;H&#8208;L)  2  (DMF)  2  (NO  3  )  2  ]&#183;DMF&#183;H  2  O (  2  ) and [Yb  2  (3&#8208;NO  3  &#8208;L)  2  (DMF)  2  (NO  3  )  2  ] (  3  ), [where 3&#8208;X&#8208;H  2  L= N'&#8208;(2&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;3&#8208;X&#8208;benzylidene)picolinohydrazide, X = OMe(  1  ), H(  2  ) NO  2  (  3  )]. The detailed magnetic measurements display the presence of weak antiferromagnetic interaction between the Yb centers and field induced slow relaxation of magnetization in all the complexes. The higher energy barrier for spin reversal was observed for complex  1  (U  eff  = 50 K) and it dercreases in the order of  2  (47 K) to  3  (40 K). Notably, complex  1  shows a remarkable energy barrier with in the frequency range of 1&#8208;850 Hz reported for Yb&#8208;based single molecule magnets (SMMs). Further, the ab initio calculations show the higher axial anisotropy and lower QTM (quantum tunneling of magnetization) in the ground state for  1  compared to  2  and  3  . It has also been observed that the presence of strong crystal field in the equatorial plane(when the &#8736;O1&#8208;Yb&#8208;O3 bond angle is close to 90&#186;) enhances the axial anisotropy and improve the SMM behavior in the studied complexes. Both the experimental and theoretical analysis of relaxation dynamics discloses that Raman and QTM play major role on slow relaxation process for all the complexes.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>In this work, a series of MOF&#8208;derived CoPd nanoalloys have been prepared. The nanocatalysts exhibited excellent activities in the hydrogenation of nitroarenes and alkenes in green solvent (ethanol/water) under mild conditions (H  2  balloon, room temperature). Using ZIF&#8208;67 as template for both carbon matrix and cobalt precursor coating with a mesoporous SiO  2  layer, the catalyst CoPd/NC@SiO  2  were smoothly constructed. Catalytic results revealed the synergistic effect between Co and Pd components in the hydrogenation process due to the enhanced electron density. Mesoporous SiO  2  shell effectively prevented the sintering of hollow carbon and metal NPs at high temperature, furnishing the well&#8208;dispersed nanoalloy catalysts and better catalytic performance. Moreover, the catalyst was durable and showed negligible activity decay in recycling and scale&#8208;up experiments, providing a mild and highly efficient way to access amines and arenes.</dc:description>

      <title>Enhancing magnetic communication between metal centres: the role of s&#8208;tetrazine based radicals as ligands</title>
      <dc:description>Although 1,2,4,5&#8208;tetrazines or  s  &#8208;tetrazines have been known in the literature for more than a century, their coordination chemistry has become increasingly popular in recent years due to their unique redox activity, multiple binding sites and their various applications. The electron&#8208;poor character of the ring and stabilization of the radical anion through all four nitrogen atoms in their metal complexes provide new aspects in molecular magnetism towards the synthesis of new high performing Single Molecule Magnets (SMMs). The scope of this review is to examine the role of  s  &#8208;tetrazine radical ligands in transition metal and lanthanide based SMMs and provide a critical overview of the progress thus far in this field. As well, general synthetic routes and new insights for the preparation of  s  &#8208;tetrazines are discussed, along with their redox activity and applications in various fields. Concluding remarks along with the limitations and perspectives of these ligands are discussed.</dc:description>

      <title>Circularly Polarized Luminescence of A Stereogenic Curved Paraphenylene Anchoring A Chiral Binaphthyl in Solution and Solid State</title>
      <dc:description>A curved stereogenic [6]paraphenylene ([6]PP), anchoring a chiral binaphthyl scaffold at 7,7&#8217;&#8208;positions, was prepared and investigated for its properties as a solid&#8208;state circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) dye.

The curved [6]PP exhibits fluorescence in powder and polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) film as well as solution. A significant increase in quantum yield was observed for a non&#8208;fluid PMMA film owing the suppression of the molecular motion. The  g  CPL  values of the dye in solution and as PMMA film were almost the same (4.3&#8211;4.4 x 10  &#8211;3  ) and lager than that in powder.

      <title>Gold(I) Complexation of the Phosphanoxy&#8208;Substituted Phosphaalkenes for the Activation&#8208;Free LAuCl Catalysis</title>
      <dc:description>The phosphanoxy&#8208;substituted phosphaalkene bearing the P=C&#8211;O&#8211;P skeleton can be prepared from diphosphene Mes*P=PMes* (Mes* = 2,4,6&#8208;  t  Bu  3  C  6  H  2  ), and the use for catalysis is of interest. In this paper, complexation of the phosphanoxy&#8208;substituted phosphaalkenes with gold are investigated, and the catalytic activity of the mono&#8208; and bis(chlorogold) complexes are subsequently evaluated. Reaction of the P=C&#8211;O&#8211;P compound with (tht)AuCl (tht = tetrahydrothiophene) showed dominant coordination on the sp  3  phosphorus, and complete coordination on the sp  2  phosphorus required removal of tetrahydrothiophene. Atoms&#8208;In&#8208;Molecules (AIM) analysis based on the X&#8208;ray structure of the chlorogold complex indicated pseudo coordinating interaction between the gold centre and the P=C unit. The bis(chlorogold) complexes indicated the conformational isomerism, and catalyzed cycloisomerization/alkoxyclization of 1,6&#8208;enyne and for hydration of terminal alkyne without the activation treatment. Even the mono(chlorogold) complexes catalyzed the alkoxycyclization reaction without silver co&#8208;catalyst, indicating that the alcohols were effective for the activation of AuCl unit</dc:description>

      <title>Dithieno[a,e]pentalenes: Highly Antiaromatic Yet Stable &#960;&#8208;Electron Systems without Bulky Substituents</title>
      <dc:description>Dithieno[a,e]penalenes (DTPs) with various substituents were synthesized as a class of antiaromatic compounds. Annulation of thiophene rings imparts the pentalene moiety with high thermal stability even without bulky substituents, while retaining antiaromaticity. The higher magnitude of antiaromaticity in DTPs, in addition to the differences in the electronic structures of the fused aromatic rings, resulted in a narrower HOMO&#8211;LUMO gap than that of the corresponding dibenzo[a,e]pentalene analog, giving rise to red&#8208;shifted electronic absorption that reaches the near&#8208;infrared region. Moreover, systematic investigations on the solid&#8208;state packing structure revealed that DTPs prefer offset face&#8208;to&#8208;face packing motifs rather than face&#8208;centered &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking.

      <title>Towards Photochromic Azobenzene&#8208;Based Inhibitors for Tryptophan Synthase</title>
      <dc:description>Light&#8208;regulation of drug molecules has gained growing interest in the fields of biochemical and pharmacological research in recent years. In addition, a serious need for novel molecular targets of antibiotics has emerged presently. Here, we present the development of a photo&#8208;controllable, azobenzene&#8208;based antibiotic precursor towards tryptophan synthase (TS), an essential metabolic multienzyme complex in bacteria. The compound exhibited a medium&#8208;strong inhibition of TS in its  E  configuration, and a 5&#8208;fold lower inhibition strength in its  Z  configuration. Using a combination of biochemical, crystallographic, and computational analyses we characterized the inhibition mode of this compound. Remarkably, binding of the inhibitor to a hitherto not considered cavity causes an unproductive conformation of TS leading to non&#8208;competitive inhibition of tryptophan production. In conclusion, we created a promising lead compound for the combat of bacterial diseases, which targets an essential metabolic enzyme, and whose inhibition strength can be controlled with light.</dc:description>

The compound exhibited a medium&#8208;strong inhibition of TS in its  E  configuration, and a 5&#8208;fold lower inhibition strength in its  Z  configuration. Using a combination of biochemical, crystallographic, and computational analyses we characterized the inhibition mode of this compound. Remarkably, binding of the inhibitor to a hitherto not considered cavity causes an unproductive conformation of TS leading to non&#8208;competitive inhibition of tryptophan production. In conclusion, we created a promising lead compound for the combat of bacterial diseases, which targets an essential metabolic enzyme, and whose inhibition strength can be controlled with light.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Alongside clinical platinum drugs, these bimetallic ruthenium&#8208;iron complexes have been screened for their cytotoxicity against MIA PaCa&#8208;2 (human pancreatic carcinoma), HCT116 p53+/+ (human colon carcinoma, p53&#8208;wild type) and ARPE&#8208;19 (human retinal pigment epithelial) cell lines. With the exception of one complex, the library exhibit nanomolar potency against cancerous cell lines, and their relative potencies are up to 40x, 400x and 72x more cytotoxic than cisplatin, carboplatin and oxaliplatin, respectively. Under hypoxic conditions, the complexes remain cytotoxic (sub&#8208;micromolar range), highlighting their potential in targeting hypoxic tumour regions. The Comet assay was used to determine their ability to damage DNA, and results show dose dependent damage which correlates well with the cytotoxicity results.

      <title>Generation of oxidoreductases with dual alcohol dehydrogenase and amine dehydrogenase activity</title>
      <dc:description>The l&#8208;lysine&#8208;&#949;&#8208;dehydrogenase (LysEDH) from Geobacillus stearothermophilus naturally catalyzes the oxidative deamination of the &#949;&#8208;amino group of l&#8208;lysine. We previously engineered this enzyme to create amine dehydrogenase (AmDH) variants that possess a new hydrophobic cavity in their active site such that aromatic ketones can bind and be converted into &#945;&#8208;chiral amines with excellent enantioselectivity. We also recently observed that LysEDH was capable of reducing aromatic aldehydes into primary alcohols. Herein, we harnessed the promiscuous alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) activity of LysEDH to create new variants that exhibited enhanced catalytic activity for the reduction of substituted benzaldehydes and arylaliphatic aldehydes to primary alcohols. Notably, these novel engineered dehydrogenases also catalyzed the reductive amination of a variety of aldehydes and ketones with excellent enantioselectivity, thus exhibiting a dual AmDH/ADH activity. We envisioned that the catalytic bi&#8208;functionality of these enzymes could be applied for the direct conversion of alcohols into amines. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;principle, we performed an unprecedented one&#8208;pot &#8220;hydrogen&#8208;borrowing&#8221; cascade to convert benzyl alcohol to benzylamine using a single enzyme. Conducting the same biocatalytic cascade in the presence of cofactor recycling enzymes (i.e., NADH&#8208;oxidase and formate dehydrogenase) increased the reaction yields.

      <title>Polyamine&#8208;functionalized 2&#8217;&#8208;amino&#8208;LNA in oligonucleotides: Facile synthesis of novel monomers and high affinity binding towards ssDNA and dsDNA</title>
      <dc:description>Attachment of cationic moieties onto oligonucleotides (ONs) promises not only to increase the binding affinity of antisense ONs by reducing charge repulsion between the two negative strands of a duplex but also to augment their  in vivo  stability against nucleases.

The resulting ONs exhibited efficient binding towards ssDNA, ssRNA and dsDNA targets, with the 2&#8217;&#8208;amino&#8208;LNA analogue carrying a tri&#8208;aminated linker showing the most pronounced duplex and triplex stabilizing effect. Molecular modelling revealed that favourable conformational and electrostatic effects led to the salt&#8208;bridge formed between positive&#8208;charged polyamine moieties and the Watson&#8208;Hoogsteen groove of the dsDNA targets, resulting in the observed triplex stabilization. All the investigated monomers conferred increased resistance against 3&#8217;&#8208;nucleolytic digestion relative to the non&#8208;functionalized controls.</dc:description>

Interestingly, the solid&#8208;state emissions of 2&#8208;4 are dependent on the templating anions and are tunable from green to orange and then to red by changing templates from CF3CO2&#8208; to MoO42&#8208; and to CrO42&#8208;, which maybe correlate to the charge transfer between these templates to metal atoms. This work helps to understand the templating role of hetero anions and the relationship between structure and properties.</dc:description>

      <title>Enantioselective aromatic amination?</title>
      <dc:description>The atroposelective formation of C&#8212;N bonds has recently emerged within the field of amination reactions. On first sight, it may seem quite surprising that such an ancient class or organic coupling reactions (Gabriel, Ullmann, Goldberg, Buchwald, Hartwig and many others) has so few enantioselective solutions, and this in spite of asymmetric synthesis being now a mature concept and field. Why should enantioselective C&#8212;N bond formation be so difficult? This question and some of the first examples that promise an imminent change of paradigm are herein discussed.</dc:description>

      <title>Enhancement of Photocatalytic Activity for Hydrogen Production by Surface Modification of Pt&#8208;TiO2 Nanoparticles with a Double Layer of Photosensitizers</title>
      <dc:description>To investigate the effect of the surface structure of dye&#8208;sensitized photocatalyst nanoparticles, we prepared three types of Ru(II)&#8208;photosensitizer(PS)&#8208;double&#8208;layered Pt&#8208;cocatalyst&#8208;loaded TiO  2  nanoparticles with different surface structures, Zr&#8208;  RuCP  6  &#8208;Zr&#8208;  RuP  6  @  N  &#160;wt%Pt&#8208;TiO  2  ,  RuCP  6  &#8208;Zr&#8208;  RuP  6  @  N  &#160;wt%Pt&#8208;TiO  2  , and  RuCP  2  &#8208;Zr&#8208;  RuP  6  @  N  &#160;wt%Pt&#8208;TiO  2  (  N  = 0.2, 1, and 5), and evaluated their photocatalytic H  2  evolution activity in the presence of redox&#8208;reversible iodide (I  &#8208;  ) as the electron donor. Although the driving force of the electron injection from I  &#8208;  to the photooxidized Ru(III) PS is comparable, the activity increased in the following order:  RuCP  2  &#8208;Zr&#8208;  RuP  6  @1&#160;wt%Pt&#8208;TiO  2  &lt;  RuCP  6  &#8208;Zr&#8208;  RuP  6  @1&#160;wt%Pt&#8208;TiO  2  &lt; Zr&#8208;  RuCP  6  &#8208;Zr&#8208;  RuP  6  @1&#160;wt%Pt&#8208;TiO  2  . The apparent quantum yield (AQY) of Zr&#8208;  RuCP  6  &#8208;Zr&#8208;  RuP  6  @1&#160;wt%Pt&#8208;TiO  2  in the first hour reached 1%. Zeta potential measurements suggest that the surface Zr  4+  &#8208;phosphate groups attracted I  &#8208;  anions to the nanoparticle&#8211;solution interface. Our results indicate that the surface modification of dye&#8208;sensitized photocatalysts is a promising approach to enhance the photocatalytic activity with various redox mediators.</dc:description>
